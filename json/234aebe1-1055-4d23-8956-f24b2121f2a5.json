She was packed and ready, as excited as she was scared about this undertaking. In the backseat she had a small cooler with snacks and sodas. There was a case of bottled water in the trunk and a thermos of coffee on the passenger seat. She\u2019d brought a sleeping bag just in case the motel bedding wasn\u2019t to her standards; the clothes she\u2019d packed in her duffel were mostly jeans, sweatshirts, heavy socks and boots, all appropriate for tramping around small mountain towns. She was itching to hit the road, but her younger brother, Drew, and her older sister, Erin, were stretching out the goodbyes.</p><p>\u201cYou have the phone cards I gave you? In case you don\u2019t have good cell reception?\u201d Erin asked.</p><p>\u201cGot \u2019em.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSure you have enough money?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanksgiving is in less than two weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt shouldn\u2019t take that long,\u201d Marcie said, because if she said anything else, there would be yet another showdown. \u201cI figure I\u2019m going to find Ian pretty quick. I think I have his location narrowed down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRethink this, Marcie,\u201d Erin said, giving it one last try. \u201cI know some of the best private detectives in the business\u2014the law firm employs them all the time. We could locate Ian and have the things you want to give him delivered.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been over this,\u201d Marcie said. \u201cI want to see him, talk to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe could find him first and then you could\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell her, Drew,\u201d Marcie implored.</p><p>Drew took a breath. \u201cShe\u2019s going to find him, talk to him, find out what\u2019s going on with him, spend some time with him, give him the baseball cards, show him the letter, and then she\u2019ll come home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut we could\u2014\u201d</p><p>Marcie put a hand on her older sister\u2019s arm and looked at her with determined green eyes. \u201cStop. I can\u2019t move on until I do this, and do it my way, not your way. We\u2019re done talking about it. I know you think it\u2019s dumb, but it\u2019s what I\u2019m going to do.\u201d She leaned toward Erin and gave her a kiss on the cheek. Erin, so sleek, beautiful, accomplished and sophisticated\u2014so nothing like Marcie\u2014had been like a mother to her since she was a little girl. She had a hard time leaving off the mothering. \u201cDon\u2019t worry\u2014there\u2019s nothing to worry about. I\u2019ll be careful. I won\u2019t be gone long.\u201d</p> <p>Then she kissed Drew\u2019s cheek and said, \u201cCan\u2019t you get her some Xanax or something?\u201d Drew was in med school and, no, he couldn\u2019t write prescriptions.</p><p>He laughed and wrapped his arms around her, hugging her tight for a moment. \u201cJust hurry up and get this over with. Erin\u2019s going to drive me nuts.\u201d</p><p>Marcie narrowed her eyes at Erin. \u201cGo easy on him,\u201d she said. \u201cThis was my idea. I\u2019ll be back before you know it.\u201d</p><p>And then she got in the car, leaving them standing on the curb in front of the house as she pulled away. She made it all the way to the highway before she felt her eyes sting with tears. She knew she was worrying her siblings, but she had no choice.</p><p>Marcie\u2019s husband, Bobby, had died almost a year ago, just before Christmas, at the age of twenty-six. That came after more than three years in hospitals and then in a nursing home\u2014hopelessly disabled and brain damaged, with injuries incurred as a marine serving in Iraq. Ian Buchanan was his sergeant and best friend, a marine Bobby said would do twenty. But Ian exited the Marine Corps shortly after Bobby was wounded and had been out of touch ever since.</p><p>Since she knew that Bobby would never recover, since she had grieved his loss for a long time before he actually died, Marcie would have expected to feel a sense of relief in his passing\u2014at least for him. She thought she\u2019d be more than ready to step into a new life, one that had been put on hold for years. At the tender age of twenty-seven, already a widow, there was still plenty of time for things like education, dating, travel\u2014so many possibilities. But it had been just shy of a year, and she was stuck. Unable to move forward. Wondering, always wondering, why the man Bobby had loved like a brother had dropped out of sight and had never called or written. He\u2019d estranged himself from his marine brothers and his father. Estranged himself from her, his best friend\u2019s wife.</p><p>So there were these baseball cards. If she stretched her imagination to the limit she couldn\u2019t come up with anything her lawyer sister would find more ridiculous than wanting to be sure Ian had Bobby\u2019s baseball cards. But since she\u2019d met Bobby at the age of fourteen, she knew how obsessed he was with his collection. There wasn\u2019t a player or stat he didn\u2019t have memorized. It turned out that Ian was also a baseball nut and had his own collection; she knew from Bobby\u2019s letters that they had talked about trading.</p><p>In the deserts and towns of Iraq, while they hunted insurgents and worried about suicide bombers and sniper fire, Bobby and Ian had talked about trading baseball cards. It was surreal.</p> <p>Then there was this letter that Bobby wrote to her from Iraq before he was wounded. It was all about Ian and how proud it would make him to be like Ian. He was a marine\u2019s marine\u2014the guy who got into the mess with his men, led them with strength and courage, never let them down, hung with them through everything\u2014whether they were up to their necks in a fight or crying over a dear-John letter. He was a funny guy, who made them all laugh, but he was a tough sergeant who also made them work hard, learn and follow every rule to the letter so they\u2019d be safe. It was in that letter that Bobby had told her he hoped she\u2019d support him if he decided to make it a career. Like Ian Buchanan had. If he could be half the man Ian was, he\u2019d be damn proud; all the men saw him as a hero, someone on his way to being a legend. Marcie wasn\u2019t sure she could part with the letter, even though it was all about Ian. But he should know. Ian should know how Bobby felt about him.</p><p>In the year since Bobby had moved into a quiet and peaceful death, she had passed his birthday, their anniversary, every holiday, and still, it was as though there was this unfinished business. There was a big piece missing; something yet to be resolved.</p><p>Ian had saved Bobby\u2019s life. He didn\u2019t make it out whole, but still\u2014Ian had braved death to carry Bobby to safety. And then he\u2019d disappeared. It was like a hangnail; she couldn\u2019t leave it alone. Couldn\u2019t let it go.</p><p>Marcie didn\u2019t have much money; she\u2019d had the same secretarial job for five years\u2014a good job with good people, but with pay that couldn\u2019t support a family. She was lucky her boss gave her as much time as she wanted right after Bobby was wounded, because she\u2019d traveled first to Germany, then to D.C. to be near him, and the expenses had been enormous, far more than his paycheck could bear. As a third-year enlisted marine, he\u2019d earned less than fifteen hundred dollars a month. She\u2019d pushed the credit cards to the max and took out loans, despite the willingness of Erin and Bobby\u2019s family to help her. In the end, his military life insurance hadn\u2019t gone too far to pay those bills, and the widow\u2019s death benefit wasn\u2019t much either.</p><p>The miracle was getting him home to Chico, which was probably entirely due to Erin\u2019s bulldogging. Many families of military men who were 100 percent disabled and in long-term care actually relocated to be near the patient, because the government wouldn\u2019t or couldn\u2019t send the patient home to them. But Erin managed to get them into CHAMPUS, a private nursing home in Chico paid for by the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services. Most soldiers were not so fortunate. It was a complicated and strained system, now heavy with casualties. Erin had taken care of everything\u2014using her exquisite lawyer\u2019s brain to get the best benefits and stipend possible from the Corps. Erin hadn\u2019t wanted Marcie to be stressed by benefit or money worries on top of everything else. Erin had done it all, even paid all the household bills. In addition to all that, she was somehow managing the cost of Drew\u2019s medical college.</p><p>So, for this excursion, she couldn\u2019t take a dime from her sister. Erin had already given so much. Drew did have some pocket change, but being a poor medical student, he didn\u2019t have much. It would have been far more practical to wait till spring\u2014until she\u2019d had a chance to put aside a little more\u2014to head into the small towns and mountains of Northern California looking for Ian Buchanan, but there was something about the anniversary of Bobby\u2019s death and Christmas approaching that filled her with a fierce longing to get the matter settled once and for all. Wouldn\u2019t it be nice, she kept thinking, if the questions could be answered and the contact renewed before the holidays?</p><p>Marcie meant to find him. To give peace to the ghosts. And then they could all get on with their lives....</p><p>One</p><p>M arcie Sullivan drove into the small town, her sixth small mountain town of the day, and found herself face-to-face with a Christmas-tree trimming. The assembled staff didn\u2019t look big enough for the job\u2014the tree was enormous.</p><p>She pulled up beside a large cabin with a wide porch, parked her Volkswagen and got out. There were three women at work on a Christmas fir that stood about thirty feet. One was about Marcie\u2019s age, with soft brown hair and she held an open box, perhaps containing ornaments. One woman was old, with springy white hair and black-framed glasses, who pointed upward, as if someone had put her in charge, and the third was a beautiful blonde at the top of a tall, A-frame ladder.</p><p>The tree stood between the cabin and an old boarded-up church with two tall steeples and one stained-glass window still intact\u2014a church that must have once been a beautiful structure.</p><p>While Marcie watched the trimming, a man came out onto the cabin\u2019s porch, stopped, looked up and cursed, then took long strides to the base of the ladder. \u201cDon\u2019t move. Don\u2019t breathe,\u201d he said in a low, commanding voice. He took the rungs every other one, climbing quickly until he reached the blonde. Then he slipped an arm around her, somewhere above what Marcie realized must be a little pregnant bulge and beneath her breasts and said, \u201cDown. Slowly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack!\u201d she scolded. \u201cLeave me alone!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I have to, I\u2019ll carry you down. Back down the ladder, slowly. Now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh for God\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow,\u201d he said evenly, fiercely.</p><p>She began to descend, one rung at a time between his big, sturdy feet, while he held her safe against him. When they got to the bottom, she put her hands on her hips and glared up at him. \u201cI knew exactly what I was doing!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is your brain? What if you fell from that height?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s an excellent ladder! I wasn\u2019t going to fall!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re psychic, too? You can argue all you want, I\u2019m not letting you that high up a ladder in your condition,\u201d he said, his hands also on his hips. \u201cI\u2019ll stand guard over you if I have to.\u201d Then he looked over his shoulder at the other two women.</p><p>\u201cI told her I thought you wouldn\u2019t like that,\u201d the brown-haired one said with a helpless shrug.</p><p>He glared at the white-haired woman. \u201cI don\u2019t get into domestic things. That\u2019s your problem, not mine,\u201d she said, pushing her big glasses up on her nose.</p><p>And Marcie became homesick. So homesick. It had only been a few weeks that she\u2019d been driving around this area, but she missed all the family squabbles, the tiresome complications. She missed her girlfriends, her job. She longed for her bossy older sister\u2019s interference, her goofy younger brother and whatever current girlfriend was shadowing him. She missed her late husband\u2019s large, fun, passionate family.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t made it home for Thanksgiving\u2014she\u2019d been afraid to go for even a day or two, afraid she\u2019d never pry herself out of Erin\u2019s grip a second time. Home was Chico, California, just a few hours away, but no one\u2014not her brother and sister, not Bobby\u2019s family\u2014thought what she was doing a good idea. So, she\u2019d been calling, lying and saying she had tips about Ian and was close to finding him. Every time she called, at least every other day, she said she was getting closer when really, she wasn\u2019t. But she was not ready to quit. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But one problem was looming large\u2014she was just about out of money. She\u2019d been sleeping in her car lately rather than in motels, and it was getting uncomfortable as the temperatures dropped in the mountains. At any moment snow would be falling now that it was early December, or rain could turn to sleet and that little VeeDub could sail off the mountainside like a missile.</p><p>She\u2019d just hate to go home with this mission incomplete. More than anything, she wanted to see it through. If she wasn\u2019t successful now, she\u2019d only go home to earn a little money and then do it all again. She just couldn\u2019t give up on him. On herself.</p><p>They were all looking at her. She pushed her wildly curly, out of control, bright red hair over one shoulder nervously.</p> <p>\u201cI...Ah...I could go up there, if you want. I\u2019m not afraid of heights or anything...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to go up the ladder,\u201d the pregnant blonde said, and her voice had softened considerably. She smiled sweetly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go up the ladder,\u201d the man said. \u201cOr I\u2019ll get someone to go up the goddamn ladder, but it\u2019s not you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack! Be polite!\u201d</p><p>He cleared his throat. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about the ladder,\u201d he said more calmly. \u201cAnything we can do for you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI...Ah...\u201d She walked toward them. She pulled a picture out of the inside of her down vest and extended it toward the man. \u201cI\u2019m looking for someone. He dropped out of sight just over three years ago, but I know he\u2019s around here somewhere. He seems to be taking mail at Fortuna Post Office general delivery.\u201d</p><p>She passed the picture to the man. \u201cJesus,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYou know him?\u201d she asked hopefully.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, shaking his head. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t, and that\u2019s strange. The guy\u2019s a marine,\u201d he said, studying the picture of a man in uniform. It was Ian\u2019s official Marine Corps portrait, a handsome man all clean shaven and trussed up in dress blues, hat and medals. \u201cI can\u2019t believe there\u2019s a marine within fifty miles of here I don\u2019t at least know about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe might be keeping that fact to himself\u2014he and the Marine Corps had a troubled relationship at the end. So I\u2019ve heard...\u201d</p><p>He looked back at her face and his expression was much more tender. \u201cI\u2019m Jack Sheridan,\u201d he said. \u201cMy wife, Mel. That\u2019s Paige,\u201d he said, nodding toward the younger woman. \u201cAnd Hope McCrea, town busybody.\u201d He put out his hand to Marcie.</p> <p>She placed hers in his. \u201cMarcie Sullivan,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you looking for this marine?\u201d Jack asked.</p><p>\u201cLong story,\u201d she said. \u201cA friend of my late husband. I\u2019m sure he doesn\u2019t look like this anymore\u2014he had some injuries. There\u2019s a scar down his left cheek and on that same side, no eyebrow. And he probably has a beard. He did the last time he was seen, about three or four years ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo shortage of beards around here,\u201d Jack said. \u201cLumber country\u2014men get a little scruffy-looking sometimes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he could\u2019ve changed in other ways, too. Like\u2014he\u2019s older. Thirty-five now\u2014that picture was taken when he was twenty-eight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFriend of your husband\u2019s? From the Corps?\u201d Jack confirmed.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019d like to find him. You know\u2014because he\u2019s been out of touch for a long time.\u201d</p><p>Jack seemed to think while he studied the face in the picture. It was several silent moments before he said, \u201cCome on into the bar. Have a bite, a beer maybe, or whatever you like. Tell me a little about him and why you want to find him. How\u2019s that?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe bar?\u201d she said, looking around.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a bar and grill,\u201d he said with a smile. \u201cFood and drink. We can eat and talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she said. Her stomach growled angrily. It was late in the day, about four o\u2019clock, and she hadn\u2019t eaten yet, but she was saving her money for the gas tank and she figured she could forget about food a while longer. Maybe she\u2019d get something real, real cheap to tide her over, like a loaf of day-old bread to go with that half a jar of peanut butter in the car.... Then, she\u2019d find a safe spot to park and button down for the night. \u201cA glass of water would be really welcome\u2014I\u2019ve been driving around for hours, showing his picture to anyone who will take a look. But I\u2019m not hungry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot lots of water,\u201d Jack said with a smile. He put a hand on her shoulder and started to direct her toward the porch of the bar, but then he stopped suddenly. His brows drew together in a frown. \u201cGo ahead,\u201d he said to her. \u201cI\u2019m right behind you.\u201d</p><p>Marcie walked up on the porch and turned to see what he was doing. He was confiscating the ladder so his pregnant wife wouldn\u2019t climb it again, that\u2019s what he was doing. It was a jackknife kind of affair that could be a short or tall A-frame ladder, and he collapsed it, folded it up until he could lift it with one hand. It was about six feet long dismantled and he carried it right into the bar. Behind him, Marcie heard his wife yell, \u201cYou\u2019re a bossy pain in the ass! When did I ever indicate I\u2019d take my orders from you?\u201d</p><p>Jack didn\u2019t say anything back, but he grinned as though she\u2019d just thrown him a kiss. \u201cHop up there,\u201d he said to Marcie, indicating the bar. \u201cI\u2019ll be right back.\u201d And he carried the ladder through a door behind the bar.</p><p>She took a deep breath and thought, Oh hell\u2014I\u2019m not going to be able to survive the aromas! Her stomach made itself heard again and she put a hand against her belly, pushing. Something in the kitchen was sending out waves of delicious smells\u2014something simmering, rich, hot and thick, like beefy, seasoned soup; fresh bread; something sweet and chocolate.</p><p>And when the man named Jack came back, he was carrying a tray with a steaming bowl on it. He put everything in front of her; chili, corn bread and honey butter, a small bowl of salad. \u201cGee, um, sorry,\u201d she said. \u201cReally, I\u2019m not hungry...\u201d</p><p>He drew a cold draft and her mouth actually watered. Gratefully she didn\u2019t drool on the bar. She swallowed hard. She had about thirty bucks and didn\u2019t want to waste it on a fancy meal, not when she needed every cent for gas to hit all these little mountain towns.</p><p>\u201cFine, then you\u2019ll only eat what you want,\u201d he said. \u201cJust have a taste. I showed the picture to Preacher, my cook. He hasn\u2019t seen the guy either. We\u2019ll check with Mike\u2014he\u2019s the town cop and gets around all the back roads, just to know who\u2019s out there\u2014maybe he\u2019ll have a tip or two. They\u2019re also marines.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere exactly am I?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cVirgin River,\u201d he said. \u201cPopulation six hundred twenty-seven at last count.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, that made the map.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should hope so\u2014we\u2019re a screaming metropolis compared to a lot of small towns out here. Just try it,\u201d he said, nodding at the bowl.</p><p>Her hand trembled a little as she picked up the spoon and sampled some of the finest chili she\u2019d ever eaten. It melted in her mouth, and she actually sighed.</p><p>\u201cMade with venison,\u201d he said. \u201cWe got a nice buck a couple months ago and when that happens, we have some of the best chili, stew, burgers and sausage in the world, for months.\u201d He patted a big jar of jerky that rested on the bar. \u201cPreacher makes some unbelievable venison jerky, too.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes watered\u2014the food was so good. Despite all her promises to Erin and Drew, she hadn\u2019t been eating well or playing it carefully, scrimping on food and sleeping in the car. When Erin saw the way her jeans were hanging off her little frame, the shit was going to hit the fan.</p><p>\u201cWant to tell me a little about our guy, between bites?\u201d Jack asked.</p><p>Oh, what the hell, Marcie thought. She hadn\u2019t had a really good hot meal in days, and once she was out of money there would be no choice but to go home. She\u2019d just have to spend a little of that money, maybe leave the mountains a day earlier than she wanted to. She had to eat, for God\u2019s sake! Couldn\u2019t hardly perform a manhunt without food!</p><p>She took a couple of quick bites to beat back the worst of her ravenous hunger, then a sip of that icy beer to wash it down. It was heaven, pure heaven. \u201cHis name\u2019s Ian Buchanan. We came from the same town, but didn\u2019t know each other growing up, even though Chico\u2019s small\u2014only about fifty thousand. Ian\u2019s eight years older than we are. Were. My husband and I, we grew up together, went through high school together and got married real young, at nineteen. Bobby went into the Marine Corps right out of high school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo did I,\u201d Jack said. \u201cDid twenty. What was your husband\u2019s name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBobby Sullivan. Robert Wilson Sullivan. Any chance...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t recall a Bobby Sullivan or an Ian Buchanan. Got a picture of your husband?\u201d</p><p>She reached into her vest pocket and pulled out a wallet, flipped it open and turned it to face Jack. There were several pictures in the clear plastic sleeves. She ate while Jack flipped through\u2014the nineteen-year-olds\u2019 wedding picture, Bobby\u2019s official Marine Corps portrait\u2014a fine-looking young man, a beautiful man. There were a couple of casual shots showing off his strong profile, powerful shoulders and arms, and then the last one\u2014Bobby, almost unrecognizable, thin, gaunt, pale, eyes open but unfocused, in a raised hospital bed, Marcie sitting beside him, cradling his head against her shoulder, smiling.</p><p>Jack lifted his gaze from the pictures and looked at her solemnly. She put the spoon in the chili and patted her lips with the napkin. \u201cHe went over to Iraq in the first wave,\u201d she said. \u201cHe was twenty-two. Twenty-three when he was wounded. Spinal cord injury and brain damage. He spent over three years like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, kid,\u201d Jack said, his strong voice weak. \u201cMust\u2019 a been awful hard...\u201d</p><p>She blinked a few times, but her eyes didn\u2019t tear up. Yeah, there were times it was terrible, times it was heartbreaking, even times she resented the hell out of what the Marine Corps left her to deal with at her young age. There were also times she\u2019d lie beside him in bed, pull him into her arms, press her lips against his cheek and just hold them there, remembering. \u201cYeah, sometimes,\u201d she answered. \u201cWe got by. There was a lot of support. My family and his family. I wasn\u2019t in it all alone.\u201d She swallowed. \u201cHe didn\u2019t seem to be in pain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen did he pass?\u201d Jack asked.</p><p>\u201cAlmost a year ago, right before Christmas. Quietly. Very quietly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy condolences,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>\u201cThank you. He served with Ian. Ian was his sergeant. Bobby loved him. He wrote me about him all the time, called him the best sergeant in the Corps. They became good friends almost right away. Ian was the kind of leader who was right in it with his men. Bobby was so happy that Ian turned out to be from our hometown. They were going to be pals forever, long after they were out of the Corps.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI went to Iraq right away, too. Went the first time, too. I was probably there at the same time. Fallujah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm. That\u2019s where it happened.\u201d</p><p>Jack shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m so goddamn sorry.\u201d Jack slid the wallet back. \u201cThat why you\u2019re looking for Buchanan? To tell him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe might already know\u2014I wrote to him a lot. Care of general delivery in Fortuna. The letters didn\u2019t come back, so I assume he picked them up.\u201d</p><p>Jack\u2019s brow wrinkled curiously.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what happened to Ian. Right after Bobby got hurt, while he was hospitalized in Germany and then in Washington, D.C., at Walter Reed, I wrote to Ian and he answered my letters. He wanted to know about Bobby\u2019s condition and how I was holding up. I looked forward to his letters\u2014I could see what Bobby saw. I felt kind of close to Ian just from Bobby\u2019s letters, then when we started to correspond and I was getting to know him myself, he started to feel like my friend, too. I can\u2019t explain it\u2014it was just letters. And they were mostly about Bobby. But I think I got close to him\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLotta servicemen get really attached to pen pals,\u201d Jack said. \u201cEspecially when they\u2019re on isolated tours like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, no indication Ian got close to me, but I did to him. Then he came back from Iraq, looked in on us once and got out of the Marines shortly after that. He drifted away and didn\u2019t come back to Chico. He had some trouble in the Corps after Iraq. I don\u2019t know the details, but his father thought he was a lifer, yet he got out at the first opportunity, right on the heels of having a real hard time.\u201d A huff of sad laughter escaped. \u201cHe never called or wrote again. He broke up with his girl, fell out with his father and went away. About a year later, I found out he was living in the woods like an old hermit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know that he\u2019s out in the woods?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a VA outpatient clinic in Chico I got pretty cozy with because of Bobby. A few people there knew I wanted to get in touch with Ian. I\u2019m sure they weren\u2019t supposed to tell me things, but vets\u2014they help each other all they can. Turns out, Ian showed up at the clinic once\u2014it must have been the nearest facility for him. He said he didn\u2019t have an address because he was out in the forest and the nearest big town was Fortuna, and he could get any VA forms or whatever at general delivery there. He hurt himself chopping wood and needed stitches, a tetanus shot and antibiotics. He was right there\u2014where we were, where his father was\u2014and he didn\u2019t even phone to say he was all right, or to ask how Bobby was doing. This just doesn\u2019t seem like the man my husband had described to me. The man I got to know.\u201d</p><p>Jack was quiet a moment, and Marcie took a few more bites of food. She spread butter on the corn bread and gobbled up half, giving lie to her \u201cnot hungry\u201d state.</p><p>\u201cI started sending letters to Fortuna after that, but he didn\u2019t respond. I think I wrote him more for myself than for him, and I pictured him reading them, but...I invited him to call me collect, but I never heard from him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re going after him?\u201d Jack finally said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to find him,\u201d she affirmed. \u201cI have to know if he\u2019s all right. I\u2019ve thought about it a lot\u2014for all I know, he might\u2019ve come back from Iraq with some serious issues, maybe not as plain to the naked eye as Bobby\u2019s issues. I\u2019d blame the Marine Corps for not helping him, if that was the case.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re right\u2014if he needed help, they should\u2019ve helped. But try not to be too hard on the Corps. It gets complicated\u2014you train a marine to be fearless, then expect him to ask for help? Doesn\u2019t add up. When I figure out how they should get around that, I\u2019ll write the state department.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust the same...\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould be he chose the lifestyle he wants. I came out of the Corps looking for a quiet place to hunt and fish and found Virgin River. I holed up for a while, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you lose contact with your family?\u201d she asked, lifting one tawny brow. \u201cRefuse to answer mail?\u201d</p><p>Jack had not only had constant contact with his family, but with his squad. And he appreciated it. \u201cNo. Point taken.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to find him. Some things need to be sorted out. Finished. You know?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cListen, what if he\u2019s not all right?\u201d Jack ventured, leaning both hands on the bar and looking at her closely. Intensely. \u201cWhat if he\u2019s a little nuts or something? Even dangerous?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe still has a father who\u2019s getting older and isn\u2019t well. Things are unsettled with the two of them. Mr. Buchanan is a stubborn, crotchety old coot, but I bet underneath all that crust he wants his son back, no matter what he is. I would.\u201d She started on her salad.</p><p>\u201cI get that,\u201d Jack said. \u201cBut what if he\u2019s dangerous to you?\u201d</p><p>She let go a short laugh. \u201cI guess it\u2019s possible, but I doubt it,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve been to the police department, sheriff\u2019s department and every gas station, hardware store and bar around\u2014he doesn\u2019t have a record and no one knows him. If he was dangerous, he would probably have drawn some attention to himself, don\u2019t you think? He\u2019s probably just a sulky, troubled, screwed-up marine who thinks dropping out is better than dealing with his baggage. And he\u2019d be wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wanna think this through?\u201d he asked. \u201cMarines all screwed up by war have a lot of mysterious reasons for taking that route, dropping out like that. Could be he\u2019d like to forget, and seeing you just makes things worse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019ve been to war, so you would know something about that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoy howdy, as my wife would say. I\u2019ve carried around my own crap, had a problem or two with PTSD. Luckily, I have strong support.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s only thirty-five, time enough to start over, patch things up with anyone he\u2019s alienated himself from, get beyond any trauma he has over what happened to Bobby. His father might\u2019ve been a little pissed off back when they fought, but the old man still loves his son. I\u2019d bet on that.\u201d She took a sip of her beer and said, quietly, \u201cI might lose my money, but I\u2019d bet.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen why doesn\u2019t his father try to find him?\u201d Jack asked.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t anyone? His ex-fianc\u00e9e really hates him for ditching her, his father is seventy-one and sick. Widowed, bitter, stubborn. I gotta say, he\u2019s one mean, unforgiving old man. But even if there\u2019s no help for that, I can get to know Bobby\u2019s best friend again. We only wrote for a few months, but I thought I knew him. And he was sweet. This is going to sound silly\u2014his handwriting was strong and nice, the things he wrote were kind and sensitive. I kind of feel like I lost a friend and...\u201d She smiled at Jack. \u201cBesides, no one\u2019s as determined as I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd why is that? Why are you so determined?\u201d</p><p>She looked down. \u201cI can\u2019t move on until I know why the man my husband loved most, admired most, would disappear like that. Ignore us the way he did. Let himself be gobbled up by a forest and not have any contact with his family, his friends. Really\u2014that\u2019s the insane part. I have to know why. I want to be sure he\u2019s okay. Then I\u2019ll let it go.\u201d She looked up. \u201cThen maybe we can all move on.\u201d</p><p>Jack couldn\u2019t help but grin at her; she sure knew what she wanted. He watched her shovel the last of her salad into her mouth. \u201cChocolate cake?\u201d he asked. \u201cIt\u2019ll bring you to your knees.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks. This was good.\u201d Her wallet still sat on the bar. She drained the beer, then began leafing through the bills in her wallet. \u201cWhat do I owe you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re kidding me, right? You\u2019re going out in the woods to find one of my brothers and you think I\u2019d take your money? Hell, I\u2019d offer to help, but you can see\u2014I can\u2019t leave Melinda alone for one second. She\u2019s trouble. Nah, it\u2019s my pleasure to give you a little meal. Anytime you want, in fact. Check in here regular, fuel up your belly, let us know if you find anything...anyone. We\u2019d all appreciate that. Bunch of us jarheads from Fallujah around here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are there marines here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweetheart, there are marines everywhere.\u201d He grinned. \u201cOnce I opened the bar, a lot of my old squad started showing up to hunt or fish. A couple of them didn\u2019t have better options and moved here. Really, we try to look out for our kind. All for one,\u201d he added.</p><p>She closed the wallet and smiled at him, an affectionate, grateful smile. She was well-trained in taking whatever help was offered. \u201cThen I\u2019ll have the cake,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cAnd coffee?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cOh, God, yes, coffee,\u201d she said, almost sighing in appreciation. A cold beer, a hot cup of good coffee\u2014two of her biggest weaknesses.</p><p>\u201cBest coffee you\u2019ll ever taste,\u201d he said, filling a cup for her. When a thick slice of cake sat before her, he asked, \u201cWhen you find him, what are your plans?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was awful good to Bobby\u2014I\u2019d just like to thank him. Talk to him. Get to know him again, like I started to before. I have something of Bobby\u2019s to give him. I plan to ask him what happened, see if there\u2019s anything I can do for him now. Maybe once we get through all that, we\u2019ll both be happier. Obviously he hasn\u2019t moved on, and I need a little more closure. Wouldn\u2019t it be great if we could both get that? Aw, I don\u2019t know, Jack. Freedom? The freedom to put the past in the past?\u201d</p><p>Jack\u2019s eyebrows rose. \u201cAnd if he\u2019s not inclined to talk?\u201d</p><p>She put a big forkful of velvety, rich chocolate cake into her mouth, scraping the icing off the fork with her teeth and lips. She let her eyes drop closed for a brief luxurious moment. Then she smiled at Jack Sheridan and said, \u201cThen I\u2019ll be his worst nightmare until he comes around. I\u2019m not giving up.\u201d</p><p>Before Marcie had finished her coffee, a good-looking Hispanic man came into the bar by way of the side door. He had a disgruntled look on his face and was carrying a catalog. \u201cYour wife has me in search of the perfect tree topper,\u201d he said to Jack. \u201cWhose idea was this again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it was yours,\u201d Jack said. \u201cAnd don\u2019t complain to me\u2014there\u2019s no way to decorate that tree without a cherry picker. I\u2019m going to have to rent one before I see Mel using ropes and pulleys to get to the top. Mike, meet Marcie\u2014Marcie, say hello to Mike Valenzuela.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you do,\u201d she said, sticking out a hand.</p><p>He took it, smiled and said, \u201cPleasure. This was his idea\u2014the big tree. Trying to impress his wife. She requested a large tree\u2014he had us out in the hills a full day till he found the biggest tree we could take down in one piece.\u201d</p><p>Just a little embarrassed, Jack interrupted Mike, \u201cMarcie here is looking for a marine who dropped out after Iraq. Show him the picture, Marcie.\u201d</p><p>She pulled it out again and once again explained the possible changes in his appearance since the photo was taken.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t know him,\u201d Mike said.</p><p>\u201cBut he might be so different...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t know the eyes,\u201d Mike said.</p><p>She let out a heavy sigh. \u201cAny ideas where I might look?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Mike began, scratching his chin. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen him, but that doesn\u2019t mean he hasn\u2019t been seen. There are a lot of people out in the mountains who have been there for years and they aren\u2019t real sociable\u2014maybe one of them has seen him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you tell me where to go?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI can give you a couple of markers,\u201d he said. \u201cMore important, I\u2019d like to tell you a few places to steer clear of\u2014there are some illegal growers out there who get real territorial. Real unfriendly. Sometimes their property is booby-trapped.\u201d He pulled a large napkin out from under the bar, brought his pen out of his shirt pocket and drew a line on the napkin. \u201cHere\u2019s highway 36...\u201d In ten minutes, he had drawn a rough map of a half-dozen cabins in the mountains where people lived\u2014people who just might have seen Ian Buchanan. As well, he listed three locations she should avoid.</p><p>The cabins Mike X\u2019d on the map were located down abandoned logging roads, sometimes gated, snuggled behind trees and shrubs, impossible to see from the highway. A lot of that mountain property had been homesteaded and logged. Once a property was logged, the owner had to wait another thirty to fifty years to log it again. It became an acreage full of oak, madrone, young fir and pine fifty to sixty feet tall\u2014real pretty, but not mature enough for logging.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been roaming around back in there, just checking it out, just to know who\u2019s out there. There are a couple of old men living alone out in the sticks and a couple of old widows. There\u2019s a man and woman combo or two, even a family of five. But so far, no single thirty-five-year-old male.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMaybe he\u2019s not single anymore.\u201d</p><p>Mike shook his head. \u201cPretty sure there\u2019s no one in that age group; not with those eyes. Even with a beard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBelieve him,\u201d Jack said. \u201cHe used to be a real cop, LAPD, before he was Andy of Mayberry where we have almost no crime.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNice,\u201d Marcie said. \u201cNo crime and a big tree. I take it you\u2019ve never done a big tree like that before?\u201d</p><p>They both laughed. \u201cTwenty-seven feet,\u201d Jack said. \u201cWe thought we were so manly, finding us a big one like that, till we had it down and almost had to rent a flatbed truck to bring it back to town. We tied the limbs tight and dragged it behind a truck. And that wasn\u2019t the hard part. Standing it up took a day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo days,\u201d Mike corrected. \u201cWe got up the next morning and it was lying in the street. Frickin\u2019 miracle it didn\u2019t fall on the bar and crush the roof.\u201d</p><p>She laughed at them. \u201cWhy now? You\u2019re trying to show off for your wife?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah. Now was the time. We just lost a comrade in Iraq and one of the local boys\u2014a real special one\u2014went into the Corps. We thought it would be good to erect a symbol, a monument to the men and women who serve. Next year, I think we look for a slightly smaller symbol. Cheaper and easier on the nerves. But I\u2019ll go over to Eureka and find a cherry picker for rent and get it done. Melinda and the other women have put a lot into making it a perfect tree.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a pretty awesome tree,\u201d Marcie said, growing a little melancholy. She really wanted to find Ian before Christmas. For some reason, that seem crucial.</p><p>As she was leaving, the sun was lowering and the bar was starting to fill with locals. It was already getting too dark to venture into the back woods to check out the few cabins Mike had told her about. It was time for her to find a place to park for the night, somewhere safe and not too far from a service station for her morning rituals of peeing, face washing, teeth brushing. She\u2019d start again in the morning, though she wasn\u2019t feeling optimistic she\u2019d find her guy. She\u2019d been disappointed so many times. At this point in her search, crossing all the places off her list meant as much as striking pay dirt.</p><p>But before going to her car, she approached the tree, partially decorated to about twelve feet. She got up close and looked at some of the ornaments. Between red, white and blue balls and gold stars were patches\u2014the kind you\u2019d wear on a uniform\u2014from various Marine and other military commands. She touched one reverently; 1st Battalion, 8th Marines; 2nd Battalion, 10th Marine Regiment; 1st Marine Special Operations Battalion, all laminated to protect them against the outdoor elements. Airborne Division, Sniper Squad, 41st Infantry Battalion. Her throat got tight; her eyes blurred.</p><p>This was exactly why she was determined to find Ian Buchanan\u2014because these men never forgot, never walked away. There had to be powerful reasons for him to leave his military brothers, his Corps, his family, his town. You don\u2019t save a comrade\u2019s life and then ignore him. Ian Buchanan was given both the Bronze Star and Purple Heart for carrying Bobby through sniper fire to medical transport. He took two bullets and kept going. He was not a man who gave up. So why? Why give up now?</p><p>Two</p><p>M arcie\u2019s thirty bucks\u2014$28.87, to be exact\u2014lasted another thirty-six hours. Twenty-five of them went in the gas tank; she could hardly afford the gas even with the great mileage she got in her little green bug. Three dollars for a loaf of bread and two apples and she finished off the peanut butter. Then she went back to that little Virgin River bar and asked if she could use the phone to make a call to her sister\u2014she\u2019d almost exhausted the phone cards because she wasn\u2019t supposed to be gone this long, but there was a little time left on one. Erin, seven years older than Marcie, had taken charge of the family long ago, and she was growing extremely irritable by Marcie\u2019s time away.</p> <p>The cook, a guy they all called Preacher, let her into the kitchen.</p><p>Marcie called Erin and, though it made her stomach clench, she asked for money. \u201cCall it a loan,\u201d she said. She lied and said she was getting so close, that Ian had been seen.</p><p>\u201cWe had a deal, Marcie,\u201d Erin said. \u201cYou promised you\u2019d only be gone a couple of weeks and it\u2019s been a month. You didn\u2019t even come home for Thanksgiving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t. I explained about that. I had a tip\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s time for you to come home now and think about another way to find him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m not stopping. I\u2019m not giving up,\u201d Marcie said resolutely.</p><p>\u201cOkay, but come back to Chico and we\u2019ll try it my way\u2014we\u2019ll get a professional to find him for you\u2014then you can go from there. Really, the only way I know to get you home and through with this madness is to say no. No money, Marcie, for your own good. The only money I\u2019ll wire you is enough to get home. Come home now. Right now. This is scaring me to death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not done!\u201d</p> <p>Marcie then called her younger brother, Drew, who might not agree with what she was doing any more than Erin did, but he was a softer touch. He said, \u201cMarcie, I can\u2019t. Erin\u2019s right, this has gone on too long. You have to give this up now. Come on, I can\u2019t stand to think about what you\u2019re doing. You\u2019re going after a friggin\u2019 lunatic, by yourself!\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she whimpered. \u201cWe don\u2019t know he\u2019s a lunatic\u2014he could be perfectly normal. Or maybe just sad. Please, just a few more days. Please. I\u2019m so close.\u201d</p><p>Drew let out a breath, defeated. \u201cI\u2019ll wire you a hundred bucks, then you come back, you hear me? And don\u2019t you dare tell Erin what I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t tell,\u201d she said, wiping at her cheeks, smiling into the phone. \u201cThank you, Drew. I love you so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m not showing you how much I care by doing this. I worry about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Drew,\u201d she said with a sniff. \u201cCan you just put some cash in my checking account? I\u2019ll go to Fortuna and withdraw it from the branch there. I\u2019ll be there in less than an hour\u2014and I\u2019m running on fumes. Fortunately, I can coast downhill most of the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere was he seen?\u201d Drew asked.</p><p>\u201cUm...He was seen...um...out in a cabin off the highway a ways. I\u2019ll check out there later to see if it\u2019s really him,\u201d she said, and then her cheeks actually flushed. She said goodbye, disconnected and fanned her face, saying, \u201cWhew.\u201d She looked up and found herself staring into the fierce eyes of the giant in the kitchen. She actually started.</p><p>\u201cHe hasn\u2019t been seen,\u201d Preacher said, his thick dark brows furrowing. \u201cHas he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, maybe he has. And I\u2019m just about to find out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes a man just wants to be left alone for a while. You account for that?\u201d Preacher asked. While he was talking, he pulled a plastic grocery sack out of a drawer, then turned to get something that looked like a wrapped sandwich out of the refrigerator and put it in the sack. Then a second one went in.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been longer than a while,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I\u2019ll certainly give him a chance to tell me, if that\u2019s the case. If that\u2019s it, I\u2019ll have the opportunity to thank him for his friendship to my husband, then I\u2019ll go back to Chico and tell his father and anyone else who cares that he\u2019s just a man who wants to be left alone. But isn\u2019t there something \u2018off\u2019 about that? That he\u2019s been out of touch for years now?\u201d</p><p>Preacher took a big bowl out of the refrigerator, flipped the lid and spooned potato salad into a smaller plastic container, then sealed it. \u201cYou\u2019re real insistent on this, then?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to admit that, for no accountable reason, she\u2019d been obsessed about Ian Buchanan\u2019s disappearance. She\u2019d written him a couple dozen letters\u2014at first for him, updating him on Bobby and whatever else was going on in her family, her life, giving information and reassurance. Then, it was more for herself\u2014like keeping a journal. She didn\u2019t know exactly why, but he had been with her a long time. So she shrugged. \u201cThere are a few of us who want to know. Well, there\u2019s me. I want to know.\u201d Quietly she added, \u201cHave to know.\u201d</p><p>Preacher added the container and a spoon to the bag. Then he got out a huge jar of pickles and picked out three big ones, putting them in a handy ziplock bag. \u201cWell then, I guess you\u2019re not going to quit early.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess not,\u201d she said.</p><p>He pushed the whole business toward her. \u201cDon\u2019t let that potato salad sit and get warm. It\u2019s cold enough outside to keep it all day if you leave it in the trunk and not in a warm car. Just remember, old warm potato salad has a nasty reputation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe car can coast,\u201d he said, lifting one of those menacing black brows. \u201cYou, on the other hand, can only run on fumes so long.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth dropped open a bit and she stared at him. She wondered if he\u2019d done that because he\u2019d seen the way her once-tight jeans hung off her fanny. \u201cThat\u2019s nice,\u201d she finally said. \u201cI\u2019ll...ah...bring back the spoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you drop by, fine. If you don\u2019t, we have plenty of spoons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d she said, accepting the bag.</p><p>\u201cGood luck,\u201d Preacher said. \u201cI hope it goes the way you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too,\u201d she said with a sheepish smile.</p><p>Several hours later, as the day drew into afternoon, she was driving up her fifth or sixth unmarked dirt road, but she was a hundred bucks richer. Well, eighty bucks richer, the Volkswagen belching on a good, healthy half tank. She\u2019d had half a ham and cheese sandwich, a pickle and some of the best potato salad she\u2019d ever eaten, thinking The guy\u2019s a genius with a boiled potato.</p><p>The roads all backed into the trees and most were in god-awful condition. Her little bug was bouncing and struggling, but hanging in there like the little champ she was. Marcie wished she could have found a way to get a Jeep or some other all-wheel-drive vehicle. If she could have waited longer to embark on this search, it might\u2019ve been possible to have saved enough for a down payment, but she couldn\u2019t wait that long. She took what little she\u2019d put aside for this exact purpose and planned her route. Despite what she\u2019d told Erin and Drew about being away for a couple of weeks, she\u2019d taken an unpaid leave of absence from her job until the first of the year. She had worked at the insurance company since Bobby went to Iraq\u2014five years ago\u2014and her boss had been understanding.</p><p>Erin had been completely against this wild notion that she had to find Ian from the very start. It took months of arguing to convince her there was some purpose for Marcie in this search. Then Erin had come up with a hundred better ideas that she\u2019d offered to take care of herself\u2014a people search, a private detective, anything but Marcie going after him alone. But there was a driving force in Marcie to see him, know him, talk to him, connect again, like she thought she had before.</p><p>Bobby\u2019s family wasn\u2019t much in favor of the idea either, but it didn\u2019t involve any ill will toward Ian\u2014they barely knew about him. Bobby had written Marcie about Ian all the time, but in his short letters to his family he\u2019d only mentioned him a few times. The Sullivans suggested that, if Ian hadn\u2019t been around while Bobby was in the nursing home, the bond was not as solid as Bobby thought. Then there was Ian\u2019s father\u2014one of the nastiest and most negative old men Marcie had ever met. He told her she was wasting her time; he had no interest in finding his only son. \u201cHe left without a word and never got in touch. That\u2019s enough message for me.\u201d</p><p>Through perseverance, Marcie learned that the elder Buchanan had not experienced good health in the past few years. He\u2019d had a mild stroke, was being treated for high blood pressure, prostate cancer, Parkinson\u2019s and, she suspected, a tish of dementia. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t you miss him?\u201d she asked. \u201cWonder what\u2019s become of him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot on your life,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s the one burned his bridges and run off.\u201d</p><p>But when he said that, there was wet in the folds under his old eyes and she thought: He can\u2019t give much more than this, but he would love to see his son once more, or at least know he was all right. Wouldn\u2019t he?</p> <p>Ian\u2019s former fianc\u00e9e, Shelly, was still angry about the way she\u2019d been abandoned, even though she\u2019d married someone else three years ago and was pregnant now with her first baby. She had not a kind or sympathetic word for the man who\u2019d run through sniper fire, taken injuries to save a comrade, won both a Bronze Star and Purple Heart. She pretty much hated Ian for the way he\u2019d dumped her and bolted. A thought came to Marcie\u2014if Shelly was happy with her life now, why would Ian\u2019s obvious troubles cause her such prolonged hate? Couldn\u2019t she see how war would shift his thinking, cause his emotional confusion? After having a life-limited husband for so long\u2014a hopeless invalid who couldn\u2019t even smile at her\u2014giving a little patience and understanding to a man who\u2019d been through a lot of trauma seemed a small thing.</p><p>But, Marcie had reminded herself, I don\u2019t know the weight of anyone else\u2019s burdens\u2014only my own. She didn\u2019t judge. She didn\u2019t feel smart or strong enough to judge.</p><p>It was beyond important to Marcie to look at Ian\u2019s face and ask him how he could save her beautiful young husband\u2019s life and then never respond to her letters.</p><p>Maybe Ian couldn\u2019t give her answers that would make everything feel settled for her, and to that end, she thought it made sense for them to talk about it. Talk it through. They called it \u201cclosure\u201d in the shrink club.</p><p>As she pulled up to a small, roughly hewn house, she caught sight of a man coming around the corner, his arms laden with firewood. He was clean shaven but stooped, his legs bowed with age, his head bald. He stopped walking when he saw her. She got out of her car, then went toward him. \u201cAfternoon, sir,\u201d she said.</p> <p>He put down the logs and the scowl on his face said he was suspicious of her.</p><p>\u201cI wonder if you might be able to help me. I\u2019m looking for someone.\u201d She pulled the photo out again. \u201cThis was taken about seven years ago, so he\u2019s obviously aged and I hear he\u2019s got a beard now, but the rumor is, he\u2019s living somewhere out in these hills. I\u2019m trying to find him. Thirty-five years old, big man\u2014I think he\u2019s over six feet.\u201d</p><p>The man took the photo in his bent, arthritic fingers. \u201cYou family?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cMore or less,\u201d she said. \u201cHe and my husband were good friends in the Marines. I should tell him, my husband passed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAin\u2019t seen him. Ain\u2019t seen no one looks like that, anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what if he was kind of gone to seed?\u201d she said. \u201cI mean, older, maybe heavier, bearded, maybe bald, maybe has a pot belly or is way too thin\u2014who knows?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe grow weed?\u201d the man asked, handing her back the picture.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she answered.</p><p>\u201cOnly folks I know around here about that age grow pot. And even if he\u2019s family, you might wanna cut him a wide berth. There\u2019s trouble around the growers sometimes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard that, yeah. Still\u2014you know anybody like that I should just have a look at? Just to rule them out? I\u2019ll be real careful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a guy up on the ridge, kind of hard to find. Could be twenty, could be fifty, but he\u2019s got a beard and he\u2019s good-sized. You\u2019d have to go back where you came, down 36 a mile or so and then up again. It\u2019s a dirt road, but halfway up the hill there\u2019s an iron gate. It ain\u2019t never been locked because you can\u2019t see the gate or the house from the main road. Only reason I know about it, is a guy I used to know lived up there in one room. Nice big room, though. He\u2019s been gone a couple years at least. Guy who lives there now was with him at the end.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow will I know what road?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cNo markers. It goes right and about a half mile up, you\u2019ll either come to a gate or turn around and try the next road.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want to come with me maybe? Show me where? And I\u2019ll bring you back?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNah,\u201d he said, shaking his head. \u201cI got no business with him. He\u2019s odd. Talks to hisself, whistles and sings before the sun\u2019s up. And he thinks he\u2019s a bear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHeard him roar like an animal when I was out near his place. You prob\u2019ly ought to just let him be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d she said, tucking her picture away. \u201cRight. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>And off she went, encouraged about another whack job who almost fit the description. It was hardly the first time; she\u2019d been to VA outreach, homeless shelters in Eureka, hospitals, the Gospel Mission. She\u2019d followed bums down alleys and country roads, traipsed around the forest, met up with ranch hands and lumberjacks. But it was never him; no one had heard of Ian Buchanan. All she\u2019d have to do was look into the eyes.</p><p>She\u2019d never forget his eyes. They were brown, same shade as his brown hair, except they had a ton of amber in them. She\u2019d seen them both soft and almost reverent, and then fierce and angry\u2014all in the space of fifteen minutes\u2014the one and only time he\u2019d come to see Bobby. Ian was on leave and Marcie had brought Bobby home to Chico to care for him while they waited on a facility that could take him. She watched as Ian ran his huge hand over Bobby\u2019s brow and head, murmuring, \u201cAw, buddy...Aw, buddy...\u201d Of course Bobby didn\u2019t respond; he had been unresponsive since the injury. Then, after a few moments of that, he turned almost-wild eyes on her and the gold in them flashed. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have let this happen to you. This is wrong, this is all wrong.\u201d</p><p>Ian\u2019s visit had come five months after Bobby was wounded in Fallujah and it lasted less than half an hour. She always thought he\u2019d be back, but that was it. She\u2019d never seen him since.</p><p>If he\u2019d read her letters, he would know that, soon after his one visit, they\u2019d moved Bobby into a nursing home. Over time, she felt Bobby had had some recognition\u2014there were times he\u2019d turn his head, seem to look at her, even move his head closer as if nuzzling her, then close his eyes as though he knew she was there, as though he could smell her, feel her. She might\u2019ve been the only one to think that way, but she believed that, somewhere inside that completely incapacitated body, he lived a little bit, knew he was with his wife and family, knew he was loved. Whether that was enough for a life, she didn\u2019t know. His family wanted the feeding tube pulled so that he\u2019d die, but she couldn\u2019t do that. Ultimately, she took peace in the fact that it wasn\u2019t up to her, she wasn\u2019t in charge. Her job was to stay with him, do her best to comfort and love him, make sure he had everything he needed. She wasn\u2019t a real religious person and she rarely went to church. She prayed when she was afraid or in trouble, and forgot when things were going all right. But beneath it all, she believed God would take Bobby home when it was his time. And what would be, would be.</p><p>What had been, had been.</p><p>It was her fourth little dirt road that finally presented a gate, and she sighed in audible relief because her little bug was churning, burning oil, straining over the bumps and up the steep grades. The gate wasn\u2019t closed and she pressed on further, praying it wasn\u2019t going to be far. And who knew how far it actually was? She was only going ten miles an hour. By the time she got close enough to spot a small house with an old pickup parked outside, it was growing late in the afternoon. This time of year, dark would descend before long.</p><p>Marcie was tired enough that she never gave a thought to what she would do if this turned out to be him; it had not been him so many times. She pulled right up to the house and gave the horn a toot, the country way of announcing yourself. Mountain people didn\u2019t have doorbells. They could be inside or out in the yard or woods or somewhere down by the stream. The only way they knew there was a visitor is if someone hollered, shot off a gun or blasted the horn. Poor little VeeDub didn\u2019t have a blast, but a pathetic bleep.</p><p>She got out and looked around. The house, a cabin really, had to be more than fifty years old. It looked as though it might have once been painted orange, a long, long time ago. The land around it was cleared of trees and there was a large stack of logs under a tarp near the house, but no corral or livestock or barn. No porch; the windows were small and high. There was a small chimney, an outhouse and a storage shed that might\u2019ve measured eight by ten. How does a person live out here like this, so far from humanity, so far from all conveniences?</p><p>She would go to the door in a minute, but she waited to see if the guy who lived here showed himself first. She should\u2019ve been all spooled up, hopeful. But hell, she\u2019d totally lied to Erin and Drew\u2014no one had sighted Ian and she\u2019d talked to dozens if not hundreds of people, in the towns, in the country, in the mountains. She was just plain tired and ready to eat the rest of that sandwich and more potato salad, hit a gas station bathroom and find a place to park for the night.</p><p>Then he came around the corner of his house with an ax in his hand. He was scary-big, his shoulders were very broad and his beard was bushy and reached inches below his chin. He wore a dirty tan jacket that was frayed at the hem and sleeves; some of the plaid lining was torn and hanging out. His boots had worked hard; his pants were patched on the knees. At first glance, she thought, damn, not Ian. The beard was burnished red, though the hair on his head was brown\u2014long and tied back into a ponytail\u2014and he had both eyebrows, so it couldn\u2019t be him. \u201cHi,\u201d she said. \u201cSorry, don\u2019t mean to bother you, but...\u201d</p><p>He took several long strides toward her, an angry scowl on his face. \u201cWhat the hell are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>She looked way up into those eyes and the amber came alive in them, on fire, glowing. Dear Jesus in heaven, it was him.</p><p>She took a step forward, stunned. \u201cIan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said, what the hell are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been...I was...I\u2019m looking for you. I\u2019m\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know who you are! Now you found me, so you can go away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait! Now I\u2019ve found you, we should talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut wait\u2014I want to tell you about Bobby. He\u2019s gone. He passed away. Almost a year ago now. I wrote you!\u201d</p><p>He pinched his eyes closed and stood perfectly still for a long moment, his arms stiff at his sides and fists balled. Pain. It was pain and grief she saw.</p><p>\u201cI wrote you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he said more softly. \u201cMessage delivered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Ian\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo home,\u201d he said. \u201cGet on with your life.\u201d Then he turned and walked into the little cabin and slammed the door.</p><p>For a moment, Marcie just stared at the cabin, at the closed door. Then she looked over the ridge to see the sun lowering. Then at her watch. It was only five o\u2019clock and she was standing at the top of a hill, so the descending sun was giving them a little more daylight on this December afternoon. If she were down the mountain, the tall trees combined with sunset would have already plunged her into near darkness.</p><p>She didn\u2019t relish having unfinished business between them after dark, but after all she\u2019d been through, she wasn\u2019t about to let him get away now. She took a few deep breaths, remembered that he was probably just troubled and not crazy, and stomped toward the house. She rapped on the door. Then she moved back a few steps to be safe.</p><p>The door jerked open and he glowered at her. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey! Why are you mad at me? I just want to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk,\u201d he said, pushing the door closed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>With inexplicable courage, she put her booted foot in its path. \u201cThen maybe you can listen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d he bellowed.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to scare me!\u201d she shouted at him.</p> <p>Then he roared like a wild animal. He bared his teeth, his eyes lit like there were gold flames in them, and the sound that came out of him was otherworldly.</p><p>She jumped back, her eyes as wide as hubcaps. \u201cOkay,\u201d she said, putting up her hands, palms toward him. \u201cMaybe you do scare me. A little.\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed to angry slits, and he slammed the door again.</p><p>She yelled at the closed door. \u201cBut I\u2019ve come too goddamn far and gone to too much goddamn trouble to be scared for long!\u201d She kicked the closed door as hard as she could, then yelped and hopped around from the pain in her toes.</p><p>It obviously had no effect on him. Marcie stood for a moment, staring at the closed door. She took a second to decide what to do next. She wasn\u2019t likely to turn tail and run just because he roared\u2014the big bully\u2014but then again, she wouldn\u2019t confront him right away. Apparently he needed a little time to calm down\u2014and to realize she wasn\u2019t giving up. So she decided her best course of action was to wait. And eat.</p> <p>She went to the little bug and got the rest of Preacher\u2019s lunch out of her portable refrigerator\u2014the trunk. Then she got into the backseat, pushing the front seats up as far as they\u2019d go, and spread out her sleeping bag to sit on. It was like a little nest; she settled in. And she thought about his glower and his roar, as she slowly opened up the bag and took out the second half of her sandwich.</p><p>All right, she thought\u2014it was not supposed to go like this. In every fantasy she\u2019d had about finding him, there had been many possibilities. He could be glad to see her, embracing her in welcome. Or he could be withdrawn. He could even be a raving lunatic, on another planet, totally out of touch with this world. But never had she imagined he would take one look at her, cringe in obvious despair at the news of Bobby\u2019s death and cruelly, heartlessly, meanly, scream at her to go away.</p><p>Her mouth was a little dry for eating and she tried some of the water out of her thermos\u2014bottled water had become too expensive. She kept an eye on the front door of the cabin. She could feel the heat on her cheeks, furious that he\u2019d do that to her after she\u2019d looked so hard for him. All she wanted in the world was to make sure he was all right. The asshole. And then she felt her eyes cloud with tears for the very same reasons. His reaction really hurt her. What had she ever done to him? It made her absolutely enraged and broke her heart at the same time. How could he do that? Roar at her and slam the door like that? Without even hearing her? All he had to do was invite her in, tell her he was just fine, explain he wanted to be alone, accept the baseball cards and...</p><p>She just let the tears roll soundlessly down her cheeks for a moment. It had been a while since she\u2019d cried. She realized then that her hopes for how this would turn out had been too idealized\u2014exactly the reason Erin had wanted to hire a professional to handle this. Ian Buchanan had gone away, because he didn\u2019t want anything to do with anyone from his former life, not because he needed help. Especially her help.</p><p>With a hiccup of emotion, Marcie admitted to herself\u2014she might need his help. This business of moving on, it might have to do with Ian helping her understand his relationship with Bobby and with her, and how everything had changed. Ian\u2019s growling and slamming the door in her face wasn\u2019t going to get her where she needed to go. She was going to have to sit it out until he understood\u2014she wasn\u2019t done with him yet. And this whole business was going to get complicated, since there were good odds he was actually nuts.</p><p>She tried to gnaw at her sandwich, even though she now had no appetite. The sun sank slowly, and she ended up wrapping it up and putting it back in the grocery sack, unfinished. The thing was\u2014if you didn\u2019t eat that much, you didn\u2019t feel like eating that much.</p> <p>The sun dipped below the horizon, the lights in the cabin shone, and a thin curl of smoke rose from the little chimney. She leaned back against the sleeping bag, physically comfortable even if she was an emotional wreck. But the decision had been made\u2014she was sitting right here until she figured out what to do.</p><p>On a more practical matter, she really hoped she wouldn\u2019t have to pee in the night. She\u2019d been choosing her sleeping spots carefully, so that if nature called in the dark of night, she wouldn\u2019t have to venture far from the little bug.</p><p>She\u2019d never been any kind of camper, never had been good at relieving a full bladder on a whim. Never had quite figured out that squat; it seemed like she\u2019d always wet her right foot. But after a little over a month of searching the hills and sleeping in her car in various parking lots, quiet residential streets, rest stops and country roads, she had it figured out. She could squat, whizz, get the job done, jump back in the car and lock the doors in just over a minute. There were showers available at the YWCA and at workout rooms in community colleges where they didn\u2019t check ID\u2019s too closely. She\u2019d indulged in motels the first week out and then quickly realized her money would go further if she slept in her car. And with no hints of Ian\u2019s whereabouts, she needed to make her money last.</p><p>Then she remembered\u2014that was an outhouse out there, wasn\u2019t it? Wow, how hilarious to think she\u2019d be glad to see an outhouse! Life had gotten real interesting.</p><p>Drew and especially Erin would absolutely die if they found out she\u2019d been sleeping in the bug. She shook her head. I\u2019m as nuts as he is, for sure. And then she noticed snow flurries against the window of the bug. Very pretty, light, fluffy snowflakes in the waning light with a narrow streak of sunlight in the west through the clouds\u2014the flakes glittered as they fell. The view over the ridge was amazing\u2014there was a rainbow shining through the snow drifting down onto the tall pines\u2014it was magnificent. She just couldn\u2019t be upset in this place. Not with Ian, in any case. Maybe he had forgotten they were friends.</p><p>He probably wanted her to think he was crazy, roaring like that, but she wanted to believe that, underneath the bluster, he would still be all the things Bobby said he was, all the things he\u2019d been in their early letters, before Ian got out of the Marines\u2014strong, compassionate, gentle, loyal. Brave. He\u2019d been so courageous to do what he had done.</p><p>With the snow lightly falling, and the sun causing the rainbow to fade into dusk, she relaxed and closed her eyes for just a second. To think.</p><p>Three</p> <p>I an tried to keep himself from looking out the window; he\u2019d be damned if he\u2019d open the door. The silence in the mountains was such that if she\u2019d turned the ignition to start the car, he could have heard the click. So he refreshed the fire in the woodstove, fired up the propane cookstove and heated large pans of water for a bath.</p><p>He\u2019d made it a year in this cabin without a tub, shower or electricity, but he had made a few adjustments; he bought a generator and wired up a couple of lights inside. He found an old clawfoot tub in a salvage yard that he\u2019d repaired and patched, enabling him to wash out of something larger than the kitchen sink.</p><p>It was always a shallow bath\u2014a couple of pans of cold water hand pumped into a pot in the sink from the spring-fed well under the house, and a couple of large pans of boiling water didn\u2019t make for a nice long soak. In the winter, he got in, got clean and got out real quick. He would probably never have plumbing other than the pump; he worried about money and he wasn\u2019t skilled enough to do the plumbing himself. He hadn\u2019t had a real honest-to-God shower in years. But he was a guy\u2014he didn\u2019t exactly primp. This was all he really needed. It got him good and clean.</p><p>After a quick scrub and some clean clothes, he warmed some stew on the stove, leaving it right in the can with the paper ripped off the outside. He wanted to see where she was, what she was doing, but he wouldn\u2019t let himself. He\u2019d ignore her, refuse to talk to her, and she\u2019d go away. Soon, he hoped.</p><p>After all this time, Ian had managed not to dwell on everything that came before the mountains, but one look at that fiery red mane and her flashing green eyes brought everything rushing back. The first time he\u2019d seen that beautiful little face had been in a photo that Bobby carried with him.</p><p>That kid was something else. Ian had been twenty-eight and Bobby twenty with a couple of years in the Marines when they first met. Bobby already had himself some stripes. Ian was just getting a new command and he took to the kid immediately\u2014he was funny and fearless. Big, like Ian\u2014about six feet of hard body\u2014and no attitude. At first, Ian just worked him to death, but found himself responding right away to Bobby\u2019s incredible endurance and commitment. It didn\u2019t take long before Ian was mentoring him; teaching him and building him into one of the best of the best. Also, he was having a beer with him now and then and talking about home, about things that were not military\u2014sports, music, cars and hunting. And then they went to Iraq together.</p><p>They got out pictures of their girls and read the letters they got to each other, sometimes leaving out the more personal parts, sometimes not. Bobby had married his girl, but Ian had been engaged less than a year when they went to Iraq in the same unit.</p><p>Ian had Shelly back then. While he was gone, she was planning a wedding that would take place when he got back. Bobby and Marcie were hoping to start a family. Their women were beautiful\u2014Marcie was small and fragile-looking with that great mass of curly red hair and a completely impish smile. Shelly was a tall, thin, sophisticated-looking blonde with long straight hair. Ian remembered that Marcie had sent Bobby a pair of her panties that he proudly showed to the guys, but no one was allowed to touch. Shelly sent Ian a lock of hair, but he\u2019d have rather had panties. Marcie sent Bobby a picture of herself in her underwear on Bobby\u2019s motorcycle; Shelly sent a picture of herself posed in front of a Christmas tree, wearing slacks and a turtleneck sweater. Their girls also sent them cookies, books, cards, socks and tapes, anything they could think of. When the flak jackets ran low and soldiers started buying their own, Marcie and Shelly sent their men armor as well.</p><p>He didn\u2019t want to think about this. Couldn\u2019t she understand that? He didn\u2019t want to be haunted by it. He absolutely couldn\u2019t talk about it. He sat at his small table, head in his hands, but the memories assaulted him nonetheless.</p><p>There was no such thing as a routine mission in Fallujah. Ian\u2019s squad hadn\u2019t seen much action, but that day they hung tight against buildings while they did their door-to-door search for insurgents. The street was nearly deserted; a couple of women stood in doorways, watching them warily. Then it hit fast and hard. There were a couple of sudden explosions\u2014a car bomb and grenade\u2014and then a breakout of sniper fire. Ian saw one of his marines fly through the air, catapulted by the explosion. The second the noise subsided a little, Ian saw that it was Bobby who was down. He quickly assessed the rest of his squad; they\u2019d taken cover and were returning fire. Bobby, however, got a double whammy\u2014he\u2019d been thrown probably twenty feet by the force of the explosion and by the time Ian got to him, there\u2019d been a couple of gunshot wounds as well\u2014head and torso.</p><p>Bobby looked up at him and said in a hoarse whisper, \u201cTake cover, Sarge.\u201d</p><p>And Ian had replied, \u201cFuck off. I\u2019m getting you outta here.\u201d Ian scooped him up, and right that second, he knew how bad it was going to turn out. He knew that fast. Bobby was limp as a hundred and eighty pound bag of sand. Carrying him over his shoulder, Ian got him behind the wall of a decimated building, called for a medic, an EMT who could administer battlefield first-aid. Ian put his hand over Bobby\u2019s head wound in an attempt to stanch the bleeding and waited for help.</p><p>The medic who traveled with their squad finally came and opened up Bobby\u2019s BDUs, the desert camouflage battle dress. He rolled him carefully. \u201cIt\u2019s through and through,\u201d he said of the torso wound, applying a compress to stop the bleeding. \u201cWe won\u2019t know how much damage till we get a closer look. His vitals are hanging in there.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s gonna make it,\u201d Ian said, though Bobby was out cold.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not going anywhere fast,\u201d the medic said, getting out his gauze and tape to close up the head wound. \u201cWe can\u2019t get a chopper in this close. We\u2019ll have to carry the wounded or use litters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust keep him going till we get transport,\u201d Ian demanded. But the medic was called to another wounded marine and Ian knew it was down to him to do everything he could to keep Bobby alive, to get him to that helicopter. Bobby was unconscious and barely breathing.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t that long, but it seemed a lifetime, before the medic\u2019s radio alerted them to a helicopter a few blocks away in a safe zone. Ian knew in his gut that Bobby wasn\u2019t getting out of this okay, but he refused to think about it. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be okay, buddy,\u201d he kept saying. \u201cYou stay with me, I\u2019ll get you outta here.\u201d</p><p>The minute sniper fire seemed to have abated, Ian hefted Bobby into his arms and began to run down the dusty, bullet-riddled streets of Fallujah toward the chopper and the paramedics who had better equipment than what was available in the field. He took sniper fire in the thigh, but it was muscle not bone, and he ran through the pain. He took another one across the face, but he still couldn\u2019t feel the pain. He felt the fire on his cheek. Then he saw the corner of the building on the other side of which would be medical transport.</p><p>He got Bobby to the chopper, where the rescue crew took over. He tried to go back to his squad, when one of the medics snagged his sleeve and said, \u201cHold up there, Sarge. Let\u2019s have a look.\u201d</p><p>Ian looked down. He was covered with blood. He couldn\u2019t tell his from Bobby\u2019s. Right then, his leg throbbed and his face burned; his vision blurred from blood running into his eye.</p><p>\u201cWhoa, Sarge\u2014you\u2019re not going anywhere. We gotta look at\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTake care of him,\u201d Ian said sternly. \u201cI\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone\u2019s getting taken care of, Sarge,\u201d the medic said, taking the scissors to his pants, cutting them up to his thigh to expose a bleeding hole.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Ian said. \u201cDamn.\u201d And he swayed a little.</p><p>He sat while the medic attended to his face wounds\u2014a cut across his eyebrow and a flesh wound that ran down the length of his check. While this was going on, while they were waiting for a couple more wounded marines, Ian watched as they worked on Bobby.</p><p>One of the medics said, \u201cNo casualties today.\u201d</p><p>Little did they know...</p> <p>The chopper finally lifted off and headed for the nearest camp hospital. There was a full surgical setup in tents and hastily erected buildings. That\u2019s where Ian was separated from Bobby. Ian was taken into a treatment area while Bobby went straight to surgery. Some young doctor had shaved off Ian\u2019s eyebrow to get a nice, clean stitch on the laceration; the nurse informed him it might never grow back. By the time Ian had a bandage and some crutches, Bobby had been stabilized and airlifted to Germany.</p><p>Ian stayed in Iraq. His injuries left some ugly scars but his recovery was relatively short. While Ian was behind the action for two months, he wrote letters to Bobby\u2019s wife, letters telling her he was sure Bobby would be fine. Marcie went immediately to Germany and wrote back to Ian. Then she followed Bobby to Washington D.C.\u2014to the Walter Reed Medical Center, and they wrote some more.</p><p>While Ian went back into action, Bobby went from Germany to Walter Reed to a VA hospital in Texas, then home to his wife. Ian kept up the correspondence\u2014he heard from Marcie all the time and answered her every letter. She said things like, \u201cHe\u2019s still pretty much unresponsive, but they\u2019re working with him in physical therapy,\u201d and \u201cHe\u2019s not on a respirator or anything,\u201d and, \u201cI swear, Ian, he smiled at me today.\u201d She said there was some paralysis and they feared brain damage, not from the bullet wound but from brain swelling. \u201cFeared,\u201d she had written. And \u201csome paralysis.\u201d</p><p>It was a few months later when she wrote to Ian again, \u201cWe have to face it\u2014he\u2019s not going to recover. He\u2019s paralyzed from the neck down and he\u2019s conscious but unresponsive.\u201d The news hit Ian in the gut like a torpedo. He reread the previous letters; there wasn\u2019t a hint of doom, yet the facts were there. A combination of his denial and her hope had kept the inevitable bad news at bay.</p><p>And then Marcie wrote, \u201cI\u2019m so relieved to have him home.\u201d</p><p>Ian was given medals for saving Bobby\u2019s life. Every day he asked himself why he should get medals for that, for saving a man to live in a dead body.</p><p>Since Ian had the basic information about his friend, he thought he was prepared for the visit he would pay when he was next stateside on leave. Marcie was so excited to see him, to throw her arms around him and thank him. He wasn\u2019t sure what he had expected, but it sure as hell hadn\u2019t been what he\u2019d seen. Just from earlier photos, he could tell Marcie had become thinner and more pale, even more fragile-looking. She was so tiny, so frail.</p><p>And Bobby? The man he\u2019d seen did not resemble his friend. This man was a wasted, emaciated version of Bobby\u2014his musculature gone, staring off at nothing, being fed through a tube, not responding to his young wife or his best friend. Bobby was gone, completely gone, yet his heart pumped and his lungs spontaneously filled with air. It was a travesty. And Ian had accepted medals for that?</p> <p>Ian opened his eyes and they felt gritty. Sandy. He\u2019d been literally transported to the past, a thing he\u2019d been running from for years. He\u2019d never been entirely sure if what happened next was due to the whole Iraq experience, or to the events that changed Bobby\u2019s life so irrevocably. Whatever it was, it came to an ugly end when he got back from Iraq, a mess, his head all screwed up. He\u2019d visited Bobby for probably less than fifteen minutes and it devastated him to see what he\u2019d done\u2014saving Bobby to live a life like that. He called off his wedding, tearing Shelly to shreds. He reported back for duty, not the same stalwart man, but a wreck who was impossibly short tempered. There was a phone call from Marcie\u2019s sister saying it would be nice if Ian could at least be in touch with her\u2014she was up against so much with Bobby, which added guilt to his growing list of demons.</p><p>Ian suddenly couldn\u2019t stay out of trouble. Rather than being an example, he was a problem. He ended up spending a couple of nights in jail for stupid, random fights, and his father told him he was never so goddamned ashamed of him in his life. Ian\u2019s response to that was to screw up enough so the Corps suggested it was time for him to exit and see if he\u2019d be better as a civilian. He couldn\u2019t face any of it. He had let Bobby down, disgraced his father, shattered and abandoned his woman. And he hadn\u2019t been there for Marcie, who deserved better from him. He just wandered off, trying to figure out his head, but the task proved to be impossible.</p><p>He didn\u2019t want to see Marcie now. He didn\u2019t want to relive all that. There was no way he could apologize enough, no way to undo what he\u2019d done. She should go away, let him figure out how to coexist alone with his monsters, someplace where he wouldn\u2019t do any harm. He\u2019d found some contentment here; there was nothing to be gained by going over the details again. God knew, he\u2019d been over the details too many times, often without meaning to.</p><p>He had such horrible guilt. If Bobby was condemned to wasted life, why should he just pick up where he left off and thrive? Couldn\u2019t, he couldn\u2019t. But he could avoid hearing all the details of the traumatic last few years.</p><p>He looked at his watch. It was ten o\u2019clock and he had to pee. He\u2019d been in some flashback for more than a couple of hours. He seriously considered using the small pot he kept for emergencies, but it was time to see if she\u2019d gone while he was in that other world.</p><p>He put on his jacket to take a trip out back, hoping beyond hope that when he opened the door, that little Volkswagen would be gone.</p><p>But damn, it was right there\u2014covered with a thin layer of snow. It made him furious and he let out a loud, scary roar. But there was no response from within the car. He banged on the window. \u201cHey! You! Get outta here! Just go home!\u201d Still, there was nothing from inside. He put his big hands on the top of the little car and began to rock it, shake it. When it settled, there was no movement, no sound.</p><p>Shit, he thought. It\u2019s freezing. She wouldn\u2019t fall asleep in there while the temperature dropped and the little car was covered with snow? No one would be that stupid. He pulled open the passenger door. She was gone.</p><p>\u201cGoddamn it!\u201d he cursed, turning around in a circle. \u201cGoddamn you, Marcie! Where the hell are you?\u201d</p><p>The night was silent. The snow drifted lazily to the ground. Then he heard the vague squeak of hinges and he looked across the dark. The outhouse door was open, drifting in the gentle breeze.</p><p>Dread colder than the winter sky filled him, and he ran to the little hut. She was slumped in the open doorway, her upper body inside and her legs covered with snow. Holy Jesus, she\u2019d been like that long enough to have a dusting of snow on her legs.</p><p>He didn\u2019t even think\u2014he lifted her into his arms quickly and put his lips against her forehead to judge her body temperature. She was cold as ice. He ran to the cabin with her in his arms, conscious of the fact that she wasn\u2019t stiff, wasn\u2019t frozen solid, and he did something he hadn\u2019t done in so long\u2014he prayed. Oh God, I didn\u2019t mean to roar like that\u2014I just thought it best for both of us if she went away! Please, let her be okay! I\u2019ll do anything...anything... When he got her inside, he put her on the couch, then rushed to put a couple more logs into the woodstove.</p><p>Then he hurried back to her and checked for a pulse. She was still okay, though hypothermic enough to induce unconsciousness. He knew what he had to do and started getting her out of her cold, wet clothes. First the quilted vest, then the boots and jeans. At least they\u2019d been thick denim jeans and solid leather boots; it might\u2019ve saved her from frostbite. She flopped weakly as he pulled her sweater over her head. Then he threw off his own jacket, ripped off his shirt, tore off his boots and shed his pants. He covered her small body with his and warmed her, skin to skin, holding himself up so as not to crush her with his weight.</p><p>He turned her face so that it lay gently against his shoulder. After minutes passed, he could feel the chill leaving her body. His arms trembled from holding his nearly two hundred pounds off her, keeping flesh on flesh, and the strangest image came back to him. Drop and give me twenty! And twenty! And twenty! God, how many push-ups had he given, then demanded....</p><p>He warmed her for an hour, while at the same time, the woodstove heated up the cabin. Her breath was soft and even on his shoulder; her body still and warm to the touch. He stayed over her a bit longer than necessary. Somewhat reluctant, he pushed himself off her, then wrapped her in a soft old quilt that lay at the foot of the couch.</p><p>Dressed again, he fed the woodstove and put a kettle of water on the cookstove.</p><p>Inside his one-room house was a couch, a table and two chairs, the clawfoot tub, the woodstove and a Coleman cookstove that ran on propane gas on the counter by the sink. There was a thick, rolled pallet he slept on and a stack of dry wood beside the woodstove. He had a few cupboards and a sink with a pump. There were two large trunks and a small metal box in which he kept his possessions and few valuables. Leaning in the corners were fishing gear and two rifles of the caliber to hunt game on the land that had become his. He had a stack of six books from the library; every two weeks he went to the public library using the card that had belonged to old Raleigh, the man who had lived here before him and died here, leaving a letter saying Ian could have the property.</p><p>He checked Marcie again. She was all right, sleeping soundly. So he took his trip to the outhouse and he made it real fast.</p><p>Ordinarily he\u2019d be asleep long before now, there being little else to do. But instead, he sat in a chair at the table and opened the book he was currently reading. When the kettle whistled, he turned off the flame and checked on her. She was warmer and breathing regularly, so he read a while longer. Then he recharged the kettle, checked her again and found her the same. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>That hair...It was everywhere on the couch pillow, thick and springy. If he didn\u2019t have so much beard of his own, he could have enjoyed the feel of it against his face. He bunched some of it up in his hand and it was soft and thick. He couldn\u2019t help but think of that girl, all of twenty-three and already a wife of four years, tending to a man who was nothing but flesh and bone. God, what kind of life must that have been?</p><p>Several more times, he reheated the water for hot tea, read, checked her. And then he heard a snuffling on the couch. A dry cough. He looked at his watch\u2014a ten-dollar thing that had run for four years\u2014and saw it was almost four o\u2019clock. He went and knelt beside the couch. \u201cYou gonna wake up?\u201d</p><p>She lazily opened her eyes and jolted awake, scooting up on her elbows. \u201cWhat? What?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEasy. It\u2019s okay. Sort of.\u201d</p><p>She blinked a few times and then her eyes were wide. \u201cWhere am I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI brought you inside. I had to. You were on your way to freezing to death. You must not have a brain in your head.\u201d</p><p>She squinted at him, pursing her lips. \u201cOh\u2014I have a brain. I\u2019m just not real experienced in mountain life.\u201d She struggled to sit up. \u201cGee, if I\u2019d known you got your eyebrow back and grew your beard in red, I might\u2019ve found you sooner. I\u2019ll get out of your hair, which I notice, you have plenty of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going anywhere,\u201d he said, putting a big hand against her sternum, holding her down. \u201cYou\u2019re stuck\u2014and so am I.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo problem,\u201d she said. \u201cI sleep in the car every night. I have a good sleeping bag...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you hear me? You were passed out on your way back from the john, covered with snow and damn near frozen to death. You wanted to see me, you\u2019re going to get your wish.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened suddenly. \u201cI\u2019m...ah...naked under here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not naked. You have underwear. I had to get your wet clothes off you. That or just let you die. It wasn\u2019t an easy decision,\u201d he lied.</p><p>\u201cYou undressed me and wrapped me in this quilt?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cPretty much,\u201d he said. And felt your small, soft body against mine for an hour, the first female body that\u2019s been against mine in five years. Until tonight, he hadn\u2019t thought he missed that feeling. \u201cWhat happened out there? How\u2019d you end up in the doorway of the john like that?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t have the first idea. I was so glad there was an outhouse for once and I wouldn\u2019t have to squat behind a bush. I was going to make it quick, but I was so tired I could hardly move, and that\u2019s the last thing I remember till I woke up.\u201d She coughed. \u201cI didn\u2019t think I was so tired I\u2019d fall asleep on the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t fall asleep,\u201d he said. \u201cYou lost consciousness. Hypothermia. Like I said\u2014half frozen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm. Well, I have to pee now,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m feeling really, really hot in here.\u201d</p><p>So, she\u2019d been half-frozen before she made the trek out of her VW. He stared at her for a minute, then went over by the stove where he had her wet clothes draped over one of his two chairs to dry out. He felt them, then he went to one of the two trunks, opened it and pulled out a flannel shirt of his own. He took it to her and said, \u201cHere, just put this on.\u201d Next he reached behind the woodstove and picked up a navy blue porcelain pot with white dots that was probably fifty years old if it was a day. When he turned back to her, she was sitting up and buttoning the flannel shirt. \u201cUse this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo pee in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d she said. \u201cMaybe, if you\u2019ll give me my jeans and boots, I\u2019ll just step outside...\u201d Then she coughed again, several times.</p><p>\u201cNo, you can\u2019t do that. And you better not get sick. I don\u2019t have time to deal with a sick person.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not sick, just a little dry in the throat. I could use a drink of water, but not until I take a trip out to the\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s be clear,\u201d Ian said gruffly. \u201cI\u2019m not letting you back outside. Not for a few more hours at least.\u201d The kettle whistled. He shut off the propane stove and shrugged into his jacket. \u201cI\u2019ll step outside. You do your thing. Then you\u2019ll have a cup of tea and go back to sleep.\u201d</p><p>She just stared up at him with eyes that were dull green and very wide. She wiggled a little in discomfort. \u201cDo you have any...tissue?\u201d</p><p>He sighed deeply, letting his eyes fall closed impatiently. After handing her the pot, he went to one of his cupboards and pulled out a new roll of toilet tissue. Then he went out the door, hoping it wouldn\u2019t take her very long to do her business. He shivered out there for five minutes and then he tentatively knocked on his own front door. He was answered by a round of hard coughing and he didn\u2019t wait for further invitation.</p><p>She was leaning back on the couch looking flushed, her skinny bare legs sticking out from beneath the huge shirt, holding the pan possessively on her lap. She looked up at him and said, \u201cWhat should I do with this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take care of it,\u201d he said. She didn\u2019t move. \u201cLet me have it now.\u201d Reluctantly, she gave it up. \u201cI\u2019ll be right back.\u201d And again he left her, this time to pour the contents down the outhouse hole. And as he was returning he thought, she\u2019s sick. No question about it. She\u2019s been sleeping in her damn car\u2014who knew for how long?\u2014and got weakened. She must have had a bug in her that was ready to strike, and that bad chill just added to her troubles.</p><p>He said nothing as he came in the cabin. He put the pot back behind the stove for her use if she needed it. He washed his hands, made her a cup of tea, and while it steeped, he poured a cup of water and brought her three aspirins.</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d she said. \u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you have a fever. Might be from damn near freezing to death, might be from something else. First we try aspirin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she said, taking them in her small hand. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>While Marcie took the aspirin with water, he fixed up the tea. They traded, water cup for mug of tea. He stayed across the room at his table while she sipped the tea. When she was almost done, he said, \u201cOkay, here\u2019s the deal. I have to work this morning. I\u2019ll be gone till noon or so\u2014depends how long it takes. When I get back, you\u2019re going to be here. After we\u2019re sure you\u2019re not sick, then you\u2019ll go. But not till I tell you it\u2019s time to go. I want you to sleep. Rest. Use the pot, don\u2019t go outside. I don\u2019t want to stretch this out. And I don\u2019t want to have to go looking for you to make sure you\u2019re all right. You understand?\u201d</p><p>She smiled, though weakly. \u201cAw, Ian, you care.\u201d</p><p>He snarled at her, baring his teeth like an animal.</p><p>She laughed a little, which turned into a cough. \u201cYou get a lot of mileage out of that? The roars and growls, like you\u2019re about to tear a person to pieces with your teeth?\u201d</p><p>He looked away.</p><p>\u201cMust keep people back pretty good. Your old neighbor said you were crazy. You howl at the moon and everything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about you don\u2019t press your luck,\u201d he said as meanly as he could. \u201cYou need more tea?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s all the same to you, I think I\u2019ll nap. I don\u2019t want to be any trouble, but I\u2019m awful tired.\u201d</p><p>He went to her and took the cup out of her hand. \u201cIf you didn\u2019t want to be any trouble, why didn\u2019t you just leave me the hell alone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGee, I just had this wild urge to find an old friend...\u201d She lay back on the couch, pulling that soft quilt around her. \u201cWhat kind of work do you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI sell firewood out of the back of my truck.\u201d He went to his metal box, which was nailed to the floor from the inside so it couldn\u2019t be stolen if someone happened by his cabin, which was unlikely. He unlocked it and took out a roll of bills he kept in there and put it in his pocket, then relocked it. \u201cFirst snowfall of winter\u2014should be a good day. Maybe I\u2019ll get back early, but no matter what, I want you here until I say you go. You get that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen, if I\u2019m here, it\u2019s because it\u2019s where I want to be, and you better get that. I\u2019m the one who came looking for you, so don\u2019t get the idea you\u2019re going to bully me around and scare me. If I wasn\u2019t so damn tired, I might leave\u2014just to piss you off. But I get the idea you like being pissed off.\u201d</p><p>He stood and got into his jacket, pulled gloves out of the pockets. \u201cI guess we understand each other as well as we can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait\u2014it\u2019s not even light!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI start before light. I have to load the truck.\u201d</p><p>And he was gone.</p><p>Marcie reclined on the couch and closed her eyes. At first she heard the heavy thumping of logs being stacked in the back of the truck. Then she heard some soft whistling while she dozed off. Very pretty whistling with a distinct melody. She wasn\u2019t sure what woke her, but when she opened her eyes the cabin was dimly lit with the first rays of dawn and she heard...singing. A beautiful male baritone. She couldn\u2019t hear the words, but it was him and it took her breath away.</p><p>And she knew something. If you\u2019re angry and in pain, you can\u2019t sing. Can\u2019t.</p><p>Four</p><p>S now didn\u2019t fall all the way into the valley, down near the ocean towns of Eureka and Arcata. But up here it was overcast, damp and chilly, and more snow was forecast. Ian had his truck parked along the road leading to a busy thoroughfare just before seven o\u2019clock. At that juncture, he caught people on their way to work and, after four years, he was selling to the same customers over and over. Since he didn\u2019t have a phone and no one knew where he lived, they watched for him to show up. Five cars right in a row pulled up and he made deals for as many half cords of wood. He took addresses in his little notebook and promised to deliver the wood in the next couple of days. Two of them he\u2019d done business with in the past and accepted their checks, but the other three would have their wives give him the cash upon delivery.</p><p>The sixth customer was the police chief. He bought a cord from Ian every winter and must trust him by now because he paid cash in advance of delivery; other customers liked to see the wood before they shelled out the money for the delivery. \u201cGot a good supply this winter, buddy?\u201d the chief asked, pulling off his bills.</p><p>\u201cYes, sir. We\u2019ll get you through. I\u2019ll take this load right over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you stack it up in the shed out back and put a little on the porch by the mudroom door for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou betcha. As usual,\u201d Ian said, taking the money.</p><p>\u201cYou take care now,\u201d the chief said. \u201cListen...There was this woman looking for a guy about your size, age...Aw, never mind...\u201d</p><p>Ian smiled inwardly. No, chief, couldn\u2019t be me, he thought. \u201cI\u2019ll get that wood over this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, buddy.\u201d</p><p>Twenty minutes later, a truck pulled up and Ian took his last order for wood, then was on his way to deliver his load to the chief. He made a stop for gas and a few supplies\u2014broth cubes, half a roaster, an onion, some celery, a bag of frozen mixed vegetables, noodles, couple of small orange juices plus some fresh apples and oranges, coffee, bread, peanut butter and honey. He was back at the cabin before noon.</p><p>The room had chilled down because the stove hadn\u2019t been fed, but she\u2019d kicked off her covers and her little rump was sticking out\u2014lavender and lace. Her face was glowing pink. He put down his groceries and fed the stove. Then he took her juice and more aspirin, waking her. He pulled the quilt over her and made her sit up.</p><p>\u201cWhen are you leaving?\u201d she asked him groggily.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m back. Here, you have to take aspirin. You have a fever. Where are you sick, Marcie? Head, stomach, throat, chest? Where?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cUgh. I don\u2019t know,\u201d she said, struggling awake. \u201cI think I\u2019m just tired and achy. I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJuice and aspirin,\u201d he said, lifting her. \u201cCome on now. You got a bug.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUgh,\u201d she said again, lifting up. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019ll be better in a little while. It\u2019s probably just a little cold or something.\u201d She took the aspirin\u2014four this time\u2014and washed it down with orange juice.</p> <p>\u201cI have to go out again, Marcie. There\u2019s more juice on the table. You need that blue pot closer to the couch while I\u2019m gone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, settling back against the couch. \u201cI don\u2019t like that pot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to go see if I can get you some medicine. There\u2019s an old doc in Virgin River\u2014he might have some stuff on hand for cold and flu. It\u2019ll take me almost a half hour to get there, the same coming back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVirgin River,\u201d she said dreamily, eyes closed. \u201cIan, they have the most beautiful Christmas tree...You should see it...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, right. I\u2019ll be an hour or so. The fire should more than last, but will you try to keep the blanket on? Till I get back?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m just too warm for it...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t be in a half hour, when that aspirin kicks in and drops your temperature. Can you just do this for me?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes fluttered open. \u201cI bet you\u2019re really pissed at me right now, huh? I just wanted to find you, not make so much trouble for you.\u201d</p><p>He brushed that wild red hair off her brow where a couple of curly red tendrils stuck to the dampness on her face. \u201cI\u2019m not pissed anymore, Marcie,\u201d he said softly. \u201cWhen you\u2019re all over this flu, I\u2019ll give you what for. How\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever. You can howl at me with that big, mean animal roar if you want to. I have a feeling you like doing that.\u201d</p><p>He grinned in spite of himself. \u201cI do,\u201d he said. \u201cI do like it.\u201d Then he stood and said, \u201cStay covered and I\u2019ll get back as soon as I can.\u201d</p> <p>When Ian pulled into town, the first thing he saw was the tree. Somehow he thought she might\u2019ve been hallucinating from the fever, which had scared the hell out of him. But there it was\u2014biggest damn thing he\u2019d ever seen. The bottom third was decorated with red-white-and-blue balls, gold stars and some other stuff; the top part was still bare. He actually slowed the truck for a moment, taking it in. But what was that patriotic color scheme about? Did they do this every winter? Did they have some town kids in the war?</p><p>He shook it off; he had to get something for Marcie. The old doc used to come out to his place when old Raleigh was at the end and real sick, years ago now. Ian had to use Raleigh\u2019s ancient truck to fetch the doctor; Raleigh had never even considered a phone. And neither had Ian.</p><p>When he walked into the doc\u2019s house, he saw a young blonde at the desk. \u201cHi, there,\u201d she said. She stood up and he noted the pregnant tummy.</p><p>\u201cHey. Doc around?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. I\u2019ll get him for you. I\u2019ve been here less than two years\u2014does he know you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSort of, yeah.\u201d</p><p>She smiled over her shoulder and went to Doc\u2019s office. Momentarily, the old man was limping toward him, glasses perched on his nose, wild white eyebrows spiking. \u201cAfternoon,\u201d Doc said.</p><p>\u201cHey, Doc,\u201d Ian said, putting out a hand. \u201cAny chance you have anything on hand for a flu bug?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSorry, son\u2014I can\u2019t remember the name. The face I know. You\u2019re...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBuchanan. Ian Buchanan from out on Clint Mountain. The old Raleigh place. I was the one taking care of him at the end.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s right. What\u2019s your complaint?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not me, Doc. I\u2019ve got a visitor who showed up yesterday and she took sick in the night. Fever, chills, aches, sore throat...I\u2019m giving her aspirin and juice. I didn\u2019t want to bring her out in this cold\u2014the heater in the truck isn\u2019t too good. But if you have any medicine\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m chock full of medicine, boy\u2014but I usually like to make my own diagnosis.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s way out there\u2014You remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah, can\u2019t hardly forget that old coot. No problem\u2014I get around. Let me stock up a bag and I\u2019ll follow you back. Most roads out that way are a goddamn mystery.\u201d</p><p>Ian felt the roll of bills in his pocket shrink. He was ahead for the winter, but if he ended up needing a lot of diesel fuel and propane through the cold months, he wouldn\u2019t stay that way for long. Then in the spring, the tax bill would come on the property. Summers were easy; they weren\u2019t hot summers but he didn\u2019t need to heat food or water, daylight lasted a lot longer and so did his fuel. He conserved cash for possible truck repairs and things like that. He worked for a moving company on and off in the summer and was paid cash under the table. That gave him time for a garden, fishing and cutting down trees for the winter firewood. He\u2019d get by fine if no major crisis came along\u2014like a serious illness.</p><p>Really, the cost didn\u2019t matter. No matter what she needed, even if it was the hospital, he\u2019d find a way. He couldn\u2019t let her be sick. In less than twenty-four hours, all he really wanted was to see her smile like she had in that old picture Bobby had shown him.</p><p>He was barely conscious that the woman in the office had made a phone call and shrugged into her coat.</p><p>When Doc returned with his bag, he frowned at her. It was more like a glower. \u201cWhere do you think you\u2019re going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith you. Jack has David and this is a woman. You\u2019ll end up wanting me there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re pregnant and don\u2019t need to be around flu.\u201d</p><p>She laughed and her face lit up so pretty. \u201cLike I haven\u2019t been drenched in flu since the cold and rain hit. Gimme a break. Let\u2019s go.\u201d And she headed out the door.</p><p>\u201cDamn pigheaded woman,\u201d Doc muttered. \u201cShe\u2019d never take an order from me, but you\u2019d think a little friendly advice would be welcome\u2014\u201d Ian held the door open for him. \u201cWomen are nothing but a pain in the\u2014Why I never married. Not quite true, no one would have me.\u201d He stopped and navigated the stairs down the porch with his cane.</p><p>\u201cUm, Doc\u2014you wanna lock up?\u201d Ian asked.</p><p>\u201cNah. I locked up the drugs and Jack and Preacher are across the street. They smell trouble and they\u2019re armed to the teeth. It\u2019s a dead fool that bothers my place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d Ian said. They had it all worked out in this little town. Made him wonder just what that felt like. He hadn\u2019t had things all worked out in a long, long time.</p><p>There was a shiny Hummer sitting beside his old truck and the pregnant blonde was at the wheel, waiting. They must do a brisk business these days to afford a ride like that. The roll of bills in his pocket shrank again.</p><p>Ian opened the door for Doc Mullins and Mel and once again, Marcie slept so soundly she didn\u2019t realize he was back. \u201cI\u2019ll just check the stove for wood and then wait outside,\u201d he said.</p><p>Mel pulled a chair from the table and put it by the couch, giving it a tap so Doc would take a seat. Then she gently jostled Marcie\u2019s shoulder and called out to her, talking over Doc\u2019s shoulder. \u201cMarcie, can you wake up? Come on, open your eyes.\u201d</p><p>When Marcie\u2019s eyes came open, Mel smiled. \u201cHi there. Not feeling so good, huh? You remember me\u2014Mel Sheridan from Virgin River. I\u2019m the one who was dragged off a ladder in the middle of town by a brute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Marcie said. \u201cSure.\u201d And she came awake with a dry cough, turning her head aside.</p><p>\u201cThis is Doc Mullins. I work with him. He\u2019s a family practitioner. I\u2019m a nurse practitioner and midwife. Ian came for us. His diagnosis is flu. What\u2019s yours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUgh. It\u2019s probably just a bad cold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut your nose ain\u2019t running,\u201d Doc said. \u201cSit up for me, girl. I have to hear your chest.\u201d While Doc slid the cold stethoscope under the flannel shirt to listen to her lungs, she treated him to a deep, brittle cough. When she recovered, she took a few deep breaths for him, then sat patiently while he looked in her ears and throat, taking her temperature and palpating her glands.</p><p>Mel said, \u201cSo, you found your man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did,\u201d Marcie said. \u201cYour husband told you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh. I don\u2019t tell patient business without permission, but Jack\u2019s an open book unless he has specific instructions to keep a secret. How\u2019d Ian take to being found?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThoroughly pissed him off. You should hear him\u2014he can roar like a Siberian tiger. It\u2019s kind of amazing. Scared the liver out of me at first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd now?\u201d Mel asked.</p><p>She looked up at Mel. \u201cHe saved my life. He said I almost froze to death and he brought me in and warmed me up. He went for you...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said he didn\u2019t want to bring you to town because the heater in his truck isn\u2019t working very well. But I have a good heater and we have a couple of beds at the clinic\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t I just stay here?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI came all this way...I\u2019ve been looking for him...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can come to town with us until you feel better, then decide what to do. You can come back if you have unfinished business here. If you need a little backup, there\u2019s my husband and me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, shaking her head. \u201cI\u2019d rather see this through, then I\u2019ll go home.\u201d And what she didn\u2019t say was that she was a little afraid he might disappear again.</p><p>\u201cBut do you feel safe with him? It\u2019s pretty rugged out here. Your tiger doesn\u2019t have a lot of creature comforts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think Ian has much, being out here like this. But it\u2019s enough, isn\u2019t it? It\u2019s warm, there\u2019s food, he made me tea, bought me orange juice. He gave me aspirin...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know him, Marcie,\u201d Mel said. \u201cAnd from what I hear, you don\u2019t know him either. He\u2019s a recluse\u2014does he even have any friends?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she shrugged. \u201cHe has me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I take that to mean he\u2019s not roaring at you anymore?\u201d Mel asked.</p><p>\u201cI hope so. I think he\u2019s all calmed down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to leave you in a bad place. That would be irresponsible of me.\u201d</p><p>Marcie smiled a little. \u201cWhen he was loading his truck with firewood to sell, he was singing. You should have heard him. He has the most beautiful voice. I knew when I heard that voice that he\u2019s ferocious on the outside, but on the inside he\u2019s a tender soul. And I think he\u2019s proving I\u2019m right, in spite of himself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, it\u2019s your decision,\u201d Mel said. \u201cBut there\u2019s help if you need it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFlu,\u201d Doc said shortly. \u201cBoy\u2019s good\u2014he should practice medicine. You\u2019ll be all right after a couple of days of feeling like crap. I\u2019m going to give you an antibiotic injection, although it will only treat any bacterial infection you might\u2019ve picked up as a result of a viral flu. You\u2019ll have to ride it out, but you\u2019re young and healthy and seem to have a decent nurse. Ian took good care of the old man who lived here before him. He\u2019s up to the job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat may be,\u201d Mel said. \u201cBut before I leave, I\u2019m going to make sure he wants to do that. I\u2019m going to have to ask him, Marcie. If he doesn\u2019t want to take care of you through this illness, he shouldn\u2019t have to\u2014not when there\u2019s an alternative. If his means are slim and he\u2019s not inclined\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAll right,\u201d she said. \u201cBut when you ask him, will you please tell him I have eighty dollars I can give him?

Ask away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny chance you have an older sister?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI certainly do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, so do I\u2014Erin Elizabeth. Our mother died when I was only four and our dad when I was fifteen. Erin\u2019s seven years older and took complete responsibility for my younger brother and me. She\u2019s a good person, if a little on the bossy side. She was adamantly opposed to me looking for Ian by myself. In the end there wasn\u2019t much she could do to stop me\u2014I am an adult, though she might argue that. Our compromise was that I check in every couple of days and, believe me, she\u2019s more than ready for me to call off the hunt. Erin doesn\u2019t mean to be, but she\u2019s controlling. Sometimes a little hard to take...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I have an older sister who can fill that bill. And heavens, you saw Jack!\u201d</p> <p>Marcie smiled. \u201cI saw. Yes, I suppose you can relate. I need someone to call Erin, tell her that I found Ian, that I\u2019m safe and sound and staying with him for a little while. If you could just explain he has no phone, so I\u2019ll call her the next time I\u2019m in town, it might give her a little peace of mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that the extent of your family?\u201d Mel asked.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said. \u201cMe and Erin and our brother, Drew. But I also have my late husband\u2019s family and there are a million of them. Just because he\u2019s gone now, they won\u2019t ever give me up. I\u2019m far from alone, believe me. If I write down the number, will you call for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProvided Ian goes along with your idea, I\u2019ll be glad to,\u201d Mel said.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have to tell her I got sick. Do we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Marcie, I don\u2019t like stretching the truth,\u201d Mel said.</p> <p>\u201cWell\u2014you don\u2019t tell patient business. And you do think I\u2019ll be just fine, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Mel made a face and shook her head. \u201cIs this the way you\u2019ve been getting around your sister?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have to think fast around Erin. She\u2019s brilliant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBottoms up,\u201d Doc said, tapping the air bubbles out of a syringe. \u201cI\u2019ll give you some decongestant and cough medicine and beyond that, it\u2019s just rest, juice, water, light meals\u2014broth would be good for a day or so. Listen to your body and rest when you\u2019re tired. A lot of sleep and fluids almost always kicks this sucker fast. No wood chopping or washing clothes in the creek. You\u2019ll come around pretty quick, I bet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I can use the outdoor rather than the chamber pot, even though it\u2019s cold?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. Cold doesn\u2019t make you sick, it makes you cold. Bundle up anyway, and make it quick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou probably don\u2019t have to recommend that...Have you ever felt the seat of an outhouse in December?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cGirl, I had to get trained in how to flush when I was a young man,\u201d Doc said. \u201cGets you down to business real quick, now, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMarcie, if you need us, send Ian. I\u2019ll come and get you\u2014no questions asked,\u201d Mel said.</p><p>\u201cThank you, that\u2019s sweet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood luck.\u201d</p><p>Ian was pacing in front of the Hummer when Mel and Doc came out of the cabin. Mel paused to speak with Ian, as she had said she would. She took note of how ragged he was, how unkempt. His clothes were old and worn, his beard overgrown, but then most hardworking ranchers, farmers and loggers wouldn\u2019t be wearing their best duds on a workday. She was used to seeing this type of wardrobe out here, and it didn\u2019t always imply poverty. He didn\u2019t smell bad, she found herself thinking. She had spied the tub in the room; he kept himself and his cabin clean and he certainly wasn\u2019t thin. He was plenty well-nourished, a big man.</p><p>Doc made fast tracks to the Humvee and placed himself behind the wheel. She made a face.</p><p>\u201cHe sure can move when he wants to be the driver, despite all that arthritis,\u201d she said. \u201cMr. Buchanan, you were absolutely right\u2014Marcie has the flu. She\u2019s going to need to rest, drink plenty of fluids and she probably won\u2019t feel well for at least a couple of days\u2014maybe closer to a week, depending on how quickly she bounces back after some rest and medicine. Now, I offered to take her back to town and put her up at Doc\u2019s, but she\u2019d rather stay here. The question is\u2014are you willing? It\u2019s not as though you have to do that much for her\u2014Doc cleared her for use of the outdoor facilities as long as she dresses warm. She doesn\u2019t need much attention, but it\u2019s your home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe wants to stay?\u201d he asked, eyebrows arched. \u201cHere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe said that, yes. She also said to tell you she has eighty dollars for her food.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLord,\u201d he said, shaking his head. \u201cIf she wants to stay, she can stay. I can\u2019t see why she\u2019d want to. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m good company.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think she\u2019s very grateful for how well you\u2019ve tended her so far. Maybe there are other reasons, but she didn\u2019t share them. But just so we\u2019re clear\u2014I can come and get her anytime and we have a couple of hospital beds at the clinic. It\u2019s your decision. If it becomes a burden, you can let me know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do my best. I bought some broth. Juice. A half chicken for soup that should go at least twice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood idea. I swear by chicken soup. I guess you\u2019re on top of this. Is there anything else I can do for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you give her medicine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoc gave her a shot of antibiotic that probably won\u2019t perform any miracles, it being a viral flu. And he left her some pills and cough medicine. It\u2019s really tincture of time. The flu will do what it will do\u2014sometimes it\u2019s a quick cure, sometimes it hangs on. Luckily, she\u2019s young and healthy. Try not to catch it, will you?\u201d</p><p>He pulled a roll of bills out of his pocket and Mel, who had worked with Doc in these mountains for a while now, suspected that would be the whole of his fiduciary world. Most rural people way out here didn\u2019t deal with credit cards or checks; for many it was a cash existence. That wad of money would have to cover everything in his life, from fuel to food, for quite a while. \u201cWhat do I owe you?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cWell, let\u2019s see. I\u2019m thinking ten for the shot and another ten for the pills and cough medicine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd for the house call?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFive for gas?\u201d she said, by way of a question.</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s it?\u201d he asked. \u201cYou cutting me some kind of break here? She give you money or something?\u201d</p><p>Mel smiled. \u201cNo money from the patient. We\u2019re not exactly trading on the exchange yet. This isn\u2019t big business, it\u2019s just country medicine\u2014clean and simple. It\u2019s important to break even whenever we can\u2014helps us out in the long run.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat would you charge me if I lived in a big house and drove a hot car?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d bill the insurance and take them for a ride,\u201d she answered easily. Then she grinned at him.</p><p>He laughed in spite of himself. Old Doc didn\u2019t have himself a pretty young nurse or Hummer when Raleigh was sick and dying, but he always said, \u201cYou\u2019re eighty-eight and sick as a damn dog\u2014I\u2019m not taking all your money and leaving you nothing for a burial.\u201d Ian pulled off three tens and gave them to her. \u201cYou eating all right at your house? I\u2019m not shorting you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m covered\u2014I very cleverly married the guy in town who owns the bar and grill. I\u2019m eating way better than I should. And by that belly on Doc, he\u2019s living well enough, too. But thanks. It\u2019s appreciated. I\u2019ll put the extra toward someone in trouble, I promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good,\u201d he said. \u201cI got a lot to make up for.\u201d</p><p>She put out her hand. \u201cI bet not as much as you think.\u201d He shook the small hand and she hurried to the car and was gone.</p><p>When Ian finally came back inside, he didn\u2019t say a word. He fed the fire again, took off his jacket and went to what passed for his kitchen. He rolled up his sleeves and scrubbed his hands with soap and cold water. Next he pumped a pan full of water and set it on his little propane stove, unwrapped a half a chicken and plopped it in the water. He cut up an onion and some celery and put it in the pot. Then he put his jacket back on and went outside where she could hear the thumping that went along with loading wood into the truck. Whistling came eventually, but there didn\u2019t seem to be any singing today. She hoped she hadn\u2019t driven the music out of him.</p><p>The singing was a complete surprise. Bobby never mentioned it and it certainly hadn\u2019t come up in their few exchanged letters. But then would a big tough marine serenade his troops? Would he tell a soldier\u2019s wife that he loved to sing and had an angel\u2019s voice?</p><p>Her joints ached and she was feeling warm again, so she rolled over and let herself go back to sleep. She was vaguely aware that Ian was in and out of the cabin. She drifted. Now and then, she could hear the wood chopping, whistling, thunking of firewood into the truck bed.</p><p>She had no idea how long she\u2019d slept, when she roused to the most pleasant smell. She rolled over to find the room dim, just the glow from the woodstove and a naked lightbulb hanging over the kitchen table. The sun had set and the big pot was steaming on the little stove. He was sitting at the table under that single light, looking down. She noticed that the things from her car\u2014her sleeping bag, duffel, backpack and purse\u2014were stacked at the end of the sofa. And he had changed clothes; he wore gray sweatpants and a navy blue T-shirt and socks. His former pants, shirt and jacket were draped over his trunk, near a stack of books piled on the floor.</p><p>She rose on her elbows. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>He flipped a book closed and looked up. \u201cJust reading. You about ready for a little trip to the, ah, ladies\u2019 room?\u201d</p><p>She sat up and flipped her legs over the edge of the couch. \u201cAs a matter of fact,\u201d she said, standing. That flannel shirt of his came nearly to her knees. She wobbled a little and it brought him instantly to his feet. She sat back down quickly. \u201cWould you mind...handing me my jeans and boots?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d he said, pulling them off the chair and carrying them to her. The minute they were in hand, he went about the business of pulling on his own boots and jacket, his back toward her. \u201cYou need any help?\u201d he asked, not facing her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d she said. First the jeans came up, then she sat again and pulled on her boots without socks. \u201cDo I have a jacket around here somewhere?\u201d</p><p>He fetched the down vest from the same chair back and held it for her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll just be a minute\u2014\u201d</p><p>But he wasn\u2019t having it. He swept her up in his arms and carried her to the door. \u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019re all that strong. Probably just being asleep for so long and all. But I don\u2019t want to have to lift you up off the ground or anything. Let\u2019s not take any chances.\u201d</p><p>They were halfway across the yard to the outhouse when she said, \u201cYou let me stay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s what you said you wanted, according to the nurse. Even if I can\u2019t figure out why.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou like me,\u201d she said, petting his thick, red beard. She put her head against his shoulder, arms about his neck. \u201cTry to deny it.\u201d And then she coughed, most unattractively.</p><p>He turned his face away from her germs and grunted. Stopping in front of the outhouse door, he set her gently on her feet. She entered and, a moment later, was out again. \u201cI\u2019ll walk, I think. If you don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t fall. It\u2019s tougher to pick you up from the ground than from a standing position. Grab my arm if you need to.\u201d Their feet crunched on the frozen ground as they headed back to the cabin. \u201cSorry I don\u2019t have an indoor for you. Especially with you being sick.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cActually, it\u2019s a luxury. I was hitting the gas stations for one last bathroom visit before bedding down in the car for the night. Usually I could make it till morning, but if I couldn\u2019t, I had to make do. That usually meant a quick squat behind a bush on a deserted road. And it\u2019s been real cold lately.\u201d</p><p>As he looked down at her, his eyes were both warm and curious. \u201cYou don\u2019t look as tough as that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how tough I am\u2014look at me, sick as a pup. But I bet I can match you for stubborn.\u201d</p> <p>A sound came out of him.</p><p>\u201cHoly shit, Ian\u2014was that a laugh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA cough,\u201d he lied. \u201cYou probably got me sick.\u201d</p><p>Five</p><p>B ack inside the little cabin, Marcie took her place on the couch while Ian went to his little propane stove and gave the pot a stir. \u201cCan you eat a bit of soup?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>\u201cI think so. It sure smells wonderful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not much. Just boiled down chicken...some vegetables,\u201d he said simply. She watched as he ladled some into a large mug, plopped a spoon in it and put a slice of buttered bread on a saucer. Then he loaded that onto a flat board and brought it to her. \u201cI don\u2019t have things like a lot of different dishes\u2014just what I need. Be careful, it\u2019s hot.\u201d</p><p>She balanced the board on her knees. \u201cYou sure can do a lot with a little bit, can\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>He grunted an affirmative reply and went back to the pot, ladling some into a mug for himself. Then he sat at the table with his meal.</p><p>She took a couple of spoons of chicken soup. It was either delicious or she was ravenous. Then she walked over to the table with her board-tray. She put it down opposite him, then dragged the other chair the short distance to sit with him. He just lifted his eyebrows and watched her. \u201cIt\u2019s very good, Ian. You suppose we could eat together?\u201d</p><p>He just shrugged. \u201cIf that\u2019s what you want.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe could actually talk,\u201d she suggested.</p><p>He put his spoon in his mug and leaned back in his chair. \u201cLook, let me put this as simply as I can\u2014I\u2019ve spent the last few years trying to put all that business about Iraq out of my mind. Sometimes it would show up unannounced, give me headaches and cause dreams that weren\u2019t so nice. I don\u2019t want to talk about it. I don\u2019t want to answer a lot of questions about it.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed. \u201cPerfectly understandable,\u201d she finally said, her voice soft.</p><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s what you came here for, you wasted your time,\u201d he informed her.</p><p>She lifted a spoonful of soup to her lips, looking into the mug. \u201cI didn\u2019t waste my time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did your family say about this thing you did? Looking for me like this?\u201d</p><p>She gave a little shrug. \u201cMy sister didn\u2019t like it much...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t like it? Much?\u201d</p> <p>Marcie took a breath. \u201cShe said it was foolish and reckless. That I had no idea what I was getting into. That I didn\u2019t know you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, she\u2019s right about that,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cTechnically,\u201d Marcie agreed. \u201cI couldn\u2019t be sure what you would be like now, but I couldn\u2019t believe you\u2019d changed that much. And see\u2014I was right. You turned out to be a nice guy.\u201d</p><p>He snorted.</p><p>\u201cWe could talk about other things.\u201d She touched the book that sat on the table, gave it a close look. \u201cLike what you\u2019re reading. You go to the library?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s free,\u201d he said dismissively. \u201cI use the old library card that was left behind by the man who lived here before. No one questions that, though I\u2019m sure they know. But I\u2019m regular and never late, so it doesn\u2019t matter to anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s something you could tell me about. The man who lived here before. Dr. Mullins said you took care of him.\u201d</p><p>Ian took a couple more bites. \u201cAfter a while. First he took care of me, in a way.\u201d</p><p>She waited, but nothing came.</p><p>\u201cIn what way?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He lifted his mug and drained it of soup, putting it back on the table. \u201cI was camping on his land and he spotted me. He was old\u2014older than dirt. Didn\u2019t have hardly a tooth left in his head, skinny as a pole. He\u2019d been out here, alone, long over fifty years with no wife, no family, and he found me asleep in my sleeping bag under about four inches of snow. And he kicked me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe kicked you?\u201d she repeated, appalled.</p><p>\u201cKicked me, and I jumped a foot. And he said, \u2018So, you\u2019re not dead yet. Good thing, because you\u2019d just be food for the wildlife if you were\u2014I sure as hell can\u2019t bury you. Ground\u2019s too hard and I\u2019m too old.\u2019 That was our introduction. After a little glaring back and forth, he said that if I wanted, I could sleep indoors and eat from his cupboard if I\u2019d keep the stove fed and help out when he needed it. I wasn\u2019t thinking real clear back then and didn\u2019t have a lot of options. I hadn\u2019t even thought about winter at five thousand feet. I froze my ass off for a couple more nights before knocking on his door and all he said was, \u2018\u2019Bout time. I figured you were dead.\u2019 It was a pretty simple arrangement. We hardly talked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEver?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cAfter a month or two conversation picked up, but not a lot. He\u2019d been alone so long, he didn\u2019t much care to talk, kind of like me.\u201d He added a brief glare. But then he went on. \u201cSo I chopped wood, caught fish sometimes and used his rifle to shoot a bird or rabbit now and then. I kept the snow off his roof and the shed and the outhouse roof and drove the truck for him when he went for errands, like to pick up his social security check and to buy food. We ran out of firewood pretty quick and I had to chop more. I wasn\u2019t even sure how much of this land was his, but it\u2019s all trees and you can\u2019t see a neighbor. First tree I cut down damn near hit the house. He talked then\u2014I thought he\u2019d never shut the hell up. Then a few months later, we went for supplies and to the post office and he took me to the library and told me to pick out a book if I felt like it. He checked out picture books and sometimes children\u2019s books\u2014small words and big print. I never asked but I don\u2019t think he got much school. When the weather warmed, he told me where he wanted the garden, made me re-dig the outhouse and showed me the tools in the shed. He said if I chopped enough wood in spring and summer and cured it, I could sell firewood out of the back of the truck if I wanted to. I got right on it, having no other way to earn money. That\u2019s just about the whole story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMust have been a little miserable\u2014living with someone like that,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve had experience with mean old men,\u201d Ian said unemotionally.</p><p>She finished her mug of soup and he shot to his feet to refill both their mugs. \u201cJust half,\u201d she said, nibbling on the bread.</p><p>\u201cListen, eat as much as you\u2019ll hold. I think you lost a little flesh...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, maybe,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I lose weight real easy. I know I get skinny and looking kind of malnourished if I don\u2019t watch it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you haven\u2019t been watching it,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWell, I was saving money for gas,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>\u201cDid you just say you were saving money for gas? Looking for me?\u201d</p><p>She looked up. \u201cHave you noticed the price of gas lately?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoly God,\u201d he said, shaking his head. \u201cWhile you\u2019re here\u2014you eat. There\u2019s bread, peanut butter, juice, fruit, jelly\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, he got sick, didn\u2019t he?\u201d she went on, interrupting him. \u201cSo I bet that was just the beginning of the story, you living here for chores.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt just kind of happened,\u201d he said with a shrug. \u201cI can\u2019t say we ever did get chummy\u2014but I owed him for the roof over my head and brought in more than my share of food. When he got sick, I went for the doctor. It was a lesson\u2014when people out here get sick, they don\u2019t go for tests and such, not if they\u2019re in their late eighties for sure. The old doc told Raleigh...that was his name, Raleigh...Doc Mullins said he could take him to Valley Hospital and medicare would take care of him and Raleigh said he\u2019d shoot himself in the head first. It was settled that fast. Doc left some medicine and came back a few times. Then after about six months of that, Raleigh died in his sleep, and I went and got the doctor. He showed me that Raleigh had dictated him a note while he was sick that said, \u2018The man, Ian Buchanan, can have the house, truck, land and any money left, minus what\u2019s needed for burial. No tombstone.\u2019 He signed it, in his way, and Doc Mullins witnessed. I didn\u2019t think it would hold up. There was just about enough cash in that tin box to bury him real simple like he wanted. When I asked the old doc what I was supposed to do about the cabin and land and truck, he said, don\u2019t borrow trouble.\u201d</p><p>She laughed outright. \u201cNow what does that mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI took it to mean I should just carry on and not pursue the matter, but in fact old Doc Mullins has a friend who\u2019s a lawyer or judge or something and he had done the transfer of title on the deed, so old Raleigh died penniless in my care and there was no probate. Slick as snot,\u201d he said. Then he looked up and said, \u201cSorry.\u201d He cleared his throat. \u201cI looked at the truck title and when I saw he\u2019d signed it over\u2014or Doc had\u2014I got the plates in my name so I wouldn\u2019t end up in jail. I keep up my driver\u2019s license and that\u2019s the total extent of my official paperwork. When the taxes come due on this property, I pay them with a money order.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIan,\u201d she said, momentarily surprised. \u201cDo you own a mountain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA mountain full of nothing. Logging\u2019s prohibited up here. I have what I\u2019ve always had\u2014a cabin and some trees. And taxes. I manage, but it costs more than it yields most of the time. It still seems temporary. It could always just go away the first time I don\u2019t make the taxes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if the day ever comes you can\u2019t stay here anymore? Because it\u2019s not permanent enough?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI guess I\u2019ll have to think of something.\u201d</p><p>She was quiet while she finished her soup. Then she said, \u201cWhen he was sick, was he very sick? Did you have to care for him a lot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d have to say, he was very sick. He didn\u2019t get out of bed much for a long time. There used to be a small bed in here\u2014a bunk bed, just the bottom, with a mattress so thin it was almost no mattress at all. He had some of those old-age problems. He couldn\u2019t feed himself. Et cetera. When he passed, I burned the whole thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you slept on the couch until I came?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never slept on that couch\u2014it\u2019s too short and it sags under me. I unroll a pallet by the stove\u2014it\u2019s exactly the way I want it. I could buy a used bed, if that\u2019s what I wanted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it was hard work, Ian\u2014caring for someone you barely knew. He must have been grateful\u2014he left you all this.\u201d</p><p>He roared with totally facetious laughter. He wiped his hairy mouth on his sleeve and said, \u201cAll this? Mother of God, I don\u2019t even have something you can flush!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it because you can\u2019t?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cWhen I showed up at his door, there was no Coleman stove\u2014he lit the place with lanterns. Washed out of a bucket, when he washed. I added the generator, strung some lights, bought the tub, the stove. Some of the furniture was older than him and I brought in a new couch and chair. Well, they\u2019re used, but better than what was here. The only thing I really miss is a shower\u2014but I\u2019d have no idea how to plumb a house.\u201d</p><p>She let him finish laughing and when he was done, she said, \u201cYou know, that first night? When you snarled at me and tried to scare me? Well\u2014you scared me pretty good\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t scare any brains into you, though,\u201d he interrupted.</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s more my problem than yours. When I get my mind made up about something, it\u2019s hard to move me in any direction. But when I went to my car to eat the packed lunch I had, while the sun was setting and the snow started to fall, I thought I\u2019d never in my life seen a more beautiful place. There was a rainbow in the snow! And I wasn\u2019t afraid, because it was just pristine and glorious. You can have all the extras in the world in the city, but this is something you just can\u2019t buy.\u201d</p><p>He was quiet for a minute. Then he said, \u201cYou know what Bobby said about you? He said you were a real pistol.\u201d</p> <p>She watched his eyes. \u201cThat\u2019s almost talking about it,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cThen pretend I didn\u2019t say anything. You should be in bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen was the last time you slept?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cI should pull out my pallet, and you should be asleep again,\u201d he said. \u201cBesides, this is more talking than I\u2019m used to and I think I\u2019m worn out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d she said. She stood from her chair and looked down at the book. \u201cThomas Jefferson?\u201d she asked. \u201cDid you ever read John Adams?\u201d</p> <p>He nodded.</p><p>\u201cMe too. I loved that book. What I loved was Abigail\u2014she was amazing. Old John left her with a farm, children, very little money in a country in revolution and she did it all. She was my idol. If I could be anyone, I\u2019d be Abigail Adams.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause she did it all?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cBecause she was glad to do it all and never complained, that\u2019s how committed she was to what John was doing. I know\u2014as a woman, a feminist, I\u2019m not supposed to admire a woman who\u2019d do all that for a man, but she was doing it for herself. As if that was the contribution she could make to the founding of America. And they wrote each other letters\u2014not just romantic, loving letters, but letters asking each other for advice. They were first good friends, two people who respected each other\u2019s brains, and then obviously lovers, since they had a slew of kids. True partners, long before true partners were fashionable. And she\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like biographies,\u201d he said, cutting her off as though he\u2019d heard enough about Abigail. \u201cDon\u2019t ask me why, I couldn\u2019t tell you.\u201d</p><p>She went to her couch and pulled off her boots. \u201cMaybe you like figuring out why peoples\u2019 lives turn out the way they do. It\u2019s always a mystery, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p> <p>He pumped some water into the sink and cleaned up the mugs and spoons. Then he covered the pot of soup, not responding.</p><p>\u201cHey\u2014you don\u2019t have a refrigerator...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a shed,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019ll keep some food cold enough for another day. Can\u2019t keep eggs or milk\u2014they\u2019ll freeze. But if the soup freezes, we\u2019ll thaw it and cook it again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA shed for a refrigerator,\u201d she said, lying back on the sofa. \u201cIs the truck loaded for morning?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cIf I\u2019m gone when you wake up, you think you\u2019ll be okay to walk out back on your own? Because there\u2019s always the blue pot...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I\u2019m shaky, I\u2019ll take advantage of the blue pot\u2014but really, I\u2019m feeling very much better. Just a little tired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBesides bread, peanut butter, honey and juice in here, there\u2019s also lots of stuff in cans you can open. Beans and soup,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll probably be back and forth some tomorrow, loading and delivering.\u201d Then he headed out the door with his big pot of chicken soup.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Ian. For taking such good care of me. I know I\u2019m a terrible imposition.\u201d</p> <p>He didn\u2019t say anything, but he did stop in the doorway for a moment before going out.</p><p>She settled back on the couch. It wasn\u2019t much, this little cabin. It was less than not much\u2014it was stark and only the most absolutely necessary things were supplied. But considering she\u2019d finally found him, it was extremely comfortable for her. If it was her cabin, she\u2019d have soup bowls and plates, better furniture, an indoor biffy. She remembered Mel\u2019s words, \u201cI have to ask him, in case his means are slim...\u201d Really, there was no telling about that. Oh, he seemed to have very little money, but who knew how much of this mountain had been left to him and whether it was worth anything? It could be it was a little patch of worthless land. Or maybe it was vast and he had no idea the value. He didn\u2019t seem real focused on that.</p><p>She loved that he knew how to get by like this\u2014and that he\u2019d be willing to let her stay when she was so dependent. And there was also the fact she represented the very thing he was determined to forget, the past he was running from.</p><p>When he came back, he fed the fire, rolled out his pallet, turned off the light and laid down. After several minutes of quiet darkness, she heard his voice. \u201cSorry if I scared you. I don\u2019t roar that often.\u201d</p><p>A slow smile spread on her lips and she snuggled in under the old quilt, more content than she\u2019d been in a while.</p><p>In the morning when she woke, Ian and the truck were gone. She pulled on her jeans and boots and headed for the loo. Halfway there, she heard a cry and looked up to see the soaring beauty of an American Eagle.</p><p>Over the next couple of days, Marcie got lots of sleep. Not only was she fighting off that flu, but there was absolutely nothing to do. Ian would come home in early afternoon and be busy with his chores, his work. He\u2019d always bring a little food with him and simmer something for evening, like kidney beans and a ham shank or canned tomatoes thickened with paste for a kind of red sauce to pour over noodles.</p><p>He\u2019d split some logs, reload his truck for the next day, work outside, then come in and wash up at the sink. She\u2019d wake from a long nap to find he\u2019d changed into indoor clothes\u2014sweats, socks and a T-shirt.</p><p>One afternoon she rolled over on the couch, opened her eyes and saw him naked as he stood at the sink. She blinked a couple of times, taking in his lean, muscular back complete with ponytail that hung down right between his shoulder blades, his long legs and tight butt before she realized he was bathing. He was rubbing a soapy cloth under one arm, then around his neck. With a shriek of embarrassment, she rolled over and faced the back of the couch. He never said a word, but she heard his deep chuckle; it rumbled in her mind for hours. And when they sat at the table together for dinner, her face was as red as the tomato sauce on her noodles. That she should be surprised to catch him washing more than his hands was silly\u2014after all, he smelled good; he kept himself clean. He had to do it sometime and somewhere. It wasn\u2019t as though he could excuse himself and go to the powder room. She managed to wash her face and brush her teeth while he was away, but he had no other choice\u2014she was a fixture on his lumpy couch.</p><p>It might\u2019ve been nice if he\u2019d awakened her to say, \u201cI\u2019m getting naked to wash now, so if you don\u2019t want to be embarrassed, close your eyes.\u201d But then, no\u2014Ian wouldn\u2019t do that. It was his cabin. And he was a man. It had always intrigued her the way men could stalk around naked, proud as lions, completely unconcerned about being seen, judged.</p><p>They ate at the table together in the evening, talked a little bit, but not so much. When dinner was over he\u2019d say, \u201cI usually turn in right after dinner; the day starts real early for me.\u201d</p><p>And although she\u2019d have slept away most of the day, she found that, after a while of lying on the couch in the warm, dark cabin, she\u2019d nod off again and not wake until he was gone the next morning.</p><p>Their dinner conversations were a wonderful diversion for her, and sometimes she could get him to talk about things she\u2019d been wondering about for too long, but there was always a line she didn\u2019t dare cross. When she started to tell him about Bobby\u2019s large and devoted family, he pinched his eyes closed briefly, just enough of a message to say that he couldn\u2019t go there. The whole Fallujah event that left Bobby physically disabled and Ian emotionally crippled was off-limits.</p><p>\u201cI visited your father,\u201d she bravely told him over dinner. Ian\u2019s brown eyes lifted and the amber in them sparkled. \u201cHe\u2019s very sick,\u201d Marcie said.</p><p>Ian just looked down at his plate and shoveled more hamburger gravy and boiled potatoes into his mouth.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not particularly friendly,\u201d she courageously pointed out.</p><p>Ian chuckled and it was an unmistakably sardonic tone. \u201cHe isn\u2019t now, is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI assumed it\u2019s because of age, illness\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t assume. He\u2019s never been easy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought maybe because he\u2019s unwell\u2014\u201d</p><p>Ian\u2019s eyes snapped up, angry. \u201cMy father and I have never been close. Mostly because of that unfriendly nature.\u201d</p><p>She took a couple of bites that were hard to swallow. \u201cI thought you\u2019d want to know.\u201d</p><p>He took a breath and she could tell it took effort to keep his voice even. \u201cListen, he\u2019s not worried about me, all right? It\u2019s not keeping him up nights wondering where I am. What I\u2019m doing with myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut if he\u2019s just not well\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarcie. My mom died when I was twenty. I checked in regularly to see if the old man was all right, but the fact is, he didn\u2019t write or call for seven years. Seven.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed hard. \u201cBut you called him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said, looking back to his plate, scooping up some food. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat must have hurt.\u201d</p><p>There was a long moment of silence. \u201cMaybe when I was younger,\u201d was all he said.</p><p>\u201cWhat an old fool,\u201d she muttered, digging back into her own plate, angrily. \u201cThe idiot.\u201d She took a couple more bites, small ones. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I brought it up.\u201d</p><p>After a moment, Ian said, \u201cYou didn\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, all I can say is, his loss. That\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>Again, there was quiet. Ian scraped the last of his food off his plate. Then he rose and began to rinse the dishes in the sink. Finally the words came that ended the talk for the evening. \u201cTime for bed.\u201d</p><p>Marcie was on her fourth day at Ian\u2019s. Her cough was still hanging on but she was feeling very much better\u2014enough so that the boredom was getting to her. She rose after Ian was gone, ate bread and honey, walked out back to the facilities, drank the lukewarm coffee Ian had left sitting on the woodstove, and tried reading some of his library book. She had no idea what time it was when she walked out back again.</p><p>The air was clear and crisp, the sky blue, the ground covered with a couple of inches of packed snow. She hadn\u2019t even bothered to pull on her jeans, though she had put on her jacket. Her legs were bare between her calf-high boots and thigh-long flannel shirt. She might have wandered around a bit, but the woods were so dense beyond his lot, she was a little afraid of getting lost. A trip to the john was about all she dared.</p><p>She was near the outhouse door when she heard a noise and the hair on the back of her neck crinkled up. She turned to see an animal standing right between two big trees at the tree line. As she stared, wide-eyed, the animal crouched and hissed, baring its fangs. It was some sort of big cat. It looked like a small jungle cat\u2014a tawny and unspotted animal. She\u2019d never seen anything like it except in a zoo; it was as big as a good-sized golden retriever. She glanced at the cabin, at the outhouse. And then the cat darted across the yard.</p><p>In two long strides Marcie dashed into the outhouse, slamming the door. She sat down on the seat just to get her wits. There was a bang on the door as if the beast had hurled himself at it, then came a scratching and a snarling. Oh shit, she thought\u2014he\u2019s out there, after me! Waiting for me!</p><p>Well, it was cold, but it was probably better to freeze to death than to be mauled by some mysterious wild cat. So she stood up, lowered the seat\u2014which was just an old Home Depot toilet seat, and tried to get comfortable, though the cold seeped through that flannel shirt pretty quickly, freezing her buns. Stupid not to even put her jeans on for this trek, but then she hadn\u2019t been expecting company. She glanced at her wrist\u2014of course she hadn\u2019t even been wearing her watch. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The fact was, she\u2019d been living in one of Ian\u2019s flannel shirts for four days, sleeping in it, eating in it, wandering out to the loo in it, with only her boots in addition. She ran a hand over her head; it felt as though her naturally curly, bright copper hair was standing on end, big as a house. She\u2019d managed a little teeth brushing and panty changing, but other than that, nothing. She must look like a vagrant. A homeless person hiding out in Ian\u2019s outhouse.</p><p>She glanced at her naked wrist again and shivered. She started counting in her head to mark the passing of the minutes. How long does a small lion wait for his prey? He had a coat, so they weren\u2019t matched opponents. She started thinking; if she opened the door and he was nowhere to be seen, could she make the mad dash for the cabin? But first, she should do what she came to do, so she wouldn\u2019t have to use the little blue pot.</p><p>Task finished, she sat a few minutes longer, very quietly. Then she sheepishly opened the outhouse door, cursing the squeaking hinges as she stuck her head out. She saw nothing, so she took a careful step outside. She heard a hiss and snarl and saw the cat lurking around the shed, twenty feet away. She retreated, slamming the door. \u201cShit,\u201d she said aloud. \u201cShit, shit, shit!\u201d</p> <p>So she brought up her feet so that her heels rested on the seat and pulled the huge flannel shirt over her knees, hugging them. There was nothing in the outhouse with which to defend herself. In fact, there was also no reading material\u2014not even a truck or sports magazine. Leave it to Ian\u2014bare to the bone. No extras. He didn\u2019t even keep a book in the house unless it came from the library. After a little while, she began to shake with cold. It didn\u2019t help that she began coughing, even though she tried to control it, stop it, muffle it; the big cat could probably hear her and know his prey was still alive, trapped.</p><p>So be it. She would freeze to death. She didn\u2019t remember anything from the last time she nearly froze to death. Remembering nothing implied it was painless.</p><p>Then she heard the sound of Ian\u2019s truck come up the road. There was no mistaking that engine; it was rough and growly. She sprang to her feet, because suddenly her only thought was that Ian could be attacked by the feline beast that waited for her. She pressed her ear against the rough wooden door. She heard nothing until the screech of Ian\u2019s truck door opening. She flung the door to the outhouse open and yelled, \u201cIan! Look out! There\u2019s a\u2014\u201d</p><p>She was cut off by the snarl and lunge of the cat at the door. She ducked in quickly with a scream, inexplicably happy that the cat had come after her and not gone after an unprepared Ian.</p><p>So, she thought, here we are. I\u2019m trapped in the john and he\u2019s trapped in either the truck or the cabin. And it\u2019s colder than hell. Great. And to think I was wishing for a microwave.</p> <p>But only seconds seemed to have passed before there was a huge blast that caused her to sit up straight and catch her breath. Then the outhouse door opened sharply, and Ian stood there with a startled look on his face and a big gun in his hand. \u201cHow long have you been in here?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI have no idea,\u201d she said. \u201cI think maybe d-d-days.\u201d</p><p>He got a sheepish look on his face. \u201cYou about done in here?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She burst into laughter, which brought another coughing spasm, then laughter again. \u201cYes, Ian,\u201d she finally said. \u201cI\u2019ve widdled and wiped. Can I please go home now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHome? Marcie\u2014that car of yours\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe cabin, Ian.\u201d She laughed. \u201cJesus, do you have no sense of humor?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t so funny. I can\u2019t imagine what he was doing around here. I don\u2019t keep food out or small livestock...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was hanging around the shed. You think maybe he likes chicken soup?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never had a problem like that before. That\u2019s bold, getting out where people can see him, challenge him\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell was that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPuma,\u201d he said. \u201cMountain lion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew that was a lion.\u201d She stopped suddenly. \u201cYou didn\u2019t hurt him, did you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarcie, he wanted to eat you! Are you worried about his soul or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just wanted him to go away,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t want him to go dead.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI just scared him off. Listen,\u201d he said, walking her quickly to the cabin, \u201cif it had been down to you or him, could you have shot him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ve never fired a gun, so I don\u2019t like my chances. If I\u2019d had a big gun like that in my hands I could\u2019ve probably shot you or the cabin or shot the crap out of that outhouse...\u201d She burst into laughter at her pun. \u201cBut he was way smaller. You have a frying pan, right? A big iron one, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, in future, I can get to the bathroom with some protection. I was once a very good hitter in softball.\u201d</p><p>He stopped walking and looked down at her. \u201cJesus, there\u2019s always the blue pot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but there are some things a lady will risk her life to keep private.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. He actually smiled. \u201cIs that so?\u201d</p><p>Six</p><p>T he very next day when Ian came home, he caught Marcie standing at the sink in his flannel shirt and calf-high boots. No pants. Panties maybe; he tried not to think about that. She was rubbing her face with a washcloth, and her hair was so bushy it looked like a clown\u2019s wig. He put the sack on the table. \u201cFeeling better?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI must be,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019d kill for clean hair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want to wash your hair?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was tempting, but I didn\u2019t know if a cold, wet head was the best idea. The water out of this pump is freezing.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019ve been here for days and haven\u2019t figured out much. Not like you to not pay attention to details, is it? So. Good day for bath day,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cHave you had a bath since I\u2019ve been here?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI admit, I\u2019ve been putting that off, making do with a pot of hot soapy water at the sink, but not just because you\u2019re here. Have you noticed, it\u2019s a little cold?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw the tub of course, but I couldn\u2019t imagine how...\u201d</p><p>He just shook his head. \u201cYou\u2019re right, you\u2019re not used to roughing it. Here\u2019s how it\u2019s going to work\u2014I\u2019ll put a big pot of water on the woodstove, feed it real good so we get the room nice and warm. I\u2019ll get another one going on the Coleman stove\u2014that goes a lot faster\u2014and we\u2019ll fill the sink with hot water for your hair and while we\u2019re taking care of that, get a second one going on the Coleman. By the time your hair is clean, we\u2019ll have two pots of near-boiling water for the tub. I\u2019ll add some cold from the pump and you take a little dip. Can\u2019t screw around\u2014I can\u2019t get the tub full. If I just keep heating and adding water, by the time I get a boiling pot, the one in the tub has already turned cold. So it\u2019s a shallow bath, but it\u2019s warm and gets the job done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s sure generous, that you\u2019d do all that for me...\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor us, Marcie. I\u2019ll get a bath after you. And tomorrow I\u2019ll stop at the coin laundry and wash up the dirty clothes. I\u2019ll take any of yours you\u2019d like me to. Just because you haven\u2019t been feeling too good...\u201d</p><p>She shifted from foot to foot, chewing on her lower lip.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? You don\u2019t want a bath?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d die for a bath,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s just that.... I couldn\u2019t help but notice, there doesn\u2019t seem to be a separate room with a door that closes...And I also noticed that doesn\u2019t seem to bother you too much.\u201d</p><p>The corners of his lips lifted. \u201cI\u2019ll load the truck with tomorrow\u2019s wood while you have your bath,\u201d he finally said.</p><p>She thought about this for a second. \u201cAnd I could sit in my car during your bath?\u201d she suggested.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so\u2014your car is almost an igloo now. Just a little white mound. Not to mention mountain lions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, what am I supposed to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you can take a nap, read a little of my book, or close your eyes. Or you could stare\u2014get the thrill of your life.\u201d</p><p>She put her hands on her hips. \u201cYou really wouldn\u2019t care, would you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really. A bath is a serious business when it\u2019s that much trouble. And it\u2019s pretty quick in winter.\u201d He started to chuckle.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d she asked, a little irritated.</p><p>\u201cI was just thinking. It\u2019s cold enough in here, you might not see that much.\u201d</p><p>Her cheeks went hot, so she pretended not to understand. \u201cBut in summer, you can lay in the tub all afternoon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn summer, I wash in the creek.\u201d He grinned at her. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you comb the snarls out of your hair? You look like a wild banshee.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him a minute, then said, \u201cDon\u2019t flirt with me. It won\u2019t do you any good.\u201d Then she coughed for him, a long string of deep croaks that reminded them both she had had a good, solid flu. Also, it covered what happened to be amused laughter from him.</p><p>While he pumped water into a big pot, he said, \u201cTake your medicine. That sounds just god-awful. And I, for sure, don\u2019t want it.\u201d</p><p>It took a good thirty minutes to get the sink full of warm water. She was rolling up the sleeves of the overlong shirt, turning under the collar to keep it from getting wet, and grabbed the shampoo out of her duffel. He held out his hand. \u201cWhat?\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cPut your head in the sink,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019ll be hard for you to know if the soap\u2019s out. It\u2019ll be faster and easier if I just do it for you.\u201d</p><p>She picked up the towel he\u2019d laid out on the short counter, pressed it against her face and bent at the waist, dipping her head in the warm water. She could feel him use a cup to wet her hair, then begin to gently lather it. Those big calloused hands were slow and gentle, his fingertips kneading her scalp in a fabulous massage. She enjoyed it with her eyes closed, trying not to moan in pleasure. Finally she said, \u201cYou aren\u2019t going to offer to shave my legs for me, too, are you?\u201d</p><p>His hands suddenly stopped moving. There was a stillness and a silence for such a drawn out moment, she wondered if she had somehow offended him. \u201cMarcie,\u201d he finally said. \u201cWhy in the world would you shave your legs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re hairy!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what? Who\u2019s gonna care?\u201d</p><p>She thought about this for a second. She was on the top of a mountain in the middle of nowhere with a man who looked like Grizzly Adams in a place that didn\u2019t even have indoor plumbing. Why would she shave her legs? And armpits? Finally, in a little voice, she said, \u201cI would.\u201d</p><p>He just let his breath out in a long sigh. Then he began rinsing her hair.</p><p>While she was towel drying her hair, he pulled a clean shirt from his trunk and handed it to her. This time it was an old soft denim one with fraying around the cuffs and collar and mismatched buttons. \u201cYou better wear this,\u201d he said. \u201cThat plaid flannel is about ready to walk to the laundry and throw itself in.\u201d When he turned away, she pulled it out and surreptitiously sniffed it herself.</p><p>\u201cSmart-ass,\u201d she muttered under her breath.</p><p>Once the tub was poured and he\u2019d refilled the big pots for his own bath, setting them to heat, he left her. She could hear the whistling and thumping of logs while she did, indeed, shave her legs. And armpits. The whistling wasn\u2019t just meaningless tweeting\u2014he was gifted. The melody was clear, twirls and whorls and everything. She longed for the singing, but today, he just whistled. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When he came back inside, she was wearing the fresh shirt. She puzzled over the mismatched buttons, then realized he must replace buttons as he lost them, keeping even his oldest clothes as functional as possible for as long as he could. A very peculiar man. He lived in such a rustic, gone-to-the-devil lifestyle\u2014his hair and beard gone mad\u2014yet he seemed to take such jealous care of old, worn clothing.</p><p>To her surprise, he aped her routine exactly, leaning into the sink to suds his hair and beard while a second and third pot of water cooked, except he accomplished it bare-chested. She tried to read his library book while he did this, but she found herself continually peeking around the covers to get a good view of that broad expanse of back, that firm male butt. He kept the fitness of his body pretty-much concealed under his clothing, but really, he had the body of a god. Small wonder he\u2019d be built so powerful, with the work he did. He chopped down trees and split logs all the time, loaded at least a cord of wood a day into his truck, then unloaded it when he delivered it\u2014he was cut like a wrestler on steroids.</p><p>When she\u2019d caught sight of him before, she\u2019d whirled away too quickly to appreciate his physique. Given the fact that his hair and beard were so thick and full, she was expecting a gorilla with hair on his back. But, no\u2014there was just a hairy chest that was broad and hard, biceps like small melons, back wide and muscled, waist narrow. He had tattoos on each upper arm\u2014an eagle on the right, a banner that said USMC on the left.</p> <p>He slicked back the hair on his head, retied it, and combed through his beard with an old brush while his bath water heated. She finally understood the reason for all the big pots stacked beside the kitchen cabinet\u2014not for cooking big meals since there was but one resident, but for heating water.</p><p>He obviously trimmed his ponytail and beard occasionally. She just wondered, did he ever trim it enough to make a real difference, or did he let it go crazy and sometimes lop off an inch or two from the bottom? His hair and beard were both plentiful and thick with lots of curls, the hair on his head light brown and on his chin, reddish-brown. With those brown eyebrows, which were healthy, if he frowned, he looked beastly.</p><p>Maybe this was all just part of his hiding. Tucked away in the mountains, incognito behind that uncanny red beard and thick brown hair.</p><p>She plopped herself on the sofa with his book on her raised knees. When he dumped the water into the tub and began to unbuckle his belt, she sank into the sofa and put the book right over her face, blinding her against an accidental glance at more of him. She heard him chuckle lightly right before he said, \u201cI\u2019ll tell you when I\u2019m done.\u201d She heard the splashing and swishing of the water, and not ten minutes later he said, \u201cI\u2019m done.\u201d But she gave him an extra couple of minutes. He was just contrary enough to trick her.</p><p>When he gathered up the dirty clothes and stuffed them into a laundry bag, she turned over a couple of pair of jeans, four pair of socks, two sweatshirts and some sweatpants. She kept her undergarments to herself. When he left the next morning, she placed a big pot of water on top of the wood-burning stove and, when it was finally just a bit more than warm, she washed out her own underwear in the sink and draped her panties and bras along the rim of the tub to dry in front of the stove. When driven to the outhouse by sheer urgent need, she carried the big iron skillet. If that beast showed up again, teeth bared, she\u2019d knock him into the middle of next week. She might not be a hunter, but she\u2019d been a damn fine softball player in her day. Then, tired and coughing, she took her medicine and napped.</p> <p>He came in carrying a long, rectangular cardboard box inside of which were neatly folded clothes. He put it down on one of his trunks and lifted a pair of panties off the rim of the tub. \u201cI hope you\u2019re starting to feel better,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m up to a lot of this. Old Raleigh is probably spinning in his grave...\u201d</p><p>And she bolted off the couch, snatched up her dainties and tucked them into her duffel even though they weren\u2019t entirely dry.</p><p>That night\u2019s dinner was boiled potatoes, a few fresh, soft-cooked eggs and some thick chunks of ham. And then they talked a little as they ate: about his day, his customers and routine, but afterward, before she could sneak up on the subjects that brought her here, he said it was time for quiet so that he could read a little and sleep. She granted this without argument\u2014he\u2019d lived alone for a long time and it didn\u2019t mean he was unkind or cruel.</p><p>She began to relish the small things\u2014his occasional subdued laughter. No one could call it an actual laugh, but he did cave into amusement if she shot him a smart-ass comment. He smiled at her from time to time\u2014behind that bushy red-brown beard he had beautiful, healthy teeth.</p><p>But she was getting lonely. She wondered if she could wait out his silence.</p><p>One afternoon, she witnessed a most remarkable thing. He had been whistling while piling his wood in the truck and had finally started to sing, quietly at first and then louder, that incredible voice just making her heart flutter. Suddenly all sound stopped; no more logs, no more singing. And yet the door didn\u2019t open. At first, she thought he\u2019d made a pass by the outhouse, but time stretched out. Finally, she stepped out the front door and quietly looked around the side of the cabin. She saw Ian out by the shed. He was standing in front of a very large buck with a huge, beautiful rack that must span over three feet. His hand was out and the buck seemed to be eating out of it; Ian was talking softly to the deer, stroking its jaw with the other hand.</p> <p>She was frozen in the moment, silently watching as Ian and the deer, like best friends, spent this quiet, companionable time together. There was a kindness in this man that calmed the most skittish of wildlife. Would she ever be in touch with that side of his nature, she wondered? Did he only roar at people who frightened him?</p><p>She had frightened him with the past when she arrived. She\u2019d been very careful not to do that again. A little time, a little more trust, and she would sneak up on those old issues carefully. The last thing she wanted was to hurt him. She knew that he was a good person.</p><p>How could a father have turned a cold shoulder to this man? she asked herself. How?</p><p>The deer took a couple of steps back, turned, and pranced back into the trees. Ian turned back to his work and caught sight of her standing there. He walked over to her.</p><p>\u201cYou saw my buddy, Buck,\u201d he said. \u201cI keep an apple in my pocket when I work outside. Sometimes he shows up. If the apple starts to get soft before he comes, I eat it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you do that?\u201d Marcie asked, entranced.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a trick. I found him when he was young. He was nicked by a hunter\u2019s bullet, separated from his mother, all spooked and confused and bleeding. So I kind of caught him. The old man, Raleigh, he said his eyes weren\u2019t any good anymore and he couldn\u2019t do anything, but I could do something about that wound, take care of him, give him a couple of apples and let him go. Which is what I did. I closed him in the shed, fed and watered him, gave him apples and when he was fine, I turned him loose. That\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he comes back?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot regularly. I\u2019m just happy he hasn\u2019t told his friends.\u201d</p><p>Marcie put her hand against her chest, touched. \u201cIan, that\u2019s incredible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get sloppy, Marcie. If I had a freezer, I might shoot him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t!\u201d</p><p>He smiled at her. \u201cI like venison. Don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>She thought about that chili Jack had given her, how it melted in her mouth. But she said, \u201cNot that much!\u201d And she whirled and went into the house, his amused laughter at her back.</p><p>Midmorning, Marcie heard an engine and knew it wasn\u2019t Ian; the motor was too smooth. She opened the cabin door and saw the nurse, Mel, get out of a big Hummer with her bag in hand. \u201cWell, hello,\u201d Mel said. \u201cYou must be feeling better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMuch, thanks,\u201d Marcie said. \u201cAlone this time?\u201d</p><p>Mel came up to the door. \u201cI thought I\u2019d just drop by, see how you\u2019re doing.\u201d</p><p>Marcie laughed at her. \u201cYou don\u2019t just stop in here. I remember how hard this place was to find. Come in. I\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t fix tea and cookies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarcie\u2014I talked with your sister. I thought maybe I should tell you about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, God. Was she mean as a badger about this? Did she totally freak out?\u201d</p><p>Mel chuckled a little. \u201cTotally? No. But she has some strong opinions where this visit is concerned. I\u2019ll tell you how it went.\u201d</p><p>Marcie threw her arm toward the table with the two chairs and Mel took one. She got right to the point. \u201cI think I did what you asked. I told her you had found Ian Buchanan, you were visiting with him, planned to stay a while and would call her when you were in town next. I honestly don\u2019t think I got out much more than that. She wanted to know why, if you found him and talked to him, you\u2019re not on your way home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, holy cow. No\u2014holy sister.\u201d Marcie put her head in her hand. \u201cWell, because I got sick, but I wouldn\u2019t want her to know that. She might come up here with an ambulance. She can move mountains when she wants to. Mobilizing the National Guard wouldn\u2019t be impossible for Erin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI kind of got that impression.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut this flu turns out to be a blessing. Because Ian\u2019s very slow to get close, and he\u2019s awful used to not having anyone to talk to. Just being here for a few days has gotten him used to me a little. We\u2019ve nibbled around the edges of our individual lives without talking about things like the war, my late husband Bobby, what drove him to leave the Marines, his hometown, all that. But I\u2019m getting closer. Because he\u2019s stuck with me, we\u2019ve been getting acquainted. Reacquainted really\u2014we were in touch right after Bobby was hurt\u2014briefly. So, I\u2019m trying to build trust and friendship. One of these days he\u2019s going to really talk to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>Marcie shrugged. \u201cMel, I don\u2019t know why I had to do this\u2014come here like this. It was just something I couldn\u2019t live without doing. When I understand the man who saved my husband\u2019s life\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait a minute,\u201d Mel said. \u201cHe saved your husband\u2019s life?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh,\u201d Marcie said. \u201cDidn\u2019t I tell Jack that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess not. At least Jack never mentioned it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, he did. He risked his life to save Bobby and was injured himself in the process. It\u2019s not Ian\u2019s fault Bobby lived with terrible disabilities. I appreciate that he did everything he could. I don\u2019t know if you can understand this, but despite the fact that Bobby might have lived too long in a dysfunctional body, with no concept of what was happening around him, I got to\u2014\u201d Marcie glanced away, swallowed back tears and said, so softly, \u201cI was with him a little longer. I\u2019m very grateful for the time I had with him. Unfair as that might seem to Bobby.\u201d</p><p>Mel took a deep breath. Jack was her second husband; she\u2019d been widowed when she lost her first husband to a violent crime. She wasn\u2019t even tempted to explain the details at the moment. Instead she put her hand on Marcie\u2019s arm and said, \u201cI understand completely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are other things. The way Bobby felt about Ian\u2014how much he admired him, for one thing. Bobby thought Ian was the greatest man ever, he wanted to be like him. And this great man\u2014he ran away from everything and everybody. It doesn\u2019t add up. And then there\u2019s something so silly\u2014baseball cards. They both collected baseball cards ever since they were boys and while they were sitting in the desert on the lookout for bombs and snipers, they talked about those stupid baseball cards. There are things I want to know. You see?\u201d</p><p>Mel smiled. \u201cI see,\u201d she said quietly.</p><p>\u201cI tried to explain all this to Erin, but she doesn\u2019t get it. I think it\u2019s because I\u2019m her first concern. All she thinks about is keeping me safe and from getting hurt any more than I\u2019ve been over the last few years. I know Ian might never open up to me\u2014I have to be prepared for that. He\u2019s been very blunt\u2014he doesn\u2019t want to talk about any of it. Whatever happened left a very big hole in his heart.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Mel said, leaning her elbows on the table. \u201cI don\u2019t have a lot of experience with this sort of thing, but I do have a little. I have myself a marine who\u2019s been to war way too much and he has a shaky, vulnerable side. I don\u2019t know all the triggers. I wouldn\u2019t want you at risk when you finally decide to confront these things\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not going to snap,\u201d Marcie said. \u201cIn fact, I don\u2019t think he even realizes it, but he is not a tortured man. Maybe he was a few years ago, and maybe those memories are still disturbing, but now he\u2019s just a man who lives in the mountains...in a simplified life...and he lives alone. It\u2019s less complicated than it seems. At least, that\u2019s my opinion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. He sings,\u201d Mel said with a smile.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not just that. He talks to me about other things. About the old man who gave him the cabin, about the deer that comes visiting. He washed my hair for me. He heated water so I could take a bath. He goes to the library and he reads every day\u2014he doesn\u2019t read books about how to build bombs or make poisons\u2014he has a big stack of biographies. He\u2019s intelligent. Has a sense of humor he doesn\u2019t really want me to see\u2014I\u2019m sure he thinks I\u2019ll get the misguided impression he\u2019s enjoying me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he\u2019s not on a hair-trigger,\u201d Marcie said, shaking her head. \u201cFor some reason he thinks being alone is better for him...Eventually I\u2019ll figure that out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarcie, I think your sister has run out of time on this. She suggested she should come up here and get you.\u201d</p><p>Marcie stiffened. \u201cDid you tell her not to?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI told her I saw you myself and that you were fine. But I lied when I said that, you weren\u2019t fine. You had a fever, a cough, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I was being taken care of! I\u2019m fine! My legs are even shaved!\u201d Mel straightened up with a questioning look on her face. \u201cIt was a joke\u2014I wanted to shave my legs and he wondered why that would matter out here, in the woods. But they\u2019re shaved, damn it!\u201d</p><p>Mel smiled. \u201cYou\u2019re comfortable?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cHell, there\u2019s no refrigerator or indoor plumbing,\u201d Marcie said. \u201cIan\u2019s gone from before six in the morning till early afternoon and then he reloads his truck, so I don\u2019t see him until dinnertime. He always cooks something and we talk during dinner, which is early, and then he likes it quiet so he can just read his book and go to sleep, like he\u2019s always done. I\u2019m lonesome and I want to watch Medium, and Men in Trees. I want my favorite CD\u2019s and DVD\u2019s\u2014I used to watch Love Actually once a month. Comfortable? I\u2019m getting by\u2014better than when I was looking for him and sleeping in my car, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were sleeping in your car?\u201d Mel asked, aghast.</p><p>\u201cWell, I was running low on money. And I hadn\u2019t found him. We shouldn\u2019t tell Erin about that...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s not exactly medical business,\u201d Mel warned.</p><p>\u201cI bet it is, somehow. I bet it helped get me sick!\u201d</p><p>Mel just smiled. She reached down and picked up her bag. \u201cCan I take your temperature, look in your throat, hear your chest?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, sure...I can\u2019t seem to shake the cough, but I feel pretty good.\u201d</p><p>Mel got busy. While she was giving Marcie a once-over, she said, \u201cI think you should tell Ian you have to make a phone call. Talk to your sister yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can drive. I\u2019ll just go into\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have snow tires or chains?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell\u2014no, but\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOhhhh, Marcie. That little VW of yours would slip right off the mountain real easy. We\u2019ve had snow up here since you arrived, and a bit lower, some rain. You just don\u2019t have the weight or traction. Until we dry up a little, get a lift into town in something heavy\u2014like that big, old truck of Ian\u2019s. Or, you can tell me when you\u2019d like a trip to town and I\u2019ll come and get you\u2014but, believe me, it\u2019s a crazy notion to drive that VW into town. It could be disastrous. Besides, it appears to be buried...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, sure. Maybe I\u2019ll talk to him about that in the next day or two...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re definitely on the mend, my girl. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re contagious. We\u2019ll keep an eye on the cough, and you take that expectorant Doc gave you. But your chest sounds good and I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s not that unusual for the cough to hang on. Your throat is still a little irritated and your lungs want to clean themselves of drainage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen\u2014was there a bill? For coming out here? For medicine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTaken care of,\u201d Mel said, packing up her stuff.</p><p>\u201cIan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, as a matter of fact. I think it might\u2019ve been a case of pride. Why don\u2019t you come to town for a few hours\u2014it\u2019ll help you from going stir crazy. The bar\u2019s open from early morning till nine or ten at night. People are in and out all day. You can use the phone there or the one at the clinic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. Not a bad idea. Mel? The tree? The Christmas tree in town? Is it done now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlmost done. There\u2019s a little left to do. It\u2019s awful big, you know. It\u2019s beautiful,\u201d she said, beaming. \u201cAnd don\u2019t tell Jack, but I got a ride in a cherry picker while he was away, running errands. It was so cool.\u201d</p><p>Marcie waited until dinner to broach the subject of going into town. She wanted to time it perfectly\u2014not too early in their meal, but not at the last spoonful when he could get up with his empty plate and turn his back on her. Halfway through dinner she asked, \u201cIs Virgin River out of your way when you go to sell wood?\u201d</p><p>He looked up from his plate, meeting her eyes quizzically, lifting his good eyebrow. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf it wouldn\u2019t be too much trouble, I\u2019d like a ride into town. I should call my sister. I had that nurse, Mel, call her and tell her I was here with you and there was no phone, and that I\u2019d call her myself when I got to town. I should do that, so she doesn\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis would be the sister who thinks you\u2019re reckless and crazy?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She smiled at him. \u201cThe same.\u201d</p><p>He leaned against the back of his chair, leaving his spoon to rest on his plate of stew over rice. \u201cIf you\u2019re feeling better, you should think about going home. You found me, you told me what you wanted to tell me.\u201d</p><p>She chewed her lip for a minute. Then she lifted her bright green eyes to his face. \u201cIan, I need your help here. I\u2019m not saying this so you feel sorry for me\u2014it\u2019s not necessary. But I was losing Bobby for a long time and I really thought that by the time he passed, I\u2019d be ready for the next stage in my life. For three years I wondered what I\u2019d do when he was gone. I thought about the possibilities\u2014school, travel, maybe dating. Have my mornings and evenings free for...For whatever. But it\u2019s not working for me. He\u2019s been gone a year and I\u2019m totally stuck. I don\u2019t want to do any of the things I considered. I can\u2019t seem to move on, and it\u2019s not just grief. It\u2019s like there\u2019s unfinished business. Being here with you\u2014it\u2019s the right thing\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still here because you were sick!\u201d he said in a very annoyed tone.</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, I haven\u2019t been too sick to appreciate getting to know you again. It\u2019s like getting reacquainted. It feels like it\u2019s helping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReacquainted? What are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>She looked down. \u201cI knew you. Not like Bobby did\u2014but in his letters he talked about you, and then we had a few letters, you and me. I felt like we knew each other. Like we were friends. You\u2019re the link\u2014\u201d</p><p>The palms of his hands came down on the tabletop hard enough to make her jump. \u201cBut I don\u2019t want to go over all that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know!\u201d she shouted back at him. \u201cJesus, have I asked you to do that? You can be so damned obstinate sometimes! How the hell did you get by all this time without having anyone to fight with, huh? I know you have issues\u2014but do you suppose you could think of someone besides yourself for five seconds? We talk and it\u2019s helping me put some stuff in perspective. If you want me to go, I\u2019ll go. But if you\u2019ll just let me stay a little while, till I feel\u2014Shit.\u201d She ran a hand through her wild, fiery tresses. \u201cTill I don\u2019t know when! Till I feel this part of my unfinished business is finished. I\u2019ll be glad to buy the food or help with chores or whatever\u2014I just can\u2019t drive into town to call my sister because the bug doesn\u2019t have chains or snow tires.\u201d She took a breath. She swallowed. \u201cThat\u2019s all I have to say.\u201d</p><p>One corner of his mouth lifted. \u201cAre you sure that\u2019s all you have to say?\u201d</p><p>She leaned back and eyed him warily. \u201cFor now.\u201d</p><p>The other corner of his mouth lifted slightly. \u201cYou\u2019re one stubborn little broad, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTold you,\u201d she said, lifting her chin. And she thought, It\u2019s probably what got me through the worst of it.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to buy food or do chores. I just can\u2019t figure out how a grumpy old guy like me helps you with anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d she said, a little mollified and somewhat confused, \u201cit\u2019s because of the way\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTomorrow I deliver wood. I\u2019ll go early with a load, come back empty and reload. I can take you to town then. It\u2019ll take me a couple hours to deliver that load, then I\u2019ll pick you up in town. You\u2019ll be okay in town for that long? Where will you go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll sit in Jack\u2019s bar and drink coffee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake your medicine first. That cough gets scary.\u201d</p><p>She smiled very happily. \u201cThank you, Ian.\u201d And that\u2019s when she knew. He might fight it, but he needed to go over the details of the past as much as she did. The more he acted out against it, the more obvious it became\u2014he had a lot to get off his chest. They\u2019d get to that in time. Then she\u2019d show him Bobby\u2019s letter, give him the silly baseball cards and go home feeling lighter. Better.</p><p>Seven</p><p>I an pulled into Virgin River and stopped in front of the tree. My God, what a tree, he thought. Decorated for the troops, obviously. And while it looked as if the trimming was complete, the cherry picker still stood behind it.</p><p>\u201cLook for me in two and a half hours,\u201d he said to Marcie. \u201cI don\u2019t want to have to try to find you.\u201d</p><p>She glanced at her watch. \u201cI\u2019ll be waiting,\u201d she said. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>He just nodded. But he watched her walk up the steps to the porch of the bar and then pulled slowly out of town.</p><p>It was very hard for him to admit it to himself, but having her around had brought him a strange comfort, and he had no idea why. Looking out for her made him feel better somehow. Making sure she was fed and protected against danger\u2014that seemed to work for him, too. It was a lot of trouble, actually. If she hadn\u2019t been around, he wouldn\u2019t go to as much bother with meals. Three out of four nights he\u2019d just open a can of something, but because she\u2019d been sick and needed a hot meal he\u2019d put his best foot forward. Plus, she needed to put on another few pounds. He had spent a lot of time wondering if searching for him, sleeping in her car and probably skipping meals had made her thin and weak.</p><p>Knowing she was going to be there when he got home, pestering and bothering him, made him hurry a little bit through his work, his chores. He couldn\u2019t figure out why\u2014he was damn sure not going to go over all that old business about the war, about Bobby. Just thinking about that stuff put a boulder in his gut and made his head ache. And yet, he had a ridiculous fear that this phone call to her sister would result in her saying, \u201cI have to go home now.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But there was no use worrying about it\u2014she\u2019s going to leave soon no matter what the sister says. It\u2019s not as though she\u2019d camp out in his cabin through the holidays\u2014she had people at home. Never mind her grousing about her sister, at least she had a sister who loved her, cared about her. And what had she said when she asked for a ride to town? Just a little while longer...</p><p>It was the first relationship he\u2019d had in about four years. Old Raleigh didn\u2019t count\u2014that had been pure servitude. If the man hadn\u2019t left him part of a mountain, Ian would never have suspected Raleigh was even slightly grateful for the caretaking in the last months. Ian saw people regularly\u2014he worked for the moving company when the weather was good, had his firewood route, went places like the library, had a meal out now and then. People were nice to him, and he was cordial in return. But he never got close; there had been no relationships. No one poked at him like she did, making him smile in spite of himself.</p><p>That business with the puma\u2014her opening the outhouse door and yelling at him like that\u2014he knew what that was about. She was afraid he\u2019d get hurt by the cat and risked her own skin to warn him. Been a long damn time since he felt anyone really cared about him at all.</p> <p>Maybe that was it, he thought. Marcie thinks she cares, and it\u2019s because I was important to Bobby. If we\u2019d just met somehow, it wouldn\u2019t be like this.</p><p>But that didn\u2019t matter to him right now. He liked the feeling, alien though it was. He\u2019d be back for her in two and a half hours and while he was delivering a half a cord to some dentist in Fortuna he\u2019d watch the time so he wouldn\u2019t be late getting back to pick her up. And with every split log he stacked, he\u2019d be hoping her family wouldn\u2019t find a way to get her home right away.</p><p>It was just nine-thirty in the morning when Marcie walked into the bar, and there was no one around. She heard voices in the kitchen. She was going to have to go back there to use the phone anyway, but as she pushed the swinging door slowly open, she knocked on it a couple of times before she entered.</p><p>\u201cYeah, c\u2019mon back,\u201d someone said. That response was accompanied by a woman\u2019s laughter.</p><p>There were four people gathered around the work island. Two couples. There was the cook, Preacher, and Paige, the woman who\u2019d been helping to decorate the tree that first day. And then there was the local cop, Mike, and a very beautiful woman about thirty years old with light brown hair that went all the way to her waist. Mike was wearing an apron that was covered in red and green icing. \u201cHey,\u201d he said, grinning at her. \u201cMarcie. Did you find your marine?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWow,\u201d she said, astonished. \u201cMel really doesn\u2019t say anything.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cI found him almost a week ago.\u201d</p><p>They all just exchanged knowing glances. Each one chuckled. Apparently they all knew Mel quite well. \u201cDo you know everyone here?\u201d Mike asked.</p><p>\u201cPreacher, Paige, you...\u201d</p><p>He put his arm around the beautiful woman and she leaned into him. \u201cThis is Brie, Jack\u2019s sister.\u201d He nuzzled her neck. \u201cMy girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you do?\u201d Marcie said, suddenly envious of all the love in the world.</p><p>Brie nodded and smiled. \u201cPleasure,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cSo. How is he? Your guy?\u201d Mike asked.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s good,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s been living out on the top of a mountain for almost four years now. It\u2019s pretty rustic\u2014but I\u2019ve never seen anything so beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he was glad to see you?\u201d Mike asked.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes,\u201d she lied. \u201cPretty much. As long as we don\u2019t have to talk about his experiences in Iraq, we\u2019re good company for each other.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cHe\u2019s letting me stay a little while. Well,\u201d she said, looking down. \u201cI caught a bad...cold. And he was stuck with me. So I\u2019m taking advantage of him.\u201d She looked up and smiled. \u201cHe\u2019s being very patient about it. Listen, I need to make a collect call. I promised to check in with my sister every couple of days and Ian doesn\u2019t have a phone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHelp yourself,\u201d Preacher said. \u201cDial direct\u2014we have one of those deals with the phone company\u2014unlimited long distance for a monthly rate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack has four sisters and a father. Paige has girlfriends,\u201d he said with a shrug. \u201cWe make a lot of calls. Yours is free as long as it\u2019s in the U.S. Just go for it.\u201d</p><p>Paige stepped around the worktable. \u201cMarcie, if you could use a little privacy, you\u2019re welcome to call from our apartment.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t mind?\u201d Marcie returned.</p><p>\u201cNot at all,\u201d she said. \u201cCome with me. I\u2019ll show you where.\u201d</p><p>Marcie started to follow Paige, then turned back toward the group. \u201cYou\u2019re making Christmas cookies?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cPaige and Brie were,\u201d Mike said. \u201cThey\u2019re having some kind of women\u2019s thing here today. I\u2019m just doing this so they have someone to make fun of. I\u2019m much better with a taco. And I can make some mean carne asada.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFortunately we have our cookies done,\u201d Brie said with a laugh. \u201cMike can eat his own mess. He\u2019s pathetic. Who ever heard of a person who can\u2019t even frost a Christmas tree cookie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRules,\u201d Preacher said. \u201cThe men can\u2019t help with this because they all know I\u2019m the best cookie wrangler in the business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, Marcie,\u201d Paige said, pulling on her hand. \u201cThe phone\u2019s right in here.\u201d</p><p>Marcie let herself be led into a small efficiency apartment\u2014a bedroom and living area right behind the kitchen. Paige pointed to a cordless phone on a side table between a leather sofa and chair. \u201cHelp yourself,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cThank you. You live here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh. This was Jack\u2019s place before he married Mel and moved out to her cabin. Then I married John and...\u201d</p><p>\u201cJohn?\u201d Marcie asked.</p><p>\u201cOh, everyone calls him Preacher, but his name is John. John Middleton. And I\u2019m Paige Middleton,\u201d she said, beaming proudly. \u201cNow make your call, and then we\u2019ll have some coffee and cookies. We\u2019ll send some home with you.\u201d</p><p>Then Paige pulled the door closed, leaving Marcie alone.</p><p>This was amazing, Marcie thought. She\u2019d never been around people like this before. They were generous and sweet to a fault. Didn\u2019t they worry that she\u2019d rifle through their closets and drawers? They didn\u2019t know her at all, knew virtually nothing about her, and yet they were all about helping her, accommodating her.</p><p>She sighed deeply. Ian should be around people like this a little more. He was turning into an old curmudgeon before his time. She lifted the phone and called Erin\u2019s office.</p><p>Erin\u2019s secretary answered, but explained that Erin was in court. Marcie actually let out a relieved breath. \u201cThat\u2019s okay, Barb. Will you tell her I called, that I\u2019m fine and enjoying my visit very much and will try her again in a couple of days? I\u2019d sure appreciate that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd everything is working out for you?\u201d Barb asked.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely. Perfect. But I\u2019m staying with a friend out in the mountains and there\u2019s no phone. I can only call when I come into town. So, it\u2019ll be another couple of days before I can try her again. But tell her it\u2019s just beautiful here and I\u2019m having a good time.\u201d</p><p>And then, given the no-charge situation, she called Drew\u2019s cell phone. He picked up on the third ring. \u201cDrew,\u201d she said in a breath. \u201cDrew, I found him!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is the rumor,\u201d he said, chuckling. \u201cYou okay, Marce?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m very okay,\u201d she said, but then unexpectedly she coughed. And coughed again. \u201cSorry,\u201d she apologized. \u201cI do have a cough\u2014but I saw the town doctor and have some cough medicine. Nothing to worry about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t exactly sound great, Marcie. Are you sleeping in a heated house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d She laughed. \u201cAnd he made me chicken soup and everything. Are you in class? Can I tell you about him without you freaking out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI stepped out of class\u2014the guy\u2019s just reading the syllabus anyway. Why would you worry about me freaking out? What\u2019s wrong with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. He\u2019s a good person. Kind and tenderhearted, but a little grumpy if the conversation gets too close to the war. So...we stay away from that for now. But, Drew, he\u2019s something else! No wonder I couldn\u2019t find him\u2014he has a ponytail and a huge, bushy beard that grew in red. Not as red as me, but his hair is brown and his beard is more red than brown. He\u2019s been up here all alone for a long time now\u2014since he got out of the Marines. He has a couple of jobs, hunts and fishes, chops wood. I\u2019m getting to know him and I like him.\u201d</p><p>And then the thought came suddenly: I do. I really like him.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Drew said slowly. \u201cYou\u2019re out of town, isolated, staying with this guy who has no phone, this guy who gets a little grumpy if\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re having a good time together and there\u2019s nothing weird about him, unless you count an awful lot of hair. But around here, that\u2019s not so unusual. And in this town there are a lot of marines. They kind of all look out for me in a way, checking to be sure everything is okay.\u201d That was a white lie\u2014Mel did the checking, but clearly all the men were interested and cared. \u201cAnd everything is fine.\u201d</p><p>Drew took a breath. \u201cAnd you\u2019re coming home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSoon,\u201d she said. \u201cI haven\u2019t had a chance to tell him some things I want to tell him\u2014you know, about the letter, the baseball cards. And I want to know...\u201d She wanted to know why he ran off like that, leaving everything he loved behind. \u201cI want to know some things.\u201d</p><p>Drew\u2019s voice became fatherly. \u201cAnd if he doesn\u2019t want to tell you the things you want to know? You\u2019ll thank him politely and come home?\u201d</p><p>She should\u2019ve answered more quickly. It took her two long seconds before she said, \u201cOf course, Drew. He\u2019s a good person. I don\u2019t want to hurt him. I\u2019d just like it if he told me some things about my husband, about his situation. But if he won\u2019t, I\u2019ll leave him alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cErin\u2019s going nuts,\u201d Drew said. \u201cShe\u2019s on the verge of frantic. If she weren\u2019t so controlled all the time, she\u2019d be biting her nails and tearing at her hair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI tried to call her. Tell her that\u2014I tried to call her, but she\u2019s in court so I called you.\u201d She smiled to herself\u2014great family negotiating! She hadn\u2019t really called Drew because Erin was in court, but because talking to Drew would feel good. \u201cYou can tell her everything\u2014and that I\u2019ll call again in a couple of days. Okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething about this isn\u2019t really\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything is better than I imagined,\u201d she broke in. \u201cI\u2019ll be back in touch and, in the meantime, try to get Erin on some medication. Really, I hate carrying around the burden of her worry. I want to get done what I want to get done. It\u2019s why I came up here.\u201d</p><p>Drew sighed. \u201cI know,\u201d he said. \u201cI understand, even if I don\u2019t love it.\u201d</p><p>She laughed softly. \u201cGo back to class. I\u2019ll talk to you again soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove you, pet,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cLove you, baby brother.\u201d And she hung up the phone.</p><p>She sat quietly for a moment, relaxed in the soft tan leather of the chair. They didn\u2019t really understand what this had to do with her, but God they loved her enough to care what was happening, to be a little afraid she was making a mistake in putting herself in this strange man\u2019s care. Erin\u2019s love could be sometimes overbearing, based as it had so often been with concern, but balanced with Drew\u2019s boyish good humor she knew how lucky she was to have them. Without their love, she would be so empty inside. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>They had no idea how much she missed them, how much she wished she could be home with them just sailing through the holidays as though nothing was missing. And this Christmas, it wasn\u2019t just that Bobby was missing; she\u2019d already had her first Christmas without Bobby. Ian was missing, too\u2014and she had to put all that together.</p><p>The bar was full of women, at least twenty of them, when Marcie stepped through the kitchen door. They had baskets, boxes, tins and large platters covered in plastic wrap laid out on the tables. They held mugs of coffee and tea and chattered happily. Marcie stood in the doorway looking into the room. This would be the women\u2019s thing that had been spoken of; this would preclude her sitting in the bar until Ian could return for her. She\u2019d have to find something to do.</p><p>\u201cThere you are,\u201d Paige said. \u201cYou must have had a nice chat with your sister.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUm, I couldn\u2019t reach my sister so I called my brother,\u201d Marcie said.</p><p>\u201cYou have a brother, too? Oh\u2014you\u2019re so lucky. Are you close with them?\u201d</p><p>She willed herself not to get teary. \u201cVery,\u201d she said, giving a nod.</p><p>\u201cHow wonderful.\u201d Paige reached for her hand. \u201cCome and meet some of the women,\u201d she said, pulling her along into the room. \u201cThis is their Christmas cookie exchange. Some of these women are world-class bakers\u2014but don\u2019t tell John. He thinks no one can outbake him, but believe me, they\u2019re incredible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I shouldn\u2019t intrude....\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t be silly\u2014you\u2019re completely welcome. Unless...I mean, if you have somewhere to go...\u201d</p><p>All she could do was shake her head. \u201cIt\u2019s just that...Of course I have no cookies.\u201d</p><p>Paige just laughed. \u201cNeither does Mel. Mel can barely boil water. I made my cookies in the bar\u2019s kitchen, and so did Brie, but Mel just said \u2018Oh, the hell with it\u2014there\u2019s no use pretending.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Right at that moment, from across the room, Mel spotted Paige and Marcie and came right over. \u201cOh good, you came to town! This has to beat sitting out at the cabin by yourself. And what a great morning to be here\u2014you can meet some of the neighbors. And don\u2019t hesitate to sample. How about some coffee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be so great,\u201d Marcie said. \u201cIt\u2019s just that I feel like I might be a party crasher.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot in this town,\u201d Mel said with a laugh. \u201cPeople are always happy to meet someone new. Otherwise it\u2019s the same old faces.\u201d</p> <p>Paige pressed a cup of fresh, steaming coffee into Marcie\u2019s hand and then Mel pulled her into the room full of women. Marcie made the acquaintance of many\u2014Connie, who ran the town store, Joy who managed the library, Hope McCrea, whom she recognized from the tree-trimming, Lilly Anderson and her daughters and daughters-in-law. Lilly wore a knitted stocking cap pulled tight over her head and Marcie couldn\u2019t help but notice dark circles under her eyes, yet her smile was so warm and full of life. When Mel pulled Marcie away she whispered, \u201cChemo. She\u2019s lost her hair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, how sad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s fighting hard\u2014don\u2019t be sad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you just tell a medical secret?\u201d Marcie asked.</p><p>Mel shook her head. \u201cLilly likes me to explain for her when I can.\u201d</p><p>And then there were more women\u2014ranchers\u2019 wives, a woman who, along with her husband, owned a vineyard, a couple of women from a neighboring town. Of course they asked Marcie what had brought her to Virgin River. She tossed it out there, pure and simple. \u201cWell, my husband was critically wounded in Iraq, he was a marine, and he died last year. I heard his best friend from the Corps lived around here and I came to find him. Deliver the news. Get to know him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd did you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did,\u201d she said with a smile. \u201cHe lives in a cabin on a mountaintop. He dropped me off in town today while he delivers firewood to some of his customers and will pick me up in another hour. He\u2019s been...He is...I like this place,\u201d she finally said. \u201cI love your tree!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMel, Paige and Brie came up with the idea. Even though these local marines are out of the action now, they still feel close to the men and women who serve,\u201d someone said.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll fix you up a sample plate to take back to him,\u201d someone else offered.</p><p>\u201cOh, you shouldn\u2019t...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he\u2019d like that, wouldn\u2019t he?\u201d Mel asked her. \u201cBecause it would make the women feel good. Visit a while\u2014I\u2019ll supervise.\u201d And that fast, Mel was gone, leaving Marcie on her own.</p><p>She only suffered a second of discomfort before there was someone beside her, chatting with her. They asked her about her hometown, her late husband, her job and family. It had been in her mind to ask the questions to keep them talking, but it didn\u2019t work that way\u2014she was the newcomer, and they were curious.</p><p>A large plastic plate covered in plastic was pressed into her hands\u2014a collection from all the other plates in the room\u2014Santas and trees and ornaments; lemon bars, chocolate crispies, brownies; thin slices of specialty breads, lots of assorted treats.</p><p>And then the room fell silent as a young woman entered the bar. She was tall with long reddish-gold hair; she carried a box of cookies and she was very pregnant. Her smile was shy and she looked down in the silence. Stepping into the room behind her was a very tall man. He was also shy, Marcie thought, noting the man seemed a little uncomfortable.</p><p>But in just a moment the awkward silence seemed to pass and the women in the room surrounded her, embracing her, kissing her cheeks. Mel had an arm around her and held her hand, bringing her into the room. Once she\u2019d greeted everyone, she went about the business of offering her cookies and putting together a sampling of the others to take home to her family.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Vanessa,\u201d a voice said.</p><p>Marcie turned and looked into Brie\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cHer husband was killed in Iraq a couple of weeks ago. Her baby is due soon\u2014another six weeks or so, I guess. She\u2019s staying with her father and brother just out of town.\u201d</p><p>Marcie swallowed. \u201cAnd the man with her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPaul Haggerty, her late husband\u2019s best friend since childhood. He\u2019s stayed on since the funeral because Vanessa asked him to. Wherever you see Vanessa, Paul will not be far away. He\u2019s completely devoted to her through this difficult time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s...so good of him,\u201d Marcie said weakly. She felt a pang of longing.</p><p>\u201cPaul\u2019s one of Jack, Mike and Preacher\u2019s oldest friends. These guys\u2014they really hang tight. And they\u2019re always close at hand for the family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe looks very sad,\u201d Marcie observed.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no question about that,\u201d Brie said. \u201cI\u2019m sure his pain is equal to hers. He was best friends with Matt since about the eighth grade.\u201d Then she took a breath. \u201cThank God that baby\u2019s coming. What a blessing. Would you like to meet her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet her be with her friends,\u201d Marcie said quickly. \u201cIt can\u2019t have been easy for her to come out like this so soon after...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Then excuse me,\u201d Brie said. \u201cI need to go give her a squeeze. I\u2019ll be back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Marcie said. \u201cPlease, take your time.\u201d</p><p>But the women in the room were consumed with Vanessa while Paul stood patiently near the door, never far away. After about twenty minutes, Vanessa returned to Paul with her collection of cookies and he slipped an arm around her waist as they exited the bar.</p><p>Leaving her own cookies on the bar, Marcie followed them out. They were just at the bottom of the porch steps when Marcie cleared her throat and said, softly, \u201cExcuse me...Vanessa?\u201d</p><p>They both turned and Marcie forced herself to step forward. \u201cI\u2019m...ah...so sorry for your loss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said, smiling sweetly though her eyes were sad. Paul never let go of her. \u201cI don\u2019t know you, do I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m just visiting. I\u2019m also the widow of a marine,\u201d she managed. \u201cHappened about a year ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d Vanessa said, suddenly her emotions shifting from her own loss to Marcie\u2019s. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you. My husband was critically wounded in Iraq four years ago and died last year. And when I heard...Vanessa, I remember when the grief was so fresh and painful. I wish I could say something that would help you now.\u201d</p><p>She smiled so kindly, Marcie thought. Then Vanessa\u2019s hand came out and touched Marcie\u2019s red curls. \u201cI think you just did. It was nice of you to say anything at all. I know you didn\u2019t have to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I sure did have to,\u201d Marcie said, feeling the sting of tears in her own eyes. \u201cI remember so plainly how hard it is at first. I\u2019m so glad for you, that you have good friends to help, that you have a baby coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo children?\u201d Vanessa asked.</p><p>Marcie just shook her head. And then she heard the rough motor of Ian\u2019s old truck pulling into town. She resisted the urge to look at her watch.</p><p>Vanessa opened her arms to Marcie and Marcie stepped into the embrace. Vanessa held her and Marcie felt her tears run. There were so many reasons\u2014the woman had lost her young husband, she was pregnant, the husband\u2019s best friend was there for her, and then\u2014</p><p>Marcie laughed through tears. \u201cI felt the baby kick,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a boy,\u201d Vanessa said. \u201cAnd he\u2019s very active, thank God.\u201d</p><p>Marcie pulled back and wiped her eyes. \u201cThere\u2019s my ride,\u201d she said. \u201cGodspeed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you. What was your name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarcie Sullivan. I\u2019m just here for a visit. I\u2019ll be going home to Chico soon, to have the holidays with my brother and sister, with my husband\u2019s family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, enjoy your visit. And Merry Christmas. Thank you for your kindness.\u201d</p><p>And then she watched as Paul helped Vanessa into the passenger seat of a big SUV.</p><p>Marcie held up a finger to Ian, indicating he should give her a minute. She ran back into the bar, gathered up her cookies and said a few quick goodbyes. Then she clambered into Ian\u2019s truck. He was driving out of town before he asked, \u201cMission accomplished?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy sister was tied up, so I talked to my younger brother. He\u2019ll pass on the word that everything is fine. And my timing was great\u2014I stumbled into a Christmas cookie exchange. They insisted on making up a plate of samples to take home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmph,\u201d he answered. \u201cI guess you made friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA few. Very nice people in this town\u2014you should give them a chance sometime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat woman?\u201d he asked. \u201cOne of your new friends?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe one I was hugging?\u201d Marcie asked, for clarification.</p><p>\u201cShe was the only one I saw besides you,\u201d he answered.</p><p>\u201cVanessa. I didn\u2019t get the last name. She lost her husband in Iraq a couple of weeks ago. I didn\u2019t know her, but I gave my condolences anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe man wasn\u2019t her husband?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe man was...\u201d Her late husband\u2019s best friend, she wanted to say. Instead, she said, \u201cJust a good friend, as I understood it.\u201d</p><p>Eight</p><p>O ne day tended to run into the next when you didn\u2019t get up and go to work, or have a TV set that kept you oriented with the news and regular shows. Marcie never knew if it was Tuesday or Saturday, but it didn\u2019t matter. Ian seemed to work seven days a week. Even though she felt completely over her flu\u2014except for the cough that haunted her\u2014she still tended to sleep late in the morning. The cabin stayed dark longer, given the shorter number of daylight hours, and Ian crept out silently. Sometimes she would hear the engine of his truck\u2014an engine that could be grumpy as he was\u2014and she\u2019d just roll over and go back to sleep for a while. When she finally roused, Ian would be gone and she\u2019d putter around, eat something, put a couple of logs in the stove, read one of his library books, which, frankly, often bored the enamel off her teeth. If she wanted to read a biography, it would more likely be of some remarkable woman. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But on this morning, the day after the Christmas cookie exchange, she rolled over to find Ian standing by the table, looking very different. He had on a navy-blue denim jacket rather than his old worn work jacket. He wore khakis and boots that weren\u2019t beat to hell. The shirt beneath the jacket was white. \u201cI\u2019m going to be out for a while. You\u2019ll be okay? You\u2019re feeling all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good. Feeling back to normal. Are you going to sell firewood? Isn\u2019t it late for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething else this morning. But I\u2019ll be back early.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIan, where are you going?\u201d she asked, sitting up.</p><p>He glanced away for just a second and then, coming closer to the couch, he said, \u201cI\u2019m going to church. I do that once in a while. I\u2019ll be back\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou belong to a church?\u201d she asked, straightening in surprise.</p><p>\u201cNo. No, no. I just drop in sometimes. Different ones. It doesn\u2019t matter which one, not really.\u201d</p><p>She was at full attention. \u201cWhat denomination are you?\u201d she asked.</p> <p>\u201cNone. Really. I wasn\u2019t even raised in a church\u2014we weren\u2019t religious. It\u2019s just a little thing I do. Not regularly. I\u2019ll be back in\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, can I go with you?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cMarcie,\u201d he groaned, drawing it out almost painfully. \u201cLet\u2019s not do that...\u201d</p><p>But she jumped off the couch, nearly knocking him over as she grabbed up a pair of jeans from the top of her duffel. \u201cI don\u2019t have any really nice clothes...Just jeans and boots, but last time I went to church, it was pretty casual. Not many people dress up anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should stay home\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t be any trouble at all.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cListen, can I be straight with you here?\u201d</p><p>She pulled up her jeans quickly, not even thinking he might have caught a flash of her panties in the process until he turned away. \u201cThat would be fun\u2014you being straight with me for once.\u201d She ripped his shirt over her head and dug around in her duffel for her best sweater.</p><p>Without looking at her, he said, \u201cI go in real quiet, late, sit in the back. I\u2019m not unfriendly. I say hello and God bless and move on. People don\u2019t remember me\u2014I don\u2019t show up at the same church even twice a year. I don\u2019t want to belong to a church or anything\u2014I just want to hear the music sometimes. I\u2019m not a joiner\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you\u2019re a loner. I know this...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like the solitude, I do\u2014but I see people all the time. I just live alone\u2014and I don\u2019t belong to a church or a union or anything. That\u2019s all. I go to listen. Maybe there\u2019s something in it. I\u2019m open to inspiration.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. That\u2019s fine. I\u2019ll say hello and God bless,\u201d she said, pulling her sweater over her head. She looked down at herself\u2014all wrinkled. He turned around to find her completely changed. She sat on the sofa and pulled her boots over black socks. From the look on his face, if she took much more time in dressing, he\u2019d be gone without her.</p><p>\u201cNo. No, it won\u2019t work. You\u2019re the kind of person people will want to talk to. You like making friends, getting connected and I don\u2019t. I\u2019ll just stay home and\u2014\u201d</p><p>She ran to the sink, pumped a little water to wet her hands. She ran them over her wild curls to calm them a bit. \u201cTake me, too, Ian. I won\u2019t even sit with you. I\u2019ll pretend I don\u2019t know you. You can act like I\u2019m some poorly dressed homeless person who just happens to be there the same time as you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAw, Marcie\u2014I wish I hadn\u2019t even told you the truth. How about I bring you a book from the library? You tell me what you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to the library? Oh God, please please please can you take me with you? Ian, I\u2019ve hardly been anywhere since I found your cabin! I don\u2019t have to talk to people. Really! But for God\u2019s sake, don\u2019t make me read another biography or whatever you pick out for me. I won\u2019t sit with you at the church and I\u2019ll be quiet at the library! God, I just want to go out and do something around people\u2014I spent a month looking for you and talked to people all day till I hated talking to them! Now if I could just be in the world for a while...I promise\u2014I won\u2019t make you uncomfortable. If I do one thing wrong, you can growl and roar at me all you want.\u201d And then she coughed.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still sick. Listen to you.\u201d</p><p>She caught her breath. \u201cIt\u2019s because you got me worked up. Really, I\u2019m all right. Mel said I was fine. She checked me over, said I\u2019m not contagious and that it\u2019s not uncommon to have that cough a while. Please. Please. Please!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoddamn it,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>She smiled at him. \u201cNice language for someone on his way to church.\u201d</p><p>Ian didn\u2019t talk the entire way into Fortuna. He stared stonily ahead and Marcie decided that since she had begged her way along, she\u2019d better stay quiet and do exactly as she\u2019d promised. When they pulled up to a Presbyterian church, she walked ahead of him into the building, took a program and found a seat in a pew in the back. Not surprisingly, Ian sat across the aisle from her in his own pew, acting as if he didn\u2019t know her.</p><p>Well, he wanted to be alone. And so this way he could be. She wasn\u2019t about to let his peculiarities work her up. So she just listened to the scriptures, the choir. The sermon.</p><p>It was mid December, time to start examining the story of the birth of Christ. She usually didn\u2019t go to church at Christmas until it was closer to the actual day and she always enjoyed the story\u2014the stable, the birth, the shepherds and wise men...</p><p>\u201cOne of the things that interests me year-round\u2014as a Christian, as a theologian, as a human being\u2014is that star,\u201d the minister said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of conjecture as to whether it was an actual astronomical event or something divinely created to announce the birth of Christ. You\u2019ll expect me to tell you that it is my belief, from scripture, that it was the latter. What\u2019s more important to me is not whether it was nature in motion, or a Godly miracle, but what it means to us today. It\u2019s a symbol of Christianity that reigns second only to the cross. It is a gift of light, of guidance, of leadership, of passage and understanding and illumination.</p><p>\u201cHave you ever been driven to do something, but lacked direction? Have you ever been one of those people who didn\u2019t pray too often but were in sudden, desperate need of help and found yourself on your knees? The star is faith. A belief that a power greater than ourselves will, given the opportunity, lead us to our destination. The star is meaning, purpose, promise that we\u2019ll be given divine illumination. That our way will be filled with the light of understanding and keep us from stumbling. That is the miracle of the star.</p><p>\u201cAs we enter a season of loving, healing, forgiving...a season of promise...so many of us will look to the heavens for that star. I think, sometimes, that star is in our hearts as well.\u201d</p><p>He talked a little about the wise men, the kings, and the shepherds who left their flocks. They were driven. They had a task, a goal. As men, they were so different, the simple shepherds, the kings, but it\u2019s not only rich men who are driven or poor men who follow a calling. They simply responded to a gut reaction, to a mission that had to be fulfilled for their good, for the savior they were compelled to welcome to the world, for the well-being of all. It must have been a driving force, impossible to ignore, though to those around them, it might have seemed foolish. Or even crazy. Imagine these kings packing up and traipsing across the country on some harebrained idea that there was a special infant\u2014coming to save the world, to heal mankind\u2014born in a stable far away. Their servants and soldiers must have thought they had lost it.</p><p>Then came the star\u2014guiding them. Leading them.</p><p>\u201cIs there something,\u201d the pastor asked his congregation, \u201cwe feel compelled to do in this season of giving, this season of rebirth? Do people around us suggest we mind our own business or let matters rest?\u201d</p><p>His words began to run together and Marcie wasn\u2019t sure how much of what she heard was the minister\u2019s sermon, and how much her own mind, her own heart. Is there something you are inexplicably driven to complete and you can no more stop yourself than you can turn back time? Is this a mission of mercy, meant for goodness and healing? For love and kindness? Because you have to ask yourself that. This is not a season to heal your own wounds at the expense of another\u2014but a time for rekindling love and moving ahead into a better world. Isn\u2019t that what the birth of Christ promised? A better world?</p><p>Then we have to ask ourselves\u2014do I see the way? Do I see\u2014do I feel the star in the east? Am I being led?</p><p>Marcie felt tears on her cheeks and clearly heard the pastor say, \u201cLet\u2019s all say a little prayer that gives God permission to guide us in the right direction, in doing good, mending hurts, healing hearts, asking for forgiveness. And then we\u2019ll sing.\u201d</p><p>But she was already praying, and not to God as she was supposed to be. Her prayer went out to someone else.</p><p>Oh, Bobby, help! Am I meant to be here? To do this? Because he\u2019s everything you said he was\u2014he\u2019s strong and invincible, and yet so tender, so sweet. So complicated, so simple. Sometimes I think of irrational things\u2014Jesus whipping the money changers in the temple in fierceness, in battle, and then feeding the hungry masses from five loaves and five fish.... If you could have seen him roar at me like I was the biggest threat, then feed that big buck right from his hand...I swear, the day the mountain lion came to the property, he shot over the cat so as not to harm it, though he could have killed it and maybe should have. He\u2019s good, Bobby, and he just can\u2019t do something like that without really...Oh, Bobby, if it\u2019s wrong for me to invade his world, disrupt his life and make him unhappy, please give me a sign. It\u2019s true, I want to bring him home, but I need him to bring me home! I swear to God, I only want to do the right thing, to feel that things are finally settled so we can all go on to the kind of lives you would have wanted for us. Please, Bobby, tell me! I\u2019ll pay attention....</p><p>And while her head was bowed, beseeching her dead husband instead of God, as she\u2019d been instructed, the congregation stood and belted out a hymn. It took her a moment to wipe her eyes and think, I\u2019m crazy as a loon. Praying to a man who\u2019s been dead for a year, who was lost to me years before that. Do I really think Bobby\u2019s going to give me an answer faster than God? What kind of nutjob am I?</p><p>She surreptitiously stole a look across the aisle at Ian. He stood straight and tall, all bushy and proud. And he wasn\u2019t singing! Of all the crazy things. This was one place his voice could not only be exercised but appreciated, yet he didn\u2019t sing. What a horrible waste. She was filled with a longing to hear him amaze the rest of this congregation with his glorious voice. Yet he was silent.</p><p>She sniffed back her tears. Maybe he wasn\u2019t all that wonderful. Maybe he was just plain selfish.</p><p>She had no idea why this whole episode\u2014so spiritually emotional for her\u2014would make her angry. And she didn\u2019t brood over it; she just told herself to get over it and go along as she\u2019d promised. At least until she figured things out.</p><p>When the hymn was finished, the benediction read and the pastor led the recessional, she was one of the first out of the church. She shook the pastor\u2019s hand and thanked him for a moving sermon.</p><p>\u201cMoved you a little much, I think, sister,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cTouched me, yes,\u201d she said, guarding herself not to sniff.</p><p>\u201cCome here,\u201d he said, pulling her into his arms and giving her a hug.</p><p>Oh, bad idea. If she didn\u2019t steel herself, she\u2019d start sobbing. It was his arms around her\u2014it weakened her. She\u2019d had a million comforting hugs since Bobby finally left them, but her hug tank had been on the low side lately. She desperately needed some reassurance, and as ridiculous as she felt about her prayerful plea to Bobby, it would have come as a comfort to feel his hand on her shoulder, telling her to move ahead, follow her heart.... </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThank you, pastor,\u201d she said, withdrawing herself. \u201cBeautiful sermon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen, I thank you. I lack confidence in getting them ready. They\u2019re a struggle. Come back and see us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d she said, removing herself.</p> <p>She went and waited by the truck, and while she was there, she watched Ian make his way to the pastor, shake his hand, speak to him, even laugh with him. And she thought\u2014there are two of him! He is that guy who seems so alone and a guy who\u2019s made his way in the world just fine. It\u2019s just that his world is a different kind of world; it\u2019s not that rushing, heavily populated world of demands and connections so many of us have. His is mostly a quiet world and his relationships seemed to be the same. The way he seemed to like it.</p><p>When she\u2019d been looking for him, she had asked probably a hundred people if they knew an Ian Buchanan and the answer had always been the same. \u201cName doesn\u2019t ring a bell.\u201d Ian probably made his way through life, friendly enough, without anyone asking his name, without him ever offering it.</p><p>When Ian got to the truck and fired it up, she asked, \u201cDid the pastor ask you your name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>So that was part of it. That and the fact he didn\u2019t look anything like the picture she\u2019d been flashing around. \u201cNo reason, just curious,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cI think we should have a nice, big breakfast. Do you feel like eating before we hit the library?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d she said quietly.</p><p>\u201cYou all right, Marcie?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cI think I got a little sentimental there for a minute. A good strong cup of coffee should do the trick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re in luck\u2014I know just the place.\u201d</p><p>It was a truck stop, of course. Ian was quite proud of the place. There must have been a dozen eighteen-wheelers parked outside and when he walked in, a middle-aged, heavyset, bleached-blond waitress said hello rather familiarly. \u201cHey, Bub\u2014you doing okay? Haven\u2019t seen you in a while.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDoing great, Patti,\u201d he answered. She wore a big name tag so Marcie couldn\u2019t assume they were friends. But Ian had been seen around after all\u2014in plenty of places. Coincidentally, none of the places she\u2019d been looking.</p><p>Patti poured their coffee and said, \u201cNeed a minute?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, give the lady some time to decide,\u201d he said.</p><p>After Patti had gone, Marcie said, \u201cI guess you must get the same thing every time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust about. Yeah,\u201d he admitted.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d She studied her menu. \u201cWhenever you\u2019re ready, I\u2019ll have a cheese omelet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds good,\u201d he said. He lifted his hand to Patti.</p><p>When she arrived he said, \u201cA cheese omelet for the lady, trim it, and for me\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFour eggs, side of bacon, side of sausage, hash browns, biscuits and gravy, wheat toast, orange juice and coffee till you float,\u201d she finished for him.</p><p>He smiled at Patti and it was most definitely a smile. If I were Patti, Marcie thought, I\u2019d think he wanted to ask me out on a date. But all Patti said was, \u201cGotcha, Bub.\u201d</p><p>By her first refill of coffee, Marcie started to get right with the world. Nothing straightened her out like caffeine, she thought. Hot coffee, not that stuff Ian left warming on the woodstove when he went to sell wood in the mornings. And this was good and strong. She came around. \u201cSo, are you and Patti friends?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cPatti\u2019s my waitress about once every two months,\u201d he said. \u201cShe does a good job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you sing in church?\u201d she asked boldly.</p><p>He put down his cup. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, don\u2019t make me act all conceited. I was in choir in high school. I was in our high school musical\u2014we did Grease. I have an okay voice. I don\u2019t want to join the choir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho were you in Grease?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>His hand went over his mouth and he mumbled something.</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d she asked, leaning closer.</p><p>His eyes came up. \u201cDanny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were the star! You were frickin\u2019 John Travolta, except you sing better!\u201d</p><p>His eyes shifted around nervously. \u201cYou just got a little loud there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d she said. \u201cSorry. But really...Have you ever studied music?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI studied military strategy. I thought you knew that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, sorry, brushing up against that forbidden territory. But Jesus, you sing like a god! Wouldn\u2019t that be something you\u2019d think about pursuing?\u201d</p><p>He was quiet for a long moment and finally said, \u201cI sing for myself. It\u2019s nice. It passes time. You\u2019re not going to save me, Marcie. You\u2019re not going to pull me out of the hills and turn me in to a rock star.\u201d</p><p>She was speechless. For a split second, that was exactly what she\u2019d had in mind. Not a rock star, exactly, but a famous singer at least. \u201cWell, it\u2019s just a stupid crime that you don\u2019t even have a radio,\u201d she said churlishly. \u201cNo matter where you live, you should have music around you.\u201d</p><p>And he laughed.</p><p>Their plates arrived, along with a check that Ian snapped up. She just stared at his huge breakfast with wide, startled eyes.</p><p>\u201cNow what?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cHoly smokes, do they see you pull into the parking lot and fire up the grill? That didn\u2019t take five minutes!\u201d</p><p>He curved his lips into a smile for her. \u201cI like that they\u2019re efficient. They work, they get the job done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she said. \u201cUm\u2014let me split the check. I have money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. Eighty dollars.\u201d He dug into his eggs.</p><p>\u201cReally, I\u2019d like to pay my share,\u201d she said.</p><p>He lifted a sausage patty off his plate and slid it onto hers. \u201cForget it, I\u2019ve got it. Try this, it\u2019s the best sausage patty you\u2019ll ever taste.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou obviously need a lot of fuel to do what you do,\u201d she commented. Then she tasted the patty. \u201cHmm, right. You\u2019re so right.\u201d</p><p>He plunged his fork into the large biscuit and gravy and held it out to her. \u201cHere. This is even better.\u201d</p><p>For a second she was still. He was feeding her right off his fork? Then before the mood could drift away, she leaned toward that fork and sampled the biscuit and gravy. She hummed in agreement, let her eyes drop closed in appreciation and when she opened them, he was smiling happily. There was something so intimate, so generous about that simple gesture, it touched her heart.</p><p>\u201cI knew you\u2019d like it. I can never finish everything. Help yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Ian,\u201d she said quietly.</p><p>When they pulled into the Eureka Public Library, she asked, \u201cCan we browse a little? Or are we in a hurry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow are you feeling? You coughed some.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel so much better doing something. I\u2019d like to pick up a couple of books to keep me busy while you sell firewood. And I\u2019m not sure what I want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake your time. I like to read the papers,\u201d he said.</p><p>And she did take her time, luxuriously. Roaming the stacks, picking up novels with pretty covers, reading the cover copy and then the first page, having a real hard time choosing. She sat on the floor in the crowded aisles, so happy to be in the midst of entertainment again. She\u2019d been reading classics to Bobby, more for herself than him, but her own tastes ran to newer romances. Deep, emotional romances with happy endings. Where things worked out. Whatever book she chose would have to be the right one; it was the only diversion she had. She had no idea how much time had passed when he said, \u201cYou just about ready?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh! Sure. Can I please have these three?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think you\u2019ll read that many before you leave?\u201d</p><p>She just smiled at him. \u201cYes,\u201d she said, knowing that was half an answer. Or less.</p><p>While Ian was checking out the books and then waiting by the door, Marcie was chatting it up with one of the librarians. They started off talking softly but very soon they were laughing, touching each other\u2019s arms as they whispered close. He cleared his throat once and both women looked at him. He treated them to a glower, then they just resumed their conversation, interspersed with soft laughter. It looked as though they\u2019d become best friends in just a short time.</p><p>Finally Marcie tore herself away from a hug and followed Ian to the truck. When they were inside, he was sulky. \u201cYou weren\u2019t going to get all involved. Hook up with people. All that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWell, that looked pretty cozy, back there. I told you\u2014you\u2019re the kind of person people want to get to know, talk to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Ian. I totally protected your anonymity. I told her you were my brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d he pouted. \u201cNow she\u2019s going to ask me about you. And I told you\u2014I\u2019m friendly and pleasant and then I move on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can do that. She\u2019ll find it perfectly understandable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh? And why\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, she wondered about you. Said you ask for some heavy reading sometimes, but that you didn\u2019t make much conversation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, really?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Marcie explained. \u201cI said you were brilliant, but not a very social animal. I said she shouldn\u2019t expect a lot of chitchat from you, but you were perfectly nice, and there was no reason to be shy around you\u2014you\u2019re safer than you look.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that so? And how did you convince her of that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEasy. I said you were an idiot savant\u2014brilliant in literature and many other things, but socially you weren\u2019t on your game.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Jesus Christ!\u201d</p><p>She noted the late-afternoon sky, the sun beginning to lower. \u201cIan, when was the last time you went out for a beer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeen a while,\u201d he grumbled miserably.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d so love to see that Christmas tree in Virgin River at night. Could we pass through there for a beer? By the time we\u2019ve had a beer, it might be dark. I should try calling my sister again before she comes hunting me down\u2014and there\u2019s that nice little bar there, with a phone I can use.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, Marcie...\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on. It\u2019s been such a perfect day. Let\u2019s end it on a positive note. Let me buy you a beer and maybe some of Preacher\u2019s dinner\u2014he cooks like a dream.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPreacher?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe cook in that little bar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t really like big crowds.\u201d</p><p>She laughed at him. \u201cIan, if the whole town turns out, there will be fewer people there than in that truck stop or in the church. Besides, you told me that you\u2019re around people all the time, you\u2019re just not a joiner. So come on. Man up.\u201d</p><p>It was barely five o\u2019clock when Marcie and Ian entered Jack\u2019s bar, and there were about twenty people there. Ian stood by the door and surveyed the new surroundings warily. He noted hunting and fishing trophies on the walls, the dim lighting, the welcoming fire. It didn\u2019t look threatening. While there were a couple of tables of people engaged in friendly conversation and laughter, there were also a couple of solitary men having a drink or a meal apart from the crowd. One he recognized as the old doctor, seated up at the bar and hovering over a drink, left entirely alone.</p><p>Marcie went right up to the bar, leaning on it, talking with the bartender. Ian spied an empty spot at the far end of the bar in the corner where he thought he\u2019d be comfortable. He approached Marcie\u2019s back, meaning to steer her there. As if she felt him come near, she turned and said, \u201cIan, meet Jack Sheridan. Jack, Ian.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cPleasure,\u201d Jack said. \u201cWhat can I get you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBottle or tap?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhatever\u2019s on tap,\u201d Ian said.</p><p>Jack drew the beer and said to Marcie, \u201cHelp yourself to the phone, Marcie. Preacher\u2019s back there.\u201d Then, she skipped away and Jack put the beer in front of Ian.</p><p>Ian picked it up and migrated down to the corner of the bar he\u2019d staked out. Then he watched with interest for several moments as Jack made a few drinks, polished some glasses, exchanged friendly banter with a couple of customers, arranged some bottles, took a tub of dirty glasses to the kitchen, and seemed to completely ignore Ian, the old doctor, and the other lone drinker at the opposite end of the bar. It was probably ten minutes\u2014Marcie must be having a very interesting conversation with her sister. How is she explaining me? he wondered to himself.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s that beer?\u201d Jack asked, dishtowel in hand, eyeing the nearly empty glass.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good,\u201d Ian said.</p> <p>\u201cJust let me know,\u201d he said, turning away.</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d Ian said, getting his attention but not exactly calling him back.</p><p>Jack turned, lifted an eyebrow. Silent.</p><p>\u201cShe tell you to leave me alone?\u201d</p><p>A small huff of laughter escaped Jack. \u201cPal, the first thing you learn when you open a bar\u2014talk if they talk, shut up if they don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Ian tilted his head. Maybe he could stand this place once in a while. \u201cShe tried to explain me to the librarian in Eureka as an idiot savant.\u201d Jack smiled and Ian felt an odd sensation\u2014it was a funny story; he liked sharing a funny story. He used to make the guys laugh when he wasn\u2019t making them work. \u201cShe tell you she was looking for me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe did.\u201d</p><p>For some reason unclear even to him, Ian did something he hadn\u2019t done since finding himself in these mountains\u2014he pushed on it a little bit. \u201cShe tell you anything about me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCouple of things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike, you and me\u2014we were in Fallujah about the same time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould\u2019ve known. You have that jarhead look about you. Just so you\u2019re clear\u2014I don\u2019t talk about that time.\u201d</p><p>Jack smiled lazily. \u201cJust so you\u2019re clear, neither do I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Erin,\u201d Marcie said into the phone. \u201cI\u2019m just checking in.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMarcie, good God, where have you been?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Marcie could just imagine Erin beginning to pace with the phone in her hand, something she did whenever she was stressed and not quite in control. \u201cYou know where I am. Right here, in Virgin River. I\u2019m staying not far from here. Didn\u2019t you get my messages? I talked to Drew and Mel Sheridan said she talked to you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome woman I\u2019ve never heard of and don\u2019t know called, yes,\u201d she said. \u201cShe says you\u2019re staying with him? You\u2019re actually staying with him? Someplace without even a phone?\u201d</p><p>Marcie sighed deeply. \u201cCalm down\u2014he doesn\u2019t need a phone. He lives in a perfectly comfortable cabin on a ridge with an incredible view and he sort of...invited me to stay if I wanted to...\u201d</p><p>\u201cSort of? If you wanted to? Marcie, what the hell\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you to listen to me, Erin. Listen and stop commanding. I found him, I want to get to know him, I want to understand him. Everything. I want to understand everything. And that takes time. And there\u2019s no place I have to be right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is making me nuts! My little sister, with some crazy stranger on an isolated mountain\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is not crazy! He\u2019s a good man! He\u2019s been very generous with me! I\u2019m completely safe, and there\u2019s nothing about this to make you concerned. He goes to work every day and in the evenings when he\u2019s back at the cabin, we talk a little bit. We\u2019re just getting to know each other. Today we went to church and to the library. Stop hovering\u2014you knew I was going to do this!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me talk to him,\u201d Erin said. \u201cPut him on the phone. I have a few questions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said in a panicked gasp. \u201cHe can\u2019t come to the phone\u2014he\u2019s out in the...the...restaurant. I\u2019m an adult, and he doesn\u2019t need your permission to invite me to stay in his cabin. You\u2019re going to have to trust me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not trust and you know it\u2014it\u2019s him! I don\u2019t know him, I only know that when you were up to your neck taking care of Bobby and Ian Buchanan was out of the Corps, he never even called to ask\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe saved Bobby\u2019s life,\u201d Marcie shot back. \u201cHe risked his life to save my husband. What more do I need to know? I want to thank him, I want to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSaying thank you should take about five minutes,\u201d Erin interrupted.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not talking about this anymore. I\u2019ll call you in a few days\u2014and work on calming down in the meantime. Erin, do not mess this up for me!\u201d She disconnected the line with an angry poke of one finger.</p><p>And looked up into those dark, brooding eyes of Preacher\u2019s. Beneath the scowl was a lift of his lips. \u201cWell,\u201d Preacher said. \u201cThat\u2019s a new twist to the story. He saved your husband\u2019s life? Hoorah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you knew,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cAll I knew was you\u2019re widowed,\u201d he said. \u201cHow about this guy? He seem an okay guy?\u201d</p><p>She took a breath. \u201cWild animals will eat out of his hand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat a fact?\u201d Preacher said. \u201cI trust wild animals more than a lot of tame men. You should stay for dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was hoping to, but why?\u201d she asked, thinking hard on the previous comment.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s meat loaf night,\u201d he said simply. \u201cIt\u2019s the best ever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd it\u2019s a special night. Mel, Jack\u2019s wife, she found the perfect topper for that tree and now we can finally return the cherry picker. Half the town\u2019s turning out for the lighting. Should\u2019ve come a lot sooner, but we couldn\u2019t do it until she was okay with the topper. The woman looked at every angel and sparkle-ball and star in three counties and rejected them all. But now she has it\u2014so we\u2019re going to fire it up. Next year, we\u2019ll get it done earlier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool.\u201d Marcie smiled. \u201cWhat time on the tree?\u201d</p><p>He looked at his watch. \u201cAbout an hour from now.\u201d</p><p>Nine</p><p>M arcie joined Ian at the bar and sat up beside him. Jack was there instantly. \u201cWhat can I get you?\u201d he asked with a wipe of the bar in front of her.</p><p>\u201cI think\u2014I\u2019d like a glass of wine. How about a nice merlot? And two meat loaf dinners. And whatever you do, do not let this guy get the check\u2014I invited him, and it\u2019s my treat. My turn. He\u2019s been feeding me since I got here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bet,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>Ian turned toward her. \u201cI\u2019m not sure about staying long...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you have an anxiety attack, we can go. But if you can hang in there a little while, I bet the meat loaf will amaze you. This cook, Preacher? He\u2019s unbelievable. I had some of his venison chili when I first got to town and it almost made me pass out, it was so good.\u201d</p><p>His lips curved in a smile. \u201cYou ate venison, Marcie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t have a relationship with the deer,\u201d she explained.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have a relationship with my deer either,\u201d he pointed out.</p><p>\u201cYeah, but I have a relationship with you\u2014you\u2019ve seen me in my underwear. And you have a relationship with the deer. If you fed him to me, it would be like you shot and fed me your friend. Or something.\u201d</p><p>Ian just drained his beer and smiled at her enough to show his teeth. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t shoot that particular buck,\u201d he admitted. \u201cBut if I had a freezer, I\u2019d shoot his brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something off about that,\u201d she said, just as Jack placed her wine in front of her. \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be more logical if hunters didn\u2019t get involved with their prey? Or their families? Oh, never mind\u2014I can\u2019t think about this before eating my meat loaf. Who knows who\u2019s in it?\u201d</p><p>Ian chuckled at her. \u201cYou\u2019re right about one thing. Not a bad little bar here. I never checked it out before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToldja,\u201d she said, sipping her wine. \u201cWhat would you like to talk about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve talked all day. I haven\u2019t talked this much in four years. I think I might be losing my voice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t talked this little...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI kind of assumed that...\u201d</p><p>Just then Jack delivered two steaming plates that he held with towels. He reached beneath the bar and produced a couple of sets of utensils wrapped in napkins and asked, \u201cAnother beer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Ian said in what was an unmistakably friendly voice. \u201cThe lady\u2019s buying.\u201d And then he put his napkin on his thigh.</p><p>Marcie stared at that thigh for a long moment. This was the sort of thing that had her confused. He looked a little crazy, till you got used to him. He could act as if he had needs barely above the animal kingdom, taking roughing it to the next level. When he was in his working clothes, he looked as if he barely subsisted. He could growl and snarl like a lunatic. But he had intelligent diction, good table manners, and while he might not be terribly social and on the quiet side, he had no trouble being around people. He was perfectly cordial.</p><p>She had expected a man completely screwed up by his past, by his war experiences, someone hard to reach and nearly impossible to change\u2014a difficult situation, but easy to understand. Instead, what she found was someone pretty normal. It left her with many more questions than answers.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right about the food,\u201d he said with a hum and a napkin to his lips and beard.</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d she agreed, letting her eyes fall closed as she enjoyed mashed potatoes so creamy and wonderful, they were like ambrosia.</p><p>Ian finished quickly, sitting back and giving his belly a satisfied rub. Marcie just gave up, pushing her plate toward Ian. \u201cI\u2019m done. Go ahead. Help yourself.\u201d</p><p>His eyes widened. \u201cYou sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d she said suddenly. She dipped her fork into the mashed potatoes and lifted it to his lips. \u201cTry this.\u201d</p><p>He lifted his brows, then let her put the fork into his mouth. He savored it. Then he said, \u201cI think you got better potatoes.\u201d And he smiled.</p><p>\u201cHelp yourself, Ian. I\u2019m going to explode if I eat any more,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cMaybe a bite,\u201d he said, dipping his fork a couple of times before he, too, had to admit defeat. They sat in silence for a few appreciative moments, finishing their drinks, satisfied. Happy. It occurred to her\u2014they were happy.</p><p>The contentment was interrupted abruptly. Mel came into the bar with a baby on her hip. Marcie knew she was pregnant, but had no idea there was also a baby under a year old. The baby was all stropped up in a snowsuit, encased from his head to his toes in blue bunting. The smile on her face was brilliant. \u201cJack! Everyone! It\u2019s time. Tell Preach to turn off the stove and get Christopher and come on! Come on, don\u2019t make us wait!\u201d</p><p>Ian\u2019s eyes narrowed as he quizzed Marcie wordlessly. \u201cThey\u2019re going to light the tree,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019d love to see it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever jingles your bells,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not coming?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pretty comfortable right here.\u201d</p><p>She leveled him with her gaze. \u201cSuit yourself,\u201d she finally said. And she got off her stool to follow the people in the bar as they headed outside.</p><p>There was a formidable gathering there\u2014cars and trucks double-parked all up and down the street. People were murmuring, laughing, greeting each other. There were lots of excited children running around. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Marcie found herself at the back of the crowd, not out of shyness but because she wanted to see the entire height of the tree and get the full effect. She felt a longing to have Ian at her side, but his reluctance was easy to understand\u2014nothing like the holidays to bring back dark memories of loved ones lost, families in unstable places, loneliness, bittersweet memories.</p><p>Mel was suddenly at her side, jiggling the baby.</p><p>\u201cI thought you were expecting your first,\u201d Marcie said with a bit of melancholy. There had been a time she\u2019d seen a family in her future, but when Bobby was injured, everything went away\u2014all the hopes and dreams and fantasies.</p> <p>\u201cThis is David, my son. I wasn\u2019t expecting to be expecting so soon again, but it is what it is. I\u2019m knocked up.\u201d She laughed. \u201cYou\u2019d think a midwife would have a better handle on things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI assume you\u2019re happy about it?\u201d Marcie asked boldly.</p><p>\u201cIt took a little getting used to, but the baby moves now. That seems to change even the most reluctant mommy. How\u2019s it going? I see you got Ian into town. Did you finally speak with your sister?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m doing fine, and yes, I talked to Erin. She\u2019s over-protective, but she can\u2019t help it. She\u2019s seven years older than me, nine years older than my little brother, and when we lost our parents, she took over. Since I was fifteen, she\u2019s raised me. Got me through every rough patch of my life. Really, it kills me to defy her like this\u2014but I\u2019m not sorry I did this. Now that Bobby\u2019s gone, she\u2019d like me to snap out of it, sense the freedom, do all the things she feels were denied me\u2014go back to school, get a career, marry one of her successful friends or something. She\u2019s so conservative\u2014I\u2019m a little too crazy for her. This thing I\u2019m doing\u2014she thinks I\u2019m nuts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut do you think you\u2019re nuts?\u201d Mel asked.</p> <p>\u201cSometimes,\u201d she admitted. \u201cBut every day that passes, I learn more about myself. I don\u2019t want to get all gooey, but this is a spiritual journey. I thought it was about Ian, but it might be that Ian is right where he should be and I\u2019m the one who needs to face a few things about my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, honey,\u201d Mel said. \u201cThat\u2019s not gooey. If we had time, I\u2019d tell you about some of the crazy things I\u2019ve done to try to get myself grounded.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be nice,\u201d she said, reaching out to run a knuckle along David\u2019s pink cheek.</p><p>\u201cOh, look! It\u2019s going to happen,\u201d Mel whispered. \u201cDavid, look,\u201d she said, turning the baby\u2019s head. \u201cLook at the tree!\u201d</p><p>Marcie noticed that Jack was crouched behind the huge tree, a couple of extension cords in his hands. He connected them and the most amazing tree in the world came to life. It was adorned in red, white and blue streamers that ran from the top to the bottom; red, white and blue balls glittered amid white lights\u2014a million white lights. And between them were the gold stars. And patches, visible only by the sparkling gold trim that illuminated them, representing hundreds of military units who stood the watch. But the thing that mesmerized Marcie was the star on top.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t the typical gold star that often topped Christmas trees\u2014it was a white beacon. And it was powerful. It actually cast a glow, as though it was a real star in the heavens. It created a path of light.</p> <p>Her hand went to her throat to catch the tightness there. It was glorious. \u201cThat star,\u201d she whispered in sheer awe.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Mel said. \u201cI had everyone in town looking for something like that. I hope it lights their way home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll of them,\u201d she whispered. \u201cAll of them.\u201d And she thought of Bobby, finally home after his struggle. And Ian? Could it light Ian\u2019s way home, too?</p><p>\u201cHow did you get all the unit patches?\u201d Marcie asked.</p><p>\u201cJack and the boys contacted all their old friends. We made phone calls, wrote letters and faxed them. The tree was a sudden decision. Boys from around here have gone into the military\u2014one very close to Jack and me not so long ago. And Vanni\u2019s husband, lost to us in Baghdad...He was in Jack\u2019s squad several years ago. This is for him, too. And his wife. This just couldn\u2019t wait. We had to hurry to get it done, and we did. The whole town pitched in. Doc\u2019s clinic was a disaster.\u201d She laughed. \u201cHe groused, but I think it made him secretly happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s truly amazing.\u201d</p><p>The oohs and ahhs subsided and people started to sing. The first carol was \u201cSilent Night,\u201d and then \u201cAway in a Manger.\u201d Marcie glanced toward the bar, missing Ian, wanting him to be with her to see the star. She smiled to see him standing on the porch of the bar, hands in his pants pockets, looking up to the top of the tree. And she thought\u2014what will be will be. I promise, I won\u2019t get in the way of it.</p><p>People started drifting away about a half hour later, having been through a repertoire of about ten well-known songs. Mel took her baby into the bar, and it wasn\u2019t all that long before Marcie stood in the street with only a few people remaining, all of them looking closely at the tree as Ian continued to watch from the porch. He finally walked down the steps toward the tree and went right up to it, taking a close look at the ornaments and the unit badges. She knew what he would see\u2014a remembrance. A tribute.</p> <p>Ian didn\u2019t poke around at the tree for too long, but he could see in a moment that these military unit patches came from everywhere and there might have been hundreds reaching up to the top of that enormous tree. It made him feel something he hadn\u2019t allowed himself to feel in a very long time. Pride.</p><p>His reverie was broken when he heard Marcie cough; it came out like a bark. He turned and went to her, taking her hand in his, leading her to the truck. \u201cDid you bring your cough medicine with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, coughing again. \u201cStupid, I know. But I was in a real hurry to get in your truck before you realized that I\u2019d tricked you into letting me come\u2014\u201d She quickly jumped in the truck and when he was behind the wheel, she broke into another spasm. Then she said, \u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what, exactly? For hacking all the way home or for forcing yourself on me all day long?\u201d</p><p>She glanced at his profile. Without being able to see his eyes and with all that hair on his face, she couldn\u2019t tell if he was amused or angry. \u201cBoth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019re coughing on purpose. And I\u2019m not annoyed about the day anymore. It was a good day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d she said. \u201cReally? Did you have kind of a good time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKind of,\u201d he relented. \u201cMy favorite part was when you told the librarian I was an idiot savant. You think on your feet.\u201d</p><p>She smiled to herself.</p><p>\u201cI think it turned out to be too much of a day for you,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ve been doing so much better, we both ignored the fact that you were real sick there for a few days. You\u2019re supposed to be taking it easy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have to rest or anything. But I am supposed to take that cough medicine a few times a day, and I let it go all day. Like I said, I wasn\u2019t thinking. I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d She coughed a little more. \u201cI\u2019ll take the medicine as soon as we get home. Ian\u2014do you ever get lonely? Up on the mountain?\u201d</p><p>The first thought that came to his mind was, I never used to. But what he said was, \u201cIt\u2019s kind of strange how fast you can get used to something, like quiet. Like being alone. I didn\u2019t think it would end up being this long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes that mean you planned to come back? Like to Chico? At least out of hiding?\u201d</p><p>He turned and looked at her. \u201cMarcie\u2014I haven\u2019t been hiding.\u201d He looked a little surprised. He looked back to the road. \u201cI mean, when I first got up this way, I didn\u2019t tell anyone where I was headed because I didn\u2019t know, and didn\u2019t tell anyone where I ended up. But I haven\u2019t been hiding. I have a driver\u2019s license and a registered vehicle. I pay taxes on the property. I do business\u2014even if it\u2019s not very official. But I\u2019m not that hard to find. You might have to get used to the idea that no one wanted to find me. No one was looking for me. But you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I checked\u2014I\u2019ve been to the police and everything. Someone checked to see if you had a registered vehicle, though they said they couldn\u2019t give me any information about you if\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you check in Humboldt County? Because that cabin is over the line\u2014it\u2019s in Trinity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she said. \u201cOh.\u201d She coughed a little more; this is what happens when you\u2019re fighting the last remnants of a bug, don\u2019t take your medicine and get a little tired out. \u201cCan I ask something?\u201d she said carefully. \u201cWhy\u2019d you come up here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remembered the place. I\u2019d come up here fishing with my dad when I was a kid. Before my mom died; before he lost interest. I first came when I was young, then as a teenager. I just remembered it as a place you could hear yourself think. I needed something like that\u2014something low stress. And you admitted yourself, it\u2019s really beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd it just turned into over four years?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt just did,\u201d he said. \u201cSomething I learned in the Marines\u2014it works for me to challenge myself physically. Push myself. It gives me a look at who I am, what I can do. I was living off the land, roughing it. And I was starting to think clearly. I came up in late summer. I had a bedroll and backpack. Back then, I thought it might be best if I stayed away from people for the most part\u2014thought some things through, tried to get a handle on the ways my life was changed since the Marine Corps. Then all of a sudden, it was snowing and I wasn\u2019t quite ready to take the next step. There were options\u2014the GI bill and school, a job, whatever. But I wasn\u2019t ready, and the old man, Raleigh, kicked me back to life. Before I knew it, I\u2019d lived with him for months\u2014like two old bachelors going their own way, doing their own thing. Then I was taking care of him, then he was dead. By then, I had a routine and a lifestyle. It was working for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you didn\u2019t have friends...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I didn\u2019t seem to need people. I swore I\u2019d never let that happen. I guess the apple doesn\u2019t fall far from the tree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t respond for quite a long, drawn out moment. Finally he said, \u201cMy dad. When my mom died, I was twenty and had been in the service a couple of years. She\u2019d been sick with cancer. She was only fifty-five, but she\u2019d had a hard fight for about three years. She was ready, but my old man wasn\u2019t. It really aged him and he was so pissed off. I mean more pissed off than he had been. He\u2019s never been what you\u2019d call happy. He isolated himself, lost interest in things he used to like, slowly left what few friends he had. Every time I came home on leave, he was a little worse. I kept thinking he\u2019d snap out of it, but he didn\u2019t. I swore that that would never happen to me, no matter what.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd it did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot the way you think. I\u2019m not angry. Not very, anyway. I just turned into a loner because my life was mostly spent alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut don\u2019t you ever want more? I mean, like friends? A shower? An indoor john? A full set of dishes?\u201d</p><p>He turned and grinned at her. \u201cI have given some thought to the idea of a shower\u2014it\u2019s a pain in the ass hauling water. But we mountain men, we don\u2019t need a lot of baths.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you want a TV? A CD player? A computer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee if you can understand this. I want trees that are three hundred feet tall, black bear that poke around my stuff, deer that eat out of my hand, and a view that almost brings me to my knees every morning. I want to work just hard enough to afford my life. I\u2019m sorry I don\u2019t have an indoor john and shower for you, especially while you\u2019ve been sick, but I don\u2019t really need one.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She turned toward him and put a hand on his arm. \u201cAren\u2019t you just a little worried you could turn out like that old guy you took care of? Alone on a mountain for fifty years?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve thought about it a time or two,\u201d he said. \u201cI plan to keep going to the dentist at least once every other year\u2014I\u2019d like to go out with all my own teeth. Old Raleigh couldn\u2019t eat much that wasn\u2019t soft. But in all other ways, he didn\u2019t have a bad life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, wouldn\u2019t you rather have a better way to earn money than selling firewood?\u201d</p> <p>He shot her a surprised look. \u201cI don\u2019t sell wood because I\u2019m poor and stupid\u2014I sell wood because it\u2019s good money. The trees are free. There\u2019s no mark-up. I like cutting \u2019em down and chopping \u2019em up. I work at it year-round and make a lot of money when I sell the cut and split logs. I work for the furniture mover in spring and summer, while business is heavy for him. It lets me tend the garden and fish, not to mention get ahead on winter firewood\u2014it has to be seasoned for six months. The river up here is pure and deep. The fish are fat and delicious. It\u2019s incredible. Listen, if I needed anything more, I\u2019d work more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo regrets then?\u201d she braved.</p><p>He snorted. \u201cMarcie, I have lots of regrets. But not about how I live or what I do.\u201d</p><p>She chewed on her lip for a moment. Then she coughed until it bent her at the waist.</p><p>\u201cThis truck is too cold for you,\u201d he said. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t have gone to the bar\u2014we should\u2019ve gone home. You get straight to the couch when we\u2019re home. Cough medicine and bed.\u201d</p> <p>She took a breath. \u201cDo you regret leaving Shelly?\u201d</p><p>He glared at her for a moment, putting her on notice that she was getting too close to that forbidden territory again. But to her surprise, he answered. \u201cIt didn\u2019t go exactly that way. I\u2019m not sure who left who.\u201d And then he fixed his eyes ahead again and started up the mountain to his cabin.</p><p>\u201cBut she said\u2014\u201d</p><p>His head jerked back to her. \u201cYou talked to her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was trying to locate you,\u201d she said weakly, like the wimp she\u2019d suddenly become.</p><p>\u201cOkay, this conversation will have to wait. No more.\u201d</p> <p>And that was that. Silence reigned in the truck the rest of the way up the hill and she was afraid she\u2019d made him very angry. She wondered if this was the point at which he\u2019d load her up in his truck\u2014maybe first thing the next morning\u2014and take her to town, to Mel at the clinic, turning her over. This could be the point at which he was through putting up with her and all her talk about what had happened four years ago.</p><p>When they made the top of the hill, they each took their turns in the outhouse before entering the cabin. She dutifully took her cough medicine, hacking the whole time, and he turned his back while she got down to just his shirt and her panties and planted herself on the couch. He fed the woodstove, prepared his coffeepot for morning, rolled out his pallet and heavy blanket for bed.</p><p>Then he came to the couch. He scooted her over with a brush of his hand and sat on the edge.</p><p>\u201cWhile I was in Iraq, Shelly was planning our wedding. It was set to happen a few weeks after I got back, and while I was gone, it turned into a frickin\u2019 coronation. My fault\u2014I\u2019d said, \u2018Anything that makes you happy.\u2019 But when I got back I told her I needed some time, that I was in no shape to be a husband. I was barely in shape to be a marine, which was supposed to be my life\u2019s work. I asked her to postpone the wedding\u2014but she was in full bride mode. There are things I barely remember about that talk\u2014something about the dress being fitted, invitations out, deposits made. I tried to convince myself to just close my eyes, lock up my brain for a few weeks and get it done. But I knew I\u2019d be letting her down, letting a lot of people down. I knew I was screwed up and needed to decompress. Also, I knew she had no earthly idea what was happening to me\u2014how could she? I barely knew. She said a lot of things, but what I remember most was that she said if I didn\u2019t let this wedding she\u2019d worked so hard on happen, I could go straight to hell.\u201d</p><p>Marcie\u2019s eyes were wide, bright green. \u201cIan, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to hear her version,\u201d he said, holding up a hand. \u201cI hope she\u2019s happy. I hope I didn\u2019t screw up her life too much. Believe me, if I\u2019d married her then, it would have been worse for her. Now\u2014you get some rest. I\u2019ll be back early in the day tomorrow. Don\u2019t do too much. Read one of your books. And take the medicine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s married,\u201d Marcie said softly. \u201cPregnant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood for her,\u201d he said easily. \u201cIt all worked out, then. Now, tomorrow try to get a handle on the cough.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d she replied. \u201cOf course, yes.\u201d</p><p>Ten</p><p>M arcie had slept surprisingly well, despite her conversation with Ian right before falling asleep. She could see him in her mind\u2014a thirty-year-old marine, home from some devastating war experiences, still scarred from being wounded\u2014scarred on the inside from all he\u2019d been through. And the love of his life doesn\u2019t have a care about any of that as long as she gets to wear a white lacy dress on her special day.</p><p>This brought some things to mind for Marcie, things she hadn\u2019t even considered when she\u2019d gone to see Shelly to ask if she\u2019d ever heard from Ian. Shelly had still been angry and had no interest in knowing whether Ian was all right. But after hearing Ian\u2019s side of things, Marcie recalled a conversation she\u2019d had with Shelly when their men were in Iraq together. Marcie had called Shelly, suggesting they meet since their husbands were such good friends. But Shelly was very busy. \u201cPlanning a big wedding is a lot of work,\u201d Shelly had said by way of an excuse.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d be happy to help,\u201d Marcie had offered.</p><p>\u201cThanks, but between my mother, aunts and bridesmaids, I\u2019m up to my eyeballs in help. Still, it seems to take every spare minute I have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you\u2019ll come up with a break in your schedule and we could meet for coffee,\u201d Marcie said. \u201cSince our guys are best friends and we live not ten minutes from each other.\u201d</p><p>And Shelly had said, \u201cGive me your number and if I find the time, I\u2019ll give you a call.\u201d</p><p>But she never did. Clearly, never intended to. And for the first time ever, Marcie wondered\u2014would we have been invited to the wedding?</p><p>Ian had left a half pot of coffee on top of the woodstove but, while Marcie had slept, the fire had died down. The coffee had cooled. She remembered having that great, rich, steaming hot coffee at Jack\u2019s, and it set up a real craving in her. Ian\u2019s coffee wasn\u2019t bad, but it would be a lot better if it was hot.</p><p>She fed the stove, but she didn\u2019t have the patience to wait for it to flare and heat that coffee. She eyeballed the little propane stove and thought, that\u2019s a quicker option. She took the pot to the stove and studied the dials carefully. Gas on. Simple enough. She turned the dial but nothing happened. She blew on it like she had to do on her dad\u2019s old stove. Nothing happened; there was no spark. She smelled the gas however. She gave it a second and said a chant over it\u2014light! Heat the coffee! She turned the knob again\u2014and again there was no spark and the smell of gas was evident. A third try produced nothing.</p><p>Then she noticed the matches on the counter and thought, so that\u2019s it. Turn on the gas, light the stove! With the pot on the burner, she turned on the gas again and struck a match. And poof! The flame shot about three feet in the air, hitting her square in the face.</p><p>She shrieked and whirled, patting her face and hair, running her hands over the rest of her wild red mop to check for fire. She felt the burn on her face. When she looked at the little stove, the flame was just normal, burning nicely under the pot, but her face felt as hot as a poker!</p><p>She started to whimper like a baby, all shook up by what could have been a disastrous accident. She rushed to the couch, pulled on her boots and, in Ian\u2019s chambray shirt, she ran outside to her car, disregarding all manner of possible vicious wildlife. There wasn\u2019t a mirror in the entire house; that much she already knew. She used the sleeve of the shirt to wipe off the little bug\u2019s side mirror and took a look. Then she screamed.</p><p>Her face was bright red, like a sunburn, and her hairline was singed. Little black squiggles seemed to sprout from her forehead. Her eyebrows, which weren\u2019t much to start with and were nearly blond, seemed to be even less significant, and if she was seeing correctly\u2014her lashes were shorter!</p><p>Ice, she thought. Something cold to relieve the burn before it blistered and swelled.</p><p>She ran back inside, turned off the little stove and cursed at it, then started digging around for a cloth. He always laid these things out for her on bath days, but there was nothing handy right now. She was finally pushed to look through the trunks. The first one in which she looked held clothing, but in the second she found some towels and washcloths. She grabbed one, wet it from the chilled water that came straight from the sink pump and pressed it to her face. \u201cGod,\u201d she said in relief. \u201cOh, God.\u201d</p><p>An hour later when Ian walked into his cabin, what he saw startled him. Marcie was lying on the couch in his shirt and her boots, her legs bare, with a cloth pressed over her face. He knelt beside the couch in a near panic and gently pulled her hands away. \u201cMarcie?\u201d he asked softly.</p><p>When she lowered her hands along with the cold, wet cloth, he gasped. \u201cAre you having a relapse? Fever? Should I take you to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a fever!\u201d she nearly shouted at him.</p><p>\u201cBut your face\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs bright red! I know. And my hair is burned off around my face. And if you bother to look, there don\u2019t seem to be eyebrows there either, not that I ever had much for eyebrows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus,\u201d he said in a breath, sitting back on his heels.</p><p>\u201cI was trying to heat up the coffee on the propane stove\u2014and apparently I don\u2019t know how to use the stove.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d he asked. \u201cAre you hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHurt? I\u2019m pretty ugly, but I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s permanent.\u201d She relayed the events of lighting the stove, coming too late with the match or too early with the gas and how it all poofed in her face and scorched her.</p><p>His rough finger glanced along the hair above her face and beneath that massive beard his lips twitched slightly. \u201cI have some salve. And this will probably grow back...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re laughing!\u201d she accused. \u201cYou are fucking laughing!\u201d</p><p>He shook his head vigorously but he still showed teeth. Teeth she\u2019d rarely seen. \u201cNo. No. It\u2019s just that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? It\u2019s just that what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Marcie. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s all my fault. I should have showed you how to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re damn straight it\u2019s all your fault! Starting with roaring at me like a goddamn lion and making me scared and making me stubborn and then not showing me how to light the damn stove and then\u2014\u201d</p><p>Suddenly he was all teeth behind his red beard. \u201cMaking you stubborn?\u201d he asked, barely concealing the laughter.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m at my best when people just do what I ask! And what\u2019s so goddamn funny?\u201d</p><p>His arms went around his torso to hug himself and he rolled backward onto the floor, erupting into laughter. His mouth opened wide, his eyes squinched and he bellowed. Between gasping and belly laughs, he choked out\u2014\u201cYou\u2019re bright red! And it\u2019s my fault for making you\u2014stubborn! God\u2014you\u2019re priceless!\u201d And he laughed himself crazy. She sat on the edge of the couch, boots on the floor, red face staring down at him, glowering.</p><p>It took him a while to get himself under control. His laughter ebbed into pants and gasps; he wiped at his watering eyes. Then he finally looked at her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m surprised you didn\u2019t fart from laughing,\u201d she said, not the merest hint of a smile on her face.</p><p>He huffed a couple of times and said, \u201cIt took some doing.\u201d He sat up, recovered himself and asked, with a twitch of his lips, \u201cAre you in pain?\u201d</p><p>She lifted her chin. \u201cSomewhat.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLet me find that salve,\u201d he said, getting to his feet. He went into one of his cupboards and produced a tin of salve, gently smearing it over her burned face, his lips wriggling in the temptation to laugh the whole time.</p><p>\u201cIs it that damned funny?\u201d she finally demanded.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s pretty funny, Marcie. There was a perfectly good starter on that stove, but it broke a while back and it was easier for me to light it than get it fixed. See, that\u2019s the kind of thing that happens when you live alone\u2014you don\u2019t make a house for a family. You get by. It\u2019s lazy, I know...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re not lazy. You work hard!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay then, it\u2019s just one more thing I don\u2019t have to do,\u201d he said. \u201cReally, it\u2019s not that bad, your face...\u201d Then he chuckled.</p> <p>\u201cI have black squiggles where I used to have bangs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, honey. But it\u2019ll all come back just fine.\u201d</p><p>Honey? Did he just call me honey? Is he feeling sorry for me? Being sweet to me because I\u2019m scorched? Finally she said, \u201cThe salve is good. What is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething the vet uses on horses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, terrific!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s good stuff! Better than what you can get over the counter or from the doctor, thanks to the FDA. I swear.\u201d But then he laughed.</p> <p>\u201cAre you still laughing because I look ridiculous, or because you just got one over on me\u2014giving me horse medicine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m laughing because\u2014\u201d he gulped \u201c\u2014how about I grease you up and feed you something to eat? While you\u2019re trying to recover from your burn, I could read one of those sloppy romances to you, if you like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRead to me?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cSometimes I read to Raleigh, when he was feeling real bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cFood, yes. Reading would be nice, but singing would be better. I want you to sing to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, Marcie...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a burn victim. Try to be accommodating.\u201d</p><p>He sighed heavily and went to his cupboard. There were a couple dozen large cans of Dinty Moore beef stew in there. He pulled a couple out and she said, \u201cGood God, are you expecting nuclear war?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d he laughed. \u201cI\u2019m ready for snow. My road to Highway 36 is long. You can get real hungry up here if you\u2019re not prepared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you exist on canned stew?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d buy something else if something else tasted better.\u201d He emptied it into a pan and put it on the stove. She watched while he lit it. First the match, then the gas. Perfect. Well, that made sense.</p><p>So he warmed her stew, scooped it into a big mug, and let her have it. Then he tucked her in, gave her cough medicine, and told her to close her eyes. And he sang to her. Everything was soft but deep and resonant. \u201cNew York, New York,\u201d the slow version. \u201cWhen I Fall In Love.\u201d \u201cYou Don\u2019t Know Me,\u201d which she tried not to read anything into. She was afraid to open her eyes, afraid he\u2019d stop. There were a lot of old, sweet, mellow Sinatra and Presley songs.</p><p>She found herself thinking about Abigail Adams, managing five children and running a farm single-handedly while her husband worked to found America. Marcie had always admired and honored Abigail. Was it so much trouble to go across the yard to the john? Even if you did have to carry a heavy skillet to ward off wildlife? Or heat your water? What did she need? One thing she knew for a fact: she sure didn\u2019t need an eyebrow wax.</p><p>Marcie drifted off to sleep dreaming of Abigail and Ian\u2019s voice. In the morning when she woke, the coffeepot was on the woodstove, which had burned low as usual. There was a note on the table.</p><p>Don\u2019t light the Coleman stove unless you\u2019re sure you know how.</p><p>And it made her laugh.</p><p>Marcie was almost halfway through a novel in which the hero was just about to grab the heroine by the waist, slam her against him and just kiss the stuffing out of her when something occurred to her. Her letters.</p><p>In addition to those letters she\u2019d written to Ian about Bobby when Ian was still in Iraq, letters he had answered, she\u2019d written him regularly for a couple of years, to general delivery. They\u2019d neither been answered nor returned. What were the chances...?</p><p>She dove off the couch and went first to that little tin box where he put his money every night. She noticed he had stopped locking it. It didn\u2019t hold very much\u2014the deed, which she didn\u2019t bother with, a few pictures. She was distracted by the pictures. They were very telling in number and subject. A family picture when Ian was a young teen, fourteen or fifteen. A beautiful picture of Shelly, a black wrap over her shoulders, perhaps a college or sorority picture. A picture of Ian and Bobby wearing BDUs, rifle straps over their shoulders, grinning. One with his dad when he was a bit older, his father unsmiling.</p><p>It distracted her from her search. A couple of things about them were telling\u2014there were only a few photos, and they were of the most special people he\u2019d had in his life. They marked his passage, from a boy in what looked like an average, middle-class family, to a young man with an unhappy father, to a marine. Then there came the woman, then the friend. Then...Nothing.</p><p>Underneath the photos were his medals. The ones she\u2019d received for Bobby had come in fancy boxes. Ian\u2019s were loose. But at least he hadn\u2019t thrown them away in a fit of anger or depression.</p><p>She tucked everything away very carefully and closed the lid, feeling guilty about going through his things. He deserved his privacy, but there were things she wished to understand. So she went to the trunk that held his clothing and slipped her hand slowly down all four sides. She felt something and gently parted the carefully folded clothes to strike oil. A rubber band held about a dozen long white envelopes, all to him, all from her. All sealed. Never opened, yet saved.</p><p>She stared at them in wonder. Now whatever could that mean?</p><p>And then she heard a motor. At first, assuming it was Ian returning, she replaced the envelopes and closed the trunk. By the time she got to her feet, she realized it wasn\u2019t Ian\u2019s truck, so she went to the door.</p><p>Well, she might\u2019ve known. There, in a big, shiny new SUV was Erin Elizabeth Foley. Big sister. She folded her arms across her chest as Erin got out of the car.</p><p>Erin took one look at her and froze. She took two steps closer, her mouth agape and said, \u201cOh my God! What\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d</p><p>Completely forgetting about her red face and burned hair, she looked down at herself. She was wearing one of Ian\u2019s shirts and her boots, bare, white legs sticking out between. \u201cThe floor is cold. Erin, what are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI came to see this place, this man. You can\u2019t possibly believe I\u2019m just going to let you continue this insanity without knowing what we\u2019re dealing with? And it\u2019s a good thing I came to get you! Dear God\u2014did he beat you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeat me? Of course not! And we\u2019re not dealing with anything because this is not your deal! You\u2019re going to spoil everything!\u201d</p><p>Erin came closer, bringing the rich scent of Chanel\u2019s Allure with her. She was decked in a tan leather jacket and matching boots with heels\u2014probably Cole Haan, her favorite\u2014and perfectly creased, expensive, chocolate-brown wool pants. She wore thin driving gloves and her strawberry-blond hair fell in perfect waves to her shoulders. There was, of course, gold jewelry and a colorful red, orange and purple Hermes scarf looped around her neck. \u201cWhat happened to your face?\u201d</p><p>Marcie\u2019s hand rose to her cheek. It didn\u2019t hurt so she had all but forgotten. \u201cOh. I had a little accident with the stove. It was entirely my fault. But I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you been to the emergency room?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe what?\u201d She started to laugh. \u201cThere\u2019s an emergency room a couple of hours from here, but I have some stuff on it. A really good salve they use on horses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, for the love of God! You\u2019ve completely lost your mind!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t hurt,\u201d Marcie said, feeling ten years old.</p><p>\u201cBut your hair. Your beautiful hair! And your...your...eyebrows!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI noticed,\u201d Marcie said. \u201cReally, Erin\u2014why can\u2019t you just leave me alone? I did what you asked\u2014I called every couple of days, at least every few or had someone call you, I was careful, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>Erin\u2019s lips firmed into that implacable \u201cmother expression.\u201d \u201cRight. Finding him was one thing, staying with him in an isolated place without a phone and a\u2014Dear God, is that what I think it is?\u201d she said, pointing a finger toward the outhouse.</p><p>\u201cThe loo,\u201d Marcie said, a tad amused. \u201cNo bidet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to faint.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have a little porcelain pot inside if you can\u2019t weather the trek to the head.\u201d She decided not to mention it would do well to carry a weapon when one ventured out there.</p><p>Erin actually swayed on her feet, her eyes closing briefly. Marcie had to hold in her laughter. If she thought her introduction to this cabin in the woods was interesting, the very thought of Erin slipping on her Cole Haans and trudging out in the morning to the facilities was enough to make her burst into hysterical laughter. \u201cYou should see how we manage on bath day,\u201d Marcie said, finding it irresistible to bait her a little.</p><p>Erin\u2019s eyes popped open. \u201cBath day suggests it\u2019s not every day and it\u2019s not convenient.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be a true statement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd not particularly comfortable...\u201d Erin went on.</p><p>\u201cWell, since the only heat is a wood-burning stove, it\u2019s quite quick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLord. Get your things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. No, you can look around and lift your prissy little nose and meet Ian if you insist, though you won\u2019t like the look of him, I can assure you. And then you can depart before it becomes necessary for you to use the facilities. That\u2019s as far as I go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least you\u2019ll let me take you to the doctor,\u201d Erin said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen the doctor,\u201d Marcie said before she could stop herself.</p><p>\u201cAnd what did he say about you using horse medicine on your face?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiniments. Horse liniments of some kind that work surprisingly well. But, actually, I didn\u2019t need a doctor for that. Turns out the minute I got here and found Ian, I got sick. Flu. He went for the doctor, and the doctor and his nurse practitioner came out to the cabin, gave me a shot and Ian took very good care of me. He made chicken soup and everything.\u201d</p><p>Erin put her fingers to her temples. She gave a little rub, then recovered herself, giving her head a shake. She glanced at the igloo-shaped mound right beside her big SUV with narrowed eyes.</p><p>\u201cMy little VeeDub. Not going anywhere for a while, I\u2019m afraid. It wouldn\u2019t handle the mountain roads in snow and ice. Things need to dry out a little. If you won\u2019t just go away, come inside, Erin.\u201d Marcie turned and entered the cabin, leaving the door open for her sister.</p><p>As Marcie could have predicted, Erin wasn\u2019t impressed. She looked around and though she was quiet, she shuddered. \u201cWhere are the beds?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs a matter of fact, there aren\u2019t beds. I sleep on the couch and Ian sleeps on a pallet on the floor near the stove. I haven\u2019t taken his couch\u2014he says he\u2019s always used the pallet. It\u2019s comfortable for him. The couch is too short.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere seems to be just the one room,\u201d Erin said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a cabin. It\u2019s been inhabited by one man. Not at all unlike the cabins Dad and Drew rented for hunting and fishing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is entirely different, as you well know,\u201d Erin said pleadingly. \u201cMarcie, I can\u2019t leave you here. I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Another engine ground its way to the top of the mountain and Marcie stepped toward her sister with a look of desperation on her face. \u201cListen to me\u2014really listen. We haven\u2019t talked about what happened to Bobby, about any of that time in Ian\u2019s life. We were just barely sneaking up on it, so you are to say nothing, do you hear me?\u201d She went to the couch to sit, take off her boots and grab up her jeans to pull them quickly on. \u201cNothing! Mind your manners, don\u2019t insult him and use that sharp lawyer\u2019s brain of yours to be political. And I mean it!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cReally!\u201d Erin said, stiffening.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re goddamn right, really!\u201d Marcie sat again and pulled on her boots. By the time she accomplished this, Ian was coming in the door.</p><p>He filled the frame. His eyes narrowed. Marcie heard her sister\u2019s sharp intake of breath.</p><p>Marcie knew it was Erin\u2019s presence in the cabin that made his dirty tan jacket look shabbier, his beard wilder. His eyes glittered. He wasn\u2019t happy. \u201cThe sister, I presume,\u201d he said.</p><p>Erin stretched her neck proudly and put out a hand. \u201cErin Foley, how do you do?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDoin\u2019 just fine, thanks. You?\u201d he said, ignoring the hand.</p><p>\u201cWell, thank you. It\u2019s nice to meet you. I was just coming for Marcie...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m not quite ready to go,\u201d Marcie said. \u201cErin just wanted to meet you before she leaves. I didn\u2019t call her to come, Ian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t know how you could,\u201d he said, putting his sack of groceries on his small table. \u201cSmoke signals, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, listen the two of you,\u201d Erin said. \u201cI didn\u2019t like this idea from the start, Marcie coming up here alone in search of you, especially now\u2014this time of year, the holidays, and almost exactly a year since Bobby\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cErin!\u201d</p><p>She cleared her throat. \u201cWell, as you\u2019ve no doubt discovered, my younger sister is very stubborn and will have her way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t hardly miss that,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cFinding you and talking to you was one thing\u2014but this is beyond the pale. She can\u2019t stay here, Mr. Buchanan. There\u2019s only one room, nowhere for sleeping, no indoor facilities, and it appears she\u2019s not entirely well. She\u2019s sick and burned and...It was very good of you to put her up, take care of her, et cetera, but enough is enough. Marcie should come home to her family. It\u2019s almost Christmas. We\u2019ve all been through enough.\u201d She looked pointedly at her sister. \u201cMarcie, really, it\u2019s not just me who\u2019s anxious to have you home\u2014the Sullivan family is worried about you, too. Maybe you and Mr. Buchanan can stay in touch, meet again after Christmas, somewhere where there\u2019s a phone and an indoor\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cErin!\u201d If possible, Marcie\u2019s face got a little redder.</p><p>\u201cYour sister\u2019s right,\u201d Ian said. \u201cYou should be with your family now. We\u2019ll be in touch sometime down the road.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I\u2019d been ready to go, I would have left! If I\u2019d been determined to leave, I would\u2019ve hitchhiked\u2014I could have done that,\u201d she said firmly. \u201cI was planning to stay as long as you\u2014We were just getting to know each other!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been here long enough,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not used to having people around. Good that she\u2019s here. You can\u2019t get out of here in your car, anyway.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut, Ian\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s right. Enough is enough. Get your things together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, Ian,\u201d she said, taking a step toward him, a pleading expression on her face, \u201cI thought\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think we did just fine together, trapped here by your flu and all. But now she\u2019s here to take you home, and I\u2019m ready to have my house back. I\u2019m not used to so many people. You know that.\u201d He took a breath. \u201cYou\u2019ll be in good hands with your sister. She looks extremely...\u201d He gave Erin a glance that was an impolite once-over. \u201cCompetent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Erin said, rubbing her hands together. \u201cShall we?\u201d</p><p>Marcie looked up into his eyes. Hers were soft and pleading; his were hard. \u201cYou don\u2019t mean that,\u201d she said. \u201cAre you saying you want me to go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should go with your sister, Marcie. She\u2019s right. You don\u2019t want to worry the family. Sometime later we\u2019ll meet up again if you want. But I\u2019m a hermit. And I like it that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not a hermit. You sell wood, go to truck stops, churches, the library...I don\u2019t believe you want me to go,\u201d she said in a near whisper.</p><p>\u201cYeah. You do. But I\u2019m glad you found me. And I\u2019m sorry about Bobby.\u201d He dropped his chin. \u201cYou\u2019ll never know how sorry...\u201d Then he lifted his eyes and met hers. \u201cGo on now. Go home. Where you belong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was starting to feel like I belonged here,\u201d she said. He held silent while their eyes were locked. Finally, beaten, she turned from him and gathered up her things. It didn\u2019t take long\u2014she kept her clothes in her duffel, along with a few things like shampoo and makeup. In her backpack were maps and notes, and the baseball cards she hadn\u2019t yet given him. And she had a purse. She rolled up her sleeping bag. In no time at all, she was done and began to fold the quilt that had kept her warm on the couch.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take care of that,\u201d Ian said.</p><p>But she continued. When it was in a nice little square, she stacked her library books on the table. \u201cI didn\u2019t finish,\u201d she said. \u201cI was just getting to the good part, too. The page is marked. Thanks for everything. I mean, you\u2019ve done so much for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t do hardly anything at all,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t change anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you did. You cooked for me, took care of me, gave me medicine, protected me...But, well, I know I\u2019ve been a lot of trouble...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a big deal\u201d was all he said.</p><p>\u201cTo me it was.\u201d</p><p>And he didn\u2019t respond.</p><p>She hefted her duffel, backpack and purse and went out the door, leaving Erin to grab the sleeping bag. She threw her things in the backseat of Erin\u2019s car and got in the passenger seat.</p><p>She wished he\u2019d roared at Erin and scared her away. But Erin would\u2019ve come back with the whole sheriff\u2019s department unlike Marcie, who just ate a sandwich and nearly froze to death.</p><p>\u201cGo into the town\u2014I want to say goodbye to my friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVirgin River?\u201d Erin asked.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen, Marcie...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd don\u2019t talk to me. Don\u2019t even look at me.\u201d</p><p>Eleven</p><p>E rin pulled up in front of Jack\u2019s bar and said, \u201cDon\u2019t be long. We\u2019ll be driving at night as it is.\u201d</p><p>Marcie didn\u2019t respond, she just stomped inside. Obviously not trusting her, Erin was right behind her.</p><p>Jack started to smile, then his smile froze as he took in Marcie\u2019s scorched face and fried hair. \u201cWhoa,\u201d he said.</p><p>She jumped up on a stool. \u201cBroken propane stove. Don\u2019t ask.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t dream of it,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cBeer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cComing right up.\u201d</p><p>He poured a draft and greeted Erin. \u201cHello again. I guess you found the place, no problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank God,\u201d she said. \u201cDo you have any idea of the living conditions out there?\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019s not that unusual for the mountains. I lived pretty lean while I was building the bar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no indoor bathroom!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlso not too unusual. You have to redig that outhouse every few years, too. And I suppose you know\u2014we don\u2019t have sewer lines that reach that far up and out. It would have to be a septic system, but a man all alone might just brave the cold in winter. Same with cable and electric\u2014you need a satellite dish and generator. There are probably hundreds of cabins just like that out there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what\u2019s the point?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, if you\u2019d looked around, you wouldn\u2019t ask.\u201d</p><p>The door opened and Mel came into the bar, David on her hip. She jumped up beside Marcie and passed the baby across the bar to her husband. Then she gave him a little kiss and turned a smile to Marcie. She jumped in surprise.</p><p>\u201cI got a little burn,\u201d Marcie said.</p><p>\u201cBoy howdy. What are you putting on it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome kind of horse liniment Ian had. It relieved it immediately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. Methylsulphonymethane. People around here use it for damn near everything. It\u2019s famous for cell repair. I guess Doc\u2019s right\u2014you\u2019re in good hands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, not anymore. Mel, meet my sister, Erin. Erin, meet Mel Sheridan. I believe you spoke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course. How do you do. Nice of you to call for Marcie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was my pleasure. I\u2019ve enjoyed getting to know your sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you tended her while she had the flu?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith Doc, yes. She seems to be doing just fine\u2014don\u2019t worry about that.\u201d</p><p>Jack had situated David in his backpack so he could serve and handle his son at the same time. Preacher brought out a rack of clean flatware to place under the bar, nodded hello to everyone, lifted curious brows toward Marcie, but then disappeared. Mike Valenzuela came in the back door, went behind the bar to help himself to a draft and was introduced to Erin. When he looked at Marcie, his face froze in surprise.</p><p>\u201cThe propane stove,\u201d she explained wearily. \u201cI turned on the gas first, lit the match second.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBet you get that in the right order next time,\u201d he said, taking a drink of his beer before going back to the kitchen.</p><p>Mel happened to glance down and noted Erin\u2019s boots. \u201cHoly smoke, I used to own a pair of those,\u201d she said. \u201cI kind of miss them, too. I killed them the first spring I was in this town, traipsing around the ranches and vineyards.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that so?\u201d Erin asked.</p><p>\u201cThis is rough country. Man\u2019s country, I guess, much as it kills me to call it that. I wasn\u2019t quite ready for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, the men in here are very...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Mel said, laughing. \u201cVery pretty, aren\u2019t they? But dangerous. Watch out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDangerous?\u201d Erin questioned, wide-eyed.</p><p>Mel leaned close. \u201cThey shoot deer, play poker, smoke big nasty cigars. And as it turns out\u2014have pretty high sperm counts. You can trust me\u2014I\u2019m the local midwife...\u201d</p><p>Jack chuckled, drawing a glance from Erin.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you from?\u201d Erin asked Mel.</p><p>\u201cMost recently, Los Angeles,\u201d Mel said. \u201cI was looking for a change.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA change?\u201d Erin asked, stunned.</p><p>Mel smiled sweetly. \u201cIt snuck up on me. The power of this beauty, the natural phenomenon of unspoiled landscape. What I saw on my first morning\u2014trees that touched the sky, eagles soaring, deer in the yard...Then there are the people here\u2014they\u2019re just plain decent folk. I fell in love.\u201d She gave her tummy a rub. \u201cThen I fell in love with Jack, who is entirely too fertile for my taste, but still...he has his good points.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMel,\u201d Marcie said. \u201cI need a lift back to Ian\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>Both women turned to look at her. \u201cMarcie, I won\u2019t let you do this!\u201d Erin insisted. \u201cIt\u2019s primitive! He\u2019s primitive! He looks like a total nutcase. A wild man.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s actually very docile. Kind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are no beds!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI slept on a pallet on the floor for two years while I was remodeling this bar,\u201d Jack put in. He scratched his chin. \u201cDidn\u2019t shave much either. Used Doc\u2019s shower about once every three days or so. We\u2019re kind of homespun around here.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut...But we\u2019re not,\u201d Erin said.</p><p>\u201cJack,\u201d Marcie said. \u201cCall the sheriff. I\u2019m being kidnapped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat wild-man look,\u201d Jack told Erin. \u201cNot unusual around here. Lotta farmers, loggers and ranchers don\u2019t shave in winter. And they don\u2019t usually wear Sunday best to chop wood or feed sheep. Ian Buchanan fits right in, and seems like a civil man. I wouldn\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><p>Marcie put her hand over Erin\u2019s. \u201cI\u2019m going back and I want you to go home. I\u2019ll call and check in, I promise. But I was just barely over being sick, just barely getting him to talk. I\u2019m not done here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarcie\u2014I don\u2019t mean to sound cruel, baby, but you\u2019re not the only one who lost Bobby. His family, me and Drew...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know, I know. I\u2019m not ignoring that, I promise. We\u2019ll be together for Christmas. Please, Erin, don\u2019t fight me. Let me do what I came to do. Then it\u2019ll be done and I can move on.\u201d Tears welled up in her eyes. \u201cHonest, I just have to feel like this is complete.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Erin asked pleadingly, her voice a strained whisper. \u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re going to accomplish?\u201d</p><p>Marcie shot a pleading glance at Mel.</p><p>Mel and Marcie connected eyes for a moment. Then Mel looked at her husband. \u201cJack, take Marcie back to Ian\u2019s. Take David with you. I\u2019ll tend the bar if anyone comes in, or I can call Preacher or Mike. I think Erin and I should talk a minute.\u201d</p><p>Jack lifted one brow. \u201cYou sure?\u201d</p><p>She just nodded and smiled. He leaned slowly across the bar and gave her a little kiss. \u201cI\u2019ll be back before the dinner crowd shows up.\u201d</p> <p>When Jack and Marcie had left, Mel went around behind the bar and poured two cups of coffee. \u201cCream or sugar?\u201d she asked Erin.</p><p>\u201cBoth. Please. And I don\u2019t think you even come close to realizing just how\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlmost three years ago, my first husband was murdered,\u201d Mel said. With that, Erin stopped explaining herself any further. Mel cleared her throat. \u201cI was a nurse practitioner and midwife in an urban trauma center\u2014central L.A. Mark was an E.R. doc there. He was stopping off at a convenience store for milk for his cornflakes after pulling a thirty-six-hour call and there was a robbery in progress. He was shot. Killed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Erin said softly.</p><p>\u201cThank you. At the time I really wanted my life to end with his. After several months passed and I couldn\u2019t seem to get on with my life, I did the craziest thing\u2014I took a job in this one-horse town for almost no money just because I had an instinct that it was different enough to jolt me into some kind of change. I have an older sister,\u201d she added, smiling. \u201cShe thought I was completely nuts and was ready to kidnap me, drag me to her house to recover. Her way.\u201d</p><p>Mel leaned toward Erin. \u201cI\u2019m kind of an expert at struggling to move on. It\u2019s not easy and it\u2019s almost never a clear path. But I can tell you this much\u2014I believe it\u2019s necessary to blaze your own trail. And I\u2019m sure Marcie\u2019s safe. I don\u2019t know if Marcie will work it all out, but I don\u2019t recommend getting in the way of a woman trying to settle her life into some kind of order. There are things she wants to understand. We\u2019ll try to look out for her, as well.\u201d</p><p>Erin sipped her coffee slowly. \u201cI know there\u2019s a message here, and I appreciate you being so candid, but with Marcie\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Erin\u2014the message is\u2014whatever she feels she has to do to get to that next stage might not make sense, might not work out, might not be practical or wise, but it\u2019s what she thinks she has to do. I know you\u2019re hurting, too\u2014losing your brother-in-law, having Marcie out of reach right now\u2014I\u2019m so sorry. I remember my sister suffering so much when my husband died\u2014she loved him like a brother. But at the end of the day, Marcie has to feel like she did what she had to do. For whatever reason, working something out with Ian seems to be it. Apparently it\u2019s necessary for her. She\u2019s been incredibly determined.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s true enough,\u201d Erin said.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be having this talk with you if I thought there was any chance Marcie was even slightly at risk. Believe me, I serve the women of this town. I look out for them. Marcie hasn\u2019t been real specific, but you and I both know what she\u2019s after. She needs to understand why the man who saved her husband\u2019s life would run away. Abandon him. Abandon her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what if he\u2019s only going to do that to her again?\u201d Erin asked, a very sad and concerned look crossing her features.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what she came to find out,\u201d Mel said, and she reached across the bar and squeezed Erin\u2019s hand. \u201cLet her get to the last page on this story, sweetheart. It\u2019s what she\u2019s been needing, or she wouldn\u2019t have gone through so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have to agree or understand,\u201d Mel said, shaking her head. \u201cWe just have to respect her wishes.\u201d Then, very softly she said, \u201cYou have to go home. Let her finish what she came to do. You aren\u2019t going to lose her.\u201d</p><p>Erin blinked and a fat tear ran down her cheek. Erin never got choked up. \u201cDo you think she knows how much I care about her? Love her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe absolutely knows,\u201d Mel said with a nod. \u201cAnd you know what? When I see her next, which I\u2019m sure will be soon, I\u2019ll remind her.\u201d</p><p>Back at the cabin Ian paced for nearly an hour. He hadn\u2019t been nice to the sister and he regretted that. He could have tried harder with her, reassured her a little so she\u2019d feel okay about Marcie being here. Instead he\u2019d pushed them away.</p><p>He shouldn\u2019t have let her stay in the first place, Ian thought. He should have told Mel it would be best to take Marcie back to town, to Doc\u2019s. Damned little freckle-faced midget. There were a dozen things he didn\u2019t like being reminded of. Like, he wasn\u2019t a hermit\u2014he was lonely. But he didn\u2019t fit in most places, so he kept it to himself. Still, he hated not singing in church when singing felt so good. He didn\u2019t like sitting alone in a bar, far in the corner, mute and unfriendly, trying to remain unapproachable. And he hadn\u2019t had a good belly laugh in a long, long time. Until Marcie.</p><p>For the first time since he hit this county, he wanted things. Like soup bowls instead of mugs and cans to eat soup out of. Things he thought he didn\u2019t need, like a few creature comforts. A radio. She was right\u2014a person who loved music should hear some from time to time.</p><p>And he wanted someone to care enough about him to try to find him. He wanted someone to love him. It had been so long since anyone had loved him.</p><p>But the worst thing she\u2019d made him realize was that this skinny little redhead had held up through Bobby\u2019s devastating demise better than he had. And she\u2019d had to work through it every day, every damn day, while he\u2019d merely run away from it. I\u2019m the weak one, he thought dismally, and she\u2019s the one with the strength of a thousand soldiers.</p><p>He went to his trunk, dug deep, and brought out the stack of letters. He put them on the table under the light. Then he went to the cupboard, reached far into the back and located a bottle of Canadian Mist that had barely been tapped, putting it on the table with the letters. He found a glass, poured himself a shot and threw it back.</p><p>And then, without warning, the door to his cabin opened and she walked right in as if she owned the place. She toted all her gear: sleeping bag, duffel, backpack and purse, dropping it all where it had been previously stowed, at the foot of that sagging couch. He hoped all the hair on his face hid the elation that he could feel glow there. \u201cI could\u2019ve been naked,\u201d he said.</p><p>She smiled and walked over to the table, pulled out the chair and sat down opposite him. \u201cAh yes\u2014that would be the thrill of my life, right? We drinking tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI decided it was cold enough for a shot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I join you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour sister waiting outside?\u201d he asked, getting up to find another glass. He turned up a plastic tumbler and gave it to her.</p><p>Marcie poured herself a little splash of the whiskey. \u201cNah. I sent her home. I had to promise to call every couple of days and get home by Christmas, so I guess I could be some trouble for you. I mean, some more trouble. Sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your mission here? Exactly? You think you\u2019re going to straighten me out, clean me up presentable, do some kind of good deed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh brother, are you ever feeling sorry for yourself. You probably shouldn\u2019t drink if you\u2019re that screwed up\u2014this stuff is a depressant, you know.\u201d He stiffened abruptly. \u201cMy mission, as you call it, is pretty simple. There are these stupid baseball cards. Bobby told me in letters that you were a collector, too\u2014I brought them. Bobby\u2019s cards.\u201d</p><p>She went to her duffel, dug around and brought out an album in which Bobby\u2019s collection was carefully preserved. She put it on the table.</p><p>\u201cThis is difficult to explain. For some reason, the idea of the two of you talking about these baseball cards in the middle of a war, in a desert, staying alert for bombs and snipers was something I never got over.\u201d She took a breath. \u201cI want you to understand\u2014they\u2019re hard to let go of, only because they were his. He thought they were awesome. He\u2019d want you to have them.\u201d</p><p>Ian didn\u2019t touch the album. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just give them to me right away?\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cBecause I was sick. And you didn\u2019t want to talk about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t think I could.\u201d He stared down at the table for a moment, then lifted his eyes. \u201cThat\u2019s it, then? The baseball cards?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was a time, way back, when we wrote, kind of leaned on each other because Bobby got hurt. Then you dropped out of sight. Went missing. So, I came to meet you, or re-meet you, to thank you, make sure you were all right, tell you about your father. And, as it turns out, you seem to be fine. In some ways, better off than me. You live exactly as you like, talk to people when you want and seek solitude when it feels good, have a relationship with nature and aren\u2019t burdened with worries or things. You don\u2019t carry much of a load, on the outside at least\u2014you have only what you need. And I don\u2019t think you need cleaning up presentable. You look just fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said I looked like a wild man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do.\u201d She grinned at him. \u201cI\u2019m used to it now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat were you going to thank me for?\u201d he asked, replenishing his glass.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re kidding, right? Come on! For saving Bobby\u2019s life!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t do that. You shouldn\u2019t even think that. I have a lot of regrets, kid, but that\u2019s at the top of the list.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSaving him? Look, we\u2019re all sorry he was so badly hurt, that he was a helpless invalid. Beyond anyone\u2019s control...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think so? Because I think maybe I knew,\u201d he said. \u201cI lifted him and he was limp and heavy. There was a split second when I faced a choice. There was no muscle tension in his body\u2014he was nothing but dead weight. I could\u2019ve put him down right where he was, covered his body with mine to keep him from getting hit worse and waited it out\u2014the end. And then you wouldn\u2019t have been saddled with the burden and pain you\u2019ve had to carry for three years and he\u2019d have been free. God, you were just a kid. And I knew Bobby didn\u2019t want that life\u2014men in combat talk about things like that. But I was selfish. I was thinking about myself\u2014I acted the way I was trained to react, and I just couldn\u2019t face letting him go. I was acting like I wanted to be a goddamn hero.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She stared at him for a long moment. \u201cHoly Jesus,\u201d she finally said. \u201cIs that how you think it was? That it was up to you? And that your actions made my life a nightmare?\u201d She shook her head. \u201cThat\u2019s not how it was. You should\u2019ve just read the damn letters!\u201d</p><p>He stared down at the pile in front of him. Then he lifted his eyes to hers. So, she\u2019d been into his stuff, found them, knew they\u2019d never been opened.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s how it was\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMarcie,\u201d he said, his eyes darkening in regret. Pain. \u201cDon\u2019t, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, I thought I was the one who needed to understand,\u201d she said, taking a delicate sip of the liquor. She made a face and pursed her lips, then said, \u201cYou\u2019re gonna listen now. We lost our mom when Drew was only two, I was four, and Erin was eleven. Our dad raised us, but when I was fifteen he died suddenly\u2014it was a coronary during a routine knee surgery. Very unusual, very rare. Erin was a recent college graduate, headed for law school, so she stepped in, became the parent, and we all stayed in the house that Dad raised us in and, of course, when Bobby went to Iraq, I lived there with Erin and Drew while he was gone. When we brought him home, that\u2019s where we brought him. That\u2019s where we were when you visited us\u2014and we weren\u2019t very good at that whole thing. We\u2014all of us\u2014were so new to caregiving, it must have looked to you like we weren\u2019t going to survive it. It must have looked terrible...\u201d</p><p>He remembered; there were days he\u2019d had trouble putting it out of his mind. The house was a disaster, Marcie was skinny and pale and alone, she looked about thirteen. The hospital bed dominated the dining room so it was the first thing you saw when you walked in the house, leaving the family nowhere to have a meal. There was other medical equipment standing around the place\u2014a fancy wheelchair with a head brace, hydraulic lifts, weights for counterbalance when moving that dead weight, a suction machine, oxygen tanks, basins, linens.</p><p>\u201cWe had to bring him home or leave him in a long-term care facility in another state. After a couple of months we got him into a civilian nursing home\u2014an excellent place, with the military picking up the tab through CHAMPUS. I can thank Erin for that\u2014she wouldn\u2019t give up. Bobby had a large family\u2014he was the youngest of seven\u2014and we were all in it together, God bless them. They\u2019ve been such a wonderful help\u2014family to me in every way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCHAMPUS?\u201d Ian heard himself ask.</p> <p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t always work out so good. A lot of wounded soldiers who need long-term care are assigned to military hospitals wherever there\u2019s space, and it has nothing to do with where the family lives. I faced leaving Bobby in D.C. or the East Coast or Texas, but...We were very lucky. He had the best. And Ian\u2014he might\u2019ve looked pathetic, but there was no indication he was in any pain or stress. We pampered him, kept him totally comfortable at all times, and there were so many of us to do that. Bobby\u2019s whole family\u2014his mom and dad, six brothers and sisters and their spouses, nieces and nephews, me, Drew, and yes, even Erin got right in there. He was massaged, read to, kissed and hugged. He was almost never alone. We had a visiting schedule\u2014he was always checked on and covered. Ian\u2014it wasn\u2019t torture for me. Losing him hurt, of course, but really, I lost him so long ago that by the time he passed...\u201d</p><p>\u201cRelief?\u201d Ian asked reflexively.</p><p>\u201cFor him,\u201d she said. \u201cFor me, the end of a long journey. You should\u2019ve read the damn letters!\u201d</p><p>He just shook his head. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to know he was dead. Didn\u2019t want to know he was still alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was alive, comfortable, cared for and loved.\u201d She nodded toward the letters. \u201cI wrote you about him, but also about me\u2014it was really hard at first, grieving Bobby as though he\u2019d already gone\u2014but then my life became almost normal. I got out with friends quite a bit. I took a couple of vacations\u2014Bobby\u2019s parents insisted on it. I wrote you all about them, don\u2019t ask me why. Hell, I wrote you everything. Every stupid thing. Like you were my best friend, not Bobby\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you were still tied to a\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, I wasn\u2019t,\u201d she said, shaking her head. \u201cI loved Bobby. We knew he wasn\u2019t going to recover. Bobby\u2019s family tried to get me out, introduce me to people\u2014sometimes male people. If I\u2019d wanted freedom from him, from those obligations, no one in my family or his would have tried to talk me out of it. In fact, there were lots of discussions about things like that\u2014like breaking me loose through divorce so I could pursue another relationship, about pulling the feeding tube so he would just die, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just do that, Marcie? Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause, Ian. Feeding him was part of keeping him comfortable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what if he was thinking in there?\u201d Ian said, a note of pained desperation in his voice. \u201cWhat if it was torture for him, thinking how much he hated living like that, not being able to move or communicate?\u201d</p><p>She smiled gently. \u201cIf he was able to think of things like that, then he was also thinking about the legions of loved ones dedicating themselves to keeping him safe and cared for until he could make the last part of his journey.\u201d</p><p>A long piece of silence separated them. \u201cAnd none of them was me,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>\u201cYou had your own issues,\u201d she said easily, sipping her drink. \u201cBobby\u2019s injuries were physical\u2014yours were emotional. Everyone is entitled to have space to recover. Besides, you gave me the one thing I needed most, and for that I\u2019ll be grateful forever. I had a chance to say goodbye. He was real important to me, Ian. Even though he wasn\u2019t himself, I really needed to hold him in my arms, tell him I loved him so much, and that it was all right for him to move on\u2014that I\u2019d be fine. Do you have any idea how much that meant to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven though you had so much to\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI just told you\u2014it wasn\u2019t too much. We were busy, yeah. But everyone felt like I did\u2014on different levels. He was his mother\u2019s baby\u2014she needed that time. His father\u2019s pride\u2014he needed time, too. Bobby was amazing\u2014his brothers and sisters needed that time to say goodbye.\u201d</p><p>Ian was quiet for a moment before he said, \u201cIf I\u2019d read the goddamn letters, I might\u2019ve been one of the people to pitch in, in case he was thinking in there, counting faces...\u201d</p><p>She was quiet for a moment. Then she tipped the bottle over both their glasses. \u201cWant help finding more things to be guilty and regretful about, since your original ideas aren\u2019t covering all the bases? As I understand it, you were barely home from a miserable war, broke up with your fianc\u00e9e, fell out with your dad, left the Marine Corps, to which you thought you\u2019d give at least twenty years. So, Bobby\u2019s injuries were just one more thing, and all the family is so grateful you risked your life to try to save him.\u201d She took a sip. \u201cIan, no one\u2019s mad at you for not being around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. You sure about that?\u201d</p><p>She leveled him with a determined green-eyed stare. Then she snatched the pile of letters and dragged them over to her. \u201cLet\u2019s start right here.\u201d She snapped off the rubber band and, once she saw they were stacked in order of delivery, lifted the first one and opened it.</p><p>\u201c\u2018Dear Ian,\u2019\u201d she read.</p><p>\u201cI hope you\u2019re well. You\u2019ve been out of sight for too, too long and I miss you so much. It would be so nice to hear from you. I want you to know that Bobby\u2019s been moved to a wonderful nursing home. His entire family and my entire family work together to be sure that he\u2019s always around loved ones. We help with some of his care, but there\u2019s an awesome staff here. He\u2019s not in pain. Really. Of course we don\u2019t know everything, but doctors have run every test imaginable and examined him a hundred times\u2014he feels nothing from his neck down. And he never exhibits any symptoms of tension or anxiety. I\u2019ve been told he could make tears if he felt suffering. Ian, there are no tears. In fact, even though they say I\u2019m crazy, I think sometimes I see the closest thing to a smile.</p><p>\u201cMy life feels strangely normal. I work at the insurance company\u2014same job, same friends. I don\u2019t make a lot of money but my boss is real flexible; he\u2019s a great guy\u2014he brings his yellow Lab to work with him every day. Bobby\u2019s wonderful mother insists I have nights out with some of the girlfriends who were keeping me busy while the two of you were in Iraq\u2014we even go dancing sometimes, but a couple of them are pregnant so more often we do movies, dinners out, picnics in summer and parties with our gang in winter. I seem to have inherited a really large family and huge group of friends, almost all married with families. They\u2019re the same friends I\u2019ve had for years\u2014there are three girlfriends from high school I\u2019ve known forever and four women from work I\u2019ve known since I started there. You\u2019d think working together every day, we\u2019d get sick of each other\u2014but we still drive the boss crazy talking and laughing all the time.</p><p>\u201cI like to take my time with Bobby in the early mornings before work\u2014but not every day. Most days, though, when he\u2019s just coming awake, I like to be the first person he senses. Don\u2019t laugh at me now, but I think he can smell me. He turns his head toward me and I can tell he knows. Then I like the evenings. Reading to him relaxes us both. I\u2019ve been reading Bobby Ivanhoe\u2014it\u2019s just amazing how much I get into this story by reading aloud. I have no clue if he\u2019s hearing me, and I\u2019m sure he isn\u2019t understanding me, but I almost can\u2019t wait to get to the nursing home and start the next chapter. Bobby has read more good books since he was injured than he ever did before. I get right up on the bed with him to read and sometimes he turns his head toward me and seems to nuzzle me, burrow his head into my shoulder....\u201d</p><p>Marcie read on, through a dozen letters, every once in a while replenishing her glass and his. At one point she got up and fixed herself a glass of cold well water, but continued on. Eventually, the letters contained more about her and less about Bobby, because of course he remained unchanged. She had written all about her trip to British Columbia, about the charm, the landscape, the friendly people. Then there was an all-girls cruise for four days, three nights. She took Ian through two years of her life as the wife of a disabled marine, as a sister, a sister-in-law, daughter-in-law, friend. There were family gatherings, new births, weddings, things that were normal. She had a falling-out with a close girlfriend that alienated them for a few weeks and in the next letter explained how they worked it all out. She told him about a bad haircut, about her younger brother Drew\u2019s plethora of girlfriends and his careless ways with them. She even reported on the VW\u2019s broken fuel pump.</p><p>The letters were more about Marcie\u2019s life than Bobby\u2019s. And Marcie\u2019s life was not the torture he\u2019d envisioned. But the thing that had him riveted was that she wrote to him as if he were an old friend. An important friend. And she always included her phone number, asking him to call her collect anytime. And she always closed with \u201cMiss you...\u201d</p><p>Then came the most recent letter, written last year, telling him that Bobby had passed, sweetly and quietly, and as divine luck would have it, she had been there. Since she was only there for a couple of hours a day and took some days off on occasion, she considered this a small miracle. She was cradling his head in her arm, reading, when she realized he hadn\u2019t moved his head or eyes or mouth in a long while. She felt for a pulse, put her face against his to see if he was breathing. \u201c\u2018And I knew right away.... Not from the absence of pulse or breath really...It was as if I felt his spirit leave him. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ll understand this\u2014it was a great relief to know that all this time his spirit had been there while we all loved him so well. I had always thought it possible that his spirit had gone home long before his body would release its hold\u2014but I swear to you, I had a fullness in my heart as though he\u2019d passed through me as he departed. And I said, \u201cGoodbye, darling Bobby. We\u2019ll all miss you.\u201d And I was so happy for him.\u2019\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It was quite late when she\u2019d finished reading that last letter to him. The level in the bottle was considerably lower, but they hadn\u2019t killed it. She plunked the last envelope down on the stack and they were quiet. Ian sniffed quietly once or twice, then wiped impatiently at his eyes.</p><p>Finally Marcie said, \u201cI might need an escort to the loo. I\u2019m a little drunk.\u201d</p><p>It broke through his sadness, changing his mood yet again. \u201cYou think?\u201d he asked, smiling.</p> <p>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t exactly have your height and girth. And I\u2019m a small drinker\u2014couple of beers or wines or fruity things. Truth is, I\u2019m worried about standing up....\u201d</p><p>He laughed at her. \u201cNo one held you down and poured it down your neck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s awful reading letters you\u2019ve written. All the bad sentences, terrible spelling, stupid remarks...I bet when you go to hell, they just read every letter you ever wrote out loud.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled and stood. He said, \u201cCome on, lightweight, I\u2019ll take you out.\u201d But what he thought was, they were beautiful letters. If he\u2019d actually read them, they might have helped him get his head straight a little quicker. The one thing he\u2019d been missing in his life\u2014someone who cared about him\u2014she\u2019d offered him a long time ago.</p><p>He walked her to the outhouse, stood outside while she took her turn, then escorted her back to the cabin before making his run. She flopped on the couch and rolled over on her side without taking her boots off, without pulling up the quilt. He shook his head at her. \u201cYou\u2019re going to sleep good.\u201d Then he pulled her boots off and covered her.</p> <p>\u201cHmm. That\u2019s the last time you get me drunk, Buchanan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I said, I didn\u2019t hold you down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI sense a problem. I got real used to the taste.\u201d And then she hiccupped.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be gone when you come out of it,\u201d he reminded her. \u201cI\u2019ve got some wood to deliver in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Yeah, I know that. Do I still have my library books?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I could get to the library in the hour you were gone today?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, never mind. Good night, my sweet bear.\u201d</p><p>Oh, God, how that made his heart swell and lurch. Before he could stop himself, he bent his lips to her temple and placed a soft kiss there. Her hand came up, stroked his hairy face, and she hummed. \u201cThe only problem with this is that I can hardly tell when you smile. I so love it when you smile.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood night, lightweight.\u201d</p><p>While Marcie slept the sleep of the drunk, Ian paged through the album of baseball cards. He imagined Bobby\u2019s fingers on every one. Tears ran out of his eyes, washing the remorse and pain out of his soul. She might never know how much this simple gift meant.</p><p>Twelve</p><p>W hen Marcie finally opened her eyes, there was a marching band on parade in her head\u2014a dull thumping that seemed to have a beat. Whoa. She\u2019d sipped her way through twelve or fourteen letters. Bad idea. But she knew where Ian kept the aspirin.</p><p>She sat up carefully. The room was in order, as Ian always left it. Even the letters were tucked away; the baseball card album still on the table where she\u2019d left it. The coffeepot rested on the woodstove, which needed a couple of logs. She fed the stove first, then put on her boots and took a trip out back, and when she returned she just about chugged the thick, black coffee even though it wasn\u2019t quite hot enough. A glance at her watch told her that Ian wouldn\u2019t be back for a while, and having now learned the ways of stoves, she decided to take advantage of his absence to freshen up. She heated the water for her hair first, then the tub. Then she went through the tedious process of emptying the tub, which was more trouble than filling it. By the time she was done with all that, she was actually tired, which had more to do with staying up late and drinking than the flu. In fact, she had hardly coughed at all.</p><p>After washing her hair and bathing, she took her manicure scissors to her damaged bangs and managed to snip away the charred ends, combing it into some order. Her small makeup mirror showed she had a slight, healthy glow; the burn was healed, or nearly so. She applied a little makeup, something she hadn\u2019t bothered with since arriving. But she\u2019d forced her presence on Ian over and over again\u2014it wouldn\u2019t hurt to be presentable. She gave some attention to her eyes, lined her lips. She opened one of those cans of stew, ate about half, then she settled on the couch with her book, a new woman.</p> <p>Without warning, the new woman vanished. Suddenly she knew\u2014it was a year ago today. Funny, she hadn\u2019t thought of that even once while she was reading through all those letters\u2014not even the one with the date of Bobby\u2019s passing in it. December 17, a week before Christmas.</p><p>It had been a very odd experience. Once she\u2019d known Bobby was gone, she stayed right where she was, holding him. She didn\u2019t cry; she didn\u2019t call for a nurse or aide. And while she held him she communicated with her heart, telling him to be happy where he was. It was at least an hour before anyone came into the room\u2014a sixty-year-old nurse\u2019s aide, bringing around linens for the morning shift. \u201cYou\u2019re here late,\u201d the woman said.</p><p>And Marcie was stroking Bobby\u2019s cheek, running her fingers through his hair, holding him close. She didn\u2019t respond. She knew once she let go of him this time, she wouldn\u2019t be able to hold him again. Something about the way she was touching him must have tipped off the aide because she came over to the bed and put her fingers to Bobby\u2019s neck. \u201cMrs. Sullivan,\u201d she said gently.</p><p>\u201cI know. I\u2019m having a little trouble letting go...\u201d Marcie murmured.</p><p>\u201cI understand. I\u2019ll call someone for you. That usually helps. Someone will come and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould you put that off for just a little while? Could you give me just a little more time with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll finish my rounds with the linens and then I\u2019ll have the charge nurse make a call. Would you like it to be to his parents? Or maybe to your sister?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall his parents,\u201d she said. \u201cThey should be the first to know. Then would you please call Erin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d Then she smiled sweetly and gave Marcie\u2019s brow a loving stroke. Surely she\u2019d seen every bizarre reaction to death in this place. \u201cTake your time here. Take all the time you need.\u201d</p><p>And when the aide left the room, Marcie had picked up the book she\u2019d been reading to Bobby and continued to read. She read aloud to him for almost another hour\u2014his body had grown cool to the touch. He was so completely lifeless, it rather amazed her. She would have thought there wouldn\u2019t be much change in him, in his body, since he was so still even when he was alive, but the change in him was remarkable. She had never sensed tension in him until he passed, and then a complete relaxation settled over his facial features and he looked positively beautiful. Ethereal. Complete peace took over. And then he became so quiet. Cool. Hard. Still. Gone.</p><p>Mr. and Mrs. Sullivan came into the room and rushed to her. They found her with Bobby in her arms, the book open on her lap. \u201cMarcie? What are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t ready to leave him,\u201d she said softly, her voice clear, her eyes dry.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s in shock,\u201d Mrs. Sullivan said to her husband. \u201cWe should call the\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not in shock,\u201d Marcie said. Then she laughed lightly. \u201cGood Lord, I\u2019ve been expecting this for three years. But now it\u2019s here, I know I won\u2019t touch him again and I\u2019m having a little trouble giving him up....\u201d</p><p>The book was pulled out of her hands, she was drawn off the bed, to her feet, away from him. His parents kissed him goodbye and the sheet was pulled over him. Marcie went to him and pulled the sheet back. There was no reason to hide him\u2014he looked as if he was asleep. She smoothed back his soft, dark hair.</p><p>\u201cMarcie, the mortuary was called. They\u2019ll be here soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in no hurry,\u201d she said. It wasn\u2019t as though there were decisions to make\u2014all the arrangements had been made a couple of years before. They\u2019d take him away, he\u2019d be cremated and there would be a memorial for him. But until they took him, wasn\u2019t he still hers?</p><p>\u201cHe belongs to a higher authority now.\u201d It was her sister\u2019s voice. \u201cYou can let go of him without the slightest worry. He\u2019s in good hands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid I say that out loud?\u201d Marcie asked. \u201cDid I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay what, sweetheart?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat until the funeral people came for him, he was still mine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, baby. You didn\u2019t say anything. I could tell, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just want to be close to him until they come....\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can stay here, just like this, as long as you like. To hell with funeral people. They can wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said softly, sitting again on the bed. She touched him, kissed his cheek and brow, whispered to him. Her in-laws thought she was losing it, but Erin held them off. Marcie heard Erin in the hall outside the room. \u201cCut her some slack. It\u2019s a lot to give up. She\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>And when they came to take Bobby away, Marcie gave him one last kiss and let him go. Then she embraced her in-laws, told them she was sorry for their loss, and went home.</p><p>She felt tears on her cheeks, but she didn\u2019t feel pain. Just that loneliness that sometimes plagued her. That sense of no longer being attached to Bobby, a feeling of having no purpose.</p><p>It was another hour before Ian came home. And when he walked in, she knew what had taken him so long. His hair and beard were dramatically sheared, clipped short and neatly trimmed. He had grocery sacks in his arms. He tried not to, but it was obvious, he was smiling.</p><p>\u201cIan!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s me. You expecting someone else?\u201d</p><p>She looked up at him and forgot everything. \u201cWhat have you done?\u201d</p><p>He walked straight to the table and put down his sacks. \u201cI have more stuff to get, so sit tight.\u201d And he left the cabin again. When he returned with a couple of boxes stacked high on top of each other, she was sitting in the same place. He put those on the table, as well. Then he finally turned toward her, letting her look him over. She stood and took slow steps toward him and her hand rose to touch his cheek. Where there had been a good five or six inches of bushy beard was now less than a half inch of brownish-red beard, combed into place, soft as down. Even his neck was shaved.</p><p>\u201cWhere is my wilderness lunatic?\u201d</p><p>He frowned at her and touched her cheek gently. \u201cHave you been crying?\u201d</p><p>She glanced away. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I had one of those days.\u201d</p><p>He put his thumb and forefinger on her chin and pulled her eyes back to his. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d he asked softly. \u201cNeed to talk about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, shaking her head. \u201cI know you don\u2019t want to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. What made you cry? Homesick? Lonesome?\u201d</p><p>She took a deep breath. \u201cIt was a year ago today. Snuck up on me, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d he said. He put his big arms around her. \u201cThat would make some tears, I guess. I\u2019m sorry, Marcie. I\u2019m sure it still hurts sometimes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s just it\u2014it doesn\u2019t exactly hurt. It\u2019s just that I feel so useless.\u201d She leaned against him. \u201cSometimes I feel all alone. I have lots of people in my life and can still feel so alone without Bobby.\u201d She laughed softly. \u201cAnd God knows, he wasn\u2019t much company.\u201d</p><p>He tightened his embrace. \u201cI think I understand.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, she thought, he might. Here was a guy who was around people regularly, yet completely unconnected to them. She pulled away and asked, \u201cWhy did you do this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought I could clean up a little and take you somewhere.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWait. You didn\u2019t think I needed you to do this for me, did you? Because of Erin?\u201d</p><p>He laughed, and she could actually see the emotion on his face, given the absence of wild beard. \u201cActually, if you\u2019d asked me to, I probably wouldn\u2019t have. You really think you can match me for stubborn? Probably not. I kept the beard because of the scar,\u201d he said, leaning his left cheek toward her. \u201cThat, and maybe a bit of attitude of who cares?\u201d</p><p>She gently fingered the beard apart to reveal a barely noticeable scar. \u201cIt\u2019s hardly there at all. Ian, it\u2019s only a thin line. You don\u2019t have to cover it. You\u2019re not disfigured.\u201d She smiled at him. \u201cYou\u2019re handsome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMemories from the scar, probably. Anyway, tonight is the truckers\u2019 Christmas parade. A bunch of eighteen-wheelers in the area dress up their rigs and parade down the freeway. I see it every year\u2014fantastic. You think you\u2019re up to it? With it being that anniversary?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMaybe it\u2019s a good idea,\u201d she said. \u201cGetting out, changing the mood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll eat out and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s all this?\u201d she asked, looking at the bags and boxes.</p><p>\u201cSnow\u2019s forecast. It\u2019s just what you do up here. Be ready. But this time I got some different things, in case you\u2019re sick of stew. And I never do this\u2014but you\u2019re a girl, so I bought some fresh greens. And fresh eggs. Just enough to last a couple of days. No fridge; and they\u2019ll freeze if we leave \u2019em in the shed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIan, what about the bathroom? What will we do about the bathroom if there\u2019s a heavy snow?\u201d</p> <p>He laughed at her. \u201cNo problem. We\u2019ll tromp out there fine\u2014but I\u2019ll shovel a path. And I\u2019ll plow out to the road, but it\u2019s slow going and if the snow keeps coming, it\u2019s going to be even slower.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow. Is it safe to leave tonight? For the parade? Will we get back in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have blizzards, Marcie. Snow falls slow, but steady. Now, I\u2019m thinking bath day. How about you?\u201d</p><p>She put her hands on her hips and looked up at him with a glare. \u201cAll right, be very careful here. I\u2019ve had my bath. And a hair wash. I\u2019m wearing makeup, Ian. Jesus. You wanna try to clean me up?\u201d</p><p>His eyes grew large for a moment. Then he said. \u201cBath day for me, I meant. I knew. You look great.\u201d His thumb ran along her cheek under one eye. \u201cJust a couple of tear marks, but you can take care of that. Let me put this stuff away and get my water ready. You have something to read? Or are you looking for the thrill of your life?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have something to read,\u201d she said. And, she thought, at the end of the day, they all turn out to be just men.</p> <p>Ian had in mind an Italian restaurant in Arcata, a place he\u2019d been a time or two. When he\u2019d been before, he always just ate at the bar, alone. This time, at a table with a glass of red wine each, there was talking. It was hardly possible to remember the man who merely grunted or complained that he didn\u2019t need to have people around. Marcie made no comment about the change; tomorrow would mark ten days. One more week would bring Christmas.</p><p>He wanted to know what kind of little girl she had been.</p><p>\u201cBad, very bad. I took the term tomboy to the next level. I didn\u2019t have any little girlfriends, just the boys. I could take all of \u2019em, but even though I thought I was a boy I fought like a girl\u2014biting, hair pulling. I went from slingshots to spitballs and my dad got called to school a lot. I was a bratty little carrottop, the smallest, meanest one in my class.\u201d</p><p>He grinned largely. So beautifully. \u201cHow does this not surprise me? You\u2019re a little better mannered now, but not much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen the cutest boy in ninth grade got a crush on me. My first thought was\u2014bet I can take him. My next thought was, bet I can get him to kiss me. It turned me into a girl overnight\u2014a total transformation. Bobby. Erin Elizabeth was prissy from the day she was born and you can\u2019t imagine how it killed me to ask her for advice on looking pretty. She was so damn smug about it, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBobby? Since ninth grade?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh. We went steady all through school, married at nineteen. Barely nineteen.\u201d</p><p>He just shook his head. \u201cAwful young.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAwful,\u201d she said. \u201cOur families wanted us to wait, but it didn\u2019t take too much convincing\u2014we couldn\u2019t keep our hands off each other. I think everyone went along with the wedding just to cool us down. But there were a lot of bad jokes\u2014like I was wearing training pants under the gown. That sort of thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd did it? Cool you down?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKept us from pawing each other in public, at least,\u201d she said with a grin. \u201cNow you have to step up, Buchanan, and tell some things\u2014you were star of the high-school musical. You probably had girls all over you. Huh?\u201d</p><p>One corner of his mouth lifted. \u201cI was pretty much a slut,\u201d he said, making her laugh so loud that people\u2019s heads turned in the restaurant.</p><p>\u201cNo morals,\u201d she interpreted.</p><p>\u201cFew,\u201d he said. \u201cI was on my way to getting some girl I barely loved in trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBarely loved? Did you tell them you loved them to get in their pants?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe fair\u2014I was a teenage boy!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did! You\u2019re such a dog!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was a pup, that\u2019s what I was. The Marine Corps was my dad\u2019s idea, but the joke was on him. Not only did I take to it, but spruced-up marines have no trouble getting girls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy little brother, Drew, I think maybe he\u2019s a lot like you. He\u2019s a gorgeous little devil. Smart and so funny he can make you laugh till you leave a little wet spot on the floor\u2014and he has a different girl every month. He\u2019s such a screw-off, it\u2019s hard to believe he\u2019s going to be a doctor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoctor?\u201d Ian asked, mouth full.</p><p>\u201cUh-huh\u2014he\u2019s a med student now. My sister\u2019s a lawyer, my brother will be a doctor and I barely made it out of high school.\u201d</p><p>Ian swallowed. \u201cCome on\u2014I bet you were an honor student.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. I was pretty much a B average on a good report card. But then I had other things on my mind\u2014like fun, Bobby, et cetera. I\u2019m much more serious now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish I\u2019d known you then\u2014you must have been a real loose cannon. So what kind of doctor do you think your little brother will be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt this rate? A gynecologist.\u201d</p><p>The bantering went on all through dinner. For Marcie it was wonderfully pleasant and fun, but not different than her life had been\u2014being with someone, talking, laughing. She suspected it was very different for Ian, at least lately. By the way his eyes grew more golden than brown, she assumed it felt good.</p><p>The truck parade happened after dinner, when it was good and dark. They parked along a high road and watched from the truck until that wasn\u2019t good enough and they got out and sat on the warm hood. The trucks were, as he said, magnificent. The flashing, sparkling lights, Santas perched atop, even Nativities, snow scenes and Christmas trees set up on long flatbeds. Every color under the rainbow was represented and, for good measure, the drivers blasted their horns in response to the gallery of viewers who waved and applauded.</p><p>After standing out in the cold for a while, then riding back toward home in a truck with a poor heater, Marcie was shivering. So Ian suggested they swing through town before heading up the mountain. If it wasn\u2019t too late, they could get a quick toddy to warm them up.</p><p>The tree lit their way into town, so majestic, that star creating just the right path. When they walked into Jack\u2019s there were quite a few people, the lights dimmed, the fire in the hearth blazing. They chose to sit up at the bar in front of a grinning bartender. \u201cEvening,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>\u201cI wonder if I might use the phone, since I\u2019m here?\u201d Marcie said. \u201cI should check in, make sure Erin had no trouble getting home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bet. Can I set you up something to come back to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about a brandy,\u201d she said, jumping off the stool. \u201cSomething nice and smooth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got it.\u201d And when she\u2019d gone to the kitchen, Jack said to Ian, \u201cAnd you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSchnapps, thanks.\u201d</p><p>Jack put a couple of drinks on the bar. \u201cYou take advantage of the holiday special at the Haircuts R Us store?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFunny. I thought you talked when they talked, shut up when they didn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe read faces, too. You\u2019re completely un-miserable\u2014a new look for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI took Marcie to see the truck parade,\u201d he said. \u201cYou ever see that truck parade?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCouple of times. Mel and my sister took the baby over, but I had a full house tonight. That damn tree\u2014been bringing \u2019em in from miles away. I\u2019m expecting the wise men to pop in here any second.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a bad-looking tree,\u201d Ian said.</p><p>\u201cThanks, but it\u2019s going to be smaller next year. Mel\u2019s set on a big tree like that, but you have no idea what a pain in the butt it was. Almost had to rent a flatbed to bring it home.\u201d</p><p>Ian chuckled and took a sip of his drink. \u201cWhat got you up here, Jack? To Virgin River?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter twenty in the Marines? I was just looking for some peace and quiet so I could catch my breath. And think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat a fact? And here I thought it was an original idea.\u201d</p><p>Jack laughed. \u201cWell, then Melinda showed up, and now peace and quiet is a thing of the past.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a rough spot you got yourself in,\u201d Ian observed.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Jack said. \u201cBeautiful blonde in my bed every morning when I wake up. I\u2019m telling you, the suffering just won\u2019t end.\u201d There was a quick flash of a grin, and before Ian could think of a comeback, Marcie was sitting up beside him.</p><p>\u201cAll\u2019s well,\u201d she reported. She took a slow sip of her brandy and made a sigh of pleasure. \u201cVery nice, Jack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know when you\u2019re headed home, Marcie, but there\u2019s a Christmas Eve thing going on here. Since there\u2019s no church open in town and Preacher closes up on Christmas Day to have it with his family, on Christmas Eve the townsfolk are having a candlelight gathering around the tree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? What time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t be a midnight mass, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d he laughed. \u201cMostly ranchers and farmers around here\u2014they start early in the morning, even on Christmas. Last I heard it was scheduled for eight o\u2019clock for about an hour. I\u2019m taking the family to Sacramento for the holidays, so we\u2019ll miss it. But if you\u2019re still here, stop by.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll keep that in mind,\u201d she said.</p><p>The brandy and schnapps didn\u2019t keep them warm all the way home and when they arrived, Ian first stoked the fire, getting it going before walking Marcie out to the facilities. They both remained in jackets and boots until the cabin heated up a little. Marcie finally spread her sleeping bag over the couch. She took off her boots, but left her clothes on, wrapping herself up in her bag to try to generate some warmth.</p><p>Ian was just unrolling his pallet and about to pull off his boots when she said, softly, \u201cThank you for a wonderful night, Ian. It\u2019s the best night I\u2019ve had in...years.\u201d And then he heard her yawn.</p><p>He didn\u2019t move; couldn\u2019t breathe. There was an odd sensation filling his chest, a gathering of moisture in his eyes. He wanted to say, No, thank you! But he couldn\u2019t trust himself to form the words. She had no idea how it changed him inside\u2014in his head and heart\u2014just to have someone to talk to, to laugh with. The scrappiest little girl on the playground, like an angel come to draw him out, made him feel for the first time in such a long time, as if he was living instead of merely existing. It was a gift he was sure he didn\u2019t deserve, especially after sealing himself off from the world as he had. And after trying to scare her away. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Trouble was, he didn\u2019t know if he could go back to his old, silent, anonymous ways. And yet, he didn\u2019t have anything else. The reality was, he had this cabin and about a couple thousand dollars that would have to last all winter. There was no hidden bank account, no benefit checks, no retirement. He could put the property up for sale, but there probably wouldn\u2019t be a buyer, maybe for years. He didn\u2019t have things to sell or barter.</p><p>He could beg her to stay, but he wasn\u2019t sure he\u2019d ever be able to even build her an indoor bathroom. He\u2019d let himself get down to practically nothing, enjoying the deprivation on some screwed-up level. Then Marcie showed up and suddenly he felt like a rich man.</p><p>Just when he felt ready to open his mouth to say something like, No, Marcie\u2014it was you who made it perfect, he heard a soft snore come from her side of the room. It made him shake his head and chuckle silently. She slept well on that lumpy sofa; she was at peace here when she should be annoyed by all the inconveniences.</p> <p>They were alike in that way, he realized. She was as able to make do as he was, yet in Marcie\u2019s life there was so much more\u2014family, work, friends, real living.</p><p>Quietly he traded his jeans for sweats and got down on his pallet in front of the fire. But sleep was far away. All he could think about was how real his life had suddenly become, how vast and full of possibilities when just two weeks ago an unending sameness had stretched out in front of him. Forever. It had been so long since he\u2019d even thought about what might come next for him, and sometimes it seemed there never would be a next.</p><p>Old habits die hard\u2014he thought this might be a good time to ignore her, reject her, hope that he\u2019d get beyond this emotion real fast. But he knew he wasn\u2019t going to do that. No. He would allow this to happen to him for a little while. She\u2019d fill him up with goodness before she left; he\u2019d tackle what to do with all those feelings later. Ian decided he could think of her as a Christmas gift. A beautiful little glimpse of what life could have been.</p><p>It was a long while before he slept. Not long after he nodded off, he felt something and opened his eyes. She was beside him on the floor by the stove, wrapped in her sleeping bag, red hair all crazy from sleep. \u201cI got cold, even with the sleeping bag,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll feed the fire,\u201d Ian replied, sitting up and slipping a couple of logs into the stove. Then he lay back down, giving her room on the pallet beside him and, pulling her close, said, \u201cCome here, little girl. Let me get you warm.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHmm. That\u2019s what I need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what I need,\u201d he said, giving her a kiss against her temple.</p><p>\u201cCan I tell you something?\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cMarcie, aren\u2019t you tired of talking yet?\u201d</p><p>She completely ignored him. \u201cIt\u2019s about that whole wedding thing,\u201d she said. \u201cYou know, with Shelly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not thinking about that right now,\u201d he said, pulling her closer against him.</p> <p>\u201cI know, but I just wanted to say\u2014I\u2019ve been in four weddings, including my own. Brides\u2014all of them, at one point or another\u2014have that moment, that meltdown, when it\u2019s all about them and their wedding. It\u2019s easy to forget it\u2019s about the marriage, but not about the wedding. But reality sets in real quick.\u201d She yawned. \u201cSome brides are worse than others, but Shelly probably didn\u2019t mean what she said.\u201d</p><p>He was quiet for a moment, not even able to conjure a memory or image of Shelly. He asked, \u201cFour?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFour weddings?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh. And a godmother twice, and I\u2019m going to be one again in March\u2014my friend Mable is having a boy, her first.\u201d</p><p>He gave a snort of laughter. \u201cYou have a friend named Mable?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh. She thinks it was her mother\u2019s revenge for making her sick during pregnancy. We all call her Maybe. She\u2019s married to William, who we call Will. They\u2019re Maybe Will to everyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re connected to a lot of people. That makes me happy, knowing that,\u201d he said.</p> <p>She snuggled closer. \u201cAnd now I\u2019m connected to you, too. That makes me happy.\u201d She yawned again. \u201cBut here\u2019s what I wanted to tell you, Ian. That thing with Shelly? I think maybe you dodged a bullet there.\u201d</p><p>He laughed softly, pulled her closer still. Oh yeah, he thought. He wasn\u2019t meant to end up with Shelly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be quiet now,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>When Ian had allowed himself to think about Marcie, his vision had been one of loneliness and despair. That\u2019s because he didn\u2019t know her as Abigail Adams, the sassy, indefatigable, positive woman she was; because he\u2019d never let himself know.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t see as far from the top of his mountain as he thought he could.</p><p>Thirteen</p><p>M arcie felt something on her hair and woke to look into Ian\u2019s rich brown eyes. Dawn was barely lighting the cabin and he was running his big hand over her curls. \u201cMorning,\u201d she said sleepily.</p><p>He didn\u2019t say anything. He just lowered his lips to hers and touched them gently, sweetly. She felt the brush of his beard, the soft flesh of his lips and let her eyes drop closed. He moved over her mouth for a moment. She moaned and slipped an arm around his neck, holding him there.</p><p>He pulled back just a little and whispered, \u201cWe\u2019re snowed in, honey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was jealous of Bobby, you know,\u201d Ian said, petting her hair back along her temple, moving it over her ear.</p><p>\u201cBe careful, Ian\u2014you\u2019re talking about \u2018it.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ready to tell you anything you want to know. We were all a little jealous of Bobby. He had something real special with you. You sent him panties.\u201d</p><p>Her cheeks warmed in spite of herself. Her eyes got very round. \u201cHe showed you?\u201d</p><p>Ian chuckled. \u201cHe showed everyone. Very skimpy panties. I think they were lime-green with black lace or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI cannot believe he showed you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was proud of them. He kept them tucked in his inside pocket like a good-luck charm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey were perfectly clean, I\u2019ll have you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, that almost comes as a disappointment,\u201d Ian said, chuckling. \u201cThey should have had your scent on them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey had Tide and Downy on them!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you sent him that picture\u2014on the motorcycle.\u201d</p><p>She put her hands over her face. In muffled tones she muttered, \u201cI\u2019m mortified.\u201d He pulled her hands away and lightly kissed her again. \u201cSo the night I almost froze to death was actually the second time you\u2019ve seen me in my underwear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTechnically, I\u2019ve seen your underwear a ton of times. I came home a couple of times to see your cute little rump sticking out of the covers, not to mention all that underwear on my tub, drying out,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I\u2019d trade my life to see you in your underwear again.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes got round for a minute, but then she smiled slightly and a little laugh escaped her. \u201cI\u2019ve heard some interesting come-ons in my limited experience, but that\u2019s a new one. Tell me, do I have to shoot you after you peek?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if I told you, you might have to shoot me to stop me? Would that scare you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t scare me, Ian. I know you\u2019d protect me from anything. Even yourself.\u201d</p><p>He pressed kisses all over her face and she held his face in her hands while he did so. His breathing came faster, rougher. \u201cI want you to know something,\u201d he said in a whisper. \u201cSomething like this happening with us\u2014it didn\u2019t cross my mind until\u2014\u201d</p><p>She waited. Finally she said, \u201cUntil?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUntil you came back. This doesn\u2019t have to happen, Marcie. Tell me if you don\u2019t want to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Ian.\u201d She laughed. \u201cYou talk too much!\u201d</p><p>The gold flecks in his eyes gleamed and he came down on her mouth harder, slipping an arm under her while he kissed her with heat, slipping his tongue into her mouth. Her other arm went around him, pulling him against her and, with a will of its own, her body arched against his, hungry. Not just starved in general, but for Ian, to whom she\u2019d bonded herself in so many ways.</p><p>Without breaking their kiss, his hands began to rove over her breasts, hips, thighs. He slipped a big hand under her sweater to touch her breast and sighed against her lips as he did so. Then he helped her out of her sweater and his big hands were on the snap of her jeans, slipping them down over her hips, her knees, until finally they were off. He tugged his T-shirt over his head, leaving him in just those soft sweats, and he stared down at her small body. \u201cGod above,\u201d he said in a reverent whisper.</p><p>\u201cIs this how you looked at me when you were saving my life? When you got me out of my clothes and warmed me?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, a naughty smile on his lips. \u201cThere was no funny business. This time, there\u2019s definitely going to be funny business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d she said, letting her eyes drift closed again. \u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her around her neck, shoulders, chest, biceps, tummy. All the while he ran a thumb under the elastic of a very small panty. \u201cHow do you feel about me chewing off your underwear?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She sucked in a breath, shuddered. \u201cI can always get new underwear...\u201d</p><p>It made him laugh deep in his throat. This was what he loved best\u2014her playfulness. Or maybe it was her small body, appearing fragile, but not. Or was it the fire on her head and the flashing green eyes? It might be quicker to list the things he didn\u2019t love, if he could think of any at all.</p><p>He made the bra disappear first, finding her nipples with his tongue, loving the sounds she made as he pampered her. Then he dropped his head to her belly and taking the elastic of her panties in his teeth, he dragged them down over her hips. He pulled them the rest of the way with a trembling hand and had his lips against hers again. He kissed her deeply, filling his hands with her hips, her smooth butt. \u201cA natural redhead...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, how could you doubt me?\u201d she asked breathlessly. \u201cEspecially after a couple of weeks in the woods...\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarcie, baby, I gotta have a taste. I have to.\u201d</p><p>She arched slightly. \u201cOh, my,\u201d she said. \u201cWell, if you have to, you have to...\u201d And her legs came apart slightly, making him growl.</p><p>He went down, parting her legs, burying his face in those red curls until he felt her fingers lock into his hair, felt her lunge against him and heard her panting cries. He rose somewhat reluctantly to capture her mouth again. \u201cHoney, you\u2019re ready for anything...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou,\u201d she whispered. \u201cYou\u2019re what I\u2019m ready for.\u201d</p><p>With one hand and a kick of his long legs, he was free of his sweats, planting himself between her legs. He tried to take it easy, finding her and entering slowly. But Marcie was in a hurry and lurched against him, pushing back. For a moment, when they were locked together, everything went still. With their eyes upon one another, their lips barely touching, they were quiet, motionless, just the breathing and the hot gaze between them, savoring their moment of joining. Then her eyes slowly drifted closed and her hips moved beneath him.</p><p>Ian covered her mouth in a hot, deep kiss and pumped his hips, holding on, waiting, moving gently, then fiercely, until he felt it all happen at once\u2014her fingers on his shoulders, digging in, her pelvis thrust against him, her insides pulsing in a fabulous joy that left him drenched in hot liquid. And he made the moment count, letting it all go, being with her through the ecstasy.</p><p>He held her for a long, quiet time, his lips on her neck, her lips on his shoulder, their bodies rising and falling with rapid breathing, moist with perspiration, calming down, recovering. Finally she whispered in his ear, \u201cWhat were you thinking while that happened, Ian?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Before he could come up with an answer, the truth came out. \u201cI was thinking, thank God I didn\u2019t forget how that was done.\u201d</p><p>She laughed, rubbing his back.</p><p>\u201cWhat were you thinking?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>\u201cI was thinking, thank God he didn\u2019t forget how that was done.\u201d</p><p>But he wasn\u2019t laughing anymore. The look on his face was dreamy. He brushed her hair away from her brow. \u201cYou\u2019re real special, Marcie,\u201d he said. \u201cI never saw this coming, but...\u201d He couldn\u2019t finish.</p><p>She put her palm against his cheek. \u201cThat\u2019s nice, Ian. You\u2019re awful special, too. And I let you get me naked when I\u2019d been with you ten days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou let me do more than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted you to make love to me. You must think I\u2019m a bad girl\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou are a bad girl, the best bad girl that was ever born,\u201d he said. \u201cThe meanest little carrottop on the playground. You\u2019re the best thing that ever happened in my life, Marcie. I was dying\u2014you knew that. You made a difference. It\u2019s what you always intended to be\u2014a difference.\u201d He grinned. \u201cLike Abigail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw. That\u2019s the nicest thing anyone ever said to me.\u201d</p><p>He brushed her lips with his. \u201cAm I crushing you?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNo. And don\u2019t move. I don\u2019t want to lose the feeling of being part of you.\u201d</p><p>He wanted to tell her she\u2019d be a part of him for the rest of his life, but that might frighten her more than his roar. \u201cI\u2019d just like to spoil you for a little while, if that\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds interesting. Just how will you spoil me, if I might ask?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ll start by not digging us out of here too fast,\u201d he said. \u201cHow does that sound?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike heaven. Pure heaven.\u201d</p><p>Ian and Marcie dressed somewhat reluctantly and headed outside to check out the snow and make a run to the outhouse. It was still coming down, softly, slowly, but not too deep on the ground yet.</p><p>She got her turn first, and she made it quick. Then Ian was allowed the facilities. When he came out, he found himself alone. She must have gone back to the warmth of the cabin in a hurry and he began to follow. Before he got five feet, a snowball hit him square in the face. He wiped it away to see her leaning out from behind a big tree, laughing. \u201cDid I mention I was good in softball?\u201d she asked through her laughter. \u201cI pitched!\u201d</p><p>The chase was on\u2014Ian took after her with a roar that was answered by giggles. He was stronger and more sure in the snow, but she was agile and quick and managed to get off a few snowballs while he was in pursuit. She ran around trees, rounded the shed at least once, took a few snowballs in the back and retaliated. But the chase ended when she tripped on something under the snow and did a face-plant right into the soft white powder.</p><p>He rushed to her side, scared, and rolled her over to find her laughing and spitting snow. He just looked down at her in wonder\u2014did nothing disturb her? Scare her? Panic or worry her? He covered her mouth with his for a long kiss, and when he let her go she said, \u201cBefore we go inside, we should make snow angels.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not making snow angels,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat if Buck sees me? It would ruin my reputation forever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust one, then. Yours would be so big\u2014like Gabriel, for sure.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen will you go inside with me? No more screwing around?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw\u2014I thought that was your favorite part?\u201d she asked, taking a handful of snow and shoving it in his face.</p><p>With a growl, he got to his feet, lifted her off the ground and threw her over his shoulder, carrying her back to the cabin. He stood her in front of the door and brushed the snow off her before letting her enter, then did the same himself.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve forgotten how to play,\u201d she accused him.</p><p>\u201cYou play around enough for both of us,\u201d he said. Without shedding his jacket, he got water heating on the propane stove and the woodstove. \u201cI\u2019ll give you a little time alone while I shovel a path to the john and hook the plow blade onto the truck. Think you can manage these big pots on your own?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going to dig us out so soon?\u201d she asked, clearly disappointed.</p><p>He smiled at her. \u201cNot exactly. I\u2019m going to make a couple of passes at the road\u2014but no one has to know about it. I just don\u2019t want to get us too buried. Do me a favor? When you\u2019re done with your bath\u2014start my water cooking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, Ian,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd if you\u2019re very nice\u2014I\u2019ll scrub your back.\u201d</p><p>Winters had always been a huge burden to Ian\u2014the shoveling and plowing a necessary evil to give him access to the road, the john. But not on this particular winter day\u2014this time it was a godsend. He\u2019d like to keep Marcie boarded up in his cabin for a couple of weeks, but in reality, a day and night would be all he could really afford.</p><p>After making sure there was a path to the outhouse, he fitted the plow onto the truck and loaded the bed with firewood to make the truck heavier. He covered the wood with a tarp and drove down his access road. A couple of feet of snow wasn\u2019t a big deal and if he cleared it today, tomorrow wouldn\u2019t be as bad.</p><p>There was an old guy a couple miles down who had neither a plow for his truck nor a working tractor. In fact, it didn\u2019t appear the tractor had been in use since Ian migrated to this mountaintop. The old boy\u2019s road to Highway 36 wasn\u2019t real long and tomorrow Ian would check on him to make sure he had a clear road and food. They weren\u2019t friends; they\u2019d hardly spoken. But Ian had been aware of him for a long time and just couldn\u2019t stand the thought of him freezing or starving to death, stranded. It was a small thing; he only had to make the short pilgrimage a couple of times a winter.</p><p>When he finally made his way back to the cabin, she said, \u201cWell finally! I\u2019ve been wondering if I should come out and lend a hand!\u201d</p><p>He pulled off his gloves. \u201cWe\u2019re clear to the road if we have to get out of here. But there\u2019s no reason we have to. Is my water hot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and if you\u2019re nice, I\u2019ll make you eggs before they spoil.\u201d</p><p>He took his jacket off and draped it over a kitchen chair. \u201cYou going to read your book while I take my clothes off and wash up?\u201d</p><p>She grinned an elfish grin. \u201cNot on your life.\u201d</p><p>It was only two nights and a day, but for Ian it was healing and for Marcie, pure magic. They ate well, made love, napped in front of the woodstove, talked. The end of the snowy day found them together on the couch, Ian leaning back against the arm, stretched out, holding Marcie between his long legs, enjoying her closeness and their conversation. Her head rested against his chest and he stroked her soft hair, catching it between his fingers.</p><p>\u201cI want to know more about Erin,\u201d he said. \u201cYou two seem nothing alike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d she confirmed. \u201cThere are three different Erin\u2019s. If you really want to know, get comfortable.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled at her. \u201cI\u2019m comfortable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, while we were growing up and she was so much older, she was just a bossy big sister. I think that\u2019s the natural order of things, but it\u2019s magnified when a mother is lost\u2014the oldest daughter sometimes assumes the role. A giant pain in the butt. But then we lost Dad and she tried so hard to take care of us. We were beyond being taken care of, you know. A thirteen-and fifteen-year-old\u2014we coped in our own ways, had our own lives. I had Bobby, and Drew had sports and buddies. I feel really terrible about that\u2014we weren\u2019t there for Erin at all. And she was just beginning law school, which demanded so much of her. But we were stupid kids\u2014we didn\u2019t know anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou told her that, of course,\u201d he said. \u201cOnce you realized it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d she said. \u201cI was next to mess up her tidy little life, but at least she was already a lawyer in a nice practice when I hit her with getting married. She tried to talk sense to me, but I had only one thing on my mind. There were fights and tears between us, but in the end Erin did what Dad would have done\u2014she gave me a wedding...\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe did?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cOr Dad did, depends on how you look at it. When Dad died, there was a house, insurance, stuff like that. Erin guarded it for things like educations. I wasn\u2019t interested in all that\u2014I wanted to marry Bobby. Since there was no stopping me, she did the only thing that would make me happy. And although I knew she was miserable about it, she beamed the whole time. She wasn\u2019t upset about it being Bobby\u2014she loved him and his whole family\u2014it was just our youth.</p><p>\u201cThen Bobby came home to us as an invalid. My big sister, who I\u2019d spent so many years resenting and resisting, was the best advocate I had. She worked her legal brain for months to get us the best benefits available from the military. You know how it is getting stuff out of the military\u2014you have to be a bulldog\u2014relentless. Some people just luck into things like larger base housing or CHAMPUS for off-base medical care\u2014but most people have to wait till stuff is available and then better be first in line when it is. That takes constant energy. She made phone calls, wrote letters, and I think she even got our congressman involved. And she was the one who found the perfect care center. And my glamorous sister? She got right in there, got her hands dirty, helped to wash him, change linens, brush his teeth, put salve on his eyes...She held him and whispered to him like the rest of us. She came through in every way.\u201d</p><p>Ian felt his throat tighten. He tried to imagine that uppity broad who came to take Marcie away getting down and dirty like that. He couldn\u2019t even get a picture in his mind of her taking a hike out to the \u201cloo,\u201d as they were fond of calling it.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the three Erins?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo\u2014that\u2019s the first two. The bitchy big sister, the dominant mother figure. Then there\u2019s the one you met\u2014she\u2019s a very successful attorney. Very well-put-together, makes a good living, makes her clients happy and the senior partners proud. Her main concern is still me and Drew, making sure we have whatever support we need. But she\u2019s thirty-four and alone. There have been a few very short-term boyfriends, but we\u2019ve all lived in the same house together since Dad died, except that little while I lived with just Bobby. Erin has no life but us. She\u2019s given us everything. She comes off looking domineering and maybe cold and calculating, but really she\u2019s sacrificed everything, even her personal life. She should be married or at least in love, but she spent every free second making sure we were taken care of\u2014me with Bobby, Drew with college and then medical school\u2014you have no idea how much energy and expense is involved in just getting into medical school. Drew couldn\u2019t have done it without Erin, just as I wouldn\u2019t have known what to do about Bobby without her. Really, I owe her so much. I fight her when she bosses me, but I owe her big-time.\u201d</p><p>He lowered his lips and kissed her head. \u201cIt sounds like you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why I promised to be home by Christmas,\u201d she said. She turned her head and looked up at him. \u201cI could stay here forever, but I promised. And it\u2019s not just for Erin\u2014Bobby\u2019s family thinks of me as a daughter, a sister, after all we did together...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. You held up pretty good in this place\u2014it\u2019s hard living here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not too hard for me. It\u2019s cold on the butt when nature calls. And now I carry that skillet with me everywhere I go. But I\u2019d take my frostbitten butt to see you feed that deer out of your hand any day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat deer-feeding trick would get old after a while.\u201d He twirled a red curl around his finger. \u201cWhen you decided to come up here, what did you think was going to happen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot this.\u201d She laughed. \u201cIn fact, I\u2019d have bet against it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBut what did you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeace of mind,\u201d she said. \u201cFor both of us.

Why did you stay here so long without getting in touch with anyone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you, I was camping and\u2014\u201d</p> <p>She shook her head. \u201cThere was more to it. I understand about how you stumbled on this place and ended up staying, but did something traumatic drive you away?\u201d</p><p>He frowned slightly. \u201cDo you think it had to be like that? Jack told me he came up here to get some space so he could think...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he went into business. He has a lot of people in his life who depend on him. It doesn\u2019t seem like the same kind of thing. Was it Shelly? Did that whole thing about the wedding\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarcie,\u201d he said, touching her cheek. \u201cIt was everything. Too much at once. It was Fallujah and Bobby. Then it was Shelly and my father...\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me about letting Shelly go,\u201d she said.</p> <p>He glanced away, then back. \u201cLet me ask you something\u2014did Shelly ever call you? Visit you and Bobby? Or were you the one to make contact with her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was looking for you...\u201d she said.</p><p>Enough of an answer. \u201cI had suggested to Shelly in letters, before the bomb in Fallujah, that she call you. You lived in the same town. Bobby was my friend,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cBut, Ian\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. But what happened to me and Bobby was one of the biggest reasons I had to take a time-out to recover. Shelly knew what had happened. She knew Bobby was an invalid and you were taking care of him. She knew you\u2019d been to Germany and D.C. and finally home\u2014yet she never even wrote you a letter, never called you. A girl from your town, her fianc\u00e9\u2019s best friend, my life in the balance getting him out...\u201d He made a face. \u201cMarcie, I didn\u2019t know she was that kind of person. I thought she was more the kind of person who would\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIan, once we were back in Chico, I didn\u2019t contact her again either,\u201d Marcie pointed out. \u201cNot until I was looking for you.\u201d</p> <p>His expression changed. \u201cAgain?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Caught. She looked down. \u201cBefore the bomb, I called her.\u201d She looked up. \u201cBecause you and Bobby were good friends, I thought we could get together. She was very busy. She took my number and said if she ever had any free time, she\u2019d get in touch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd she never had any free time,\u201d he said. \u201cShe never told me that, but somehow I knew.\u201d He inhaled and let it out slowly. \u201cYou were busy taking care of Bobby, and Shelly had a wedding to plan. The difference in that scared me. It turns out Shelly had tunnel vision\u2014she could only see one thing. I\u2019m not sure I was even a part of what she saw.\u201d He ran his finger along her cheek. \u201cYou aren\u2019t kidding\u2014I dodged a bullet there. I didn\u2019t fully realize it, but I knew something wasn\u2019t right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d she said. \u201cAh. On top of everything else. And with your father? What did your father do?\u201d</p><p>He looked away uncomfortably, but he knew he was going to be honest with her. \u201cNothing he hadn\u2019t done my whole life.\u201d He looked back. \u201cMy dad was always tough to please. He thought pushing me would make me a man, but I was never man enough. All I ever wanted from him was a word of praise, a proud smile.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about your mother?\u201d</p><p>He smiled tenderly. \u201cGod, she was incredible. She always loved him, no matter what. And I didn\u2019t have to do anything to make her think I was a hero. If I fell flat on my face she\u2019d just beam and say, \u2018Did you see that great routine of Ian\u2019s? What a genius!\u2019 When I was in that musical, she thought I was the best thing to hit Chico, but my dad asked me if I was gay.\u201d He chuckled. \u201cMy mom was the best-natured, kindest, most generous woman who ever lived. Always positive. And faithful?\u201d He laughed, shaking his head. \u201cMy dad could be in one of his negative moods where nothing was right\u2014the dinner sucked, the ball game wasn\u2019t coming in clear on the TV, the battery on the car was giving out, he hated work, the neighbors were too loud...And my mom, instead of saying, \u2018Why don\u2019t you grow the fuck up, you old turd,\u2019 she would just say, \u2018John, I bet I have something that will turn your mood around\u2014I made a German chocolate cake.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Marcie smiled. \u201cShe sounds wonderful.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe was. Wonderful. Even while she was fighting cancer, she was so strong, so awesome that I kept thinking it was going to be all right, that she\u2019d make it. As for my dad, he was always impossible to please, impossible to impress. I really thought I\u2019d grown through it, you know? I got to the point real early where I finally understood that that\u2019s just the kind of guy he was. He never beat me, he hardly even yelled at me. He didn\u2019t get drunk, break up the furniture, miss work or\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what did he do, Ian?\u201d she asked gently.</p><p>He blinked a couple of times. \u201cDid you know I got medals for getting Bobby out of Fallujah?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cHe got medals, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy old man was there when I was decorated. He stood nice and tall, polite, and told everyone he knew about the medals. But he never said jack to me. Then when I told him I was getting out of the Marine Corps, he told me I was a fuckup. That I didn\u2019t know a good thing when I had it. And he said...\u201d He paused for a second. \u201cHe said he\u2019d never been so ashamed of me in his whole goddamn life and if I did that\u2014got out\u2014I wasn\u2019t his son.\u201d</p><p>Instead of crumbling into tears on his behalf, she leaned against him, stroked his cheek a little and smiled. \u201cSo\u2014he was the same guy his whole stupid life.\u201d</p><p>Ian felt a slight, melancholy smile tug at his lips. \u201cThe same guy. One miserable son of a bitch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s really no excuse for a guy like that,\u201d she said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t cost you anything to be nice.\u201d</p><p>He lifted his eyebrows. \u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally. He ought to be ashamed. Everyone has the option to be civil. Decent. I knew when I met him he was mean and ornery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNext you\u2019re going to say I won\u2019t be free of that till I forgive him,\u201d Ian said. \u201cThey always say, not for the person who has been horrible, but for yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot bloody likely, coming from me,\u201d she said. \u201cNow if he asked for forgiveness...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHah. Not in your wildest dreams,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t expect so. I met him, remember. None of what you told me surprises me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarcie, I don\u2019t hate him, I swear to God. But I can\u2019t see why I\u2019d want to say, \u2018I\u2019m perfectly okay with you being the coldest SOB I\u2019ve ever known.\u2019 And I\u2019m sure not looking to be around that again. What\u2019s the point?\u201d</p><p>She leaned forward and laid her head against his shoulder. \u201cHmm. Why would you? It\u2019s not likely he\u2019d change. Ian, there\u2019s nothing you can do to change him. Now I understand. Now it will be all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it you think you understand?\u201d</p><p>She held him close. \u201cYou were battle scarred. You\u2019d lost your best friend, even though he was still alive\u2014technically\u2014a complication that probably made things even worse for you. Your relationship floundered. That happens so often after a soldier gets out of a war zone\u2014been happening since World War I and earlier, I\u2019m sure. Too bad that happened, but I don\u2019t think you could have helped it.... You had to have a little time...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know I could\u2019ve used some help, but if anyone had offered to help me, I\u2019d have broken his jaw,\u201d Ian said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure. You probably had a lot of rage stored up at that time. Well-deserved rage. The least a person can do is try to empathize. Be patient. Your loved ones\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt turned out I didn\u2019t have loved ones,\u201d he said in a quiet voice.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d she said, lifting her head and looking into those lovely brown eyes. \u201cYou do now. And thank you\u2014I wanted to understand what happened. That\u2019s all I wanted, and you didn\u2019t have to tell me, but you did.\u201d</p><p>He pushed some of that wild red hair over her ear. \u201cYou had some fantasy about what would happen when you found me, admit it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d She grinned. \u201cI tried to keep it to myself, and it didn\u2019t include fabulous sex. I fantasized that I\u2019d find you, tell you some things that would ease your mind and then I\u2019d take you home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHome?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo Chico, or wherever home is to you,\u201d Marcie said. \u201cA lot of your old squad checked in on Bobby, asked if I knew where you were. You\u2019re not as alone as you think. But you\u2019d have to go to some trouble to find them now. You went missing too long. When people think you don\u2019t want them, they let you be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot all of them.\u201d He laughed.</p><p>\u201cWell, I told you\u2014I can match you for stubborn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, tell me about this forgiveness thing you don\u2019t get,\u201d he prodded.</p><p>\u201cOh, Ian\u2014I\u2019m in the same spot as you. If someone did something horrible to me and never apologized or asked for forgiveness, I wouldn\u2019t break my neck trying to forgive them. Those insurgents in Fallujah? I\u2019m not working on loving them like brothers. If that\u2019s what I have to do to be an okay person, I\u2019m going to remain the baddest little carrottop on the playground.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about God?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod understands everything. And even He made a mistake or two. Look at the size of avocado seeds\u2014way too big. And pomegranates? Too many seeds. What a waste of fruit!\u201d</p><p>He laughed loudly. \u201cSo what do you do to come to a peaceful place about those horrible people?\u201d</p><p>She lifted her head and looked into his eyes without mirth. Her green eyes were warm and soft. Her smile was gentle. \u201cWe accept them as they are. And if we can\u2019t love them like brothers, maybe we can understand and let them be their own problems. Holy Christ, isn\u2019t that enough of a challenge? Accept him as he is, Ian\u2014a miserable old son of a bitch who was hardly happy a day in his life, and it really had nothing to do with you.\u201d</p><p>Though he fought it, he felt his eyes glisten with tears. Long seconds passed in which she met that clouded gaze fearlessly\u2014not afraid of his roar, his rage or his tears. \u201cHow does someone so young and bad and wild get wisdom?\u201d he asked in a whisper.</p><p>\u201cWisdom? What I get is struggle. I haven\u2019t had it as bad as you, as hard as most people. I just do my best, that\u2019s all. But I want to tell you something. I didn\u2019t love you with just my body, Ian. My heart got in there. I hope you know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that.\u201d He touched her lips briefly. Then he asked, \u201cSo, what\u2019s wrong with him? My father? You said he was sick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot critical\u2014but his maladies will get him sooner than later. He\u2019s being treated with chemo for prostate cancer, he has Parkinson\u2019s, had a mild stroke and I believe some dementia is settling in. But, be warned\u2014he could have years.\u201d Then she grinned.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2014are\u2014amazing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could come home with me, Ian. For Christmas.\u201d</p><p>He was quiet for a moment. \u201cNo. I couldn\u2019t do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not? Will the good people from the towns around here be without firewood? Would the cabin get snowed in?\u201d</p><p>He smiled at her. \u201cBaby, I\u2019m not going to kid you\u2014you changed my life, and all in ten days, but not enough to clean me up and take me back to Chico. Listen to me,\u201d he said gently. \u201cThis is nice, you and me. But I think it\u2019s a tryst that might never be anything more. This thing that happened between us\u2014it wasn\u2019t supposed to.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBut you\u2019re not sorry,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYou know I\u2019m not sorry. I\u2019m grateful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think if I stayed a little longer...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat? You\u2019d get through to me? Transform me into some other kind of guy? Pluck me out of my run-down cabin and make a civilized man out of me?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNothing like that ever occurred to me. You\u2019re more civilized than most of the men I know. But lately I\u2019ve been thinking if I stayed longer you\u2019d laugh more. You\u2019d sing to people instead of just to wildlife. You\u2019d probably ask that librarian out for drinks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he laughed. \u201cAfter I found a way to convince her I\u2019m not an idiot savant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I came back here to see you, would you lock me out and make me sleep in my car?\u201d</p><p>He laughed and shook his head. \u201cNo.\u201d But he thought, she might come back once, maybe even twice. Then it would stop, because he and this place wouldn\u2019t change much. And he didn\u2019t deserve her; she should have so much more than some beat-up old marine with issues who\u2019d stuck himself in the woods.</p> <p>\u201cSince you won\u2019t come back with me, I\u2019m staying till Christmas Eve. I won\u2019t leave at the crack of dawn, but I\u2019ll get home in time for dinner. It\u2019s just a few hours away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cErin isn\u2019t going to like that,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s ready for you right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll have to wait. I\u2019m doing the best I can. I don\u2019t want to leave you. Ever.\u201d</p><p>Instead of talking about it anymore, he asked her, \u201cIs it too soon to make love again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, smiling.</p><p>He pulled her against him. It was better this way, he thought, that he not add the words I love you to the mix. This was hard enough on her. Instead, he kissed her as well as he could, his hands running over her body in a way that promised more loving.</p> <p>In the morning when she woke, he had gone. He left a note. \u201cSweetheart. Selling wood, plowing some roads. I won\u2019t be too long. Ian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweetheart,\u201d she whispered to herself. She folded it in half and quarters and found a safe place in her wallet to preserve it. Forever.</p><p>Fourteen</p><p>I an unloaded his entire supply of firewood in short order and took delivery orders for three more half cords, which would take him another day to load, deliver and unload, giving people their cozy fires for Christmas. And his supply of cut and cure wood was running low, which was the plan. He\u2019d cut and split and cured all spring, summer and fall and then, with luck, sell off his wood in a matter of weeks.</p><p>He was in Virgin River before noon. He parked by the bar, but he didn\u2019t go in. Instead he walked up to that huge tree, taking a closer look at some of the unit badges. He looked around; he was alone. Then he pulled a few things out of his pocket. He\u2019d fixed them up with short wires so they\u2019d hook onto the branches. His unit badge\u2014the same as Bobby\u2019s. A Purple Heart and a Bronze Star\u2014medals awarded for the highest bravery and valor. He fixed them onto the tree. It took him just a few moments.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see those get back to you,\u201d a voice said.</p><p>He whirled around and found himself facing Mel Sheridan. Her coat was pulled tight against the cold and occasional snow flurries, her hands plunged in her pockets. \u201cI won\u2019t be here at Christmas\u2014we\u2019re going to Jack\u2019s family. But I can tell Paige\u2014Preacher\u2019s wife\u2014to make sure when she rescues some of the badges that she holds on to your medals. It wouldn\u2019t do to lose them. They\u2019re important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not worried about what happens to them. I don\u2019t have much use for them now.\u201d</p> <p>She laughed a little. \u201cI\u2019ve heard that before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy husband, for one. You guys, you\u2019re peculiar in that way. You train to do the things that bring awards, then won\u2019t display them. Jack\u2014he was going to get rid of his until his father confiscated them to keep them safe. Jack said it wasn\u2019t the medals, it was the men. So\u2014if you can remember the men with the medals, good enough. I\u2019ll see you get them back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d he said weakly. \u201cI think they\u2019re better off here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor now,\u201d Mel said. \u201cI guess Marcie will have to head home, but in case you\u2019re around Christmas Eve...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard,\u201d he said. \u201cA town thing. I don\u2019t know...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, the town\u2019s kind of easy\u2014no RSVP required. If you get the itch.\u201d She shrugged and smiled.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s nice,\u201d he said. \u201cI have to go. There\u2019s an old guy, neighbor of mine, who doesn\u2019t have a plow...\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood of you to look out for him, Ian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t really, I just\u2014\u201d</p><p>He stopped abruptly at the sight of Jack, Preacher and Mike coming out of the bar in a big hurry, jacketed up, carrying rifles and duffel bags.</p><p>\u201cJack?\u201d Mel asked.</p><p>He continued toward his extended cab truck. \u201cTravis Goesel wandered off yesterday. Didn\u2019t make it home. Family\u2019s been looking all over their farm and grazing land.\u201d He threw a duffel in his truck bed. \u201cDavid\u2019s with Brie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWandered off?\u201d Mel asked. \u201cTravis wandered off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was tracking a cat. Mountain lion killed his dog, so he grabbed his rifle and he went after it. Kid\u2019s a good tracker and excellent shot. And too smart to be out all night in this snow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s the Goesel farm?\u201d Ian asked before he could stop himself.</p><p>\u201cYou know the Pauper\u2019s Pond area?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSort of. The river that runs past my place feeds a couple creeks and a pond out there. I\u2019m east of their property a few miles. That cat\u2019s been around my place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you think it\u2019s the same cat?\u201d Jack asked.</p><p>\u201cAggressive one\u2014he didn\u2019t run off like they usually do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat a fact? You must know that area. Any chance you could lend a hand?\u201d</p><p>Ian wanted nothing so much as to get back to the girl. Especially if that cat was out there with blood lust.</p><p>\u201cThe kid\u2019s sixteen,\u201d Jack went on. \u201cHe\u2019s big and strong. But I agree with his father\u2014this isn\u2019t good. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s worse, the mountain lion getting him or the cold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Ian said. \u201cIf the boy\u2019s smart, he\u2019s not walking uphill toward my place. I can start at the base of the mountain and work west. You can start in the west and work east. Will that help? A kid that age could walk miles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis father, brothers and some neighbors are all over that farm\u2014we can work the outside acreage.\u201d Jack pulled his duffel out of the truck bed. \u201cPreach and Mike can go together on the west side of Goesel\u2019s farm, I\u2019ll go with you on the east.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have hardly any heat in that truck,\u201d Ian said.</p><p>\u201cYeah, but you got a plow. I love the plow. That could come in real handy. I\u2019m gonna get one of those to mount on my truck. I have myself a long road into our new house.\u201d</p><p>Ian looked at Mel. \u201cI left Marcie early this morning when I went to deliver firewood. She won\u2019t know why I\u2019m not back. If she tried to get to town in that car of hers...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen David lies down for his nap, I\u2019ll run out there and tell her what\u2019s going on. Would that help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell her she\u2019s going to want to stay in. She doesn\u2019t like that. She doesn\u2019t like making do and not traveling to the outdoor facilities. You\u2019d better tell her about that mountain lion, that he\u2019s around and he\u2019s not getting any more shy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do that. You just be real careful out there. Jack!\u201d she yelled. \u201cYou be careful!\u201d</p><p>Jack grinned at Mel. \u201cI\u2019ll be back real soon, Melinda. Travis has presents under the tree\u2014we have to get him home. You just keep that little bun in the oven warm. Come on, Buchanan. Let\u2019s do it.\u201d</p><p>The men left town in two trucks\u2014Ian took Jack and Preacher took Mike. They headed out the same highway, and then at a fork that led to the farm, Mike and Preacher took their truck off to the left while Ian and Jack kept going past the farm. \u201cHow much land you have sitting under that cabin?\u201d Jack asked Ian.</p><p>\u201cSix hundred and sixty acres,\u201d Ian said. Jack whistled. \u201cIt\u2019s all mountain and trees in a restricted-logging area. So it\u2019s a lot of nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing but quiet and pretty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a stream,\u201d Ian said. \u201cGood fishing. Good hunting. And I harvest the trees for firewood, a little here and there. I think the old man, Raleigh, homesteaded.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you know him?\u201d Jack asked.</p><p>Ian laughed. \u201cI was wandering around the mountains, camping, hunting rabbit, on a fool\u2019s mission, when winter hit the mountains real sudden. Raleigh was older than God already and couldn\u2019t hardly chop his own wood, so he gave me a roof for some help on the land.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood deal for you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, the joke was on me. He got real sick and what he needed was a nurse in addition to everything else.\u201d</p><p>Jack grinned at him. \u201cYou must\u2019 a stuck it out if you\u2019re in the cabin.\u201d</p><p>Ian shrugged. \u201cI never saw that coming\u2014he wrote some kind of will that old Doc had to witness. If he hadn\u2019t done that, I might\u2019ve figured out what to do with myself by now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing wrong with having more than one choice, man. We should probably park along the road up here pretty soon and go back on foot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a road that\u2019ll take us almost straight back around the hill another couple of miles\u2014it\u2019ll get us farther in there. Tell me about this boy? Why would he do this?\u201d</p><p>Jack turned and looked at him. \u201cEver have a dog?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Ian said. \u201cVelvet\u2014a black Lab.\u201d Velvet had been his best friend when he was a kid. The old girl made it till she was fourteen, till her back was so slumped and her hips so painful, it hurt him to look at her. But he couldn\u2019t let go; seemed like he had a long history of that. He was seventeen to her fourteen when he heard his father\u2019s early morning curse while he was getting ready for school and he knew\u2014Velvet had had an accident in the night. She was tired and weary; she couldn\u2019t always remember to do the right thing. \u201cThat dog has to be put down,\u201d Ian heard his father say.</p><p>Afraid he might come home from school one day to find her gone, he cut school and went alone to the vet and held her while she drifted off, painless. He couldn\u2019t stand the thought she might go alone; he wouldn\u2019t put it past his father to take her, drop her off, leave her to die by herself. God, her face was more peaceful and rested in death than it had been for the last year of her life. Seeing that, it should have made him feel glad for her, relieved\u2014she wasn\u2019t going to last much longer anyway.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t let Velvet go alone. He had needed the time to say goodbye, and he didn\u2019t want to come home and find her gone. He needed to be with her\u2014like Marcie had needed to be with Bobby. He swallowed hard.</p><p>But his memory drifted back to Velvet, remembering the whole loss, how it tore him up. He\u2019d gone off to private places where he could cry like a girl, unable to let his parents or friends see he had that amount of emotion.</p><p>\u201cThat mountain lion\u2019s been bothering their property\u2014stalking,\u201d Jack said. \u201cThe dogs have been running it off, keeping it away from the goats and hens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow old was the kid\u2019s dog?\u201d Ian asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, exactly. Six or eight\u2014a border collie, a herder named Whip. They had a half-dozen farm dogs, mostly herders, outdoor animals, but Travis raised that one himself. He picked her out of a litter and for a while she was a 4-H project. Goesel said he couldn\u2019t keep the damn dog out of the kid\u2019s bed. You know farmers and their dogs\u2014they don\u2019t get overly sentimental as a rule. I don\u2019t know how the cat managed to get to the dog\u2014they usually aren\u2019t looking for that kind of a fight.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ian ground his teeth. \u201cThink I\u2019d go after the son of a bitch, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Jack said. \u201cYeah, I had a dog growing up, too. Big dog\u2014Spike, no kidding. He was almost a perfect animal. But he let my sisters dress him up. That used to make me sick, I\u2019m telling you. The way he let himself be humiliated like that.\u201d</p><p>Ian shot him a look and a big grin. He was picturing a German shepherd in a tutu and a disgruntled teenage boy. A laugh shot out of him.</p> <p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t funny,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>\u201cI bet it was,\u201d Ian said. Then he pulled off the road at a sharp left. \u201cGimme a minute here.\u201d He jumped out of the truck, got some tools out of the box in the bed and went around to the front. He loosened up the brackets on the plow hitch, pulled the plow with all his might to angle it, then lowered it and tightened the brackets. It wasn\u2019t the kind of plow fitting that had hydraulics inside the vehicle to move the blade, it was all manual, old and old-fashioned\u2014but it got the job done. He threw his tools back in the box and got behind the wheel.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see a road. You see a road?\u201d Jack asked.</p><p>Ian laughed. \u201cI know where the road is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI can feel it. Relax.\u201d</p><p>Jack braced a foot against the floorboard, a hand against the dash and said, \u201cI\u2019ll relax when we\u2019re not in a ditch. Go slow.\u201d</p><p>Ian laughed at him. \u201cSo,\u201d Ian said, maneuvering slowly, \u201cif the kid\u2019s smart, we\u2019ll be looking for some kind of recent tracks, shelter, or...\u201d</p><p>\u201cA body,\u201d Jack supplied.</p><p>\u201cIf he was lost, he might\u2019ve followed the river or the road. About the time night was falling, he might\u2019ve seen any one of several old logging roads,\u201d Ian said. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to see the road with the snow, but you\u2019ll know it\u2019s there by the tree line. Like I\u2019m doing now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not convinced there isn\u2019t a big hole right in your path, hidden by snow. You could go slower,\u201d Jack said, tense.</p> <p>\u201cYou could relax. I\u2019ve been all over this place.\u201d Then after a bit, he stopped the truck. \u201cWant to head out from here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s do it.\u201d</p><p>They exited the truck at the same time. Ian took a rifle out of the rack in his truck and a flashlight out of the glove compartment. Jack was digging around in his duffel.</p><p>\u201cI only have one flare gun, but I have an extra stocking mask and a scarf\u2014put this around your neck. We\u2019ll start down this road together, but when we separate, if you find anything, just fire a couple rounds. With me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGotcha.\u201d Ian buttoned up his jacket and thought, I didn\u2019t have any reason for the long underwear this morning, damn it. He wrapped the long plaid scarf around his head and neck, partly covering his face. He missed the heavy beard right now. \u201cSee, I think the dog wasn\u2019t as scrappy as the other dogs because she was a little spoiled by Travis,\u201d Ian said, speaking as though he knew Travis and the dog. \u201cThat could\u2019ve been working on him at the same time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Jack said. \u201cHow\u2019s your flashlight? You need batteries?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo tell the truth, I\u2019m not sure.\u201d</p><p>Jack pulled some extra batteries out of his duffel as well as a hand gun he tucked in his waist. He tossed Ian the batteries, then two bottled waters that Ian put in each pocket. They walked down the road, looking right and left, and hadn\u2019t gone far when Jack said, \u201cOkay, I\u2019m going this way into that stand of trees.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll head this way,\u201d Ian said, and they separated.</p><p>Ian walked toward the river, eyes trained on the ground, on the landscape, and occasionally up into the branches just in case that big cat was having a little game of hide and seek. And he thought some about the kid remembering himself at sixteen; he\u2019d been a hothead, devoted to a few things in his life, and his dog was one of them.</p><p>He\u2019d also been pretty angry with his father in general. His dad was a passive-aggressively cruel person\u2014he wouldn\u2019t leave a tip, drove real slow in the passing lane, withheld affection. Every birthday card or holiday gift was signed \u201cMom &amp; Dad\u201d by Ian\u2019s mother. Every word that came out of the old man\u2019s pie hole was a criticism.</p><p>After Velvet, Ian had stopped pretending it didn\u2019t matter; he was bigger and stronger than his father and got right up in his face, giving it back to him, something he soon realized was tearing his mother up. His mother begged him to lighten up, let it go, ignore being snubbed or criticized virtually every minute. \u201cHow do you stand it?\u201d he had railed at his mother. \u201cHe should kiss your feet, and he acts like you\u2019re his slave!\u201d</p><p>And his sweet mother had said, \u201cIan, he\u2019s faithful and he works hard to support us. He might not be romantic or doting, but he gave me you. If that\u2019s all I ever get from him, it\u2019ll always be the world to me.\u201d</p><p>Not enough, Ian remembered thinking. Not enough. Joining the Marines seemed like a smart and safe way to go\u2014got him the hell out of there and to a place where he could be in touch with his mother and not have to put up with his father.</p><p>Then came his mother\u2019s death, then more active duty leading up to Iraq. His father was the only family Ian had left and he was woefully inadequate. After Iraq, after a few scrapes that even he knew had all to do with some PTSD, he feared he was turning into the old man. There were random fights with guys he had no real quarrel with. Things set him off and he just lost it. Even if the Corps could look the other way for a while, Ian couldn\u2019t. He\u2019d been a strong leader who\u2019d turned into an asshole who just couldn\u2019t cope. That\u2019s when he got out, hoping he could get back to the man who was admired. Followed.</p><p>And Ian\u2019s father said, \u201cYou are no son to me if you quit. If you run away.\u201d</p><p>Ian said, \u201cI never was a son to you.\u201d</p><p>Talk about a standoff.</p><p>He scanned the ground, looking for any sign of the boy\u2014broken shrubs or tree limbs showing that someone had passed, marks on the ground including drops of blood, recent footprints in the snow.</p><p>He also thought about Marcie. When she\u2019d infiltrated his life, his first thought hadn\u2019t been that she was beautiful and sexy. In fact, his twentieth thought wasn\u2019t even that\u2014she was sick, pale, listless...frankly, homely as a duck. Vulnerable and anything but pretty. Still, it wasn\u2019t the pretty that got to him when she started to get a little color on her face\u2014it was the pure contrariness. The fight in her\u2014he\u2019d always appreciated anyone with that kind of gumption.</p><p>She was just about well in less than a week and her eyes had started to regain that little spark that said she\u2019d have her way, speak her mind and damn the consequences. How more like him could she be? He was able to appreciate her and give her credit\u2014though not out loud\u2014without getting captured by her.</p><p>Then slowly, he began to like her. No matter she fully intended to get in his business and mess up his life, she had a kind of drive that he couldn\u2019t help but admire. She wasn\u2019t doing any of it just for herself, but for herself and everyone from her dead husband to his family to Ian...to his cranky, isolated father whom Ian had been absolutely determined not to be like...but was.</p><p>It was when she defied her classy big sister and came back to his dusty little cabin that he fell. Aw, damn, what determination she had to be with him, to see it through, whatever it was she felt she had to do. Even she didn\u2019t seem entirely sure what she was doing there\u2014but she wasn\u2019t ready to give up on him. And she had this insane idea that everything could be all right! Somehow, she was going to pull him back into the man he\u2019d been to her dead husband; the brave leader, the fearless and committed man. Not someone who just dropped out of sight and isolated himself out of a kind of self-hatred. Into the man his father had never had the sense to be proud of.</p><p>Oh, God, I can\u2019t have turned into my father so soon!</p><p>He forced his mind back to Travis Goesel, scanning the ground, the shrubs, the lower branches of the trees. He looked at the old watch that still worked. He\u2019d been trekking without a sound from Jack for two hours and it was approaching four o\u2019clock. They only had two more hours of daylight at the most, so he called, \u201cTravis! Travis! Make a sound! Move something!\u201d</p><p>He walked a little faster, scanned the terrain with concentration, and it came to him that it was good to belong to something. Even though Jack was out of sight and the other men where on the west side of the farm, he felt as if he was a part of a unit of men who had a purpose again and, until Jack piled in the truck with him, he hadn\u2019t felt that in a long time. He\u2019d been so anxious to sever himself from the pain of war, he\u2019d forgotten how much the pleasure of brotherhood filled his soul. This, he had to admit, had all occurred because this feisty little redhead had come into his life. She forced the issue. She pushed him out of his cocoon while he was still raw, growing new skin.</p><p>If she\u2019d left her disabled husband in the hands of his family three years ago to come after him, would she have succeeded in pulling him up out of his self-indulgent withdrawal any sooner? Probably not. He\u2019d licked his wounds for such a long time that he got used to the taste of his self-pity.</p><p>Ian grew wearily cold, craving long underwear. He\u2019d been out in the woods for hours. He ate snow rather than drink the bottled water, in case he found the boy and needed it for him.</p><p>Then he saw a smear of blood and some tracks, partially covered by a new blanket of snow. By the width and weight of the trail, it was the cat, wounded. He followed the trail just a short distance, realizing the cat was dragging itself heavily. A moment later Ian realized that Travis would have intelligently gone in the opposite direction to this bloodied trail. So Ian did also.</p><p>Ian made it to the river and was looking left and right along the edge as night fell. He\u2019d have to head back to the truck soon, at least to confer with Jack and discuss the plan for searching at night. Part of such a plan would have to include long underwear and dry socks. But he just couldn\u2019t make himself stop.</p><p>Darkness fell in earnest. He shone the flashlight on his watch and saw it was nearly six o\u2019clock and he yelled for the millionth time. \u201cTravis! Travis!\u201d</p><p>Then as the light from his flashlight fell upon the snow, he noticed a drop of blood here, a drop there. Travis was hurt and doing just what Ian expected a smart kid to do\u2014he was following the river home. Using the flashlight to scan the ground as darkness thickened around him Ian saw something. Not far away from the river\u2019s edge was a pile of dead pine needles and brush, covered with a little new snow. A mound. It didn\u2019t look like much, but he gave it a slight kick with his boot and when some of the debris fell away, he saw a sleeve. He was instantly down on his knees, digging. In mere moments he uncovered a boy, his face white, his lips blue, his eyes closed. Ian shook him vigorously, not knowing if the boy was dead or alive.</p><p>\u201cTravis! Travis!\u201d</p><p>The boy\u2019s eyes finally came open, and he blinked not knowing where he was. He smacked his dry lips. He looked up at Ian with a dazed expression. \u201cSorry...Dad...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, Jesus, Travis!\u201d Ian said, relieved beyond words that the boy was alive. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be okay, buddy.\u201d Then he rolled him carefully onto his side and saw that the back of his jacket was shredded and he was bleeding. The damn cat had got him from behind but, thanks to Travis\u2019s clothing, the mauling had not gone deep and, with the help of the snow, his bleeding had been stanched.</p><p>\u201cYou get him, son?\u201d Ian asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so. I\u2019m sorry, Dad.\u201d</p><p>He was delirious, probably more from cold than his injury. Thank God he\u2019d buried himself under dead leaves and pine needles to preserve his body heat. \u201cI\u2019ll get you outta here, son, hang on,\u201d Ian said, now running on automatic. He stood and fired twice into a thick tree\u2014three shots were the signal that you were lost, two was a standard response from a search team, and one shot could be mistaken for a hunter. You never sent a bullet into the air with the possible outcome of it returning to earth to find a living person or innocent livestock. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Then he put the rifle strap over his shoulder and scooped up Travis in his arms. Immediately he remembered doing the same for Bobby. But this time it was different\u2014there was muscle tension in Travis\u2019s body. He was responding to the pain, maybe from the cold, maybe from having a mountain lion\u2019s claws in his back.</p><p>\u201cWake up, Travis! Wake up! Did the cat get you, huh? Tell me,\u201d he panted, walking as fast as he could. He hoped he wouldn\u2019t fall. His torso was okay\u2014he had on a T-shirt, sweatshirt and jacket, but his legs, knees and feet were now soaked with ice and snow. \u201cYou with me, buddy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho...you...?\u201d</p> <p>Ian laughed in spite of himself, just hearing the kid\u2019s response. \u201cYour guardian angel, my boy! You shoot at the cat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...think...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe left a bloody trail\u2014you get a shot off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...I couldn\u2019t a hit \u2019im,\u201d Travis answered, his tongue thick.</p><p>\u201cYeah, bet you got lucky. He\u2019s bleeding way worse than you. Good for you,\u201d Ian said. \u201cTalk. Keep talking. Tell me.\u201d</p> <p>His speech was slurred and labored, but Travis did as ordered. \u201cGot me...from...the tree...I saw him...I had him...bastard got Whip...\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeep talking,\u201d Ian said breathlessly, now laboring heavily under the weight of Travis combined with the difficulty of moving through the snow. \u201cAlmost there,\u201d he said, but in fact, he wasn\u2019t sure how far it was. He kept tromping. And tromping. But he knew the woods, knew the river\u2019s edge that ran by his property. \u201cTalk to me! Tell me about your girl!\u201d</p><p>And the boy tried. He named her\u2014Felicity. Must be the next generation\u2019s girls\u2019 names, Ian thought, almost laughing if he\u2019d had the breath. \u201cKeep talking!\u201d he demanded. \u201cThis Felicity, you in love with her or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a good girl...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat bites,\u201d Ian said. \u201cSucks she couldn\u2019t be a bad girl. You don\u2019t know, bud\u2014those bad girls, they get right under your skin. She pretty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cAtta boy, keep talking,\u201d Ian said, laying the boy carefully on the ground. \u201cI\u2019m going to fire a couple shots to let them know we\u2019re coming.\u201d And Ian quickly put another two in a fat tree, just to be sure there was some backup on the way. The kid was in rough shape so, if he had to, he\u2019d take him out of here and come back in the dark of night for Jack, but it would be better if\u2014</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d Jack shouted. \u201cWhat you got?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour boy,\u201d Ian said in a weak breath. Then he saw the truck about a hundred yards down the road.</p><p>\u201cLemme help,\u201d Jack shouted.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got him. You drive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know this road,\u201d Jack said. \u201cI can\u2019t feel it.\u201d</p><p>Ian let a laugh erupt. \u201cI fucking plowed it for you! Let\u2019s get going!\u201d</p><p>When they got to the truck, Ian balanced Travis on his thighs and pulled the keys out of his pocket, pitching them to Jack. Then he climbed into the cab with a boy the size of a man on his lap. Travis\u2019s head was lolling back and forth and he was struggling to keep his eyes open. Before Jack had the key in the ignition, Ian had ripped open Travis\u2019s jacket and shirt, tearing his undershirt open, then he did the same with his own three layers. He pressed Travis\u2019s bare chest to his own and hugged his body close, warming him with his own body heat.</p> <p>Jack carefully turned the truck around and headed out. \u201cThe plow is down. Should I stop and put it up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah. The county should thank us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould hurt the plow blade.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho cares?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere we headed?\u201d Jack asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. We need medical help. You tell me. We can call his parents from wherever...\u201d</p><p>\u201cVirgin River, I guess,\u201d Jack said. \u201cIt\u2019s just as quick to drive him straight to town where Mel and Doc can look at him as to call them from the farm. Besides, they have the Humvee ambulance. What\u2019s his condition?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe tried to bury himself to keep from freezing to death, and he did a good job of it. But another couple of hours and we\u2019d be outta luck,\u201d Ian said. He absorbed the boy\u2019s cold into his body. \u201cHe also got mauled by the cat, but the temperatures were low and the bleeding doesn\u2019t look serious\u2014but then what do I know? Plow faster, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got it, sir,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>Ian settled back in the seat and pressed Travis\u2019s face against his bare shoulder, feeling his carotid pulse picking up as he held him chest to chest. Momentarily, he felt him stir on his lap. Within fifteen minutes the boy\u2019s eyes had drifted open. Surprise dawned on his face. \u201cWho are you?\u201d he asked weakly.</p><p>\u201cThe Christmas fairy,\u201d Ian said. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be okay, kid.\u201d Ian pulled the bottle of water out of his jacket pocket and held it to Travis\u2019s lips. \u201cTake a little drink. Slow and easy.\u201d Finished, Ian\u2019s arms came around him tight, holding him against him. \u201cI\u2019m gonna get the heater fixed in this truck, if it\u2019s the last I do. I think you got that cat, boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shot at him, but he still lunged at me and I butted him in the head hard as I could. He just ran...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was bleeding good. You must\u2019ve hit him plenty hard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t get him,\u201d he said slowly. \u201cScared him away long enough to bury myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had a dog,\u201d Ian said. \u201cMy best friend for years. She used to sleep on my bed. She was a good dog...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhip was a good dog,\u201d he said.</p><p>Ian ruffled the kid\u2019s hair. \u201cI loved my dog. I\u2019d have done the same as you. That cat\u2019s a bad cat. I\u2019ve seen it around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve seen it?\u201d</p><p>Ian nodded. \u201cI should\u2019ve killed it. This is my fault\u2014I should\u2019ve shot the cat. He had my girl trapped in the outhouse for hours, in the cold, but I shot over its head to run him off. I\u2019m sorry, kid. I should\u2019ve killed the cat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should\u2019ve, too,\u201d the kid said, sleepily, laying his head against Ian\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>\u201cDrink another couple swallows,\u201d Ian said, holding up the water for him.</p><p>A few minutes later Jack drove into Virgin River pounding the horn in long, urgent blasts that brought people out of the bar, including Mel and Doc Mullins. Jack pulled right up to the Hummer while Ian, bare-chested, carried Travis out of the truck and, as they were accustomed to doing, Mel and Doc sprang into action. They lifted the hatch on the Hummer, pulled out the gurney and Ian placed the boy there.</p><p>After a quick check of his vitals, Ian told them about the lacerations on his back from the mountain lion he\u2019d been tracking. Mel rolled him onto his side while Doc lifted the jacket and glanced at the injury. \u201cNot so bad. Hypothermia. Melinda, you get in back\u2014start an IV and get him warmed up while I drive. Valley Hospital can deal with this, no problem. The boy\u2019s going to pull through fine.\u201d To Jack he said, \u201cCall the farm\u2014tell his parents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill do,\u201d Jack said. \u201cThen I\u2019ll go out and fire a flare for Preacher, Mike, and the rest of the search party. You saying we\u2019re home free?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood as it gets,\u201d Doc said. \u201cCome on, Melinda! You slowing down on me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, shove it, you old goat,\u201d she snapped, climbing in. \u201cJack\u2014mind the baby.\u201d</p><p>He grinned largely. \u201cYou bet, my love.\u201d</p><p>Through it all Ian thought, I\u2019m part of a unit. Even out here in the middle of nowhere, there were people to belong to. He\u2019d always known that, but never thought he\u2019d slip into their fold.</p><p>Jack just stood there, looking at Ian. He lifted one brow. \u201cYour girl, huh?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI was just talking to the kid,\u201d Ian said.</p><p>\u201cUh-huh. You better head for home, pal.\u201d</p><p>Fifteen</p><p>B y the time Ian walked into his cabin, it was after eight at night. He was so tired and chilled, he thought it would be half the night before he\u2019d warm up, much less be able to load the pickup with the next day\u2019s firewood. He didn\u2019t even have the door closed behind him when he heard a wild shriek and Marcie leaped at him, her arms around his neck and her legs wrapped around him.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he laughed, holding her clear of the floor. \u201cHey. You\u2019re on me like a tick.\u201d</p><p>She leaned away from his face. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m freezing and hungry. Were you scared?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head stubbornly. \u201cDid you find the boy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was found,\u201d Ian said. \u201cHurt and cold, but he\u2019s going to be all right. Can you warm and feed me? Would Abigail Adams do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe would, and in between, she\u2019d plow two fields and give birth.\u201d Marcie grinned at him.</p><p>God, she\u2019s so alive, he thought. It would be a travesty to hide her away on a mountaintop. But for now, having her on top this mountain was like the answer to a prayer.</p><p>Ian had to dig his way out to the john early the next morning, shoveling a path for Marcie to use when she woke. Then he loaded up the back of the truck with firewood, feeling better than he had a right to, since she hadn\u2019t let him sleep that much during the night. Then, rather than going straight to that intersection where he liked to sell firewood, he drove in the opposite direction a couple of miles, adjusted the blade on the plow, and cleared a path up to his neighbor\u2019s house.</p><p>He didn\u2019t like what he saw upon pulling up. There was no homey curl of smoke from the chimney; no sign of life. His first thought was\u2014if I have to hold another ice-cold body against my chest...</p><p>But the front door creaked open. The old man stood there in the frame, wearing his boots and coat.</p><p>\u201cI cleared your road, in case you need someone to get in or need to get out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cObliged,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cListen\u2014how you fixed for firewood? You got some canned food you can open up while the snow\u2019s heavy?\u201d Ian asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get by,\u201d he said.</p><p>Typically, that\u2019s when Ian would give him a small salute, then turn and head out down the drive to Highway 36, to get on with the things he had to do. Instead, with a muffled curse, he lifted up the tarp covering his load and filled his arms with split logs. He walked right up to the front door with the wood and the old guy barred the way. Ian stared down at him. \u201cCome on,\u201d he said. \u201cI brought you wood for your stove.\u201d</p><p>After a moment\u2019s hesitation, the guy let him in, grimacing. On his way to put the logs beside the stove, Ian caught a whiff of something disgusting. He kept his mouth shut, having an idea what the problem might be. When he crouched to stack the logs by the stove, he pulled off a glove and touched it. It was ice-cold. He stood and went back out the door and loaded up another big batch of logs. On his way to the door he glanced along the property and saw what he expected\u2014the outhouse was buried in a couple feet of snow and there was no path. The old boy couldn\u2019t split his own logs, if he had any to split, and he either couldn\u2019t get to the outhouse or was worried about falling in the snow and not being able to get up. As for shoveling, he likely just didn\u2019t have the stamina. He\u2019d been making far too much use of some indoor make-shift chamber pot that he\u2019d empty when he could get to the john. It was horrid.</p><p>Ian delivered a third load of wood and said, \u201cGet your fire going. I\u2019m going to clear your path for you. Where\u2019s the shovel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t bother. I\u2019ll\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t argue with me about it\u2014where\u2019s the damn shovel?\u201d</p><p>He tilted his head out the door. Ian went out, looked around to the side of the house and found the shovel leaning against the house, nearly buried by the snow. Well, he was missing his usual firewood crowd and he was in a hurry\u2014so it would have to be a narrow path. But this had to be done. Only a damn fool would let pride cause him to freeze to death in his own filth. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And that won\u2019t happen to me, because I won\u2019t let it. Just like he\u2019d always believed he wouldn\u2019t let himself turn into his father? It gave him pause...</p><p>When he\u2019d cleared the path, he pounded on the man\u2019s door. \u201cYou like Dinty Moore beef stew?\u201d he asked shortly.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI have a surplus. I thought I\u2019d leave some off later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo need to do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, man\u2014it\u2019s a friendly gesture. The woman at my place hates that stuff and won\u2019t eat it\u2014I\u2019ll leave by a few cans. If it\u2019s not going to be too big a burden for you to take it off my hands.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cYou grow weed over there on that ridge?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, no. What makes you ask that?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat you do over there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI cut down trees and sell firewood out of my truck. I fish some. Lately I shovel and plow a lot. I don\u2019t know your name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re even,\u201d the old boy said. \u201cSince I never knew yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIan Buchanan,\u201d he said, not putting out his hand.</p><p>\u201cMichael Jackson,\u201d the old boy said, and Ian let a burst of laughter escape. The old man frowned darkly and Ian realized, too late, that this fella probably hadn\u2019t seen television in decades, if ever.</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you,\u201d Ian said. \u201cMr. Jackson.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou sure you don\u2019t grow weed? Because I don\u2019t get mixed up with growers for Dinty Anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure,\u201d Ian said. \u201cI\u2019ll drop some canned goods by later on, but for now you can get to the john and heat up the house.\u201d</p><p>Ian went back to his truck, adjusted the plow so it wouldn\u2019t scrape on the highway and turned around to leave. There was no thank-you, no pleased to meet you. But then, Ian had been taking care of the old guy\u2019s drive for over two years without any exchanging social graces.</p><p>But, no doubt about it, things were declining some for the old man. Mr. Jackson had been able to plow his drive till now, but now he couldn\u2019t even make his way out back to the toilet and it was possible there was no food in the house. Remembering how Doc checked on old Raleigh at the end, he decided he would mention this situation to Doc. He couldn\u2019t have Michael Jackson on his conscience; his conscience was pretty full right now.</p><p>It took him longer than usual to deliver his wood. He had to wait for both his customers to go to their ATM\u2019s to withdraw cash as he couldn\u2019t afford to take a bad check at this point. By the time he got back to his cabin, it was afternoon and he\u2019d been gone eight hours. When he came in, Marcie had his bath water simmering on the stove. \u201cWell, Abigail,\u201d he said, smiling at her. \u201cI see you\u2019re ready for me to come home. Tell me, do you have the back forty plowed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the barn rebuilt,\u201d she said, smiling. \u201cYou took a long time today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome days are easier than others,\u201d he said. \u201cI have to make a quick run. Not fifteen minutes.\u201d He walked over to his cupboard. \u201cHow much of this beef stew you willing to part with?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think the old man next door laid in his supply.\u201d He started pulling out large cans and stacking them on the table till he had eight of them. He went to his trunk to get a duffel and loaded it up with the cans.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s nice, Ian. Sharing with him like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah. I just don\u2019t want a bad smell drifting over to my property. Keep my water going, will you? I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p><p>When Ian pulled up to Mike Jackson\u2019s house, he found the man no more friendly or receptive than earlier, but he didn\u2019t put up a fuss about the stew. He took it, nodded, and closed the door.</p><p>That moment was an epiphany. You can have it either way out here. You can get bonded with your town, your neighbors, belong to each other and have a connected existence where mutual reliance got you through the hard times. Or you could have it like this. If you never let anyone get near you, they soon got the message you wanted to be left alone. Out here, where neighbors were separated by miles, hills, big trees and, too often, hardship, no one fought for your friendship or your companionship. You\u2019d have to at least meet people halfway.</p><p>Ian hadn\u2019t given much of anything to the people around him here in Virgin River. He was just like his father. Thank God Marcie had ignored that...He\u2019d have to change things\u2014or he\u2019d end up like his old neighbor, like old Raleigh.</p><p>Ian went home, where he had Marcie playing Abigail, and it was cute. There were just a few days left to them and he was going to make the most of the time they had together and, because he knew it was hard for her to go and bring an end to this mission of hers, he\u2019d make it as easy on her as he could.</p><p>So he bathed, he ate, he held her against him for a little while and read aloud the spicy part of her romance novel, which was positively nothing compared to the real thing that followed. Then they spruced up a little and drove into Fortuna together to do some laundry. It was there that he told her his plan.</p><p>\u201cTomorrow, when I get home from delivering wood, I\u2019m going to dig out your car for you and tow it into town, park it at Jack\u2019s, put some chains in the trunk and show you how to put them on so you\u2019re safe when you\u2019re ready to head home. Please don\u2019t get a wild hare while I\u2019m not around and try to leave without a goodbye. It\u2019s not safe for you to take the bug down the mountain without chains. Promise?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPromise,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI want to be sure you\u2019re safe. Taken care of.\u201d</p><p>She looked down as he knew she would. Sad. Quiet. Marcie was hardly ever quiet.</p><p>With the sound of jeans clacking in the dryer and the hum of machines droning in the background he held her arms and turned her toward him. He lifted her chin with a finger. \u201cWe still have time, Marcie\u2014time for you to be sure you\u2019ve asked me everything on your mind so you feel right about going home. So you have peace of mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>He ran a knuckle down her cheek. \u201cMy mind hasn\u2019t felt this peaceful and calm in years. We\u2019ll make the most of the time you\u2019re here.\u201d He gave her lips a little kiss. \u201cI was so angry when I first faced you. I\u2019m not angry anymore. You made things good for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn awful lot more passed between us than I ever imagined,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I\u2019m glad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s fold our jeans and head back to town. I think we can get a toddy with Jack and Preacher before they close. Then we\u2019ll go home, stoke the fire and if you want me to, I\u2019ll read the dirty part of that book to you again.\u201d</p><p>She slapped his arm. \u201cPlease, it\u2019s not dirty! It\u2019s romantic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he grinned. \u201cVery.\u201d He pressed his lips against her forehead.</p><p>They went by Jack\u2019s to find it was his last night in town before taking the family back to Sacramento for the holidays, so Mel was there, as was Jack\u2019s sister, Brie, and her partner Mike Valenzuela. The mood was festive. Jack\u2019s son, David, was asleep in Preacher\u2019s quarters behind the bar and there was a lot of excitement about traveling for Christmas. Ian and Marcie ordered up beer and were pulled into the upbeat mood.</p><p>Doc didn\u2019t seem to be around, so while Marcie used the kitchen phone to check in with her sister, Ian took a moment to speak to Mel about his neighbor and suggested he might not be doing well. She just smiled and said, \u201cThanks, Ian. Before I leave in the morning, I\u2019ll speak to Doc and he\u2019ll check on things out there. If he needs assistance, Doc will do what he can. But be warned\u2014some of these old-timers don\u2019t change their ways. They\u2019re pigheaded about things like help, medical intervention, that sort of thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to tell me,\u201d Ian said. \u201cI was with old Raleigh when he went.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you already know.\u201d She smiled. \u201cHave a nice Christmas, Ian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou, too,\u201d he said.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t celebrated Christmas in a long time. The last time had been with Shelly before he left for Iraq. He\u2019d given her a ring and suddenly the holiday became all about getting engaged.</p><p>His father had never been much about Christmas. It was Ian\u2019s mother who made the holiday real, decorating, baking, fixing up gift baskets for everyone she knew, buying gifts that she\u2019d given a lot of thought to. His dad always came up with something lame for his wife\u2014a subscription to a women\u2019s magazine, a sweater too ugly for words that she\u2019d gush over, a couple of cookbooks. He was famous for caving in to something the house needed like a washer or vacuum cleaner and saying, \u201cAll right then, it\u2019s an early Christmas present.\u201d After his mother died, Christmas disappeared entirely. The tree didn\u2019t come out, the lights didn\u2019t go on the house, there was no special dinner. Ian was glad not to be around.</p><p>But on the Christmas Ian had given Shelly the ring, he\u2019d also given her a necklace and a beautiful peignoir. He remembered the details now\u2014that was when he decided he was not going to be like his father. He was going to be thoughtful.</p><p>For Ian, there still wouldn\u2019t be a real Christmas this year, yet his spirits were higher than they had been in years. He didn\u2019t have any decorations and would probably end up opening a can of Dinty Moore for his dinner. He was sorry he didn\u2019t have a present for Marcie and relieved she\u2019d had no opportunity or means to get one for him. But he liked that the town was not only getting into it, they were honoring the men and women who stood the watch. That in itself made it a joyous holiday.</p><p>To his surprise, he was starting to think in terms of things changing for him. Because I\u2019ve had these unusual, unexpected, illuminating weeks of Marcie. She opened his eyes in so many ways. And then he started to laugh to himself, because his mind turned to septic tanks. What would it take to buy and have a septic tank installed, a hot water heater, an indoor bathroom? It would start with money\u2014real money and not the hit and miss income of selling firewood in winter and moving furniture part-time in summer.</p><p>The guy who owned the moving company had offered him full-time work a couple of times because Ian was strong and fast, but he\u2019d said no thank you. He now considered getting in touch with that guy and getting his name on the list for full-time. Maybe he\u2019d even look around, see if there were other interested employers\u2014he was fit and not afraid of work.</p><p>Then a little voice reminded him that he hadn\u2019t filed a tax return in four years because he just didn\u2019t care. He had slipped out of the functional world; could he really expect to slip back in?</p><p>For the right reasons, he thought. She\u2019d taught him to laugh again. Just that alone warranted getting a full-time job and buying a septic tank, not because it would matter to Marcie. Because it would be good to improve, to live rather than exist. And hell\u2014it had been a long time since an honest-to-God shower.</p><p>At that moment, she came out of the kitchen and hopped up on the bar stool beside Ian, and she wasn\u2019t wearing her happy face. \u201cErin Elizabeth is getting a little pissy. She\u2019s ready for me to get home. She\u2019s past ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t be surprised,\u201d Ian said. \u201cYou did promise her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI kind of put off telling her I\u2019m staying here till Christmas Eve. It\u2019s just a four-hour drive, or so.\u201d</p><p>He slipped an arm around her shoulders and kissed her temple. \u201cIt\u2019s the right thing to do, Marcie. Your family loves you, needs you. You don\u2019t want to take that for granted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. Right now I just have too many right things to do. Heat your bath water, plow your fields...\u201d</p><p>\u201cMake me laugh...\u201d</p><p>\u201cMake you roar.\u201d She smiled at him.</p><p>\u201cNo matter what you think right now, you\u2019ll be glad once you\u2019re home,\u201d he said. \u201cFamiliar and comfortable and...Listen, when you told my father you were going to look for me, what did he say?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI told you,\u201d she said, focusing on her beer. \u201cHe said I was probably wasting my time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know him too well\u2014what else did he say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally, he was just a crotchety old\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCome on\u2014you never hold back. The truth.\u201d</p><p>She turned wide, innocent, troubled green eyes up to his. \u201cHe...He said if I found you, I should tell you he left the house and car to the paperboy.\u201d</p><p>Unexpectedly, Ian erupted in laughter. He threw his head back and howled. Marcie just stared at him while he laughed until his eyes watered. His lips were still curved in a smile when he got it under control.</p><p>\u201cThat is not funny,\u201d she said. \u201cI think it\u2019s awful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s so him,\u201d Ian said. \u201cI wonder if he burned all my baseball cards and letter jackets, or just gave them away.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, he doesn\u2019t deserve you,\u201d she said in a pout, taking a sip of her beer.</p><p>\u201cSo, no talk about me going back to Chico to see him one last time before he dies?\u201d he teased.</p><p>She looked startled. \u201cIan, I never wanted that. I\u2019m pretty sure you wouldn\u2019t see anything you didn\u2019t see four or five years ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou deny that you wanted me to see him one last time...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIan, no! No, not that! I wanted him to see you. I wanted him to know you were all right\u2014that no matter how mean he was, no matter how cruelly he treated you, you were good. Strong and good. Or, more specifically, I wanted you to let him know you were all that. I swear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d he asked, completely confused.</p> <p>She put her hand over his. \u201cBecause of the kindness you have in you. He doesn\u2019t deserve it, he\u2019s done nothing to earn it, he\u2019d never even thank you for it\u2014but he\u2019s on the decline and it would be a good thing to do\u2014to let the old guy know that in spite of everything, you\u2019re still a good and strong man with a heart and you\u2019re not like him. You\u2019ll never be like him. That\u2019s all. I thought maybe someday down the road you\u2019d think of that anyway, and I just didn\u2019t want you to think of it when it was too late.\u201d She smiled at him. \u201cNot for him, for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think you know me that well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve been watching you\u2014with the wildlife, with the neighbors, with everything\u2014it\u2019s natural to you to do anything that takes heart and generosity. I bet that was the hardest thing for you to give up.\u201d</p><p>On the morning of Christmas Eve, Ian didn\u2019t get up to deliver wood. He could have loaded the truck and made one more sale and delivery before Christmas and get a better-than-usual price. Instead, he made the coffee and served a hot cup to Marcie. \u201cIt\u2019s morning, sunshine. It\u2019s a big day for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not selling wood?\u201d she asked sleepily, sitting up.</p><p>\u201cNot today. Your coffee\u2019s hot at no risk.\u201d He grinned at her.</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d she said, taking the cup. \u201cYou make a very adequate Abigail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me what I can do to make this easier for you.\u201d</p> <p>She sipped her coffee and thought for a moment. \u201cTwo things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cName them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake me to town and leave me. Say goodbye to me and just go\u2014don\u2019t linger, don\u2019t watch me drive away.\u201d</p><p>He gave a nod. \u201cIf that\u2019s how you want to do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd can you tell me\u2014do you feel anything for me?\u201d</p><p>He put his big hand against her wild curls. \u201cI feel everything for you. But that won\u2019t change the facts. We\u2019re strangers from two separate worlds that won\u2019t easily merge, and I\u2019m still a guy with what you call issues\u2014piles of them. Not really ready to make any rapid-fire changes, though I think I made some small ones in spite of myself. I have a lot less hair, for one thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve come along nicely.\u201d She gave him a little kiss. \u201cI think if I had more time...\u201d</p><p>He stilled her chin in his hand, commanding her attention. \u201cListen. I won\u2019t kid you\u2014you changed everything. Come back sometime if you feel like it. But if you don\u2019t, I won\u2019t hold it against you. Remember what you told me\u2014that after you did this, after you found me and thanked me, asked me some questions and told me the things you had to be sure I knew, you were going to be free to move on. It\u2019s okay, Marcie. Even after what passed between us. Especially after what passed between us\u2014you can move on if you want to. I expect that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what if what I want is you?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cThe only thing in the world that could possibly make me sad is if I couldn\u2019t make you happy. That\u2019s what scares me the most\u2014that you would want me, and I\u2019d let you down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you even think that way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a sorry old habit,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI bet you could break that habit if you\u2019d just let yourself.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the best things about you\u2014your eternal optimism.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Ian, that\u2019s not optimism. It\u2019s faith. You should give it a try sometime.\u201d</p><p>Sixteen</p><p>A t one o\u2019clock Ian drove Marcie into town to where her little green VeeDub was parked. He showed her how to put the chains on her rear tires if she ran into snow. But right now the roads were clear as was the sky, and she was good to go if she left within the next couple of hours. Then he put his arms around her and gave her a long, loving kiss. He didn\u2019t even look around to see if they were being watched. And he said, \u201cThank you, for matching me for stubborn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not all together about this,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is really hard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you get closer to home, you\u2019ll start to feel good about being with all of them. They were always there for you,\u201d he reminded her.</p><p>\u201cGood\u2014\u201d</p><p>He put a finger over her lips. \u201cShhh. Don\u2019t say it. Drive carefully.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I write to you, will you answer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d he promised.</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s progress,\u201d she said weakly. \u201cI...Ah...I left you something. I slipped it into your clothes trunk when you weren\u2019t looking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, Marcie\u2014you shouldn\u2019t have done that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a Christmas gift or anything. Something I meant to give you, but the time was never right. And then I decided you should have it in private. I\u2019ll see you again, Ian.\u201d She gave him a tremulous smile and a tear ran down her cheek. \u201cSaw and chop carefully,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd take good care of Buck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d he said, touching her lips once more. \u201cTill later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, then. Till later.\u201d</p><p>She walked up the steps into the bar while he went to his truck. She heard that rough, loud motor as he drove away. She realized he hadn\u2019t asked for a phone number where he could reach her if he got crazy and decided to call. She\u2019d leave her number with Preacher, and Ian had her home number in those letters he hadn\u2019t read. But she had little confidence that Ian would be hanging around the town after she was gone. In fact, she worried that he would pull deeper into himself.</p><p>The bar was quiet at this time of day\u2014only a couple of locals finishing up their lunch. Preacher came out of the back and said, \u201cHow\u2019s things, Marcie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. Good. I\u2019ll be heading back to Chico in a little while. Could I grab a cup of coffee first?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bet. You okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess. I said goodbye to Ian. I hate to leave. Who would\u2019ve believed I\u2019d find him and get so close to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you found him,\u201d Preacher said, pouring her coffee. \u201cAnd I suppose you took care of all your unfinished business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. We talked a lot. It\u2019s all good,\u201d she said, lifting her eyes bravely.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I like to hear. He seems like a stand-up guy. He found that boy, you know. Travis Goesel. Saved his life.\u201d</p><p>Marcie\u2019s eyes shot open wide. \u201cIan did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Dug him out of a shelter he\u2019d made to keep himself from freezing, carried him over a mile. The kid\u2019s about six feet tall and built solid, heavy. Ian tore off his shirt to warm him.... Really, another hour or so, it would\u2019ve been just a body. Kid\u2019s doing just fine. He\u2019ll be opening presents with his family tomorrow morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he told me\u2014Ian said he\u2019d been found. He wouldn\u2019t take credit for anything. Listen, Preacher...Jesus, I don\u2019t know how to say this, but could you sometimes try to draw him out a little? Ian? It doesn\u2019t have to be anything big\u2014but while I was here, he came off the mountain a little bit and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, kid. We like having him around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I want to leave you my number in Chico, just in case.\u201d She pulled a bar napkin toward her and wrote her name and phone number on it. \u201cIf you ever need to reach me for any reason, that\u2019s my home phone. It\u2019s got a machine, you can leave a message.\u201d Then she pulled the napkin back and wrote some more. \u201cCell phone,\u201d she said. \u201cI want you to be able to reach me if you\u2014Well, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely. Sure.\u201d He folded it and put it in his pocket. Then he put the coffeepot at her side. \u201cListen, with this candlelight thing going on tonight, there could be a crowd, so we\u2019re working in the kitchen\u2014I gotta get back to Paige and help out. If you need anything, like a sandwich or anything, just stick your head in the kitchen and holler.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo ahead. I\u2019m fine. I\u2019ll take off after a cup of coffee, thanks.\u201d</p><p>So, he found the boy and saved him. And then took all his canned stew to the old man next door. Either Ian had changed dramatically or he\u2019d always been the kind of man who was drawn to helping out when he could. She\u2019d seen a few changes in him, but what she suspected was that this life alone was not really who he was. He hadn\u2019t run off so much as he\u2019d been abandoned\u2014by the Corps, his girl, his father, his brothers in arms. So he isolated himself for a while until he could get his bearings, figure out where he was going and how he was going to live. It was possible that the information she brought him about Bobby\u2019s last three years and passing helped him find some closure in that. That\u2019s what she came to do. If she\u2019d done that, then that was all she could ask.</p><p>As for closure for her, the opposite had happened. She loved him. She wasn\u2019t sure she could give him up. But for now, she had to return to her roots, her home. She couldn\u2019t give up those people either.</p><p>The door opened behind her but she never even turned. \u201cYou!\u201d she heard. \u201cYoung woman!\u201d She turned to see Doc standing there. \u201cCan you drive a Hummer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not,\u201d she said. \u201cI own a Volkswagen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019ll learn. Melinda\u2019s gone and I got a head injury I have to get to Valley Hospital. I can\u2019t drive and tend that. Come on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m leaving...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow!\u201d he snapped, turning to go.</p><p>Marcie sat for a second, thinking. The door opened again. \u201cI said now!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, for God\u2019s sake,\u201d she muttered, grabbing her purse and following Doc.</p><p>Ian went back to his cabin and fed the stove. He thought about splitting some logs or shoveling or checking on the old guy next door, but instead he sat at his table and did nothing. Nothing, except remember every expression on her face, every sentence she\u2019d uttered. Then he pulled her library book in front of him and reread that romantic passage she loved, the one that got them going. He really couldn\u2019t remember loving that sweet in his whole life. Was it just because it had been so long? Or was he right when he considered that, for two people without much practice, they sure learned how to please each other well in a short period of time. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>This was good, he told himself, that she had gone. She needed to go home, where she belonged. It wasn\u2019t his home anymore and hadn\u2019t been since his father put the final nail in the coffin of their relationship. Ian had faced the reality\u2014there was no one there for him anymore. No one.</p><p>Except Marcie, the girl who\u2019d made him laugh and love.</p><p>But that had been here, where circumstances forced them together. Once things settled back into place, what they had together here wouldn\u2019t be the same.</p> <p>Still, he wondered what it would feel like to see the old man one more time before he was gone, before it was too late. Ian had no illusions; his father wouldn\u2019t have become warm and fuzzy. In fact, he\u2019d probably be worse, given age and illness. He was rigid and unforgiving and always had been. It had been impossible to impress him and make him proud back when he was in the Corps, it would be impossible now, after the last four years.</p><p>But, maybe facing the old man was the cure to becoming him. Marcie might be right\u2014Ian didn\u2019t have to forgive his father so much as forgive himself for hating his father, for letting his father\u2019s disapproval and meanness shape him into an angry man. It might be the passage out.</p><p>How could a goofy, stubborn little redhead be so incredibly insightful? It just didn\u2019t work in his head. It didn\u2019t add up.</p><p>Ian remembered the something she\u2019d left for him, but he didn\u2019t want to see what it was; he wasn\u2019t sure he was up to it. But then the other part of him thought if he just had something concrete to remember her by, it might bring joy to his days. He went to the trunk and there, right on top, was an envelope. It was addressed to Marcie. On the back of the envelope she had written something.</p><p>Darling Ian,</p> <p>It was my plan to show you this letter. I didn\u2019t think I could part with it, but as it turns out I want you to have it. You\u2019ll see why. And I meant what I said, Ian. I fell in love with you. Marcie.</p><p>He stood by the woodstove and began to read the letter and then had to sit down to finish it. It was a letter to Marcie from Bobby. It was written on that thin military-issue letter paper that you fold into its own envelope\u2014thin, pale blue tissue with the image of an American Eagle on the page. From the date on the postmark, it was very likely Bobby had been sitting right next to him while they both took a couple of minutes to dash off letters to their women in time to make the postal pickup.</p><p>Hey, Marcie, baby. I miss you, girl. I think about you every minute of every day and I\u2019m counting the seconds till I feel you up against me again. Thanks, baby, for being so tough through all this shit. I couldn\u2019t be with any other kind of woman. Some of these guys\u2014their girls write \u2019em these terrible letters about how bad life is for them while their guy\u2019s away and I couldn\u2019t take it if you did that. How\u2019d I know you were the one when we were fourteen? I must be a frickin\u2019 genius!</p><p>I have to tell you something. I\u2019m not chicken, telling you in a letter instead of when I get home\u2014I just can\u2019t wait, that\u2019s all. See, I want this forever. You probably think I\u2019m out of my head to say that, now especially. I mean, this place is awful. We haven\u2019t had that much trouble, but other squads have been fired on, ambushed, run into suicide bombers, all that crap, and we know it could be us any second.</p><p>One of the reasons it hasn\u2019t been us yet is Ian. The man\u2019s unbelievable. I\u2019ve never known anyone like him and I\u2019ve known some real awesome people, especially in the Marines. This is one helluva jarhead, baby. He knows what he\u2019s doing. He can lead you into hostile territory and make you think you want to be there. He\u2019s the person who keeps everyone from feeling sorry for themselves. I\u2019ve seen him put himself between a young marine and gunfire. We had an injury on the road\u2014kid stepped in a hole and broke his ankle and Ian carried him all the way to camp, must of been five miles. Wouldn\u2019t hand him off or share the load. I offered to take the kid for a mile, but Ian said, Keep your eye on your business, marine, so I don\u2019t end up carrying two of you.</p><p>We found a couple of armed insurgents on a door-to-door search and I watched Ian take a guy down bare-handed. An hour later I saw Ian holding a little Iraqi baby and talking to the mother, smiling at her, reassuring her. I don\u2019t know how he does that\u2014goes from the strongest, meanest guy here to the sweetest. And then at the end of the day, when everyone\u2019s pissed off and dirty and tired, he talks to every man, makes sure they have their head on straight. He doesn\u2019t want anyone too shook or scared or lonesome not to keep themselves alive if we have trouble. One of the guys got a Dear John and he was pathetic. Ian could have told him to get a grip and act tough, but instead he kind of talked him through it and when the guy cried, Ian didn\u2019t make fun of him or anything. He just kept a hand on the guy\u2019s back, solid, and talked to him real soft, told him there weren\u2019t a lot of guarantees in life and some things took a while to get past, but if it was any consolation, his brothers wouldn\u2019t ever leave him. If the girl couldn\u2019t stick, Ian told him, better to find out early. It takes a real special woman to put up with a marine.</p> <p>He\u2019s right about that, baby\u2014and you\u2019re it. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re up to it, me taking on the Corps for a career, but I hope so. Thing is, if I could be half the leader and friend Ian is, I\u2019d be a frickin\u2019 legend. I can\u2019t wait till you finally meet him. You\u2019re going to admire the guy as much as I do. And then you\u2019re probably going to coldcock him for making the Corps look so good to me. Ha ha. He won\u2019t be surprised\u2014I told him all about you, that you might be a little bitty thing, but you aren\u2019t afraid to stand up and speak up.</p><p>I miss you so much, baby. I\u2019ll be back before you know it. I love you, Marce.</p><p>Ian took a few deep breaths and then read it again. What was this? How could Bobby think that much of him? It was goofy hero worship and Ian didn\u2019t feel he deserved that. Ian was just doing the job he was trained to do\u2014it wasn\u2019t anything special.</p><p>He was sure right about Marcie, though. She was a little pistol. A beautiful little pistol who brought sunlight and laughter with her everywhere she went. One determined little girl. She didn\u2019t quit early; she\u2019d have made a good marine. Bobby was lucky he found her in the ninth grade. It wasn\u2019t easy to find a woman that strong, that powerful, that sure of herself and what she wanted.</p><p>After all she\u2019d been through, after everything they\u2019d shared, what kind of a guy doesn\u2019t at least say \u201cI love you, too\u201d?</p><p>Doc took Marcie on a wild ride out to a farm in the foothills and snapped at her to help him with the gurney. Then Doc climbed in the back to administer to their patient, a farmer who\u2019d taken a donkey\u2019s hoof in the head. His head was split open and he was seeing double, but he was conscious. So while Doc took care of his patient he yelled at Marcie about her driving, which she couldn\u2019t understand because she thought she was doing very well considering she wasn\u2019t used to a vehicle that size.</p><p>When they got to Valley Hospital they had to wait around for X-rays before Doc would leave the farmer. Then Doc made her drive back to Virgin River so she could experience this vehicle without the yelling in the background. By the time they pulled into town, she was a wreck.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d Doc said. \u201cI\u2019ll buy you a drink. You earned one. You did just fine.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell you\u2019d never know it from the way you yelled at me,\u201d she grumbled.</p><p>\u201cNah, you were half as good as Melinda\u2014which is good. She\u2019s had practice. She slings that thing around like it\u2019s a skateboard. Come on. It\u2019s time for a drink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally, I was going to be out of here five hours ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell now, don\u2019t you feel good that you were able to help? Lend a hand? If you hadn\u2019t been sitting right there, I\u2019d have had to take Paige or maybe the patient\u2019s wife, who wouldn\u2019t have been able to keep her eyes on the road. It was a lucky break for all of us. Have a drink and some dinner. You can drive in the dark, can\u2019t you? We\u2019ll fill you with food and soak you up in coffee before you go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she said wearily. \u201cSure. Why not. I\u2019m already too late for Christmas Eve dinner in Chico.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere you go. Another break.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy sister might not see it that way....\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat would be even better,\u201d Doc said, \u201cis if you had two drinks and spent the night in the spare bed at my place. That would be even better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cReally, I have to go. I can\u2019t hang around here. It just makes me sad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever you think you have to do,\u201d Doc said. \u201cIt\u2019s an open offer.\u201d</p><p>The bar was packed with people, gathering for their little program around the tree. There were trays of snacks sitting all around\u2014from hot hors d\u2019oeuvres to Christmas cookies. People whom Marcie had never met introduced themselves, asked her where she was from and if she would stay for the carols. She did accept a brandy from Preacher, then sampled the snacks and finally she migrated to the kitchen and called Erin. \u201cI apologize, but I\u2019m running late...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Erin nearly exploded. \u201cWhat are you thinking? You promised to come home!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m coming,\u201d she said. \u201cListen, there was an emergency\u2014a guy from town got kicked in the head by his donkey and Doc needed someone to drive to the hospital so he could tend the head and...Well, I got delayed by five hours and I\u2019m sorry. So I\u2019ll be catching Santa in the act, but I\u2019ll get there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s dark! I don\u2019t want to worry about you!\u201d</p><p>She took a breath. \u201cI drive in the dark all the time, but go ahead and sit up and worry if you want to. I\u2019m going to have some food and some coffee\u2014then I\u2019ll be on my way.\u201d</p><p>When Marcie migrated back into the bar, she was worn down. She felt as though she had disappointed everyone, not the least of whom herself. She\u2019d grown tired. No doubt it came from the long day, the emotion of leaving Ian, the wild ride with Doc. But most of all she felt the disappointment that the thing she\u2019d started with Ian didn\u2019t seem destined to go further.</p><p>But then, what could she expect? That they\u2019d laugh together, love together for a week or so and he\u2019d change everything about himself? And for all her big talk\u2014that she\u2019d stay in that cabin forever\u2014she wasn\u2019t at all sure that after a year of that she wouldn\u2019t be out of her mind. Besides, she had brought him some relief, but she hadn\u2019t healed him; he had lots of healing left to do. And he probably knew what he needed\u2014to split and sell his logs, feed the deer, sing in the morning and ease slowly back into the world.</p><p>Inside, she began to grieve. She couldn\u2019t help that her heart ached. But she reminded herself that what she wanted most was for Ian to see his own way, to find peace and happiness. With or without her. Marcie knew she had her faults, but being selfish was not one of them.</p><p>People were starting to move out of the bar and gather round the tree. She followed. On the porch someone said, \u201cHere, Marcie,\u201d and handed her a candle. She thought it wouldn\u2019t make much difference if she stayed to sing a couple of carols before starting her drive.</p><p>The tree was splendid; it sparkled and shone in the clear night. The star beamed a path down the street. There were many more people gathered outside than there had been in the bar. Clearly they\u2019d been arriving for a while. There was a lot of mingling and chatting, laughing and lighting candles. No one seemed to be in charge. Then someone finally said, \u201cAway In The Manger.\u201d Slowly, haltingly, singing began\u2014a little clumsy at first. By the time they were halfway through the first verse, and this was only a first-verse kind of crowd, their voices had become stronger. Then someone else shouted, \u201cSilent Night!\u201d and they began again. Next, \u201cWe Three Kings!\u201d and then came \u201cSilver Bells,\u201d which they stumbled through badly until everyone, including Marcie, was laughing. There were a lot of mumbled suggestions and milling around when a voice, clear and strong and beautiful, came from the back of the crowd. Softly. Slowly. Mellowly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Oh holy night</p><p>The stars are brightly shining</p><p>\u2019Tis the night of our dear Savior\u2019s birth!</p> <p>Marcie\u2019s heart leaped; her eyes filled with tears as she whirled around, only to find a crowd of people behind her also turning to his voice. She handed off her candle, breathless, blurry-eyed, and pushed her way through the crowd, separating them so she could pass. By the time she got through the people, she saw him there, standing across the street. The light of the star fell on him, and she hardly knew him. He was clean shaven, dressed in his good pants, shirt and denim jacket. And beside him on the ground was a duffel. Packed.</p><p>Her hand rose shakily to her throat, which was constricted and tight. Tears ran down her cheeks. He smiled at her only briefly, then his eyes rose to the star as he sang.</p><p>Fall on your knees</p><p>Oh, hear the angel voices</p><p>Oh, night divine</p> <p>Oh, night when Christ was born</p><p>Oh, night divine</p><p>Oh night, oh night divine</p><p>His was the angel\u2019s voice.</p><p>Fall on your knees, indeed. It was all Marcie could do to stay upright. But Ian didn\u2019t stop singing; he gave the hymn everything he had, then another chorus, loud and moving. There was not so much as a murmur within the crowd and no one joined in, so stunning was the voice, the passion. And when he finally came to the end of the hymn, he just let his chin drop in reverence, looking down.</p><p>First there were gasps of delight, then applause began, but Marcie just walked toward him, her eyes shining, her legs weak. When she reached him, she put a hand against the cheek that bore the long, thin scar. And his hand was against her soft, red curls.</p> <p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d she asked softly.</p><p>\u201cPracticing that singing for people instead of wildlife,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re the one who shouldn\u2019t still be here. I thought I\u2019d stop by for a carol or two, then head out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLong story. But where are you going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChico.\u201d He smiled at her. \u201cThere\u2019s a girl there I have business with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll stay with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe one night, since it\u2019s getting so late. Then I\u2019ll check with the old man\u2019s paperboy and see if I can get a let on a room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Ian...\u201d She threw her arms around him and he held her off the ground. He kissed her soundly, to the cheers of their audience.</p><p>But then he put her on her feet and held her upper arms. \u201cListen, Abigail\u2014there are some things you have to know. I have fourteen hundred and eleven dollars to my name and I need gas. No savings. I haven\u2019t filed a tax return in four years. If I can\u2019t pay the taxes on that mountain in the spring, it\u2019ll just go away, and I can\u2019t pay the taxes if I don\u2019t find a job. I haven\u2019t had a real job in a long time. And my father\u2014I don\u2019t have any illusions about it being a tearful reunion. He\u2019ll probably just kick me to the curb. So go into this knowing it\u2019s still a mess. Just because I sang out loud doesn\u2019t mean\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou think I\u2019m a wimp?\u201d she asked, incredulous. \u201cYou think after everything I\u2019m weak? Then why are you coming? I know how you hate weakness!\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo see if there\u2019s anything to us. Marcie, I wouldn\u2019t hurt you for the world, so tell me you\u2019re up to this if it all falls apart. Because going in, there\u2019s a lot on the minus side, starting with me. I could be a huge disappointment to you in the end.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you return my library books?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t,\u201d he said, shaking his head. \u201cThere were only so many things I could do if I was going to get to you before Christmas.\u201d</p><p>She smiled up at him. \u201cWell, I never did know quite where I was going. But there was this light...And I followed...I told you, I love you. Ian, I love you so much. I\u2019ll start there and take everything else as it comes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I didn\u2019t tell you,\u201d Ian said. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to mess you up, let you down. But I can\u2019t remember ever feeling this way before. I love you, Marcie. I\u2019ll try anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, then. Why don\u2019t we just start with faith and we\u2019ll go from there?\u201d</p><p>He grinned at her. \u201cErin Elizabeth is going to be a little disgruntled when she sees me.\u201d</p><p>She patted his cheek. \u201cShe won\u2019t even recognize you for a couple of days, at least. You look so magnificent. Who\u2019s going to feed Buck?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBuck\u2019s on his own for now. We\u2019ll catch up with him when the snow melts. Does that work for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfect,\u201d she said. And she thought, if these mountains are beautiful in winter, they must be heart-stopping in spring with the promise of new life. Like hers.</p><p>Like his...</p><p>Like theirs... </p> </body></html>"]
