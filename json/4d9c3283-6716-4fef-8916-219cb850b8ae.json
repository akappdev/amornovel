But neither had she expected it to be the beginning of a lifelong nightmare.</p><p>It started with Hunter being a total jerk.</p> <p>She wasn\u2019t sure what started their argument, only that it escalated into him saying that he didn\u2019t intend to speak to her again until she apologized. She told him he\u2019d better not plan on speaking to her again ever then, because she hadn\u2019t the least intention of apologizing. She hadn\u2019t done anything, other than suggest that despite the fact that he had been given an award in drama club, he hadn\u2019t needed to kiss his leading lady quite so long, or so deeply, in the auditorium, in front of the world. Or their small part of it anyway\u2014the entire high school. When he left her house that afternoon, she assumed that he\u2019d call her and be the one to say that he was sorry.</p><p>The call never came. She heard the next morning that he had invited his leading lady, Cindy Lee, to the prom.</p><p>She avoided her friends, and allowed herself to indulge in some well-earned tears. She argued with herself all afternoon. Hunter was going to head straight out to California after graduation and try to make it big in Hollywood. She was heading to NYU, and she had been ecstatic about her acceptance there and the small scholarship that would allow her to go. Eventually, living across the country from one another, she and Hunter would have most probably fallen apart. She should have accepted the fact long ago that Hunter had an eye for other girls. He was young. So was she. They should spend some time without commitment.</p><p>But she didn\u2019t really want to split. She had been in love with Hunter since ninth grade. They had shared the years since. Very long, good years, or so it had seemed.</p><p>In the end, Hunter did call her. He was so sorry. He\u2019d ruined everything, but he couldn\u2019t get out of going to their prom with Cindy Lee.</p> <p>She accepted his apology with a maturity her mother assured her was beyond her years. And it was her mother who suggested that she ask her friend, Josh.</p><p>\u201cJosh!\u201d she\u2019d said with surprise.</p><p>But it was only momentary. Josh was a loner. He was a genius with computers, math, and science. He was painfully shy himself, but delighted when she wanted to try out a song, a dance move, or a monologue on him. They had lived down the street from one another in their rather rural area for years, and had long ago become friends. They didn\u2019t run in the same social circles, but Darcy had steadfastly maintained her friendship with him, no matter what anyone else thought. Over the years, some of her friends had accepted him.</p><p>And amazingly, Josh had been able to warn her about many of the pratfalls she might have encountered in life. Go with Hunter tonight for ice cream, he had urged her once. Don\u2019t let him go alone. And she had done so, and Cindy Lee had been there, flirting with Hunter, until she had realized that Darcy was with him. There were other things. He\u2019d made her stop her father from driving to the store one day when it turned out that his brakes were bad. Both her folks listened to Josh. She had learned to do so, too.</p><p>Other people, she knew, were frightened by some of his predictions. He had known when Mrs. Shumacher down the street was about to die of cancer. He had known when Brad Taylor was going to break his leg during a football game. A lot of the kids called him a freak. But despite her little spat with Hunter, she had always held her own in school. She could bring Josh to the prom, and he\u2019d be accepted, because he\u2019d be with her. Oh, they\u2019d talk about her\u2014and him\u2014behind their backs, but what did she care? Hunter had already hurt her just about as badly as she could be hurt; she was cut right to her eighteen-year-old heart.</p><p>And besides, the whole high school thing was over. A new life was about to begin.</p> <p>Josh hemmed and hawed at first, skeptical. \u201cDarcy, I\u2019ll just look like the geek you dressed up and brought along.\u201d</p><p>But she\u2019d laughed and assured him, \u201cJosh, honestly, you\u2019re a good-looking guy. Tall, lean, great eyes, and if you don\u2019t mind, we\u2019ll shop together. But if you\u2019d feel uncomfortable, we won\u2019t go. We\u2019ll just see a movie or something that night. I mean, if you\u2019re willing to keep me company.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d smiled at that. \u201cI\u2019d rather be in your company than anyone else\u2019s, that\u2019s for sure. But you don\u2019t have to take me. Half the school would go with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s doubtful and it doesn\u2019t matter. If you don\u2019t want to go, I don\u2019t want to go.\u201d</p><p>At that, Josh had given her a strange smile. \u201cIf you want to go to the prom with the class nerd, lady, I wouldn\u2019t dream of stopping you.\u201d</p><p>To her amazement, the planning was fun. Although he usually dressed like a couch potato himself, Josh had a good eye for clothes. Hand in hand they went shopping together. They ran into a number of her friends at the mall, and she was delighted to see their eyes widen at first, and then seem to focus more deeply on Josh. He was able to help Cissy Miller with a math problem she\u2019d been dragging around for days, and over tacos at the food court, he found a new friend in Brenda Greeley, a really beautiful girl, and the head cheerleader.</p><p>When they got back to shopping, he made Darcy try on a dress she hated on the rack, and loved once she slipped into it. It turned out that one of Josh\u2019s computer buddies worked in the store, and he was able to give her his employee discount, so she could afford the gown. The young man\u2019s name was Riley O\u2019Hare, and he told Darcy he was actually in her auditorium class. She apologized sincerely for never having met him, and when they left the shop, she thoughtfully told Josh that she had never known that she could be so rude or careless herself.</p><p>\u201cDarcy, you? Never,\u201d he told her devoutly. \u201cRude and careless is when you don\u2019t acknowledge someone when they talk to you, when you can\u2019t even lift your hand for a wave. Or when you push over a thin guy just \u2018cause he\u2019s not on the football team, or can\u2019t really join in on a jam with a guitar. Darcy, you know that I love you, and it\u2019s one hell of an overused term, but you\u2019re a special kind of girl, you know?\u201d He looked embarrassed suddenly. \u201cHey, come on, we\u2019ve got to find something for me. I can\u2019t take out a girl like you looking the way I usually do.\u201d</p> <p>So next came Josh\u2019s turn, and when she advised him on a shirt and suit, somewhat funky and retro, he, too was delighted, thinking that he looked something like a New Age Mozart.</p><p>There was only one fly in the ointment that day.</p><p>Mike Van Dam.</p><p>He was friends with Hunter, and dating Brenda. Darcy realized later that he must have seen them in the food court, and seen Brenda talking to Josh. When they were leaving the mall, the door suddenly swung back on Josh, who was carrying the bags filled with their purchases. Mike, broad shoulders thrusting forward, was suddenly there, standing over Josh, who had wound up on the floor. \u201cHey, there, geek-boy, having a problem standing?\u201d He reached a hand down, which was accepted by Josh, except that as soon as Josh was halfway up, Mike released him. Josh fell again, hard, on his tailbone.</p><p>\u201cMike, what the hell is the matter with you?\u201d Darcy demanded, infuriated, reaching down to give Josh a hand herself. Mike caught her by the shoulders, spinning her around.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is the matter with you, Darcy? Trying to make fools of us all by taking up with the riffraff, the scum of the school?\u201d</p><p>She jerked free from him. \u201cMike, you idiot. What? Are you going to live in your little high school tough-guy haven for the rest of your life? Scared for your future, because football star and all, you just might not get into college, and a decade from now, you\u2019ll still be on the couch, an armchair quarterback, while Josh is making his way up the ladder in a top law firm?\u201d</p><p>That got him, and she knew it did. Josh was on his feet by then. Mike stared at him furiously.</p><p>\u201cI carry mace,\u201d Darcy warned softly.</p><p>Mike cocked his square-jawed head, blue eyes burning, cropped blond hair seeming to stand on edge. He made a clicking sound and pointed a finger at Josh. \u201cYou\u2019re a dead man,\u201d he told him.</p><p>Josh stared back at him, a strange smile of amusement and irony curling his lips. \u201cMaybe. But so are you,\u201d he said very softly.</p><p>Mike was about to go into another fit of rage. Darcy grabbed the bags and pushed Josh out the door. For a moment, they could hear Mike raging behind them. \u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean, geek-boy? You\u2019d better be careful, I\u2019ll\u2014\u201d</p><p>They never heard the rest of the threat. The door had swung shut once again.</p><p>Darcy looked at Josh uneasily as she quickly led him to the car. \u201cWhat was that all about? You didn\u2019t have one of your little premonitions there, did you?\u201d</p><p>Josh laughed and shook his head. \u201cNo, kid, no. But he doesn\u2019t know that.\u201d</p><p>Darcy laughed as well, delighted. Josh had probably managed to scare Mike through the next many nights.</p><p>The night of the prom came. As long as Darcy had known Josh, she barely knew his father. His mom had died when he was an infant, and his dad had almost never been around. All Josh had ever said about him was that he was the head of a company with offices in D.C., which was why he had to spend so much time away from their small town in southern Pennsylvania. He was a nice enough man when Darcy saw him, though he had seemed ancient from the first day they had met. She hadn\u2019t realized, though, until Josh picked her up for the prom just how much money his dad must make. Josh\u2019s graduation present had been a brand-new Volvo, a sporty one at that.</p><p>Josh brought her the most beautiful corsage she had ever seen. Her mother fussed around the two of them, taking picture after picture while her father beamed.</p><p>Josh, she discovered that night, was also an amazing dancer. Flushing, he informed her that he\u2019d had some experience because his father had brought him to cotillion classes when he\u2019d been in junior high.</p><p>Her friends were good that night, especially Brenda, and even the guys had to toe the line somewhat, since their dates seemed to accept Josh. Hunter, however, never approached her once. She saw that he and Mike were watching them from a distance, however, and that Mike looked as if he were about to explode when she and Josh won the \u201cWild and Wacky\u201d dance contest. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Hunter just looked sad.</p><p>Darcy smiled at Josh, and he looked at her, curiously arching a brow. \u201cThank you,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cMe? Thank you! I\u2019m like a male Cinderella tonight. Prince-not-so-charming, feeling like the beau of the ball.\u201d</p> <p>She shook her head. \u201cNo. You made me realize that my life wasn\u2019t over without Hunter, and that there is a world ahead.\u201d</p><p>He caught both her hands, squeezing them tightly. \u201cDon\u2019t you ever forget that, Darcy, you hear? The world is out there, and it\u2019s yours. It\u2019s a beautiful world.\u201d He spoke urgently, staring into Darcy\u2019s eyes. \u201cEven when things don\u2019t seem quite right. Some people, just with a smile here and there, a kind word, make it all a better place for everyone around them. You\u2019re one of those people. Remember that. There are times in life to be sad, to feel pain, but you\u2019re a giver. Don\u2019t ever let yourself be downed by fear, hardship, or even sorrow that\u2019s so deep, you may not feel like going on.\u201d</p><p>A chill swept into her. \u201cJosh, you\u2019re scaring me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, Darcy.\u201d He seemed to return to himself again. \u201cHey, I don\u2019t believe it. They\u2019re playing a Charleston! Want to try it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy the hell not?\u201d</p> <p>In a while, she forgot his words, because they did just have so much fun.</p><p>She was vaguely aware of the amount of drinking going on, the punch being spiked, and even the drugs. Brenda was upset because she was sure Mike was getting smashed. She was uneasy about the guys driving, but she had no control over any of it and decided that she was just going to enjoy the miracle that occurred; Hunter had thrown her over just before their senior prom, and she was still there, and having the best time of her life.</p><p>At last, it was time to go. Darcy had booked a room at the hotel where most of the kids were going after the prom, but she didn\u2019t want to go. Josh agreed that a perfect end to the evening might be watching a few movies, then seeing the sun come up. They were in his brand-new Volvo and heading out of the parking lot when the first warning that they were never going to make it occurred.</p><p>There was a tap against Josh\u2019s bumper. Just a tap. It barely jerked them forward.</p><p>Josh turned around, swearing softly. \u201cToo much alcohol in there, or kids who just can\u2019t drive.\u201d</p><p>With lights blaring around them, they really couldn\u2019t see who was behind them.</p> <p>Josh pulled out on the road.</p><p>\u201cCare if I rifle through the CDs?\u201d Darcy asked him.</p><p>\u201cBe my guest.\u201d</p><p>She was oohing over his Beatles collection when the next tap against the bumper came. This one was harder, slamming against the car.</p><p>\u201cDammit!\u201d Josh swore.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell...?\u201d Darcy said, looking back.</p><p>She didn\u2019t really need to look back. A car pulled alongside them. Mike was at the wheel, in his souped-up old Chevy. The car was a battle-ax with an engine that might have made the grade at the Daytona 500. His window was down. He had a beer in his hand while driving.</p><p>\u201cAss!\u201d Darcy said.</p> <p>Josh was quiet, staring ahead. He didn\u2019t seem frightened. Only...strangely resigned.</p><p>Mike was making signs for her to roll the window down.</p><p>\u201cMight as well do it,\u201d Josh said.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s an idiot. Just drive,\u201d Darcy told him.</p><p>She looked straight ahead as well. To her amazement, Mike slammed his Chevy\u2019s tank side right against the Volvo.</p><p>She was wearing her seat belt; still, she slammed against Josh. Amazed, she straightened as Josh deftly maneuvered to keep the car on the road.</p><p>\u201cJosh, I\u2019m so sorry!\u201d she gasped, real fear starting to trickle down her spine. She\u2019d known that Mike could be a real jerk. She hadn\u2019t known that he could be this insane. She stared furiously over at the Chevy, still driving neck-and-neck with them.</p><p>The problem with small-town Pennsylvania, of course, could be the roads. Miles and miles of them in almost total darkness, with no one around for help.</p><p>Mike knew that. She could tell the minute she saw the grin on his face.</p><p>Then, to her great dismay, she saw that Hunter was sitting next to him, in the passenger\u2019s seat.</p><p>She rolled her window down. Surely, Josh\u2019s father was going to have a fit about the car. And someone was going to wind up really hurt.</p><p>\u201cStop it! You idiots!\u201d she shouted.</p><p>\u201cAh, come on, you want to play with the geeks?\u201d Mike called back.</p><p>Wind was racing by them. Darcy was afraid her voice wouldn\u2019t carry. \u201cHunter! Make him stop this, now!\u201d</p><p>Hunter leaned forward and she saw his face. He was as white as a ghost. \u201cDarcy, I\u2019m trying!\u201d</p><p>Mike laughed and slammed the car again. Darcy heard the terrible screech of metal against metal.</p><p>\u201cStop! We\u2019ll just stop, Josh,\u201d she said. \u201cHunter won\u2019t let Mike hurt you. He\u2019s still sober, I can see.\u201d</p><p>Just as she finished speaking, the Chevy began to veer insanely. She grabbed hold of her seat with a death grip as the Volvo veered accordingly. There was a split second in which she saw Hunter trying to seize the Chevy\u2019s steering wheel.</p><p>Then it all went out of control. The Chevy jackknifed with a roaring vengeance against the nose of the Volvo. Then it flipped, and rolled over and over in front of them. Josh pumped the brakes, but simple physics sent them flying into the body of the Chevy.</p><p>For a moment, Darcy felt the weightlessness of flight herself. An air bag suddenly exploded in her face. She felt a thud unlike anything she had ever known before, and the world suddenly turned to an absurd cartoon vision as stars in a field of black velvet swam before her eyes. Then, one by one, the stars twinkled out, and there was nothing but an ebony darkness.</p><p>Ashes to ashes.</p><p>Dust to dust.</p><p>Darcy attended Josh\u2019s funeral with blackened eyes and heavy bruises. They told her that it was only thanks to the integrity of Josh\u2019s Volvo that she was still alive.</p><p>Mike wouldn\u2019t be buried for another two days. Somehow, again miraculously, Hunter had survived as well. Darcy thought that she must still be in shock, unable to really absorb what had happened because, as she stood by Josh\u2019s grave site, supported on either side by her parents, she was able to look at Hunter. She could even think that, to his credit, he\u2019d had the balls to come here, and that he was weeping like an infant.</p><p>The accident had been a wake-up call for the entire school, she thought, for those who had shunned Josh for years had come. He might well have been amused, she thought. But again, every face showed shock and sorrow. Those who had thought themselves young and immortal had discovered that life was fragile and death could come at any time. Who, in their realm of experience, had ever imagined that taunting a nerd could come to such a tragic end?</p><p>Josh\u2019s father, grave, tall, ancient, and bowed, tenderly kissed the coffin, and laid a flower upon it. His grief seemed beyond tears, and still, when the last words of the priest had faded into the bizarre and beautiful blue beauty of the day, he came toward her. He managed a gentle smile, as if her pain could be as deep as his own, and reached for her hand. She took it, let him lead her to the coffin, where he offered her a flower to cast upon it.</p><p>It was a strange moment, for those who had attended seemed to want to come to him, to offer their condolences. Yet, he and Darcy stood in their own little world, and people hesitated, then let them be. Even Darcy\u2019s parents, loving, kind people, allowed them that moment.</p><p>They stood in silence for the longest time. Oddly, Darcy became aware of a bird chirping. At last, she found her voice. It was broken and trembling, but she managed the words she wanted. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. So, so, sorry. I\u2014I\u2019m responsible. That can\u2019t help you any, I know,\u201d she babbled. \u201cBut he was my friend, truly, my best friend, always there, and oh, God, I didn\u2019t know...I....\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d Josh\u2019s father said softly. \u201cDarcy, you did nothing wrong. It\u2019s never wrong to be a real friend. He loved you. Not romantically, of course. You didn\u2019t love him that way, either. But he knew you really, truly cared about him. You were a special person to him. Incredibly so.\u201d</p><p>She looked up at the old man who seemed bowed with sorrow, and yet so accepting. She offered him a teary, rueful smile. \u201cPlease, you\u2019re trying to comfort me. You\u2019ve lost your only child.\u201d</p><p>He looked back at her a long time. \u201cI always knew that I would,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cAnd still, what a fine, bright boy! The love we shared will remain in this old heart as long as it ticks. I was privileged to have him as long as I did. Remember this, those we love do live forever in our hearts. You\u2019ll remember his voice. The things he said that made you laugh. I can\u2019t explain this, but...Josh wasn\u2019t really for this world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe has gone to a far better place,\u201d she whispered, wincing at the way the words, sincerely meant, could sound so trite.</p><p>\u201cHe was different, Darcy. You must have known that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmart, sweet, wonderful,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Josh\u2019s father was still smiling. He reached into his wallet suddenly, producing a card. \u201cI doubt if I\u2019ll be around the old homestead here much anymore. Please, take this. If you ever need help, if you ever need to just talk, call me. Come see me. You have great folks of your own, Darcy. I know they\u2019ll help you through. But if you\u2019re ever confused, lost...call me. Remember that I am\u2014was\u2014his dad. I\u2019ll always be there for you. You were always there for my boy.\u201d He hesitated. \u201cAnd you may find that you need me. Remember this, please, I\u2019ll always be there.\u201d</p><p>He touched her head gently, then walked away, leaving her at the coffin. She stood there for several seconds, feeling the breeze touch her face, noting again the unbelievable blue of the sky. Down by the road, her parents were waiting. They would give her all the time she needed.</p><p>She saw that Hunter, leaning on his crutches, was waiting as well.</p><p>She didn\u2019t think that she could bear to talk to him.</p><p>She knelt down in the earth at the head of the coffin, suddenly overwhelmed with bitterness. \u201cOh, Josh, I will never speak to him again,\u201d she whispered softly, then shook her head. \u201cGod help me!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She closed her eyes. It seemed that Josh\u2019s voice entered her head. \u201cDarcy, hey, don\u2019t be so hard on Hunter. You know, he realized that Mike was being a homicidal jerk. He tried.\u201d</p><p>The voice was so real that her eyes flew open.</p><p>The day hadn\u2019t changed. The sky was still blue, the breeze still soft. The coffin still lay in the mechanism that would shortly bring it deep into the ground.</p> <p>Tears welled in her eyes again. She closed them tightly, and prayed. Then she rose, kissed the coffin, and murmured. \u201cJosh, I will never forget you. And like your dad said, you will always be in my heart. Always. If I live to be a hundred.\u201d</p><p>At last, she turned away. She started for the road where her parents, and Hunter, waited.</p><p>For a moment, the hate remained. She couldn\u2019t even look at Hunter. Then she remembered Josh\u2019s words, so real in her mind. Don\u2019t be so hard on Hunter.</p><p>He was still crying. She managed to walk to him and place a hand on his arm. \u201cYou tried,\u201d she said very softly.</p><p>\u201cOh, Darcy!\u201d he whispered sickly.</p> <p>\u201cYou tried,\u201d she repeated. \u201cOne day...one day, we can talk again.\u201d</p><p>Amazingly, she felt better. And she knew that Hunter had tried. She knew, too, that his leg would heal. His heart never would. He would live with the night in which Josh and Mike had died all of his life. And he would fight the guilt in his soul just as long.</p><p>Her mother was waiting with outstretched arms. Her father, too. She ran to them, and let them do all the right things they thought that they could do.</p><p>That night, her mother gave her a sleeping pill, since she hadn\u2019t really slept since the accident.</p><p>And it was the pill, she was convinced the following day, that caused her strange dreams.</p><p>She was back at the cemetery. It wasn\u2019t a blue day anymore. It wasn\u2019t exactly gray, either. It seemed that there was a cast of silver, like a mist, over the day. Time had passed, and she walked through the old gnarled trees, ancient graves, and newer ones, that composed the cemetery. Josh had been buried beneath a beautiful old oak. She walked toward it, clad in black, bearing a bouquet of flowers.</p> <p>And yet...</p><p>As she neared it, she saw a thin man standing by the old oak. Frowning, she came closer. And it was Josh.</p><p>He looked very handsome, dressed in the dark suit, tailored shirt, and crimson tie in which he had been buried. His dark hair was trimmed and brushed, as it had been for the prom. He was leaning against the tree, arms casually crossed, smiling as she came.</p><p>For a moment, she was afraid. Only a moment.</p><p>\u201cJosh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDarcy, poor Darcy,\u201d he said softly. His rueful smile reminded her of his father\u2019s when he had spoken to her over his son\u2019s coffin. \u201cDarcy, you\u2019ve got to know. It\u2019s okay. Honestly, it\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not okay, you\u2019re dead.\u201d She frowned, amazed to realize that she was a little angry with him. \u201cYou knew it, Josh! You knew you were going to die. The day that Mike threatened you...you said that maybe you\u2019d be dead, but he\u2019d be dead as well. And he is!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I\u2019m sorry. He was a true jerk, but I didn\u2019t really hate him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJosh\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got to go, Darcy. I just wanted you to know that I\u2019m okay. I\u2019m really okay. And you\u2019ve got to go on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will, Josh, but...I never knew how much I\u2019d miss you,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He touched her hair. Except that...he wasn\u2019t real, and of course, it was just a whisper of the breeze.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll always be with you, Darcy. When you need me, just think of me. Here.\u201d He laid his palm against his heart.</p><p>\u201cOh, Josh!\u201d</p><p>He was fading. Into the silver color of the day. Of course. It was a dream. A drug-induced dream.</p><p>He smiled. \u201cYou\u2019re special, Darcy. You\u2019ll need to be strong,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>And then he was gone.</p><p>It began the next day.</p><p>Her father had determined that he wasn\u2019t going into work; neither was her mother. They were going to spend the day with her, take a drive to the nearby mountains, and just spend time in that quite and beautiful part of their state.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t find his Palm Pilot.</p><p>\u201cYou left it on the counter of your bath,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cHow on earth would you know that? Were you in our room, sweetheart?\u201d her dad asked.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Darcy said, startled herself. \u201cI just...well, I guess it\u2019s a place you might have left it.\u201d</p><p>He went upstairs to his bathroom and returned with his Palm Pilot, looking at her oddly. \u201cThanks. I guess you know your old man pretty well, huh, kid?\u201d</p><p>Of course, that was it.</p><p>But then...</p><p>Little pieces of precognition began to come to her, now and then. A few that summer, a few during her first years of college, more after that.</p><p>They were disturbing at first. Then she came to accept them. She thought that they were maybe something that Josh had very strangely managed to leave her.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until later that she decided it was time to call Josh\u2019s father.</p><p>When the ghosts came.</p><p>Chapter 1</p><p>1</p><p>J eannie Mason Thomas lay in the white expanse of the four-poster bed in the Lee room at Melody House in pure bliss.</p><p>Roger was snoring softly at her side. Men, she thought affectionately. Bless \u2019em. Whatever came, they could sleep.</p><p>She could not. She had to keep playing over the day, minute by minute. Her wedding day.</p><p>There had been the usual hassles in the morning. Her mom had gotten all teary every few minutes, and insisted on giving speeches about sex and marriage that were totally unnecessary. Alice, her matron of honor, had clipped off two of her newly purchased acrylic nails trying to fix Jeannie\u2019s train. Sandy, another bridesmaid, had gotten too looped on the champagne they had shared while dressing for the service. The limo had been late. Her original soprano had come down with a sore throat leaving Jeannie desperately seeking a new singer at the last minute. But she\u2019d managed to find an Irish tenor through the priest, Father O\u2019Hara, and once she had reached the Revolution-era church just outside town, everything had gone perfectly.</p><p>Everyone claimed that it had been one of the most beautiful weddings they had ever seen. Roger had been tall, dark, and glorious in his tux. Her father had been stately, her mother beautiful. Her brother and sister, both part of the wedding ceremony, had been well behaved, joking, laughing, and wonderful. Her first dance with her new husband had been magical, but it was during her dance with her father that she had realized she was one of the luckiest human beings in the world with a tender, tight family, and an incredible groom.</p><p>The reception would be the talk of a number of counties for months to come. The Irish tenor had joined with the band. The music had gone from classical to rock and pop to theatrical. The food had been delicious, the cake stupendous.</p><p>Then, after fully enjoying their own reception, they had taken off at last for Melody House. And it hadn\u2019t been as if making love had been anything new for them, but making love as man and wife was new and therefore, somehow, more sensual, more erotic, and so deeply satisfying. They\u2019d been hot and heavy, they\u2019d laughed, they\u2019d joked over getting out of clothing, slipping in the shower in their haste, rolling off the bed, and all sorts of little foibles. They\u2019d had a great deal more champagne, finishing the bottle that had been left in the elegant little silver bucket on the antique table set before the fireplace. They\u2019d dined on the delicious little snacks left for them, caviar, quiches, chocolate-dipped strawberries and more. Then they\u2019d made love again, all lazy and slow, and it had been incredibly luxurious as well. Melody House had offered everything they had wanted. In the morning, they could go downstairs and be served breakfast in the sunny little nook off the kitchen. They could spend a day indulging in the heated pool\u2014a recent addition to the colonial manor. They could ride the trails that meandered through miles of forest when the sun was just setting. They could have both privacy and service. Jeannie had every right to be entirely blissful, and also, patient with the fact that her new husband could sleep, while she could not.</p><p>She rose, feeling as agile and luxuriously sinuous as a cat, naked in the coolness of the night. She stretched, thinking that the strenuous exercise program she had put herself through before the wedding had been well worth it\u2014she didn\u2019t think that she could be more than five percent body fat at the moment, and Roger had been delighted. She was glad, too, because she liked to think that she had talked Matt Stone into allowing them to use the seldom-rented room for their wedding night because she had just been cute and charming. Stone was known to be something of a hard-ass.</p><p>Walking over to the open French doors that led to the balcony, Jeannie almost pouted, then grinned instead. Roger had told her that Matt Stone had given in just because he knew the only way to keep Melody House as a private property had been to allow the house itself to earn some of the upkeep money such an estate so desperately needed. Roger had probably been right. But then again, maybe it had been a combination of Stone\u2019s needs and her charm and persuasion. Whatever! It had all worked, and it had come together so beautifully. She was a lover of history, and to spend her wedding night in such an elegant and historic place was like the most delicious icing in the world on the most wonderful cake\u2014her perfect wedding day. She parted the draperies, glad to feel the breeze against her bare shin, and feeling sensual all over again as it touched her. She was married now. She was Mrs. Thomas. She could slink right on back over to the bed, wake up her slight snoring husband, and live out her every fantasy.</p><p>Yet...</p><p>Suddenly, the delicious feeling wasn\u2019t quite so delicious anymore. She felt a sudden, quick, bone-numbing chill. She spun around, and saw nothing in the dim night-light pouring out from the bathroom, or even from the faint glow of moonlight and property lights that seeped in from the open French doors to the balcony, just hemmed in by the drifting draperies where she stood.</p><p>She felt...</p><p>Fear. Deep and irrational.</p><p>She swallowed, stepping over to close the French doors and lock them tightly. She glanced at Roger. He kept snoring. She tried to calm herself. If she was feeling a sudden and totally irrational fear, all she had to do was run back to the bed, jump in beside him, and he would cuddle and hold her and everything would be all right. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>That was exactly what she was going to do.</p><p>But she didn\u2019t. She didn\u2019t move. Because she saw...</p><p>The silvery movement in the night.</p> <p>She blinked, but it didn\u2019t go away. And it wasn\u2019t the darkness, or the reflection of the lights, or a combination of the two. It was something, vague in shape, silvery-white, hovering, moving. It came from the side of the bed, where she should have been sleeping, and it was coming toward her.</p><p>She panicked totally. Her vocal cords were frozen. She stared, breathing out desperate little choking sounds, since she could find no voice. It came closer and closer. She felt ice trickles into blood and limbs and then...</p><p>It was almost touching her. She felt her hair move...pulled? Cold seemed to slap her right across the face. And she could have sworn that she heard a whisper, mocking, scornful. \u201cSilly little girl! He\u2019ll only kill you!\u201d</p><p>Then again...her hair...lifting. On its own, in the grip of the vague, silvery-white substance. A substance that whispered or played havoc with the breeze. There was no breeze. She had closed the doors.</p><p>At last, she found voice, movement, and energy. She let out an hysterical, chilling scream, and ran.</p> <p>She didn\u2019t run for the bed and Roger\u2014she headed straight for the door out of the Lee room. Jeannie wrenched at the knob so hard she nearly ripped it from the wood. The door itself flew open, and banged wickedly against the wall. This had no bearing on her. She barely heard it. She kept screaming, tore along the landing, and down the elegant, curving masterpiece of a stairway to the ground level below.</p><p>Matt Stone had chosen to stay in the caretaker\u2019s cottage, fifty yards to the left of the main house. It had been his home for years before his grandfather had died, leaving Melody House\u2014and the responsibility for its upkeep\u2014to him. He had only moved into the main house recently because it had become easier on the upkeep side, and, he had to admit, he had come to like it. The grand master suite he had chosen afforded a lot of comfort. Big bedroom, dressing room, office or entertainment space, and it kept him right on top of whatever was going on with the property.</p><p>He liked the caretaker\u2019s cottage, too. Since it had been falling apart so badly due to years of neglect he had rebuilt and refurbished it with every modern convenience. In contrast to the painstaking care they had used in keeping the main house historical, the caretaker\u2019s house was far more state-of-the-art.</p><p>When he had given in to allowing the Lee room to be used as a honeymoon suite, he had opted to spend the night in his old haunts.</p><p>He had been sound asleep, however, when the scream brought him bolting from bed.</p><p>Despite the quiet tone of their small town, as sheriff of Stoneyville he was accustomed to being awakened in the dead of night. Therefore, he was up, into his jeans, and streaking across the patch of lawn that separated the caretaker\u2019s cottage from the main house in a matter of seconds, the key to the huge oak front door in his hands. He burst into the house less than two minutes from the time he had heard the scream.</p> <p>There was a light on in the foyer; there always was. Just as soft lights eternally flooded the front porch. He was prepared for anything when he burst through the door.</p><p>Or, at least, he had thought that he was.</p><p>Maybe not.</p><p>There was no apparent danger. Instead, there she was, the blushing bride, standing at the foot of the stairway, shaking and screaming in her altogether. Jeannie was a pretty girl, perfectly toned from months industriously spent at the gym in order to look perfect for her wedding day. Hard not to look, but he forced his eyes to hers first, then cast his gaze anxiously around, scanning the area for any hidden threat that might be the reason for this scene. Seeing nothing, his mind working in milliseconds, he wondered if the groom had somehow turned out to be a homicidal maniac or a simple wife-beater. Either choice seemed doubtful.</p><p>\u201cJeannie?\u201d he said, his voice deep with calm and authority. Normally, he would have walked to her, set an arm around her shoulder, and patiently determined the cause of her distress. But she was standing in his foyer stark naked and screaming. \u201cJeannie, please, talk. What the hell...?\u201d</p><p>By that time, her husband was rushing down the stairs as well. He was still half-asleep, and Matt would have sworn in any court that the young man appeared as bleary and stunned as anyone could possibly be. Certainly not fresh from a fight with his new bride.</p><p>\u201cJeannie!\u201d Roger cried out in shock.</p><p>Matt crossed over one of the velvet cord barriers into the parlor and swept an antique throw from the fragile old love seat, striding across the room to cast it around Jeannie\u2019s shoulders. She had stopped screaming, but she was still shaking like a leaf, eyes wide, dilated.</p> <p>Roger, still dazed, and definitely horrified, thanked him briefly. Then he stared at his bride again, confusion once again reigning in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cJeannie, what is it?\u201d</p><p>At last, she turned to focus on him, her expression blank at first, then filled with tension. \u201cYou didn\u2019t see it? You didn\u2019t feel it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJeannie, I was sound asleep! What are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>By then, Penny Sawyer, in a terry robe, her graying hair frizzled around her handsomely constructed face, arrived. She stood in the frame of the front door, left open when Matt had come bursting in.</p><p>\u201cWhat in the Lord\u2019s name...?\u201d she queried.</p><p>Penny managed Melody House. She kept accounts, and ran the tours. She loved the place, probably more so than Matt himself. She had worked as an historian for Matt\u2019s grandfather, and slipped right into the role of managing the place after his death. She was like an aunt to Matt, as well as being incredibly efficient, and all but married to the place.</p><p>There was only one area in which they disagreed. And Matt silently grit his teeth then, certain that this episode was about to lead in that direction.</p><p>\u201cApparently, our bride has had a nightmare,\u201d Matt said quietly.</p><p>\u201cNightmare!\u201d Jeannie shrieked. She must have heard the shrill tone of her own voice because she fought to control it. \u201cI wasn\u2019t sleeping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what exactly was the problem?\u201d Roger asked, an underlying irritation rising beneath his concerned exterior.</p><p>\u201cI think I should get some brandy,\u201d Penny said.</p><p>\u201cI think Jeannie should get some clothes on!\u201d Roger said, his anger starting to crack through.</p><p>\u201cClothes?\u201d Jeannie said. She stared down at herself and realized that she was covered in nothing but the antique quilt.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make tea with brandy,\u201d Penny said decisively.</p><p>\u201cWhile she\u2019s making the tea, Jeannie, you can run up and get dressed. Then we can all sit down and you can explain just what you\u2019re doing,\u201d Roger said, a thread of anger in his voice.</p><p>\u201cWhat I\u2019m doing?\u201d Jeannie repeated, frowning. \u201cRoger Thomas, I was scared to death, don\u2019t you understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cScared enough to run around naked?\u201d</p><p>Matt could have groaned aloud. He shouldn\u2019t have been swayed to allow the Lee Room to become a honeymoon hang out. He glared at Penny. She had talked him into it, reminding him that they needed the money for Melody House.</p><p>Penny shrugged innocently, giving him one of her knowing looks.</p><p>Melody House was reputed to be haunted. Matt always saw the rumors as simply par for the course. The main house was well over two hundred years old. It had survived the American Revolution, the Civil War, and every manner of conflict in between. As he well knew, nothing that old went without a certain kind of history. And apparently, most of the world wanted to believe in things that went bump in the night. People couldn\u2019t just look back on the personal tragedies of the past with sorrow\u2014they just had to make something else out of them.</p><p>Matt simply didn\u2019t believe in ghosts. He\u2019d worked in the D.C. area long before he\u2019d taken up working in his old home haunts, and he knew that the things that living men and women did to one another could be so violent, barbarous, and cruel, that there was simply no reason to worry about those who were long dead and buried.</p><p>\u201cGo up and put clothes on!\u201d Roger said, his voice almost a roar.</p><p>Jeannie, blue eyes still huge, stared at him in rebellion and defiance.</p><p>\u201cI am not\u2014get this straight!\u2014not going back up to that room. Ever! There is a ghost up there, and it\u2014it threatened me.\u201d</p><p>Matt shook his head, praying for patience. He looked up at the bride and groom. Wow! How quickly there was trouble in Paradise.</p><p>\u201cJeannie,\u201d he said patiently, \u201cthere are no such things as ghosts. Hey, I\u2019ve lived here most of my life. I\u2019ve spent nights in the place with no electricity, you know, in the pitch dark. I swear, there are no ghosts. I would know.\u201d</p><p>He had tried to say the last lightly. He knew, however, that his voice had an edge. He was sick to death of the whole ghost thing.</p><p>\u201cLook what you\u2019ve done,\u201d Roger said to Jeannie. \u201cGreat. Really good honeymoon we\u2019re going to have here\u2014you\u2019ve just really pissed off Matt Stone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, I\u2019m not angry,\u201d Matt said quickly. \u201cI just don\u2019t believe in ghosts. Jeannie, it was a big day for you. I\u2019m sure for you both...I\u2019m not saying that anyone is totally inebriated, but come on, now, you both had a hell of a lot to drink. You\u2019re wired, Jeannie. Excited. Hey, it was the wedding of the century, huh? You don\u2019t have to go back into the room. We\u2019ll get your things. And you and Roger can finish out your honeymoon in the caretaker\u2019s cottage, how\u2019s that? I can clear it out in a matter of minutes, while Penny makes tea.\u201d</p><p>Jeannie spun around again. She looked as if she wanted to run from Roger\u2019s side and come flying into his arms.</p><p>Don\u2019t do it, Jeannie, don\u2019t do it! He pleaded silently.</p><p>\u201cNot one of you has suggested coming up to see if there is something in the room,\u201d Jeannie said indignantly.</p><p>Matt lifted his hands. \u201cI\u2019ll go up to the room.\u201d</p><p>He strode past the newlywed couple on the stairs. As he neared the upper landing, he could hear Roger whispering angrily to his wife. \u201cGhost, hell! You\u2019re a little exhibitionist. You\u2019ve had a bit of a thing for Matt Stone your whole life, you know, Jeannie. What, you just had to have an excuse for him to see you naked?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cRoger Thomas! How dare you suggest such a thing, you bastard!\u201d she whispered back. Then her voice rose. \u201cWe don\u2019t need the caretaker\u2019s house! I\u2019m going home. Home\u2014back to my family. They\u2019re not a bunch of idiot jerks!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, there!\u201d Penny protested cheerfully. \u201cYou know, everyone is really tired, but we\u2019ll get to the bottom of this. Matt, he\u2019s all he-man practical and doesn\u2019t believe in ghosts, but I\u2019m telling you, Roger, don\u2019t you go being hard on your new missus! Lots of folks believe that this house is more than a little haunted, I do tell you!\u201d</p><p>Matt walked on into the Lee Room. As he suspected, there was nothing there. The French doors to the balcony were open, and the drapes were drifting in. They must have been what scared the new bride so badly. Either that, or she just wanted the place to be haunted so badly that she had made it so.</p> <p>He found Jeannie\u2019s peignoir robe, then discarded it as being far too see-through for this situation. Her groom would not be happy with it, he was certain. Striding to the closet, he found a pair of robes with \u201cMelody House\u201d inscribed on the pockets\u2014items Penny had insisted they needed to provide a real luxury touch for those few times when he decided to rent the room. He pulled one from the hanger and headed back downstairs.</p><p>By then, Penny, Jeannie and Roger had headed into the kitchen. It was vast. The integrity of the historical aspects had been maintained with the massive hearth and the many copper pots and herbs that adorned wall mounts, but the huge refrigerator, sub-zero freezer, and stainless steel stove were all necessary modern conveniences for the many social events, dinners, luncheons, and meetings that were held at the property.</p><p>The newlyweds were seated at the table with Penny. She had apparently moved like lightning, microwaving water and hurriedly supplying brandy, because they were all sipping out of huge earthenware mugs already.</p><p>They had been joined there by several of the other residents of the property, probably all awakened by the screaming. Matt\u2019s cousin Clint, who, like Penny, lived in one of the apartments above the stables, was seated at the table. Clint\u2019s eyes flashed with humor as they met Matt\u2019s. Sam Arden, the caretaker, old, thin, and crusty, his white hair wild, was at the table as well. He shook his head and rolled his eyes when he saw Matt. Rounding out the group was Carter Sutton. He was actually an old college friend of Clint\u2019s from the next town over. He owned a lot of local property, and had just bought a house nearby. Since it was still being held hostage by construction workers, he\u2019d taken a room over the stables as well. It worked well. Carter made his living off his investments, and was sometimes \u201cpaper rich and cash poor,\u201d so he was happy to look after the horses and serve as stable boy and trail guide when they rented out the horses.</p><p>Matt silently offered the robe, and walked around to take a seat at the end of the table. Penny was happily talking about ghosts. Roger was convincing his wife that there had been nothing there at all, other than the excitement of the day.</p> <p>\u201cAnd if there was a ghost, it was probably more scared than you,\u201d Clint assured the bride.</p><p>\u201cHell, there are ghosts,\u201d Sam said sagely, nodding his old head.</p><p>\u201cSam,\u201d Matt protested.</p><p>\u201cShe meant to hurt me!\u201d Jeannie said with certainty.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think that ghosts are supposed to hurt people,\u201d Carter said. His mustache twitched. He was as bearded as a goat, since he enjoyed a high military position in the \u201cRebel\u201d unit in which he participated in many battle reenactments.</p><p>\u201cShe meant to hurt me,\u201d Jeannie repeated.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve slept in that room,\u201d Clint said, \u201cand honestly, nothing ever happened to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know the Lee Room like the back of my hand,\u201d Carter teased. \u201cIt holds the fondest memories in my heart,\u201d he told the bride with a wink.</p><p>She flushed and laughed uneasily.</p><p>\u201cMatt,\u201d Penny said, \u201cThere\u2019s a cup of strong tea for you right there, end of the table.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll reheat it in a bit. I\u2019m going to get a few things out of the caretaker\u2019s cottage, so you two can slip on over when you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Mr. Stone, I...I don\u2019t want to put you to any more trouble,\u201d Roger said.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t sleep in this house!\u201d Jeannie wailed.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s no trouble,\u201d he assured them both.</p> <p>All he wanted to do right then was get out\u2014he didn\u2019t think he could bear to hear another of Penny\u2019s speeches on ghosts. He allowed her, on Friday and Saturday nights, to give a \u201cLegends of Melody House\u201d tour, during which she liked to go on and on about various stories involving the house, and how it was rumored to be haunted by different characters, including historical figures.</p><p>He had adamantly refused to let her call it a ghost tour. But since she did attract dozens and dozens of paying tourists, people staying as diversely far away as Williamsburg, Richmond, Harpers Ferry, and even D.C., he had to allow the endeavor. She served cider, tea, cookies, and pastries in the middle of the tour, and he knew that she was right\u2014they paid a whole lot of bills thanks to those tours. He still didn\u2019t like them, or anything that suggested that Melody House was really haunted. However, he tolerated it all, for the sake of the house.</p><p>\u201cGo on, Matt\u2014we\u2019ll keep them entertained for you,\u201d Clint told him laconically. Matt arched a brow. Clint could be openly lascivious. He had surely enjoyed the spectacle of the bride, wrapped in the antique quilt and nothing more.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Matt said dryly, and left them all to their arguments on whether there was or wasn\u2019t a ghost.</p><p>An hour later, he was moved back into his room at the main house, and he and Penny and Roger had packed up the newlyweds, who were now happily settled in the caretaker\u2019s cottage. Penny returned to her apartment over the stables.</p><p>Matt had barely gotten back to sleep before he heard a ringing sound. He fumbled around to turn off his alarm, but it was the phone instead. One of his officers was on the other end, anxiously urging him to get moving; they had a domestic violence situation threatening to turn explosive.</p><p>Matt hurriedly dressed, his thoughts half on the night gone by, and half on the day to come. There it was\u2014the truth again. As his dad had once told him, when he had shivered at the sight of an old cemetery, the dead were the safest people around.</p><p>It was the living you had to watch out for.</p><p>That day was hell for Matt. He was so tired most of it, he could have toppled over. It began with the situation at the Creek-more house, old Harry threatening to kill his wife and kids, accusing her of sleeping around, claiming he didn\u2019t even know if the kids were really his or not. Thayer had kept the situation under control until he got there. Matt had managed first to get Harry to let him in, then pretended to share most of a bottle of whiskey with him, convince him he could do DNA testing on his kids, finally get the shotgun, and haul Harry off to jail.</p><p>Somehow, he endured the rest of the week, staying in the main house, hearing the honeymooners in the pool at all hours, day and night.</p><p>Jeannie came to thank him personally for not throwing them out. Her honeymoon, between the pool and the horses and the incredible Jacuzzi in the caretaker\u2019s house, was bliss.</p><p>She had forgotten about the ghost. She admitted that she\u2019d had a lot to drink.</p><p>Penny kept insisting that there was a ghost, and he was being a blind fool to ignore it. Either something bad was going to happen, or\u2014on the bright side!\u2014were they to prove that a ghost existed, they could get so rich they\u2019d never have to worry about the upkeep of the place again.</p><p>Finally the honeymooners departed and everything went back to normal. Then, Penny started at him again. She wanted to have a seance.</p><p>He said no.</p><p>She persisted.</p><p>He begged her to leave him alone. He had too much work on his plate at the moment.</p><p>At last, Penny backed off and contented herself with her tours. Matt thought that life was pleasantly back to routine.</p><p>Until she came to him with the letter from Adam Harrison, Harrison Investigations.</p><p>It was a month later that Clara Issy, one of the five daytime housekeepers, stopped dead in her tracks.</p><p>It was a sunny morning. The beautiful old bedroom in Melody House was as it always was. The bed she had just made with its shiny four-poster and quilted cover sat against the right wall. The polished mahogany bureau held the modern touch of the entertainment center within it. The television was off. The French doors to the balcony and the wraparound porch were ajar because it was such a nice day and the breeze was fresh and clean, causing the white draperies to stir and dance. That was natural, and she was accustomed to the smell and feel of fresh air. She loved it, and she wasn\u2019t at all fond of the air-conditioning that ran through the summer months. No, the room itself was just as it always was.</p><p>She stood near the open French doors, jaw agape, and stared.</p><p>Because she was alone in the room, yet something else was moving. Something that drifted from the bed. Something in a hazy form, something cold, something that felt threatening.</p><p>It approached Clara. She felt something touch her face, almost like the stroke of fingers against her cheek. Very cold fingers. Dead fingers. She thought she heard a whispering. Scratchy, against her ear. Something that pleaded...or threatened.</p><p>Her hands were frozen in a vise around her broom handle. Her body felt as if it had jelled into ice. Fear raced up and down her spine.</p><p>The cold...wrapped around her. Tightly. More and more tightly.</p><p>At last, her jaw snapped shut. She broke the sensation of terror. She screamed, not a bloodcurdling sound, but one that barely held a gasp of air.</p><p>Then she found life, and ran.</p><p>Out to the second floor landing; there was no one there. Down the flight of stairs to the grand foyer, where again, the house was empty. She headed toward the second doorway to the right of the sweeping stairway. Surely, for the love of God, someone would be in the house office\u2014Penny, a tiny bastion against anyone evil, but someone, at the least.</p><p>Clara breathed a sigh of relief. Matt was there. Bursting out the doorway before she could reach it. He was in his work uniform, but he hadn\u2019t headed out for the station yet; it was still very early. Thank God. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He hurried toward her, as if he had heard her cry\u2014being Matt, of course, he had heard it!\u2014and had been preparing to rush to her rescue. Except that she had fled the room upstairs with greater speed than a greyhound. And so she was here, spurting into his arms.</p><p>\u201cClara! What is it?\u201d</p><p>She was fifty-five. Twenty years older than Matt, at least. But he was Matt; solid as a rock. A tall man in his prime with a way about him that commanded respect which in turn offered her a feeling of security that allowed her to speak when her mouth was still all but completely contorted.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2014I\u2014quit!\u201d she gasped out.</p><p>\u201cClara, what on earth?\u201d he asked kindly, holding her at something of a distance from himself and searching out her eyes.</p><p>\u201cLet me tell you, that bride was not crazy. There\u2019s a ghost in that room!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Clara, please. We both know the silly stories about this place! We\u2019ve both heard them since we were little kids. But come on, we\u2019ve also worked in this house, both of us, for years and years. Clara, I feel like a broken record here, but believe me\u2014ghosts don\u2019t really exist. People want them to exist sometimes. Penny is dying to have a few authentic ghosts to give the place a greater reputation. Seems like being an historical mas terpiece doesn\u2019t always cut it these days.\u201d He smiled, smoothing back her graying hair.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a ghost in the Lee room, and it just touched me.\u201d Clara planted her hands on her hips. \u201cHow long have you known me? Forever? Haven\u2019t I always agreed with you, saying that it was just silly airheads who felt they had to make up ghost stories? But you have to believe me\u2014there\u2019s something in that room. It threatened me. Matt, it wasn\u2019t my imagination. It wasn\u2019t a memory of ghost tales told over and over. It was real. I could see it. Come up and see for yourself!\u201d</p> <p>Matt sighed deeply. Still, there was concern for her in the depths of his dark eyes. \u201cAll right, Clara, let\u2019s go take a look.\u201d</p><p>Clara edged behind him, then followed as he left the office and strode with long footsteps through the foyer, up the stairs, and to the Lee room.</p><p>Naturally, there was nothing there.</p><p>Clara walked over to her broom. \u201cI was standing right here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClara, maybe you saw the draperies drifting in. The French doors are open.\u201d</p><p>Clara indignantly straightened her five-foot-one frame. She could see that Matt felt as if he was living a repeat of a silly performance. He was trying to be patient; he felt like throwing his hands up as if the whole world had now gone insane. \u201cI know the difference between drapes and a ghost!\u201d</p> <p>Matt ran his fingers through his ink dark hair, shaking his head. \u201cClara...I don\u2019t know what to say. There\u2019s nothing here at all.\u201d</p><p>Clara sniffed. \u201cMatt, it\u2019s gone now. But there was something here! Why can\u2019t you believe me? You should. It wasn\u2019t all that long ago that we rented the room to the Thomases. She came running out of the room in the middle of the night, stark naked, and screaming! All right, I wasn\u2019t here when it happened, but I sure heard all about it.\u201d Clara paused, biting her lip. \u201cOkay, I laughed like hell, I\u2019ll admit, but...Matt, there\u2019s something going on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClara, Jeannie Thomas herself said later that she\u2019d had a lot to drink that night. Her husband didn\u2019t see or hear a thing, and all it did was cause a big argument on the first night of their marriage. Clara, Jeannie drove me crazy and came here and specifically asked for this room, having heard that it was haunted. Don\u2019t you see? The bride wanted there to be a ghost, and so there was. History can be tragic, Clara. And there was some tragic history associated with the place. But come on, now! You\u2019re a sensible woman. In your heart, you know that you\u2019re just letting your imagination run riot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMatt, I quit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Clara!\u201d</p><p>She knew that he couldn\u2019t afford to lose another maid.</p><p>\u201cHow about this, Clara. You don\u2019t quit, but you don\u2019t clean this room. How\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>She reflected on his offer. \u201cWho is going to clean it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll let Penny come in here and take care of this room. Penny thinks it\u2019s the greatest thing in the world that the place has a reputation for being haunted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, Matt, I can\u2019t help it. I was definitely one of those to scoff at such absurdity, but I can tell you now\u2014this house is haunted!\u201d</p><p>\u201cClara, maybe it\u2019s haunted, and maybe...hm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe Penny is playing tricks, she wants the house to be haunted so badly. Or maybe someone is...I don\u2019t know. Breaking in here. Making things happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d Clara asked incredulously.</p><p>\u201cWho knows,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>Clara again planted her hands on her hips, her eyes narrowing. \u201cWho the hell would break in here? Who would have the balls\u2014since it\u2019s your place\u2014the town sheriff?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. But since you think there was someone in here, I intend to find out.\u201d</p><p>Clara shook her head. \u201cWe\u2019re the ones who have been lying to ourselves, Matt. The whole darned house may be haunted, but this room...this room is menacing!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGhosts don\u2019t menace people, Clara.\u201d</p><p>She sniffed. \u201cYou don\u2019t believe in ghosts, so how do you know what they do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cClara, I don\u2019t believe in ghosts, but from everything I\u2019ve seen and read, I\u2019ve never heard of a ghost actually hurting anyone.\u201d</p><p>Clara shook her head again, appearing to be the one wise beyond all earthly knowledge. \u201cWell, Mr. Matt, I\u2019ll have you know, that isn\u2019t true at all! Haven\u2019t you ever heard of the Bell Witch in Tennessee? They say that even old Andrew Jackson was afraid of her, that she pulled people\u2019s hair and threw the children around and even caused the death of the master of the house. You refuse to accept anything that isn\u2019t cut-and-dried, and you\u2019re blind to things going on in your own house!\u201d</p><p>Matt leaned against the door frame, smiling. \u201cClara, once again, I believe that people can make things real with their imaginations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think old Andy Jackson was an imaginative guy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d have to show me written proof that Andrew Jackson was afraid of a ghost. And I don\u2019t mean any hearsay on a Discovery program or even in a book of ghost stories.\u201d</p><p>Clara pointed a finger at him. \u201cYou\u2019d better do something, before the stories about this house become so real that no one will pay for the tours. You can\u2019t keep this place up on a sheriff\u2019s salary alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Clara. I\u2019ll take that under advisement. But then again, you know, Penny is certain that a documented haunting would make us as rich as Midas.\u201d</p><p>Clara was startled when Matt frowned suddenly and walked over to her. \u201cWhat happened to your face?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo my face?\u201d Clara frowned as well, and walked over to the mirror. Her cheek was red and mottled, as if she\u2019d been slapped, and slapped hard.</p><p>She turned and stared at him. \u201cGhosts don\u2019t menace people, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cClara,\u201d Matt said. \u201cThink about it! You must have run into something in your hurry to get out of the room!\u201d</p><p>Clara eyed him sharply and shook her head. \u201cMatt, the stories have circulated for years. People have sworn that they\u2019ve seen soldiers in the downstairs rooms. They\u2019ve seen a lady in white, floating down the stairway. Ghosts that fit in with history. It\u2019s only been in recent years, since your grandfather died, that things have gotten really serious. Remember how Randy Gustav quit after staying a night in the Lee Room? He wouldn\u2019t even explain what happened to you. It\u2019s only in the last few years that...that the ghosts kind of threaten to get violent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are no such things as ghosts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah? One just gave me a bruise!\u201d</p><p>With that, Clara indignantly walked out on him, calling back over her shoulder, \u201cMatt, you\u2019re a hell of a man. That\u2019s why I\u2019m staying. Believe it or don\u2019t, but you\u2019d better do something about that particular ghost\u2014that doesn\u2019t exist in your mind.\u201d</p><p>That evening, having returned home very late from work, Matt sat at the desk in his suite in the main house, going through correspondence.</p><p>There was a tap at his door.</p><p>\u201cCome in.\u201d</p><p>Penny stuck her head in. \u201cAm I bothering you, Matt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all.\u201d</p><p>She walked in and sat on the corner of his desk. \u201cMatt, you have to do something over this latest episode with Clara.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d He leaned back in his chair.</p><p>\u201cClara was hurt!\u201d</p><p>\u201cPenny, please. I\u2019m sorry, I think the world of Clara, we\u2019re friends from way back, and I gave her the rest of the day off with pay. She had to have run into something.\u201d</p><p>Penny shook her head.</p><p>He leaned forward suddenly, abruptly. \u201cPenny, you wouldn\u2019t be playing some kind of game up there, determined to convince the rest of the world, if not me, that the place is haunted?\u201d</p><p>She gaped at him in such affront that he was immediately sorry.</p><p>\u201cMatt, I would never\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut maybe someone would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d Penny agreed grudgingly. She wagged a finger at him. \u201cYou know, you are far too trusting at times. Too many people could have access to this place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPenny, I\u2019m not too trusting. We\u2019re a fairly small town.\u201d</p><p>Penny shook her head decisively. \u201cYou\u2019re right, of course. But you\u2019ve got to remember that even in our small town we have had a few pretty grisly murders. Why can\u2019t you just accept the fact that something strange is going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPenny, you\u2019ve wanted nothing more than a real ghost for years.\u201d</p><p>Penny shook her head, suddenly troubled. \u201cGhosts...that cause a cold spot, or breeze by, or...I don\u2019t think this is a good ghost,\u201d she murmured. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She patted his desk, rummaging through the unopened letters. \u201cWhat about that letter you got from Harrison Investigations? Call Adam. You respect him. He was friends with your grandfather long ago.\u201d</p><p>He groaned.</p><p>\u201cPlease, Matt. You\u2019ve suggested that maybe someone is breaking in, or doing something to make it appear that there are ghosts. Adam can tell you what\u2019s real, and what\u2019s not.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat he perceives as real,\u201d Matt muttered.</p><p>\u201cHey, I\u2019ve followed some of what he\u2019s done. Last year, he and some of his colleagues proved that the haunting of an old mining camp was nothing more than two modern prospectors digging for gold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. I call in Ghostbusters and become the laughingstock of the town. I might as well find a new place to live.\u201d</p><p>Penny shook her head. \u201cMatt, maybe they can just do the same thing here.\u201d She hopped off the edge of the table. \u201cPlease, promise me you\u2019ll think about it, at least.\u201d</p><p>She left him, closing the door softly in her wake.</p> <p>Matt walked to his own set of French doors out to the wraparound balcony. The moon was full. In the distance, he could see the vague shape of the mountains, and the sweep of the valley. God, he loved this area. Loved the house, the stables, but mostly, just the natural beauty of the area.</p><p>He returned to his desk, reflective. Clara\u2019s face had been marked, as if she had been hit. He still didn\u2019t believe in ghosts, but...</p><p>He reflected on the number of people who lived on the property. Penny, Sam, Clint, Carter, even Clara now and then, and through the years gone by, various friends and relatives. Could someone have set the place up so that it appeared haunted?</p><p>He strode to the Lee Room, searched under the bed, in the closet, all around. Nothing.</p><p>Still...</p><p>He returned to his own suite, toyed with Adam Harrison\u2019s letter for a moment, and picked up the phone. He dialed Harrison\u2019s number. They spoke briefly. \u201cMatt, good to hear from you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t certain that you would?\u201d Matt queried dryly.</p><p>\u201cNope. Not this time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know I don\u2019t believe in the supernatural in any way, shape, or form.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m aware of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you come down here, I\u2019m only having you because I think you\u2019ll be able to prove that I don\u2019t have ghosts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d Adam agreed.</p><p>\u201cWhen can you come?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy schedule is a bit of a mess, but...I\u2019ll arrange to see you soon.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd according to your letter, Adam, you\u2019re going to pay me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. And like I said, I am anxious. I\u2019ll arrange something as soon as possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can usually find me around lunchtime at the Wayside Inn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, my office manager will call, set a date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Matt said. \u201cLook forward to seeing you, Adam.\u201d</p><p>Adam Harrison was still talking when Matt hung up the phone. He stared at it, already thinking that he had made one hell of a mistake.</p><p>On the other end, Adam Harrison, too, stared at his phone. He did so with fond amusement. He\u2019d always liked Matt. \u201cMy boy. You\u2019re about to learn a lesson. All the courage, brain power, and brawn in the world can\u2019t cut it against a real ghost,\u201d he said softly. \u201cAh, well.\u201d</p><p>He had meant to warn Matt that he wasn\u2019t even sure he could come himself right away, that he\u2019d be sending his topnotch aide.</p><p>But he didn\u2019t want to call back. Matt Stone wasn\u2019t at all pleased with this arrangement, even though he was surely having trouble.</p><p>It would all be fine. Darcy could handle any man, living...</p><p>Or dead.</p><p>Chapter 2</p><p>2</p><p>F rom the moment she walked into the bar, Darcy felt at a distinct disadvantage.</p><p>It was called the Wayside Inn. It should have been called Bubba\u2019s Back-then Barn.</p><p>She was nearly overcome by the wave of smoke that almost knocked her over when she opened the door; it sat like a fog over the decades-old plastic booths and bar stools. There were two pool tables to the left, stuffed away from what might have been used, at times, as a dance floor.</p><p>There were actually still a few spittoons for tobacco chewers scattered around.</p><p>When she stepped in and the door closed behind her, the place came to a standstill. The four pool players and the broken-toothed wonders watching the games all stopped their play and stared at her. Behind the bar, a heavyset woman with teased red hair styled in something like a sixties beehive looked up from washing glasses. In what looked to be a dining area, the four men seated at one of the chipped wood tables also looked up.</p><p>She stood in the miasma of smoke and stared around, taking it in as her eyes adjusted from the sunlight. And she knew, instantly, that Adam was the one who should have come here. And he should have worn jeans and an old plaid or denim work shirt. Of course, the concept of Adam dressed that way was an amusing one, but Adam was a determined man. And for some reason, he was determined that they were getting into Melody House.</p><p>She had come in a business suit, the same attire she usually wore when conducting business, she reminded herself, defending her choice of clothing when she was so obviously out of place. But though she hadn\u2019t imagined the Wayside Inn to be a five-star restaurant, she hadn\u2019t thought that it would be quite this...colloquial.</p><p>\u201cCan I help you, honey?\u201d the redhead called from behind the bar. Her voice was warm and friendly, giving Darcy a bit of encouragement. She smiled in return. But before she could reply, one of the men who\u2019d been sitting at the table had risen.</p><p>\u201cMiss?\u201d</p><p>He was tall, somewhat lanky, and when he smiled, she saw that he had all his teeth, and a single dimple in his left cheek. Light brown eyes, and a pleasant way about him; he seemed to ooze accent and Southern charm with his single word.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m looking for a man named Matt Stone. I was supposed to meet him here.\u201d She hoped that one of the men knew Stone. She didn\u2019t think that he was among them. She\u2019d already pictured him in her mind. He was the descendant of a man who was practically a Founding Father. He would be tall, straight, and aging with incredible dignity. He might be one of the those fellows who sat around Revolutionary or Civil War round tables, rehashing the past. He might have a certain attitude about him, but he\u2019d still be an incredible old gentleman.</p><p>\u201cHey, honey, you can meet me!\u201d one of the pool players called out.</p><p>\u201cWatch your manners, Carter!\u201d one of the others said, and another sniggered.</p><p>At the table, another of the men stood.</p><p>\u201cCome in, have a seat,\u201d he said.</p><p>She had to admit, this fellow\u2019s jeans fit him well, hugging leans hips, strong legs, and some solid length. He was wearing shades, even inside, in the cloud of smoke\u2014maybe he thought that they\u2019d protect his eyes from the haze. He was well over six feet, ebony hair a little too long, but apparently clean and brushed. He was clean-shaven, maybe thirty, thirty-five. Strong, solid features. While the first fellow to approach her had been polite and laid-back, his face splitting instantly into an easy grin in the first few seconds, this one looked as if he might have been chiseled on Mount Rushmore. Though he had stood courteously enough and asked her to sit, he looked as if he were entirely impatient, more like a man about to suggest that she go jump in a lake.</p><p>She walked over to the table. The first man\u2014he with the great dimple\u2014had drawn out a chair for her. She looked at the other two who had been sitting at the table, now risen, as she approached. One was older, white-haired, white-bearded. She kept imagining him in a butternut and gray Confederate Army uniform. The fourth in the party was somewhere around thirty as well, had a decent haircut, and was actually in a tailored shirt and chinos, and looked as if he might have a real job somewhere in a civilized town.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your business here?\u201d the tall, chiseled-face man asked abruptly, sitting as he did so. They all stared at her.</p><p>\u201cMy name is Darcy Tremayne. I had an appointment with Matt Stone. I was supposed to meet him here. I believe I\u2019m in the right place. Do any of you know him?\u201d</p><p>She spoke evenly and politely\u2014she was here on business. But she felt as if hostility oozed around her. She longed to bolt from the chair and fly out the door. She knew that everyone in the bar was still staring at her.</p><p>\u201cKnow him?\u201d the tall, lanky fellow with the dimple said.</p><p>But he was interrupted. The man Darcy had mentally begun to refer to as Chisel-face cut him off. \u201cAre you one of the psychics?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Darcy arched a brow. Be pleasant with the locals, Adam had told her.</p><p>All right, she could be friendly.</p><p>\u201cI suppose you could say that. I\u2019m with Harrison Investigations,\u201d she said. This was definitely a small town. Okay, so she had come from a fairly small town herself, but this one seemed even more rural. Maybe that was because she\u2019d spent so many years in New York, and had been living in the D.C. area for so long now. It seemed that any event regarding Melody House was news in the area, and that everyone knew everyone else\u2019s business.</p><p>\u201cA real live ghost buster?\u201d the fellow with the dimple teased.</p><p>\u201cGhost buster?\u201d She ever so slightly hiked a brow once again, sitting back, determined that she would be cool, cordial, and dignified. \u201cHarrison Investigations is actually a small, private company, and what we do is investigate strange occurrences in old homes and the like.\u201d She smiled. \u201cMost of the time, we find squeaky floorboards and leaky plumbing, but when a place is as historically relevant as Melody House, the history alone could create a very old and spiritual feeling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMelody House is pretty damned cool,\u201d the dimpled man said, flashing another warm smile.</p><p>The old white-haired codger spoke up. \u201cMs. Tremayne, lots of folks have come wanting to set up cameras, tape machines, and all kinds of hocus-pocus stuff at Melody House. The owner has just flat-out told them no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, well, that\u2019s why I\u2019m anxious to meet Matt Stone. Mr. Harrison and he are well acquainted. Mr. Stone respects my employer, and knows that we\u2019re not sensationalist in any way. We know history and architecture, and people, and naturally, we\u2019re very discreet. I can understand any hesitation Mr. Stone has had in the past. I\u2019m sure that many people come ready to cash in on the ghosts.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI see,\u201d interrupted Chisel-face. \u201cYou\u2019re here to investigate some of the eerie stories associated with the house, but you\u2019re not trying to cash in on ghosts?\u201d His voice was deep, the words were evenly spoken; somehow, they still dripped scorn.</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019ve just explained. We\u2019re investigators.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm,\u201d Chisel-face murmured. He stared at her hard. \u201cYou said that most of the time what you discovered was creaky floorboards or leaky plumping. What happens when it\u2019s not \u2018most of the time\u2019?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe do our best to right matters,\u201d she said, wishing that she\u2019d never gotten into the conversation.</p><p>\u201cAnd how do you do that? Without, of course, making a bid to fascinate people\u2014or cash in on the ghosts.\u201d</p><p>She hesitated. She didn\u2019t really need to be having this conversation with a skeptic; she was looking for Matt Stone. But they were indeed in a small town. And Adam had suggested that she do her best to get along with the locals. In such a place, they were usually full of information, and could be very helpful. She shrugged. Adam wanted it; she could try to be social.</p><p>\u201cSome ghosts are actually a part of history, and it\u2019s the history that creates the legends that make them so fascinating to people. Some home owners and even corporations\u2014especially those with places as significant as Melody House\u2014want to have a resident ghost rapping on walls now and then to attract their clientele. Watch television, and you\u2019ll know that there\u2019s a huge population out there interested in being frightened. What we do is find out first if there actually is any inexplicable phenomena\u2014or if someone is merely playing games. If there is something beyond the ordinary, we find out why, and deal with it from that point,\u201d Darcy said, staring at the man, and returning all the attitude she was being given. Adam Harrison had already spoken with Matt Stone, and apparently, done so with enough dignity that he had agreed to the meeting. Actually, Stone had called Adam, after receiving his letter. And whether or not Stone wanted his property turned into a national center for the occult, he apparently could use the exorbitant fee that Adam had been willing to pay for his team to investigate the stories circulating about the house. She knew historic mansions were incredibly hard to maintain. Especially when they were being held privately. She was suddenly angry with herself for having been intimidated by the good old boys in the bar. Hell. She\u2019d spent enough years in a very similar environment, and that should have prepared her to deal with any form of male that pretended to walk on two feet. She had also dealt with her fair share of total, mocking skeptics. Usually, no manner of behavior bothered her. She had her beliefs, and everyone else in the world was welcome to their own. People who really wanted help usually came and asked for it.</p><p>She\u2019d been social enough, she decided.</p> <p>\u201cExcuse me, gentlemen, but my employer has already been in contact with Mr. Stone, and apparently, he is willing to allow us into Melody House. I\u2019ll make arrangements to meet him at a later date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you,\u201d Dimple-face said suddenly. He offered her his lazy smile once again. \u201cI could swear I\u2019ve seen your face before.\u201d</p><p>Darcy hesitated. All she needed to do was tell this pack that she\u2019d been a model for a cosmetics company for several years during and right after college and they\u2019d never take her seriously. But then again, what the hell did she care? Her business was with Stone.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure we\u2019ve never met,\u201d she murmured politely. \u201cThank you for your time. And excuse me.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019Original Sin\u2019!\u201d Dimple-face said triumphantly. He grinned sheepishly. \u201cI wound up buying the men\u2019s aftershave. Your face has been on billboards all over the country.\u201d</p><p>Even in Hicksville? she was tempted to say, and then she was angry with herself, because she\u2019d never felt that way about anything or anyone, her parents being really wonderful people who had taught her continually that people were people, didn\u2019t matter where they came from, and everyone in any corner of the country or even on the earth deserved an open mind and respect.</p> <p>\u201cSo...you\u2019re a model.\u201d</p><p>Chisel-face\u2019s statement might as well have been, So you\u2019re a dumb blonde with boobs. Except that she was more of a redhead and certainly not overly-stacked.</p><p>\u201cI worked for Original Sins cosmetics, yes,\u201d she said, again forcing her tone to be even. \u201cI also have graduate degrees in American history and sociology from NYU.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard that Adam Harrison would be coming here himself,\u201d Chisel-face said.</p><p>Darcy gritted her teeth. \u201cYes, Mr. Harrison will come down at some time during the investigation. He\u2019s been delayed. At the moment, he is tied up with business in London.\u201d She stopped, irritated that she\u2019d felt herself obliged to explain anything to these men.</p><p>She was about to rise when the fourth member of the party\u2014the man with the decent haircut and store-bought clothing suddenly leaned forward, extending a hand to her. \u201cSorry, we should have introduced ourselves, especially me, right away. I\u2019m David Jenner, Jenner Equipment\u2014and someone from your office approached me about renting some recording and video equipment.\u201d He shrugged, flashing a glance across the table. \u201cShould the project go forward.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDavid, nice to meet you,\u201d she said. \u201cJustin, our office manager, told me that he had talked to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have your own equipment?\u201d Chisel-face asked.</p> <p>\u201cOf course, we have some very specialized equipment,\u201d Darcy forced herself to say politely. \u201cBut we like to rent video cameras and tape recorders from local facilities. That keeps anyone from suggesting that we\u2019ve rigged anything. Mr. Stone knows how we work and what we do\u2014he was sent information on the company.\u201d</p><p>Chisel-face inclined his head, and she wished that the idiot wasn\u2019t wearing sunglasses in the middle of a smoky bar. \u201cIt\u2019s good to hear that you think local facilities might offer you enough\u2014you know, equipment up to the par of your...investigative techniques.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve worked across the country\u2014and abroad,\u201d she said coolly, \u201cand we have always maintained excellent work relationships in every area.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds mighty fine!\u201d</p><p>Darcy was startled when the voice came from behind her. She turned to see that the pool player who had been called Carter had come up behind her. He was taller than she had realized; she was fairly tall herself at five nine, and in her heels, she had another two inches. He wore a beard and mustache, and had intense green eyes. And beneath his worn flannel shirt, he seemed to be in exceptional condition. She did, however, feel as if she had completely stepped back in time. Put a uniform on him, and he might have been the cavalry general Jeb Stuart, having stepped off his horse and into the local tavern. He stared at her with a strange sincerity as he spoke. \u201cToo many times, Yankees have come down South and thought themselves like almighty gods. But, hey, you know, this just might be the right one. Ms. Tremayne, I\u2019ve seen your face all over on billboards, too. You just may be the one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d she murmured. Yankees had come south? She\u2019d done a lot of traveling, but she\u2019d never felt a time warp such as this before. \u201cYou know,\u201d she said quietly, \u201cmy company isn\u2019t really headquartered more than two hours away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA popular face,\u201d Chisel-face murmured. \u201cForgive me\u2014it just seems so strange. A model. Hm. Maybe they sent you down to manipulate Matt Stone. Not a bad idea? I mean, could you possibly really be the business end of this deal? You are an exceptionally fine-looking Yank\u2014even with a packet of degrees from NYU.\u201d</p><p>Darcy felt fury suddenly take root in every limb of her body. Get along with the locals! Like hell! She\u2019d had it. Everything she\u2019d learned in college, in business, and in life, fled her mind, and her temper kicked in.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s an excellent school,\u201d she said, rising. \u201cAnd I\u2019m afraid, gentlemen, that the rest of the world has entered the twenty-first century. The Civil War was lost during the nineteenth. We\u2019re all one big country now, you might recall. Washington D.C.\u2014where I\u2019m based\u2014is extremely close. Busy. The world goes on there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cD.C.,\u201d Chisel-face murmured, then grinned at his fellows. \u201cI\u2019ll bet the old boys considered it just one and the same as this area, eh boys?\u201d</p><p>She rose, hands planted firmly down on the table, and assessed him coolly. Words seemed to spit from her before she took the time to think them out. \u201cYou know, I did forget to return your rather backward compliment. Actually, you\u2019re not too bad-looking for a total asshole. You really will excuse me. In truth, none of this, me, my credentials, my job here\u2014is any of your business. I need to discuss matters with Mr. Stone, and no one else.\u201d She allowed her gaze to sweep with disdain over the lot of them and she turned and walked with crisply clicking heels to the door, where she turned back. \u201cBy the way, just for your information, the South lost the war. If any of you happen to see Mr. Stone, perhaps you\u2019ll be good enough to let him know that I did come to meet him. I\u2019ll be calling.\u201d</p><p>As she stared at the men, they rose, staring back at her. The most friendly of them, Dimple-face, began to smile.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d he said, \u201cI think Matt Stone definitely knows you were here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d she grated. \u201cAnd why is that.\u201d</p><p>Chisel-face spoke up. \u201cMs. Tremayne, I am Matt Stone.\u201d</p><p>Adam Harrison would have handled it all much better. He would have found a way to be both dignified and smooth. But of course, if Adam had felt that he\u2019d cast himself into a den of testosterone, he would have had managed to gain respect immediately, no matter what.</p><p>Darcy couldn\u2019t quite diffuse the steam rising in her.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m sorry that I can\u2019t say it\u2019s been a pleasure, since you\u2019ve done nothing but amuse yourself at my expense, Mr. Stone. And if you destroy this opportunity, it won\u2019t hurt me in the least. My employer is the man who deems your house important.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>With that, she turned, exited, and let the door close behind her.</p><p>\u201cWell, that was just great!\u201d Mae said from behind the bar.</p><p>Matt set his sunglasses on top of his head and turned to Mae with a challenging look. \u201cMae, I didn\u2019t know who the hell she was at first, and since it was my understanding Harrison was coming himself, she made me somewhat wary. We don\u2019t need a bunch of crackpots thinking that they can come here and recreate a \u2018Blair Witch\u2019 scenario.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s right,\u201d Clint said, grinning in a way that made his dimple deep, amusement lighting his eyes. \u201cA goddess walks in\u2014and he sends her out as rudely as possible. Good going, Matt.\u201d</p><p>Clint was Matt\u2019s second cousin, but though he carried the family name, his grandfather had been born on what they called the wrong side of the blanket. Probably a good thing; Clint\u2019s commitment to enjoying life was often entertaining, but Matt was pretty certain that, had the property gone down to Clint, it was unlikely they\u2019d be having this discussion now\u2014the holding would have been long gone. Not because the fields might have fallen prey to plight or disease, but rather to the plague of gambling debt that never seemed to dampen Clint\u2019s spirits.</p><p>Matt looked from Mae to Clint, shaking his head. \u201cDoesn\u2019t the concept of dignity mean anything to the two of you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a hell of a lot,\u201d Clint said cheerfully.</p><p>\u201cDignity? Do you think you allowed that poor girl to feel that she had any?\u201d Carter asked.</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s accustomed to getting whatever she wants, I imagine,\u201d Matt said with a shrug. \u201cAnd don\u2019t you tell me about dignity, Carter.\u201d He admitted, only to himself, that he might have been rude\u2014only a bit. But at least with reason. Still, he felt obliged to remind his friend about some of his own behavior. \u201cIf I remember correctly, you were so rude to your friend, Catherine Angsley, in this very bar, in front of far more people, that she left the county, never to be seen again.\u201d</p><p>Carter shrugged. \u201cAt least I knew her first.\u201d</p><p>Mae chuckled. \u201cAnd you, young man,\u201d she said to Clint. \u201cYou sent that beautiful Texan, what was her name? Salela Bennett, running all the way back to Texas!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSasha,\u201d Clint corrected.</p><p>\u201cSasha, that\u2019s right. Sasha. Why can\u2019t I ever remember that name?\u201d Mae asked. \u201cOh! Maybe it\u2019s because no one could possibly keep track of the women who come and go through your ever so charming lives!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMae! We\u2019re just looking for true love,\u201d Clint said dryly.</p> <p>\u201cMy foot! You\u2019re looking for the next great body. But I think that the two of you could be left in the dust by this new visitor,\u201d Mae informed them with a sagely spoken pleasure.</p><p>\u201cWell, of course, because with Matt\u2019s brand of charm, she\u2019ll be heading straight back to Washington,\u201d Carter said with a sigh. He arched a brow to Matt. \u201cI can recall a few times when you might have been a little rough on Lavinia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least he married her first,\u201d Mae said.</p><p>\u201cI was never that rude to Lavinia\u2014even in the midst of divorce,\u201d Matt said, irritated with himself that he was still feeling defensive, and now being reminded of his disastrous marriage.</p><p>\u201cSee, Mae? You can\u2019t rush into marriage,\u201d Carter said. \u201cLook at the whole Lavinia thing. There she was\u2014the most gorgeous thing breathing on earth, and what a manipulative witch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe just didn\u2019t have the same concept of a life well lived,\u201d Matt said, wondering why in the hell he should suddenly defend even his ex-wife. Simple fact, Lavinia had been a bitch. Rich, spoiled, and heedless of anyone around her.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re all missing the point here,\u201d old Anthony Larkin suddenly pointed out. \u201cMae, seems to me the world has changed a lot since I was a young man. Hell, yes, these young people should find out if they\u2019re going to make it in an affair before tying the knot. Divorces are too easy these days, and they\u2019re still hard as hell on people. Especially on their kids!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, thankfully, Matt and Lavinia didn\u2019t have kids. A devil\u2019s tail might have shown up on one of them,\u201d Clint said. \u201cI think Lavinia\u2019s had plastic surgery to get rid of hers, but genetically, it would have still been there.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLavinia is gone, and it\u2019s over,\u201d Matt said flatly.</p><p>\u201cThat Sibel, Shana, or Sheila girl Clint was dating wasn\u2019t a bitch,\u201d Mae said with a sniff. \u201cOpinionated, and intelligent, and ready to take care of herself. But she wasn\u2019t a bitch.\u201d</p><p>Clint offered an exaggerated sigh. \u201cMae, her name was Sasha. Sasha Bennett. And the problem with our great affair was that she wanted me to move to Texas! And wait a minute\u2014we\u2019re getting off the subject here.\u201d</p><p>Anthony shook his white head in a way that made his beard rake back and forth over his chest. \u201cAll right, here\u2019s my opinion from an old geezer, Matt. Let\u2019s forget about past transgressions\u2014committed by the lot of you. Every woman isn\u2019t a potential affair. This one seems darned regal and intelligent. She was sent here to work. Matt, you\u2019re having trouble up at your place. You told me yourself, you called your grandfather\u2019s old friend Harrison after you received his letter. Key concept here\u2014you called him. So\u2014just why were you such a jerk to that girl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe looks too much like Lavinia,\u201d Clint said.</p><p>\u201cNo, she doesn\u2019t,\u201d Carter argued. \u201cShe has the walk, the movement...kind of like a natural grace. That\u2019s all that\u2019s the same.\u201d</p><p>Matt scowled at them both. \u201cHey, looks have nothing to do with anything, gentlemen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGentlemen?\u201d Mae said with a sniff.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m unhappy about the whole thing, I suppose. And yes, I called Adam after I got the letter, but that\u2019s the point\u2014I expected Adam Harrison himself,\u201d Matt admitted ruefully. \u201cAnd then again, maybe it all did have something to do with her appearance.\u201d He glared at Clint and Carter. \u201cNot that she resembles Lavinia in any way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t. She\u2019s really much prettier,\u201d Mae put in.</p><p>\u201cBut,\u201d Matt continued. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t look like any hard-core investigator, does she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLooks can be deceiving,\u201d Carter said.</p><p>\u201cHey, they say you\u2019re going to let Liz do a seance,\u201d Anthony Larkin reminded him. \u201cHow hard-core would that be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiz was close with Gramps, too,\u201d Matt said. \u201cA really great nurse to him toward the end. I owe her.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cShe begged when I told her that I had people coming down who were supposedly ghost experts. She wanted first crack at a seance, before any out-of-towners took over. She also holds her Women\u2019s Town Meeting in the house once a month, and it\u2019s a big event that makes the house a good income.\u201d</p><p>Anthony shrugged. \u201cFigured it had to be something like that. I ran into her down at the drugstore. She said that she\u2019d been pleading with you, just for herself, since she\u2019s so sure she feels all that cold stuff, especially in the upstairs bedroom. And she said that the writer could come in, and the new guy from the Chamber of Commerce. So...it\u2019s a crock if you\u2019re keeping out that pretty girl because she\u2019s more about ghosts than finding out if something natural is going bump in the middle of the night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd damn, but she is good-looking,\u201d Clint supplied.</p><p>Matt nodded slowly. They were all right\u2014and he had been one hell of an ass to the woman. She had just hit a raw nerve with him, he supposed, looking as if she had just stepped off a fashion page, heels clicking on the floor, manicured nails expressive in the air as she spoke, her face that of a sophisticated angel\u2014or siren, one or the other.</p><p>Redheads were always trouble.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just irritated, I guess. Maybe I do owe her an apology.\u201d</p><p>The phone rang stridently from the bar. He felt a surge of anger. She was already calling. Mae picked up the phone.</p><p>\u201cHello...yes, Penny, he\u2019s here. He\u2019s got his cell phone turned off again, huh? Well, he\u2019s sitting here, sure as can be. Shouldn\u2019t have that cell phone turned off, Matt, you know that,\u201d she said, her hand over the receiver.</p><p>\u201cShirley at the station knows where I am, and that\u2019s all that matters,\u201d Matt said.</p><p>\u201cPenny knows you\u2019re here now, come on over and talk to her! Please!\u201d Mae insisted, seeing the stubborn set to his jaw.</p><p>Matt cast Mae an evil eye, then rose to accept the receiver from behind the bar. Penny came on the line.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMatt, I heard you gave that girl from New York an absolutely wretched time!\u201d</p><p>\u201cPenny, I really did no such thing. And how did you hear so fast?\u201d</p><p>Matt looked around. Sure enough, Marty Sawyer\u2014Penny\u2019s nephew\u2014who had been watching Carter\u2019s pool game was now nowhere to be seen. He\u2019d slunk out already.</p><p>\u201cMatt Stone! There is so much good to be done here! Principal Joe from the grade school was telling me how much the schoolchildren just loved the living history productions we did last summer, and you know as well as I do that you can\u2019t keep that kind of program going if we don\u2019t make sure that the house is entirely safe. And you\u2019ve already agreed that we can let the seance go on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause even though I don\u2019t believe in such a thing as a \u2018medium,\u2019 I like Elizabeth!\u201d he said irritably.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to make a tiny percentage off Elizabeth\u2014compared to what Adam Harrison is paying to investigate your property. He usually charges people for his services. Now you know that I personally think that the ghosts are wonderful, but even I\u2019m getting nervous here. Think about poor Clara\u2019s face\u2014and don\u2019t go telling me she bumped into a wall. We need our ghost stories, some of them are so great. Passion, spurned lovers, murders, suicides! But...there\u2019s something not at all right going on as well. Oh, Matt, please! If you really love the house and our history and want to keep the place open, not to mention in the family!\u2014please let this girl come and get started on her investigations, no matter what it is, exactly, that she does.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He gazed back at the bar.

It isn\u2019t going to matter what I do\u2014the stories are going to circulate forever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen the woman in white,\u201d Penny said stubbornly.</p><p>\u201cPenny, you drank half the wine cellar that night,\u201d he reminded her.</p> <p>\u201cNevertheless, this is important. Yes, we\u2019ll have stories, no matter what. But you said yourself that you were suspicious that someone was causing some of the \u2018haunting.\u2019 How will you ever know, or prove anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPenny, I am the sheriff. I know a few things about investigating occurrences on my own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMatt, where\u2019s your patriotism?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he said incredulously.</p><p>\u201cThe house is so important. What if someone really gets hurt?\u201d</p> <p>He almost smiled. It was a new line of attack.</p><p>From the table, he heard the sound of David Jenner clearing his throat. \u201cYou know, Matt, things haven\u2019t been that great. I could really use the work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. You know, we\u2019re not all rich, kind of famous, and born with absolutely legitimate names,\u201d Clint said, grinning with a shrug.</p><p>\u201cMatt, maybe you could do us all some good,\u201d Carter told him.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t have to do a thing,\u201d Penny\u2019s voice said from over the phone wire. \u201cGive Ms. Tremayne my number. And I\u2019ll handle everything. You don\u2019t have to come anywhere near the house if you don\u2019t want to while she\u2019s in it. But first, you go over right now and get her out of that ramshackle hotel where\u2019s she staying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d</p> <p>Carter could obviously hear Penny. He owned the ramshackle hotel.</p><p>Again, Matt couldn\u2019t help but grin. \u201cHell, all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMatt, honestly, you don\u2019t even have to be involved, I\u2019ll do everything, I swear! Dammit, Matt, you\u2019re the one who called Adam Harrison, why are you balking now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I expected Adam Harrison,\u201d he said, feeling like a broken record, his temper rising. Impatiently, he said, \u201cI\u2019ll talk to her, Penny.\u201d Then he hung up.</p><p>Mae grinned like a kid with a candy bar. \u201cThis is so cool\u2014Melody House is getting real live ghost busters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re not ghost busters, Mae,\u201d Matt said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got to go to that seance!\u201d Mae said firmly.</p><p>\u201cYou all really did hear every single word of that conversation,\u201d Matt said ruefully.</p> <p>A circle of nods answered him. He shook his head. \u201cHell\u2014I guess I will start answering my cell phone,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cWell...?\u201d Clint drawled. \u201cWhen are you going to bite the bullet, give that girl a call and convince her that she is welcome here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSoon. But not from here,\u201d he said. He slid his sunglasses back down over his eyes, and strode to the door, taking his hat from a peg on the wall. He twisted his jaw; he didn\u2019t believe in ghosts, spirits, haunts, or the goddamned Easter bunny, and he sure as hell didn\u2019t believe in premonitions.</p><p>Still, he didn\u2019t like this.</p><p>He shook his head, speaking with his back to the others.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s an awful lot that\u2019s bad in that place\u2019s past,\u201d he said.</p><p>He walked back into the sunshine of the day, letting the door slam behind him.</p><p>There was silence in his wake for several seconds.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s going to let it happen, Mae, don\u2019t worry, you\u2019ll get to go to a real live seance,\u201d Clint assured the woman still standing behind the bar, and still staring after Matt Stone.</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, it\u2019s not the whole thing with the house that makes him so hostile,\u201d Mae said quietly.</p><p>\u201cHe just never should have married that bitch from New York,\u201d Carter agreed.</p><p>\u201cRedhead, too,\u201d David Jenner murmured.</p><p>\u201cWell, living or dead, it\u2019s always people that haunt the living!\u201d Mae said sagely, offering a sad shake of her head. Then she brightened, sounding like a girl about to head for her first dance. \u201cAnd you bet your butts, gentlemen! I\u2019m going to get to see a real live ghost!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMae, if you see a ghost, the point is, it\u2019s not \u2018live,\u2019\u201d Clint said dryly. \u201cBut what the hell? Things could get darned interesting around here.\u201d</p><p>Thirty minutes later, Darcy was back in her hotel room, listening to the voice on her cell phone.</p><p>\u201cYou want me to do what?\u201d she said incredulously to Adam. \u201cNot apologize, right?\u201d</p><p>Darcy actually pulled the cell phone away from her ear to stare at it, despite the fact that on an intellectual level, she knew she couldn\u2019t see her employer\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t apologize, just rethink things.\u201d Adam, far away in London, was quiet for a minute. \u201cDarcy, I have a vested interest in the house. I\u2019ll explain when I get back into the country.\u201d He sighed softly. \u201cDarcy, there\u2019s no one like you. I need you. Please don\u2019t sound as if I\u2019ve asked you to make peace with hostile aliens or some such thing.\u201d</p><p>Darcy winced. She knew that there was something about Melody House that Adam hadn\u2019t shared with her yet. Had to be. She was often certain herself that Adam, despite his own apparent wealth, was funded as well by another source\u2014possibly governmental. They\u2019d quietly gone in and out of a number of Federal buildings in previous cases. This was different. He really wanted in. For personal reasons, so it seemed. Reasons he wasn\u2019t willing to share, as yet.</p><p>\u201cAdam, if this was so important, you should have been here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. But I had to be in London.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t ask for an explanation, because he was a man who always kept business confidential, and even with her, information was shared on a need to know basis.</p><p>\u201cDarcy, are you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve met a lot of skeptics,\u201d she said, \u201cI\u2019ve just never had to actually work with anyone so openly hostile.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can do it. I know you can,\u201d Adam said.</p><p>\u201cBut,\u201d she said quietly, \u201cyou don\u2019t really want me to call this guy and apologize, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d never ask you to do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s let it lie for now. I\u2019m willing to bet that you\u2019ll hear from him.\u201d</p><p>Darcy breathed out on a deep sigh. She hated the fact that she hadn\u2019t handled the situation well at all. Her affection for Adam was very deep and real.</p><p>\u201cAll right. So what exactly do I do now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust sit tight. Is the hotel okay?\u201d</p><p>Darcy looked around the room. \u201cSure,\u201d she lied. As she did so, the hotel line began to ring. She stared at the phone distastefully. It was dirtier than a pay phone outside a heavily frequented gas station.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got another call,\u201d she told Adam.</p><p>\u201cAny premonitions?\u201d Adam said lightly. \u201cI\u2019m willing to bet that it\u2019s Stone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see. I\u2019ll give you a call back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, you don\u2019t need to,\u201d he said, and hung up. Again, Darcy stared at her cell phone, shook her head, and forced herself to pick up the hotel line.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMs. Tremayne, it\u2019s Matt Stone.\u201d</p><p>She was silent, waiting. Adam had been right.</p><p>Of course.</p><p>Apparently, Matt Stone could be stubborn, too. The silence stretched on.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d she said again. She could almost see his teeth grate in the steel cage of his face.</p><p>\u201cAs you\u2019re aware, I own Melody House. I don\u2019t actually live in the main house all the time, though I stay now and then. However, I have a woman who manages the upkeep and the tours we allow through, and the events which are held there upon occasion. Her name is Penny Sawyer, and I\u2019ll put you in contact with her. She\u2019s incredibly anxious to have you and your company in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did talk to Adam Harrison,\u201d he said, not agreeing or disagreeing. \u201cThe house holds incredible historical importance,\u201d he said flatly.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, Penny is supposed to handle everything. And she\u2019s great with the place, knows all about it, and can help you with whatever you need. When you\u2019ve got your plans down all pat, I\u2019ll be back in on it, though. It\u2019s still my place. And I want final approval on what you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNaturally,\u201d Darcy said. She knew that it sounded as if her words were a flat fuck you, guess I\u2019ve got no choice.</p><p>\u201cPenny has suggested that you move on over to the house now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s not necessary\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need to be in the house to investigate it, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just meant that there was probably no need for that kind of hurry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPenny wants you there as soon as possible. She\u2019s very eager to have you. Also, her office is in the house. We have all kinds of documents there, so...you could get started.\u201d</p><p>Darcy looked around her hotel room. It was stretching it to even call the place a hotel. She didn\u2019t flinch at the sight of bugs, but she had gagged over the film of them she\u2019d had to clean out of the bathtub before managing a quick shower.</p><p>Maybe Matt Stone was something of a psychic himself. His next words suggested that he had read her mind.</p><p>\u201cMs. Tremayne, I\u2019m familiar with the hotel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. I might as well get started. You\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be there for you in thirty minutes.\u201d</p><p>She opened her mouth to protest. She could have used a little more time just to survey the area before entering the house.</p><p>Too late. He\u2019d hung up.</p><p>Swearing, she did the same. She looked around the small room. Not much to pick up\u2014she\u2019d been too afraid of getting creepy-crawly things in her lingerie to unpack much. She fished her few personal articles from the bathroom and folded the few pieces of clothing she\u2019d had out in less than ten minutes. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Which turned out to be good. Matt Stone\u2019s concept of time was not at all precise. She had barely made a quick run-through to assure herself she hadn\u2019t forgotten anything when there was a knock at her door.</p><p>She opened it. He stood there, sunglasses in place, a lock of his dark hair windblown and sprawling over his forehead. In her business heels, she was just a shade under six feet. He still seemed to tower. She didn\u2019t like the disadvantage, even if height didn\u2019t really mean a damned thing.</p><p>\u201cReady, Ms. Tremayne?\u201d</p> <p>She took a breath, forcing something of a grimace rather than a smile. \u201cMr. Stone, somehow you manage to drawl out a simple Ms. as if it were a word composed of one long z, and a filthy one at that. My name is Darcy, and I\u2019m accustomed to going by it.\u201d</p><p>He cocked his head slightly. She couldn\u2019t read his eyes because of the shades. \u201cAll right\u2014Darcy. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re capable of moving. I have to get back into the office so let\u2019s get going, you know, quickly. Where\u2019s your bag?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can take it myself, thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you just show me the damned bag?\u201d</p><p>She set her hands on her hips. \u201cSomeone ought to call the local cops on you. You may be some kind of a big landholder in these here parts, bucko, but you\u2019re the rudest individual I\u2019ve ever met.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSorry, but my time is limited. Please, Ms. Tremayne\u2014sorry, Darcy, may I take your bag?\u201d he said sarcastically.</p><p>\u201cFine. Right there. It rolls\u2014unless you\u2019ll feel that your macho image will be marred and lessened by taking an easy route.\u201d</p><p>He offered her a dry grimace, grabbed the bag, and started out.</p><p>She followed him, exiting the spiderweb filled hallways of the place, out to the parking lot.</p><p>She didn\u2019t see any regular cars\u2014there were a few trucks, a code-enforcement vehicle, and a county cop car in the lot.</p><p>He had a really long stride, but had paused just outside the building and removed his sunglasses, waiting for her to catch up. He saw that she was staring expectantly out at the parking lot.</p> <p>\u201cOh, sorry,\u201d he told her flatly. \u201cIt\u2019s that one. I guess everyone forgot to tell you. I\u2019m the local sheriff. Guess Adam didn\u2019t tell you, either. But then, since you\u2019re supposed to be a psychic, you should have known.\u201d He stared at her, a light of mockery in his eyes.</p><p>She smiled sweetly in return. \u201cMr. Stone, I\u2019m not exactly a psychic. There are certain areas in which I can deduce things. There are certain things about people I don\u2019t know. But then again, there are things that people really don\u2019t want known that I can deduce very easily. I\u2019m known for finding skeletons in closets, and I\u2019m sure that there are dozens of them at Melody House.\u201d</p><p>Staring back at her, he was dead still then. His eyes were dark, not brown, but a deep gray. Disturbing. They seemed to pierce right through her, and yet wear a protective veil that kept her from reading anything within them. Still, it seemed that she had given him pause.</p><p>\u201cShall we go?\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes. I\u2019m just dying to see what bones you can dig up, Ms. Tremayne. Just dying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. Just...\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe prepared. Sometimes, people don\u2019t like the skeletons we find.\u201d</p> <p>Chapter 3</p><p>3</p><p>\u201cT o me, it\u2019s simply one of the most incredible houses\u2014and historical sites\u2014on the face of the earth!\u201d Penny said enthusiastically.</p><p>Darcy smiled, thinking that she agreed\u2014despite the difficulty involved with the place, and that difficulty being Matt Stone.</p><p>He had maintained something of a pleasant conversation on the drive over, pointing out Civil War skirmish sites, and telling her that at one point, on his way to battle, the great Southern general Robert E. Lee had stayed at Melody House. Then they had reached the house, and though she couldn\u2019t say he had practically thrown her out of the car, he had delivered her to the front door and Penny Sawyer as quickly as possible, explaining simply that he was on duty.</p><p>Hm. She wondered if he\u2019d been on duty while sprawling around at the Wayside Tavern as well.</p><p>But Penny Sawyer was wonderful. Darcy couldn\u2019t quite determine her age. The woman was certainly somewhere between forty and sixty, which was quite a span. She was slender, about five-five, with an attractive shag type of short haircut in a natural salt and pepper, and had beautiful, bright blue eyes. She was also nicely dressed in a stylish pantsuit, and as friendly as her employer was rude.</p><p>\u201cThe house is quite incredible,\u201d Darcy said. \u201cA number of historical homes\u2014usually those owned by preservation societies\u2014have been restored with painstaking authenticity, but it\u2019s amazing to see the integrity of this house, especially when it\u2019s been a family home all along.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, well, the old gentleman, Matt\u2019s grandfather, really loved the place. Treated the house like a baby. He wanted it to be a home while maintaining all that it had been. He was a remarkable old fellow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparently.\u201d</p><p>Penny gave her a funny little rueful smile. \u201cOddly enough, believe me, Matt is just as dedicated to the preservation of the house. He wants to maintain it himself, though\u2014you know, he doesn\u2019t want it going to any societies, no matter how good they might be, because he would lose control. He knows that house has to hold its own if he\u2019s going to hang on to it. Upkeep on these places is staggering. And sheriffs just don\u2019t make that kind of money. Oh! That didn\u2019t really sound the way it should\u2014he\u2019s a man of incredible integrity. What I mean is, no matter how he loves the place, he\u2019d never do anything illegal. Of course, you didn\u2019t suggest such a thing!\u201d Penny broke off with a laugh. \u201cThere would never be such a thing as graft involved in Matt\u2019s life. He\u2019s a great sheriff. The people love him. He can defuse the most ungodly situations, speak to the youngsters around here and all...but what it means is that he has to have tours going through here, and he has to make the house pay. That\u2019s all. So! What kind of a feel do you get from the place? Is it haunted?\u201d</p><p>Darcy smiled again at the question, wondering how to answer. \u201cThere\u2019s a tremendous feel of the past about the place, I can tell you that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you...well, you see ghosts, right?\u201d</p><p>Darcy hesitated again. \u201cFor the most part, I would say that, so far, the house actually has a warm feel to it. As if whatever remains of the distant past is mostly benign. But there is a feel to the house. That\u2019s natural when so much has occurred through so many years. Many people believe that since we\u2014humans\u2014are made up of energy, and energy cannot actually be de stroyed\u2014that trauma forces that energy to remain, when the soul should have gone on.\u201d</p><p>Penny arched a brow to her. \u201cI know what most people feel and think. But you are a psychic. So\u2014what do you think? Actually, no matter what you say, you won\u2019t change what I feel and believe. I know that ghosts exist. I\u2019ve seen one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>Penny shrugged. They were in her office, a very nicely done room on the ground floor, near to Matt\u2019s, as Penny had pointed out.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen the woman in the white peignoir who runs from the Lee room and down the stairs. And I\u2019m beginning to believe that she\u2019s not a benign entity at all. Oh, don\u2019t get me wrong. I personally love the ghost stories that abound around here. They\u2019re important\u2014they draw visitors to the house. But lately, the ghost seems to be getting\u2014physical.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly how so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, not long ago we had a bride and groom staying in the room. She woke up in the middle of the night and the ghost spoke to her, or pulled her hair, or something. She wasn\u2019t terribly clear. She came running down the stairs stark naked in the middle of the night, and refused to go back to the room even to pack up her things. Then, Clara Issy, one of the housekeepers, and a wonderful woman, came flying out because of the same thing happening. The ghost left a mark on her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did Sheriff Stone have to say about that?\u201d Darcy asked.</p><p>Penny waved a dismissive hand in the air. \u201cHe says he\u2019s convinced Clara ran into something. Matt simply refuses to believe in anything that doesn\u2019t have full dimensions. However, he has said that we can have a seance here. None of this is making any sense to me. Matt may not know much about Harrison Investigations, but I do. Adam Harrison is supposed to be one of the most credible and influential investigators of psychic phenomena in the world! Matt knew that you all were coming\u2014well, all right, he expected Adam himself\u2014but he told Liz that she could carry on a seance. Go figure. Of course, he doesn\u2019t really believe that anyone will contact the spirits, so maybe he wanted to make Liz happy, and annoy those who might have been able to make a special connection with whatever is going on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will be interesting to take part in a seance here, no matter who is acting as the medium,\u201d Darcy told her tactfully.</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s going to be tomorrow night,\u201d Penny told her. \u201cI\u2019m setting up in the parlor, since Elizabeth says we should be using the center of the house, the heart of it.\u201d</p><p>Darcy lifted her hands. \u201cSounds fine to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m relieved. After all\u2014you\u2019re the professional.\u201d</p><p>Darcy smiled. \u201cI\u2019m not so sure there is such a thing as a professional in this particular area. I\u2019m sure Elizabeth will prove to be a fine medium.\u201d Darcy rose. \u201cMind if I take a walk around?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not, dear! Your bag has been taken up to the Lee Room\u2014where the phenomenon has occurred. I imagine that whereas others might wake up in terror, you would wake up and try to talk to the ghost, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething like that,\u201d Darcy agreed.</p><p>\u201cWell, then, you just make yourself at home.\u201d She handed Darcy a pamphlet. \u201cThese are, as you\u2019ll see, obviously for the tour groups. But the little map will help you get your bearings, and there are a few little tidbits of history about the house in there as well.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cTerrific,\u201d Darcy said. \u201cThank you so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy pleasure, and please, should you need anything, anything at all, don\u2019t hesitate to ask me. I\u2019m delighted to have you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p> <p>Darcy took the little map and exited Penny\u2019s office. It was one of two on the right side of the hall that connected the foyer and the grand stairway.</p><p>For a moment, she paused. This was the most important part of her work, as she saw it. Adam Harrison was excellent with machinery. Gauges that registered temperature changes, recorders that caught the slightest hint of sound. There were even gadgets that could record any rise or fall in a magnetic field. When he came, he would work with a Trifield Meter, and measure electromagnetic pollution. He also used a Trifield Natural EM meter, which measured electric as well as magnetic fields\u2014showing disturbances where there should be none\u2014and, as Adam was fond of telling clients\u2014it was also a great tool for finding out if your microwave leaked or not. In his work, however, he knew that any kind of physical manifestation required a certain amount of energy, moving air, heat, cold, all and any changes that might take place in an area.</p><p>Adam worked from a seriously scientific point of reference.</p><p>But for her, it was the feel of a place. It was getting to know it.</p><p>And often, when she first arrived at a place reputed to be haunted, she would feel that Josh was with her. Ready to be beside her, vigilant, her guard in the strange world, perhaps.</p> <p>She waited. But she didn\u2019t feel his presence. She waited several minutes, dead still, making an effort to clear her mind, which wasn\u2019t usually necessary. And still, she had no sense or feel of him, which was very unusual.</p><p>And yet the house seemed more alive with past energy than any other place she had ever been.</p><p>She walked back first to the entry, or foyer, and stared at the little map, getting her bearings. Not that the house was that complicated. From the wraparound porch, one entered the foyer, with the superb staircase. The house had been built like many a colonial with the hall\u2014or what was really a massive breezeway\u2014immediately to the right of the stairs. It made a straight and direct path to the back doors. At one time, before air-conditioning, such a breezeway allowed for the house to be cooled in summer by the continual flow of air, since both front and back doors would have been left open for that precise purpose.</p><p>There was one room other than the offices on that side of the house, the library. Darcy took a quick peek in at the room. Shelves lined three of the walls while a fireplace with a handsome carved hearth took up a majority of the fourth. The hardwood floor here was covered with a very fine, probably antique, Persian carpet. A huge mahogany desk sat in the room, while overstuffed reading chairs sat by the fire. She wondered if Matt Stone was aware of the value of the many ancient tomes that filled the cases\u2014along with a lot of modern material as well.</p><p>The desk had a computer, printer, and seemed well set for any business purpose. She assumed the arrangement of the equipment here was for the convenience of the guests, since it had appeared that Penny\u2019s office was supplied with all the technology she might need to run Melody House. Matt\u2019s office was probably equally as well appointed.</p><p>Standing in the library, she closed her eyes for a moment and felt the room. The atmosphere was rich. A great deal of passion, emotion, and simple life had taken place within the room. But there was nothing here that seemed to hint of evil or malignance. She opened her eyes and exited the library, heading back to the foyer.</p> <p>The staircase seemed somewhat disturbing, which Darcy didn\u2019t find at all odd. She wondered how many men had walked down that stairway, followed by wives, lovers, or children, only to ride away to war, and perhaps never return.</p><p>The parlor was truly beautiful. She ignored the velvet ropes that kept the area protected from the sticky fingers of visiting children, the abuse of too many feet, and the overall damage that could be caused by large groups coming through on a frequent basis. Like the library, the parlor had a feel. When she closed her eyes, it drummed with the energy of the past. But again, she felt nothing evil.</p><p>Beyond the beautifully appointed parlor were the dining room\u2014elegantly set as if for a dinner party of twenty in the mid-eighteen-hundreds\u2014and the kitchen, kept entirely charming while being in a state-of-the-art condition. She instantly loved the room. There, the back door gave way to the wraparound porch. The view from the porch was exquisite. It was a beautiful day and the mountains could be seen in the distance in a riot of greens, violets, pinks, oranges and golds. The season was rich with flowers and foliage.</p><p>Darcy stepped back in. Rather than return to the foyer to take the grand stairway to the second floor, she walked up the far-less-spectacular servants\u2019 stairway, winding from the rear of the kitchen up to the back of the hall on the second story. She gazed at her map again. Originally, there had been six bedrooms up here. Now, there were five, since the master suite these days consisted of a second office or sitting room as well as the master\u2019s\u2014Matt\u2019s?\u2014bedroom.</p><p>She assumed his personal area was off-limits to her. For the time, at least.</p><p>The rooms had apparently all been named after Southern generals, the Lee Room, or course, being the most prominent and assumably elegant, with the Stuart, Longstreet, Beauregard, and Amistad rooms being a bit smaller, judging by the map. Darcy entered each of the rooms, noting that they were all period, and quite charming, clean as a whistle, and inviting. The crew here kept the place up beautifully.</p><p>At last, she stood in front of the Lee Room, and closed her eyes. The atmosphere was heavy, cloudlike, dense, wrapping around her instantly. She opened her eyes and entered the room.</p><p>French doors were open to the porch. The breeze swept in. The room was quiet, and touched by the sweetness of the breeze.</p> <p>Deceptive, Darcy thought. An aura of tremendous turbulence lay just beneath the apparent peace and serenity.</p><p>She imagined trying to explain the sensations she felt to Matt Stone.</p><p>It was not a pretty picture.</p><p>She didn\u2019t think that there was any way she would ever be able to explain her particular talents to Matt Stone. Adam would understand. He was an amazing man. He had some abilities, but his true talent was in understanding that there were people in the world with special senses. She might have gone mad, seeing and hearing what others didn\u2019t, except for Adam. First, he had believed. In his belief, he afforded her great trust. While he worked on a scientific level, proving different levels of heat and electricity, she worked purely through the visions and feelings that came to her\u2014whether she wanted them or not, most of the time. Adam had taught her how to channel the strange images and feelings that came to her. And when she had thought herself a misfit who could live only in fear, he had taught her that she could bring peace and relief to lost souls, and given her purpose\u2014as well as a very decent living that kept her feeling not only sane, but tremendously useful.</p><p>In this room, the feelings and impressions of trauma rushed around like a swirl of dark storm clouds.</p><p>However, it was incredible. Not a bad place to stay. Far, far, better than the hotel. Her bag was at the foot of the bed. She began to unpack, humming as she did so, yet completely attuned all the while for the slightest shift in the atmosphere.</p><p>All that touched her was the feel of the breeze and yet...</p><p>She was certain that she was watched. She could feel an unease streaking down her spine. It was as if the eyes of someone\u2014something\u2014were intently upon her, creating a trickle of sensation. An unearthly gaze seemed to reach out and touch her.</p><p>Feelings...intuitions. The hackles rising at her nape.</p><p>She paused for a moment.</p><p>But...</p><p>There was nothing solid. Nothing whatsoever. But Darcy knew.</p><p>Whatever lay within the room would wait, observe, and bide its time.</p><p>Summer hours kept the area light until well past eight in the evening.</p><p>Matt arrived home at about six and checked in at the house. He was certain that he\u2019d find Penny and his visitor busily discussing the many ghosts they had already discovered. Maybe they\u2019d even have the Ouija board out.</p><p>But Penny was in the kitchen with Joe McGurdy, their chef. Matt hadn\u2019t known that Joe was coming in that night; he usually arrived only when they had a function planned. Finding the two in the kitchen, he arched a brow at Penny while Joe greeted him with a friendly smile.</p><p>Penny stared at him reproachfully. \u201cWell, of course, we\u2019re having dinner!\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou, me, Darcy, Clint, and Carter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. Eight-course meal?\u201d Matt asked dryly.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous. But you didn\u2019t want me to serve beannie-weannies on her first night here, did you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoodness, of course not,\u201d Matt said. \u201cWhere is our guest?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarter saddled up Nellie for her. She\u2019s taken a ride out to see some of the country around here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo we know that she can ride? There\u2019s some really thick forest if she headed west.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMatt, she is an adult. She said she could ride.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I\u2019ll take a ride out to find her anyway,\u201d he muttered, shaking his head at Penny. Great\u2014they were already bringing the chef in and stretching out the welcome mat. He wondered why Carter hadn\u2019t chosen to ride with their visitor.</p><p>When he\u2019d changed to jeans and sweater and headed out to the stables, he found out why. Carter shrugged, watching Matt as he led Vernon, his quarter horse, from his stall. \u201cShe said that she wanted to do some exploring alone, that it was important for her work. Naturally, I offered to go with her. Are you kidding? The woman is one looker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne kooky looker,\u201d Matt reminded him, slipping a bridle over Vernon\u2019s nose.</p><p>\u201cHey, everybody\u2019s got to make a living somehow, right?\u201d Carter said.</p><p>Matt slung a saddle over Vernon\u2019s back. \u201cI imagine she probably had a few other choices.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe she\u2019s for real,\u201d Carter said. He thoughtfully chewed a blade of hay, eyes amused as he watched Matt mount up. \u201cYou know, I just bought the old Reed place, next county over. If you don\u2019t want her looking for your ghosts, I\u2019ll be happy to have her take a look at mine.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you intend to have her looking for ghosts,\u201d Matt said, shaking his head. \u201cFor the moment, just let me go make sure she\u2019s not lying on a trail somewhere with a broken leg. Whatever possessed you to let her just ride out alone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s see\u2014maybe the fact that she said she didn\u2019t want company?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t own the place,\u201d Matt reminded him.</p> <p>Carter shrugged, stroking his beard. \u201cHell. I don\u2019t own it either, do I now?\u201d</p><p>Matt urged Vernon on out of the stable. \u201cHey\u2014don\u2019t be late for dinner!\u201d Carter called. \u201cSeems like Penny\u2019s got Joe cooking up something good.\u201d</p><p>Matt felt his resentment grow, and put a check on it. Adam Harrison had paid a fair price for coming in to do what he was referring to as \u201cresearch.\u201d And so, hell, they had to feed the woman. Joe would be in again tomorrow night to prepare a meal for those attending the seance. It wasn\u2019t all that big a deal. And as to the horse...</p><p>He could just see lawsuits all over the place. She\u2019d ridden out alone. What if she couldn\u2019t really ride? She\u2019d be suing over her injuries.</p><p>The logical course was across the vast field to the south of the property, leading into trails that veered to the west. Matt could see that his chosen trail had recently been traveled; hoof-marks dotted the dirt and as he reached the field, flattened grasses assured him his instincts had been right.</p> <p>Matt crossed the field, and entered into the broad riding trail that led westward, sloping upward from the valley toward the mountains.</p><p>Another twenty minutes worth of riding and he came to the narrow little rivulet that meandered its way through the woods. The area was much as it had been for hundreds of years\u2014only the continual use of the trails kept them in such sustained and clear condition. The air was cool, the scent of pine sweet.</p><p>When he saw Nellie, riderless, drinking by the stream, he felt a twinge of fear, wondering where the mare might have thrown her rider.</p><p>But even as he dismounted, a quick search of the area showed him that he needn\u2019t have been so concerned\u2014nor so certain that his visitor couldn\u2019t ride. Darcy was seated calmly on a fallen log, idly doodling in the dirt with a bonelike length of a broken branch. She watched him without welcome or rejection as he left Vernon to join Nellie, drinking from the crisp, cool water.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d he said, striding toward her.</p><p>There was still plenty of daylight, but in the forest, the thick canopy of trees created strange slashes of darkness, shadow, and eerie green light. Her hair seemed to shine with an exceptional depth of red, while her eyes appeared a deeper forest shade than the trees themselves. Her complexion appeared paler here, and in her jeans and sweater, she might have been something of an elegant woods nymph. Except, of course, if she were to stand, he knew she would be far too tall to be any elfin creature. It struck him again that what most irritated him about her was that tall, sinewy elegance of hers, the poise and calm that seemed to sit about her shoulders like a cloak.</p> <p>She clasped her hands around her knees, eyeing him with a certain dry hostility. \u201cHello, Sheriff. As you can see, I\u2019ve not broken my fool neck, raced your horse into the ground, or gotten lost in the depth of the forest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid I ever suggest that such things might happen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly because you had no idea I might ask to ride about the area.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou might have mentioned your intentions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen? As you pushed me out of your car at the entrance to Melody House?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did no such thing.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged, not deigning to reply. He felt the itch of irritation again. He understood some of what he was feeling. She wasn\u2019t just tall and elegant, but almost absently sensual, her movements smooth and sleek and feline. She seemed to hint of something that smouldered, richly carnal, and yet on top, she was all wrapped up like an ice princess, lips far too often drawn tight and prudish.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d expected to find you exploring the house.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI did explore the house.\u201d The green of her eyes rested contemptuously on him.</p><p>\u201cAnd you haven\u2019t found my malignant ghost as yet?\u201d</p><p>She replied in an even, dismissive tone, eyes steady on him. \u201cI explored the house, and then the grounds, and now, I\u2019m exploring the area.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d He took a seat on the log beside her. He stared through the trees towards the water, caught now in the sunlight, dazzling like a thousand gems. Then he looked back to her. \u201cThe woods are supposed to be haunted, too, you know. And not because of Melody House.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good to hear,\u201d she said strangely. \u201cJust what is the legend associated with the forest here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, well, long ago\u2014as far back as the late seventeen-hundreds, I believe, there was a family with a small farm a little closer toward the mountains. A father and mother, and a bucketful of kids. The oldest sister was plain, the youngest beautiful. The oldest sister\u2019s suitor fell madly in love with the younger sister. The fellow had to head back east to take care of business, and when he left, he kissed his dearly beloved, the younger sister, goodbye, and they were both deeply happy, because they would be wed as soon as he returned. Little did they know that the oldest sister was a total psychotic\u2014a scorned one, at that. She lured her younger sister into the woods, pretending they were walking to a neighbor\u2019s. She got her to lean down by the stream...and whap!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe killed her with a hatchet, nearly decapitating her. And now, the younger sister\u2019s ghost has been seen running through the forest, blood oozing from the gash in her throat, screaming in terror,\u201d Darcy finished for him.</p><p>Matt lifted his hands. \u201cSomeone told you the legend!\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t reply for a moment, then asked him, \u201cWhat happened to the older sister?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, the young man came back and hanged himself in misery, thwarting the hopes of the young murderess. I guess they didn\u2019t have much evidence they could use at the time, so no one went to trial. But the older sister went completely insane. She was locked up in the family barn until she died, an old woman of eighty, confessing in her later years, and spending many a day screaming that her sister was coming after her in vengeance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, there you have what one might call a truly dysfunctional family,\u201d Darcy said pragmatically.</p><p>\u201cYes, I guess you could say that.\u201d He looked at her. The lines of her face were truly classical, yet her sculpted, porcelain beauty seemed unique as well. She\u2019d been a makeup model, he reminded himself, and she must have made some good money. Why give it all up for this\u2014especially if she was really so heavily laden with academic degrees?</p><p>\u201cThe body of the younger sister was uncovered by a local dog that had been digging,\u201d Darcy said. \u201cBut they didn\u2019t find the skull, and it didn\u2019t receive a decent burial with the body. If someone finds the skull and buries it with the rest of the bones, the haunting in the forest will stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow simple. How cut-and-dried and simple. Hell, we should all start digging up the place to find a skull that may or may not be there. Hm. Then again\u2014where, oh where, do we start? If there were such a relic of humanity remaining from way back when, animals might have carted in anywhere. The stream might have washed it down to Florida by now. But what the hell\u2014people love the ghost stories. So what if the poor ghost goes racing through the trees, screaming and bleeding?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s pretty damned sad,\u201d Darcy told him.</p><p>\u201cWell, when you have time, you feel free to dig around in the forest. It\u2019s county land, but we\u2019ll try to ignore the fact that you\u2019re bound and determined to dig it all up. Just don\u2019t leave any potholes\u2014lots of people use this area for riding, and we wouldn\u2019t want a new ghost running around with its head dangling from a broken neck.\u201d</p><p>He stood impatiently.</p><p>He must have roused her somewhat from her continual, stiff poise, because she leapt up immediately after him. \u201cWhat is the matter with you? Why on earth do you have to be so hostile?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause all you\u2019re going to do is feed into the idiots and drunks who should behave intelligently but go all ga-ga over a ghost story! History can be tragic. Tragic\u2014but past. Let the dead lie, Darcy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou brought me here!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I told Adam Harrison that he could come here.\u201d</p><p>She planted her hands on her hips, head cast back, green eyes as dark and dangerous as the embers of a fire. \u201cNo\u2014 you signed a contract that allowed Harrison Investigations into your house. I am as much a part of Harrison Investigations as Adam.\u201d</p><p>He arched a brow slowly and was pleased to see the slightest sign of a flush entering her cheeks.</p><p>\u201cAlmost as much a part of the company as Adam is himself. And very good at what I do. So\u2014since you hired me to do it, perhaps, just for a while, you could quit being such a macho jerk?\u201d</p><p>He wanted to shout back, to put her in her place. He didn\u2019t have the words, or the intelligent argument he needed. He threw up his hands. \u201cWe need to get back. Dinner will be ready.\u201d</p><p>He turned away, starting for his horse.</p><p>\u201cYou know, every redhead isn\u2019t a total bitch.\u201d</p><p>Startled, he turned back. His voice was far rougher than he intended. \u201cI don\u2019t know what the hell you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour ex-wife Lavinia Harper,\u201d she said simply.</p><p>\u201cI see. You know this because you\u2019re psychic?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou dislike redheads. One doesn\u2019t need to be a psychic to see that. Penny told me about Lavinia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRed hair can be bought in boxes for right around ten bucks. I would never dislike anyone for the color of their hair, skin, eyes, or anything else,\u201d he informed her, meaning to sound as calm and staid as a schoolmaster, displaying his anger nevertheless.</p><p>She gave a stiff smile as she walked by him. \u201cSure. Sorry, then. Excuse me.\u201d</p><p>He let her pass him while he fought his simmering temper, wondering why the hell she could get such a rise out of him, when he was usually level, sane, and careful in any judgment or assumption. Tension rippled through his muscles; he got a handle on it and turned, determined that he would politely help her mount back up on Nellie. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But before he could do so, she was already in the process of easily swinging up on the mare.</p><p>By the time he mounted Vernon, she was headed back through the forest trail.</p><p>He followed her, staying slightly behind and noticing, just as they left the forest trail, that dusk was falling at last.</p> <p>Across the field, Melody House stood on its little hillock, bathed in a strange and eerie glow of crimson and gold.</p><p>The brilliance of light lasted only a few seconds; the sun dipped.</p><p>Night was coming in earnest, wrapped in shadow.</p><p>Despite Matt Stone, or maybe even because of him, dinner at Melody House was an entertaining affair, and Darcy found herself laughing a lot throughout the meal.</p><p>Matt and Penny didn\u2019t seem to agree on anything, but the affection between them was visible and real. Penny wanted to tell legends. Matt wanted to correct her when her legends became too lurid, romantic, or too anything.</p> <p>\u201cIt was as if the entire Southern army was taking refuge at Melody House!\u201d Penny said.</p><p>\u201cThe entire Southern army!\u201d Matt snorted. \u201cA company at best. Twenty men, Penny.\u201d</p><p>Penny waved a hand in the air. \u201cThey were exquisite soldiers,\u201d she said, shaking her head and dismissing Matt\u2019s correction. \u201cThey might as well have numbered thousands. They beat back the Yankees\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? The entire Northern force?\u201d Matt queried, a sparkling light in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cThere were at least one hundred!\u201d Penny said, glaring back at her employer. \u201cThe point is, our boys wouldn\u2019t give up, and they saved the day, but their leader, a young captain, was killed. Shot in the heart by a minnie ball that whizzed right through the parlor windows. Now, he is said to be here, still guarding Melody House.\u201d</p><p>Matt leaned low across the table, amusement in his eyes as they met Darcy\u2019s. \u201cAnd no one seems to have told him that the war is over, that the South lost. He\u2019s not at all fond of Yankee accents\u2014so they say.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThank God, then, that I don\u2019t have one,\u201d Darcy told him sweetly. \u201cAll those years watching late-night shows seems to have paid off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you trained to be an actress\u2014of course you can get rid of an accent!\u201d Carter applauded her admiringly.</p><p>\u201cAn actress, hm,\u201d Matt said.</p><p>\u201cI was going to study acting,\u201d she corrected. \u201cI never did. Not in college, anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. She majored in everything else,\u201d Matt said.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t major in ghosts these days, can you?\u201d Clint asked.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be silly!\u201d Penny reprimanded.</p><p>Both Carter and Clint shrugged.</p> <p>Dessert had been served. An exceptional baked Alaska. Darcy was certain that at any moment, an immaculate butler was going to walk in and suggest that the ladies retire to one room, the gentlemen to another, for brandy and cigars.</p><p>But there was no butler\u2014not tonight, anyway. They had all helped to serve the meal.</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d Penny said excitedly, looking at Darcy expectantly. She had a feeling that she was going to hear the word \u201cso\u201d from Penny a lot.</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d Darcy repeated, smiling.</p><p>\u201cDo you see him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur captain!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe captain who saved Melody House from the marauding Yankees who were going to burn it down,\u201d Matt reminded her dryly.</p><p>Darcy shrugged. \u201cI try just to get accustomed to a house the first few days I\u2019m in it,\u201d she told Penny.</p><p>\u201cOh! Of course. Let all the vibrations get through to you,\u201d Penny said, nodding sagely.</p><p>\u201cSomething like that,\u201d Darcy agreed.</p><p>\u201cSo, are there vibrations?\u201d Matt asked, seemingly polite.</p><p>She stared straight at them. \u201cThe place just trembles,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cWith?\u201d he prompted.</p><p>She widened her eyes. \u201cHostility.\u201d</p><p>Clint burst into laughter. \u201cThe living give out vibes, too, huh?\u201d</p><p>Matt stared at Darcy, the flicker of a rueful smile curving his lips. A remarkable transformation came over him. He was almost devastatingly appealing, when he looked so.</p><p>\u201cIf I\u2019m giving out hostile vibes, it\u2019s not with intent of malice.\u201d</p><p>From him, Darcy decided, that was the best apology she was going to get.</p><p>\u201cSometimes it\u2019s not easy to pinpoint just where vibes might be centered,\u201d she said, surprised to realize that she was smiling as well.</p><p>And that Penny, Clint, and Carter were all staring at them.</p><p>She rose, her movement not as fluid and easy as she would have liked. \u201cIt was a wonderful dinner. Thank you all very much. I\u2019ve just realized how late it has gotten. If you\u2019ll forgive me, I think I\u2019ll turn in for the night.\u201d</p><p>Matt, Carter, and Clint stood as one. A certain amount of courtesy seemed to have been bred into these men; it was as natural as breathing.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be fine,\u201d Carter told her. \u201cI\u2019ve slept in the Lee room. And I\u2019m still here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t even run down the stairs naked,\u201d Clint said with a wink.</p><p>\u201cThank the good Lord for that!\u201d Penny breathed.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d Carter protested. \u201cI look good naked.\u201d</p><p>Darcy laughed softly. \u201cWell, I imagine I\u2019ll be all right.\u201d</p><p>She was startled to see that Matt looked just a little concerned. \u201cI\u2019m in the house tonight, if there is any trouble, just scream.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, but you don\u2019t believe in ghosts!\u201d Darcy reminded him.</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI believe in the power of men to do evil,\u201d he murmured. For a moment, his strange deep gray eyes fell on hers. \u201cI\u2019ll be down the hall.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, bid them good-night, and headed out of the dining room and for the stairs to the second floor. She walked slowly, thinking it somewhat amazing that Matt Stone couldn\u2019t feel a thing regarding his house. Penny had asked about vibes. The house throbbed with them. Gentle, lost souls for the most part.</p><p>The only malice seemed to come from the Lee Room.</p><p>Upstairs, she decided on a quick shower, then brushed her teeth, and prepared for bed.</p><p>The room was cool, cooler than it should have been in summer. She ignored it, and the feeling of being watched.</p><p>She crawled into bed, somewhat exhausted. She fell asleep with the television on, watching a program on the history of Britain.</p><p>Deep into the night, she began to dream. She was herself, sleeping upon the bed, and yet she was not, for she moved, and moved within another persona. Fear clutched the heart of her sleeping self for a moment, for from the moment she felt the coming of the Other, she sensed the anger, a fury that was deep and dangerous. And then...</p><p>She was the Other, seeing, feeling, knowing everything he did.</p><p>A woman scorned...was a deadly one.</p><p>He came in deep thought and silence that evening, angry, but not at all sure, in his conscious mind, just what he intended. In the darkness, he stared at the house, and reflected on all that had been, and all that might come to pass.</p><p>The house...the majestic house sat as always. A place with as rich and deep a character as any living person. So it had been from the moment they had first broken ground. Time did nothing but add to the drama that must exist in such a place, as he well knew.</p><p>She was there.</p><p>He knew that she was there.</p><p>And there were things that must be said. Things that must be cleared, or ended, between them.</p><p>Still...</p><p>He stared at the house. And waited. He denied in his mind that he had come with any malice as to his intent.</p><p>His heart felt like stone. Seeds of ideas played deep down within his soul, truth and the physical essence of what must be banned from thought. What happened must happen.</p><p>At his sides, his hands flexed, eased, and flexed again, as if already slipping around the throat of the lover he knew to be inside.</p><p>Because a woman scorned...</p><p>Just might as well be dead.</p><p>Darcy awoke with a start, shaking. She had felt the past, as if it had entered into her. Felt not so much a person, but the fury and malevolence that had been part of a distant time.</p><p>She sat up in bed, and looked around the room, closed her eyes again, and opened them.</p><p>Whatever had been with her, whatever remnant of emotion, was gone.</p><p>And yet...</p><p>Something else was there.</p><p>Something, someone, quiet, stealthy.</p><p>Watching.</p><p>Waiting.</p><p>Chapter 4</p><p>4</p><p>\u201cW e all know why we\u2019ve come.\u201d Elizabeth Holmes\u2019 voice, though feminine, had a deep resonance. She wasn\u2019t exactly what Darcy had been expecting when she had heard that a local novice\u2014who had found her dedication to the occult in the last year\u2014had begged Matt Stone to allow her to run a seance. She wasn\u2019t theatrical. There was no turban wrapped around her head, and her eyes weren\u2019t dark and deep set and heavily lined with makeup to add to a mystical image. Rather, the woman was about fifty-five or sixty, slender, tall, elegantly slim, with nicely styled silver-white hair and pleasant, powder blue eyes. She looked like a typical businesswoman.</p><p>Only her voice might have fit the image of the eerie Gypsy fortune teller.</p><p>It seemed to fill the dining room at Melody House with a strange tenor, as if the walls themselves were part of a state-of-the-art speaker system.</p><p>And thankfully, the woman hadn\u2019t opted to rename herself. She wasn\u2019t going by Madame Zara, or anything like that. She was Elizabeth Holmes, a native of the northern Virginia area, and a real estate agent by day. Darcy had wondered at first if this medium wouldn\u2019t prove to be a slightly crazy friend who was convinced that she needed only to dress the part to have the powers. She seemed to be a very nice woman, and committed to what she was doing. Whether she really had any ESP or not remained to be seen.</p><p>And her opening was intriguing.</p><p>\u201cMelody House. She has stood upon this hill since the year of our Lord seventeen-seventeen. And she has, in her years, hosted both joy and tragedy. She is one of the few such surviving grand old homes of our nation still owned by descendants of her original builders. George Washington slept here!\u201d Elizabeth paused, smiling at the group gathered around the dining room table in the muted candlelight. \u201cGeorge got around, it\u2019s a wonder Martha wasn\u2019t a great deal more upset! But I digress. Washington wasn\u2019t her only well-known guest. The likes of Patrick Henry, Thomas Jefferson, and others of tremendous renown who lived in Revolutionary times came here as well, and later, she was hostess to many great statesmen and generals of another sad period of war\u2014Robert E. Lee, Stonewall Jackson, Jeb Stuart, and then, even Ulysses Grant and Abe Lincoln were thought to have taken rest at this place. Bullets once riddled the walls, and many still remain, from battles fought on the ground. Soldiers perished within her walls. Naturally, there were other sad occurrences here, not having to do with the specific pain of battle. There is the case of the beautiful Melody herself, daughter of the builder, distraught by her suitor\u2019s argument with her father. She is said to have been rushing to his defense when she careened down the stairway, only to die in her lover\u2019s arms on the foyer floor, just feet from where we now sit. There was Eliza, the daughter of General Stone, who might well have been poisoned by her rival, Sally Beauville, who was, when accosted, shot dead by the girl\u2019s father, who then faced the hangman\u2019s noose. Those are not all the stories. There are so many more. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMelody House has stood for nearly three hundred years, and in that time, we can only imagine all the dramas that have been lived\u2014and the passions and dreams that have perished here as well. They say that we are energy, and energy cannot be destroyed. Just as they say that Melody House is haunted. If ghosts and spirits are those who remained, their energy still fiercely alive due to trauma or tragedy, then there would be nothing more natural than the fact that Melody House indeed be haunted! Throughout the years, many have seen, or have believed they have seen, the ghosts of those tragic souls. In the early eighteen-hundreds, the courageous Andrew Jackson, later to be president of the United States, once spent only half a night here, and mentioned to someone later that he\u2019d rather face the British army again than spend another night at Melody House. Some swear there is a woman in white, still walking the halls. Others have seen soldiers, still, perhaps, fighting their long-lost battles.\u201d Elizabeth paused, something of a rueful smile on her face. \u201cSo. We shall all join hands, in the circle here created, and see what haunts or specters might wish to appear, to convey last words, wishes, or needs.\u201d</p><p>Electricity had long ago come to Melody House, but tonight, other than the lights attached to the cameras, there was no illumination within the dining room except for a single candle burning in the center of the table.</p><p>Darcy had already felt the cold. Whether Elizabeth was able to communicate with any of the \u201cenergy\u201d remaining in the house or not, Darcy again felt the sense of being watched. Whatever entity or entities remained at Melody House, they were watching. Across the table, she saw Penny shiver.</p> <p>Darcy felt herself nudged. Hands, yes, hold hands. She set hers upon the table. She was next to Jason Johnson, a local writer and historian, and, naturally, another friend of Matt\u2019s, and Clint Stone. Carter was on Clint\u2019s other side. Clint covered her hand warmly with his own, and seemed both amused and curious, as if he might have an open mind to the happenings. Matt was across the table, seated next to Elizabeth. He wore a look of carefully restrained impatience on his hard-sculpted features. Mae, the woman who had been welcoming to her when she had first walked into the Wayside Inn, was there, at tractively dressed and groomed, her round face split into a smile of excitement as she sat on Matt\u2019s other side. To round out the group, a pretty young woman with the improbable name of Delilah Dey, newly elected to the town council, sat between Jason Johnson and Mae.</p><p>David Jenner, of Jenner Electronics, also at the Wayside Inn when Darcy had first arrived, stood a distance from the group, with video and audio running. Darcy had considered bringing down some of her own equipment, but then had decided that this was not the night for Harrison Investigations\u2019 high-tech \u201cghost buster\u201d electronics.</p><p>\u201cWe have joined in a benign and caring circle,\u201d Liz said, addressing the spirits. \u201cWe wish to help with any problems, past or present. We have come in love and friendship, and wish to communicate with any presence in his house who desires a voice. Our minds and hearts are open. If there is a presence here, please let yourself be known.\u201d</p><p>Darcy felt a breeze at her nape, and she closed her eyes.</p><p>The fear had never really left her. Josh, who had been born with his unique perception, had not been afraid. But to Darcy, knowing that a very strange door was open was still a frightening experience. She knew that she had to allow the sensations in, but each time, it still seemed that cold fingers clutched her heart, and it was a fight to do what she knew she did well.</p> <p>They were not alone.</p><p>Talk to me, she thought in silence.</p><p>But then her eyes popped open as she heard a rapping at the table. She frowned, then felt a very physical force as the hands grasping around the table all seemed to tighten as one. Elizabeth spoke excitedly.</p><p>\u201cWe have made a communication! Rap again, please, if you are with us.\u201d</p><p>A tap sounded.</p><p>Darcy looked around the table, doubting that any of the ghosts were tapping. Matt, too, was looking around the table.</p> <p>The presence that had been so near Darcy and so apparent to her backed away. It didn\u2019t disappear; it simply receded.</p><p>\u201cAre you the spirit we call the Lady in White?\u201d Elizabeth asked.</p><p>There was no response.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps a soldier?\u201d</p><p>There was another rapping.</p><p>Matt was staring at Darcy, a certain hostility apparent in his eyes. Anger burst through her. He assumed that she was the one somehow managing to tap the table.</p><p>\u201cDid you live during Revolutionary Times,\u201d Elizabeth asked, earnest concern in her voice.</p><p>No response. Matt was still staring at Darcy.</p> <p>\u201cThe Civil War?\u201d Elizabeth asked softly.</p><p>Another rap.</p><p>\u201cYes! Yes!\u201d Elizabeth said, her eyes closed, her concentration intense. \u201cWe believe we know your story. You fought hard, so hard, for what you believed to be a just cause. You died here in this house. But you needn\u2019t stay and fight on. The war is over. Peace has come. And the outcome, in the end, was right. The only outcome that could be right, and the world has moved on. We seek now to offer true justice and equality for all men. You may rest in peace. Do you understand me? Can my words help you find rest?\u201d</p><p>Another rap, then a number of excited raps.</p><p>Penny whispered softly to Elizabeth. \u201cWe don\u2019t want our ghosts to go away! We just want them to be happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re only happy when they\u2019re at peace!\u201d Carter said, staring at Penny with a strange smile.</p><p>\u201cThis is so exciting!\u201d Mae whispered.</p><p>\u201cHush!\u201d Elizabeth said, moaning softly. \u201cWe\u2019ll break the very tenuous thread that is linking us to the entity.\u201d</p><p>There was a sound at the table, one of total impatience.</p><p>Matt.</p><p>\u201cPlease!\u201d Elizabeth said. \u201cCaptain...you are a captain, right?\u201d she said, addressing the ghost.</p><p>There was nothing.</p><p>\u201cLet us know. We\u2019re here for you,\u201d Elizabeth said.</p><p>There was another rap.</p><p>\u201cYes, you\u2019re a captain. A true gentleman, still fighting for his cause!\u201d</p><p>There was suddenly the sound of a shriek. The table jumped.</p><p>The sound had come from Delilah. \u201cSomeone...something touched my thigh!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe captain isn\u2019t such a gentleman,\u201d Clint suggested wryly.</p><p>The table jerked again.</p><p>Matt swore, and rose, breaking the circle. \u201cDavid, can you just go ahead and hit the lights?\u201d he asked.</p><p>The room was flooded with illumination. \u201cOkay, who was touching Delilah\u2019s legs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMatt, we had contact, real contact,\u201d Elizabeth said, dismayed.</p><p>\u201cOh, please!\u201d Matt said.</p><p>\u201cBy one horny ghost,\u201d Carter suggested, amused.</p><p>Matt glared at him. \u201cNot me!\u201d Carter protested.</p><p>All eyes naturally turned to Clint.</p><p>\u201cNot on your life!\u201d he protested.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m telling you, we contacted a Civil War soldier,\u201d Elizabeth said stubbornly.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d Penny agreed. \u201cAnd one of you destroyed our communication. Matt, you just can\u2019t have those two around the next time we have a seance. Delilah, we really have ghosts here.\u201d</p><p>Delilah shivered. \u201cYou do really believe that\u2014that a captain from the Civil War was in this room with us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI must say,\u201d Jason remarked, \u201cEveryone\u2019s hands were on the table.\u201d From the way he spoke, it was difficult to tell if he was impressed with the tapping, or merely curious as to how it might have been managed.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re ignoring our expert,\u201d David said, his video still running as he turned the camera on Darcy. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><p>She answered slowly with a careful shrug. \u201cI\u2019m afraid we weren\u2019t into it long enough for me to really give an opinion.\u201d</p><p>Jason smiled at her. \u201cBut what do you think? Or feel, or intuit, whatever. Is Melody House haunted?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe house has a tremendous history,\u201d Darcy said. \u201cJust being in it makes you feel an affinity for the past. Maybe that, in itself, makes a place haunted.\u201d</p><p>Clint laughed. \u201cBoy, you can talk your way around anything, can\u2019t you, Darcy? What if this were one of those game shows and you had to give a yes or no answer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s not a game show,\u201d Darcy said.</p><p>\u201cI was excited!\u201d Elizabeth said. \u201cI know that I made contact. And we\u2019ll set up to do this again. We\u2019ve only just begun. I don\u2019t think tonight would be good. I mean, I don\u2019t think we should try again so soon. Matt\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cForgive me, Elizabeth, but I don\u2019t want to set up any more dates right now. Bear with me. I\u2019m sorry. My opinion is that someone here managed to tap on the table\u2014and snag Delilah\u2019s leg in the process, whether on purpose or not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMatt, you are such a cynic!\u201d Penny protested.</p><p>\u201cOh, my,\u201d Delilah said, and she had a half smile on her face as she surveyed the men in the room.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s accusing either you or me,\u201d Carter told Clint, but with no malice.</p><p>\u201cYes, actually, I am,\u201d Matt said sternly, but he didn\u2019t sound overly angry, just impatient. He hadn\u2019t wanted anything to do with a seance from the beginning.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019m going to step outside for a minute, if you\u2019ll excuse me?\u201d Darcy said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get drinks and some snacks out,\u201d Penny told them.</p><p>\u201cDrinks!\u201d Carter said with pleasure.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give you a hand, Penny,\u201d Mae said. \u201cI\u2019m still all a-tingle! I\u2019m certain as well that Elizabeth made contact. Couldn\u2019t you feel it? The room was so cold. Oh, yes, there was someone with us. Something. Definitely. And Matt, you must do this again, please? Oh, you must, you must, you must!\u201d</p><p>Darcy heard the last as she slipped through the foyer and out the front door. She felt a little guilty for not offering to help Penny herself, but there were others there, and she\u2019d had the strangling sensation that she\u2019d needed to get out.</p><p>Night could be so strange. The summer sky like velvet, and so near the mountains, a million stars showing cleanly against the darkness. She leaned against the porch rail for a minute, inhaled deeply, and smelled the fragrant, flower-filled air that marked the season. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Then she sat back in one of the rockers, closing her eyes and savoring the soft, cleansing sweep of the breeze, and wondering herself just who had done the tapping.</p><p>She was startled a minute later as she felt a presence next to her.</p><p>One that was very much alive, and carrying a low-key scent of aftershave.</p> <p>She opened her eyes to see that Matt had joined her, taking the chair at her side. He watched her for a moment without speaking.</p><p>She turned back and stared at the night, not waiting for him to speak. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t believe that the tapping was a ghost.\u201d</p><p>With peripheral vision, she saw that a slow rueful smile curled into his lips.</p><p>\u201cThank God! I\u2019d have lost all faith in you if you had said differently.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh? I didn\u2019t realize that you had faith in me to begin with.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat all remains to be seen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve found that most people don\u2019t believe in the occult,\u201d Darcy told him. \u201cYet just the same, most people have a little voice of suspicion somewhere within them that suggests there might be something more between the living and the dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean they\u2019re open-minded?\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cMaybe minds aren\u2019t all open, but there\u2019s often a crack there somewhere.\u201d</p><p>He rocked thoughtfully for a minute. \u201cWe\u2019ve always had a military tradition in my family. I went straight into military schools and served in the army for several years. The dead bodies I saw all stayed that way. I first became a cop in the D.C. area, and though much of the country might suggest that the main crimes there are political, I can guarantee you, there were plenty of criminals in the area who know how to kill. Death is usually ugly, but always complete. Then, again, I\u2019m the direct heir to all those years of history, tradition, murder, and mayhem that have gone on at Melody House. If someone were to see something or have a link to the past, wouldn\u2019t it be me?\u201d</p><p>Darcy laughed. \u201cNot when there\u2019s not even one of those cracks in your mind to allow the dead to try to speak to you.\u201d</p> <p>He was silent again, rocking, then looked at her with one of the smiles that suddenly sent a streak of warmth to quicken her limbs whether she wanted to admit it or not.</p><p>\u201cWhen my dad died, I wanted him to speak to me somehow in the worst way. I was willing to do anything\u2014I would have crawled into the coffin to go with him, I loved him so much. It was just about the same with my grandfather, except that I was older then, and more aware that he had lived his years, good years, and gone on.\u201d</p><p>The emotion with which he spoke touched her deeply. Then he said, almost scowling, \u201cYou weren\u2019t the one pulling off that tapping sound, were you?\u201d</p><p>She stiffened, cold and indignant instantly. \u201cNo, I was not! And come to think of it, your words just now were quite interesting. You didn\u2019t mention your mother. Do you have something against women, Matt?\u201d</p><p>He turned to her, those strange dark gray eyes of his bearing something of a dangerous spark. \u201cI like women just fine, Darcy. Especially the really honest ones, and yes, they are out there. I didn\u2019t mention my mother because she died when I was a few months old, which didn\u2019t allow me a great deal of time to get to know her well.\u201d</p><p>She turned back to the night. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about you?\u201d</p><p>She gazed at him, and suddenly smiled despite herself. \u201cI don\u2019t have anything at all against other women.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, I meant, how did that crack in your mind turn into a gaping hole where the dead came rushing through to speak to you at all times?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was in a car crash with a really good friend. And he died.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then he spoke to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething like that.\u201d She thought that he was going to scoff at her again, but it seemed that he could be quite mercurial in his manner. She was startled when his hand lay upon hers where it rested on the arm of the rocker and his words came out soft and gentle.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think that sometimes people see people, or hear them, just because they so desperately want to hear that person speak again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut not with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish that was all that it had been,\u201d Darcy told him.</p><p>His eyes were almost affectionate, and he watched her with an appreciation that once again sent her heart thundering, her blood racing. And she was startled to realize that she hadn\u2019t been so strongly, almost magnetically, attracted to anyone like this in years. Maybe never. There was something in him beyond his extraordinary looks, and even the sense of power and security that he emitted. Something that made her want to crawl against his skin, stroke his face, and feel the warmth burst into sensations far greater. She was almost afraid to hear him speak, because the temptation to lean closer to him was so strong and aching. He was about to speak, and she was beyond fascinated to hear what he was about to say.</p><p>Except that words never left his mouth.</p><p>The great double doors at the front of the house flew open and Delilah came bursting out, full of smiles and charm.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you all coming in to join us for a drink and some snacks? I must say, Penny is just the most priceless human being in the world. In a matter of minutes she\u2019s created the most delightful spread in the kitchen!\u201d</p><p>They both stared at her rather blankly for a minute.</p><p>Darcy had liked Delilah from the start. She was a nice woman, and seemed intelligent, and really concerned about her job for the county.</p><p>At that moment, though, she could have hit her.</p><p>Delilah continued, \u201cOh, Matty, please, don\u2019t be upset about the silly tapping tonight. Penny and Liz are right\u2014we did come close to contact. Don\u2019t be angry with all of us!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not angry,\u201d Matt said, rising and sounding only somewhat impatient. \u201cWe\u2019ll join you.\u201d</p><p>Delilah started back into the house. Matt reached out a hand to Darcy. \u201cComing?\u201d</p><p>She accepted his hand and rose. It was as if there were sparks in his fingers. At that moment though, she wasn\u2019t sure that he noticed in the least.</p><p>\u201cMatty?\u201d she said lightly, arching a brow.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s what happens when you\u2019ve lived in a small town and known people too long and too well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d she murmured, wanting to ask, how well?</p><p>She refrained, and let him lead her on back into the house.</p><p>Penny had created quite a spread. Tea, coffee, mixed drinks, chips and dips, buffalo wings, Southern pecan pie, and other little desserts that Darcy knew she had prepared earlier in the day.</p><p>Darcy had never been less hungry, but since Penny had baked the pie herself, she toyed with a piece and opted for an Irish coffee\u2014made with decaf, Penny explained, so she wouldn\u2019t keep anyone up all night. Clint and Carter were in rare form, accusing one another of the tapping, Delilah was flirtatious, and Mae was excited, thanking Matt over and over again for letting her come, and begging to be invited if they tried a seance again. Liz scolded the boys for being silly when she was up to something important. Penny seemed a little quiet when she wasn\u2019t being the perfect hostess. David Jenner spoke about the different qualities of tape and film, and asked Darcy her preferences for her work. As they picked up the remnants of their meal, Delilah charmingly cornered Matt over a parking problem they were having near the town hall.</p><p>Darcy rinsed plates and put them into the dishwasher with Clint and Carter bringing in the used utensils and only half helping as they flirted. She had grown to like them both, even though she did get a start, feeling as if she were speaking with a modern-day Jeb Stuart every time she met Carter\u2019s eyes above the growth of his beard. Still, she was strangely keyed, and exhausted at the same time. When she could, she left the two of them dealing with the dishwasher and excused herself to Penny, Mae, and Elizabeth and escaped up the stairs to the Lee Room.</p><p>As she prepared for bed, she didn\u2019t feel a thing in the room. Not the slightest intuitive whisper of a presence. Not even the sense of being watched. Despite the fact that it was her business to discover just what was going on, she was glad she was ready for a good night\u2019s rest.</p><p>She fell almost instantly and soundly into a deep sleep.</p><p>And that\u2019s when she was awakened.</p><p>Darcy\u2019s head jerked up, because a silent scream seemed to enter into her mind, pierce through her subconscious, and seize her attention with a start. She looked around in the night as if she had been rudely prodded by a fire poker.</p><p>And there she was, a woman in a silver nightgown, standing in the doorway, hand to her throat in terror, issuing that silent scream.</p><p>Darcy saw the image in the dim and hazy light, saw the woman trying to bolt the door, but the force behind it, trying to enter from the hall, kept her from doing so. Then the woman came racing toward the bed, and for a moment, her eyes met Darcy\u2019s. There was a terrible plea within them. Help me!</p><p>It was as if the woman saw her there as well, and the plea was as silent as the scream, heard only in Darcy\u2019s head. But God, that scream! It sounded again within her mind, and the woman\u2019s beautiful lips moved, beseeching Darcy to hear her. But she couldn\u2019t understand the words; she knew only that they were desperate.</p><p>Because this wraith was running from death.</p><p>The killer, Darcy sensed, was coming from behind the woman. From the hallway. The bedroom door now burst open. Darcy could make out a hazy image of someone large and shadowy, shielded by the night, coming forward.</p><p>Toward the woman.</p><p>Then, above the woman\u2019s shoulder, she saw the flash of the knife, as clearly as if a spotlight hit the blade, and glinted from it.</p><p>The scream sounded again...more terrible than ever.</p><p>And the knife...</p><p>The knife flashed above Darcy.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t easily frightened. She communicated with the dead after all.</p><p>She sought them out.</p><p>But that night...</p><p>The malevolence was so strong, the danger seemed so real. The blade...it was threatening her, and she knew it.</p><p>She struggled for calm, for sanity, trying to convince herself that she was seeing nothing but an image from the past. There was no knife wielded by a dark and deadly murderer. Not now...what she saw was nothing but an image from the past. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But it moved again, glinting, and...dripping.</p><p>Dripping blood.</p><p>And she was terrified suddenly that if it touched her...</p> <p>Darcy sprang from the bed, screaming herself. The image wasn\u2019t fading, it wasn\u2019t a whisper, a hint of what had happened. It was pure evil. And something deeper than her intuition, than her acceptance, than any peace or calm she might have garnered over the years, deserted her completely. Terror, older and more basic than any human emotion, lit into her. She raced beneath the images, and tore out of the room, shrieking herself as she tore out of the room.</p><p>Darcy ran down the stairs, mindlessly fleeing.</p><p>She came to the landing and it was there that she heard her name shouted. She had probably been called several times before the sound had made its way through to her conscious thought.</p><p>Darcy stopped dead still, sanity filling her mind as quickly as it had deserted it.</p><p>She could have kicked herself, thoroughly.</p> <p>It was Matt Stone calling her name, rushing down the stairs. He was in boxers and a robe, haphazardly cast over his shoulders.</p><p>Even as she saw him appear at the top of the stairway, Penny, gray hair tousled, came rushing behind him in a pair of pajamas.</p><p>The front door burst open as Carter, Clint slamming into his back, appeared.</p><p>It was uncanny, almost as bizarre as the dream, or reality, she had just experienced, the way they all appeared so quickly, the entire household, within minutes. She almost felt as threatened, watching as Matt and Penny came down, and Clint and Carter came forward, and they gathered in the foyer at the foot of the stairs, alarmed, and then, as they saw her, saw that she was fine, disgruntled.</p><p>Matt Stone\u2019s eyes were hard and suspicious.</p><p>\u201cThe Lee Room sent you racing out in a panic?\u201d Matt said, an edge of derision in his tone. \u201cI thought you were the great ghost hunter.\u201d</p> <p>Clint was kinder. \u201cAre you all right, Darcy?\u201d</p><p>She stared at Matt. \u201cYes, and I\u2019m terribly sorry. I must have had a nightmare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGhosts don\u2019t scare her\u2014nightmares do,\u201d Matt murmured.</p><p>Penny was staring at her sagely. \u201cYou saw the lady in white.\u201d</p><p>Carter let out a long sniff. \u201cOh, Penny! I used to spend a lot of time in that room. I never saw any lady in white.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen her, Clara Issy has seen her, and she sent a bride running out of that room naked as a jaybird!\u201d Penny said indignantly.</p><p>Matt stared hard at Penny, Carter, and Clint, one by one, then turned around, starting up the stairs. \u201cTapping on a table is one thing,\u201d he said irritably. \u201cBut if you two have rigged that room somehow...\u201d</p><p>\u201cMatt, jeez, dammit, I wouldn\u2019t do that!\u201d Clint protested angrily.</p> <p>\u201cI sure as hell wouldn\u2019t! I don\u2019t believe in the damned spooks!\u201d Carter said.</p><p>\u201cI believe in them wholeheartedly. They are here,\u201d Penny said indignantly. Matt had already started up the stairs. Darcy watched as the others all rushed back up the stairs behind him. She followed, protesting.</p><p>\u201cLook, I had a dream. A nightmare. I woke you all. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Matt didn\u2019t appear to hear her. He slammed against the door of the Lee Room, causing it to open all the way. He, Carter, and Clint walked in. Where, of course, nothing was disturbed, and nothing at all was out of the ordinary.</p><p>Matt, however, appeared determined. He threw open the closet door and carelessly rummaged through her hung clothing, looking for what in the small space, she didn\u2019t know. He looked under the bed, then walked to the balcony doors, throwing them open as well. He walked out on the balcony, then came back in, arms crossed over his chest as he stared at Darcy.</p><p>\u201cJust exactly what did you see?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t see anything,\u201d she lied. \u201cI had a dream. That\u2019s all. And I\u2019m sorry. Terribly sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you should sleep in here anymore.\u201d</p><p>She felt a flicker of the fear returning, but held her ground.</p><p>\u201cI need to sleep in here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? You can explore this room\u2014or do whatever the hell it is that you do\u2014by day.\u201d</p><p>Darcy shook her head. \u201cLook, once again, I\u2019m really, really sorry. This won\u2019t happen again. I swear it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, Matt, you\u2019re just down the hall,\u201d Clint said, championing Darcy.</p><p>She flashed him a smile of gratitude, despite the fact that his words didn\u2019t seem to help any.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Matt repeated stubbornly.</p><p>\u201cLook, I swear to you, I\u2019m really not a mincing little coward. I had a dream, and it gave me a terrible start. But I need to stay in that room. All right, Matt, I disturbed you. And I realize that you\u2019re the sheriff and you have a day job, and I\u2019m really, truly, sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMatt!\u201d Penny put in.</p><p>\u201cWe can make a deal. If I come running out again, for any reason, I\u2019ll bow to your decision and get out of the room,\u201d Darcy said. She was pleading with a man who now wore a grim expression on his face. She hated pleading with him.</p><p>She didn\u2019t intend to leave the Lee Room, though. Yes, she\u2019d been scared out of a few years of life, but that might have been the exact intention of the malignant presence. She had lived with her gift for a long time. She could still be frightened, but she knew her own strengths.</p><p>She wouldn\u2019t let it happen again. She wouldn\u2019t give way to the fright.</p><p>\u201cMatt,\u201d Carter suggested sagely, \u201cyou\u2019re one stubborn cuss, but so is Miss Tremayne. If any one of us is going to get back to sleep, I suggest you let her go back to bed in the Lee Room. Remember, you\u2019re the one who doesn\u2019t believe in spooks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I do believe in the ability of man to do evil,\u201d Matt said, staring at Darcy.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right down the hall,\u201d she reminded him quietly. \u201cActually, the next room, I believe. At least, the office part of your suite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll I need is something to happen to you!\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cBad for business?\u201d she inquired sharply. \u201cI assure you, I\u2019m not going to become another ghost of Melody House,\u201d she assured him. \u201cAnd I\u2019m adult, responsible to myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, bad for business. And not only that, but whether you like it or not, I am responsible to Adam Harrison for you.\u201d</p><p>Just how well did he know Adam, Darcy wondered. \u201cAdam sent me,\u201d she reminded him, outraged. \u201cHe knows that I can deal with anything that happens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm. Deal with it\u2014by being terrorized and terrified?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t happen again,\u201d she repeated stubbornly. She was disturbed to realize that they had an audience for this discussion, and she was beginning to feel as if she were a child having an argument with an adult.</p><p>But apparently, she was winning.</p><p>He threw up his hands and turned away. Clint gave her a grin and a thumbs-up sign. Carter, too, was smiling beneath his beard. Only Penny looked a little perplexed.</p><p>\u201cYou are sure you\u2019re going to be okay?\u201d Penny asked softly.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d she assured the woman.</p><p>\u201cWell, then, I\u2019m going back to bed,\u201d Carter said. He gave Darcy a wink. \u201cI know the room well. It\u2019s brick and mortar, and nothing else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnother true disbeliever,\u201d Penny muttered.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, ma\u2019am,\u201d Clint teased, \u201cYou\u2019ve got a threesome of Southern gentlemen here, not only offering charm, but all our valiant resources in whatever way you may need. We\u2019ll be happy to kick ghost butt for you at any time.\u201d</p><p>Penny let out a sound between a moan and groan. \u201cGet out of here, go back to the stables and get to bed, both of you. You just wait until one of the ghosts does decide to make an appearance before you boys. You\u2019ll be sorry then!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOooh!\u201d Carter said.</p><p>It looked as if Penny was about to strike him.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going, we\u2019re going,\u201d Clint said. He turned toward the stairway, then told Darcy, \u201cSeriously, if Matt doesn\u2019t make it to the rescue quickly enough, all you\u2019ve got to do is whistle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood night, then,\u201d Darcy said, smiling at Penny and eyeing Matt. \u201cHonestly, I\u2019m sorry. It won\u2019t happen again.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, and walked back into his own room.</p><p>Penny was left alone to stare at Darcy. \u201cThey are real, and I know it!\u201d Penny told her.</p><p>Darcy smiled. \u201cWe have to find out just what is going on.\u201d She hesitated. \u201cWhen the dead become violent or destructive, it\u2019s because they want us to know something.\u201d</p><p>Penny shivered. \u201cI\u2019m here for you!\u201d she said valiantly. But her words came with a shiver.</p><p>\u201cHonestly, I\u2019m all right,\u201d Darcy assured her.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s getting worse and worse,\u201d Penny said. She glanced at the closed door to Matt\u2019s room. \u201cMaybe he\u2019s right. Perhaps you should sleep somewhere else, and spend time during the day in the Lee Room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPenny, this is what I do!\u201d she reminded the woman. \u201cI was taken by surprise tonight. Startled by the force of...my dream. But it\u2019s okay. Really.\u201d</p><p>Penny looked at her worriedly and sighed softly.</p><p>\u201cI swear.\u201d Darcy gave Penny a little kiss on the cheek, and slipped back into her room.</p><p>She closed the door behind her and leaned against it. The room\u2019s temperature seemed completely normal, the air as clear as a mountain morning. She was certain that she\u2019d experienced all she was going to for one evening. And now that the fear had receded, she was all right. Stronger, more prepared. And more determined and angry.</p><p>Melody House held many haunting secrets. But it seemed evident now that the lady in white was a victim of a deadly violence in the past, and the truth regarding her murder had never been discovered.</p><p>Darcy rinsed her face with cold water, surveyed her surroundings once again, and lay back down.</p><p>She began to doze.</p><p>Then, once again, she bolted up, wide-awake.</p><p>She felt the room, but there was nothing. And yet, something had awakened her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She slipped from the bed. The doors to the balcony were open; the drapes drifted in a soft and eerie white wave. Standing very still next to the bed, Darcy searched the shadows for an visions or apparitions.</p><p>Silence, nothing...</p><p>She walked to the open doorway to the balcony, ran her hands over the drapes. As she started out to the balcony there was a shift in the breeze. The white gauzy fabric of the drapes wrapped around her as she was seized by powerful and forceful arms, trapped in a vise of merciless strength.</p> <p>Chapter 5</p><p>5</p><p>A s they climbed the stairs to the apartments above the stables, Carter looked at Clint suspiciously.</p><p>\u201cHow did you do it?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Clint looked at him, startled. \u201cDo what?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe tapping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t doing the tapping. I thought it was you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe the ghosts,\u201d Clint said lightly.</p><p>\u201cYou believe in the ghosts now?\u201d Carter asked, amused.</p><p>Clint was silent a minute. \u201cPenny,\u201d he said thoughtfully.</p> <p>\u201cPenny!\u201d Carter said.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s the one who wants to prove that Melody House has ghosts,\u201d Clint reminded him.</p><p>\u201cYeah, but can you see Penny staging a bunch of tapping noises?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Carter asked with a shrug.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s Elizabeth\u2014the medium,\u201d Clint suggested with a laugh. \u201cShe needed to prove herself\u2014especially with a real ghost buster in the room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm,\u201d Carter mused. \u201cAnd what do you think of our ghost buster racing out in the middle of the night, just like the young bride?\u201d</p><p>Clint grinned slowly. \u201cI think it\u2019s a shame she didn\u2019t race out naked like the bride. That is one exciting woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMind your manners, son,\u201d Carter said, but he was amused as well. He shrugged. \u201cIt just strikes me as strange, all this. Darcy Tremayne is no flighty young bride. The woman is all cool sophistication\u2014and yes, too bad she didn\u2019t come down in the buff, just like the bride. But there\u2019s got to be something going on.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou are starting to believe in ghosts,\u201d Clint said, scoffing.</p><p>Carter shook his head. \u201cNope. I\u2019m starting to agree with Matt that someone is somehow playing tricks in the Lee Room. And I\u2019d damned well like to know why.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe people just feed off the fears and beliefs of others,\u201d Clint said, impatient. He grinned. \u201cYou and I have both enjoyed that room, a hell of a lot. Even Matt. Before the place was really opened up the way it is now, when Matt\u2019s granddad was still living and went in and out of Washington all the time. Hell, I had some of my best nights there. Nothing like impressing a young woman with a real historical house, a seduction in pure luxury\u2014with the threat of a ghost to make her all warm and cozy.\u201d</p><p>Carter nodded after a moment. \u201cYep, I\u2019ve had my share of nights there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd no ghosts?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd no ghosts,\u201d Carter agreed.</p><p>\u201cSo\u2014forget it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHard to forget when we\u2019re hosting ghost busters.\u201d</p><p>Clint shrugged. \u201cYou know, I have to admit that, over time, I\u2019ve heard from plenty of people that they have seen things. Clara Issy is as rock-solid and sane a woman as you\u2019re ever going to find. And she saw something in the Lee Room. And I\u2019ve heard other guests swear that they\u2019ve seen a soldier walk through the parlor.\u201d</p><p>Carter laughed. \u201cYeah, I remember one occasion. And the couple did see a Rebel soldier walk through the room\u2014he was headed out to take part in a battle re-enactment at Cold Harbor. Hell, I dressed up one time for a Civil War forum and scared half the people I knew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe point being?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is usually a logical explanation for ghosts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, I grant you that. So?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, I think someone is playing tricks. And if it\u2019s not you, and it\u2019s not me...then who? And why?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Clint said. He hesitated. \u201cBut I\u2019d damned sure like to find out just who and why myself.\u201d</p><p>With their guest in the house, Penny had taken up residence in the Stuart Room. It was two doors down from the Lee Room, in the ell on the left side of the house.</p><p>With both Matt and Darcy having returned to their rooms, Penny found herself standing indecisively in the hallway.</p><p>Might as well go back to bed. There was nothing else to do.</p><p>But she shook her head, staring at Matt\u2019s door. What on earth had to happen for him to realize that he had something very special in this house? Oh, he loved the house, and was a great one for historical value, she gave him that.</p><p>But they had something even...better. And more unique.</p><p>Turning her attention to Darcy\u2019s door, she folded her arms over her chest and swore softly beneath her breath. Why wouldn\u2019t the young woman just say what had happened? There were ghosts in this house. It was a fact. And certainly, it might be hard to prove it to the world, but there was no reason for Matt to fail to believe, to fail to use the experiments and happenings here to enrich the legends that already abounded. It would be so wonderful to be a real center of attention for a public that loved such stories.</p><p>Just what on earth was she going to have to do to prove her point?</p><p>She sighed and walked down the hall to her own room, opened the door, and then hesitated once again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here! I\u2019m listening!\u201d she said aloud. \u201cTalk to me, whoever, whatever, you are. I\u2019ll get your story out!\u201d</p><p>She waited, looking around the hall.</p><p>But the ghosts apparently had nothing to say to her.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care if you pull my hair\u2014or if you want to slap me in the face! Hey, leave the others alone. I\u2019m ready. I\u2019ll help you.\u201d</p><p>Still, there was nothing. The hall remained silent.</p><p>All right, seriously, just what on earth was she going to have to do?</p><p>With a disgusted sniff, she pressed the door open and went on into bed.</p><p>Darcy was caught in a terrible grip, all but smothered in the hold and the voluminous wealth of gauzy drapes tangled around her. Instinctive fear had seized hold of her as well, and she was ready to struggle, fight, and scream.</p><p>But the sound never left her lips, because a familiar voice interrupted her thoughts.</p><p>\u201cWho are you, and what the hell are you doing?\u201d</p><p>The voice, deep and very low, and all the more menacing for the quiet within it, cut into her mind like a knife.</p><p>And still, fear eased instantly.</p><p>She was silent and dead still for a minute, ruefully realizing her position.</p><p>Then she spoke.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m your unwanted guest, and I was merely on my way out to the balcony when a breeze blew, and suddenly I found myself rather rudely accosted.\u201d</p><p>She felt the vise ease from around her. For a split second, there was the simple warmth of Matt\u2019s hold, taut muscles slackening, and a pleasant sense of just being held, of life and vibrance, masculine aftershave, and an essence of sexuality that took her completely off guard. She swayed.</p><p>His arms were releasing her.</p><p>She quickly gathered her wits about her, and found steadiness on her feet while he worked to untangle her from the draperies.</p><p>She emerged facing him, flushed, hair tousled.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you sneaking around the balcony?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>Matt crossed his arms over his chest. \u201cA, it\u2019s my balcony. B, I wasn\u2019t sneaking around. Your turn. What the hell were you doing, sneaking around on the balcony.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparently, you heard me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo\u2014why were you out here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard something\u2014apparently you.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI believe that I heard you first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI beg to differ.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, this is getting ridiculous.\u201d</p><p>He arched a brow to her, implying that the entire situation of her being in his house was purely ridiculous.</p><p>She exhaled on a long sigh. \u201cLook, your night has been disturbed enough. I really wasn\u2019t making any noise.\u201d</p><p>He grunted.</p><p>\u201cSince there\u2019s no one on the balcony except for you and me, I believe it would be safe for both of us to go back to sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe balcony doors do lock,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cDo you keep yours locked?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>He shook his head.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I listen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn your sleep?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a talent,\u201d he said dryly. \u201cBut you should keep yours locked.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him for a long while.</p><p>\u201cWhy should I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause someone is playing tricks with this room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you believe the danger is coming from the outside?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t you believe that there\u2019s anything in the world that isn\u2019t black or white, visible to the naked eye?\u201d she asked softly.</p><p>\u201cI believe in a great big real world of gray,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cIf there is any danger in the house,\u201d she insisted quietly, \u201cI believe it comes from the inside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you want to stay in the Lee Room anyway?\u201d</p><p>She lowered her head, praying for patience. \u201cIf you\u2019re such a serious skeptic, why did you agree to let the company in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I know Adam. And I know that he can find any kind of sleight of hand out there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAdam also believes deeply in the occult. And in me,\u201d she added.</p><p>He shrugged, then brushed past her, entering the Lee Room again. For a moment, he stood with his back to her.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t tell you how many nights I spent in this room as a kid. And...even in the last few years,\u201d he murmured. There was something behind his words; she didn\u2019t know what. But then he swung around, staring at her again. \u201cLots and lots of nights. And nothing ever materialized before me. Nothing whispered in the dark. Nothing floated by.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She twisted her jaw slightly. \u201cI didn\u2019t tell you that anything materialized or floated by me. I merely said that I had a nightmare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. And the great ghost buster ran out screaming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a very bad nightmare.\u201d</p> <p>He walked over to her and she was startled when he set his hands on her shoulders, and his eyes, very dark in the shadows of night, were hard focused on her own. She was again aware of something evocative in the mere nearness of the man. He carried a richly masculine and seductive scent, and the simple touch of his fingers seemed like a caress. She told herself that it had been a long time since she had been this close to a man so vital and arresting, and so, it was natural that her senses should be jumping. It was a hard argument. They didn\u2019t jump that easily.</p><p>\u201cDarcy, I do believe that something is going on. But something real. And I don\u2019t want you hurt.\u201d</p><p>His words were honestly, sincerely spoken. The edge of hostility was gone between them, fallen off like a cloak.</p><p>She needed it back. She was standing in a bedroom in a flimsy nightgown, body brushing that of a striking male in his prime, clad in no more than boxers and a robe. If she moved just a little bit closer...half an inch, she\u2019d know firsthand if she had an equal effect upon him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m...I\u2019m not going to get hurt,\u201d she assured him. Her voice was thick.</p> <p>It seemed as if eons passed in which he didn\u2019t reply. In which they just stood there. Her mind raced in a fury of thoughts. He wasn\u2019t going to let her go. He was going to take that step closer. She should, of course, step away, but she wouldn\u2019t. She\u2019d feel the force of his arms enwrapping her again, but carefully this time, pressing her against his length. The palms of his hand would come to her face, fingers would caress her chin. Then they\u2019d be fused together, tangled in a web of touch and taste and sensation, and\u2014</p><p>He stepped back.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m right next door. You didn\u2019t disturb my sleep. Feel free to scream at any time.\u201d He offered her a wry grimace, then took another step back. She wasn\u2019t sure his stride was as confident as usual.</p><p>Or maybe she just wanted him to be a bit shaky, too.</p><p>\u201cSeriously, at the least disturbance, please, scream your heart out. I\u2019ll be right here.\u201d He smiled. Then his knuckles lightly brushed her cheek; for a moment, time passed again, with endless electricity and thought.</p><p>Then he was gone.</p> <p>Admittedly, Matt was tired.</p><p>Still didn\u2019t help the way that the morning completely sucked.</p><p>It started out with a desperate call from one of the area\u2019s three middle schools. The sheriff\u2019s department rushed in, prepared to deal with a possibly deadly, serious situation. It turned out that Brad Middleton, tall, lanky, fighting a case of acne, but usually a decent kid, had come in to class saying that he had a gun. Not a soul in the world was going to have a sense of humor about such a situation these days, which Brad couldn\u2019t understand, since he had come in packing a water pistol. After a discussion with the psychiatric counselor, the police counselor, the principal, and then his parents, he was shaking like a leaf by the time he reached Matt, and Matt wasn\u2019t feeling much better about the situation himself. The kid was going to have to go to court, and Matt didn\u2019t lie about the fact that he was facing consequences. Since Brad seemed truly repentant, he was certain that the boy would receive leniency, and he could make him feel somewhat better. But in the middle of his conversation with Brad, there was a holdup at one of the gas stations on the highway, and when they chased down the perp, he wasn\u2019t packing a water pistol. Still, surrounded by law enforcement vehicles, the man turned himself in. Thankfully, no one, including the perp, was shot.</p><p>That was all before noon in a town where days could go by, totally uneventful.</p><p>He wondered why he had ever wanted to be elected sheriff in the first place. But he knew why. He was like one of the ancient oaks that filled the forested area, born and bred to Stoneyville. He felt the responsibility of his family\u2019s claim to the place, almost as if he was rooted there as well.</p><p>And still, though he was worn and weary, he knew how to be sheriff. He knew how to handle juveniles, gun-wielding thieves, and even the older populace who complained that their neighbors were playing rock music or rap too loud.</p><p>What he didn\u2019t know how to handle was what he couldn\u2019t see, touch, hear, or stand up against, face-to-face. The other night had disturbed him deeply.</p><p>Just as Darcy Tremayne disturbed him.</p> <p>She could appear as unruffled as the most dignified queen, and yet last night, when he had first seen her after she\u2019d fled the Lee Room, she had been terrified. She had conquered her bout of fear quickly, and with a steely resolve that truly brooked no argument. Last night he had known that he wanted her out, far away where no harm could come to her. And yet he had respected something about her determination as well; hell, he was afraid every time he faced a lethal weapon\u2014he\u2019d seen what they could do. Didn\u2019t alter the fact that he meant to be just what he was, and be first in line to face any situation that arose.</p><p>He didn\u2019t believe in ghosts. Didn\u2019t matter. Something had scared her badly.</p><p>He\u2019d be damned if he could figure out just what was going on, or who was causing it. The seance could be chalked up to childish antics. As to the rest...</p><p>Pranks as well. Had to be. Or the imaginations of those who just wanted ghosts to exist so badly that they could create them. That worked with Penny and their streaking bride. But Clara? She was as down to earth as could be.</p><p>Why worry about it so much? He taunted himself. Half of humanity wanted to believe in ghosts, in anything that gave credence to a life after death. Let Melody House be haunted.</p><p>Ah, but there was the rub. Clara had either slammed herself into a door, or been hurt somehow. But he still had to question how the hell someone was playing games in the house. He\u2019d gone through the Lee Room endlessly, and had found nothing. No wires, no taps, nothing.</p><p>He\u2019d spent plenty of time in the Lee Room himself. Once, when Lavinia had been in love with the place. She considered the room exciting, for reasons he\u2019d never really fathomed. Clint, he knew, had taken a number of women to the house. Carter, too. Maybe for the thrill of being intimate with a woman when there was an element of fear. The point was, not one of them had ever been bothered by anything in the least amiss.</p><p>He realized he\u2019d been sitting at his desk at the station, staring down at a form, pen in hand. He gave himself a mental shake and concentrated. The true reason police forces lost so many good cops. Paperwork.</p><p>He forced himself to finish up, then called out to his secretary that he was calling it quits. It was well after six and he\u2019d been in for almost twelve hours.</p><p>He felt a sudden uneasiness.</p><p>It was too long to have been gone from Melody House.</p><p>Stoneyville might be a small town, but it had one of the most impressive and charming public libraries Darcy had ever seen.</p><p>Mrs. O\u2019Hara, tiny as a wren, but sprightly and quick with beautiful dark brown eyes peeping out from behind her bifocals, evidently loved books, and apparently felt a need to create comfortable and aesthetic surroundings in which they might be enjoyed. Beautiful plants and flowers adorned the numerous tables, and she proudly told Darcy that she\u2019d found the inviting, overstuffed chairs set about the library at various yard sales throughout the county. The library was entirely user-friendly, with signs to direct youngsters to their section, and adults to where they wanted to go as well. \u201cA library should be educational, of course,\u201d she told Darcy cheerfully. \u201cBut the point is that reading should always be a pleasure, and when one learns to read and love it, all kinds of knowledge just becomes available so easily. I do go on, but then, I do love books!\u201d She wasn\u2019t obtrusive, however, and quickly brought Darcy to the section on local history.</p><p>Luckily, many local writers had been intrigued with chronicling events around them. In the 1870s, a woman named Murial Moore had written about the sisters Darcy and Matt had discussed on her first day at Melody House. The family had been the Claytons, and their home had been located just outside of town. A Barry Brewster had been engaged first to marry Ophelia, the oldest of the brood, but had fallen in love with young Amy, the baby of the family. Amy had last been seen with her sister Ophelia as they walked through the east forest, ostensibly to visit neighbors on the far side. Amy had not been seen again alive. Barry had returned, and on the day that the majority of Amy\u2019s bones were discovered by a farmer walking through the woods with his dog, Barry had hanged himself from a tree near the brook. Ophelia had later gone insane, but lived out her life to the ripe old age of eighty-eight, prisoner of her family, kept in the barn. The barn, and family property, had burned to the ground.</p><p>\u201cHow are you doing, young lady?\u201d</p><p>Darcy started and looked up. Mrs. O\u2019Hara was standing by her side. \u201cI was about to make a cup of tea. Would you like some?\u201d</p><p>This was definitely a different kind of library.</p><p>Darcy smiled, then glanced at her watch. She hadn\u2019t gotten very deep into the history of the Stone family at all, but she felt as if she was carefully treading water between legends, truth, and experience as it was. And she was anxious to get back to the forest.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take a rain check on the tea, Mrs. O\u2019Hara, if I may,\u201d Darcy told her. \u201cI\u2019ll be back tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>She handed the book she\u2019d been reading to the librarian. Such an old volume wasn\u2019t allowed out of the library.</p><p>Mrs. O\u2019Hara assured her she was quite welcome, and told her that she\u2019d go through some of their old books and see what she could show her that might be important regarding the history of Melody House. \u201cI warn you\u2014any difficulty on research regarding Melody House and the area is not because there hasn\u2019t been a lot written. There are many, many books on the subject.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks so much for your help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely. I\u2019m quite convinced myself that the area is haunted. In fact, I have a friend you might want to talk to. Her name is Marcia Cuomo. She started working at Melody House right after Matt\u2019s grandfather died. And she quit in one day. She was convinced that she was grabbed and rousted about and nearly killed when she was thrown down a stairway.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh?\u201d Darcy said. She hadn\u2019t heard a word about Marcia Cuomo.</p><p>Mrs. O\u2019Hara was smiling wryly. \u201cAt the time, I\u2019m afraid, she had a reputation for having a nip or two while working. She didn\u2019t want Matt Stone thinking that she was drinking on the job, so she just told Penny she\u2019d had a fall. Apparently, when she tried to explain to a few people that there was a very physical ghost in the house, they didn\u2019t think her a credible witness in the least.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see. I\u2019d love to talk to her.\u201d At the counter, Darcy wrote down her cell phone number and gave it to Mrs. O\u2019Hara. \u201cCould you ask Marcia to call me at her convenience?\u201d</p> <p>Darcy left the library and searched for the little Volvo she had borrowed from Penny. Twenty minutes later, she was out at the stables. Sam, the old caretaker, was working there, and she assured him that she could manage saddling and bridling the horse herself.</p><p>Daylight still dappled through the trees, but with such a canopy of green, the forest trails and copses were dark and shadowy as early evening came to pass. Darcy rode to the point where she had dismounted on her last ride out, left Nellie having a lazy sip of water at the brook, and returned to her perch upon the log.</p><p>She hugged her knees to her chest, always a little afraid. She closed her eyes, concentrating on the sense of the past that had nearly come clear to her before.</p><p>First, the cold. It settled over the forest like a blanket. An inward voice, her own, called out in silent fear as the feeling wrapped around her. \u201cJosh!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here.\u201d</p> <p>It was the softest voice, or it was insanity. It was her own mind, working on different circuits, a mechanism to keep her from going mad.</p><p>She opened her eyes. The forest had darkened even further. She heard voices. One light, a girl\u2019s voice. She was laughing. Talking about the wedding, then apologizing. \u201cOphelia, you\u2019ve been so wonderful. He was to have been yours, but then, really, you\u2019d never met, and then we met, and Ophelia, I really do love him so very much! We\u2019ll find the right man for you, I know it. Maybe not in this little town, but you\u2019ll travel with Barry and me, and it will be wonderful.\u201d</p><p>She could see the sisters. They had come into view. Two ghost horses had now joined Nellie at the brook. Nellie lifted her head, snorted, shied away uneasily, seemed to get ready to run.</p><p>Both girls had a wealth of brown hair, and were clad in simple cotton dresses, petticoats beneath, heavy boots on their feet.</p><p>Amy dismounted first.</p><p>\u201cIt will be wonderful,\u201d Ophelia agreed softly from her saddle. Then she, too, dismounted.</p> <p>\u201cWhy did we stop here?\u201d Amy asked, cupping her hands to create a dipper so that she could draw a cool drink from the brook.</p><p>\u201cOh, I just wanted to show you something. It\u2019s in the water. You\u2019ll have to kneel down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get soaked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s summer, little goose. You\u2019ll dry.\u201d</p><p>Amy hesitated.</p><p>And watching the past replay itself in her mind\u2019s eyes in the haunted glen, Darcy wanted to cry out, to warn Amy, to help her. And instead, she sat frozen, in something of a trance, seeing the time repeat itself in the images of what had been, aware that she could only see, that there was nothing she could do.</p><p>\u201cSomething in the water?\u201d Amy repeated.</p><p>\u201cYes, get down, you\u2019ll see!\u201d</p> <p>It was a classic execution, carried out badly, brutally foiled. Once Amy was down, Ophelia drew the heavy ax from the pouch at the back of her saddle. Her first blow merely dazed Amy, who screamed and fell sideways into the water. Ophelia instantly saw that she had botched a clean kill. She began to work arduously, swinging the hatchet again and again while Amy screamed. The thudding of the blade against flesh, bone, muscle, and sinew seemed as loud in the forest as a drumbeat.</p><p>The vision came to life far too vividly. And, watching from the log, Darcy could bear it no longer. She began to scream as well. She forgot herself, running forward to the spot, thinking that something had to stop the terror.</p><p>Neither the dying Amy nor the determined Ophelia noticed her in the least. Time had come, and time had gone, and all that vision could give was an echo of the past.</p><p>As Darcy burst upon the sisters, the images faded. Shaking, Darcy fell upon her knees in the water. Yet, as she knelt there, shaking, horrified at Ophelia\u2019s vicious cruelty to her own sister, she saw the ghost.</p><p>Amy, headless, thrashing through the brush by an old oak, not twenty feet away.</p><p>Slowly, Darcy rose.</p><p>When Matt reached the house, he saw that Clint and Carter were out by the stables, arguing over Riley, a big buckskin quarter horse. He strode over to the two of them.</p><p>\u201cWe have more horses,\u201d he reminded his cousin and their friend.</p><p>\u201cAh, but only one glorious redheaded guest,\u201d Clint said. He carried his usual joking tone, but there was a slight edge of steel to it.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s out riding again?\u201d Matt asked.</p><p>\u201cAnd I say I should be the one riding out just to make sure she\u2019s doing all right,\u201d Carter said. He rubbed his beard and grinned. \u201cYou know, give her a real feel for the charm of the Old South.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell\u2014a beard gives you Southern charm?\u201d Clint scoffed.</p><p>\u201cHey, I\u2019m a land baron, and you\u2019re...a relation,\u201d Carter reminded him.</p><p>\u201cRight. I belong at Melody House. You\u2019ve got your own property. You just like to hang out here,\u201d Clint returned.</p><p>Matt ignored the two of them and took Riley\u2019s reins, then quickly swung into the saddle. He looked down at the two of them. \u201cI\u2019ll go.\u201d</p><p>They frowned at each other. \u201cThat\u2019s just not fair,\u201d Carter said.</p><p>\u201cAnd why not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re rude to her,\u201d Clint answered.</p><p>\u201cAnd she doesn\u2019t really look a damned thing like Lavinia,\u201d Carter said.</p><p>\u201cYeah, Lavinia is beautiful, but she\u2019s also got that pinched terrier look, you know? Like a woman who always wants more,\u201d Clint agreed.</p><p>\u201cWhile this one just seems to rise above it all,\u201d Carter said.</p><p>\u201cLook damned good in a nightgown,\u201d Clint said.</p><p>\u201cToo bad she doesn\u2019t sleep in the buff,\u201d Carter said, shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cHey, the woman is working for me,\u201d Matt said irritably. \u201cLay off\u2014she\u2019s not a one-night conquest here for anyone\u2019s amusement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho said anything about one night?\u201d Clint demanded.</p><p>\u201cWorking for you?\u201d Carter said, one eye half closed as he squinted up at Matt in the dying summer sun. \u201cBull. You don\u2019t believe in anything she\u2019s doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither do you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but I sure am attracted to our guest. And I\u2019m fascinated by her work, not at all ready to mock her\u2014the way that you are,\u201d Carter said.</p><p>\u201cSee you at dinner,\u201d Matt said, starting to turn Sam around.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d Clint called to him.</p><p>He looked back at his cousin. For a minute, Clint looked as he sometimes had when they were kids. Stubborn, and somewhat sullen.</p><p>Matt reined in, staring at him.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s no one-night stand for you either, Matt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s working for me,\u201d he repeated.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Like the air doesn\u2019t crackle when the two of you get close.\u201d</p><p>True enough. But he\u2019d be damned if he\u2019d have these two knowing anything and taunting him about his attraction to the ghost buster he didn\u2019t believe in.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s only here until she finds something...or until Adam arrives,\u201d he said curtly. Then he nudged Riley with his thighs and headed out for the forest. He hadn\u2019t asked any questions about which way she\u2019d ridden, nor did he look for any signs.</p><p>He was certain that he\u2019d find her right where she\u2019d been before, near the water, probably seated right on the same log.</p><p>\u201cCommuning\u201d with the forest.</p><p>A surge of irritation filled him, and yet he was anxious to reach her, and suddenly, deeply glad as well that he\u2019d reached the house when he had. There wasn\u2019t a damned thing wrong with Clint\u2014except that he was a spendthrift and a womanizer. He did have a way with the opposite sex, though. He was all smiles and courtesy, and made many an easy conquest. Carter, too, seemed to manage his share of affairs. And he hadn\u2019t seen either of them so determined in a long time. Hell, never determined enough to argue over one woman.</p><p>So?</p><p>If she was interested in one of them...?</p><p>She was working for him. Or rather, come to think of it, Harrison Investigations had paid for their exploration and examination of Melody House. It was his damned house. That gave him the right to have a proprietary feeling.</p><p>Maybe it didn\u2019t.</p><p>Hell, he had one anyway.</p><p>He reached the copse, the brook, and the place where the fallen log lay in the forest. Nellie, wide-eyed, stood in the brook. The horse wasn\u2019t drinking, just standing. She seemed to be in a strange trance, swaying oddly in the water.</p><p>Matt looked hurriedly to the log. Darcy was not there.</p><p>Then he heard a sound. A grunting. His eyes were diverted close to one of the old oaks. He stared incredulously, dismounting from his horse by rote, staring at Darcy.</p><p>She was on her hands and knees, digging furiously. Covered in mud. His austere, regal-looking guest was smudged with raw earth from head to toe, and she was totally oblivious to the fact that he was there.</p><p>She\u2019d dug a really big hole with only the help of a club-shaped log and a sharp stone.</p><p>\u201cDarcy?\u201d</p><p>As he said her name softly, she gave out a cry of triumph.</p><p>And in the eerie light of the dying day, she raised a human skull high into the air.</p><p>Chapter 6</p><p>6</p><p>S he had found it!</p><p>Elation roared through Darcy.</p><p>\u201cDarcy!\u201d</p><p>Her name was called out so roughly that she nearly dropped the skull. She looked to see that Matt had come upon her in the woods.</p><p>\u201cMatt! I\u2019ve found it!\u201d</p><p>But one look at his face assured her that he didn\u2019t share her pleasure in the discovery. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat the hell are you doing?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cMatt, it\u2019s her skull\u2014the younger sister\u2019s skull. The story was true. History. We all knew that she had been murdered by her older sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPut it down immediately,\u201d he admonished harshly.</p> <p>She stared at him, confused, frowning.</p><p>\u201cDown, put it down!\u201d</p><p>Slowly, she did so. \u201cWhat on earth is the matter with you?\u201d she demanded. \u201cLook, whether you believe in any of this or not, you don\u2019t have to be such a jerk. I\u2019ve found her skull. We can bury it with her body. That would just be human decency.\u201d</p><p>He hunkered down by her, looking at the skull that now lay on the freshly dug earth. He didn\u2019t touch it, but stared at her again. \u201cKeep your hands off it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got a human skull there. And I\u2019m the sheriff.\u201d</p><p>She looked at him then in total disbelief. \u201cBut...this murder took place well over a hundred years ago! What are you going to try to do\u2014arrest someone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, how do I know that? We both know the story.\u201d</p><p>He waved a hand in the air, dismissing her outrage. \u201cAre you a bone expert as well, Miss Tremayne?\u201d</p><p>Anger took slow root in her, and, along with it, a sinking feel of desolation. Dammit, he knew it. He knew as well as she did that the skull had been in the earth for eons. And there was something about the way he was hunkered down, near her, yet a million miles away. He wasn\u2019t going to admit that she had found the skull, that she was right, and that she had somehow come upon it through extrasensory perception. At the same time, he knew in his gut that was just what she had done. He drew away. He didn\u2019t believe in her power, but he was still repulsed by it, maybe at some instinctive level of his own.</p> <p>\u201cAll right. There\u2019s your skull. What are you going to do about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to see that it\u2019s properly handled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt belongs to a poor, young, innocent girl who was brutally murdered by someone she loved and trusted. To handle it properly, you merely need to get the records out and see that her head is buried with her body,\u201d Darcy said angrily.</p><p>\u201cYou can guarantee me, beyond a doubt, that this is her skull?\u201d he said scornfully.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s not the way the law works.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re being ridiculous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m doing my job.\u201d</p> <p>Darcy stood up and dusted her hands on the sides of her jeans. \u201cFine. You do what you have to do,\u201d she said, and started walking away from him.</p><p>She felt his hand fall upon her upper arm. Hard. When he swung her back, there was too much force to his touch. She stared at his hand, stared at his eyes. He released her instantly.</p><p>\u201cDo you go around finding body parts all the time and just burying them because you\u2019re convinced they have to be ancient?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo to which?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe both know whose head this is!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhether we do or not, human remains have to be handled properly. Legally.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes fell. Maybe he was right on that. And maybe she was just dismayed by the horror she had seen in his eyes when he had watched her with the skull.</p><p>\u201cAll right, Sheriff. I bow to your very logical and legal reasoning. If you\u2019ll excuse me, though, I think I\u2019ll head back for a shower.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, those gray eyes still on her. She felt a strange hurt inside, and she was furious with herself. Matt Stone had been a hostile force from the very beginning. She\u2019d been an idiot to let any measure of attraction form between them. And yet...attraction didn\u2019t form. It existed. It existed right then as they stood in the woods, as they stared at one another. Something in the air, alive, electric, static. She\u2019d never felt such an urge to come close to another person, press against him, feel his arms wrap around her. She was certain that the sheer heat dancing in the air emitted from him. And she was equally certain that no matter what his raw desire, the static erupted from his mind, like a wild wind that pushed away, even as it pulled.</p><p>She suddenly wanted to shout that she wasn\u2019t a leper.</p><p>But in his mind, maybe she was.</p><p>She turned and walked away, striding to Nellie without looking back. She mounted, turned the horse toward home, and never turned her head.</p><p>Anger filled her. To anyone else, she might have just proven that she did have certain psychic abilities. Not Matt. He wouldn\u2019t begin to understand her job. That yes, Harrison Investigations could come in and prove if something wasn\u2019t right\u2014if there was indeed a fake, a trickster, creating ghosts or hauntings for their own purposes\u2014be it simple amusement or something illegal. But when phenomena were real, they tried to find out why, what had happened, why ghosts couldn\u2019t move on. And then they tried to help them.</p><p>She\u2019d helped Amy. And the idiot, Matt Stone, should realize that it meant she could discover the truth about his house. And that it should be discovered, because it was something even stranger than she\u2019d ever encountered before.</p><p>Something far more sinister.</p><p>And it didn\u2019t seem that even Josh could help her here, as he so often could.</p><p>When she could solve a mystery and help heal a lost soul, she loved what she did. Which was wonderful, because far too often her work was frightening, and she felt such deep sympathy so many times that it was painful. And yet, a day like today was so incredibly rewarding!</p><p>Except that it had to come with a man like Matt Stone!</p><p>The great unbeliever.</p><p>She knew that he hadn\u2019t moved.</p><p>And he wouldn\u2019t move, not for a while.</p><p>He would watch after her long after Nellie took to the trail.</p><p>It was late, but it didn\u2019t matter. Matt sat at his desk back at the station, doing nothing.</p><p>He\u2019d called out a few of his men, and the skull, and the surrounding dirt, though disturbed, had been properly boxed for forensic study.</p><p>Because he\u2019d known that Darcy was right about the identity of the skull, he\u2019d had it taken straight to friends at the Smithsonian who specialized in the field, and he knew that he\u2019d get a report back in the morning that the skull was well over a hundred years old.</p><p>So he found himself sitting in his office, doing nothing. His door was closed. At first, he\u2019d pretended to be busy with paperwork. Then, he\u2019d given up all pretense, sat back in his chair, laced his fingers behind his head, and stared into space.</p><p>The image returned to him again and again.</p><p>Darcy, digging.</p><p>Darcy with the skull.</p><p>Her cry of triumph.</p><p>It gave him the creeps.</p><p>But not really, and it should have. She was fucking weird. No. Yes.</p><p>She was, and it didn\u2019t matter. She was still inordinately attractive to him, arresting. More. Seductive. He should want nothing to do with her. He wanted to be closer to her, instead. He wanted to talk to her, know what made her tick, understand her background. He loved the sound of her voice, the inflections in it. He was equally fascinated by every flick of her eyes, her slightest movement. She could have so much energy, move so quickly and fluidly, and then show such cool poise and reserve that she was maddening.</p><p>If he stayed at work, he could keep some distance. He needed distance. If anything was really hauntingly mysterious, it was the allure she seemed to hold for him. So she was good-looking\u2014many women were. All right, so she was sinuous, sensual, and fluid as a cat. Other nearly-perfect people also had such seductive quality.</p><p>Not like this woman.</p><p>Maybe it was the secrets, or the knowledge in her eyes.</p><p>Why the hell couldn\u2019t he be repulsed. Christ, she\u2019d been digging in the dirt like a gopher!</p><p>There was a rap on his door.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>He pulled his feet off his desk top as he called out.</p><p>Deputy Harding, charged with the graveyard shift, opened his door and peeked in. \u201cEverything all right?\u201d</p><p>Alan Harding was young. A good age to keep peace between midnight and eight. Sandy-haired, blue eyed, nearly six-four, and capable of controlling the occasional rowdy drunks who called for law enforcement at that hour.</p><p>\u201cYeah, everything is fine. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust...er, checking. You don\u2019t usually sit around in here this late, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>Matt arched a brow. \u201cHow late?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nearly two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA.M.?\u201d</p><p>Harding grinned. \u201cThat is my shift.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, sure.\u201d Matt scratched his cheek. \u201cYeah, I was just leaving.\u201d</p><p>He rose, taking his hat from the peg on the wall. \u201cCall me if\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I need you, yessir,\u201d Alan said, a cleft in his chin deepening along with his smile. \u201cHeard you found an old skull out in the woods today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t find it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe psychic found it, huh?\u201d</p><p>He stiffened. Why the hell did he hate it when people referred to Darcy as a psychic? That\u2019s what she claimed to be.</p><p>He didn\u2019t believe in psychics. Refused to believe in psychics.</p><p>\u201cMiss Tremayne, from Harrison Investigations, found the skull, if that\u2019s what you mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe must be for real, huh?\u201d</p><p>Matt settled his hat on his head. \u201cShe can read, and she ap parently likes libraries. That\u2019s why the name of the company has the word investigations in it, Alan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure\u2014sir!\u201d Alan said.</p><p>Matt shook his head and walked out, throwing over his shoulder, \u201cCall me if\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf we need you,\u201d Harding finished for him again.</p><p>Matt muttered beneath his breath. When he exited the station, a low-lying fog sat on the ground. And despite himself, he suddenly felt an intuition of unease. What the hell had he been doing at the station so late?</p><p>Deepest night.</p><p>He should have been at Melody House for hours now.</p><p>His strides were long as he headed for his car. And he was damned glad that he was the sheriff right then because he far exceeded the speed limit as he headed home. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It should have been an entirely triumphant and peaceful night for Darcy. She knew that she had done well. And usually, to go with some of the torture that her existence afforded her, she was able to feel something like serenity and satisfied pleasure at a job well done.</p><p>But that night...</p><p>Dinner should have been fun. Penny, Clint, and Carter had all been excited about her find. Clint and Carter had vied for her attention, Penny had studied her like a wise old sage who had known her stuff and was proud as a peacock herself for being the one to insist that Harrison Investigations be called into the house. Even old Sam Arden, caretaker, had seemed to eye her with a new respect. It was almost as if she had become the accepted matriarch of a village, having proven her mettle. None of them seemed ill at ease with her, though both Clint and Carter kept asking, in different ways, just how she had managed to do it. She refused to explain exactly how, just saying that she had researched the story at the library, and put two and two together. Clint, however, shook his head.</p> <p>\u201cTwo and two don\u2019t naturally add up to four in a forest! You\u2019re amazing. Simply amazing. You do have a special and unique gift.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got to explain how you really found the skull,\u201d Carter told her.</p><p>\u201cResearch,\u201d she told him. But she couldn\u2019t help a smile. \u201cThat\u2019s what we do\u2014investigate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat ghost in the Lee Room is going to be sorry!\u201d Penny commented.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you\u2019ve really got to be careful,\u201d Clint said, somewhat worried and subdued then. \u201cI mean, maybe it\u2019s a ghost that doesn\u2019t want to be known, and it will be more violent, because it\u2019s afraid of you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Carter had said, frowning.</p><p>\u201cGhosts only come out because they want to be discovered,\u201d Sam Arden had surprised them all by saying. And when they had stared at him, he had continued with, \u201cLike serial killers. They always taunt the police because somewhere, in their subconscious, they want to be caught.\u201d</p><p>There had been a few minutes of unease, but then Clint had announced that he had some special champagne. Darcy accepted her glass and slipped out to take a walk to the porch. Clint found her there.</p><p>\u201cYou know,\u201d he\u2019d told her softly, \u201che\u2019s only such a jerk because he\u2019s afraid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMatt. He\u2019s afraid.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve lost me. Matt is really afraid of ghosts?\u201d</p><p>That brought Clint\u2019s devastating, deep-dimpled grin into play along with a spate of laughter. \u201cMatt? Afraid of ghosts? No. He\u2019s not even afraid of whackos with guns and knives. He\u2019s afraid of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would he be afraid of me?\u201d</p><p>Clint had joined her against the rail. Tall, lean, charming. And very handsome. She wondered why she couldn\u2019t feel an almost painful physical draw to him.</p><p>He\u2019d reached out to smooth down a stray strand of her hair.</p><p>\u201cBecause he really likes you\u2014and respects you\u2014but doesn\u2019t want to. Because you\u2019re a beautiful redhead.\u201d</p><p>That had brought a smile from her. \u201cThank you. That\u2019s sweet. It\u2019s also bull.\u201d</p><p>Clint shook his head. \u201cHis wife was a total bitch. She was insane over him at first, but he couldn\u2019t be deterred from the house or his work, and she just wasn\u2019t the kind who could live long without playing hard\u2014all over the globe. Then she started to think that he had lost interest in her, and she tried to make him jealous. Wrong move with Matt. It just turned him off completely. But she did have her ways. So...when the marriage went all to hell, it left a nasty taste in his mouth.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFor redheads.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA certain kind of redhead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. I\u2019m a kind of redhead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool. Smooth. Sophisticated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSophisticated, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA kind of sophistication that no one can acquire if it isn\u2019t just natural. So...Matt is going to act like a jerk. That\u2019s why you should forget all about him, and realize just how attractive I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re very attractive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re just not interested. Still...you change your mind, I\u2019m around. Ready to rush to your defense at any moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHopefully, I won\u2019t need any defenders.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t crush my crusading spirit!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I do need a defender, I\u2019ll be delighted that you\u2019re there. How\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA crumb!\u201d Clint told her, but he was grinning, and he slipped an arm around her shoulder as he led her back into the house.</p><p>Penny had hot tea and scones prepared when they got inside. When it had hit eleven, Darcy had yawned, excused herself, and gone to bed. Her room had seemed cold and cavernous that night, despite the warmth outside.</p><p>She\u2019d opened the balcony door, certain herself that nothing evil was coming from outside the room.</p><p>Whatever watched her had a place within.</p><p>She watched a late-night show on TV, giving it halfhearted attention.</p><p>Something waited within the room.</p><p>She did so herself.</p><p>Well after midnight, she was still certain that Matt hadn\u2019t returned. And still, some time after that, she drifted to sleep.</p><p>Soon after, she began to dream again, entering into the world of another. Vaguely, in a subconscious place, she knew that she dreamed once again. This time as another...</p><p>Before, she had dreamed as a man, coming to the house.</p><p>This night, she entered the soul of the woman who had waited.</p><p>She\u2019d not begun the evening with any great sense of fear or urgency. Indeed, she\u2019d been angry herself, and ready to fight, argue, speak her mind\u2014and change her life. She\u2019d not thought a thing about going to bed that night.</p><p>She was certain that he would not come. All that raged between them was too close, too tense, too passionate.</p><p>She was furious!</p><p>By the dim light, she sat down at her desk and began to write. He could do what he wanted. She couldn\u2019t stop him.</p><p>But he was going to pay.</p><p>Yet, as she set out to write, pulling out a sheet of stationery with her personal emblem, she paused. It was a beautiful night. Cloudless, allowing even the gibbous moon to cast a serene glow over the rolling hills of the countryside beyond the window. For a moment, a sense of hesitance settled over her. There was so much here, so much between them.</p><p>Ah, but...</p><p>She had been betrayed. He had betrayed her.</p><p>She started to write. From somewhere near, she heard the whinny of a horse. A dog began to howl and bark. Oblivious she set to her task, determined. The die had been cast.</p><p>Then...</p><p>A sound.</p><p>Darcy awoke with a start. The sense of sharing another\u2019s dream, of being that person, reliving the past, fell from her as if she had doffed a cloak from her shoulders.</p><p>And yet, blinking in the shadowed room, she struggled to fathom what had awakened her. Had it been the sound she heard within the dream?</p><p>No...</p><p>She listened, and was certain that she had heard something.</p><p>Out on the balcony.</p><p>Footsteps, slow, quiet, furtive.</p><p>She bit into her lower lip, silent and dead still for a moment. Then she slipped from beneath the covers, stepped out of the bed and rose, slowly, quietly. Her bare feet made no sound on the soft Persian rug beneath the bed. She prayed that a floorboard wouldn\u2019t creak.</p><p>Carefully, she moved across the floor to the balcony. Standing behind the softly billowing drapes, she looked out. Nothing. Nothing, but the moon in the sky, and a gentle breeze. She moved out, one slow step at a time, and still, nothing.</p><p>With a sigh, Darcy frowned and walked to the railing.</p><p>Then she heard it again. Something...just a sound, a scratch...from behind her. She started to turn.</p><p>She saw nothing but a whir of darkness. She felt the quick whack of something hard against her head like a bolt of lightning out of the blue.</p><p>Not hard enough to knock her out. Hard enough, however, to make her stagger, fall to her knees, cry out.</p><p>And see nothing more...</p><p>She brought her hand to her head, more furious than hurt. The whack hadn\u2019t been at all deadly, and her head wasn\u2019t spinning. As she staggered up, the balcony doors next to her own burst open.</p><p>And there was Matt. Clad in Calvin Klein black knit boxers, and nothing more. Staring at her as if a lunatic had decided to knock on his door in the middle of the night.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you doing?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>Perhaps it looked a little strange. She realized that she was standing directly in front of his French doors, disheveled and barely dressed. She\u2019d opted for her favorite type of nightgown that night rather than the long T-shirts she often wore to bed. It was white, diaphanous. Sleeveless, with Victorian lace around the bodice. Her hair was all over. She might have resembled the mad Lady of Shalott.</p><p>\u201cI...there was something out here,\u201d she said.</p><p>He lifted a brow, leaned back slightly, and crossed his arms over his chest. \u201cThe ghost is hanging around on the balcony?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think so?\u201d</p><p>He was mocking her, of course. Aggravated herself, she too crossed her arms over her chest and tried for a look of dignity. \u201cI heard something out here. It woke me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid it whisper in your ear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop that, will you? I think that there was someone out here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlive or dead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone. Alive.\u201d</p><p>He continued to stare at her skeptically, but then stepped past her. She could hear him swearing beneath his breath, but he did at least seem willing to take a look around. He walked the length of the balcony. When he disappeared around the corner, she felt a strange sense of loss and a chill invading her. Time seemed to stand on end, to stretch out, and the cold\u2014despite the balmy night\u2014to seep into her bones. How long could it take him to walk the circumference of the wraparound balcony? Granted, it was a big house, but....</p><p>She stared to the left, watching the corner where he had disappeared. Hesitantly, she walked toward it herself, then nearly screamed to high heaven when she felt a touch upon her shoulder. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jumping half a mile, she swirled around and saw that Matt was back.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t find anyone,\u201d he told her, his voice polite, and still curt.</p><p>\u201cWait a minute here,\u201d she said angrily, planting her hands on her hips. \u201cYou\u2019re the one so convinced that there aren\u2019t any ghosts, that some kind of real, outside force is causing the \u2018haunting\u2019 here.

He stepped forward, lifting her chin, searching out her eyes. \u201cYou were hurt?\u201d</p> <p>She shook her head, still feeling his fingers against her cheek and chin. He was too close, but she didn\u2019t draw away. \u201cI\u2019m not...hurt. But there was someone here, and...well, I don\u2019t...it was just a way for the person to disappear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA real person?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot like Clara. She said that a ghost struck her in the face. You didn\u2019t fall...trip...or bang your head another way?\u201d</p><p>There was concern, and more. Maybe he was feeling a certain triumph, as she had that afternoon. He didn\u2019t believe in ghosts. Well, he had ghosts, whether he wanted them or not. But this time, he had been right. A real person had been on the balcony.</p><p>\u201cThere was someone\u2014flesh and blood\u2014out here tonight,\u201d she said. He hadn\u2019t moved. The scent of his skin seemed very rich, and ridiculously intoxicating. She didn\u2019t want to move. She wanted to lay her head against his bare chest.</p><p>He was closer, somehow.</p><p>His finger-feathered over her hair then, touched down gently on her temple. \u201cWhere...uh...were you struck?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI...uh...side of the head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there a bump?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you dizzy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d A lie, but her state of physical rubber had nothing to do with the knock on the head.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re all right? Really all right?\u201d</p><p>His breath caressed her forehead. Her lips were dry. She nodded, still not moving. His hands still cradled around her head. Her lips could almost brush his flesh.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m...fine.\u201d</p><p>Then he tilted her chin again, looked into her eyes. A hint of five o\u2019clock shadow teased his cheeks. His dark hair was sleep-mussed. His body seemed to emit heat like a radiator, making the night chilly, and the length of him a beacon. Tension gripped his muscles, appeared with his every breath. She could hear his heart beat. And her own.</p><p>\u201cThis would be crazy,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cYou bet,\u201d she agreed, and yet, still, neither of them moved, and the breeze seemed to grow cooler, making the rise of tension between them a delectable, taunting warmth.</p><p>Then the warmth of his breath touched her ear and just the timbre of his voice created a cascade of hot blood rushing through her veins.</p><p>\u201cAre you feeling crazy?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cTotally insane,\u201d she whispered back.</p><p>His hand molded around her chin again and a moment later, his mouth covered hers. It should have been a slow and gentle kiss, a getting-to-know-you kiss, and it started out that way. But the very movement erupted almost instantly into something else, deep, consuming, passionate, ravaging. Maybe it was the way his arms wrapped around her, or that last eighth of an inch between their bodies was pressed away, the feel of the full length of his form, the sheerness of her clothing, the raw feel of the so nearly naked man. Their mouths clung together, tongues became weapons of seduction, and just standing in the night, a violent hunger seized them both, and the kiss was the most sweepingly carnal she had ever experienced, the very movement of his lips, teeth, and tongue seeming suggestive of everything that was to come. It wasn\u2019t her, Darcy thought, realizing that she responded with blatant urgency, almost awed, wanting everything and more. Life didn\u2019t usually offer her such a feast, and their exchange had been the truth, for this was lunacy. But there was no thought about tomorrow, what she did, what he did, thought, or believed. Tomorrow did not exist, for as he held her, as his mouth seared her, as the force of his arousal pressed and drummed and taunted, there was nothing she could care about except for the culmination of the storm of wonder that swept through her with such fantastic force.</p><p>Darcy felt as if she melted against him, as simply as dew against the grass when the sun rose, and she was grateful for and almost oblivious to the arms that held her, lifted her then, and carried her through the balcony doors. His room, not the Lee Room, she noted vaguely, too aware of the feel of his sinew in his arms, the cut of his face as he made his way to the bed. The surroundings didn\u2019t matter. The sheets were cool and clean and smelled of fabric softener, and the mattress was deep and inviting, but not even that mattered; steel at her back wouldn\u2019t have mattered because his lips had trailed from hers to her throat, and she was still in the sheer gown, which seemed no barrier. The feel of his mouth closing over her breasts, the searing wetness over and through the fabric, and his tongue chaffing her nipple sent streaks of lightning ripping through the length of her. Her fingers tore through her hair as he leaned against the bed, lowering himself against her, she was aware of his hands at her side, long, powerful, handsome hands, as arresting as...</p><p>The feel of his mouth, almost agonizingly erotic over the fabric of her gown, lowering over her abdomen, lowering still. And then those hands, those glorious hands, slipping at last beneath the fabric, and his touch on her thighs, so intimate, too intimate, and yet all that they must be for this insanity, stroking and caressing into the core of her. And then the touch of his tongue, blazing with intensity, arresting every vein and muscle within her, creating fire within every fiber of her being. And at that moment, there wasn\u2019t the least surge of hesitance, of inhibition, within her, not a thought that they were not seasoned lovers, that this kind of shattering contact should take time, knowing, caring....</p><p>There was simply response, for every action, a reaction, and she followed every law of physics, spiraling, arching, twisting, and gasping with every electric jolt of lightning that filled and awakened her. She had to touch, stroke, taste, caress and evoke in return, and in minutes, they were tangled flesh and limb. She flourished, as if long accustomed to an arid life, her world had suddenly been filled with the thrill of a waterfall, and in the end, she wanted so much that it couldn\u2019t be, that a hoarse and gasped out cry of impatience ripped from his lungs, and they were truly melded together. The shock of his body thrusting fully into her own sent another wave of climactic ripples tearing through her, and then the night became nothing but movement, urgent, yearning, fast and spinning. Man and flesh, bed beneath, the world rocking, and vague impressions of the tension in his face, the fire in his eyes, the hunger...and then...a catapult stiffness, ejaculation, and her climax, so violent, volatile, complete and almost devastating that she cried out, shuddering like leaves blown in winter, again, ripples of aftermath sweeping over her again and again until they subsided slowly to nothing more than the gasps of breath that still tore from her lungs.</p><p>And then...</p><p>The truth of shadows. The balcony doors, still open to the night. The massive size of his bed, the books on the shelves nearby, the very real feel of the person beside her, the one who had mocked her, who didn\u2019t believe in ghosts, who had stared at her in such horror when she had found the skull.</p><p>She stared at a mote of shadow dust, almost like a miniature star, dancing in a pale ray of moonlight. He stroked a hand through her hair, brushing it from her face, and despite what she had always thought of as the honesty of her life, she curled against him with a soft groan, burying her face against his chest, far from the gray eyes that seemed to see far too much within her, in daylight, shadow, and even darkness.</p><p>\u201cSh!\u201d he murmured softly, and she realized that reality had come back far more quickly to him, or perhaps, it had never left him.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think someone is downstairs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone...up to something?\u201d she asked a little anxiously, and rose against him enough to see his face. He was smiling, a slow, lazy, rather self-satisfied smile. He cast an elbow behind his head to rest against it as he studied her.</p><p>\u201cActually,\u201d he murmured politely, only a trace of amuse ment in his tone, \u201cI think that we might have awakened the living and the dead.\u201d</p><p>Shadows could never hide the flood of crimson that came to her cheeks. \u201cLord! I\u2019m sorry,\u201d she mumbled quickly, suddenly thinking to escape.</p><p>His arm was around her. She wasn\u2019t moving.</p><p>\u201cAre you?\u201d he asked quietly. \u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d For a moment, he was sincere, and there was something in his face and in his tone that caught at her, heart and soul. But then he added, \u201cDo you really think we might have awakened the dead?\u201d</p><p>And she knew that in his way, he still laughed at her.</p><p>She pushed away from him, meaning it, and he released her. It was frustrating to discover that she couldn\u2019t find her nightgown, it had become so entangled in the covers.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d he said softly, drawing her back. And she was forced to meet his face, and he asked, \u201cAre you sorry? Because, most sincerely, I am not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do think I\u2019m a fake,\u201d she informed him, a frost of ice coming to her words. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He shook his head. \u201cNo. Never a fake.\u201d</p><p>She arched a brow. \u201cAre you referring to life\u2014or sex?\u201d</p><p>Again, that slow lazy smile that might have broken a hundred hearts. \u201cBoth, maybe.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s no future here,\u201d she said, somewhat primly.</p><p>\u201cDoes everything have to have a future?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cNo, maybe not. Could you move? You\u2019re on my nightgown.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoing somewhere?\u201d</p><p>She nodded firmly. \u201cBack to the Lee Room.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen I\u2019m coming with you.\u201d</p><p>She was startled, staring at him. He shifted, producing her gown. Then he rose, found the black knit boxers and a terry robe, and looked back at her. She stared at him, shimmied back into the gown.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s go.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure if this should be...a habit,\u201d she said.</p><p>He smiled. \u201cNever thought of it as a habit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re incredibly exasperating,\u201d she told him.</p><p>But he paused then, in front of the balcony doors, and again, his thumb and forefinger touched her chin.</p><p>\u201cMay I come with you to the Lee Room, if you find it so important to sleep there? We will, however, lock the balcony doors. I don\u2019t feel like entertaining any tricksters in the middle of the night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you shouldn\u2019t come. Maybe I make great bait for the trickster,\u201d she said.</p><p>Something hardened in his jaw. \u201cYou\u2019re not bait, and whatever the hell you do, don\u2019t go thinking that way.\u201d He turned, drawing her with him. Inside, he locked the balcony doors.</p><p>\u201cYou left your balcony doors open,\u201d she pointed out.</p> <p>He shrugged. \u201cNo one has ever disturbed anything in my room. I simply don\u2019t want anyone in here. With us.\u201d</p><p>She was amazed to realize that just the sound of his voice made her shiver again. Thrill throughout.</p><p>Then he walked toward her. \u201cTrust me, no one will disturb us tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>She was drawn back into his arms. \u201cDarcy, let it go, please. Give us this. Let it be normal. Not normal. Incredible. But still...let tonight be. Just be...normal.\u201d</p><p>And then...</p><p>The feel of his lips.</p><p>And then everything that was raw and real and somehow still magic started all over again, and yet, this time, a thought crept into the blindness of passion.</p><p>If only...</p><p>If only this could be a reality...</p><p>If only she really were...</p><p>Normal.</p><p>Chapter 7</p><p>7</p><p>T he day was a surprise, Penny thought, sipping her coffee and staring over the rim at Clint and Carter.</p><p>But then, all days were a bit different now, and she loved it. Darcy Tremayne had changed everything at Melody House. This, however, was amusing.</p><p>\u201cHow on earth do you think that she found that skull when no one else ever could?\u201d Clint said, shaking his head as he added jam to his English muffin. \u201cCreepy, huh? She must be for real.\u201d</p><p>Carter shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s been out there for a long time. Maybe it\u2019s just that no one else ever really looked for it.\u201d Carter scratched his bearded chin. \u201cLuck, maybe. Pure luck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous, gentlemen!\u201d Penny protested. \u201cShe\u2019s the real thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, come on, Penny. No one really has extrasensory perception,\u201d Carter argued.</p><p>\u201cShe sure has a lot else,\u201d Clint murmured.</p><p>Carter offered a dry laugh. \u201cBut I think she\u2019s off-limits to us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe definitely has a thing for her,\u201d Clint agreed.</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d Penny said.</p><p>They both stared at her as if she were totally blind.</p><p>\u201cMatt,\u201d they said in unison.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Penny said, settling back.</p><p>\u201cAnd she\u2019s a redhead,\u201d Clint said, as if that made it all beyond comprehension.</p><p>\u201cTall,\u201d Carter said.</p><p>\u201cReally built,\u201d Clint said.</p><p>\u201cRegal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally, really, built!\u201d Carter repeated.</p><p>Penny leaned closer to the table. \u201cWell, boys, I do think that you\u2019re both out of luck. Because I think that she may have a bit of a thing for Matt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d Carter said.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d Clint agreed.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Penny demanded.</p><p>\u201cBecause she believes in ghosts,\u201d Clint explained, smiling broadly. \u201cMatt is like old Stone Mountain. He\u2019ll never accept the idea that she might be psychic. Now me, I\u2019m charming\u2014and I have an open mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, the whole thing can\u2019t be real\u2014can it?\u201d Carter said, frowning. But then he forgot the main question. \u201cMatt\u2019s still in lust, my friend,\u201d he advised Clint. \u201cLust can last a long time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, it had to be lust with Lavinia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, we were all in lust when she first showed up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLavinia,\u201d Penny intervened, \u201cwas a bitch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, but she had us all fooled,\u201d Clint teased.</p><p>\u201cMe? Never,\u201d Penny assured him. \u201cShe didn\u2019t have what it took to hold on to Matt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, sleeping around never did make a marriage work real well,\u201d Clint drawled sardonically.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think he cared by then,\u201d Penny said.</p><p>\u201cStill, kind of uncanny\u2014two redheads,\u201d Clint said.</p><p>\u201cOne a bitch\u2014and one a psychic,\u201d Carter said amused. \u201cClint, surely, this field still has to be open to us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMatt will never really get involved with her,\u201d Clint agreed. \u201cI, on the other hand, would not care in the least if such a woman communed with the ancients on a daily basis. I\u2019d just thank heaven above that she was mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClint Stone, that was a lovely thought, and quite surprising from you,\u201d Penny applauded him.</p><p>\u201cYeah, and it\u2019s bullshit. You just think she\u2019s hot,\u201d Carter said.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d Clint argued.</p><p>\u201cWell, let\u2019s face it. She may be smooth, intelligent, cool, and lovely, but Matt is in lust. She\u2019s really not his type,\u201d Carter said.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>They were all startled by the voice that spoke from the kitchen doorway. Penny actually jumped up, nearly knocking her chair over. She hadn\u2019t looked out yet, but it was nine in the morning and Matt was usually long gone by then.</p><p>Carter had the grace to flush. He shrugged. \u201cShe\u2019s a psychic,\u201d he said again, as if that explained his take on everything.</p><p>Penny, anxious to defuse a possible situation, broke in quickly. \u201cMatt! I thought you\u2019d left for the office long ago. I\u2019ve never seen you home so late in the morning.\u201d</p><p>Clint looked down at his muffin. \u201cDarcy does resemble Lavinia,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cNot in any way, shape, or form,\u201d Matt said.</p><p>\u201cCoffee?\u201d Penny offered brightly.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m late. I\u2019m going in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny word yet on the skull?\u201d Carter asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll find out when I get to the station.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe all know that it belongs to our poor, decapitated miss of eons past,\u201d Carter said.</p><p>\u201cMost probably,\u201d Matt agreed. \u201cIt\u2019s still a human skull, and there are laws regarding human remains.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Carter said, looking at Matt. Then he shivered. \u201cScary, huh? Maybe Darcy knows things about all of us that we would just as soon no one knew.\u201d</p><p>Matt turned around and walked out.</p><p>\u201cThat is scary,\u201d Clint murmured.</p><p>\u201cOh, come on, why?\u201d Penny tsked.</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s quite true, we all have skeletons in our closets,\u201d Clint told her.</p><p>Shirley Jamison was, just like clockwork, at the front desk when Matt walked into the sheriff\u2019s station. She smiled at him, apparently not at all curious as to why he was late. Apparently, everyone had known that he\u2019d worked late hours the night before.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d She was a slim, attractive woman of about thirty-five, and truly pleasant. She loved her job, her husband, her two perfect little children. She\u2019d been born in Stoneyville, and never had the least temptation to move elsewhere. Her husband, Ray, was a building contractor, and just as pleasant as Shirley. Matt used to wonder if there was something artificial about their constant cheer, but oddly enough they seemed to be a genuinely happy couple.</p><p>\u201cGood morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard you were here until the wee hours,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect you in so soon, but I was actually about to call you at home. Digger called.\u201d</p><p>Digger was actually Darrell Jordy, an exceptional osteoanthropologist who worked at the Smithsonian museum in D.C.</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d Digger was a busy guy. He was given bones to study by police agencies across the country, not to mention the FBI. Matt had never expected him to get to the skull the first thing when he had walked in that morning.</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cJust what you thought. The skull carbon dated at about a hundred and fifty years. He said he already told you it once belonged to a young woman, between fifteen and twenty-five years of age. Seems she fits right in with the old story about the jealous older sister who hacked up her younger sibling.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cGlad to hear it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve already called from the newspaper, too. They want to know when you\u2019re planning to see that the head gets buried with the body.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly who called?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMax Aubry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d</p><p>Aubry would sensationalize the whole thing. Granted, they were a small town. And thankfully, in the local paper, small events were often given headlines. He still dreaded the kind of attention the skull was going to receive.</p><p>\u201cOh, come on, Matt! It is a great story. Sad, but now with an ending.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAubry will play up the ghost bit, then hone in on Darcy and Harrison Investigations.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWell?\u201d</p><p>He threw up his arms. Was the whole place ghost story crazy?</p><p>Crazy.</p> <p>The word ricocheted in his head. He was definitely crazy. In lust. Who the hell had said it, Carter or Cliff? Did it matter? He wished that was the long and short of it. Every time he learned something new about her, he only wanted more. There was so much about her that was an enigma, but then looking into her eyes he could see the honesty, the fear, and most of all, the terrible wariness. As if any closeness was an enormous risk. Well, it was. She was...different. And he did have a guard up against her, it just wasn\u2019t doing him much good. The second he had risen, he had wanted nothing more than to lie back down beside her, feel the cool silk of her flesh, watch those eyes open, vulnerable if only for a second. She was truly the most sensuous and incredible lover he\u2019d ever known, and maybe that had been half to do with him, because being with her made him just want so much more, and to be so much more himself. His world had changed because of a ridiculous chance meeting in the night.</p><p>A bizarre incident at that, because she was the ghost catcher, he was the rational man, and she had been convinced that there had been a real person out on the balcony, and he sure as hell hadn\u2019t found evidence of anyone when he had searched. When they\u2019d opened Melody House to the public, they\u2019d had alarms installed in the main house and the stables. Nuts. It was all simply nuts, and getting worse. And it was going to get worse. He simply would not accept the kind of sensationalism the media would try to put on this latest event. He could not accept that some kind of doorway to the dead had allowed her to find the skull.</p><p>But then, she had said that research had led her to it. Pray God she remembered that when talking to the papers. But he could see again the way she had looked, digging frantically, and then producing the skull. An image that had chilled him...</p><p>He should have thought of that before last night. But what the hell did either of them think that they were doing? It was sex in the twenty-first century. Most adults indulged on a whim now and then. He\u2019d had his own share of too-casual relationships. Could be it was just another. Temptation and hormones and human instinct.</p><p>Except that it wasn\u2019t.</p> <p>\u201cMatt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be in my office,\u201d he said, a bit too gruffly. Shirley looked at him, puzzled. He couldn\u2019t explain.</p><p>Darcy woke at a quarter of eight, realized that Matt was gone, and tried to reflect on both the wonder and idiocy of the night gone by. But thinking about it merely made her head hurt.</p><p>Granted, she didn\u2019t have much of what could be called a social life, and as far as a sex life went, it certainly had been nonexistent for a very long time. That had been mainly her choice. But her college years had made her feel somewhat punch-drunk, and since she was afraid of the outcome of any involvement, it had seemed prudent to be a very private person. She had a loving family and good friends at Harrison Investi gations, who understood what it was like to be different. She had never imagined such an overwhelming physical attraction to a man, and she had not envisioned that she could feel such an emotional pull to someone like Matt Stone.</p><p>The thought that last night had been a serious mistake came only this morning, when Darcy awoke. And along with it, of course, was the knowledge that she was going to get hurt, because she didn\u2019t seem able to put the relationship in any kind of perspective. She felt a tremendous aching for what happened with Matt to be something that could go on...and on. Amazing, when he had truly been such a jerk when they had met, how living in a man\u2019s house, knowing those who knew him well, could give so much insight to his life, and his true character. She hadn\u2019t felt this way since...well, maybe forever. And it was so foolish. She felt elated, having pushed so much that could be incredible between a man and a woman to the back burners of her existence, and also miserable, because a simple night had created a fantasy, a new excitement, and it was something that she well knew could never really be. Her bed now contained the simple, subtle scent of the man within it, memories of warmth and fire, passion and a closeness that remained staggering in its brief intensity.</p><p>She started to rise, then decided to screw the notion. She didn\u2019t have to be anywhere\u2014other than exactly where she was. The day might look a little better and everything might make more sense if she just had a little sleep.</p> <p>She would close her eyes for a few minutes more, and maybe get, at the least, just a bit more rest.</p><p>Yet even in a subconscious state, falling into a far deeper sleep than she had imagined, she knew when the dream state came, when the actions and emotions of the past slipped into her, almost as if she slipped into the skin of another. And she knew instantly, on that distant plane, that she had now encoun tered two people. First, a man, then a woman, and now a man again. And that what trauma had taken place between them had reached a heated pinnacle here, in this room, where she slept. She could see herself, below, at the door, though she couldn\u2019t make out face or form, because she was seeing from his eyes, as if the memories of long ago had entered her mind as completely as they had, at one time, touched his reality.</p><p>Staring up at the house, he knew that it was empty, except for her. And so he stepped inside, quietly closing the door behind him.</p><p>He knew the house. Knew those who usually peopled it, surrounded it, called it home, or laid a claim to the place. And he knew where they all were. Just as he was aware that she would have come here, thinking she had the right to do so.</p><p>She didn\u2019t have the right.</p><p>She had no rights.</p><p>And what she might have imagined had come to her through him!</p><p>There was nothing that night to bar his entry. As he had known. He didn\u2019t care if she had heard the door close. She would know he was there soon enough. He stood in the foyer, staring up the stairs, hands rapping idly against his pockets. He felt the bulge in the one. Ah, yes, the item he had stuffed in it earlier. A strip of leather from the stables. He pulled it from his pocket, stretched it out between his hands, tightened it until the leather was taut...</p> <p>Easy to do. He was a strong man. Actually, quite strong.</p><p>Stronger even than he appeared.</p><p>No...</p><p>A protest echoed in his head. A protest against himself.</p><p>He gritted his teeth, and the whole of his body was as taut as the strip of leather between his hands.</p><p>Slowly...</p><p>He forced himself to relax.</p><p>And he looked to the stairs again....</p><p>\u201cDarcy! Darcy! Are you all right dear?\u201d</p><p>Jostled from the dream, Darcy winced, bolting up. The rapping on her door sounded like thunder, and she rued the interruption with a deep dismay. She\u2019d begun to see so much so clearly. And if only, she thought, she could see these images through, she would have the answers.</p><p>\u201cDarcy!\u201d</p><p>\u201cPenny, I\u2019m fine. Just overslept, that\u2019s all!\u201d she called out.</p><p>\u201cThank God! I thought that maybe the ghost of the Lee Room had...well, never mind. I don\u2019t mind telling you that it makes me quite nervous, you sleeping in there alone at night!\u201d</p><p>Darcy stared blankly at the door, wondering if Penny would feel better if she realized that she hadn\u2019t actually been sleeping in there alone last night.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I\u2019m fine,\u201d she repeated.</p><p>\u201cWant me to bring you up a tray?\u201d Penny asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, no, I\u2019ll be right down, thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDarcy?\u201d Penny persisted beyond the door.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just had to tell you. You were so right\u2014and so ingenuous! The skull you found was the poor younger sister. You\u2019re incredible! Well, we assume it must be her, of course, I mean, I think that\u2019s the only story we have about a young girl of that age. We have some other female ghosts, of course, but they all have their heads. You\u2019re amazing!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Penny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll get her buried\u2014well, we\u2019ll get her head buried with her body!\u2014and she\u2019ll be able to rest in peace, or something like that, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething like that, yes,\u201d Darcy called.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ll be down in my office if you need me. I\u2019ll leave fresh coffee in the kitchen for whenever you want it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Penny.\u201d</p><p>She heard the housekeeper walk away as she closed her eyes. She opened them again. She wasn\u2019t going to be able to fall back asleep, and it wouldn\u2019t matter anyway, she didn\u2019t think. She had lost the slender cord of just exactly whatever it was that she could sometimes hold.</p><p>Darcy looked around the room and held still.</p><p>The presence was there, but...</p><p>In the background. Watching. Not coming forward. Waiting?</p><p>For what?</p><p>Josh, where are you? Why can\u2019t you help me in here? She thought.</p><p>No answer. She spoke aloud. \u201cJosh?\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t that she\u2019d ever had complete control of finding him. He was her spirit guide. John, a Shoshoni friend and another of Adam\u2019s employees, had once tried to explain to her. There beside her, with her, because he had loved her so dearly as a friend when he had lived.</p><p>And because, somehow, with his death, he had passed his strange gift\u2014or curse\u2014on to her.</p><p>\u201cJosh, you helped me in the forest, why not here?\u201d</p><p>But she knew. The sense of violence and bitterness that lingered in this room was too strong. Suddenly, she was anxious to get out herself.</p><p>Strange, Matt just being in the room had changed it so much....</p><p>She wasn\u2019t here to feel secure and safe. She was here to solve the puzzle.</p><p>She rose, unnerved, and wondering why. She had long ago accustomed herself to ghosts.</p><p>It was the living who could hurt you!</p><p>She had heard that often enough. And she had believed it, still believed it.</p><p>But then again...</p><p>She had never experienced things quite the way they were happening in the Lee Room.</p><p>There was no way not to talk to Max Aubry. Though Matt didn\u2019t return the call, Aubry caught him at one o\u2019clock sharp, right when he was heading out to the Wayside Inn to get some lunch.</p><p>\u201cMatt! Hey, I\u2019ve been trying to get you on the phone.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYeah, sorry, I had a late night,\u201d Matt said. Aubry reminded him of a weasel. The guy was an inch or so taller than he was, which made him around six-four, but he was so skinny he appeared taller. Maybe because he couldn\u2019t seem to get an inch of either fat or muscle on his bones, he shaved his head for a fiercer look. Didn\u2019t help. He just looked like a hungry ferret.</p><p>\u201cTell me about the skull.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just heading out for some lunch.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGreat. I\u2019ll join you.\u201d</p><p>Max stared at him.</p><p>\u201cBusiness appointment, huh?\u201d Aubry said. He knew Matt didn\u2019t like him. It wasn\u2019t really a personal thing. Matt just thought that journalists were supposed to report the news, and not make up what they\u2019d like to be the story that went with it.</p><p>\u201cGive me something. I\u2019m going to head out and interview that young lady working for you. I just thought that you might want to give me a word or two first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d Matt stood still, feeling the summer sun. \u201cMiss Tremayne is working for a firm called Harrison Investigations. They look into so-called hauntings. They do research on an area\u2014and reveal when those who call themselves psychics are using fog machines to create ghostly images. We have a lot of folklore around here, which is usually based on fact. Every schoolkid in the area has heard about the headless girl in the forest. Miss Tremayne made use of the library to investigate the murder, determined where it must have taken place, and found the missing skull.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo the ghost will no longer haunt the forest, is that right, Sheriff?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was never of the persuasion that a ghost did haunt the forest,\u201d he said firmly. \u201cAnd if you write anything different, Aubry, you\u2019ll have a lawsuit on your hands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, come on, Matt!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean it, Aubry. You caused a poison scare here when Julie Cristopher had a stomachache one afternoon. The donut shop nearly had to shut down because you stated it was the last place she had eaten.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was the last place she had eaten.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut she hadn\u2019t been poisoned! She told the doctor at the hospital that she\u2019d drunk milk she probably shouldn\u2019t have because her brother had left it out on the table overnight!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cKids! What are you going to do?\u201d Aubry said, brushing the complaint aside.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a kid. And if you print a bunch of fiction, Aubry, I\u2019ll see you in court.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, all right! You sure have got some hang-ups, Sheriff. Ghosts are good for a place like Melody House.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy in hell does everyone believe that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause the rest of the world has a sense of romance! But excuse me, go have your lunch. I\u2019m sure your Yankee investigator will be a lot nicer. Sheesh!\u201d</p><p>Aubry turned and walked away. Matt was tempted to call him back and somehow tell him not to go after Darcy.</p><p>But he couldn\u2019t.</p><p>Aubry had every legal right in the world to interview whoever he wanted.</p> <p>He watched Aubry go, damning himself. He should have given the man some time, given him a better story, and he might have left Darcy alone. He considered calling Darcy to warn her. Tell her...what? Tell her that no matter what the hell she really believed, she had to tell Aubry that she didn\u2019t believe in ghosts?</p><p>Swearing, he headed for his car. As he slid into the driver\u2019s seat, he was startled to feel a strange urge to head somewhere, other than the Wayside Inn.</p><p>Library.</p><p>His fingers froze around the keys in the ignition. He could have sworn that he heard the word as clearly as if someone had spoken out loud to him.</p><p>Matt groaned, leaning his head against the steering wheel. They were all going to make him crazy. Had to be something on the back burner of his mind coming forward. And now, for some stupid reason, he kept hearing it echo.</p><p>Hell, no, he wasn\u2019t getting caught up in all this.</p><p>Angry with himself, he started to drive toward the Wayside Inn.</p><p>Then turned.</p><p>Darcy hadn\u2019t intended to go back to the library that day, but Penny was so determined to talk about the skull that she didn\u2019t think she could stay in the house. It wasn\u2019t that she didn\u2019t like Penny, and like her very much. She simply didn\u2019t want to try to explain just what her \u201cextrasensory\u201d perceptions were. She didn\u2019t understand it all herself\u2014how on earth could she explain it all to another person?</p><p>Then, as well, both Clint and Carter had been in the house. And they had wanted to talk. Clint had been charming, but too curious, winking and asking her if she could help him find the cuff links he had lost last Christmas. Carter had simply wanted to talk, to know her past, what other mysteries she had unraveled. Both had seemed to want to probe her mind, and though she liked them both so very much, she had wanted equally to escape.</p><p>She had enjoyed the library and Mrs. O\u2019Hara, and decided to take refuge there where she could research Amy Clayton\u2019s family. She was sure that someone in the area had to know where the family graveyard could be found, but the library, she was certain, would have local records.</p><p>She knew the minute she saw Mrs. O\u2019Hara that the woman had heard she had found the skull. It was a small town. News traveled quickly. But Mrs. O\u2019Hara didn\u2019t question her, other than to ask if she wanted tea. Darcy decided to accept a cup. Mrs. O\u2019Hara had a nice sense of perception herself\u2014she found the record book Darcy wanted behind the desk, as if she\u2019d searched for it as soon as she\u2019d heard the news.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re looking for anything else local,\u201d Mrs. O\u2019Hara told her, \u201cjust head up to the loft level.\u201d She pointed to stairs which led to the walkway that circled the perimeter of the upper floor. The intricately carved railings made it seem almost as if the library had originally been built as a grand old home, rather than as a public facility. Mrs. O\u2019Hara grinned, seeing her look up and around. \u201cOriginally, this was part of an old plantation. It belonged to a man named Geoffrey Huntington, and he was very good friends with Thomas Jefferson, among other notable men. But he was a Loyalist, and the main house was burned during the Revolution. Luckily, he had this structure planned as an outbuilding, his own private retreat, and the furious Patriots were happy to keep his book collection alive and well, since he was forced out of the country. It\u2019s beautiful, isn\u2019t it? And everything is original. Except for some of the books, of course. Thankfully, the place was very large, because over the years we\u2019ve accumulated many fine collections of books.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s an extraordinary library,\u201d Darcy told her sincerely.</p><p>\u201cOn the National Register of Historic Buildings,\u201d Mrs. O\u2019Hara said proudly. \u201cWe may have to add on soon, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI imagine that it\u2019s far better for a library to have too many books than too few,\u201d Darcy said.</p><p>\u201cNaturally!\u201d Mrs. O\u2019Hara agreed.</p><p>With her cup of tea and the old book Mrs. O\u2019Hara had already found for her, Darcy curled up in one of the stuffed armchairs on the ground floor and began to read.</p><p>The Clayton family had left the area in the late-eighteen hundreds. They had, however, arrived in the mid-seventeen hundreds, and had maintained a family plot in the Christ\u2019s Church burial ground. The record book\u2014a horribly boring tome\u2014listed family names, occupations, marriages, baptisms, deaths, and little more, but it actually offered a plot map of Christ\u2019s Church and the surrounding graveyard. It wasn\u2019t far from Melody House at all. Once the skull was deemed ancient by the proper authorities, Darcy assumed there would be no difficulty seeing that it was buried along with the rest of poor Amy Clayton.</p><p>She set the book down and looked up the stairway, noting again just how exceptionally fine the building was. Naturally, since a wealthy and influential man\u2014who had apparently loved reading and books\u2014had planned it for himself. But still, few towns could possibly have such a gem of a library. The stairway was winding, the wood old and polished, and it appeared that even the runner on the stairs was as old as the facility.</p><p>She decided that it was time to set the record book aside and head up to see what else she could find.</p><p>At the top of the stairway she discovered that the flooring of the loft was really little more than scaffolding. The runner extended only up the stairs, then curved into an arch at the landing, while the flooring itself then became polished wood, apparently very well tended.</p><p>Darcy began to peruse the different books. Some would be of little interest to anyone other than people who found their own family names, and yet she thought that it was quite wonderful that so many people from the area might come here and find out about ancestors. There were books with nothing more than family names on them, or titles that explained their contents exactly, such as Marriages among the Grangers of Stoneyville, and The Murtons Who Attended Grace Church. She smiled, slipping out a volume now and then, and finding most to be very old. It seemed that people hadn\u2019t kept such simple record books in a very long time. Or maybe, life just hadn\u2019t been that simple in a very long time.</p><p>A book on a high shelf caught her eye. The Stones of Melody House. She was delighted to see it, and once again, touched by the people of decades past who had found every little detail of life worthy of recording.</p><p>Deciding it was one volume she definitely needed to read, Darcy started to reach up for it. She was tall but she really had to stretch.</p><p>As she balanced on both toes, she heard a sudden creaking sound from the boards under her feet. Even as she frowned, the floorboard directly beneath her suddenly gave.</p><p>She grabbed frantically for the shelf in front of her. Too late, because it had all happened too quickly. For a second frozen in time, she staggered where she stood, knowing that the wood beneath her had failed, and that she was going to crash into a sheer drop. She was disbelieving, even as the simple rules of physics tore at the weight of her body.</p><p>She cried out, a whoosh of air escaping from her lungs as she felt herself suddenly plunge downward.</p><p>She grasped out desperately for any hold, all the while wondering, How? Why? Mrs. O\u2019Hara would never have sent anyone upstairs if it wasn\u2019t safe\u2014 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The sound of wood crashing to the floor below came to her ears just as she managed to reach out and grasp hold of the nearest crosswise support beam. Her downward impetus was so strong that her desperate scramble for hold caused instant agony in her shoulder sockets, and yet, there was an instant of relief and incredulity when she realized that she had stopped herself.</p><p>For the moment.</p><p>For the moment, yes, only the moment, her grasp upon the crossbeam was so tenuous, and it already seemed that her fingers were slick with perspiration and slipping.</p> <p>Another scream sounded, and not from her own lips.</p><p>It was Mrs. O\u2019Hara, crying out from beneath her.</p><p>And it was then that she fully realized herself that she was dangling from the crossbeam, her legs swinging a good twenty feet above the floor below.</p><p>She rued the long-ago wealthy plantation owner who had designed such a library.</p><p>\u201cHang on! Hang on!\u201d Mrs. O\u2019Hara cried out to her. \u201cI\u2019ve called 911. Books! I\u2019ll pile some books, the cushions from the chairs, just hold on dear, hold on!\u201d</p> <p>No other thought had occurred to Darcy, but even as the woman called out, Darcy could feel the terrible pressure on her arms and shoulder blades. She hadn\u2019t really realized her own imminent danger until that minute\u2014she had only congratulated herself on catching hold of the crossbeam.</p><p>But how long could she hold on?</p><p>Mrs. O\u2019Hara had dialed 911. Darcy wasn\u2019t certain that help could be there momentarily. And still....</p><p>It had been seconds, surely. No more than minutes. Her arms ached as if she had been stretched on a medieval rack. She wasn\u2019t a total weakling, but neither was she ready for championship wrestling.</p><p>\u201cDarcy, oh, dear! Hang on, dear! There\u2019s help coming!\u201d Mrs. O\u2019Hara called to her.</p><p>Darcy looked down. She shouldn\u2019t have. The distance between her and the ground floor seemed gaping. Looking downward seemed to create a greater burden on her arms. She winced, grated her teeth, and began to fear that her fingers would slip no matter how she strained to hang on.</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t imagine how this has happened!\u201d Mrs. O\u2019Hara cried anxiously. \u201cPlease, please...hang on.\u201d There had been no one else in the small library at that time. Too early for the school children, and perhaps too late for any legal assistants or local researchers. Darcy felt faint, looking at the distance between her own dangling body and the puny little cushion Mrs. O\u2019Hara was trying to arrange beneath her.</p><p>She closed her eyes, in agony, wondering if she would just break most of her bones if she gave up her hold, or if she\u2019d break her neck and die as well. Despite the pain in her arms and the fear that any second they were simply going to wrench from their sockets, it seemed as if a haze of blackness was beginning to take over. She wondered desperately if she still had the strength to try to swing her legs upward and find a hold with her ankles and calves on the torn-up floor above her.</p><p>\u201cDarcy?\u201d Mrs. O\u2019Hara called.</p><p>\u201cI always knew I should have trained for Cirque du Soleil!\u201d Darcy tossed back, wondering why she felt that she had to sound light and okay even though she definitely wasn\u2019t. She looked up at the hole in the floor. She\u2019d have to kick through other boards to get back up. But if the one had given, then maybe...</p><p>Fingers, hands, and arms in anguish, she gave a swing, kicking at the boards above. She nearly broke her toes.</p><p>All the other floorboards were as tight as could be. The effort nearly cost her the tenuous hold she had on the crossbeam. Black dots were forming before her eyes. She clenched her eyes tightly, knowing she would lose her grip any second.</p><p>\u201cDarcy!\u201d</p><p>She was startled to hear Matt\u2019s voice. So much so that she thought she was losing her grip on reality.</p> <p>\u201cDarcy, it\u2019s me, Matt. Just let go. I\u2019m going to catch you. Trust me.\u201d</p><p>Trust him. Just let go.</p><p>\u201cDarcy, I\u2019m below you. Let go. I won\u2019t let you get hurt.\u201d</p><p>Trust him...it had nothing to do with trust. She couldn\u2019t hold on any longer.</p><p>Her fingers were too stiffly wound around the crossbeam, but it didn\u2019t matter. They were slipping. She never really let go.</p><p>She simply fell, because her fingers lost their grasp.</p><p>And a scream of instinctive terror tore from her lips.</p><p>In the split second in which she fell, she anticipated her bones crushing, her blood splattering across the floor, her head...</p><p>\u201cDarcy!\u201d</p><p>Chapter 8</p><p>8</p><p>M att didn\u2019t fall, but staggered back as Darcy fell into his arms. The distance hadn\u2019t been so great, but she was naturally trying to resist the impetus of the fall upon her body, and she flailed wildly, desperately grabbing him as he caught her.</p><p>For a moment, they wavered, then he lost his balance, even if he did so with a certain amount of coordination. He went down upon his knees, cradling her against him. For several seconds, she had a death grip on him, and then her eyes met his, wide, those of a startled rabbit, and a shudder of relief went through her.</p><p>\u201cYou all right?\u201d he asked quickly.</p><p>She nodded. Then her fingers went through his hair and she smiled. \u201cYou\u2019re covered in dust.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour shirt is ripped and your arm is bleeding,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cOh dear, oh dear, oh dear!\u201d Mrs. O\u2019Hara said, hovering over them both. They could hear a siren then. A car from the station. \u201cThis was all so impossible! We have building inspectors in regularly! I walk on that floor all the time and I know that it\u2019s sound. Was sound. Oh, my God, I had thought that it was sound. The schoolchildren go up there when they\u2019re studying. Lord, it could have been a child, a little boy or girl who couldn\u2019t get a grasp to save themselves...oh, Darcy! I am so sorry! Matt, thank God that you arrived when you did.\u201d</p><p>Thank God that he had arrived when he did.</p><p>Strange chills ripped through him, and he stared at Darcy, still in his tense grip as they both lay sprawled on the floor.</p><p>Darcy eased her hold from around Matt\u2019s neck, stumbling to her feet, offering him a hand to rise as well. He took her hand, but stood up on his own power. She was still shaking. She might be smiling, ready to make light of the whole thing, but it wasn\u2019t an incident that could be dismissed.</p><p>\u201cGo ahead and put a Closed sign on the door, Mrs. O\u2019Hara,\u201d Matt said.</p><p>\u201cYes, yes, of course,\u201d Mrs. O\u2019Hara said, but still stood looking at Darcy. \u201cThe police car is coming but we need an ambulance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Darcy protested. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour arm is bleeding,\u201d Matt informed her firmly.</p><p>\u201cA scratch. I\u2019m all right, honestly. I just hope I didn\u2019t break any of your bones, falling on you as I did.\u201d</p><p>She, too, was covered in dust, or sawdust, whatever had given with the flooring. As he stared at her, Matt heard the car outside screech to a halt; Thayer Martin and Jimmy Tyson came bursting into the library.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right!\u201d Matt called out quickly, still staring at Darcy. But it wouldn\u2019t have been all right. By the time they would have arrived, Darcy would have been on the floor. Maybe not dead, but surely, severely injured.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hel\u2014heck happened?\u201d Thayer demanded, staring at Matt and Darcy and the debris, and then Mrs. O\u2019Hara.</p><p>\u201cFlooring collapsed,\u201d Matt said briefly. He turned to look at his two officers who were surveying the damage with amazement. \u201cGet the building inspector in here right away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill do,\u201d Thayer told him, pulling out his radio. Matt was dimly aware that Thayer was calling the situation in, and that Jimmy was walking carefully around the downed boards. He couldn\u2019t take his eyes off Darcy, and he was suddenly feeling chilled and strange himself. What in God\u2019s name had suddenly convinced him that he needed to come to the library? If he hadn\u2019t been here. But he had been. He never just drove to the library in the middle of the day. But despite being determined to head for the Wayside Inn, he had come here.</p><p>Another siren, and then, Jenkins and Smith from fire rescue were coming through the door. Thayer briefed them, and Smith headed for Darcy.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll get you to the hospital, miss,\u201d Smith said politely, looking her over with a trained eye.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need to go to the hospital, please!\u201d she insisted.</p><p>\u201cShow him your arm, Darcy,\u201d Matt said curtly. Too curtly. He saw her frown, but then she opted to turn with Smith and allow him to take a look at her.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get you into a chair and take a look,\u201d Smith said. Fifty-five, gray, bearded and bushy, Harry Smith was as competent a man as any to be found anywhere. He had a manner about him that was calming under the worst of circumstances, and Darcy accepted his pressure on her arm, taking a chair by the library desk.</p><p>Matt could hear them speaking softly as he strode the stairs up to the loft himself to take a look at the spot where Darcy had gone through.</p><p>Moving carefully along the floorboards, he got down on his hands and knees as he neared the faulty area. It looked as if a section of the boards had rotted right through. Only a section. The library was hundreds of years old, he reminded himself.</p><p>So were half the buildings in the town. They were also sound.</p><p>\u201cMatt!\u201d</p><p>He walked carefully to the railing to looked down. Smith was staring up at him. \u201cMiss Tremayne refuses to come to the hospital. She says she\u2019s fine. We\u2019re going to drive her back to Melody House. She wants to drive herself. Penny\u2019s car is here. Can someone take it?\u201d</p><p>Darcy had jumped up beside Smith. \u201cI am fine!\u201d she called up to him. \u201cI fell on you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still shaken up,\u201d Smith informed her.</p><p>\u201cReally, I\u2019m just fine. My arm is just scratched!\u201d Darcy protested.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get Penny\u2019s car back,\u201d Matt said. \u201cThat\u2019s not a problem. Darcy, let them give you a ride. I\u2019ll be along in a bit. I want to be here when the building inspector shows up.\u201d He offered her a grimace and a wave.</p><p>\u201cHonestly, I can drive,\u201d Darcy protested. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you can. Humor us all,\u201d Matt told her.</p><p>Looking up at him, her shirt ripped, covered in sawdust, she was still stunning. Hair wild and eyes large, body stiff with indignity, she was more appealing to him than ever.</p><p>The girl is strange, he tried to remind himself.</p> <p>She was ethical, dignified, beautiful, and often remote, as well. There was something about her manner that cried out to him in a way that he had never known. Lust, sure. She was supple, sinuous, elegant, and entirely sensual in her every little movement. Somewhere under it all, she was also wounded.</p><p>He could only hurt her worse, he thought. And still...</p><p>He doubted that could keep him away.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be back to Melody House as soon as I can,\u201d he said.</p><p>She set her jaw out stubbornly, looked as if she\u2019d protest again, then accepted Smith\u2019s arm, thanking him for his care and concern.</p> <p>Penny waited anxiously at the door, having received a call from Mrs. O\u2019Hara at the library. She raced out the moment she saw Smith\u2019s rescue vehicle pull up by the front door.</p><p>\u201cYou poor, poor dear!\u201d she told Darcy, slipping an arm around her shoulders before she had quite managed to exit the car door. \u201cCome right in. We\u2019ll get you going in a nice hot bath. That will ease your muscles. Then I\u2019ll make you some tea with whiskey\u2014the Irish swear that it\u2019s a cure-all. Thank God you weren\u2019t hurt worse! It\u2019s a miracle. You might have broken your neck. Or every bone in your body. My God! How could we have let such a thing happen in Stoneyville?\u201d</p><p>Darcy smiled at her. \u201cPenny, I keep telling everyone that I\u2019m absolutely fine, and no one wants to believe me.\u201d</p><p>Harry Smith had come around the front of the emergency vehicle and stood in silence, watching the exchange. \u201cWould you like some coffee or tea?\u201d Penny asked him. \u201cYou\u2019re on duty, so I can\u2019t lace yours, of course,\u201d she said, disturbed that she sounded so prim. She had always liked him. Such an incredibly kind man, always so calm and capable. Her heart had simply bled for him last year when his wife, just fifty-two, had succumbed to cancer.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Penny, I\u2019m going on back. I left my partner at the library to take a quick look at Matt. I\u2019ve got to get him and get back to work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMatt is hurt?\u201d Penny said anxiously.</p> <p>\u201cNot a bit. We just wanted to make sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Penny said, still standing there, her arm around Darcy.</p><p>\u201cWell, see you both later,\u201d Harry said. \u201cMiss Tremayne, you get a headache, anything out of the ordinary\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never hit my head on anything, honestly,\u201d Darcy said.</p><p>He nodded, waved, walked around and got into the emergency van. Penny and Darcy watched him leave, then Penny collected herself. \u201cPoor thing! Up, up. Clara Issy even went into the Lee Room to get your bath going. In fact,\u201d Penny added, looking at Darcy wryly, \u201cshe was up there yelling at the ghost.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYelling at the ghost?\u201d Darcy said.</p><p>Penny hesitated, then said, \u201cYes, dear. We were both thinking that...well, we\u2019re thinking that the ghost should just be left alone. We know that the ghost has violent urges, and we\u2019re afraid, that for some reason, the ghost is now out to get you.\u201d</p><p>Darcy shook her head. \u201cThe ghost is trying to tell us something, Penny. Not hurt me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCome in, let\u2019s get you out of all that dirt and sawdust,\u201d Penny said. She looked Darcy over. Mussed, yes, daunted, no.</p><p>\u201cHonestly,\u201d she said softly, leading Darcy into the house. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to take this the wrong way, but...I think you should leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPenny!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe ghost is supposed to be in the house, not the library!\u201d Darcy said.</p><p>\u201cBut maybe this ghost is so disturbed by you that it followed you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd maybe the floorboards are just really old, and they gave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, go on up. Everything will certainly be more logical once we\u2019ve all thought about it a bit,\u201d Penny said.</p><p>Darcy stopped at the foot of the stairs and stared at her. \u201cPenny, weren\u2019t you the one who wanted someone to come here\u2014to prove to Matt that there were ghosts, I believe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I was. But that was then, and this is now.\u201d Penny was exasperated. Darcy didn\u2019t seem to understand that she could really be in danger.</p><p>\u201cPenny, honestly, I do believe there is a presence in the Lee Room trying very hard to make itself known, and understood. I don\u2019t believe it followed me to the library. What happened to me was frightening, but I\u2019m fine, and it might have happened to anyone. It could have been a child, and Matt might not have been there in time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s strange, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Penny mused. How had Matt managed to be there at just the right time?</p><p>\u201cStrange, perhaps, but lucky,\u201d Darcy said. Penny was startled when Darcy suddenly put her hands on her shoulders, drew her close, and gave her a quick kiss on the cheek. \u201cI\u2019m fine, Penny, and I\u2019m not afraid of the ghost in the Lee Room. And I\u2019m very determined. I\u2019ll run up and bathe, and be back down. That tea you were talking about sounds great. But don\u2019t go treating me like an invalid. I have a scratch on my arm, nothing more.\u201d</p><p>Darcy ran up the stairs and Penny watched her go. She stood in the foyer on the first floor landing for a very long time, still staring long after Darcy had disappeared.</p><p>She shook her head.</p><p>It would be terrible if something were to happen to Darcy.</p><p>Just terrible.</p><p>She really needed to talk her into leaving.</p><p>Dan Platt was the building inspector called into the library. Naturally, and with Matt\u2019s full agreement and support, they were closing the library until a thorough inspection could be made.</p><p>Still, Matt wanted a preliminary report.</p><p>Dan, midforties, with iron-gray hair and a muscled physique, stood in his hard hat, hands on his hips. \u201cRight now, it looks like the boards just gave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy those boards?\u201d Matt demanded.</p><p>\u201cLeakage, maybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are no leaks. I looked at the roof.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes, leaks can slip down the walls and into floors without being evident. There are other possibilities.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething spilled there, maybe. Who knows? Maybe kids came in with some kind of acidic drinks, spilled them, and were too chicken to let Mrs. O\u2019Hara know what had happened. A spilled drink that wasn\u2019t wiped up would definitely damage this old wood. I\u2019m not sure, exactly, Matt. But it doesn\u2019t look as if there was any tampering, though why anyone would tamper with the library to begin with is beyond me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d still like an analysis done on the boards that gave out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. If that\u2019s what you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefinitely, it\u2019s what I want.\u201d</p><p>Dan looked at Matt as if he was going off the deep end, but he said, \u201cWe\u2019ll do a thorough investigation, and see that the rotten pieces are analyzed.\u201d</p><p>Matt nodded. \u201cGreat.\u201d</p><p>Dan started back up the stairs. Matt stood in the now empty ground floor, and waited. When Dan and his workers had finished, Matt headed back up the stairs himself. It wasn\u2019t that he didn\u2019t have complete faith in Dan Platt. Nor did he have the least suspicion that Dan wouldn\u2019t do a thorough job.</p><p>Still...</p><p>He took an evidence bag from the pocket of his jacket and selected a piece of the rotten floorboard from the area beneath the local history sections.</p><p>Downstairs, he chose another.</p><p>At last, he exited the library, saw that the building was locked, and that the notice that the facility was closed was obviously displayed on the doors.</p><p>When he left, he didn\u2019t head home. He was taking a drive into Washington. On the way, he put a call in to Shirley, letting her know that he\u2019d be out, but to call him on his cell in an emergency.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t a long drive. Still, the day would be gone by the time he returned.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d</p><p>Darcy was sitting in the dining room with Penny, drinking her whiskey-laced tea, when Clint came rushing in. She was touched by the way he came to her instantly, hunched down and gave her a simple, but very warm hug. Then he backed away, his hands still on her arms, his eyes anxious. \u201cAre you really okay?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cPerfectly,\u201d she assured him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve told her she should leave,\u201d Penny said firmly, lifting her cup for a long swallow of tea.</p><p>\u201cBecause of the library?\u201d Clint said, straightening at last and staring at Penny with a frown.</p><p>\u201cI think the ghost is following her,\u201d Penny said.</p><p>\u201cFollowing her?\u201d Clint repeated incredulously, sliding into one of the chairs at the table. \u201cPenny, that\u2019s insane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it?\u201d</p><p>Clint let out a long breath. \u201cI\u2019m not convinced there is a ghost.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019re an idiot,\u201d Penny said primly.</p><p>Clint arched a brow to Darcy, smiling in amusement. \u201cPenny, in the old days, I spent many a night in that room. You know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow old are you now, Clinton Stone? Over thirty, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPenny\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should have been married long ago, with a family of your own.\u201d</p><p>Clint sat back, his brows raised in surprise. \u201cPenny, some people just aren\u2019t the marrying kind.\u201d</p><p>She shook a finger at him. \u201cSome people just aren\u2019t mature and responsible!\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. I should get married\u2014like Matt did.\u201d</p><p>Penny looked abashed. \u201cLavinia seemed right for him at the time.\u201d</p><p>Clint sniffed, then grinned at Darcy. \u201cSee, there\u2019s always a way out of a tongue-lashing by Penny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPenny? Darcy? Where is everyone?\u201d came a call from the foyer.</p><p>Carter. The household was all arriving, so it seemed.</p><p>\u201cDining room!\u201d Darcy called out.</p><p>Carter came striding in. Like Clint, he made his way straight to Darcy, bent down on a knee, and took her hand. He looked earnestly into her eyes. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She smiled. \u201cI\u2019m fine. And I\u2019m going to take out an ad in the newspaper soon, swearing that I\u2019m fine.\u201d She looked at Penny and added softly. \u201cAnd that I\u2019m not leaving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeaving? Why should you leave?\u201d Carter asked frowning.</p><p>\u201cPenny thinks the ghost followed her to the library and pushed the floorboards through.\u201d</p> <p>Carter tried to hide a smile. \u201cWhy would the ghost do that? I thought that she was here to talk to the ghost.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo ahead, make fun of me, you ruffians!\u201d Penny said indignantly.</p><p>Carter found a chair at the table as well. \u201cPenny, I\u2019m not making fun of you. My question is why? If there is a ghost, and I\u2019m not at all convinced myself, one would think that the ghost wanted to talk to someone. Clear the air. Be released from its terrible curse of haunting, moaning, and chain dragging!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur ghosts have never dragged chains around\u2014or even moaned, for that matter,\u201d Penny said, a hard edge in her voice.</p><p>Carter was trying very hard not to smile. \u201cPenny, I\u2019m sorry, honestly, I\u2019m not mocking you. I just can\u2019t see any correlation between old floorboards giving out and a ghost that should be relegated to haunting a single place. I mean, what ghost have you ever heard about that travels around the countryside haunting different places?\u201d</p> <p>She stared at him hard. \u201cYou want my opinion?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, not really,\u201d Clint murmured softly, playfully.</p><p>Penny cast him a baleful glance. \u201cYou two and Matt think that it would be an unmanly\u2014unmacho\u2014thing to believe in ghosts, and therefore, you won\u2019t accept anything. Even though Darcy found poor Amy\u2019s skull in a day when it had been missing for over a hundred years! She won\u2019t admit it, but I say that the ghost told her where to find it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid the ghost tell you where to find it?\u201d Clint asked Darcy.</p><p>Despite herself, Darcy felt a flush rising. Penny needed backing, but she didn\u2019t want to get Clint and Carter going.</p><p>\u201cResearch, intuition, and maybe some energy from the past,\u201d she murmured uncomfortably.</p> <p>\u201cSo there!\u201d Penny said.</p><p>\u201cYeah, so there. Darcy looked up the history behind the legend,\u201d Carter said. \u201cPenny, come on! Even Matt spent a lot of time in that room, remember? Lavinia was crazy about the place. She thought it was so historic and fascinating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah\u2014he spent time with his charming wife,\u201d Clint reminded Penny, smiling.</p><p>\u201cI spent some really great days in that room, too,\u201d Carter said, grinning at Clint.</p><p>Penny glared at him.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Clint said, staring at Penny. \u201cDoesn\u2019t Carter get a tongue-lashing on his wild, womanizing ways as well?\u201d</p><p>Penny set a hand on Carter\u2019s. \u201cAt least this poor boy was in love with Susan Howell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSusan Howell?\u201d Clint said. \u201cWhat about Catherine Angsley, Tammy what-ever-her-last-name-was, Gina Danson, and that Glynnis-something woman?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEh!\u201d Carter said to Clint.</p><p>\u201cHe, at least, cared very deeply about Susan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPenny, the point here,\u201d Carter said, \u201cis that all of us so-called longing-to-be-macho men stayed in the room many times\u2014with nothing happening. A scared little bride who wanted the room to be haunted panicked in the middle of the night. Clara Issy freaked out while cleaning. And Darcy claims to be a ghost buster. Sorry, Darcy,\u201d he said quickly.</p><p>\u201cMaybe it\u2019s a ghost who only dislikes women,\u201d Clint said, grinning. \u201cYou know, some horses are like that. Dogs too. They have definite preferences for male and female people. Remember that German shepherd we had years ago? Gracie was her name. She absolutely despised men, but became a kitten anytime a woman was around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah!\u201d Carter agreed. \u201cAnd remember that little white mop thing Lavinia had?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLhasa Apso,\u201d Clint told him.</p><p>\u201cWhatever. The dog was the cutest little pile of white fur in the world\u2014until a guy went to pet it. Then it was all teeth and obnoxious yaps,\u201d Carter recalled.</p><p>\u201cMatt should have known not to marry her once he saw that dog,\u201d Clint said.</p><p>\u201cAh, hell, we all thought she was the hottest thing since fire had been invented,\u201d Carter reminded him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re getting off the subject,\u201d Penny said.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t realize we were really on a subject,\u201d Clint said.</p><p>\u201cBut, Penny, there you go, we were on the subject, we simply found a solution to the dilemma,\u201d Carter said with a laugh. \u201cWe have a ghost that isn\u2019t fond of women. Maybe it\u2019s a she, and she is simply jealous of good-looking girls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClara Issy would be delighted that you called her a good-looking girl,\u201d Penny said tartly.</p><p>\u201cClara is adorable,\u201d Clint argued.</p><p>\u201cBut hardly a girl,\u201d Penny pointed out.</p><p>\u201cIt comes down to this, Penny,\u201d Carter said. \u201cIt\u2019s quite ridiculous to associate an accident in the library with a malignant ghost from the house, should one exist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd it also comes down to this,\u201d Darcy interjected firmly. \u201cI\u2019m not leaving. Unless I\u2019m thrown out.\u201d She stood. \u201cThank you, all of you, for your concern. Penny, since the public library has now become off-limits, may I crawl through some of the old house records?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, dear, of course. Make my office your own,\u201d Penny told her. She looked at her wistfully as she rose. \u201cI still wish that you\u2019d leave.\u201d</p><p>Darcy smiled. \u201cI\u2019ll be all right, Penny. I promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDinner at seven,\u201d Penny said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be there,\u201d Darcy assured her, and headed for Penny\u2019s office.</p><p>The woman was a wonderful organizer, Darcy thought. As she studied the bookshelves, Darcy saw that records, histories, legends, and books related to ghost stories were arranged first chronologically, and then alphabetically. She sat in the chair in front of Penny\u2019s desk for several minutes, just studying the shelves and musing over what had happened at the library. She didn\u2019t believe that the entity haunting the Lee Room was truly malevolent\u2014merely frustrated. And Carter and Clint had made an interesting point that afternoon\u2014it had been all women who had been troubled by the ghost.</p><p>Meaning?</p><p>She wasn\u2019t at all certain.</p><p>She needed to get moving.</p><p>She rose and selected a history that chronicled the early days of Stoneyville. The first pages were dry and bland, recording a great deal about building materials. Darcy skimmed the information. Then, there was the sad story about poor Melody, who had died in her lover\u2019s arms.</p><p>Melody was given a loving, Christian funeral. Her parents mourned her loss until their dying days. The poor girl did not seem a good candidate for such a haunting. Besides, she hadn\u2019t slept in the Lee Room. The Jackson room had been hers.</p><p>Reading further, Darcy again skimmed a great deal of mundane material dealing with births, deaths, baptisms, and marriages. However, moving forward to 1777, she found mention of a strange mystery. Apparently, the Stones had done a fair amount of procreating outside the bonds of marriage. Arabella Latham, the great-granddaughter of the builder\u2019s brother, Malachi Stone, born on the wrong side of the blanket, was furious with her family\u2019s decision to side with the Patriots during the Revolution. Malachi Stone had died before the house had been finished, and it was said that he had loaned his brother large sums to have the house completed. His heirs\u2014legitimate and otherwise\u2014were left penniless.</p><p>Arabella, however, had been engaged in a passionate affair with Regan Stone, a legitimate cousin of the current master of the house, Ryan Stone, and spent endless days there, basking in the admiration of both cousins. Perhaps she had designs on the legal heir to the house, and was using Regan to get close to him. Ryan, however, was in love with a young beauty of the region, Mary Anderson, who defied her own family, strong Tories, to elope with him.</p><p>Arabella, hearing of the wedding, was furious, but perhaps more convinced that she must snag her errant lover into marriage. Ryan was heading off to battle, and against the British, no one believed that the pathetic little American army had a chance. To be close to her new husband, Mary followed him around the country as he went to war.</p><p>But somewhere in those days, the ambitious Arabella disappeared. Regan himself was finally drawn into the battle, and killed at Monmouth. Ryan Stone survived the war and returned with his beloved Mary who produced no fewer than eleven children for him, ten daughters and one son, who then proceeded to inherit the house in his turn.</p><p>\u201cArabella!\u201d Darcy murmured aloud.</p><p>She closed her eyes, and waited, trying very hard to open her senses and her mind. She thought of the dreams or visions that had plagued her.</p><p>The man, outside the house, coming in.</p><p>The woman, waiting.</p><p>It would make sense, she thought. Since apparently Arabella wanted marriage and legitimacy, and Regan Stone wanted nothing more than a mistress, they would have definitely argued. If their affair was as passionate as claimed in the history, they would have argued with a fervor.</p><p>Arabella probably knew intimate secrets about her lover.</p><p>She could easily have become a burden to him.</p><p>A tap at the door made Darcy jump.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d Darcy said, drawn from her musings.</p><p>Carter stuck his head in the door. \u201cHey, you\u2019ve been at it a long time. Dinner is ready. And you\u2019ve had a long day. A rough fall. Maybe it wasn\u2019t quite a Humpty Dumpty thing\u2014you\u2019re not in pieces and you\u2019re certainly all together nicely\u2014but still, you need a break.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Carter,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd you\u2019re right. I\u2019m coming. Dinner sounds great.\u201d</p><p>He waited for her at the door. When she rose, put the book back, and joined him, he slipped an arm around her in a brotherly fashion.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not scared off, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot in the least.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. There\u2019s no way that a fall in the library had anything to do with a ghost here.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo, of course not,\u201d Darcy agreed. \u201cThey were just old floorboards.\u201d</p><p>As they walked through the breezeway to the foyer, the front door opened. Matt was back, in uniform. Darcy felt a bit strange, noticing the way he looked over her close proximity to Carter. Maybe Carter noticed Matt\u2019s look as well. His arm fell from her shoulders.</p><p>\u201cHey, hardworking lawman,\u201d Carter said. \u201cYou made it back just in time for dinner.\u201d</p> <p>Matt nodded, glancing at Darcy. \u201cYou feeling all right?\u201d</p><p>She made an effort not to grit her teeth. \u201cI\u2019m really feeling terrific. You were the one who hit the floor, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, yes, the valiant, manly man of a sheriff!\u201d Carter teased, and yet, Darcy thought that there was just a slight edge to his voice.\u201d Of course, Darcy is fine. She fell on all that terrific muscle and sinew, eh, Matt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething like that,\u201d Matt said dryly.</p><p>Penny appeared in the foyer. \u201cMatt! Great. I\u2019m so happy you\u2019re back in time for a real dinner. Where did you get to? You weren\u2019t answering the cell, and Shirley said that you\u2019d left the station.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI had some business out of the county,\u201d Matt said simply, still looking at Darcy. Then he turned to Penny at last. \u201cGo on and start dinner without me. I\u2019m going to take a quick shower and change. If you\u2019ll all excuse me?\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t really a question; more of a statement. He headed up the stairs.</p><p>\u201cWell, ladies?\u201d Carter said. He offered them both an arm.</p><p>Penny smiled and took one. \u201cHonestly. You and Clint can be the most wretched young reprobates in history, but then, you can be the most darling men I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe strive for \u2018darling\u2019!\u201d Carter said. \u201cCome along.\u201d He looked at Darcy, wiggling his free arm. \u201cI\u2019m working so hard on being \u2018darling,\u2019 Darcy. Give me a hand here!\u201d</p><p>She smiled and accepted his arm.</p> <p>\u201cYou should shave, Carter,\u201d Penny told him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve worked long and hard on this beard!\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still such a handsome fellow without it,\u201d Penny argued.</p><p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t look like Jeb Stuart without it!\u201d Carter protested.</p><p>Penny sighed and looked around him to tell Darcy, \u201cThey called Jeb Stuart \u2018Beauty\u2019 when he was at West Point, and not because of his good looks, but because they thought that he was ugly as sin. So he had to grow a beard! Carter, it\u2019s just the opposite with you. You have a great face. The beard should really go. What do you say, Darcy?\u201d</p><p>Put on the spot, she shrugged. \u201cI think he has to do what makes him happy with himself,\u201d she said.</p><p>Carter studied her, slowly grinning. \u201cThat\u2019s the whole crust of life, right in a nutshell, don\u2019t you think? We all have to do what we all have to do\u2014to be happy with ourselves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhile we\u2019re living\u2014and when we\u2019re dead,\u201d Penny said. She shivered suddenly. \u201cOh, Darcy! I like you so very much, but I sure do wish that you\u2019d leave. I\u2019m so worried about you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPenny, there\u2019s an expression that\u2019s not very nice, but it fits the bill, I think,\u201d Darcy told her, then quoted, \u201cIt\u2019s not happening. So live with it.\u201d</p><p>Penny grimaced. \u201cThat\u2019s just the point, Darcy,\u201d she said, and there was a real shiver to her voice. \u201cI want you to live!\u201d</p><p>Clint came striding to the foyer from the dining room. \u201cExcuse me, people, but dinner is served!\u201d</p><p>Penny walked ahead, touching Clint\u2019s cheek. \u201cWe\u2019re coming! But stalling a minute is fine, too. Matt\u2019s home, showering and changing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then, Ms. Penny, you come and tell that to the cook!\u201d Clint said.</p><p>Clint and Penny moved on. Darcy started to follow.</p><p>Carter pulled her back. \u201cDarcy, something there just gave me chills, and I don\u2019t believe in chills. Maybe you should think about this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d Darcy asked him.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Just a feeling of discomfort. I don\u2019t think that I believe that a ghost could be after you. No, I definitely don\u2019t believe that. But still...\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill...what?\u201d Darcy asked.</p><p>\u201cThere does seem to be some danger here for you,\u201d Carter said, his words slow, as if he was struggling to understand his own feeling. Then the look of worry left his face. \u201cYou\u2019re just too gorgeous. Which means, of course, we\u2019d like to have you around forever. But not as a ghost! We want you to remain among the living. Oh, what the hell am I saying? Come, my beauty! The dinner table awaits.\u201d</p><p>Caught in his arm, Darcy walked with him toward the dining room.</p><p>Then she was startled herself.</p><p>An icy chill suddenly swept up around her. Cold, so cold.</p><p>And she felt a strange tug....</p><p>As if someone was trying to get her away from Carter.</p><p>Keep her back.</p><p>Have her there...</p><p>Alone.</p><p>Chapter 9</p><p>9</p><p>\u201cS o, our skull proves to be that of poor Amy, who has been running around the forest looking for her head for years,\u201d Clint said, helping himself to more mashed potatoes. \u201cThis means we have to have a nice little ceremony and bury her skull, right?\u201d He looked at Matt.</p><p>\u201cOh, but of course!\u201d Penny exclaimed, before Matt could speak.</p><p>Matt arched a brow to her.</p><p>\u201cWe should bury it quietly,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we have a ceremony, every idiot journalist from here to Alaska will be in the place, making a big deal out of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMatt, really!\u201d Penny said with disgust.</p><p>Matt might be exaggerating, but he also had a point. People loved stories like this one; the New York Times might not pounce on it, but small papers and sensationalist rags from all over would jump on that kind of a story.</p><p>\u201cActually,\u201d Carter said, \u201cit wouldn\u2019t be so bad. It would be a nice thing. A tidy end to the story. And the journalists would have to write up the fact that the ghost had been put to rest. Once put to rest, there would be no more hauntings. Right, Darcy?\u201d</p><p>Darcy set her fork down. \u201cThe skull should be buried with the rest of the body. Having a minister officiate would be nice. Exactly what goes on other than that probably doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone of it really matters anyway,\u201d Matt said. He sounded irritated. Naturally. He didn\u2019t believe in ghosts.</p><p>Darcy chose her words carefully. \u201cWhether Amy\u2019s ghost ever actually ran around the forest or not isn\u2019t the point. We bury people out of respect for the lives they led, and for those loved ones left behind. Granted, Amy doesn\u2019t have any remaining relatives in the area\u2014that we know about\u2014but she was still a living, breathing human being. A pitiable one, considering the way that she was murdered. In all due respect, we should see that her skull is buried with her body.\u201d</p><p>Matt hesitated, then said, \u201cHer skull can go near her body. She was buried more than a century ago. God knows what shape she\u2019d be in now. The coffin was probably simple wood, long since deteriorated. There are different laws regarding burial now. We can do our best\u2014since I suppose you\u2019re right, that it would be proper.\u201d He looked around the table. \u201cGo into any major museum, and you\u2019ll find bones and skulls coming out of the woodwork. Dead is dead. If there truly is life after death, I\u2019d say it\u2019s pretty well confirmed that we don\u2019t need our physical bodies once we get there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMatt, there\u2019s not a bit of the romantic in you!\u201d Penny moaned.</p><p>\u201cWhat is romantic about a tragic murder?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe simple rightness of seeing that she is whole again, at least in her final resting place,\u201d Penny said firmly.</p><p>Matt shrugged. \u201cPenny, we\u2019ll see that the skull is interred near the body, all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd we\u2019ll have a little ceremony?\u201d Penny pleaded.</p><p>He threw up his hands. \u201cWhatever you wish, Penny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Darcy asked, determined to change the subject. \u201cDid any of you all ever hear of a woman named Arabella?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, there is a story about Arabella,\u201d Penny began. \u201cShe was supposedly the bastard child of a far distant Stone who tried to seduce the legitimate heir, eons ago. Scheming, conniving, and all. But he married someone else. And she disappeared from the legend. Why? Were you reading about her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, just now.\u201d</p><p>Penny was excited. \u201cThere\u2019s no story about her dying a violent death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut she disappeared. Maybe she was murdered. She could be the haunt in the Lee Room.\u201d</p><p>Matt pushed back his chair. \u201cExcuse me, ladies, gentlemen. I hear the night air calling to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Matt!\u201d Penny said.</p><p>He didn\u2019t reply. He pushed his chair in, then looked at Darcy. \u201cYou\u2019re sure you\u2019re all right?\u201d</p><p>They had managed to go through the entire meal without referring to the episode in the library.</p><p>Darcy sighed. \u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWhen you\u2019re tired, go up,\u201d he warned.</p><p>\u201cDarcy, he\u2019s right,\u201d Clint said, looking at her worriedly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she persisted.</p><p>\u201cI agree. You looked darned good to me,\u201d Carter said lightly.</p><p>Matt turned and walked out of the dining room. Penny folded her hands and looked at Darcy excitedly again. \u201cArabella! I can see what you\u2019re thinking. She disappeared from the records and the area\u2014because she was dead. Murdered by her traitorous lover. In the Lee Room!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething like that,\u201d Darcy said.</p><p>Carter groaned. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t a body.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, posh! A man who knew the area\u2014years ago, before forensic sciences were so advanced\u2014could easily dispose of a body,\u201d Penny said. She looked earnestly at Darcy. \u201cI watch all the forensic shows, so I know about these things.\u201d</p><p>Darcy looked down, hiding a smile. Then she looked at Carter. \u201cI\u2019m afraid that even today, with all the police work and forensic technology available, lots of bodies still disappear, and many murderers go unpunished.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI suppose,\u201d Carter said. With a shrug he added. \u201cI\u2019ll let you ladies play, Murder, She Wrote.\u201d He stretched and yawned. \u201cIf you\u2019ll excuse me. I think I\u2019m going to head out to play some pool. Anyone want to join me?\u201d</p><p>He looked hopefully around the table.</p><p>\u201cNot tonight,\u201d Clint said.</p> <p>\u201cYou sure?\u201d Carter asked. \u201cDarcy?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cThanks. Maybe tomorrow night.\u201d</p><p>Clint laughed. \u201cCarter, you don\u2019t need to look like an old hanged dog. I heard that our lovely new young city commissioner, Delilah, plays pool a lot of evenings. Ah, hm. I\u2019ll bet you knew that. Makes the Wayside Inn so much more appealing, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe may be there, she may not,\u201d Carter said.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you just ask her out?\u201d Darcy suggested.</p> <p>\u201cWell, since I\u2019m barking up the wrong tree following you around like a coonhound with his tongue on the ground, I might as well.\u201d</p><p>Darcy smiled at him, certain that he was joking, but feeling just a little bit uncomfortable anyway. But Carter\u2019s smile deepened and he winked. \u201cSo I should just ask her out, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like a plan to me,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give it some real thought. Meanwhile, I\u2019m going to go play pool and see if I run into her. Night, all.\u201d</p><p>With a wave, he left the room.</p><p>Penny stood. \u201cHeavens. I forgot to make those fellows help clean up!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d like a little busywork right now,\u201d Darcy told her. \u201cWe\u2019ll get this all picked up in a matter of minutes.\u201d</p><p>She stood, gathering plates. Clint rose with her. \u201cI guess I didn\u2019t run out fast enough,\u201d he said, moaning to Penny, giving Darcy a quick grimace.</p><p>\u201cYoung man, work is good for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have you know that I actually have lots of irons in the fire. I\u2019m just not sharing my activities until I have something really sound to say.\u201d</p><p>Penny eyed him skeptically. \u201cHm.\u201d Then she took a casserole plate and moved on into the kitchen.</p><p>Darcy rinsed dishes while Clint put them into the dishwasher. He was amusing as they worked, finding a way to break into a song regarding every comment Penny made as she put leftovers into containers and then into the refrigerator.</p><p>By the time they had finished, Penny was groaning, Darcy was laughing. And yet, Penny was very fond of Clint, and not half as dismayed by his antics as she tried to appear to be.</p><p>Matt didn\u2019t come back in.</p> <p>When they finished, Darcy excused herself, anxious to get up to the Lee Room.</p><p>She turned the light on as she closed the door behind her. She looked around the room, then closed her eyes, and tried to let any sensations ease into her.</p><p>The room seemed extraordinarily still and quiet. And empty.</p><p>\u201cArabella?\u201d she murmured softly aloud. \u201cIf there was an injustice, we can at least let it be known. There\u2019s no need to be so hostile. We\u2019re trying to help you.\u201d</p><p>No response. No whisper of a breeze, no hint of a voice on the air. No coldness. Nothing.</p><p>The ghost was lying dormant. Darcy didn\u2019t even get her usual chilling sense of being watched.</p><p>She hesitated a few minutes, then went out on the balcony, gripped the rail, and stared into the night. So beautiful. Surely, this area of Virginia was blessed.</p><p>After a few moments, she went back in.</p><p>She turned on the television, and was surprised to realize that the late-night talk shows had come on. Idly, she began to strip down for bed, started to choose a T-shirt for sleep, then hesitated.</p><p>Matt would come. She was certain.</p><p>She opted for a light-blue silk peignoir.</p><p>Seated upon the bed, she watched the television for several seconds, waiting. But that night, the Lee Room seemed to be giving her nothing.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand at all,\u201d she said out loud. \u201cYou obviously want help. Let me help you. Or are you simply angry with the Stones for what happened to you, Arabella, and eager to hurt them? They are not the same people now. Matt Stone is not the man who did this to you.\u201d</p><p>Still...nothing.</p><p>With a sigh, she turned around and curled up with her pillow.</p><p>Matt wasn\u2019t sure why he stayed out on the porch so late. But then again, there were times when he did just sit out there, doing nothing, feeling the light, watching the land beneath the moonlight. There was something calming and reaffirming about doing so. He did love Melody House. More than that, he loved Virginia, especially his county. It was as if the heritage and history were ingrained in him, and as if his love for the land returned to him sometimes on nights like this, strengthening.</p><p>Either that, or he didn\u2019t want to listen to any more nonsense from Penny.</p><p>Carter had gone to play pool. After a while, Clint, too, had decided to head into town claiming he was feeling a little edgy and might as well go to the Wayside Inn and play some pool.</p><p>Matt lingered outside a bit longer, then went in.</p><p>The house was silent. Those who hadn\u2019t headed out rabblerousing had gone to bed.</p><p>He went to his own room first, but didn\u2019t stay more than a few seconds. Walking out on the balcony, he paused a few minutes again, staring at Darcy\u2019s door. It was closed. She probably hadn\u2019t locked it, though, and he didn\u2019t know if he\u2019d be relieved or angry once he made certain that he was right. She should be locking it.</p><p>But then again, maybe she had left it open for him.</p><p>He tried the door. Open.</p><p>He should go in and yell at her.</p><p>Matt stepped into Darcy\u2019s room, closed and locked the balcony doors behind him. For a few moments he stood where he was, thinking that she had been through a traumatic day. Except that a near-death experience hadn\u2019t seemed so traumatic to her.</p><p>He should leave.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t about to do so.</p><p>The television was on, but the lights had been dimmed. And Darcy was soundly sleeping.</p><p>He walked to the bed, treading softly.</p><p>She looked like a heroine of old, red hair splaying out like an elegant, fire-touched shawl. She was long and lean, slender legs visible beneath the gauze of her nightgown, feet just peeking out. The way she slept...her position enhanced her cleavage. And the way her arms were curled around it...he wanted nothing more than to be her pillow at that moment.</p><p>\u201cDarcy?\u201d he said softly.</p><p>\u201cUm?\u201d</p><p>She stirred, turning. Her eyes, heavy-lidded, opened slowly. She stared at him, a slow, seductive smile curling her lips.</p><p>\u201cWhy, Sheriff Stone,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>\u201cYou left the balcony doors open,\u201d he said, sliding down to sit beside her.</p><p>Her smile deepened. \u201cNot to be too presumptuous, but...I assumed you might arrive here,\u201d she said. Heavy with sleep, her voice was husky, the sound of it eliciting drumbeats in his veins that echoed into his mind. And beyond.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure...you\u2019re fine? After today?\u201d he queried.</p><p>Her smile deepened. She lifted her arms, curling them around his shoulders as she halfway rose to him. Head cast back, throat at an incredible arch, voice richer than carnal sin itself, she assured him. \u201cReally, truly, fine. Better than fine. Want me to prove it?\u201d</p><p>She had come to him completely, hot breath of her whispered words against his ear, causing the drumbeat to shudder down to a mambo in his groin. He wrapped his arms around her, finding her lips, her mouth, depth and heat and wetness, and locking her into a kiss that seemed to fuse his body to hers. He had to press her back to struggle in his haste to remove his clothing. Bared to muscle and sinew and pure lust, he rose above her, fingers finding the hem of the gauzy gown, dragging it up before he settled, flesh against flesh, arousal spiraling with the first brush of the senses. He could drown in the sweet aroma of her soap, perfume, and self. The feel and taste of her were seductive, intoxicating, and he ran his palms over her flesh again and again, savoring the feel, bringing his lips against her next for a taste of the texture of her skin. The impact of their bodies against one another created an arousal within him that he fought, not just for the desire to be a giving lover, but to prolong the excruciating promise of climax and pleasure.</p><p>Yet that night, she was the aggressor, pressing against him, pushing him away and forcing him to his knees, fingers radiating over his chest, a flutter of kisses and the tip of her tongue drawing exquisite lines against his flesh caused it to burn, chill, and burn again. Her hands aroused and caressed, encircling the fullness of his arousal, before her lips moved again, the liquid fire of her tongue creating an agony of hunger, the energy within her a lightning storm that catapulted around him until it was unbearable and she was in his arms again, bodies fused and fitted and moving in an ever increasing, staccato beat that drove ever upward, wild, sweet, and all but blinding to every thing but the needs of the senses, in the end, totally raw, and then explosive. The force of climax left them both breathless, veins still thundering, hearts pulsing, arms and limbs entwined. He held her against him, loathe to let her go even as satiation seeped throughout him. There were things he wanted to say, and could not. In a distant corner of his mind, he longed not to be entan gled, because his world was real, and she believed so fiercely in all that was not.</p><p>And yet...</p><p>Impossible. He harbored a fear of her. Not because she was an elegant redhead. Because there was something\u2014</p><p>Something, perhaps, that challenged all his beliefs, and therefore, his strengths.</p><p>He thought of all the lies that passed so easily between men and women. And she was far too fine to be told lies.</p><p>And yet...</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right, you don\u2019t need to say anything,\u201d she told him.</p><p>His muscles inadvertently flexed.</p><p>Shadow and light filled the room. \u201cI\u2019ve never expected forever,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cDarcy\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDarcy\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m telling you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t. Don\u2019t tell me anything,\u201d he said, and added, \u201cJust be with me.\u201d</p><p>He cradled her against him. Neither tried to speak again. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>In the dream, or somewhere in the deep recesses of her mind, she knew she was someone else.</p><p>The woman in the room.</p><p>She had known the woman in the dream before, sat within her entity, and she had known the beginning of the scene from both sides, for she had entered into the energy or entity of the man involved as well.</p> <p>But tonight...she saw it all from the woman\u2019s eyes.</p><p>Felt the spasm of fear as she heard the sound.</p><p>Near. Within the house. A creaking of old floorboards.</p><p>The woman hesitated, straightening, listening, wondering why an ordinary sound should elicit such an instinctive sense of fear.</p><p>So often, the house was filled with people. Not that night. And at first, she had been glad that it would be so empty.</p> <p>Now...</p><p>She rose, exiting the room, hurrying to the second-floor landing of the staircase, and looking down. Her breath caught as her eyes focused on the figure at the foot of the stairs.</p><p>He had entered the house. He had the right, in his own mind, at least. He had the right to everything. She did not. Strange, he had stood there, looking up at her, dozens of times before. Then, he had smiled. Admired the way that moonlight played through the white fabric of her nightgown. He had instilled within her an intoxicating sense of anticipation, pleasure...excitement. He was so many things that a man should be, physically arresting, sensual, exuding a sense of power that was all but an aphrodisiac.</p><p>But tonight...</p><p>He did not smile.</p><p>They stared at one another for several long moments. Maybe an eternity.</p> <p>Then...</p><p>She saw what he carried. What was in his hands. And the way that he held it...she knew what he intended to do with it.</p><p>A scream rose to her throat; she held it back, for there would be no one to hear. Then words, disjointed, tumbled from her lips, for she still couldn\u2019t believe what appeared to be his intent.</p><p>\u201cYou...you loved me,\u201d she murmured. \u201cYou must still...love me. Somewhat. You can\u2019t mean to...to...you can\u2019t!\u201d</p><p>The last was whispered. It was a plea. It was a tone that called forth all that had come between them...before. All that had been shared.</p><p>His eyes remained upon hers. He didn\u2019t reply.</p><p>He started up the stairs.</p><p>And she ran.</p> <p>First, back to the room where she had been writing, setting down words, her own revenge. But even as she attempted to close the door, she felt the force of his weight against it. As he burst in, she saw the metal bed warmer hanging on the wall, and she grabbed hold of it firmly, dashing him against the side of the head. He cried out, staggering back.</p><p>She took flight, forcing her way past him, tearing down the stairs, her white gown trailing in a diaphanous cloud behind her.</p><p>Blackness, a cloud of shadows, arose around the vision.</p><p>Darcy\u2019s visions were often so crystal clear in dreams. Sometimes, the fact that they were fading awakened her. And sometimes, the fact that she awakened ended the dream. Perhaps, some instinct inside caused her to awaken so that she wouldn\u2019t witness too much. Maybe innate fear kicked in. But she didn\u2019t want any natural defense mechanisms kicking in on her now.</p><p>But...</p><p>She was losing it. Losing touch of the vision. Awakening.</p><p>No! She knew that she had to see the end. She cried out silently in fierce frustration, knowing she was close...so close...to knowing the end.</p><p>Knowing that she felt...what the woman had felt.</p><p>She fought both the fading of the dream, and the terror that was washing over her. She leapt to her feet, crying out, racing to the door. She thought that it was opened. It was not. She slammed against it, woke completely, and stood, facing the door, shaking off the aftereffects.</p><p>\u201cDarcy?\u201d She heard his voice, startled, deeply concerned.</p><p>She was aware that he was looking at her, though her back was to him. A wave of misery swept over her; she was certain that there would be revulsion in his eyes.</p><p>She turned quickly, grabbing her robe from the foot of the bed, slipping into it and heading out the balcony doors. She inhaled deeply, breathing in the night air.</p><p>She was startled to feel his hands fall upon her shoulders, his presence, warm and strong behind her.</p><p>\u201cDarcy, are you all right?\u201d His voice was deep, resonant, husky, and deeply concerned. She wondered just what she had done in her sleep.</p><p>\u201cYes. Look, I\u2019m really sorry\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be. What\u2014happened?\u201d he asked. \u201cWhat was it? The house? A sound?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, nothing. Nothing at all. Just a dream.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014can\u2019t,\u201d she lied. \u201cIt\u2019s faded already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDarcy, please, tell me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t. It\u2019s gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, then just\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want anything to do with this...with me, and it\u2019s all right, honestly\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHonestly, Darcy, even knowing you as I do, seeing what I\u2019ve seen...I\u2019m not sure what I believe. But I wish you\u2019d try to tell me more about it.\u201d</p><p>She swung around, startled to see that the eyes she expected to be so filled with wary distaste held nothing but gentleness. Strangely, his manner made her a bit more determined to pull away. He really didn\u2019t understand the half of it. He still didn\u2019t believe. If he really did, he would pull away.</p><p>She lifted her hands. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to explain what you don\u2019t understand yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right. Let me help.\u201d He smoothed back a lock of hair that the night breeze had sent drifting over her forehead. \u201cDid you always...have visions?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen?\u201d</p><p>She had to turn away from him. She gripped the balcony. In the distance, the mountains were deeper indigo shadows against the rich deep blue of the moonlit night sky. The entire world might have been at peace. The struggle was within herself.</p><p>\u201cI was very good friends with Adam Harrison\u2019s son, Josh, when we were in high school. He was bright, funny...charming. But most of the kids stayed away from him. They thought he was strange. He didn\u2019t run around giving out prophesies or anything, but there were moments when it was a little eerie. He knew when it was going to rain or snow, when the ponds had frozen over solidly, when the ice was going to break. There were other little things. He would be cramming for a test when we weren\u2019t supposed to be having one, and then we\u2019d walk into a class to find out that we were having a pop quiz. He knew when Mrs. Malone was going to be out for an extended time, because he had known when her husband was going to die. He didn\u2019t know everything\u2014it wasn\u2019t as if he had a crystal ball that offered up any image he wanted to conjure. There were just times when he did know things that there was really no earthly way he should have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I did know that Adam had a son. He was actually my grandfather\u2019s friend. They were both tremendous history buffs,\u201d Matt offered, his voice soft as he spoke behind her. \u201cWhere is his son now? Does he work for Adam as well.\u201d</p><p>Darcy shook her head slowly. \u201cJosh is dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. Truly sorry.\u201d Then, a moment later, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>Darcy shrugged and inhaled again. \u201cWe were in a car accident. I\u2019d been dating someone in high school forever, but we had a huge breakup just before senior prom. I asked Josh to go with me. He was great, but Hunter had a real jerk of a friend, and he decided to chase after Josh and play chicken with the cars after the prom. Hunter\u2019s friend was killed as well. I survived. And...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d he said, prompting her after a moment.</p><p>She turned around at last, her eyes meeting his. \u201cAt the funeral, I felt as if I was talking to Josh, as if I saw him. And it had been very strange, because he had known he was going to die. But he told me that it was all right. After that...well, I began to know the little things as well. Where something was when it had been lost. At first, it wasn\u2019t so bad. There were just little things, the day-to-day things. Just the way it had been with Josh. And I thought\u2014and even the therapist I went to thought\u2014that I was creating conversations with Josh in my mind as a way to accept his death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you weren\u2019t?\u201d He was still soft-spoken, watching her with curious eyes, and not those that as yet condemned and warily shut her out.</p><p>\u201cBut then, I started seeing other ghosts,\u201d she said flatly, watching for his reaction.</p><p>A slight smile twitched his lips, but he was making a serious effort not to mock her. \u201cWhat ghosts?\u201d</p><p>Again, she shrugged. \u201cI went to NYU, as I told you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>Darcy kept watching him. \u201cI was walking by one of the very old Episcopalian churches near my dorm and I ran into a woman in front of the church. She was pacing, looking really nervous and distraught, and,\u201d she added wryly, \u201cthough my folks had warned me when I went to school not to talk to strangers, she was so upset that I stopped and asked her if she was lost, or if there was anything that I could do. She looked at me as if she had seen a ghost, and said, \u2018You can see me?\u2019 I told her that yes, of course, I could see her. She touched my shoulders, and looked as if she was about to cry, and at the same time, she looked incredibly relieved. Then she said, \u2018I beg of you, find my granddaughter, Charisse, and tell her that the diamonds are in the Shirley Temple doll. Please, please, do this for me. She\u2019s in there now, in the church, and I can\u2019t seem to reach her, no matter how hard I try. She just can\u2019t see me.\u2019 I thought then that she might be seriously unhinged and I tried to reassure her, to tell her that, of course, her granddaughter could see her, and that she just needed to talk to her. But the woman shook her head violently, becoming so distressed that I told her I would go in and tell Charisse that the diamonds were in the Shirley Temple doll, whatever that meant. I left her on the sidewalk and started to walk into the church. I turned around, and I couldn\u2019t see her anymore. When I opened the door to the church, I saw that a funeral was taking place. Since I felt like an intrusive fool, I walked back out and looked for the woman again. I couldn\u2019t find her. I went back to my dorm. That night, when I was sleeping, I woke up to the sound of sobbing. I nearly had a heart attack. The woman who had been in front of the church was sitting at the foot of my bed. I had chills that went straight into my bones, goose bumps broke out all over my flesh. I couldn\u2019t even scream, I was so scared. But then, the fear just kind of locked in on me. She was sobbing in such horrible pain that I did manage to reach out and touch her. And she looked at me and said, \u2018You told me that you\u2019d tell Charisse. You don\u2019t understand, she supported me, and she had nothing, and I knew that I was dying, but that it would be all right, because when I died, she could sell the diamonds, and she and the children would be okay. Please, she cared for an old woman when no one else cared, she with Ben dead in that awful train accident, with two jobs and three children. You\u2019ve got to help me, help her, you have to, she can\u2019t hear me, though I try so hard.\u2019 I knew, I just knew then, that she was dead, that she was a ghost, and that I was somehow communicating with her just as if she were real, and sitting with me, talking to me, in the middle of the night.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cPerhaps you were dreaming,\u201d he said. His tone was logical and matter-of-fact, but he wasn\u2019t looking at her as if she were insane.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps I was. But it gets even better.\u201d She paused just a moment, watching him carefully. \u201cYou see, Josh was there again. It was as if he had come in behind the woman. And he seemed as natural about being there as if we were back in school, and he had met up with me in the cafeteria. \u2018Darcy, please, she just needs a little help. She can reach you, and she can\u2019t get through to her granddaughter. Darcy, it\u2019s a little thing. Just find her granddaughter,\u2019 he told me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo...\u201d Matt said, and the word was elongated, betraying a hint of doubt. \u201cYou told Josh that you would find the woman\u2019s granddaughter?\u201d</p> <p>She smiled. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t really remember. I woke in the morning, certain that I\u2019d had a dream myself. But I couldn\u2019t quite accept that. I went back to the church, and I found the minister, and I asked if there had been a funeral the day before that might have involved a woman named Charisse. He said yes, that a young woman named Charisse Whittaker had been the one to make arrangements for the funeral of her grandmother, Lanie Beacon. He asked if I was a friend of Charisse\u2019s. I told him not exactly, but that I had known Lanie. He seemed surprised, since apparently, Lanie had been very ill for some time. I asked if he could get a note to Charisse for me, so I wrote suggesting that she look in the Shirley Temple doll for the diamonds. He promised to get it to her for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he did?\u201d Matt queried.</p><p>Darcy nodded. He wasn\u2019t touching her. He just leaned against the balcony, listening, as if she was telling him about any event in her past.</p> <p>\u201cAnd then?\u201d</p><p>She hesitated. \u201cThree days later, Charisse called me. She was practically hysterical with gratitude, she had been nearly destitute, paying off her grandmother\u2019s bills. Though Lanie had been sick for a long time, apparently, she hadn\u2019t been in her right mind before she had died, and so she hadn\u2019t told Charisse much of anything about her jewelry. She had known that her grandmother had a few pieces, and had hoped to sell them to be able to pay off the funeral and medical bills. As it turned out, Lanie had actually had quite a small fortune in jewelry, gifts her mother had given her from her family, who had been some kind of Russian nobility. At any rate, Charisse was grateful to me, and sadder than ever about Lanie, because her grandmother had been so careful to hold on to the gems so that she might have them when Lanie died. She asked me how I knew, and I told her the truth. She didn\u2019t seem to doubt me at all, she just kept saying thank you and asking me if I needed any financial help or if I wanted any kind of reward. I told her that I was fine and that I hoped everything would go well for her and her children.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t want to meet you to say thanks?\u201d Matt asked.</p><p>Darcy smiled wryly. \u201cShe couldn\u2019t have been nicer or more grateful\u2014on the phone. She expressed no desire to meet me. I think the whole thing was quite...creepy for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter that?\u201d Matt asked.</p><p>\u201cThere were more...happenings. I was a theater major at the time. When I first went to college, despite what had happened on prom night and after, I thought I had the perfect life. I was in school in New York City. There was competition coming out of the woodwork, but I was also in the land of opportunity. I had wonderful film classes as well. An opportunity to work part-time for MTV. And, yes, I had some work modeling and I was making really decent money for a student. Then, I dreamed one night that I was at a funeral with a friend whose brother had died. It was so real that I told her how sorry I was the next day. She wanted to know why I was sorry. I realized that I had been dreaming, but then a week later her brother was killed in a boating accident. Naturally, I went to the funeral. And she accepted my condolences then, but I could see in her eyes she didn\u2019t want me anywhere near her, it was almost as if...as if I had somehow caused it to happen. I was seeing someone at the time too. Fairly seriously. We broke off that night. I felt terrible. As if I were some kind of a pariah. I went out to Queens the next day, to the cemetery. And I didn\u2019t actually see Josh then, but it was as if I could hear him. I wasn\u2019t exactly suicidal\u2014but I was feeling fairly desperate. But while I was just sitting there, I felt as if Josh were by me, telling me that I needed to go and see his father. I remembered Adam, how very kind he had been to me at Josh\u2019s funeral. While I was having that thought, I could swear that I saw all kinds of ghosts walking around the cemetery. One man in particular. He was wearing some kind of a uniform, but I didn\u2019t know what it was. I walked over to the gravestone where he was standing, and saw that he had died in 1780. The gravestone was hard to read, it was broken and untended, but I finally made out the words \u2018Revolutionary Hero.\u2019 So...I started telling him how grateful the nation was for all that had been done to give us our freedom, that we were far from perfect, but a truly great nation in the ideals for which they had fought and died. Anyway, he smiled, and disappeared, and I didn\u2019t feel quite so terrible, and the next day, I looked up Adam Harrison.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd he told you that you weren\u2019t ill, or insane, but that you had a special gift?\u201d Matt asked. She couldn\u2019t tell if there was skepticism in his voice or not.</p><p>\u201cNot that day,\u201d Darcy told him, smiling. \u201cHe broke down crying, and asked me about Josh, and I told him that Josh was just as he had always been, kind and there to help. And he asked me, next time I saw or heard his son, to tell him how much he had loved him, and cherished every day that he\u2019d had him with him. Then he asked me to come back. That\u2019s where we began. I did go back. I submitted to all kinds of tests, and I met other people who worked for him. People who experienced events the way that I had, and people with different forms of...extrasensory perception. I wasn\u2019t going to go back to school at first, but Adam suggested that I should, that we would keep close contact, and that he would be ready for me full-time whenever I was ready to come back. My interests had changed, however. I wanted to study human psychology, to help me deal with the people who had a bad time dealing with me. And I was fascinated then with history, architecture, old homes....\u201d She paused, shrugging again. \u201cAnd I\u2019m a good student. I don\u2019t think my IQ is off the board or anything, but I\u2019d always had a good bent toward the academic. So I studied, acquired the degrees I wanted...and then went back to Adam. Full-time.\u201d</p><p>He was quiet, watching her, waiting, perhaps, for her to say more. The night breeze continued to drift gently around them.</p><p>There was no more to say. And she was disturbed to realize just how anxious she was for him to say something that would show he wasn\u2019t so disturbed by her that he would turn away. Not now, perhaps. He was, in his way, a true gentleman. Raised to courtesy.</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to care. She knew better than to care. She shouldn\u2019t have gotten involved in any way with him, because she had studied so hard, learned so much about the human psyche. When she frightened people, they turned away. By the nature of her existence, she frightened people.</p><p>\u201cSo...?\u201d she murmured, wishing she didn\u2019t sound quite so desperate. She had longed to sound casual. Things were the way they were. She couldn\u2019t change the way that she was\u2014God knew, she would have done so years ago were it possible.</p><p>\u201cThere must be a certain satisfaction in feeling that you\u2019ve helped someone,\u201d he said. \u201cEven if it does happen to be someone dead.\u201d</p><p>He sounded polite, courteous, and even gentle.</p> <p>\u201cAre you making fun of me?\u201d she asked very quietly.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I know that you don\u2019t believe in ghosts, or the occult, in any way.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cI can\u2019t say that I\u2019m convinced. That I can suddenly fall on my knees and say that I\u2019m a true believer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe in you,\u201d he told her.</p><p>The breeze moved.</p><p>She must have heard him wrong.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He made a move toward her, taking her into his arms. His thumb stroked her chin in a way that made her incredibly warm. His eyes touched hers.</p><p>\u201cYou are quite different.\u201d</p><p>She arched her chin upward. \u201cIf you\u2019re not convinced that there is a world beyond that which most people know, you must think that I\u2019m a liar. Or insane.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cThere are often rational explanations for what doesn\u2019t seem rational at first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA scientific explanation for anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cBut you do believe in God, in a greater existence.\u201d</p><p>He hesitated. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow would you explain God, then?\u201d</p><p>A slow smile curled his lips. \u201cHey, we could get into a whole thing here on the missing link, Darwinism, and more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re missing my point. Belief is not tangible. God is not tangible. So...if there is a greater being, then there can be a much greater reality than the one we see daily, that most people accept.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about I say that I\u2019ll try to keep an open mind?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cI say that you\u2019re incredible!\u201d she breathed softly.</p><p>\u201cThere is one thing of which I am convinced,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are a force of nature!\u201d he said. She smiled. He swept her up. She slipped her arms around his neck.</p><p>\u201cManly muscles and sinew, you know,\u201d he teased.</p><p>\u201cTotally appreciated,\u201d she assured him.</p><p>He walked back into the bedroom.</p><p>By the time Darcy slept, it was so deeply that she wasn\u2019t so much as nudged by a vision or a dream.</p><p>Chapter 10</p><p>10</p><p>\u201cA dam!\u201d</p><p>Darcy was stunned and delighted when she came downstairs the next morning to find that Adam Harrison was in the dining room, sharing tea with Penny.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s my girl!\u201d He stood, straight and dignified as ever, a smile creasing his features as she hurried forward to greet him with a warm hug. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She pulled away from him, searching his eyes. \u201cI didn\u2019t know you were coming.

You know that.\u201d</p><p>She arched a brow. \u201cDid I send out a psychic distress signal of which I\u2019m not aware?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you really do that?\u201d Penny inquired with awe.</p><p>Darcy laughed, looking away from Adam to smile down at Penny, at the head of the table where she remained seated. \u201cI\u2019m not sure,\u201d she told Penny.</p><p>\u201cAnything is possible,\u201d Adam assured Penny. \u201cBut no, I simply came because, as I said, the situation in London is complex, and must be handled at a later time. And since Matt\u2019s granddad and I were such great old chums\u2014not to mention the fact that I paid Matt, rather than having Matt pay me, a most unusual experience, I do assure you\u2014I thought that I should add my moral support to Darcy\u2019s work here.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMoral support?\u201d Penny said. \u201cBut you\u2019re the head of the company\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, but not nearly as gifted as my very special associate here,\u201d Adam assured her. Darcy realized that he was looking at her with concern. \u201cI hear you nearly had a terrible fall yesterday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoards rotted, Adam. It was nothing. I didn\u2019t really fall at all. And it probably wasn\u2019t a life-threatening situation. I might have broken a few bones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny kind of a feeling about it?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cDid a ghost in the library shove me through the boards?\u201d she queried ruefully. \u201cNo. No feeling whatsoever. Boards rotted. Period.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, but Penny has been telling me that you made an excellent discovery in the woods,\u201d Adam said.</p> <p>Darcy had to smile. \u201cAdam, I\u2019m not sure that everyone would refer to a skull as an excellent discovery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA poor, brutalized girl can now be put to rest,\u201d Adam said, and his tone was both sad and serious.</p><p>\u201cWe will have a church ceremony, no matter how Matt feels,\u201d Penny said.</p><p>\u201cMatt just doesn\u2019t want a circus, I\u2019m sure,\u201d Darcy murmured.</p><p>Penny leapt to her feet suddenly. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019ve just been so charmed to see Adam that I\u2019ve completely forgotten my manners. Let me get you some coffee, dear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPenny, I\u2019m a big girl. I know where to get the coffee,\u201d Darcy assured her.</p><p>\u201cBut Penny is a Southern hostess of the most gracious variety,\u201d Adam said, staring at her in a way that said, Let Penny get the coffee!</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely my pleasure,\u201d Penny said.</p> <p>\u201cThen I will most graciously accept a cup of coffee, thank you, Penny,\u201d Darcy said.</p><p>With a brilliant smile, Penny went off to get the coffee.</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d Adam said, frowning. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAdam, honestly, I don\u2019t know. Usually, a wounded spirit is pleased to be eased. There\u2019s just something...I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJosh hasn\u2019t been able to help you?\u201d</p><p>It had taken a very long time, but Adam had accepted his son\u2019s death. He had even known it was coming, though he had never really sat down with Darcy and explained how, if Josh had talked to him, or if he had intuited the short life span of such a special young man. She thought for many years, though he had kept his own counsel on his feelings as well, that Adam felt a certain pain that she could communicate with his deceased son, while he could not. But whatever his personal pain, kindness had always been one of Adam Harrison\u2019s greatest virtues. His son had inherited the trait. For the good or the bad of it, she was sure it was why she and Josh had been best friends, and why he was still so often with her, even now.</p><p>She shook her head slowly. \u201cIt\u2019s very strange. It\u2019s almost as if he can\u2019t enter this house. As if there\u2019s a block...he helped me find Amy\u2019s skull, to see what happened in the woods, picture her murder. But I\u2019ve tried to reach him while I\u2019m in here. I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery strange,\u201d Adam said.</p><p>Darcy shrugged, opened her mouth to agree, then shut it again. Penny was returning with a mug full of coffee for her.</p><p>\u201cDid you see Matt?\u201d Darcy asked Adam, after thanking Penny.</p><p>\u201cBriefly. He was hurrying off to work when I arrived,\u201d Adam said.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a very good sheriff,\u201d Penny said proudly.</p><p>\u201cUm. And you might have mentioned that fact to me when sending me out here,\u201d Darcy said.</p><p>\u201cCome now. I\u2019m sure you two have managed to get along okay,\u201d Adam said.</p><p>Darcy was glad that he wasn\u2019t blessed with a true second sight, but she began to suspect he did have a special intuition, he seemed so amused as he spoke.</p><p>She merely smiled. \u201cI imagine he was quite glad to see you. I told you that he found me a poor substitute when I first arrived.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was glad to see me,\u201d Adam said. \u201cNaturally\u2014his granddad and I went way back.\u201d Adam hesitated, studying her. \u201cHe\u2019s also anxious about you being here now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Darcy said carefully.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s afraid you\u2019re going to get hurt.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t help the flare of anger that went through her. She\u2019d bared her soul to the man the night before, and he\u2019d claimed\u2014at least, she thought that he\u2019d claimed\u2014to have something of an open mind. But now day had come and Adam had arrived, and he wanted her out. \u201cI fell through some old floorboards, and didn\u2019t get hurt. And he doesn\u2019t believe in ghosts, so...?\u201d</p><p>Adam arched a brow to her just a hair, his eyes indicating the fact that Penny was listening. They never discussed their progress\u2014or lack thereof\u2014in front of others.</p><p>\u201cMatt is convinced that someone very much alive is pulling pranks,\u201d Penny said.</p><p>\u201cAttempting to kill or injure someone is a prank?\u201d Adam said.</p><p>Penny waved a hand in the air. \u201cFloorboards do rot. Matt is just being Matt. Suspicious. Because he thinks someone has been causing the disturbances at the house\u2014again, someone alive, and not a ghost.\u201d</p><p>Darcy was silent, uneasy for a moment. Because that one night, she had been convinced that there had been someone, alive and well, playing tricks as well.</p><p>\u201cHaving you attempted using sensors, photography, or tape as yet?\u201d Adam asked Darcy.</p><p>\u201cNo. You know me. I like to spend time without equipment first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. But don\u2019t you think it\u2019s time to bring it in?\u201d</p><p>She lowered her head slowly in acknowledgment, thinking that it was actually a damned good thing that she hadn\u2019t set up sound or videotape in her room as yet.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call Jenner later\u2014I understand his company is our contact,\u201d Adam said. \u201cFor the moment...Penny, would you excuse us? I\u2019d like Darcy to show me the woods.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course!\u201d Penny said. \u201cYou two go right on and get to work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Penny,\u201d Darcy murmured, and started out of the dining room, and then the house, Adam Harrison behind her.</p><p>They\u2019d passed the stables and walked some distance from the house before Adam spoke again. \u201cJust what do you think is happening in the house?\u201d</p><p>She glanced at him, smiling ruefully. \u201cIt\u2019s crawling with ghosts. There is a Civil War soldier in the place, definitely. A benign fellow, I believe. And perhaps he\u2019s happy, watching over the place. Most of the time, the feeling is quite good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept for in the Lee Room.\u201d</p><p>Darcy shrugged. \u201cMostly. I had a pretty strange chill in the living room once.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on, Adam. It doesn\u2019t make any sense. I\u2019ve done a lot of reading. There was a young woman who was having an affair with the heir to the house many years ago. She was supposedly an illegitimate relation from a few generations back. The young heir then married a proper young woman and his mistress, Arabella, disappeared. At least from the record books. She\u2019s not among Penny\u2019s known \u2018haunts,\u2019 or those she tells about on her legends tours. But I\u2019ve tried connecting with her...and I get no response. It seems as well that Josh isn\u2019t able to connect in the house, or in the Lee Room. As I said, it\u2019s very strange. Arabella should want to communicate, to let me find her, wherever she is, and perhaps bring to light the fact that she was murdered\u2014if, indeed, she was.\u201d</p><p>Adam was quiet as they moved down the path. \u201cDo you feel as if you\u2019re in any danger?\u201d</p><p>She stopped, staring at him. \u201cAdam, you know that, sometimes, I experience the fear of what went on years before. And I\u2019ve woken here shaken and frightened\u2014but it\u2019s nothing I haven\u2019t lived with before, and I\u2019m really determined now that I am on to something, that I can get to the bottom of this. I do believe that someone was murdered in that room. I\u2019ve gotten snatches of what happened in my dreams. Several times. You understand how that works with me. I\u2019m asleep, and somewhere in my mind, I know that I\u2019m dreaming. But I also become that other person in a way, and see and experience the situation from their point of view\u2014as it happened. I\u2019ve slipped in to the past life of a woman in the room\u2014and into the life of the man who came after her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you see their faces?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNot yet. I\u2019ve seen him reach the house. I\u2019ve seen her as she\u2019s been here, alone first, then realizing that he\u2019s come.\u201d She shrugged and let out a long sigh. \u201cLast night, I saw him race up the stairs after her, and he was furious. He\u2019s carrying a stretch or broken rein\u2014long enough to wrap around her neck, which is what I believe he eventually does. But the dream eluded me before I could see the end of it. Or even make out faces.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo you\u2019re close.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery close.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should keep watch while you sleep,\u201d Adam said.</p> <p>Darcy hesitated. She shook her head then. \u201cI\u2019m more frustrated than frightened. Honestly. I want to see this through. We should set up equipment, yes, and I probably should have done so a few days ago. But we\u2019re not going to get anything on tape\u2014maybe a little mist. I need to get to the bottom of the dream. I need for the entire sequence of events to play out for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand you had a seance here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and there was definitely a feeling of spiritual presence\u2014but not through the medium. The ghosts were probably laughing at us all that night. Except...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe malignant presence. I felt it that night, as well. But someone was definitely playing tricks that night. Parlor games. Rapping on the table.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWho did it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Adam paused on the walkway. \u201cAh-huh!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh-huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to recreate the seance.\u201d</p><p>Darcy grimaced. \u201cAdam, the woman who came was earnest and all that, but not a real medium.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t be silly. Your \u2018medium\u2019 will be here for the seance, of course. We need to recreate it with everyone present who was here that night. Except for this\u2014you\u2019ll be the medium this time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to try to figure out who was rapping on the table? I can tell you right now\u2014both Clint and Carter can be pranksters. And Penny is so determined that Matt believe in ghosts that she might have done it herself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be watching for the table rapper myself,\u201d Adam said. \u201cTo get to the bottom of the story with the ghost, we\u2019re going to have to find the mischievous living soul first.\u201d</p><p>Darcy arched a brow. \u201cThere\u2019s something not right. Most of the time, spirits just want us to tell what happened in the past\u2014see the evil culprit named, the truth known. This is all so very strange.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s see what happens at a seance when you\u2019re doing the communicating and I\u2019m doing the watching,\u201d Adam said. He turned back toward the house, then cast his face back in her direction again. \u201cEnough of a walk for me,\u201d he said cheerfully. \u201cCome along. We\u2019ve a lot of communicating with the living to do this afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want to have the seance tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy let grass grow beneath our feet?\u201d he cross-queried. \u201cSure. Absolutely. If it can be arranged, we\u2019ll plunge right in tonight!\u201d</p><p>Matt hung up the phone, groaned, and put his head down on his desk.</p> <p>Naturally, Shirley chose that moment to tap, and walk into his office.</p><p>\u201cMatt?\u201d she cried with concern.</p><p>He lifted his head, shaking it, and lifting a hand quickly. \u201cI\u2019m fine. Just ready to jump in a lake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Shirley was still frowning, disturbed.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing. Adam Harrison has arrived, and wants to repeat a seance at the house tonight.\u201d</p><p>Shirley made a thoughtful face, taking up a perch on the corner of his desk. \u201cWhat\u2019s so bad about that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShirley, you know that I don\u2019t even believe that there is a ghost. I think I\u2019ve got a real live person playing tricks around the place.\u201d He scowled. \u201cSerious tricks.\u201d</p><p>Shirley shook her head slowly. \u201cAny reports back on the wood from the library?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Soda.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey were weakened by soda. Some kind of cola spilled into them.\u201d</p><p>Shirley was silent for a minute. \u201cMatt, sounds as if some kid was in the library and spilled a drink that they weren\u2019t supposed to have in there in the first place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s what it sounds like, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Shirley was silent. \u201cMatt, do you think you\u2019re protesting this a little bit too much?\u201d she asked. \u201cI mean, really, does what happened at the library have to have something to do with anything else going on at Melody House?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it doesn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd yet you\u2019re still convinced that it does?\u201d Shirley asked softly.</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHunch, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMm,\u201d Shirley said thoughtfully.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell does that mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me ask you another question. I heard that your arrival at the library was incredibly opportune. You arrived just in time, before Miss Tremayne gave up her grasp on the wood. How and why do you think you arrived in just the nick of time?\u201d</p><p>He scowled. \u201cI probably knew that Darcy was hanging around the library and just wanted to check up on her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Matt, come on. You went there on some kind of a hunch, too. And how is a lot of police work done? Hunches!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGut reaction, from what we\u2019ve learned over years,\u201d Matt corrected.</p><p>\u201cAh, come on, you\u2019re doing that Shakespearean thing, protesting too much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShirley, please. You don\u2019t believe in ghosts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what I believe in,\u201d she told him earnestly. \u201cI certainly wouldn\u2019t say oh, yes! There are ghosts, I know it. But I\u2019ve seen far too many strange coincidences not to believe that there may be some form of ESP out there. Experts say we only use a very small section of our brains in our day-to-day lives. Maybe the human mind, or spirit, is capable of far more than the normal person ever gets to know. Hey! Can I come to your seance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShirley, I\u2019m really sorry. Adam Harrison wants to re-create the last seance we had down to the last man and woman, with only himself there as well, observing. But I tell you what\u2014the minute I hear they\u2019re going to pop out a Ouija board, your name is first on the invitation list.\u201d</p><p>By eight that night, all those who had attended the first seance had arrived at Melody House. David Jenner had his video set up, and Adam and Darcy had also arranged a small slew of instruments throughout the room, including a gauge to determine the temperature in different parts of the room, as well as an electrometer and magnometer which Adam explained were to measure electric and magnetic forces within the room.</p><p>Matt had stayed late at work, hoping to avoid most of the hoopla. Still, it was his house, and nothing was going on in it without him being there. He managed to shower and change and be down for eight, just as Adam was arranging the table to his liking.</p><p>Tonight, Darcy was to be the star of the show.</p><p>He had tried to behave no differently toward her. After all, Adam was the one who had come to take things over. And he had been entirely earnest the night before in his efforts to understand just what made her believe in all that she did. Try as he might, though, by daylight, he couldn\u2019t help but think that she was living in a world of her own mind, no matter what results she might be able to achieve. He knew that he was offending her with his brief words and marked distance.</p><p>But he didn\u2019t like having the seance, and that was that.</p><p>Elizabeth Holmes came to him and spoke softly but reproachfully. \u201cMatt, I really did know what I was doing. I was close, so close. I wish you would have let me try again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re professionals, Liz,\u201d he told her.</p><p>Her eyes scanned him. \u201cBut you don\u2019t believe in any of this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLizzie, I brought them in to find out what was going on.\u201d</p><p>Mae strode up, giving him a kiss on the cheek. \u201cOh, Matt! I do thank you for having me again. This is so exciting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had contact! I know I had contact!\u201d Liz continued.</p><p>Jason Johnstone was carrying a scotch as he joined their circle. \u201cI admit I\u2019m intrigued. Hey, Matt, it has been pretty different and amazing since Miss Tremayne arrived. I\u2019m going to cover the ceremony when you bury poor Amy\u2019s skull.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat, just great,\u201d Matt said, trying not to sound aggravated.</p><p>\u201cSee, Liz, you never found a skull,\u201d Mae said.</p><p>\u201cBut you were here! I did contact the dead,\u201d Liz insisted.</p><p>Carter sauntered on over, hand in hand with Delilah Dey. \u201cOur councilwoman is a bit nervous,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cSo spooky!\u201d Delilah said with a delicious little shiver.</p><p>So asinine! He almost retorted. Somehow, he refrained.</p><p>\u201cShall we begin?\u201d Adam called out.</p><p>They all began to gather.</p><p>\u201cDarcy, you\u2019ll take the middle seat,\u201d Adam said. \u201cClint...Carter, if you would take seats at her side. David, you\u2019ll be filming. Miss Dey...Delilah, if you would sit at Carter\u2019s side? And Matt, next to Delilah. Mr. Johnstone, we\u2019ll put you next to Penny over there, who will be next to Clint. Matt...you and I will take the ends of the table down here, with Mae and Elizabeth down here, between us.\u201d</p><p>They all filed into the chairs as Adam directed. Penny jumped up then, though, to lower the lights.</p><p>Adam remained cordial and cheerful throughout his instructions. Ever calm, casual, down-to-earth. He didn\u2019t advise that the house be darkened to a point of shadow\u2014evidently, the man wanted some light on the situation. Matt had to admit a tug of admiration for the old man, but then again, he knew that Harrison would allow for no charades.</p><p>Wasn\u2019t that why he had allowed Harrison Investigations in from the beginning?</p><p>Not really, he admitted to himself.</p><p>He\u2019d hoped that Adam would show up, and immediately prove that there was a hidden mike in the Lee Room or some such thing. Something Matt just hadn\u2019t seen.</p><p>But then...</p><p>He was a cop. A good one. He should have found any bugs by now.</p><p>\u201cIf everyone will take hands, we\u2019ll begin,\u201d Adam said.</p><p>Obediently, hands were held around the table.</p><p>Matt wasn\u2019t sure what he was expecting then. Adam speaking with a Vincent Price spookiness to his voice, maybe.</p><p>But Adam was as casual as if they were gathering for a picnic on the beach. \u201cPlease remember to keep contact with one another, hands on the table at all times. If anyone should become really frightened, just cry out, and we\u2019ll stop the proceedings.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOooh, I\u2019m scared!\u201d Clint teased, wide-eyed.</p><p>\u201cMe, too,\u201d Carter said. \u201cThank God I\u2019m hanging on to Delilah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarter, you rake!\u201d Delilah said with an appreciative giggle.</p> <p>\u201cReally!

The spirit within is too strong now, the emotions remaining are almost overwhelming. There\u2019s terror...and mistrust.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell Josh to be himself. Gentle, kind.\u201d</p><p>They waited. Darcy shook her head, and once again, there was silence.</p> <p>\u201cAsk the spirit itself to speak with us,\u201d Adam directed her.</p><p>She nodded, moistening her lips. \u201cPlease, we\u2019re here for you,\u201d she said. \u201cWe don\u2019t understand, but we\u2019re here for you. We need to understand.\u201d</p><p>Jason Johnstone shuffled his legs. Penny frowned. They all stared at Darcy.</p><p>Matt didn\u2019t know what to expect next.</p><p>What did come caused the hair to rise at his nape.</p><p>\u201cHelp.\u201d</p><p>It was Darcy who spoke the word, but it wasn\u2019t really Darcy at all. The voice wasn\u2019t hers. Her eyes were closed, her head was slightly lowered. Her lips moved, and sound came from them, but the voice that spoke wasn\u2019t Darcy\u2019s at all.</p><p>\u201cI never thought...as bad as it got...a killer, my God, a killer. That he could do such a thing...\u201d</p> <p>Penny gasped softly. Adam frowned at her sternly.</p><p>\u201cDo what? Who are you, please? We can\u2019t help if we don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my God!\u201d Darcy suddenly called in the strange voice.</p><p>\u201cWhat, please?\u201d Adam said.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t, can\u2019t...can\u2019t breathe, don\u2019t you see...the danger is...here, danger is with us, oh, God, you must see, must see, must...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d Adam inquired again softly.</p><p>There was silence for a minute. Penny\u2019s grip on Matt\u2019s hand was so hard that it threatened to break bone. Her eyes were open, her mouth was formed into an O. Mae, too, was just staring at Darcy, jaw slack with amazement. Clint and Carter were trying to appear skeptical, yet Matt was certain that his cousin was feeling a jolt of fear.</p><p>And as for himself...</p><p>Yes, he felt the sense of fear, too. A deep, strange unease. He didn\u2019t want to believe. Logically, he couldn\u2019t believe. And yet he felt it. Something very eerie. Something that created a chill, deep in his bones.</p><p>Elizabeth Holmes, the ex-medium of the moment, was simply gaping. And Delilah Dey looked as if she would cry out at any second.</p><p>Then a scream sounded. Gasping, high-pitched, rising to a shriek loud enough to shatter glass. It was Darcy, and yet, it wasn\u2019t Darcy at all.</p><p>They all jumped.</p><p>\u201cMaintain your handholds!\u201d Adam directed, and he spoke to Darcy. \u201cPlease, we\u2019re here, trying to help you.\u201d</p><p>Darcy shook her head wildly.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you so afraid?\u201d Adam asked.</p><p>\u201cHere, here, here...\u201d Darcy mouthed.</p><p>\u201cBut we\u2019re here, to help you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d The voice that wasn\u2019t Darcy\u2019s, but coming from her lips, cried out.</p><p>\u201cPlease, we need to know\u2014\u201d Adam began.</p><p>\u201cNo, no!\u201d The voice cried again in terror and anguish.</p><p>Once again, the sound of the scream shattered the night.</p><p>\u201cHelp me, God help me, help me!\u201d</p><p>And then, something worse. Choking, gasping, a desperate struggle to breathe. Sounds so terrible, and so real.</p><p>The sounds of a murder...</p><p>The sound of death.</p><p>Chapter 11</p><p>11</p><p>T his time, it was too much for Delilah Dey. She jerked free from the handholds around the table.</p><p>\u201cMy God! That\u2019s horrible! Please, turn on all the lights, please, make this stop!\u201d</p><p>To Matt\u2019s amazement, he felt the same way himself.</p><p>Hands were released. Darcy\u2019s eyes were wide and on Adam\u2019s again. She had a questioning look in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cWe have to give it up tonight,\u201d Adam Harrison said, staring at Darcy.</p><p>\u201cDrinks!\u201d Penny gasped out. \u201cDrinks. Would you all like drinks? I know I want one!\u201d</p><p>She leapt up. The circle was definitely broken. Delilah was shaking like a leaf blown in autumn. Jason Johnstone was white. Even Clint and Carter were looking unnerved.</p><p>Matt found himself staring hard at Darcy. Still so beautiful. Something inside him had to deny her, though. Deny what he had seen.</p><p>It must have been...theater!</p><p>A sham, all a sham. She was beautiful, smooth, cool, dignified...and a charade artist. Or half-crazy herself. How the hell had she done the voice? Because it was good, oh, hell, yes, he had to admit, it was good, really good, he had goose pimples rising on his own arms.</p><p>Dead was dead. He had seen the dead too many times. The dead did not come back to life.</p><p>No matter what he had seen, heard. No matter hints of something more played with his mind.</p><p>She knew. Although Adam had locked his gaze with hers, Darcy knew that Matt was looking at her. She turned to him. Distant, challenging, cool, and even contemptuous. As if she knew he was a liar. All the gentle words and tenderness he had offered were false. He might be madly infatuated with her elegant beauty and sensuality, but he was the one who was a sham. He couldn\u2019t handle it.</p><p>He was angry with himself, angry with her. He never gave away anything with his expression that he didn\u2019t mean to. He was a sheriff; he\u2019d been a cop too long. But Darcy could see right through him.</p><p>She turned away, dismissing him. She rose as if she hadn\u2019t been speaking in a different voice, as if she\u2019d never let out a scream that had just paralyzed an entire room.</p><p>\u201cPenny, let me help you. I\u2019d love a drink, myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll help, too!\u201d Delilah said quickly.</p><p>Adam looked at David Jenner. \u201cYou got it all on tape?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Mr. Harrison.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ll take it to my room,\u201d Adam said. He looked around at the others. \u201cIf you\u2019ll excuse me.\u201d</p><p>No one actually answered him. He took the tape from David, and left them.</p><p>\u201cI think I should go home,\u201d Mae said, still just sitting, staring blankly in front of herself. \u201cOh. I didn\u2019t bring my car, Delilah picked me up.\u201d She focused then, looking at Matt. \u201cI...well, I\u2019ll just have a drink, too, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you want to go home, Mae, I\u2019ll be happy to take you,\u201d Matt said. He rose so quickly he could have knocked the table over. It was his house.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t wait to leave it.</p><p>Mae said a few quick goodbyes, and Matt led her out to his car. She was silent as he started up the engine, then she said, \u201cMother Mary!\u201d Matt knew that she stared at him. \u201cThat was the scariest thing I\u2019ve ever seen in my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, she\u2019s good,\u201d Matt said. Good! What was he saying, admitting? Good. There were many ways to be good.</p><p>He realized that he was furious with himself, but he was furious with himself because of Darcy. And it couldn\u2019t be real.</p><p>\u201cShe can really contact the dead!\u201d Mae said with awe.</p><p>Matt found himself barking back at her. \u201cNo\u2014I mean that she\u2019s good as an actress. A damned good actress. That was her major before she came up with all those other degrees, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Matt!\u201d Mae said with dismay. \u201cYou can\u2019t believe that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d he said stubbornly.</p><p>\u201cGranted, I haven\u2019t gotten to know her anywhere nearly as well as you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight, you can bet on that,\u201d Matt said, a double edge of irony in his voice.</p><p>\u201cBut we both know she\u2019s not the kind of flimflam artist who would go around...giving people false hope, or making a mint on a pretense.\u201d</p><p>Matt stared at Mae. \u201cYou can\u2019t really believe that someone can just talk to the dead at will, can you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI sure believe what I saw tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you see?\u201d Matt said angrily. \u201cYou saw Darcy speaking, answering questions that Adam asked her, screaming like a banshee, and that was about it. Did she come up with any answers? Did she give us a name? A reason why this woman would be screaming and asking for help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDelilah jumped up,\u201d Mae reminded him. \u201cShe broke the circle, the communication.\u201d</p><p>Matt sniffed audibly. \u201cDarcy has been here some time now. And she hasn\u2019t the least idea of what is going on in the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but she found the skull in the woods,\u201d Mae reminded him. \u201cAnd she went through the floorboards in the library,\u201d she added frowning.</p><p>\u201cGod knows, she probably spilled cola all over the floor herself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMatt!\u201d Mae protested.</p><p>\u201cOkay, so that was coincidence,\u201d Matt said.</p><p>Mae shook her head. \u201cOh, come on, Matt. I know what you think. You believe that maybe even Penny is making things happen, because she\u2019s so into the concept of the house of being haunted. Or maybe someone else, for God knows what reason. You thought that if you had Adam Harrison out, he\u2019d find some immediate proof that everything that has happened was bogus. Well, that\u2019s just not true. And I always thought you were so smart. That you listened better than anyone I knew, which made you such a great sheriff. You could handle the really bad guys, and keep young pranksters from going down the wrong path. Well, now you\u2019re just being stubborn and stupid. And you know why? You\u2019re afraid. You\u2019re afraid to let go of any preconceived notion you have. You\u2019ve believed something forever, so it must be true.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Matt stared at her. He\u2019d never heard Mae so fierce.</p><p>\u201cEvery word I\u2019m saying is true. And I can tell you what other people won\u2019t because I knew your folks, and I\u2019m way too old to flirt with you, or any of that rot. I\u2019m just an old barmaid with a good eye and a good ear, but I care about you a lot, and I hate to see you act like an idiot!\u201d</p><p>He almost laughed, Mae was so determined to speak her mind.</p> <p>\u201cMae, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, no! Matt, please. What, are you letting your past slip into some of this? Darcy has red hair. Besides that, she isn\u2019t a thing like Lavinia, yet you automatically distrust her. Your ex-wife could stab someone in the back and smile while doing it. Darcy isn\u2019t a thing like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey! May I remind you, when Lavinia first came to Stoney ville, everyone thought she was the most beautiful, sweetest thing to ever walk the earth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe thought that for all of about two seconds. We were horrified by the time you two married. But hell, none of us had a right to say anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for the lecture, Mae,\u201d he said dryly.</p> <p>\u201cHow is Lavinia these days?\u201d Mae asked, smoothing her hair back. \u201cClint told me she used to call you constantly, even after the divorce. That she was jealous as all hell, even when she went back to her old social whirl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe must be happy, because I haven\u2019t heard from her in quite some time,\u201d Matt said.</p><p>\u201cShe must have found herself a new young stud somewhere,\u201d Mae said.</p><p>\u201cI hope,\u201d Matt said absently. Lavinia was the last thing on his mind at the moment.</p><p>\u201cRight, I know you mean that. But what you haven\u2019t gotten down right is the fact that Darcy Tremayne isn\u2019t anything like her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Mae.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAss!\u201d Mae muttered.</p><p>\u201cMae, look, I\u2019m damned sorry, but I do think this is all bull. Hey\u2014maybe it\u2019s even bull in her own mind. Hell, that\u2019s not a maybe. Because you\u2019re right. I\u2019m uptight, all right. And maybe that\u2019s why I\u2019ve been such an ass, and I\u2019m sorry. Darcy...is very different. Beautiful, and a wonderful person. She means to be decent. She believes all this herself. But she has dreams, wakes, and thinks they\u2019re real. She wants to conjure up a spirit, and so she does. Excuse me. It\u2019s just a little too creepy and ridiculous for me.\u201d</p><p>They\u2019d reached Mae\u2019s house. She slammed out of the passenger door and came around to peer into the driver\u2019s window, despite the fact that he had just started to back out.</p><p>\u201cAnyone could see the way it is between you two, Matt. Fire and ice. She makes you mad as hell, and hot as hell. Just like Lavinia. So, if you\u2019re really going to be such a pigheaded jerk, keep your pants zipped, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMae\u2014\u201d he began angrily.</p><p>She quickly retreated from the window. \u201cThanks for the ride, Matt. Good night.\u201d</p><p>She turned to walk up the path to her house. He swore, slammed his hands against the steering wheel, and backed out the driveway.</p><p>Darcy was always vaguely aware of what had gone on, even though she didn\u2019t know the particulars. The way everyone was behaving, she was certain that, if nothing else, there had been one hell of a show.</p> <p>She had apparently done Carter a favor though, or so it seemed. Delilah Dey\u2014whose eyes remained huge with fear and unease every time they fell upon Darcy\u2014was clinging to him.</p><p>Actually, they made a cute couple, Darcy thought wryly.</p><p>Cute couple, yeah, but the way that Delilah stared at her was surely as unnerving as anything she might have done during the seance.</p><p>Drinks had been served all around. David Jenner seemed the most blas\u00e9, while Clint appeared to be sympathetic as he looked at her, Elizabeth Holmes in awe, Penny concerned. Carter? Hard to tell, he was so busy being supportive to the lovely Delilah Dey. Jason Johnstone was reflective as he watched her, and appeared to be entirely open-minded. Unnerved perhaps, but not to the point of staring at her as if she were an alien.</p><p>Not as Matt had done.</p><p>Matt, gone now, naturally. Sure, he needed to give Mae a ride home.</p><p>\u201cHave you always been like that?\u201d Delilah asked her.</p><p>\u201cLike...?\u201d Darcy said, arching a brow. She knew what Delilah meant. She just wanted clarification.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Delilah said, hesitating.</p><p>Creepy? Is that what you mean? Darcy didn\u2019t say it out loud.</p><p>\u201cAble to...really get to dead people?\u201d Delilah said.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cI had a friend once. He taught me,\u201d she said simply.</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay,\u201d Clint said. \u201cDarcy gave us all a start. We\u2019ve all been so freaked out that we haven\u2019t stopped to wonder just what it meant.\u201d He was looking at Darcy expectantly.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m going to have to see the tape, Clint.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you, like, black out, when that happens?\u201d Jason asked her.</p><p>\u201cNot really. But I don\u2019t have a clear vision of what happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really had a different voice,\u201d Delilah told her.</p><p>\u201cA very frightened voice,\u201d Carter said.</p><p>\u201cThe point is, what was the voice so frightened of?\u201d Penny said.</p><p>\u201cRight. How can someone dead be so terrified?\u201d Delilah asked.</p><p>Darcy shrugged and answered slowly, carefully. \u201cHauntings are usually caused by a spirit\u2019s inability to get past certain moments in life. Maybe they haven\u2019t accepted the fact that they\u2019re dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay this is Arabella,\u201d Penny chimed in, excited, \u201cand she was murdered. Maybe she thinks that she can get help, and it won\u2019t happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s probably a line,\u201d Liz put in excitedly. \u201cA delicate, fragile line, between life and death. But those who died violently or in painful circumstances can\u2019t quite find the line. So they\u2019re in limbo. And still afraid, perhaps, of the things that frightened them in life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat may be the answer,\u201d Darcy told her.</p><p>\u201cWe have to find out what that poor creature is afraid of!\u201d Liz said.</p><p>\u201cI agree,\u201d Penny said, swallowing down the last of her scotch. \u201cAdam should have let us start over. Maybe we could try right now.\u201d</p><p>Darcy shook her head. \u201cShe won\u2019t come back now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know that?\u201d Carter asked.</p><p>\u201cFine lines,\u201d Darcy told him. \u201cShe\u2019s retreated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs she watching us?\u201d Clint asked.</p><p>Darcy hesitated. \u201cI don\u2019t...feel...anything right now. Whatever ghosts reside here, they\u2019ve all stepped back.\u201d</p><p>Delilah turned to Carter. \u201cI have my own car, but I think I\u2019m afraid to drive home alone.\u201d She looked abashed at Darcy. \u201cIt\u2019s so dark around here. These roads at night are creepy on their own, and I\u2019m going to think there\u2019s a ghost at my shoulder all the way home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDelilah, it will be my pleasure to drive home with you in your car,\u201d Carter told her.</p><p>\u201cI can pick you up,\u201d Clint told him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll just take a cab,\u201d Carter told him.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind coming to get you,\u201d Clint said.</p><p>Carter stared at him, smiling over clenched teeth as he tried to make a point. \u201cNo, Clint, thanks. It\u2019s all right. I\u2019ll just grab a cab.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Oh!\u201d Clint said, quickly lowering his head to hide a smile.</p><p>Liz yawned. \u201cI\u2019m exhausted. But so excited! Darcy, what you do is so incredible. Can you teach me?\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t do parlor tricks! Darcy thought. What I have can be a curse as much as a gift, and painful as well as rewarding!</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure I know how, Liz. It\u2019s a matter of keeping your mind open, I believe. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll get there,\u201d she said aloud. It was a lie. But there really was no truth to tell that could be understood. She rose. \u201cExcuse me, I think I\u2019ll go up with Adam and take a look at the tapes.\u201d</p><p>She made a hasty retreat up the stairs.</p><p>Adam was in his guest room, the Longstreet Room. When she tapped on the door, he bid her to enter absently. He was deeply engrossed in the tape when she went in.</p><p>Darcy watched it with him. She listened to the voice, and the fear in it.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s strange, as we\u2019ve all noticed, that a ghost can be so afraid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink it can be Arabella?\u201d Darcy asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I haven\u2019t had a chance to do the research that you\u2019ve done,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll show you everything that I dug into tomorrow,\u201d Darcy assured him.</p><p>Adam sat back, looking at her. \u201cMatt is still convinced that there\u2019s a living human creating most of his problems.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Darcy said. \u201cI heard noises one night and I have to admit, I was convinced myself that there was certainly someone living and breathing making them. But Matt was there, and he walked around the balcony, and found nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone could have slipped back in the house, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. But that doesn\u2019t account for the dreams, visions, and other phenomena.\u201d</p><p>Adam grinned. \u201cI know that, and you know that, but Matt is a skeptic. Still, it\u2019s an interesting situation. Why would someone pretend to be a ghost?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought that maybe Penny wanted a ghost so badly that she was helping to create one,\u201d Darcy said. \u201cOr maybe one of the guys was just having fun at Matt\u2019s expense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me more about those two\u2014Clint and Carter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClint is a cousin from the wrong side of the blankets, as they say. Carter is a friend. Heavily into real estate, I believe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Clint? What does he do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHang around, mostly. Penny is often despairing of him,\u201d Darcy said.</p><p>\u201cWhat does he survive on?\u201d Adam asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure. Maybe Matt\u2019s goodwill,\u201d Darcy said.</p><p>Adam nodded. \u201cI\u2019d like to spend tomorrow doing research. Get some things settled in my own mind. After that...maybe hypnotism?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Darcy was not fond of being hypnotized.

What do you say?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI say that he\u2019s entirely repulsed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI say that he\u2019s afraid,\u201d Adam told her.</p><p>\u201cMatt Stone? You know, his name fits. He\u2019s chiseled. He\u2019s like coming up against a rock. Hard. And unchanging.\u201d</p><p>Adam laughed. \u201cEven the hardest stone can be eroded. And maybe you\u2019ve shaken him to the core, which always make a man or woman don a facade as quickly as possible. He\u2019s a decent man. Give him a chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA chance for what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA change of thought. That\u2019s difficult to come by, you know.\u201d</p> <p>Darcy fell silent. Difficult. Impossible. If a ghost walked by in pure daylight, oozing ectoplasm, Matt would think he was seeing sunspots.</p><p>\u201cBy the way\u2014he\u2019s worried about you. He doesn\u2019t think you should be here.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe says you woke up terrified last night.\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cI just can\u2019t get a handle on this. I\u2019m more frustrated than terrified, Adam, really. I see this event unfolding. I\u2019ve taken on the persona of the man coming to the house, and that of the woman inside, waiting. I know that she\u2019s frightened, and I know that he has deadly intentions. When I have it, the dream goes a little further each time. Then...I lose it. I know that I\u2019m seeing the past, but something in the dream bothers me every time. There\u2019s something that I should see, but just don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat means that there is an end out there. We are getting somewhere, Darcy. You\u2019re seeing the event. We know that there is an entity, trying to tell us something. She\u2019s been reaching out, but she\u2019s still terrified herself. Poor thing. It\u2019s the depths of the fear she was feeling when she died. We have to make certain that we know who she is\u2014you believe it\u2019s this Arabella. So, we\u2019re getting close, very close.\u201d</p><p>Darcy smiled. \u201cAdam, I actually believe that this place is swarming with ghosts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably. But the rest of them seem to be happy ghosts. Just watching over the place. Arabella, or whoever she is, has the greatest power. And that\u2019s because she\u2019s so desperate to say something to us all. We\u2019ll get to it. By the way, I\u2019ve asked David Jenner to set up a few of the cameras and some tape equipment in your room. Is that all right?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course,\u201d she said. She\u2019s seen Matt\u2019s face that night. He wouldn\u2019t be coming back to visit her in the darkness of the night.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m right here, not a stone\u2019s throw away. Call me if you need me. Call if you think you may need me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, Adam.\u201d She gave him a kiss on the cheek.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right, Darcy? I haven\u2019t seen you this shaken since...since the beginning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she assured him.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t. She was hurt. But then she\u2019d known better than to fall for Matt Stone, to become emotionally involved. The truth of it was that she wasn\u2019t normal, and there just weren\u2019t many men out there willing to deal with her circumstances.</p><p>Adam was still staring at her. He knew her too well. \u201cAdam, I\u2019m fine,\u201d she said firmly.</p><p>\u201cMaybe Matt Stone is right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it\u2019s dangerous for you to be here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAdam\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the library?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAdam, this I know\u2014a ghost did not follow me into the library. I was alone when I stood on those boards. What happened was a coincidence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAdam, I\u2019m close. I know I\u2019m close. There\u2019s some little thing there that I\u2019m not seeing, and once I know what it is, the situation will be solved. I\u2019m certain. Good night, and please don\u2019t worry about me.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. Even as she left the room, he was rewinding the tape to study it once again.</p><p>Darcy walked to the Lee Room. It seemed very quiet. She didn\u2019t feel that the eyes watched her. Then she wondered if maybe the ghost was simply exhausted. Maybe the seance was as hard on their entity as it was on those living souls who had been involved.</p><p>\u201cLet me help you!\u201d she said aloud. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to hurt me or anyone. You have to get the courage together to let us know what happened.\u201d</p><p>There was no response.</p><p>Darcy locked the balcony doors. There would be no one slipping through them to see her tonight.</p><p>Weary, she got ready for bed, and crawled in.</p><p>The emptiness around her seemed absurdly loud.</p><p>Matt arrived back at Melody House, but for several long minutes, he remained in the car, staring at the house. Brick, mortar, and stone. It was a house, nothing more.</p><p>It was living history.</p><p>He thought about it and knew that he loved his house, no matter what.</p><p>And he was falling in love with Darcy.</p><p>No.</p><p>They\u2019d shared some time together. She should be perfect, soft-spoken, clear-eyed, dignified beyond belief, beautiful in her every movement. Kind to others...</p><p>And just plain damned weird.</p><p>Shaking him and everyone else straight down to their foundations.</p><p>He thought about Mae\u2019s words with irritation. Whether she meant to do so or not, Darcy was perpetuating ridiculous beliefs. Maybe she really believed everything she said. The power of the imagination was tremendous. He knew that. But to believe that ghosts could come back, or even that a ghost could be causing dangerous events, even come back as a killer....</p><p>He\u2019d known killers; too many of them. Men who killed in the pursuit of gain. Men and women so hung up on drugs they\u2019d stab their own mothers for a dollar. Even those killers who thought that God or dogs ordered them to kill. And then there were those who killed for the sheer pleasure of it.</p><p>Flesh, blood, real. More terrifying than anything imagined that could go bump in the night. And he had dealt with them so many damned times that to believe that brutality could exist in some fifth dimension was preposterous.</p><p>And yet....</p><p>How the hell had he known to go to the library the other day?</p><p>He swore softly and exited the car. He\u2019d taken his time getting home.</p><p>And to his great pleasure, his house was empty.</p><p>He locked up and climbed the stairs to the second landing.</p><p>He paused there. Darcy\u2019s door...the Lee Room. She wouldn\u2019t be expecting him. He knew that. It had nothing to do with ESP or instinct.</p><p>He had seen the way that she had looked at him.</p><p>He went into his own room and closed the door.</p><p>The dream came again.</p><p>She had dreaded that it would, but she had been anxious as well, desperate to experience what had happened, and see. See clearly, know exactly what had happened.</p><p>She entered into the mind of the man in the past. Saw what he saw.</p><p>The woman.</p><p>She was, the man knew\u2014beneath the rage that had risen within him\u2014always urgent, obsessive, beautiful. He had seen in her again everything that he had desired when she had appeared at the upper landing. He had seen the structure of her face, the shadow and light of the night, enhancing the sculpture and curves of her body, granting moonlit magic to her hair. She could create a fire with a single glance, whisper words that could drive a man to pure frenzy.</p><p>She could touch a man....</p><p>And do so many things. Bring arousal to life in seconds, manipulate the senses, tear into the mind.</p><p>Ah, yes, and she could do so much more.</p><p>His head was spinning, torn with pain. And she was running, but it appeared she did so in slow motion. He rose in much the same way, seeing the wall, the bed, the clock, ticking away the seconds, minutes, hours.</p><p>Ticking away the night.</p><p>He staggered to his feet. She was running; he had to run, too. She was so gorgeous in flight. Her appearance so fragile, so innocent. She ran....</p><p>As if she could escape.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t so fragile, and certainly not at all innocent.</p><p>Still, he was far stronger. He followed her out the door.</p><p>And faster.</p><p>She was captured in the replay of the past, yet her own resources blindly guiding her, Darcy rose in her sleep, anxious to catch up with the specters of time gone by. She moved like a wraith in the night, sliding across the floor, opening the door\u2014that through which the spirit images had so easily drifted.</p><p>She came to the landing, to the rail, and looked down the stairway.</p><p>But a sound behind her startled her back to life. She felt a fierce shove, slamming her hard against the railing where she teetered precariously for several seconds.</p><p>She came to full wakefulness in a split second, realized her position, and instinctively fought to right it. She was strong enough herself, and quickly maintained her grasp and equilibrium, her mind working quickly and with outrage.</p><p>Someone real, alive and well, had been on the upstairs landing. She had heard a real noise. And real hands had attempted to push her over!</p><p>Righted, she spun around.</p><p>Matt\u2019s door was moving.</p><p>Opening? Or closing?</p><p>She stood against the rail, her heart in her throat, staring. The door seemed to close another inch, and then to open.</p><p>In boxers and a robe, Matt emerged, striding out on the landing, eyes touching on Darcy, then looking up and down the second level.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing out here?\u201d The question sounded like a bark.</p><p>She swallowed hard. She knew him\u2014didn\u2019t she? Or did she think that she knew him because she had been so tempted to sleep with him? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>No. Whether they ever spoke two civil words again to one another or not, she didn\u2019t believe that Matt Stone was the type of man who would push a woman over a railing to her death.</p><p>\u201cDarcy! What\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>Still, she hesitated. She couldn\u2019t tell him. She didn\u2019t believe that she had been accosted by a ghost, but then...it hadn\u2019t been until she had heard the noise, felt herself in extreme danger, that she had really snapped clearly from the force of the vision.</p> <p>And whether she told him that she believed she had been attacked\u2014by either a ghost or a living being\u2014he would start insisting again that she was somehow in danger. He would force her from the house. And her instincts were good\u2014she really could protect herself.</p><p>She hoped.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t sleep,\u201d she lied. \u201cI was just trying to...imagine what might have happened here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should never lean against a railing like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo? I suppose not.\u201d She pushed away.</p> <p>He was tense. His hands were knotted at his sides, his features drawn. She was certain he had no idea he looked so fierce.</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t run around the house at night,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know that I believe there\u2019s a person behind all this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh? Who, Matt? You, Penny? Or do Carter and Clint slip into the main house at night? Or could it be the groundskeeper, that great guy, Sam, who works out there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he said flatly. \u201cThe point is, you, of all people, shouldn\u2019t be running around the house at night.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy me, of all people?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019ve got an imagination that would put any child to shame.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d she inquired icily.</p><p>\u201cOh, come on, Darcy, that\u2019s the point. You really do believe everything that you say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. Damn, I really need a psychiatrist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you do.\u201d</p><p>It seemed as if the words pained him. His fingers were still balled into his palms. A pulse throbbed at his throat.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you so ridiculously angry with me?\u201d she demanded.</p> <p>\u201cBecause you\u2019ve let this happen to you!\u201d he exclaimed. \u201cDarcy\u2014\u201d</p><p>He started to take a step toward her. She shook her head vehemently, backing away. \u201cNo, Matt, I haven\u2019t let anything happen to me. You should see the psychiatrist. You\u2019re so set in your ways it\u2019s amazing that you even agree to daylight savings time. Excuse me, will you? I\u2019m going back to bed.\u201d</p><p>She walked by him, heading for the door to the Lee Room. As she passed him, it was almost as if he touched her. He didn\u2019t move. She could still feel the heat emitting off him in great waves. She could somehow feel his vitality, his tremendous strength, and his emotions.</p><p>Was that what remained? Such emotion, passion, laughter, love, anger?</p><p>She walked on by, breathing the scent of him. Beloved scent of him. Not to be. She wasn\u2019t the possessor of an incredible imagination, and she wasn\u2019t acting, from either anything made up, or anything believed.</p><p>Fuck him.</p><p>She could bend.</p><p>Matt Stone could not.</p><p>She wanted to cry. Spin around, beat against his chest. To what end? She had no power to change what lay within a man\u2019s mind. What she knew, what she did, had no tangible proof.</p><p>\u201cDarcy?\u201d Her name sounded somewhat strangled on his lips.</p><p>\u201cGood night, Matt.\u201d</p><p>She walked into the Lee Room, and closed the door.</p><p>The dream didn\u2019t come to her again that night. She slept easily, yet awoke, a strange sense of fear slipping into her thoughts.</p><p>The sense had nothing to do with ghosts.</p><p>She had slept on through the night; she had not been bothered.</p><p>And yet, by day, her vision seemed clear, and her mind entirely rational. Someone had been out there on the landing with her last night.</p><p>Living, breathing.</p><p>And with deadly intent.</p><p>Chapter 12</p><p>12</p><p>D ownstairs, Darcy discovered Adam in Penny\u2019s office, going through the many volumes of history and legend there. When Darcy tapped on the door and entered, he slid his reading glasses from his nose and smiled at her.</p><p>\u201cGood morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood morning, Adam. What have you found?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ve read through the information on Arabella, and she does sound like a likely candidate, but then again...nothing conclusive. I\u2019d like to do a great deal more reading here, and then, this afternoon or early evening, around dusk, I\u2019d like to try hypnotism, if you don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you last night. It\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>He nodded and waved toward the door. \u201cGo get yourself some coffee. Matt is at work, Penny is off shopping...I think Clara is around working somewhere. Do you have any plans?\u201d</p><p>Adam liked to do his reading alone. She knew that. He was politely suggesting that she make some plans, if she didn\u2019t have any, and let him get on with his work alone.</p><p>\u201cActually, there is something I\u2019d like to do today,\u201d Darcy told him.</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m heading back to the library.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Adam said.</p><p>\u201cMrs. O\u2019Hara told me about someone else who had an en counter here. A maid who was working right around the time that Matt\u2019s grandfather died. Marcia Cuomo. I\u2019d asked Mrs. O\u2019Hara to have her call me, but as yet, she hasn\u2019t done so. I think I\u2019ll stop by and ask Mrs. O\u2019Hara for Marcia\u2019s phone number or address, and see if I can\u2019t speak with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think the library is still closed, with inspectors checking out stairways and floorboards everywhere,\u201d Adam advised her.</p><p>\u201cAh. Well, then, I\u2019ll see if Mrs. O\u2019Hara is answering the phone there anyway,\u201d Darcy said.</p><p>Adam nodded his assent, already turning his attention back to the tome in his hands.</p><p>Darcy wandered into the kitchen. As always, coffee had been left for her. She helped herself to some and then started back up the stairs to the Lee Room.</p><p>As always, she paused when she was in the room, and waited. But this morning, the ghost was remaining still.</p><p>The information operator connected her with the library, where an answering machine picked up. But Mrs. O\u2019Hara left her home phone number on the service, should anyone have an emergency.</p><p>It was hardly an emergency, but Darcy was beginning to feel a sense of urgency in regards to the ghost and whatever else it was that was going on at Melody House.</p><p>Mrs. O\u2019Hara was not upset at being called, and was happy to give her Marcia Cuomo\u2019s home phone and address.</p><p>Since Marcia Cuomo\u2019s phone rang and rang, Darcy thought she\u2019d drive by the residence just for something to do. She could hope that Marcia would return in the interim.</p><p>Penny had taken her car, but Adam had driven down from D.C. in his Navigator, a car Darcy loved. She ran downstairs to ask him if she could take it, and waved a hand in the air, she hurried back upstairs to grab her purse and Adam\u2019s keys.</p><p>Someone had been up cleaning her room in her absence. The balcony doors had been left open. Darcy started to close them, then paused, tempted to walk out and feel the sunshine and the breeze. As she did so, she was startled to hear sound from Matt\u2019s room. She walked over to the doors that opened to his room. They were locked. She peeked in a window.</p><p>There was someone in the room. She couldn\u2019t see clearly because the sun was so bright outside and the shadow so deep within.</p><p>Matt? Back from work for some reason? She raised a hand to tap on the window, then thought better of it.</p><p>Why speak with him?</p><p>Yet, as she stood there, the man at the desk looked up. She could see nothing but his form in darkness, nothing at all of his face. He stood stiff and rigid, staring back.</p><p>Matt, and he wasn\u2019t happy to see her, peeping through his window.</p><p>She turned, walked back into the Lee Room, grabbed her purse, and started out. Halfway down the stairs, she turned around and walked back up the stairs. At Matt\u2019s door, she paused a minute, but heard a rustling sound within. Firmly, she rapped on the door.</p><p>No answer.</p><p>\u201cLook! I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean to stare in your window!\u201d</p><p>Nothing.</p><p>Beneath her breath, she called him a few names.</p><p>\u201cMatt?\u201d</p><p>Still no answer. But she was certain someone was in there.</p><p>\u201cFine. Sorry, I\u2019m leaving,\u201d she called out.</p><p>She ran on down the stairs, but at the landing hesitated. There was a phone on a little marble table beneath the arch of the stairway. She walked over to it, and flipped through the index on it, easily finding his number at work. She dialed, and a woman answered the phone.</p><p>\u201cIs the sheriff there, please?\u201d Darcy asked.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not available right now. May I take a message?\u201d the woman asked.</p><p>\u201cUm, when will he be in?\u201d Darcy asked.</p><p>\u201cOh, he is in\u2014he\u2019s just not available. He\u2019s in a meeting with the county code inspectors. Can I have him call you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks, I\u2019ll just talk to him later.\u201d</p><p>Darcy started to hang up, then hesitated.</p><p>She could have sworn she heard an extra click on the phone, as if someone had been listening in on an extension.</p><p>She hung up the phone slowly. She stared up the stairs, then walked up them resolutely. She lifted a hand to knock at Matt\u2019s door. The door swung inward; it hadn\u2019t been securely closed. \u201cMatt?\u201d she said, stepping into the room.</p><p>She looked around his office area, then walked into the bedroom. She knew that the place was empty.</p><p>Whoever had been in there was definitely gone now.</p><p>Her heart thudding, she once again walked down the stairs. It was all very, very, strange.</p><p>Far stranger than communicating with the dead, in her opinion, she thought wryly.</p><p>\u201cDid I have any calls?\u201d Matt asked Shirley, exiting the conference room.</p><p>Since the accident in the library, he had gathered the council to suggest that a number of their civic buildings be given a thorough once-over.</p><p>Except that he was still having a hard time believing the truth that he had learned from both the local building inspector and his friends in Washington\u2014the rot had been caused by the simple spill of soda. \u201cImagine what it can do to a stomach, huh?\u201d Shirley had marveled. He had known then that her kids were going to be looking at straight water and milk for a long time to come. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOne call, and she didn\u2019t identify herself,\u201d Shirley said.

I have to be in court. Niles Walker was running around naked again last month, and I want to see that his family takes care of him humanely. Call me on the cell if you need me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure thing.\u201d</p> <p>Matt started out, then stopped, swearing silently to himself.</p><p>\u201cShirley?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf Darcy Tremayne calls through and needs me in any way, make sure that she gets the number, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCertainly, Matt.\u201d Shirley watched him, somewhat covering a smile of amusement. Then she frowned. \u201cDo you think she\u2019s in some kind of danger?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy should she be?\u201d he asked.</p><p>And realized that he was thinking, Yes! Definitely, yes. And why...</p><p>Damned if he knew. Gut feeling. Except that he was determined he just wasn\u2019t going to have any more gut feelings.</p><p>He suddenly wished that he didn\u2019t have to be in court. No gut feeling\u2014he was just worried. Darcy had acted so strangely on the stairway last night.</p><p>She had stared at him, as if he frightened her.</p><p>Worse than that, she had looked at him with something else in her eyes.</p> <p>Suspicion?</p><p>Damn the whole thing.</p><p>\u201cLater, kid,\u201d he said to Shirley.</p><p>\u201cLater, Matt,\u201d Shirley agreed, and went back to her paperwork.</p><p>Adam sat back, puzzled. Darcy was right\u2014it certainly sounded as if Arabella was the prime candidate for such a haunting. A woman who had considered herself a rightful heir to the property, thrown over so that her lover could marry a proper spouse. Yes, she sounded just right.</p><p>He sat back.</p><p>And yet...</p><p>He tossed his reading glasses on the desk and rubbed his eyes. Darcy had told him that there was something else, something she just couldn\u2019t touch.</p> <p>Yet.</p><p>She would.</p><p>He rose and walked to the window, worried himself.</p><p>Was he putting Darcy in danger? Shouldn\u2019t he, at the least, explain why he had been so determined that they get into Melody House?</p><p>He couldn\u2019t, he thought with a sigh. Not yet. He couldn\u2019t color her opinions in any way, make suggestions, or even give hints that could throw her into the wrong direction. He just had to wait. This afternoon, under hypnosis, she might reveal a great deal.</p><p>He glanced at his watch. An anxious tick pulsed in his throat.</p><p>He should have gone with her.</p><p>Darcy was glad that she had driven out. When she knocked on the door of the old Victorian house near the small, lazy downtown section of Stoneyville, the door was instantly answered.</p><p>The woman might have been young. She was medium height, with dark hair, blue eyes, and a nice figure. But her face had a haggard appearance, the type that came from a difficult life. For some, it was bearing the burden of a house, husband, job, and children while struggling under a mound of debt. For others, it was the abuse of alcohol, drugs, and tobacco. Once, this woman had been very pretty. Now, she just looked exhausted.</p><p>But she was very pleasant, smiling at Darcy. \u201cYes, can I help you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope so,\u201d Darcy said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to disturb you.\u201d She hesitated, then explained. \u201cI\u2019m a psychic investigator.\u201d</p><p>The smile on Marcia Cuomo\u2019s face disappeared. She started to close the door on Darcy.</p><p>\u201cPlease! Wait, hear me out. I\u2014I got your name from Mrs. O\u2019Hara at the library, and I need your help. You definitely weren\u2019t crazy or anything of the like.\u201d She bit her lip. \u201cPlease, I\u2019m not here to mock you or malign you, others have had experiences at Melody House and I really need your help!\u201d</p><p>Marcia hesitated, then opened the door. \u201cCome in, please.\u201d</p><p>Darcy stepped into the house. It bore a look of genteel poverty.</p><p>\u201cCoffee? Or iced tea? This is summer, huh? I don\u2019t keep anything stronger in the house.\u201d She stared at Darcy, still stiff. But then, she sighed, as if believing in whatever empathy she saw in Darcy\u2019s eyes. She made a complete turnabout, admitting, \u201cI joined AA\u2014I never wanted to give anyone a reason to doubt my credibility again. Then, of course...there was just life to deal with.\u201d Marcia offered Darcy an ironic shrug. \u201cOne good thing about Melody House. I left there and went straight to a meeting. How\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re an alcoholic, a very good thing,\u201d Darcy said earnestly.</p><p>Marcia smiled, all her defenses seeming to melt away. \u201cIced tea, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love some.\u201d</p><p>A few minutes later, they were seated in the Victorian parlor with tall glasses of iced tea. Marcia pointed out a few of the antiques, and told Darcy the house dated from the 1870s. \u201cNot very old, not in these parts, anyway. But a great-grandfather of mine built it, so...well, I try to hang on to it. I\u2019ve been learning a lot about carpentry myself, and my son comes down from New York to help me now and then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have a grown son?\u201d</p><p>Marcia smiled again. \u201cHe\u2019s twenty-two. I\u2019m afraid I was one of those young ladies who had a high-school affair, and finally ended up with a four-year-old by the age of twenty. I screwed up a lot, I\u2019m afraid. Danny\u2019s father helped out somewhat, but we never married, and he was killed in an industrial accident a few years after Danny was born. So...anyway, life is good now. Danny is great. Went to school on scholarships, and he\u2019s got a great job with NBC now. So...he helps out. I won\u2019t accept any of his money, not yet. It\u2019s too hard to live in the big city. But he brings a few buddies down now and then and we all paint and do odd jobs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow wonderful,\u201d Darcy said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sweet. But you\u2019re here for a reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Darcy stared steadily at her. \u201cI believe with my whole heart that there is a ghost in the Lee Room, and I\u2019d like to hear about your experience there.\u201d</p><p>Marcia stared back at her, and then shrugged. \u201cYou see, the thing of it was, I was drinking that day. I went to work with a little flask all the time. I loved the place, too. I\u2019d worked for Matt\u2019s granddad now and then, knew all the guys around the place, even pretended I didn\u2019t know about a lot of the fooling around going on there, you know what I mean? Lots of women thought it was hot to let guys like Carter, Clint, and even Matt pick them up, you know, then screw around in a supposedly haunted room as truly historic as the Lee Room. The old man was tolerant of Clint, of course. And even Carter. Matt was gone a lot\u2014he was working in D.C. before his granddad got sick, but when he was home, well, you meet a pretty girl, you get to tell her that you live in an incredible mansion like Melody House...Well, that\u2019s all beside the point. I was cleaning up there one day and suddenly it feels as if my hair is being pulled. Not tugged by a breeze, or anything. Pulled! Hard. I whipped around, thinking I was losing my mind. Then I hear this voice. And it\u2019s soft and moaning and going, \u2018Help. Help me! Please, for the love of God, help me!\u2019 I thought at first that one of the fellows was just kidding around. So I yelled at them to stop. Then...I thought I saw something. Like a little glimmer of light, heading out of the room and down toward the landing of the stairway. So I followed...peeked down the stairs, and the next damn thing I knew, I was lying at the foot of the stairway! By the mercy of God, I didn\u2019t break my neck. Penny found me there, and I suppose I reeked of alcohol. Still, I started raving, told her what had happened, that I\u2019d been shoved down the stairs by a ghost. Penny is just dying to have ghosts there\u2014I would have thought she would have believed me. But then again, I don\u2019t think she\u2019d ever realized before that I did drink on the job. She didn\u2019t fire me. Only Matt could fire me then\u2014his granddad had passed away. But with the way Penny looked at me, all disgusted over the way that I smelled, I knew that no one would believe me. Not even Penny. And Matt...if he knew, he\u2019d say it was the alcohol for sure.\u201d She let out a long sigh and shrugged. \u201cI told Penny that I was leaving, to please tell Matt. And she told me to get help, and she\u2019d never tell him the real reason that I left. So...some people know now. Cathy O\u2019Hara, over at the library, is a saint. She had a run-in with vodka in her twenties, and was my mentor at the meetings. So...she knows all about me. And my experiences. The thing of it is, though, I don\u2019t talk about it, even when I hear about new episodes at Melody House, because I wouldn\u2019t be credible in any way to most people. Hell, I\u2019m not sure I would have been credible to myself at the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, alcohol or not, I think you did meet up with a ghost. A dangerous ghost, so it seems. But at least, it did do something good for you,\u201d Darcy said.</p><p>Marcia smiled. \u201cYes, the occasion did change my life. But I can tell you one thing\u2014I\u2019ll never step foot inside Melody House again. Ever.\u201d She studied Darcy. \u201cPsychic investigator...so? Have you seen the ghost?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that there is a ghost in the room, and that she\u2019s trying very hard to make us understand something. I think she may be a woman who lived there hundreds of years ago by the name of Arabella,\u201d Darcy told Marcia.</p><p>\u201cYeah, maybe,\u201d Marcia said.</p><p>\u201cYou have another idea?\u201d Darcy asked her.</p><p>\u201cNo...no.\u201d Marcia shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t know\u2014I had worked there before, that\u2019s all. Been in and out of that room dozens of times. And I\u2019d never felt anything before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>Marcia nodded. \u201cIt was about...I don\u2019t know, five years ago, I think. You could check the records. But I\u2019d done parties in that house, worked part-time, forever.\u201d She grimaced. \u201cArabella sure has taken her time getting around to whining, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess she has,\u201d Darcy said, then asked, \u201cIs there anything else you can remember that might help me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish. Like I said, I was drinking back then. I wish that I could help you more.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBelieve me, you\u2019ve helped me a lot,\u201d Darcy told her. \u201cI guess I\u2019d better get going. It was a pleasure to meet you. And thank you so very much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy pleasure,\u201d Marcia assured her.</p><p>\u201cAnd\u2014\u201d Darcy began.</p> <p>\u201cIf I do think of anything else, I promise, I\u2019ll call you right away. Hey! Tell the gang hi for me, will you? Clint, Carter, Penny\u2014and Matt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do that,\u201d Darcy said. She waved as she walked out to the car, feeling as if a bunch of puzzle pieces were in front of her.</p><p>Their positioning should have been obvious, and she was certain, if she just tried hard enough, they would all fall right into place.</p><p>Just what was it that she was missing?</p><p>There was time to go back to the office when the judge adjourned the court for the day. Matt realized that he simply didn\u2019t want to go back.</p> <p>Adam had never told him how long he and Darcy planned to be at Melody House. He could remember Adam telling him, \u201cIt\u2019s not a paint job. I can\u2019t really estimate the hours we\u2019re going to need. But don\u2019t worry about it. You\u2019ll be able to go about your day-to-day business with no interference.\u201d</p><p>Hah.</p><p>All right, so they didn\u2019t really interfere with his life. Not by just being there.</p><p>But there was this ridiculous tug. Not a hunch, or a gut feeling. He was anxious to be at the house.</p><p>Anxious, sure, because there were people in it.</p><p>There were always people in Melody House. They hadn\u2019t rented any of the rooms for now, and they hadn\u2019t scheduled any tours. But if they really needed to, they could. He was just loathe to do so until...</p> <p>Until whatever was happening was solved\u2014and not happening anymore.</p><p>He turned his car toward home, then poked the speed dial on his phone for home. Penny answered. \u201cHey,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on there?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNothing much. I\u2019m in the office, calling a few people. Juggling some Christmas parties\u2014do you believe we have to book this early? Of course, it\u2019s exciting, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDarcy around?\u201d he broke in.</p><p>\u201cYes, she and Adam were just having tea, and they\u2019re going up to the Lee Room soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s all right?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPerfectly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas she been in all day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, actually, she wasn\u2019t here when I finished shopping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere did she go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHonestly, Matt! I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t give her a third degree every time she walks in or out of the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should,\u201d he muttered beneath his breath.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever mind. By the way, call the appropriate minister and see if we can\u2019t have a little rite and get that skull buried tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTomorrow, Matt? That\u2019s too fast! We won\u2019t be able to invite people, to have the press.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMatt!\u201d</p><p>\u201cPenny.\u201d</p><p>He heard a huff so loud the wind from it almost came through the phone. \u201cAll right, Matt. As you wish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Penny. You\u2019re a doll.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re a tyrant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat on earth was that?\u201d Penny murmured.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he asked, frowning.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know...a thudding sound. I\u2019ll go see. Bye, Matt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPenny, don\u2019t hang up\u2014\u201d</p><p>His answer was the dial tone. He tried to call back, and got the answering machine. Swearing, his lowered his foot on the gas pedal.</p><p>Adam knew that he was a good hypnotist, but there was also no subject in the world quite like Darcy.</p><p>They had talked awhile when she\u2019d returned that afternoon to tell him about her visit to Marcia Cuomo. They had gone over the various events that had occurred in and around the house, and both agreed that there was something very peculiar about the ghost\u2019s desperation\u2014and fear.</p><p>Most of all, Adam was disturbed that Josh didn\u2019t seem to be able to enter the house, the realm of onetime violence. He had always been Darcy\u2019s spiritual guide, and he knew that she sometimes felt lost without him.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a force that keeps him away, and I can\u2019t understand it,\u201d Darcy explained, shaking her head.</p><p>Adam was silent for a minute. There were still so many things that he would never understand. He had never had the abilities Josh had possessed, now passed on to Darcy, but he did have a tremendous skill with the occult and it saddened him that he couldn\u2019t reach his own son, not the way that Darcy could. He had always recognized an extra sense in others, and he had known how to mentor and lead those who were confused and horrified by their own gifts.</p><p>He had begun Harrison Investigations when his wife, Carol, had died, and Matt had only been a child. His son had told him then, at the funeral, that his mother was there, trying to make them both understand that she would never really leave them, that she would be with them forever. He had wanted to contact her himself so desperately, for the pain of her loss had been devastating. And yet, he\u2019d known that Josh had spoken the truth when he talked about seeing his mother, for he had told Adam things that only Carol had known, and in the time that followed, he had discovered himself incensed by those who claimed to be mediums and merely took the bereaved for all they were worth. In his pursuit of lies, he had stumbled upon truth, and found his own fascination with the sixth sense and the powers of the mind\u2014and spirit.</p><p>Death had not been a terrifying prospect for Josh. He had known that his mother would come to take his hand, just as he had known that he was not meant to have many years on earth. Josh\u2019s certainty regarding his own early demise had chilled Adam, and yet Josh\u2019s calm acceptance of the fate awaiting him and the knowledge that he would reside again with his beloved mother had been a strange comfort for Adam.</p><p>And though his son wasn\u2019t with him, there were times when Darcy could make him feel as if Josh were in a room, joking with them, helping them.</p><p>In the realm of the world of the dead, however, Josh was not an old soul. And there were barriers he could not cross, forces he could not best.</p><p>Adam thought that pure malevolence was something Josh couldn\u2019t touch. He had been far too decent to know evil. Perhaps, one day, he would gain the strength to go against such a force. Not yet. He was a spirit as kind and patient as the human he had been, able to touch pain, sorrow, regret, and loneliness, simply not a lingering wall of brutality.</p><p>\u201cAdam,\u201d Darcy said softly. \u201cJosh doesn\u2019t come in this room.\u201d</p><p>Adam nodded. \u201cIf I\u2019m frightened for you, Darcy, I\u2019ll bring you right out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI trust you completely, Adam,\u201d she told him. And he knew that she did. He reached out and squeezed her hand.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s begin,\u201d he said, and she settled back.</p><p>They were in the Lee Room together, she lying on the bed, he in the chair by the little secretary against the wall.</p><p>Adam had suggested that they work alone, quietly, without having the household around. There had been too much disruption at the seance.</p><p>\u201cRelax, breathe. In and out, in and out. Think of cool mountain streams, the sweet sound of the trickling water. Let nothing disturb the sweetness of the moment, the absolute calm and tranquility that seep into you with every breath.\u201d He didn\u2019t dangle chains in front of her face; he talked her into a state of calm, cleared her mind, and left it open to possibility. \u201cThink of nothing, just feel the peace of the water, of the wind. Ease all your muscles, stretch, release, relax, and feel the air, fresh, clean, free...you\u2019ll enter a state like sleep, totally open, and let those who would speak come through, but you\u2019ll be safe, because when I say the word \u2018redhead,\u2019 you will awaken with ease. Follow my voice, and listen to the breeze, the water, and let the voices enter in....\u201d</p><p>His voice droned on. He could see the changes as Darcy entered a stage of consciousness that was neither sleep, nor wakefulness.</p><p>\u201cThere is someone here,\u201d he said then. \u201cSomeone who resides in this room, and perhaps roams the house upon occasion. Someone hurt, brutally hurt. I\u2019m here to listen.\u201d</p><p>He waited.</p><p>For a moment, there was nothing. Then, he started as the phone book flew off the secretary and landed with a hard thunking noise on the floor.</p><p>A moment later, Darcy\u2019s lips moved.</p><p>\u201cHelp, God help me.\u201d</p><p>The voice they had heard at the seance left Darcy\u2019s lips. The spirit spoke in a desperate moan through Darcy.</p><p>\u201cWe must know who you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s danger...danger.\u201d</p><p>A strange sound, a moaning, a keening.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got to explain,\u201d Adam said patiently.</p><p>\u201cAfraid...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mustn\u2019t be afraid.\u201d He hesitated. \u201cYou\u2019ve gone on. Nothing can hurt you now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo...still here. He\u2019s still here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho? We must understand who you are, and who he is, and why he is still here. You\u2019re not the one hurting people, he is\u2014is that right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Adam was startled and silent.</p><p>Darcy was beginning to breathe harder and harder. He needed to keep talking. \u201cAre you hurting people?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo...hard. So hard...to touch. I\u2019m tired...exhausted. They won\u2019t see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you hurting people?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Showing them, trying to show them...they don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you Arabella?\u201d</p><p>Darcy\u2019s lips began to move. She said something, but Adam didn\u2019t hear what. The door to the room flew open, and Penny was standing there.</p><p>\u201cMy God!\u201d Penny said. \u201cWhat on earth was that?\u201d</p><p>Adam frowned fiercely, shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d Penny said softly, staring at Darcy, who still lay on the bed, eyes closed, breathing coming deeply, shallowly.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s all right?\u201d Penny asked. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPenny, please be quiet,\u201d Adam said.</p> <p>\u201cMust...be careful. More than me, I\u2019m certain. I knew...the girl. I thought...for the power, for the money,\u201d Darcy said in the strange voice.</p><p>\u201cWho? Please, you\u2019ve got to be more specific,\u201d Adam prodded gently.</p><p>\u201cAfraid...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be afraid,\u201d Adam said.</p><p>Darcy began twisting in distress.</p> <p>\u201cAdam!\u201d Penny said.</p><p>Another voice interrupted them from the hallway. \u201cHey, what the hell?\u201d</p><p>Clint had come up the stairs, and was standing behind Penny.</p><p>Adam kept his voice low, his tone even. \u201cI need you two to either go away, or stand there silently.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d Clint began.</p><p>Adam waved a hand at him and Penny, trying to shoo them away. Darcy was becoming more and more mired in the emotions that had once raged her, but Adam was certain that they were very close to a breakthrough, and he didn\u2019t want to break the tenuous thread that was connecting them to the spirit.</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s...she doesn\u2019t look well!\u201d Clint said, deeply concerned. \u201cYou should stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe will,\u201d Adam said calmly. He stared at Clint. \u201cWhen I\u2019m ready.\u201d</p><p>Clint was unhappy, and uncomfortable, but he locked his jaw and was silent.</p><p>Darcy murmured something low.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t hear you,\u201d Adam said, rising, and going to sit on the bedside.</p><p>Darcy\u2019s muscles were tensed like bowstrings. A sheen of perspiration had broken out on her face. She tossed on the bed, hands going to her throat.</p><p>Clint rushed into the room. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to stop this!\u201d he told Adam.</p><p>\u201cHere, here, here...\u201d Darcy murmured.</p> <p>The door slammed inward with force. Adam saw that Matt Stone had arrived on the scene.</p><p>\u201cWhat in hell is going on here?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>A sudden breeze blew and the balcony doors flew inward. Distracted, Adam looked toward the balcony. He heard something scrape against the wall, just beyond the doors.</p><p>\u201cHere, here, with us, run...go, no, no, there\u2019s no help, I have no help, alone, oh, please if you could hear me, if you could just hear me...help!\u201d</p><p>Darcy screamed, clawing at her throat.</p><p>\u201cStop it!\u201d Matt snapped.</p><p>Darcy was contorted, her back arched. For a moment, it appeared that she had been dragged straight upward, almost off the bed.</p><p>\u201cStop!\u201d Matt shouted with thunder in his voice.</p><p>Darcy started to let out the terrible choking sound they had heard the night before. Her face was growing more and more flushed, beginning to resemble the red of a boiled lobster.</p><p>\u201cRedhead!\u201d Adam said.</p><p>She didn\u2019t respond. It seemed as if there were a rope, suspended from the ceiling, drawing her ever upward.</p><p>\u201cHere, he\u2019s here! Are you blind!\u201d she garbled out.</p><p>Here? Adam thought. Was that it? Both specters lived on in this room, with the poor girl reliving her own death every time she tried to cry out for help?</p><p>\u201cHere!\u201d Darcy shouted, then began choking.</p><p>They heard her breath, rasping, ridiculously loud in the room. Shorter, shorter...she ceased to fight, her body was falling....</p><p>As if she were dying.</p><p>\u201cJesus, stop this, stop it instantly!\u201d Matt said.</p><p>The sound continued.</p><p>\u201cAdam!\u201d Matt shouted.</p><p>\u201cRedhead!\u201d Adam stated loudly.</p><p>Darcy fell back on the bed like a rag doll, every bit of tension eased from her body, the color fading as quickly as it had come.</p><p>Her eyes didn\u2019t open.</p><p>Matt pushed his way over to the bed, slipped his arms around Darcy, dragging her up.</p><p>She lolled, still like a doll...broken.</p><p>He pressed his fingers against her throat, feeling for a pulse.</p><p>\u201cDarcy!\u201d</p><p>She began to blink, then stared at him blankly, not even aware of the way he held her.</p><p>\u201cDarcy!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d</p><p>He was shaking. \u201cDarcy, are you all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, I\u2019m fine!\u201d</p><p>His eyes had been filled with anxiety and fear. They seemed to take on a clouded edge. He swore angrily, still shaking, set her down, and strode from the room.</p><p>As the others watched him leave, Adam became aware again of a scraping sound against the outer wall.</p><p>Chapter 13</p><p>13</p><p>P enny and Clint were staring at her, Darcy realized, as Matt Stone left the room. Adam could bring her out of a state of trance quickly and completely, but that time, she had felt a little disoriented, the more so because it seemed that she had opened her eyes to see Matt staring down at her like a raging bull. The force of his emotion sent a sinking sensation throughout her, then a rise of anger. She didn\u2019t know what had happened, but it must have been something that clearly demonstrated there was something beyond their known world. Matt simply didn\u2019t want that to be the truth, and so he continued to deny it, no matter what he saw or heard.</p><p>Darcy looked to Adam, but he was the one person in the room not paying any attention to her. Adam was heading out the balcony doors.</p><p>\u201cDarcy?\u201d Clint said hesitantly. \u201cGood God, Darcy! Do you feel faint, ill? Should we call a doctor? Do you need something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she assured him. \u201cI\u2019m really, truly, honestly fine. If there\u2019s any sense of danger, Adam gets me out of a trance. And once I\u2019m out of it...I\u2019m fine. Please believe me.\u201d</p><p>Clint kept staring at her, but then nodded slowly. \u201cWhat...what happened?\u201d He asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid not. Did we learn anything?\u201d she asked anxiously.</p><p>\u201cI...don\u2019t think we learned anything more,\u201d Clint said, looking at Penny.</p><p>\u201cIt was like last night,\u201d Penny said. She added softly, \u201cVery scary. You\u2019re...not scared now?\u201d</p><p>Darcy shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I must have been very deeply under. I don\u2019t remember anything. I was listening to Adam...and then looking into Matt\u2019s eyes.\u201d</p><p>She was surprised by the look of anger that flashed across Clint\u2019s face then, and she thought it was for her. But it wasn\u2019t. \u201cI\u2019m sorry that Matt can be such a jerk,\u201d he said. \u201cBut, hey, that\u2019s his problem.\u201d He walked forward into the room, offering her a hand. She accepted it, rising. \u201cI think we should get out of here. How about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo out? The two of us?\u201d she said. She really didn\u2019t remember anything, and yet she was still a little slow as she made the transition back into the world of the living. Hypnotism was very different. Sometimes, she knew snatches of what happened, as if she had been a distant observer. Sometimes, as on this occasion, she had no recollection at all of anything that had gone on.</p><p>He smiled. \u201cNot a date\u2014you\u2019d turn me down. I mean, I think we should go out. You, me, Adam, Penny, Carter, if we can find him. Clara, if she\u2019s around, even old Sam. Anyone we can round up. We need to get out of this house for a while.\u201d</p><p>Adam walked back in from the balcony, wearing a frown of deep introspection.</p><p>\u201cAdam?\u201d Darcy said.</p><p>\u201cYes, what?\u201d he said, as if startled by being drawn from thought.</p><p>\u201cWould you like to go out?\u201d Darcy said.</p><p>\u201cOut where?\u201d Adam asked.</p><p>\u201cAnywhere away from the house. Heck, even the Wayside Inn,\u201d Clint said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be fun,\u201d Penny said, but didn\u2019t sound entirely certain.</p><p>Adam smiled. \u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see who I can round up. We\u2019ll meet downstairs in ten minutes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like a plan,\u201d Adam said.</p><p>Penny and Clint turned to leave them. When they were gone, Darcy walked to the door, closed it, and turned to Adam.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d</p><p>He grimaced. \u201cWe\u2019re close.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it Arabella?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d he said slowly.</p><p>Darcy frowned. \u201cThen...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. But I agree with what you\u2019ve been feeling, that we\u2019re very close, that the ghost is afraid, so afraid that she can\u2019t quite tell us what she is so desperate to say. We have to figure it out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it seems that we\u2019re hitting a wall at the same place every time,\u201d Darcy said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m afraid that I\u2019m going to be thrown out of here any minute now.\u201d</p><p>Adam waved a hand in the air. \u201cMatt would never force you to leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t seen the way he looks at me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know Matt.\u201d</p><p>Darcy arched a brow.</p><p>\u201cScared ghost\u2014scared sheriff,\u201d Adam said, shrugging.</p><p>\u201cNeither makes much sense, does it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you\u2019re dealing with matters of life and death, faith and belief, things don\u2019t have to make sense, Darcy. You know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe we\u2019re letting this all go too easily. They\u2019re gone now. You should hypnotize me again, we should pursue this with greater intensity\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDarcy, no. Whether you want to admit it or not, there\u2019s too much stress in what we do to repeat it with that kind of frequency. And I\u2019m not sure we could make contact again. Spirits seem to possess only so much energy themselves. Clint has the right idea. Let\u2019s get out, do something. Are you ready? Do you want to change or anything?\u201d</p><p>She grinned. She was in jeans and a tank top. \u201cFor the Wayside Inn? No, I think I\u2019m formal enough.\u201d</p><p>He offered her his arm and started for the door.</p><p>\u201cAdam,\u201d Darcy said suddenly.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat were you doing out on the balcony?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh...nothing. Looking around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought I heard something out there, while you were under. But when I went out, there was nothing, no one. Must have been birds, or a squirrel or something. Heck, maybe the old place even has a rat population.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCharming thought,\u201d Darcy said.</p><p>\u201cHm. I was just thinking. What do they do in these old places when they have rats?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTraps,\u201d Darcy said. \u201cOr exterminators. Or maybe even they bring in a cat.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCat! Precisely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m just thinking out loud at the moment,\u201d he said. \u201cCome on, I\u2019m anxious to see this Wayside Inn, the heart of society in Stoneyville!\u201d</p><p>As it turned out, Clint\u2019s idea was not a bad one.</p><p>Matt had disappeared, but Clara Issy had been folding sheets in the laundry room and Carter had been working on his real estate papers in the stables; both were eager to spend some time out. Even Sam, the caretaker, joined them. Adam and Clara did the driving, since she was heading on home after and Adam never drank alcohol. Whether Darcy wanted one or not, he was determined that she had a drink\u2014a big one.</p> <p>When they arrived, the Wayside Inn was jumping. A band was playing a cross between rock and country and there were a number of pool players in action. Mae and a few younger barmaids were bustling about. Carter instantly challenged Darcy to a game of pool. She imagined that he was certain he could best her in a matter of minutes, but he was to be sadly mistaken. She could play the game with a decent skill.</p><p>David Jenner was playing at one of the tables when they arrived, and Delilah Dey was there as well, sitting at the bar. Since Carter had challenged Darcy, but David had possession of the table, Darcy suggested she partner up with David. That way, Carter could ask Delilah to be his partner.</p><p>Delilah was very pretty, and certainly, she was intelligent and savvy regarding Stoneyville.</p><p>But she was no pool player.</p><p>Darcy had thought that she might be somewhat distracted from the afternoon events, but she wasn\u2019t. She sank three balls on the break, and within a matter of minutes, she and David emerged the winners.</p><p>\u201cMy turn!\u201d Clint challenged.</p> <p>\u201cWho\u2019s partnering who?\u201d Carter asked.</p><p>\u201cOne on one. Darcy and me,\u201d Clint said.</p><p>An \u201cOoooh!\u201d went out through the bar.</p><p>Darcy laughed, feeling her competitive spirit rising.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the bet?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cWinner takes all, of course,\u201d Clint said.</p><p>\u201cOh? And what would that be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me think,\u201d Clint said, then brightened. \u201cI know. You and me. Dinner\u2014somewhere other than here. And a movie.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGo for it, Darcy!\u201d Adam told her.</p><p>\u201cI can beat you, you know,\u201d she told Clint.</p><p>\u201cMaybe. And then maybe, hey, the South shall rise again!\u201d Clint teased. \u201cWhat can you lose? A night out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s if I lose?\u201d she said, laughing.</p><p>\u201cIf you win, you get to pay,\u201d Clint told her.</p><p>She grinned, and bent down to slide her cue.</p><p>This time, the game was tough, and it seemed that it went on and on. The entire bar seemed to tune in, and even the musicians went on break to make comments, call out encouragements, and monitor the game.</p><p>Darcy was caught up in the contest, enjoying the challenge. Clint was good, very good. When she took the first game, he called for two out of three.</p><p>She lost the second.</p><p>They started the third.</p><p>Clint made a shot which left her with a dangerous play. Her only shot would set her dangerously close to the eight ball. As she walked around the table judging angles and distances, she became aware of the sensation of being watched.</p><p>It was strangely familiar, and yet...</p><p>Not at all unearthly.</p><p>Of course, she was being watched. Everyone in the bar was watching her.</p><p>And still...such a strange feeling.</p><p>She hesitated, straightened, and looked around.</p><p>She was startled to see Matt at the bar. But he was the only one in the room not watching her. He was on a stool between Adam and Penny, talking to Mae, who was behind the counter.</p><p>She gave herself a shake, unnerved by both the sensation, and the fact that Matt was there.</p><p>\u201cMs. Tremayne...?\u201d Clint prodded, grinning.</p><p>\u201cYou think you\u2019ve got me, don\u2019t you?\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re in a tough spot,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cCheck\u2014but not checkmate,\u201d she told him.</p><p>She would not let Matt ruin the good time she\u2019d been having here tonight. Very carefully, she gave her attention to the game, focusing.</p><p>She made the shot, setting up the eight ball so that she could easily call the side pocket. A second later, she sank it as well, and victory was hers.</p><p>Her effort was met with thunderous applause, and a round of congratulations from the friendly folk around her. She smiled, and saw that Adam was watching from the bar, and that he seemed very pleased to see her having a good time.</p><p>Matt still hadn\u2019t glanced her way.</p><p>Clint set his cue down and walked away, but came right back, bearing two beers, one for her, one for himself. He clicked his bottle to hers. \u201cI concede. With tremendous graciousness, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>They both leaned against the table. He looked at her, smiling ruefully, shaking his head. \u201cSo you can play pool, too. Who would have known?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy dad liked pool,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m supposed to be pretty good, you know,\u201d Clint said. He leaned closer to her suddenly. \u201cDon\u2019t look now, but Carter is putting the moves on Delilah at last.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood for him,\u201d Darcy said.</p><p>\u201cNot a bad match,\u201d Clint mused. \u201cHe prefers to hang around Melody House, but Carter\u2019s quite a mogul. He needs to clean up a few of his holdings, but, hey, he has invested in a number of good land and property deals. And there\u2019s the young councilwoman. Should work out well, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>Darcy nodding, sipping her beer, studying Clint. \u201cWhat do you want out of life, Clint?\u201d</p><p>He laughed suddenly. \u201cAm I nothing more than a sad reprobate, living off the largesse of my far more responsible family member?\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI did not ask a question anything like that!\u201d she protested.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve actually been working very hard on a project that should come through at any time,\u201d he told her. \u201cBut don\u2019t give me away, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t give you away. I don\u2019t know anything about it,\u201d Darcy told him.</p><p>\u201cHm.\u201d He studied her. \u201cYou can\u2019t read my mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd...\u201d He hesitated. \u201cYou really don\u2019t know anything more than what you\u2019re saying about the ghost at Melody House.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I can intuit things, sometimes, but I can\u2019t read minds,\u201d she told him.</p><p>His grin deepened. \u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019d probably want to slap a lot of people a lot of the time, if you knew what they were thinking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a strange way, I think that\u2019s a compliment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s meant as a compliment\u2014even if a strange one.\u201d He lowered his head to whisper against her ear. \u201cWhat do you think old Matt is doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaving a beer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think he can let you out of his sight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think he\u2019d be delighted for me to be permanently out of his sight.\u201d</p><p>Clint shook his head. \u201cNo. You\u2019ve gotten under his skin. Big time. He\u2019s just being a jerk. Want to make him jealous?\u201d</p><p>Darcy smiled. \u201cThanks\u2014but no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s nuts about you. And he should just admit it.\u201d</p><p>Darcy touched his cheek affectionately. \u201cClint, I\u2019ll agree that he was attracted to me. But nothing will go beyond that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe can\u2019t deal with me.\u201d</p><p>Clint weighed that for a minute. \u201cHe can\u2019t deal with his fear for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy should he be afraid for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDarcy, you should have seen him last night. Of course...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course what?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you myself. It was damned scary. And this afternoon was worse.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t answer him, but took a long swig of her beer.</p><p>\u201cDarcy,\u201d he said, \u201ccould you take on a past experience with such reality that you could die?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I never get into a trance or allow myself to be hypnotized unless Adam is running things. I trust him implicitly. So...it never gets that far. He says a single word, and I snap out of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe spoke to you twice before you recognized his command.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe probably didn\u2019t speak loudly enough,\u201d Darcy said.</p><p>\u201cHe spoke loudly,\u201d Clint told her. \u201cDarcy, I have to admit, this afternoon was scarier than last night. I know how determined and confident you are, but...maybe you ought to just drop this case. What if you wind up being in the soul or spirit or whatever it is of the ghost\u2014and unable to get out? Today it was as if...as if you were dying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill, Darcy,\u201d he said, \u201cAren\u2019t you ever scared yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTerrified, at times,\u201d she assured him.</p><p>\u201cThen why do you do this?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cWhy do people become cops, or firefighters? What I do is nowhere near as dangerous as anything like that.\u201d</p><p>Clint exhaled, shaking his head as he looked at her, and yet doing so with a certain admiration. \u201cYou are a good kid, Darcy. Still, you should give this one up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d she said simply, and determined to change the subject. \u201cWhat about you, Clint? What is it that you really want out of life?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019m going to get it very soon,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she pursued.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid if I tell anyone, I\u2019m going to jinx myself,\u201d he said, laughing. \u201cHey, but I\u2019m not the old ne\u2019er-do-well you think I am. Ask Matt. Penny runs the household, Matt is the sheriff. Sure, he has final say. And, of course, we have Sam to run the grounds. But who do you think makes sure that the little things get done on a day-to-day basis? I find the right roofers and carpenters, I see that the outbuildings are repaired. I\u2019m not such a bad guy, really.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t suggest that you were,\u201d Darcy said. \u201cI was just curious about what you really wanted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, sure, because the house is Matt\u2019s.\u201d He laughed suddenly. \u201cDon\u2019t look at me like that. I don\u2019t have any plans to off my kin so that I\u2019m the only Stone left to inherit the place. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d want Melody House. The place can be a damned headache. The upkeep is exorbitant. But don\u2019t worry about me. I have a few college degrees of my own\u2014I taught for a few years, did you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. What did you teach?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEnglish. Hey, don\u2019t look now, but the sheriff has been watching us suspiciously. Want to make him jealous?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Darcy said, smiling as she shook her head.</p><p>\u201cToo bad,\u201d he said, but lightly.</p><p>\u201cWell...what shall we do now? Want to order some food? I\u2019m ravenous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds good.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd there\u2019s an empty table over there. Let me see if I can gather the forces.\u201d</p><p>They headed for the table Clint had indicated, gathering their group as they did so. Adam had been deep in conversation with Matt, but the two of them joined them. Whatever his anger had been earlier, Matt displayed none of it at the Wayside Inn.</p><p>Neither did he come particularly near Darcy. When the conversation at the table started to veer toward the haunting at Melody House, Matt stepped in to ask Carter about some of his properties, and Adam kept the ball rolling, wanting to know more about the general area. The meal passed pleasantly, and when it was over, yawns around the table indicated that it was time to go home.</p><p>Darcy drove back with Adam, Penny, and Carter. They reached the house first. Darcy went straight up to the Lee Room. Adam went with her, taking the video and audio tapes that had been running from the recorders, and resetting them.</p><p>\u201cYou are all right in here?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d she assured him.</p> <p>\u201cI can stay in the chair, if you want,\u201d Adam said.</p><p>\u201cAdam, if I don\u2019t let these dreams come, I\u2019ll never see it out to the end.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cBut you\u2019re sure you\u2019re all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes! Get out, Adam. Go to bed,\u201d she told him.</p><p>He kissed her cheek, and left her.</p><p>Darcy had just started to doze when she thought she heard movement on the balcony. She lay in bed for several seconds, listening.</p><p>After a moment, she got up and went to the French doors, but didn\u2019t open them. She paused, and listened. Sound...movement. She moved the draperies, her heart seeming to pound in her throat.</p><p>There was someone on the balcony. Matt. He was at the rail near the door to his own bedroom suite, looking out at the night.</p> <p>She hesitated, wishing she could go out. There was no reason to do so.</p><p>Painfully, she turned, and went back to bed.</p><p>The woman in white.</p><p>That night, Darcy saw her, standing at the foot of the bed. She was in a haze; Darcy saw no details in her face, no colors, just the woman, in sheer white, standing at the foot of the bed.</p><p>Then, she faded.</p><p>And the dream came. Somewhere inside herself, Darcy knew that the woman was growing more desperate, determined that Darcy understand.</p><p>Darcy slipped into the entity. Into the woman. And into the past.</p><p>She ran.</p><p>She made it out of the bedroom, and to the landing. And it was there that he caught her, falling upon her.</p><p>She struggled briefly, aware of his heat and strength as he grappled her down.</p><p>Once...</p><p>It had been so different. But now, she knew.</p><p>Still, she fought fiercely, struggled, desperate, aware that her life was at stake. The very urgency gave her a burst of power she might have never known that she possessed. She scratched, swore, kicked, punched, and fought to gouge out his eyes. She caught him with such a blow against the jaw that he went immobile, and she took full advantage, shoving wildly against his body, casting him off. She crawled to free herself from the sprawled weight of his limbs. She staggered up herself, and made the first step, but his fingers entwined around the hem of her gown, dragging her back down. She fell atop him, the breath knocked from her, and for a moment, they both lay panting. The pain in her temple dazed her; she realized she had hit her head on the second step. At her side, while she remained paralyzed, he rose up to a half-seated position beside her. And again, their eyes met. Something within his softened suddenly. He reached out a hand. She flinched, but his fingers felt as gentle as raindrops against her cheeks. \u201cI did love you so much,\u201d he said.</p><p>She touched him in return. He came to his feet, reaching for her hands, drawing her up and against him, and it might have been as many another night, when they had melded together, when passion had reigned every thought, when she could not bear to keep her hands off him, or he her. The room continued to spin, the pain in her temple was deep...but it seemed that he was whispering now, the words that could so arouse...and his hands, they were on her, his lips...nuzzled those whispers against her throat.</p><p>It was a fight, surely, nothing more. His eyes could not have been so deadly.</p><p>His whisper came again, against her lips, throat, her earlobes, her mouth, hard then, crushing against her. And she was falling...into his arms. She was aware of the sound of his footsteps against the hard wood floor, aware of his movement as he bore her weight.</p><p>They returned to the bedroom, and he set down upon the bed, tenderly. She closed her eyes, thinking that the affair was too passionate, ruled by the senses, nothing more, and yes, so totally wrong. But he moved away, and she knew. Knew that he had left her only to shed his clothing so that he could return, and flesh could burn against flesh.</p><p>But...</p><p>Silence. Nothing.</p><p>The moonlight pouring into the room, but no touch of his warmth, no vibrance and heat as he crawled atop her for he did not do so.</p><p>A dog howled, a cry to heaven, to the night, mournful, pathetic, prophetic.</p><p>Perhaps a storm was coming, and there would be thunder outside, like the rage of desire that was all that had ever really been between them. But a storm could mean a tempest, and that would be fine, for she still felt the adrenaline racing in her veins, but what she had seen before could not be, for he had loved her, loved her more than she had loved him, wanted her first without thought of consequences.</p><p>The wind blew...</p><p>But his silence continued.</p><p>A howl sounded again, eerie in the night. A rage of wind? The baying of the hound. She didn\u2019t know. She merely felt her heated flesh began to chill.</p><p>She came up on her elbows, searching for him.</p><p>He stood still at the secretary. He had not moved, not cast off his clothing in fevered abandon.</p><p>He was reading, reading what she had written. He stood dead still, his eyes riveted on the paper, and the words that she had written.</p><p>Then he turned to her, slowly. She saw the tension build in his hand, and rock through his arms and chest. She felt his gaze fall upon her with fury, greater than that she had ever seen before, even when he had first come that night.</p><p>Fear, like icicles, ripped into her.</p><p>Terror curled around her heart.</p><p>His eyes, oh, God, his eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou wasted no time,\u201d he said aloud.</p><p>She had to escape. But perhaps, her only chance lay in playing a game. Pretending that she didn\u2019t see the death in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI was angry. You meant to leave me.\u201d</p><p>He walked slowly to the side of the bed. \u201cA woman scorned,\u201d he said lightly.</p><p>She would never know what the outcome might have been if she hadn\u2019t sat down to write that evening. Perhaps, no different. She had seen her own destruction in his eyes when he had first come;</p><p>this look was only a compound of that, and when they had struggled in the hallway, it had been a reprieve and nothing more. She had seen him when he had first arrived, seen the way he had looked up at her from the first-floor landing, far below, staring up the stairway, to see her at the railing.</p><p>\u201cA woman scorned,\u201d he repeated. \u201cIs deadly. Deadly, deadly...dead.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t scream. She didn\u2019t bother. She cursed him as he came toward her then. Cursed him, and the house, for all eternity. Her hatred was deep. She was about to be silenced. No one would ever know the truth about him, what had really happened. The truth would die with her, and in time, she would be...</p><p>Nothing more than legend.</p><p>If that much.</p><p>She started to spring to her feet once again.</p><p>She didn\u2019t make it. He fell upon her.</p><p>His hands...those hands which had brushed against her with the greatest tenderness and ardor...now closed around her neck.</p><p>Tightened, and tightened.</p><p>She strangled out curses. Swearing. With the darkening of the light that was her life, she still swore that he would pay, that come hell and damnation, somehow, sometime, through all the powers of existence, dark and light, she would come back, she would find her revenge.</p><p>Choking, gasping, lips turned blue, breath fading, blackness before her eyes...</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll pay,\u201d she swore.</p><p>\u201cBut no one knows that you\u2019re here,\u201d he told her.</p><p>The vise constricted, thumb pressing into her throat. Black pinpoints joined together. Her lungs were bursting. She longed desperately to keep fighting.</p><p>But light was fading...fading.</p><p>And then....</p><p>She was history.</p><p>Darcy woke, drenched with sweat, gasping for air. She sat up. A late-night show was still playing on the television. A coolness hummed throughout the room, soothing to her flesh, for she had been so hot, tossing and turning, twisting the bedclothes into piles of knots.</p><p>She had come to the end. She had seen the spirit die in the flesh. And yet...</p><p>She\u2019d seen nothing clearly. No detail of face or form. She had felt the hands around her neck, but she hadn\u2019t seen the face.</p><p>She smoothed back her hair, and stopped.</p><p>She was there again.</p><p>The woman in white. Standing at the foot of Darcy\u2019s bed.</p><p>Then, she turned and started for the door. Darcy slipped from the bed. The woman turned back in her unearthly haze of white and beckoned.</p><p>She opened the door to the hallway and beckoned again. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And Darcy followed.</p><p>Chapter 14</p><p>14</p> <p>M att lay awake, the picture of Darcy, contorted and gasping, replaying in his mind, over and over again.</p><p>She needed to be out of this house.</p><p>So why didn\u2019t he just make her leave?</p><p>He couldn\u2019t deal with it, he knew he couldn\u2019t deal with it, so why let her stay? Figure it out. Because he couldn\u2019t bear to see her go. So, what? Was he waiting to see if she\u2019d wake up one morning and admit the whole thing was an act, their way of bringing the culprit to justice who was rigging the house to make it appear haunted?</p><p>It wasn\u2019t going to happen. And though it might be in her own mind, what she thought she saw and felt was real to her.</p> <p>He was afraid for her, and he didn\u2019t know why. He didn\u2019t like being away from the house when she was in it. He didn\u2019t believe that ghosts could hurt people. But the living could. Why should he be afraid for her then when those she was chasing were ghosts?</p><p>He tossed, and turned, and then...</p><p>He thought he heard her door open.</p><p>He lay still, listening for a minute. Nothing. Nothing he could hear.</p><p>He rose anyway.</p><p>The wraith moved out of the door, and along the landing, heading for the stairs. Darcy followed. The ghost misted down the stairway in a white haze. Darcy paused at the landing.</p> <p>The spirit stopped, looking back. Beckoning.</p><p>Once again, Darcy followed.</p><p>She scampered down the stairway, and became suddenly aware that she wasn\u2019t just in pursuit of a spirit. She resembled the spirit. She was in a long white cotton nightgown, chasing a specter. They were both puffs of white, the ghost floating, she actually setting her feet upon the steps. Bare feet. She hadn\u2019t bothered with slippers.</p><p>It hadn\u2019t occurred to her that the ghost would lead her beyond the house.</p><p>But that was what the specter intended.</p><p>She drifted through the foyer, straight to the front door, and then through it.</p><p>From somewhere within the house, Darcy heard a door close. She hesitated, then hurriedly began playing with the alarm and the complicated locks on the front door, opened it, and rushed out.</p><p>The spirit moved across the lawn and started drifting toward the stables and the outbuildings beyond.</p> <p>Darcy followed. There was a moon out, and floodlights illuminated the entry to Melody House. But once she passed the stables, the lights dimmed. The ghost was headed toward the old smokehouse.</p><p>Suddenly, the apparition went dead still. Darcy, too, paused.</p><p>The spirit began to fade, slipping behind the building. Darcy ran after it.</p><p>She came around the side of the smokehouse and discovered that the wraith had indeed disappeared. As she stood there, puzzled and frustrated, she heard the snap of a twig. Something warned her not to make her presence known.</p><p>She flattened herself against the smokehouse, listening, waiting.</p><p>Footsteps fell...slowly, furtively. She held very still.</p><p>Closer...</p><p>She let her fingers crawl down the wood of the smokehouse door, seeking the handle. She gripped it, and tugged, but it refused to give.</p><p>The moonlight was casting curious shadows. Shapes that formed and reformed, billowed and withered, like the rise and fall of branches from the neighboring trees. But then one shadow became distinct.</p><p>It was that of a man.</p><p>She heard a strange, soft, snapping sound.</p><p>The man was carrying something. A cord...a strap...of some kind. An end was held in each hand and he tightened it, eased it, tightened it, eased it.</p><p>She\u2019d seen the motion before. In a dream. When a killer had been contemplating murder.</p><p>He stood very still in the moonlight. Darcy ceased to breathe, watching, waiting.</p><p>Then the shadow moved.</p><p>And Darcy did, too.</p><p>She shoved away from the smokehouse, coming around the other side of it. She ran as if all the demons of hell were after her, heading back toward the house. At first, she heard thundering footsteps as well, footsteps that fell in hot pursuit.</p><p>The porch, blackened by shadow despite the floodlights, was directly before her. She raced up the steps, wincing when her bare foot fell upon a small pebble. She started to hurtle herself toward the door, then tried to halt her impetus, a scream rising in her voice as a massive shadow moved between her and the entry.</p><p>She crashed hard into the rising shadow, gasping out rather than screaming, but in a frenzy and ready to rip away and scream.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t do so.</p><p>Arms wrapped around her, fingers bit into her shoulders.</p><p>\u201cDarcy!\u201d</p><p>She froze. Matt.</p><p>\u201cDarcy!\u201d</p><p>Matt. Had he been behind her? Had he been the shadow she had seen? Impossible, he\u2019d still be behind her. Unless he had doubled around, leapt the railing, and sped around the porch. She was fast. That didn\u2019t mean that he might not be faster.</p><p>She had heard footsteps, and then...</p><p>Nothing.</p><p>\u201cDarcy!\u201d He gave her a little shake.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he echoed. \u201cWhat the hell are you doing out here?\u201d</p><p>Chasing your ghost! She thought.</p><p>\u201cSorry, I was just out on a moonlight stroll,\u201d she said aloud.</p><p>She was close to him, and yet startled when his palm fell against her heart, a touch far too intimate, and though platonic, an aching reminder of other nights.</p><p>\u201cYour heart is beating a thousand miles an hour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought I\u2019d jog.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn your bare feet and nightgown?\u201d</p><p>He was looking sterner than a turn-of-the-century schoolmaster.</p><p>\u201cMatt, what are you doing out here?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cTrying to find out what you\u2019re doing. And don\u2019t tell me about moonlight strolls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? I\u2019m sure you\u2019d believe that far easier than the truth,\u201d she challenged dryly.</p><p>\u201cThe ghost invited you out?\u201d he quizzed skeptically.</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd where did she go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe disappeared behind the smokehouse,\u201d Darcy said. \u201cLook, what good is any of this? You think I\u2019m practically psycho, and it doesn\u2019t matter what I say. So\u2014will you excuse me?\u201d He was still blocking her way. \u201cMay I go back in?\u201d</p><p>He hesitated. She was afraid for a minute that he\u2019d tell her no, that he\u2019d get her things, and drive her into town.</p><p>Then, she felt an unwilling tinge of fear. Maybe he had followed her. And maybe he had leapt the railing and raced around to accost her on the porch. Maybe whatever it was going on in Melody House somehow related back to him.</p><p>No.</p><p>\u201cMatt, please, let me by you,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>He didn\u2019t budge. \u201cI don\u2019t want you running around here at night like this,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cMay we go back in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you hear me? I don\u2019t want you around here in the dark like this. Barefoot. Half-naked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not half-naked!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the moonlight, Miss Tremayne, you might as well be entirely naked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry. I\u2019ll try not to excite the bugs and bats too much,\u201d she said. \u201cMay I please go in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnce you\u2019ve listened to me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, I understand. You don\u2019t want me running around the place at night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care if the ghost sits down at your bedside and asks you out for a barbecue, do you understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour words are incredibly clear,\u201d she assured him.</p><p>He stepped aside, and opened the door. She slipped on in, hoping she could tear back up the stairs and elude his questions and orders for the rest of the night at least.</p><p>But the stairway lights were on and Penny was standing at the landing. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d she demanded, wide-eyed.</p><p>\u201cDarcy felt like a stroll.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe woman in white!\u201d Penny said. She gripped Darcy\u2019s shoulders. \u201cI told you before\u2014I\u2019ve seen her, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou might want to notice that Darcy is wearing a white nightgown,\u201d Matt pointed out.</p><p>\u201cNot tonight!\u201d Penny said. \u201cI\u2019m not saying that I saw her tonight. Matt, I\u2019ve told you this before. I\u2019ve seen her. She runs down the stairway. As if...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs if she wants someone to follow her,\u201d Darcy finished.</p><p>\u201cMoonlight plays tricks on the eyes, Penny,\u201d Matt said, shaking his head. His voice had a grate in it. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think you all are crazy. I think you want this to happen so much that you do see and feel things.\u201d He swore softly beneath his breath. \u201cLook, it\u2019s over now, right? Over for the night. Isn\u2019t it, Darcy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it\u2019s over,\u201d she agreed.</p><p>Penny nodded, turned, and started up the stairway. \u201cGood night then. But you\u2019re going to eat your words, Matt Stone. Trust me. You\u2019re going to eat your words.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood night, Penny,\u201d Matt called to her.</p><p>Darcy headed for the stairway. She was startled, and oddly frightened when Matt\u2019s hand fell on her shoulder. He pulled it away as she turned back to him.</p><p>\u201cDarcy, I\u2019m seriously afraid for you. I saw your face, at the seance and this afternoon. What happens if you see this thing all the way through? What happens when the murderer goes all the way, and the ghost is strangled to death in your vision?\u201d</p><p>He had the ability to speak with a tone that gave nothing away, and to look at her with eyes as shielded as if clouds formed to cover all emotion. She didn\u2019t know if he was mocking her, or seriously concerned.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen the dream to the end,\u201d she said. \u201cTonight, before the ghost led me down the stairs and then outside.\u201d</p><p>It seemed that he drew away from her. Not physically. And yet...there was a new distance between them.</p><p>\u201cSo then, she\u2019s told you her story. Shouldn\u2019t this be like the discovery of the skull? Doesn\u2019t it mean that she\u2019ll be at peace?\u201d He asked, and she thought that he wanted it to be over, he wanted Harrison Investigations out of his house.</p><p>He wanted her out of his house.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something more, Matt. There\u2019s something more she wants us to know.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAnd is she this Arabella you read about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen...?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. But I almost know. I will know.\u201d She turned again with precision and started up the stairs. He stayed at the landing, watching her for a minute. She had almost reached the door to the Lee Room when she realized that he had come behind her.</p><p>Once again, she felt his hands on her shoulders. She felt force in them, and anger. But once he had turned her into his arms, she saw his eyes again, and she was startled to realize that his anger was directed more at himself than at her.</p><p>\u201cDarcy, you can be the most incredibly stubborn fool. You\u2019re playing with fire. You\u2019re going to wind up hurt!\u201d</p><p>She opened her mouth to speak, but never did so. His fingers left her shoulders, fell upon her cheek, and the tension left his touch. He pulled her against him with a volatile emotion that sent shards of shimmering crystal desire racing through her in a matter of seconds. She wished she had the strength to know that it was all a loss, to push him away, but she didn\u2019t offer so much as token resistance, but slipped her arms around his shoulders, opened her lips to his, and pressed her body close, savoring the hard feel of muscle, heat, and life, and the extent of his arousal. They clung together there, in front of the door to the Lee Room, entwined in a building passion, kisses wet, searing, openmouthed and desperate, until Matt at last pushed at the door. He walked into the room, his fingers then braided with hers, until he reached the recording equipment and yanked the plugs from the walls.</p><p>Then he turned to her, wrapping his arms around her and tilting her chin upward. \u201cIf anything happened to you...\u201d he breathed.</p> <p>\u201cNothing will happen to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you be so damned certain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMatt!\u201d she stared up at him, drawing her fingers through his hair. \u201cI know what I\u2019m doing, honestly. And you mock me, you don\u2019t believe any of it, so why...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a feeling,\u201d he said, and mockery sounded in his voice, bitterness against himself, \u201cI have a feeling. One of your fucking intuitions, if you want. I have a feeling, and the feeling is fear. Darcy, you should just let this go!\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t have a chance to answer, because once again, it seemed, the desperate need to meld together swept over him, and his mouth crushed down on hers, almost violently, but it didn\u2019t matter. His hands were on her shoulders, still a little rough, the white gown that might have belonged to the spirit fell from her body to the floor, and she felt the fire and ice of his heat and the room\u2019s coolness, and she found her own hands on his chest, found that she was pressing him back until they both fell on the bed and she was in a fever to touch and kiss every inch of his length, sinking into the heat, into the fire, into the need which had become stronger than any sensation which had ever touched her before, in either the physical or metaphysical sense. Insanity might have even created the depths of the hunger just to touch, the knowledge that there was so much hostility between them, in all that their thoughts ranged in such disparate patterns. His flesh was vibrant with life, a heartbeat pulsing against her lips wherever they fell. His fingers ravaged her hair as she moved against him, and his whispers were hoarse and taut and curt, sound, shadow, light, anger, need, determination, all creating the most vital sense of arousal. She dragged the length of her body against him, fingers, lips, tongue, a starting point, an ending point, and a need, somehow, to make him realize that she was a part of him, within him, burned against him, never to be forgotten. He swept her beneath him with a surge of power that caught her breath, thrust into her with raw and vivid drive and emotion, and seemed to take her flying into a world of heat, of dampness, where everything physical, the scent of him, the feel of his arms, brush of his palm, ragged, searing, movement, cotton of the sheets, seemed extravagantly wild and real, and still, somewhere else, she was soaring, and the ecstasy for which they arched and pounded was far beyond earthly pleasure. The world exploded and rocked, and she felt the depth of him like fire and steel inside her, and a slow withering that remained, for they were loathe to part from one another. And yet, all in the same moment, she found herself thinking of the dream, of the near-desperate passion that had ranged between the two....</p><p>And then, how the man had killed the woman.</p> <p>Chilled, she almost threw him off her.</p><p>She closed her eyes, fighting the sudden wave of recall. This was Matt. She had lived a past life, seen murder, and the memories lingered, and still...</p><p>All that anger. All that passion. All that hatred.</p><p>\u201cDarcy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMatt.\u201d She lowered her head against him, chin against his cheek, not wanting him to see her eyes.</p><p>\u201cIs something wrong?\u201d</p><p>His knuckles brushed down the side of her face. Featherlight. Erotic, sweet, tender. Her breath caught again. The lightest movement caused a quickening in her.</p><p>\u201cEverything is right,\u201d she murmured.</p> <p>His arms tightened around her. She was startled when he said, \u201cI\u2019m afraid now, when I leave you alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMatt, I can take care of myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why am I so afraid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t trust in me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I do. More than I imagine. And maybe that\u2019s why I\u2019m so afraid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is a ghost, Matt.\u201d She was quiet for a minute. The thought of the violence done in this room, in this bed, still haunted her. She fought the memories. This was Matt.</p><p>\u201cYou scare me, Darcy.\u201d</p><p>Tonight, for a moment, you terrified me, Darcy thought.</p><p>\u201cSome things never can be,\u201d she said flatly. \u201cBut I\u2019m glad I\u2019ve known you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDarcy\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, let\u2019s not talk. Not tonight. Just hold me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust me. I\u2019ll be here. Holding you. Until I\u2019ve gotten you out of this house,\u201d he said, his tone harsh, hoarse, and determined.</p><p>But his touch belied his tone.</p><p>A touch, a whisper, a breeze.</p><p>As seductive as a dream.</p><p>And yet, later, as she moved against him, she found herself asking, \u201cMatt...did you follow me out as far as the smokehouse?\u201d</p><p>She thought that it took him a while to answer.</p><p>\u201cNo. When I reached the porch, you came flying into me. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just wondered,\u201d she lied.</p><p>He didn\u2019t say anything more.</p><p>She lay awake, absurdly afraid to sleep, afraid that the dream would return, and that it would be relived....</p><p>All that passion. All that hatred.</p><p>She would be the woman.</p><p>And he would be the killer.</p><p>Somewhere in the wee hours, she slept, and she did not dream. When she woke, Matt was gone. The hour was still early.</p><p>Darcy rose, showered, dressed quickly, and hurried down the stairs. She was in time. Matt was at the breakfast table along with Penny, Clint, Carter, and Adam. Clara Issy saw her, smiled, and poured her a cup of coffee.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still sleeping in that awful room?\u201d Clara said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s actually a beautiful room,\u201d Darcy said.</p><p>Clara sniffed. \u201cAnything eventful happening in it?\u201d</p><p>Darcy looked at her for a moment, praying that Matt wouldn\u2019t say anything, and that her cheeks wouldn\u2019t flood to a brilliant red.</p><p>\u201cThere is a ghost there,\u201d she said, \u201cand we\u2019ll understand her problem soon enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell her to quit hitting people!\u201d Clara said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll try,\u201d Darcy assured her.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re burying the skull in the churchyard today,\u201d Penny said. \u201cPoor Amy! At one this afternoon, she\u2019ll be all together again. Well, in a way. One ghost down. But then, this place is riddled with ghosts, really, right, Adam?\u201d</p><p>Adam set his coffee cup down. \u201cBenign ghosts. Some aren\u2019t miserable, you see. They linger because a place meant something to them. And only those with truly acute senses ever know that they\u2019re about. So...actually,\u201d he said, and paused, winking at Penny, \u201csome should be more than welcome to remain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think they ever party together?\u201d Carter mused.</p><p>\u201cThe ghosts?\u201d Clint said.</p><p>\u201cWell, I was wondering, if they all haunt the place, do they become friends? And do they talk to one another? Like, \u2018Hey, Beau, you there, Civil War guy? You spook out the parlor today and I\u2019ll take the upstairs rooms?\u2019 Whoops, sorry, Adam,\u201d Carter apologized. \u201cI know how serious this is to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe they do correspond. I don\u2019t really know,\u201d Adam said, hiding a smile.</p><p>\u201cHey, I wonder if any of them can beat Darcy at pool,\u201d Clint said, smiling at Darcy. \u201cBoy, kid,\u201d he told her. \u201cCan you play pool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d She was grateful. It seemed that he was trying to take the attention away from a subject that always turned uncomfortable when Matt was in the room.</p><p>\u201cI have to admit, I was amazed,\u201d Carter told her. \u201cWho knew? She\u2019s gorgeous, she sees the future and she\u2019s a pool shark!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like the game,\u201d Darcy said, sliding into her seat.</p><p>\u201cYou should play Matt. He\u2019s the best,\u201d Penny said.</p><p>Matt set his napkin on the table. \u201cWe\u2019ll have a tournament one day,\u201d he said, rising. \u201cI\u2019ve got to run into the office. I\u2019ll see you all at the church. And Penny, please tell me you didn\u2019t call every newspaper in the state.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Matt, I didn\u2019t,\u201d Penny said.</p><p>\u201cSee you there,\u201d Matt said, waved a hand, and left them.</p><p>\u201cI only called a few of the newspapers,\u201d Penny said softly when he was gone.</p><p>\u201cPenny, Penny, Penny!\u201d Carter chastised.</p><p>\u201cThey weren\u2019t that interested, I\u2019m afraid,\u201d Penny said. \u201cExcept for the obnoxious guy that Matt already hates. And Jason Johnstone, of course, will do a piece. But the town will be gearing up. The reenactment of Stone Gorge is this Saturday. Carter, are you taking part in that?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDefinitely,\u201d Carter said.</p><p>\u201cA battle reenactment?\u201d Adam said with interest.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not so sure it was a battle. It was a major fight, not like Spotsylvania or the Wilderness. But there was cavalry involved, and a few companies, North and South, fought a desperate battle for a little hillock on the water, just off the main road. This year, the anniversary falls on Saturday, and the land is available\u2014privately owned, but rented out to a living history company\u2014and so people are very excited about it. The Wayside Inn is completely booked for the weekend, as is everything near here. It\u2019s great fun.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd educational for the kids,\u201d Penny approved.</p><p>Carter grinned at Penny. \u201cWow. She likes me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSilly boy,\u201d Penny said.</p><p>\u201cThat does sound interesting,\u201d Darcy said. \u201cWhere do we go to watch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe main road, just the other side of the forest. Clint and I will take you around. Clint has agreed to be a private in my company this year. We\u2019re short a few fellows.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, they\u2019re all dying off,\u201d Clint said.</p><p>\u201cSo, we had a few old geezers. Armchair history buffs who have gone on to that great battle in the sky. It\u2019s still living history, and pretty cool,\u201d Carter said.</p><p>\u201cYes, and I agreed to join your company,\u201d Clint said. He stood. \u201cOne o\u2019clock for the skull burial, huh? Adam, mind if we take your car? We can all go together that way. That Navigator is great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Adam said.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you off to?\u201d Penny asked him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a busy man, Penny\u2014I\u2019ve just had you fooled all these years,\u201d Clint told her.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve got work to do, too,\u201d Carter said. \u201cWe\u2019ll meet in the foyer, say twelve-thirty?\u201d</p><p>They all nodded agreement. Both Carter and Clint started to leave. Penny cleared her throat, causing them to pause.</p><p>\u201cDishes. Kitchen,\u201d Penny said.</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am!\u201d Clint said quickly, saluting her with precision, as if he were practicing for the battle to come.</p><p>Darcy leapt to her feet, anxious to get Adam to herself. She picked up her own plate, and a number of the serving platters, telling Adam, \u201cMeet me in the Lee Room.\u201d</p><p>Within fifteen minutes, they had extricated themselves from Penny and the kitchen and were sitting together in the Lee Room.</p><p>\u201cI saw it all the way through, Adam, last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. So...?\u201d He moved around the room, hunkering down, picking up the plug to the video, which was not in the outlet. \u201cYou decided not to tape?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe plugs came out after the dream. We might have something on the video.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me about it first,\u201d Adam advised, taking the chair in front of the secretary.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been in it from both sides,\u201d she said, \u201cthat of the victim, and that of the killer. I\u2019ve felt their emotions, but I haven\u2019t seen their faces. Not clearly. But in life, they were very hot and heavy lovers. Then something went wrong. I think that the man did care about the woman, or, at the least, he was absolutely sexually fascinated with her. When he arrived at the house, he was contemplating murder. He arrived, she saw him, they struggled...and he almost stopped. But she had been angry when she\u2019d been in the house alone. Angry, and writing something at the secretary. The murder may have been averted by lust, but then he saw what she had written. And then killed her. Here, on the bed. He had brought a strap of leather with him, but he wound up doing the deed by hand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, we still don\u2019t know who, but we do know what,\u201d Adam said.</p><p>Darcy hesitated. \u201cThe ghost beckoned to me after that. She led me out of the room, down the stairs, and outside. I got as far as the smokehouse. Then she disappeared.\u201d</p><p>Adam was silent for a minute. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to get Matt\u2019s permission to do some digging. And,\u201d he added, wagging a finger at her, \u201cwe\u2019re going to have to set a few parameters for you, Darcy. You\u2019re telling me that you followed the ghost down the stairs\u2014and outside?\u201d</p><p>She hesitated, then nodded.</p><p>\u201cBut you didn\u2019t think to get me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAdam, I would have lost her.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m right down the hall. I should have heard you leaving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was all right.\u201d She hesitated. \u201cMatt came out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAdam, there was something more. At the smokehouse, when the ghost disappeared, she didn\u2019t slip into a wall or anything. She just...faded. And I felt her sense of fear. Then...I saw a shadow. The shadow of a man, as if he were following, too, but lost her at the smokehouse as well. Either that, or...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr?\u201d Adam demanded.</p><p>\u201cHe was following me,\u201d Darcy said flatly.</p><p>\u201cThis shadow was ethereal\u2014or real?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Yes, maybe, real. Because I heard footsteps. I felt...stalked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d Adam prodded.</p><p>\u201cI ran.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo the house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo the porch. That\u2019s where I ran into Matt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you certain that Matt wasn\u2019t the one who had followed you out? Maybe he came partway to the smokehouse, then turned back,\u201d Adam suggested.</p><p>\u201cHe said that he wasn\u2019t out there,\u201d Darcy told Adam.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t sound certain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am certain\u2014I think,\u201d Darcy said, causing him to smile. \u201cAdam, how well do you know Matt? You were friends with his grandfather, right?\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cYes.\u201d Then he looked a little sheepish. \u201cOnce upon a time, Darcy, I was fascinated by history to the extent that I joined a reenacting group. A Pennsylvania group, of course. I was Yankee. Captain of a company that was involved in the skirmish here, at Stoneyville. I met Matt\u2019s granddad then. We would spend long nights on the porch, talking about \u2018what ifs.\u2019 He didn\u2019t have a strong belief in the occult or ghosts, but he was willing to admit that things happened in his old place that he couldn\u2019t quite explain. But nothing bad. Never anything that could be construed as dangerous. There were lots of stories about guests seeing a Civil War soldier in the parlor. Now and then, a door would open and close. There would be a chill in the room. He didn\u2019t believe that anything ever happened in the house that couldn\u2019t be explained. As in the one woman who was certain she had seen a soldier probably did see one. It was this time of year, and lots of folks were preparing for the annual reenactment. And the cold...well, it\u2019s an old place. There are drafts. As to the doors opening and closing, it might have been the wind as well. So he enjoyed the stories, but didn\u2019t feel that the place was in any way haunted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that why you were so anxious that we get in here? The fact that you were friends with the Stones, and you\u2019re so familiar with the place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore or less,\u201d Adam said.</p><p>Darcy was slightly troubled. Adam never lied to her, and she didn\u2019t think that he was lying then. She just didn\u2019t think that he was telling her the whole story.</p><p>But she didn\u2019t press the point because he said, \u201cWhen you returned to the house, you came back to this room with Matt, I take it.\u201d</p><p>He took her by surprise, and she was certain that she instantly blushed. \u201cRight,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cAnd then...nothing else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing else,\u201d she said, and it was only a small lie. There had been that awful feeling for a moment that she was going to relive history in more than a dream. The passion...</p><p>Then the violence.</p><p>Except that Matt wasn\u2019t violent.</p><p>\u201cAdam, I need to get back into that dream. I need to see more clearly. I don\u2019t have any faces, and yet something that I do see but don\u2019t recognize is nagging at me terribly, and I think that it\u2019s the answer to the dilemma.\u201d</p><p>Adam nodded. \u201cHypnotism is the best tool. But before we go into it, I want to run through the video and sound tapes. I\u2019ll take them to my room and take a look\u2014there\u2019s probably nothing, if you were in a dream state. Why don\u2019t you take a little break? Watch television, read a book, go for a walk.\u201d</p><p>He wanted to study the tapes alone, that much was obvious. And she agreed with him. There wasn\u2019t going to be anything on the tapes.</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d Darcy went to the machines and got him the tapes. \u201cWhatever you do, don\u2019t forget that we\u2019re meeting downstairs at twelve-thirty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>When he left the room, Darcy headed back downstairs. Penny must have been in her office, and there was no sign of Clara, either.</p><p>She walked on out to the stables, just to see the horses. As her eyes adjusted to the light, she was startled to see a form, a man standing by one of the stalls.</p><p>\u201cHey, Darcy, did you want to go riding?\u201d</p><p>It was Carter. She exhaled, amazed to realize that she had been frightened.</p><p>\u201cNo...I just thought I\u2019d come and give the fellows a few pats,\u201d Darcy said. She walked over to him. The nameplate on the stall where he stood identified its occupant as Midnight Blue. Naturally, the horse was so deep an ebony in color it might have been blue.</p><p>\u201cThis your guy?\u201d Darcy asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t own any of them. But when I ride here, he\u2019s my fellow,\u201d Carter told her.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, he is, isn\u2019t he? You wouldn\u2019t believe it, but Matt found him working on a hack line up in the mountains. He was underfed, and pathetic looking. But a fine horse, and Matt knew it. Brought him here, and Sam looked after him. That was a few years ago. Look at him now! Old Midnight is a gorgeous fellow, great riding horse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m glad he\u2019s here,\u201d Darcy said. She leaned against the stall, studying Carter. \u201cThought you were busy this morning.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI was supposed to meet with the construction boss over at some property I bought. The man bailed on me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAh,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s strange to think that you have your own property. You seem so much a part of Melody House.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s easy to become a part of Melody House,\u201d Carter said. \u201cThere\u2019s something about that old sense of Southern hospitality here. And it\u2019s true, I\u2019ve been around a heck of a long time. I like Stoneyville.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Delilah Dey?\u201d Darcy teased.</p> <p>He shrugged, smiling. \u201cShe\u2019s darned cute. She\u2019s not you, of course, but I knew right off that you were a loss. Matt beat me out, again.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cCarter, I can\u2019t see where you feel you have any problems in life. From what Penny says, you\u2019ve had a major run of love affairs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut the right one hasn\u2019t come along,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s hard in life for everyone, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm.\u201d He leaned against the wood, studying her. \u201cPeople can be so deceptive, as well. Take Lavinia\u2014Matt\u2019s ex. She was stunning, sophisticated, and sweet as molasses when she first arrived. She was down with friends to do some antique hunting, met Penny in town, and Penny dragged her here for a ghost tour. Lavinia met Matt, and suddenly, she wasn\u2019t leaving. Lord, but they were gorgeous together. Then she turned into the Witch of the West, thinking Matt could drop anything at any time, and take off with her. All he had to do was be polite to another woman, and Lavinia went into a tantrum. They were something, though. Hot as fire one minute, ready to kill one another the next. Funny, though, right after the divorce, it seemed they\u2019d become friends. But now...hell, we haven\u2019t heard from her in years. Strange, she was going to come down to arrange some big financial social party here...but then she never did. And we never heard from her again.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSometimes it\u2019s best when the past is really behind us,\u201d Darcy said with a shrug.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, you\u2019re nothing like her, not really,\u201d Carter said, rubbing his beard, and studying her with an amused smile.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t worried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do have her hair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey\u2014there are lots of redheads in the world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was tall and elegant, too.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut I\u2019m not a socialite, by any stretch of the imagination,\u201d Darcy said. \u201cAnd anyway...I like Matt. I like you all. But I live a strange life. And few people can really handle it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really can see what others can\u2019t?\u201d Carter asked.</p><p>\u201cCarter, it\u2019s impossible to explain. I don\u2019t have a crystal ball. I can\u2019t really conjure any visions. Sometimes I see, and sometimes, I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He was silent, then said, \u201cDarcy, I wish that you\u2019d leave here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarter, I can\u2019t believe that you\u2019re not on my side!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am on your side. I think you\u2019re gorgeous and adorable, and you don\u2019t really freak me out at all. But...I don\u2019t know. I just don\u2019t feel that you\u2019re...safe here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s just not a good place for redheads. Matt is a great guy, but...maybe he\u2019s not good for you. And maybe Melody House does have some kind of evil in it, but since we don\u2019t see it, we\u2019re not hurt by it. And you may be.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCarter, please, I\u2019m not afraid of ghosts.\u201d</p><p>He turned to her, setting both hands on her shoulders. \u201cDarcy, you\u2019re a very brave young woman. Truly. Beautiful, assured, absolutely incredible. But Melody House...I have to say it. I really believe you should leave. Because...because you\u2019ve become too involved, for one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo involved?\u201d she echoed. He seemed so sincere, despite the fact that he had mocked the idea of ghosts so much himself.</p><p>\u201cWith Matt. Darcy, you can only get hurt,\u201d Carter warned softly.</p><p>She nodded, and placed both her hands over his where they lay on her shoulders. She gave them a squeeze, then extricated herself from his hold.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Carter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong\u2014he is a great guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust not for me, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is that Lavinia thing,\u201d Carter said. \u201cToo bad you couldn\u2019t have met her. But then, well, you know. She\u2019s disappeared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine, Carter. But thank you so much for caring.\u201d</p><p>She turned to leave.</p><p>\u201cDarcy!\u201d</p><p>She turned back.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mean this strangely, but...I love Matt. I think he\u2019s basically one of the finest men I\u2019ve ever met. I think you\u2019re pretty great, too. And maybe...maybe this place just isn\u2019t very good for you. Please, like I said...I just care about both of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Thanks, Carter.\u201d</p><p>She left then, without him calling her back. The conversation had been very strange, and unnerving.</p><p>He\u2019d talked in such a strange, roundabout way. Not that his words hadn\u2019t been evident. Matt was his friend, his very good friend.</p><p>So...</p><p>If there was something wrong about Matt, he\u2019d never come out and say so.</p><p>Just how loyal was he as a friend?</p><p>Had he been making implications that something had gone seriously wrong with Lavinia, even after the divorce?</p><p>That was too far beyond ridiculous. To suggest that Lavinia hadn\u2019t been heard from\u2014because something had happened to her!</p><p>And yet...</p><p>As she walked back to the house, she couldn\u2019t help remembering the strange sensation she had felt the night before.</p><p>Passion...</p><p>And then violence.</p><p>Chapter 15</p><p>15</p><p>T he ceremony for the skull was sadly beautiful.</p><p>The minister\u2019s name was Todd Bellamy, and he was a tall trim fellow with graying hair, and a voice that was clear, resonant, and soothing.</p><p>Despite the fact that the family had moved from the area eons ago, and the old family stones had eroded with time so that they were almost impossible to read, records had set the workers digging in the right area. Matt told them all that the original wooden coffin had decayed, and so the skull had been given its own twenty-first-century metal box, and would be lowered to join the bones at what would be approximately head level.</p><p>And so, as it was lowered into the ground, Reverend Bellamy said a prayer, and gave a small speech.</p><p>\u201cMay all the sins of the past find forgiveness, and as she sits in the warmth and glow of her maker, may Amy find the grace of forgiveness herself. Her time on this earth was brief and fragile, and stolen from her in the sadness of betrayal. In His grace, Amy must surely find peace, and in that peace, grant it to the one who so cruelly wronged her life. So it is that those who faced evil on earth will face the greatest rewards of Heaven, and there, surely, Amy has found her happiness and love. If you will all bow your heads...?\u201d</p><p>Bellamy went into a series of prayers for the dead. Darcy bowed her head, but found herself looking around the cemetery.</p><p>It was a beautiful old place that was still attached to the church. There were majestic angels guarding tombs, while many of the seventeenth- and eighteenth-century headstones offered up grim carvings of death heads and grim reapers. By night, she was certain, the place would carry an ethereal atmosphere, and most people would certainly consider it eerie.</p><p>Even now, though it was a summer\u2019s day, storm clouds were moving down from the mountains. When they had first arrived, the sun had lit the place, and it offered the historic charm that brought many to such churches and cemeteries.</p><p>Now, the darkening sky changed it to a brooding atmosphere, reminiscent of many a Hollywood horror film. Still, no one seemed to notice too much\u2014those in this area were well accustomed to the old and historic.</p><p>With her head slightly bowed, Darcy felt a small twinge, noting that to her side, farther from the church, there was a canopy. A velvet liner remained beneath it, and chairs still surrounded an open grave.</p><p>The dead were still being interred in this cemetery.</p><p>Darcy found the idea traditional and charming.</p><p>\u201cDust to dust, ashes to ashes...\u201d the reverend intoned.</p><p>Matt had planned the ceremony with determined haste, and so, the crowd was small. Naturally, the household was there. Sam, Clara, Penny, Carter, Clint, Matt, Adam, and herself. Delilah Dey had come, naturally representing the city council, Jason Johnstone had come\u2014specifically at Matt\u2019s invitation\u2014and a tall, skinny fellow\u2014an Ichabod Crane look-alike\u2014who claimed to be a writer was there as well. Mae had come, delighted to be part of the event, and even Mrs. O\u2019Hara had come from the library. There were a few people in attendance that Darcy didn\u2019t recognize, but somehow, Matt had managed to keep it all very low key.</p><p>\u201cAmen!\u201d the reverend said. \u201cGo in peace, and may the blessing of God be with you and yours.\u201d</p><p>The ceremony was officially over. The last word had barely left the reverend\u2019s lips before the Ichabod-man turned to Darcy.</p><p>\u201cMiss Tremayne?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Max Aubry from the local paper. First of all, welcome to Stoneyville. We\u2019re delighted to have you. It\u2019s my understanding you found the skull. Would you mind talking to me for a few minutes?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Darcy didn\u2019t get a chance to answer. Clint was suddenly behind her like a bulldog, hazel eyes flashing. \u201cAubry, she minds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is this, the Stone kingdom?\u201d Aubry said. \u201cClint, this is America. We\u2019ve got freedom of the press here. Let the lady answer herself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can talk to him, Clint, I\u2019ll be all right,\u201d Darcy said.</p><p>\u201cThere, see? She wants to talk,\u201d Aubry said.</p><p>Clint looked at Darcy, as if offering her a warning, but he lifted his arms, shrugged, turned and walked away.</p><p>\u201cDarcy, dear!\u201d Penny called. \u201cWe\u2019re going to head down to the Wayside Inn for some lunch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo ahead, I\u2019ll be along,\u201d Darcy called. She saw that Matt and Adam were both talking to the minister; Carter had Delilah Dey by the arm and they were reading old tombstones. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cPerhaps we could move over by the old oak, and your Dobermans won\u2019t be nipping at my heels,\u201d Aubry said.</p><p>She smiled, confident that whether or not this fellow was a sensationalist journalist, she could handle him.</p><p>\u201cCareful, the ground is rough around here,\u201d Aubry warned.</p> <p>The oak was near the open grave. Darcy found herself curious about its intended inhabitant.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Morrison,\u201d Aubry said.</p><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOld lady Morrison. She was a hundred and one on her last birthday. Died a few days ago in her sleep, surrounded by loving family. That\u2019s the way to go, I do say,\u201d Aubry said.</p><p>\u201cCertainly.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo!\u201d They stood behind the oak. \u201cYou\u2019re a psychic investigator. Did you see the skull in a vision? How did you do it? Do ghosts talk to you? People are fascinated by such phenomena, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, Mr. Aubry, I was able to find the skull because I looked up the history of the legend at the library. After that...it was a matter of deducing where the murder took place, and how far a skull might have moved through time and the elements.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you don\u2019t talk to ghosts?\u201d he said, disappointed.</p><p>She would never let this man quote her as saying that she did. \u201cWe all have incredible minds, Mr. Aubry. And we don\u2019t use all of our mental power that often. Harrison Investigations is a company that does a great deal of research. We ferret out shams, and we can say that there aren\u2019t always answers to the unexplained. They may be there somewhere, not just in our current knowledge of science and technology. So, if you want to write up what happened, I discovered the details of the story at the library.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou fell through the floor there, too,\u201d Aubry told her. \u201cYou weren\u2019t hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe sheriff saved you, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, luckily, he was around.\u201d</p><p>He was staring at her, trying to get to something. Darcy didn\u2019t feel daunted; just challenged.</p><p>\u201cThat was odd, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was odd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat the sheriff was there,\u201d Aubry said impatiently.</p><p>\u201cWhy would it be odd? He knew I was doing research there. It was natural that he might check in to see how I was doing. And luckily, the timing was good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think that a ghost, afraid of what you might discover, followed you from Melody House to attack you at the library so that you would cease your meddling?\u201d Aubry asked.</p> <p>She laughed out loud. \u201cMr. Aubry! The floorboards gave because someone spilled a cola on them! The acid ate into the wood. I hardly think that a ghost drifted over from Melody House, sneaked a soda into the library, and spilled it all over the floor.\u201d</p><p>Aubry blushed.</p><p>\u201cWeren\u2019t you scared, though?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen the floorboards gave? Of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you scared now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would I be scared now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause the ghost must think that you\u2019re meddling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Aubry, I don\u2019t remember telling you that there was a particular ghost. And there would be no reason for a ghost to be disturbed that I was meddling, as you say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is just ridiculous,\u201d Aubry argued with her. \u201cObviously, Matt Stone called you because of a ghost!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Stone allowed Harrison Investigations in because of a few reported incidents that had occurred in his home. We\u2019re investigating those incidents, doing research, just as I did when I heard about Amy\u2019s murder, which is how I found the skull, Mr. Aubry. And that\u2019s it. I\u2019ve talked to you, and I\u2019m afraid that I really don\u2019t have anything else to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think about the fact that so many of these incidents have only started cropping up in the last several years? Think the Stones are trying to invent ghosts in order to bring in the tourists?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince Matt Stone doesn\u2019t believe in ghosts, he\u2019d hardly go about inventing them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t believe in ghosts, but he\u2019d do just about anything in the world to hold on to Melody House,\u201d Aubry said. \u201cHe was married to Lavinia Harper, you know. A very wealthy woman. Since they divorced he doesn\u2019t have her money behind him anymore. She\u2019d once wanted to put all kinds of money into the house. We haven\u2019t seen hide nor hair of her for ages, though. So there you go. Money problems. You don\u2019t have to believe in ghosts to invent them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI definitely don\u2019t believe that Matt is inventing incidents at his house, Mr. Aubry. If you need to ask any more questions, my associate\u2014and the founder of my firm\u2014Mr. Adam Harrison, is here. Perhaps you should talk to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is he?\u201d Aubry asked sharply.</p><p>\u201cHe was over by the minister,\u201d Darcy said, pointing toward the church.</p><p>\u201cThanks!\u201d he told her.</p><p>Darcy leaned against the oak, feeling oddly drained, and once again, uneasy. Aubry pretty much came right out and said what he was feeling.</p><p>Matt Stone had married for money. Then he\u2019d divorced. He needed money.</p><p>His wife had disappeared.</p><p>If he\u2019d murdered his wife, he wouldn\u2019t need the money, would he? But she was his ex-wife. They\u2019d been divorced.</p><p>She gritted her teeth, furious that she was allowing people to let such suspicions seep into her mind. Especially when they didn\u2019t make sense. Matt was simply impatient and angry with the whole ghost concept. And yet, even Matt thought that something was going on.</p><p>He\u2019d loved Lavinia at one time. Been enamored of her. Their relationship had been one of passion\u2014and hate.</p><p>Just like that she had witnessed in dreams, from both sides...</p><p>\u201cRidiculous!\u201d she said aloud. Just as she did so, the threatened storm came. First, a few raindrops fell on her head. Then the wind kicked up as if the hand of God had indeed reached down to stir up a tempest. The raindrops suddenly became a deluge.</p><p>Darcy started away from the oak. The cars were around in front of the brick wall, but if she leapt over it, she\u2019d reach them far quicker than if she were to walk around. She headed toward the wall, and in doing so, needed to skirt by the open grave awaiting Mrs. Morrison, the centenarian who had passed away in her sleep.</p><p>She wrapped her arms around her chest, lowered her head, and started to run. She shot through the area where the chairs had been arranged around the grave.</p><p>She didn\u2019t hear anything behind her. Nothing at all. But the rain was pounding and the wind was whistling. Footsteps would have been washed away.</p><p>The wind was strong. Very strong.</p><p>And still, she didn\u2019t know what kind of force seized upon her with such strength as she ran by the grave. She only knew that it rocked her to the side with such vehemence that she lost her footing, teetered precariously on the uneven ground, then slammed over to her right.</p><p>Flailing...</p><p>Falling...down. Down, into darkness.</p><p>Six feet down, to be exact. Into the deep, damp earth of the freshly dug grave.</p><p>The rain was pounding hard. Matt saw Penny, her summer shawl over her head but doing little good, come running toward the passenger door.</p><p>He leaned over to open it.</p><p>Penny slid in, moving the shawl, and apologizing. \u201cOh, Matt, I\u2019ve gotten the car all wet. You would have thought we\u2019d have been prepared for this kind of summer storm! Oh, well, thank God it\u2019s summer. You can go for lunch, right? We\u2019re all supposed to be meeting at the Wayside Inn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I can lunch,\u201d he said. \u201cWhere are the others?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn Adam\u2019s car. He drove.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDarcy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s probably with Adam. Or else...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr else what?\u201d he asked sharply.</p><p>\u201cMax Aubry cornered her. And you know Darcy. She was confident she could take care of herself. I never had a chance to tell her that he was a headline-grabbing monster. Clint tried to come between the two of them, but...Matt, don\u2019t worry. Darcy doesn\u2019t like to tell anything, she hates it when people turn her kind of perception into ooh-aah parlor tricks.\u201d</p><p>Darcy was with Max Aubry. Great.</p><p>He gunned the motor with greater force than he intended.</p><p>\u201cMatt, it will be all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was a beautiful ceremony!\u201d Penny said. \u201cWasn\u2019t the Reverend Bellamy just wonderful?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMatt, come on. Sure, it will be in the newspapers. They\u2019ll say that Amy was put to her final rest with tender words. What else can they say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s see\u2014they can say that the sheriff of Stoneyville has become a complete nutcase, bringing so-called ghost busters in to solve problems in his jurisdiction because he hasn\u2019t the skill to makes discoveries beneath his own nose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMatt, Aubry would never write such a thing,\u201d Penny said.</p><p>He stared at her.</p><p>\u201cTrust me, Darcy won\u2019t give him anything to add fuel to the fire. Isn\u2019t this weather just terrible? Can you see where you\u2019re going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Penny, I can drive. Are you sure we\u2019re supposed to go straight there? Everyone is going to be soaked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s summer\u2014we\u2019ll dry,\u201d Penny assured him.</p><p>It was still pouring when they reached the Wayside Inn. Matt gave Penny his umbrella, lowered his head, and ran through the rain himself.</p><p>They were the first to arrive. Not even Mae had returned as yet, but Sim Jones, standing in for her, assured him that they had a number of tables ready, and could put their party together. \u201cHell, Matt, you all are our regulars anyway. No problemo,\u201d Sim said.</p><p>He and Penny ordered coffee and sat, awaiting the others.</p><p>Darcy\u2019s temple thundered. She had struck hard earth when first going in, and she might have blacked out. For how long, she had no idea, though with the rain flooding over her, it couldn\u2019t have been more than a few minutes.</p><p>She was quickly becoming engulfed in a mud bath. The rain and earth were already past her ankles when she made it to her feet. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHelp!\u201d she screamed as loudly as she could. A sinking feeling told her that no one would hear her\u2014even if they were still around.</p><p>She bit into her lower lip, hugging her arms around herself, and feeling the chill of the rain. The sun had gone completely. In the deep hole in the earth, it was darker than she could have possibly imagined, the sky above her offering nothing but gray.</p><p>What the hell had happened? A massive gust of wind? Or a hand with a tremendous force? And why?</p> <p>\u201cHelp!\u201d she shouted again. She dug at the earth around her, trying to get a hold on anything. But the grave had been deeply and cleanly dug. There was nothing to grasp.</p><p>She tried to claw her hands into the earth, but it merely crumbed away at her touch. She jumped, trying to reach the perimeter of the grave. She got one handhold, and slid back.</p><p>Gasping for breath, trying to move her soaking hair from her eyes, she paused for a minute. Someone was going to realize that she was missing.</p><p>Weren\u2019t they?</p><p>\u201cHelp! Help! Help!\u201d</p> <p>An unbidden sense of panic seized her, and she began to shout and try desperately to crawl from the grave again herself. The sky rumbled with a fury. There was a flash of lightning, and then the sky seemed darker than ever. Already shivering, drenched, and exhausted, she lay back against the earth of the tomb, trying to reason.</p><p>The darkness, the depth of the grave, the scent of the earth around her entered into her instinct and made her afraid.</p><p>\u201cI talk to ghosts!\u201d she whispered aloud to herself. \u201cWhy on earth would I be afraid, now, in a cemetery?\u201d</p><p>But she was afraid. The mud at her feet was getting deeper and deeper, rising now to her calves. She imagined she felt creepy, crawly things sliding up her flesh. She was cold; it might have been a summer\u2019s day, but she was thoroughly wet and the wind kept sweeping down. Her teeth were chattering, and she felt hemmed in by the darkness, as if she was locked in a coffin as well as a grave.</p><p>Cell phone.</p><p>The two words popped into her mind, and she almost smiled, thinking she\u2019d been an idiot. Except, of course, that she\u2019d hit her head, and it was spinning.</p> <p>She dropped down to the ground, trying to find the small black purse she\u2019d carried for the occasion. The ground was pure mud.</p><p>So were her hands by the time she opened the purse.</p><p>And so were the contents of her purse.</p><p>She found the phone easily enough, but it was caked with mud. She pressed on the keys, talked to the phone, tenderly tried to clean it.</p><p>No good. The water had gotten inside. The water\u2014that kept rising around her, joining with the earth, making her pit more and more of a slushy, mucky, mire.</p><p>In fury she threw the phone across the pit. It thunked sickly against the side. The rain was still falling. The day was getting darker and darker. The wind whipped around, creating an eerie noise, as if all the banshees in Ireland howled at once.</p><p>She closed her eyes, hoping for a word from someone, a sense of security, of comfort. She was desperate for an assur ance that everything would be all right, she would find her way out of the grave.</p><p>What if...</p> <p>She was supposed to have knocked herself out completely when she fell? What if she was supposed to remain there, silent, lost, while everyone assumed that she was with someone else. And what if it had been a real hand that had pushed her, forcing her into the grave?</p><p>And that real person was coming back....</p><p>\u201cHelp!\u201d She screamed the word again.</p><p>She closed her eyes. Visions of floating bones swept by her mental vision. Darkness seemed to sweep around her, touching her. The way that panic was setting in, she saw so much more. Rotting corpses, floating to the surface, finding life, swaying before her...darkness, the mud sucking her down, hands of the dead curling around her ankles, pulling her deeper and deeper into the muck.</p><p>\u201cNo! Darcy, no!\u201d she chastised herself aloud.</p><p>They would come. Someone would come for her, soon enough.</p><p>\u201cJosh?\u201d she whispered softly.</p><p>She didn\u2019t see him. But she felt as if a brush of warmth came over her. \u201cJosh...help me!\u201d</p><p>Again, a sensation of warmth, of comfort. In her mind, a whisper, You\u2019ll be all right.</p><p>\u201cStay with me, Josh. I\u2019m afraid,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>But then, a huge bolt of lightning flashed across the sky. She heard an explosion, and didn\u2019t know what it could be until she heard a cracking sound.</p><p>\u201cJosh!\u201d she cried.</p><p>But there was nothing. No whisper of assurance. No sense of warmth. She was alone, entirely alone.</p><p>A massive creaking filled the air then, and she realized what had happened.</p><p>The oak, the giant oak had been hit by the lightning.</p><p>A second later, she screamed as it came crashing down, right on the spot of the open grave that jailed her.</p><p>Adam arrived with his carful of people.</p><p>Clint, Clara and Sam.</p><p>\u201cWhere are the rest?\u201d Matt asked Clint.</p><p>\u201cCarter\u2019s driving here with Delilah\u2014they should be right behind us. Mae is parking her truck around back. Jason Johnstone was helping David Jenner with his equipment. Reverend Bellamy couldn\u2019t come\u2014he\u2019s busy making new arrangements for a funeral that was supposed to be this afternoon. Mrs. O\u2019Hara had her own car, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDarcy. Where the hell is Darcy?\u201d Matt asked.</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t come with you?\u201d Adam demanded, walking over.</p><p>Clint sniffed out a sound of distaste. \u201cThat screwball, Max Aubry, probably coaxed her into driving with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe left with him?\u201d Matt asked.</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah. Well, she walked away with him, at least,\u201d Clint said.</p><p>Matt nodded, rose, and walked over to one of the pool tables. He set up the balls with precision. Aimed to break them, and sent the cue flashing so hard that they distributed across the entire table.</p><p>\u201cMatt? Want me to order for you?\u201d Penny asked tentatively, watching the game he was determined to play by himself.</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMatt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust get me a burger, Penny. Thanks,\u201d he added after a second.</p><p>Clint walked over to the table. \u201cMatt, I can call Aubry\u2019s paper, get his cell phone number.\u201d</p><p>Matt stopped playing and leaned on his cue stick. \u201cFor what? So I can demand that he bring Darcy back to us?\u201d</p><p>Clint grimaced. \u201cI should have stuck with them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right. The guy\u2019s a jerk, and there\u2019s no way out of it. And hell, Darcy is over twenty-one, and in her right mind. At least, mostly,\u201d he added wryly.</p><p>Clint stared at him for a minute, trying to think of something to say. Then he lifted his hands, and walked away.</p><p>Matt sank the balls, one by one, with the first shot. By the time he finished, he had somewhat cooled down. He remained angry, though. And he wasn\u2019t sure if he was most furious with himself for not being more vigilant, with Max Aubry for being an opportunist, or Darcy for being...</p><p>Darcy.</p><p>He set the cue stick down and returned to the table. Penny was at his one side, and old Anthony Larkin had joined them. Good. Anthony wasn\u2019t talking about the ceremony for the skull. He was excited by the prospect of the battle reenactment.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be riding old Geyser, and though we may both be long in the tooth, I promise, we\u2019ll give the young \u2018uns dragged down to the battlefield a damned good show,\u201d he advised. \u201cYou riding for your homeland, Matt?\u201d Anthony asked.</p><p>\u201cYou bet. I\u2019ll be in my best sheriff\u2019s uniform, making sure the crowds stay under control, and that none of you blows yourself up!\u201d Matt told him lightly. Looking around the room, he saw that everyone he had seen at the cemetery had arrived.</p><p>Carter and Delilah were there. Mrs. O\u2019Hara had made it, and was deep in discussion with Adam Harrison. They were both such history buffs. They seemed like a team made in heaven.</p><p>\u201cHey, Matt!\u201d Carter called. \u201cWhere\u2019s Darcy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t really know,\u201d he replied.</p><p>\u201cIs she still with that wretched Mr. Aubry?\u201d Delilah asked from across the room.</p><p>\u201cDarcy hardly turned traitor, the way you\u2019re all making it sound,\u201d Adam said. He stared across the Matt, perplexed. \u201cWait a minute\u2014I don\u2019t think she\u2019s with him at all. He accosted me, right before I headed for the car. And actually, I had assumed she was with you, Matt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bet she just wanted to tell Reverend Bellamy what a lovely job he did,\u201d Penny said.</p><p>Darcy needs you.</p><p>Matt nearly jumped a mile, jerking around quickly to see who had whispered at his ear.</p><p>There was no one there. No one. The person nearest to him was Penny, and she was a good three feet away.</p><p>\u201cWho said that?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>Penny, wide-eyed, turned around to stare at him.</p><p>\u201cI just said that Darcy probably went to talk to the Reverend Bellamy,\u201d she said. \u201cWhy, is that bad? Why do you look so angry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe that reporter went back to her,\u201d Adam said, as if he was trying to assure himself. \u201cThe rain had started, and I was anxious to get away, but he had just left Darcy, so he probably went back to her, and maybe got her into his car.\u201d</p><p>Darcy...Darcy...</p><p>Her name was like a whisper in Matt\u2019s head. An urgent whisper. He stood so quickly that his chair fell behind him. He gave no notice.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going back to find her,\u201d he said, and started out of the room.</p><p>Adam Harrison rose as if he would accompany him. Matt gave him no notice, he suddenly felt such a sense of urgency.</p><p>Alone, he ran out of the Wayside Inn and hurried for his car.</p><p>The old oak\u2019s heavy branches covered the entire opening to the grave and protruded down into it. After her initial terror at the fall, Darcy had tried to use the tree to crawl out. But every time she got a grasp of a branch, it split in her hands, sending her splashing back hard into the rising mud.</p><p>She was soaked clean through, cold, miserable, freezing, and wondering if she could survive an overnight stay in the stygian pit. The afternoon had waned, and real darkness was setting in. Something slithered by her in the water and she choked back a scream. A snake. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Virginia had rattlers, right?</p><p>Not a rattler. Rattlers rattled.</p><p>A moccasin? What deadly venomous creature might roam the dryness of a cemetery by day, and swim through the flooding of the rain by night?</p> <p>She had to get out. She was too cold, trembling throughout her limbs. She was imagining too much again. Ghostly dances before her eyes. Bones reaching out from the ground. Yes, she spoke to ghosts. But none of them were speaking to her. They were just playing tricks with her mind, adding to the terror of her situation.</p><p>The water in the hole was almost to her waist.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be able to swim out soon!\u201d she told herself out loud.</p><p>Once again, she tried to get a grasp on one of the tree limbs. Her fingers curled around what seemed like a sturdy branch. She braced a foot against the side of the hole.</p><p>Her foot slipped on the mud and the branch snapped at the same time. She plunged all the way down, her head going beneath the surface of the rising water.</p> <p>She rose, sputtering, gasping.</p><p>And then, a miracle.</p><p>\u201cDarcy!\u201d</p><p>Had she imagined it? Or had she really heard a voice?</p><p>\u201cHere, here! I\u2019m here! Help!\u201d</p><p>Nothing then, she heard nothing at all. She hadn\u2019t shouted loudly enough, not to combat the wind and the rain. Her voice had grown hoarse, almost nonexistent.</p> <p>\u201cDarcy!\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t imagining it. Matt\u2019s voice.</p><p>She jumped, throwing herself as high as she could. \u201cMatt! Here, Matt, here, please!\u201d</p><p>And then, at last, the limbs were ripped from the top of the grave, piece after piece. \u201cOh, God, yes, thank God, thank you, thank you!\u201d she heard herself gasping.</p><p>The last of the oak was pulled away, and she was standing in the mire, looking up. The sky was dark.</p><p>She saw only his form.</p><p>Huge, hands on hips, glaring down.</p><p>And for a moment she felt a twinge of panic.</p> <p>Matt. How had he known that she was here\u2014unless he had pushed her in. Maybe he hadn\u2019t come to save her at all. Maybe he was about to reach down and use his imposing size and strength to press her down, down into the muck and mire, where she couldn\u2019t breathe, where she would slowly struggle and fight until she....</p><p>He hunkered down by the side of the grave.</p><p>She\u2019d thought it before. Maybe she\u2019d been pushed, just shoved into the grave, so that someone could come back....</p><p>And finish her off.</p><p>\u201cJesu, how in the hell...?\u201d he said. \u201cTake my hand.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t give her a chance. He reached for hers.</p><p>Inadvertently, she pulled back.</p><p>\u201cAre you hurt?\u201d he asked anxiously.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me get you out of there!\u201d</p><p>She swallowed hard, let him get a good grip on her hand.</p><p>A moment later, she heard a strange suctioning sound\u2014she hadn\u2019t even realized that the water had turned the earth to such a grasping muck. And still, it gave her up. He reached down to slip an arm beneath her right shoulder, pulling her out.</p><p>They both fell to the side of the grave. The rain continued to sluice down upon them. He stared at her a moment before righting himself, and reaching to help her up.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re like a goddamn ice cube!\u201d he said. \u201cHow the hell did you manage to fall into a grave? Never mind, let\u2019s just get you back to the house.\u201d</p><p>She was shaking, trembling. Her knees weren\u2019t holding her. He picked her up and carried her to the car, setting her into the passenger\u2019s side.</p><p>He found a blanket in the back and drew it around her shoulders. \u201cHow could you have missed a hole that damned big?\u201d he asked her, turning the key in the ignition, and hitting the switch for the heater.</p><p>I didn\u2019t fall in\u2014I was pushed!</p><p>But she didn\u2019t say the words. Yes, she had been pushed. But by a who or a what, she didn\u2019t know.</p><p>Matt himself?</p><p>\u201cThe rain...I was running from the rain. I thought I could just leap over the brick wall and reach the cars faster,\u201d she stuttered out.</p><p>\u201cOh, man, Darcy, look at you. Are you hurt? No broken bones? Sprained ankle?\u201d</p><p>A crack on the temple. Maybe one that made her mind wander too fiercely.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you?\u201d he murmured. He glanced at her, his look concerned and anxious. \u201cThis place isn\u2019t good for you, is it?\u201d he murmured, more to himself than to her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m all right,\u201d she repeated. They were driving through rain, but at long last, it seemed to be slackening. \u201cMatt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you know where to find me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you find me? That oak had covered the entire grave. And actually...it did take you a while.\u201d</p><p>He scowled, cast her a glance, and looked back to the road. \u201cWe all thought you\u2019d gone off with Max Aubry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGone off with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cClint said you were determined to talk to him, that you could handle yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did handle myself, very well, thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere were so many cars, as well. I didn\u2019t realize you were really missing until Adam said that Max Aubry approached him when he was leaving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d Darcy said.</p><p>He drove fast. They reached the entry to Melody House, and he swung hard into the drive, halting the car abruptly, coming around the side for her. He opened the door in haste, then paused, staring at her suspiciously.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to tell me that a ghost reached a bony hand out of a grave and wrenched you down into it, are you?</p><p>\u201cNope. Absolutely not,\u201d she assured him.</p><p>\u201cCome on. I\u2019ll help you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can manage on my own, thanks.\u201d</p><p>She slid quickly out of the car, and up onto her feet. But the world seemed to waver before her. She gritted her teeth hard, feeling the pounding at her temple where she\u2019d struck the earth hard as she\u2019d catapulted into the open grave.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to slip in the mud!\u201d Matt said impatiently. He swept her up.</p><p>Her limbs still felt frozen. She couldn\u2019t fight. He walked up the steps to the porch, fumbled with his key, and opened the front door.</p><p>A moment later, they were on the stairway.</p><p>They passed the spot where, sometime in the past, two lovers had battled viciously, before the man had swept the woman into his arms...</p><p>And into the Lee Room.</p><p>Just as Matt now carried her.</p><p>And, just as in the past, he laid her down upon the bed, and turned away.</p><p>And once, in the past, a man had realized just what a woman knew, and what she could tell the world about him. He had turned back to her, wound his fingers around her throat, and strangled the life from her.</p><p>Matt turned back to her.</p><p>\u201cDamn you, Darcy!\u201d he said softly.</p><p>And came toward her.</p><p>Chapter 16</p><p>16</p><p>\u201cT hey\u2019re taking a really long time,\u201d Penny said, looking at her own empty plate and the untouched hamburger she had ordered for Matt.</p><p>\u201cYes, well, we can order coffee,\u201d Delilah said. \u201cI\u2019d really love some coffee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just wish we all knew where Darcy was,\u201d Penny murmured.</p><p>\u201cBut, surely, nothing could have happened to her!\u201d Delilah said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m certain that everything is all right,\u201d Carter said firmly.</p><p>\u201cWonderful,\u201d Delilah said, smiling. \u201cWe\u2019ll all order coffee, and hopefully, they\u2019ll arrive along with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s taking so long?\u201d Clint demanded.</p><p>\u201cI think that I should get back to Melody House as quickly as possible,\u201d Adam Harrison said.</p><p>They all stared at him.</p><p>Penny jumped up. \u201cAdam! Do you have a feeling, a hunch? What\u2019s wrong? Should we all be running out of here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPenny, I\u2019m so sorry, calm down,\u201d Adam said. \u201cI don\u2019t have a feeling about anything. I just assume that, if Darcy had been caught in the rain or anything, Matt would have taken her straight back to the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course!\u201d Penny said with a sigh of relief. \u201cMae, would you get the check for us, please? Or better yet, can you just bill the whole thing to Matt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNaturally,\u201d Mae said.</p><p>\u201cI really think we should order coffee!\u201d Delilah said, somewhat plaintively. \u201cWhat if Matt is bringing her here? Then we\u2019ll all be in cars going in different directions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho could drink coffee at a time like this?\u201d Penny said, glaring at Delilah.</p><p>\u201cDelilah has a point,\u201d Carter said.</p><p>Adam let out something of an exasperated sigh. \u201cI\u2019ll head back to Melody House, and the rest of you stay here. That way, we\u2019ll be covered.\u201d</p><p>They all stared at him.</p><p>\u201cGood idea, right? Miss Dey, you go right ahead and order your coffee. When I get to the house, I\u2019ll call.\u201d</p><p>He started toward the door. The bar phone began to ring. Sim picked it up. \u201cHello...yes?\u201d He held the receiver away from his mouth. \u201cHey! Mr. Harrison. You don\u2019t need to go anywhere. He\u2019s got her. Matt\u2019s got her. She fell into a grave, can you imagine that?\u201d</p><p>He was answered by silence. And in the bar, one by one, they all looked at one another.</p><p>Darcy ran the water in her shower, feeling like an idiot. She\u2019d almost cringed when he turned to her, but he hadn\u2019t even glanced at her then. \u201cCan\u2019t believe this\u2014I forgot to call and tell them that I\u2019d found you. You\u2019re really all right? Feels like I\u2019m always saying that to you, Darcy. It\u2019s why you shouldn\u2019t be here,\u201d he added somewhat harshly. \u201cGrab a shower. Then, if you want, we\u2019ll drive on over to the Wayside Inn. I\u2019m sure the others have finished their meals by now, but I don\u2019t know what we\u2019ve got around here right now, and since you\u2019re the lost lamb at the moment, the others are going to want to see you. I\u2019ll be in my room. I think I could use a shower and change, too.\u201d</p><p>So Matt was gone.</p><p>No violence, and no passion, either. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And now, out of the hole, away from the terror, she was at a complete loss. Had she been pushed, or had it been the wind?</p><p>She dumped her clothes straight into the garbage\u2014the summer silk black tank and skirt were never going to be the same again. She thought she\u2019d hate the outfit the rest of her life anyway, always associating it with an afternoon in an open grave. Before hopping beneath the shower spray, she opened the medicine chest and downed several ibuprofen tablets, anxious to avoid the headache that threatened.</p><p>A shower had never felt so good. She had the water steaming, the pressure hard, and she stayed far longer than she should have. But she emerged mudless, hair squeaky-clean, and feeling far stronger than she had when she had first emerged from the pit.</p> <p>The rain had turned the warmth of the day into a coolness that didn\u2019t quite fit with the Virginia summer and she had been chilled to the bone. She found a light knit sweater and jeans, and dressed quickly.</p><p>She paused for a moment, wondering if the ghost was being recessive, hiding, but watching. She felt as if the room were warm, not at all cold. If the ghost was there, and watching, it was with sympathy, and no other emotion.</p><p>She exited her room just as Matt left his.</p><p>\u201cReady? We don\u2019t have to rush. If anyone wants to move on, they can. Your hair is still wet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right. It will dry.\u201d</p> <p>He nodded, and lifted an arm, indicating that she should precede him down the stairs. She was irritated to realize that she was afraid to do so.</p><p>She hurried down each step, anxious to keep a distance from him. When he opened the front door, they saw that the rain had stopped completely. But evening was there, and the darkness seemed more ominous than ever.</p><p>Matt didn\u2019t seem to notice. He walked ahead of her, and opened the passenger\u2019s seat door of his car. She slid in.</p><p>He didn\u2019t speak on the drive to the Wayside Inn. But she caught him glancing at her frequently.</p><p>\u201cWhat wrong with you?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cNothing. Really. I was pretty shaken up, of course. No one likes to fall into an open grave. And, of course, I was soaked. But now...I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p> <p>He didn\u2019t reply, but she knew he was still watching her, as if not believing a word she\u2019d said. But they reached the Wayside Inn, and she jumped out of the passenger\u2019s seat before he could walk around. Darcy hurried toward the door and was startled when it was flung open.</p><p>Clint was the first one out, reaching her, picking her up, swinging her around, and looking at her anxiously.</p><p>\u201cPoor baby! We all walked off and left you in a grave!\u201d he said, dismayed.</p><p>\u201cClint, you can set me down. I\u2019m fine. Just fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDarcy!\u201d Adam was the next one out. He didn\u2019t lift her, and she offered him a warm hug before he could crush her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. Thank God Matt came to get me out. Otherwise, I\u2019d still be there, screaming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMatt! Good going. But how did you find her?\u201d Carter asked, bursting out the door behind Adam.</p><p>\u201cHardly brilliant police work,\u201d Matt said dryly. \u201cWe\u2019d left her in a churchyard. I went back to it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNaturally!\u201d Penny said, poking her head out of the door. \u201cDarcy, dear, I ordered you a hamburger along with a new one for Matt. I hope that\u2019s okay. I mean, you\u2019ve been with us long enough for me to know that a ghost buster isn\u2019t necessarily a vegetarian. Why one would assume such a thing anyway...never mind. Is a hamburger all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLovely, Penny, thank you,\u201d Darcy said.</p><p>\u201cAnd we\u2019ve nice hot coffee on the table for you already!\u201d Mae called loudly from within.</p><p>\u201cBless you!\u201d Darcy shouted back.</p><p>Clint held the door open. Carter ushered her on through. Mae caught her, hugged her, and Mrs. O\u2019Hara came up to her as well, eyes huge. \u201cPoor, poor, dear! You are accident prone, Darcy. But I hope you don\u2019t think that it\u2019s Stoneyville. We\u2019re really a wonderful little place. I\u2019d never want you to go away thinking otherwise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat!\u201d Clint teased, grabbing Darcy\u2019s hand and leading her to her place at the table. \u201cDon\u2019t be fooled. They all thought you\u2019d gone over to the enemy. Okay, so maybe I did, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe enemy?\u201d she said.</p><p>Clint made a face. \u201cMax Aubry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, I didn\u2019t go off with Max Aubry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you tell him that you were a psychic, and that you can talk to ghosts?\u201d Penny asked anxiously.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Darcy said. She was aware of Matt watching her, arms crossed over his chest. \u201cI explained to Mr. Aubry that our firm worked through solid research, and that was that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClint! This is horrible. We\u2019re worried about what poor Darcy might have said, when she just spent an hour in a grave,\u201d Penny protested.</p><p>\u201cI would have died,\u201d Delilah said. \u201cI would have flat-out died of the fear. But then, you are you, and I imagine that you just told the bones or ghosts what they could do with themselves!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Darcy said pleasantly. \u201cI was frightened. Truly frightened. It was an eerie experience\u2014even for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s hope you don\u2019t catch your death of cold!\u201d Mae piped in. \u201cDrink up that coffee, it\u2019s nice and warm. Soup! You should have some soup. And I made chicken noodle from scratch. Sim! Get a bowl of that chicken noodle for Darcy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could go for a bowl myself,\u201d Matt said. \u201cSim, would you mind?\u201d</p><p>Carter left Delilah\u2019s side long enough to grab the chair next to Darcy\u2019s. He touched her cheek. \u201cThank God!\u201d he said softly. He shook his head, amazed, looking at Matt. \u201cShe was inside the grave! And you still found her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInside, covered by the old oak. It went down, lightning,\u201d Matt said. He looked at Darcy. \u201cShe\u2019s a fighter. She was still screaming. She was easy to find.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, why didn\u2019t you call someone?\u201d Clint asked.</p><p>\u201cThe cell phone is dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter a phone, than a person!\u201d Mae said cheerfully.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Darcy laughed.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re really not hurt?\u201d Clint asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really not hurt,\u201d Darcy said.</p><p>Clint offered her an ironic half smile. \u201cHm. Well, I will say\u2014you are accident prone. But thankfully, you bounce right back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThankfully,\u201d she agreed.</p><p>Delilah sighed. \u201cYou\u2019re certainly much braver than I. And I was under the belief that I was a highly competent woman!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you are,\u201d Darcy murmured.</p><p>\u201cBut, at least, you did have to be dragged from the grave,\u201d Delilah said.</p><p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t get out myself,\u201d Darcy told her.</p><p>\u201cBut you tried hard, huh?\u201d Clint said, picking up her hand. \u201cLook at what you did to your palms.\u201d</p><p>She gently extricated her hand. \u201cNaturally, I tried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll get some aloe on those palms,\u201d Penny said firmly.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll be fine,\u201d Darcy said.</p><p>Sim brought them bowls of soup. They smelled wonderful.</p><p>\u201cOh, my, what a story!\u201d Delilah said. \u201cThank the Lord that Max Aubry isn\u2019t here now. Can you imagine his headline? \u2018Psychic thrown in a grave at ceremony for skull she discovered!\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, Delilah, let\u2019s be glad he isn\u2019t here,\u201d Matt agreed, obviously irritated.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here,\u201d Jason Johnstone said, \u201cbut don\u2019t worry, Matt. I have no intention of writing up the incident.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, why not? It is news,\u201d Mae commented. Matt glared at her. \u201cBut then again, the ceremony was so beautiful. That\u2019s what should be in the news.\u201d</p><p>Matt looked at Jason. \u201cHey, write what you see as the truth,\u201d he told him.</p><p>Delilah let out a long sigh. \u201cWell, I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m going to have to get home. Make some of the calls I should have made during the day. I\u2019m actually not my own boss, not the way Matt is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be going in, too, tonight, Delilah,\u201d he informed her.</p><p>She smiled at Carter. \u201cThanks for the escort through the graveyard. I admit, any time I was in that place on my own, even for just a few minutes, I felt creepy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDelilah!\u201d Penny chastised. \u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful cemetery and church.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Of course. And that\u2019s how I always make sure we write it up when I work with the tourist board! Darcy, I truly hope you suffer no ill effects. Bye, all!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you to your car,\u201d Carter said.</p><p>Adam yawned. \u201cSorry!\u201d he apologized. \u201cIt\u2019s not the company. But I\u2019m not a young man. Now that I know Darcy is safe with you, Matt, I\u2019m heading back for a long, hot bath. Anyone with me?\u201d</p><p>Clint nodded, rising. \u201cI guess I should be getting back, too. Since you\u2019re together, of course, and no one is left dining alone!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve work to do, too,\u201d Penny murmured.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re fine, right, Darcy?\u201d Matt said.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>The hamburgers had come. She was famished, she realized. And once she had eaten, she knew that she would feel much stronger. And far more sane.</p><p>Far less suspicious.</p><p>The others left. Even Sim went home. Mae was there to handle the bar.</p><p>As they finished the hamburgers, Darcy and Matt were alone. They didn\u2019t talk, but ate. He consumed his last bite a minute after Darcy had given up.</p><p>He set his napkin on the table, eyeing her. \u201cLet\u2019s play pool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPool?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, come on, since you\u2019re a shark. Let\u2019s see if you can beat me.\u201d</p><p>He rose, catching her hand, dragging her to her feet. \u201cI don\u2019t know if we should play right now,\u201d she protested.</p><p>\u201cWe should definitely play. You keep insisting you\u2019re fine, so let\u2019s play.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the bet?\u201d he asked, but he wasn\u2019t expecting an answer, nor did he want one. \u201cI know, we\u2019ll make it a truth or dare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you sink a ball, you ask a question. I\u2019ll tell you the truth. When I sink a ball, you answer a question. And you have to tell the truth.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous!\u201d Darcy said.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d he asked, his eyes dark. \u201cAre you incapable of telling the truth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019ve never lied to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think that you have,\u201d he said flatly. He racked the balls, but then stepped away. \u201cLadies first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI really can play, you know,\u201d she told him.</p> <p>\u201cI believe you.\u201d</p><p>She was afraid that she\u2019d be uneasy, and off. She wasn\u2019t. She shot a clean break, sinking the three.</p><p>\u201cAsk a question,\u201d he told her.</p><p>She hesitated. \u201cWho wanted the divorce, you or Lavinia?\u201d</p><p>He arched a brow, as if surprised by her choice of question. \u201cI filed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat didn\u2019t really answer the question. Who wanted the divorce?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI did. Shoot.\u201d He indicated the table.</p><p>She sank another ball.</p><p>\u201cDid you ever really love her?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged.</p><p>\u201cCome on, you called it\u2014truth or dare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was absolutely infatuated with her. Did I really love her? I don\u2019t know. We didn\u2019t give ourselves time.\u201d</p><p>Darcy sank another ball.</p><p>\u201cDid you ever hate her?\u201d she asked.</p> <p>\u201cYes. Go on, play.\u201d</p><p>This time, Darcy missed. Matt picked up his cue. It didn\u2019t seem that he even took the time to check his angle; he sank his first ball with an absolute minimum of effort.</p><p>\u201cMy turn. You swear that you aren\u2019t feigning when you take on another voice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI swear that I\u2019m not feigning,\u201d she said flatly.</p><p>\u201cMaybe without even knowing it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me, I answered the question, shoot!\u201d she said.</p><p>He sank another ball. She wasn\u2019t even sure he looked at the table.</p><p>\u201cWhy were you so strange on the porch last night?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cStrange?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were afraid of me.\u201d</p><p>She hesitated. \u201cYes, because I\u2014I thought that I\u2019d been followed out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did you lie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s another question. Shoot another ball.\u201d</p><p>He started to protest, then shrugged. Again, his ball seemed to slide into the pocket effortlessly.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you lie?\u201d he demanded again.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I supposed I thought that you\u2019d followed me. Maybe to scare me, or something. I don\u2019t really know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the truth?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cWe are playing truth or dare,\u201d she said dryly.</p><p>A flicker of something passed through his eyes. To her amazement, he missed his next shot.</p><p>She quickly took up her own cue, and made a shot.</p><p>\u201cWhere is Lavinia now?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He looked puzzled. \u201cHow the hell should I know? Maybe Paris, maybe London. If she\u2019s in D.C., I haven\u2019t heard about it. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was my question, not yours,\u201d she informed him, and made another shot. She stared at him a long moment.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d he said impatiently.</p><p>\u201cDid you kill your wife?\u201d she asked quietly.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy question!\u201d she grated.</p><p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t kill my wife.\u201d</p><p>She looked at the table quickly, took aim, and missed her shot. Matt walked past her with his cue. He made his shot, but didn\u2019t ask a question. He cleaned the table, and set down his cue.</p><p>\u201cLast question. So that\u2019s it. You think that I killed my wife. You think that the ghost is Lavinia\u2014that I strangled her in the Lee Room?\u201d</p><p>Darcy opened her mouth, and closed it. \u201cI...no, not really. I just thought that I should make sure. Matt...did you...did you push me into that grave today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou keep saying that!\u201d she told him, irritated. \u201cI asked you\u2014did you push me in that grave today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. No, a thousand times no. And why the hell didn\u2019t you tell me you were pushed into it?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>Her eyes fell. \u201cBecause I don\u2019t know that I was pushed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell does that mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt could have been the wind, it could have been a hand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDarcy, that\u2019s ridiculous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not. The rain had started. The wind was howling. I was running, not watching where I was going, and suddenly, I was toppling into the grave.\u201d</p><p>He walked around to where she stood, crossed his arms over his chest, and leaned against the table. \u201cGreat. You think that I would push you into a grave, and that I killed my ex-wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo...not really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut the suspicions rose in your mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant me to call you a cab?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think that we actually both hear each other just fine. I said, do you want me to call you a cab. Meaning, are you afraid to drive back with me.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, swallowing hard. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you afraid of me?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>Again, his eyes seemed very dark, very intense. She shook her head. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>A small smile crooked his lips. \u201cBut you think that if you weren\u2019t somewhat taken with me, you would be. You don\u2019t want to be a fool, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not afraid of you, Matt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHm,\u201d he murmured, still watching her. \u201cThe suspicions tore at the back of your mind, but they were just teasers, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore or less.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, then. Let\u2019s see if we make home.\u201d</p><p>He took her cue from her hands and set it on the table.</p><p>\u201cMae!\u201d he called out.</p><p>\u201cI know!\u201d she shouted back. \u201cBill you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, good night!\u201d</p><p>Every once in a while, the very idea that Darcy had even so much as an inkling that he might have actually killed Lavinia made Matt so mad that he was tempted to stop the car, get out of it, and slam a fist into the windshield.</p><p>Somehow, he refrained.</p><p>He had the feeling that she wanted to speak, but she didn\u2019t.</p><p>Not until they reached the house.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re here,\u201d he said.</p><p>She nodded, still not making a move for the door.</p><p>\u201cWhatever it is, say it, Darcy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you find me?\u201d she asked, and it wasn\u2019t an accusation, but a question.</p><p>A little voice whispered in my ear.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t say it. He just couldn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cDarcy, you weren\u2019t with us, and the last place we saw you was the churchyard. You have to admit yourself, it was the obvious place to look.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess...but you found the freshly dug grave\u2014even with the tree over it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou shouted out. I heard you.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, then flashed him a sudden smile. \u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cDarcy, that was no great mystery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. I agree,\u201d she told him. She was still smiling.</p><p>\u201cDarcy, don\u2019t go getting weird ideas that you don\u2019t share with me. Why on earth would you suddenly have a suspicion that I had killed Lavinia?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe left here alive and well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWasn\u2019t she supposed to do some kind of a fund-raiser or something at Melody House, even after you two divorced?\u201d Darcy asked.</p><p>He sighed, and looked at his hands. \u201cDarcy, it\u2019s really so cut-and-dried it\u2019s boring. We met, we were attracted, whirlwind, we got married. She thought that I was ready to enter her world. Here I was, the heir to a small Virginian dynasty, founding fathers, all that rot. She thought that she could turn me into what she wanted. I had mistakenly believed that she was done with party after party, and so on. We argued like cats and dogs, and then I knew I\u2019d made the biggest mistake in the world. She\u2019d thought she\u2019d get me into politics, with my heritage and the house, and being a cop and a sheriff. At this particular phase of my life, my interest is here. Keeping the place afloat, taking the town into the future. My fund-raisers are for this place, and then civic\u2014we need money to keep the kids off drugs, even here, and for awareness, and everything else that society faces. We were finally amicable, both realizing that we\u2019d made a mistake, seeing what we wanted to see in one another, and not what was really there. But I really don\u2019t hate her anymore. I feel rather ambivalent toward her. That\u2019s all. Hunt her down, if you feel the need.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to pry so much...sorry, yes. Maybe I did.\u201d</p><p>The front door to the house opened while they were still sitting there. Penny came out on the porch. \u201cMatt? Everything all right? There\u2019s a phone call for you on the main line. Jason Johnstone. Should I tell him to call back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, we\u2019re coming in,\u201d Matt called.</p><p>Darcy quickly exited her door, asking Penny where Adam was as she walked by her into the house. Matt followed more slowly, telling Penny he\u2019d pick up the line in his upstairs office.</p><p>Darcy had disappeared by the time he reached the second-floor landing. He walked into his own room, to the desk in the office area of the suite, and punched in the line on the phone.</p><p>\u201cJason, hi, Matt. Sorry to have kept you waiting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all right. I could have called back. I just wanted to let you know that I did write up what happened today. But I think you\u2019ll like it.\u201d</p><p>Matt inhaled on a deep breath. \u201cLook, Jason, I know I have a chip on my shoulder about the whole ghost thing. But I mean it\u2014you are a journalist, and a good one. Don\u2019t let me influence what you write.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>On the other end of the line, Jason laughed. \u201cMatt, honestly, I wrote what I saw.

We are at rival papers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter, Jason.

I\u2019ll see you, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Jason.\u201d</p><p>As he hung up, he thought he heard another click that preceded his own.</p><p>He frowned. Who the hell would be listening in on his conversations?</p><p>And why?</p><p>Darcy dropped by Adam\u2019s room and was dismayed to find him sneezing. Since he had been old for a parent when Josh had been born, she feared for his health now that he was twenty-five years older.</p> <p>\u201cYou caught a cold today!\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cNever mind me,\u201d he said, waving a hand in the air. \u201cWhat on earth happened to you in that cemetery today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBelieve it or not, I really don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you not know?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cBecause it was pouring, and the wind was howling as if a sudden hurricane had popped up. It was really strong, and you know it. What I said in the Wayside Inn this afternoon was the truth, the whole truth. I was running to jump a wall and get to the cars, and suddenly I was in the hole.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo the wind blew you in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYou were pushed?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI might have been, but I really don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>He sneezed again.</p><p>\u201cAdam, you\u2019re getting sick.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, but he looked worn and tired as well.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve taken some cold stuff, and I\u2019m going straight to bed,\u201d he told her. \u201cI was just waiting up for you to come in.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cI swear to you that I\u2019m just fine. But I am worried about you.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cThere was that incident in the library. And now this. I don\u2019t like any of it, Darcy. We\u2019ve had problematic ghosts before, but...there\u2019s something here that\u2019s just not right.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cAdam, did you ever meet Lavinia Harper?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnce or twice. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust curious, I suppose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, the ex-wife. Rich, stunning, always throwing parties for some cause or another, but underneath it all, not a truly generous or nice woman,\u201d Adam said.</p><p>\u201cBut a living one, right?\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cYou\u2019re suggesting she might be dead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said quickly. Too quickly. \u201cI mean...Matt is truly a decent guy. Hardheaded and heavy-handed at times, but ethical, I would swear. Still...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think your ghost might be his murdered wife?\u201d Adam sounded very skeptical.</p><p>\u201cNo. I really don\u2019t think that. But I don\u2019t want to be an idiot, either. People say she was supposed to show up here...but that no one heard from her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see what you mean. And very difficult when you\u2019re so infatuated with Matt,\u201d Adam said flatly.</p><p>She cast him a frown.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t believe in him?\u201d Adam asked, a slight smile curving his lips.</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo much, Adam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll check into Lavinia\u2019s whereabouts,\u201d Adam promised her. \u201cOh, ye of little faith!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do have faith!\u201d she protested.</p><p>\u201cCover all the bases, Darcy. I\u2019m teasing you. I\u2019ve always told you to cover all the bases, right?\u201d Adam said, smiling at her.</p><p>\u201cAdam,\u201d she began, then hesitated, and started again. \u201cI\u2019ve seen too many women fall...fall in love. And lose their minds and their senses because of it. I don\u2019t want to be an idiot because...\u201d She shook her head and threw her hands up. \u201cBecause I am so infatuated!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood girl!\u201d he said. Then he sneezed again.</p><p>\u201cGet in bed!\u201d she chastised, giving him a kiss on the cheek and then walking to the door. \u201cGood night!\u201d she called to him.</p><p>\u201cDarcy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. We\u2019ll find Lavinia,\u201d he told her. \u201cAnd Darcy, you\u2019ll get me immediately if you need me!\u201d he commanded. Then he sneezed again.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d she promised.</p><p>In her own room, she paced awhile, wondering if Matt would come that night.</p><p>Probably not. He was offended that she had suspected him of foul play in the nonappearance of his wife. She started to put on a T-shirt, then opted for her lacy white gown instead, thinking wryly that, if she did go down the stairway that night, she could convince any onlooker that she was the lady in white.</p><p>Restless, she watched the late show. But then she fell asleep. She tried very hard to clear her mind before she did so, since the day\u2019s events had prevented Adam from trying hypnotism again.</p><p>The dream came again.</p><p>Not the violence of it, or the murder.</p><p>Just the woman, a haze of white, staring down at her at first where she lay in the bed. She heard a single whisper. \u201cPlease!\u201d</p><p>Then the woman moved to the door, and slipped through it.</p><p>Awake, Darcy rose, and hurried after her.</p><p>Once again, she waited on the stairway. Halfway down, she waited again. Darcy followed. At the front door she hesitated, remembering all the warnings she had received, and the fear she had felt herself.</p><p>But she wanted so desperately to get at the truth.</p><p>There were umbrellas in an old stand near the door. She took one, then let herself out.</p><p>The ghost waited on the porch steps. Then she started moving again, drifting toward the smokehouse.</p><p>Tonight, she went in.</p><p>The old building was in sound repair, and from the scent within, was obviously still used. Darcy opened the door, and stood there, looking into the darkness.</p><p>Great. She had an umbrella. No flashlight.</p><p>And still, with only the moonbeams hurtling down for illumination, Darcy could see the ghost. Standing in the middle of the small space.</p><p>\u201cPlease!\u201d she said again.</p><p>A rustling sound came from behind Darcy. She swung around with her umbrella, ready to strike. She thought that she saw a shadow, disappearing against the stable wall.</p><p>A feeling of cold wrapped around her shoulders and she heard the whisper again, right against her ear, urgent and quick. \u201cPlease!\u201d</p><p>Suddenly, she knew. Exactly what the ghost was trying to say, and exactly what she wanted. There was an old call bell for the plantation hands on the porch. Darcy ran like a maniac to clang it, then raced back to the smokehouse again.</p><p>She ignored the darkness, burst into the center of it, and began to dig, using the point of the umbrella. She\u2019d gotten down no more than a foot, and was so involved in her task, that she screamed when she felt hands on her shoulders.</p><p>She spun around.</p><p>Matt.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you doing?\u201d His words sounded like an angry growl. She took a step back, aware of his size, and of the darkness.</p><p>But she had rung the bell loudly enough to wake the dead. Naturally, he was out here. And yet, in the small room, it seemed that he was staring at her with malignant eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d The shout came from the house. Penny was running on out. Adam, with a slip cap and robe on, was hurrying along behind her.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s here!\u201d Darcy said. \u201cShe\u2019s here, I know it!\u201d</p><p>By then, Sam Arden, Clint, and Carter had come from the stables. They were all barefoot, dressed in nothing but hastily thrown-on jeans.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell...?\u201d Clint demanded, rubbing his five o\u2019clock shadow.</p><p>Carter stared at the scene. \u201cShe thinks she\u2019s found something,\u201d he murmured to Clint. \u201cHey, should I get a shovel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, please!\u201d Darcy said.</p><p>Matt threw up his hands. \u201cHell. Sure. Get a shovel. Let\u2019s dig in the middle of the night.\u201d</p><p>Sam disappeared with Carter. They were back in a minute with two shovels, a portable floodlight, and a pick.</p><p>\u201cDarcy, move, let me at it,\u201d Carter said, entering the little room, and starting right off with the pick. He loosened the earth, and Matt joined him to start digging, swearing beneath his breath as he did so.</p><p>The others looked on. Minutes ticked by, and mounds of dirt came out of the smokehouse.</p><p>Sweating despite the coolness of the wee hour, grimy with dirt, Matt wiped his brow. He glared at her. She forced herself to stand firm, wishing that she didn\u2019t note that his physique remained exceptionally imposing, tanned biceps and chest glistening with sweat, streaked with mud.</p><p>\u201cDarcy, we\u2019re down several feet.\u201d</p><p>She let out an impatient sound and started for the smokehouse herself. He raised a hand to her. \u201cAll right, all right!\u201d</p><p>He went back to it with a vengeance.</p><p>Still, it was Carter who gave a sudden cry.</p><p>\u201cDamn!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, what?\u201d Darcy cried.</p><p>\u201cHe probably shoveled his own toe,\u201d Penny murmured.</p><p>Matt hunkered down with Carter. Clint nosed his way in. Darcy couldn\u2019t get past them.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d she cried out.</p><p>Matt rose, tossing down his shovel, glaring at her once again as he started to walk by her. \u201cDon\u2019t anyone touch anything else. I\u2019m getting a team out here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA team?\u201d she said.</p><p>He stopped walking, hands on his hips, eyes like ebony as he stared down at her. \u201cA forensics team, Darcy. Yes, we found bones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould be an animal,\u201d Penny suggested softly. \u201cIt is a smokehouse.\u201d</p><p>Matt glanced over to her. \u201cIt\u2019s human. It appears to be complete, or nearly complete.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut do you really need a team in the middle of the night?\u201d Penny said, perplexed. \u201cPoor thing has probably been there for hundreds of years.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMaybe not, Penny. We don\u2019t know that.\u201d</p><p>Darcy felt her breath catch. That was it, of course. She\u2019d assumed, they\u2019d all assumed, that the ghost had to have been there for years. She had never really thought that Matt might have killed his ex-wife, and yet...</p><p>The suspicion had been there.</p> <p>She stared at Adam. He stared back at her, and she knew that they were both hoping that they hadn\u2019t found Lavinia Harper Stone.</p><p>Matt was still staring at Darcy. She felt his eyes and looked back at him.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know anything about this skeleton\u2014yet,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we will.\u201d</p><p>With that, he walked on by.</p><p>And all eyes turned on Darcy.</p> <p>Chapter 17</p><p>17</p><p>I t was approximately one in the morning when they first dug out the bones.</p><p>It was four by the time Matt\u2019s team had carefully dug out the surrounding dirt along with the skeleton and sealed off the smokehouse for further excavation. The box containing the remains was locked into the morgue at the Mahoney Funeral Home by four-thirty, and Matt was back at the house by five and finally showered and in bed at five-thirty.</p><p>He was exhausted, and should have slept easily, but he lay awake staring up at the ceiling. How the hell had she done it?</p><p>He was tempted to go to her. Knock on her door, the hell with whoever might hear the sound. He felt a greater need than ever to be with her. He tried to tell himself that he was an idiot\u2014she had suggested that he might be capable of murder, for God\u2019s sake! And there was still that thing...tonight, once again, seeing the look in her eyes, the set of her jaw. It was creepy, and if he was failing to realize it, it was all because he was blinded by emotion, he was letting his dick, rather than his mind, rule his thinking.</p> <p>Didn\u2019t matter, he realized. He felt the same way about her, no matter what. Except...he was damned indignant. He looked at his watch. Six. He groaned, then rose, went out to his desk, and began shuffling through his papers. Somewhere, he had the cell number he wanted. Not in his phone, it was too new.</p><p>At last, in the bottom drawer, with a stash of old pictures, he found the number. He punched it in, expecting an answering machine.</p><p>She didn\u2019t answer with a simple hello. After all these years, she must have recognized the house number on her caller ID.</p><p>\u201cDarling!\u201d Lavinia cooed over the wires. \u201cDarling, do you know what time it is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSix-o-five, I believe,\u201d Matt said dryly. \u201cSorry, I thought your machine would pick up, and you\u2019d give me a call back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s quite all right, although really, you should know better than to call me at this hour, unless, of course, you have some kind of incredibly hot proposal to make?\u201d she teased.</p><p>\u201cNo. Actually, I just called to see how you were doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt six in the morning?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLike I said, I didn\u2019t expect you to answer.\u201d</p><p>He heard Lavinia\u2019s low, husky, rumbling laugh. Once, the sound of it had been sheer aphrodisiac. Now...</p><p>\u201cThings are going wickedly down there, so I hear,\u201d she told him. \u201cBelieve it or not, I was going to call to see if you were all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn article made it into the New York papers by that local walking-stick you\u2019ve got down there. All about the occult. You\u2019ll just have to see it, darling. All about the world\u2019s most beautiful ghost hunter finding a skull, then being cast into a grave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat just happened yesterday!\u201d Matt said.</p><p>\u201cDarling, it\u2019s only \u2018news\u2019 because they get it out quickly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood point, Lavinia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs she that beautiful?\u201d Lavinia inquired.</p><p>Matt wondered if there was a touch of jealousy in her voice, and even, a touch of pathos.</p><p>The past was long gone. And Lavinia was alive and well and in New York. He was suddenly feeling very generous.</p><p>\u201cLavinia, she looks a great deal like you. A tall redhead with all the elegance in the world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould I come down and meet her?\u201d Lavinia asked. Matt wasn\u2019t sure if she did so with mischief, or the best of intentions. \u201cI mean, it sounds as if you could use a little help. You know...actually, I wasn\u2019t all that fond of the Lee Room myself, but...the article this fellow wrote tells about all these weird events at the house, how a ghost has pulled hair and slapped people, and all that kind of stuff. If you need help...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s sweet, Lavinia. I think we\u2019re fine.\u201d He hesitated. \u201cMiss Tremayne led us to a skeleton last night. Once the remains are identified, I think we\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>She was silent for a minute, intuitive, then she said, \u201cOh, Matt! I am so sorry. I haven\u2019t been there in years, of course, and I had said that I was coming back. I had an offer in Paris I couldn\u2019t refuse, and there was no point in pursuing that lovely affair between the two of us....\u201d</p><p>\u201cA marriage isn\u2019t the same as an affair, Lavinia,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cBut someone there thinks the bones are me!\u201d she exclaimed.</p><p>\u201cLavinia, look at that! If you tire of the social whirl, you\u2019ll be perfect for Harrison Investigations. What intuition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tease, Matt. I\u2019m between events right now. Summer can be so droll. If you need to prove that I\u2019m alive, I\u2019ll be happy to come down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLavinia, I know you\u2019re alive and well, and I\u2019m grateful. That\u2019s all I need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, well. You do have my number.\u201d The last was filled with sexual innuendo. It didn\u2019t mean anything. Lavinia was incapable of anything else.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Lavinia. And hey, if you need me, I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, darling, on nights when I\u2019m alone, I do need you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood thing there aren\u2019t many nights like that, eh, Lavinia?\u201d he said, his tone light. \u201cSorry to have awakened you. Take care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou, too. I\u2019ll love you a little, Matt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? Thanks. Take care.\u201d</p><p>He hung up, feeling remarkably smug. Maybe he should have asked her to come down. Make sure everyone saw her.</p><p>He nearly jumped when the phone started to ring again. Thayer.</p><p>\u201cThayer, what\u2019s up? Didn\u2019t you get anyone to spell you yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMatt, you\u2019re not going to believe this.\u201d</p><p>The pleasure he\u2019d felt at hearing Lavinia\u2019s voice evaporated in a flash. \u201cTry me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe bones are gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe bones are gone. There was a break-in at Mahoney\u2019s place. And the box with the dirt and the bones has been stolen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything else missing?\u201d he asked Thayer.</p><p>\u201cThe office drawers were trashed, some petty cash was taken,\u201d Thayer said. Then he plunged in with, \u201cBut if you ask me, they broke in for the bones. Someone has chalked a few of the walls with Greek letters as if it were a fraternity prank, but...who knows? College kids have been known to do more than steal bones on a lark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got the area sealed?\u201d Matt asked, a little too harshly. But he\u2019d be damned if he\u2019d lose fingerprints or any other important evidence on this one.</p><p>\u201cMatt, you know that we\u2019re capable of protecting the integrity of a scene,\u201d Thayer said.</p><p>\u201cSorry, I do know that,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll be right there.\u201d</p><p>Darcy woke to the sound of an ear-shattering scream. She\u2019d had to shower again last night, after her bout in the smokehouse, and she was wearing a knee-length sleep T-shirt. She didn\u2019t bother with a robe or slippers, or care in the least about her appearance, not at the sound of a scream like that one.</p><p>She tore out of her room and to the railing, looking downward.</p><p>Penny was standing in the foyer, her hand to her throat.</p><p>\u201cPenny!\u201d Darcy cried, and came racing down the stairway.</p><p>She came up abruptly against Penny\u2019s back, and stared past her.</p><p>There was a soldier at the front door. He was wearing worn butternut and gray, his sash tied perfectly around his hips, his sword swinging at his side. His hat was low slung over white hair, and he wore a regal silver beard. He was ready to march to battle.</p><p>\u201cHarry Smith!\u201d Penny chastised, her finger falling from her throat.</p><p>Harry Smith. Darcy smiled, recognizing the medical technician who had come to her aid when she\u2019d crashed through the floor at the library.</p><p>\u201cYou scared me to death!\u201d Penny told him.</p><p>\u201cPenny Sawyer, why I\u2019d suddenly scare you after all these years, I can\u2019t begin to imagine!\u201d he said gruffly, shaking his head. \u201cBut I sure am sorry.\u201d A smile was tugging at his lips, and only barely hidden by his growth of beard.</p><p>Darcy started to laugh herself, and then Penny eased completely and laughed as well. It was easy to see how Penny might have thought that she had indeed come across a ghost from the past. Harry Smith was the perfect image of a long-ago soldier.</p><p>\u201cHarry, you look great!\u201d Darcy said.</p><p>He inclined his head toward her. \u201cThank you, ma\u2019am. The uniform belonged to my great-great-grandfather, who was captain of one of the units that fought here. The sword is authentic, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarry, this is all well and good, but did you forget the concept of knocking?\u201d Penny asked. \u201cIf you\u2019d knocked at the door, I might not have come so close to having a heart attack!\u201d</p><p>\u201cPenny, now, you\u2019re the one who\u2019s claimed to have seen ghosts in the past, anyway,\u201d Harry told her. \u201cI did knock. No one answered, and the door was open.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s odd\u2014we\u2019ve been careful about locking it lately,\u201d she murmured, then challenged Harry again, her eyes sparkling. \u201cAnd we had a rough night. Darcy led us to a stash of bones in the smokehouse, so you see, Harry Smith, there is a ghost!\u201d</p><p>Harry looked at Darcy. \u201cI heard,\u201d he said. \u201cGood work, young lady. Except, it seems that you ladies haven\u2019t heard the latest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Darcy asked. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThe bones have been stolen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStolen!\u201d Penny repeated. \u201cWho on earth would have stolen old bones?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d Darcy said. \u201cThey were just dug out in the very early hours of this morning.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sure. This is a small town, Miss Darcy. I\u2019m with the fire department, and we know the minute something has happened down at the sheriff\u2019s office.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo Matt is down there already?\u201d Darcy said.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s been down there for hours now,\u201d Harry Smith said. He smiled. \u201cIt isn\u2019t exactly morning anymore. It\u2019s almost one in the afternoon.\u201d</p><p>Darcy hadn\u2019t had the least idea it could be so late. But then, she hadn\u2019t gone to sleep until very late\u2014or very early.</p><p>\u201cWho would want old bones?\u201d Penny said again.</p> <p>Harry shrugged. \u201cLooks like a fraternity prank. Like a challenge, even. Thayer told Bill Jenkins that there were some Greek letters chalked on one of the walls. And some money was taken, too. Not a lot. Maybe a hundred dollars. Anyway, Matt is livid. Don\u2019t blame him. We make a discovery, hold the bones overnight in a mortuary so that they can be brought up to Washington the next day\u2014and they disappear. Bad business. Makes us small-town folk look like real hicks. Anyway, he\u2019s on it. Don\u2019t you all worry.\u201d</p><p>But Darcy was worried. She didn\u2019t think that it was any kind of fraternity prank. \u201cThat\u2019s very strange. The bones must have been stolen during a very small window of time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep,\u201d Harry said.</p><p>\u201cHow would fraternity pranksters even know they were at the funeral home?\u201d Darcy asked.</p><p>\u201cAh, the kids can listen in on the police radio,\u201d Harry said, waving a hand in the air. \u201cHad to be kids. Who else would want old bones?\u201d</p><p>The front door had remained open when Harry had come in and Clint came up behind him then. \u201cHi, Harry. Why, you old geezer! You look like a million bucks.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThank you, young sir,\u201d Harry said, and went on to explain that they were discussing the bones\u2014and the fact that they\u2019d been stolen.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s friggin\u2019 bizarre,\u201d Clint said.</p><p>\u201cClint, mind the language,\u201d Penny said.</p><p>\u201cYes\u2019m,\u201d Clint said, rolling his eyes. \u201cYou should hear her swear when she\u2019s got a bee in her bonnet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot true at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s not true?\u201d Carter had arrived as well. Entering behind Clint, he too looked Harry Smith over, and whistled. \u201cMan, you look like the real thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo do you, once you\u2019re in uniform,\u201d Harry reminded him.</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s going on? Why would Penny be swearing? What bee is in her bonnet?\u201d Clint asked, and once again, Harry Smith went through the explanation.</p> <p>\u201cProbably was frat boys,\u201d Carter said, shrugging. \u201cAnd those bones will show up somewhere again. Maybe on the field on one of the college campuses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMatt isn\u2019t taking it as a prank,\u201d Harry said. \u201cHe\u2019s going after the offenders, with a vengeance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, right now, because he\u2019s really pissed off,\u201d Clint said. \u201cBut I know Matt. If he doesn\u2019t get them right away, he\u2019ll know that it\u2019s more important to protect and serve the living, and go after the real criminals. Then the bones will show up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Carter mused. \u201cI can see how a thing like this might make him look bad to all the big boys he knows up in the D.C. area.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe must be running on empty, too,\u201d Penny said. \u201cAfter last night...well, the rest of us have all slept really late. He has to be exhausted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll be fine, you know Matt,\u201d Clint said. \u201cThat is some thing, though, isn\u2019t it? We\u2019re all feeling this incredible elation, this triumph, because Darcy found the skeleton. And here we are\u2014bones all gone in just a matter of hours. Easy come, easy go. Sadly, that\u2019s life. Hey, Harry, what are you doing all dressed up today? The reenactment isn\u2019t until tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI came to take out old Tannenbaum,\u201d Harry said. \u201cI haven\u2019t been out on him for a while. I just want to make sure that he and I are still real good friends, before we get out in front of the crowds tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. I\u2019ll go saddle him up for you,\u201d Clint said.</p><p>\u201cI lead one of the cavalry charges,\u201d Harry told Darcy. \u201cYou ever been to one of these things?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019ve been to a lot of the national parks, but I\u2019ve never really seen a reenactment,\u201d Darcy told him.</p><p>\u201cWell, want to take a ride with me, young lady? I\u2019ll show you where it\u2019s all taking place. Sorry\u2014you do ride?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love to ride. And if you\u2019ll give me a minute to get dressed, I\u2019d be happy to go with you. Unless...\u201d She hesitated and looked at Penny.</p><p>\u201cYou can go to the mortuary if you want, if you think you can help,\u201d Penny said. \u201cBut I\u2019d be staying the hell away from Matt myself this morning. Let him handle things the way the police would do it, first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell! Did you hear that? My, my, Penny Sawyer swearing!\u201d Carter teased. \u201cBut seriously, I\u2019d stay away from Matt right now, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou saddle Tannebaum for Harry, and I\u2019ll get Nellie ready for a ride,\u201d Clint said.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s really nothing else you can do at the moment,\u201d Penny told Darcy. \u201cGo with Harry. You\u2019ll enjoy it.\u201d</p><p>Darcy nodded. \u201cGive me just a minute, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, I think I\u2019ll go for the ride, too,\u201d Carter said.</p><p>\u201cHell, I\u2019ll join you, too,\u201d Clint said, grinning at Penny.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be right down,\u201d Darcy said.</p><p>\u201cNo hurry,\u201d Harry Smith said. \u201cI\u2019m off the next three days. Take your time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, dear, take your time. I have muffins in the kitchen\u2014how rude of me. Harry, come on in and have some coffee and muffins.\u201d She looked both Clint and Carter up and down. \u201cAnd when you ne\u2019er-do-wells with all that time on your hands have saddled the horses, you can have coffee and muffins, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNe\u2019er-do-wells!\u201d Carter protested. \u201cI\u2019m a hardworking entrepreneur!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I even have some work this evening,\u201d Clint said. He winked at Penny. \u201cYou wait and see. You\u2019ll be eating your words.\u201d</p><p>Penny sniffed. \u201cCoffee when the horses are saddled. Darcy, you take your time. Harry, you come with me.\u201d</p><p>Darcy ran back up the stairs, but didn\u2019t head straight for her room. She tapped lightly at Adam\u2019s door.</p><p>He told her to come in, and she found him still in bed.</p><p>\u201cI might be getting a cold,\u201d he told her sheepishly. \u201cAnyway, Penny brought me some cold pills and tea and toast awhile ago. I\u2019ll just hang out in here for a few hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAdam, the skeleton was stolen from the mortuary,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI know. Matt called.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. He\u2019s on it like a hornet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAdam, doesn\u2019t it seem really suspicious to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey all seem to think it was a fraternity prank,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2014Clint, Carter, and the rest of the town, I imagine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. They all think that you discovered a skeleton that was hundreds of years old.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was nothing there, right? No jewelry, no remnants of cloth...nothing?\u201d Darcy asked.</p><p>Adam shook his head. \u201cThe remains, from what Matt said, were purely skeletal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill...there would be teeth,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAdam, do you think it\u2019s possible that the skeleton isn\u2019t so old, and therefore someone really wanted to get it back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDarcy, I told you I\u2019d find Lavinia Harper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t particularly implying that it would be Lavinia Harper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDarcy, let\u2019s give Matt a chance to be a sheriff, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight, but...if there was a break-in...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t it be most feasible that it was done by someone who definitely knew that the bones were there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDarcy, give Matt a chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d She told him then that she was going riding, and she would check in on him later.</p><p>A few minutes, she was dressed, and she ran downstairs. Penny had a plate with corn muffins set for her, along with juice and coffee.</p><p>\u201cDid you check in on Adam, dear?\u201d Penny asked her.</p><p>\u201cYes, he\u2019s just going to sleep for a bit. Hopefully, he\u2019ll feel some better by this evening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet him get some rest today,\u201d Clint said. \u201cHe\u2019ll want to enjoy the show tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe reenactments are fun,\u201d Carter told Darcy. \u201cYou\u2019ll see today when we go riding\u2014there are already a bunch of encampments set up. Wives come along and dress in antebellum fashion and cook on the battlefield. Some women dress up as laundresses...and those who just kind of follow armies, if you know what I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProstitutes,\u201d Penny said impatiently.</p><p>Carter grinned and laughed. \u201cRight. Prostitutes. Since General Hooker gave his name to one of the current labels for such ladies, we know that they were in abundance in the Civil War. And, hey, do you know how many soldiers came down with sexual diseases?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, and we don\u2019t want to know,\u201d Penny said.</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s good. I don\u2019t really know the number. But a lot,\u201d Carter said.</p><p>\u201cShall we ride?\u201d Harry asked.</p><p>Darcy gulped down the last of her orange juice and stood. \u201cI\u2019m ready, whenever. Penny, did you want to join us?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cHeavens, no! I watched these boys play soldier far too long. Have a lovely afternoon.\u201d She waved them all away, and they headed out to the stables. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Despite his absolute faith in his own people, Matt recognized that they were a small-town force. Before he ever reached Mahoney\u2019s himself, he\u2019d put through a call to Randy Newton, the friend at the FBI who had tested the library floorboard for him.</p><p>While he waited for Randy and his team to arrive, Matt followed Thayer around the mortuary, seeing where a screen had been broken in the basement, allowing the thief\u2014or thieves\u2014entry. Mahoney\u2019s desk had been rifled, but it looked like a sloppy job. Nothing had been taken but the hundred dollars from the petty cash box, while Mahoney\u2019s Rolex, a Christmas present from his wife the year before, lay untouched right on top of the desk.</p><p>The wooden evidence box, filled with dirt and bones, had been left in one of the viewing rooms, where one of Matt\u2019s men would have picked it up from to drive it on in to Digger at the museum.</p> <p>Mahoney was concerned, convinced that they were making far too much out of an ancient skeleton, and was concerned that the police would still be around when the Thompsons arrived for their great-aunt\u2019s funeral that night. Matt could only assure Mahoney that he\u2019d do his best to collect what he needed, and be out.</p><p>Randy Newton was a tall, well-built guy who had made some of the top scores when he\u2019d been in the academy at Quantico. He\u2019d met Matt while working on a serial killer case in the outskirts of D.C., a truly psychotic fellow who had preyed on impoverished prostitutes. They\u2019d worked together well, and remained friends. Despite the usual peace and tranquility to be found in Stoneyville, northern and central Virginia provided havens for criminals who struck in the bigger cities, and hid out in the countryside. Matt and Randy had kept up a communications system which had served them both well in the past.</p><p>Randy looked like FBI. He wore the inevitable suit, and sunglasses, and with his height, build, and dark hair, he emitted an aura of authority. Even Mahoney welcomed him with something like awe.</p><p>But when they were alone in the viewing room where the box had been, Randy shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t get it, Matt. I mean, I can see where you\u2019re angry, but hell. This probably is a fraternity prank. Who the hell would want a bunch of old bones?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRandy, there is no guarantee that they\u2019re old bones.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI thought that your psychic had been led to them by a ghost in a long, flowing white gown.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah\u2014and there are still lots of white flowing nightgowns out there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? I don\u2019t remember. I\u2019ve been married too long. Rita wears T-shirts.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cShe used to wear nothing at all, and that was pretty cool, but then we had the kids...hey, Matt, you\u2019re not smiling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I think this is serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know how many known murders I have on my plate right now, Matt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can imagine. But Randy, help me out on this. Get your guys to do the fingerprinting, look for any shoe marks...anything.\u201d He hesitated. \u201cAnd do me another favor.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRun your files for me. Look for anyone in your missing persons files who...who just might have disappeared from this area.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMatt, I think a bunch of kids stole the bones of a woman murdered so long ago, there\u2019s not a damned thing we can do for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRandy, help me out here anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid your psychic tell you to bring me in?\u201d Randy asked suspiciously.</p><p>\u201cRandy, no. I\u2019m asking a favor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right. You\u2019ve got it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need the files as quickly as possible.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDrive up to my office tomorrow. I\u2019ll give you everything I can get.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, you\u2019re looking frazzled as hell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t slept.\u201d</p><p>Randy cocked his head to one side. \u201cGhosts, ghosts, ghosts. Hell, I guess they can keep you awake. Go home. Go to sleep. We\u2019ll take over here. And get out before the funeral. Trust me. Go.\u201d</p><p>Matt didn\u2019t argue. He left Mahoney\u2019s, and headed straight home. He could hear Penny in her office when he stepped into the foyer, but he quickly slipped up the stairs, and crashed straight into his bed.</p><p>In a matter of minutes, he was sound asleep.</p><p>The ride was incredibly pleasant.</p><p>They headed out toward the north, following the main road for several miles, then riding into pasture land where canvas tents dotted the fields. They dismounted from their horses and walked around the various living history exhibits, visiting the blacksmith, an officer\u2019s tent, a seamstress, a common soldier\u2019s little plot, and the field hospital. Harry Smith introduced her to dozens of people, but when they came across those who had read about her in the newspapers, he politely but firmly found a way to steer her away.</p><p>Carter and Clint were old friends with many of the men as well, and with a few of their friends, they rode on over to the Yankee camp, where they all teased that she belonged.</p><p>Naturally, she reminded them who had won the war.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Carter said. \u201cThe North had to win. I mean, what were those fellows thinking, that any man had the right to own another? It\u2019s crazy now. But history.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd history we shouldn\u2019t forget,\u201d Clint said. \u201cThings that were horrible have to be remembered. Hopefully, we learn from our mistakes. What is that saying? Those who cannot remember the past are doomed to repeat it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery true,\u201d Harry Smith said. \u201cI fought in the very early stages of Viet Nam. Any man who has really gone to war knows how terrible it is. Generals usually do their best to avoid conflict\u2014politicians are the ones who are most eager for it. Anyway, don\u2019t get me started. Dusk is coming soon. We ought to get back. Let\u2019s take the back fields.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure you want to do that? We may have some fences in the way,\u201d Clint reminded him.</p><p>\u201cI know the way,\u201d Harry said.</p><p>The ride back was far more beautiful. They never touched a main road, but traveled around farm fields and pastureland. After one massive cornfield, they came up a lovely little stream, with the water dancing over small rocks and boulders.</p><p>\u201cSome of the heaviest fighting took place there, in the cornfield. Just like it was at the battle of Sharpesburg, men and corn alike were mowed down,\u201d Harry said. As they rode, the stream widened. They came upon a beautiful whitewashed wooden bridge, spanning the stream between fields and the dirt trail they rode.</p><p>\u201cThe bridge is new. The original was destroyed during the fighting. Dozens of men crashed through it, and died, broken and battered, on the rocks below,\u201d Harry said sadly.</p><p>Darcy could well imagine. There was an aura here, one of great sadness. She closed her eyes for a moment, and heard the heartrending cry of a wounded man. The lucky ones died instantly, she thought, because the others had lain with broken bones, in agony, while the fighting had continued.</p><p>She quickly opened her eyes. The memory of pain here was deep.</p><p>Harry winked at her. \u201cThere\u2019s some activity in this area tomorrow. But we don\u2019t destroy the bridge anymore. Too expensive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can imagine,\u201d Darcy said.</p><p>\u201cStill, you\u2019ll enjoy it, I promise!\u201d Carter told her.</p><p>\u201cDarcy, you should dress up,\u201d Clint said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a native,\u201d she told him.</p><p>Clint waved a hand in the air. \u201cHalf the Southerners today are from New York. Who cares? And there\u2019s still a romance about the Southern Cause. Oh, don\u2019t get me wrong. I have great friends who are true loyal Yanks! But it doesn\u2019t matter, we\u2019re reenacting history. Dress up, and ride with us. Not in the actual battle, of course. But you can be one of our wives. It\u2019ll be great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr she can belong to all of us,\u201d Carter said with a wink. \u201cCamp follower, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarter, really!\u201d Harry said with indignation.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2014prostitute. Penny did correct us, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not the point. Darcy is far too...dignified to be a camp follower!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a reenactment!\u201d Clint said, laughing. \u201cWe\u2019re not really going to put a \u2018for hire\u2019 sign on her, or anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see,\u201d Darcy said, laughing. \u201cI think I\u2019m fresh out of camp follower clothing, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPenny can set you all up,\u201d Clint said cheerfully.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s ride on,\u201d Harry said. \u201cIt\u2019s getting dark.\u201d</p><p>Matt had been soundly sleeping when he felt the fingertips moving down his cheek.</p><p>Then he woke with a vivid start.</p><p>The room was mostly in shadow, with dusk upon them, and yet he knew, instinctively, who it was.</p><p>\u201cLavinia!\u201d</p><p>He bolted out of the bed and turned on the light. She was still seated on the side of the bed, smiling.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you doing in my bedroom?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>She pouted, something she did very well. \u201cWhat a greeting! When I took the first plane down from New York just to show myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was great of you, Lavinia, really. But did you ever hear of knocking? Who let you up here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one let me up. I told Penny I\u2019d run up and see if you were awake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could have knocked.\u201d</p><p>She waved a hand in the air. \u201cI know my way around.\u201d She smiled. \u201cLook at that! I think you\u2019re getting a touch of gray in your hair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTime does go by.\u201d And it had. It had been years since he had seen her. With the initial shock of her arrival over, he had to admit, it had been pretty decent of her to come. He was actually going to enjoy seeing Darcy\u2019s face when she met Lavinia. \u201cBut you,\u201d he said magnanimously. \u201cYou look great.\u201d</p><p>She did. Her hair was still long, red, and shining. She seemed to have acquired more of a lithe, hourglass figure.</p><p>She stood. \u201cYou think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. You\u2019re even more...voluptuous than ever.\u201d</p><p>She grinned. \u201cOkay, so I had a boob job. They did great work though. Want to see?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He laughed. \u201cNo, but thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, so there\u2019s something going on with the ghost chaser, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you come because you were bored, Lavinia, or to help me out?\u201d</p> <p>She reflected the comment honestly for a minute. \u201cOkay, maybe I was a little bored. But I did come to help you out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant to really help me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet out of my bedroom. I\u2019ll be right down.\u201d</p><p>Lavinia rose regally, stretching like a cat. She walked by him, rising against him, planting a kiss on his cheek. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll still be bored if the little ghost chaser goes away.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLavinia, we\u2019ve been that route before. Let\u2019s be friends, huh?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged and started toward the door. \u201cYour cousin still hanging around here? And that handsome friend of his?\u201d</p><p>\u201cClint\u2014and Carter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarter, yeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re still around, Lavinia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd they\u2019ve gone through women like toilet paper, I take it. But then again, I\u2019m not the usual country fare, am I?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf you\u2019re trying to make me jealous, Lavinia, I told you, we\u2019ve been that route before.\u201d</p><p>Her smiled deepened. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to make you jealous. I\u2019m just bored.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure that both Carter and Clint will be around for dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. I am hungry,\u201d she said, and at last departed his room.</p><p>Darcy insisted on taking care of Nellie when they returned to the stables, though Sam was waiting for them, and managed to remove the horse\u2019s saddle the minute she had crawled out of it. \u201cThey\u2019re waiting for you, up at the house,\u201d Sam told them.</p><p>\u201cWaiting for us? Are we late for dinner? It\u2019s early,\u201d Carter said.</p><p>Sam rolled his eyes. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a visitor.\u201d He turned his back on them, leading Tannenbaum back to his stall.</p><p>\u201cA mystery. How cool,\u201d Clint said.</p> <p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Carter asked Sam, frowning.</p><p>Harry linked an arm with his. \u201cLet\u2019s just go on up and see.\u201d</p><p>It looked as if Carter still wanted to protest but he was dragged along. As they walked up the porch steps, Darcy knew that she was curious herself. They walked into the foyer, and saw a group sitting in the parlor.</p><p>Adam, up and dressed and looking very regal. Penny, flushed and a little flustered. And Matt, casual in jeans and a knit polo shirt.</p><p>And a woman.</p><p>A really gorgeous woman in tight black pants and a blue silk shirt that enhanced her assets to a T.</p><p>She stood with the others as they entered.</p><p>\u201cMy Lord!\u201d Clint breathed.</p><p>Matt smiled broadly at Darcy across the room. \u201cDarcy! I think the others have all met. This is Lavinia Harper. Lavinia, Darcy Tremayne.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 18</p><p>18</p><p>M att might have been mad as a hornet that morning, but now, he was as smug as the Cheshire cat. He somehow refrained from shouting, \u201cShe\u2019s alive. See, see! My ex-wife is alive and well.\u201d</p><p>And stunning. Smooth, elegant, and with perfect poise and sophistication, though her eyes were still curious and judging when they fell upon Darcy.</p><p>\u201cMiss Tremayne! I\u2019ve been reading about you all the way up in New York.\u201d Lavinia took her hand in a truly decent shake.</p><p>\u201cHave you?\u201d she said dryly, then, \u201cIt\u2019s a pleasure to meet you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, of course, it is,\u201d Lavinia said. \u201cWith bones popping up all over, I\u2019m happy to prove that they\u2019re not mine. But if you\u2019re a psychic, shouldn\u2019t you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been trying to explain to Lavinia that dealing with the mind is not always such an obvious thing,\u201d Adam said.</p><p>\u201cLavinia, you are gorgeous!\u201d Clint told her.</p><p>\u201cClint! I haven\u2019t given you a hug yet.\u201d The woman flashed Darcy a smile. \u201cIf they wanted to be honest, they\u2019d all tell you that it\u2019s not such a thrill to have me here, but these are true old-time Southerners, determined on the old hospitality!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLavinia, really. We\u2019re certainly pleased to have you,\u201d Penny said stiffly.</p><p>Lavinia broke into laughter. \u201cHer words a lie, her tone the truth! Oh, Penny, don\u2019t go getting all flustered.\u201d She offered her smile to Darcy again. \u201cThe boys, however, really don\u2019t mind too badly, hm? Clint, I\u2019m still waiting on the hug.\u201d</p><p>She walked toward him. Clint winked at Darcy and mouthed, \u201cYow! Come to me, baby!\u201d</p><p>She turned. Matt was looking at her. Still smug and pleased.</p><p>\u201cHey, any luck finding the bones?\u201d Carter asked Matt.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cBut we will find them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat can I get you all to drink?\u201d Penny asked.</p><p>\u201cBeer for me, thanks, Penny,\u201d Clint said. Lavinia had gone on to hug Carter and Harry.</p><p>\u201cDitto!\u201d Carter said, over Lavinia\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>\u201cA Coke for me,\u201d Harry called, next in line for the buxom hug.</p><p>\u201cDarcy?\u201d Matt asked politely.</p><p>She met his eyes and smiled sheepishly. \u201cA big anything,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cNot too big. I just found out myself that Adam bought you a present today,\u201d Matt said.</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Darcy looked at Adam.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about it a long time. Sam helped me out after I made it out of bed,\u201d Adam said.</p><p>\u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d Darcy asked him.</p><p>\u201cMuch better. Sleep helped a lot,\u201d Adam said.</p><p>\u201cYes, it does,\u201d Matt said. \u201cDarcy, I\u2019ll get you a beer. Better yet, come with me to the kitchen\u2014if that\u2019s all right with you, Adam?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCertainly,\u201d Adam said.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Darcy asked.</p><p>\u201cYour present is in the kitchen,\u201d Matt told her.</p><p>She followed him, and as he walked to the refrigerator, she looked around. Then she heard a sound and solid bark. Matt grinned, handing her the beer.</p><p>\u201cA dog?\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cAdam thought that, since you didn\u2019t seem able to stop yourself from running around in the middle of the night, you should have a big dog. She\u2019s around the counter in her crate, waiting to meet you.\u201d</p><p>Darcy walked around the counter. Her tail wagging away, one of the most beautiful German shepherds Darcy had ever seen was waiting impatiently.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s gorgeous!\u201d Darcy said.</p><p>\u201cYou can let her out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe full-grown?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlmost full-grown, and fully trained. And once she gets to know you, she\u2019ll be your most loyal fan, and most ardent protector. Hopefully, you won\u2019t send her after me. Now that you know that Lavinia is alive and well.\u201d</p><p>Darcy had slipped the bolt on the crate and the dog was sniffing and licking her hands. She looked at Matt. \u201cI never really thought\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but now you don\u2019t even have to suspect, huh?\u201d</p><p>Darcy gave her attention to the dog.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, too,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cFor?\u201d she asked, looking up at him.</p><p>\u201cFor the times I have tried to convince myself that you were just too eerie to get really close to,\u201d he said flatly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still eerie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot to me.\u201d</p><p>She smiled, but wondered if she really believed him.</p><p>\u201cLavinia is really as gorgeous as everyone said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, she is,\u201d he agreed, but he shoved his way close to her, despite the dog. \u201cSo help, huh?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cHelp?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStick close.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need protection from her? Do you doubt yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot for a minute. But she\u2019s really the touchy-feely kind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm,\u201d Darcy said, studying his eyes. \u201cBut you really do seem to be in a good mood tonight. And I was warned that you were in a real temper this morning. You must be happy to see Lavinia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m happy for you to see Lavinia,\u201d he said.</p><p>She smiled, then became serious. \u201cBut the bones were stolen,\u201d she reminded him.</p><p>He ran his fingers down her cheek, the touch gentle, his voice like lead. \u201cYou mean more to me than the bones, but trust me, I\u2019ll find them. I have the best forensic help you can get anywhere in the world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh? Is that why you\u2019re not still down at the funeral home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve asked a friend in the FBI for help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo find old bones?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo we know that they\u2019re old bones?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head in response to his question, still studying his eyes. He shrugged then. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to mention that fact. Everyone will know soon enough. It\u2019s no great secret. But for now...\u201d</p><p>He was interrupted by a bark. The shepherd stood looking up at them, wagging her tail.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s her name?\u201d Darcy asked.</p><p>\u201cOola.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOola?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAccording to Sam, her breeder was very fond of the play The Producers,\u201d Matt explained with a smile.</p><p>\u201cI see. Oola! Come on, let\u2019s go and tell Adam thanks!\u201d</p><p>Darcy returned to the parlor with her beer and her dog. Matt followed behind with the two bottles of beer for Clint and Carter and a Coke for Harry.</p><p>\u201cThank God I wasn\u2019t drowning!\u201d Carter said.</p><p>\u201cA dog!\u201d Clint exclaimed.</p><p>Darcy hunkered down with Oola, smiling at Adam. \u201cShe\u2019s beautiful and a great gift, thank you so much, Adam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve had a dog in mind for you for some time now,\u201d Adam said. \u201cSam just happened to know the right folks. She\u2019s house broken, six months old, and she\u2019ll bond to you like glue, so he assures me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat animal,\u201d Clint said.</p><p>\u201cGreat protection,\u201d Matt said.</p><p>\u201cDo ghosts get dangerous?\u201d Lavinia asked.</p><p>\u201cApparently, the pursuit of them may be,\u201d Matt said. He was staring at Harry. \u201cThat uniform is great on you,\u201d he said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWell, you\u2019ll be in uniform tomorrow, too,\u201d Harry told him.</p><p>\u201cNot me.

I was going to be crowd control, you know, act like the sheriff. Thayer can handle it all, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMatt, Penny has a point,\u201d Adam said. \u201cYou should be here. After all, this is Stoneyville.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClint is a Stone. He\u2019ll have to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow. Great. Thanks,\u201d Clint said.</p><p>\u201cSorry. I didn\u2019t mean it that way,\u201d Matt said sheepishly.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re the one so big on tourism, Matt. On showing folks our little piece of Virginia. You\u2019re so gung ho on opening historic houses and buildings. How can you fail to be part of a reenactment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, Matt!\u201d Clint said.</p><p>\u201cI have really important business,\u201d he told them.</p><p>\u201cDarcy is going to be part of it,\u201d Clint told him.</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Matt arched a brow to her.</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cThey think I should dress up, at least.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat fun!\u201d Lavinia put in. \u201cI\u2019d love to playact.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are more than invited to join us,\u201d Carter said graciously.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be there.\u201d</p><p>Oola barked, as if agreeing that she\u2019d participate as well, causing them all to laugh.</p><p>\u201cEven Oola will be there,\u201d Penny told Matt.</p><p>Darcy was surprised to see him suddenly hesitate, which seemed strange. He\u2019d been so definite. \u201cYou know,\u201d he said, \u201cthere was a General Stone. But he was nowhere near Stoney ville during the fighting. He was surrounding Richmond at the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMatt, you\u2019ve always taken part before,\u201d Clint reminded him. He looked at Darcy. \u201cHe\u2019s usually Ian Ripley, a cavalry captain, like Harry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see,\u201d Matt said. \u201cI have business, like I told you. But I\u2019ll see how far things have progressed by the morning. Hey, Penny, is something burning?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe roast!\u201d Penny said with dismay. She leapt up.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll help you,\u201d Darcy offered.</p><p>As she ran after Penny, Oola followed.</p><p>She didn\u2019t go after the food; she just sat in the kitchen. And when they left the kitchen, she sat by Darcy\u2019s feet at the dining room table.</p><p>The meal was light, and fun, with everyone talking about the reenactment, and Lavinia bringing them all up to date on her social whirl, while flirting outrageously with every man at the table, including Harry. Still, after the nights they\u2019d been having, it seemed a blessing.</p><p>Later, with the place cleaned up, the hour getting late, Matt at last rose to break up the group. \u201cI slept all afternoon, but I\u2019m still bushed. Harry, did you want to stay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope, got to go home, thanks,\u201d Harry said.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s lots of room in the caretaker\u2019s cottage,\u201d Lavinia told him. He blushed to the roots\u2014the exact effect she had intended.</p><p>\u201cI have to go,\u201d Harry said, \u201cbut thanks.\u201d</p><p>Matt walked Harry to the door, then came back by Darcy\u2019s chair. She thought she was going to blush herself when he said, \u201cReady to go up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, sure,\u201d she said, trying to sound very casual.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll just let myself out,\u201d Lavinia said.</p><p>\u201cNever! I\u2019ll escort you,\u201d Carter said.</p><p>\u201cHey, I\u2019ll walk with you. He\u2019s dangerous,\u201d Clint teased.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Lavinia said. \u201cI like dangerous men.\u201d</p><p>Darcy gave Adam a kiss on the cheek and followed Matt up the stairs.</p><p>Oola followed her.</p><p>She started for the Lee Room.</p><p>\u201cNot tonight!\u201d Matt told her. \u201cMy place,\u201d he said lightly. \u201cOola can have the office area. We\u2019ll take the bedroom. Alone. No ladies in white or any other visitors tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis house does give new meaning to the term, \u2018your place or mine,\u2019\u201d Darcy murmured. With the dog at her heels, she accompanied him.</p><p>The minute they locked the dog out of the bedroom area, and turned to one another, she began to whine. They looked at one another and laughed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m prepared,\u201d Matt told her.</p><p>\u201cFor a whining dog?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bet.\u201d</p><p>He disappeared, then returned smiling. When the door closed, Oola was quiet. Darcy lifted a brow to him.</p><p>\u201cPig\u2019s ear,\u201d Matt said.</p><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe came with a supply of pigs\u2019 ears,\u201d he explained. \u201cChew toys. And now...well, you really do owe me an apology.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor thinking I might have done evil to my ex-wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t really think it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm. Humor me.\u201d He walked to her, embracing her, offering a kiss that was electric and fevered, lips tugging upon hers, tongue all but savage in its raw seduction. The same fevered urgency came damply down the length of her throat, while his fingers, at their most nimble, tugged at buttons and the zipper of her jeans. She ran her own fingers around his waistband, finding his zipper as well, and finding that just the sound of it, and the promise there given was erotic. She might have been the one who owed the apology, but he was creating an arousal and urgency in her that was high-pitched and searing. The stroke of his fingers down the bareness of her back seemed to elicit a burning in the core of her sexuality, and she moved against him wantonly, wondering only in a very distant place in her mind if he might be determined to forget that Lavinia was on his property. Then even the whisper of such a thought eluded her, for his lips were everywhere, a caress that swept over and into her. The scent of him invaded her, and whispering a soft penance, she returned each brush of a fingertip, every steam-tipped stroke of the tongue, every intimacy, until at last they were arching, writhing, straining, and pulsing together toward a maddened crescendo that burst upon Darcy violently, climax racking her body with delicious shudders, loathe to let the least touch, taste, or scent of him leave her. And for the longest time, he did not. She lay against him, hair splayed over the vital dampness of his chest, deliciously drowsy.</p><p>She must have been exhausted herself, because she drifted to sleep.</p><p>When she woke, she was alone.</p><p>\u201cMatt?\u201d she said his name softly, but he wasn\u2019t there.</p><p>Puzzled, she opened the door to the office area. And then she could see him. He\u2019d thrown on a robe and was out on the balcony, just staring into the night. He looked like a man in torment. The dog was at his side, and Matt was absently stroking the shepherd\u2019s ears.</p><p>Darcy wanted to go to him, but she didn\u2019t. Instead, she stood there watching him, and thinking that if they did or didn\u2019t find the bones soon, it wouldn\u2019t matter. It was time to go. She had allowed this involvement, and encouraged it, lost herself within it. But she was certain that she knew what gave him such anguish.</p><p>He did care about her. He really cared.</p><p>But no matter what he tried to tell himself, what she was, what she did, mattered to him. He would never be able to look at her without remembering her tearing through the dirt for a bone, or falling into a trance, and not feel repelled.</p><p>She determined to leave him in peace. She closed the door and slipped back into bed.</p><p>Later, when he returned, she was the aggressor, laughing and teasing at first, then telling him how sorry she was.</p><p>Truly, how sorry she was.</p><p>Darcy was still sleeping when Matt awoke. He quietly slipped from the bed, showered, dressed, and took Oola downstairs so that she could take a run outside.</p><p>Penny was already up; coffee was already on. Matt accepted a cup, slipped into his downstairs office, and called Randy Newton. He didn\u2019t know if he was relieved or impatient when Randy apologized profusely, but between working the crime scene at the mortuary and handling a political death that was suspicious, he hadn\u2019t been able to pull all the records he could find as yet.</p><p>\u201cGive me a day, Matt. Hell, that\u2019s nothing in most cases, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right, Randy. I appreciate your help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, tomorrow is Sunday, but I\u2019ll keep working until I get it. My wife is going to hate you, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell her your workload is my fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, I have to blame it on someone, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess,\u201d Matt said. \u201cHonestly, thanks. If you do get anything, anything at all, call me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can tell you this\u2014whoever broke in to the mortuary wore gloves, and even slipped plastic bags over his shoes. We went over the window screen and the rest of the place for fibers, and came up with zilch. Anyway, I\u2019ll get on those records, though I think you\u2019re barking up the wrong tree. The bones haven\u2019t shown up anywhere, have they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not that I know of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo deal with your battle buffs. I\u2019ll call you, I promise, the minute I\u2019ve got something.\u201d</p><p>Matt thanked him again and hung up. He drummed his fingers on the desk, feeling antsy, and thinking there had to be something more that he could do. He\u2019d called in the FBI. Best help he could have, and he knew it.</p><p>There was a tap at his door and Penny stuck her head in..</p><p>\u201cAre you going to have to leave town today?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He wished that he could lie.</p><p>\u201cNo, Penny,\u201d he said honestly.</p><p>Her smile lit up her face like a Christmas tree.</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019ve already got Thayer in charge of crowd control, right? I mean, of course, I know the society manages things really well, but that you put out the officers as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should oversee it all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMatt! Thayer is the best deputy a sheriff ever had. You leave him in control. Come on now, please? I\u2019ve got your Captain Whittaker uniform all ready.\u201d</p><p>He groaned. \u201cPenny, I\u2019d told you I probably wasn\u2019t going to be here, and that if I was\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBut you are here, and Thayer is in control. Oh, Matt! It means so much to everyone when the Stone of Stoneyville takes part!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, Penny, all right. Where\u2019s the uniform?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the laundry. I\u2019ll bring it right to you.\u201d</p><p>Penny\u2019s excitement and enthusiasm regarding the day was contagious. Darcy had barely emerged from the shower when Penny arrived with a surprisingly complicated costume. \u201cNaturally, it\u2019s the real thing, corset, pantalettes, hoop, chemise...it\u2019s a little hot, being summer, but not so bad. We\u2019re going to have a breeze. Of course, in a way, that\u2019s bad. There will be black powder everywhere, but it\u2019s great, really, because you get the true essence of how horrible battle was and just what the poor men faced. It will be great. Now, the chemise goes on first, corset over that, then the dress. It\u2019s not an elegant evening gown, but a typical day dress. Nice one, and it will look great on you. Deep blue. It will do wonders for your hair.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThanks, Penny,\u201d Darcy said, and she meant it until Penny tried to tie her too tightly into the corset.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s how they really wore them!\u201d Penny told her.</p><p>\u201cHey, that was then, this is now. I\u2019m not passing out on the battlefield, okay, please?\u201d</p><p>With a sigh, Penny eased her hold on the ribbons. \u201cLavinia will let you tie her up until she\u2019s just about dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll just bet she looks great then,\u201d Darcy said. \u201cI want to breathe through the show.\u201d</p> <p>When she went downstairs, she discovered that Matt had already headed out\u2014as a last-minute participant, he had to fill in his registration papers for insurance purposes. But Carter and Clint were waiting for her.</p><p>\u201cWow!\u201d Clint told her. \u201cIt\u2019s a look\u2014it\u2019s a look!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe best that money can buy, huh?\u201d Carter teased.</p><p>They were alone with Penny in the foyer. \u201cIs Lavinia coming with us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLavinia, ride? Are you kidding? Adam is driving her down the road to the field. We\u2019ll go the way we came back yesterday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d Darcy said. She felt a cold nose touch her hand. Oola. She stroked the dog and looked at the two men. \u201cCan she come?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSure,\u201d Carter said with a shrug.</p><p>\u201cMaybe we should leave her in the house,\u201d Clint said. \u201cAll the commotion out there...she may not be used to it,\u201d Clint said.</p><p>\u201cThere will be all kinds of dogs around. People bring their pets,\u201d Carter said.</p><p>\u201cI guess you\u2019re right. All right, Oola. Let\u2019s see what kind of a cavalry dog you\u2019ll make. Of course, you won\u2019t really be riding with the cavalry,\u201d Clint said. \u201cWe\u2019ll set you up with Penny, Lavinia, and Adam, and whoever else is around, during the battle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds good,\u201d she said.</p><p>When they arrived at the field, they could see it was already crawling with people. Darcy was startled when the three of them were asked to stop a dozen times for tourists to take pictures.</p><p>Carter grinned at her. \u201cSee, you look great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. I\u2019m glad I make a good camp follower.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe dress is too good,\u201d Clint said. \u201cYou get to be my wife today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour wife? Why not mine?\u201d Carter argued.</p><p>Darcy could see that most of the people were arranged behind a makeshift fence. There were officers in sheriff\u2019s department uniforms patrolling the lines, while those in Civil War attire were on the other side of the fence. \u201cWhere\u2019s Matt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith his company, probably,\u201d Carter said. \u201cWe\u2019ll find them later. We\u2019ll position you back here\u2014you can see better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere will Adam and the others be?\u201d Darcy asked.</p><p>\u201cIf they get here soon enough, we\u2019ll bring \u2019em back with you,\u201d Carter said. \u201cIf not, they\u2019re going to have to join the rest of the tourists.\u201d He tipped his hat to her, then dismounted to offer her a hand down. \u201cWe\u2019ll tether Nellie right here. Don\u2019t you love that\u2014a perfect historical image, until you see the hotdog stand!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, well, progress, what can you do?\u201d Darcy sympathized.</p><p>\u201cI have to go down on the first volley,\u201d Clint told her, \u201cso I\u2019ll get back to you as soon as I can reasonably crawl, noble and injured, off the field.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou get to go down with the first volley?\u201d Carter asked him as they rode off.</p><p>Darcy grinned, and was then surprised when a Robert E. Lee look-alike rode out to the center of the field on a beautiful white horse, dismounted, and lifted a megaphone to speak. He introduced the day of the battle, the circumstances that brought about the skirmish. Yankee troops, cut off, were trying to wind their way back to Meade, while the Southern troops were riding to catch up with Lee before the battle at Sharpsburg. A militia troop had recently held up a Northern baggage train, and, realizing they had a small force of the enemy in their sights, decided to turn the stolen guns against their enemy. It had been a bitter day of fighting, some of it house-to-house, but the majority of the action had taken place here, when the guns had sent the tattered Northerners fleeing. And yet it had not been a victory for either side as far too many lives had been lost.</p><p>When he finished speaking, he gave a flourish of his hat, mounted his white horse, and left the field in a flurry of hooves and dirt. The moment he was gone, the first cannon sounded. The battle commenced.</p><p>Darcy was spellbound. She had never imagined what such a battle must have been like. Within minutes, the powder produced by the cannons and guns filled the air. Officers roared out commands from both sides of the field. The cavalry came in first, and it was an incredible show, horses rearing, swords flying. Men advanced, went down, retreated.</p><p>She saw Matt, riding with his sword swirling in the black-misted air, all but standing in his saddle. A pang touched her heart.</p><p>He disappeared into the field of black powder.</p><p>Foot soldiers advanced behind the cavalry. From the hillock where Clint and Carter had left her, Darcy was in perfect position, and she was enthralled.</p><p>Suddenly she felt an odd sense of real pain and nostalgia sweep over her. She closed her eyes, and the shouting seemed to change.</p><p>She opened her eyes to true horror.</p><p>There were twice as many men on the field. And there were no spectators. Broken, bleeding, riddled with bullets, soldiers in blue and in gray lay littering the field. A horse whinnied in terror and went down. Bullets flew hard and furious...she heard the whap of one as it struck the tree near her.</p><p>Darcy had closed her eyes...and opened them to a vision of what had once been real. It was appalling, horrifying. Northern soldiers and Southern soldiers, praying to the same God, dying...praying that they headed for the same heaven. For a moment, the image, and the pain it awakened, was almost unbearable.</p><p>At her side, she heard a whining sound. She shook her head and blinked.</p><p>And she was drawn back to the present.</p><p>She heard the crowd yelling in appreciation. Oola pawed her, huge brown eyes wide with distress as they fell upon Darcy.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, girl,\u201d she said, hugging the dog. \u201cI\u2019m back.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly, Oola barked excitedly. Darcy looked back to see a soldier emerging from the powder that now seemed to blanket the entire scene.</p><p>\u201cDarcy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cClint!\u201d</p><p>She rose, dusting her hands on her skirt. \u201cThat was truly magnificent. So sad, of course, but it\u2019s true, the reenactment really makes you appreciate what it must have been like.\u201d</p><p>He grinned at her. \u201cHey, Matt is off the field, too. Let\u2019s mount up, and we\u2019ll find him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s your horse?\u201d</p><p>Clint sighed. \u201cI told you, I had to go down at the first volley. My horse is with the Yankees now.\u201d He grinned. \u201cWe\u2019ll get him back later. My buddy, Aaron Swenson got to capture him. I\u2019ll hop up with you on Nellie for now, if it\u2019s all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, it\u2019s all right,\u201d Darcy said.</p><p>She mounted first. Clint leapt up ably behind her. Oola stared at them, barking furiously.</p><p>\u201cOola, what is the matter with you?\u201d Darcy said. \u201cClint, which way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat way,\u201d he said, and pointed ahead.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure? Isn\u2019t that back toward the house, through the fields?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re disoriented, Darcy. It\u2019s the powder. Trust me, I know where I\u2019m going.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d had a hell of a good time, Matt had to admit. Riding off the field in triumph, laughing with James Arnold, head of one of the Union companies, he congratulated his friend on the excellent fake sword fight they had waged, and their speed and prowess in getting off the field.</p><p>\u201cHey, Matt, never give it up!\u201d James told him, giving him a thumbs-up sign as they left the field.</p><p>Matt nodded and grinned, then realized that his cell phone was ringing.</p><p>\u201cHey, did you guys have those back then?\u201d James teased.</p><p>\u201cHell, no. We\u2019d have won the war if we\u2019d had \u2019em,\u201d Matt said. \u201cSheriffs have to carry them,\u201d he said in something of an apology.</p><p>He urged his horse a distance from the field as he punched in to answer.</p><p>\u201cHello? Matt Stone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMatt! Jesus! I\u2019ve been trying to get you for hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRandy?\u201d Matt said, his muscles tensing instantly at his friend\u2019s tone. \u201cYou found the bones?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but I found something else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know you asked me about missing persons?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are at least five women last seen in or around your area who\u2019ve been reported missing.\u201d</p><p>A strange freeze settled over Matt.</p><p>\u201cI can change and get right up there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo need. I can fax you this stuff. But get this\u2014none of them were really from the area. Just passing through. But this one, Susan Howell, twenty-six, five-five, one-hundred-twenty pounds. Professional girl, no family, last seen at the gas station right by the highway exit to Stoneyville. Here\u2019s another. Catherine Angsley, last seen at the drugstore on the town line. She came from Stamford, Connecticut, folks deceased, another professional, a biochemist, made good money, and was reported missing months after that incident by a grandmother, who has since passed away. Then there\u2019s\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cStop!\u201d Matt said. \u201cGive me the names again!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSusan Howell, Catherine Angsley. There\u2019s a Tammy Silvera\u2014hey, have you ever heard of these women?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Matt said dully. \u201cThey dated a friend of the family. A man named Carter Sutton.\u201d He looked anxiously around the field. He could see nothing but powder. Darcy had left the house that day with Carter and Clint. He hadn\u2019t seen any of them since, except for Clint, when he lay on the ground after the first volley.</p> <p>\u201cRandy, I\u2019ve got to go. We need APBs out on Carter Sutton, right away. I\u2019ve got to find him. I need you to get to my own men for me\u2014I\u2019ve got to get searching through this crowd.\u201d</p><p>He rang off, not waiting for Randy\u2019s reply; he knew the man would take it from there.</p><p>Right then, he felt a sense of sheer panic.</p><p>Carter had dated the women, yes. Didn\u2019t mean that Carter had made them disappear.</p><p>Clint, and Carter. They both went through women with total nonchalance.</p> <p>He felt ill, thinking that Darcy still might be with either of them.</p><p>Activity was spinning around him. Where the hell were they?</p><p>This way.</p><p>He almost fell off his horse. The whisper again. He looked toward the trees. Nothing.</p><p>This way!</p><p>The whisper, urgent, fierce.</p> <p>He started to ride.</p><p>\u201cWait a minute\u2014maybe I am going the wrong way,\u201d Clint said. \u201cI don\u2019t believe this! I\u2019m disoriented myself. Hang on a minute.\u201d</p><p>Clint dismounted and disappeared into the smoke. Darcy waited. At her side, Oola began growling.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it, girl?\u201d</p><p>A moment later, a man emerged from the trees. But it wasn\u2019t Clint. It was Carter.</p><p>\u201cHey, lady! You\u2019re going the wrong way!\u201d he called cheerfully.</p><p>Oola growled again.</p><p>\u201cShush, girl! It\u2019s only Carter. Where\u2019s Clint?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI was riding his horse. I gave it back to him. Let me mount up and show you the right way to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTurn her around,\u201d Carter said. She did so, and they started to trot.</p><p>\u201cMy God, that smoke carries!\u201d Darcy said.</p><p>\u201cI know. It\u2019s blinding, right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBig time!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, pull up ahead for a minute, will you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d Darcy frowned, trying to see clearly. They had come to the area where the bridge spanned the rushing stream. \u201cWhy are we here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, it\u2019s on the way back to the house. We\u2019re meeting up there. But I had to run over and do duty on the bridge after the first engagement. I lost a glove. Do you mind? It will only take a minute for me to feel around for it.\u201d Carter smiled at her, and slipped from the horse\u2019s back. \u201cHey! How about giving me a hand. It will go faster.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>Carter helped her down.</p><p>\u201cGo on. Let me just tether Nellie to this tree.\u201d</p><p>Nonchalantly, Carter started toward the bridge. Darcy tethered Nellie to a branch, then turned back. To her amaze ment, Oola started to growl again and went rushing toward the bridge. She heard the dog yelp.</p><p>\u201cOola! Carter, what happened?\u201d</p><p>Halfway to the bridge, she came to a sudden halt. She could see Carter, standing there, waiting for her.</p><p>She could also see a strange white form through the mist.</p><p>\u201cDarcy? What are you waiting for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to the dog?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Maybe she stepped on a sharp stone or something.\u201d</p><p>Darcy didn\u2019t move. The white mist was next to Carter. She couldn\u2019t believe that he didn\u2019t see it, especially against the smoky tinge the day had taken on.</p><p>\u201cDarcy, what on earth is the matter with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe ghost is there, Carter. Right next to you,\u201d she said.</p><p>He jumped, staring around. But he still didn\u2019t see. He turned back to Darcy, his eyes narrowing. \u201cCome here, Darcy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot on your life, Carter.\u201d</p><p>But she wasn\u2019t prepared. He ran like a bat out of hell, so suddenly and swiftly that she had barely screamed and turned to run before he was on top of her, grappling her to the ground. \u201cYou\u2019re going over the bridge, Darcy. This time, you\u2019re going over. I meant business at the cemetery\u2014but again, I thought you\u2019d be smart enough to get away from here. No, not you. So...before you find the bones again, Darcy, you\u2019ve got to have a real fall.\u201d</p><p>He held her down. But her fingers were grasping in the dirt. She managed to get a handful. She got a good grip, and threw it in his eyes. His hold on her eased as he shouted in pain, instinctively bringing his hands to his face as he tried to clear his vision.</p><p>Darcy took full advantage. She brought her knee to his groin with all her strength. He howled with pain. She shot to her feet.</p><p>But before she could run, his fingers wound around her ankle, and he jerked her hard, back down to the earth.</p><p>The world spun in black. She felt him picking her up. She knew he meant to take her to the bridge and throw her over. And she would break her neck, or smash her skull, and she would die there, and when they found her...</p><p>Well, it would look as if she had gotten lost in the black powder. Wandered over the bridge, fallen....</p><p>\u201cYou killed her, the girl in the smokehouse,\u201d Darcy said, praying her strength would return.</p><p>\u201cHer? Yeah, I killed the girl in the smokehouse.\u201d He looked down at her. \u201cKind of a sad thing, really. You\u2019re terrific, Darcy. You really are. But you just had to go and find the bones. And open the whole can of worms. I really am sorry, Darcy. But...hopefully,\u201d he said softly, \u201cit will be quick.\u201d</p><p>She had gathered her senses again. The world had ceased to spin.</p><p>She raised her fist with all her strength against his eye. He grunted, doubling in pain, and she raked her nails down his arm, escaping his hold and falling hard to the ground.</p><p>They had come to the bridge.</p><p>And he was scrambling to get ahold of her again.</p><p>Chapter 19</p><p>19</p><p>M att raged inwardly at himself for being a fool. Even as he carefully rode Vernon through the crowds of people, he flicked open his phone again and called Thayer. The phone rang and rang. He knew his deputy was in the midst of the throng, and swore, praying that Thayer would hear the call. He had about given up when he heard, \u201cThayer here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThayer, it\u2019s Matt. I can\u2019t explain but get all our men looking for Carter Sutton. Hold him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHold Carter? On what charge?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuspicion of murder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMurder? Carter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn it, Thayer, just do it. Get him, and hold him. And keep an eye out for Darcy Tremayne.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe murdered someone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThayer, I don\u2019t have time. Just do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m right on it, Matt.\u201d</p><p>He clicked off, swearing that he should be in the midst of so many people. With the exhibition over, they were thronging over the fields.</p><p>Thayer had been alerted; whether his deputy thought he had gone off the deep end or not, he would see that every man they had was looking for Carter. And just because women Carter had dated were missing did not mean that Carter had murdered. But a number of women Carter had dated were missing, and a skeleton had been discovered on property Carter knew like the back of his hand. Then the skeleton had disappeared. And he didn\u2019t know where Carter was, and he didn\u2019t have Darcy. Carter didn\u2019t know that his game might be up anyway, that Matt had asked the FBI to run a check of missing women. In Carter\u2019s mind, Darcy must surely be dangerous. If he had stolen the bones from the morgue, he must be afraid that Darcy could find them again, wherever he had taken them.</p><p>And there was a voice in his head, telling him which way to go. Insane, but hell, everyone had instinct. And instinct was telling him to follow the voice.</p><p>He ignored the sound when he first heard his name called, he was so intent on following his intuition, or the voice.</p><p>Then he realized that it was Adam Harrison, and he pulled in on the reins.</p><p>\u201cMatt, there\u2019s no sign of Darcy,\u201d he said. \u201cClint went to find her. He\u2019d left her in the rear for a better view. Now Clint hasn\u2019t returned. I\u2019m not Darcy, Matt, but I have one damned bad feeling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAdam, I have that feeling myself. But don\u2019t worry. I\u2019m going for Darcy.\u201d</p><p>He nudged Vernon and moved on. He had cleared the battlefield when he was blocked again by someone on horseback, hazy in the black smoke, but solidly on the trail.</p><p>\u201cMatt!\u201d she cried.</p><p>Lavinia. On a horse. Lavinia, who hated horses.</p><p>\u201cLavinia, what the hell are you doing? Get out of my way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMatt! Please, you have to listen to me,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cNot now, Lavinia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have to listen to me. I told Carter I wanted to be with Darcy to watch the show. He said sure, then disappeared. And I can\u2019t find her now. Or Carter. Or Clint! Matt, there are a few things that I never told you. And when I was going through the crowd, I saw some guy in blue with Clint\u2019s horse. They\u2019ve all disappeared. Matt, there\u2019s something I never told you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re too late, Lavinia, whatever it is. Get out of my way.\u201d He urged Vernon forward, heedless of her presence there.</p><p>\u201cWait, Matt!\u201d She grappled for the reins as Vernon forced her horse off the side of the trail. \u201cPlease listen to me! I was certain I was wrong, that I had to be wrong...but I\u2019m afraid for Darcy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn it, I\u2019m afraid for her, too! That\u2019s why I\u2019m trying to find her.\u201d</p><p>He went on past her, nudging Vernon into a lope.</p><p>She was following him, swearing as she clung to the saddle.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m coming with you!\u201d she called out to him.</p><p>\u201cGo back! You\u2019ll slow me down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no...I can keep up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo what you want, but stay out of my way.\u201d</p><p>He nudged Vernon into greater speed. Nothing seemed to matter anymore except for the voice in his head, guiding him onward. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But in the grayness of the day, Vernon suddenly reared. Behind Matt, Lavinia screamed, trying to maintain her seat. Matt controlled his panicked horse, then saw the dark bundle in the road ahead of him. He dismounted quickly, hunkering down, his heart in his throat.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t Darcy.</p><p>\u201cClint!\u201d He set his fingers against his cousin\u2019s throat. There was a pulse. Clint groaned, turning. There was a massive lump on his temple. He stared up at Matt with dazed eyes. \u201cMatt.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know...I was lost. Then someone hit me. I saw the butt of an Enfield rifle come out of the smoke...and that was it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Darcy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was with me. I was going to bring her to meet you at the far field...I was disoriented, tried to figure out which way I was going...I\u2019m seeing black spots, Matt. I thought my whole skull was crushed.\u201d</p><p>Matt turned back to Lavinia, drawing his phone from the his torically incorrect pocket in his captain\u2019s coat. He threw the phone to her.</p> <p>\u201cGet help. And stay with Clint!\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cMatt, you don\u2019t understand, I need to come with you\u2014\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cGet off the horse and stay with Clint!\u201d he commanded.</p><p>Lavinia went white. Matt leapt back on Vernon, and kneed the horse, the feeling of urgency now tearing into him. And the voice...</p><p>This way, hurry, this way, ride hard, hurry....</p><p>Carter held Darcy\u2019s ankle and was crawling forward with a deadly urgency, using her legs as a line to come closer.</p> <p>Darcy kicked out furiously, trying to loosen his grasp.</p><p>\u201cKilling me isn\u2019t going to help you!\u201d she cried out. \u201cDon\u2019t you see, they\u2019ll know, they\u2019ll all know!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going over the bridge, Darcy. You\u2019ll have fallen. Everyone knows you\u2019re accident prone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Carter! They\u2019ll find the bones. They\u2019ll identify the body, don\u2019t you see, it\u2019s over! Carter, I don\u2019t know what she knew, or what she saw, or what she wrote that so incensed you...but it didn\u2019t matter, did it? You\u2019d already decided you were going to kill her. Who was she? The woman you supposedly loved so much?\u201d</p><p>His eye was already beginning to swell. He looked horrible. Blood matted his beard; she had managed a few good strikes.</p><p>But his hands still had a strength like steel in them.</p><p>\u201cCarter! I\u2019ve scratched you. Your flesh is beneath my nails.\u201d</p><p>His hand moved; he got a solid grip on her calf, his face taut, muscles clenched, jaw in a grim and lethal line.</p> <p>\u201cThe skeleton in the smokehouse, Darcy? She was Susan Howell. And what was she writing? She was going to tell Matt that I\u2019d been having an affair with his wife\u2014and more, of course. She was going to suggest that he look into my past. There were a few before her, you see. Catherine Angsley. Catherine didn\u2019t have to die, but she had loaned me some money, and then the little bitch got all furious and wanted it back when I didn\u2019t have it. But they\u2019ll never find her. She\u2019s deep in the Blue Ridge. They\u2019ll never find the others, either. I never should have brought any of them to Melody House, but you see, the old man had died, Matt was busy with his work and the fact that his marriage was falling apart...and that night, there was no one at Melody House. No one. Susan had gone there because I\u2019d taken her there before, and because she wanted to feel that she had a right to be in the house. She was really not a nice person, Darcy. And you know, she was buried in that smokehouse for years...years! No one would have found her. But now, you have.\u201d</p><p>He got a fierce hold on her thigh. She struggled to sit, nails clawing at his flesh. He roared like a wounded animal, but didn\u2019t let go. Holding on to her despite the violence of her fight, he dragged himself to his feet, still clutching her. Dragging her.</p><p>\u201cCarter, you\u2019re ill! You need help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBull!\u201d He went still for a minute, ready to laugh despite the circumstances. \u201cI knew what I was doing every step of the way. There\u2019s nothing wrong with me. Hell, I have a mind and a will of steel. No one has ever so much as suspected me.\u201d</p><p>He had her against the rail. He tried to lift her but she fought too hard. Still, he had stamina. Little by little, he was pressing her back. Darcy could hear the water rushing over the boulders and stones below. Far below.</p><p>\u201cJosh! Help me!\u201d she cried out.</p><p>It gave him a start. He paused, if only for a second, looking around.</p><p>\u201cWho the hell is Josh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA ghost.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA ghost! You\u2019re calling on a ghost? Shit, Darcy!\u201d He laughed again, maintaining his hold. She struggled, getting a grip on his beard, pulling hard. He reached down to his calf, pressing his body against hers so that he didn\u2019t lose his hold. A second later, he\u2019d drawn a Bowie knife from the sheath at his ankle and pressed it against her throat.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going over, Darcy,\u201d he said flatly.</p><p>A blade in her throat...or boulders crushing her bones. Not much of a choice. But she could no longer fight him, not with the knife pressing into her flesh.</p><p>\u201cCarter!\u201d</p><p>The harsh cry, coming from the trail before the bridge, startled them both.</p><p>Matt burst out of the mist, drawing Vernon to a halt right at the foot of the bridge, just feet away.</p><p>\u201cCarter, let her go. Now.\u201d</p><p>Carter was dead still for several seconds. Then a feral smile twisted his lips.</p><p>\u201cCome make me, Matt. Be careful, though. You know how good these Bowie knives are. I can slit her jugular in less than a second.\u201d</p><p>His eyes never leaving Carter\u2019s, Matt dismounted from Vernon and strode firmly toward the bridge.</p><p>\u201cStop there, or she\u2019s a gusher, I promise,\u201d Carter said.</p><p>Matt stood motionless, aware of the knife at Darcy\u2019s throat. He didn\u2019t look at her, though. He kept his eye contact on Carter.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s over, Carter. The FBI is looking for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey may be looking for me, Matt. But they won\u2019t find me. Hey, we both know this place. Get into the mountains...and we can disappear for good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarter, if you let Darcy go now, we can work something out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so, Matt. Actually, this is rather amusing. There you are, the great Sheriff Stone. The Stone of Stoneyville. Negotiation, yep, that\u2019s one talent you really pride yourself with having. Talk, stall, talk, stall. And imagine, all this going on beneath your nose, and you didn\u2019t know! You know, once you kill, you figure out that\u2019s it\u2019s really pretty easy. Especially when you get involved with the right people. Women looking for something they can\u2019t have. Like the right guy, true love, support and warmth and all that crap. Pretty ones, of course. Only problem is, sometimes, when you think it just might be a go, they turn out to be bitches, all judgmental, not really what they pretend to be at all. I\u2019m no maniac, Matt.\u201d</p><p>Matt put his hands on his hips. \u201cSo what, then? Carter? You\u2019re going to kill Darcy in front of me? You make another move, and you\u2019re a dead man as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow you going to manage that, Matt? You\u2019ve got a rifle there, but hell, no shot. You\u2019re a reenactor today. No real bullets\u2014on anyone. Too much of a danger to the crowd.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll kill you with my bare hands, Carter,\u201d Matt said with low but vehement sincerity. \u201cI swear it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo...we all die. Here and now,\u201d Carter said.</p><p>\u201cCarter!\u201d</p><p>The cry came from a woman. Darcy could barely move her head; she could almost taste the steel at her throat, but she strained to see past Matt and was amazed to see Lavinia come running down the trail. Her beautiful violet eyes were huge; her usually perfect hair had escaped its Civil War coils and was a tangle around her face.</p><p>\u201cCarter!\u201d she tried again, gasping too hard to speak more.</p><p>\u201cDid you know that we had a hot and heavy affair, Matt?\u201d Carter said casually. \u201cFor once, I bested the great sheriff! It was actually hard not to let you know, but then again, I loved the ease of hanging around Melody House.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t give a damn if you slept with Lavinia, Carter.\u201d</p><p>Carter smiled, looking past Matt at Lavinia. \u201cDid you come to help me, sweetheart? Have you got a gun on you? If so, just go ahead and shoot the sucker.\u201d</p><p>That, at last, drew Matt\u2019s eyes from Carter. He stared at Lavinia in amazement and horror. Had she been in on it? Had she become so involved with Carter that she had actually been his accomplice in murder?</p><p>And did she have a gun, secreted away in her voluminous skirts?</p><p>Lavinia found her voice at last. \u201cCarter, for the love of God, let her go!\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cLavinia, you\u2019ve turned pansy on me. Didn\u2019t you want a wild life of reckless adventure, far more than the sheriff intended to give you, no matter what his pedigree?\u201d</p><p>Darcy could feel the blade, chafing into her flesh. She felt a thin trickle of blood drip down her neck.</p><p>\u201cCarter, let her go,\u201d Matt said. \u201cI swear, if you do, you\u2019ll get a trial with the best lawyers. If you hurt her in any way, I\u2019ll rip your throat out with my bare hands, I swear it.\u201d</p><p>Darcy felt his hand jerk. The blade cut more deeply. She was certain that she was dead. Matt would avenge her, of that she was certain, too.</p><p>But she would be dead already. A new ghost to haunt the realm of Melody House.</p><p>It was then that the white mist reappeared. It seemed to form at the base of the bridge, between Matt\u2019s position and the place where Carter had her back arched over the bridge.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Susan!\u201d she cried, \u201cCarter, she\u2019s here! It\u2019s Susan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBull\u2014!\u201d he began. But his eyes widened suddenly. Darcy didn\u2019t know what anyone else saw; she wasn\u2019t certain what she saw herself. But the mist moved, and Carter froze, as if paralyzed with disbelief and horror.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Susan, and she\u2019s come to avenge her own death!\u201d Darcy breathed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Carter jerked, his grip barely slackening.</p><p>Matt chose that moment to lunge across the few feet separating them, and tackle Carter.</p><p>The impetus of his force, knocking Carter flat, and sending the knife flying, also sent Darcy flying. Her body twisted. Face forward, she went more than halfway over the railing. Grasping madly, she got a handhold on a support beam, just before the bulk of her body slipped. She held on desperately, aware of the rushing sound of water beneath her.</p><p>She heard the brutality of the fight going on above her, but she could only pray that Matt was winning. She was losing her grip.</p> <p>\u201cJosh!\u201d she whispered softly.</p><p>She felt warmth, and knew he was there. Felt as if some of the weight was eased from her hands. And still...</p><p>\u201cDarcy!\u201d</p><p>Lavinia was looking over the railing at her, then lay flat on the ground, seizing hold of her hands through the rails. \u201cI can\u2019t...I can\u2019t...get you up!\u201d Lavinia cried with dismay. \u201cI\u2019m going to lose you.\u201d</p><p>Darcy felt her hands slipping. She saw Lavinia\u2019s fingers, losing their grip.</p> <p>She smiled at the woman so feverishly trying to save her. \u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d she said softly. \u201cIt\u2019s all right....\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t all right. She didn\u2019t want to die. Even if she did know that there was an afterlife, that Josh would be there.</p><p>\u201cLavinia, hold on, hold on a moment longer.\u201d</p><p>Matt. He straddled the railing, balancing precariously himself. He reached down, catching hold of her arms above the wrists, and he squared his shoulders, and pulled. She cried out, the pain in her arms threatening dislocation.</p><p>But she was hiked over the railing. They fell to the bridge together. Gasping, she opened her eyes to see his. They both stared blankly at one another, hearing the sounds of Lavinia, as she sobbed with relief. She saw Carter\u2019s body, prone, just feet away.</p><p>\u201cIs he...dead?\u201d Darcy managed to whisper.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t kill him,\u201d Matt said. \u201cCome on, Darcy, let me get you up.\u201d He came to his feet, muddied, his uniform torn and battered, his face bruised. He reached a hand down to her, drawing her up close to him.</p><p>A sudden roar proved the truth of the fact that he hadn\u2019t killed Carter. The man was up; he had apparently been gathering his strength for one last surge of fury.</p><p>\u201cMove!\u201d</p><p>Matt shoved Darcy, and she went ricocheting along the bridge. He ducked himself as Carter raced forward, his knife in his hand once again.</p><p>But Darcy was gone, and Matt\u2019s sudden movement tripped up Carter, sending him flying against the bridge railing. He teetered precariously.</p><p>The white mist appeared again.</p><p>Carter let out a cry of horror. Surrounded by the mist, he went over.</p><p>They heard of the sound of his last terrified, strangled scream. And then the sound of his body, hitting the rocks below.</p> <p>The reenactment that late June day would be remembered for the events that followed as much as for the battle itself.</p><p>Darcy\u2019s first concern, after they had looked over the bridge and ascertained that Carter was, indeed, dead, had been Oola. The dog had tried to defend her, and Darcy was afraid that Carter had given her a blow that had killed her. But when they found the dog against one of the ornamental pillars on the other side of the bridge, she was still breathing. Adam, following behind Matt and Lavinia, had arrived them, with a host of officers behind him, and so, Oola had been quickly rushed to the vet. Thayer had called to say that the dog had suffered a concussion, but would be all right.</p><p>Agents from the FBI, as well as local and state police, scoured the area. Darcy found herself questioned for hours, since her honest answers seemed to dumbfound many people.</p><p>Luckily, Randy Newton was in charge of the investigation from the government\u2019s side, and he, at last, said that they had enough information from her, there was nothing more she could explain to them on how she had first discovered the skeleton in the smokehouse.</p><p>It was an interesting investigation, Randy told her, somewhat amused. They had a confessed killer, but he was dead, so the only people who had heard his confession were her, Matt, and Lavinia.</p><p>Darcy deeply pitied Lavinia that day, because she had to explain that years ago, she had thought little of it when he had told her that Susan Howell would no longer be in his life. When her marriage to Matt had been fraying, she admitted, she\u2019d thought an affair with Carter would be revenge against Matt, a foolish thing, and she thought that she and Carter had both tacitly agreed that they would never speak about it.</p><p>But when she had talked to Matt, and read about Darcy discovering the bones in the smokehouse, she had felt a terrible urge to come down, a feeling of dread that something just might have happened years before, something she hadn\u2019t even begun to fathom until she had returned to Melody House. When Carter had pretended that he wanted Lavinia to be with Darcy at the reenactment, something inside Lavinia had triggered suspicion, and she had realized that it was time to talk to Matt about Carter. She had stayed with Clint until one of the officers had arrived and an ambulance had been called, and then left, still anxious that she might still somehow prevent tragedy. Clint would be in the hospital for several days. He had suffered a concussion.</p><p>It was late when Adam, Penny, Lavinia, Matt, and Darcy returned to Melody House. Later still when they had all showered and changed, and come down to the kitchen to scrounge through the refrigerator for something to eat.</p><p>\u201cMatt, your friend thinks I\u2019m guilty of something,\u201d Lavinia said wearily.</p><p>\u201cLavinia, you\u2019re not guilty of anything when you assume that someone just broke something off with another person,\u201d he assured her.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s so scary. I can\u2019t even imagine. We all...we were all his friends. And more,\u201d she said sheepishly. \u201cAnd all these years...he killed when it was convenient. Hid the bodies\u2014and got away with it.\u201d Lavinia shivered. \u201cTo think...never mind, I don\u2019t want to go there. But I didn\u2019t know\u2014I really didn\u2019t even suspect, way back then, that Carter could be...crazy. And yet, when you called me, I had to come here.\u201d</p><p>Matt grinned at her. \u201cLavinia, it\u2019s all right. You\u2019re a good friend. You came here, and you followed your instincts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone has a certain amount of instinct, Lavinia. A touch of something deeper in the mind. It doesn\u2019t suggest that you might have known anything all those years ago. It just means that you have greater mental powers than you imagined,\u201d Adam told her.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d she said, and shivered. \u201cDid I do any good? No! And I saw the way you looked at me, Matt Stone. You actually thought that I might have been his accomplice in murder, when he made that ridiculous statement to me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly for a second of sheer panic,\u201d Matt admitted.</p><p>\u201cYou did a lot of good, Lavinia,\u201d Darcy told her. \u201cI don\u2019t think I would have made it until Matt came if you didn\u2019t help me,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cSee there, Lavinia?\u201d Penny added.</p><p>Lavinia shivered again. \u201cGreater powers....\u201d She stared at Matt, then at Darcy. \u201cWhat did happen at the end?\u201d she asked. \u201cCarter rose...and looked like a raging bull. Then he was teetering on the bridge, and I could have sworn...I can\u2019t say it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could have sworn that a ghost knocked him over?\u201d Darcy asked.</p><p>Lavinia\u2019s huge violet eyes fell on hers. \u201cYes,\u201d she said quietly.</p><p>\u201cCarter lost his balance, and went over,\u201d Matt said.</p><p>\u201cBut, Matt...\u201d Lavinia began.</p><p>\u201cWhen I told my story to the FBI, that\u2019s exactly what I told them,\u201d Matt said firmly. The house phone began to ring. \u201cExcuse me,\u201d he said, walking out of the kitchen. \u201cHey, Penny, we\u2019ve got all kinds of stuff to go in eggs. How about omelettes?\u201d</p><p>Darcy smiled at Lavinia. \u201cI think that Susan Howell did make a return, Lavinia. She was the lady in white people kept seeing in Melody House. Because she was in a long flowing gown, everyone\u2014including me\u2014assumed that she had to be a victim of traumatic death from centuries ago. I think she faded away on me, too, every time Carter was around. He stalked me from the time I first came here. And she was still afraid of him. Even in death, she was afraid of him. But, today, when she had her chance, she helped us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think Matt really believes that?\u201d Lavinia said.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Darcy said. She smiled at Adam. \u201cBut I think it\u2019s what really happened.\u201d</p><p>Matt came back into the kitchen. \u201cThey\u2019ve recovered some of Susan Howell\u2019s bones. Carter had scattered them in the water. They were in the stream, near the bridge. They\u2019re still missing a few, but they\u2019ll find them. And hopefully, they\u2019ll find the other bodies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, Matt,\u201d Penny murmured, \u201cyou were right, in a way, being convinced that the things going on here were being committed by someone alive and well.\u201d She stared at him. \u201cBut there are ghosts, you know.\u201d She gave her attention back to the omelettes. As the rest of them moved around the kitchen, getting plates, drinks, silverware and napkins, they continued to talk about Carter. Shock, Darcy assumed. Every time she thought about it herself, the fact that so many people had seen him as such an entirely normal human being for so long, she felt goose bumps rise on her flesh.</p><p>\u201cWith Susan Howell, it must have been easy,\u201d Matt said as they ate. \u201cMy grandfather had just died. Lavinia and I were falling apart. Penny wasn\u2019t living in the house yet. It was frequently empty. And he probably brought Susan there often. She probably really thought that he was going to marry her, and she\u2019d be part of the group that stayed on the property whenever they chose. And yet, that night, Carter would have known that he was alone. Maybe he thought that the smokehouse would cover the fumes when the body started to decay. Or perhaps he thought that he\u2019d buried her so deeply, she\u2019d never be found anyway. It\u2019s impossible to know now.\u201d</p><p>They talked late, over coffee, brandy, and dessert. Darcy felt Adam\u2019s eyes on her, and looked at him, and knew that though the situation was sad, he was proud of her for her abilities to touch what others could not. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She frowned suddenly.</p><p>\u201cAdam, why were you so anxious that we come here?\u201d Darcy asked him. \u201cIt was as if you knew that there was something going on here...but you hadn\u2019t been here in years, either.\u201d</p><p>Adam hesitated, then looked at Matt. \u201cMy actual gift isn\u2019t like Darcy\u2019s,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cBut I knew that such gifts existed, I\u2019d seen them far too many times to ignore them. I have the ability to discover and channel such gifts. In fact,\u201d he admitted, smiling ruefully at Darcy, \u201cone of my greatest heartbreaks has been the fact that although I know there is something beyond, and that so many of those powers are locked in our minds, I cannot touch my own son, while he and Darcy...sometimes it seems that they can converse as if Josh were still alive. But right before I sent you that letter, Matt, I had a dream about your grandfather. We were playing chess on the porch, just as we had done so many times, and he was talking about the house, telling me that it had been wronged. And as we were talking...a woman drifted by me. In mist. And I asked your grandfather if he had seen her, and he told me that so much that was so wrong had occurred there, and that she needed help. The house needed help, and so did you, Matt. Anyway, when I awoke, I felt as if I had really talked to him again, and I knew that something was going on here. I didn\u2019t, of course, know that it was a recent tragedy that had occurred, I just knew that I had been summoned.\u201d He looked back at Darcy. \u201cThe business I had in London could have been put off, actually, has been put off. But I wanted you to come here first. I wanted your impressions. Then, it seemed as if Matt just might be right, too, what with the things going on, and so, I was worried about bringing you here. That\u2019s why I decided you needed a dog, because the dog would always know when a living being was causing the trouble.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOola did run after Carter, growling and snarling. And that\u2019s why he hurt her. She gave me warning, Adam. She\u2019s wonderful, and I love her,\u201d Darcy said. She smiled then. \u201cAnd you had a dream, huh? And you talked to your old friend in it.\u201d</p><p>Adam flushed. \u201cI don\u2019t think that I have what you have, Darcy. Not at all. But it\u2019s good to know that my instincts kick in as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is terrible,\u201d Penny said. \u201cI don\u2019t think I can sleep a wink, but I\u2019m exhausted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not going back out to that caretaker\u2019s cottage by myself, not tonight,\u201d Lavinia said firmly.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry\u2014we\u2019ve plenty of room in the house.\u201d</p> <p>Matt smiled, looking at Darcy. \u201cThe Lee Room is available.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will not be sleeping in the Lee Room!\u201d Lavinia said indignantly, and they all smiled.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re really uneasy tonight, you can bunk in with me,\u201d Penny told her.</p><p>\u201cI may just be doing that,\u201d Lavinia said.</p><p>\u201cMaybe we should all try to get some sleep,\u201d Matt said. \u201cLet\u2019s pack up, and call it a night.\u201d</p><p>Darcy had insisted earlier that she was fine, but now every bone in her body seemed to hurt. Matt looked a little rough around the edges as well, but he jumped into a brief shower himself, and when he came out, Darcy discovered that he\u2019d filled the tub for her with hot water and an aloe and oil bath that was guaranteed to ease sore muscles and be kind to tender, scraped, and bruised flesh. Darcy sank into the tub, troubling over one thought that had nagged at her during the day.</p> <p>Josh.</p><p>He had been with her....</p><p>And he had disappeared. She couldn\u2019t understand why he would have left her under such circumstances.</p><p>\u201cHave I lost you?\u201d she whispered out loud.</p><p>She didn\u2019t get a reply. Then she smiled. Josh had always been so polite. He didn\u2019t make an appearance when she was in a shower or bath, or changing clothing.</p><p>She rose and slipped into one of the massive Melody House robes. Exiting the bathroom, she found that Matt wasn\u2019t in his bedroom, or his office.</p><p>He had walked outside, and was standing on the balcony.</p><p>She thought that this must all be very hard on him. Carter had been a friend for years. Matt had allowed Carter free access to his holdings. Carter had used his house to commit murder.</p> <p>She walked out on the balcony, slipping her arms around him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all solved now, isn\u2019t it?\u201d he said, \u201cor at least on its way to being all solved.\u201d He caught her chin and tilted it upward. \u201cYou were planning on leaving, weren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>She gazed into his eyes and flushed. \u201cBeing with you is incredible, but...I can\u2019t change what I am, Matt. If I wanted to, I couldn\u2019t. I tried at first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe psychic and the small-town sheriff,\u201d he murmured. \u201cHm. It could work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMatt, I\u2019m here now. We weathered a lot together. But...I can\u2019t change what I am. And being what I am, I love working for Adam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can make it,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>\u201cYou say that now, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not the only one who says it,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d She arched a brow to him. \u201cDid...Lavinia suggest that I was right for you? Or Adam?\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cLavinia did prove that she is, at heart, decent. Quite decent. But, no, I\u2019d never trust her suggestions as to my relationships. And Adam, well, of course, I have tremendous respect for him, but no, Adam hasn\u2019t said a word to me. He probably figures this is something we have to work out ourselves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan it be worked out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDarcy, you were the last thing I wanted when you walked into the Wayside Inn that day. But you\u2019re the only thing I know I want for the rest of my life. I love you. Everything about you. And I think that you love me, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she whispered. \u201cBut, Matt, you don\u2019t believe in the possibility, even, that there can be something outside of logic and reason and scientific explanation. How could we survive, with our thoughts being so entirely different?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I\u2019ve changed. And I know we can make it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right\u2014who exactly told you that we can make it, and how have you changed?\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cJosh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJosh!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been lying, Darcy. To myself, as well as you. Today, I knew it. The first time I suspected it was the day you fell through the boards at the library. I was on my way to lunch\u2014then somehow I was on my way to the library. Today...I was having a good time. A really good time. It\u2019s fun for us to play soldier\u2014we don\u2019t really have to lose, and soldiers don\u2019t really die. Then Randy Newton called me with the information about missing persons last seen in this area. When he gave me names and I knew them as girls Carter had dated, I had to find you. Right away. I had no idea where you might have gone. But there was a voice in my head guiding me. And I followed it.\u201d</p><p>He smoothed her hair back, cupping her head, bending down to kiss her lips very lightly.</p><p>\u201cWhatever it takes, I know we can make it. Trust me. Josh told me so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know it\u2019s Josh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause we just had a great little talk out here, man to man, on the balcony.\u201d</p><p>She cocked her head, looking at him doubtfully. \u201cWhere is he now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, for the evening. He said that he never hangs around to intrude on your private life.\u201d</p><p>Darcy inhaled sharply. She eyed him, still skeptical.</p><p>\u201cHowever,\u201d Matt continued, \u201che\u2019s promised that he will attend the wedding. In fact, he said that he\u2019d best be the first one invited.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur wedding, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019ll have me, of course.\u201d</p><p>She was silent for a minute, her blood racing through her veins, pounding to her mind. Could it really work? Could she really have this man, forever? And could it be that he really accepted her for all that she was, and had he really learned that the world went beyond all that could be seen by the naked eye?</p><p>\u201cI love you, Darcy. And I\u2019ll be there for you. Always. I\u2019ll never doubt you, ever again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, absolutely. I\u2019ll marry you. Anytime, anywhere. As long as Josh is invited of course.\u201d</p><p>He swept her up, and carried her back inside. And despite bruises and scratches and what should have been sore muscles, they indulged in the most sensual and passionate hours Darcy had ever experienced.</p><p>It was later, much, much later, when Matt slept himself and Darcy tiptoed out on the balcony.</p><p>She smiled, hugging her robe to her.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Josh,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>And there, on the balcony, she felt his warmth surround her.</p><p>And life, she knew, was very, very good. </p> </body></html>"]
