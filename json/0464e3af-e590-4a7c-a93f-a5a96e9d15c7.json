They succeeded, but at a terrible cost, both races forced to mortgage the bulk of their power. All but one Therian from each of the ancient lines lost the strength of their animals and the ability to shift. Only nine shape-shifters remain.</p><p>They are the Feral Warriors.</p><p>Their duty is to protect the race, to hunt and destroy the dangerous, mindless, Daemon dregs called draden. And, most importantly, to guard the Daemon blade, in which Satanan and his horde are imprisoned, for the Daemons\u2019 return would bring hell to the races of the Earth.</p> <p>The Feral Warriors were in a world of hurt.</p><p>Tighe lifted his face to the night wind, trying to cool the frustration lodged beneath the surface of his skin as he traversed the rugged, rocky woods high above the Potomac River.</p><p>The Mage had lost their freaking minds and were apparently trying to free the Daemons. After sacrificing so much five millennia ago to imprison them, Tighe couldn\u2019t fathom why, but there was no denying at least one Mage, the witch Zaphene, had been determined to free Satanan. Zaphene was dead, but she\u2019d left a hell of a legacy.</p><p>One of the Ferals, Vhyper, was missing. The Daemon blade itself was gone. And one of Zaphene\u2019s creations had run off with half of Tighe\u2019s soul. Literally.</p><p>Where the Mage witch had come by the magic to split souls, no one knew, but she\u2019d done so to make clones of the Ferals. Clones who would raise the Daemons from the blade in the real Ferals\u2019 stead, since the real Ferals weren\u2019t stupid enough to want that plague freed again. What were the Mage thinking?</p> <p>A growl rumbled deep in his throat as he climbed the last of the stone outcroppings onto the cliffs above the river. The night was clear, the brightest stars little more than a dull glow, thanks to the damned humans and their incessant need to battle back the dark.</p><p>His clone was, by all indications, currently wreaking havoc on the human population. Tighe and two other Ferals had been tracking him for three days as he\u2019d left a path of dead between Great Falls, Virginia, and nearby Washington, D.C.</p><p>And while, yes, the clone\u2019s deadly rampage needed to be stopped, Tighe\u2019s stake in his capture was a lot more personal. He needed his damned soul back. No one knew for sure how long he could survive with it split like it was, but the consensus was, not long. At least not with his sanity intact.</p><p>Dammit.</p><p>Which was why he returned to Great Falls and Feral House each night instead of remaining on the trail of his clone. He\u2019d seen what could happen to a Feral with a split soul, and it wasn\u2019t pretty. Hell, it gave him nightmares. He was determined to hold on to his sanity, even if every Feral watched him as if he expected to have to lock Tighe up in the prison deep below Feral House at any moment.</p><p>Wulfe stepped onto the rock beside him. \u201cAny sign of draden?\u201d Wulfe was the biggest of the Ferals, a monster of a man close to seven feet tall, with a face that looked like it had once been used as a cat\u2019s scratching post.</p> <p>Tighe released his frustration on a huff. \u201cNot yet. They\u2019ll come.\u201d Then he\u2019d rip their hearts out, as he did every night, and release some of this gut-eating frustration. Enough to feel relatively safe returning to the hunt for his clone in human-infested D.C.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m surprised Lyon let us take you out without a leash,\u201d Jag drawled behind him.</p><p>A growl rumbled in Tighe\u2019s chest. The idiot wasn\u2019t satisfied until he had every Feral ready to rip his throat out. And Tighe was in a foul enough mood to accommodate him.</p><p>\u201cShut up, Jag,\u201d Wulfe snarled. \u201cThe last thing he needs right now is your needling.\u201d</p><p>The last thing he needed was everyone treating him like he was filled with gunpowder, a lit fuse dangling from the corner of his mouth. He was fine.</p><p>But the burn in his fingertips gave the lie to that little assertion. He struggled for control, struggled to pull back from the feral rage engulfing him. Under normal circumstances the feral state was merely a place of lost tempers and healthy fighting. The place halfway between man and beast, where human teeth elongated into fangs, claws erupted from fingertips, and human eyes no longer looked human. A place where a hawk and a tiger could access their wilder natures yet fight on equal footing.</p><p>But these were not normal circumstances. Thanks to the rending of his soul, he didn\u2019t know how much longer he\u2019d have the strength or control to pull himself out of that state again.</p><p>He fought against the fury engulfing his body, clenching his teeth even as he willed himself calm, but it was too late. Claws unsheathed from the tips of his fingers. Fangs dropped from the top of his jaw. Daggerlike incisors rose from below as a backload of dammed-up rage ripped free of his control. In a rush of feral anger, he lunged, tackling Jag to the rocky ground.</p> <p>In a haze of bloodlust, he felt the slash of claws and the ripping of flesh as Jag went feral, too. Blood spilled into his mouth, both his own and Jag\u2019s, tasting warm and fine. His vision hazed in a wild bloodlust that had him suddenly longing to sink his teeth into Jag\u2019s neck and rip out the bastard\u2019s throat for real.</p><p>His logical mind recoiled. He was losing it. He could almost see the dark, swirling waters of chaos lapping at his sanity. As his sane mind clawed its way back from the precipice, Wulfe wedged himself between the two warriors, jerking Jag out of his grasp.</p><p>Tighe slowly struggled back to his controlled, human, form. As his claws and fangs retracted, Wulfe balled up his fist and hit Jag in the jaw with a hard right hook.</p><p>Jag went sprawling. \u201cWhat\u2019d you do that for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can be such an ass,\u201d Wulfe snarled. \u201cDo you want to see him locked up? Now? Would it be too much to ask you to not hasten the destruction of one of our strongest warriors?\u201d</p><p>Jag scowled and pushed to his feet. \u201cFuck you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not heading for destruction,\u201d Tighe growled, standing and adjusting his ripped shirt so that it continued to hang, barely, from his body. He wouldn\u2019t let it happen. He refused to let it happen.</p><p>But he couldn\u2019t deny he was shaken.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s kill some draden, then,\u201d Wulfe said.</p><p>Tighe compressed his mouth and nodded. They hunted draden by waiting for the little fiends to smell their Therian energy, energy the Ferals emitted in their human forms. It wasn\u2019t much longer before a faint dark cloud appeared over the cliffs across the river.</p><p>\u201cIncoming,\u201d Wulfe said quietly. The draden had found them.</p><p>Wulfe yanked off his tee shirt and unzipped his jeans, tossing his clothes onto the rocks. Jag stripped out of his camouflage pants and army green tee. Tighe did nothing. He was one of the Ferals who possessed the ability to retain his clothes when he shifted. A handy trick, especially when he hunted among humans.</p><p>The dark cloud of draden moved quickly toward them over the gleaming river, a smudge against the stars and the shadowy distant cliffs. A huge smudge.</p><p>\u201cHoly shit.\u201d Jag whistled low. \u201cIs it just me, or is that five times the usual number?\u201d</p><p>There had to be hundreds coming at them. Maybe more than a thousand. Holy shit was right. They\u2019d known the draden were multiplying faster than usual, but the evidence was alarming. If they didn\u2019t get them under control, there wouldn\u2019t be enough Therian energy for them to feed on. They\u2019d turn on the humans.</p><p>And if that happened, they\u2019d decimate the population in no time, without the humans ever knowing what hit them.</p><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s get \u2019em, boys,\u201d Jag said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take first bait.\u201d Tighe pulled his knives. One of them had to remain in his human, or Therian form, or the draden would fly off. But as first bait, he would absolutely be fighting for his life.</p><p>In a sudden, heart-jarring instant, a veil of darkness dropped over his eyes, swallowing everything. Tighe\u2019s blood went cold.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t see. \u201cWhat the hell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d Wulfe asked beside him, as if nothing were wrong.</p><p>Shit. His pulse began to pound in his ears. This must only be happening to him. His vision was gone. Totally. Was this the first step to losing his sanity?</p><p>As quickly as his sight vanished, it reappeared, but his relief lifted and plummeted in the same instant. He wasn\u2019t actually seeing. Like a movie lighting a dark screen, a scene appeared before his sightless eyes.</p><p>A harsh, bright light lit a rough room, nothing but half a dozen washers and dryers on a cement floor. A public laundry room. Two heavyset women worked, one shoving wet laundry from the washer into the dryer, the other standing before a nearby table, folding clothes. The standing one glanced toward him, her expression at once appreciative and wary.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d she said cautiously.</p><p>Suddenly, her face grew in his vision as if a camera lens were pulling in close. Her eyes widened with terror as the room lurched dizzily. As if he\u2019d attacked her and taken her to the ground.</p><p>Was this a premonition, heaven help him, of what he was to become?</p><p>Behind him, the other woman screamed, piercing his eardrums.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d His victim threw up her hands, the terror in her eyes churning up rancid memories buried deep in his mind.</p><p>Memories of another time, another place.</p><p>His gut knotted until he thought he\u2019d be sick. But he couldn\u2019t deny the evidence. It seemed he was finally doomed to become the very thing he\u2019d been accused of being all those long, miserable years ago.</p><p>A monster.</p><p>FBI Agent Delaney Randall strode up the front walk of the Potomac Side Apartments in southwest D.C., her hand fisted tight around her notebook, her gut burning with a need to find the bastard who\u2019d killed more than a dozen women and children in the past three days.</p><p>To stop him before he killed again.</p><p>It was late, nearly 10:00 P.M. The last three murders had taken place in that general neighborhood, and she\u2019d spent all day canvassing the nearby apartments, interviewing residents, searching for clues. Someone had to know something. She was bone tired, but she wasn\u2019t quitting until her body refused to move another inch.</p><p>Not while the murderer was still on the loose.</p><p>And, unfortunately, that could be a while. Even with more than a dozen victims, there was no real evidence. So far, there had been no witnesses and no DNA left at the scenes despite the teeth marks on the victims\u2019 throats. Even the cause of the deaths was a mystery. It was as if God had pointed His divine finger at each of them, and said, \u201cTime\u2019s up.\u201d</p><p>The breeze blew loose tendrils of hair into her face as she strode up the front walk of the apartment building. A man in a polo and khakis walked toward her, the streetlight illuminating a nice-looking face. White male, late twenties, not visibly armed. Her brain clicked a mental picture, filing him away as yet one more suspect.</p><p>He flashed her a bleached smile. \u201cEvening.\u201d</p><p>But Delaney had already logged him, and her gaze had moved on to the pack of smoking teens sitting on the front steps ahead.</p><p>\u201cBitch.\u201d The muttered word carried to her from the man she\u2019d just passed.</p><p>Her gaze jerked back to him, her hand lifting to hover at her waist, a hairbreadth from her gun. But the man never looked back as he strode away purposefully.</p><p>Bitch, he called her. As if she had time to flirt when yet another scumbag was prowling the streets, hunting innocents. Moron.</p><p>She ran up the steps, past the teens, and tried the door. Locked, as she\u2019d suspected. Through the glass, she saw a balding African-American with tufts of gray hair over his ears running with an awkward gait toward her. The building\u2019s super, she supposed. She\u2019d called a short while ago and asked him to meet her here.</p><p>As he neared the doors, the mix of agitation and fear on his face became apparent. Her instinct for trouble kicked into high gear, her pulse speeding up, the fingers of her right hand flexing. Had she stumbled on a domestic situation in progress or finally hit the jackpot?</p><p>The instant the man opened the door, a keening cry high in the building raised the hairs on the back of her neck.</p><p>She flashed her badge and pushed through the doorway. \u201cAgent Randall, FBI. What happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI called the cops, but they aren\u2019t here yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Her gun was in her hand now, senses on high alert.</p><p>\u201cA lady dead in the stairwell. Her kid just found her.\u201d</p><p>Her kid. God.</p><p>\u201cHow? Who did it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t know. There\u2019s no blood.\u201d</p><p>Without waiting for further explanation, Delaney ran for the stairs in the middle of the building, following the sound of the crying.</p><p>But as she neared the third floor, the stairwell became so clogged with people she could hardly get through. She holstered her gun, and barked, \u201cFBI!\u201d The nearest residents parted for her to pass, eyeing her with varying degrees of curiosity, wariness, and relief.</p><p>Pushing through the crowd, she finally reached the source of the wailing. A little girl of no more than seven lay across the prone and lifeless body of a woman, the teeth marks that had become the trademark of the serial killer in a perfect oval on her neck.</p><p>Delaney\u2019s jaw clenched hard.</p><p>\u201cMomma!\u201d Tears streaked the child\u2019s brown cheeks, her dark eyes wells of fear as she rose to pat her mother\u2019s face. \u201cMomma.\u201d</p><p>Delaney\u2019s heart clenched as the child\u2019s fear flowed into her, echoing deep in her soul. She remembered that fear all too well. And hated, hated, the bastards who caused it. Thirteen people, now, that they knew of. Thirteen females. Seven of whom had left motherless children behind.</p><p>As she called in the murder, she pressed her palm to the top of the little girl\u2019s head. \u201cI\u2019m going to get him.\u201d The promise was too softly spoken for the child to hear, but the words imprinted themselves on Delaney\u2019s heart. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Death was part of life. She accepted that. Right or wrong, it was man\u2019s nature to fight and to kill. She understood deaths caused by war, even the misguided inner-city drug and gang wars. Wasteful as those deaths were, there was some testoster-one-laden male sense to them.</p><p>But there was no sense to attacks like this. None.</p><p>She\u2019d dedicated her life to stopping them. To stopping the evil that caused them. And this son of a bitch was at the top of her list.</p> <p>Through the babble of voices and crying, a fresh scream sliced the air, echoing up from the bowels of the building.</p><p>Delaney\u2019s blood went cold.</p><p>She pushed her way back into the crowd but had only managed to descend a couple of steps when an overweight blonde appeared at the bottom of the stairs.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s got my sister! He\u2019s got my sister!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d Delaney shouted.</p> <p>\u201cLaundry room,\u201d the woman cried. \u201cThe basement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m FBI. Get up here and stay here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got to save her. Save her!\u201d</p><p>As the woman dissolved into hysterics, Delaney scanned the crowd still standing between her and the blonde, then pointed at the two toughest-looking males. \u201cYou and you. Keep everyone back and send the cops down when they get here.\u201d</p><p>The pair nodded soberly and parted the crowd for her to pass.</p><p>By the time she pushed through the metal door into the basement, she was alone. No sound reached her ears except the dull thud of her boots on the cement floor.</p> <p>No screams. No crying. No woman begging for her life.</p><p>Delaney held her gun aloft, her heart thudding as she eased down the hall to the wide, brightly lit doorway. Pressing her back to the wall, she peered around the corner.</p><p>A huge, muscular man with short, sun-bleached hair looked up from where he knelt beside the prone and lifeless body of a woman who could have been the twin of the one who\u2019d sent her down.</p><p>She had him.</p><p>With both hands she lifted her gun. \u201cFreeze. FBI! Hands in the air!\u201d</p><p>The man rose with an ease that belied his size, staring at her, not with the eyes of the guilty but the cold eyes of a hunter spotting prey. Green eyes without humanity. Without mercy.</p><p>The eyes of Death himself.</p><p>A bead of sweat rolled between her shoulder blades. She was far from short, but this guy towered over her, his shoulders broad, his body lean and strong beneath the navy blue dress shirt and too-short khakis he wore without shoes. No way was she risking hand-to-hand combat.</p> <p>A chill slithered down her spine. \u201cHands in the air, or I shoot!\u201d</p><p>He moved so suddenly, so quickly, she barely got a shot off before he was on her, knocking her to the ground. Her head slammed against the cement as her gun went flying, jagged lights streaking her vision.</p><p>She\u2019d hit him in the chest. Point-blank. He should be going down, dammit. She tried to fight him, but he was as strong as a bear as he pinned her to the floor.</p><p>His head dipped. As she felt his cold mouth open on her neck and the press of his teeth into her skin, she struggled against her immovable assailant, a scream of fury filling her mind.</p><p>Too soon. Too soon. She\u2019d left too many killers walking the streets.</p><p>She didn\u2019t have time to die.</p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>Still deep in the vision, beneath the harsh, bright lights of the public laundry room, the sound of footsteps had Tighe looking up from the body of the dead blonde into the face of a stunning, dark-haired beauty. Dressed in a no-nonsense navy blue suit, the brunette was tall and leggy, her hair pulled into a casual knot at the back of her head, the gun in her hands pointed at his heart.</p><p>A strange sensation pummeled the inside of his chest as he stared into her fierce, determined face. A feeling of connection gripped him. Almost a recognition.</p><p>\u201cFreeze. FBI!\u201d she shouted at him. \u201cHands in the air!\u201d</p><p>He leaped at her as he had the other one. The gun fired, but if she hit him, he couldn\u2019t tell. He couldn\u2019t feel anything, could only hear the sound of her thudding heart and the slam of her head against the cement floor as he took her to the ground.</p><p>Their gazes met, and in the brown depths of her dazed eyes he saw not fear, but fury, and recognized the soul of a fellow warrior. Then he dipped his head to rip out her throat.</p><p>Tighe? Tighe!</p><p>He came back to the night in a rush, desperately swallowing the bile that tried to rise in his throat. Even as the stunning, dark-eyed beauty chiseled herself into his mind.</p><p>She can\u2019t die.</p><p>Tighe! Wulfe\u2019s voice echoed in his head at the exact moment fire slashed through his flesh like a thousand tiny knives ripping him out of his vision and back to his dark reality.</p><p>The horde of draden had found him.</p><p>Instinctively, he lifted his knives and began attacking the creatures, little more than floating gas beneath heads shaped like hideously melted human faces. They would steal his life if they got the chance. Beside him, his jaguar and wolf companions leaped and snapped at the attacking fiends.</p><p>Sweat rolled down his temples as the woman\u2019s face, those eyes, swam in his memory. Mistake. His gut fisted with horror over what he was destined to do even as the draden tore at his flesh. He fought them off, the blood running in small rivulets down his neck and back.</p><p>What would drive him to attack a human woman? Two women?</p><p>But he knew. That chaos he\u2019d seen swimming at the edges of his consciousness would overtake him before they found his clone, just as it had Wulfe before they\u2019d destroyed his clone. Like Wulfe before him, he was destined to become locked in a feral rage, lost to the violence that would transform him into an unthinking, unreasoning killing machine.</p><p>At least Wulfe had never gotten free of the Ferals\u2019 prison. He\u2019d never harmed anyone in that state.</p><p>\u201cWulfe, whatever you do, don\u2019t let me go feral and escape.\u201d</p><p>Not going to let it happen, buddy, Wulfe said mentally from his wolf form. Shift, Stripes. I\u2019m taking over as bait.</p><p>It\u2019s too soon.</p><p>The huge wolf turned into a man in a shower of sparkling lights. His friend looked at him grimly. \u201cDo it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn,\u201d Tighe muttered. He must look as bad as he felt. In a harsh rush of power, he pulled on the energy and magic deep in his body and shifted into his animal form, his vision a quick flash of light. Raw, primitive joy surged through him as he shifted into a fifteen-foot Bengal tiger.</p><p>The draden released him with a high-pitched squawk. Tighe went on the attack, scattering and destroying the little fiends alongside the jaguar. Wulfe, standing naked in the moonlight, came under attack from the ungodly throng, digging out their hearts as fast as he could, before they sucked the life force out of him or ripped him to shreds.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d Wulfe asked. Tighe didn\u2019t have to ask who he was talking to.</p><p>An answering growl was his only response.</p><p>I see the sire. The jaguar leaped, snapping his jaws around the largest of the draden, swallowing its beating heart to destroy it, dissolving the creature in a puff of smoky energy. The sire, or leader of the swarm, was the one who directed their flight. Kill the sire, and the rest would remain right where they were, lost and leaderless, making them easy marks for the animals, whom they couldn\u2019t feed from and wouldn\u2019t attack.</p><p>Wulfe shifted back into his animal and joined the slaughter of the disordered swarm.</p><p>Tighe caught one after another of the little demons in his massive jaws. Neither the hearts nor the creatures themselves had any real taste, for they weren\u2019t flesh and blood but made almost entirely of energy.</p><p>We\u2019ve got company. Jag\u2019s voice sounded in his head.</p><p>Tighe swung his massive tiger\u2019s head in the direction Jag was facing. Sure enough, two teenaged boys stood in the woods not twenty yards away, watching a sight that must be unbelievable to them. Humans couldn\u2019t see the draden, but they could sure as hell see the huge tiger, wolf, and jaguar.</p><p>Tighe gave a mental groan of frustration. Damn humans, always getting in the way. Fortunately for them, draden only attacked humans if there were no Therians for miles around. Still, the humans were a problem.</p><p>Jag, come with me, Tighe said. The two cats possessed the ability to change the size and, to some extent, the forms of their animals at will. While Wulfe continued to fight the draden in his wolf form, Tighe and Jag shifted into what most humans would see as house cats, then circled behind the two boys.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019d the tiger go?\u201d a youthful voice asked.</p><p>\u201cDude, is this for real? I thought it was the weed.\u201d</p><p>As Jag closed in on one, Tighe moved behind the other. As one, the two Ferals shifted into human form and rendered the youths briefly unconscious with a quick application of pressure beneath their ears.</p><p>As Tighe knew they would, the draden followed his and Jag\u2019s now-Therian scent. He pulled the switchblades from his pockets and tossed them to Jag, then knelt on the ground beside one of the boys. Wulfe joined them, and as the draden swarmed, the two Ferals, one man, one wolf, covered Tighe as he called on the ability all Ferals possessed to some extent, though his was undeniably the strongest.</p><p>Tighe gripped the face of his captive. \u201cOpen your eyes.\u201d When the boy did, Tighe looked deeply into those glazed irises. \u201cYou saw nothing in the woods tonight except a couple of dogs. When I tell you to, you\u2019ll go home and never venture into these woods at night again. And you\u2019ll flush the weed and swear off it for good, you little punk.\u201d</p><p>As the battle raged around him, Tighe rose and moved to the second kid, performing the same bit of mind control. When both boys\u2019 minds were successfully clouded, he told them to go, then shifted back into his animal and rejoined the fight.</p><p>Hours later, they were still destroying draden when the nocturnal fiends began to take off as they always did an hour before sunrise. In all that time, the Ferals had only managed to destroy half the swarm.</p><p>\u201cThis is bad,\u201d Wulfe muttered, shifting back into human form and grabbing his clothes.</p><p>Tighe couldn\u2019t deny it.</p><p>As they headed for home, Wulfe turned to him. \u201cWhat happened to you as they descended, Stripes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about it.\u201d But he was going to have to tell Lyon.</p><p>Goddess forbid he get loose and become that...thing.</p><p>\u201cBleed,\u201d Lyon said, striding forward as Tighe walked into the dining room of Feral House a short while later.</p><p>Tighe glowered at the Chief of the Feral Warriors, but thrust out his left hand, palm up. Lyon made a short, shallow cut in the center of Tighe\u2019s palm, nodding when the slice welled with blood as his clone\u2019s would not have.</p><p>The thought that the draden-based fiend that wore his face could sneak into Feral House gave him chills.</p><p>Though it annoyed him to have to submit to someone\u2019s knife every time he walked into a room, the alternative was worse. Much worse. The clone could potentially kill one of the Ferals. Or Kara, Lyon\u2019s mate and their Radiant. No one was willing to take that chance.</p><p>But knowing what he was to become, he feared the clone might no longer be the greatest danger.</p><p>Lyon closed his switchblade and greeted Tighe properly, offering his right arm. The two men slapped forearms as they grasped one another just below the elbow in the traditional greeting of the Ferals.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to have to lock me up, Roar.\u201d</p><p>Lyon\u2019s gaze narrowed. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>He told him about the premonition. \u201cI\u2019m not going to turn into that monster. And I will if you don\u2019t lock me up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will if we don\u2019t catch that clone in time.\u201d Lyon\u2019s amber gaze bored into his. \u201cBut we will, Stripes. We\u2019re going to catch him. With your help.\u201d He clasped Tighe\u2019s shoulder. \u201cWe\u2019re spread too thin right now to give you a vacation in the prisons.\u201d</p><p>Tighe growled. \u201cVacation my ass.\u201d</p><p>Kara entered the dining room and joined them, her pert, blond ponytail swinging as she slipped her arm around the waist of her much larger mate. As Lyon pulled her tight against him, she met Tighe\u2019s gaze, a sweet smile lighting her blue eyes.</p><p>\u201cHi, Tighe.\u201d</p><p>His own ready smile slid into place with an ease born of deep affection for this slip of a woman who\u2019d shown more strength in the past days than all the Radiants who\u2019d come before her over the centuries, combined.</p><p>\u201cHi, yourself.\u201d Tighe held out his arms to her, pleased when Lyon released her, and she gave him a quick, badly needed hug. He closed his arms around her and held her tight, absorbing the closeness as much as her sweetness.</p><p>At any given time, there was one Radiant, one Therian woman through whom the Ferals reached the great stores of nature\u2019s energy and the power they needed in order to shift into their animals. They\u2019d nearly missed finding Kara. She\u2019d been raised human, thousands of miles away. Their energy had been flagging, their ability to shift gone when Lyon finally managed to locate her. And thank the goddess he had. They\u2019d never have defeated the witch Zaphene without Kara\u2019s power, courage, and surprising talent with radiance.</p><p>He tightened his hold on her. Lyon was a lucky man to have been chosen her mate, an honor Tighe had secretly hoped would go to him. Kara was a sweet Therian beauty, as kind as she was courageous.</p><p>No man could do better.</p><p>As he looked down at her, his eyes began to tingle as they did whenever he was about to go feral. Or when he was in the presence of a beautiful woman.</p><p>He alone among the Ferals had that little problem. For the others, feral was feral. The eyes, the claws, the fangs came as a package deal. Not so, Tighe. His claws and fangs only sprouted when he was ready to fight, but his eyes were another matter. If his body stirred with interest, his eyes shifted, the pupils growing until they blocked out the white, their color changing from their natural green to the golden orange of his tiger\u2019s.</p><p>It was a major nuisance, necessitating dark, wraparound sunglasses whenever he was in human public, day or night. Tiger eyes were damned hard to pass off as human. And the humans needed to think he was one of them. If there was one agreement between the immortal races, it was that the humans continue to believe they were alone. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Lyon growled. \u201cYour eyes.\u201d</p><p>Tighe shrugged and grinned at his chief. \u201cShe\u2019s a beautiful woman, Roar.\u201d He winked at Kara. \u201cDo you want me to put on the shades?\u201d</p><p>Kara\u2019s soft trill of laughter eased the craziness inside him. \u201cIt\u2019s not like I don\u2019t know why you wear sunglasses in the house.\u201d She pulled out of his embrace and returned to her mate, looping her arm around Lyon\u2019s waist. \u201cI\u2019m flattered, Tighe, and head over heels in love with my lion.\u201d She grinned. \u201cBut you know that.\u201d</p> <p>Tighe laughed. \u201cYeah, I noticed. Lucky bastard.\u201d</p><p>The growl that came from Lyon\u2019s throat held a note of hard satisfaction. \u201cYou need to get one of these for yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA mate? Hell no.\u201d He winked at Kara. \u201cNot unless I can have yours.\u201d</p><p>At the teasing words, Lyon tightened his hold.</p><p>Tighe shook his head. \u201cI never thought I\u2019d see you like this, Roar.\u201d The pleasure he felt that his friend had found his one true mate after all these centuries was bittersweet. Tighe remembered all too well how love could transform a man, clearing his vision and changing his world. And how it could destroy him.</p> <p>Lyon smiled, his gaze dropping to Kara\u2019s sweet face. \u201cSometimes you have to risk your heart.\u201d</p><p>Tighe prayed Lyon never felt the cutting pain from the other side of that double-edged blade.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s eat.\u201d Lyon turned Kara toward the large formal dining table that sat in front of the wall of windows looking onto sunlit woods.</p><p>Foxx, Paenther, and Wulfe were already seated, but as he approached the table, each rose and greeted him.</p><p>Foxx, who\u2019d only been with them a couple of years and was genuinely twenty-three, nodded to him, his shaggy red hair falling in his face. \u201cTighe.\u201d</p><p>As Foxx returned to his seat, Paenther, Lyon\u2019s second-in-command, grasped his arm, his intense black eyes boring into him. The warrior, three-quarters Native American, had the bronzed skin and black hair and eyes of his human ancestors. A tribal tattoo snaked up his neck, while across one eye slashed the claw marks that marked him as a Feral Warrior. Dressed head to toe in leather, vibrating with a fine rage long ago burned into his soul by the Mage, he was a man whom others gave a wide berth. Except those few who knew him well.</p> <p>Paenther, alone, never asked him how he was doing. But his friend\u2019s deep concern came through in the too-tight grip on his wrist and the length of time he held the greeting.</p><p>\u201cFind him,\u201d Paenther said, his voice low, but tight. \u201cI wish I could help.\u201d</p><p>Tighe shook his head. \u201cWe\u2019ll find the clone. You and Foxx find Vhyper and that blade. Of the two tasks, yours is by far the more important, B.P. If I die, another Feral will be marked. You won\u2019t be down a man.\u201d</p><p>That black gaze never wavered. \u201cYou\u2019re not expendable, Stripes. Find him. I won\u2019t lose you, too.\u201d</p><p>Tighe found his grin. \u201cThen I\u2019ll find him.\u201d The smile died as quickly as it was born, worry closing around his heart. \u201cI\u2019m doing my best, B.P.\u201d But he was seriously worried his best was going to be too damn little. And too damn late.</p><p>\u201cNews.\u201d Wulfe\u2019s deep voice echoed off the walls of the dining room.</p><p>Tighe turned to the newly installed flat-screen hanging on the wall behind him. And froze.</p><p>\u201cThe killer some are calling the D.C. Vampire struck again last night in southwest. Jeanine Tinnings was slain in the same mysterious manner as at least ten others in the past three days.\u201d In the middle of the screen was a photo of a laughing blond woman holding a chubby-cheeked toddler.</p> <p>The air left Tighe\u2019s lungs as if he\u2019d been sucker punched. He was staring at the face of the woman who\u2019d been folding the laundry, the first of the two women he\u2019d thought he\u2019d killed. Or would kill.</p><p>She was already dead.</p><p>The hard knot of dread slowly dissolved in his chest. He wasn\u2019t going to kill her.</p><p>Ah, shit. That meant there would be no saving the other one, either. The dark-haired FBI beauty with the warrior\u2019s eyes must already be dead, too.</p><p>Which meant...Chills rushed along the surface of his flesh. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a premonition,\u201d he said out loud.</p><p>Lyon\u2019s gaze swung to him. \u201cWhat wasn\u2019t a premonition?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw her die last night. Through the eyes of the killer. I thought I was seeing the future.\u201d</p><p>Paenther looked at him with surprise. \u201cYou\u2019re starting to see through your clone\u2019s eyes.\u201d</p><p>Tighe nodded slowly. \u201cAt least when he kills.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is the break we need.\u201d Lyon\u2019s eyes began to glitter. \u201cIf you can identify where a murder is taking place, we may finally have a way to catch that son of a bitch.\u201d</p><p>The crushing weight of the two deaths lifted from Tighe\u2019s shoulders, but the relief was slight. The women were still dead even if he hadn\u2019t been the one to kill them. And there was still a strong likelihood he\u2019d end up as crazed and deadly as he\u2019d feared. As Wulfe had. Little by little, he\u2019d lose control until he finally tumbled into a feral rage from which he couldn\u2019t escape.</p><p>Until then? It seemed he was doomed to watch the terror of the dying through the eyes of the one desecrating his soul.</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>As the sun rose over Washington, D.C., Tighe slammed open the door of the safe house and stormed inside, his fingers and teeth tingling with the need to go feral and rip something apart. Anything.</p><p>Frustration bled from his brain, down into every cell in his body.</p><p>They were getting nowhere. Nowhere.</p><p>\u201cEasy, Stripes,\u201d Hawke said behind him as he and Kougar followed him in the door. \u201cStay in your skin, buddy.\u201d</p><p>Tighe strode to the refrigerator of the small row house on Capitol Hill, grabbed a Budweiser, and drank it down with one long pull.</p><p>Once the residence of a Therian family, for years the house had served as a safe house for Therians caught too far from the enclaves at night. Nocturnal creatures, the draden only fed at night but were capable of passing through untreated glass to reach their Therian victims.</p><p>The glass of Therian homes and cars were treated with magic to keep them safe from draden penetration. Safe houses were scattered throughout the areas most often frequented by members of the race. Last he heard, there were nearly a dozen around the D.C. area in addition to the five actual enclaves.</p><p>This particular safe house was only four blocks from the apartment building where he\u2019d watched the dark-eyed beauty die yesterday morning. For twenty-four hours, the three Ferals had roamed the area, both in their human and animal forms, searching for the clone. In their animal forms, they should have been able to smell him, but they\u2019d gotten nothing. Worse than nothing.</p><p>Even the visions were useless. That first one had been so clear he\u2019d really thought they might help him. But only in that one, when he\u2019d watched the dark-eyed beauty die had he seen the death as if through the eyes of the clone. Ever since, he\u2019d seen little more than vague faces contorted with terror. Nightmarish wisps with garbled sound. No details. Nothing to tell him where the killings were taking place. Nothing to help him catch the bastard.</p><p>He slammed the empty Budweiser can on the counter so hard that he crushed it.</p><p>Hawke lifted one dark, winged brow.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in my skin!\u201d Tighe snapped, reading his friend\u2019s expression all too well. \u201cYou can\u2019t blame me for being frustrated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one\u2019s blaming you, buddy. We\u2019re watching you. But we\u2019re not blaming you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d Watching him lose control, minute by minute. Tighe reached back into the fridge and pulled out three more beers, tossing one to each of his companions before turning on the old television in the corner to see if there was any news. He had a morbid need to know the identity of the dark-eyed woman he\u2019d watched die. So far, there\u2019d been nothing about her in the news. Maybe because she was FBI.</p><p>Already, she was haunting him. He\u2019d barely gone an hour without thinking about her, without her face rising into his mind\u2019s eye, those rich mahogany eyes flashing with fury and fire as she\u2019d met her death. Why he was so obsessed with her he couldn\u2019t begin to guess. Yeah, she\u2019d been beautiful. And a fighter, which was admirable enough. But she\u2019d been human. And he didn\u2019t give a rat\u2019s ass about humans.</p><p>Especially dead ones. And with their short, fragile lives, they were all basically the walking dead.</p><p>Damn, but he wanted this to be over. He wanted his soul intact so he and his companions could concentrate on the true threat, the apparent Mage plot to free Satanan and his Daemon horde. If there was a plot. They didn\u2019t know what in the hell was going on.</p><p>Hawke\u2019s brows drew down. \u201cWhat\u2019s with your eyes, Tighe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe black streak?\u201d He\u2019d noticed it in the mirror that morning, a single black streak cutting across his green iris from pupil to outer ring. \u201cBeats the hell out of me.\u201d Frustration simmered inside him, refusing to be distracted. He slammed his fist on the counter. \u201cWhere is that son of a bitch clone? For all we know, he could be halfway to Texas by now.\u201d</p><p>Kougar gave a pull on his Bud, his pale eyes shining over his mustache and goatee. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t put it past him. The bastard\u2019s different than the other clones. Smarter.\u201d</p><p>Hawke nodded. \u201cHe may be evolving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Tighe asked warily.</p><p>\u201cIf I\u2019m right, he\u2019s going to become smarter and more clever every day until he\u2019s nearly your equal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoddess forbid. While I degenerate into a raving lunatic.\u201d</p><p>Hawke shrugged. \u201cHe was the only one who escaped the battle when they were all but defeated. Then he ditched your Land Rover in McLean and stole the cars of each of his victims, one after the other, making him impossible to follow. That\u2019s clever. As is the fact that he\u2019s staying away from the Therian compounds despite the fact Therian energy is his natural food. He\u2019s having to kill human after human to feed himself because he knows the Therians are watching for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, and maybe he just enjoys the killing,\u201d Tighe grunted. \u201cIf I could get another real vision, maybe we could stop...\u201d As if Nature heard his plea, his sight went suddenly black. \u201cIt\u2019s happening again.\u201d As he was swept into another place, he grabbed for the kitchen counter and held on.</p><p>Confusion clouded his mind as he stared into the face of the dark-eyed beauty who\u2019d been haunting his thoughts all day and night. She wasn\u2019t dead. He watched her in the mirror of a public bathroom, as if through her own eyes. She leaned in closer and pulled open the collar of her white blouse, revealing an oval of red welts on the otherwise-flawless olive skin of her long, graceful neck.</p><p>Teeth marks.</p><p>The clone had attacked her, yet she hadn\u2019t died. How was that possible?</p><p>Praise the heavens and Earth.</p><p>He scowled at himself for the relief and, hell, joy rushing through him. She was human, for heaven\u2019s sake. Human.</p><p>Yet there was little about her that reminded him of Gretchen. She was tall where Gretchen had been short. She was dark where Gretchen had been fair. And even in the vision her eyes burned with fire, the same fire that had lit their depths as she\u2019d faced the clone. While Gretchen\u2019s eyes would, in his memory, always radiate with fear.</p><p>There was a fury simmering inside this woman that he sensed was as much a part of her as her brown hair and high cheekbones. He didn\u2019t have to hear her thoughts to know she wanted to catch the creature that had attacked her.</p><p>But it wasn\u2019t going to happen.</p><p>There was no way the Ferals could allow human law enforcement to get their hands on that thing. The moment they realized he didn\u2019t bleed, it was all over. For centuries, the Therian and Mage races had been careful to hide their existence from the humans. The mortals had become too numerous, too powerful. Yet their fear and hatred of the things they didn\u2019t understand was as great as ever. The moment they learned of the immortal races among them, they\u2019d turn their considerable cunning and weaponry toward eliminating them.</p><p>They\u2019d end up destroying the only ones who could save them.</p><p>The woman grimaced suddenly, her face contorting in a pain she quickly masked. Shards of agony bolted through her eyes as her body went tense as a wire. She grabbed for the sink in much the same way he\u2019d grabbed for the kitchen counter a moment ago. As if she feared she\u2019d fall if she didn\u2019t.</p><p>Suddenly, a second vision overlaid the woman\u2019s face in his mind\u2019s eye. An old woman this time, with terror in her eyes as her face became a blur and her wrinkled neck loomed large.</p><p>\u201cOh, God,\u201d the dark-eyed beauty gasped, and suddenly she was the only one he was seeing again. \u201cWhat did he do to me?\u201d she whispered to her reflection. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t enough that he almost killed me. Now I\u2019m going to have to watch him kill others?\u201d</p><p>Tighe\u2019s scalp tingled as the meaning of her words became clear. She was seeing the murders. She was getting his visions.</p><p>\u201cAgent Randall?\u201d A second woman appeared in the bathroom mirror. An older woman of Asian descent rushed toward the beauty. \u201cDelaney, what\u2019s the matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d his vision-stealer said brusquely and straightened, the pain and emotion disappearing from her expression as if they\u2019d never been. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>Tighe blinked as the beauty disappeared. He turned to find Hawke watching him expectantly.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you see?\u201d</p><p>Tighe shook his head, reeling at the implications. Staggering from the inexplicable need to find the woman.</p><p>\u201cSomeone\u2019s stealing my visions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He met Hawke\u2019s piercing gaze. \u201cOne of the two women I watched the clone attack didn\u2019t die. The FBI agent. I just watched her as she saw the next murder. I saw snatches of it, but nothing useful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInteresting,\u201d Hawke murmured.</p><p>\u201cI saw the bite marks on her neck. I know it\u2019s the same woman.\u201d As if he could forget the face he\u2019d been staring at in his memory for twenty-four hours straight.</p> <p>Hawke\u2019s eyes got that faraway look they always got when his mental gears started moving at the speed of light. \u201cShe probably had backup. If her partner shot the clone as he was sucking her life force, he may have inadvertently exhaled some of his own back into her at that moment of impact, then fled without finishing the feeding.\u201d</p><p>Tighe scowled. \u201cAre you telling me she has some of my soul now, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Not your soul. A soul can\u2019t be split without serious magic. But I think she may have acquired a touch of your clone\u2019s life force. Just enough to make her only 99.9 percent human.\u201d</p><p>Tighe groaned. \u201cJust enough to screw up everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGrab your laptop, Hawke, and start hacking. I need an address for FBI agent Delaney Randall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe going after her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot we. Me. I\u2019m going alone. The Feds already know what I look like.\u201d</p><p>Kougar plucked at his goatee. \u201cKill her. Get her out from between you and your clone.\u201d</p><p>His gut twisted as he met Kougar\u2019s pale gaze, as cold as any assassin\u2019s. Not for the first time, he thanked Nature this warrior was friend and not foe.</p><p>\u201cRest assured, that clone is going to die,\u201d Tighe said. \u201cAnd no one, no one, is going to stand in my way.\u201d</p> <p>But he remembered too well his furious thought when he first thought he was destined to kill her.</p><p>She can\u2019t die.</p><p>Chapter Four</p><p>Delaney pressed the elevator button in the FBI field office, her head pounding. Six aspirin over the course of the afternoon hadn\u2019t done a thing to help, as if mere aspirin could relieve the tension of knowing that at any moment, in her head she could be watching another murder take place. Three so far this afternoon. Three.</p><p>Each more painful than the last.</p><p>What had that bastard done to her?</p><p>If she had to acquire superpowers, why couldn\u2019t she have gotten X-ray vision? Or maybe the ability to fly? Visions of death were so not on her wish list.</p><p>No, that was a lie. She\u2019d take anything, even this god-awful sight, if it helped her catch the killer. Unfortunately, none of the murders she\u2019d seen so far had given her a single lead to go on. And each time she got one, she saw less. And hurt more. She\u2019d nearly passed out from the last one.</p> <p>\u201cLeaving already?\u201d</p><p>Delaney\u2019s gaze swung to her boss, who was walking past with a Georgetown Hoyas coffee mug in his hand. Phil Taylor was in his fifties, with a body that was no longer fit, a mind that was as sharp as ever, and eyes that saw way too much. Which was annoying as hell sometimes.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s after seven, sir. You know this is working late for me these days.\u201d She smiled at him, trying to paste a look of serene innocence on her face. \u201cI took your lecture to heart. I\u2019m a fifty-hour-a-week worker these days. Not a minute more.\u201d</p><p>Phil chuckled. \u201cAnd I\u2019m the Easter Bunny. Come into my office for a minute before you go, Agent Randall.\u201d</p><p>Delaney didn\u2019t bother to muffle her groan as she fell into step beside him. Phil knew she hated his fatherly lectures. He was a good guy, and genuinely interested in the mental and physical well-being of his agents, which made him an excellent boss. But she was sick to death of his warning her to put her job in perspective, get a life, etc., etc. She was the only one he hounded to be a little less dedicated. Then again, she was the only one he\u2019d found still at work when he\u2019d come into the office at 2:00 A.M. three mornings in a row.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t in the mood for another lecture. Not tonight. Not when her superpowers could hit again at any moment. Another groan vibrated in her throat. Now wouldn\u2019t that guarantee her an appointment for psych eval?</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t look good, Delaney.\u201d Phil closed his office door and went around his desk.</p><p>\u201cGee, thanks, boss.\u201d As he took his seat, Delaney perched on the edge of the chair across from him as if she only had a minute.</p><p>Phil waved his hand. \u201cYou know what I mean. You\u2019ve got circles under your eyes. You look pale.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s early spring in D.C. Everyone looks pale.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue, but not everyone was attacked by the D.C. Vampire, though at the rate things are going, that might yet change. You were damned lucky to have lived to tell the tale, Delaney.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Just before she\u2019d passed out, she\u2019d heard the crack of a gunshot and felt her attacker jerk and flee. Someone had shot the bastard and saved her life, though her savior hadn\u2019t come forward. None of the residents claimed to know who had done it, though she suspected one of the tough guys she\u2019d put in charge might have followed her down. The only person she\u2019d been able to thank for her life was the EMT who\u2019d administered CPR and gotten her heart started again.</p><p>By the time the cops and Feds had arrived on the scene, there\u2019d been no trail of blood to follow. Not a drop, even though she knew she\u2019d shot the killer as he lunged for her. She knew she had. As had her savior. So why wasn\u2019t there any blood? It made no sense.</p><p>It was almost as if the man wasn\u2019t entirely human, which was ridiculous of course. Vampires weren\u2019t any more real than the Great Pumpkin. The only reason the killer had been dubbed the D.C. Vampire was because of his habit of leaving teeth marks, though decidedly human teeth marks, on his victims\u2019 necks.</p><p>But the fact remained, nothing about the murders made sense. And she seriously hated mysteries.</p><p>Phil steepled his hands in front of his mouth, tapping his forefingers on his upper lip. \u201cI want you to take a couple of days off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Friday. Taking a couple of days off at this point in the week is traditional, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmart aleck. Two days in addition to the weekend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUn-uh. No way.\u201d As if making her stay out of the office fourteen hours a day wasn\u2019t bad enough. \u201cI received a clean bill of health, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know what he did to you, Delaney, but your heart stopped, in case you\u2019ve forgotten. I\u2019ve been keeping an eye on you today, and you\u2019re not looking good. Whether you like it or not, you need a few days to get your equilibrium back. Go visit family.\u201d He winced as if he\u2019d forgotten she didn\u2019t have any. \u201cOr just leave town. Get away from this place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. I\u2019m working normal hours, taking weekends off, all the things you told me to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, sure. And what are you doing with all that free time? Tell me that.\u201d</p><p>She smiled sweetly. Innocently. \u201cScrapbooking.\u201d</p><p>Phil gave a bark of laughter. \u201cYou\u2019re stubborn, Randall. Anyone ever tell you that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou. All the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve always liked that about you.\u201d His expression turned serious as he leaned forward, resting his forearms on his desk. \u201cYou\u2019re one of the best agents I have, Delaney, but I worry about you. You\u2019re determined to catch them all, and you can\u2019t. Nobody can.\u201d</p><p>Delaney rolled her shoulders uncomfortably. \u201cI don\u2019t have to catch them all. Just the ones I\u2019m after.\u201d</p><p>Phil shook his head. \u201cStubborn, stubborn.\u201d His expression softened. \u201cA four-day weekend, Delaney. That\u2019s all I\u2019m asking. If you\u2019re bored, call Mary. Since our youngest left for college, she doesn\u2019t know what to do with herself. I\u2019m sure she\u2019d be delighted to meet you for lunch or some shopping. Sleep. Eat. Maybe even read a book. Do something that has absolutely nothing to do with the D.C. Vampire for four days.\u201d He nodded once, sharply. \u201cThat\u2019s an order.\u201d</p><p>She gave him a wry look that held a hint of a smile. \u201cYou\u2019re a pain in the ass, you know that?\u201d</p><p>His expression softened the way her father\u2019s used to after he\u2019d scolded her, right before he told her he still loved her. The liar.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be doing my job if I weren\u2019t.\u201d Phil waved his hand toward the door. \u201cNow go home and turn on the television. And make it a comedy. When you walk in here Wednesday morning, I want you looking like the living again instead of the half-dead.\u201d</p><p>Delaney made a face at him but didn\u2019t say any more as she rose, lifted her hand in a brief farewell, and left. Taking a long weekend might actually work to her advantage. Maybe if she weren\u2019t so tired, she\u2019d start seeing the visions clearly again, without the accompanying migraine.</p><p>Then, if she could just figure out where the next murder was taking place, she might be able to get there in time to stop it. Or at least, in time to catch the murderer.</p><p>That son of a bitch was going down.</p><p>As she walked to her car, she prayed she\u2019d get another vision soon. But as she slid her key into the ignition of her Toyota SUV, her head exploded with pain. Too soon.</p><p>The keys dropped to the floor with a jangle as Delaney grabbed the steering wheel, gasping. Her vision went until all she could see were wildly colored jagged shapes that cut through her head and stole her breath with excruciating agony. Her skin turned to ice even as beads of sweat rolled between her breasts.</p><p>A scream tore through her brain. A scream not her own.</p><p>Amid the tearing color she caught glimpses of a scene. An unknown woman\u2019s face contorted in terror. A body lying on a pitted and stained linoleum floor.</p><p>The visions and colors flew at her, clawing at her mind until the pain ran in bright red rivulets that slowly turned to black.</p><p>\u201cHey, lady!\u201d</p><p>Delaney blinked, a god-awful noise blaring in her ears as she awoke with a jolt. She straightened, releasing the steering wheel. The noise abated at once.</p><p>The horn. She\u2019d been leaning on the horn.</p><p>The fog of confusion dissipated through the ache that still filled her head. She\u2019d had another vision. Or maybe just one hell of a migraine. A migraine with dead people.</p><p>The tapping resumed on her window, and she turned to find the garage attendant staring at her through the glass. She reached for the keys, remembered they\u2019d fallen, and leaned down to search for them with shaking fingers. Finally, she managed to snag them, start the car, and lower the window.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d he asked worriedly. \u201cDid you pass out or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI fell asleep. I\u2019m fine.\u201d With that, she backed out of the parking space and left the garage to join the heavy flow of traffic. Phil had told her she looked half-dead. She was beginning to think he might have been closer to the truth than she wanted to believe. Maybe she was coming down with the flu. The visions were just fever-induced hallucinations.</p><p>And maybe the man who\u2019d attacked her had given her something in addition to the visions. Some kind of deadly disease.</p><p>She groaned. If she still felt so bad in the morning, she\u2019d go to the doctor. Right now, all she wanted to do was to get home and sleep. Please God, without another vision, or she\u2019d never make it home at all.</p><p>She white-knuckled it the entire trip to Fairlington, but made it without incident. As she fumbled with her keys in the lock of her condo, a cat leaped into her line of sight, startling her. Her keys fell from her nerveless fingers, but the pretty tabby barely seemed to notice, sliding instead around her ankle.</p><p>\u201cSorry about that, fella. Where\u2019d you come from?\u201d She stroked the animal\u2019s orange-striped fur as she bent down to retrieve her keys. \u201cYou\u2019re a pretty thing, but you don\u2019t want to stay near me tonight. If I\u2019m getting sick, like I think I am, things are bound to get disgusting. Go home.\u201d</p><p>But he only purred and rubbed his face against her pant leg. Delaney gave his chin a scratch, then rose and managed to get the key in the lock. As she pushed open the door, the cat raced inside.</p><p>Blast it. She was so not up to chasing a cat. Unless he changed his mind fast, he was going to have to spend the night.</p><p>The animal turned and sat in the bedroom doorway, watching her as she set her briefcase on the large dining table that constituted the only real furniture in her living room. On the table sat her laptop and computer and a host of case files. Covering the walls of the room were maps, photos of the missing, and the crime-scene photos of the dead. Her office away from the office. Although Phil had made her promise not to come in to work any more than fifty hours a week, she never quit working, as the too-shrewd man knew all too well.</p><p>She met the cat\u2019s eerily sharp gaze. \u201cBelieve me, if you\u2019re looking for a home, this isn\u2019t it.\u201d</p><p>She swayed on her feet and grabbed the back of the nearest straight-backed chair wishing, for once, she\u2019d bothered to buy a sofa. The only place she could relax was the bed. And that was where she needed to be.</p><p>The cat\u2019s soft, deep purr caressed her frayed nerves, as if he sensed how lousy she felt. It was kind of nice feeling like someone cared, even if he was really just asking for food. Maybe with her working more hours from home, she could take having a pet off that wish list reserved for the distant future. A future she hadn\u2019t thought she was going to see for a brief few minutes in the laundry room of the Potomac Side Apartments.</p><p>The cat moved out of her way as she went into the bedroom, then resumed his watchful pose as she pulled off her suit jacket and tossed it on the bed.</p><p>\u201cI had a cat once,\u201d she told him. \u201cI had a lot of things once, until a scumbag caught my mom on a deserted stretch of running trail.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cNow I have a purpose.\u201d</p><p>As she divested herself of both weapons and kicked off her shoes, she felt like the cat was studying her. Something in his eyes almost seemed to be assessing her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As if she hadn\u2019t gotten enough of that from Phil already.</p><p>She shook her head at him. \u201cI don\u2019t have to justify myself to you, too. I didn\u2019t invite you in here, in case you\u2019ve forgotten.\u201d She unfastened her pants and slid them down her hips, then turned her back on him as she reached into her closet for a hanger. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome to go anytime you want to, just don\u2019t look at me like I don\u2019t measure up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d say your measurements are just about perfect.\u201d</p> <p>Delaney spun at the sound of the deep male voice. And froze. The D.C. Vampire stood in her doorway watching her as intently as the cat had moments before.</p><p>Son of a bitch.</p><p>Her headache and jitters disappeared in a rush of adrenaline and anger. This time, he was going down.</p><p>She whirled, reaching for her Glock. And never touched it. He slammed her back against the wall, wrenching her arms above her head, capturing her wrists in a single large hand even as he pressed his body against hers. Eye to eye with the buttons of his burgundy silk shirt, she fought for her life. Struggling to free her hands, she tried to ram her knee into his groin.</p><p>He stopped her cold, nailing her to the wall with his pelvis.</p> <p>Her breath heaved. Fury swirled in her mind as his size and sheer strength overwhelmed her. Twice, he\u2019d gotten her. Twice. It was inexcusable.</p><p>The blood pounded fast and hard through her veins as she stared up into his face, her own reflected in his dark wraparound sunglasses. God, she\u2019d never seen anyone so ugly on the inside who was so incredibly good-looking on the outside. Was that how he got so close to his victims?</p><p>Her mind lurched with realization. \u201cHow did you get in here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t believe me if I told you.\u201d His voice was deep and rich, as pleasing as his looks even as he gripped her jaw, immobilizing her with an ease that terrified her. For years, she\u2019d trained hard so this kind of thing wouldn\u2019t happen. So she wouldn\u2019t find herself the prey instead of the hunter.</p><p>So she wouldn\u2019t end up like her mother.</p><p>Yet, in the end, she had. The tightness of the killer\u2019s mouth, the determination in every line of his face let her know he intended to finish what he\u2019d started yesterday. And her utter inability to move beneath his iron grip told her there was nothing she could do to stop him.</p> <p>Blast it! If she thought begging would help, she might have tried to force the words past her pride. But not for a second did she believe he\u2019d listen to her. The man had shown his other victims no mercy whatsoever. None. For God\u2019s sake, he\u2019d killed two children.</p><p>He was utterly without a conscience.</p><p>Hatred flared hot and coarse, burning through her blood. \u201cYou\u2019re going to pay, you bastard, for all the lives you\u2019ve stolen. Sooner or later, they\u2019ll catch you, and you\u2019re going to fry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>She tried again to jerk her face out of his hold, but he only tightened his grip.</p><p>\u201cHold still, or you\u2019re going to have bruises.\u201d</p><p>His words caught her so off guard, she laughed, a single, humorless release of sound. \u201cBruises? Are you kidding? I\u2019m going to be dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to kill you.\u201d The words were terse. Frustrated. \u201cNow will you look into my goddamn eyes?\u201d</p> <p>She stared at him. Was it possible she was dreaming this? Maybe having a fever-induced nightmare? Because the way this was going down made less than no sense. The killer, appearing out of nowhere, only wanted her to look into his eyes. Right.</p><p>But incomprehensible or not, she knew she wasn\u2019t dreaming. The bite of the man\u2019s fingers on her jaw was too clear. His scent too real. Too...luscious.</p><p>She groaned. \u201cI\u2019ve got to be dreaming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are dreaming. Now look into my eyes!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am!\u201d she snapped back. \u201cOr I\u2019m trying to. It might be easier to do if you took off those ridiculous sunglasses. In case you hadn\u2019t noticed, it\u2019s nighttime.\u201d</p><p>He growled low, the sound almost that of a jungle animal. Oh yeah, she was moving from nightmare to delirium. Any minute now Phil the Easter Bunny was going to hop into the room. And she probably wouldn\u2019t even notice, so mesmerized was she by the killer\u2019s amazing mouth.</p><p>Definitely delirious.</p><p>Something brushed her mind, a softness, almost a warmth that eased the lingering pain of the vision.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t remember my face,\u201d the man murmured softly in that deep, sexy voice.</p><p>\u201cOf course not.\u201d Like she could ever forget that face.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t beautiful. Such a word implied a degree of softness, and there wasn\u2019t one soft thing about the man\u2019s features. Strong jaw, hard cheekbones, and a mouth that could have been sculpted by the finest artist. Not a single softness about him, yet his looks were utterly arresting.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m dreaming, remember?\u201d</p><p>The growl that rumbled in the man\u2019s throat sounded more pained than threatening, his mouth thinning with displeasure. The softness brushed her mind stronger than before, sending a shiver of pleasure rippling through her blood.</p><p>His scent teased her nostrils, increasing the pleasure playing with her senses. He smelled wonderful. Like the air after a thunderstorm, clean and fresh, and a little wild. The feel of his body pressing against hers sent heat coursing through her veins to pool damply between her legs.</p><p>Heaven help her, she was turning into one mentally disturbed puppy because this guy was actually turning her on.</p><p>The man sucked in a breath as if he could feel her body\u2019s traitorous response to him. The hand at her jaw gentled, his thumb brushing over her skin, melting her from the inside out.</p><p>Against her abdomen, the hard, thick length of him swelled. Her body quickened, her breasts turning tight and heavy.</p><p>This was sick. Sick. He was a killer!</p><p>\u201cLet go of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t do that, brown eyes. Besides, it\u2019s a dream, remember?\u201d</p><p>His voice slid through her like warm syrup.</p><p>She was losing it, absolutely losing it if she was getting turned on by the man who was preparing to kill her. After he raped her. Though, heaven help her, she wasn\u2019t sure it would be rape. The thought of him taking her, sliding that thick shaft deep inside her, made her body clench and weep.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRain and thunder,\u201d he growled. He released her face and reached for her hands, forcing them against her cheeks as his warm fingers brushed her skin. \u201cWe\u2019re going to try this again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry what? What exactly are we trying to do?\u201d If she knew, maybe she could help him. Or pretend to. If she got him to let his guard down, maybe she could find a way to escape.</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer her. Instead, he licked his lips, sending a shiver of longing shimmering through her. A need to feel her mouth against those lips. Sick.</p><p>He clenched his jaw and pressed his fingers firmly against her cheeks.</p><p>Like before, warmth brushed her mind, but this time it went deeper, flowing down into her body on a rush of pleasure so sharp she gasped. Desire swamped her, and she thrust her hips against his, rubbing herself on the hard length of his erection. Even as her body burned, her mind recoiled, horrified at her body\u2019s betrayal. She couldn\u2019t have played the part of the horny slut any better if she\u2019d tried.</p><p>The thought brought her up short. What if she could use this ungodly attraction to her advantage? In war, anything was fair. And sexual desire had been wielded as a powerful weapon since the dawn of time.</p><p>All she needed was a moment to turn the tables on him, to outsmart him and seize control. A moment to take the bastard down.</p><p>Her mind spun. Rape wasn\u2019t his usual M.O. None of the other victims had been sexually assaulted. If she could get him to have sex with her, he might start thinking of her as something other than his next victim.</p><p>It would be the last mistake he ever made.</p><p>Chapter Five</p><p>Tighe stifled a groan as the half-naked woman rubbed her lace-clad pelvis against the erection filling his pants. He\u2019d never had this much trouble exerting a little mind control over a human.</p><p>What in the hell was happening? He could barely think through the flood of sensations assaulting his body. The sweet, exotic scent of her intoxicated him. The taste of her arousal danced on his tongue, making his body throb and ache. His hands shook with the need to free his erection, push aside the scrap of lace that covered her honey, and push himself deep inside her.</p><p>Get control! Yes, she was beautiful, and hotter than sin, but his life was at stake here. Sex was not on the agenda.</p><p>But, goddess, she was lovely. Her flawless skin was the light natural tan of the Mediterranean, her limbs long and slender, her body toned and strong, yet not without lush, perfect curves. Her hair, fire-lit mahogany, had come loose and fallen around her shoulders in soft waves. Her eyes were the same dark color, though while her hair sparkled with red-and-gold highlights, her eyes glittered with hatred.</p><p>The only thing, the only thing he should be thinking about was clouding her mind so he could climb inside and retrieve his visions. Maybe then, he\u2019d finally be able to catch that good-for-nothing clone.</p><p>But getting control of her was proving to be damned difficult. Twice he\u2019d tried to cloud her mind. Twice all he\u2019d seemed to do was arouse her. Which was a disaster on so many levels.</p><p>Because he had to remain in control himself, and that was hard to do when one of the most beautiful women he\u2019d ever touched was thrusting her hips against him, gasping with desire.</p><p>His gaze caressed her face, then moved to her eyes, staring into their dark depths as he once more pressed into her mind to control and cloud. But all she did was gasp, her passion thickening as she resisted his control as no human ever had before.</p><p>Hawke\u2019s words came back to him. She\u2019s only 99.9 percent human now.</p><p>And, apparently, immune to his control.</p><p>Maybe if he could calm her, he\u2019d be able to breach her mind\u2019s unnatural defenses. He softened his hold on her jaw, his gaze drawn to the rich fullness of her mouth. Heat swirled low in his body, his own mouth aching for a taste of her. \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid of me. I\u2019m not going to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not fear I\u2019m feeling right now.\u201d Her voice was low and husky as she pressed that tiny scrap of lace against his raging erection. \u201cYou\u2019re a handsome man. Sexy as hell.\u201d</p><p>Sweet nature, did she realize she was asking him to take her? He focused on the taste of her emotions. Desire was there, but barely discernible beneath the fear and the fury and the raw, hard-core determination.</p><p>He snorted with understanding. The lady Fed was playing him. Trying to use the attraction between them to distract him so she might escape.</p><p>Smart.</p><p>And damned annoying. Because he\u2019d been attempting to play her. Clearly trying to calm her wasn\u2019t going to do an ounce of good because, at the moment, she had better control over her emotions than he did his.</p><p>So if calming her wasn\u2019t the way to get past her mental barriers, he needed to get her to lower her guard another way. Perhaps by earning her trust. And he knew just the way to go about it. With what was, amazingly, almost the truth.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be afraid of me, Delaney.\u201d</p><p>She tensed, her eyes flaring for only an instant. \u201cYou know my name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had to find you. I\u2019m not who you think I am.\u201d</p><p>Hard eyes probed his face, the touch of her gaze deceptively soft. \u201cAnd who do I think you are?\u201d Her sultry voice felt like a stroke to his throbbing cock.</p><p>Heaven help him.</p><p>\u201cYou think I\u2019m the man who attacked you, the man who\u2019s killed more than a dozen people in the past few days. But I\u2019m not him.\u201d</p><p>Sharp doubt ripped through her eyes, then disappeared behind a wary screen. \u201cWho are you, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis twin.\u201d He stroked her soft cheek with his thumb, enchanted by the silky smoothness of her skin. Would her skin taste as sweetly exotic as she smelled? \u201cThat\u2019s why you\u2019re still alive, brown eyes. My evil twin would never have let you live. I\u2019m not sure how you managed to escape him the first time.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze searched his face as if looking for the truth. \u201cSomeone shot him,\u201d she said slowly. \u201cI shot him.\u201d Her eyes narrowed. \u201cIs he dead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. He\u2019s still very much alive. Which is why I\u2019m here.\u201d He opened his mouth to tell her he\u2019d come to protect her, then remembered who she was. What she was. Delaney Randall was no damsel in distress. She was a warrior. He needed to appeal to that in her. \u201cI want to stop him before he kills again, and I know you do, too. If we work together, we can get him, Delaney.\u201d He stroked her cheek, watching her formidable brain debate his words.</p><p>\u201cWork with me, brown eyes.\u201d He tasted her doubt, her uncertainty, and pressed his advantage. \u201cHelp me catch him before he kills again.\u201d</p><p>He tasted it, the small, secret lift of excitement amid her raging doubt. The opening of her mind, just a sliver.</p><p>It was enough.</p><p>Tighe pushed hard into her mind, pressing against the softened resistance. He had no choice but to force his way in. If he couldn\u2019t get control of her, he had to kill her.</p><p>No choice.</p><p>The woman\u2019s eyes widened, then fell heavily as she moaned, her body arching to rub against his arousal. Her passion surged, rising like a thick, exotic scent on her skin, ensnaring him, threatening to wrench him free of his own thinning control.</p><p>She groaned. \u201cWhat are you trying to do to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot this.\u201d</p><p>Goddess help him. He had to get past the barrier in her mind. As he pushed harder, she flung her head back, gasping for air, looking for all the world like a woman about to...</p><p>She screamed as she came, her body rocking, shaking, shuddering with the force of her release. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Holy heavens and Earth. He was a heartbeat away from following her into that sweet oblivion, his own body hard as stone, dying for a taste of her, dying to be inside her. Never had he been in so much pain for a woman.</p><p>Her eyelids lifted slowly, heavy with passion above stunned eyes. \u201cI want you inside me. Now.\u201d</p><p>Heaven help him, that\u2019s all he wanted. All he wanted. And he couldn\u2019t take her. She was human, dammit. Human. And even if she weren\u2019t, his desire for her was nearly out of control. If he entered her, he feared he\u2019d lose himself entirely. And if he went feral, he\u2019d kill her.</p> <p>That was something he was loath to do.</p><p>But he had to taste her.</p><p>His fingers released her wrists to slide into the softness of her hair as his mouth covered hers. She cried out, the sound halfway between a moan and a plea, as if she were drowning, and he was the only one who could save her. Or maybe he was just transferring his own feelings to her because that was exactly the way he felt. He\u2019d die if he didn\u2019t taste her.</p><p>His tongue swept inside her welcoming mouth, reveling in the sweet, exotic lushness. She tasted just as he\u2019d imagined she would, only a hundred times better. Like the nectar of a rare jungle orchid.</p><p>Like heaven.</p> <p>His tongue stroked hers, then her teeth and the insides of her cheeks, exploring the damp depths of her, thrilled when she did the same, as if she couldn\u2019t get enough of him.</p><p>Heaven knew, he couldn\u2019t get enough of her.</p><p>Kissing wasn\u2019t enough. He unbuttoned her shirt with quick fingers and brushed aside the opening to cover her lace-covered breast with his palm, squeezing gently until she arched into his touch and moaned into his mouth. His fingers went to the tight little peak, pinching and rolling it between his finger and thumb until she was rocking against him in a half-crazed frenzy.</p><p>He pulled away from her mouth and tasted the sweet skin of her cheek and the salty tang of her brow.</p><p>His breaths were coming in short, shallow gasps, his own brow damp from the effort to retain some semblance of control. But why maintain control? Why not just take her? With his release, this crazed need would abate. He\u2019d be able to get them both under control.</p><p>The logic almost made sense.</p> <p>\u201cFuck me,\u201d the woman groaned, her freed hand sliding between them to clamp around his painfully hard erection. \u201cI need you inside me.\u201d</p><p>Goddess. His hand slid to the button of his jeans, but as his fingers reached for the zipper tab, the bitter taste of hatred slid across his tongue. His hand stilled as he explored the taste and knew it was hers. A hatred of him, certainly, but also of herself. Self-hatred had a taste all its own.</p><p>She might have decided to play on their mutual attraction, but she was way past pretending, lost to passion\u2019s madness. And despite his assurance to the contrary, she still thought him a killer. She hated herself for wanting him.</p><p>Goddess knew, he didn\u2019t want this attraction any more than she did. He did not fuck humans.</p><p>It was all he could do to pull away from her, but he managed it. Barely. He gripped her shoulders and pushed her back to the wall. Her damp, swollen lips and slumberous eyes were nearly his undoing, until he saw the confusion in those eyes and the pain of betrayal, even if the betrayal was her own.</p><p>Once more he looked into those eyes and attempted to cloud her mind.</p><p>She shuddered. \u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d The word was low, pained.</p><p>He was getting nowhere with her. Whatever had happened to thrust her in the way of his visions was making her immune to his control. And if he couldn\u2019t control her, he had to eliminate her as a problem. Kougar was right.</p> <p>The Ferals never destroyed life without justification, but humans who threatened the Therian race or any of its members, in any capacity, were eliminated without hesitation. Always.</p><p>The woman watched him with fathomless eyes, her lips parted as she struggled to catch her breath. \u201cWhat now?\u201d</p><p>A hard knot formed in his gut. He\u2019d promised he wouldn\u2019t hurt her. His hand reached for her, his thumb stroking her soft cheek.</p><p>From that first vision when he\u2019d watched her face her death with a warrior\u2019s toughness and fury in her eyes, he\u2019d known she was different. When she\u2019d faced him tonight, thinking her attacker had found her again, he\u2019d tasted her fear on his tongue, yet she\u2019d never whimpered. Never begged. She\u2019d fought him. Even while her pulse raced, her mind had remained clear, her words calm, laced with a bitter wryness that had tugged at him. She\u2019d won his admiration, which was something no human had done in a very long time.</p><p>He met her gaze as his palm slid down the long column of her throat, and he saw the question in her eyes. She wasn\u2019t ready to die. He could feel her will to live rushing over him with a force like liquid steel. Yet she waited, watching him, with grace and courage.</p><p>As his palm stroked her throat, he knew he couldn\u2019t do it. Human and fragile as she might be, there was something peculiarly strong about her. Inexplicably rare.</p><p>Deep inside him, he felt something stir, as if the tiger within raised its head, scenting something on the wind.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t take her life.</p><p>But neither could he let her go. Sliding his finger to the hollow at the base of her ear, he pressed.</p><p>The woman collapsed, unconscious, and he swept her into his arms. Somehow, he was going to have to find another way to steal back his visions and get control over her.</p><p>Hawke and Kougar were going to think he was starting to lose his ability to reason.</p><p>And he wasn\u2019t entirely sure they\u2019d be wrong. He didn\u2019t have to have premonitions to know Delaney Randall was going to be trouble.</p><p>\u2665 Uploaded by Coral \u2665</p><p>Chapter Six</p><p>Tighe pushed through the safe-house door Hawke held open for him, the unconscious woman in his arms.</p><p>Hawke lifted a single winged brow. \u201cAny luck?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone.\u201d Frustration plucked at his fraying nerves. Nothing about this mission had gone right, with the possible exception of the ease with which he\u2019d gotten into Delaney\u2019s apartment. From the moment he\u2019d touched her, every plan had taken a nosedive.</p><p>Each time he\u2019d tried to cloud her mind, she got more excited, as if someone had gotten inside her and changed all her wiring. And maybe someone had, if inadvertently. His clone. Goddess knew what had happened when that bastard attacked her.</p><p>It almost certainly explained Tighe\u2019s inability to catch her mind. It didn\u2019t explain how she\u2019d gotten under his skin. The passion he drew in her was heady, certainly, but the fire that had burned in him when he\u2019d pressed his body against hers, that burned in him still, was way more than a simple reaction to her own fire. There was something about the woman that sent his senses into a barrel roll.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t cloud her mind,\u201d he informed his companions. \u201cShe reacts to my attempts, just not in any way that\u2019s the least bit useful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d Hawke\u2019s keen eyes gleamed with curiosity.</p><p>Tighe growled by way of answer. He glanced at the sofa, considered laying the woman down, then discarded the idea. Even though he knew she was fully out, some part of his brain, some instinct, made him certain she\u2019d escape him the moment he released her. And he wasn\u2019t letting her go.</p><p>\u201cThe information might be useful, buddy,\u201d Hawke pressed.</p><p>Tighe scowled, then relented. \u201cWhen I push into her mind, her body reacts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReacts how?\u201d</p><p>Damned nosy Feral. \u201cSexually, Hawke. She reacts sexually. I pushed hard enough that she came.\u201d</p><p>Hawke whistled, that eyebrow of his lifting again. \u201cInteresting.\u201d</p><p>Tighe snorted. \u201cYeah. And bloody useless. I\u2019m still no closer to clouding her mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you try to seize control during her orgasm?\u201d</p><p>Tighe stilled. \u201cNo. Damn.\u201d At the moment of sexual release, the body and mind were most open. Open to bonding with a partner. And open to being captured by a mind capable of control. \u201cIt took me by surprise.\u201d Hell, he\u2019d been fighting his own release so hard he hadn\u2019t given a single thought to taking advantage of hers. Not in that way. \u201cI\u2019ll try it again.\u201d</p><p>If Jag had been there, he\u2019d have demanded to watch, the asshole. Hawke just nodded.</p><p>\u201cYou should have killed her.\u201d Kougar stood in the doorway of one of the bedrooms, watching them, his arms crossed over his chest, his pale eyes emotionless.</p><p>Tighe\u2019s grip on the woman tightened. No one ever really knew what went on in that Feral\u2019s head. For as long as Tighe had lived at Feral House, rumors and speculation had swirled around Kougar. Of all of them, his past was the most deeply cloaked in mystery. They knew he was the oldest among them, but if anyone knew how old, he hadn\u2019t shared it.</p><p>Centuries ago, rumors had swirled that Kougar was half-Mage, that he\u2019d been responsible for the deaths of the seventeen\u2014seventeen Ferals killed in a mysterious cave, seventeen whose animals had never again risen to mark another. But Lyon trusted him. And that was enough for Tighe. In the six centuries Tighe himself had been a Feral, Kougar had never proven himself anything but loyal.</p><p>But he rarely spoke. Instead, he watched silently, waiting, until the time came to fight. Then he fought with a skill and ferocity worthy of any berserker.</p><p>He was a good man to have on your team as long as you weren\u2019t looking for anything approaching warmth or friendliness. Kougar didn\u2019t possess an ounce of either.</p><p>Tighe might trust him at his back, but he was a long way from trusting him not to eliminate the human woman the moment he got a chance. Particularly since they all thought Tighe was slowly losing his mind.</p><p>A warning growl rumbled deep in his throat as he met Kougar\u2019s pale gaze.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t even think about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKilling her might be a mistake,\u201d Hawke said.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Not that Tighe didn\u2019t agree, but he was half-afraid his own reasons had more to do with fearless dark warrior\u2019s eyes than anything remotely logical.</p><p>Hawke shrugged. \u201cThere\u2019s no guarantee you\u2019ll get the full visions back if she\u2019s gone. Right now you\u2019re still getting snippets, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes. Hell, I don\u2019t know if I am or not. It\u2019s not consistent. At first I was seeing her as she got the visions, along with glimpses of the killing. Then just the glimpses. But I haven\u2019t seen anything in hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if she dies, and the visions die with her? We\u2019ll have lost a powerful weapon.\u201d</p><p>Tighe silently thanked his friend, his grip on his captive easing. Hawke was right. Maybe somewhere in the mess that was currently acting as his brain, he\u2019d had the same thought.</p><p>\u201cThe next time she has a vision, buddy, try to get into her head. Even if you can\u2019t steal it back, maybe you can share it. Enough, at least, to figure out where the attack is taking place.\u201d</p><p>He met Hawke\u2019s gaze. \u201cI\u2019ll work on her. Both on clouding her mind and on accessing her next vision. But we don\u2019t need an audience. You\u2019re leaving.\u201d His gaze shifted to Kougar. \u201cBoth of you.\u201d</p><p>Kougar\u2019s expression didn\u2019t change, it never did, yet he sensed the warrior\u2019s disapproval.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good idea, Tighe.\u201d Hawke\u2019s brows drew down. \u201cIf you lose control, you could kill her.\u201d</p><p>Tighe\u2019s gaze swung to Kougar\u2019s. \u201cThen problem solved.\u201d He looked back at Hawke. \u201cIt\u2019s a risk we\u2019re going to take, Wings. This woman may be human, but she\u2019s a fighter through and through. And FBI. She\u2019s already seen my face. She doesn\u2019t need to see yours, too. Not until I\u2019m sure I can clean her memory. Besides, I\u2019ve got to get her sexually aroused again, and I\u2019m not having an audience for that.\u201d</p><p>An odd protectiveness had him tightening his grip on the woman in his arms. The thought of anyone else listening to her cries of passion, to her scream of release, filled him with a strange and jealous anger.</p><p>Calm, Tighe. Calm.</p><p>He took a deep breath and met Hawke\u2019s gaze. \u201cUnless you want to see my claws, this discussion is over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnderstood. We\u2019ll grab our things and take off, but we won\u2019t be far, buddy. We\u2019ll keep an eye on the house.\u201d</p><p>Five minutes later, as the two Ferals closed the door behind them, Tighe stood in the middle of the living room, looking down at Delaney Randall. His mind told him to lay her down, but his arms refused to let her go. Why? What was this strange need in him to hold her? A need that went beyond merely keeping her from escaping. It was a need that went against every ounce of logic in his head.</p><p>Was it merely the unruly attraction he had for her getting out of hand? Or was it the madness that was slowly disintegrating his ability to act logically? To act sanely.</p><p>A madness that could ultimately destroy them both.</p><p>Delaney eased out of sleep, a purr in her throat at the feel of warmth at her back. Warmth. Man.</p><p>The killer.</p><p>A cold wash of adrenaline cramped her stomach, sending her pulse careening into her ears as her mind snapped fully awake.</p><p>He\u2019d knocked her unconscious. Which beat the hell out of killing her, for sure, but the arms of a killer was not where she wanted to be.</p><p>Slowly, she opened her eyes a slit in case the man at her back wasn\u2019t the only one in the room. But all that met her gaze were the shadowed furniture and walls of a dark, unfamiliar bedroom. A single, large window covered by sheer curtains glowed from the light of a streetlamp.</p><p>Not her apartment. He\u2019d knocked her out and kidnapped her. That could make escape infinitely more difficult since she had no idea where she was or who else might be around to stop her if she managed to escape him.</p><p>But that didn\u2019t mean she wasn\u2019t going to try.</p><p>In the distance, a truck downshifted, the sound merging with the low rumble of predawn traffic. City traffic. She doubted he\u2019d taken her far. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And why had he kidnapped her at all? Why was she still alive?</p><p>Her senses took quick inventory as she shifted slightly. He was holding her, spoon style, his thickly muscled arm heavy across her waist. But she couldn\u2019t feel any bindings to indicate he\u2019d tied her either to the bed or to himself.</p><p>She was still wearing the blouse she\u2019d worn to work, the fabric soft but with little give. Her bra was tight against her rib cage. On her legs, if she wasn\u2019t mistaken, were the sweatpants she\u2019d been planning to put on, the ones that had been lying across the foot of her bed.</p> <p>The thought of his dressing her, of him sliding the pants up her bare legs and her hips, sent a cold chill rippling over her skin. Had he touched her? Had he raped her?</p><p>Her pulse pounded in her ears, but she forced herself to breathe. To think. She didn\u2019t feel sore down there. And she almost certainly would if he\u2019d taken her when she was unconscious.</p><p>Besides, why would he bother raping her when she\u2019d begged him to take her? When she\u2019d been so hot for him, she\u2019d come.</p><p>Her cheeks heated at the memory even as a familiar ache started up again between her legs. The man\u2019s scent brushed her senses, the scent of sleep-warmed male combined with the hint of wildness that had stirred her so thoroughly last night. And stirred her still.</p><p>God, what was the matter with her? Just lying beside him like this had her libido leaping all over again.</p> <p>She gave a silent groan, forcing herself to tear her thoughts away from the man at her back and focus outward. If there were others in the place, the sooner she knew it, the better. But she heard nothing except the even breathing of her captor.</p><p>Apparently her plan to make him think she wanted him had worked well enough since she was still alive. Too bad it hadn\u2019t been an act.</p><p>He was a killer.</p><p>Or the twin of one. Could he possibly have been telling the truth when he told her he wasn\u2019t the man who\u2019d attacked her? It was certainly a possibility. After all, she was still alive.</p><p>Then again, how did he know she\u2019d been attacked if he wasn\u2019t the one who\u2019d attacked her? How did he know who she was? Her involvement had never hit the news.</p><p>Whether or not he was the killer, he was clearly involved up to his sunglasses-covered eyeballs. And there was no denying he\u2019d committed criminal acts. He\u2019d broken into the apartment of a federal agent, overpowered her, and kidnapped her. For that alone, he was looking at jail time.</p> <p>Either way, he had information they needed. Either way, he was going down.</p><p>She remembered how fast he\u2019d moved last night and the lightning speed with which she\u2019d been attacked in the laundry room. If she wanted to get him, she was going to have to move fast, without mercy. Because once he woke, her chance to take him down would be over.</p><p>Her gaze caught the gleam of the bedside lamp. Brass. Perfect. All she had to do was crack him over the skull with it and run for the nearest phone. Piece of cake. Assuming she managed to get out from under his arm without waking him. His warm breath stirred her hair on a soft rumble of a snore. He was definitely asleep. But would he stay that way?</p><p>Her pulse rose another notch as she prepared to find out.</p><p>Sending a quick prayer heavenward for luck, and keeping her body loose, as if she were still asleep, she rolled onto her stomach on the soft, cool cotton sheets, away from the man.</p><p>His arm slid away from her without protest.</p><p>Swallowing a surge of triumph, Delaney lay still as death, willing her heart\u2019s pounding to settle down as she waited for her captor\u2019s breathing to even out again. When she\u2019d waited as long as she could stand, she eased the blanket off her, inch by inch, and swung her legs over the side, her bare toes settling on a soft, worn rug.</p><p>In a light, careful move, she rose from the bed and knelt by the bedside table to follow the lamp\u2019s cord to the outlet. When she found it, she gave a quick, silent tug and rose to her feet.</p> <p>Her heart began to pound. This was it. If she hit him too hard, she\u2019d kill him. At one point, before he\u2019d planted the doubt in her mind that he was the man she sought, all she\u2019d wanted was to kill him. Now she wasn\u2019t so sure.</p><p>Legally, she needed to not kill him. But if she didn\u2019t hit him hard enough, she was as good as dead. And she had a feeling it would take a direct hit by a cruise missile to incapacitate the guy.</p><p>She grabbed the lamp at its neck, her fingers closing around the cool metal as she took a deep breath. Here goes nothing. In a single move, she flipped the heavy lamp upside down and swung the base of it at the sleeping man\u2019s head as hard as she could.</p><p>The lamp collided not with skull, but with moving flesh as her captor\u2019s hand shot out, stopping the deadly arc cold. He wrenched the lamp from her hands and flung it across the room to crash against the wall.</p><p>Delaney\u2019s mouth dropped open. Her heart went to her throat, and she leaped back from the bed, her pulse pounding as she readied for hand-to-hand combat.</p><p>He was little more than a blur in the shadows as he grabbed her. The room spun as he flung her facedown on the bed. She dug her face out of the sheets, trying to flip over, but he pinned her with a jeans-clad knee in the small of her back. Her pulse thudded in her throat as she watched him over her shoulder, tensing for his retribution.</p><p>\u201cYou tried to kill me.\u201d His voice was flat as he loomed over her, staring down at her through those dark sunglasses she was beginning to suspect were permanently attached to his face. Who in their right mind slept in sunglasses?</p><p>She hated him for making her feel so blasted helpless. Fear slithered down her spine. With his strength, he could kill her with his bare hands without ever breaking a sweat.</p><p>Her breath caught, her body tensing, as she waited for him to do just that. But to her surprise, he climbed on top of her, straddling her hips.</p><p>She tried to push him off, tried to get to her knees, but she might as well have tried to lift a bus. He was playing with her. Toying with her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to hurt you,\u201d he said softly, brushing the hair back from her ear. In her peripheral vision, she saw his face lower, felt his lips on her ear, his tongue tracing the cartilage, then delving into the cavern, drawing a shiver from her.</p><p>Her heart thudded as his hand slid beneath her until his fingers found her nipple through her shirt and squeezed just hard enough to send fire shooting straight to her loins.</p><p>His tongue stroked her ear, his lips grazed her cheek. Gently, so gently. Toying with her before he struck.</p><p>His fingers moved under her, tugging at her shirt, pulling at her bra until his fingers were against her bare flesh, his palm warm against her breast. Her breathing turned ragged.</p><p>She felt his hand move again, releasing her breast. As the press of his thighs moved lower, to frame her own, he sat up and slipped his hand inside the waist of her sweatpants, his fingers sliding inside her panties to cup her butt cheek as he had her breast moments before. Then he leaned over her, his fingers kneading the flesh, his breath in her ear becoming as ragged as her own.</p><p>\u201cYou set me on fire.\u201d His voice was low, pained, as his fingers dug into her, letting her feel his need, sending hers into an upward spiral.</p><p>He was half over her, half beside her when his palm flattened, his finger sliding into the crease of her buttocks and down, to stroke her swelling lips. His teeth grazed her earlobe, sending a shaft of wet heat straight to her core. His finger slid inside her, meeting that rush of heat.</p><p>Delaney gasped, trying to arch into his touch, but with him still half-straddling her, she had nowhere to move, nowhere to go. He stroked her, playing with her until she was soft and hot and wild with need. Then he released her and rose, only to straddle her calves.</p><p>She tried to rise, her arms shaking, but he dug his fingers into her waistband and yanked downward, pulling her pants and panties down to her thighs in a single jerk of a move, baring her to the cool air. To his gaze. Stealing her last scrap of protection.</p><p>Heat turned to fear on the certainty that he meant to take his revenge upon her body. Panic flared, and she tried to roll away, but his palm fanned across the small of her back, slamming her to the mattress.</p><p>Her heart thudded. Her mouth went dry.</p><p>His free hand dug into her butt cheek. \u201cI\u2019m not going to hurt you.\u201d But the thread of anger in his voice did nothing to reassure her.</p><p>Tears burned the backs of her eyes. Fear knotted in her gut. If she was ready for him, it shouldn\u2019t hurt, but if he wanted to hurt her, there were other ways. She knew too well the cruelty men could visit on women before they killed them. While they killed them. She had the crime photos hanging all over the walls of her living room to prove it.</p><p>She already knew this guy had a sick mind. God knew what he might...</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be afraid of me!\u201d</p><p>She froze. \u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d Her words sounded calm, soothing, despite the tears closing her throat. Long ago, she\u2019d learned to keep her emotions out of her voice and expression, and she desperately called on that trick now.</p><p>His hand squeezed her rear to the point of pain as the tension in the air thickened. Slowly, his hand relaxed, and she began to breathe again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>But she didn\u2019t believe him for a minute. As she struggled against his impossible hold, his hand released her aching flesh to slide between her legs. She tried to clamp her thighs together, desperate to escape his touch, fear spiraling out of her control.</p><p>He was going to hurt her. He wanted to hurt her, to punish her for attacking him.</p><p>\u201cDammit!\u201d In a sudden move, he released her and flung himself off the bed.</p><p>Delaney shot to her knees, yanking her pants up and straightening her shirt and bra, then turned to find him pacing the room like a caged animal, his tight, coiled tension filling the room.</p><p>Definitely bipolar. With violent tendencies.</p><p>Her heart raced in her chest as she edged toward the side of the bed closest to the door. But as she sat and swung her legs over the side, he whirled on her, his finger pointing directly at her face.</p><p>\u201cStay!\u201d</p><p>Delaney froze, her mind scrabbling, fighting down the instinct to flee. He was too fast. She\u2019d never get away.</p><p>Deep breaths. He hadn\u2019t attacked her. Other than squeezing her butt too hard, he hadn\u2019t hurt her at all.</p><p>She watched him pace, his hands clenching and unclenching at his sides like a man struggling to contain his temper. He was trying to get control. The realization slammed into her. The last thing she needed to do was make things worse by running again.</p><p>She forced herself to wait as she watched him warily. The streetlight filtering in through the sheer curtains played over his broad, bare chest, tripping in and out of the shadows created by the muscular definition. Scars, like claw marks, tore across his right nipple while a gold armband snaked around one thick upper arm. Even in the dim light, the man was a walking wet dream.</p><p>If she weren\u2019t so wary of him, she might have enjoyed watching him. With his long legs, trim waist, and sculpted upper body, he was truly a feast for the eyes.</p><p>Minutes passed as he paced, the tension slowly leaching from the air.</p><p>\u201cDo you follow football?\u201d he asked, at last.</p><p>Delaney blinked. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your favorite television show?\u201d</p><p>Her brows puckered with disbelief. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>An animalistic growl rumbled deep in his throat. \u201cYour fear sets me off, and I want your mind off it.\u201d</p><p>Delaney scowled. \u201cI\u2019m not afraid.\u201d She didn\u2019t show it. She knew she didn\u2019t show it.</p><p>Like a cat about to spring, he swung to face her, his body rigid. \u201cDon\u2019t lie to me! I can taste it. No one else would know, but I know. You can\u2019t hide it from me.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t possibly taste her fear. That was ridiculous. But it was hardly a leap for him to guess that she was afraid. Any sane woman would be under the circumstances.</p><p>He returned to his pacing. \u201cWhat\u2019s your favorite television show?\u201d</p><p>Were they really going to play this game? \u201cThe news.\u201d</p><p>He scowled at her. \u201cLame.\u201d</p><p>His response inexplicably pricked her pride. \u201cI don\u2019t have time to waste on mindless shows.\u201d</p><p>He stopped pacing and turned to her. \u201cYour work is your life to the exclusion of everything else, isn\u2019t it? You don\u2019t even own a reading chair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me,\u201d she huffed. \u201cWhat I do is important. I perform a valuable service to society by getting the monsters off the streets.\u201d</p><p>The man snorted. \u201cYou\u2019ll never get the monsters. You don\u2019t even know what they look like, little girl.\u201d</p><p>Delaney ground her teeth together, clamping her mouth shut before she said something she shouldn\u2019t. Something that would make him even madder, turning a bad situation so much worse.</p><p>The man stopped his pacing and started toward her. \u201cYou\u2019re pathetic, you know that? You got your life back, but you don\u2019t even know how to live it, do you?\u201d There was an ugly taunting quality to his voice that infuriated her. \u201cYou\u2019re so hung up on your mother\u2019s death you aren\u2019t even living. Do you think this is what she\u2019d want? You spending your entire life searching for her killer?\u201d</p><p>She stared at him, shock vibrating through her body. It wasn\u2019t true. It wasn\u2019t true. Oh God, of course it was true. \u201cHow...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard you talking to the cat. It wasn\u2019t much of a leap. You\u2019re living an excuse for a life. You don\u2019t even own a sofa or a picture that isn\u2019t a crime-scene photo! Your life\u2019s a joke.\u201d</p><p>She felt as if her chest were caving in and at the same time exploding from the force of her fury. Damn him. Damn him.</p><p>She lunged to her feet and rounded on him. \u201cYou son of a bitch. How dare you judge me. How dare you?\u201d She struck at his knee, a move that should have knocked even a man his size off his feet. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Yet faster than she could blink, she found herself flat on her back on the bed. Again. Blast it. She fought him, struggling with every ounce of strength she possessed. This was too much. Too much.</p><p>She reached for his sunglasses, intending to dig her fingers into his eyes and blind him, but he reared back out of her reach before she touched them. He grabbed her wrists and pulled them over her head, pinning them. Then he landed on the bed beside her, rolled onto his side, and pinned her legs to the mattress with one hard thigh.</p><p>\u201cLet me go!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo you can claw my eyes out? I don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>He grabbed her jaw with his free hand and kissed her.</p><p>She bit him. The taste of his blood ripped her back to her senses. Stupid, Delaney. Stupid, stupid move to risk setting him off again.</p><p>But to her amazement, he laughed, the sound rich and warm. Disturbingly nice. Then he bent his head and placed a kiss on her temple as gentle as a raindrop and lifted his head to look down at her, licking the blood from his lip.</p><p>She stared at him. \u201cI don\u2019t understand you.\u201d</p> <p>A half smile lifted his lips. \u201cI\u2019m not surprised. Fortunately, I do understand you.\u201d</p><p>She grunted with disdain. \u201cHardly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know just how to make you mad, don\u2019t I? And anger is so much more pleasant than fear, isn\u2019t it, brown eyes?\u201d</p><p>He leaned down to kiss her cheek as she stared at the darkened ceiling, speechless.</p><p>\u201cYou meant to make me mad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt worked.\u201d She heard the shrug in his voice, then shivered as his tongue stroked her ear.</p> <p>But her anger only spiked all over again. At him for saying the things that had cut her to the quick. And at herself for letting them bother her so much she\u2019d lost control and tried to attack him again.</p><p>\u201cI hate you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m aware of that.\u201d With the hand not holding her wrists, he pushed the lace cup of her bra down over her nipple, freeing her breast to his warm touch, then took the bare flesh into his mouth.</p><p>She gasped at the feel as desire sparked and flared, feeding her anger. She hated this control he had over her body. With his superior strength, all he had to do was lift an arm, and she was flat on her back. All he had to do was touch her, and she melted like butter in the sun. He made her sick. He made her want to...</p><p>She arched off the bed in pure pleasure as his tongue twirled slowly around her nipple.</p><p>\u201cOh, God, don\u2019t stop.\u201d</p><p>With a last, soft suckle, he released her breast and blew, chilling the wet peak before he turned to its mate, freed it, and pulled the aching, needy flesh into his mouth. She felt his fingers slide once more down the plane of her stomach and into her pants. Though her mind rebelled, her body wanted this. Desperately.</p><p>The weight of his thigh lifted, his leg curling around hers and giving a gentle tug, spreading her thighs for his seeking finger. She jerked as the pad of his finger stroked her clit, then gasped as it slid farther, deep into her heat. With a groan of pure need, she bucked, swallowing him deeper into the liquid fire he\u2019d set ablaze inside her.</p> <p>How could he do this to her? What was it about him that the simple feel of his mouth on her breasts nearly brought her to climax? Never had she gone so over the top with a man. Any man. She\u2019d only had sex three times in her life, with two different partners, because it was so damned boring.</p><p>Even sex with this guy\u2019s finger was enough to turn her into a panting, raving, lunatic. If he ever pushed his cock inside her...</p><p>Just the thought of it nearly made her come.</p><p>\u201cLook at me, brown eyes.\u201d</p><p>She opened her eyes, not remembering having closed them, and looked at the dark line of his sunglasses.</p><p>A rush of warmth flooded her mind, a hot wind on a roaring flame, turning her body into a superheated bonfire. Her hips rocked against his hand, desperate for more. She needed...she needed...</p><p>The orgasm broke over her in an explosion of light and pleasure so sharp it was like nothing she\u2019d ever felt, hurtling her into a rainbow of colors and ecstasy. As she rode the explosion, her body bucked wildly, forcing that finger deeper, deeper.</p><p>Her eyes started to roll back in her head.</p><p>\u201cLook at me, Delaney. Look at me!\u201d</p><p>She did, somehow knowing she met his gaze through those sunglasses. Something happened. A hot pressure gripped her head, a sharp pain that was gone almost before it registered, disappearing in the clenching spasms of release.</p><p>Slowly, the pleasure eased, and her body floated downward. Her hips ceased their rocking, and she lay beside the man, trying to catch her breath even as his finger continued to play with her wetness.</p><p>As the roaring pleasure eased, she became aware of a strange sensation inside her head, like the soft brush of angel\u2019s wings against the inner walls of her skull whispering impressions into her mind. He wasn\u2019t the killer. He didn\u2019t kill needlessly. He was honorable. Fine. And very, very dangerous.</p><p>Honorable, the wings whispered. Trust him.</p><p>She looked up at him, exhausted and confused. \u201cI don\u2019t even know your name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Tighe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat have you done to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing for you to be worried about. Now go to sleep, Delaney.\u201d</p><p>And just like that, she did.</p><p>Chapter Seven</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s about damned time,\u201d Tighe muttered as he slowly withdrew his finger from the woman\u2019s hot depths. Sweet nature, what she did to him. He was shaking with the need to finish what he\u2019d started with her, to push inside her with the part of his anatomy made for the purpose. A part of him that was more than up for the task.</p><p>But he was not a man who took advantage of women. At least not more than he absolutely had to.</p><p>Not even human women. Especially not human women.</p><p>He sucked the honey from his finger, groaning at the perfection of her taste. What was it about her that turned him inside out? Was it this odd connection they\u2019d formed through his clone? Or was it the excitement of the unknown? An unknown he hadn\u2019t experienced in a good long while?</p><p>The only women he allowed himself to have sex with were Therians, and he\u2019d known most of them for centuries. Delaney Randall was new to him. Young and exciting. And human, dammit. Completely and totally off-limits. He hadn\u2019t gotten involved with a human since Gretchen. And he never would again.</p><p>But, goddess, Delaney Randall was a beauty. He gazed down at her face, at her slender nose and full, ripe mouth as his thumb brushed the silken skin covering one high cheekbone. The longing to taste her again almost overpowered him.</p><p>What was she doing to him?</p><p>He needed to get her out of his life, fast, before he lost what little control he still possessed and pushed inside her, becoming a slave to this need for her until he destroyed them both.</p><p>Now that he\u2019d finally, finally, captured control of her mind, it should only be a short while before he was through with her. He\u2019d felt the catch, though not in the usual way. He hadn\u2019t been certain he really did have her mind until he\u2019d ordered her to go to sleep, and she had. The connection lingered inside his head, like a pleasurable warmth fanning the insides of his skull. Odd. But nothing with this woman had been normal.</p><p>All that mattered was she was his, finally. He should be able to root around in her mind and figure out how to free her of those visions. Once he\u2019d disconnected her from the clone, it should be a simple matter to steal her memories of him as well. Meanwhile, the Delaney Randall who\u2019d turned him inside out was gone. For the moment.</p><p>For him.</p><p>Ridiculous to feel regret at the thought.</p><p>No, this was the way it had to be. He\u2019d keep her calm and semicomatose until one of them got another vision, then he\u2019d take it from there.</p><p>But as he stroked her finely shaped brow with his thumb, he couldn\u2019t help the feeling of inexplicable loss. He was going to miss her fire and strength, her cunning and intelligence, and even the shadows in her eyes that spoke of loss and called to something deep inside him.</p><p>She would still be pretty to look at, but it was the fire that burned within her that made her truly beautiful. A fire gone cold, until he released her mind again. He was sorry for that. But there was neither reason nor time to delay the inevitable. With a sigh, he lifted a lock of her hair, the soft, dark wave sliding between his fingers.</p><p>\u201cWake up, Delaney.\u201d</p><p>Instantly, her dark lashes swept up, revealing eyes filled with confusion.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t remember anything that happened after the cat ran into your apartment last night,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>Her head turned to him, her eyes narrowing. \u201cO-kay.\u201d</p><p>His hand froze on her hair as he stared at her, blinking. Shit. Shit. He hadn\u2019t gotten control of her mind at all. Yet he had connected with it. Staring into her eyes he could almost see the gossamer thread, running between them, fanning the warmth in his head.</p><p>Outrage barreled through him. Every time he tried to control her, something else went wrong. He flung himself off the bed and strode to the wall, barely keeping himself from slamming his fist through the plasterboard. He not only had to seize control of her mind, but now he had to break this unholy connection.</p><p>He whirled to find her sitting up.</p><p>How could he not have her mind? She\u2019d gone to sleep and wakened on cue. Unless...</p><p>\u201cLie down,\u201d he barked. And she did. Instantly. \u201cSit up.\u201d She jerked upright as if pulled by an unseen cord.</p><p>\u201cStop it!\u201d she cried. \u201cHow are you doing this?\u201d</p><p>He seemed to have gotten control of her body and not her mind. How in the hell had that happened? And what good did it do? He needed to keep her from remembering him!</p><p>\u201cLie down.\u201d</p><p>She fell back, mouth wide with disbelief, eyes filled with terror as she struggled to move, but he\u2019d told her to lie down, and that was all she could do.</p><p>\u201cWhat have you done to me?\u201d</p><p>He smiled bitterly. \u201cIt seems I\u2019ve got you under my control, Agent Randall. Just not the way I wanted, dammit.\u201d</p><p>He saw the realization in her eyes, the understanding of just how vulnerable she really was. Raw, icy fear rolled across his tongue, hurling him back to another time. In his mind, he saw Gretchen, his beloved Gretchen, her eyes wide with terror.</p><p>She should have known. She should have known.</p><p>At the hated taste on his tongue, fury ripped through him, tearing him loose from his control. He felt the burn of his claws unsheathing, the ache of his fangs getting ready to drop.</p><p>Not now. Not now.</p><p>He longed to hurt her, to punish her for her fear. For her betrayal. She\u2019d destroyed him. Taken everything from him, everything that had ever mattered.</p><p>For a second, his mind cleared. He was staring at Delaney, not Gretchen. Delaney.</p><p>Desperately, he tried to wrench back control. But it was too late. Too late.</p><p>\u201cClose your eyes and stay there!\u201d He whirled away from her as the chaos swept him into that place of fury and violence, a place where he was neither man nor beast, yet utterly inhuman. As he lifted the chest of drawers and slammed it against the wall, shattering the mirror, the chaos swept him away.</p><p>The sound of shattering glass tore through Delaney\u2019s eardrums as she lay, stuck to the bed, unable to open her eyes. Unable to move.</p><p>This is not happening. It is not happening!</p><p>Pieces of furniture crashed against one another, wood splintering, glass shattering. And she couldn\u2019t move to get out of the way.</p><p>She struggled to sit up, grinding her elbows into the mattress as she pushed with all her strength, but it was as if an invisible hand held her down.</p><p>Her mouth went dry. Good God, she had to get out of there.</p><p>What has he done to me?</p><p>He had to be using some kind of mind-control drug on her. Twice now, he\u2019d knocked her out. And just before he\u2019d put her to sleep the second time, she\u2019d had this strange urge to trust him. Mind control. With a sudden certainty, she knew he was no run-of-the-mill psychopath. There was more going on here. Much more.</p><p>But why experiment on a federal agent? Unless...</p><p>The answer, so obvious, chilled her to the marrow of her bones. She had access to information, to places, to people, most never would. He could turn her into the ultimate terrorists\u2019 weapon. Until her fellow agents killed her. Then he\u2019d simply kidnap another.</p><p>The ramifications reverberated through her head. The lives that would be lost. The lives he\u2019d force her to take.</p><p>I have to get out of here.</p><p>If she could escape before the drug fully wore off, while it was still in her blood, the lab might be able to identify it. They might be able to create an antidote. Or even find a way to duplicate it.</p><p>Except she couldn\u2019t escape. She couldn\u2019t even move!</p><p>He\u2019d lost it. Completely. Even before he\u2019d turned into Olaf the Berserker, she\u2019d felt it, as if the storm swirling inside him were visible.</p><p>Had he, too, been experimenting with the drug? Was that to be her destiny?</p><p>A new sound burst into the room. \u201cTighe!\u201d a man shouted as, closer by, strong arms lifted her.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get you out of here,\u201d a deeply masculine voice said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m all for that.\u201d</p><p>The man carried her from the destruction zone to lay her on what felt like a sofa in another room. \u201cAre you injured?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. He did something to me before he turned crazy. I can\u2019t move. I can\u2019t even open my eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInteresting. Stay here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what they all say,\u201d Delaney muttered, then lay there listening to the sound of fighting like nothing she\u2019d ever heard. Thudding, snarling, slashing. Like they\u2019d turned into animals or something. She wasn\u2019t sure if she was relieved or dismayed to learn there were more of them.</p><p>\u201cGet off me.\u201d Tighe\u2019s deep growl carried to where she lay. \u201cThe woman?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIs on the sofa.\u201d</p><p>Delaney blinked. She froze as her eyes went wide. She could open her eyes again. Halleluiah. As her gaze took in the small, unoccupied living room, she tried to sit up. Grunting and straining against the invisible hand, she managed to prop her elbows under her. Elation swam through her as she panted with exertion.</p><p>The drug was wearing off.</p> <p>\u201cIs she sleeping? Or dead?\u201d Tighe\u2019s voice carried from the bedroom.</p><p>\u201cUnharmed as far as I can tell, but she can\u2019t move. What did you do to her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got control of her, just not her mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEliminate her,\u201d a third, hard voice chimed in. Not the voice of the man who\u2019d carried her to safety. Not the voice of anyone she wanted to come face-to-face with without her Glock.</p><p>Again, she struggled to sit up, and like magic, was free. The drug had worn off!</p> <p>\u201cNo one\u2019s harming her.\u201d Tighe\u2019s voice. Yeah, Tighe. \u201cLeave. I\u2019ll see to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Delaney muttered under her breath as she swung off the sofa and crept to the door. \u201cI\u2019ll leave. I\u2019ll see to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re staying,\u201d said the man who\u2019d carried her out of the room.</p><p>\u201cNo you\u2019re not.\u201d Tighe\u2019s voice was too close. No longer in the bedroom. \u201cHell.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d spotted her.</p><p>Pulse racing, blood pounding in her ears, Delaney lunged for the door. Her hand closed around the knob, twisted and jerked hard, but the door opened only a couple of inches before slamming shut again. Tighe\u2019s overwhelming presence loomed over her from behind.</p> <p>She tried to whirl around, but he pressed her, face-first, against the door, his breath harsh in her ear.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t fear me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me go, Tighe. Please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t do that.\u201d He eased back a fraction, not so much that she could turn around, but enough that he was no longer laying his full weight against her. \u201cI\u2019m not going to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould have fooled me.\u201d</p><p>He grabbed her shoulders and turned her around, his expression grim as he appeared to stare down at her through the shades. \u201cWhere? Where did I hurt you?\u201d</p><p>She gasped as she got a good look at him despite the shadows. He was a mess. Good grief. His face and body were streaked with blood, his shirt nearly shredded. Yet she couldn\u2019t make out any injuries. No open, bleeding flesh. Not even any scratches to account for the blood.</p><p>Did that mean it wasn\u2019t his? Yet how could he not be harmed with his clothing in tatters? The soft fluttering in her head intensified, as if the angel wings were agitated by the sight of him. The sensation echoed in her chest. As if she were worried about him. As if whatever he\u2019d done to her made her think she cared.</p> <p>His hands tightened on her shoulders. \u201cWhere are you hurt, Delaney?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not, but I don\u2019t think I can say the same for you.\u201d</p><p>He glanced down at himself as if realizing for the first time what he looked like. \u201cI\u2019m fine. I didn\u2019t hurt you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Your friend got me out of there before you chucked any furniture my way.\u201d She stared at him. \u201cI guess he\u2019s your friend? Good grief, one of them nearly killed you.\u201d</p><p>Tighe grunted. \u201cThey look as bad as I do. And, yeah, they\u2019re my friends. They heard me destroying the place and came to offer a little well-timed intervention.\u201d He released her shoulder to stroke her hair. \u201cThank the goddess, I didn\u2019t hurt you.\u201d</p><p>She almost told him not to touch her hair, not to stroke her, but couldn\u2019t bring herself to utter the words. His touch felt good. As if he cared. At least as if he cared that he hadn\u2019t hurt her.</p><p>\u201cWas it the drugs that sent you...over the edge?\u201d she asked carefully.</p><p>He stilled. \u201cThe drugs?\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cRight. No drugs involved here. You just waved your magic wand and got control of me like that.\u201d</p><p>Oddly, the tension seemed to drain out of him. \u201cOh. That drug.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTighe, there\u2019s some nasty shit going on here,\u201d she said quietly, reaching for his face as if she meant to press her palm to his cheek. She snatched her hand back. Yet that fluttering in her head whispered that he needed her touch. He needed her.</p><p>She crossed her arms over her chest. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we both get out of here, Tighe? I can get you some help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d help me, would you, brown eyes?\u201d His thumb rose to stroke her cheek as if he had fluttering angel voices of his own telling him she needed him, too.</p><p>She didn\u2019t. Of course she didn\u2019t. Yet, heaven help her, something soft and weak inside her wanted to lean into that gentle touch. She steeled herself against the urge, but didn\u2019t pull away. He was clearly a violent man she didn\u2019t want to antagonize. Not when she was unarmed. But the truth was, she didn\u2019t want to pull away. Angel voices aside, there was something about this man that drew her, something more than the flaming attraction.</p><p>There was a gentleness in his touch and a warmth in his voice that made her want to step inside the circle of his arms and lean against him, drawing strength and maybe just a little bit of comfort.</p><p>Was it more evidence of mind control, or was this her doing alone? Maybe she was starting to suffer from Stockholm Syndrome, that tendency of captives to identify with and care for their captors. She wasn\u2019t sure which was more disturbing.</p><p>Or perhaps it was neither. Perhaps she was genuinely beginning to glimpse facets of a man who was more than he seemed.</p><p>His hand lifted, his fingers sliding into her hair, sending a soft shiver through her body. \u201cI\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t hurt you.\u201d</p><p>And, heaven help her, she believed him.</p><p>His thumb traced over her bottom lip, sending shards of excitement spiking into her blood. Her breath caught. She could feel his gaze on her mouth.</p><p>\u201cI want to kiss you, brown eyes, but I\u2019ve forced you enough.\u201d</p><p>His words sent rich, warm desire pouring through her, turning her breasts heavy and her body aching to feel his mouth on hers again even as they lent more credence to her belief that he might be more than he seemed. A man who wasn\u2019t evil but had definitely gotten himself tangled up in some nasty stuff.</p><p>She knew rationalizing when she heard it, even in her own head. She wanted him to kiss her.</p><p>\u201cYour friends...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre busy. And not going to bother us.\u201d</p><p>She made a wry twist with her mouth. \u201cAnd you don\u2019t care if they do.\u201d</p><p>He smiled, flashing a pair of sexy-as-hell dimples. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Ripples of need raced through her body, and she gave herself up to the desire, captured his strong face between her hands and pulled his mouth down to hers.</p><p>Some small part of her brain shouted that this was all part of the plan to get him to let his guard down, but the shout was quickly drowned out by the roar of pure, unadulterated passion.</p><p>Tighe shuddered and sucked in air through his nose as if trying to inhale her. His arms went around her and he pulled her against his chest as he captured her mouth in return.</p><p>The kiss exploded inside her, filling her with equal parts sweetness and crazy desire. She opened her mouth as he did, her tongue sliding sensuously against his. He tasted like he smelled, like rain and thunderstorms and wildness. Intoxicating.</p><p>Why? Why do I have to be so attracted to him?</p><p>His hands slid over her back as he slanted his mouth over hers, deepening the kiss.</p><p>Pain exploded in her head.</p><p>With a gasp, she pulled back.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d he asked sharply.</p><p>\u201cMy head. Headache. I need to lie down.\u201d Before she passed out again. This was the exact pain she\u2019d suffered in the parking garage. Not now. Not now.</p><p>Tighe cupped her face with his hands. The light pressure of his palms seemed to ease the pain.</p><p>\u201cThat helps,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cLincoln Memorial,\u201d Tighe called. \u201cI\u2019ll meet you over there.\u201d</p><p>She tried to open her eyes, to look at him in confusion. Had she blanked out after all? She seemed to have missed the other half of that conversation.</p><p>Through the haze of pain, she saw a pair of jeans and a shirt come sailing out the bedroom door.</p><p>\u201cChange before you bring the cops down on yourself,\u201d a disembodied voice called. \u201cAnd do something about the blood.\u201d</p><p>Tighe made a sound in his throat, that oddly animal-sounding growl, and released her. The pain in her head soared. She collapsed back against the door, pressing her hands to her cheeks, but her own hands didn\u2019t help.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t sure how long she\u2019d stood there, fighting back the waves of pain, when she felt Tighe\u2019s hand close around her wrist.</p><p>\u201cCome on, brown eyes. We\u2019re going for a drive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good idea.\u201d</p><p>But he opened the door and ushered her into the night, and she didn\u2019t have the strength to argue. She let him steer her into the passenger seat of a car, in no shape to fight him. She tipped her head back and closed her eyes, her only concern to stay conscious and keep her head on her shoulders until the awful thing passed.</p><p>Finally, finally, the pain began to recede. The headache disappeared, leaving her feeling shaky and cold. What was happening to her? The headache had felt like the kind she got before she saw the murders, but just like in the car, she\u2019d seen nothing this time. Which didn\u2019t please her in the least. If she had to suffer the pain, the least she could do was get a clue that might help her catch the killer.</p><p>Taking a deep breath, she opened her eyes to find Tighe pulling to an illegal stop near the Lincoln Memorial. He released her hand. She hadn\u2019t even remembered he was holding it.</p><p>\u201cGet out, brown eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are we doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy twin\u2019s here.\u201d</p><p>Her jaw dropped as he pushed from the car. She joined him, her mind scrambling and coming up with nothing that made any sense.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know he\u2019s here?\u201d</p><p>He grabbed her hand. \u201cCome on.\u201d</p><p>She ran to keep up with him as he headed toward the steps of the memorial, but they were still ten yards away when Tighe emitted another of those jungle growls, released her hand, and pulled out two wicked-looking switchblades in a single, quick move.</p><p>Delaney leaped back, watching with disbelief as he began stabbing the air. He was crazy. Completely and certifiably mad.</p><p>But as she stared, cuts began to appear on his cheeks and tears in his clothing as if from invisible claws.</p><p>Goose bumps rose on her skin as her head shook back and forth. She wasn\u2019t seeing this. It wasn\u2019t real. It was the drugs. She had to be hallucinating.</p><p>A dark shape above had her looking up as a huge bird of prey, a hawk, dropped out of the sky. For a terrible moment, she thought Tighe was going to turn those deadly knives on the bird, but he barely glanced at him. Instead, the bird began clawing at the air with talons and beak as if he, too, were battling an invisible enemy.</p><p>A moment later, a huge cat, a cougar, joined the fight, and she knew she had to be caught in one giant hallucinogen-induced dream.</p><p>God. Delaney backed away. She had to get out of there. But Tighe\u2019s words came back to her. My twin\u2019s here. If there was a chance she hadn\u2019t dreamed that, too, she had to at least look for him.</p><p>She ran for the steps to the memorial and started up, as desperate to get away from the impossible battle as she was to find the murderer who\u2019d nearly killed her.</p><p>With each step the question pounded in her brain.</p><p>What if I\u2019m the only crazy one?</p><p>Tighe stabbed at the draden, tearing them off him as he tore out their hearts by the dozen.</p><p>Dammit, I\u2019ve got to get behind cover and shift. Hawke\u2019s voice sounded in his head. Through the vicious swarm, Tighe could just make out the hawk, nearly covered in the ferocious little beasts. My wings are being shredded faster than I can heal.</p><p>Since when do they attack animals? Kougar growled mentally. The draden were all over him, too, going for his eyes. Unlike Tighe, the cougar had no hands with which to stab and swat them away. I\u2019m going to have to shift, too, but it\u2019s too well lit here.</p><p>The Lincoln Memorial was a glowing beacon on the D.C. nightscape, and even in the middle of the night, people were known to roam the National Mall.</p><p>Do it, Tighe said. What in the hell\u2019s going on, Hawke? Care to take a guess?</p><p>I think your clone\u2019s behind this. He was made from a draden. I\u2019m guessing he can communicate with them.</p><p>Tighe groaned inwardly. His own private army.</p><p>Your human\u2019s on the run, Kougar said.</p><p>Tighe turned. Delaney was running, all right. Straight up the steps of the Lincoln Memorial. She finally had a shot at freedom, and she was throwing it away to try to catch a murderer. Exactly what he was coming to expect from her, but the reality made his blood run cold.</p><p>He took off after her, a swarm of draden at his back, fear stabbing through his chest like a twelve-inch blade.</p><p>If that draden spawn of a clone of his was still up there, she\u2019d be dead before he ever reached her.</p><p>Chapter Eight</p><p>\u201cDelaney, wait!\u201d Tighe\u2019s voice echoed up from the base of the stairs.</p><p>Trust him, the angel wings whispered in her head.</p><p>Why she listened to either of them, she didn\u2019t know, but she was too rattled to fight the instinct to stop. Three-quarters of the way up the steps, Delaney doubled over to catch her breath as Tighe climbed to join her.</p><p>As he drew near, she saw he was a bloody mess again. Ghostly fingers crawled over her scalp as, deep in her head, the clanging bells of disbelief rang and rang and rang.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t ever go after him alone, brown eyes. He\u2019s too dangerous, in case you didn\u2019t learn that the first time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou seemed a little...preoccupied.\u201d But, jeez, she wasn\u2019t even armed. Either the whole situation had her badly shaken, or she really was losing her mind. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Tighe took her hand and kept climbing, all the while stabbing the air with the knife in his free hand. That didn\u2019t bother her nearly as much as the blood that was beginning to trickle down his cheek and neck from wounds that shouldn\u2019t be there.</p><p>Don\u2019t look. Just don\u2019t look.</p><p>Sweat was rolling down her temples, her breathing labored by the time she reached the top step of the memorial. As her gaze scanned the area, out of habit her hand went for her gun and closed around nothing. Blast it.</p> <p>Something caught her eye. A bare foot, facedown, poking out from behind one of the mammoth marble columns that framed the memorial.</p><p>\u201cThere,\u201d she told Tighe.</p><p>Together they ran, Delaney taking the path outside the pillars, Tighe running inside. They converged on another murder scene. She closed her eyes against the sight, then opened them again to study the bodies of a young couple, each partially undressed as if caught in the act of sex, now lying side by side, identical ovals of teeth marks on their necks.</p><p>Not far from them lay a female police officer. Had she heard the screams and come to investigate, only to meet with the same fate? It seemed probable. A wedding ring gleamed on her finger in the bright light of the memorial. She was married. Probably with kids, who would never see their mother again. Dammit.</p><p>\u201cDid you know her?\u201d</p> <p>She looked up to see Tighe watching her.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI\u2019m going to try to find him.\u201d</p><p>As Tighe kept walking, Delaney bent over the cop and checked for a pulse. Nothing, but her skin was still damp with sweat. Her murder, at least, had only just happened. She grabbed the woman\u2019s gun and slipped it into her back waistband, careful to cover it with her shirt hem.</p><p>How had Tighe known the murderer had been here? Was he, too, getting the visions?</p><p>As she crossed to the kids, she saw Tighe again fighting something, being injured by something, which wasn\u2019t there.</p> <p>Don\u2019t think about it.</p><p>She checked the young couple for pulses and again found none. The old fury welled up inside her at the waste of life. God, she wanted whoever had done this dead.</p><p>She saw Tighe turn and come back toward her, still stabbing the air, the blood running freely down his face now. He must be catching himself with those knives. That was the only explanation that made a bit of sense.</p><p>The gun weighed heavily against her back. If she wanted to shoot him, now was the time, when he was still far enough away that she stood a chance of getting the shot off before he stopped her. But the doubts had lodged too deeply in her head. That she might actually be the one with the mental problem.</p><p>As sirens began to sound on the wind, coming nearer, she let him close the distance between them without pulling her weapon.</p><p>His expression was tight. \u201cThose may be heading here.\u201d</p><p>Delaney nodded. \u201cThe cop has only been dead a matter of minutes. She probably called in the murders of the kids before he attacked her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, we\u2019re getting out of here.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLet me stay. Let me help the cops look for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a chance.\u201d He took her hand and gave her no choice as he ushered her down the long set of steps and into the car. Then he dove in on the driver\u2019s side, slammed the door, and continued to stab wildly at his invisible foe. A foe who couldn\u2019t possibly be in the car with them. Not unless he was the size of a fairy.</p><p>The man was crazy. Whether or not he was in league with the murderer, he was nuts. And the cops were on their way. She reached cautiously for the door handle and never touched it. One of his knives whipped out to within an inch of her face.</p><p>\u201cYou open that door, and it\u2019ll be the last thing you do.\u201d His voice was low and deadly.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Delaney slowly put her hand back in her lap, her breathing tight as she watched him slash at nothing. Her eyes widened as the gashes that appeared on his face out of thin air just as miraculously disappeared.</p><p>Okay, we\u2019re both crazy, right? No, they were both probably suffering from hallucinations, thanks to those drugs.</p><p>A couple of minutes later, Tighe stopped fighting and sank back against his seat, his breathing hard.</p><p>\u201cDid you win?\u201d she asked conversationally, pushing back the urge to close her eyes, cover her ears, and scream that this was not happening.</p><p>He turned his head toward her, his mouth opening as if he were about to reply, then closing again.</p><p>\u201cCare to tell me who you were fighting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot who.\u201d</p><p>Well, that was a point in his favor, since clearly no real person had been doing battle with him in the car.</p><p>\u201cThen what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not your concern.\u201d He straightened, his breathing already back to normal, and lifted his shirt to wipe the blood off his face. \u201cThey won\u2019t bother you.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him, another thought breaking through the bafflement and disbelief that had become her mind. What if he really had been battling something? Something she couldn\u2019t see. Some kind of cloaked, supersecret weapon.</p><p>Had she accidentally stumbled into the middle of something far bigger than a psychopathic serial killer and his sexy, drugged-up twin?</p><p>Tighe turned to her as if he were reading her thoughts. \u201cDon\u2019t try to figure it out, Delaney. Don\u2019t try to figure me out. You won\u2019t succeed. And if by some long shot you do, you\u2019ll only endanger yourself more.\u201d</p><p>Because then she really would know too much. A frisson of adrenaline pumped through her veins. She felt the gun at her back and wondered if she could bring herself to kill him. If she drew on him, she\u2019d better be ready to shoot, because she\u2019d only ever get one chance.</p><p>Her gaze studied his strong profile as he started the car and put it in gear.</p><p>No, she wasn\u2019t ready to kill him. If her theory was even partly right, that he was involved in something big and dangerous, she needed to know more. She needed all the information she could get if the Bureau was to have any chance of stopping it.</p><p>And, disturbingly, there was a part of her that wanted to believe the angel wings that continued to whisper, Trust him. There was a part of her that was genuinely drawn to him in ways beyond the sexual. His strength. His gentleness. He intrigued her mightily.</p><p>And yes, deep in her gut, she was starting to trust him.</p><p>As he drove, questions bombarded her brain. She tilted her head against the headrest behind her, watching him.</p><p>\u201cHow did you know your twin was here, Tighe?\u201d</p><p>He glanced at her. \u201cYou told me.\u201d</p><p>She jerked upright. \u201cI told you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw him in your vision.\u201d</p><p>Her scalp began to tingle. \u201cIn my vision?\u201d She\u2019d never told him about her visions. She\u2019d never told him anything. Was he reading her mind now? Could this night get any weirder? \u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you? I think you do, brown eyes.\u201d He glanced at her again. \u201cI was the one having the visions until you came along.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him, the hair rising on the back of her neck. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>He turned back to the road. \u201cMy twin and I have a psychic connection I don\u2019t entirely understand. When he first started killing, I was the one seeing the murders. I was the one watching those terrified faces as he went for their throats. Through his eyes, I saw the death of that blonde in the basement of the Potomac Side Apartments. A couple of minutes later, I saw him attack you. I thought he\u2019d killed you as he had her.\u201d</p><p>No way. Her mind rebelled, yet she stared at him, her attention riveted.</p><p>He glanced at her and met her gaze. \u201cBut my next vision wasn\u2019t of death. It was of you staring at yourself in the bathroom mirror at work. You wondered out loud why you were being forced to watch him kill others. One of your coworkers found you leaning on the sink, white as a ghost, and called your name. That\u2019s how I knew who you were.\u201d</p><p>Her head rang like a gong struck too hard. Yet everything he said was true. Everything correlated exactly with the events as she knew them.</p><p>\u201cYou think I\u2019ve come between you and your twin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you have, though I\u2019m not sure how. Something must have happened when he attacked you and didn\u2019t kill you. You\u2019ve disrupted our connection. Now when he murders, I sometimes see you watching the murder, and I sometimes get tiny glimpses of it myself. But so far, the only time I\u2019ve seen the whole thing since you got involved is the one time I held on to you while you got the vision.\u201d</p><p>She blinked. \u201cIn your house just now. You saw it instead of me, didn\u2019t you? You knew he was in the Lincoln Memorial killing those people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Tighe released a harsh sigh. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t get there in time to catch him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause something attacked you.\u201d She pressed her palms against the roof of the car. \u201cIs this for real, Tighe? Is this all happening, or am I seriously losing my grip on my sanity?\u201d</p><p>He reached over and gently squeezed her knee. \u201cI\u2019d like to tell you you\u2019re losing it. Or it\u2019s all a dream, or something equally inane. But you\u2019re not, brown eyes. You\u2019re perfectly sane. You\u2019ve just gotten in the middle of things you shouldn\u2019t have.\u201d He nodded toward her window. \u201cKeep your eyes peeled, Agent Randall. We may have missed him, but he could still be around here preparing to feed off someone else.\u201d</p><p>Delaney nodded, letting his words sink in. She wasn\u2019t insane, at least. Which was definitely something. Unfortunately, the deeper she got into this, the more convinced she became she was going to be lucky to get out of it alive.</p><p>She needed to trust her instincts and her instincts were screaming at her to trust him, to hold on to him and not let him go. Every instinct she possessed warned her that Tighe was her only chance of survival.</p><p>Tighe glanced at Delaney as he had every few minutes for the past couple of hours as they drove through the night streets of D.C. The woman drew him like a cat to cream, even in the dark where he could only glimpse her face in shadow. There was a depth to her that intrigued him. Alternating layers of strength and softness. Of fury and pain.</p><p>He was pretty sure he knew where the pain came from, but he wanted to know the whole story. He found himself wanting to know everything about her.</p><p>\u201cWas your mother a cop, brown eyes?\u201d</p><p>She turned toward him as the lights of a passing cab lit her face.</p><p>\u201cNo. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw your expression when you saw the dead cop. I thought maybe you\u2019d known her. Or that she reminded you of your mom.\u201d</p><p>Delaney sighed and tilted her head back against the seat as if exhaustion pulled at her. \u201cI saw her wedding ring. I\u2019d be willing to bet she had kids. My mom wasn\u2019t a cop, but I was eleven when I lost her. I hate the thought of any other kid going through that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me what happened. I heard you tell the cat in your apartment that a scumbag caught her on a bike path.\u201d He wasn\u2019t sure she\u2019d open up to him, but they\u2019d been traveling together in a comfortable silence for a while now. He found he wanted to understand her better.</p><p>\u201cHe raped her. Murdered her, while I was at school. I don\u2019t know any more than that. They never found the killer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry you lost her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a long time ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot so long. And you live with it every day of your life, don\u2019t you? It\u2019s why you became a federal agent. To catch the killers like the one who killed your mother. Maybe to catch him.\u201d</p><p>She turned back to him. Then slowly looked away. \u201cMaybe I am a little obsessed,\u201d she said softly. \u201cBut, blast it, Tighe, people like that need to be stopped.\u201d She swung back to look at him. \u201cHow dare he steal her life? And not just hers. Mine. He took everything from me that day. Everything.\u201d</p><p>Tighe slid his hand over her shoulder and gave a squeeze. \u201cJust don\u2019t devote so much of your life to revenge that you forget to live it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not revenge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it, brown eyes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s...a calling. I hate the killers. All of them.\u201d She groaned. \u201cIt is revenge, isn\u2019t it? Every time there\u2019s a murder, I wonder if it\u2019s the same guy. If maybe this time I\u2019ll get him.\u201d</p><p>She was silent for more than a minute, as if pondering that realization. Finally, she shrugged. \u201cWho cares why I do it? It\u2019s my job, and I\u2019m good at it.\u201d</p><p>He squeezed her shoulder. \u201cWhat happened after your mom died? Did your dad raise you?\u201d</p><p>She gave a soft sound of disgust. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>That single word held a stunning wealth of emotion, emotions that trailed across his tongue. Anger. Hurt. And a deep, painful betrayal he knew the taste of all too well.</p><p>\u201cMy dad decided he couldn\u2019t handle being a single parent. Five days after I lost my mother, he ripped me away from everything I\u2019d ever known\u2014home, friends, school, my cat\u2014and dumped me on my aunt\u2019s doorstep, more than two hours away. I guess in his messed-up logic it was the perfect solution. I needed a mother, and she needed help. She was single with four small children. Only I didn\u2019t get a mother. I got a full-time, unpaid job. I became her babysitter, cook, housekeeper, you name it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCinderella,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>She made a sound. \u201cBelieve me, I thought that at least ten times a day. Which was ridiculous, of course. I wasn\u2019t abused, at least...Yeah, anyway.\u201d</p><p>Tighe looked over at her. Her abrupt silence was loaded. He reached over and stroked her hair. \u201cI\u2019d like to hear it all. Though I don\u2019t want to cause you more pain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not...I mean...\u201d She took a deep breath and let it out slowly. \u201cMy aunt\u2019s boyfriend moved in with us when I was sixteen.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ah, hell. He was afraid he knew what was coming.</p><p>\u201cHe managed to keep his hands off me for all of five months, but he watched me. I knew he watched me. He finally made a move two days after my seventeenth birthday.\u201d</p><p>His hand clenched the steering wheel, the strength of his anger catching him by surprise. \u201cHe hurt you.\u201d</p> <p>She met his gaze, steel in her eyes. \u201cNo. He groped me and tried to kiss me. I ripped open his cheek with my fingernails, then slammed my fist in his eye.\u201d A glimmer of satisfaction arced through her expression.</p><p>Tighe grinned, a vicious smile. \u201cGood girl.\u201d He tensed. \u201cDid he retaliate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot directly. My aunt kicked me out that night and told me never to come back. I don\u2019t know what he told her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou went back to your dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I hadn\u2019t seen him in years, not since I was thirteen. He came to see me a few times after he left me with my aunt, but I wouldn\u2019t talk to him. I was furious with him for deserting me.\u201d She groaned. \u201cI was such a brat.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo you weren\u2019t. Your anger toward him was deserved. If a man\u2019s blessed with a daughter, he protects her. No matter what.\u201d His grip on the wheel tightened as a sharp pain lanced his heart.</p><p>Yet he was no better than Delaney\u2019s father. How long had Amalie cried for him? How long had she hated him?</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Delaney said softly. \u201cI never forgave him. Maybe if I had, he\u2019d have been there for me later.\u201d</p><p>He looked over at her. \u201cWhat did you do? Seventeen is young to be on your own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got a job waiting tables and rented a room from a lady down the street. After high school, I worked my way through college, my sights firmly on getting the man who\u2019d ruined my life and all the others like him. Revenge.\u201d She yawned deeply. \u201cAs you said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re exhausted.\u201d He patted his right thigh. \u201cLie down, brown eyes. Get some sleep.\u201d He was suddenly glad he\u2019d grabbed the larger of the sedans, with its bench seat.</p> <p>She glanced at him, a smile hovering at her mouth. \u201cThat sounds like a line if I ever heard one. And I\u2019m too tired to care.\u201d Leaning sideways, she stretched out along the seat to lay her head firmly in his lap. \u201cI don\u2019t know why I\u2019m starting to trust you,\u201d she murmured sleepily. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He stroked her hair. \u201cThanks for not using that gun on me.\u201d</p><p>She groaned in disgust, drawing a chuckle out of him, but didn\u2019t move to reach for the weapon. Within seconds her breathing evened out, and he knew she was asleep.</p><p>He stroked her arm, feeling a warmth toward her, a protectiveness, he didn\u2019t understand. She was a human. Yet he didn\u2019t remember the last time he\u2019d felt this close to another. Any other.</p><p>Human or not, she was a remarkable woman. Determined and driven. Tough and courageous. But not without compassion. He\u2019d seen her expression when they\u2019d come upon the three bodies less than a dozen yards from the statue of Abraham Lincoln. She\u2019d seen more than bodies. More than victims. She\u2019d seen two lovers terrorized and destroyed. And a wife, possibly a mother, who would never go home to her family.</p><p>He\u2019d tasted Delaney\u2019s fury over the wasteful destruction of life. Yes, she might have been driven to this job of hers out of revenge, but it was a deep compassion for life that kept her dedicated.</p><p>He\u2019d have to remember to tell her that. He brushed back a lock of hair that was trying to fall across her cheek, then lifted it and ran the softness between his fingers.</p><p>Inexplicably, Delaney Randall had begun to matter to him. He wanted her safe and able to live her short, fragile life to its utmost. With all the things she\u2019d missed, and still missed. A home. A family. A cat.</p> <p>The thought made him smile, but his thoughts turned wistful. He sensed a large capacity for love in her, and he wished that for her. Children of her own and a man who would stand by her side no matter what, and love her as she deserved to be loved.</p><p>The tiger raised its head deep inside him, a growl rumbling in his throat.</p><p>Yeah, the thought of her in another man\u2019s arms didn\u2019t please him either. But he certainly didn\u2019t want her for himself. She was human.</p><p>And if she wasn\u2019t?</p><p>He shook off the weirdly disturbing thought and turned his attention once more to hunting for his clone.</p><p>Several hours later, as the sun rose behind overcast skies, Hawke called.</p><p>\u201cAny luck?\u201d the Feral asked.</p><p>\u201cNone. Not a sign of him. But no more visions. Which either means he hasn\u2019t fed yet, or Delaney doesn\u2019t get them in her sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re back in the safe house, looking for a little sleep ourselves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to drive around a bit longer.\u201d He snapped the phone closed. As tired and hungry as he was, he couldn\u2019t bring himself to call it quits. Admittedly, he was loath to take Delaney back to the safe house with Kougar and Hawke there. And she was sleeping so soundly, he didn\u2019t want to wake her.</p><p>He stroked her hair as he had a hundred times over the past hours. But the real truth was, holding her like this, with her fragile head tucked against him, eased his battered soul the way nothing else had.</p><p>The tiger purred with satisfaction, a fact he might have found a tad disturbing if he weren\u2019t too tired to think about it. The tiger rarely paid any attention to the women he was with.</p><p>He glanced into the rearview mirror, lifting his sunglasses to look at his eyes. Yesterday, for the first time, he\u2019d noticed a black streak across one of his irises, slicing through the green like the shadow from a lightning bolt. Today, there were several across each. He didn\u2019t know what it meant\u2014Hawke hadn\u2019t either\u2014but he had a sick feeling it wasn\u2019t good.</p><p>An hour later, when the rumbling of his stomach became so loud he was afraid he was going to wake half of D.C., he turned the car toward Capitol Hill and the safe house.</p><p>Minutes later, Delaney jerked in her sleep, then moaned with pain. \u201cNot again.\u201d</p><p>Tighe pressed a hand to her forehead as she lay on his lap. A vision roared into his head, knocking the breath from him as it punched him in the gut.</p><p>This bastard needed to die.</p><p>Chapter Nine</p><p>The scene flashed into Tighe\u2019s inner vision.</p><p>As before, it didn\u2019t steal his sight as the visions did when they were his alone. Instead, he continued to see the street before him clearly. He watched the two scenes as though through two separate pairs of eyes.</p><p>A young woman lay on the floor, her eyes filled with terror as she struggled to remove the gag from her mouth. Hands that weren\u2019t Tighe\u2019s held her down.</p><p>\u201cDo you know who I am?\u201d the clone hissed in the woman\u2019s ear.</p><p>The woman shook her head frantically.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the D.C. Vampire.\u201d</p><p>Tighe\u2019s stomach clenched. The bastard knew exactly what was going on. He must be holed up somewhere watching the news between attacks, a hugely disturbing thought because the clone was definitely past the stage of being merely a feeding machine. He was thinking. Plotting. Learning. And that was not good news.</p><p>The woman\u2019s eyes went impossibly wide with terror. Precisely what his clone intended, Tighe realized. Why else had he told her what the news media was calling him? He wanted her afraid. He was feeding off her fear.</p><p>Definitely evolving. An unthinking animal would feed the simplest way possible. In this case, by stealing raw life force, draining his victim. Feeding from fear took more finesse. More cunning. Something his clone was clearly developing.</p><p>Not good. Not good at all.</p><p>Delaney\u2019s hand moved to cover his, holding it tight against her forehead. \u201cDon\u2019t let go,\u201d she pleaded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow does your touch help, Tighe? How do you ease the pain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure, but I suspect it\u2019s all part of your getting in the way of my connection with my twin. When I touch you, I\u2019m able to access the vision your brain is trying to shut out, completing that connection. The pressure in your head eases.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat makes sense,\u201d she murmured. \u201cAnd yet no sense at all. People are not electrical circuits. None of this should be happening.\u201d</p><p>If she only knew. She\u2019d only glimpsed the tip of what would appear to her human eyes to be a very large and terrifying iceberg. He prayed to the goddess she never saw the rest. The terror in her eyes would be more than he could stand. In his current state, he\u2019d be flung into the chaos for good.</p><p>In that other place, the demon grabbed his captive\u2019s arms, breaking one, then the other as she screamed.</p><p>\u201cCan you see this?\u201d he asked Delaney.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He stilled as the clone\u2019s sights turned to a playpen filled with three wide-eyed toddlers. Rage tore through him as the monster closed the distance between them.</p><p>Behind the clone, Tighe could hear the injured woman\u2019s whimpers turn to outrage as the clone reached down and picked up one of the little ones, lifting her chubby neck to his mouth.</p><p>Tighe groaned. \u201cSweet goddess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s he doing?\u201d Delaney asked, her voice tight with pain.</p><p>\u201cHe broke her arms. Now he\u2019s killing her babies. As she watches.\u201d</p><p>Delaney moaned, curling in on herself as if she\u2019d taken a punch to the stomach. \u201cWe have to get him.\u201d</p><p>The devil who wore his face tossed the tiny, lifeless body aside with a thud and turned to pick up another as the woman\u2019s muffled and horrified cries rang in Tighe\u2019s ears.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know where he is. Wait.\u201d As the clone fed on the second child, his gaze turned toward the window. \u201cCapitol Springs Apartments are across the street.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCapitol Springs. I know that area.\u201d A thread of excitement laced her voice. \u201cIt\u2019s on East Capitol. Around 6th or 7th.\u201d</p><p>He released Delaney long enough to pull out his cell phone and give the address to Hawke. Second by second, he felt her body tensing as her pain burned across his tongue. He snapped the phone closed, tossed it onto the dash, and covered her forehead again with his palm.</p><p>Her pained sigh tore at him. Somehow he had to free her from these things. For her, now, more than himself.</p><p>\u201cAre your friends going to meet us there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but you won\u2019t see them.\u201d Hawke would probably shift and go by air. They\u2019d both beat him there. He\u2019d wandered far afield in his driving.</p><p>Hopefully, he wouldn\u2019t need to get in touch with Hawke. Once the Feral shifted, neither he nor Kougar would be able to communicate with him until they got closer. And out of the car. The magic shielding that kept the draden from penetrating the car windows kept the Ferals from communicating telepathically when one of them was in his animal form. Which was the only time they could communicate that way.</p><p>The woman\u2019s cries increased exponentially as the clone picked up the last child, a small boy. Tighe knew instinctively, the boy was the only one who was hers. Even through the gag, he recognized the unique sound of a parent\u2019s pain.</p><p>As he was forced to stop behind a line of traffic caught at the light, the clone tossed the third small body onto the floor and turned to the grief-stricken mother. This is why he had to get his soul back! Not only to stop this creature from killing, but to help find that Daemon blade so this scene didn\u2019t play out a thousand times a day. Every day. All over the world, as it would if the Daemons were ever freed again.</p><p>Thunder. He slammed his hand against the steering wheel. The Ferals didn\u2019t have the power to defeat the Daemons a second time. They\u2019d sacrificed too much to imprison them the first time.</p><p>Delaney turned her head to look up at him, and he met her pained gaze, feeling his soul sink into her dark eyes and, for a moment, heal. \u201cIs he still killing children?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. They\u2019re dead. He\u2019s turning on the mother now.\u201d</p><p>Abruptly, the clone stopped.</p><p>\u201cHow far are we?\u201d Delaney asked, still watching him.</p><p>\u201cTen minutes. Maybe less.\u201d</p><p>The clone turned away from the woman and moved to kneel beside the lifeless body of the last child. Tighe\u2019s stomach rolled as he realized what the clone was doing. With a lighter, he set fire to the boy\u2019s dinosaur tee shirt. Then with an even, purposeful stride, he walked to the apartment door and opened it.</p><p>\u201cThree thirty-one. He was in apartment 331, but he\u2019s leaving. Dammit. I\u2019ve got to tell Kougar.\u201d</p><p>Tighe reached for his phone, where he\u2019d tossed it onto the dash, but couldn\u2019t get it without crushing Delaney against the steering wheel. \u201cBrown eyes, I need my phone. Can you reach it for me?\u201d</p><p>As she rose slowly, he kept his palm against her forehead. \u201cWhere? Oh, I see it.\u201d She pulled it off the dash.</p><p>Delaney held the phone in front of him, but to take it he had to release her.</p><p>\u201cSpeed dial five for me. When a man answers, tell him apartment three three one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTighe says apartment three three one.\u201d A moment later she snapped, \u201cGo to hell,\u201d and closed the phone.</p><p>Damn Kougar. \u201cWhat did he say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said he told you to kill me.\u201d</p><p>Tighe sighed. \u201cHe figured it was the easiest way to free you from the visions.\u201d</p><p>The sound that came from her throat was half laugh, half moan. \u201cIf this keeps up much longer, I may ask for that cure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHang on, brown eyes. No one\u2019s ending your life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat assurance would have made me happier before the little guys with the jackhammers set up the construction zone in my brain.\u201d</p><p>The vision faded.</p><p>Delaney sighed, the tension easing from her tightly strung body. \u201cIs it over?\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparently. At least for now. I have a feeling he set that fire for a reason.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHe set a fire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He didn\u2019t see any need to burden her with where.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got to call the fire department.\u201d</p> <p>She pushed herself up and he released her, sorry to have to let her go. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Thanks to you.\u201d She picked up his phone and pressed 911. \u201cIs there a return policy on these visions I accidentally stole from you because I would happily give them back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI may be able to free you of them. That\u2019s what I was trying to do when I inadvertently started to control you.\u201d</p><p>She threw him a wary look that said she didn\u2019t understand what he was talking about and wasn\u2019t sure she wanted to know.</p><p>But her sigh was one of exhaustion. \u201cAs soon as we get back to your place, you have my permission to muck around in my head all you want. Just get me free of these things.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou got it.\u201d</p><p>As she called in the fire, he found the building and pulled up in front. Sure enough, smoke was already beginning to curl from one of the open windows.</p><p>Tighe tossed Delaney the car keys. \u201cWait for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, right.\u201d</p><p>As he opened his door, she jumped out, pulling the gun he\u2019d seen her take from the cop, as she ran for the building. Hell. Tighe raced after her. There was no way he was going to be able to talk her into staying outside. Any more than she\u2019d talk him into it.</p><p>He pushed past the frightened residents rushing out the front door, following Delaney, who was threading her way through the crowd. He forced his way in and was heading for the stairs when he heard Hawke call, \u201cStripes!\u201d The lean, dark-haired warrior crossed the foyer to his side.</p> <p>\u201cYou catch him?\u201d Tighe asked.</p><p>\u201cNo. No sign of him anywhere. Neither of us can sense him. Either he\u2019s fled the scene, or he\u2019s lost his draden smell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe latter. The son of a bitch set that fire just to create fear so he can feed off it. No way would he leave now. He\u2019s here somewhere, feasting on the terror.</p><p>Hawke nodded. \u201cThat explains it, then. Kougar found the apartment and said it was the source of the fire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the woman?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was no one alive in there.\u201d</p><p>Crap. \u201cFind Kougar and cover the exits. I\u2019m going to try to flush him out. Delaney\u2019s with me.\u201d</p><p>Hawke lifted a brow but said nothing.</p> <p>Tighe started up the open stairs, pushing past frantic residents. Children cried. People shouted, calling for one another. As he breached the throng on the landing and started up the second flight, he saw the woman from the vision and felt a quick, sharp empathy for her and relief that she, at least, had survived. Another woman had her arms around her hunched shoulders as she cradled both arms against her body.</p><p>Fury stirred at her unnecessary suffering.</p><p>The woman looked up, her eyes dazed until they landed on him. Stark terror flared in her eyes as a strangled scream wobbled from her throat.</p><p>The sight of terror directed at him from a woman\u2019s eyes slammed him with memory, igniting his fury. Gretchen, you should have known.</p><p>Deep inside him, the chaos leaped, wrenching him back to the present.</p><p>No. I can\u2019t go feral. Not here. Not now.</p><p>Tighe tore his gaze away from the woman\u2019s terrified face as he pushed as far to the right as he could. Keeping others between them, he ran past her and up the stairs. But he was losing the battle, that inner rage riding him, clamoring to be set free.</p><p>His fingers began to tingle. His teeth ached.</p><p>No! He wouldn\u2019t lose it. Not when he was so close to finding his clone. Not with Delaney here.</p><p>He pushed through the crowd in a growing panic as his claws slowly unsheathed. He couldn\u2019t lose it here. He couldn\u2019t lose it here.</p><p>At the top of the stairs, he saw an open doorway and dove through. With his last ounce of free will, he no longer fought the imminent change, but rode it through the feral, straight to the tiger as he shifted into his animal.</p><p>Only in his animal form could he call for help, unless one of his friends had already shifted.</p><p>With a surge of relief and joy, the change swept over him, and he raised his beast\u2019s head to the ceiling and let out one long, rumbling growl.</p><p>To his surprise, the storm inside him began to abate. He apparently had better control in his tiger form than his human. Until a woman\u2019s scream had him swinging toward the open door. A woman stared at him in horror, as a man grabbed her shoulders and pushed her past.</p><p>Wildness clawed at his control all over again. Fury leaping to be set free.</p><p>They\u2019re running from a tiger, his logical mind roared. Any sane human would be terrified.</p><p>In his animal form, he managed what he hadn\u2019t been able to in his human form and slowly beat back the chaos. Before he shifted back to human, he took advantage of his tiger\u2019s ability to scent draden. But he smelled nothing but humans. And smoke.</p><p>He called to his friends. Any sign of him?</p><p>None. Hawke\u2019s voice. We\u2019ve got the exits covered as best we can with only two of us.</p><p>Good. Delaney\u2019s in here somewhere. I\u2019m going to try to send her out. Keep an eye on her. Do not let Kougar near her.</p><p>I\u2019ll do my best.</p><p>Tighe shifted back into his human form, then ran into the hall to search for Delaney. If she had to face that clone again, she was doing it with him at her side.</p><p>Chapter Ten</p><p>Delaney stumbled down the hallway from apartment 331, her lungs sore and burning from coughing. Her nostrils fried from the stench of burning flesh. Her heart aching. Dear God, he\u2019d burned the children.</p><p>In the hallway, the air was quickly filling with smoke. Even if Tighe\u2019s twin were here, she wasn\u2019t sure she\u2019d see him.</p><p>A figure appeared at the top of the stairs. Her heart lurched at the familiar sight. Tighe or the killer? But the angel wings in her head fluttered with pleasure, and she knew it was Tighe. But at the sight of him, at the thought of what she\u2019d just done, her stomach spasmed with guilt. She\u2019d just gotten off the phone with Phil. FBI SWAT was on its way.</p><p>\u201cDid you...find him?\u201d she asked, coughing.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He quickly closed the distance between them, his hands going to her shoulders. \u201cGet outside, brown eyes. You need some fresh air.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got to find him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe do. My men are watching the back of the apartment. I need you to cover the front while I flush him out.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t ready to leave, yet. SWAT or no SWAT, this was her investigation, dammit, but she was coughing badly. And Tighe was barely coughing at all. The smoke hardly seemed to be getting to him. Maybe she should leave him to root out his twin while she sought out fresh air. She\u2019d heard and felt his reactions during this latest attack. There was no doubt in her mind he\u2019d been as horrified by his twin\u2019s savageness as she was. God knew, he should be, but the certainty that he had been only confirmed those instincts of hers that kept insisting he was a good man. A good man who would almost certainly get caught and hauled in for questioning once SWAT arrived. Unless she warned him.</p><p>She coughed harder, her eyes and throat burning from the smoke. But warning him went against everything she believed in as an FBI agent.</p><p>Tighe gave her a gentle push toward the stairs. \u201cGo watch the front, Delaney. Get out of here before I have to carry you out.\u201d</p><p>Coughing too hard even to answer him, she nodded and turned away. He needed to be taken in for questioning. Whatever else Tighe was, he was dangerous. And involved up to his well-muscled shoulders in this case, her case. At the very least, he\u2019d kidnapped and drugged a federal agent. Honest, everyday citizens didn\u2019t do things like that. They didn\u2019t have access to weapons like mind-control drugs.</p><p>He had to be apprehended. She knew that. Yet there was a part of her that felt like she\u2019d betrayed him.</p><p>Thank God she wasn\u2019t weak enough to listen.</p><p>Tighe systematically broke down one door after another on the floor where the fire started, searching for the clone and finding nothing. Not even any people. At least the humans were smart enough to flee. He was all too afraid his clone was way too smart now to wait for Tighe. Why fight when he could slip away unnoticed?</p><p>Frustration ate at Tighe\u2019s nerves, and he pushed it back. He couldn\u2019t afford to shift again. Not when the firefighters would be here any moment and he still hadn\u2019t found his quarry.</p><p>When he\u2019d gone through every apartment on the third floor, he started down the stairs to search the second. A heavyset woman with a cane was struggling to climb up. Under her breath, she was crying, \u201cMy baby, my baby.\u201d</p><p>The smoke was already thick on the third floor. She had no business going up there. He told himself it wasn\u2019t his business. He told himself he didn\u2019t care.</p><p>\u201cMa\u2019am, you need to go downstairs. The fire\u2019s spreading and the firefighters are going to need to get through.\u201d</p><p>She turned a tear-streaked face to him, desperation in her eyes. \u201cMy baby\u2019s up there. I left her alone for just a few minutes. She can\u2019t get out the door. She\u2019s only three.\u201d</p><p>Three. He remembered Amalie at that age. So demanding and bossy for such a tiny thing, yet he\u2019d gladly been her slave and lackey. He\u2019d have done anything for the daughter he\u2019d loved more than his own life. Anything.</p><p>The woman pushed herself onto the next highest step. \u201cShe\u2019s crying for her mama. I know she\u2019s crying. I\u2019ve got to get her.\u201d</p><p>He told himself they were humans. He didn\u2019t care.</p><p>\u201cWhich apartment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFour thirty-one.\u201d</p><p>Hell. She was directly above the fire. It might already be too late. \u201cGo down. Hurry. I\u2019ll get her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait! The key.\u201d</p><p>She handed him her apartment key and Tighe palmed it, then turned and ran. Three years old.</p><p>Amalie. Her face swam in his mind\u2019s eye as he\u2019d last seen her. Crying, her face streaked with tears as her small arms reached for him, clawing the arms that bound her in her desperation to get back to him.</p><p>And he\u2019d turned away.</p><p>Ah, goddess. Amalie.</p><p>They were so tiny at that age. So fragile. How long could small, mortal lungs breathe such smoke? How long before the fire burned through the floor and sent this child tumbling into the flames?</p><p>She needed him.</p><p>How many times had Amalie needed him? How many times had she cried out for him, and he wasn\u2019t there to hear her?</p><p>How many times?</p><p>Delaney watched the chaos in helpless frustration. What if Tighe doesn\u2019t give himself up when the FBI arrives? What if they shoot him?</p><p>A bloodcurdling scream went up to her left, and she feared her worries were coming all too true as she quickly sought its source. Her gaze found the one screaming, a woman holding badly misshapen arms against her body. Delaney followed the woman\u2019s line of sight and froze.</p><p>The woman was staring at Tighe. Except...he wasn\u2019t Tighe. He was dressed in the same navy blue shirt and too-short khakis she\u2019d seen him in when he attacked her in the laundry room. And he wasn\u2019t wearing shades. Even from this distance she could feel the coldness in him that brought back nightmarish memories of the attack. A cold that was not Tighe\u2019s.</p><p>Goose bumps lifted on her flesh. There were two of them. Just as Tighe had said. And she was staring at the murderer. Hatred curled in her gut as she pulled her weapon and started running. The killer looked up as she came toward him. He was near the corner of the apartment building, standing among more than a dozen agitated residents waiting for the fire trucks.</p><p>\u201cFBI!\u201d she choked out, coughing. \u201cFreeze!\u201d</p><p>He ducked behind the other residents, and she lost sight of him. Blast it.</p><p>The guy was not getting away this time. If she had to empty the chamber in his head to stop him, she\u2019d do it.</p><p>But when she reached the group, he wasn\u2019t there. And there was no way a man his and Tighe\u2019s size could easily hide. She took off around the corner, but could see no sign of him, so she kept running. By the time she was three-quarters of the way around the apartment complex, her lungs felt like they\u2019d been rubbed raw with gravel.</p><p>She doubled over, coughing, desperately trying to catch her breath. She\u2019d lost him. How in the world had she lost a man who had to be over six-six? Did he go back inside? Or was he long gone by now?</p><p>Pushing herself to keep going, she rounded the corner to find the street clogging with fire trucks, police cars, and two SWAT vans.</p><p>The gang\u2019s all here.</p><p>Except Tighe\u2019s twin had almost certainly escaped. Tighe was the only one they\u2019d get. But he had to be apprehended. They had to figure out who he was, who he worked for, and what he knew.</p><p>She knew that, accepted it. She was an FBI agent, first and foremost. Her loyalty was to the Bureau alone.</p><p>But she couldn\u2019t help feeling the sick guilt of betrayal.</p><p>Tighe raced down the smoky hallway, alive with the screech of smoke alarms, to apartment 431. Inserting the key, he pushed open the door to the sound of a child\u2019s coughing and crying.</p><p>\u201cCome, little one,\u201d he called softly in a voice he\u2019d once reserved for Amalie alone. \u201cI\u2019ll take you to your mother.\u201d</p><p>A small shape flew across the floor to him and he swept her into his arms. Not Amalie. Black hair, not blond. Dark skin, not pale. Not Amalie.</p><p>But as her small arms wrapped around his neck he was swamped by memories of sweetness and loss. Not in six hundred years had he held a child in his arms.</p><p>Cradling the small, coughing body against him, he ran for the stairs as pain that he\u2019d thought long buried swept over him in a blinding torrent.</p><p>He barely noticed the stairwell flying past until he heard a woman\u2019s glad cry echoing from below.</p><p>\u201cJensie! Baby!\u201d</p><p>The little girl stirred in his arms and began to cry. \u201cMomma.\u201d Her cry dissolved into a fit of coughing. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh, baby, I\u2019m so sorry. So sorry.\u201d The woman had stopped halfway down the final flight of stairs.</p><p>\u201cGet outside!\u201d Tighe called to her. \u201cWe\u2019re right behind you.\u201d</p><p>Through the front windows of the apartment building, Tighe could see the flashing lights of fire trucks, yet the firefighters had yet to race into the building. What was taking them so damn long? What if there were others trapped like this child had been?</p> <p>Thunder. Since when did he care what happened to humans?</p><p>The hobbling woman finally reached the lobby and made her way to the front door, Tighe and the child close behind her. The moment they were outside, the woman held out her arms. Tighe had to force himself to release the little girl, but he did, allowing her to dive into her mother\u2019s arms.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d The woman\u2019s eyes shone with tears. \u201cYou\u2019re an angel.\u201d</p><p>Tighe nodded, uncomfortable with the praise and still reeling from the barrage of raw, painful memories.</p><p>Tighe. Look out!</p> <p>Hawke\u2019s voice sounded in his head at the same instant his warrior\u2019s instincts caught the quick, furtive movements and the glint of metal.</p><p>\u201cFreeze! FBI!\u201d</p><p>The child had distracted him. He\u2019d walked right into a trap. A trap set, no doubt, by a woman with dark fathomless eyes.</p><p>Six armed SWAT members ran at him from both sides.</p><p>\u201cHands in the air!\u201d</p><p>Behind the men, he saw her. Delaney stood, watching him, her jaw set, a plea in her eyes. To what? Forgive her? Give up? Like hell.</p> <p>The last thing he could afford to do was get trapped by human law enforcement. He turned and ran back into the smoky building as two shots rang out behind him. One hit him in the thigh. The other went straight through his heart.</p><p>Jesus. He\u2019d survive it. If he could get to a healer...in time.</p><p>He stumbled down the hall and fell through the first open doorway, shifting into his tiger. No. He couldn\u2019t remain a tiger.</p><p>Hawke. I\u2019m heart-shot.</p><p>Where are you?</p><p>First-floor apartment. Second or third on the right. Not sure. Fading fast, buddy.</p><p>We\u2019ll get you. Hang on.</p><p>Using what strength he could gather, he managed to change his form once more, to that of a house cat. He lay there, his feline eyes glazed, his chest on fire from the gunshot, yet aching in an entirely different way.</p> <p>Amalie\u2019s tear-streaked face faded to be replaced by the face of another female, a woman with hard warrior\u2019s eyes. She\u2019d slept in his lap and said she was beginning to trust him, yet clearly she never really had. He\u2019d known it. He\u2019d been a fool to turn his back on her.</p><p>She\u2019d won this battle, but the war between them was far from over.</p><p>If he lived long enough to fight another day.</p><p>Delaney clutched her chest as she watched the blood bloom on Tighe\u2019s retreating back, right at the level of his heart.</p><p>Blast it. Blast it.</p><p>He shouldn\u2019t have run!</p><p>Blast it, Tighe.</p><p>\u201cWas he the one?\u201d Phil asked, coming to stand beside her.</p><p>\u201cHe wasn\u2019t the killer, but the brother. The killer may still be inside, though he\u2019s probably long gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got the building surrounded. The fire will flush him soon enough if he\u2019s still in there. As soon as we haul the brother out, we\u2019re letting the fire department in, or they\u2019ll never get the blaze contained.\u201d</p><p>A tall dark-haired man with sharply arched brows pushed his way through the front doors, a dead cat in his arms. An orange-striped tabby that looked a lot like the one she\u2019d been talking to in her apartment. Right before she realized Tighe was there.</p><p>Her teeth clenched beneath the force of her anger. Damn Tighe. He\u2019d chosen death over interrogation. And just what did that say about his lack of innocence? Plenty.</p><p>Tears burned her eyes, and she blinked them back harshly. He\u2019d kidnapped her. He\u2019d drugged her. He was one of the bad guys. She was being ridiculous to care what happened to him.</p><p>But she did care. He was a complex man. Without a doubt, he went beyond the law, but she didn\u2019t believe he was evil. Not evil.</p><p>He\u2019d shown her more tenderness, more care, than anyone since her mom died. And the passion...</p><p>She turned, pretending to scrutinize the area as she swiped away a traitorous tear before her boss saw it.</p><p>Tighe shouldn\u2019t have died like this. But, dammit, it was his own fault. If he\u2019d allowed himself to be taken in, this wouldn\u2019t have happened.</p><p>She fought back the emotions, struggling to pull her FBI persona around her like a sturdy, comfortable cloak. When she turned back to Phil, no tears glistened in her eyes. Despite her less than professional attire, she was Agent Randall through and through.</p><p>\u201cI need a blood sample taken, Phil, ASAP.\u201d</p><p>Phil\u2019s brows drew together with worry. \u201cWhat happened, Delaney? You\u2019re not here by accident.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a long story.\u201d</p><p>Phil\u2019s expression turned grave. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think so.\u201d She ran not-quite-steady fingers through her tangled, smoky-smelling hair. \u201cThere\u2019s more going on here than a madman with a penchant for killing. I was kidnapped and drugged.\u201d It sounded so sinister, yet he\u2019d never hurt her. Instead, he\u2019d given her such pleasure. Delaney sighed. \u201cThe sooner we get a blood sample, the better the chance the lab can figure out what he used on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take you to the lab myself.\u201d His gaze went back to the building. \u201cWhat in the hell is taking them so long? I saw the bullet pierce his chest. There\u2019s no way he\u2019s still walking.\u201d</p><p>As Phil ushered her toward his car, her stomach cramped, and she feared she was going to be sick. She shouldn\u2019t feel this awful, wrenching regret. It went against everything she believed in. Tighe had not been one of the good guys.</p><p>Yet the thing that had distracted him was the child in his arms. A child he\u2019d clearly saved.</p><p>Her eyes burned. Remorse grew and thickened inside her until she could barely breathe around the pulsing grief. He shouldn\u2019t have died.</p><p>She blinked hard, clenching her teeth as she struggled to keep the unacceptable tears from falling. Her hand went to the gun still tucked into the back of her pants, the solid weight against her palm grounding her, easing her inner turmoil.</p><p>Long ago she\u2019d sworn an oath to uphold the law. She would not feel guilty over doing just that. Tighe had given her no choice.</p><p>What she\u2019d done was necessary. It was right. And if she had it to do over again, she\u2019d do exactly the same.</p><p>Even if she feared Tighe\u2019s face would haunt her for the rest of her life.</p><p>Chapter Eleven</p><p>In the nearby Virginia suburbs, Paenther snapped his cell phone closed and shoved it into the inside pocket of his leather duster as he and Foxx strode through the doors of the Tysons Corner Grand Peerage Hotel. Late-afternoon sunshine ribboned across the plush oriental-style carpeting. Crystal chandeliers hung at regular intervals, illuminating the business-suited guests mingling in small, professional gatherings.</p><p>\u201cWhat did Lyon have to say?\u201d Foxx asked, as they started across the lobby, heading for the dark-paneled Roosevelt\u2019s at the far end. The bar was one of a dozen watering holes the Ferals frequented in that part of the county. A favorite of Vhyper\u2019s. And Paenther was damned well going to find him.</p><p>\u201cLyon\u2019s called a meeting in the war room in two hours. This is going to have to be our last stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s Tighe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey got the bullets out of him. He\u2019ll live.\u201d For now. If Tighe didn\u2019t find that clone of his soon, it was going to be another matter. His hands fisted at his sides as worry for his friends twisted and braided with the barely controlled rage that lived in his bones and had for centuries. He refused to lose two friends to that sadistic bitch, Zaphene. Refused.</p><p>Lyon and the others were helping Tighe. It was his job, his and Foxx\u2019s, to track down Vhyper. Maybe, maybe, they\u2019d find Vhyper downing a scotch at the bar. Yeah, and what were the chances?</p><p>\u201cAny word from that gut of yours, Cub?\u201d Paenther\u2019s gaze pinned the youngest Feral, walking silent and morose beside him. Foxx had fancied himself in love with Zaphene, not realizing she was a witch who\u2019d enchanted him and used him to breach the Ferals\u2019 stronghold.</p><p>But it was neither pity nor sympathy that spurred Paenther to bring him along on the search. No, for the past year or so, Foxx\u2019s Feral talents had been starting to come online. He\u2019d been showing some impressive talent as an intuitive.</p><p>With any luck, that intuition would eventually guide them to Vhyper. And if that didn\u2019t work, he wasn\u2019t sure what he was going to do. Other than continue to haunt Vhyper\u2019s usual hot spots in hopes of eventually stumbling upon him.</p><p>The young Feral shook his shaggy head of red hair. \u201cGut\u2019s saying nada. Actually, my gut\u2019s saying it wants a couple of beers, then some dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not helpful,\u201d Paenther muttered.</p><p>As they passed through the lobby, businessmen moved out of their way, eyeing them warily. One small pack of well-dressed women watched them with a level of interest bordering on hunger.</p><p>Paenther ignored them all. The men, humans all, were harmless. The women were of no interest. Like any man, he had needs, but he took care of them with a willing Therian female at one of the enclaves. He couldn\u2019t remember the last time a woman had actually turned his head. Lust rarely broke through the surface of the ever-present torment that filled his body thanks to another Mage witch who\u2019d ensnared him centuries ago. Even if, by some miracle, he stumbled upon a woman who interested him, he\u2019d ignore her. All that mattered was finding Vhyper.</p><p>As they walked through the bar\u2019s entrance, through a thin haze of cigarette smoke, Paenther did a quick, fruitless scan. No Vhyper. Dammit.</p><p>Dull sunlight filtered into the dimly lit room through bare-branched trees. Only a handful of patrons sat at the polished-wood tables, most apparently deep in business discussions. Behind the bar, the local news lit the television screen, a video of a raging apartment fire. The same fire that Tighe, Hawke, and Kougar had gotten involved with that morning? Maybe.</p><p>Tearing his gaze from the television, he glanced at the bartender, recognizing the thin, balding man who\u2019d served him a few times before. The bartender was missing his usual friendliness, his eyes wary as he eyed their approach.</p><p>\u201cScotch and a Bud?\u201d he asked, as they slid onto a pair of barstools. Clearly, he remembered them. Then again, few people forgot a long-haired six-foot-six Indian with clawlike scars across one eye and a thick tribal tattoo on his neck. Or his redheaded sidekick. \u201cI\u2019ll need to see your IDs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t gotten any younger since the last time I was in here,\u201d Foxx grumbled, but he pulled out the license that gave a fake name and address and handed it to the man.</p><p>The bartender kept it and opened an unsteady hand to Paenther. His gaze tried to rise to Paenther\u2019s face, but faltered somewhere around the tattoo on his neck. \u201cBoth of them,\u201d he said bravely.</p><p>Paenther lifted one disbelieving brow. Humans. He supposed he admired the man\u2019s courage for insisting, especially when Paenther towered over him by close to a foot. He pulled out his own fake ID and handed it to him.</p><p>\u201cBe right back. Got to get my glasses.\u201d</p><p>As the bartender moved off, Paenther watched the door, praying Vhyper would walk in. Everything pointed to Vhyper\u2019s joining forces with the Mage, but goddess, it couldn\u2019t be true.</p><p>The rage bubbled under his skin, burning his nostrils. The Vhyper he knew would never help the Mage. Never.</p><p>And that was the problem, the thing that scared Paenther the most. The possibility that the Vhyper he knew was gone.</p><p>A muscle began to twitch under his eye, his jaw clenched iron-tight as he breathed through his nose. He would save him. Just as Vhyper had saved him from a Mage captivity that had nearly destroyed him, body, mind, and soul, two and a half centuries ago.</p><p>But he had to find him first.</p><p>\u201cEase up on the Dirty Harry look, dude,\u201d Foxx said, his voice vaguely amused. \u201cYou\u2019re clearing the place again.\u201d Foxx nudged him with his elbow and nodded at the television. \u201cLook.\u201d The volume had been muted, but damn if that wasn\u2019t Tighe\u2019s face plastered across the screen, right above the words, D.C. Vampire.</p><p>Shit.</p><p>His gaze snapped to the bartender only to find him hurriedly writing something down, his cell phone tucked between his shoulder and his ear, one of their IDs tight in his hand.</p><p>\u201cDammit to hell,\u201d he growled. He rose from the barstool and strode menacingly toward the traitor.</p><p>Walking behind the bar, he grabbed the cell phone off the man\u2019s shoulder, dropped it on the floor, and ground it beneath his heel.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d the bartender cried.</p><p>Damned camera phones. The last thing they needed was two more pictures plastered across the television beside Tighe\u2019s. Paenther snatched up the two IDs, nodded to Foxx, and started for the lobby.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t get my beer,\u201d Foxx complained.</p><p>\u201cTough shit.\u201d As they started across the lobby, a flashing light outside caught his attention. His jaw set. \u201cWalk calmly and follow me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a cop cruiser pulling up in front.\u201d He turned down a side corridor. \u201cWe\u2019ll shift if we have to, but I\u2019d like to avoid it.\u201d</p><p>As they ducked out the back, Paenther knew their chances of stumbling upon Vhyper had just taken a nosedive into the toilet. Because Vhyper was going to have the same problem they were. He\u2019d be instantly recognized as a friend of Tighe\u2019s in any of the many places they\u2019d frequented together.</p><p>A friend of the D.C. Vampire\u2019s. A person of interest. Guilt by association. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Finding him now was going to be next to impossible. Unless Foxx\u2019s intuition started kicking in, Vhyper might be well and truly lost.</p><p>Chapter Twelve</p><p>Lyon extended his arm to Tighe. \u201cYou\u2019re looking better.\u201d</p> <p>Tighe smiled. \u201cI\u2019m alive.\u201d Hawke and Kougar had taken him to the healer, Esmeria, in the Georgetown enclave, where she\u2019d taken the bullets from his flesh and healed his injuries. They\u2019d then brought him back to Feral House, where Kara had filled him with radiance over and over through the day, healing and strengthening him until he almost felt normal again.</p><p>Normal was an illusion, of course.</p><p>His clone still lived. And as long as his clone lived, as long as his soul was split, he could never be right.</p><p>Hell, he wasn\u2019t sure he\u2019d be right again even if his soul were returned to him. Not until he found a way to get Delaney Randall out of his head.</p><p>From the moment he\u2019d regained consciousness beneath the healer\u2019s care, he\u2019d thought of her, worried about her. What if she got another of those visions without him there to help deflect the pain? And she would get another vision unless his clone had somehow, miraculously, died on his own, which he was certain hadn\u2019t happened. The other Ferals had reported feeling a sudden shift, almost a lightness inside, when their own clones had been destroyed. Tighe felt no lightness, nothing but tension. Frustration. And concern.</p> <p>For Delaney.</p><p>Lyon slapped him on the shoulder. \u201cCome. We\u2019re meeting in the war room.</p><p>Tighe followed Lyon into the wood-paneled room at the back of the house. A large oval conference table sat in the center of the room. Along the walls, Hawke had rigged up four large computer screens. All were dark, the chairs empty, as the Ferals paced.</p><p>Paenther greeted him, clasping his arm hard and long. \u201cGlad you pulled through.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, thanks. I can\u2019t tell you how much I wish that damn clone had gone after the Therian enclaves instead of getting me mixed up in the human world.\u201d Then again, he\u2019d never have met Delaney. Which would have been a good thing. Definitely a good thing.</p><p>\u201cYour eyes,\u201d Paenther murmured.</p> <p>\u201cThe streaks?\u201d Tighe answered Paenther\u2019s unspoken question. \u201cNo clue what they mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get started.\u201d Lyon took the seat at the head of the table and motioned the rest of them to take their chairs. All did, except Paenther and Tighe. Tighe was too damned tense to sit. He prowled the room like an animal in a cage.</p><p>Paenther remained standing by the door, back straight, arms crossed, a fine tension radiating from him that rivaled Tighe\u2019s own, thanks to an inborn rage that had tormented the black-haired warrior for centuries.</p><p>After dealing with his own unnatural tension, Tighe\u2019s respect for his friend grew another three notches. How he kept his sanity, Tighe couldn\u2019t guess.</p><p>Lyon turned to Paenther. \u201cReport, B.P.\u201d</p><p>Paenther scowled. \u201cNothing good. No sign of Vhyper in any of the places he would have gone, were he still himself. Which isn\u2019t surprising. Tighe\u2019s face is splashed all over the news. A bartender recognized us as friends of his and called the cops on us this afternoon.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cHe\u2019s not hanging out in bars, Roar.\u201d</p><p>Lyon nodded. \u201cWhere do you think he is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith the Mage.\u201d Paenther nodded at Foxx. \u201cWe\u2019ve been afraid so from the beginning, but the cub\u2019s gut started confirming it last night. We drove out to the Mage stronghold on the Eastern Shore to have a look around, but it\u2019s gone, Roar. The mansion\u2019s still there, but by the look of the place, the Mage have been gone for months.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI thought we had Therians keeping watch on the place,\u201d Hawke said.</p><p>\u201cTwo Therians were there, hiding in the woods nearby. They swore up and down every room in the mansion was lit when in truth they were all dark. Glamour strong enough to fool Therians for weeks, maybe months, is damn strong magic, Roar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSensing a theme here, Chief?\u201d Jag drawled.</p><p>Lyon threw Jag a sharp look, then turned his gaze to encompass all the Ferals. \u201cI want to know how the Mage got their ancient magic back and how much of it they actually have.\u201d A deep growl rumbled from Lyon\u2019s throat as his gaze returned to Paenther. \u201cFind Vhyper and the blade, B.P. And that Mage stronghold, while you\u2019re at it. I want to know what in the hell is going on!\u201d</p><p>Paenther dipped his head, his shoulder-length hair brushing his cheeks like twin black curtains.</p><p>Tighe glanced up as Kara entered the room. He expected her to go to Lyon, as she usually did, but though her hand trailed along Lyon\u2019s shoulder as she passed him, she came straight to him, meeting his glance with a gentle smile that warmed the half of his tattered soul he still possessed.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d she said softly, taking his hand.</p><p>\u201cHi, yourself.\u201d He tugged lightly on her blond ponytail, finding a smile for her beneath the weight of his worry. As he felt the first warm surge of power flow from her hand into his, he knew what she was about. Her skin began to glow with the iridescence of radiance. \u201cThanks, little one.\u201d</p><p>With another soft smile, she turned to stand beside him where she could watch her mate and the others. Keeping their hands joined, he lifted his arm over her head so that his arm was around her, and tucked her against his side as she acted as the conduit for him to the Earth\u2019s energy and strength.</p><p>Lyon barely batted an eye at the move, to Tighe\u2019s relief. Lyon was as jealous as any mated male, but Kara\u2019s closeness strengthened Tighe almost as much as the radiance, and Lyon knew it. Besides, she thought of Tighe as more of a big brother, which suited Tighe just fine. Theirs was a bond he was coming to treasure. He adored her.</p><p>But it was another woman\u2019s face that wouldn\u2019t leave his mind. Damn Delaney. He\u2019d admired her warrior\u2019s spirit, so it shouldn\u2019t have surprised him that she\u2019d turn on him the moment she got the chance.</p><p>As if she couldn\u2019t even feel that soft connection to him in her head. Or it meant nothing to her.</p><p>And what had it meant to him? It hadn\u2019t changed his own mission or her place in it. He could hardly expect it to have changed hers.</p><p>Delaney Randall might be a woman, but she was FBI through and through. And the truth was, that was one of the things he admired most about her. She never let her emotions get in the way of what she had to do.</p><p>\u201cBetter?\u201d Kara asked, looking up at him, the glow of radiance leaving her face.</p><p>\u201cMuch.\u201d He leaned down and placed an affectionate kiss on her forehead. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>She gave him a quick hug, then slipped out of his hold to join Lyon, hooking her arm around his shoulder as he tugged her down to perch on the cushioned arm of his chair.</p><p>Lyon nodded to Hawke. \u201cShow them what you showed me earlier.\u201d</p><p>Hawke reached for the laptop sitting open in front of him. A moment later, one of the flat-screens came to life, replaying the local news channel\u2019s morning report. The sound was muted, but no sound was needed.</p><p>Tighe watched his own likeness with dismay. An amateur photographer at the scene of the fire had caught Tighe leaving the apartment with the child in his arms.</p><p>\u201cIs that you?\u201d Lyon asked him. \u201cOr the clone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho was the girl?\u201d</p><p>Tighe set his jaw and shrugged. \u201cJust a kid trapped in the apartment above the fire.\u201d</p><p>Jag snorted. \u201cSince when do you give a shit about humans?\u201d</p><p>Tighe threw the warrior a glare, but had no decent answer. He\u2019d been asking himself the same question.</p><p>\u201cThe better question,\u201d Lyon said, \u201cis why is that clone so damned hard to catch?\u201d</p><p>Tighe nodded. \u201cI\u2019ve been asking myself why this one\u2019s different. Why did this one escape the battle when the others stayed to the bitter end?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe witch\u2019s control on him must have been weaker,\u201d Hawke said. \u201cBut there\u2019s more to it than that. The clones were created for one purpose only. To perform the Feral ritual to free the Daemons from the blade since we\u2019d never do it.\u201d</p><p>Wulfe leaned forward in his chair. \u201cBut Tighe\u2019s clone developed a will to survive.\u201d</p><p>Hawke nodded. \u201cMaybe more than that. Those clones should have been the same. They were made at the same time with the same magic by the same witch. The only differences were the souls used. And the draden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe draden,\u201d Lyon murmured. \u201cWhat if she accidentally caught one of the old ones in her net?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m thinking.\u201d Hawke\u2019s palms flattened on the table in front of him. \u201cThe oldest ones were once Daemons. Though the souls were stripped and imprisoned in the Daemon blade, it\u2019s conceivable a bit of the Daemon\u2019s consciousness survived in the draden all that time.\u201d</p><p>Tighe scowled. \u201cAnd now that he\u2019s been reanimated, he possesses the drive of a Daemon. He\u2019s acting like one, that\u2019s for damned sure.\u201d</p><p>Lyon turned to Hawke. \u201cDoes that mean what I\u2019m afraid it does?\u201d</p><p>Hawke\u2019s jaw clenched as he nodded. \u201cHis ultimate goal is bound to be freeing Satanan. And with that bit of Daemon consciousness, he may know things, ways to accomplish that that even the Mage and Therians have never known. At the moment, he doesn\u2019t seem to be doing anything but feeding. And maybe that\u2019s all he is doing, but it\u2019s clear he\u2019s evolving. Survival comes first, and sooner or later he\u2019s going to realize, if he hasn\u2019t already, that his survival hinges on you, Tighe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe can\u2019t live if I die. At least that\u2019s what your clone told Kara.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe that was right initially. Before the clones were fully evolved. But I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s true any longer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what exactly are you saying, Wings?\u201d Tighe asked warily.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m saying, watch your back, buddy. I don\u2019t think killing you is going to automatically give him your half of the soul, but there may be other ways. He was born of magic. A magic I\u2019ve seen evidence he may still possess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExplain,\u201d Lyon said.</p><p>\u201cKougar and I had him cornered. He slipped into a group of humans and disappeared. We\u2019re not sure how, but when we combed the group for him, he was gone. And he should not have been able to get away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould he have acquired Tighe\u2019s ability to shift?\u201d Foxx asked.</p><p>Tighe frowned. \u201cMy animal can\u2019t be split like that.\u201d</p><p>Hawke shook his head. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what abilities he\u2019s acquired. They could be anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow are we going to catch him?\u201d Lyon demanded.</p><p>\u201cDaemon traps.\u201d Kougar pulled at his goatee. \u201cIf we can unearth some of those old spells.\u201d</p><p>Hawke groaned, shaking his head. \u201cThey haven\u2019t been used in five millennia. What are the chances?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet on it.\u201d Lyon turned to Tighe. \u201cHave you had more visions?\u201d</p><p>Tighe quit pacing and faced his chief. \u201cThe lady Fed is getting them now instead of me, but when I touch her as she\u2019s having one, I see them clearly. I know right where he is.\u201d</p><p>Lyon met his gaze, his amber eyes thoughtful. \u201cHawke told me what happened. That you weren\u2019t able to take her memories.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet. I\u2019m working on it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is she now?\u201d</p><p>Tighe shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019ll find her.\u201d</p><p>Lyon\u2019s hands fisted on the table in front of him. \u201cI don\u2019t like that you don\u2019t have control of her mind.\u201d</p><p>Tighe\u2019s teeth ground together, his temper sparking. \u201cI said, I\u2019m working on it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have to tell you how dangerous it is to have an FBI agent searching for us, knowing what we are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t have a clue what we are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe not, yet. But she\u2019s an investigator. And I have to believe she\u2019s already seen things that have her questioning who you are. What you are. Am I wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You\u2019re not wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cContain this threat, Stripes. However you have to do it. If you can\u2019t, we will.\u201d</p><p>Tighe heard the promise in his chief\u2019s words. The threat. Because there was only one way anyone else could contain this.</p><p>By killing Delaney Randall.</p><p>Deep inside, the tiger raised its head and growled.</p><p>\u201cWhatever we do, we have to do it fast,\u201d Hawke said. \u201cI called the Shaman and talked to him about those streaks in your eyes, Tighe.\u201d</p><p>Tighe lifted a brow. \u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>Hawke\u2019s jaw clenched, his expression grim. \u201cYour soul\u2019s beginning to disintegrate. Once your eyes are fully black, there won\u2019t be anything left of you in either body. Until then, there\u2019s still hope we can put you back together again.\u201d</p><p>But his time was running out.</p><p>Delaney sat on the edge of the bed while the blood-pressure cuff contracted around her arm.</p><p>\u201cHow do you feel?\u201d Dr. Jensen asked for the fiftieth time. The doctor was a short, round woman with a tight cap of salt-and-pepper hair and shrewd blue eyes.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d Like her heart had been ripped out of her chest.</p><p>\u201cGood. All your vital signs are normal.\u201d The doctor removed the cuff. \u201cWe\u2019ll have the lab results back in the morning. I\u2019d offer you something to help you sleep tonight, but until we know if they drugged you, I don\u2019t dare give you anything.\u201d</p><p>Delaney shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t need it.\u201d The last thing she wanted was to be in a deep, unnatural sleep if one of Tighe\u2019s men found a way to track her.</p><p>Just the thought of Tighe made her jaw tighten with anger. Her eyes began to grow hot, stinging with unshed tears. He shouldn\u2019t have run. He shouldn\u2019t have died. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>God, what an idiot she was to care.</p><p>Dr. Jensen said good night and closed the bedroom door behind her, leaving Delaney alone in the master suite of the FBI safe house. Phil had arranged for her to stay under a doctor\u2019s supervision until they figured out if she had, indeed, been drugged. In addition to Dr. Jensen, there were two highly trained guards inside with her and another two outside in case Tighe\u2019s brother, or others in his organization, came after her.</p><p>Until they understood what she\u2019d stumbled into, they weren\u2019t taking any chances.</p> <p>The only one she knew wouldn\u2019t come for her was Tighe himself.</p><p>She pressed the heel of her hand tight against her chest, trying to ease the awful ache. The tears she\u2019d held at bay all day finally got the better of her, and she sank onto the bed, letting them go. Her tears turned to sobs as she cried, grieving for a man she\u2019d never understood and barely even known. She couldn\u2019t regret her own actions, because she\u2019d done what she had to do, but she could...and did...regret the outcome. She hated that Tighe had been so involved in illegal activities that he\u2019d sacrificed his life rather than be taken in for questioning.</p><p>Lying back, tears rolling, she ached with loss. In some inexplicable way, they\u2019d connected. She\u2019d sensed a goodness in him, seen it in the man who\u2019d been so intent on rescuing a little girl, he\u2019d stumbled into the FBI\u2019s trap. And he\u2019d understood her, maybe better than she understood herself. He\u2019d claimed she sought the killers out of revenge. And she did. She absolutely did. But it was more than that, she could see that now. Somewhere in the back of her head was a belief held from childhood that if she could just catch the man who\u2019d killed her mom, she could make it all right again. She could get rid of the ache she\u2019d lived with all these years once and for all.</p><p>But that ache was so much more than righteous retribution. It was loss and grief. Betrayal.</p><p>Loneliness.</p> <p>Once the tears started, tears she hadn\u2019t shed in years, she couldn\u2019t stop them. She cried for Tighe, and for the mother she still missed, and for the children whose own mothers had been stolen from them by a man Delaney couldn\u2019t catch. But mostly she cried for herself, for the loneliness that pressed in harder every day. A loneliness she hadn\u2019t even known she felt until a handsome, mercurial, strangely gentle man made it disappear.</p><p>A man who would never touch her again.</p><p>She didn\u2019t realize she\u2019d fallen asleep until pain tore through her head with the force of a sledgehammer, slamming her awake with a breath-stealing gasp. She needed to call for Dr. Jensen. But before she could utter a sound, the darkness rushed up to envelop her. As the dark fog of agony stole her away, a single name screamed through her mind.</p><p>Tighe!</p><p>As Tighe stood in the war room, Delaney\u2019s cry tore through his head. He froze.</p><p>\u201cStripes! What\u2019s happening? Another vision?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d He grabbed for the wall as blackness stole his sight. He saw Delaney lying on a bed, still and silent, her cheeks streaked with tears. His heart clenched, that warmth in his mind that connected with her throbbed with pain. Terrible pain.</p><p>Tighe! He felt the fog circling her, swirls of black threatening her.</p><p>He reached out to her, but the suffocating darkness had her in its grasp, pulling her down.</p><p>Tighe!</p><p>Her voice was smaller, more distant. And filled with such fear. Such pain.</p><p>Delaney.</p><p>He reached for her through his mind, but she slipped through his grasp, disappearing into the dark, perilous fog.</p><p>And then she was gone.</p> <p>\u201cTighe?\u201d Kara\u2019s voice broke through the fog.</p><p>The vision dissipated. He shook his head, clearing his sight as he blinked, trying to understand what he\u2019d just seen, even as desperation to find her leaped inside him, rising side by side with a terror not his own.</p><p>Delaney\u2019s.</p><p>What had happened? Someone was hurting her. Or some thing.</p><p>He stilled. It had almost felt as if the vision itself had turned on her.</p><p>Goddess, yes, that was exactly what had happened. The visions had been growing too much for her human mind. Too strong. She\u2019d finally broken beneath the weight of this one and fallen into that dark for good.</p><p>Deep in his heart he feared she wouldn\u2019t break free of it on her own.</p><p>He started for the door.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Lyon demanded.</p><p>\u201cDelaney needs me. I\u2019ve got to find her.\u201d How? She wouldn\u2019t have gone home. He was certain of that. He lunged from the room and strode down the hall toward the front door.</p><p>He heard her calling to him. Felt the pull of her through that accidental connection he\u2019d formed with her when he\u2019d tried to cloud her mind, and prayed it would be enough to follow.</p><p>Behind him, he heard Lyon barking orders. \u201cHawke, Kougar, and Jag, go with him. Take two different sedans this time, in case the humans took note of the first ones.\u201d</p><p>Lyon\u2019s voice receded as Tighe ran out the door. What if he couldn\u2019t find her? What if he did, and he couldn\u2019t reach her mind?</p><p>I have to save her.</p><p>Desperation and determination wove and twined inside him, fueled and fired by a rage that was all too real. The clone already threatened Tighe\u2019s own life. He would not let him and these evil visions destroy Delaney, too.</p><p>If they hadn\u2019t already.</p><p>As Tighe ran for the nearest car, he feared it might be too late. Even if he managed to find her, would there be anything left of her mind to save?</p><p>Chapter Thirteen</p><p>Darkness swallowed her, swallowed everything. Sight, sound, even her sense of touch. Delaney felt nothing but the distant echoes of pain.</p><p>She had a sense that she was standing. Perhaps even walking. But where? With her hand, she reached out and touched nothing. She lifted her hand to her head, and it wasn\u2019t there.</p><p>Panic welled up, and she shoved it down, forcing logic into the void. Not real. This isn\u2019t real.</p><p>Her body was still lying on the bed where Dr. Jensen had left her. It was only her mind that had taken off, swept away by a vision she hadn\u2019t seen, into a darkness she didn\u2019t know how to escape.</p><p>The last time she\u2019d glimpsed this darkness, Tighe had snatched her back before it could suck her in. But Tighe was dead.</p><p>Grief mixed with the panic that welled again, clawing at her mind. She struggled to escape, to find her way out of the dark, but it was as if she were trying to run with her feet set in concrete.</p><p>Lost. So lost.</p><p>Tears fell through the silent darkness as loneliness grew to gigantic proportions, a suffocating cold stamping out every thought.</p><p>The terror reared up, swallowing her whole as a single word screamed through her head again, shattering the choking silence.</p><p>Tighe!</p><p>\u201cTurn right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure?\u201d Hawke asked.</p><p>Tighe growled, his fingernails clenched into the palms of his hands. \u201cDo it!\u201d</p><p>The car turned onto a residential street in an upscale Arlington neighborhood.</p><p>\u201cExpensive digs for an FBI agent,\u201d Jag drawled.</p><p>\u201cThe house isn\u2019t hers,\u201d Tighe said. \u201cTen bucks says it\u2019s acting as an FBI safe house. She\u2019s being guarded.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll shift and knock them out,\u201d Hawke said. \u201cJag, you stay with the car.\u201d</p><p>Jag muttered something under his breath. Tighe didn\u2019t need to hear it to know the warrior was railing against the fates for not giving him the ability to keep his clothes on when he shifted.</p><p>\u201cWhich house?\u201d Hawke asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you when I know.\u201d Tighe\u2019s sense of Delaney had been growing steadily since they left Feral House, drawing him to her with a solid pull. His heart pounded as her terror weaved through his brain. Over and over, he heard her calling for him with a desperation, a hopelessness, that tore at his battered soul. She thought he was dead, yet knew he was her only hope.</p><p>She thought she was well and truly trapped.</p><p>\u201cHere!\u201d Tighe wasn\u2019t certain how he knew she was in the single upstairs bedroom with the light still on, but he knew.</p><p>Hawke continued to drive by the house, the night\u2019s darkness hiding the features of the men inside the car. They\u2019d left the second sedan two streets over. If the situation went south, they\u2019d split up and meet again elsewhere.</p><p>When they\u2019d turned the next corner, Hawke parked along the side of the road.</p><p>\u201cShift,\u201d Tighe ordered, then called to the animal who lived inside him, pushing past the tiger, straight to the smaller form of house cat. As a younger Feral, he\u2019d had to go first to his full tiger form before he could downsize. A serious handicap he\u2019d quickly learned to overcome.</p><p>Jag, remaining in human form, opened the car door for him, and he leaped out onto the grass, Kougar behind him, Hawke soaring into the air.</p><p>As Tighe and Kougar ran toward the house on four feet, Hawke reported back.</p><p>Two guards patrolling the grounds outside\u2014one in back, one watching the front from the bushes in the right front corner of the house. The fence is high and looks to be solid. I\u2019ll get the one in back.</p><p>Tighe replied. I\u2019ll cloud the mind of the one in front and get him to open the door. Kougar and I\u2019ll go in. Wings, you keep watch.</p><p>Will do.</p><p>Tighe ran through the yard, then slipped between the legs of the watching guard.</p><p>\u201cBeat it.\u201d The man picked him up with his foot and tossed him half a dozen yards.</p><p>Damned human. Tighe came around behind him noisily, ensuring that the guard knew the movement behind him was a cat. Then he shifted and grabbed the man\u2019s neck before he knew what was happening. The moment the guard hit the ground, Tighe took control of his thoughts.</p><p>\u201cYou need to use the bathroom. When I tell you to, go into the house. Two cats will try to come in with you. You must let them in. Don\u2019t allow anyone to stop them. Once inside the house, you\u2019ll go into the bathroom and close the door, pull down your pants, then curl up on the floor and go to sleep.\u201d</p><p>The bastard\u2019s career would be over when they caught him, literally, with his pants down. But he deserved it for kicking a cat.</p><p>Tighe? Hawke\u2019s voice broke into his thoughts. My guard\u2019s out. I\u2019m flying up to the roof to keep watch.</p><p>Good. Meet me beside the front porch, Kougar. We\u2019re going in.</p><p>\u201cWake, human, and do as I told you.\u201d As the guard rose to his feet, Tighe changed back into his cat form and raced for the front door.</p><p>The guard pulled out his phone. \u201cI\u2019ve got to take a crap. Change places with me.\u201d</p><p>Tighe trotted beside the human, leaping onto the front porch as the guard knocked on the door with a quick, light rhythm. As planned, the door opened and the two cats slipped inside.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d The inside guard tried to stop their entry, but the one under Tighe\u2019s control blocked the swing of his foot.</p><p>\u201cLeave them alone. They\u2019re not bothering anything.\u201d</p><p>Get control of things down here, Tighe told Kougar. I\u2019ve got to find Delaney.</p><p>The Feral didn\u2019t answer, but Tighe didn\u2019t expect him to. He dashed for the stairs and the source of the terror clawing at his brain. The closer he got to her, the stronger the darkness swirled at the edges of his consciousness. And the stronger he felt her desperation. She was fighting her fate, as was her nature, but without help she was lost in there. And she knew it.</p><p>Her door was closed, which meant he was going to have to shift to reach her. The prudent thing to do was search out the rest of the upstairs first, to make sure he wasn\u2019t surprised again. But his need to reach her was too strong.</p><p>Tighe shifted in the empty hallway, but as he reached for the doorknob, he heard the click of a gun.</p><p>\u201cFreeze! Hands in the air.\u201d A small, round woman with graying hair appeared at the other end of the hall, aiming a gun at his head. \u201cIntruder!\u201d she shouted.</p><p>Shit. This is so not happening. He needed to get to Delaney and he needed to reach her now.</p><p>He heard a short scuffle on the lower floor, then silence as a cat ran up the stairs. Kougar.</p><p>The woman was already talking into a phone. \u201cIt\u2019s him.\u201d She paused. \u201cAgreed.\u201d</p><p>Tighe lifted his hands into the air, holding perfectly still. He could take another bullet if he had to, but he\u2019d just as soon not. Not when Delaney needed him.</p><p>\u201cI thought they\u2019d shot you,\u201d the woman said conversationally.</p><p>Tighe didn\u2019t bother to answer as Kougar scooted past her, then shifted. The woman seemed to sense the change, but she was too slow turning around. Kougar jammed his thumb into the hollow at the base of her ear, stripping her gun from her hand as she went down.</p><p>Tighe grabbed for the door that separated him from Delaney. He found her exactly as he\u2019d seen her in his vision, still and silent, her cheeks stained with tears.</p><p>\u201cDelaney.\u201d He fell onto the bed beside her and reached for her hand. Like ice. \u201cD, I\u2019m coming for you. I\u2019m not going to leave you in there. But you have to trust me this time. Trust me.\u201d</p><p>Raw terror pressed in around her, squeezing her mind until Delaney thought her brain would crumble beneath the weight. Her existence had narrowed down to this darkness, this place void of everything she\u2019d ever known. This miserable pit of echoing pain and suffocating fear.</p><p>How long could she stay sane like this? Maybe it was better if she didn\u2019t. Better to lose herself somewhere else. Anywhere else.</p><p>Delaney.</p><p>A voice whispered from the darkness. A deep voice she\u2019d longed to hear so badly she\u2019d started to create it for herself. Maybe that insanity would come quicker than she\u2019d thought.</p><p>Delaney.</p><p>Tighe\u2019s voice. But Tighe was dead.</p><p>Trust me.</p><p>How many times had he asked her to do that? But she hadn\u2019t. Not fully. She couldn\u2019t. Not when she knew he was one of the bad guys.</p><p>Tighe? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Darkness swirled around her, a perfect void without sound, without sight, without feel except that persistent, distant pain. But the voice continued to speak in her head.</p><p>D, I\u2019m coming for you. I\u2019m not going to leave you in there, but you have to reach out to me. You have to trust me.</p><p>You\u2019re not real. You\u2019re dead. And yet there was something about his voice that brushed her mind with a familiar feel of warmth. Of strength.</p> <p>I\u2019m not dead, brown eyes. I\u2019m right here with you. I\u2019m trying to get you out. Can you feel my hands on your face?</p><p>No. I can\u2019t feel anything except the pain in my head, and even that isn\u2019t very strong.</p><p>Come to me, D. Follow the sound of my voice, then. Reach for me. Trust me.</p><p>I can\u2019t trust you. You ran from the Feds. The words tore at her, sending a cascade of tears through her mind. I can\u2019t trust you.</p><p>Then at least trust me to get you out of here. You must reach for me.</p> <p>Help me, Tighe.</p><p>Do you see the thread, D? The iridescent one?</p><p>I can\u2019t see anything!</p><p>Easy, sweetheart. Reach for me with your mind. Reach for me, D.</p><p>And suddenly she saw something gleaming, shining with a million colors. A tiny thread. As she reached for it, she felt the angel wings flutter inside her head, telling her she\u2019d found it at last. No, not it. Tighe.</p><p>She felt his mind brush against hers, a soft thrill of pleasure in the feather-light touch, as she followed the thread. Little by little, it grew larger, brighter.</p> <p>In a rush of warmth, he grabbed her mentally, his mind lifting her from the dark.</p><p>Sensation rushed back, overwhelmingly sweet, as she felt his strong arms go around her and pull her close against his warm body. She wrapped her arms around his neck and buried her face in his throat, clinging to him as joy squeezed her heart and rushed through her chest.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re alive.\u201d Tears streaked down her face as she felt his hand cradling the back of her head.</p><p>He pulled back, urging her to look at him. She did, her gaze searching the face of the man she\u2019d thought she\u2019d never see again.</p><p>His thumb traced her eyebrow. \u201cYou had me worried for a few minutes there, brown eyes. I wasn\u2019t sure I was going to be able to reach you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow are you alive?\u201d</p><p>A shadow brushed past the open doorway.</p><p>\u201cTighe, we\u2019ve got company. Lots of it by the looks of things. We\u2019re not going to be able to take her.\u201d</p> <p>Tighe\u2019s expression tightened as he looked back down at her. \u201cI\u2019m going to have to leave you for now, but you need me, brown eyes. I\u2019m the only one who can save you next time this happens.\u201d His mouth turned hard. \u201cIf you sic the Feds on me again, you\u2019re on your own. Don\u2019t turn on me again, Delaney. I mean it.\u201d</p><p>She forced herself to release him. \u201cHow do I find you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStand in the parking lot along the northeast side of the Tidal Basin at 5:30 A.M. In four hours. I\u2019ll drive through in a green Camry sedan and pick you up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow am I going to know it\u2019s green, let alone you, in the dark?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have one halogen headlight and one normal one. You\u2019ll be able to tell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if I can\u2019t get there that fast?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo it. I want you with me before you get another vision.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTighe!\u201d The man\u2019s voice shouted from the hallway. \u201cWe have to get out of here. Now!\u201d</p><p>Tighe leaned down and kissed her hard, his hand sliding behind her neck, his thumb tracing her ear, then the hollow below it.</p><p>\u201cTrust me, Delaney,\u201d he murmured against her lips, then pressed his thumb beneath her ear.</p><p>Darkness swallowed her again.</p><p>Delaney shoved her hands in the pockets of her blazer as she stood on the edge of the parking lot where Tighe had promised to pick her up. The sky was still dark, few cars on the road at this hour on a Sunday morning. Everything should go down exactly as planned.</p><p>As she\u2019d planned, not Tighe.</p><p>Trust me, he\u2019d begged her.</p><p>Her stomach felt like she\u2019d swallowed nails. In some ways she did trust him. With her body. Oddly, she suspected, even with her life.</p><p>But she was an FBI agent. Sworn to uphold the law. She would not let her duty be derailed by feelings for a man she knew was involved in something hugely illegal. Feelings she didn\u2019t even understand.</p><p>When Tighe arrived to pick her up, he would be the one taken instead.</p><p>Her stomach clenched. The angel wings fluttered angrily. He\u2019d begged her to trust him.</p><p>He had to be brought in for questioning. He was into something bad, and the Feds needed to know what it was.</p><p>He\u2019d risked his life to come to her and free her from that dark prison. He hadn\u2019t even taken her with him, he\u2019d just saved her.</p><p>Delaney pressed her fist against the aching lump sitting in her gut. God, what had she done?</p><p>Her job. She\u2019d done her job. He was a criminal. His brother a murderer. She had to catch them. She had no choice. He was a bad guy, blast it.</p><p>But he wasn\u2019t. Not completely. He had a goodness in him, a gentleness. He\u2019d rescued that little girl from the fire, hadn\u2019t he?</p><p>All her life she\u2019d seen people as good or bad. Especially criminals. Yet Tighe didn\u2019t entirely fit either of those roles.</p><p>Delaney rubbed her fist against her churning stomach. Maybe he did. Maybe he wasn\u2019t one of the bad guys at all. All she knew for sure was that he was involved with something big and had refused to be taken by the Feds. All along her instincts had been telling her that he wasn\u2019t evil. What if her instincts were right? For all she knew, he could be part of some military special ops or other supersecret team put together to battle terrorism and save the world.</p><p>Yes, he\u2019d kidnapped her. And drugged her.</p><p>Good grief, was she really trying to convince herself he\u2019d done all those things for the right reasons?</p><p>Yeah, maybe she was. He hadn\u2019t hurt her. He\u2019d never hurt her. In fact, he\u2019d gone to great lengths to keep her from being hurt. He\u2019d saved her.</p><p>And she\u2019d set him up again to be captured. What if he tried to escape and wasn\u2019t as lucky this time?</p><p>The knots in her stomach cramped.</p><p>She\u2019d made Phil promise no one would shoot him, but even if they didn\u2019t intend to kill him, they absolutely meant to apprehend him. Too many people had died for them to let him get away.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t do this. She couldn\u2019t let them shoot him again. It was a mistake. A horrible mistake.</p><p>Delaney started running through the trees, toward the road. She had to keep Tighe from making that turn. She had to stop this.</p><p>But she\u2019d barely gone ten yards when a car swung into the parking lot. A midsized sedan with one halogen headlight.</p><p>No.</p><p>A large bird of prey flew low over her head, but she barely noticed. She watched the car come to a slow stop not ten spaces into the lot, too far away for her to see Tighe\u2019s face. Immediately, half a dozen SWAT surrounded the car, weapons drawn. If he tried to get away this time, he was a dead man.</p><p>\u201cOh God, Tighe. What have I done?\u201d</p><p>A large hand clamped around her mouth, as an iron arm pinned her against a hard chest.</p><p>\u201cYou did exactly what he expected you to,\u201d a deep, vaguely familiar voice said against her ear.</p><p>Chapter Fourteen</p><p>Paenther turned at the sound of the blinkers to find Foxx preparing to pull the Mustang into a small, run-down convenience store set into the side of a steep, heavily wooded hill. An old sign hung above the single door. MARKET, it read. As if it were the only place to buy anything in this middle-of-nowhere deep in the mountains of western Virginia.</p><p>It probably was.</p><p>At the corner of the old brick building, a doe and a spotted fawn watched curiously until Foxx pulled into the nearly empty parking lot with a spray of gravel. The pair took off for the woods.</p><p>\u201cYour gut telling you something?\u201d Paenther eyed the redheaded Feral with a razor-sharp hope.</p><p>Foxx snorted. \u201cYeah. It\u2019s telling me I\u2019m hungry.\u201d</p><p>With a thinly masked groan of disgust, Paenther tipped his head back against the headrest. Soon after the meeting at Feral House, Foxx announced that his gut was telling him they\u2019d find Vhyper in the Blue Ridge Mountains, the narrow range that ran parallel to the East Coast from Georgia to Pennsylvania and met up with I\u201366 a little over an hour\u2019s drive west of D.C.</p><p>With nothing better to go on, he and Foxx had hightailed it out there and been driving aimlessly around this pastoral outback for the past seven plus hours. They\u2019d covered nearly two hundred miles of country roads and so far found nothing.</p><p>Damned useless intuition. How was the cub supposed to read his gut when all it seemed to do was rumble with hunger?</p><p>The dust kicked up by Foxx\u2019s assault on the gravel covered the car in a light fog that wafted in the open window, making Paenther\u2019s nose twitch.</p><p>\u201cWant anything?\u201d Foxx swung his long, broad-shouldered frame out of the car.</p><p>Yeah, he wanted something. Several somethings. Vhyper, the Daemon blade, Tighe\u2019s clone. Not to mention the whereabouts of the Mage stronghold. None of which were likely to be found inside the Market.</p><p>With a growl of frustration, Paenther climbed out of the car and followed Foxx. For the moment, a hot dog and a Coke would have to do, but his always razor-thin patience was fraying fast. If that intuition of Foxx\u2019s didn\u2019t kick in soon, Paenther was going to turn into some seriously bad company.</p><p>He strode across the narrow parking lot, his gaze constantly on the move. There were five cars scattered across the small parking lot, none of which looked like it was less than fifteen years old. None of which was Vhyper\u2019s. Across the rarely traveled two-lane was a small farmhouse set in the middle of a large pasture dotted with horses.</p><p>Not a mansion in sight. The Mage never lived in groups of fewer than thirty or forty, and there\u2019d been no sign of any large residences around there. They were wasting their time.</p><p>Paenther pushed through the twin glass doors, spying Foxx in the middle of a narrow aisle, his hands already half-filled with junk food. How he could stand to eat that crap, Paenther didn\u2019t know. He grabbed the closing door as a harried-looking woman approached, pushing a crying baby in a stroller.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d she said, smelling of stale milk and cigarettes as he held the door for her.</p><p>At the cash register, an elderly man bought a six-pack of beer. And at the magazine stand...</p><p>Paenther\u2019s gaze slowed, lingering with appreciation over the slender, feminine form of a young woman flipping through magazines. Her hair was very short and dark, her bone structure delicate. Ethereal.</p><p>Lovely.</p><p>As if she felt him watching, she turned her head and lifted sweeping, dark lashes to reveal eyes the bright blue of a summer sky. Their gazes caught, snapping together like two pieces of a puzzle. He felt the contact like a physical jolt. His pulse lifted. His blood began to run thick and hot, racing to the juncture of his thighs.</p><p>Goddess, when was the last time he\u2019d reacted to a woman like that? Years ago. Years ago.</p><p>A soft gentle smile lifted her mouth, stealing his breath, causing his heart to do a slow tumble in his chest.</p><p>The beauty set down the magazine and walked back to the EMPLOYEES ONLY door a few yards away and disappeared.</p><p>\u201cYou ready, B.P.?\u201d Foxx\u2019s voice called to him from the front of the store.</p><p>Slowly, Paenther turned to his companion, feeling as off-balance as a youth with his first crush. Damn. It was too bad he didn\u2019t have time to hang around there for a couple of hours. Or days.</p><p>He scowled at the foolish thought and grabbed a Coke from the cooler. The last thing he needed just then was his head turned by a woman. A human woman, no less.</p><p>The good news was, he knew he\u2019d forget her as soon as they drove away. No woman held his interest for long these days.</p><p>Chapter Fifteen</p><p>Tighe paced the small bedroom in the basement apartment of the house in Dupont Circle as he waited for Delaney to wake. He hadn\u2019t dared take her back to Capitol Hill. Not when she\u2019d probably been thoroughly debriefed by the FBI.</p><p>He crossed to the big bed, where she lay sleeping from Hawke\u2019s capture, once more clothed in that navy blue suit and white shirt that cried Federal Agent. Her dark hair was partially knotted at the nape of her neck, but tendrils had come loose to splay across the white satin pillowcase, framing her flawless olive-toned skin. Even in sleep, her expression was tense. Guarded. The shadows that darkened her soul refused to release her, even in sleep.</p><p>His body warmed at the sight of her, something easing deep inside him. He hadn\u2019t been able to take a full breath, for worrying about her, until he had her back, safe in his keeping. Which he\u2019d accomplished with relative ease. He\u2019d known she\u2019d set him up. From the moment he\u2019d told her to meet him by the Tidal Basin, he\u2019d planned for Hawke to grab her.</p><p>Tighe had ensnared the mind of a human male of his own approximate size and hair color and told him to drive the green Camry into the parking lot, stop the car, and fall asleep. Which he\u2019d done. The FBI had been thoroughly put out, but the man hadn\u2019t been harmed.</p><p>And Delaney was back with him again.</p><p>No, this woman didn\u2019t trust. He knew that from what she\u2019d told him of her past. And when he\u2019d delved into her mind to pull her free of the darkness, he\u2019d seen the scars of betrayal. Scars he himself had lived with for way too long.</p><p>While he\u2019d been in her mind, he\u2019d also seen the dark Daemon threads that formed her connection to the clone. The threads weren\u2019t strong ones, but they were tangled. He was going to have to find a way back into her head, then take some time to free her. Time he hadn\u2019t had at that moment.</p><p>The one thing he might have succeeded in doing was closing the door in her mind that had been dropping her into the darkness every time she got a vision. As he\u2019d pulled her out, he\u2019d tried to close it behind him, but he wouldn\u2019t know if he\u2019d been successful until she had another vision. Even then, he couldn\u2019t be sure it wouldn\u2019t open and drag her down again. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A light rap on the door had Tighe crossing the comfortable, expensively appointed room. Unlike the house on Capitol Hill, this one was lived in by a high-ranking Therian council member and his mate, Therians more than willing to accommodate the Ferals\u2019 request for the house. The town house had a setup far more conducive to their current needs, with a full apartment on the lowest level at the base of an open stair. Jag, Hawke, and Kougar would remain upstairs, taking turns keeping tabs on Tighe, while the others searched for the clone. With the separate levels, and a bit of luck, Delaney would never see them.</p><p>Tighe opened the door to Hawke, who handed him a tray laden with cold meat, hot stew, and a pitcher of cold water.</p><p>\u201cKnock on the wall if you need anything.\u201d Hawke motioned toward Delaney with his head. \u201cShe should be coming out of it soon. I didn\u2019t press that hard.\u201d</p> <p>Tighe nodded, then turned at a sound from the bed. Delaney was beginning to stir. Hawke closed the door as Tighe set the tray down on the dresser, then stood rooted, watching as the woman who consumed his thoughts slowly opened her eyes.</p><p>Her head turned, and she froze as her gaze zeroed in on him. She stared at him, a strong, enigmatic tide rising inside her, and he was suddenly glad he\u2019d taken the time to take her weapons from her as she slept. Though that move might wind up saving his life, he\u2019d done it to save hers. He\u2019d have hated for one of those guns to have accidentally gone off as she slept. He\u2019d never have forgiven himself if she\u2019d died.</p><p>A fist clutched at his heart, possessiveness powering through him with a sudden, fierce anger. He paced in a tight, harsh path. It was all he could do not to lunge for her, to grab her by the shoulders and shake her.</p><p>\u201cWhat would have happened if you\u2019d had another of those visions, D? What if you got lost in there again?\u201d</p><p>As he railed, she swung her long legs over the side of the bed and firmly closed the distance between them. He braced himself for her attack.</p> <p>Until her lashes swept up, revealing eyes awash in tears.</p><p>\u201cD?\u201d</p><p>Her arms flew around his neck as her mouth reached for his kiss.</p><p>All thought flew from Tighe\u2019s head as he hauled her against him and kissed her, thrusting his tongue inside her warm and waiting mouth. Passion flared, a fire beyond anything he\u2019d ever known. Sweet nature, but he needed her. He needed to touch her, hold her, bury himself deep inside her.</p><p>Delaney clung to him as her soft, warm body pressed against him, and her fingers slid into his hair. She kissed him as if she were starving, and he was the finest feast, filling his chest with a wondrous, powerful pressure. He drank of her kisses, sweeping his tongue across her own, over her teeth and lips, unable to get enough.</p><p>His tattered soul sang as her mouth left his to trail kisses along his cheek and jaw, traveling down his neck, setting his skin aflame, lighting a fire with every soft, damp touch of her mouth.</p> <p>But he forced himself to pull away. \u201cDelaney.\u201d</p><p>Her dark gaze swung to his. \u201cI tried to stop you from driving into the trap. I couldn\u2019t do it, Tighe. I couldn\u2019t let them take you. But you knew I\u2019d set you up. How?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand you.\u201d</p><p>Those dark eyes studied him, a contrast of hard and soft. \u201cYou\u2019re not angry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat you endangered yourself, yes. But I understand why you did it. I respect why you did it. You\u2019re loyal to your job and to a greater cause, which you believe in. You owe me nothing, D. Not even your trust.\u201d He ran his palm over her soft hair. \u201cBut I can\u2019t tell you I\u2019m not glad you\u2019d changed your mind about letting them nail me.\u201d</p><p>Her palm lifted to lie warmly against his cheek, easing the tempest in his soul. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t trust you. I\u2019m not sure I do trust you. But I care what happens to you.\u201d</p><p>Tighe stroked her hair. \u201cI\u2019ve had the same thoughts, brown eyes. The exact same thoughts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s as if...I need you.\u201d She looked so confused, so lost. Again, almost exactly the way he felt himself.</p> <p>And needing her was the worst possible thing he could do. Because there were only two ways this could end for them. One, was death. The second, if they managed to catch his clone before his soul completely disintegrated, was apart. He\u2019d take her memories of him and send her back to her life while he turned back to his own. Unlike her, though, he wouldn\u2019t forget. He\u2019d never forget.</p><p>Goddess, but he didn\u2019t want to let her go.</p><p>Tighe swept her into his arms and carried her to the bed she\u2019d just vacated, depositing her in the middle and following her down as her arms opened to embrace him. The expression on her face was one of soft welcome and rough need. His breath caught as lust and tenderness barreled through him.</p><p>He covered her mouth again, needing to taste her. When he felt her hands move to tug his shirt out of his pants, his heart stuttered. Did she know what she was doing? Did he?</p><p>Her hand slid lower, between them, a single, soft stroke to his cock through his pants. His eyes rolled back in his head at the exquisite pleasure and the desire that swamped him. When his body was capable of movement again, he lifted his hand and covered her breast, desperate to touch her. Without clothes. Goddess, he wanted her without clothes.</p><p>Somewhere in the back of his mind, his logical self warned him this wasn\u2019t a good idea. She was human. Unacceptable as lover or mate. Worse, he could be riding the edge of chaos again at any moment. What if during the act of sex, as he lost control to the lovemaking, he lost control of himself? What if it shattered his soul once and for all?</p><p>Deep inside, the tiger shook its head. Making love to her was all that would keep him together.</p><p>Tighe pushed himself onto his knees and straddled her as he unbuttoned his shirt and shrugged out of it. Then his fingers moved to her white blouse and quickly unbuttoned it, pushing aside the flaps to reveal a tan lace bra covering firm mounds, the dark nipples just peeking through.</p><p>Heat surged inside him, sending the blood pumping straight to his erection.</p><p>With a quick flick, he unlatched the front clasp of her lacey bra, unwrapping her soft, full breasts for his waiting eyes.</p><p>She was beautiful. Beautiful. He covered those perfect mounds with his hands, feeling the hard nubs graze his palms. His fingers pressed into the softness that molded to his shaking hands, drawing a low moan of desire from Delaney\u2019s throat. He squeezed her breasts, then pinched her nipples. Not too hard, but hard enough to elicit a gasp. He moved down on her, his head dipping to take one plump nipple into his mouth, stroking the hard nub with his tongue as his hand squeezed and kneaded the other.</p><p>\u201cTighe.\u201d His name on her lips was soft as a breath and filled with such need he thought he might lose it then and there. \u201cI want you inside me.\u201d</p><p>With a last flick of his tongue over the hard bud, he lifted his face to peer down into hers. His breath caught at the need he saw in her face.</p><p>Her fingers rose to spread over his chest. A groan escaped his throat for one hot moment, before he dipped his head and took her other breast in his mouth.</p><p>Inside her. It was the only place he wanted to be, but he needed more. He needed everything. To touch every inch of her. To taste every part of her.</p><p>Now. He had to taste her now.</p><p>Tighe moved back and unfastened her belt and pants with shaking fingers, then yanked them off her, hooking his fingers into her panties and removing them at the same time, baring her long legs to his hungry gaze. Long legs tipped with dark socks and an ankle holster.</p><p>With a hungry grin, he removed the last articles of clothing, then sat back and stared at her.</p><p>Sweet thunder. His palms slid up those long legs, his palms rough against her satin flesh as he traced her trim calves, her knees. His thumbs brushed the insides of her thighs, eliciting a gasp from her, sending his pulse rate soaring.</p><p>Gripping her legs just above the knee, he opened her, lifting her knees and spreading her wide, like parting twin doors to reveal the treasure inside. His heart nearly stopped beating at the perfection revealed to his seeking gaze. Nestled between slender thighs, she was perfect. Swollen, open, and as dewy as a flower at dawn.</p><p>\u201cTighe.\u201d Her voice throbbed with desire.</p><p>He tore his gaze away from her body and met her eyes. The heat swirling in those dark, vibrant depths was nearly his undoing. He ached to enter her, but not yet. Not until neither of them could stand it a moment longer. Because he feared this might be the only time he ever would.</p><p>\u201cPatience, brown eyes. I\u2019m getting there. But I have to taste you.\u201d</p><p>Like a predator pouncing on prey, he knelt between her legs and went down on her, stroking his tongue along that long, perfect opening. She jerked, arching, her fingers clutching in his hair as a low moan vibrated through her entire body. Her pleasure weaved through his own, heightening his enjoyment and desire. He pressed his tongue deep within those open folds, tasting her sweet nectar, then found the hard knot between those folds and flicked it with his tongue.</p><p>Delaney cried out, her fingers digging into his scalp.</p><p>With a hard grin of satisfaction, he pleasured her until she was writhing beneath his mouth.</p><p>\u201cTighe. Tighe.\u201d</p><p>She was nearly to climax, but he wasn\u2019t ready to take her there. Not until he was buried deep inside her. She would fly for him. For him.</p><p>With a last thrust of his tongue, Tighe moved up her body, kissing her stomach, then the cleft between her breasts.</p><p>Delaney cradled his head in her arms as he kissed first one breast, then the other, then lifted his face to her. She pulled him up and kissed him hard even as she rocked her hips against his painfully hard erection.</p><p>\u201cCome inside me,\u201d she whispered against his lips. \u201cNow, Tighe. I need you, now.\u201d</p><p>His hands cradled her face, then dove into her hair. \u201cNot, yet, brown eyes. I\u2019m not through loving your body. I may not be through for hours.\u201d</p><p>Her groan made him smile, and he thought he might just be telling the truth. He was going to love her so thoroughly, mark her so completely that even when he\u2019d stolen her memories of him from her mind, she\u2019d remember their lovemaking in her dreams. He wanted that. With a ferocity that made no sense, he wanted to live somewhere in her mind. Forever.</p><p>She tried to reach for his cock, and he grabbed her wrist.</p><p>\u201cEasy, D. One stroke, and it might just be over. And neither of us wants that.\u201d</p><p>She made a sound that was half groan, half laughter. \u201cSpeak for yourself.\u201d She pushed at his chest. \u201cBut if that\u2019s the way you want it, lie down. It\u2019s my turn.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t think it was possible, but he got even harder. \u201cYou touch me in any way, and it\u2019s going to be over.\u201d</p><p>A small knowing smile lifted her lips. \u201cThen I won\u2019t touch you there.\u201d</p><p>Hesitating for only a moment, he moved off her and did as she demanded, watching, enrapt, as she stripped out of her jacket, shirt, and bra with a single move. She was glorious in her nakedness, her dark hair falling around her shoulders in soft waves. With a move that sent fire arcing through his veins, she lifted one leg and straddled him, her wet sheath nestled tight against his zipper.</p><p>From her perch, she watched him with a mixture of softness and power. On his tongue he tasted the sweetness of an emotion he couldn\u2019t quite put a name to, an emotion he could taste for the rest of his life and never tire of.</p><p>Delaney leaned forward, her fingers tracing the gold armband on his arm, then moving over the feral mark, the claw marks, above his left breast, exploring him. She bent her head until her lips brushed the feral marks, sending a shock of chills through his body.</p><p>She was kissing the very thing that had once destroyed everything he\u2019d cared about, as if she understood. As if she accepted them. And him.</p><p>When nothing could be further from the truth.</p><p>Delaney Randall had no idea he\u2019d been marked by the tiger. That he was immortal. That he was a shape-shifter. And if she ever figured out what he was, she\u2019d turn and run. Just as Gretchen had.</p><p>No she wouldn\u2019t. Running wasn\u2019t her style. Delaney would get her gun and hunt him down like the monster he was.</p><p>She rose from kissing his chest, her eyes tight with question and soft with concern as she laid her hand over the scars on his chest.</p><p>\u201cThat bothered you. That I kissed you there.\u201d</p><p>Had his thoughts shown that clearly? He reached for her, stroking her cheek. \u201cThe scars bring back memories. Unpleasant ones. You didn\u2019t do anything wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry for whatever hurt you, Tighe. Or whoever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a long time ago.\u201d But warmth filled his chest at the compassion in her eyes. Sweet nature, but he wouldn\u2019t allow anyone to hurt her. Ever. Even after he\u2019d stolen her memories of him, he\u2019d watch over her from a distance. Protect her in any way he could for the short years of her existence.</p><p>The thought of it, that she wouldn\u2019t be completely lost to him, eased the tight ache in his chest. She wouldn\u2019t be out of his life. His role in hers would just change.</p><p>But this would probably be the only time he\u2019d ever make love to her.</p><p>Chapter Sixteen</p><p>Delaney ran her hands over the hard planes of Tighe\u2019s chest as she straddled his half-clothed body, reveling in the beauty of the man. Sunshine poured across his muscled contours, glinting off the antique gold armband he wore, an armband, she realized, with an attractive, stylized tiger\u2019s head. Her gaze moved to the rippling muscles of his arms as damp heat pooled deep in her body. He was glorious, and she wanted him so badly, she was shaking with it.</p><p>Bracing her hands on his chest, she rubbed herself against the hard length of the erection between her legs, an erection still fully covered by his pants. It was a problem she was more than ready to dispose of.</p><p>\u201cD.\u201d He gripped her hips, holding her still. \u201cNot yet.\u201d He looked up at her with an expression that seemed to be a mix of heat, pain, and tenderness. Seemed to be because she couldn\u2019t see his eyes behind those shades. He\u2019d never once let her see his eyes, and she wanted to see them. Needed to see them. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She reached for his sunglasses, but he snatched her wrists. \u201cNo, brown eyes.\u201d He lifted his hips, pressing against her sensitive flesh, distracting her as he no doubt intended. \u201cUndress me, Delaney.\u201d</p><p>For a moment longer, she looked at his face, always half-closed to her. He didn\u2019t fully trust her. And why should he, any more than she trusted him? They were on opposite sides of the law. From opposite worlds.</p><p>What was she even doing with him? She knew virtually nothing about him. She didn\u2019t even know his full name!</p> <p>He rocked against her again, sending pleasure cascading through her body. Reminding her where she was. And what she wanted. At this moment, at least.</p><p>Theirs wasn\u2019t a relationship so much as an encounter. And it wouldn\u2019t last. It couldn\u2019t last. But for this short time, he was hers, and she intended to enjoy every moment of it.</p><p>She bent her head to trail her lips over the hard planes of his body, then reached for the zipper of his pants.</p><p>He groaned. \u201cD.\u201d</p><p>She pulled his pants off him as he had hers. Beneath the soft jeans she found green silk boxers and slid her palm against the ridge beneath.</p> <p>Tighe sucked his breath in hard. \u201cTake them off,\u201d he groaned. And she did, sliding the silky fabric down his hips, revealing the largest, thickest erection she\u2019d ever seen. Not that she\u2019d seen that many. All of two. Still, Tighe\u2019s was...extraordinary.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re huge,\u201d she breathed.</p><p>Even through his sunglasses, she could feel his gaze on her. His fingers slid between her legs. \u201cThat\u2019s why you\u2019re going to be ready, sweetheart. Wet and open and crying for me to take you before I enter you.\u201d</p><p>His words sent the heat inside her flaring as she groaned from his touch. \u201cWhat makes you think I\u2019m not already?\u201d She pulled his boxers all the way off, but as she turned to toss them onto the floor, Tighe rose and grabbed her around the waist, turning her until she was on her hands and knees on the bed.</p><p>\u201cTighe.\u201d</p><p>He knelt beside her, one hand cupping her breast while the other traced her spine to her tailbone and lower, sliding into the crease of her buttocks. His finger found her wet, ready heat and slid inside.</p> <p>Fire shot through her, and she arched, hissing with pleasure as his finger dove deep inside her. She pressed against his hand, wanting more. Needing more.</p><p>\u201cEasy, brown eyes.\u201d He added a second finger, then a third. While his fingers probed her depths, his other hand played with her breast, twirling her nipple until she was gasping with desire.</p><p>\u201cTighe.\u201d</p><p>By the time his fingers left her, her breathing was labored, her pulse thick, desire pounding through her body. She rose onto her knees and faced him, pushing at his shoulders. \u201cI either want you inside me, or I want to taste you, as you tasted me. Your choice.\u201d</p><p>His mouth widened, not quite a smile, but definitely a satisfied look. Then he pulled her against him, chest to chest, and kissed her, sweeping his tongue inside her mouth.</p><p>Without warning, he fell back onto the pillow, pulling her down on top of him. \u201cYou can taste me. For as long as I can stand it. Goddess, but I want your lips on me.\u201d</p><p>He released her, and she smiled, pushing herself off his chest and turning, her gaze caressing that long thickness. With a single finger, she traced the throbbing vein running from the base of his shaft all the way to the head, delighting in the sharp intake of his breath.</p><p>Her fingers slid down the satin flesh, reveling in the feel of him. Clasping him gently, she bent and ran her tongue over the slit at the tip, tasting the drop of moisture clinging there. She twirled her tongue around the head and was just about to pull him fully into her mouth when his hands grabbed her hips.</p> <p>\u201cLift your leg, D.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not through.\u201d</p><p>He moaned. \u201cI hope not. But I want my mouth on you, too.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened, and she grabbed hold of his thighs, bracing herself as he pulled her hips back and situated her knees on either side of his face.</p><p>Then...oh God. At the exact moment he thrust his shaft into her mouth, his tongue dove into her core. Sensations exploded throughout her body as she sucked on the flesh in her mouth, giving him pleasure even as she took it from him in return. His lovemaking was a heady mix of gentleness and aggression, his hands on her hips shaking, gripping her tightly, telling her clearly of his own barely restrained passion.</p><p>He began to suck on her sensitive nub until her hips were rocking of their own volition, desperate for the release that was almost there. Almost there. The closer she came to completion, the harder she sucked on him, until he suddenly pulled her away and flipped her onto her back.</p><p>Then he was over her, spreading her legs with his knee. \u201cI have to be inside you, brown eyes.\u201d His voice was taut. Pained.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook at me, Delaney. Look at me.\u201d</p><p>But when she tried, all she saw was herself reflected in those damned sunglasses. Her spurt of annoyance disappeared as he pushed that thick head against her opening. She gasped as he pressed into her, stretching her. Her body was wet and ready, and the feel of him exquisite. Beyond pleasure. Beyond anything she\u2019d ever dreamed she could feel.</p><p>\u201cOkay?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d she groaned, wrapping her arms around his sweat-slicked back. \u201cYes. Oh, yes. Better than okay. Better than...Oh, Tighe,\u201d she moaned, as he pushed all the way inside, pulled nearly out of her, then thrust back inside, faster than before. Her eyes rolled back, her eyelids dropping as incredible pleasure became her entire world.</p><p>\u201cDelaney, look at me.\u201d</p><p>She forced her eyes open as he thrust inside her again and again, his rhythm hard and demanding, at once rough and infinitely gentle.</p><p>Again, she stared at herself in the reflection of his sunglasses. Blast it. Here they were as intimate as they could possibly be, and she couldn\u2019t even see his eyes. On a spurt of annoyance, she reached up and grabbed the sunglasses, yanked them off his face, and tossed them onto the floor.</p><p>\u201cD, no.\u201d His eyes snapped closed before she could see so much as a hint of the green eyes she\u2019d seen on his twin. \u201cDamn it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to see you.\u201d</p><p>Eyes closed, he thrust into her, his face a hard mask of concentration. \u201cYour timing sucks, brown eyes.\u201d His mouth came down on hers, and he kissed her hard, almost punishingly, driving home just how little she knew him.</p><p>Just how many secrets lay between them.</p><p>A lump formed in her throat, mired in anger, even as her body rose, swept away by the desire that flared within her whenever he was close. When the orgasm finally swept over her, she gave herself to it, soaring briefly before crashing back to reality.</p><p>She\u2019d given herself to a man in a mask. A man who, even in lovemaking, kept a solid wall between them. What an idiot she was for thinking she could trust him. How could she forget she knew virtually nothing about him. Good grief, she didn\u2019t even know his full name.</p><p>She\u2019d never even seen his eyes!</p><p>Tighe finished on a satisfied groan, then almost immediately pulled out of her and vaulted to the floor to fetch his sunglasses.</p><p>Angry with him and disgusted with herself, she rolled off the bed on the other side, gathered up her clothes, and strode to the bathroom visible on the other side of the room.</p><p>\u201cD?\u201d</p><p>She slammed the door and locked it behind her. Then she dropped her clothes on the cushioned stool and leaned back against the door.</p><p>Sex with a stranger. That\u2019s all it had been. A man she didn\u2019t even know. A man who wouldn\u2019t even look her in the eye. When she\u2019d first woken up and seen him, she\u2019d felt a rush of joy, a need to be in his arms, as if that were the only place she truly belonged. For a short while, she\u2019d allowed herself to be swept away by the fantasy that he was a good man. A man who\u2019d come after her because he cared about her. A fantasy that she was falling just a little bit in love with him.</p><p>Ludicrous.</p><p>For him she was only a means to an end. A way to catch his brother. And she was an FBI agent with the same mission. It was time she remembered that.</p><p>With a growl of frustration, she pushed away from the door to start the shower. He was her captor, plain and simple. Forgetting that small fact and deluding herself into thinking she was developing feelings for him could well get her killed.</p><p>Tighe stared at the closed bathroom door, Delaney\u2019s bitter unhappiness lingering on his tongue. He\u2019d known there could never be anything real between them. There were too many lies. Too much she must never know.</p><p>And she was beginning to understand that he would never let her in. He\u2019d hoped he could at least finish making love to her before the truth came crashing down on him, but even that wasn\u2019t meant to be.</p><p>He locked the bedroom door from the outside, then went upstairs to take a shower and change.</p><p>\u201cNo wonder you were so keen on getting your hands on this one again,\u201d Jag drawled as he walked through the upstairs living room. \u201cI heard her screaming from here.\u201d</p><p>Tighe whirled on him. \u201cDo you want to see my claws?\u201d he bit out.</p><p>Jag lifted his hands, palms out. \u201cNope. Don\u2019t mind me.\u201d</p><p>Tighe took a quick shower and was back in the basement apartment, waiting for her, when Delaney came out of the bathroom.</p><p>Her gaze met his only briefly as she stepped into the bedroom, dressed once more in the white shirt and navy pants, her hair wet and slicked back from her face.</p><p>\u201cWhere are my guns?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSafe. And out of your reach.\u201d</p><p>She crossed her arms over her chest and lifted her chin in challenge. \u201cYou said once that if you could get rid of my memories of you, you\u2019d let me go. Is that still true?\u201d</p><p>Inside, the tiger shook its head in denial.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He met that challenging gaze, his chest seizing. \u201cIf I can get into your mind, I can free you. Then I can absolutely let you go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t remember anything? I won\u2019t remember you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>She nodded once with hard satisfaction. \u201cDo it.\u201d</p><p>No. Not yet. He wasn\u2019t ready to send her back. Yet if he could get inside her head, he knew what had to be done to free her from those visions. Which meant he\u2019d almost certainly succeed in stealing her memories, too. He\u2019d succeed in wiping himself from her mind. And her life.</p><p>\u201cDelaney.\u201d</p><p>That was what he wanted, wasn\u2019t it? Of course it was. No attachments, especially to a human. Her back in her own world. Him free to fight the battles he had to fight without worrying about her.</p><p>Without her calming touch.</p><p>Without those wide, dark eyes questioning his every move. Filling with heat whenever he touched her. Shining with courage and fire and life.</p><p>\u201cNow, Tighe. I\u2019m tired of being your captive. I want my life back. I want you to get into my mind so I can be rid of you once and for all.\u201d</p><p>Her anger washed over him, a hot, biting rush that set off an ache deep in his chest. When he was through with her, she wouldn\u2019t remember him, not a thing about him. And he had a terrible feeling he would never forget her.</p><p>Tighe grabbed her face and kissed her hard, marking her, daring her to push him away. Daring her to prove she only wanted to be rid of him. Her resistance lasted all of five seconds, then she melted in his arms and kissed him back fiercely, her arms sliding around his neck, her tongue twisting and twining with his. Desire flared, and the next thing he knew, his hands were in her hair, and he was thinking of nothing but stripping her of the clothes she\u2019d just put on and sliding into her all over again.</p><p>What am I doing?</p><p>He wasn\u2019t thinking. He couldn\u2019t think when she was close, let alone touching him, kissing him. Forcing himself to pull back, he stared down into her dazed eyes.</p><p>An odd mix of protectiveness and tenderness welled inside him, the ache in his chest intensifying as he raised his hand and stroked her cheek.</p><p>She was right. As much as he hated the prospect of wiping himself from her life, the sooner he did it the better. If he hadn\u2019t freed her by the time his soul splintered, her life was over. Lyon would see to it.</p><p>He traced her high cheekbone with his thumb.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to do it?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Tighe nodded slowly, pulling his scattered thoughts to the task at hand. Never before had he had any trouble clouding the thoughts of a human. But never before had he tried to breach the formidable barriers of Delaney Randall. And maybe that was the problem.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you try helping me this time, D? When you feel me pressing against your mind, let me in. Don\u2019t fight me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not fighting you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you are, though maybe not consciously. This time, I want you to think about wanting me to come in. Do you remember when I pulled you out of the darkness?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this the same?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a way, yes. But you weren\u2019t at the gates that night. You weren\u2019t there at all. I had to go deep to find you and pull you back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould you have captured my mind then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably. If I\u2019d had time. Once I get in there, I have to disentangle you from the clone.\u201d</p><p>She watched him warily. \u201cFrom the what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom the...never mind. If it gets bad, tell me, and I\u2019ll quit. Are you ready?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He pushed her damp hair back from her face with his fingers. \u201cThink of that night, D, of how I came for you. Think of how you needed me. How you could need me again. Then let me in. Right now, right here. Let me in, Delaney.\u201d</p><p>His thumbs moved to her temples, and he rubbed gently, staring deep into her eyes. \u201cI won\u2019t hurt you, brown eyes. Let me in.\u201d He didn\u2019t push this time, but still, he tasted her desire on his tongue, rising more slowly, but rising all the same. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to make me come again, aren\u2019t you?\u201d she whispered, but her voice was soft, with little inflection, as if she were at least partially mesmerized.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not the plan, but it seems to happen every time I get too close to you, doesn\u2019t it? Relax, Delaney. Let me in.\u201d</p><p>Little by little, he felt her resistance give way. Excitement lifted his pulse. Dismay caught in his chest. It was going to work. He was going to be able to send her back.</p> <p>He felt her mind catch with his and open. He was in.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a girl. Just relax, D. Let\u2019s see what we\u2019ve got here.\u201d With his mind he found again that twisted, tangled mass of dark Daemon threads and tried to follow it, to find the place where they attached. Damn, but they went deeper than he\u2019d expected.</p><p>Beneath his hands, he felt her tensing. \u201cIs this getting uncomfortable?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHang in there, sweetheart.\u201d Maybe it wasn\u2019t as bad as it looked. Maybe if he...</p> <p>He gave a mental tug on one of the threads.</p><p>Delaney gasped.</p><p>\u201cThat hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Damn. Little by little, he eased deeper, feeling her stiffen. If he could just find the source.</p><p>Once more, he gave a gentle tug, but Delaney cried out, and he stopped. Dammit. There was no way he could hope to free her without damaging her. There was nothing he could do for either of them but kill that son of a bitch clone.</p> <p>Deep in his own mind, the tiger raised his head and gave a soft roar of satisfaction, then leaped to his feet, eyeing the bright opening into Delaney\u2019s mind.</p><p>Tighe saw what was about to happen. His mind seized. He had no way to stop it.</p><p>The tiger, already intrigued by her, leaped through that opening, trying to claim her for his own.</p><p>Delaney screamed.</p><p>Tighe wrenched the tiger back, but it was too late.</p><p>Delaney reared back, her pulse rocketing upward, her eyes glazing with terror, triggering the ancient fury that lived inside him, the rage of Gretchen\u2019s betrayal, as fearful eyes always did.</p><p>But the fury was too much for his thinning control. He clawed to hang on, to keep from losing himself in a feral rage from which he might never escape. But it was too late.</p><p>End over end, his mind tumbled into the chaos, hurtling him headlong toward that black abyss.</p> <p>Chapter Seventeen</p><p>Delaney stared in horror as the frightening vision in her mind gave way to a far more terrifying one in front of her. As Tighe released her, claws sprouted from his fingertips. Fangs sprang from his gums.</p><p>She stumbled back, slamming into the wall, her pulse pounding in her throat.</p><p>\u201cTighe?\u201d</p><p>As she stared at him, colored lights erupted beneath his skin. And suddenly he was gone.</p><p>A tiger...a tiger...</p><p>This. Is. Not. Happening.</p><p>She was not staring at a huge tiger. The very beast who\u2019d leaped at her in her head!</p><p>Her blood went cold. Her head began to spin. Not real. Not happening.</p><p>She was crazy. Crazy.</p><p>The tiger turned to her, staring at her with the same hunger she\u2019d seen in her mind. He started toward her. Panic ignited.</p><p>With a strangled scream, she whirled and lunged for the door before he attacked her. Before he tried to rip her limb from limb.</p><p>As she reached for the door, she looked back only to see the tiger disappear in the same wash of sparkling lights, returning to the creature that was neither man nor beast, but something horribly in between.</p><p>With a strangled cry, she grabbed the door, frantic to escape. Too late. Sharp knives plunged into her shoulders. She screamed from the pain, from the terror of knowing she was about to become tiger food.</p><p>The creature pulled the knives from her and whipped her around. Blood dripped from his claws. Her blood. He squeezed her shoulders, sinking those claws into her a second time.</p><p>Her mind went white with pain as she flung her head back. Unable to move. Unable to breathe. Blood ran down her chest and back and trickled down her arms.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t fear me!\u201d he growled between those terrifying teeth.</p><p>Tighe\u2019s voice. \u201cTighe.\u201d The word came out on a hiss of pain as her vision started to darken around the edges.</p><p>Behind her, the door burst open, knocking her into the creature. Tighe. Not Tighe.</p><p>His grip on her tightened. She screamed.</p><p>Two large men hurtled into the room and pulled Tighe off her in a haze of blood and agony, attacking him. Tackling him to the ground, ripping at him with fangs and claws.</p><p>Not real. Not real.</p><p>One hard swipe ripped Tighe\u2019s face wide open. The flesh hung in bloody strips from the bones.</p><p>They were going to kill him.</p><p>She tried to lunge forward but was held back by a strong arm around her waist. \u201cLet\u2019s get you out of here.\u201d That voice. The same one who\u2019d rescued her from Tighe\u2019s violence. The one who\u2019d knocked her out beside the Tidal Basin.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re going to kill him.\u201d She struggled against the heavy weakness and terrible pain, struggled to free herself. \u201cI can\u2019t let them kill him!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll be fine, Delaney. You\u2019re the only one in danger here.\u201d</p><p>He half pushed her, half carried her out of the room, then swept her up as her legs gave way. The pain was too much. Tears slid down her cheeks.</p><p>The man lowered her onto a sofa. She collapsed against the soft back, then cried out at the pressure against her wounds.</p><p>The man took her hand and she gripped his hard, gasping to breathe against the pain.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry you had to get mixed up in this.\u201d</p><p>His long face swam in the narrowing circle of her vision. Her head was too heavy to hold up, and she had to let it fall back against the sofa, but she struggled to meet the man\u2019s dark gaze.</p><p>\u201cHelp him. Please.\u201d</p><p>Dimly, voices penetrated the haze of violence.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s alive, but she won\u2019t stay that way for long unless we get her to a healer. She\u2019s bleeding like a sieve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet her die. She\u2019s seen too much.\u201d</p><p>No! The denial rang through Tighe\u2019s head, but no human sound came from his mouth. Nothing but snarls and growls as he thrashed against the restraints, pinned beneath the weight of three men.</p><p>Hawke\u2019s face appeared in front of him. \u201cFight your way back, buddy. Delaney\u2019s going to die if you don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds to me like she\u2019s going to die either way,\u201d a third voice drawled.</p><p>Hawke scowled. \u201cShut up, Jag.\u201d</p><p>The faces bled together, merging with the colors that passed for his sight. Reds and yellows and oranges. Violence. Fury.</p><p>He growled, struggling to free himself. To attack.</p><p>\u201cCan you hear me, Tighe? Fight your way out of there, buddy. You hurt Delaney. She\u2019s bleeding badly. She needs you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy the fuck do you think he cares?\u201d Jag drawled.</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t care,\u201d Kougar replied. \u201cHe\u2019s using her to reach the visions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe cares,\u201d Hawke said. \u201cDon\u2019t you, buddy?\u201d Hawke\u2019s face swam back into focus. \u201cDo you know, she fought me when I tried to get her out of here? She was struggling to get to you. To save you. From us.\u201d</p><p>The words penetrated the feral rage to reach his mind. She was trying to save him. Save him.</p><p>\u201cBrown eyes.\u201d The words were more growl than actual words, but he formed them.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it, Tighe. Come back to us. Fight your way back, buddy.\u201d</p><p>She needs me. Brown eyes needs me.</p><p>He fought the chaos, struggling against its hard grip until he was sweating and panting from exertion. Finally, finally, with a groan of exhausted triumph, he pulled out of its grasp and away from the fury, snapping back into his skin.</p><p>His fangs and claws retracted, and he collapsed against the floor.</p><p>\u201cGet off me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet him go!\u201d Hawke snapped.</p><p>Kougar and Jag released him, and Tighe struggled to his feet, exhausted and bloody. \u201cWhere is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe sofa.\u201d</p><p>Tighe stumbled through the door, his strength returning with every step. But he pulled up short when he saw her. Ice washed through his veins. She was sitting up, but barely, sunk deep into the sofa cushions, drenched in blood. Her blood. Which he\u2019d drawn.</p><p>Sweet thunder. What have I done?</p><p>He sank onto the sofa beside her and stared at her too-pale face. \u201cDelaney.\u201d</p><p>Her lashes swept slowly upward, her dark eyes glazed. \u201cTighe?\u201d</p><p>His knuckles brushed her cheek. Unblemished. Thank the goddess he hadn\u2019t tried to hold her face. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, brown eyes. I never meant to hurt you. I\u2019m going to get you help.\u201d He turned to find Hawke standing in the doorway watching him.</p><p>\u201cCall Esmeria. Tell her we\u2019re on our way.\u201d</p><p>But Hawke didn\u2019t move. Kougar stepped into the doorway behind him. \u201cIt\u2019s forbidden to take a human to the enclave. You know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t give a fuck what\u2019s forbidden. She\u2019s going to die!\u201d</p><p>He grabbed his cell phone and speed dialed Lyon and began talking the second Lyon answered. \u201cI went feral and attacked the Fed. She needs a healer. Either I take her to a human hospital or to Esmeria. Your call, but you\u2019re making it now. She\u2019s out of time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you taken her memories?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe saw you feral?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s seen it all. Feral, tiger, shift, you name it. I lost control. I tried to shift to my tiger to regain it, but I couldn\u2019t stay there. I was too far gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTighe...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d He knew what he was going to say. \u201cShe lives, Roar. You have two choices, and that\u2019s it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe can\u2019t be near other humans with the knowledge she now possesses. Nor can you take her to other Therians when you can\u2019t wipe her mind.\u201d</p><p>Tighe began to growl low in his throat, the fury threatening to sweep him away all over again until Delaney\u2019s soft hand slid over the back of his, pulling him back into his skin.</p><p>\u201cTighe.\u201d Hawke\u2019s voice dragged his attention back into the room. \u201cPut Lyon on speaker.\u201d</p><p>With only a moment\u2019s hesitation, Tighe pressed the button.</p><p>Lyon\u2019s deep voice echoed into the room. \u201cNeither option is acceptable, Stripes. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Hawke took a step toward the phone. \u201cThere\u2019s another option, Chief. If he binds her to him, she can\u2019t betray him. Or us.\u201d</p><p>Tighe\u2019s blood went cold. Bind her? A human? \u201cNo way. I\u2019m not making her my mate.\u201d</p><p>Hawke shrugged. \u201cYour choice.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t. Couldn\u2019t.</p><p>It wouldn\u2019t be for long. Sixty years. Maybe seventy. Not long. But she knew what he was now. Seventy years living with that look of fear, that loathing.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen she dies,\u201d Hawke said softly.</p><p>Marry her or let her die.</p><p>Your choice. But was it?</p><p>He looked down at Delaney and found her watching him, a glimmer of warrior\u2019s strength still visible in the dull pools of pain that had become her eyes.</p><p>A blade ripped through his chest at the thought of permanently quelling that bright, fierce spirit.</p><p>\u201cWhich do you choose, Delaney, knowing what I am? Death? Or me for the rest of your life? Your choice.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t hesitate. \u201cDon\u2019t...want to die.\u201d</p><p>He squeezed her hand. \u201cThen you won\u2019t. You won\u2019t die.\u201d What am I doing? He turned back to the phone. \u201cI\u2019m binding her.\u201d His gaze speared Hawke\u2019s. \u201cCall Esmeria and tell her we\u2019ll pick her up in ten minutes. Bring whatever she needs to heal a human in the car. We\u2019re going to Feral House.\u201d</p><p>What am I doing?</p><p>But he knew. As he\u2019d done six hundred years before, he was once again consigning himself to the hell of tying himself to a human.</p><p>Chapter Eighteen</p><p>Paenther\u2019s fist tapped with rhythmic frustration against the car\u2019s door handle as Foxx drove past yet another damned field full of cows. The hills of the Blue Ridge rose around them, keeping their secrets...if they held any.</p><p>He was seriously beginning to think Foxx\u2019s intuitive gift had flown. They\u2019d found no sign of the Mage. No sign of Vhyper. Goddamn nothing.</p><p>Except a girl with eyes like a summer sky. A girl he couldn\u2019t get out of his head.</p><p>\u201cGo back to that country store we stopped at yesterday. The one set into the hillside. The Market.\u201d</p><p>The words were out before he had time to think about them, but he didn\u2019t call them back. He flexed and fisted both hands, hating the uncharacteristic lack of control that had him needing to see her again.</p><p>Goddess help him, he was acting like a fifteen-year-old with a massive hard-on.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Foxx threw him a questioning look. \u201cI thought we were going to take this search systematically.\u201d</p><p>Paenther growled. \u201cJust do it.\u201d He\u2019d finally given up hope that Foxx would lead them to the exact location. Knowing the Mage would be in some kind of mansion, they\u2019d downloaded satellite images of the mountains and had been traveling from estate to estate ever since. In his animal form, Foxx was able to run right up to the houses and have a look around. Paenther had to wait for nightfall to join him since he lacked the ability to downsize into a house cat. If they did stumble onto a Mage stronghold, his panther form would give him away in a heartbeat.</p><p>So far, they\u2019d struck out.</p><p>Yet Foxx continued to insist they\u2019d find Vhyper in the Blue Ridge.</p><p>For twenty-four hours they\u2019d searched estate after estate. Paenther pressed his fists into his thighs. For twenty-four hours, he hadn\u2019t been able to quit wondering how the ethereal beauty with the sky blue eyes tasted. How she smelled. How she\u2019d feel around his shaft as he buried himself deep inside her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Foxx gave a put-upon sigh and turned the car around, heading back to the store.</p><p>She probably wouldn\u2019t be there. And even if she was, she was probably married, or taken, or completely uninterested.</p><p>No, not uninterested. Of that he was sure. She\u2019d felt that heat, too.</p> <p>If she wasn\u2019t there, he\u2019d forget her. If she was there, and he didn\u2019t feel the same punch of lust, he\u2019d walk away. And if she was there, and he felt the way he had yesterday?</p><p>He\u2019d have to take it one step at a time.</p><p>A half hour later, they pulled into the parking lot in a spray of dust and gravel, just like before. The old brick store looked even more decrepit than he remembered, if such a thing were possible. Clean enough\u2014no trash or broken-down cars littered the place\u2014but the building was definitely in need of a little TLC.</p><p>Foxx\u2019s stomach rumbled as he threw the car into park. \u201cI\u2019m hungry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat else is new?\u201d</p> <p>Foxx pushed out of the car and headed for the store without a backward glance, not bothering to ask if Paenther wanted anything this time. It was clear he did, or he wouldn\u2019t have demanded they come back here. Fortunately, Foxx didn\u2019t seem to have a clue just what it was that his companion wanted.</p><p>Paenther climbed out of the car more slowly, feeling as off-balance as he had yesterday. After four hundred years, one would think a man would outgrow that peculiar awkwardness of first infatuation, yet here he was, palms damp, pulse racing.</p><p>The last thing he needed was the distraction of a woman. Her beauty had undoubtedly grown way out of proportion in his mind. That was the true reason he\u2019d insisted on returning. Once he saw her again, saw that she was nothing out of the ordinary, he\u2019d be able to forget about her and stay focused on the only things that mattered.</p><p>As he crossed the parking lot, the wind rattled in the trees, tugging at his hair and coat, the loamy scent of the woods mixing with the dust of the parking lot.</p><p>Hell, she probably isn\u2019t even here.</p><p>But as he reached for the front door, a movement out of the corner of his eye caught his attention. He turned...and froze. She stood outside, at the corner of the building, in a shapeless pale green dress that somehow only accentuated her delicate beauty. Watching him.</p> <p>Damn, but she was even more lovely than he\u2019d remembered.</p><p>She smiled. His heart rate soared, and he was closing the distance between them before he\u2019d given any conscious thought to whether or not he should. As he neared, she backed up, one small step at a time, turning the corner into shade. And privacy.</p><p>Paenther followed her into the sharply cooler air of the shade, then stopped two arm lengths away, trapped between the invitation in her bright blue eyes and the disbelief of the warrior inside him. What am I doing? Vhyper needs me.</p><p>Squirrels chattered in the sun-drenched trees behind the building. Vhyper was nowhere to be found. And he just wanted a kiss. For the first time in as far back as he could remember, lust had risen, curling up through the burning wreckage the Mage had made of his soul. He wanted. Needed. And the feel of it was intoxicating.</p><p>He took a step toward her, then stopped again. The last thing he wanted to do was frighten her. Like all Ferals, he was bigger than most human males. And there was something innately fragile about her.</p><p>To his surprised relief, she took the pursuit out of his hands and closed the distance between them, gliding into his arms with lightness and grace. He instinctively cradled her against him like the most delicate flower even as she wrapped her arms around his neck and pressed her mouth to his.</p><p>Fire erupted in his chest, rushing out and down, heating his limbs and body and blood in a way that pleasured instead of pained. All thought of gentleness flew from his head as she swept her tongue into his mouth with a strength and certainty that had him suddenly wondering if her delicacy had more to do with a lack of age.</p><p>He pulled back from the kiss, keeping her tight against his body as he stared down into that exquisite face.</p> <p>\u201cHow old are you, beauty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOld enough.\u201d That smile played at her mouth, her eyes twinkling with a depth that reassured him she was no child.</p><p>He covered her mouth, sweeping his tongue into hers as he pulled her tight against him. She tasted like the raindrops of old, sweet and pure, and smelled like violets. And he wanted her with a need unlike anything he\u2019d ever experienced. With each stroke of his tongue against hers, his body hardened until he was throbbing with the desire to be inside her.</p><p>Her arm slipped from around his neck and moved down to slide over that distended part of his anatomy. The air hissed into his mouth as he pulled back, his gaze driving into hers.</p><p>Blue eyes swam with passion and a need nearly as great as his own.</p><p>He pressed his lips to her temple as he slid his palm down her thigh, then up again, lifting the skirt of her dress until he found the hem. He reached beneath, his fingers skimming her warm thighs, his hand sliding between them, rising to the bare, damp core of her.</p><p>The woman wore no undergarments.</p><p>A smile pulled as his mouth as he kissed her hard and slid a single shaking finger deep inside her tight, wet sheath.</p><p>He needed to be inside her.</p><p>A movement in his peripheral vision had him pulling back, his head jerking to the corner of the building. Foxx stood there staring at him, one hand loaded with hot dogs, the other with a massive drink, his eyebrows shooting into his hairline.</p><p>\u201cDude.\u201d</p><p>Paenther growled low in his throat, tempted to yank off the cub\u2019s ears.</p><p>With a small sound of dismay, the woman pulled out of his arms and fled.</p><p>Paenther curled his damp finger into his fist and let her go. His brilliant plan to get her out of his mind had failed. Spectacularly.</p><p>Chapter Nineteen</p><p>Delaney sat up slowly in the strange bed, logging her surroundings. Unfamiliar bedroom, daytime.</p><p>Tighe stood at the window, his back to her, in a pair of black leather pants and nothing else except the gold armband tight around his upper arm.</p><p>With a rush, she remembered what had happened. Or what her mind was trying to tell her had happened. Her pulse began to pound as she saw in her head again, the man turning into a tiger. Then morphing into a were-tiger or...God. He\u2019d sunk his claws deep into her shoulders until she was soaked with blood.</p><p>She struggled to calm her racing pulse. It hadn\u2019t happened. It was just a nightmare...or an hallucination thanks to the drugs he\u2019d pumped her full of.</p><p>Just to reassure herself, she shrugged and rolled her shoulders. No pain, just as she\u2019d known there wouldn\u2019t be. But when she glanced down at herself, at the unfamiliar gray tee shirt dotted with bloodstains all over the shoulders, her eyes went wide. Cold washed over her scalp.</p><p>\u201cOh, crap.\u201d Her mind began to buzz with disbelief, even as goose bumps rose on her skin.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re safe, Delaney,\u201d Tighe said without turning around, his voice cool and sharp. \u201cCalm down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Like I didn\u2019t just step into the Twilight Zone.\u201d Her gaze slid around the large, well-appointed, and decidedly masculine room with its jungle green walls and heavy wood furniture. One wall held an assortment of framed photos of airplanes. The others, a vast assortment of knives and swords interspersed with paintings of tigers.</p><p>Tigers. She struggled to contain the fear trembling deep inside her, afraid what might happen if she didn\u2019t. How many times had he said, Don\u2019t fear me? And look what had happened when she had.</p><p>Dear God. \u201cWhere are we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFeral House.\u201d Tighe turned around slowly, his hands clasped behind his back, his mouth tight. Sunglasses, as usual, covering his eyes.</p><p>A small bubble of hysteria tried to rise up her throat, but she swallowed it down, hard. Either she\u2019d gone insane, or her world had. And if it was the latter?</p><p>Even as she shuddered, she squared her shoulders. One way or another, she had to deal with it.</p><p>She watched him warily. \u201cAre you...did I really see you...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTurn into a tiger?\u201d He bit out the words as if daring her to accept them. \u201cYeah. You did.\u201d</p><p>She sat up straighter, pressing back against the headboard. \u201cHow do you do that? Change...like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think about shifting, and I shift.\u201d</p><p>Shift. From a man to a tiger. Her head rushed with cold. Ants crawled across her skin. \u201cHave you...always been this way?\u201d</p><p>Tighe scowled. \u201cI\u2019m not a science experiment. I\u2019m a shape-shifter. I have been for more than six hundred years.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened. \u201cSix hundred?\u201d</p><p>No way. No way. No way.</p><p>\u201cMy people are not human, Delaney. We\u2019re immortals. We\u2019ve roamed this earth since the dawn of time, but we stay under the human radar for survival purposes.\u201d</p><p>Shape-shifters. Immortals. The words banged around inside her head, finding no purchase. They weren\u2019t real. Men did not turn into tigers. They didn\u2019t live forever. They didn\u2019t.</p><p>No wonder he hadn\u2019t died when he\u2019d been shot.</p><p>With sudden clarity she realized everything she\u2019d believed about him was wrong. Everything he\u2019d told her was a lie. She felt a pinch in that part of her heart that had softened toward him. A spreading ache.</p><p>Am I really believing any of this?</p><p>God, I need to get out of here.</p><p>Delaney dug her fingers in her hair, raking it back from her face as her heart raced and her mind spun.</p><p>\u201cDo you eat people?\u201d</p><p>His mouth tightened. \u201cNo. We don\u2019t kill unless someone needs to be killed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour brother does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not my brother. He\u2019s a clone, an unnatural creation that\u2019s not even flesh and blood. He was made several weeks ago from half my soul, which is what\u2019s causing my anger-management issues. My soul\u2019s disintegrating. If I don\u2019t destroy him soon, I\u2019m going to die.\u201d</p><p>She gripped her head in both hands, closing her eyes against the barrage of information her mind refused to process. Six hundred years?</p><p>How did he expect her to believe that? Yet how else could she possibly explain what she\u2019d seen?</p><p>With perfect clarity, she understood why he was so determined to catch the scumbag. The clone. After more than six hundred years, his life was in serious jeopardy.</p><p>If she believed him.</p><p>Did she have a choice?</p><p>A thought occurred to her, a wicked irony. The serial killer she\u2019d been pursuing, the one the press had semihumorously dubbed the D.C. Vampire, actually wasn\u2019t human.</p><p>What if the FBI found out about it? That nonhumans actually existed? It would flip them on their ears.</p><p>And if the populace at large learned about them? Utter chaos.</p><p>Taking a deep, shuddering breath, she lowered her arms, opened her eyes, and met Tighe\u2019s gaze. She\u2019d never been one to bury her head in the sand. Clearly, she\u2019d stumbled into something way outside her realm of experience. Her only real option was to figure out what was going on as best she could.</p><p>Then deal with it.</p><p>Another shudder tore through her. Easier said than done.</p><p>Delaney swallowed. \u201cI kind of understand the physical shifting into a tiger. But how...how did you do it in my head? Is that going to happen again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe tiger in your head wasn\u2019t precisely me.\u201d</p><p>She grimaced. \u201cSomeone else did that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He dug a hand through his short, sun-bleached hair, mirroring her move of a few moments ago. \u201cI share my body with an animal spirit. A tiger animal spirit. His being in me enables me to shift into the tiger, but he isn\u2019t the tiger. I am. I\u2019m the tiger, I\u2019m the man, and when I lose my temper, I\u2019m even that thing that attacked you. Though, if my soul had been intact, I never would have lost control like that. I never would have hurt you.\u201d</p><p>His fingers ran across the scars on his chest. Scars that looked like an animal\u2019s claw marks, she realized. \u201cI was twenty-four when the tiger chose me. Marked me. Before that I wasn\u2019t human, but neither was I a shape-shifter. He joined his spirit with mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe controls you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, though on occasion he\u2019ll make his will known. Particularly when it comes to females.\u201d Tighe frowned. \u201cHe\u2019s taken a liking to you. When I entered your mind, he tried to follow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was he going to do in there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. He couldn\u2019t have done anything. If you want to know the truth, I think he was really just trying to say hello.\u201d</p><p>She laughed, though there was no humor in it. \u201cHello? He scared the shit out of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBelieve me, I\u2019m aware of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow am I not hooked up to a transfusion in the ICU? I know I lost a ton of blood.\u201d She glanced down at one shoulder, then met his gaze. \u201cI can\u2019t even feel the wounds.\u201d</p><p>Delaney hooked her finger into the neck of the large tee shirt and pulled it open so she could get a peek. They were still there, all right, red and swollen dashes, dried blood caked around the edges. But the skin seemed to have already knit closed. Almost as if someone had cauterized the wounds.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d seen too much to take you to a human hospital, so one of our healers helped you. There was only so much she could do with human flesh. You\u2019re not fully healed, but you\u2019re a lot further along than you would be on your own. Your own body will have to do the rest.\u201d</p><p>Delaney shook her head. She was trying to take it all in. Really trying, but...\u201cThis is unbelievable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet used to it,\u201d he said coolly. \u201cThe mating ceremony will take place as soon as you\u2019re ready.\u201d</p><p>Mating ceremony. Her stomach clenched, his words coming back to her, hard and hurtful. No way. I\u2019m not making her my mate.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d It was too much. She couldn\u2019t deal with this, too. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He studied her, his gaze enigmatic. \u201cEither you bind yourself to me, or I kill you.\u201d His expression said he didn\u2019t much care which.</p><p>She looked away, blindsided by the swift, unexpected pain of that blow. A blow he probably hadn\u2019t even intended.</p><p>She meant nothing to him. Less than nothing. And she hated that it hurt.</p> <p>Delaney swung her legs over the side of the bed. \u201cI need my cell phone,\u201d she said tersely. \u201cI have to call my boss and let him know I\u2019m okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs the FBI looking for me? Did they see you kidnap me? Did they give chase?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><p>She gaped at him, lunging to her feet to face him. \u201cOf course it matters.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019ll never find you. You\u2019re dead to them now.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him, her jaw slowly dropping. \u201cI have a job to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour only job now is whatever I say it is. You\u2019re not going back to the FBI.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re trying to be an ass, you\u2019re succeeding brilliantly.\u201d She stalked toward him. \u201cI heard you tell the guy on the phone that if I went through with this, I couldn\u2019t betray you. So I can go back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re staying here.\u201d</p><p>Blast it. \u201cThen I\u2019m not doing this.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have a choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know you were going to lock me up!\u201d</p><p>He turned and picked up a royal blue silk nightgown and tossed it to her. \u201cPut this on. Nothing underneath. Leave your hair down and your feet bare. It\u2019s your wedding dress.\u201d</p><p>She stared at the thing. \u201cI\u2019m not getting married in a nightgown.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a nightgown. It\u2019s a ritual gown.\u201d</p><p>The fabric was gorgeous, but there was nothing to it. No sleeves, no lining. Nothing underneath?</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the ritual? Sacrificing me to your tiger god?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t reply, just continued to watch her with that hard, cold expression.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not getting married without underwear. Or without my gun. Not with wild animals on the loose.\u201d</p><p>He took a step toward her, his mouth compressing dangerously. \u201cYou\u2019ll do whatever I tell you to do.\u201d</p><p>She threw the gown on the floor. \u201cGo to hell.\u201d</p><p>He lunged for her, grabbed her arm, and hauled her roughly against him. \u201cI don\u2019t like this any better than you do, but it\u2019s either bind yourself to me or die. I gave you the choice already. You chose this. You chose me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was delirious.\u201d</p><p>His jaw went hard as he released her with one hand and flicked open a switchblade three inches from her face.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not too late to change your mind.\u201d The tightness of his mouth spoke of barely leashed violence, but in the agitated flutter of those angel wings in her head she sensed an unhappiness as raw as her own. He was being forced to tie himself to a woman he didn\u2019t love.</p><p>No, not forced.</p><p>He could have let her die.</p><p>Her fury ebbed as her heart began to ache for him almost as much as herself. \u201cWould you really kill me?\u201d she asked quietly. She already knew the answer.</p><p>The anger drained out of him as he retracted the blade and shoved it back in his pocket.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He released her along with a sigh that echoed with pain. \u201cBut if you won\u2019t go through with this, I\u2019ll have no choice but to step aside while someone else does. The survival of our race is too important.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cNot just to us. If we die, there will be no one left to keep the Daemons from returning. Imagine thousands of creatures terrorizing the human population. Creatures worse than my twin. A dozen times worse.\u201d</p><p>She shuddered and stared at him, her mind struggling to accept round after round of evidence that the world was so much more complex than she\u2019d thought. \u201cSo I really don\u2019t have a choice?\u201d</p><p>His mouth turned rueful. \u201cYou really don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you do. A human death can\u2019t mean that much to you. Why bind yourself to me when you could have let me die? When you don\u2019t want me?\u201d</p><p>His mouth turned up in a wry half smile. \u201cWho says I don\u2019t want you?\u201d</p><p>As she stared at him, he bent down and picked up the gown, then met her gaze again, his expression softening just a little. \u201cCome on, D. Let\u2019s get this over with.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t quite the marriage proposal she\u2019d dreamed of, but there had been something in his expression, something in his words that eased the ache inside her. Not much, but maybe it was enough. Especially since she clearly didn\u2019t have a choice.</p><p>\u201cI need to get cleaned up.\u201d</p><p>He handed her the gown and nodded toward a door in the corner. \u201cBathroom\u2019s in there. I\u2019ll see if I can find you a brush or something.\u201d</p><p>She nodded and took the gown from him. As he started to turn away, she stopped him. \u201cTighe?\u201d</p><p>He turned back to her.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said softly. \u201cFor not letting me die.\u201d</p><p>His gaze seemed to search hers for several moments, then he lifted his hand and traced her cheekbone with his thumb in a feather-light touch. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d Then he turned away.</p><p>Delaney opened the shower curtain to find a host of items on the sink that hadn\u2019t been there when she climbed in. A toothbrush still in its wrapper, a comb and brush, a hair dryer. Beside them lay a small zipper pouch she discovered contained a small collection of makeup basics. Someone else\u2019s collection, by the looks of it.</p><p>Staring at them, she was reminded how little she knew the man she was supposedly marrying. Did he have a girlfriend? A dozen girlfriends? With looks like his, she\u2019d be amazed if he didn\u2019t.</p><p>Was he in love with someone else? Was she doomed to have to watch him parading other women through her life?</p><p>The ache in her chest tightened, annoying her. The only way she was going to survive this was to stop caring. Hadn\u2019t she learned that lesson when she was eleven? The only way to survive, period, was to stop caring about anyone.</p><p>Which had always been easier said than done.</p><p>After she dried her hair, she put on a little makeup, then slipped the blue silk over her head. The sleeveless, scoop-necked gown slid sensuously down her body to midcalf, skimming her curves but not hugging them tightly. The color was gorgeous on her. A perfect nightgown. But she was far too busty ever to consider leaving the bedroom without a bra, especially in a gown like this. It would only highlight every bounce and jiggle.</p><p>Just the dress a man would pick.</p><p>With a sigh, she opened the door and stepped into the bedroom.</p><p>Tighe turned from the window to face her. \u201cThe dress looks good on you.\u201d His tone was still reserved, but there was a truth in his words that warmed her. Heated her.</p><p>\u201cThanks. It\u2019s a beautiful nightgown. Just how many people are going to see me in it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFive, other than me. And it\u2019s not a nightgown. It\u2019s one of a collection of ceremonial gowns that have been passed down for thousands of years.\u201d</p><p>Delaney jerked. \u201cThis dress is not thousands of years old. It would have disintegrated eons ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe fabric was woven with power and magic, as well as silk. That\u2019s why nothing else can touch your skin during the ritual.\u201d</p><p>Power and magic. She shivered. \u201cNot even my gun?\u201d</p><p>The corner of his mouth twitched. \u201cEspecially not your gun.\u201d</p><p>She glanced at his slacks. \u201cAre those thousand-year-old Haggars?\u201d</p><p>A grin lit his face for one brilliant moment, flashing his dimples and filling her chest with a terrible and wonderful pressure.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re not Haggars. And what I\u2019m wearing doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is the channel for my power.\u201d He tapped the golden armband with the tiger\u2019s head.</p><p>Oh.</p><p>Tighe held out his hand to her. \u201cCome on, D. Let\u2019s get this ritual over with.\u201d</p><p>She took his hand, and he pulled her lightly into his arms and kissed her hair. \u201cTrust me, brown eyes. It\u2019s all going to be okay.\u201d</p><p>To her dismay, tears threatened in her eyes, and she buried her face in the hollow of his throat, craving his touch, needing his strength.</p><p>His arms closed around her, and she clung to him, the pressure in her chest growing, expanding, cutting off her air even as it filled her with a terrible, anguished joy.</p><p>He said it was all going to be okay. But she wasn\u2019t sure of that. She wasn\u2019t sure at all.</p><p>Because, heaven help her, she was falling in love with him.</p><p>Chapter Twenty</p><p>Tighe led Delaney through what she could only describe as a gaudily decorated mansion and down a long, long stair into a basement that had to be a good twelve feet below the ground. No regular lightbulbs lit their way, only a couple of pairs of electric sconces made to look like candlelight.</p><p>With each step down, Delaney\u2019s uneasiness mounted, her hands fisting and clenching around air. If she\u2019d ever needed to be armed, it was now.</p><p>The scent of fire teased her nostrils as curls of smoke lifted on the air. A bead of sweat rolled between her breasts. When she thought of weddings, her mind burst forth with pictures of sunshine and flowers, and yards and yards of white. Not dark stairs and smoke.</p><p>Wedding, my ass. Some kind of gang ritual, more like it. Or human sacrifice.</p><p>A shiver of fear snaked its way down her spine.</p><p>Of course, Tighe hadn\u2019t called it a wedding, had he? He\u2019d called it a mating ceremony.</p><p>Mating ceremony? Like some ancient fertility rite? That included sex? He\u2019d better not even think about it.</p><p>What did she really know about this man? Nothing. She knew nothing about him except that he seemed to be trying to keep her alive. Which was all well and fine as long as his friends agreed. But she\u2019d heard them on the phone when she was trying to bleed out. They\u2019d all been in favor of letting her die.</p><p>What if they overpowered him? Or what if he lost it and turned into Wolfman Tiger again? She couldn\u2019t protect them both. She was weaponless. Shoeless. Pantyless.</p><p>Tighe reached back and took her hand, his warm fingers closing around her ice-cold ones. \u201cControl your fear, Agent Randall. No one\u2019s going to hurt you unless I lose it again. And it\u2019s your fear that makes me lose control.\u201d</p><p>His use of her title had the desired effect, calling on years of training and control. Even as it reminded her that her career, everything she\u2019d worked so hard for, might well be gone.</p><p>She knew Phil must be frantically searching for her whether or not they\u2019d seen her captured. An FBI agent on the trail of a serial killer suddenly disappears. What was the Bureau going to think? That she\u2019d gotten too close to him again. Phil wouldn\u2019t be looking for her, she realized. He\u2019d be looking for her remains. And when he didn\u2019t find them? It wouldn\u2019t much matter. He\u2019d still think she was dead.</p><p>And in a way, maybe she was. Dead to her old life at least.</p><p>Goose bumps rose on her skin as she followed Tighe down the long stairs. She wasn\u2019t entirely convinced she wasn\u2019t about to die in truth.</p><p>When they reached the base of the stairs, Tighe led her through a dark, dimly lit hallway toward a wide archway flickering with firelight and curls of smoke. Low voices met her ears, too low to make out the words.</p><p>As Tighe led her through the doorway and into the room, Delaney stared around her warily, in no small amount of awe.</p><p>The room wasn\u2019t overly large, but the ceiling was higher than most and arched, giving the space the feel of a cave. A feeling heightened by the six small fires burning around the edges of the room, casting flickering shadows on the dark-paneled ceiling and walls. There was something intensely primitive about the atmosphere, a feeling only strengthened by the half-naked men.</p><p>Five men other than Tighe stood scattered around the room, each wearing nothing more than a pair of pants or jeans and an armband similar to Tighe\u2019s, though each armband seemed to have the head of a different animal on it. Maybe they weren\u2019t all tigers after all.</p><p>Never had she seen such a worrisome display of pure, undiluted male power. Not a one of them was under six-six, with a couple well over. Each possessed powerful shoulders and thick, dangerous muscles.</p><p>If they turned against her, she was dog meat.</p><p>A shudder tore through her as she remembered where she was. What these men were. And just how true that could turn out to be. Dog meat. Tiger meat.</p><p>Forget sacrifice. For all she knew, she was dinner.</p><p>Tighe squeezed her hand. \u201cYou\u2019re safe, brown eyes. Happy thoughts, hmm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHappy thoughts?\u201d she muttered. Right. Her thoughts were on the fact there were no windows. No possible chance of escape.</p><p>One of the men came toward them, a man with a mustache and goatee and cold, pale eyes. The eyes of a psychopath.</p><p>\u201cLyon says you don\u2019t want the altar?\u201d</p><p>And the voice of the man who kept telling Tighe to kill her. Great.</p><p>Tighe shook his head. \u201cI won\u2019t need it.\u201d</p><p>The psychopath\u2019s expression didn\u2019t change. He turned that pale gaze to her, flicking it over her dispassionately as if deciding between a thigh and a breast.</p><p>She squeezed Tighe\u2019s hand, desperate to control the shudder that threatened to tear her apart.</p><p>The psychopath turned away.</p><p>\u201cHappy thoughts, D,\u201d Tighe murmured.</p><p>\u201cI was just thinking about dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can imagine what you were thinking, but you have nothing to fear. No one\u2019s going to touch you but me.\u201d</p><p>The men were all looking at her, most with a disinterest bordering on disdain. As if she wasn\u2019t worth their time. Is that what they think of all humans?</p><p>The last man her gaze landed on nodded to her with something almost approaching friendliness. A man with a long, aristocratic face and sharply arched brows. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her eyes narrowed, and she nudged Tighe. \u201cHave I met him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHawke? He was the one who grabbed you at the Tidal Basin.\u201d</p><p>And the same one who\u2019d pulled her to safety both times Tighe went ballistic. Would he rescue her a third time if she needed it? Not likely. Not against this crew.</p> <p>As her gaze peppered the room, she caught sight of a woman standing on the far side, against one wall, in a gown that appeared to be a pastel version of her own ceremonial nightgown. Is the woman just another course on the menu, or does she belong here?</p><p>As their gazes caught, the blonde gave her a small, sympathetic smile. Nice. A moment of rapport between one entr\u00e9e and the other.</p><p>Tighe nudged her shoulder. \u201cIf those thoughts of yours are happy, I\u2019d hate to taste your dark ones.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze jerked to his. \u201cYou really can taste my emotions?\u201d</p><p>His mouth pursed, and he nodded. \u201cReally can.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo I taste scared?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot exactly. If I had to guess, I\u2019d say you\u2019re thinking about what you\u2019d do if you could get ahold of those knives in my room. Am I close?\u201d</p><p>She lifted her brows on a rueful look. \u201cNo, but I like your idea better.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cAlways glad to help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get started, Kougar.\u201d The man who spoke was one of the larger of the bunch, his hair down to his shoulders in thick dark blond waves. Everything from the tone of his voice to his body language proclaimed him the leader. Was this Lyon, then? The one on the phone who\u2019d been so against saving her?</p> <p>Tighe led her to a low pedestal in the middle of the floor. \u201cStand here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlone?\u201d She stepped onto the round platform that was about the size of a coffee table and turned to him, noting they now stood eye to eye. \u201cIsn\u2019t it traditional for the bride and groom to stand together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll join you in a moment. Our rituals involve magic, of which I have to be a part.\u201d</p><p>As she stood self-consciously, the men formed a loose, wide circle around her. She kept turning, hating the feel of any of these men at her back.</p><p>The psychopath\u2014was this Kougar?\u2014walked toward Tighe with a bowl that looked like...Shit. It was either the top of a human skull or a first-rate replica. She\u2019d bet money it was no fake.</p><p>Tighe held out his hand for the bowl, then stood there as the freak with the pale eyes pulled out a knife and cut him! Deep. Right through the center of his palm.</p><p>Delaney gasped in outrage and leaped off the pedestal.</p><p>Tighe shook his head sharply, frowning at her. \u201cGo back, D. This is supposed to happen.\u201d</p> <p>She glared at Kougar, then slowly turned and climbed back onto the platform. What would she have done if Tighe hadn\u2019t stopped her? Would she really have gone after a hulk of a man with a six-inch blade in his hand?</p><p>Yeah. She would have. If she\u2019d thought Tighe was being attacked, she would have. She nearly had.</p><p>As if she were trying to protect her mate.</p><p>Shit.</p><p>Her hands clenched and unclenched at her sides as she watched Tighe squeeze his injured hand into a fist, letting the blood run into the bowl. When Tighe lowered his hand, Kougar turned to the man beside Tighe, her aristocratic savior, and cut his palm just as he had Tighe\u2019s.</p><p>One by one, the men added their blood to the bowl in a ritual as barbaric as anything she\u2019d ever seen. With the firelight flickering over the dark walls, the half-naked bodies and dripping blood, she could almost believe every step down to this place had taken her another thousand years into the past.</p><p>Chills rippled over her skin.</p><p>At last, Kougar handed the bowl to Lyon, cut his own palm, and added his blood to the mix. When he was done, he retrieved the bowl.</p><p>Tighe walked toward her, then stepped onto the pedestal in front of her. His expression was tight. Borderline angry.</p><p>Had she offended him by trying to come to his rescue? Undoubtedly. And in front of all his buddies. Big mistake.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d she said softly. \u201cGut reaction.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t say anything, just held his hands out to her. She started to lay her hands in his when she remembered he\u2019d been cut. But as she looked at his palm, her eyes went wide. His flesh was blood-smeared, but whole.</p><p>Her gaze snapped to his.</p><p>\u201cFast healers,\u201d he murmured. \u201cTake my hands, D.\u201d</p><p>Fast healers. Immortals. No wonder no one seemed the least bit bothered about all the blood.</p><p>A shiver ripped through her, but she placed her hands in his.</p><p>Kougar began to chant something in a language she couldn\u2019t even identify. As he chanted, he walked slowly around the circle, dribbling the collected blood onto the floor.</p><p>Three times, he circled them before throwing the remaining blood into one of the fires. The flame rose, spitting, then died back to the size of the others.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s time,\u201d Kougar said, his voice almost hushed.</p><p>Tighe released her hands. The chanting had done something, something she couldn\u2019t see but could feel. Like a tingling in her blood and a heaviness in the air.</p><p>Tighe lifted his hands to frame her face. \u201cListen to me, brown eyes, because this is important. I need you to look into my eyes and not look away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would help if I could see your eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It wouldn\u2019t. It may feel like I\u2019m trying to get into your mind again, but don\u2019t let me in this time, do you understand? You have to fight it.\u201d</p><p>His words were doing nothing to calm her. Fight it, why? Because if she didn\u2019t, the tiger would spring again? She was actually kind of curious about his tiger spirit; but his intensity told her this was nothing to mess with, whatever it was.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cLook into my eyes, D.\u201d</p><p>As she stared into his sunglasses, the chanting started up around them, all the men joining in, a deep, low rumble entering her bloodstream like the pounding of ancient drums.</p><p>Tighe\u2019s warmth brushed across her mind as it had that night in her apartment when she\u2019d first met him. Like that night, she felt the stroke deep and low inside her. Oh, hell.</p><p>Again, that warmth stroked her, making her catch her breath as the heat built between her legs. Over and over, that invisible touch brushed her, driving her until she was hot, and gasping.</p><p>\u201cTighe.\u201d If he didn\u2019t stop, she was going to come. Right here. In front of everyone. \u201cTighe, stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t move.\u201d</p><p>Oh, God, it was too late. Her body was out of control, the rocket launched. She was gasping, rocking against him, moaning.</p><p>Oh, shit.</p><p>Tighe held Delaney as she screamed her release, her face a mask of passion. She was beautiful. Glorious.</p><p>His.</p><p>But he wasn\u2019t hers.</p><p>He shook from the hard thread of control that kept him from freeing himself and burying himself deep inside her, joining her, binding himself to her as the magic bound her to him.</p><p>A thing he couldn\u2019t do. Couldn\u2019t do.</p><p>As her climax peaked, the power rushed out of him like a storm, and into her, making her cry out a second time with as much pleasure as the first.</p><p>She was his, now. Bound to him. Her loyalty and fidelity unbreakable.</p><p>His.</p><p>But the rush of pleasure, of power, went only one way, leaving a deep, hollow void inside him. An emptiness he hadn\u2019t anticipated.</p><p>He\u2019d done the right thing. The only thing.</p><p>She clung to him with shaking hands as her body quaked from the force of the twin storms. Dark lashes swept up, revealing eyes shimmering with disbelief and bright with dismay. Slowly, she straightened, her cheeks staining with color even as her gaze hardened, raking the Ferals as if daring them to comment.</p><p>Her gaze swung back to him, the pleasure gone from her eyes. The bitter taste of her embarrassment streaked across his tongue along with a healthy dose of anger.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s done,\u201d he told her quietly.</p><p>Her eyes narrowed. \u201cYou did that on purpose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSexual release opens the body and mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about you?\u201d Her gaze dipped to the front of his pants. \u201cYou didn\u2019t get off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Her expression turned brittle. \u201cYou didn\u2019t marry me, did you? I married you, but you didn\u2019t marry me.\u201d</p><p>She was too sharp, by half.</p><p>\u201cI did what I had to do to keep you alive.\u201d</p><p>And to keep them from being stuck with one another for the rest of her life.</p><p>Deep inside him, the tiger howled with fury.</p><p>Damn him.</p><p>As Tighe stepped down from the pedestal, Delaney remembered the words someone had spoken as she\u2019d lain on a sofa soaking in her own blood.</p><p>If he binds her to him, she can\u2019t betray him. Or us.</p><p>Binds her. Not marries her. Not promises to love, honor, and cherish her. But binds her. Like a slave. Was that it? Was that what she would be to him? A slave?</p><p>Or worse. What if she was nothing to him? A castoff. A useless, cast-off human.</p><p>Tighe held out his hand to her, to help her down, but she just stared at him, knowing she wasn\u2019t masking her anger nearly as well as she wanted to.</p><p>\u201cD.\u201d The word pulsed with regret. With pity.</p><p>She turned away from him, hating that he knew she was so much more than mad. This sucked. It sucked. All she\u2019d ever wanted was to do her job, and now she couldn\u2019t even do that. She was locked in a marriage that wasn\u2019t even a marriage.</p><p>A binding.</p><p>His hand cupped her shoulder. \u201cDelaney.\u201d</p><p>Pain shot through her head, out of nowhere, arching her back as her jaw dropped open. Her sight disappeared as a screen rose in her head. A house. On fire.</p><p>She felt Tighe snatch back his hand with a groan. \u201cI forgot about your injuries.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot...Tighe.\u201d Her hand shot out, reaching for him blindly. \u201cVision.\u201d</p><p>And then she was in his arms, cradled against his bare chest, his palm tight to her forehead. \u201cEasy, sweetheart. Are you seeing it this time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. I think. Better than the slide to nowhere, anyway.\u201d</p><p>The view was of the back of an old two-story house. Fire licked at the base from one end of the house to the other as if...</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s poured gasoline around it again,\u201d Tighe said.</p><p>\u201cAny identifiers?\u201d one of the men asked. Hawke\u2019s voice, she was almost certain.</p><p>\u201cNothing so far. You don\u2019t recognize anything do you, D?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. What do you mean...again?\u201d</p><p>An old woman appeared in one of the upstairs windows, struggling to lift the window sash.</p><p>\u201cThis is the fourth time he\u2019s done this in the past twelve hours. We found two of the houses, but too late. He was long gone. But we know he\u2019s using flammables to trap his victims.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t have the visions.\u201d</p><p>His arm tightened around her, pulling her even closer against his chest as if he\u2019d shield her from this horror. \u201cOh you had them, you were just unconscious at the time. I was holding you. I saw them for you.\u201d</p><p>The old woman was making no progress with the window. It appeared to be stuck. She disappeared only to appear at a different window. Delaney could feel her terror in the frantic way she beat at the window frame, and in the screams barely filtering through the window.</p><p>While the clone watched, feeding on her fear.</p><p>The men\u2019s conversation went on around her.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not feeding as well this way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe he\u2019s needing to feed more often to counteract the disintegration of his soul.\u201d</p><p>The fire was beginning to creep up the wood siding of the house. Delaney\u2019s arms slid around Tighe\u2019s waist as she buried her face in his chest. \u201cI don\u2019t want to see this.\u201d</p><p>Tighe\u2019s hand caressed her head. \u201cI can knock you out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>The woman finally threw a chair through the window, the glass shards sparkling like gold in the fire\u2019s glow. Her screams for help tore through Delaney\u2019s mind. She felt the strong arms around her tighten as if he, too, could barely stand to hear this.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got it!\u201d Another male voice. \u201cNot that far from here. A Falls Church address.\u201d</p><p>Tighe brushed her hair with his hand. \u201cI\u2019ve got to go, brown eyes. I\u2019ve got to try to stop him.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cHelp her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I can.\u201d But they both knew by the time he got there, if no one else had come to her aid, it would be too late. \u201cLet me knock you out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I can\u2019t leave her. Besides, maybe I\u2019ll see something.\u201d</p><p>She felt the press of his lips on her hair. \u201cLyon can knock you out as easily as I can. If you need help, ask him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll stay with her,\u201d said a woman\u2019s voice. The blonde, no doubt.</p><p>He helped her sit on the pedestal before he released her. The rush of pain had her cradling her head in her arms. Through the old woman\u2019s hoarse screams, she heard the sound of male feet pounding up the stairs. Then the soft brush of silk.</p><p>To her surprise, a gentle hand began to rub her back. A woman\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure this isn\u2019t helping at all, but it\u2019s what my mom always did when I needed any kind of comforting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt helps.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. I\u2019m Kara, by the way. Lyon\u2019s mate, as they put it. His wife.\u201d</p><p>The soft voice helped drown out the sound of the woman\u2019s coughing cries, as they helped ground Delaney in the real world.</p><p>\u201cAs they put it?\u201d she asked, struggling to force her mind anywhere but that fire. \u201cAren\u2019t you one of them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTechnically. I thought I was human until about two weeks ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh, yeah. Let me tell you, that was a shocker. I taught preschool in Spearsville, Missouri. I guess I should have known something was up when my cuts always healed within seconds, and I never got sick. But I was so average in every other way, I never suspected I was different. Who would? There\u2019s no such thing as immortals, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a shape-shifter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Kara\u2019s hand rubbed soft, comforting circles over her back. \u201cI\u2019m just their power plug. Their Radiant. It\u2019s complicated. A lot more than you\u2019re up for right now.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAre there many of them? The tigers, or whatever they are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly one tiger. One of each animal, nine in all. A lot more Therians, but only nine shifters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHawke, Lyon, Kougar...?\u201d It finally dawned on her. \u201cTheir names...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre the names of their animals, yes. Or close. Tighe is obviously the tiger.\u201d She continued to rub Delaney\u2019s back. \u201cIs the woman still struggling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe has the window open, but the fire\u2019s on the outside, so all the smoke\u2019s going in.\u201d Behind the woman, she saw a flicker of light. Had help finally arrived? The flicker rose higher. Flame.</p> <p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t she...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe fire\u2019s inside the house, too. She\u2019s trapped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no. Poor thing.\u201d</p><p>As Delaney watched, the woman collapsed, falling out of her sight.</p><p>The vision ended.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s over,\u201d Delaney said softly, staying where she was until the pain began to ebb away.</p> <p>\u201cThey didn\u2019t get there in time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. No one did.\u201d</p><p>A very human growl sounded from the woman beside her. \u201cI can\u2019t believe we let him get away. We killed the others. You knew there were others, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEight in all. A clone of each of the Ferals except Vhyper. We had one heck of a battle here a week ago. We got them all but Tighe\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>Delaney slowly rose to a sitting position, lifting her head carefully. \u201cThank God there aren\u2019t eight of those things running around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose. Look on the bright side, right? Things could always be worse.\u201d</p><p>Delaney snorted softly, thinking of all the people this thing had killed so far. \u201cI\u2019m beginning to wonder.\u201d Delaney turned to face her companion, a pretty blonde, in a wholesome girl-next-door kind of way. \u201cSorry. This hasn\u2019t been the greatest day for me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou and Tighe. Lyon said he bound you to him because it was the only way you were going to survive.\u201d</p><p>Delaney nodded. \u201cThat pretty much sums it up. I\u2019m alive. Beyond that, I don\u2019t know what I am. Apparently not married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I noticed that was only one way. Horrifyingly embarrassing, isn\u2019t it? I had to have sex in front of all of them when I married Lyon a few nights ago.\u201d</p><p>Delaney stared at her. \u201cIn front of them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI made Lyon erect curtains around the altar. But they heard everything. Of course, Lyon and I had already done it in front of three of them, but that was in the heat of battle and didn\u2019t quite feel as strange.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cShape-shifters.\u201d Kara\u2019s expression softened. \u201cHow\u2019s your head?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou look...a little dazed.\u201d</p><p>Delaney sighed. \u201cI guess I am. This is all happening a little too fast for me. I thought we were getting married. I understood that concept. Now I don\u2019t know what Tighe has in mind for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf it helps, I don\u2019t think he does either. But I saw him when he brought you in, Delaney. You were white as a sheet from the blood loss. But he was just as pale. He cares more than you think.\u201d Kara patted her knee, then stood. \u201cI suspect he cares more than he knows.\u201d</p><p>Delaney rose and followed her out of the room and up the long stairs. Could Kara be right? Did he care about her? And would it change anything if he did?</p><p>She sighed, deeply troubled and more than a little apprehensive. Because she didn\u2019t know what he wanted from her. Or what he meant to do with her. For heaven\u2019s sakes, she barely even knew the man, no matter what her heart thought.</p><p>The only thing she did know, the one immutable fact, was that she did not belong in this world. In his world.</p><p>And she never would.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-one</p><p>Tighe opened his bedroom door quietly, not wanting to wake Delaney. But she sat up as he entered, a shadowed form rising in his bed.</p><p>He liked her waiting for him like that. Sweet nature, but he needed to touch her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m guessing you didn\u2019t catch him.\u201d</p><p>He sat on the edge of the bed and pulled off his boots. \u201cNo. He was long gone by the time we got there. The woman didn\u2019t make it. I\u2019m sorry, D.\u201d</p><p>She pulled her knees up, wrapping her arms around them. She was dressed in soft blue pajamas\u2014a loan, he assumed, from Kara. Her emotions tasted conflicted and were hard to identify. But he tasted no ripe anger, and for that he was grateful. His soul would splinter if he didn\u2019t touch her.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know where to sleep,\u201d she said softly. \u201cKara thought I should stay here. She figured you\u2019d move me if you didn\u2019t want me here.\u201d</p><p>Tighe stretched out on the bed and pulled her into his arms. \u201cI want you here.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t melt against him, but neither did she pull away, and it was enough. He drank in her scent, shuddering at the rightness of her being with him. All day, the chaos had been getting worse within him, building in strength and noise, like an approaching storm. But as he held Delaney, the storm abated. Not entirely, but enough that he felt like maybe, just maybe, he had enough time left to catch that damned clone before his soul was gone.</p><p>His fingers weaved through her hair as he pressed her head against his chest, tasting a drop of her unhappiness on his tongue.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, D. I should have warned you about the ceremony. About what to expect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you?\u201d The question was simple. Without rancor. And he didn\u2019t have an answer.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure. All I can tell you is I did it for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot marrying me? You did that for me?\u201d</p><p>He stroked her head, his gut churning. \u201cTherian marriages aren\u2019t like human. A Therian is...\u201d He sighed. \u201cI guess I should start at the beginning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo need. Kara filled me in pretty thoroughly about the Therians, Daemons, Satanan\u2014you name it. I\u2019m not saying I\u2019m ready for a quiz, but I think I\u2019ve got the basics.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d His hand stroked down her back and up again. \u201cAnyway, the binding in an immortal marriage is real, not just talk as it is in a human marriage. There\u2019s no divorce. Once the pair are bound to one another, they\u2019re bound for life. That\u2019s why very few Therians ever mate.\u201d</p><p>Delaney pulled out of his embrace but didn\u2019t move away. Instead, she rolled onto her stomach and propped herself up to look at him.</p><p>\u201cSo what are you saying?\u201d she asked, her voice calm, but strained.</p><p>He lifted his hand, as he looked up at her, and ran his knuckles lightly along her cheek. \u201cBy only binding one of us, the mating isn\u2019t permanent. If I\u2019d bound myself to you, too, it would have been. The way it stands now, it can be broken. Once this is over, if I can take your memories, I can send you home. You\u2019ll get your life back, Agent Randall.\u201d</p><p>No joy leaped into her eyes. No relief. For a dozen seconds, she was silent. \u201cSo the bond was real, but not permanent. What\u2019s going to happen to me if I try to leave you?\u201d</p><p>Tighe sighed. \u201cGood question. I\u2019m hoping I can break the bond when I steal your memories. Since you\u2019re human, I may be able to do it. Worst case, you\u2019ll probably feel this tug, this longing, for something you don\u2019t understand. It\u2019s not perfect, but few lives ever are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really think I can go home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t promise. I\u2019m not the only one of the Ferals with the ability to steal the memories of humans, but my gift is the strongest. If my soul goes before the clone dies, one of the others will try to free you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if it doesn\u2019t work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t leave our world with the knowledge you currently have of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have to stay here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEither here or in one of the Therian enclaves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill your friends let me live?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely. I\u2019ve talked to Hawke about it. He\u2019ll make sure you\u2019re taken care of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA prisoner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have a life, D.\u201d He cupped her jaw and ran his thumb across her soft cheek. \u201cI\u2019m not planning on dying. I haven\u2019t figured out how, but I\u2019m going to get that son of a bitch.\u201d</p><p>Something flared in her eyes. \u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>Tighe slid his hand around the back of her neck and pulled her down until her mouth was firmly on his. The kiss filled him, strengthened him, and sent heat coursing through his veins. He pulled her on top of him until she covered him, then cupped her buttocks and pressed her against his growing arousal, pulling a moan of need from his throat.</p><p>Desire swam in his blood. \u201cI want you, brown eyes.\u201d</p><p>Delaney pulled from his embrace and sat up, straddling him as she pulled the soft tee shirt up and off her body, revealing perfect breasts in the moonlight filtering into the room.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so beautiful,\u201d he murmured, and reached up to cover the soft mounds with his hands.</p><p>She watched him with fathomless eyes. \u201cCome inside me, Tighe.\u201d</p><p>He needed no encouragement. In seconds, he finished undressing them both, rolled her beneath him, and sank deep into her heat. His soul gave a shuddering sigh. If he could stay there, right there, he would. Forever.</p><p>After he\u2019d driven them both to completion, he held her in his arms until she fell asleep. Would the desperate need to touch her, to hold her, leave him once his soul was complete again?</p><p>He had a bad feeling the answer was no. That the only way he\u2019d ever truly feel whole was with Delaney by his side.</p><p>Delaney woke up alone the next morning, climbed out of bed and took a quick shower, then dressed in the jeans and one of the sweaters Kara had loaned her until she could get some clothes of her own.</p><p>Her body was loose and warm. Sated. When Tighe had come in last night, she\u2019d tried to be cool. Tried to be mad at him for not marrying her and humiliating her in front of his friends like that. But she\u2019d found she didn\u2019t have the anger in her. She was all too aware she wasn\u2019t in her own world, and the rules of this one were very different. And she was very much an outsider.</p><p>Then he\u2019d pulled her into his arms, his body shaking, and held her like she was all that kept him together. She\u2019d melted, overwhelmed by the depth of her feeling for the man and her desperate need to keep him safe.</p><p>The last of her pique had disappeared beneath the weight of her caring and the certainty that he needed her right now. Time was running out. His soul was disintegrating.</p><p>And, heaven help her, she was absolutely in love with him.</p><p>She reached for her boots, which had miraculously survived her bloodbath. The same boots she\u2019d worn on the job nearly every day for six years. She stilled in the act of pulling on a sock and thought of Phil and her colleagues looking for her, thinking she was probably dead. She hated that they were expending needed time and resources looking for her, yet she was beginning to understand the Ferals\u2019 critical need for secrecy.</p><p>It didn\u2019t seem real that she\u2019d gotten mixed up in a battle of inhuman forces, races no one else knew existed. It didn\u2019t seem possible she\u2019d fallen in love with a man who wasn\u2019t human.</p><p>As she slipped on her sock, the door opened, and Tighe walked into the room. Her heart did a slow roll in her chest, setting off a fan of sparks.</p><p>He looked so damned good, dressed in jeans and a black silk shirt that hung loose around his trim waist. His short sun-bleached hair, curling slightly at the nape of his neck, was still damp from a shower he must have taken elsewhere. Sunglasses covered his eyes.</p><p>A slow smile spread across his face, flashing his dimples. \u201cYou found clothes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKara loaned them to me.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cLyon tells me you\u2019ve made a friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI imagine anyone who enters Kara\u2019s orbit is going to become her friend. She\u2019s a good person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree. Lyon\u2019s a lucky man.\u201d He closed the distance between them and took her face in his hands. \u201cI\u2019m luckier.\u201d</p><p>His head dipped, and he kissed her, his mouth warm and inviting, with that intoxicating taste of thunderstorms and wildness. A wildness she was beginning to understand.</p><p>When her breath was ragged, and her body hot and pliant, he pulled slowly away, his hands returning to frame her face. \u201cI\u2019d take you to bed, brown eyes, but I\u2019ve got a meeting in the war room in five minutes. And five minutes isn\u2019t nearly enough time to do what I want with you.\u201d</p><p>Damp heat flushed through her body. \u201cI\u2019m supposed to meet Kara in the foyer in a little while. She\u2019s going to show me around.\u201d</p><p>Tighe nodded, brushing his thumb across her cheek. \u201cI\u2019ve got a cell phone for you. It has GPS, but will only call two numbers. Hit any speed dial but two and you\u2019ll get me. Two will get you Lyon.\u201d</p><p>Two numbers. The word prisoner rang through her head all over again. The warmth from his touch slowly seeped out of her, and she pulled away. \u201cAfraid I\u2019ll call the FBI to swarm this place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You couldn\u2019t if you wanted to. You can\u2019t intentionally betray me now that you\u2019re bound to me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Yeah, she was annoyed. \u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s for your safety as well as ours. Just because you can\u2019t intentionally betray us doesn\u2019t mean you couldn\u2019t do it accidentally. I want you to have a way to reach me if you get another vision, and I\u2019m not right here with you.\u201d</p><p>Tighe handed her the phone. \u201cTake it, D. Please?\u201d</p> <p>Delaney did and slipped it into her pocket.</p><p>Tighe retraced his steps back to the door. \u201cI\u2019ll find you as soon as I\u2019m through with this meeting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what?\u201d</p><p>His expression turned grim. \u201cKougar\u2019s working on something. Let\u2019s hope he\u2019s having some success. I\u2019m running out of time.\u201d He left.</p><p>Delaney put on her boots, then did a quick search of the room to see if she could find her guns. Nothing. Her gaze scanned the knives on the walls. Heavy weaponry, to be sure, but not a thing suitable for day wear. She\u2019d have to have a talk with Tighe about that. They were going to have to come to some kind of agreement about weapons.</p> <p>Tighe had left the bedroom door partially open when he left. Since he hadn\u2019t locked her in, she assumed she was free to wander the house while she waited for Kara. And her curiosity about the place and these people was intense.</p><p>As she descended the wide, curved stair, the front door opened. Hawke and Kara walked in.</p><p>Hawke looked up and smiled as he met Delaney\u2019s gaze.</p><p>\u201cGood morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood morning.\u201d At least there seemed to be one friendly face among the Ferals.</p><p>As Hawke strode down the hallway, Delaney turned her attention to Kara. No smile lit the other woman\u2019s eyes this morning. Delaney\u2019s trouble radar went up.</p> <p>\u201cEverything okay?\u201d Delaney asked, descending the last of the stairs.</p><p>\u201cI need to talk. Come take a walk with me.\u201d</p><p>Delaney nodded and followed the blonde out the door and into an overcast morning. She felt a little funny leaving, though Tighe hadn\u2019t told her she couldn\u2019t.</p><p>What was to keep her from running? That mating bond, apparently.</p><p>But even if she could, where would she run to? With the understanding of what he was, and what the clone was, everything had changed. No longer was she simply fighting for her own survival. There was so much more at stake. Tighe\u2019s life, for one. And almost seven billion other lives, if what he\u2019d told her about the Daemons was true. Considering all she\u2019d seen, she had no reason to doubt him.</p><p>No, of course she wouldn\u2019t run. Not when the battle was here. And when she possessed one of their only real weapons, her visions.</p><p>It pleased her that Tighe understood her well enough, trusted her enough to know that.</p><p>As they traversed the rocky woods, Delaney glanced at her silent companion. \u201cWhat\u2019s up, Kara?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI need to show you something.\u201d She didn\u2019t elaborate.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d But they continued to walk until they\u2019d once more left the woods and were walking along a residential street. Delaney\u2019s instincts began to crawl with unease. \u201cKara, tell me what\u2019s going on.\u201d</p><p>To her surprise, Kara pulled a set of car keys out of her pocket and pressed the button. The red minivan parked on the side of the road in front of them beeped in response.</p><p>Delaney shook her head. \u201cKara, I\u2019m not going anywhere. Not without telling Tighe.\u201d</p><p>Kara held out her hand, a sly expression entering her eyes. \u201cGive me your phone. I\u2019ll call him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d The hair on her nape began to rise. This was not the woman she\u2019d talked to for two hours last night.</p><p>And suddenly, in the blink of an eye, she wasn\u2019t.</p><p>The person standing beside her was no longer Kara but Tighe. No, not Tighe. The clone.</p><p>Delaney\u2019s heart skipped a beat and began racing with terror. Her head went cold. She whirled to run, reaching for the phone in her pocket. But like Tighe, the clone was too fast. He grabbed her hair and jerked her off her feet in a blast of tearing pain. As he swung her around to face him, she slammed her elbow into his solar plexus.</p><p>He slammed his fist into her jaw.</p><p>\u201cI want that bastard found!\u201d Lyon\u2019s hard growl echoed through the war room, giving voice to Tighe\u2019s own frustration. He turned his hard gaze to Kougar. \u201cAnything on those Daemon traps?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m close. I\u2019ve got three that may potentially work if I can finish piecing them together, but they have to be done at night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTonight, then.\u201d When Kougar nodded, Lyon turned to Hawke. \u201cWhat have you found out, Wings?\u201d</p><p>Hawke folded his hands on the table in front of him. \u201cThe Shaman\u2019s been digging through old Daemon lore and believes the clone can indeed steal Tighe\u2019s half of the soul. He just isn\u2019t sure how he\u2019ll go about it. He\u2019s come up with a spell he can place on Tighe\u2019s soul so that if the clone tries to steal Tighe\u2019s half, both halves will be destroyed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck good is that?\u201d Jag drawled.</p><p>Hawke\u2019s expression was grim. \u201cIt won\u2019t keep Tighe alive, but it will at least contain the further threat of the clone.\u201d</p><p>Lyon shook his head. \u201cThe only solution I want is one that destroys that clone and leaves Tighe alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s still only one of those. Kill the clone. Straightforward and simple.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd damned impossible to do.\u201d Lyon\u2019s fist slammed into the table. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be this hard to catch him!\u201d</p><p>Tighe looked up to see Kara standing in the doorway.</p><p>Lyon held his hand out to her, but she shook her head. \u201cSorry to interrupt. I was just wondering if Tighe\u2019s seen Delaney. I can\u2019t find her.\u201d</p><p>Tighe was on his feet in an instant.</p><p>So was Hawke. \u201cShe was with you.\u201d</p><p>Kara\u2019s brows drew down with confusion. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen her. I just came downstairs a few minutes ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw you,\u201d Hawke insisted. He blanched. \u201cOr someone who looked just like you.\u201d</p><p>Tighe\u2019s blood went cold. \u201cHe\u2019s got the witch\u2019s glamour. He\u2019s taking on the form of other people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnyone he\u2019s seen.\u201d Hawke\u2019s mouth tightened. \u201cThat\u2019s how he\u2019s been eluding us. It\u2019s how he got away when Kougar and I had him cornered.\u201d</p><p>Lyon pulled out his knife. \u201cPalms. Pink! Join us please.\u201d</p><p>A fist of terror tightened in Tighe\u2019s stomach, every muscle raging to take flight, to find her. He drew out his own knife and sliced his palm, holding it up for his chief to see, then he pulled out his phone and called the phone he\u2019d given Delaney just that morning. Maybe the clone was still pretending to be Kara. Maybe Delaney would answer. But as the phone rang and rang, he knew that son of a bitch had her. His skin felt as if it were tying to crawl off his bones.</p><p>That son of a bitch would kill her. No, not kill her. Not yet. His chest felt like someone were stabbing him through the heart with a hot poker. He\u2019d make her suffer first. He\u2019d feed off her pain and her terror, little by little, like the Daemons of old. Until her tears were spent, her mind was gone, and her body couldn\u2019t take any more.</p><p>He had to find her. Now. He turned to Hawke. \u201cWe can track her if she still has the phone.\u201d</p><p>Hawke ran for the door. \u201cI\u2019ll get my laptop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWulfe, follow her scent,\u201d Lyon barked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll grab Tighe\u2019s pillows for you,\u201d Kara said.</p><p>\u201cNo need.\u201d Wulfe stood. \u201cHer scent is all over Tighe.\u201d</p><p>Within moments, they burst from the doors of Feral House. As Wulfe shifted into his animal and followed Delaney\u2019s scent, Tighe, Hawke, and Jag ran for Jag\u2019s Hummer.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got the signal,\u201d Hawke said as Jag swung out of the circular drive. \u201cIt\u2019s fixed. Over on Oak Woods.\u201d</p><p>Tighe braced himself in the backseat, his senses going out to her. Call for me, Brown Eyes. When she\u2019d been trapped, lost in that vision, he\u2019d heard her calling for him. He\u2019d been able to follow. Call for me, Delaney.</p><p>Was it possible she didn\u2019t yet realize she was in trouble? No. She\u2019d have answered her phone.</p><p>Only one reason she wouldn\u2019t answer either call.</p><p>Goddess. Don\u2019t let her be dead. Not when I\u2019m just starting to understand how much I need her.</p><p>Minutes later, Jag pulled onto Oak Woods.</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d Hawke snapped the laptop closed as Jag pulled the Hummer to a screeching halt. Tighe dove out the door, his senses open. She wasn\u2019t there.</p><p>But her phone was. He saw it gleaming in the light. As he picked it up, as he touched the metal that had been in her hands such a short time ago, he felt a piece of himself die.</p><p>Wulfe came bounding out of the woods, a monster of a gray wolf. He sniffed around the area where the phone had been, then lifted his head to Tighe.</p><p>The scent ends here. She must have gotten into a car.</p><p>Fury rose in a hot wash, burning through Tighe\u2019s blood. He had her. That son of a bitch had her.</p><p>A hand gripped his shoulder, and he turned to face Hawke.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Hawke shook his head, his expression grim. \u201cI\u2019d like to give you platitudes like we\u2019ll find her, but I\u2019m out of ideas of how to catch him, buddy.\u201d His eyes narrowed. \u201cHow did you find her the last time? After she set you up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard her. I think I inadvertently formed a mind connection with her when I was trying to steal her memories. I heard her crying out for me that night and followed. I can\u2019t explain how I knew where she was, but I knew.\u201d He met his friend\u2019s gaze. \u201cShe\u2019s not calling out for me, this time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe may be.\u201d Hawke frowned. \u201cYou just can\u2019t hear her anymore.\u201d</p><p>Tighe closed his eyes, listening. He had to be able to hear her. But, except for his own turbulent thoughts, his mind was silent. And he suddenly realized that the warmth that had brushed against the inside of his skull was gone. The connection was gone.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d But like a fist to the gut, he knew. \u201cThe binding.\u201d</p><p>Hawke nodded, his expression bleak. \u201cI\u2019m afraid so. The accidental connection was probably severed when the new one between you and her was formed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept it only went one way. If I\u2019d bound myself to her, I\u2019d be able to hear her like I did before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Probably more than before.\u201d</p><p>The knowledge pierced him like a dozen blades. He\u2019d intentionally cut himself off from her. In not binding himself to her, in trying to protect her, he\u2019d sealed her fate.</p><p>Inside him the tiger spirit shook his head and let out a furious roar.</p><p>Tighe squeezed his eyes closed, fighting the tiger\u2019s accusation. And losing.</p><p>Because he hadn\u2019t done it for her, as he\u2019d told her. The pain of that realization shredded his heart. He hadn\u2019t been protecting her. He\u2019d been protecting himself. Against a marriage he couldn\u2019t believe would turn out any better than his first one had.</p><p>He\u2019d protected himself. And lost the only thing in his life that mattered.</p><p>Delaney.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-two</p><p>Delaney groaned, trying to rise out of the fog that encased her brain. God, my jaw hurts. An ice-cold vise clamped around her wrist and pulled, yanking her across...</p><p>Her hip plowed into something hard, jarring her fully awake. She was in a car. In a garage.</p><p>In a shock of an instant, everything came flooding back. The clone. He\u2019d caught her.</p><p>She grabbed hold of the door handle as the man who looked just like Tighe tried to haul her across the center console and out the driver\u2019s side door. He\u2019d kill her. If he got her out of the car, he\u2019d kill her.</p><p>The clone reached in, hooking his arm around her shoulders and yanked her toward him, tearing her loose from the car door. No. She whirled toward him, jamming her finger deep into his eye socket.</p><p>A shudder of revulsion traveled from her hand all the way to the soles of her feet. His eye socket was perfectly dry. Inhumanly dry.</p><p>Her attack had no effect. He didn\u2019t scream as any normal man would have. He didn\u2019t even rear back. Instead, he jerked her harder, manhandling her out of the car and into the house as she kicked and fought for her life.</p><p>The moment he hauled her through the door, into a small laundry room, the smell hit. The hair rose on her arms. Decomposing bodies.</p><p>\u201cYou killed somebody here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. This was my first stop after I escaped. My first feeding.\u201d Tighe\u2019s voice washed over her, at once wonderfully familiar and terrifyingly wrong. Because the man...the thing...speaking wasn\u2019t Tighe. \u201cI\u2019ll show you.\u201d He said the last with a lilt of pride that had her stomach roiling.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen dead bodies before.\u201d She struggled to keep her voice calm and even. The creature fed off fear and pain. Swallow your fear. She tried, but her skin was turning clammy, her breaths coming in tight, uneven pulls.</p><p>Pinning her against him, the clone half pushed, half carried her into the kitchen.</p><p>Dear God, dear God, dear God.</p><p>In the middle of the floor, beside a cracker-strewn high chair, was a pile of rotting corpses covered with flies. A pile. As if the despicable creature had killed them and tossed them away one by one.</p><p>Delaney looked away, swallowing desperately against the rising bile, but the image was carved into her brain. Flies crawling across the face of a small boy, his head dangling over the curve of a man\u2019s shoulder, the rest of his body hidden by the bathrobe of a woman. A woman draped faceup over the pile, her arms spread as if even in death she tried to protect her family.</p><p>Delaney breathed through her mouth, panting between swallows. Her mind screamed at the wrongness, at the waste of life, even as hatred burned through her with the force of a wildfire. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou sick bastard.\u201d She stomped her heel hard onto his instep.</p><p>He jerked her around and slammed her against the wall, her head crashing into a picture frame and sending it clattering to the floor as pain crackled along her skull.</p><p>Pressing his body hard against hers, pinning her to the wall, the clone grabbed her face in his hand.</p> <p>\u201cDo you know what I\u2019m going to do to you?\u201d His green eyes had jagged black streaks running across them like cracks in two windshields. Streaks that hadn\u2019t been there the last time he attacked her. Would Tighe\u2019s look the same?</p><p>Oh, Tighe. Find me.</p><p>She spit in the clone\u2019s face. \u201cGo to hell.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t bother to remove the spittle. \u201cYou\u2019re going to scream, human. By the time I\u2019m through with you, your vocal cords will be shredded from your screams.\u201d</p><p>His words twisted inside her, sending her pulse spinning like a tornado. He wanted her afraid. Fight it. Fight him.</p> <p>The clone gripped her face, forcing her to look at him. Oddly, his expression softened, warmth flowing into his eyes. For a heartbeat, she saw Tighe in his face. Tighe as she\u2019d never seen him, his sunglasses off, his eyes filled with soft emotion.</p><p>But this wasn\u2019t Tighe.</p><p>Any resemblance disappeared as cold rushed back into his eyes. His hand gripped her breast and squeezed until he brought tears to her own. His face took on an expression of deep pleasure.</p><p>He was feeding off her pain.</p><p>Maybe he should feed off his own. Catching him off guard, she slammed the heel of her hand into his nose. When he didn\u2019t so much as flinch, she raked her nails down his cheek. He didn\u2019t bleed.</p><p>The full understanding of his inhumanity hit her even as he jerked her away from the wall and threw her to the ground. She slid across the wood floor, stopping less than a foot from the bodies, sending the flies swarming into the air.</p> <p>Oh God, Oh God.</p><p>Her body aching, her mind dazed, she tried to push to her feet, but he stomped her flat with his foot. How long before another body topped that pile of corpses?</p><p>Hers.</p><p>Tighe\u2019s chest burned as he climbed back into Jag\u2019s Hummer with muscles so tense they were cramping Wulfe joined him through the opposite door.</p><p>Goddess, where is she? What is that piece of shit doing to her?</p><p>Is she even still alive?</p><p>\u201cWhen I get my hands on him, he\u2019s not going to die fast,\u201d he snarled. \u201cI\u2019m cutting him up inch by inch until there\u2019s nothing left of him but his head and his heart. Then I\u2019ll shred those, strip by strip.\u201d</p><p>But what would it matter? How sweet would revenge taste when Delaney was dead? The blades in his chest twisted, slicing him anew until he felt the blood running in rivulets down the sides of his heart.</p> <p>\u201cWhere to?\u201d Jag asked, starting the engine. No one answered. Where did they go from here?</p><p>As he opened his mouth to reply, his vision went suddenly, totally black. As it had when he\u2019d first had the visions. Before Delaney got in the way.</p><p>His hand grabbed hold of the door as he held on, knowing he was about to watch the demon feed, and praying, praying, he wasn\u2019t about to watch Delaney die.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-three</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not a witch!\u201d Paenther growled as Foxx pulled on his clothes after snooping on all fours around yet another mountain estate that had absolutely nothing to do with the Mage.</p><p>The clouds had rolled in, driven by a chilly wind, turning the afternoon hazy and gray.</p><p>Foxx finished tying his running shoes. \u201cI\u2019m just saying, you can\u2019t always tell anymore. Zaphene hid her Mage eyes so well, none of us knew she was a witch. She had me fooled but good,\u201d he added morosely. \u201cI thought she was in love with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFoxx.\u201d Paenther sighed as they started walking back to the Mustang parked alongside the road. \u201cI can tell.\u201d Which was an out-and-out lie. He hadn\u2019t known Zaphene was a witch any more than anyone else had. Still...\u201cIf she were a witch, she\u2019d have enthralled me already, right? A touch of her hand, and I\u2019d have been hers. She\u2019s not a witch. And it doesn\u2019t matter anyway, because I\u2019m not going back there. I don\u2019t have time to get involved with a woman. Any woman. Especially one who lives hours from Feral House.\u201d</p><p>Foxx grunted. \u201cIf you\u2019re not interested in her, why do you keep talking about her?\u201d</p><p>Paenther growled low in his throat, his hands fisting on his coat. \u201cI\u2019m not the one who just brought her up again!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but you\u2019re the one who keeps growling. You\u2019re driving me crazy, B.P.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe feeling is mutual, Cub,\u201d Paenther said, as they reached the car. \u201cThe feeling is mutual.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m doing the best I can,\u201d Foxx snapped, guessing correctly Paenther had lost patience with the young Feral\u2019s worthless intuition. They climbed in and Foxx started the car, gunning it onto the empty road.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say you\u2019re not, Foxx, but for two and a half days you\u2019ve been certain Vhyper is in these mountains, and for two and a half days we\u2019ve found shit. We might as well head home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Paenther looked at the younger man sharply.</p><p>Foxx met his gaze. \u201cHe\u2019s here. I know he\u2019s here. And I know we\u2019re going to find him. But not yet.\u201d</p><p>Paenther growled, his claws unsheathing for a frustrated instant. \u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLater today.\u201d</p><p>Paenther stared at his companion. \u201cYou really think that?\u201d</p><p>Foxx\u2019s gaze turned inward, but he nodded slowly. \u201cYeah. You\u2019re going to be talking to him again soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd just how are we going to find him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s going to find you. But later.\u201d Foxx turned the Mustang around in the middle of the road and headed back the way they\u2019d come.</p><p>Paenther scowled. \u201cNow where are you going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFollowing another one of my intuitions. We\u2019re going back to the Market.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to hand me over to a witch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never said she was a witch. I was just making the point that you\u2019re not being very cautious for a guy who\u2019s lived long enough to know better.\u201d</p><p>Paenther growled, but damn, the cub was right. He\u2019d been so blown away by the woman that he\u2019d completely forgotten Zaphene had been able to hide her Mage eyes. Then again, he\u2019d never known a Mage to be able to do that. And, honestly, the chances of his little beauty\u2019s being Mage were one in several million. Maybe a billion. Still, the thought probably should have crossed his mind.</p><p>But what he\u2019d told Foxx was true. If, by some monumental coincidence, she\u2019d been Mage and had wanted to enthrall him, she\u2019d have done it already. She wasn\u2019t Mage. And damn yes, he wanted her.</p><p>As they pulled into the Market\u2019s parking lot twenty minutes later, she was standing at the corner of the building, her head tipped against the wall in a stance that was perhaps a little sad, perhaps weary, as if she\u2019d been waiting for him for hours. Her shapeless dress was a pretty blue, the same summer sky shade as her eyes.</p><p>\u201cGet her out of your system, B.P. I\u2019m tired of all the growling. Besides, my gut\u2019s sure of this one. Hell if I know why, but you need to do this. She\u2019s going to be good for you.\u201d</p><p>Paenther climbed out of the Mustang and hesitated, a dozen reasons not to walk toward her bounding through his mind.</p><p>But then she straightened, and even across the parking lot he could sense the loneliness and longing in her eyes. A hunger less of the flesh than of the spirit. A need of the soul that spoke to something deep inside him, and he found himself unable to turn away.</p><p>The wind whipped, coating him with dust from the parking lot and flinging sharp, tiny raindrops against his cheeks and forehead. He barely noticed.</p><p>As he started toward her, her expression didn\u2019t change. No smile greeted him this time. But with each step, the air around him heated. As did the blue of her eyes.</p><p>His pulse began to pound in his veins, the blood rushing, thick and warm, hardening him in an instant. Her remembered taste danced on his tongue, her scent springing from his pores as if it had been moments and not more than twenty-four hours since he kissed her.</p><p>Goddess, but he needed to get her out of his system. There was only one way he was going to do it.</p><p>As he closed the distance between them, she held out her hand to him, watching him with deep, smoldering eyes. Her warm hand trembled as he curled his own around it. As the wind twirled leaves in the gravel, she turned and tugged on his hand, and he followed. She led him behind the building and up the steep, heavily wooded hill behind the store.</p><p>Surrounded by the rich loamy scents of the woods, all he could smell was violets. Her. The scent wrapped around him, sinking deep into his skin, further inflaming the heat already building.</p><p>He gripped her hand tighter, part reaction to his body\u2019s excitement, part possessiveness as they climbed together, far away from prying eyes.</p><p>He didn\u2019t even know her name.</p><p>He ducked under a low branch, pushing aside another for her. It didn\u2019t matter. All that mattered was sinking inside her and ridding himself of this obsession that had hounded him for two solid days.</p><p>She continued to try to lead him, but they were out of sight of the parking lot, and he couldn\u2019t wait any longer.</p><p>He pulled her to a stop. She turned, her expression enigmatic as she slid into his arms. He covered her mouth with his, and passion exploded inside him. Desire roared through his body, making him heavy and ready. Her taste was even sweeter than he\u2019d remembered, her scent exhilarating.</p><p>As he pressed her back against the nearest tree, he was vaguely aware of a pair of deer wandering close, watching them curiously.</p><p>She kissed him frantically, as if she feared they didn\u2019t have much time. He kissed her back with the same intensity, desperate to taste her, to feel her, to know her in every way.</p><p>The feel of her hand on his zipper made his blood pound. The touch of her fingers along the length of his bare flesh nearly stopped his heart.</p><p>Gentleness and care be damned, he needed her now. Shoving his hand beneath her dress, he found her as bare and ready as she\u2019d been the day before. Hot, wet, and whimpering with desire as his finger probed her depths.</p><p>Without pretense, he yanked up her dress to her waist then lifted her, positioning her sheath to his height. As she wrapped her bare thighs around his waist, he pushed inside her, filling her in a single, perfect thrust.</p><p>Heaven. Nothing in his entire life had ever felt more right. He thrust into her, over and over, pressing her against the tree at her back until she was gasping and moaning with pleasure. Within moments, her release broke over her with a cry, her inner muscles contracting hard around him, driving him over the edge.</p><p>\u201cLook at me,\u201d she cried on a husky groan.</p><p>As his seed pumped into her, his body and mind open as they only were during sexual release, he stared into her passion glazed eyes.</p><p>And froze.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, warrior,\u201d she said softly, her eyes no longer the simple sky blue of a human\u2019s.</p><p>As darkness swallowed his vision from the outside in, he stared into blue eyes now rimmed in copper and knew his luck had followed his caution into oblivion.</p><p>For the second time in his life, he\u2019d fallen into the trap of a Mage.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-four</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s alive.\u201d</p><p>Tighe felt the Hummer\u2019s upholstery at his back, but his mind was fully with Delaney as he watched her through the clone\u2019s eyes. But even as he rejoiced in her survival, he wondered how long it would last.</p><p>He felt Wulfe\u2019s big hand on his shoulder. \u201cAny identifiers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone. She\u2019s in a kitchen, I think.\u201d She was on her stomach on a polished wood floor lined with blue paint, in a room swarming with flies, a knee\u2014the clone\u2019s knee\u2014firmly planted in her back. While Tighe was forced to watch, hands that looked like his own stripped the sweater and bra from the body of the woman Tighe would right now give his life to protect.</p><p>The bastard flipped her onto her back. Delaney\u2019s eyes glittered with hatred, lanced through with pain. And fear.</p><p>Fury roared in Tighe\u2019s ears, melding with the sound of the chaos as his fingers began to burn.</p><p>\u201cStay in your skin!\u201d Wulfe growled. \u201cShe won\u2019t stand a chance if you lose it.\u201d</p><p>Delaney. Goddess. Delaney.</p><p>He took deep breaths, fighting back the chaos. She needed him.</p><p>She tried to hit the clone, one feminine hand flying into his eyes only to be stopped and wrenched to the floor where a length of rope lay waiting. With Tighe\u2019s own nimble fingers, the clone tied the rope tight around her wrist.</p><p>Delaney tugged, but her hand went nowhere. Tighe saw why. The rope had been attached to an eyebolt screwed into the floor. As if the clone had planned everything.</p><p>\u201cOf course he planned it,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cPlanned what?\u201d Hawke asked.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s tying her to the floor. Already had the eyebolts and rope ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Why her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho knows. He must have seen us together. At the Lincoln Memorial. During that first apartment fire. He could have been anywhere. Anyone.\u201d</p><p>The clone slammed his knee into the crevice beneath her rib cage, making her eyes bulge with pain as he yanked her other arm wide from her body and tied her second wrist.</p><p>Delaney grabbed the ropes, lifted her hips, and kicked hard at her captor\u2019s face, but her strength and speed were no match for a Feral\u2019s, and the clone\u2019s were. He grabbed her heels and pulled off her boots and socks, one after another as tears glistened in furious brown eyes.</p><p>She was right there. Right there. Close enough to reach out and touch, and he couldn\u2019t help her.</p><p>He gripped the seat, his stomach cramping. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cJesus!

He stripped her. He\u2019s touching her.\u201d The sight of that demon\u2019s hands reaching between her legs...</p><p>His head pounded with the force of his fury. His fingers burned. The chaos swirled at the edges of his mind, black fingers of darkness curling toward him, ready to hook around him and pull him in. His claws began to unsheathe.</p><p>\u201cTighe! He\u2019s not going to rape her. He doesn\u2019t have any blood in that body, and a cock can\u2019t rise without blood. He\u2019s just trying to scare her. Whatever he does, she\u2019s alive, buddy. As long as she\u2019s alive, you can get her back. But you\u2019ve got to stay in your skin.\u201d</p><p>He fought the darkness, pushing away the fury. She needed him. Needed him.</p><p>Slowly, painfully, he pulled himself back from that edge, his thoughts clinging to Delaney. She had to be terrified. He knew she was strong. If any woman could survive this mentally, it was his brown eyes. But he had to reach her. He had to save her. He had to stay in control.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have enough fear in you,\u201d the clone said with a touch of disgust, at last pulling his hand away.</p> <p>As he rose, Tighe\u2019s own sight of Delaney widened. The blue paint staining the floor suddenly took on an ominous significance.</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Hawke demanded.</p><p>\u201cA pentagram. She\u2019s lying in the middle of a Daemon\u2019s sacrificial pentagram.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStay in your skin!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in it!\u201d The vision ended. Tighe shook off Wulfe\u2019s massive hand, a deep, furious growl rumbling in his chest at the thought of Delaney in that bastard\u2019s clutches. His gaze flew to Hawke. \u201cWhy the pentagram? Why does he have her in a sacrificial pentagram?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEasy, buddy,\u201d Hawke said. \u201cDaemons used pentagrams for any number of purposes, most of which we don\u2019t know. At least we know he caught her for a purpose other than to feed from her. We just don\u2019t know what it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink, Tighe,\u201d Wulfe urged, his hand landing heavily on Tighe\u2019s shoulder. \u201cWhat did you see in that vision? We need clues.\u201d</p> <p>Tighe gripped his head, forcing himself to replay the scene though it tore strips from his soul. \u201cNothing but impressions. A big house. Lots of trees in the backyard. No houses easily visible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould be around here,\u201d Hawke murmured.</p><p>\u201cCould be anywhere in the Mid-Atlantic,\u201d Tighe snapped, then took a shuddering breath. \u201cMy gut says it was near here. He didn\u2019t take her far.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat else?\u201d Hawke prompted.</p><p>\u201cHe said...right before the vision ended he told her she didn\u2019t have enough fear in her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe wasn\u2019t feeding him. He may have gone to feed elsewhere.\u201d</p><p>Tighe closed his fingers around his hair until his scalp ached. \u201cOr he killed her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d have seen it,\u201d Hawke said. \u201cYou\u2019re getting the visions again. At least when he feeds from Delaney.\u201d</p><p>Tighe lifted his head and speared his friend with his gaze. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoddess knows. The three of you are connected, that\u2019s all I can tell you. If he were feeding from her, I think you\u2019d be seeing it. But you may not see him feeding from anyone else. Delaney\u2019s probably still seeing those.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe shitbag\u2019s probably setting another fire,\u201d Jag drawled.</p><p>\u201cI agree. Pull over, Jag.\u201d Hawke turned to look at them all. \u201cI think he has Delaney nearby, and he\u2019s going to set those fires the same. I\u2019ll take to the air. Wulfe, shift and try to pick up her scent. Jag, call Lyon, tell him what we know, get him or Kougar to get on the emergency bandwidths and listen for a fire to be called in, then drive through the neighborhoods looking yourselves. And keep Tighe in his skin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye-aye, Admiral,\u201d Jag drawled.</p><p>Hawke opened the door, shifted, and flew out while Wulfe leaped from his own door on all fours.</p><p>\u201cGet the doors, Stripes. Looks like it\u2019s just you and me, now, Wigout. Keep your eyes peeled for smoke.\u201d</p><p>Tighe pulled the two doors closed, then collapsed against the seat back as Jag called Feral House and filled them in. His body ached. Delaney. What have I done? If only I\u2019d bound myself to you. If only.</p><p>I see the fires. Hawke\u2019s voice sounded in his head. He\u2019s got three houses on Birch Terrace circled with flames.</p><p>I\u2019m on my way. Tighe opened the door of the moving car and leaped out, shifting into his tiger in midair. Behind him he could hear Jag\u2019s, \u201cShit!\u201d, but he never slowed. He could get there faster on foot than Jag could in the car, and all that mattered was finding Delaney.</p><p>Delaney lay alone and shivering on the hardwood floor, a grandfather clock somewhere in the deserted house chiming the quarter hour. Fifteen minutes, the clone had been gone. Maybe twenty. And she knew exactly what he\u2019d been up to.</p><p>Three fires, three houses in a row, as if he wanted to get the biggest feed for his match. The pain of the vision was finally beginning to recede from her head.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not dead yet!\u201d Her voice rang into the empty room as she jerked her head, jarring the stupid flies loose from her face. Her nostrils were so fried from the stench, she almost couldn\u2019t smell it any longer.</p><p>Is he just going to leave me here?</p><p>Cold sweat slicked her skin. Terror snaked in and out of her heart, slithering and gnawing as it went. So cold.</p><p>Tighe, please. Please find me. Use your superpowers. Find me.</p><p>A door clicked and opened. She lifted her head, for one desperate moment thinking Tighe had heard her. But the man who walked into the kitchen had eyes of pure evil.</p><p>Delaney shuddered, her shivers becoming violent as terror joined the cold. What would he do to her this time?</p><p>Despair nearly stole her will. How badly would he hurt her before he finally put his mouth to her neck again, as he had the first time, and took her life?</p><p>Tears burned in her eyes, but she fought them back. Tighe would come. He\u2019d come for her. She had to believe that.</p><p>The clone stood over her, looking down at her body, his gaze crawling across her breasts.</p><p>\u201cDid you feed?\u201d she asked, struggling to keep her voice even. He could probably sense her emotions better than Tighe since he actually drank them. But not hearing the fear in her own voice helped her keep the rank hysteria at bay.</p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d Squatting at her hip, he reached between her legs, his cold, awful touch stroking her, circling her opening.</p><p>Her eyes nearly rolled back in her head as she fought to scramble away mentally from the feel of that cold, inhuman finger.</p><p>\u201cI feed on pain, but I think you know that. And I know a thousand ways to cause it. A thousand ways without killing you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re only a few weeks old. How could you possibly know a thousand ways?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDaemon memories, thanks to my draden host. Ways to torture a human.\u201d</p><p>His finger slid across the tight, dry opening to her womb. \u201cImagine the steel hilt of a knife, heated over an open fire until it glows red, then shoved...\u201d</p><p>He pressed his finger inside her. She gasped at the sharp tug of pain, her mind screaming against the invasion as much as the horror of his words.</p><p>\u201cCan you imagine it?\u201d</p><p>Oh, God. \u201cYes.\u201d Her heart thudded. She had to stop reacting. She had to get control of her fear. Get her mind on something else before he turned her into a trembling wreck.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you take me? What do you want with me other than my fear?\u201d</p><p>His finger left her, his cold hand closing around her breast, stroking it with frightening gentleness. \u201cI\u2019ve never forgotten you. From the moment I first put my mouth on you, I\u2019ve thought of you.\u201d</p><p>He swung his long leg over her and straddled her waist, bracing his arms on either side of her head as he stared into her eyes. Slowly, his eyes changed, the coldness pushed aside by a warmth, a depth of emotion that made her skin crawl.</p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>Staring at him, she could almost believe he thought he did. \u201cThen why do you want to hurt me? If you loved me, you\u2019d let me go.\u201d</p><p>He grinned at her, flashing Tighe\u2019s dimples, intelligence gleaming in his eyes. \u201cNice try. But, no, I\u2019m not going to let you go.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cI may have feelings for you, but at heart I\u2019m a Daemon. I need someone to help me get the other half of the soul I need to survive. And when I saw you with him, when I realized he was the one touching you, I decided to take you from him. You\u2019ll be the one to help me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll never help you.\u201d</p><p>He smiled, the coldness rushing back into his eyes. \u201cOh, but you will. Now, as a matter of fact.\u201d</p><p>He swung off her, then moved until he was kneeling at her head. Her heart thundered with terror as he gripped her face with both icy hands.</p><p>Cold flowed into her. So cold. Every time he touched her, her body temperature dropped another degree, until she feared she was at risk for hypothermia.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she demanded, unable to keep the quaver out of her voice.</p><p>For more than a minute, he didn\u2019t answer, just stroked her temples with gentle thumbs as he watched her upside down.</p><p>His fingers stopped their caressing and his grip tightened. \u201cWhat am I doing? I\u2019m making you mine, Delaney. I\u2019m making you mine.\u201d</p><p>His fingers squeezed. Pain unlike anything she\u2019d ever imagined poured into her head and began to pump through her veins like acid. Screams tore through her mind, raking her flesh.</p><p>Deep inside, she felt something unnatural, something evil, take root and grow.</p><p>Tighe tore through the woods, following his tiger\u2019s scent of smoke as surely as his own human sense of direction. The moment he reached the back of the burning houses, he knew Delaney wasn\u2019t in any of them. The lots were small, houses crowding too close in the back.</p><p>Sirens tore through the lightly falling rain, and he took off. The humans could take care of their own.</p><p>As he headed toward the more affluent area where a house might back onto nothing but woods, he caught a glimpse of Wulfe.</p><p>I may have picked up the clone\u2019s scent, Wulfe said. It\u2019s not a smell, exactly, but I remember feeling something similar near where we found her phone.</p><p>I\u2019m right behind you, Tighe told him, and raced after him, his sleek tiger\u2019s body eating up the ground with ease. \u201cWulfe\u2019s picked up a scent,\u201d he told Hawke.</p><p>I heard. I\u2019ve got you spotted. I\u2019m following.</p><p>Tighe recognized the trees behind a large brick-front Colonial a split second before he heard the scream.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take the front,\u201d Wulfe said.</p><p>A large bay window framed kitchen cabinets. Without a single pause, Tighe flew over the high railing of the deck and crashed through the glass.</p><p>Delaney lay on the floor, staked in the center of the pentagram as he\u2019d seen her in the vision. He could hear her heart beating. Unconscious, but alive. Thank you, goddess.</p><p>Hawke ran in from the front of the house. \u201cWhere is he?\u201d</p><p>Tighe shifted back into a man. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t here. Find him.\u201d He pulled out one of his switchblades and knelt at Delaney\u2019s feet, cutting her loose. He\u2019d freed her feet and pushed her legs together, and was sawing at the third bond when Wulfe and Hawke ran into the room from the opposite door.</p><p>\u201cWhere is he?\u201d Hawke demanded.</p><p>D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. Tighe froze and stared at his friend. Understanding crashed over him like falling ice. \u201cHe was here. He was you.\u201d Tighe leaped to his feet. \u201cBleed! Now.\u201d</p><p>Wulfe and Hawke each pulled a knife and cut himself, then held their palms up as the blood ran down their flesh.</p><p>Tighe sliced his own.</p><p>\u201cFind him!\u201d</p><p>Damn it. Damn it! He\u2019d been so concerned with Delaney, he\u2019d forgotten the clone could change shape at will. That error just might cost him his life.</p><p>But he\u2019d found her. He\u2019d found her.</p><p>At least he thought he had. He could take no more chances. Lifting her free hand, he pressed the tip of his knife into her finger, drawing a single droplet of blood. She flinched, jerking her hand, and stirred.</p><p>As he watched, her eyes fluttered open, her gaze going from him to the knife still smeared with his own blood. With devastating dismay he watched those brown eyes fill with hopelessness and fear.</p><p>Fear. Of him.</p><p>He hated her fear.</p><p>Inside his head, the chaos rushed at him in a deafening roar.</p><p>\u201cNo, D, no!\u201d He growled, his jaw clenching, his fingertips burning. \u201cYou\u2019re safe.\u201d</p><p>But he wasn\u2019t.</p><p>The chaos broke over him like a tidal wave, the fury clawing through his limbs, into his heart and head, swirling inside him as he fought to battle it back.</p><p>But it was too strong. His defenses against it too badly cracked.</p><p>Too late. Too late.</p><p>His claws unsheathed. His fangs dropped.</p><p>His conscious mind disappeared in a bottomless well of darkness.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-five</p><p>\u201cTighe?\u201d</p><p>Delaney fought against the pain that encased her body, struggling to clear her mind as a battle raged around her. He\u2019d come for her. For one horrible moment she\u2019d thought he was the clone, but then she\u2019d heard his voice. He\u2019d come for her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She forced her eyes open, then squeezed them shut as something sailed over her head. A battle. They\u2019d caught him. But the sounds that reached her ears were oddly, frighteningly familiar. Growling. Snarling. The breaking of furniture, just like the two times Tighe had lost it.</p><p>Oh, no. Please, not that.</p><p>She tried to move and realized she was only tied by one wrist. So cold. Exhaustion tugged at her battered mind, and she curled onto her side.</p> <p>Stay awake. Warn them.</p><p>Out of the corner of her eye, another Feral appeared. Jag, her mind suggested.</p><p>His gaze went to the pile of dead bodies, his face screwing up in disgust. \u201cJesus. Someone needs to teach that demon to clean up after himself when he\u2019s done eating. He\u2019s feeding the whole bloody fly population of Northern Virginia!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBleed, Jag!\u201d Wulfe roared.</p><p>Jag scowled, pulled out a knife, and cut himself. Blood rolled down his palm.</p> <p>\u201cGet Delaney. We\u2019ve got to get Tighe locked up.\u201d</p><p>Locked up. Her chest squeezed. Lost in the darkness.</p><p>Jag bent over her, cutting the last of her bonds.</p><p>She tried to focus her eyes on him, but she was fast slipping away. \u201cNot...Feral House. Did something to me. I\u2019m...dangerous. And...get my boots!\u201d</p><p>Delaney woke to the sound of the river and voices, and the feel of a cool wind in her face. She lay still, her battered mind trying to identify the voices as friend or foe. All male. No, a female voice.</p><p>She opened her eyes, finding a ceiling of stars high above her head, all but blotted out by a bright light just to her side. Kara. Her forehead wrinkled at the sight of the woman sitting with her legs crossed, glowing like a camp lantern.</p> <p>\u201cHi there,\u201d Kara said softly, meeting her gaze. \u201cYou\u2019re safe, Delaney.\u201d</p><p>Delaney tried to shake her head, but nothing happened. \u201cYou\u2019re glowing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I do,\u201d she said with a lilt in her voice. \u201cRemember I told you I was the power plug? I wish I could use some of my power to help you, but they tell me only Ferals can handle it. But I\u2019m keeping the light on and the rock warm for you. Are you still cold?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Warm.\u201d Surprisingly warm, despite the cool wind. She felt as if someone had wrapped her in blankets and laid her on a heated bed.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere am I?\u201d Her gaze moved to an oddly dressed teenager kneeling on her other side, his hand on her forehead, his eyes closed.</p><p>\u201cThe goddess stone,\u201d Kara told her. \u201cThe men called a Feral Circle, a mystic circle, to keep out draden and prying human eyes. The Shaman is trying to figure out what was done to you and whether you\u2019re really a danger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTighe?\u201d</p> <p>Kara\u2019s brows knit unhappily. \u201cHe\u2019s at Feral House.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the prison?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid so. He may still snap out of it.\u201d But her tone said she didn\u2019t believe it.</p><p>\u201cI need to...see him.\u201d</p><p>The young man she assumed was the Shaman lifted his hand from her forehead. As she turned her gaze to him, he looked down at her with ancient eyes in his youthful face.</p><p>\u201cHello, Delaney.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d</p><p>He turned to face a distant point beyond Kara\u2019s light.</p><p>\u201cHe definitely left a mark on her, Lyon,\u201d he said. \u201cUnlike anything I\u2019ve ever seen. Not a dark charm. Nothing that concrete. More like shadows on her soul.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs she a danger to us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t answer that for a certainty, but my instincts tell me those shadows are wounds, not magic. She needs to rest. To heal, both physically and mentally. It\u2019s too bad Tighe\u2019s not available to help the process.\u201d</p><p>Tighe. Tears formed in her eyes. But she felt the Shaman\u2019s hand on her forehead again, and slept before they had a chance to fall.</p><p>When Delaney woke again, she was in Tighe\u2019s bedroom. The room was dark, but light shone from beneath the closed door, and the rumble of voices carried from far below. It was probably still evening. She stretched, taking quick inventory, deciding nothing hurt, then shuddered as memories rushed into her mind. The clone. Tighe. Kara had said he\u2019d lost it and was in the prison. She envisioned him trapped in a darkness as bleak and terrifying as the one he\u2019d pulled her from.</p><p>If there was a way to free him from his own dark hell, she was going to find it.</p><p>She pushed off the covers and swung her feet over the side of the bed, noting that the pajamas Kara had loaned her were back on her again. For a brief moment, she considered trying to find something better to wear downstairs than Kara\u2019s p.j.s, and as quickly dismissed the concern. They certainly showed less of her than the ceremonial gown. And if she remembered that nightmare in the kitchen correctly, they\u2019d seen her in less. Far less.</p><p>Flicking on the light, she did a quick search of the walls and pulled down a wicked-looking twelve-inch dagger. She was not going unarmed again. Barefoot, she flew from the room and down the richly curved stairs.</p><p>Kougar glanced up as he crossed the foyer, his pale gaze expressionless.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Tighe?\u201d</p><p>He turned away. \u201cHe\u2019s lost to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike hell he is.\u201d She moved to cut him off. \u201cI want to see him.\u201d</p><p>He towered over her, but stopped, eyeing her like he might an interesting little bug.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to see if I can get him out of there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t.\u201d He started around her.</p><p>She lifted the blade, threatening him if he took another step. \u201cSometimes when I touch him, it helps calm him. I might be able to pull him back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll kill you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m willing to risk it.\u201d</p><p>He lifted his hand and stroked his goatee as he studied her. \u201cYou would\u2019ve attacked me.\u201d</p><p>Delaney blinked, at first thinking he meant just then, when she\u2019d raised the blade. Then she remembered the mating ceremony, when he\u2019d cut Tighe. When she\u2019d jumped off the pedestal, thinking they were in for a fight.</p><p>\u201cHis enemies are my enemies. At that moment, I wasn\u2019t sure whether you fell into that category.\u201d</p><p>Without so much as an acknowledgment that she\u2019d spoken, he turned and went back the way he\u2019d come.</p><p>Delaney stared at his retreating back and released a frustrated sigh, then turned, figuring she\u2019d have to find Tighe on her own.</p><p>But she\u2019d barely taken two steps when Kougar spoke. \u201cThe human wants to see Tighe.\u201d</p><p>Delaney whirled back to find Kougar standing in a doorway partway around the corner.</p><p>\u201cLike hell.\u201d Lyon\u2019s voice.</p><p>She strode to Kougar and walked past him into what had to be Lyon\u2019s office. The big man sat behind a desk with a computer, shelves full of books and binders on the wall behind him.</p><p>Lyon\u2019s brow lifted as he dropped his gaze to her weapon. \u201cIs there a reason you\u2019re armed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTighe took my guns. And the last time I walked down those stairs, it didn\u2019t end so well.\u201d She lifted the blade, her eyes going hard. \u201cI\u2019m thinking maybe you should bleed for me.\u201d</p><p>A spark of respect lit his eyes. He pulled out his knife and drew blood from his palm, holding her gaze. \u201cKougar?\u201d</p><p>She turned and watched as the pale-eyed Feral did the same, then before they could ask, she pricked her own finger on the tip of her blade. After showing Lyon the blood, she sucked it from her skin.</p><p>\u201cI want you to take me to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t want you to see him as he is now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already seen him like that. The night he punched me full of holes. I need to touch him. I might be able to reach him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cImpossible. You\u2019re only a human.\u201d</p><p>She moved forward and leaned on his desk. \u201cWe won\u2019t know whether or not I can help him until I try.\u201d</p><p>Something approaching sorrow warmed his amber eyes. \u201cWe\u2019ve been trying to reach him for two days, Delaney. There\u2019s nothing to be done.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him, his words a painful shock. \u201cTwo days? He\u2019s been lost in there for two days?\u201d</p><p>Lyon\u2019s eyes turned almost sympathetic. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>But his revelation only made her more desperate to reach him. She turned to Kougar. \u201cShow me where he is.\u201d</p><p>He gave an almost imperceptible nod and turned.</p><p>Behind her, Lyon leaped to his feet with a growl. \u201cDelaney!\u201d</p><p>She turned to face the chief of the Ferals, understanding why he was the leader as she felt the force within those amber eyes.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll take your arm off if you reach in there. There\u2019s nothing in that cage but a vicious, wild animal.\u201d</p><p>She flinched.</p><p>He saw it. His expression tightened with a pain that might almost have matched her own. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing I can do for him except catch that clone.\u201d</p><p>Delaney shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m not leaving him in there another second if I can get him out.\u201d She looked at him forcefully. \u201cI need you to hold him down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll it will take is a single slash of his claws, or one errant bite, and you\u2019re dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a risk I\u2019m willing to take. Twice he saved me when I needed him. Now he needs me.\u201d</p><p>Lyon stared at her for a long, heavy minute. \u201cYou\u2019re in love with him.\u201d</p><p>She nodded slowly with a wry purse of her lips. \u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>On a huff of frustration, Lyon came around the desk. \u201cIf he kills you, he\u2019ll never forgive me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I pull him out of there, you\u2019ll have another warrior at your side.\u201d</p><p>Lyon sighed. \u201cTrue. Come on, then.\u201d</p><p>He led her back through the foyer and down the same stairs Tighe had taken her to be mated. They passed the cavelike room and entered a wide, open gym, a section of which contained surprisingly modern equipment, including weight benches, stationary bikes, and six of the biggest treadmills she\u2019d ever seen. At the back of that room, Lyon opened yet another door hidden within a wall of mirrors onto a long, narrow, stone-lined passage. Rustic and a little bit spooky.</p><p>As she\u2019d suspected, she never would have found Tighe on her own.</p><p>\u201cThe house doesn\u2019t look this big from upstairs,\u201d she murmured as she followed him. Kougar brought up the rear.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not,\u201d Lyon said cryptically.</p><p>Sounds began to reach her ears, the grunts and snarls of an animal. Tighe. She\u2019d seen him feral before. A classic horror-show wolf man, only terribly, terribly real. Her fingernails dug into her palms as she prepared herself for that sight again.</p><p>The passage finally opened onto what was clearly a prison block with three thick-walled cells on either side, each with a heavily barred steel door. The floor was stone.</p><p>Gripping the bars of one door with fingers tipped by three-inch claws was Tighe.</p><p>Or rather the creature Tighe had become.</p><p>As before, his teeth were the wicked fangs of a tiger. His sunglasses were gone, his eyes those of an animal rather than a human\u2014large, orange-gold pupils streaked with black. Not even a flicker of humanity lurked in their depths.</p><p>Tighe roared with fury, shaking the bars as if he wanted nothing more than to rip them out of their hinges and tear the limbs off anyone he could sink his claws into. With icy understanding, she knew that was exactly what he\u2019d do if he got loose. She was not only risking her own life for what was almost certainly a waste of time, but she might even be risking the lives of the two men she\u2019d dragged down there with her.</p><p>\u201cTighe?\u201d Delaney stepped closer to the cage, but not so close he could reach through and catch her with those claws. \u201cTighe! Can you hear me?\u201d</p><p>His growls only intensified.</p><p>\u201cTighe, it\u2019s me. Delaney. Tighe, I need you. Your men need you. You\u2019ve got to fight your way back.\u201d</p><p>But the creature in front of her just snarled and shook the bars, his eyes at once wild and dead.</p><p>\u201cI did warn you,\u201d Lyon said softly.</p><p>She turned and met his gaze. \u201cI need to touch him. I may need to look into his eyes.\u201d</p><p>Lyon watched her for a long moment before he tossed her a key and nodded to the far cell. \u201cLock yourself in until we have him down. Don\u2019t come out until I tell you to.\u201d</p><p>With a nod, she went into the cell he\u2019d indicated, pulled the metal door shut with a clang, then reached through the bars to lock it from outside. A shiver of claustrophobia had her curling her fingers tight around one cool steel bar. And Tighe had been caged like that for two days. Did he even know? Was he somewhat aware of where he was or, as she had been, was he floating around some dark void?</p><p>As she watched, Lyon and Wulfe shifted into the wolf-man feral state, their fangs and claws sprouting. Goose bumps rose on her arms. Unlike Tighe, though, they seemed to be in complete control. It wasn\u2019t the feral state itself that had sent Tighe into oblivion. It was his halved soul. The feral state was only the door into that place.</p><p>The moment Lyon unlocked Tighe\u2019s cage, all hell broke loose. Tighe sprang at them, slashing and ripping with his claws, going for Lyon\u2019s throat.</p><p>Delaney pressed her hand to her forehead. Kara was going to kill her if Lyon died because of this.</p><p>But Lyon had clearly been prepared for the attack. In a carefully coordinated move, the two thinking Ferals went at Tighe from both sides and, in a matter of minutes, had him pinned to the floor, facedown. While Wulfe sat on him, pulling his arms up his back nearly to his shoulder blades, Lyon crushed his face against the floor.</p><p>\u201cReady,\u201d Lyon said.</p><p>Delaney\u2019s heart threatened to pound right out of her chest. Her palms turned damp. Was she really going in there?</p><p>She remembered Tighe\u2019s voice when she\u2019d been the one lost in the dark. The unbelievable relief. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Yes. She was really going in there.</p><p>Sticking her hand back between the bars, she unlocked the door and let herself out, then crossed the stone floor to enter Tighe\u2019s cage. She shivered at the sight of Lyon and Kougar watching her with animal eyes, fangs dripping from their mouths. Beneath them, Tighe thrashed and snarled, desperate to be free to annihilate them all.</p><p>And she was walking into his cage instead of running for her life as any sane person would do. Then again, running had never been her style.</p> <p>Circling the edges of the cage, Delaney finally knelt near Tighe\u2019s head. He saw her. Oh yeah, he saw her. He snarled, his mouth dripping with saliva as he tried to snap at her with deadly teeth.</p><p>A wild, vicious animal Lyon had called him. And he was. On the outside. But the man she\u2019d fallen in love with was in there somewhere. Oh, Tighe. How much harder must this be for you?</p><p>Shaking like a rookie on her first takedown, she reached for him, laying her hand on the bare flesh of one of the arms Kougar had pinned high up Tighe\u2019s back. His skin was warm and damp with exertion, but she knew that arm. How many times had it held her with gentle strength?</p><p>The thought grounded her.</p><p>\u201cTighe, I know you\u2019re in there. Come back to me. I need you to come back to me.\u201d</p> <p>But her words didn\u2019t calm him, just as her touch was having no effect. If anything, he thrashed and struggled all the harder to free himself. As if dinner were within his reach and two fools were keeping him from it.</p><p>Despair pressed on her heart. Was she being totally foolish to think she could help him? She was human. Powerless. Tighe\u2019s thrashing body began to glisten through the tears filling her eyes.</p><p>\u201cDo something, Delaney,\u201d Lyon growled. \u201cWe can\u2019t hold him forever.\u201d</p><p>With a bracing breath, she lowered herself to the floor until she lay beside Tighe, face-to-face. Until she was staring into those wild, golden orange tiger eyes with the jagged black lines.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with his eyes? The clone\u2019s had the same weird lines.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe soul they share is disintegrating.\u201d</p> <p>Disintegrating. Oh, Tighe. Fool or not, she wasn\u2019t giving up until she got him out of there.</p><p>\u201cTighe.\u201d As Lyon\u2019s big hand pinned Tighe\u2019s head, struggling to keep him from turning and biting off her fingers, Delaney gingerly reached for him, touching his stubbled jaw just below his upper fangs.</p><p>He growled low in his throat.</p><p>\u201cTighe, I know you\u2019re in there. Do you remember when I was trapped in the darkness? You came for me. You reached down deep in my mind and came for me. I don\u2019t know how you did that. I\u2019m terrified it takes some kind of Feral gift that I don\u2019t possess.\u201d</p><p>Her voice caught as a tear escaped her eye to run over the bridge of her nose.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m hoping you can follow my voice, Tighe. Follow my voice.\u201d</p><p>She stroked the rough stubble of his jaw, running her fingers gently over his warm skin, as she stared into those black and orange-gold tiger eyes that tracked her without recognition. Without humanity.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not like him. Even feral like this, your skin\u2019s warm. Alive. Come back to me, Tighe.\u201d She couldn\u2019t stop the tears. \u201cI need you to come back to me.\u201d</p> <p>Keeping her gaze pinned on his, she thought of Tighe in there and tried to mimic the way he used to touch her mind when he was trying to get control over her. She\u2019d been able to feel him like a warm presence in her head. If only she knew how to do that.</p><p>She kept talking, praying her voice might find its way down into whatever dark cellar he\u2019d fallen into. \u201cTighe, I\u2019m remembering how you brushed my mind when you were trying to steal my memories of you. How the touch of your mind against mine was warm and soft. And so much more. I\u2019m remembering that touch of your mind, and I\u2019m reaching for yours. In my mind, I\u2019m reaching for you.\u201d</p><p>This was useless. Embarrassing. How could she ever think she could help him? A human.</p><p>With a suddenness that had her gasping, the face of a tiger leaped into her head as it had the other time, so clear, it almost felt real. A wild, beautiful sight. Like before she startled.</p><p>The tiger began to fade.</p><p>\u201cNo! No, come back to me, tiger.\u201d Her fingers dug into Tighe\u2019s jaw as she thought of the tiger this time, willing him to return.</p><p>He did. His ruffed, striped face rose in her mind until she could neither think of, nor see, anything else. And as it did, a warmth wrapped around her as strong and wonderful as Tighe\u2019s arms.</p><p>Her tears fell in earnest.</p><p>\u201cFind him for me. I can\u2019t reach him, but you can. Find him. Please find him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s connected with his animal.\u201d Kougar\u2019s voice fell on her ears as if from a distance.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be damned,\u201d Lyon replied.</p><p>D?</p><p>Tighe\u2019s voice sounded in her head, clear, but faint.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here, Tighe.\u201d She said the words out loud. \u201cCan you hear me?\u201d</p><p>Yes.</p><p>\u201cFollow my voice.\u201d</p><p>Slowly, the hungry predatory eyes began to take on a glow of humanity. Even more slowly, his fangs began to recede, and the pupils of his eyes shrank until white showed around them again, and the color beneath the black shards turned to green.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re okay?\u201d The words fell from his throat roughly, more growl than speech as his fangs disappeared altogether.</p><p>She lunged forward and pressed her cheek against his, drenching him with her tears. The next thing she knew, she was in his arms, crying with relief, battered by all that had happened since she last felt his arms around her. And scared by Lyon\u2019s words. That Tighe\u2019s soul was disintegrating.</p><p>Lyon cleared his throat behind her.</p><p>Tighe ran his hand down her hair. \u201cLet\u2019s get up.\u201d She pushed off him and stood, brushing away the tears on her cheeks as he rose beside her. He reached for something in the corner and when he straightened those blasted sunglasses of his were back on his face, having miraculously survived the fight.</p><p>He reached for her, pulling her tight against his side as he faced the others.</p><p>\u201cWelcome back.\u201d Lyon eyed him with a relief that glowed hotly in his amber eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the situation?\u201d Tighe asked, as if he\u2019d just woken from a quick nap. \u201cAny news from Paenther?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot today. I got a brief call from Foxx yesterday. They haven\u2019t found anything, yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about my clone?\u201d</p><p>Lyon\u2019s mouth tensed. \u201cIn the two days you\u2019ve been out, we\u2019ve tried every Daemon-trapping spell Kougar can come up with, but so far, no luck. Either the clone\u2019s not Daemon enough, or the rituals aren\u2019t right.\u201d</p><p>Tighe\u2019s arm tightened around her. \u201cSo I\u2019m out of luck?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not giving up.\u201d But Lyon\u2019s tone held little hope.</p><p>Delaney pressed her cheek against Tighe\u2019s chest as fear twisted in her heart.</p><p>\u201cHow long do I have?\u201d Tighe asked.</p><p>Lyon just shook his head.</p><p>Tighe stiffened. \u201cTell me, Roar.\u201d</p><p>The man, who was clearly Tighe\u2019s friend, cleared his throat, a suspicious glimmer entering his eyes. When he spoke, his voice was low and pained.</p><p>\u201cYour soul...is almost gone. The Shaman thinks you may see another sunrise. But you won\u2019t see another sunset unless we get a miracle. I\u2019m sorry, Tighe.\u201d</p><p>Delaney stiffened. \u201cThere has to be something you can do. You\u2019re immortal. Supermen.\u201d</p><p>Lyon shook his head slowly. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Tighe was silent. His body still. \u201cWhat about D?\u201d He asked finally. \u201cIs she okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs far as we can tell. The Shaman\u2019s knowledge is of Mage magic, not Daemon. But she seems to be okay.\u201d Lyon\u2019s gaze swung to Delaney. To her surprise, he came to her, put his hands on her shoulders, and kissed her temple. He pulled back and met her gaze with eyes breaking with pain. \u201cThank you for giving him back to us.\u201d</p><p>His unspoken, for now hung in the air.</p><p>Delaney nodded, fighting back tears of her own. She wanted to rail at him for giving up, but she could see the pain in his eyes and knew he\u2019d be doing something if he could.</p><p>\u201cIs there anything I can do?\u201d Tighe asked his chief.</p><p>Lyon shook his head slowly. \u201cKougar and Hawke are searching for any ancient spell they might have missed. The others are chasing fires in hopes of catching the clone that way. I\u2019m afraid one more person isn\u2019t going to be of a lot of use.\u201d</p><p>Lyon put his hand on Tighe\u2019s shoulder. \u201cIf you want my advice, get something to eat and spend some time with your mate. Not necessarily in that order.\u201d His gaze swung to her, respect sharp in his eyes. \u201cHuman or not, she\u2019s a hell of a woman.\u201d He turned and started back down the tunnel.</p><p>Kougar came over to them and clasped Tighe\u2019s shoulder. \u201cNever give up.\u201d His enigmatic gaze swung slowly to her. \u201cWorthy,\u201d he murmured, with a single nod of the head, then turned and followed Lyon.</p><p>Tighe\u2019s hand squeezed her arm. \u201cWas I hallucinating, or did Kougar just call you worthy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou tell me.\u201d</p><p>She felt the stiffness enter his muscles a second before he released her, gripped her shoulders, and turned her to face him. His eyes took on a light she wasn\u2019t sure she liked. \u201cWhat did you do?\u201d</p><p>Delaney stared at him, her brows drawing together. \u201cYou know what I did. I led you out of the dark, just as you did me.\u201d</p><p>His hands tightened on her shoulders until his grip was almost painful. \u201cI could have killed you.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him, her temper flaring. \u201cWell, you\u2019re welcome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean it,\u201d he growled. \u201cDon\u2019t ever do something like that again.\u201d</p><p>She kicked him in the shin with her bare toes. \u201cTwice you risked everything to find me. Twice. Don\u2019t you dare get on my ass about helping you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m immortal. You\u2019re human!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs everyone keeps reminding me! I\u2019m made of flesh and blood, not soap bubbles. I might not heal as fast as you do, but I do heal. Don\u2019t try to lock me away to protect me, Tighe. I won\u2019t have it.\u201d</p><p>She stilled, her words hanging in the air. She\u2019d yelled at him about what not to do the next time, but it didn\u2019t look like there was going to be a next time.</p><p>\u201cOh, Tighe.\u201d Her eyes filled with tears.</p><p>With a growl, Tighe hauled her into his arms, burying his face in her hair with a shudder that shook the entirety of his big body. For long, long minutes he held her like that, shudders rocking him at regular intervals, while she clamped her arms around him and held him tight.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not mad at you, D. It\u2019s not you, though goddess, when I think of what I could have done to you like that...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was so scared I wouldn\u2019t be able to reach you.\u201d Her voice broke. \u201cI don\u2019t want to lose you.\u201d</p><p>The tears got away from her, and Tighe held her as she cried, stroking her back and running his hand over her hair.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t cry, D. Kougar and Hawke will come up with something. We\u2019ll beat that bloodless sucker, yet.\u201d</p><p>But there was no real belief in his tone. Nothing but bleak despair.</p><p>When she got control, he pulled back until he could see her face, then cupped her cheek in his warm palm. \u201cAre you really okay? I had a vision, D. I saw him stripping you, tying you down. Touching you.\u201d</p><p>His words brought back that nightmare. Delaney shivered, the chills rippling over her skin.</p><p>Tighe pulled her against him, cradling her head. \u201cI\u2019ve never felt so helpless in my life. You were right there, and I couldn\u2019t help you. I couldn\u2019t reach you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay. I knew you\u2019d come for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways.\u201d</p><p>But always spoke of a future they didn\u2019t have.</p><p>How could this be it? How could this man, whom she\u2019d just found, whom she loved, be dying? The weight of her grief was almost more than she could bear.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-six</p><p>Tighe held Delaney in his arms, deep in the bowels of Feral House, his heart filling with a pressure he wasn\u2019t sure he\u2019d survive even if they did manage to kill his clone in time.</p><p>Was this love? He\u2019d thought he\u2019d been in love once before, but now he wondered.</p><p>Was this what real love felt like? This feeling that he couldn\u2019t breathe? The certainty that before he\u2019d found her he\u2019d never breathed? Never lived? And now he might only have hours.</p><p>Hours.</p><p>The knowledge echoed through his mind like the death knell it was. For the first time in his long, long life he faced true death. There had been threats to his life before, certainly. Mage battles. Draden attacks that for short periods of time had gone south. But he\u2019d always known he\u2019d prevail. And he always had.</p><p>He was immortal.</p><p>Face-to-face, he\u2019d be able to defeat the clone, he was sure of it. But his enemy fought from the shadows and behind the faces of the people he loved.</p><p>This time he might well lose.</p><p>The worst part was, for the first time since he was marked all those centuries ago, he had a strong reason to live. To watch over Delaney as she lived her life. To do whatever he could to make her short years safer, richer, even if she insisted on returning to her own world with no memory of him. He\u2019d visit her in his cat form, then once she was asleep, he\u2019d cloud her mind and hold her. She wouldn\u2019t be lonely. He\u2019d make certain she was never lonely.</p><p>Slowly he pulled back, framing her face as he clung to her gaze, reassuring himself she was really in his arms, shaken anew by how scared he\u2019d been that he\u2019d never hold her like this again. Emotion caught in the back of his throat, burning a line all the way to his eyes. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGoddess, D, when I realized you were missing, I nearly died.\u201d A shudder wracked his body. \u201cWhen I finally figured out where you were, I heard you scream. I thought I was too late.\u201d</p><p>She brushed her cheek against his chest. \u201cHe touched my head with his hands. It felt like he poured acid in me. I really thought he\u2019d planted something in me, but the Shaman couldn\u2019t find anything but shadows.\u201d</p><p>He slid his hands in her hair and pulled back to meet her gaze. \u201cBut you\u2019re all right?\u201d</p> <p>Her eyes filled with pain as she looked at him, but it was a pain not of the flesh. Grief, plain and simple.</p><p>He kissed her softly, reverently, drinking in the feel of her. The taste. Memorizing her sweet lips, so warm, so soft and precious. If all he had left was a few hours, he\u2019d spend them like this. With her.</p><p>Tighe pulled away, then swung her into his arms, startling a quick gasp from her. \u201cI need to make love to you, D.\u201d</p><p>Delaney hooked her arm around his neck and pressed her lips to his cheek. \u201cI need to make love to you, too.\u201d</p><p>A pleased growl rumbled in his chest. \u201cI need a shower first. I must stink like five-day-old garbage.\u201d</p> <p>She shuddered. \u201cI think my sense of smell has been permanently burned away.\u201d</p><p>Her words made his chest ache, and he remembered that kitchen, that smell, and could only guess what a horrifying experience that had been for her. His grip on her tightened, and he pressed his head gently to hers as he carried her, safe in his arms at last.</p><p>He took her back through the gym and into the open shower at the back, where he lowered her slowly to her feet. Kissing her briefly, he turned on one of the showers and began stripping.</p><p>Delaney did the same, lifting the soft pajama shirt to expose her beautiful breasts.</p><p>\u201cNot here, sweetheart,\u201d Tighe said softly. \u201cThere\u2019s someplace else I want to make love to you. I\u2019ll only be a minute.\u201d</p><p>Delaney managed a sad smile. \u201cI need a shower as badly as you do. Probably worse, considering where I\u2019ve been.\u201d</p> <p>He stared at her, understanding dawning slowly. \u201cIs there a reason you didn\u2019t shower the past two days?\u201d</p><p>She pulled off her pajama bottoms and tossed them on the bench. \u201cI was out of it as long as you were, though not quite in the same way. The moment I woke up, I came for you, Tighe. The moment.\u201d Her gaze met his, her eyes filled with a silken strength and a tenderness that made him ache with love.</p><p>He pulled her into his arms and kissed her fiercely, tenderly, telling her silently what was in his heart. But the slide of her nakedness against his had his body revving, his eyes changing. If he didn\u2019t put distance between them soon, it would be over here and now. And this was not where he meant to make love to her.</p><p>\u201cQuick shower, D.\u201d He forced himself to release her and turned on a second of the four showerheads. He didn\u2019t dare try to stand that close to her right now.</p><p>As Delaney stood watching him, she cocked her head. \u201cAre you really going to take a shower with your sunglasses on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got to be kidding.\u201d</p><p>Her disbelief annoyed him. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason I wear them, D. It\u2019s important.\u201d</p> <p>But as he watched her, an aching hurt entered her eyes. \u201cAll we\u2019ve been through together, knowing we could almost be out of time, and you\u2019re still going to hide from me?\u201d</p><p>A fist clenched inside his chest. \u201cYou don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen tell me.\u201d</p><p>He stared at her, feeling trapped. She didn\u2019t understand. She couldn\u2019t possibly understand. Yet everything she\u2019d said was true. And, goddess, but he loved her. He could bare himself for her, couldn\u2019t he?</p><p>He lifted his hands and dropped them again. \u201cIt\u2019s because my eyes go feral whenever I\u2019m attracted to a woman.\u201d</p><p>She gave him a look that said she clearly thought he was an idiot. \u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, they turn into tiger\u2019s eyes. They\u2019d scare the shit out of you.\u201d</p><p>She fisted her hands on her bare, slender hips. \u201cYou\u2019re kidding, right? Have you forgotten I was the one who got you out of there? I stared into your tiger eyes for what seemed like forever, Tighe, and yes, I was scared. You were snarling and snapping, trying to bite my hand off, but the thing that scared me the most was that I wasn\u2019t going to be able to reach you.\u201d</p><p>With a growl, he stepped under the hot spray of the nearest shower and tipped his head back as that fist in his chest tightened. He heard her move, then felt her arms slide around him as she pressed her cheek against his chest.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t scare me, Tighe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou like kissing monsters?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake off the sunglasses, shape-shifter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDammit. Can\u2019t you just leave it alone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>In a fit of anger, he pulled off his shades and tossed them onto the floor. As much as he wanted to stare down at her with his animal eyes, he couldn\u2019t bring himself to do it. He couldn\u2019t stand to see her own eyes change, fear filling their depths.</p><p>Delaney\u2019s fingers curved around his jaw and with a feather-light touch, made him look at her. \u201cWhy did you use the word monster?\u201d</p><p>He forced himself to meet her gaze, bracing for her reaction. But she just continued to look at him like she always did. \u201cIt\u2019s just a word, D. Animal, Feral, monster. It\u2019s just a word.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head even as she watched him with eyes warm and understanding, an understanding he wasn\u2019t sure he could handle.</p><p>Lifting her hand, she pressed her palm to his cheek. \u201cI love your eyes, Tighe. Because when I look into them, I see you. Even when you were in that feral state, the moment you came back to me, I saw you. Your fierce strength and gentle protectiveness. Your courage and honor and determination. Whether your eyes look like a man\u2019s or a tiger\u2019s, I see you.\u201d</p><p>He tore his gaze from hers and looked up at the ceiling. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>She released a soft snort. \u201cThanks? Tighe, for heaven\u2019s sake, you\u2019re an amazing creation. Rare, powerful. Beautiful. In all your forms.\u201d</p><p>He heard her words, but the fist inside his chest only pinched harder. \u201cYou don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cObviously not.\u201d</p><p>Her soft palm slid across his chest. \u201cTell me. Help me understand. If you give me just one last gift, make it this.\u201d</p><p>He groaned. \u201cYou don\u2019t fight fair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t always win with fair.\u201d Her soft mouth brushed his arm in a sweet kiss. \u201cI want to understand you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me finish my shower, first.\u201d He needed space. Because she was getting too close. She was digging too deep.</p><p>Delaney sighed, her eyes frustrated and sad. \u201cOkay.\u201d She moved to the other shower and picked up a bottle of flowery shampoo Kara must have left down there.</p><p>He washed thoroughly, scraping his skin raw, lost in feelings and thoughts he didn\u2019t know how to explain. Things he didn\u2019t want to explain even if he knew how. But Delaney\u2019s presence, the solidity of her acceptance, grabbed hold of him and wouldn\u2019t let him go.</p><p>He\u2019d give her the sun and the moon if he could. He supposed he could try to explain what he didn\u2019t entirely understand himself. And if he was going to do it, it had to be tonight.</p><p>With a sigh, he turned off the water, wrapped a towel around his waist, and sat on one of the benches, tipping his head against the wall behind him as she finished her shower. His gaze fastened on the rocklike tile of the wall across from him as his mind looked inward.</p><p>\u201cI love living here, D, fighting beside these men. And when I shift into my tiger, it\u2019s a rush unlike anything you can imagine. But I swear, I swear not a day goes by that I don\u2019t think about how I\u2019d give it up...\u201d He shook his head. \u201cI\u2019d give it up...\u201d</p><p>The words burned in his throat.</p><p>Delaney joined him, wrapping a towel around her dripping body as she sat down beside him. Her fingers stroked his damp arm. \u201cFor what, Tighe?\u201d</p><p>Pulling her against him, he struggled to find the words for a longing he\u2019d never given voice to.</p><p>His voice shook. \u201cTo hold my daughter again.\u201d</p><p>Delaney started. He tasted her surprise. But all she did was press her head against his shoulder. \u201cTell me about her.\u201d</p><p>Where to begin? But as he clung to her, the words poured out.</p><p>\u201cShe was precious. Perfect. Her name was Amalie, and the last time I saw her she was five, with dimples like mine and a cloud of golden curls that she\u2019d flick back from her face as she ran from one discovery to the next. She had a quick mind and an insatiable curiosity, and from the moment she learned to speak, all she did was ask questions. Why do the clouds move? Why don\u2019t all butterflies wear the same colored wings? Why did her cuts take days to heal and mine only seconds?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was mortal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. My wife, Gretchen, was human. The children of such unions can be either, but Amalie was mortal.\u201d</p><p>His eyes fogged, a lump forming in his throat. Goddess, but he missed her.</p><p>\u201cTell me about Gretchen.\u201d</p><p>Swallowing back the emotion, he forced himself to push past the anger that thoughts of her always brought and think about the girl she\u2019d been. For the first time in centuries, he thought of the girl he\u2019d fallen in love with all those years ago.</p><p>\u201cI met her when I was fifteen. She was a year younger, but I knew I was going to marry her. From the first day I saw her, I loved her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere did you meet her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe both wound up with the same foster father. I grew up in a Therian village in Denmark. When I was nine, my mother had a premonition of a Mage attack. The Mage in that area, at that time, were trying to wipe out the Therians.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA superiority thing we\u2019ve suffered from the dawn of time. One of the women in our village had married a human a few years before, so my mother took me to her and asked her to let me stay there for a while. She promised she\u2019d come back for me as soon as it was safe.\u201d</p><p>Delaney\u2019s soft hand stroked his chest. \u201cShe didn\u2019t come back, did she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. A few months later, the woman I was living with died of a mysterious illness. She was Therian, so of course it was no illness. It had to have been Mage magic of some kind. I was too young to understand fully what was going on, but I had a feeling...I knew my mother would never come back for me. So I lived with the human, Anders, and his young son, helping with the farm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he know what you were? That you were immortal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was never really sure. In hindsight, no. He couldn\u2019t have known. When I was fifteen, his fourteen-year-old niece came to live with us. Gretchen. She was...incorrigible. Full of mischief and laughter, and I fell head over heels in love with her. Three years later, we married. Amalie was born a year after that.\u201d</p><p>A soft kiss brushed his shoulder. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>He looked down at her dark head and lifted his hand to touch the cool sleekness of her hair. \u201cWhy are you so sure something happened?\u201d</p><p>She lifted her head to meet his gaze, her heart in her eyes, and he knew she felt the pain in his chest. So he told her.</p><p>\u201cI was marked by the goddess to be the next Feral Warrior.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened. \u201cLiterally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes and no. By the goddess, I mean Nature. There\u2019s not a real woman or anything. But the marking is literal.\u201d He touched the four claw marks that scored his right nipple. \u201cI woke up to these after a hell of a dream I can\u2019t remember. I kind of knew what they meant. I\u2019d heard of the Feral Warriors and how they were marked, but I\u2019d never seen one. That night, as we got ready for bed, I wanted to make love to my wife.\u201d</p><p>Delaney\u2019s breath sucked in audibly. \u201cYour eyes changed.\u201d</p><p>Tighe nodded, the old pain driving a stake through his heart. \u201cShe screamed.\u201d He looked across the shower, his sight caught far in the past. \u201cI thought she saw something behind me, something threatening my family. That emotional rush turned me completely feral. Not crazy, like you\u2019ve seen me, but still feral. I was horrified as claws unsheathed from my fingers, and fangs grew in my mouth. She ran from me. She ran from our cottage screaming for help, yelling that there was a demon in her home. The villagers attacked me, hacking at me with knives and axes. If I\u2019d been human, I\u2019d have died. I managed to get back in my skin\u2014back in my human form\u2014and tried to explain, but they weren\u2019t listening. I had no choice but to run that night.</p><p>\u201cThe next morning, I snuck back into the village. I had to talk to Gretchen. I knew she loved me. If I could just explain, everything would be okay. But the moment she saw me, her eyes filled with such terror. Such terror, D.\u201d</p><p>Delaney looked up at him, and he met her gaze as she reached for his hand. \u201cThat\u2019s why my terror sets you off, isn\u2019t it? It\u2019s that memory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably. I was furious with her, but mostly...I hurt, D. She\u2019d betrayed me. Betrayed everything we\u2019d meant to one another. She started screaming again and ran from me, and I let her go. I understood it was never going to be okay. But as I left my house, my home, and started back through the garden, I heard Amalie. I turned around to find her running toward me. Toward me. She was crying for me. Gretchen\u2019s uncle snatched her up as the other villagers armed themselves, ready to drive me away a second time. All the while Amalie kicked and screamed, reaching for me, the tears streaming down her face.\u201d He covered his eyes against the burning that wouldn\u2019t stop. \u201cI turned and walked away. I turned my back on her, D. I never saw her again.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cTighe.\u201d He felt Delaney\u2019s strong arms go around his waist and her damp head press against his chest. \u201cThere was nothing else you could have done. Nothing. She knew you loved her,\u201d she added softly.</p><p>His arms went around her and held fast. \u201cDid she? I never went back. A newly marked Feral starts to feel a pull, a need for radiance that will eventually lead him to Feral House, but it took me nearly a year and a half to find it, up in the Highlands of Scotland. Not long after I arrived, Lyon moved us to Ireland because of all the problems with the Mage. I immersed myself in my new life, shutting out the pain of the old. We were engaged in constant battle with the Mage, and after a time, we moved to Spain, and finally across the ocean to come here.</p><p>\u201cThe first time I considered trying to go back, we were discussing leaving for the New World. I needed to see Amalie again. Just one more time. It seems ridiculous, maybe, but I still thought of her as five. In my mind, she\u2019d stayed five all those years. When you never age, when no one around you ever ages, you tend to forget that others do. And it\u2019s all too easy to lose track of time. I finally stopped and did the math and realized nearly a hundred and twenty years had passed. My little Amalie was long gone. I don\u2019t know if she lived another year after I left her, or another hundred. When I pulled that child from the fire, all I could think, all I could wonder was how many times my own daughter had needed me that I wasn\u2019t there to protect her.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Tighe.\u201d Delaney held him, stroking his back, until the shudders left him, and the memories uncurled from his heart.</p><p>\u201cIt was a long time ago,\u201d he said, finally feeling like he could breathe again.</p><p>Delaney straightened and met his gaze. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for you, but I\u2019m sorry for them, too. Poor Gretchen. She\u2019d probably never heard of Therians, let alone Feral Warriors. All she knew was stories of demons and devils and bad things. Your changing like that would have scared the crap out of anyone.\u201d</p><p>She ran gentle fingers through his hair, holding him with her gaze. \u201cDon\u2019t blame her, Tighe. It wasn\u2019t her fault.\u201d Leaning forward, she laid a feather-light kiss upon the corner of his mouth. \u201cBut it wasn\u2019t your fault either.\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cI tried to forget. I had to forget. But not a day goes by that my traitorous eyes don\u2019t remind me what I am.\u201d</p> <p>A soft hand stroked his cheek. \u201cI love what you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw your eyes, D. When I went feral.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yeah. Under the circumstances, I had reason to be afraid. But, for heaven\u2019s sake, Tighe, it\u2019s your own fault you scare us humans. You guys are so damned secretive, no one knows you even exist. So of course we\u2019re shocked when you suddenly do something no human can do. But now that I know, I\u2019m not afraid. Unless you go feral again. Then all bets are off.\u201d</p><p>He marveled at her courage. Even then, even when he\u2019d been lost in that chaos, she\u2019d pulled him out. She\u2019d faced the worst he had to give and not run.</p><p>\u201cTurn into a tiger for me, Tighe.\u201d</p><p>He stared at her. \u201cNow?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRight now. I want to see you shift when I can pay attention. When I can touch you.\u201d Her expression changed, turning guarded. \u201cAre you dangerous when you shift? When you\u2019re a tiger? I mean, to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s still me in either form. Even in the feral form, I\u2019d never hurt you if I weren\u2019t handicapped by half a soul.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen do it, Tighe. Shift for me. Please?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDelaney...\u201d He shook his head. \u201cYou don\u2019t want this. Like you said, you\u2019re not used to this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, but what I said was, I didn\u2019t understand it the first time. You looked damned dangerous and, as it turned out, you were. It\u2019s different now. I understand what you\u2019re doing. And I want to see it happen when I can really watch. I\u2019ve never touched a tiger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you get scared, there\u2019s no telling what will happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen don\u2019t do anything without warning me. No pretending to bite my head off or anything.\u201d</p><p>This was not a good idea. What if Delaney didn\u2019t handle his shift as well as she thought she would? If she got scared, he could lose it again. He could kill her this time.</p> <p>Even if he didn\u2019t lose it, could she really accept an animal as her mate?</p><p>But in her eyes he saw such certainty. Such strength. And she wanted to see him shift. She wanted to. Wasn\u2019t that all he\u2019d wanted from Gretchen? To be given a chance to explain?</p><p>He could give Delaney that. What she wanted. What they both wanted.</p><p>All he had to do was trust her to handle it.</p><p>Deep in his heart, he did.</p><p>Delaney\u2019s pulse raced with excitement as Tighe rose to his feet and led her into the gym.</p><p>\u201cStay here.\u201d Tighe backed into the middle of the room, giving himself room, and her space.</p><p>Then, as she watched, the man she loved disappeared in a breath-catching shimmer of colored lights. A second later a huge, gorgeous tiger stood in the place where he\u2019d been. The very tiger she\u2019d seen for such a brief moment before.</p><p>Delaney\u2019s heart pounded. Staring at the beautiful, deadly creature, adrenaline shot through her system, instincts bred over eons of human evolution warning her to run.</p><p>But she didn\u2019t. Because the dangerous animal wouldn\u2019t hurt her.</p><p>A tiny smile played around her mouth as her hand went to her chest. \u201cMy heart\u2019s racing, Tighe. But it\u2019s not from fear. Not much, anyway. This is so beyond incredible. Can you hear me?\u201d</p><p>Of course. His voice sounded in her head. Do you think tigers can\u2019t hear?</p><p>Her eyes went wide. \u201cDid you really just say that?\u201d</p><p>D...</p><p>\u201cNod.\u201d</p><p>He bobbed his head. I feel just like one of those damned dolls sitting in the back of a car window.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t tell me you could talk in my head.\u201d</p><p>Telepathic communication is possible between shifted Ferals and whomever they choose. Very convenient when we\u2019re on the hunt.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bet.\u201d She took a step toward him, her pulse leaping. \u201cYou don\u2019t mind if I touch you, do you?\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s nothing I\u2019d enjoy more.</p><p>But she hesitated, her cavewoman instincts screeching that he\u2019d tear her limb from limb. She took another step, caught her breath on a laugh, then walked slowly, cautiously to the amazing creature. But as she reached for him, as her fingers slid into his fur, a low growl rumbled from his throat.</p><p>Delaney snatched back her hand. \u201cYou said you didn\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>Sorry. I guess...I expected you to be a little more afraid. It\u2019s happened before.</p><p>To Tighe\u2019s surprise, she made a sound of disgust and, with no hesitation, wrapped her arms around his tiger\u2019s thick neck. \u201cGretchen would have accepted you, you know.\u201d She rubbed her cheek against his ruff. \u201cIf the situation had been different. If you\u2019d been alone and able to discover your changes together.\u201d</p><p>Her words slid into him like warm syrup, filling the holes inside him, erasing the cold.</p><p>\u201cI imagine the whole thing scared you nearly as much as it did her.\u201d</p><p>Yes. It probably did. I didn\u2019t actually shift until much later, after I reached Feral House, nor did I have a mirror to see myself. But I could see my claws and feel the fangs. I wasn\u2019t at all sure what was happening to me.</p><p>\u201cIt was a tragic set of circumstances all the way around, Tighe. But she loved you. Up until that day, you\u2019d never doubted her, had you?\u201d</p><p>Never. That\u2019s why her betrayal cut so deep.</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t betray you. She didn\u2019t understand what was going on. Her uncle and the other villagers were simply trying to protect themselves and their families from a creature they couldn\u2019t comprehend. You\u2019d have done the same, Tighe. With Amalie at your side, you wouldn\u2019t have taken any chances. You\u2019d have attacked first and asked questions later.\u201d</p><p>With a deep mental sigh, he knew she was right.</p><p>Thanks, brown eyes. I\u2019m seeing that day in a different light. A brighter light. I\u2019ve been blaming Gretchen, blaming humans all these years. For their fears. For their close-mindedness. Perhaps unfairly.</p><p>Delaney released him and rose to walk around him, sliding her fingers through his fur from the base of his neck to his tailbone. She moved behind him and brushed her fingers along him as she returned to his head. Then she knelt in front of him, her fingers sliding through his ruff. Her eyes sparkled with excitement even as they flowed with a depth and clarity he\u2019d rarely seen in any eyes, human or Therian.</p><p>\u201cCan you taste my emotions in this form?\u201d</p><p>Not as well, but yes.</p><p>\u201cAm I afraid?\u201d</p><p>I hear your heart pounding like it\u2019s about to take flight.</p><p>\u201cBut am I afraid?\u201d</p><p>No.</p><p>\u201cRight answer. I\u2019m...awestruck, Tighe. Exhilarated. Completely enchanted. I have goose bumps because I\u2019m staring into the eyes of one of the most beautiful, powerful, dangerous creatures on this planet, and in his eyes I see the man I adore.\u201d Her eyes gleamed with emotion. Softly, she added, \u201cI see the man I love.\u201d</p><p>Harsh joy barreled through him, taking down his heart in a single blow.</p><p>Brown eyes. I need to hold you. Step back.</p><p>When she did, he shifted back into a man, then stood and swept her into his arms. His mouth covered hers, and he kissed her, tasting the truth of her words in the passion of her lips and the tenderness of her fingers in his hair. Hearing it in the beat of her heart. A heart beating in time with his own.</p><p>Goddess, but he loved her.</p><p>Finally, he pulled back to look down into her face. \u201cYou\u2019re really not put off by all this?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes shone with love, her mouth forming the most beautiful smile he\u2019d ever seen. His chest tightened until he thought it would burst.</p><p>She cupped his man\u2019s face as she had his tiger\u2019s. \u201cPut off is about as far from what I\u2019m feeling as you can get.\u201d Her thumb moved to trace his lip. He nipped her lightly with his human teeth, stroking her thumb with his tongue.</p><p>Then he kissed her again with all the tangled emotion trapped in his heart. Her words had soaked deep inside him, healing wounds he\u2019d lived with for hundreds of years, shattering walls and defenses he hadn\u2019t even realized he\u2019d built against a pain he didn\u2019t think he\u2019d survive twice. A pain he finally understood and perhaps, at last, could relinquish.</p><p>In what might just turn out to be the last hours of his life.</p><p>With an aching heart, he pulled back from the kiss and stared into Delaney\u2019s precious face, into eyes he could drown in. Then he swept her into his arms and strode with her through the gym, out into the hall, and into the ritual room.</p><p>Delaney\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cWhat are we doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat I should have done the first time.\u201d</p><p>Deep inside him, the tiger gave a savage roar.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-seven</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to try to marry me, are you?\u201d Delaney hooked one arm around Tighe\u2019s neck, holding tight to her towel with the other, as he carried her into the dark ritual room. With his elbow he flipped a switch and lit the pair of electric sconces that filled the room with a golden glow.</p><p>She didn\u2019t want this, did she? He wasn\u2019t thinking clearly.</p><p>\u201cTighe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHush, D.\u201d He carried her to the wide, cushioned altar that stood on the far side of the room and deposited her in the middle.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think this is a good idea.\u201d She grabbed hold as he pushed the altar, with her on top, into the middle of the room.</p><p>Tighe yanked off his towel and tossed it aside as he strode to a small shelf on the wall and grabbed something. A lighter, she realized as he squatted and lit one of the ceremonial fires that had burned during their mating ceremony.</p><p>\u201cCan we at least discuss this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>With a huff of frustration, she climbed off the altar, pulled her towel tight, and followed him to the second fire.</p><p>\u201cTighe, you have nothing to gain from this and too much to lose.\u201d</p><p>He lit the fire, then moved to the third. \u201cTake off your towel, D.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you even listening to me? If they get the clone, you\u2019ll be bound to me when you know I can\u2019t stay.\u201d</p><p>He rose from lighting the third fire and turned to her, taking hold of her shoulders. His eyes were the golden orange of the tiger, yet within those golden depths swam a sea of emotion and a will of steel.</p><p>He squeezed her shoulders gently. \u201cYou asked me to bare myself to you, to show you my eyes and open my past as one last gift to you. Now I\u2019m asking for one last gift from you. Don\u2019t fight me on this, D. It\u2019s too important to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut why? What difference does it make?\u201d</p><p>Releasing her, he lit the fourth and fifth fires before answering.</p><p>\u201cThe difference is, if I\u2019d bound myself to you in the first place, I would have heard your cries in my head when he first captured you. I would have been able to find you immediately. You wouldn\u2019t have had to endure...\u201d</p><p>Turning away, he lit the sixth and final fire, then turned off the sconces. Firelight danced on the walls, once more transforming the room into a cave of old and filling the room with whispers of magic.</p><p>Tighe ushered her back to the altar and tugged at her towel until she let go of it, then pulled it from her body. She grabbed hold of his shoulders as his hands spanned her waist, and he lifted her back onto the altar.</p><p>Stepping back, he began to chant the same odd sounds Kougar had during the mating ceremony. Three times, Tighe circled her, his powerful, naked body glowing in the firelight with strength and life, his armband gleaming.</p><p>Her gaze reveled in his raw, male beauty even as her heart clenched with the knowledge that he could be gone in a matter of hours. He could be dead. How would she live in a world without him? Any world? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Finally, he returned to her and came to stand before her. Taking her hands in his, he raised them to his mouth, one after the other, and kissed her knuckles.</p><p>\u201cYou asked why this is important to me.\u201d His eyes throbbed with emotion. \u201cBecause I love you, D.\u201d</p><p>Bittersweet happiness twisted through her misery. \u201cTighe.\u201d</p> <p>He lifted his hand and caressed her head. \u201cI love you. It\u2019s not going to hurt me to bind myself to you. Because I\u2019m bound, whether through ritual or the emotion in my heart, I\u2019m yours. Always. No matter how long that is.\u201d</p><p>The tears started down her cheeks. \u201cTighe, I love you, too.\u201d</p><p>His expression tightened into something close to pain. Cupping her face in his hands, he kissed her, the kiss shattering in its anguished tenderness.</p><p>The saltiness of her tears mixed with the sweet wildness of his taste as she kissed him back, running her fingers along the back of his neck and into his hair, holding on. Holding on.</p><p>Tighe pulled away. \u201cLie down, brown eyes.\u201d Their gazes met, and for one awful instant, she saw the clone in his eyes. Her heart stuttered.</p> <p>\u201cWhat is it, D? You\u2019re scared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s...I felt like he was here. Like he was watching me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe can\u2019t reach you here, sweetheart.\u201d But he swung away and went to retrieve a knife from the shelf where he\u2019d found the lighter. With a quick swipe, he slit open his palm. Bright red blood ran down his hand.</p><p>Delaney held out her hand, ready to do the same. Or at least, the human version of it.</p><p>Tighe shook his head as he grabbed one of the towels and wiped the blood off his hand. \u201cI would know the moment I looked in your eyes, D. I know you\u2019re not him.\u201d</p><p>Delaney frowned. \u201cI should have known. I shouldn\u2019t have had that moment of doubt either.\u201d</p> <p>His hands slid into her hair. \u201cThere\u2019s a difference, brown eyes. I look like him. Plus the fact, he terrorized you. It would be surprising if you didn\u2019t have moments like that.\u201d Stepping between her thighs, he pulled her against him and gently stroked her head. \u201cNow, lie down.\u201d</p><p>As he stepped back, she did as he asked, positioning herself in the middle of the platform. Tighe pulled himself up from the end. She spread her legs, and he knelt between them. But the memory of the last time she was naked in front of a man stabbed at her, and she froze.</p><p>Tighe shook his head, his expression unhappy. \u201cHe\u2019s not here, D. Don\u2019t let him be here. Not now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t help it. I can\u2019t forget.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, sweetheart. Maybe this is too soon.\u201d He sighed and moved as if to leave.</p><p>She reached for him. \u201cTighe, wait. I need you to help me forget. Touch me. With your warmth. With your love. Touch me everywhere and erase his cold touch. Please?\u201d</p><p>A small smile flashed shallow dimples. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing I want more, brown eyes. Nothing.\u201d He grasped her ankles gently with his warm, strong hands, touching. Caressing. Slowly, he worked his way up her calves and her thighs, his touch warm and tender and so very different from that other touch. His hands slid over her hips, skimming her abdomen to tenderly cover her breasts. \u201cLike this?\u201d</p><p>She smiled for him. \u201cYes. Exactly like this.\u201d</p> <p>He caressed her breasts, softly kneading and plucking until her breathing became slowly ragged. One hand left her breast to travel between her thighs.</p><p>But at the first stroke, she flinched. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cD. Look at me. Look into my eyes. He never looked at you with eyes like mine.\u201d</p><p>She stared into his golden tiger eyes and felt only warmth. Only love.</p><p>His warm fingers moved back to caress her inner thigh, sliding higher, one millimeter at a time, pulling her back to that place of heat and need.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to touch you, sweetheart. I\u2019m going to slide my finger into your honey. It\u2019s going to feel good, as it always does when I touch you. Because I love you.\u201d</p><p>His finger stroked her lightly, then pressed, warm and gentle, into her, so different from that last cold invasion.</p><p>She shuddered with revulsion at the memory, even as she lifted her hips, embracing the touch of the man she loved. He probed her slowly, with infinite gentleness, then quicker as she heated, as her body opened and wept for him. Over and over he slid his finger in and out until heat coursed through her, until desire raged through her veins, until she was rocking her hips, gasping with need.</p><p>Finally, he withdrew his finger and came to her, bracing himself on his arms, yet not entering her. Not yet.</p><p>His gaze held hers. He didn\u2019t have to tell her this time to watch him. His eyes were so tender, so full of love, she couldn\u2019t have looked away if she\u2019d wanted to.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Delaney Randall. I bind myself to you, heart and soul.\u201d As he began to chant, he slid deep inside her, stretching her, filling her, then out again, in rhythm with the ancient sounds coming from his throat. Her heart took up the beat until it pounded through her, lifting her in passion and excitement as if she were part of something beyond the body, beyond the earth, far beyond anything any human had ever known.</p><p>As he entered her over and over, she felt the warmth of a hundred angel wings brushing her mind. And saw the tiger lift his head to the skies with a roar of keen satisfaction.</p><p>A flicker of a smile lit Tighe\u2019s mouth as if he, too, felt the tiger watching. His eyes bored into her, holding her. Claiming her as he drove into her, driving her higher and higher, faster and faster, until the ritual pounded through her blood like ancient drums, lifting her, launching her...</p><p>As she stared into those beloved tiger eyes, she screamed with the roaring rush of pleasure, then gasped as Tighe\u2019s love rushed into her, embracing her like a tender warmth riding the wings of her soul, filling her with a fullness, a rightness, a completeness so perfect that chills raced over her skin and tears ran from her eyes.</p><p>She\u2019d thought binding would enslave her. Instead, for the first time in her life, she felt whole.</p><p>Tighe watched her with moisture in his own eyes. He kissed her, and the sweetness, the passion, exploded inside her a hundred times more brilliant than before as if she\u2019d been living life in two dimensions, two black-and-white dimensions, and through this ritual, he\u2019d lifted her into a stunning new existence.</p><p>She felt transformed. Reborn.</p><p>Tighe lifted his face and stared into her eyes with infinite tenderness. Infinite sadness.</p><p>And the beauty of the moment shattered in bittersweet shards of truth.</p><p>Tighe was dying.</p><p>And even if, by some miracle, he survived, they had no future together. They both knew it. She saw the knowledge in the sadness in his eyes.</p><p>He gathered her into his arms, and they held one another, clinging to a dream that couldn\u2019t last.</p><p>\u201cYou bound yourself to me,\u201d Delaney murmured, finally, against his collarbone.</p><p>With slow, lazy brushes of his warm palm, Tighe stroked her body. \u201cI did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow? There was no blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe previous ritual paired us. Opening myself to you, in this place, was the only thing left to do.\u201d His lips brushed her temple. \u201cIt was the most profound thing I\u2019ve ever done, brown eyes. The most perfect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never dreamed it would be like that. That it could be like that.\u201d</p><p>He brushed back her hair. \u201cYou\u2019re okay?\u201d</p><p>She shivered as his question brought back thoughts of the clone. \u201cYes. But, I swear, for a moment there I felt like he was watching me. For an awful moment, I felt like he was inside you, looking out.\u201d</p><p>Tighe stiffened. She felt the energy going through him like a lightning bolt.</p><p>\u201cD, that\u2019s it! We see through his eyes, right? What if he\u2019s seeing through mine?\u201d</p><p>Delaney froze. \u201cDo you mean visions? Like he\u2019s seeing us? Me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. We see him when he feeds. I have a hard time believing he\u2019s seeing me when I eat. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I like to eat, but there\u2019s nothing powerful about it for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said he loved me. And, Tighe, he knew my name. Just before he grabbed my head, he said my name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s getting the visions when I\u2019m with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith me?\u201d Delaney croaked. \u201cAs in...?\u201d</p><p>Tighe squeezed her shoulder. \u201cThink, D. Maybe this is why he stopped feeding on people directly and moved back to fires.\u201d</p><p>She gasped. \u201cOf course. He realized we were getting visions of him when he killed. We were going to be able to trap him if he kept it up.\u201d</p><p>His hand clenched her shoulder harder. \u201cI know when it happened. It was while we were driving around after the Lincoln Memorial murders. He was killing the babies. I stopped at the light and looked down at you and told you what he was doing. And where he was. He stopped midstep. He heard me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you weren\u2019t doing anything more profound than driving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWrong, sweetheart. I was looking into your eyes. And there\u2019s nothing more profound to me.\u201d</p><p>He sat up, then hopped off the altar and started pacing, studiously not looking at her. His hands raked into his hair. \u201cI was looking in your eyes the morning you told me you were going to meet Kara in the foyer. He showed up instead.\u201d</p><p>Delaney jumped off the altar and grabbed a towel. \u201cMaybe that\u2019s why he told me he loved me. Because he sees my feelings for you in my eyes. He\u2019s reacting to that emotion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly. I was looking into your eyes when I gave you the cell phone and told you it had a tracking system.\u201d</p><p>Delaney looked at him in astonishment even as he carefully kept his gaze averted. \u201cHow can you possibly remember all the times you looked into my eyes?\u201d</p><p>He circled behind her, then pulled her tight against him, his arm warm and comforting across her rib cage. \u201cBecause every time I look into your eyes, I feel like I\u2019m drowning. Like my feet are being swept out from under me. Looking into your eyes feeds my soul, D.\u201d</p><p>She covered his arms with her hands and held onto him as he held her. \u201cDoes that mean I can\u2019t look into your eyes anymore?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He squeezed her tight, and let out an excited whoop. \u201cIt means we may finally have a way to catch him.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-eight</p><p>Ten minutes later, Tighe paced the war room, adrenaline racing through his body on a riptide of hope. It might well knock his feet out from under him again, but for the moment, he had a chance at life, and that was all he could ask for.</p><p>Delaney sat at the big table, her back to him so they didn\u2019t accidentally make eye contact. At the table with her were Lyon, Kara, and Kougar. Jag and Wulfe were on their way and would be filled in later. Paenther and Foxx were still in the Blue Ridge. They only waited for Hawke.</p><p>As the warrior walked into the room, each man and woman pulled out a knife and cut his or her palm.</p><p>Lyon turned to Tighe, eyeing him with controlled excitement. \u201cTell them what you told me.\u201d</p><p>Tighe nodded and turned to the others, then explained how he and Delaney had figured out the clone was seeing through his eyes.</p><p>\u201cSo he\u2019s not seeing anything but Delaney?\u201d Hawke took his seat and leaned forward, his eyes flashing. \u201cBut he\u2019s hearing whatever\u2019s said during that time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Full sound visions, just as mine are.\u201d Tighe stopped and turned toward the table, his hands going to Delaney\u2019s shoulders, his gaze skipping from one Feral to the next. \u201cWe can use this to set him up. To set a trap.\u201d</p><p>Lyon\u2019s brows rose questioningly. \u201cDo we know what he wants?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe other half of Tighe\u2019s soul,\u201d Delaney said. \u201cHe told me he was going to use me to get it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he say how?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately, no.\u201d</p><p>Lyon\u2019s gaze swung to Hawke. \u201cAny clue?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone. All we know is he had her lying in a pentagram and he possesses at least some of the knowledge of the Daemons. His plan could be anything, but everything points to its involving either Delaney, or Tighe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo we\u2019re going to make it easy for him to catch us.\u201d Tighe waited until all eyes were back on him. \u201cWe\u2019ll pretend to be planning to trap him again.\u201d He looked at Kougar. \u201cOne of your Daemon traps. Something that requires all the Ferals to leave Feral House. I\u2019ll tell D I\u2019m staying here with her as long as I can, then tell her something went wrong, and I have to leave to help you. If I\u2019m his target, he\u2019ll have access to me when I cross the woods alone. If D is the target, he\u2019ll have her virtually unprotected in the house.\u201d</p><p>Lyon grunted. \u201cI\u2019m not leaving Kara unprotected, but the clone doesn\u2019t have to know that. And the rest of them will be in their animals, hidden, watching you two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe may not believe you\u2019d leave Delaney alone,\u201d Lyon said.</p><p>Delaney gave a soft snort. \u201cIf there\u2019s one thing he doesn\u2019t understand, it\u2019s love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow would he get into the house?\u201d Kara asked. \u201cThe doors are always locked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis life\u2019s on the line.\u201d Tighe kneaded Delaney\u2019s shoulders softly, gaining strength just from touching her. \u201cA locked house wouldn\u2019t stop me if I needed in. It won\u2019t stop him. He\u2019ll try. We\u2019ll stop him before he breaks in.\u201d</p><p>Lyon\u2019s gaze met his. \u201cIt\u2019s a long shot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe not, Roar,\u201d Hawke said. \u201cThe clone has to know he\u2019s dying, too. I\u2019m willing to bet he\u2019s already planning some kind of move. If he senses how close his soul is to crumbling, he\u2019s planning it tonight. By giving him our plans, or our supposed plans, we\u2019ll be giving him exactly what he wants.\u201d He nodded to Tighe. \u201cIt might work brilliantly.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIf we can pull off the acting job,\u201d Delaney said softly.</p><p>He squeezed her shoulders. \u201cWe\u2019ll do it. Midnight?\u201d he asked the others. When he received a round of nods he said, \u201cMidnight it is.\u201d Then he took Delaney\u2019s hand, careful not to meet her gaze. \u201cLet\u2019s go up to my room where we can concentrate.\u201d</p><p>A long shot, Lyon called it. And Tighe feared he was right. But it was the only shot they had. As he led Delaney from the room, his arm tight around her shoulders, apprehension knotted his gut. But it couldn\u2019t obliterate the hope that burned inside him.</p> <p>Because he still had a chance to come through this alive. Not a great one, perhaps, but a chance.</p><p>If he did survive the night, the next task on his agenda was convincing Delaney to stay in his world instead of going back to her own.</p><p>He pulled her close and kissed her hair. One challenge at a time.</p><p>\u201cYou ready?\u201d</p><p>Delaney shuddered, glad for Tighe\u2019s arms tight around her. They\u2019d gone over what they needed to say and practiced it five times, now. But the thought of actually doing it was setting butterflies to flight in her stomach even as it covered her skin in goose bumps.</p> <p>Because the goal was to let the clone see them. To let him see her. And the thought of bringing that evil presence into the room with them was making her ill.</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t be here, D. He\u2019ll just be watching.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you started to read my mind now?\u201d</p><p>His lips brushed her hair. \u201cNot your mind. I can feel your emotions as if they were my own. The nervousness. But also the aversion. And the fear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy fear doesn\u2019t bother you anymore?\u201d But it didn\u2019t. She could feel his emotions, too.</p><p>His hand ran slowly up and down her arm. \u201cAll these years, fear has reminded me of that time with Gretchen. You stole its power over me today, D.\u201d</p> <p>She tried to smile, but was too nervous to pull it off. \u201cI\u2019m glad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too. But enough stalling. We need to issue this invitation, or he won\u2019t make it in time. Then we\u2019re really screwed.\u201d</p><p>She took a deep breath, trying to disperse the ants crawling over her skin. \u201cOkay. Let\u2019s do it.\u201d</p><p>Slowly, he turned her around in his arms. She expected him to look into her eyes, to draw in the clone. But instead he kissed her, strengthening her even as he calmed her. Smart man, he pulled back before the kiss got out of control and stole all thoughts from her head. Including the ones she needed.</p><p>Running his palms over her cheeks, he stared into her eyes.</p><p>And she felt the clone.</p><p>Her heart started racing. Tighe\u2019s grip on her tightened.</p><p>\u201cD,\u201d he said softly. \u201cIt\u2019s me, sweetheart. I know every time you look at me, you see him.\u201d</p> <p>His words were a gentle reminder they were on camera. He\u2019d told her just to think of it as a television camera. And she was going to blow the plan completely if she didn\u2019t play it right.</p><p>She gazed into his eyes, opening her heart, feeling Tighe\u2019s love engulf her, calm her. Yet looking into those green eyes, badly streaked with black, her heart clenched as she was reminded of just how little time they had left. Of just how critical it was that she pull this off.</p><p>With a determination born of desperation, she gathered her wits and her thoughts. And said her lines with all the raw emotion in her heart.</p><p>\u201cWhat are we going to do, Tighe? How are we going to save you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKougar has a plan. He\u2019s figured out what went wrong with one of the Daemon traps he tried down by the river last night. He needs more Ferals, more power. Everyone\u2019s going at midnight tonight. Everyone but me.\u201d</p><p>She reached up, stroking his jaw. \u201cWhy not you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe never leave Feral House unprotected if we can help it. And with my soul deteriorating, my energy\u2019s the lowest right now. If it doesn\u2019t work without me, they\u2019ll call me, and I\u2019ll have to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnce they trap him, will they kill him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll bring him to me to kill. We\u2019re not sure how far the soul can travel, but we\u2019re taking no chances.\u201d</p><p>It was done. They\u2019d said all they had to say. But they hadn\u2019t discussed the last part, how to end the vision without simply turning away.</p><p>Tighe leaned in and kissed her, slowly at first, then with increasing passion, stealing the fear that lurked in her mind, stealing all thought. He pulled away, and without looking at her, tucked her head against him.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d he murmured softly.</p><p>\u201cAnd I you.\u201d</p><p>She wrapped her arms hard around him and prayed for a miracle. Prayed for Tighe\u2019s life to be spared so he could live another six hundred years, or another six thousand.</p><p>Even as she knew she could never be part of them. Even if she saved him, she\u2019d lose him.</p><p>Because she could never stay there with nothing to do, no purpose in life, growing old and wrinkled, watching her perpetually virile, perpetually young husband\u2019s interest in her die. No, she wouldn\u2019t be able to bear it. It was better to go back to her life, to the place she belonged, even if it meant feeling a hole in her chest where her heart used to be.</p><p>His world could never be hers.</p><p>Tighe pulled Delaney onto the bed with him and peeled off her clothes, then his own, needing to make love to her one more time. Every move was slow, unhurried. He wished those moments could last an eternity.</p><p>While she kept her eyes closed, afraid, he knew, of engaging the clone, he touched her, loved her, with infinite care. First with his hands, then his mouth, and finally with his body as she spread her thighs, and he sank deep into her heat, filling her. He felt their hearts engage in a sensual explosion of heat and love.</p><p>Her eyes flew open, widening.</p><p>\u201cThe bond,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>A look of amazement creased her passion-drugged features. \u201cIt\u2019s stronger than before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom what I\u2019ve heard, it\u2019ll grow even stronger over time.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes contracted with pain, with the reminder, he knew, that time was the one thing they might not have. She closed her eyes again.</p><p>\u201cLook at me, D.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook at me. It\u2019s your eyes that strengthen me.\u201d He slid into her again and again, slowly, loving her with his body. And with his mind, his heart. His soul.</p><p>Afterward, he pulled her into his arms and held her as the hour until midnight slowly counted down.</p><p>Tighe was sitting on his bed, watching Delaney strap on her ankle holster when a knock sounded on his door. It was ten to midnight.</p><p>Hawke opened the door and stuck his head in. \u201cWe\u2019re heading out. Give us twenty minutes.\u201d</p><p>Tighe nodded, rose, and went over to the man who\u2019d been a friend for well over a century. Understanding and deep friendship moved through Hawke\u2019s dark eyes as he met him halfway, embracing him hard.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll get him, buddy. This isn\u2019t the end.\u201d But despite the positive words, worry riddled his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI hope to hell you\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>Hawke left, with a nod to Delaney.</p><p>When she finished tying her boots, Delaney straightened, her gaze carefully not meeting his. \u201cI\u2019m ready to kick some Daemon ass.\u201d</p><p>He never tired of watching her, never failed to marvel at her strength and resiliency. She was a vision of beauty and power in the jeans and long-sleeved tee she\u2019d borrowed from Kara, the gun strapped boldly at her waist. She\u2019d twisted her damp hair into a knot at the back of her neck, accentuating the feminine shape of her head and the long, graceful line of her throat.</p><p>Goddess, but he loved her. \u201cYou know guns won\u2019t kill him.\u201d</p><p>A savage smile lifted her mouth. \u201cI\u2019m fully aware of that, sport. But when I\u2019m armed, I feel ready for anything. I could take on the world if I had to.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cJust maybe not this world.\u201d</p><p>Tighe chuckled.</p><p>Delaney scowled. \u201cI hate not being able to look at you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m drinking my fill of you, brown eyes.\u201d</p><p>He watched her gaze slide up his legs, lighting tiny fires along his skin as it went. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ve been a little too cautious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf that gaze of yours travels any higher, you may blow the whole operation, Agent Randall. You\u2019re going to make me forget everything. Everything but that sweet body of yours.\u201d</p><p>Her worry rolled over him, quieting the teasing. He went to her and took her in his arms, holding her, calming both of them as much as either could be calm when so much was at stake. If the clone didn\u2019t bite, what would they do?</p><p>Finally, he pulled away, again, careful not to meet her gaze. \u201cIt\u2019s time for act two.\u201d</p><p>With a deep sigh, Delaney nodded and preceded him out the door and down to the foyer, where Kara waited. Kara gave Delaney a big hug, then came to him, sliding her arms around him. He hugged her tight. As he held Kara, he asked, \u201cAre you ready, D?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs ready as I can get.\u201d</p><p>He released Kara, then turned to Delaney, took her into his arms, and stared deeply into her eyes, all the way to her heart. The warmth rushed into him. He nearly closed his eyes to drink the sweet intensity of her love, but he forced himself to hold her gaze.</p><p>Slowly, he repeated the second batch of lines they\u2019d rehearsed. \u201cI have to go, D. The trap isn\u2019t working. They need me to add my power to theirs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe careful, Tighe. I love you.\u201d The fear in her eyes was real. As was the love.</p><p>Pulling her into his arms, he kissed her thoroughly. When his mind told him it was time to pull away, to leave, as they\u2019d planned, his hands wouldn\u2019t let go. What if their plan failed? What if he never made it back to her before his soul was spent?</p><p>Goddess, but he needed just one more kiss. But then he\u2019d need another and another. With a massive force of will, he cupped her cheek and pulled away.</p><p>Tears glistened in her eyes. \u201cBe careful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways.\u201d Then he turned and left Feral House, stepping into the cool night wind.</p><p>As he ran across the circular drive at a slow jog, his body was tense and ready for the fight for his life. He just prayed he\u2019d timed this right, that the clone would come for him before the draden, before he had to shift. Prayed that he\u2019d come for him at all. Because if he didn\u2019t...</p><p>Tighe clenched his hands as he ran. He might have just held Delaney for the very last time.</p><p>Tighe? Hawke\u2019s voice rang in his head. Was there a part of this plan you didn\u2019t tell us about? The part where Delaney runs out of the house on her own?</p><p>Tighe slowed, his mind scrambling. No.</p><p>I\u2019ll get her.</p><p>Out of nowhere, a dark cloud of draden descended, blocking out the treetops. Shit. He was going to have to shift. As he transformed into his animal on a rush of power, Wulfe\u2019s curse rang in his head.</p><p>The damn draden are attacking the animals!</p><p>No sooner did Wulfe\u2019s words register than the draden bit right through his tiger\u2019s fur. Dammit. Just as they\u2019d attacked Hawke and Kougar by the Lincoln Memorial.</p><p>Tighe\u2019s blood went cold, understanding slamming him in one fell blow. It\u2019s the clone! The clone can control the draden. His heart clenched with fear, his mind screaming with pain. Goddess help her. He\u2019s controlling Delaney!</p><p>Chapter Twenty-nine</p><p>Tighe fought back the draden, gut clenching, terror pounding through his brain as he sent his heart outward, seeking Delaney.</p><p>A hundred times brighter than their old connection, the bond that bridged their hearts showed him the way. With draden clinging to him, he took off through the woods, following his sense of her, feeling her confusion and fear.</p><p>Goddess stone, he sent out to the other Ferals. He\u2019s taken her to the goddess stone.</p><p>We\u2019ll get there as fast as we can, Hawke said. We\u2019re fighting for our lives right now, buddy. The draden have got us good.</p><p>Abruptly, his tiger\u2019s vision went black. He careened to a stop, slamming shoulder first into a tree. Draden tore at his tiger\u2019s flesh, but the only pain he felt was in his heart and mind. Because he couldn\u2019t reach her. And the only reason he\u2019d be getting a vision was if the clone was about to feed.</p><p>Delaney\u2019s mind fought to draw her weapon, to fight, but her body remained still and trembling before the monster who wore Tighe\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cWhat have you done to me?\u201d She stood before him on a wide, flat rock high above the Potomac, the cool wind whipping at the loose tendrils of her hair.</p><p>As she\u2019d waited in the foyer of Feral House, armed and ready for whatever came, she\u2019d felt this sudden, inexplicable need to leave. At first, she\u2019d thought it had something to do with the strange new connection she had to Tighe and feared he\u2019d needed her, so she hadn\u2019t fought it. But the moment she was outside, her feet took off as if they had a mind of their own, and she\u2019d felt him. The clone. Controlling her.</p><p>Inside her.</p><p>He reached for her now, cupping her face in his hands, shooting cold through her body as his face took on an expression she\u2019d often seen on Tighe\u2019s. As if she were the most precious thing in the universe.</p><p>\u201cWhat have you done to me?\u201d she demanded a second time.</p><p>His mouth turned up in a smile that froze her from the inside out. \u201cI\u2019ve made you my channel key.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t know what he meant by that. And was pretty sure she didn\u2019t want to know.</p><p>\u201cI see the questions in your eyes, fair Delaney. A channel key is made by infecting a human with a bit of Daemon consciousness. And letting it grow.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him. \u201cYou\u2019re taking over my mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, just a small piece of your will. Enough to use you for the key\u2019s true purpose.\u201d</p><p>Her insides quivered with dread. \u201cWhich is?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A single, icy finger slid down the slope of her nose. \u201cTo open the channel to the dark power deep in the earth. Power I need in order to call the other half of my soul and to find the master of the witch who created me so that I might add my strength to those who work to free Satanan and the Daemons from the blade.\u201d</p><p>Her mind flared with denial. She wouldn\u2019t help him! \u201cYou can\u2019t free them from the blade. Only the Ferals can do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor a time, that was true. But the dark powers are amassing, and that time is gone.\u201d He stepped back and motioned to the rock behind her. \u201cBare your chest for me, Delaney, and lie down in the center of the pentagram.\u201d</p> <p>Her blood went cold. Her brain screamed with refusal. But her body obeyed. She tugged off the long-sleeved tee shirt, pulled off her bra, and lay on her back on the cold stone in the middle of the blue-painted star.</p><p>As she looked up at the glowing clouds against the dark sky, her mind and heart reached for Tighe. Pouring her love into that link, unable to hide her terror or her outrage that she was to be used as the instrument of his death and that she was powerless to stop it.</p><p>As the clone looked down at her, for a desperate moment, she thought Tighe had come. But then she saw the flash of a wicked blade and knew that the nightmare wasn\u2019t over at all. It was just beginning.</p><p>As the knife pierced her chest and began a downward slide, a scream launched through her head, echoing off the walls of her skull and tearing, like blades of ice, through her brain. But no sound left her mouth, no sound shattered her eardrums. The clone\u2019s control over her was total.</p><p>The knife slid down, then beneath each breast as if cutting a design in her flesh, engulfing her in a river of agony from which there was no escape. Blood ran down her sides. And the scream in her head went on, and on, and on.</p> <p>Tighe lifted his head and let out a ferocious roar of misery and fury.</p><p>Tighe? Lyon\u2019s voice.</p><p>Tighe knocked into another tree, stumbling through the woods, blind, blood caking his fur from the dradens\u2019 bites. He has her on the goddess stone. He intends to use her to access dark power. To steal my soul and help free Satanan.</p><p>Like hell. Can you reach her?</p><p>A wild rage ripped through his tiger\u2019s body, sending him thrashing through the trees. Not until I can free myself from this damned vision!</p><p>We\u2019ll converge there as fast as we can.</p> <p>Sweat ran with the blood, but he kept moving, following the sound of Delaney\u2019s terror.</p><p>He was cutting her.</p><p>He had to get out of the vision!</p><p>Quit feeding, shitbag. Let me get out of your head. But he watched as the knife carved...a pentagram. On her chest. He was going to be sick.</p><p>Breathe.</p><p>The vision suddenly disappeared in the same moment the draden took off. A weird frisson of energy pierced the air, but Tighe wasted no time wondering about it. He ran on all fours, parting the woods in a flash of orange fur.</p><p>Something\u2019s happening, Lyon said.</p><p>Tighe gave a ferocious roar. He\u2019s trying to raise the dark power. I\u2019m on my way to the goddess stone, now.</p> <p>As he raced through the forest to reach his heart, to save the woman he loved, he prayed he wasn\u2019t already too late.</p><p>Tighe reached the goddess stone at the same time as the other Ferals.</p><p>What the fuck? Jag said, still in his jaguar form.</p><p>As one, they stared at the goddess stone. Or at the spot they knew the goddess stone should be, because they sure as hell couldn\u2019t see it.</p><p>The draden swarmed the stone by the thousands, the millions.</p><p>And Delaney was there.</p><p>With a roar, Tighe leaped down the rocks on his tiger\u2019s paws, following the sound of the scream, Delaney\u2019s scream, flowing down the line that connected their hearts. He felt the others close behind him as he launched himself into the draden.</p><p>The collision knocked him back on his haunches as if he\u2019d run into a concrete wall.</p><p>What the hell? He should have gone through!</p><p>As he sprang to his tiger\u2019s paws, he saw the others picking themselves up, too.</p><p>Magic, Lyon said. Damn powerful magic.</p><p>I\u2019ll make it, Tighe growled. He had to make it. Delaney needed him.</p><p>Opening his mouth wide, he tried to grab the little suckers in his jaws, but his teeth scraped the surface of the magic and never touched the fiends themselves.</p><p>His frustration tore through the night on a furious roar. In a desperate move, he shifted to human, praying he\u2019d draw them out of the magic to attack him.</p><p>They didn\u2019t move. The draden wall remained solid.</p><p>\u201cDelaney!\u201d</p><p>His blood boiled even as his heart felt as if it had been shot through with ice. He had to reach her. He had to reach her!</p><p>With a rage born of desperation, he slammed his fist into the unnatural wall and felt it sink up to his elbow.</p><p>It worked.</p><p>But the pain and tearing had him instinctively yanking back, only to stare, disbelieving at what was left of his arm. Little more than shredded remnants of flesh clinging to the bone.</p><p>\u201cHoly shit,\u201d Jag murmured, taking human form. Then tried to slam his fist through, too, but his fist only bounced off as his jaguar\u2019s body had.</p><p>Lyon, Kougar, and Hawke, too, shifted and tried to punch through, but only Tighe was able to breach the wall.</p><p>Lyon\u2019s gaze met Tighe\u2019s. \u201cLooks like this is your fight.\u201d</p><p>Tighe nodded. As he dove headfirst into that feeding frenzy, he heard Lyon behind him.</p><p>\u201cKill the son of a bitch.\u201d</p><p>As he pushed through, inch by inch, he felt his flesh being devoured by savage mouths, his life force being sucked from his body. When he finally emerged onto the goddess stone, he stumbled, barely able to stand.</p><p>\u201cTighe.\u201d Delaney lay as he\u2019d seen her in the vision, but so much worse, her eyes tight with pain and despair, and horror at the sight he must be with his flesh nearly gone. Her own flesh was open, her blood spilling over the rock too fast for her to possibly be still alive and conscious.</p><p>Opening himself to her, he felt it. The dark hold the clone had on her, the talons gripped around her heart. It was all that was keeping her alive.</p><p>And in a shattering moment, he understood. The second the clone died, so too would Delaney.</p><p>His fury swung to the one responsible.</p><p>The clone stood a few feet away, his face and chest raised to the heavens like a man inhaling air...or power.</p><p>Tighe tried to shift into his tiger form, his stronger form, but he was too weak to do even that. So he did the only thing he could. He launched himself at the clone. And took a fist to the face that sent him reeling back into the wall of draden. The small bits of flesh that had started to regrow were chewed off before he could push himself out of the little monsters\u2019 grasp again.</p><p>The clone chuckled, grinning Tighe\u2019s grin. \u201cYou can\u2019t stop me, Feral. I\u2019m nearly through, and when I\u2019m done, you\u2019ll be dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll never get away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith my draden guard, who\u2019s going to stop me?\u201d</p><p>The Ferals would stop him. He prayed to the goddess they\u2019d be able to stop him. But he wasn\u2019t at all certain they could.</p><p>Tighe. Delaney\u2019s voice floated through his head, soft and weak. Come to me.</p><p>I\u2019m here, sweetheart.</p><p>No, my tiger. Come over here where I can touch you. I need to touch you.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t sure how she could even stand to look at him, let alone touch his decimated flesh. Though second by second his body regenerated, he still looked more ghoul than man.</p><p>Lowering his center of gravity to a fighter\u2019s stance, he began to circle the clone, inching his way toward Delaney until his feet were slick with her blood.</p><p>Brown eyes. Grief swept through him, swift and terrible. She was going to die, and there was nothing he could do to stop it. Sweetheart, I\u2019m sorry. I should have been there to stop you. To protect you.</p><p>We tried. It was a good plan.</p><p>Are you in terrible pain? He\u2019d been able to feel her pain initially, but either it had waned, or his own was blotting it out.</p><p>I feel nothing but my love for you, Tighe. I\u2019ll always love you. I\u2019ll always watch over you.</p><p>His heart cried with anguish. Don\u2019t give up, D. I\u2019m going to find a way to save you. I have to find a way to save you!</p><p>Another step, and he felt it, her too-cool fingers sliding around the bones of his shredded ankle.</p><p>I love you, Tighe. Her love flowed through him on a rush of warmth. The tiger spirit inside him stirred and raised his head. Strength began to flow once more through his body. She was pouring her love into him, making him strong. Healing him.</p><p>Brown eyes, I love you. More than life.</p><p>He felt her smile enfold him through the connection between their hearts.</p><p>Tiger! Delaney called softly. Help him.</p><p>The animal spirit inside him leaped to its feet. With a ferocious roar, he sent power rushing though Tighe\u2019s body. Perhaps power enough to shift. But enough to fight?</p><p>He wouldn\u2019t know until he tried.</p><p>Let go, D. Let go, sweetheart.</p><p>As her fingers fell away, he prayed to the goddess this worked, and pulled on the energy inside him to access his tiger form.</p><p>The lights flickered, then died, then flickered again as he fought to shift. He had to shift. Only in his tiger form could he possibly beat the man who had his own strength but who was whole and strong, as he wasn\u2019t.</p><p>Finally, finally, the transformation slid through his body, with none of the accompanying rush of joy. He\u2019d shifted. But the draden had taken too much from him.</p><p>The clone whipped out his dagger, the light of battle in his eyes.</p><p>Tighe\u2019s vision wavered. His heavy tiger\u2019s body lurched drunkenly, and he doubted he could rally the energy to ward off the clone\u2019s attack, let alone launch one of his own.</p><p>He had to. For Delaney, he had to.</p><p>He started forward on unsteady legs, watching as the clone lifted his dagger, ready to plunge it into his brain. A single stab wound wouldn\u2019t kill him, but in his weakened state, it might be all the shitbag needed to drive him to his knees, where he would cut out his heart. And no creature survived without a heart.</p><p>I love you, D.</p><p>Don\u2019t give up on us yet, Tighe. That small power boost from your lovely tiger spirit went both ways. I\u2019ve broken free of his hold. I can move again.</p><p>As the dagger began its deadly descent, Tighe bunched his hind legs, desperate to find the strength to ward off the attack. To protect Delaney.</p><p>The first explosion rang through his ears, sending him back on his haunches. Two more rang out, the clone\u2019s eye disintegrating, holes erupting in his face, before he understood what was happening.</p><p>Delaney. She\u2019d reached her gun. Round after round exploded into the clone\u2019s face.</p><p>Giving him a chance.</p><p>Tighe stumbled forward, grabbed the clone\u2019s bloodless leg between his powerful jaws and tore it off his body, sending the demon spawn crashing to the ground, his dagger skittering away. With another powerful bite, he tore off an arm and tossed it aside. Collapsing across the clone\u2019s broken body, he pulled off the other arm, then turned and gnawed off his second leg.</p><p>But the creature\u2019s heart remained. And his head.</p><p>Tighe\u2019s own heart cried out with the knowledge that destroying them meant destroying Delaney as well.</p><p>Tighe. Move me! Out of the pentagram. He\u2019s still sucking the power. He\u2019s still trying to steal your soul.</p><p>Rallying what little strength his body had managed to renew, he changed once more into a man, then stumbled to Delaney\u2019s side and knelt in her blood.</p><p>\u201cOh, D.\u201d Her skin was white as the clouds. As bloodless as the clone. With shaking hands, he scooped her up and into his arms, cradling her against him as he turned to his foe.</p><p>In a squawking frenzy, the draden took off, disappearing into the dark, as if suddenly released. The Ferals rushed onto the stone to surround him.</p><p>Delaney\u2019s head lolled over his arm, as she fell unconscious. But her heart continued to beat.</p><p>The clone met Tighe\u2019s gaze, his own face staring back at him. \u201cYou can kill me, Feral. You\u2019ll retrieve your soul. But you\u2019ll lose your heart. She\u2019s mine.\u201d He grinned, dimples flashing, evil gleaming from eyes almost completely covered in black shards.</p><p>Jag kicked the demon spawn in the head, but the clone just continued to grin.</p><p>Jag pulled out his knife. \u201cMind if I do the honors?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d Tighe growled. \u201cHe\u2019s right. He\u2019s tied himself to Delaney. When he dies, so will she.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTighe.\u201d Lyon\u2019s palm squeezed his shoulder, transmitting a fine tension. \u201cYou see his eyes? There\u2019s only a sliver of green left. Yours are the same. When that last bit of green goes, you die. You may only have minutes. We can\u2019t lose you.\u201d</p><p>His soul cried. Delaney must live.</p><p>Inside, his tiger paced and leaped, growling and snarling. With a jolt, he realized the spirit was trying to get his attention. He was trying to...</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s trying to pull my soul back through Delaney\u2019s body,\u201d he murmured. And suddenly he understood. Pulling the soul back through her might just undo that evil connection.</p><p>Tighe\u2019s gaze snapped to Lyon\u2019s. \u201cI need a power raising!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDone,\u201d Lyon barked. \u201cNow!\u201d</p><p>The tiger inside him gave a powerful roar, his approval flowing through Tighe like a warm river. They would raise the spirits of the beasts. And in doing so, empower the spirit of the tiger.</p><p>Please, goddess, let this work. Let her live.</p><p>Jag and Lyon were already naked from their shifting, as was Tighe from the decimation of his flesh. Kougar and Hawke yanked off their shirts.</p><p>Tighe\u2019s flesh was quickly reknitting and almost healed again.</p><p>Lyon helped Tighe hold Delaney as he handed Tighe a knife. Tighe sliced his chest, slapped his palm to the blood, and shoved his fist into the air. The men formed a circle around the clone on the broad, flat goddess stone, and, one by one, sliced their own chests, slapping their bloody palms on top of his. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Tighe began to chant. \u201cSpirits rise and join. Empower the beast beneath this moon.\u201d The others joined him, the rhythmic words weaving with his heartbeat and Delaney\u2019s, flowing around them, through them.</p><p>Thunder rumbled, the ground trembled as the great force of Mother Nature herself rose from the depths of the Earth, through the bodies of flesh and bone and up through their arms to the blood raised to the heavens.</p><p>\u201cEmpower the spirit of the tiger!\u201d Tighe shouted.</p> <p>A flash of lightning lit the sky, burning through the flesh of Tighe\u2019s hand, sending power twisting through his body.</p><p>His tiger told him what he had to do.</p><p>Cradling Delaney in his arms, he knelt before what was left of the clone and held his hand out to Lyon for the blade.</p><p>The clone looked up at him with cold eyes. \u201cThe Daemons will rise again,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>Tighe lifted the knife over the clone\u2019s heart. \u201cYou won\u2019t be alive to know, will you?\u201d He plunged the blade through the chest wall, cutting and hacking, then reached his hand in.</p> <p>Inside, his tiger waited, their minds meeting in a way they never had before. The tiger flicked his nose up with a growl, urging him to complete the task. Tighe curved his hand around the beating heart and plucked it from the clone\u2019s chest, crushing it in his fist as he poured his love into Delaney.</p><p>Inside him, the tiger pulled the missing half of Tighe\u2019s soul through the woman they both loved, freeing her from the evil and, please goddess, healing her body and saving her life.</p><p>For a breathless heartbeat, Delaney\u2019s body jerked, then filled with air and life as her wounds began to heal at the rate of miracles.</p><p>Joy filled him, twining with the amazing rush of life flowing back through his own body, and reuniting his soul.</p><p>He could hear her heartbeat, firm and steady, as he watched her blood-coated chest rise and fall beneath the healing wounds. Her hand twitched, lifting slightly, then relaxing as she stirred.</p><p>Dark lashes fluttered, slowly rising as her gaze took in the sky. He waited, breath caught, as those dark eyes turned to him.</p> <p>\u201cBrown eyes.\u201d</p><p>She smiled at him. \u201cYours are green again.\u201d</p><p>Emotion caught in his throat and he hauled her up until he could bury his face in her hair. \u201cWe did it, D. We did it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he dead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is.\u201d He blinked back the moisture blurring his vision and raised his head to meet her gaze as his brothers gathered around him, their hands slapping his now-healed shoulders in an outpouring of joyous relief.</p><p>Lyon stood at his elbow, his hand glued to Tighe\u2019s shoulder, his eyes gleaming. \u201cDamn, that was close. But you pulled it off. Brilliantly.\u201d</p><p>Tighe just grinned.</p><p>Delaney wrapped her arm around his neck and pulled herself up in his arms, looking down at herself. \u201cUh, I know you can\u2019t see a lot through the blanket of blood, but I need a shirt.\u201d</p> <p>Hawke tossed Lyon his own black silk shirt. As Lyon helped her into it, Delaney groaned.</p><p>\u201cI can really do this myself. And I\u2019m pretty sure I can stand. I feel fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not letting you go,\u201d Tighe growled. Ever. He met Lyon\u2019s gaze. \u201cI want the Shaman to look her over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was thinking the same.\u201d Lyon turned. \u201cHawke, if you\u2019ve still got a cell phone, call Wulfe and have him bring clothes, then call the Shaman and ask him to meet Tighe back at the house. We\u2019ve got to get out of here before the humans come to investigate the gunshots.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the blood?\u201d Delaney asked.</p><p>Lyon nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll call a Feral Circle. They\u2019ll never see it. Then the rest of us are going draden hunting.\u201d He turned to the others. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to get that menace under control!\u201d</p><p>As Lyon called a Feral Circle, and the others shifted back into their animals before any humans arrived, Tighe held Delaney against his heart.</p><p>He kissed her hair. \u201cHow do you feel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. Which makes no sense. I should be dead after what he did to me.\u201d</p><p>Tighe smiled into her eyes, falling into the love shining in those dark depths, a love that stretched between them like an unbreakable cord. \u201cWhen my soul returned to me, it passed through you, healing you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s amazing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was the tiger\u2019s idea. A damn fine spirit, that one.\u201d</p><p>Delaney smiled. \u201cI love you both.\u201d</p><p>The tiger positively purred.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s mutual, brown eyes. Both ways.\u201d He brushed his forehead against hers.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s really over?\u201d she asked softly.</p><p>The rush of grief he felt rise in her nearly brought him to his knees.</p><p>She still meant to leave him.</p><p>He felt as if she were cutting out his heart. His excuses for keeping her here were all but gone. If the Shaman gave her a clean bill of health, he\u2019d have no more reason not to cloud her mind, as he should easily be able to do now that the clone\u2019s hold over her was gone. Taking her memories of this whole ordeal.</p><p>Taking her memories of him.</p><p>\u201cD,\u201d he said softly. He needed her. But somehow he had to convince her she needed him.</p><p>Chapter Thirty</p><p>\u201cTighe, I can walk.\u201d Delaney tightened her hold on Tighe\u2019s neck as he swung her through the front door of Feral House. \u201cI feel fine.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d been carrying her constantly since he lifted her off that pentagram, as if he were afraid to let her go.</p><p>\u201cNot until the Shaman gives you a clean bill of health.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStubborn man,\u201d she muttered, loud enough for him to hear. But she kissed his cheek, softly, loving that he cherished her so.</p><p>Loving him.</p><p>How am I ever going to live without him?</p><p>A glad cry rang from high up the stairs, and Delaney looked up to see Kara running toward them, her face wreathed in joy. \u201cYou did it!\u201d She wrapped them both in a big hug. \u201cLyon said you\u2019d gotten him, but I had to see for myself.\u201d Kara\u2019s gaze swung to her. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d The uncomplicated friendliness in Kara\u2019s eyes warmed her all over again.</p><p>\u201cAs I keep telling Tighe, I feel fine. But he refuses to let me down.\u201d</p><p>Kara stepped back, a knowing smile lighting her eyes.</p><p>The sudden tightening of Tighe\u2019s grip on her had her looking at him with question.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you met Pink?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but Kara\u2019s told me about her.\u201d She knew Pink was their cook and housekeeper. And half-flamingo.</p><p>She felt the stiffness go out of his hands. \u201cGood. Pink, come join us.\u201d</p><p>Delaney turned to look down the hall, where the extraordinary creature walked slowly toward them. The size of a woman, she possessed a human-looking face and hands, but her legs were those of a flamingo. In place of skin, she was covered in pink feathers.</p><p>Kara had told her that Pink should have been a Feral many centuries ago, but the animal spirit had flown to her in the womb, just before the egg split, creating twins. And possibly destroying the animal spirit. Pink\u2019s twin had been killed in an attempt to free the animal, but it hadn\u2019t worked. So Pink kept house and cooked for the Ferals, safe from the prying eyes of humans.</p><p>\u201cLet me down, Tighe. I want to greet her properly.\u201d</p><p>With a grumble, he did, and Delaney turned to the unusual woman. \u201cHi, Pink. I\u2019m Delaney.\u201d She held out her hand. \u201cDo you shake?\u201d</p><p>The bird-woman inclined her head and held out her own.</p><p>Delaney took it, gently curling her fingers around the soft feathers. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you.\u201d</p><p>Unblinking birdlike eyes watched her, then slowly lit. A smile formed on her not-quite-human-looking mouth. \u201cI\u2019m happy to make your acquaintance, Delaney. I wish you and Tighe much happiness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, but...\u201d The words caught in her throat. \u201cWe\u2019re...only a temporary item.\u201d</p><p>Pink\u2019s expression clouded. \u201cTighe\u2019s a good man.\u201d</p><p>Delaney was horrified to feel tears pricking her eyes. \u201cI know. It\u2019s just...\u201d She smiled unhappily. \u201cI\u2019m human.\u201d</p><p>Without warning, Tighe swept her back into his arms. She forced a laugh, trying to make up for the damper she\u2019d thrown on the mood, even as misery burned in her chest, and her eyes filled with tears.</p><p>\u201cWe need to have a talk. Now.\u201d As he swung her toward the stairs, he called back to Kara. \u201cSend the Shaman up when he gets here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about I call you first to make sure you\u2019re not...busy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTalk, Kara. I said we\u2019re going to have a talk.\u201d</p><p>But he said nothing until Delaney was sitting in the middle of his bed and he\u2019d paced the room a good seven times before finally swinging to face her, his body and expression as fierce and rigid as a man going into battle.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t give a damn that you\u2019re human. I want you to stay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTighe...it\u2019s impossible.\u201d She swiped at the tears running down her cheeks, but more just followed. \u201cI have to go back. I can\u2019t stay here.\u201d</p><p>His expression turned almost hostile. \u201cWhy not?\u201d In his eyes an emotion flared. Pain.</p><p>\u201cOh, Tighe.\u201d Delaney climbed off the bed and went to him, sliding her arms around his rigid body as she pressed her damp cheek to his chest. \u201cIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t love you, because I do. But I don\u2019t belong in this world. You know that. I can\u2019t stay.\u201d</p><p>Tighe gripped her shoulders and pulled her away from him. The desperation in his eyes nearly crushed her heart.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make you happy, D. I swear it. You can carry all the guns you want, and all my knives. You can come draden hunting with me anytime, or you can stay here with Kara and Pink. Whatever you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTighe, you\u2019re not thinking this all the way through.\u201d</p><p>His hands caressed her shoulders. \u201cI know I\u2019m being unfair in asking you to give up everything for me. I have no right, brown eyes, no right. But I need you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s because you bound yourself to me. You shouldn\u2019t have done it.\u201d</p><p>He squeezed her almost painfully. \u201cDo you think that\u2019s what this is? The bond? You\u2019re wrong, Delaney. I was already in love with you.\u201d His voice rose, his words turning angry. \u201cThis isn\u2019t the ritual speaking, dammit, this is my heart!\u201d</p><p>His anger tore at her. His pain twisted inside her, merging with her own until she was almost doubled over from the onslaught.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s your heart, Tighe, for now. But you\u2019re not seeing the big picture. If you keep me here, you\u2019ll be tying yourself to a woman you won\u2019t want in twenty years. Maybe far, far sooner.\u201d</p><p>He looked at her as if he was ready to draw swords and fight it out. \u201cI\u2019ll always want you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You won\u2019t. Think, Tighe! I won\u2019t stay this way. In forty years, I\u2019ll have gray hair and wrinkles. My figure will be gone. I\u2019ll be an old woman.\u201d</p><p>With a snarl, he gripped her face. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll have fangs. And orange eyes every time I look at you, because I\u2019ll always want you. Always.\u201d</p><p>The fight went out of him, his face crumbling into a mask of aching tenderness as he slid his palms over her jaw, cradling her face with infinite tenderness.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you understand?\u201d His words were soft as silk, yet woven with a thread of desperation that tore at her heart. \u201cI\u2019m going to use your own words back at you, D, because they healed my soul. When I look into your eyes, I see you. I will always see you, no matter what changes time makes to the body you\u2019re in.\u201d</p><p>Her tears turned slowly to sobs as she slid her hands over his and held him as he held her, wanting to believe. But she couldn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cYou think that now. But...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t doubt me, D,\u201d he snarled. But his thumbs were feather-soft as they stroked her skin. \u201cIf you live longer than most humans, I\u2019ll still only have, at most, another seventy years with you. That\u2019s a blink of an eye in my life. For six hundred years I\u2019ve made love with women. Most young-looking, I admit. Most beautiful. Scores of women, D.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this supposed to be making me feel better?\u201d She tried to laugh, but it caught in her throat, tangling with her tears.</p><p>\u201cOther than those few short years with Gretchen, not a single one has ever touched my heart. Until you. Beauty is meaningless without love, D. I know this.\u201d His hands were beginning to tremble. \u201cIt\u2019s lust. Little more than scratching an itch. But it\u2019s not that way with you. From the moment I first saw you, it hasn\u2019t been that way with you. It\u2019s you I want to spend the next seventy years with, not your breasts. Not your skin. You, D. Your heart. Your soul.\u201d</p><p>He bent until his gaze was nearly at a level with hers, his eyes as certain as the sunrise. His love poured into her through his gaze and rushed into her through that warm connection between their hearts, filling her. Lifting her.</p><p>He pressed his hand to her chest, over her heart. \u201cYou belong with me. And I with you. You fill me, Delaney, in a way no one ever has before. And never will again. No one.\u201d He pulled her tight against him, stroking her hair, as his big body shook. \u201cIf you really want to go, I won\u2019t make you stay.\u201d His voice was hollow, his eyes bleak as he pulled her back where she could see him through the glaze of her tears.</p><p>Moisture glistened in his own eyes. \u201cI would never do anything to hurt you, brown eyes. But, sweet goddess, D, I want you to stay.\u201d</p><p>As she clung to him, she thought of all she\u2019d be giving up if she took the risk and followed her heart. All her adult life, she\u2019d sought revenge for her mother\u2019s murder with a drive born of a need she\u2019d never really understood. A need to make her life right. To make her self right. But, she knew now, no number of arrests were going to do that. Not even if by some miracle she caught the man who\u2019d killed her mom. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Because the thing she\u2019d been truly lacking all these years wasn\u2019t closure. It was love.</p><p>As the sobs began to choke her, Delaney reached up and pressed her palm to his cheek. \u201cAll I want is to be with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cD.\u201d</p> <p>He swung her into his arms and laid her on the bed, following her down. The joy that flowed between their hearts, a joy mirrored in his eyes as he lowered his face and kissed her, filled her soul.</p><p>They were still kissing when a rap sounded at the door. Slowly Tighe pulled back, his eyes golden orange and shining with love. \u201cThat will be the Shaman. Anyone else, I\u2019d let stand out there for a couple of hours while I made love to my mate.\u201d</p><p>She threw him a saucy look. \u201cSure he can\u2019t wait?\u201d</p><p>Tighe grinned. \u201cHold that thought.\u201d He vaulted off the bed and went to open the door as Delaney sat up and rearranged her shirt.</p><p>Kara had told her that though the Shaman looked to be about fifteen, thanks to a Mage attack in his youth which ended his growth, he was in fact thousands of years old. Apparently he could see no reason to pretend to be what he wasn\u2019t. Which probably accounted for the long hair, tight black pants, and white ruffled shirt that made her think of an eighteenth-century swordsman.</p> <p>He lifted an eyebrow as he saw her adjusting her clothes, a smile hovering at his youthful-looking mouth. \u201cShall I come back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Tighe ushered him into the room.</p><p>The Shaman winked at her. \u201cLet\u2019s have a look at you, young lady. Lie down for me.\u201d For minute after minute, the Shaman touched her, passed his hands over her, and pressed his fingers into her skull. Finally, he stepped back.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d Tighe asked, his voice vibrating with concern.</p><p>The Shaman clasped his hands behind his back. \u201cWell, it\u2019s not what I expected.\u201d Tension filled the room, hers and Tighe\u2019s combined. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you tell me what happened?\u201d</p><p>Tighe did, and by the time he was through, the Shaman was nodding, an odd smile playing around his mouth.</p> <p>\u201cHe left no dark magic behind,\u201d he said. \u201cNor any piece of his consciousness, now that I know what I\u2019m looking for. I gravely apologize for missing that before.\u201d</p><p>Tighe waved away the apology. \u201cTell us, Shaman.\u201d</p><p>The Shaman turned to her. \u201cYou\u2019re completely healthy, Delaney. As strong as any other immortal.\u201d</p><p>Delaney jerked. \u201cI\u2019m not immortal.\u201d She looked at Tighe and found him staring at the Shaman with an expression that was nothing short of stunned.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you saying?\u201d Tighe demanded.</p><p>The Shaman smiled fully. \u201cPassing your soul through her did more than heal her. You\u2019ve shared your own immortal essence with her.\u201d</p><p>Tighe\u2019s gaze swung to hers, filled with the same hope, the same joy swirling inside her shocked brain. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCut her and see for yourself.\u201d</p> <p>Tighe scowled. \u201cI\u2019m not cutting her.\u201d</p><p>Delaney leaped off the bed and pulled down the closest of Tighe\u2019s knives. \u201cI\u2019ll cut me.\u201d She pricked her finger on the tip and watched, wide-eyed as the wound closed right up again.</p><p>Her gaze swung to the Shaman. \u201cAre you sure this is permanent? It\u2019s not going to wear off?\u201d</p><p>The Shaman shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to wear off. You\u2019ve been altered, Delaney.\u201d He lifted a brow. \u201cI hope this is good news?\u201d</p><p>Her heart stuttered as she turned to Tighe. \u201cIt won\u2019t be seventy years. Are you sure you want me around forever?\u201d</p><p>With a shout of triumph that shook every knife on the wall, Tighe lifted her into his arms and swung her around until she was dizzy with joy.</p><p>Slowly he let her feet slide to the floor as he loved her with his eyes.</p><p>\u201cEven eternity won\u2019t be long enough.\u201d</p><p>As Tighe kissed her, she felt his love wrap around her and blossom inside her in a bloom of color and life, filling her heart and mending her soul.</p><p>And through the link that bound them, she heard the unmistakable sound of a tiger\u2019s satisfied roar.</p><p>An hour later, after the Shaman left and Tighe had made thorough love to his mate, he led her down the stairs to raid the refrigerator, the two of them grinning like a pair of guilty teenagers. Until he heard the rumble of Lyon\u2019s voice and knew from the tone, there was trouble.</p><p>He squeezed Delaney\u2019s hand. \u201cThe food may have to wait.\u201d As they entered the dining room, he saw that the others were already there, sitting silently, their expressions grim as they watched their leader on his cell phone.</p><p>Tighe held Delaney against his side as they all waited. Finally, Lyon hung up.</p><p>\u201cThat was Foxx. Paenther\u2019s missing. Somewhere in the Blue Ridge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMage?\u201d Jag asked the question all of them feared.</p><p>Lyon nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s what it looks like. Foxx sounds...disoriented. More than a little confused. I think he may have fallen under an enchantment as well. He\u2019s near Winchester. I told him to stay there and wait for us.\u201d</p><p>Lyon\u2019s hard gaze swung to Delaney. \u201cThe Shaman says you\u2019re no longer mortal.\u201d</p><p>Tighe pulled her tighter against him as they both watched Lyon warily.</p><p>Delaney tensed within his hold. \u201cApparently not.\u201d A smile flickered over her face as she glanced behind Lyon.</p><p>Kara was grinning at her with a double thumbs-up.</p><p>Lyon stepped toward them. \u201cYou\u2019re a trained FBI agent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. I need you to work this case, if you will, without involving the human authorities in any way. You\u2019ll be accompanying Tighe and Jag. Can I count on you?\u201d</p><p>Tighe felt her excitement, her pleasure, flowing down the link between them and grinned.</p><p>Delaney smiled. \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d</p><p>As Lyon turned away to issue other orders, Tighe hugged her tight with both arms.</p><p>She looked up at him, excitement shining in her eyes. \u201cLooks like we\u2019re going to be partners.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways,\u201d he murmured, his eyes going hot.</p><p>In those shining dark eyes of hers he saw the warrior she would always be. His warrior.</p><p>His love.</p><p>His life. </p> </body></html>"]
