Caitlyn Lena Rogue Walker watched as Principal Thompson entered the classroom after her freshmen students had left for the day. Hot on his heels were the self- righteous Nadine Grace and her bully of a brother, Dayle Mackay.</p><p>She knew what was coming. Somehow they\u2019d found a way to punish her for coming to a student\u2019s defense the month before. She had been waiting for the shoe to drop, and she had a feeling that when it fell, it was going to be an earthquake in her little life.</p> <p>At least she didn\u2019t have to worry about it happening any longer.</p><p>Maybe she should have heeded her father\u2019s advice about coming here to his hometown to teach. He had wanted her to stay in Boston; he\u2019d wanted her to be a lawyer rather than a teacher. Or better yet, the wife of a lawyer. Being a lawyer or the wife of a lawyer didn\u2019t suit Caitlyn Rogue though. Neither did the name Lena\u2014her friends and family knew better than to call her Lena if they wanted her to respond. She wanted to teach, and she wanted to teach in the picturesque little town her father had told her so many tales of.</p><p>Perhaps she should have heeded the tales he had told her of Dayle Mackay and Nadine Grace though, as well as his warnings to make certain she stayed off their radar. But staying off their radar hadn\u2019t been as easy as she had thought it would be.</p><p>And as her father had warned her, they would target her simply because she was a Walker. Nadine Grace and Dayle Mackay had tried to destroy her father when he was younger, and it seemed they were more than determined to destroy her.</p><p>She had lived in Somerset for one short year. Long enough to know she loved it here.</p> <p>Long enough to plant a few quick roots, to dream, and to meet the county\u2019s beyond-sexy sheriff.</p><p>The schoolteacher and the sheriff. What a fantasy. Because within months, she learned that her father hadn\u2019t been exaggerating about Dayle and Nadine. At the end of the school term the year before, she\u2019d been forced to enter their radar to defend one of her students against Nadine\u2019s accusations that he had cheated on an exam that she had overseen as a member of the Board of Education. Caitlyn knew the boy hadn\u2019t cheated, just as she knew that no defense would help her now.</p><p>As her gaze met the two, she could feel her stomach tightening in warning as her heart began to pound a heavy, sluggish beat.</p><p>Brother and sister resembled each other in too many ways. The same black hair, the same squared features. Nadine was built smaller, and her eyes were hazel rather than green. Dayle Mackay was taller, with thicker black hair and forest green eyes. He would have been handsome if the evil that was a part of his soul didn\u2019t reflect in his eyes.</p><p>Neither Dayle nor Nadine spoke as they entered the room with the principal. Rogue remained in her seat, watching them cautiously as Nadine moved forward and slapped a small stack of pictures down in front of her.</p><p>A glimpse of the first one was enough to know exactly how Dayle and Nadine intended to destroy her.</p> <p>Caitlyn stared down at them, feeling shame, mortification, but mostly defeat. She had never known defeat until she stared down at the pictures that she knew she could never refute. Not because she hadn\u2019t done it, but because she had been unable to stop it.</p><p>Fanning the pictures out slowly, she had to bite back a cry that tightened her chest and had her hands shaking. She had somehow known that one night that she couldn\u2019t fully remember had been a setup. She had sensed it then, she knew it now, and the rage and pain festered in her chest like a wound she wondered would ever heal.</p><p>Rogue swallowed back the bile that rose in her throat and ordered herself not to react, not to show pain, fear, or anger. She had her pride and she would be damned if she would let these two know how much they were hurting her. How much they were stealing from her.</p><p>\u201cAs you can see, Ms. Walker, there\u2019s no way we can allow you to remain within the educational system,\u201d Principal Thompson informed her in a tone laced with chilling morality. \u201cSuch actions cannot be condoned.\u201d</p><p>No, they couldn\u2019t be, Caitlyn would be the first to agree with him. If she had done it voluntarily.</p><p>The pictures showed her half undressed, her skirt raised well above her thighs, her legs spread for the male between them. Higher, her blouse was undone; a female, her long hair obscuring her face, obviously caressed Caitlyn\u2019s bare breasts with her lips.</p><p>Caitlyn blinked down at the photos. There was no fighting them, though she knew, whatever had happened that night, she hadn\u2019t had sex. When she had awakened in the unfamiliar hotel room, the first thing she had done was schedule an emergency appointment with her doctor. But the school board wouldn\u2019t care about that. No more than they would care about the blood tests that had shown that whatever happened, she hadn\u2019t gone into it willingly. Rogue had been drugged and betrayed.</p><p>She was still a virgin, but she would be branded as a whore.</p> <p>She could fight it. She could call her parents. Nadine Grace and Dayle Mackay had no idea how powerful her parents were now, how eloquently they could seduce a jury, how enraged they would be if she ever let them know what had happened here.</p><p>Brianna and Calvin Walker would descend upon this county like wraiths from hell with all the powerful Bostonian wealth they had amassed behind them.</p><p>Her grandparents, the Evansworths, were icons in Boston. Her mother\u2019s parents would destroy Grace and Mackay without a thought.</p><p>But her father had warned her, and she had promised him she was a big girl, and that just like her brother and sister, she would carve out her own future, and she would succeed. She had promised him that there was nothing this county could do to destroy her.</p><p>She was going to teach, marry, and raise babies in the mountains. That was her dream.</p><p>And her dream was crumbling beneath her feet. She felt her world shifting on its axis, felt the shame and the rage building inside her until she wondered if her head would explode with it.</p><p>Nadine sniffed. \u201cYou have a week to leave and we\u2019ll not resort to putting the pictures on the Internet.\u201d</p><p>She stared back at the pinched-face bitch that so hated her student Shane Mayes simply because he was the sheriff\u2019s son, and the sheriff refused to kowtow to her or her brother.</p><p>It was rumored Sheriff Zeke Mayes kowtowed to no man, or woman.</p><p>\u201cI really don\u2019t give a fuck where you put them.\u201d It wouldn\u2019t do her any good, Nadine would do as she wished anyway. \u201cI\u2019m not leaving Somerset.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy dear Ms. Walker, your employment here . . .\u201d the principal began.</p><p>\u201cIs obviously at an end.\u201d Caitlyn smiled tightly as she picked up the photos and shoved them in her case. \u201cI\u2019ll clear my desk this evening, Mr. Thompson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll leave town,\u201d Dayle Mackay stated, his voice like ice.</p><p>The man was a viper. His son, the town\u2019s bad boy, had a heart of gold. But this man, he was black, evil. It was in his eyes, in his face. It was almost enough to send a shiver down her spine. But she didn\u2019t shiver, her spine straightened and pure Walker arrogance and stubborn pride kicked in. Her father had once warned her that her pride would be the death of her.</p><p>\u201cGo to hell, Mackay.\u201d She could barely speak. Fury was ripping through her, tearing at her.</p><p>\u201cYour reputation will be less than nothing by the time we finish with you, Caitlyn.\u201d</p><p>Nadine\u2019s tight-lipped, superior smile looked like a wolf\u2019s curl of the lip. Anticipatory.</p><p>Ready to strike. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to stay here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t want me to stay because you\u2019re terrified that if one person stands up to your viciousness, then others will,\u201d she stated calmly. \u201cI\u2019m doing more than standing up to you, Nadine, I\u2019m warning you now, you can\u2019t hurt me.\u201d</p><p>Nadine\u2019s smile was cold. \u201cYour position within the school system has been terminated, Ms. Walker, and your standing in this county will be history.\u201d Her tone assured Rogue she felt she had done the damage she wanted to do.</p><p>Caitlyn forced herself to laugh. Her father had taught her how to be strong; her mother had taught her how to be a lady. But her grandmother, ah, her grandmother had taught her how to be a bitch and made Caitlyn enjoy every lesson.</p><p>Bess Evansworth was a force of nature and a law unto herself. And Caitlyn had been her favorite. She had always allowed Caitlyn to tag along with her and her cronies to their luncheons and teas. And Caitlyn had learned.</p><p>\u201cPut them on the Internet.\u201d Caitlyn\u2019s smile was all teeth. \u201cI dare you. Better yet, mail a set to my grandparents. Their address is easy to find. Evansworth. Taite and Bessamine Evansworth, Boston. I\u2019m sure my grandmother will get a tickle out of it. Though, Daddy might return to Somerset.\u201d She shrugged as though she didn\u2019t care. \u201cYou could take your chances.\u201d</p><p>She shoved the few possessions from her desk into her bag. She didn\u2019t have much. They hadn\u2019t really given her time to settle in. She could fight the school board, but who really wanted to? She\u2019d come here with dreams, and over the past months she had learned how ineffectual those dreams were in these mountains.</p><p>Somerset was beautiful, inspiring, and filled with dark, poisonous little creatures just waiting to strike. She had sensed that during the first few months here. She knew it the moment she had met these two, and now she felt their swift, sharp attack.</p><p>The pictures were in her purse, but she knew that meant so very little. Simply that she had her own copies. Damn them.</p><p>\u201cStaying here will serve no purpose,\u201d Dayle Mackay snorted. \u201cYou\u2019re not wanted, you little bitch, any more than your ignorant father was wanted or any of the Walker clan.</p><p>The lot of you are nothing but white trash, whores, and drug-guzzling bastards.\u201d</p><p>Oh, one day, he\u2019d pay for that one. They would both pay for that one.</p><p>\u201cOh well, far be it for me to prove you wrong,\u201d she replied mockingly. \u201cDo whatever the hell you want with the pictures. But.\u201d She paused as she picked up the oversized bag at her side. \u201cBe watching for me. When you least expect it.\u201d She looked between the two. \u201cWhen you very least expect it, I\u2019ll be there. And it won\u2019t be trumped-up photos that are used to break either one of you. It will be the truth.\u201d</p><p>She left the school, and she left her dreams behind her. She put her dreams behind her, and she refused to call her parents. This was her life, and the thought of dragging them into the mess she had allowed to develop made her cringe.</p><p>It was her fault. She should have done as her father warned her and let his friends, who managed the bar he still owned in town, know who she was when she went there, rather than hiding from them. It wouldn\u2019t have happened then, because they would have watched out for her.</p><p>The problem was, she hadn\u2019t wanted anyone to watch out for her. She had been too confident that she could watch out for herself. She was an adult. She was able to defend herself. In the arrogance of youth she had convinced herself that nothing or no one could touch her.</p><p>She had entered that bar as confident and arrogant as any young woman that had just turned twenty-one, watched the excitement and fun with a sense of anticipation. And she had let herself be betrayed and nearly used. She had made that mistake. It was no one\u2019s fault but her own. She would live with it.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t about to leave Pulaski County though. As she drove home, she stared out at the mountains, watched the sun blaze full and bright as it began its descent in the evening sky, and she knew she couldn\u2019t leave.</p><p>She had been raised in the city, but these mountains, they were a part of her. From the moment she had entered them, she had known she had come home, and she\u2019d known she never wanted to be anywhere else.</p><p>But now, she knew an adjustment would have to be made.</p><p>Her eyes narrowed, her jaw clenched. Damn Nadine Grace and Dayle Mackay. She wasn\u2019t going to be run out of town. She wouldn\u2019t be defeated like that. They had won this round, and those pictures would probably be on the Internet within hours. But that didn\u2019t mean they had beaten her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her hands clenched on the steering wheel as she drew in a hard, deep breath. Her father had always called her his little rogue. He would smile fondly when she dressed in her</p><p>\u201cgood girl\u201d clothes as he called them, and his eyes would always twinkle as though he knew something she didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re as wild as the wind,\u201d he would tell her, and she had always denied it.</p> <p>But now, she could feel that part of herself burning beneath the surface of the \u201cgood girl.\u201d The dreams of teaching had always held her back. A teacher had to be circumspect. She had to be careful. But Caitlyn Rogue Walker was no longer a teacher.</p><p>She no longer had to worry about being circumspect. She didn\u2019t have to worry about protecting a job she didn\u2019t have.</p><p>She flipped on the car\u2019s turn signal and took the road that headed to the little bar outside of town. It had begun there\u2014somehow, her drink had been spiked there that night\u2014and if her father knew what had happened, he would burn it to the ground.</p><p>Unfortunately, she had loved being in that damned bar.</p><p>She had sat in the corner, watched, devoured the atmosphere and had longed to be something more than a \u201cgood girl\u201d while she had been there.</p> <p>There was an apartment overhead. The manager, Jonesy, was a good friend of her father\u2019s, as were the bouncers that worked there. She only had to walk in, announce who she was, and take over ownership.</p><p>Had her father somehow sensed her dreams would go awry here more than he had told her? Because he had offered her the bar. Told her that when she got tired of playing the political games that filled the educational system that she could always run the bar. And his eyes had been filled with knowledge, as though he had known the wildness inside his daughter would eventually be drawn free.</p><p>Her reputation had been destroyed because of whatever had happened there the one night she hadn\u2019t been cautious enough. Now it was time to remake that reputation.</p><p>Rogue was young, but she was pragmatic. She was bitter now, and she knew that bitterness would fester until Nadine Grace and Dayle Mackay had paid for what they had done. But she wasn\u2019t going to let it destroy her. She wouldn\u2019t give them the satisfaction of destroying her.</p><p>She smiled in anticipation, in anger. Nadine Grace and Dayle Mackay had no idea what they had done. They had destroyed Caitlyn Walker, but nothing or no one could destroy the Rogue she intended to become.</p><p>One week later</p> <p>Sheriff Ezekiel Mayes eased from his current lover\u2019s bed and moved through the bedroom to the shower. The widow he was currently seeing slept on, oblivious to his absence as he showered and dressed.</p><p>It would be the last night he spent with her, he knew. Zeke insisted on privacy in his relationships. He didn\u2019t publicly date; he didn\u2019t claim any woman. There was no room in his life, his heart, or his secrets for such a woman. And she was steadily pushing for more. He knew if he didn\u2019t break it off now, then it would only become a mess he didn\u2019t want to face.</p><p>He didn\u2019t want ties. He didn\u2019t want the complications that came from claiming any woman as his own. He didn\u2019t want the danger he knew a woman of his could face. He was walking a thin line and he knew it; he wouldn\u2019t make his balance more precarious by taking a lover that could become a weakness. Calvin Walker\u2019s daughter was definitely a weakness, simply because of her affiliation with the Walkers and others\u2019</p><p>hatred for them. The job he had set for himself demanded a fragile balance at the moment. Maintaining that balance would be impossible if he gave in to the needs clawing at his gut right now for one innocent little schoolteacher.</p><p>As he moved from the bathroom Mina rolled over and blinked back at him sleepily.</p><p>Slumberous, dark eyes flickered over him as a pout pursed her full, sensual lips.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not even dawn yet,\u201d she muttered, obviously less than pleased to find him leaving.</p><p>She should have expected it. He always left before dawn.</p> <p>\u201cI need to get into the office early,\u201d he told her. And he did, but it could have waited.</p><p>Mina Harlow was a generous, warm lover, but she wanted a relationship, and Zeke wasn\u2019t ready to complicate his life to that extent. He hid enough of himself the way it was, he wasn\u2019t interested in hiding it on a regular basis.</p><p>\u201cWhatever.\u201d She stretched beneath the blankets before eyeing him with a glimmer of amusement. \u201cOh, I forgot to tell you. That little schoolteacher that looks at you with stars in her eyes, Miss Walker. The school board fired her last week.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t want to hear this particular piece of gossip again. He sure as hell didn\u2019t want to hear the satisfaction in Mina\u2019s tone at the fact that the little schoolteacher had been hurt. Mina was gloating over it, simply because Caitlyn hadn\u2019t hid her interest in him.</p><p>This was bullshit. Catty, snide, and hurtful. He\u2019d thought better of Mina at one time.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like gossip, Mina,\u201d he reminded her.</p><p>She gave a soft little laugh. \u201cCome on, Zeke, it\u2019s all over town and now it\u2019s hit the Internet. Pictures of her in the cutest little three-some with another couple. Who would have guessed she had it in her.\u201d</p><p>Zeke wouldn\u2019t have, and he still didn\u2019t believe it. He\u2019d heard about the pictures more than he wanted to. He refused to look at them.</p><p>\u201cMiss Goody Two Shoes got caught having her fun,\u201d Mina said smoothly. \u201cI can\u2019t believe she thought she could get away with playing like that here. She should have known better.\u201d</p><p>Zeke\u2019s lips thinned as he sat at the bottom of the bed and pulled his boots on. Dammit, he didn\u2019t need to hear this again. He could feel that edge of burning anger in his gut, the one that warned him he was letting a woman get too close.</p><p>Caitlyn Rogue Walker was nothing to him, he told himself. He couldn\u2019t let her become something to him, either. She was too damned innocent, no matter what those photos might show. Not to mention too damned young.</p><p>\u201cToo bad the cameraperson didn\u2019t take a few more.\u201d Mina yawned then. \u201cMiss Walker wasn\u2019t even fully undressed, but she was definitely getting ready to have a good time.\u201d</p><p>His jaw bunched. The innocent Miss Walker had pissed off the wrong people, and Zeke felt responsible for that. Hell, this was just what he needed. He had steered clear of her for the express purpose of making certain she was never targeted for any reason because of him, and she had ended up as a target because of his son instead.</p><p>She had caught the attention of two of the town\u2019s worst inhabitants. A brother and sister who delighted in destroying anyone they could. She had caught their attention by defending his son at school.</p><p>He felt responsible. It was his son, and despite his knowledge that she had been set up, he still hadn\u2019t managed to find a way to punish those who had hurt her or to tamp down his growing interest in a woman he had no business touching.</p><p>He could feel the curling knot of anger, a hint of territorial possessiveness where the teacher was concerned and squelched it immediately. Miss Walker was too young, too innocent. She wasn\u2019t a woman that would accept a sex-only relationship, nor was she a woman Zeke would be able to hide the darker core of his sexuality with, as he did other women. Women such as Mina. Women who touched only his body, never his heart.</p><p>Miss Walker had the potential to touch the inner man, and he refused to give her the chance.</p><p>He\u2019d failed to protect one woman in his life already; he wouldn\u2019t make that mistake again.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s Calvin Walker\u2019s daughter, you know,\u201d Mina continued. \u201cHell, I thought he was dead. What\u2019s he doing with a daughter? Damned Walkers have never been worth crap, so it shouldn\u2019t be surprising.\u201d</p><p>Zeke rose to his feet and turned back to her. \u201cI\u2019m heading out, Mina. Take care.\u201d</p><p>This relationship was over. He could barely manage civility now. Mina had always seemed like a kindhearted woman. She had a ready smile, compassionate hazel eyes, a gentle face. And a mean streak a mile wide. He\u2019d learned that over the past few months.</p><p>When it came to other women, younger women, anyone she considered a threat to what she might want at the time, she turned viperous.</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re not coming back.\u201d Her expression lost its amusement now. \u201cDid you think I didn\u2019t know your attention was waning, Zeke?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe had an understanding, Mina.\u201d He\u2019d made certain of it before the relationship began.</p><p>She sat up in the bed, unashamedly naked, her short brown hair mussed attractively around her face.</p><p>\u201cYour attention hasn\u2019t been worth shit since you met that girl,\u201d she accused him snidely. \u201cYou go through the motions, but I don\u2019t doubt you\u2019re thinking of her when you\u2019re fucking me.\u201d</p><p>His brow lifted. \u201cJealousy doesn\u2019t become you, Mina, and it\u2019s not a part of what we had.</p><p>In this case, you\u2019re wrong. There\u2019s nothing between me and Miss Walker.\u201d</p><p>And there never could be. She was too young, too tender. Zeke didn\u2019t mess with women whose innocence lit their eyes like stars in the sky. Caitlyn Walker was the forever kind, and Zeke simply didn\u2019t have that to give her. Forever required the truth, it required parts of himself being revealed, and he\u2019d learned at a young age that the truth wasn\u2019t always acceptable.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing between the two of you because you\u2019re a closemouthed bastard intent on making certain you never give so much as an ounce of yourself,\u201d she snapped.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Zeke, can\u2019t anyone match the memory of that paragon you were married to? Or did you simply spend too much time in Los Angeles partying with all the gay boys?\u201d</p><p>Zeke stared back at her silently. Prejudice in the mountains was still alive and thriving; he\u2019d known that before he came home.</p><p>\u201cGood-bye, Mina.\u201d</p><p>He turned and left the room. He\u2019d be damned if he\u2019d let himself be drawn into an argument with her, especially one she could use against him at any time in the future.</p><p>Zeke had a lot friends that still lived in L.A., and yeah, a few of them were gay. He and his past wife, Elaina, hadn\u2019t felt that sense of prejudice that thrived here. He didn\u2019t give a damn what a man or woman\u2019s sexual preference was. He hadn\u2019t cared then, and he didn\u2019t care now.</p><p>As he left Mina\u2019s little house outside town, he reminded himself that he was here to do a job, not to make friends or to find another wife. He\u2019d been born and bred in these mountains; he knew every cliff and hollow, every breath of breeze and sigh of the wind.</p><p>And he\u2019d missed it like hell when he\u2019d been forced to leave. Not that he\u2019d had a choice at the time. It was leave with his mother or face the further destruction of his soul.</p><p>At fourteen, his life had changed forever. One moment in time had cursed him and had caused his parents\u2019 divorce. Moving to L.A. with his mother and meeting Elaina, the woman he\u2019d married, had changed it further. At seventeen he\u2019d become a father himself, and through the years he had learned the hard way that he couldn\u2019t run from his past. It had found him, and his wife had died because of it.</p><p>He was back in Kentucky because of it. Because he was tired of running, tired of fighting to forget what couldn\u2019t be forgotten.</p><p>Damn, he loved these mountains though, he thought as he started his truck and pulled out of Mina\u2019s back drive. The sun was rising over the peaks of pine, oak, and elm that filled the rolling hills. There was a mist in the air that drifted off the nearby lake, and the scent of summer filled his senses.</p><p>The vision of Rogue\u2014he just couldn\u2019t see her as Caitlyn\u2014filled his head, no matter how hard he tried to push it back. He was thirty-two years old, a grown man next to her tender twenty-one. She was so damned tiny she made a man second think his own strength and so damned innocent that all a man could think about was being the one to teach her how to sin.</p><p>Someone else would have to teach her, he thought, if someone hadn\u2019t already. He was staying just as far away from that land mine as possible. She would be the one woman that would tempt him. If he dared to touch her, if he even considered taking her, he\u2019d never be able to give her only a part of himself. And because of that, he could never have her. There wasn\u2019t enough left of him to give, sometimes he felt as though he had never completely found himself and never would until the demons of his past were destroyed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Securing that end wouldn\u2019t be easy, he had known that from the beginning. Navigating the waters of deceit could come with a very high price. It was hard enough protecting his young son from it; he couldn\u2019t deal with protecting a woman as well.</p><p>Vanquishing those enemies meant doing the job alone. And until one little schoolteacher with violet eyes, he hadn\u2019t minded paying the price.</p><p>ONE</p> <p>Present day</p><p>Sheriff Zeke Mayes stepped into the squalid mobilehome and grimaced at the scent of blood and death that filled it. The rusted metal of the mobile home outside gave only a hint of the depressing interior. No more than twelve by forty, the tiny home was littered with refuse, old dishes, old food, stale whisky and tobacco, and congealing blood and brain matter scattered across the walls and threadbare, dingy carpets.</p><p>Old beer, food, and vomit stains spotted the floors where used newspapers, dishes, and dirty clothes hadn\u2019t been thrown. It was a damned mess. And right in the middle of it was the bigger mess.</p><p>\u201cHell.\u201d He stepped farther in, careful to steer well clear of the body laid out on the floor.</p><p>\u201cGet forensics in here, Gene, and call the coroner.\u201d</p> <p>Deputy Gene Maynard looked around the room with a confused frown. From the gun still clenched in one of the dead men\u2019s hands to the brain matter splattered around the floor.</p><p>\u201cForensics? Hell, Zeke, this ain\u2019t no homicide. These boys done done themselves in,\u201d he spat in disgust. \u201cYou pull forensics out here and Alex Jansen is gonna piss down his leg for you tying up his boys that way.\u201d</p><p>Zeke turned and stared at the deputy. Some days, Gene liked to think he knew Zeke\u2019s job better than Zeke did. Zeke stared back at him silently, daring him not to do as he was told. It would be a simple matter at this point to suspend him. Hell, it might speed things up, even if it would garner more suspicion than Zeke needed.</p><p>Gene sighed, gave a quick nod of his dark-haired head, then left the trailer and loped back to the cruiser he\u2019d arrived in to make the call. Zeke turned back and stared at the mess once again. Yeah, it looked like just what it could have been. One brother killing the other, then killing himself, but maybe that was the problem, it looked too much like it. And the Walker boys might have been trouble more often than not, but this just didn\u2019t sit right in his gut. It resembled too closely several other unsolved crimes over the past ten years and pinched his gut with warning.</p><p>Hell, he hadn\u2019t expected this when he\u2019d answered the call earlier from the sister of these two men, asking if the sheriff would check up on them. Lisa Walker was stuck in Louisville looking after their grandmother in the hospital and needed some things from the old woman\u2019s house. She was trying to get hold of Joe or Jaime to bring them to her and the phone here had stayed busy through the weekend.</p><p>Zeke stared around the room, found the phone by the recliner, and narrowed his eyes at the old-fashioned base. The receiver was off the hook, barely showing beneath the newspaper laying over it.</p> <p>Joe and Jaime Walker weren\u2019t exactly scions of the community. They were irritants sometimes, normally harmless, fun-loving country boys. Joe worked at a lube and oil in town and Jaime worked whenever the mood hit him, wherever he could get a job at the time. And for the past few years they\u2019d been supplying Zeke with information pertinent to a group of homeland terrorists that had been disbanded the year before.</p><p>This wasn\u2019t a murder-suicide, and Zeke knew it; he could feel it.</p><p>Jaime was sprawled in a dilapidated easy chair in front of the silent television set, a neat little hole in the center of his head. Dark hair feathered over his brow and framed his handsome face. Once bright, laughing blue eyes were blank and cold in death, but his expression seemed surprised.</p><p>His muscular arms rested on the chair, blood stained his white T-shirt. He was still dressed in jeans and boots; he hadn\u2019t settled in for the night, perhaps preparing to leave later.</p><p>The television was turned off. Zeke stared at it, then at the television remote laying on the floor by the recliner. There was a half-empty bottle of beer there, too.</p><p>Joe Walker was crumbled to the floor, the back of his head blown to bits. His face was in profile, and horror seemed to crease it.</p><p>He, too, was dressed in well-pressed jeans and a white shirt, boots on his feet. The boys had meant to go out, Zeke thought. They were dressed for a Saturday night on the town.</p><p>They hadn\u2019t made it out last night though. For some reason, it appeared one brother had killed the other, then himself. Gray matter and blood stained the floor and walls and the reek of death was stifling.</p> <p>Son of a bitch.</p><p>\u201cThey finally offed each other.\u201d Gene stepped back into the doorway and stared at the wasted corpses. \u201cThey were fighting at the Walker bar just outside of town Thursday night over some woman. Rogue had a few of the bouncers toss them out and send them on their way.\u201d</p><p>Zeke turned to stare at the deputy coolly. \u201cDoes offing each other fit either man\u2019s personality, Gene?\u201d</p><p>It looked as though Joe had stepped inside, closed the door, and shot his brother, then himself. A murder-suicide. Simple and not really unusual. It happened, too damned often. But that wasn\u2019t what had happened here.</p><p>\u201cLooks to me like ole Joe finally had enough of Jaime stealing his women.\u201d Gene sighed and shook his head. \u201cThose boys never did amount to much despite Calvin Walker tryin\u2019 to send them through school. They graduated but never did do much else, did they?\u201d</p><p>Zeke held his tongue there. He didn\u2019t know what Calvin Walker had done for his distant cousins any more than he knew why the hell he left his daughter, Rogue, to suffer in that damned bar outside of town. It wasn\u2019t any of his business, either, Zeke told himself, other than asking the necessary questions to close this case.</p><p>He stared around again and shook his head. Hell, Joe and Jaime had been tight.</p><p>Fraternal twins rather than identical, but still, damned close in looks and with each other. The girls loved them. Young, old, or married, it didn\u2019t make a difference. The Walker twins were laid-back, easygoing, laughing, and as thick as thieves. Poke at one brother and you might as well poke at the other. And yes, they were known to fight over their women, but never in a serious way.</p><p>This just didn\u2019t make sense.</p><p>\u201cForensics is pulling up, coroner is behind him. Looks like the new chief of police is here to oversee how you\u2019re usin\u2019 his boys,\u201d Gene announced mockingly as Zeke stepped toward the open door and moved to the rickety front porch before heading toward the driveway.</p><p>Alex Jansen pulled in behind the forensic team and the coroner. The new chief of police was ex-military and damned sharp.</p><p>Zeke held up his hand, stopping the forensic team as Alex strode toward him. There was still the slightest limp in Alex\u2019s stride from a wound received during a mission in the Special Forces before he took over the job of chief of police, but the limp was growing less noticeable.</p><p>Dressed in a short-sleeved dark blue shirt, jeans, and boots, Alex looked like exactly what he was. An animal prowling in a man\u2019s body.</p><p>\u201cZeke.\u201d Alex extended his hand, his gray eyes concerned. \u201cWe got problems out here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeems I might have.\u201d Zeke pushed his hat back on his head as he stared around the sunlit meadow the Walker mobile home sat within. \u201cWalk in here with me. I need another set of eyes. We go as far as the door and that should be enough to keep from messing up your boys\u2019 area.\u201d</p><p>Alex nodded and followed behind him as Zeke led the way back to the trailer and then stood aside as Alex stepped into the doorway. Zeke didn\u2019t talk. Instead, he stood by the doorway, staring at the scene again.</p><p>\u201cImmaculate,\u201d Alex murmured, and Zeke knew Alex wasn\u2019t talking about the state of the habitation but rather the scene of the death itself. \u201cNo apparent hesitation on the shooter\u2019s part. Walked in, aimed, and shot. Jaime didn\u2019t fight, and neither did Joe.\u201d He turned to Zeke. \u201cAny sign of drugs?\u201d</p><p>Zeke shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m leaving that call up to your boys and the coroner. I\u2019m ordering an autopsy just to be sure. The rest.\u201d He just shook his head. \u201cDoesn\u2019t feel right, Alex.\u201d</p><p>Alex stared around again, his arms crossing over his chest, eyes narrowed. \u201cNo,\u201d he finally said slowly, carefully. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t feel right, but sometimes, it doesn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>And there wasn\u2019t a damned thing you could do about it, either, Zeke finished silently. It wouldn\u2019t be the first time someone had died in this county and the answers weren\u2019t there, and it wouldn\u2019t be the last. But this one was closer, it was more personal, despite the distance he tried to keep between himself and Rogue Walker, cousin to the two dead twins.</p><p>He moved back as Alex stepped outside and stared around the overgrown clearing. The Walkers\u2019 home sat in a small valley surrounded by oak, pine, elm, and dogwood. It was the end of April and spring was making itself known with a vengeance. It was already seventy, the sun beating down with blazing strength and heating the land around them.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get out of the way then.\u201d Alex sighed as they moved from the porch. \u201cForensics will do their job, see if they can get any answers for you.\u201d</p><p>Zeke almost breathed a sigh of relief. Alex\u2019s predecessor would cry and moan for weeks when he had to loan out the forensics team to the county.</p><p>\u201cThanks for the loan, Alex,\u201d he stated, watching his own words, his own responses.</p><p>Alex knew the same thing Zeke did. This was a murder, straight and simple, committed by a particular man, in a very particular manner.</p><p>\u201cNeed any help with this?\u201d Alex asked as they moved back to the parked vehicles.</p><p>Zeke shook his head, aware of Gene trailing them now.</p><p>\u201cNot yet. I\u2019ll keep you up-to-date on it though. Gene said there was rumor the boys were fighting at the bar the other night. I\u2019ll head out there later and talk to Rogue.\u201d</p><p>Alex paused and stared back at Zeke, amusement suddenly gleaming in his eyes. \u201cShe\u2019s helping Janey at the restaurant,\u201d he informed Zeke then. \u201cHaven\u2019t you been picking her up lately?\u201d</p><p>Zeke lifted his hand and rubbed at the back of his neck. Rogue was a sore spot with him; it was one of the reasons he hated finding Joe and Jaime as he had. Those boys were favorites of hers, and damned if someone wasn\u2019t going to start wondering if Zeke was spending precious county money because of the rumors that were drifting through town that the sheriff and the bar owner were sniffing around each other.</p><p>\u201cNot lately,\u201d he finally admitted. \u201cThe warmer nights, she\u2019s been riding her Harley in.\u201d</p><p>That didn\u2019t mean he didn\u2019t check up on the leather-wearing, motorcycle-riding hellion as often as he found time to do so.</p><p>Hell, he hated admitting that he missed those late night calls, just as he came off duty, requesting a ride from the restaurant where she was helping Alex\u2019s lover back to the bar she owned. The woman was a managerial whiz kid, yet she had come here as a high school mathematics teacher five years before.</p><p>She was an enigma to him. She messed his head up every damned chance she had, and he wasn\u2019t a man that liked having to question parts of himself that he had never questioned before. He\u2019d made a decision before he returned to Kentucky, and now he had no choice but to stick with it. Until this was finished, there was no time for the emotions Rogue Walker inspired in him. There was no time for love.</p><p>And what the hell was he doing thinking about love? He was eleven years older than the spritely little hellion and ages older in experience. The last thing he needed was to allow his heart to get mixed up in the roller-coaster ride he\u2019d have with her.</p><p>\u201cLet me know if you need any help then.\u201d Alex nodded. \u201cRogue works tonight and then the next two afternoons at the restaurant if you\u2019re wondering about her schedule.\u201d</p><p>A mocking smile tilted Alex\u2019s lips as Zeke stared back at him silently. He didn\u2019t have a damned word to say to that. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When Janey had opened the restaurant to six nights rather than four, Rogue had signed on to help her with it until she could find a dependable manager.</p><p>Alex chuckled, moved to his car, and slid inside before putting the vehicle in gear and driving off. Turning, Zeke surveyed the vehicles in the meadow and watched as his deputy loped back to him.</p><p>\u201cCoroner is ready to collect the bodies and forensics is ready to release them. You ready?\u201d There was the slightest sarcasm to Gene\u2019s voice.</p> <p>\u201cTone down the sarcasm, Gene, you\u2019re pissing me off,\u201d Zeke told him. \u201cIf you have a problem with how I run my office, then say so up front.\u201d</p><p>Gene\u2019s lips tightened as he glared back at Zeke. \u201cYou\u2019re turning into an asshole, Zeke,\u201d</p><p>he accused him. \u201cYou\u2019re throwing away good taxpayer money on a cut-and-dried case of murder-suicide. You act like those Walkers are scions of the county and you have proof of murder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re citizens of this county, and they paid their tax dollars,\u201d Zeke informed him. \u201cI figure we can allot a certain amount of it on making certain what happened here; what do you think?\u201d</p><p>Gene was one twitch of the lip shy of a sneer. \u201cWell, you obviously don\u2019t need me here wasting my time, too. I\u2019ll head back to the office while you oversee this.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ll head out on patrol,\u201d Zeke told him softly. \u201cI have this to take care of. File your report before you go off duty, and I\u2019ll check it over when I come in later.\u201d</p><p>Gene\u2019s blue eyes glittered for the barest second with calculation. \u201cGonna go question that Walker girl? She\u2019s family to this rat trash, Zeke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnother word and you\u2019re going to regret it,\u201d Zeke snapped. \u201cHaul your ass out of here and get on patrol. I don\u2019t need your advice or your opinion on the Walkers or this investigation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMurder-suicide doesn\u2019t constitute an investigation,\u201d Gene argued, his face flushing beneath the hot spring sunlight. \u201cSon of a bitch, Zeke. Just \u2019cause you have a thing for Rogue Walker don\u2019t mean her family ain\u2019t still gutter shit.\u201d</p><p>A thing for Rogue Walker. There it was, that knowledge that obviously someone had mistaken his friendship with Rogue for something more than what it was. Simple friendship, he told himself.</p><p>So why the hell was he forcing himself to hold back, to keep from curling his fists and plowing them into his deputy\u2019s sneering face?</p> <p>\u201cYou need to take a few days off,\u201d Zeke said carefully. \u201cSeveral actually. Until you can rein in your mouth, Gene. I\u2019ll file the papers when I get back to the office. Maybe, in a few days, we can discuss your problems with how I run my department and my life and whether or not you can keep your damned nose out of it.\u201d</p><p>Otherwise, the man was going to be sporting a broken nose. Before he could follow through with that thought, Zeke strode away from his deputy and headed to the trailer, where the coroner was having the bodies removed.</p><p>It was a damned shame, Zeke thought. Those two boys, as wild as they were, weren\u2019t the murder-suicide type. For the most part, Walkers were just ornery. Not lazy so much as fun loving and laid-back. They played hard, worked as much as they had to, and had fun. They weren\u2019t troublemakers, and they weren\u2019t violent. But they were valuable sources on a silent investigation that was still ongoing. And they had been murdered.</p><p>\u201cSheriff.\u201d The coroner, Jay Adams, nodded as Zeke stepped up to him. \u201cI\u2019ll autopsy, just to be sure drugs didn\u2019t play a part, but it looks pretty conclusive in there.\u201d</p><p>Jay was middle-aged with a full shock of bright gray hair and thick gray brows. His weathered face was creased with laugh lines and his hazel eyes were somber. He\u2019d been coroner as long as Zeke had been sheriff, and he was damned good at his job.</p><p>\u201cI appreciate it, Jay.\u201d Zeke nodded as he watched the assistants load the bodies into the coroner\u2019s hearse.</p><p>\u201cThink we need to pull in the coroner\u2019s investigator from the city?\u201d Jay asked then. \u201cWe could transport to their facilities. I could get you more information.\u201d</p><p>Zeke crossed his arms over his chest and rubbed at his jaw for long moments before nodding. \u201cI\u2019ll clear it through the chief.\u201d Alex wouldn\u2019t argue the decision; he knew as well as Zeke did what they were looking at. \u201cTransport to their facilities and see what we can get.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYour gut is working on this one, huh?\u201d Jay grunted. \u201cHate it when it does that, Zeke.</p><p>Means we\u2019re gonna end up squabbling with city hall. You know how they like to mess with things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know,\u201d Zeke breathed out roughly, wishing he could trust Jay, that he could discuss his suspicions with the older man. \u201cBut like you said, my gut is burning, Jay, and I don\u2019t like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEh. That looked a little suspicious to me anyway.\u201d Jay suddenly grinned. \u201cHell, you know a body just ain\u2019t gonna sit there when someone jumps in the room with a gun.</p><p>And you know, between here and town, I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll consider the fact that something doesn\u2019t look right about those wounds. They can\u2019t naysay me like they can you.\u201d</p><p>Favor given, favor owed. \u201cYou got it, Jay.\u201d He clapped the other man on the shoulder.</p><p>\u201cLet me know how I can return the favor. I\u2019ll be waiting on your report.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll try to be quick about it,\u201d Jay drawled. \u201cHelps though when the city coroner happens to be your daughter, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t hurt a bit,\u201d Zeke agreed with a small chuckle before turning his attention back to the mobile home.</p><p>He\u2019d wait until forensics cleared out before going through it himself and feeling the area. Not just investigating it, but feeling it, just to be certain it was the work of the same man that had committed countless other murders in the county over the past twenty-odd years.</p><p>Maybe it was him more than the case that had him reluctant to leave and begin the investigation, he thought as the forensics team began to file out. This case meant going to Rogue when he hadn\u2019t seen her in over a month, hell, nearly two months. Not since the warmer spring air had descended on the mountains and she had started riding the Harley to the restaurant. And he hated admitting that he missed those few nights a week he had been driving her back to the bar each night. Missed her teasing and her laughter when he had no right to it.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t looking forward to telling her about Joe and Jaime. He didn\u2019t like lying to Rogue, and he had no choice but to hide certain information from her. Information such as the fact that her cousins had been gathering information for him and Homeland Security special agent Timothy Cranston. Information such as the fact that he knew to the soles of his feet that the boys had been murdered by the same man that had killed Zeke\u2019s wife and his father. The same man that Homeland Security has been searching for since the arrest and deaths of Dayle Mackay and Nadine Grace.</p><p>The man known only as the exterminator. The backbone of the Freedom League. A man that killed without conscience, without mercy, and without a trace.</p><p>TWO</p><p>Murder-suicide?</p><p>It wasn\u2019t possible.</p><p>Rogue sat in a back corner of her bar, stared at the dancers, the drinkers, the bikers, and the good ole country boys and girls that filled the establishment she simply called the Bar. That was what it was. Just a bar. A dance hall. A place to drink. It was the place Nadine Grace and Dayle Mackay\u2019s lackey had drugged her drink almost five years before.</p><p>The pieces she had put together over the years suggested the couple in the photos had helped her home. So nice of them. Then they proceeded to let Nadine and Dayle into her home where those pictures had been taken.</p><p>She had identified the couple within a year. Her father\u2019s friend Jonesy had quietly taken care of making certain that particular couple never came to Somerset again. Something about a drug buy that the police had received a tip on, and a hell of a long sentence for both of them. But her father hadn\u2019t found out, as far as Rogue knew. Of course, Jonesy, her father\u2019s friend and then Rogue\u2019s, had promised her he would make sure her father didn\u2019t know. How he had managed it, she didn\u2019t know. She was just thankful he had.</p><p>And the Bar was home now. She owned it. Her father had owned it before her, his last tie to the county that had seen him as nothing but white trash. They saw her as something even less, she sometimes thought. Like they saw the rest of the Walker clan, like Joe and Jaime.</p><p>Running a scarlet fingernail around the lip of the whisky glass in front of her, she tried to beat down the knowledge that here, in this county, the name Walker was, as her father had warned her, well less than sterling. Shiftless was one description. Thieves and gutter trash was another. But Rogue knew her family. Family like Joe and Jaime.</p><p>They had been filled with laughter, charm. They had a sense of fun inside them that didn\u2019t correlate to the nine-to-five lifestyle others held so highly.</p><p>Jaime was steady in his friendships, his laughter. He liked to get drunk and raise a little hell on Saturday nights, and he loved women. Joe had been just like him. Neither of the two men had a cruel or mean bone in their bodies. They weren\u2019t conniving and they had never stolen a thing in their lives.</p><p>And now, they were gone.</p><p>She had been at the hospital when their sister, Lisa, had told Grandmother Walker that the boys were dead. A light had gone out in the old woman\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cHey, Rogue.\u201d</p><p>Her head lifted at the sound of her bartender\u2019s voice at her side. Lifting her gaze, she met Jonesy\u2019s compassionate look.</p><p>Jonesy eased his burly body into the seat beside her, his hazel eyes somber as he watched her.</p><p>She liked Danny \u201cJonesy\u201d Jones. A biker with a heart of gold, a mean-assed temper, and a head like a brick. An accident had cut back on his cycling and given him a limp, but he was still as tough and as no- nonsense as he had been when she first met him five years ago.</p><p>\u201cKent watching the bar?\u201d She looked over to the long teak counter filled with customers.</p><p>\u201cKent and that new girl, Lea. She\u2019s a good \u2019tender.\u201d</p><p>Rogue nodded. Lifting her shot glass she tossed back the aged whisky, let her lashes flutter at the burn, then placed the glass back on the scarred table.</p><p>\u201cGot a call,\u201d he told her then. \u201cAlex Jansen\u2019s fianc\u00e9e. Said to tell you the sheriff is heading this way. She\u2019s worried \u2019bout you. Asked that you call her tonight.\u201d</p><p>See, that was the problem with friends, they wanted to know every damned thing.</p><p>Where your head was, where it was going, what you were thinking, and what you were feeling. She\u2019d made the mistake of making friends with Janey Mackay and her sister-in-law, Chaya, last year. Big mistake. Never mess with Mackays, she reminded herself.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call her back later.\u201d She shrugged.</p><p>\u201cSheriff will be here soon.\u201d His thick forearms crossed on top of the table. \u201cZeke ain\u2019t no man\u2019s fool, Rogue. Or no woman\u2019s. If he\u2019s askin\u2019 questions, then something\u2019s wrong.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head at that. \u201cNo. He\u2019s just making sure. He\u2019s anal like that, Jonesy.\u201d</p><p>She poured herself another drink, sipped at the liquid this time, and stared into the full dance floor. Normally, she would have been out there herself, dancing, laughing, pretending. Always pretending.</p><p>\u201cThey were good boys, Rogue.\u201d He patted her hand awkwardly and scowled down at her. \u201cYou did your best for them, girl, even when I told you they were gonna come to a bad end with all their womanizing. You can\u2019t ask more than that from yourself.</p><p>Whatever happened up there with them, it\u2019s not on your shoulders.\u201d</p><p>Maybe she hadn\u2019t done enough. Joe and Jaime with their laughter and their devil- may-care attitudes. Maybe she had missed something, been too busy, too self-involved to see something that could have saved them. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She couldn\u2019t figure it out. She just couldn\u2019t make it make sense. That was why she was sitting here at a dark table staring into the smoky atmosphere of her bar rather than scandalizing the county as a hostess at the most exclusive and notorious restaurant in the town, Mackay\u2019s. She was here instead, hiding, hiding from the false condolences and the questions she knew she would receive elsewhere.</p><p>She was a Walker. White trash, gutter-guzzling sleaze was but one of the nicer descriptions she\u2019d heard. She\u2019d laughed in public over it, sometimes; she shed tears in private and wondered why the hell she stayed.</p><p>Pulaski County wasn\u2019t the center of the universe, she had told herself countless nights.</p> <p>She could return to Boston, teach anywhere she wanted to teach, and escape the mountain-bred hypocrisy and cruelties she had known here. But even in Boston, she had never fit in.</p><p>And Boston didn\u2019t have Sheriff Zeke Mayes.</p><p>God, she was such a fool. If any man had ever proven he had no intention of touching her, then it was Sheriff Mayes. He stared at her sometimes as though the very thought of being around her was horrifying. And then there were times, times his brown eyes had darkened further, his lashes had lowered, and she could see the hunger he thought he was hiding from her.</p><p>There were times she wanted to crawl into him and just lay against him. Nights she dreamed of being wrapped in those strong, muscular arms. And there were nights she actually faced the truth that even if it ever happened, it would never last. And she wondered which was worse. Never having? Or having and losing?</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re worryin\u2019 me, girl,\u201d Jonesy finally said with a sigh. \u201cSit-tin\u2019 around drinkin\u2019 and reflectin\u2019 ain\u2019t your way. Remember that? You don\u2019t mope and feel sorry for yourself; we taught you better than that, remember?\u201d</p> <p>Her lips tilted. \u201cThey.\u201d The little mountain bikers\u2019 club that didn\u2019t even have a name.</p><p>Thirteen overgrown teenagers in men\u2019s and women\u2019s bodies who had known her father at one time or another rallied around her and taught the too-soft little schoolteacher how to be the rogue she had been named for.</p><p>They had been regulars at the bar. They had seen the couple she had left with that night, and they had helped her plot her vengeance against them. They had sheltered her for the first year beneath their protection, and they had taught her how to be tough. How to fight. How to laugh at the insults, and how to grow up.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, Jonesy,\u201d she promised him. \u201cJust a little mellow.\u201d</p><p>She sipped at the whisky. She didn\u2019t drink it often. It took a certain mood, a certain anger to allow her to enjoy liquor. She was a beer girl, until the anger overflowed her control and she had to face more than she wanted to face.</p><p>\u201cA little too mellow to be facing that sheriff.\u201d Jonesy pulled the whisky bottle out of her reach with a temperamental scowl. \u201cYou never face your enemy weak, girl. I taught you better than that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cZeke\u2019s not my enemy.\u201d But she didn\u2019t reach for the bottle again.</p><p>Zeke wasn\u2019t her enemy, but he was her weakness. He made everything inside her weak, made her ache and heat, and made her wish for things that she knew she couldn\u2019t have.</p><p>\u201cSheriff Mayes is gonna break your heart,\u201d Jonesy warned her with a hint of anger.</p><p>\u201cPull yourself up here now. He\u2019s gonna be here soon, and you don\u2019t want to see him while you\u2019re feeling sorry for yourself and missin\u2019 those boys.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, almost smiling. That was Jonesy. Never let them see you bleed.</p><p>And she was bleeding. She could feel it, from a wound inside her heart that she couldn\u2019t seem to close.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cJoe wouldn\u2019t shoot Jaime,\u201d she said softly. \u201cNeither of those boys would have ever hurt each other, Jonesy, let alone anyone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf there\u2019s something more involved, then I have no doubt Sheriff Mayes will find it, girl,\u201d he grumbled, his voice becoming more fierce. \u201cCome on, Rogue. He\u2019ll be here any minute. Pull yourself out of this or you\u2019re gonna hate yourself in the morning. You know how you always end up kicking yourself whenever you let Mayes see you weak.\u201d</p> <p>She was always weak around Zeke. It was a fact of life. Like taxes and breathing.</p><p>\u201cGo tend the bar, Jonesy.\u201d She sighed. \u201cI\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>Jonesy stared at her for long, silent moments. Rogue could feel his worry and his anger.</p><p>Jonesy always worried about her, and it always managed to piss him off. And tonight after he closed up, he\u2019d probably call her father, and her parents would worry then, too.</p><p>If she wasn\u2019t careful, her father would end up on her doorstep and then talk about stirring up some stink. The closest he\u2019d come to Somerset since leaving it so long ago was Louisville. She always met him there. God help her if he ever actually came here.</p><p>Jonesy rose to his feet. His heavy hand gripped her shoulder for a second in a tender hold before he heaved out a hard breath and moved through the crowd, back to his bar.</p><p>Zeke was coming, and she was weak. He would be here soon, and she felt lost and alone and uncertain. She hated feeling that way; she avoided him at all costs when she felt that way, because she wanted nothing more than to curl against his broad chest and make all the darkness that seemed to surround her go away.</p><p>As though he could do that.</p><p>She finished the whisky in the glass, capped the bottle, and motioned to the waitress to take it away before rising to her feet.</p><p>Four-inch heels were like a second skin to her feet. Vivid red to match the scalloped lace edges of the scarlet camisole she wore beneath her black sleeveless leather vest. It was paired with a short leather skirt that showed off her legs and flashed her upper thighs.</p><p>Flipping back the riotous red gold curls that flowed over her shoulder, she drew in a hard breath and made her way across the bar to the door that led back to the kitchens and the steps to her upstairs apartment.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t facing Zeke while the customers of the Bar watched on. Jonesy would direct him upstairs.</p><p>Would he come in uniform, she wondered? Or in those thigh-hugging jeans and loose shirts that always made her mouth water? She wanted to strip him so damned badly she could barely breathe for the need when he was out of uniform.</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to even consider what he did to her when he was in uniform. She tried to ignore the wicked little urges she had then, because it was a hell of a lot worse than without the uniform.</p><p>Maybe it had something to do with those handcuffs hanging on the side of his belt, she thought mockingly as she made her way up the stairs to her apartment. Yeah, had to be those handcuffs. She had some interesting fantasies where those were concerned.</p><p>Unlocking her apartment, she pushed it open and stepped inside. The lights were on.</p><p>She left them on because she didn\u2019t like the dark. She and her friend Janey Mackay were a lot alike in that regard. The dark was a lonely place to be for Rogue.</p><p>The large, open living room and kitchen greeted her. Spotlessly clean, because she really didn\u2019t spend much time in her so-called home. The dark brown leather couch and chairs were comfortable; the scarred coffee table was an antique she hadn\u2019t had time to refinish. Or perhaps just hadn\u2019t made time. There was something about those scars of time on it that appealed to her.</p><p>The double doors into her bedroom were open, a low light on her bed stand shining into the room. And it was quiet. So quiet.</p><p>Maybe she needed a cat. A cat would at least meow at her when she came in, or so Janey had assured her.</p><p>Shaking her head, she paced over to the tall, wide windows and drew a curtain back enough to stare into the parking lot below. Just in time to watch Zeke Mayes pull into the lot in the full-sized farm pickup he drove when he wasn\u2019t on duty.</p><p>Hell. He was going to be in civilian clothes.</p><p>She watched closely as he parked, opened the door, and stepped out beneath one of the bright lights shining overhead. Her mouth watered.</p><p>A long-sleeved white button-up shirt was tucked into snug jeans. She thought he might be wearing boots. There was the glint of his badge on the pocket of his jeans. He wore it like that sometimes, and she thought it was the sexiest damned thing she had ever seen.</p><p>She wondered where his handcuffs were.</p><p>Her fingers clenched on the material of the curtains as she felt herself heat at the sight of him. She might be a virgin, but she knew all the signs of arousal and a night that was most likely going to involve toys of some sort.</p><p>Her clit was swollen, the bare folds of her sex felt flushed and damp. Her nipples were peaking beneath the camisole and vest, and she could feel that nervous little flutter attacking her stomach and thighs. Just the sight of him was enough to sensitize her body.</p><p>It was lust. Lust was a powerful force, she reminded herself. It couldn\u2019t have anything to do with the need to just curl into his arms and rest there. That was weakness, not lust.</p><p>It was loneliness. She had separated herself from most friendships, she hadn\u2019t allowed herself a lover because she couldn\u2019t have the lover she wanted. So comfort wasn\u2019t something she knew a lot about. But it was something she missed more often than not.</p><p>Running her hands down the sides of her skirt, Rogue pulled back from the window and drew in a deep, hard breath. She could almost feel him moving closer. Through the bar, his shoulders brushing against the women who would crowd closer, just to feel the heat and hardness of his corded, muscular body.</p><p>She closed her eyes, remembering the feel of him herself. The way his body seemed to wrap around her when he almost, just almost brushed against her. Zeke always made certain he didn\u2019t actually touch her unless he had no choice.</p><p>The jarring ring of the phone had her eyes jerking open. Frowning, she pulled the cell phone from the clip at her side and flipped it open after checking the number.</p><p>\u201cYeah, Jonesy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSheriff wants to talk to you,\u201d he growled. \u201cYou in?\u201d</p><p>Her lips almost twitched at his protectiveness. \u201cYes, Jonesy. Send him on up.\u201d</p><p>Jonesy grunted and she could almost see the wrinkles in his brow as he frowned.</p><p>Flipping the phone closed, she laid it on the table by the couch and moved to the door.</p><p>She opened it, pulled it wide, and moved back to the kitchen for a bottle of water.</p><p>Something to do with herself as she waited. To calm herself, to settle her vulnerabilities until she could reestablish her shields.</p><p>Joe and Jaime\u2019s deaths had thrown her. It had left her drifting, uncertain, questioning too many things in her life. The twins were two of the few people she had allowed herself to care for in the past years. She kept most people at a distance simply so they couldn\u2019t hurt her, so they couldn\u2019t be used against her to hurt her. It was easier that way. Easier on her heart and on her life.</p><p>Damn, she hadn\u2019t realized how much she had let herself care about people until today.</p><p>\u201cLeaving your door open like this could be dangerous.\u201d Zeke\u2019s dark voice filled the room as she reached inside the fridge for the bottle of water.</p><p>She paused, closed her eyes, and took in a deep, hard breath before clenching the water and pulling back. She turned to face him, letting the fridge door close as her eyes met his.</p><p>They were eagle fierce in his sun-darkened face. His dark brown hair was cut short, almost military short. There was the lightest sprinkling of gray at his temples. It was sexy.</p><p>Those damned jeans molded to his thighs. The fabric of his shirt was just a little loose but did nothing to hide the power of his broad chest and shoulders. And yes, he was wearing boots. Scarred work boots. The kind that just made a man\u2019s legs look strong and sturdy.</p><p>\u201cI knew you were coming up.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cClose the door behind you.\u201d</p><p>He stood there, staring at her.</p><p>\u201cUnless you\u2019re scared to be alone here with me.\u201d She moved slowly through the kitchen area to the living room. \u201cAfraid your reputation will suffer, Sheriff?\u201d</p><p>His lips quirked. Rogue watched as his arm reached out, his fingers gripped the doorknob, and he closed the door slowly. A second later, those lean fingers flipped the locks in place without his gaze ever leaving hers. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo brave.\u201d She pretended to shiver. \u201cYou\u2019re living dangerously this week.\u201d</p><p>He stared back at her the way he usually did unless she pushed him. As though he were on the edge of being bored with her. Damn him. She didn\u2019t bore him. She made him hard. He was filling those damned jeans out in ways she knew they weren\u2019t meant to be filled. That was not boredom.</p><p>\u201cYou heard about Joe and Jaime,\u201d he stated as he moved farther into the room. \u201cI tried to find time to come out and tell you myself, but I was tied up with forensics and city hall.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot a problem.\u201d She shrugged as she twisted the cap off the water. \u201cI\u2019m sure I heard about it before the coroner ever had the bodies loaded and ready to go. Your deputy likes to run his mouth, Sheriff. Seems he thinks trailer trash like the Walkers don\u2019t warrant a forensics team. Bad blood showing and all that. Why should the city waste its money on two men that just got what they deserved.\u201d</p><p>His lips thinned. Anger perhaps. Irritation definitely as he strode to where she stood.</p><p>\u201cSit down, Rogue. I\u2019ll deal with my deputy and city hall. Until then, I\u2019d like to figure out what the hell happened with Joe and Jaime.\u201d</p><p>She sat down on the couch and would have laughed in mocking amusement when he took the chair beside her, except the disappointment went too deep. She would have felt his warmth if he had sat on the couch. And she felt cold inside. For some reason, she felt lost. As though she had traveled too far and too long from some vision of security and now found herself deep in unfamiliar territory.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry about Joe and Jaime, Rogue.\u201d Zeke sighed then, rubbing his hand over the back of his neck. \u201cI know those boys were closer to you than most folks knew. That\u2019s why I need to talk to you. See if you can help me figure out what happened.\u201d</p> <p>Rogue slid the high heels from her feet and folded her legs beneath her. No sense in worrying about whether or not her legs looked nice in front of Zeke right now. He was keeping his gaze firmly on her face. Besides, feeling sexy and being reminded of why he was here didn\u2019t go hand in hand.</p><p>\u201cJoe wouldn\u2019t have killed Jaime,\u201d she told him with a firm shake of her head. \u201cJoe and Jaime were too close, Zeke. They might have fought over a woman every now and then, or anything else, but they would have never hurt each other. Not for anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about drugs?\u201d He leaned forward and stared back at her in demand. A demand for the truth, as though she would lie to him.</p><p>\u201cThey didn\u2019t have the money for drugs,\u201d she told him. \u201cA little pot every now and then, sure. But not the hard stuff. They didn\u2019t touch hard drugs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut they did smoke pot?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cProbably.\u201d She lifted her shoulders. \u201cI never saw them do it, but I assumed they did from a few jokes they\u2019ve made over the years. I never saw any evidence of it though.</p> <p>The most I\u2019ve seen was a few too many beers and a little brawl here and there over a girl. They usually made a few swings at each other, started laughing, and then headed home with the girl together. They were like that. Nothing was serious for too long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about enemies?\u201d Zeke asked. \u201cDid they have any you\u2019d believe would want to hurt them?\u201d</p><p>She stared back at him heavily. \u201cI can\u2019t think of a single enemy those two boys had. For all their womanizing, they were well liked. I never knew of anyone wanting to hurt them. And why ask that question if it\u2019s a cut-and-dried murder-suicide as your deputy believes?\u201d</p><p>She watched Zeke suspiciously now. Why the questions if he believed Joe had murdered Jaime, then killed himself?</p><p>\u201cThere was a murder, no matter what happened or why,\u201d Zeke told her. \u201cI need to figure out the what and the why to close this case, Rogue. I don\u2019t like questions left dangling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you have a hell of a question going on there,\u201d she told him. \u201cBecause I\u2019m telling you, Joe wouldn\u2019t hurt Jaime. He was the oldest twin. He was more protective toward Jaime. No one hurt Jaime that Joe didn\u2019t come running.\u201d</p><p>He still watched her closely, that somber gaze moving over her face, almost to her neck.</p><p>For a second, she had a feeling that he would have looked lower, but he didn\u2019t. He kept his gaze on her face, and that pissed her off.</p> <p>He was sitting here questioning her over her cousins\u2019 deaths, deaths he had to suspect couldn\u2019t have played out as it was made to look. He could have come to question her at any time, but he came late, after he was off duty, in plainclothes, and aroused.</p><p>Unlike him, she\u2019d had no problem looking below his neck. Or his waist. She sure as hell had no problem looking below his belt.</p><p>\u201cLook, Zeke, I can\u2019t tell you anything you obviously don\u2019t know already,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cI know Joe or Jaime\u2014neither one would have hurt the other. Whatever happened up there is bogus. It was a setup and I can\u2019t figure out why, because Joe and Jaime were a threat to no one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe thought you were a threat to no one last year when you were attacked as well,\u201d he reminded her. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t what you knew on Mackay and Grace that landed you in the hospital, Rogue, it was what they were afraid you knew. What could Joe have been afraid of that would have made him kill his brother and himself?\u201d</p><p>Last year she had managed to get herself twisted into a Homeland Security investigation into Nadine Grace and Dayle Mackay. As he\u2019d said, it wasn\u2019t what she had known but what Grace and Mackay thought she might have known that had been the problem. When the investigator, Dayle\u2019s son\u2019s lover, Chaya Dane, had questioned her, it had drawn Rogue within their sights once more.</p><p>She\u2019d spent a week in the hospital, bruised, with a cracked rib and a bruised skull, but she\u2019d come out of it alive.</p><p>\u201cSomeone else killed Joe and Jaime,\u201d she told him. \u201cGet that in your head, Zeke.</p><p>Someone set that scene up. Because I know to the soles of my feet neither of those boys would have hurt the other. It wasn\u2019t in them.\u201d</p><p>His jaw flexed, and his gaze jerked to her feet where they rested at the side of her body, then back to her face. How interesting.</p><p>God, he made her mad. Never more mad though than he was making her tonight. He was almost foaming at the mouth to touch her, as desperate for it as she was, and still, he denied both of them.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll keep checking things out,\u201d he told her. \u201cBut unless forensics or the coroner comes up with something, then murder-suicide is what we\u2019re looking at. And it damn sure looks as though Joe killed Jaime and then himself.\u201d</p><p>Her lips twisted mockingly. \u201cYeah, and there are pictures on the Internet that make me look like a world-class slut,\u201d she reminded him. \u201cTrust me, looks are incredibly deceiving.\u201d</p><p>His gaze darkened, though it never moved from her. Sometimes, she wondered exactly what was going on behind that fierce gaze. Hawklike light brown eyes that seemed to reflect shadows of emotions that she could never really decipher.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never seen the pictures,\u201d he finally said, surprising her.</p><p>Rogue\u2019s brow lifted. \u201cReally? You must be the only man in the county that hasn\u2019t managed to find them.\u201d</p><p>Zeke wasn\u2019t a man to lie, about anything.</p><p>\u201cI never went looking for them,\u201d he told her. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to see them, Rogue, because they didn\u2019t matter between you and me.\u201d</p><p>THREE</p><p>Of course they didn\u2019t. Those pictures, one way or theother, would never change the fact that he might want her, but he had no intention of touching her.</p><p>She\u2019d tested that theory over the winter. All the rides she\u2019d requested after the long hours she had put in at the Mackay restaurant. The nights she had invited him up for a drink or tried to linger in his vehicle to talk, to flirt. She\u2019d given up. She\u2019d let it go. She wasn\u2019t begging him.</p><p>She unfolded herself from the couch, reached down, and picked up her shoes before staring down at him.</p><p>\u201cDo you have any further questions, Zeke? It\u2019s late, I need a drink, and I was looking forward to a bubble bath. Honestly, I don\u2019t know what else I could tell you about Joe and Jaime that you don\u2019t already know. Or think you know.\u201d</p><p>And she couldn\u2019t handle being in the same room with him tonight. She wasn\u2019t as strong as she had been in the winter. Perhaps those winter months had weakened her. Hoping against hope each night that she had flirted her way into his car that something, anything, would come of it. Only to have her hopes dashed time and again.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re throwing me out?\u201d He tilted his head and looked up at her, his gaze flashing with a heat she was afraid to delve too deeply into. \u201cAfter weeks of trying to get me up here to your apartment, you\u2019re not even offering me a beer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m not. Good night, Zeke. Lock the door on your way out.\u201d</p><p>She turned and walked to the open bedroom door. She could feel his gaze on her, felt him watching her, his eyes burning into her. Suddenly, her skirt was too short, the vest flashed too much skin at her midriff and back. She felt exposed, vulnerable. She felt weak.</p><p>\u201cHell of a change, Rogue. You tried to seduce me half the winter. What happened?\u201d</p><p>She stopped and turned around slowly to see him standing, cocky, assured, confident.</p><p>\u201cI gave up,\u201d she replied shortly. \u201cAs you said, Itried to seduce you. You weren\u2019t willing.</p><p>I don\u2019t beg. End of story.\u201d</p><p>His expression tightened, a muscle jumping at his jaw as his gaze raked over her then.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re too damned young,\u201d he finally berated her, and perhaps himself as well, she thought. Or he was trying to convince himself.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m too damned tired to play games.\u201d It was all she could do to keep her shoulders straight and to fight back the tears. \u201cJoe and Jaime were family. This has hit me rather hard, and as you see\u201d\u2014she lifted her arms wide to encompass the empty apartment\u2014</p><p>\u201cit\u2019s just me and the bubble bath for comfort. I don\u2019t need to add games to tonight\u2019s stress if you don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>Zeke watched Rogue closely. He saw it then. That shadow in those deep violet eyes that had held his attention. A shadow he had never seen before. Loneliness. Loss. He knew that feeling. And in the past five years whenever it struck, it was Rogue that came to mind. Her smile, the promise of passion in her eyes, the need to touch her, the certainty that she could calm the beast that raged inside him.</p><p>Damn her. She\u2019d managed to worm her way into his life, there was no doubt of that.</p><p>He\u2019d missed her in the past few weeks since she had started riding her Harley to the restaurant rather than calling him and bumming a ride. Hell, he\u2019d more than missed it.</p><p>It was as though something were suddenly missing from his life. There was an emptiness where those hours lay now, a sense of waiting.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you have a lover, Rogue?\u201d He looked around the apartment. To his knowledge, as long as she had lived in Somerset, Rogue had never had a lover.</p><p>He didn\u2019t count the pictures that had ended up on the Internet. He\u2019d investigated that himself, and though he could never find proof, there was enough suspicion to prove to him that Rogue had been used somehow. Rumor was Nadine Grace and Dayle Mackay had targeted her when she had defended Zeke\u2019s son over a test at school. Nadine had never liked Shane because Zeke had refused to walk the same path his father had walked. Thad Mayes had held the position of sheriff for years, and through that time he had protected Dayle Mackay and the Freedom League\u2019s collective asses. He hadn\u2019t just protected them, he had been part of them. Zeke refused to follow that path, and Nadine had finally found a way to strike back, through Shane.</p><p>A month after standing up for his son, Rogue had left the bar with a strange couple. She hadn\u2019t been well known then; no one had thought to question her when she left. And then Rogue had been out of a job in the school system and the pictures had shown up on the Internet. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Oh, Zeke knew how Grace and Mackay had worked, he thought as he found himself moving across the room, his gaze drifting, again, to the scalloped lace that peeked over her leather vest.</p><p>Bra or camisole? he wondered. Probably one of those short little camisole things. Scarlet red and flirty. Just like the shoes she carried in her hand.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t answer me, Rogue,\u201d he reminded her. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you have a lover?\u201d</p> <p>And he wasn\u2019t certain he wanted to hear the answer to that question. The same reason perhaps that he didn\u2019t have a lover. Because he couldn\u2019t have Rogue.</p><p>\u201cDoes it matter why?\u201d She stood still, determined as he moved to her, stopping within a breath of touching distance.</p><p>He stared down at her, feeling things he knew he had no right to feel. Things he knew he shouldn\u2019t feel, not for this spritely little woman-child that was much too young for him.</p><p>He was playing a dangerous game tonight and he knew it. But he needed a taste of her.</p><p>Just enough to hold him over, to dampen the lust raging through him.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t play games with me, Zeke,\u201d she breathed out wearily. \u201cHonestly, I don\u2019t have time for them. I don\u2019t have the strength for them right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave I ever played games with you, Rogue?\u201d he asked, reaching out to touch her cheek, knowing, damn, he knew this was a mistake. The worst mistake he could possibly make right now. Because he couldn\u2019t follow through. He couldn\u2019t have her and revenge. It wasn\u2019t possible.</p><p>She didn\u2019t answer him. He could have used one of her smart remarks right now.</p><p>Something to remind himself that she was way too young. Twenty-six, even if it was almost twenty-seven, was too far from thirty-seven years old. Eleven years. Two years less than that which separated Alex Jansen and his fianc\u00e9e, Janey Mackay, Zeke thought. But just because Alex could handle it didn\u2019t mean Zeke could. Hell, his son, Shane, was nineteen. He was closer to Rogue\u2019s age than Zeke was.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t play games,\u201d she whispered, her expression softening, transforming, turning sensual, tempting.</p><p>Damn, the things he wanted to do to her. The ways he wanted to do them. He was here to question her about her cousins\u2019 deaths; instead, he found himself relishing the softness of her cheek. Skin like satin and silk combined. And as he looked, he realized it was all but devoid of makeup.</p> <p>She looked like a temptress with those violet eyes though. Those long, riotous red gold curls flowing around her, making a man wonder what it would be like to be bound within them.</p><p>\u201cThis is a bad idea.\u201d He sighed, lowering his head and allowing his rougher cheek to brush against hers. \u201cTell me to leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeave,\u201d she breathed as she softened against him.</p><p>He almost laughed. Damn her, she could make him laugh when no one else could.</p><p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t an order, Rogue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. It was supposed to be an order?\u201d A little, knowing smile tugged at her lips.</p><p>Oh yeah, she knew he wanted her until he ached with it. And she wanted. She wanted with the same hunger. He could see it in her eyes.</p><p>Her shoes dropped to the carpet, the light thud barely registering in his head. Hell, he could barely hear anything over the race of his own pulse and the thunder of lust in his veins.</p> <p>He let his lips skim her cheek. The need for her threatened to erode his control and his senses.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m leaving,\u201d he told her. \u201cThis is too damned dangerous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course it is.\u201d One small hand clenched on his upper arm. The fingers of the other were pressing against his stomach. She could feel his abs flexing; he could feel the warmth of her through the material of his shirt.</p><p>His cock pressed imperatively against his jeans. The hard throb was making him crazy.</p><p>It had made him crazy all evening. How much hell was one man supposed to endure before the hunger overrode control? he wondered. And what was it about this one woman that threatened his control?</p><p>He let his lips brush against the curls at the side of her face. They were soft, fragrant.</p><p>Like silk that smelled of dawn. He wanted to crush them between his fingers, hold her in place, and eat her up with kiss after kiss. He wanted to taste those lush, sensual lips.</p><p>He wanted to feel her tongue against his, hell, he wanted all of her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re teasing me.\u201d Her voice was weak, a hint of need quivering within it as she shifted closer to him. \u201cDon\u2019t tease me, Zeke. Kiss me, or let me go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re supposed to tell me to leave,\u201d he reminded her.</p><p>\u201cKiss me or leave. Do one or the other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKissing you would be a very bad idea.\u201d So why wasn\u2019t he stepping back? Why wasn\u2019t he letting her go? Instead, he was moving closer, one arm curling around her back as he gripped her jaw with his hand and lifted her head.</p><p>\u201cOr one of your better ideas,\u201d she retorted breathlessly.</p><p>He didn\u2019t give himself a chance to think, and he should have. He should have considered the consequences, and he damned sure should have considered the spark that blazed between them even when they weren\u2019t touching.</p><p>He should have considered it, because each time he did, he knew better than to draw closer to the fire. He knew better than to let his hunger get the best of him. But he didn\u2019t consider.</p><p>He brushed his lips over hers as they parted. Light as a whisper, he let himself feel her lips. He came back for a taste. The barest taste of that full lower lip, and it was ambrosia.</p><p>Nectar. It was the sweetest taste of flesh that he swore he had ever known. If he wasn\u2019t mistaken, there was the lightest flavor of his favorite drink that lingered there. The slightest hint of the dark, potent whisky he preferred.</p><p>\u201cZeke,\u201d she whispered his name against his lips. \u201cPlease. Don\u2019t tease.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t whimper, she didn\u2019t beg. It was a demand given in the tone of a woman who accepted that the tease might be all she would receive.</p><p>But the man wasn\u2019t teasing. Zeke didn\u2019t tease. He was almost as helpless in the grip of the sensuality weaving around them as she was in his hold. He lifted her closer, notching the hard width of his cock against her as he turned and pressed her into the wall, his lips parting, his tongue pressing between hers, his need controlling every objection his head was listing as he allowed himself to sink into her kiss.</p><p>Her arms were around his neck. Her legs lifted until her knees rode his hips, and hell, he was lost. He was barely aware of the fact that he was jerking her skirt over her hips.</p><p>Short-assed skirt. It tempted him. Teased him. Made his hands itch to jerk it up and see what she was wearing beneath.</p><p>Feeling what she was wearing worked, too. Or not feeling it. All he could find was the thinnest scrap of material running between the cheeks of her ass, a tiny triangle covering the hairless folds of her pussy.</p><p>He was doomed. He was going to hell. He was going to be flayed by the whips of guilt and remorse the second he managed to pull his lips from hers. So why the hell should he bother now? He could keep kissing her, kissing her until the guilt and remorse were burned away to cinders beneath the hunger that blazed out of control.</p><p>Because Rogue tasted as wild as her name, as free as sunshine. She was the promise of an eternal flame, the illusion of something he knew didn\u2019t exist. The illusion of true emotion. Because in this kiss there was more than pleasure. There was the darkness he held within him rising to the fore, and the fantasies he knew he had no business considering with this woman tempting his mind.</p><p>\u201cDamn you!\u201d He muttered the curse against her lips, because he couldn\u2019t get enough.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t taste enough of her, couldn\u2019t kiss her deep enough, wild enough. He couldn\u2019t press his jeans-covered dick tightly enough between her thighs, he couldn\u2019t feel her heat close enough. They were both damned. Because he couldn\u2019t stop. Because the feel of her, the sweetness of her was too much. She kissed like a dream, and God knew, he had given up on dreams years before.</p><p>\u201cDamn me?\u201d Rogue gasped, breathless, nearly panting as flaming little fingers of sensation raced over her body.</p><p>Her lips were swollen; she could feel their tenderness as his kisses moved from her lips to her jaw, to her neck. His lips caressed; he might have nipped with his teeth. She was certain he had. But oh God, his tongue. He was licking over her neck as though taking greedy, tiny tastes of her flesh. And between her thighs. His fingers were between her thighs, tucked beneath her rear as her knees gripped his hips, caressing, feathering over the silk triangle of the thong she wore. Caressing the damp material as her juices eased from her sex.</p><p>She could feel how slick she was, how wet. Her flesh was swollen, her clit throbbing.</p><p>Her pulse raced, adding to the sensitivity of her flesh, the ache of need between her thighs.</p><p>Moaning his name, her head fell back against the wall, her eyes closing as she felt his lips at the top of her breasts, above the scalloped edge of her camisole top. The top button of her vest eased open.</p><p>\u201cThis is insane.\u201d The words sounded torn from him.</p><p>Insane? It was the most pleasure she had ever known in her life.</p><p>\u201cDamn. Rogue. This has to stop.\u201d</p><p>She kept her eyes closed, her hands on his head, holding his lips right where they were, brushing between her breasts. The feel of them, like rough velvet stroking her, was a heady sensation.</p><p>She was going to have to let him go. She knew it. She could feel it. She was going to have to let him walk away and spend the night alone. Again. Without him. Without the comfort she needed, without the man she needed to hold on to.</p><p>She fought the tightening in her chest, her throat. The tears that wanted to fill her eyes and she held back, trapped inside her heart.</p><p>\u201cSo stop.\u201d Her head fell forward, her lips pressing against his forehead, her fingers still gripping his neck. \u201cAll you have to do is stop.\u201d</p><p>And kill her. And take away something she hadn\u2019t known she was missing until now.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t known how good it could be, how hot it could be. She hadn\u2019t known how his touch could send pleasure tearing not just through her body, but deeper, to that untouched core of her. To that part of her that had always held back, that had always remained aloof.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t aloof with Zeke. She wanted to beg. She wanted to plead with him not to stop, not to take the warmth away from her. Not to steal his touch when she had waited so damned long for it.</p><p>A second later, he was easing back from her. Rogue forced her knees to unclamp, forced herself to find her footing as he slowly, so slowly released her, then stepped back from her.</p><p>\u201cDid you get all you wanted?\u201d She resorted to sarcasm to keep from crying. \u201cIf so, as I said before, you know where the door is.\u201d</p><p>She turned, almost stumbled actually, to get away from him and find the relative comfort of her bedroom, her big bathtub, heated bubbles that in no way would replace his touch.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m too old for you, Rogue; you know that as well as I do.\u201d</p><p>A second later she found herself pulled against his chest, her back flush against him, absorbing his heat and his anger.</p><p>She shook her head slowly. \u201cIt\u2019s not the age, Zeke,\u201d she said softly. \u201cThat\u2019s your excuse.</p><p>Why don\u2019t you just admit it? Your reputation can\u2019t afford me, and we both know it.\u201d</p><p>Silence filled the air between them. She felt his fingers tighten at her hips, his chest expand behind her.</p><p>\u201cYou think I won\u2019t fuck you because you could hurt my reputation?\u201d There was an edge of mockery to his voice that was cutting. \u201cOh, Rogue, sweetheart, you have no damned idea how wrong you are. I won\u2019t fuck you, baby, because I know what no one else knows. I know exactly why a relationship with me would destroy both of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh really?\u201d She didn\u2019t see destruction. She saw the need, the aching, dark loneliness that no one else could help ease. A hunger that only Zeke could fulfill. That she had always known only Zeke could fulfill. \u201cAnd what is it that you think you know?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI know, Caitlyn Rogue, how very innocent you are next to me and what I know I\u2019ll end up taking from you. You\u2019re not a woman who will let a man fuck her for the emotionless pleasure of it. You\u2019re not a woman who could ever give what I need easily.</p><p>And you\u2019re not a woman a man can walk away from without regrets. You\u2019re too young for those regrets. And I\u2019m too damned old to want to see them strapped on you. Think about that. Remember that. Because the next time you invite me to your bed, you just might find more there than you expected.\u201d</p><p>If he expected her to take veiled threats and innuendo as an excuse, then he\u2019d better be thinking on that one again.</p> <p>She tossed him an angry little snarl as she jerked out of his arms.</p><p>\u201cWhat, Zeke, do you like to get frisky with your handcuffs?\u201d she snapped, turning on him and nearly bursting into flames at the look on his face. \u201cDo you like to play the big, bad sheriff when you fuck your women?\u201d</p><p>His lips quirked with an edge of amusement that she simply didn\u2019t appreciate. Almost a smile as those predatory brown eyes roved over the loosened front of the leather vest.</p><p>\u201cMe getting frisky with the handcuffs would be the least of your problems,\u201d he growled back at her, and she almost believed him.</p><p>She pretended to shiver. \u201cShould I whimper and beg for mercy?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cProbably.\u201d There was a grunt of laughter. \u201cOne thing is for damned sure, you\u2019d end up spanked. Does that smart mouth of yours ever stop?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly when I\u2019m kissing cowardly sheriffs with more excuses than handcuffs.\u201d She smiled tightly. \u201cGo home, Zeke. I\u2019m tired of playing with you tonight. I tell you what, the next time I\u2019m in the mood for a little slap and tickle I\u2019ll give you a call. Seems that\u2019s all you\u2019re willing to put out at any given time.\u201d</p><p>Oh, she was pissed. She glared back at him, seeing the amusement, the careful watchfulness he displayed. He thought he could walk into her home and just play the big, bad dominant lover throwing out his little warnings? Who the hell was he this week? The dom from hell? Bullshit. She\u2019d heard how the sheriff liked to fuck for years.</p><p>All night. Hard and heavy. He was like a stallion ready to mount and ride at any given time, one widow had drawled drunkenly during a pity party of epic proportions when her studly sheriff had stopped coming to her bed. Rogue was tired of hearing the damned tales from women drowning their sorrows in her whisky.</p><p>\u201cSmart-ass.\u201d His voice lowered, deepened. \u201cThat one was free, sweetheart; keep it up and I\u2019ll start running a tab for you. And I do collect.\u201d</p><p>She pretended to shiver. \u201cI\u2019m shaking in my shoes.\u201d</p> <p>He looked at the shoes on the floor, then back at her feet before his lips tightened and he gave his head a hard shake.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m getting the hell out of here,\u201d he told her. \u201cIf I hear anything about the twins, I\u2019ll let you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust send one of your little deputies,\u201d she ordered furiously. \u201cI\u2019ve decided I don\u2019t like playing with you after all, Zeke. I think it\u2019s time for me to consider other potential buddies.\u201d</p><p>He stopped.</p><p>Zeke could feel the blood exploding in his head at her angry little threat, and the fact that she just might be serious. Was she serious? He stared into her eyes, keeping his eyes narrowed as he gauged her expression.</p><p>Yep, she just might be serious.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t jump into anything if I were you,\u201d he warned her. He tried to keep the warning light, but he failed miserably. He knew what he sounded like. Like a man warning his woman back from a boundary she was getting ready to cross.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t have her, but he\u2019d be damned if he was going to stand aside and watch some other bastard take her now that he\u2019d had a taste of her.</p> <p>That thought froze him as effectively as Rogue\u2019s warning had. Hell, he was losing his fucking mind.</p><p>\u201cFuck it,\u201d he suddenly snarled. \u201cNone of my damned business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone of your damned business,\u201d she agreed, evidently angrier now than she was to begin with.</p><p>Zeke watched the flush that mounted her cheeks, the glitter of battle in her violet eyes and almost, just almost wondered at the dominant spark that seemed to trigger a cascade of lust in his gut.</p><p>Damn her. She wasn\u2019t supposed to challenge him. Get pissed, yeah. Challenge him?</p><p>Hell no. It was the one thing he\u2019d fought to keep from happening over the years. Rogue challenging him wasn\u2019t something either of them wanted to test right now. Not while the taste of her lips lingered against his, while he could still feel the slick, silken juices from her pussy against his fingertips.</p><p>\u201cBe careful, little girl,\u201d he told her gently. \u201cChallenging a big dog is a hell of a lot different than those little Chihuahuas you run with sometimes. They bark at the wind and tuck their tails between their asses and run when I growl back. Remember that.</p><p>And you better consider that there\u2019s a reason for it. I\u2019m not a lapdog you can curl up with, pet and stroke a few times, and consider it a done deal. You\u2019re a baby next to me, Rogue. It\u2019s not the years between us that hold me back; it\u2019s the fact that you and I both know there\u2019s things about me you don\u2019t want to tempt. Otherwise, you wouldn\u2019t be so damned determined to push me.\u201d</p><p>Her brow jerked up. A perfect little sarcastic arch.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be sure to have nightmares tonight,\u201d she drawled. \u201cLock up when you leave, Sheriff. I\u2019ve had enough of the deep, dark warnings and dominant male bullshit. I\u2019ll let you know when I\u2019m ready for more.\u201d</p><p>She sauntered past him, and he let her go. He had to force his fingers not to curl into fists to hold back the urge to reach out for her. He had to force himself not to follow her when the bedroom door closed.</p><p>Hell, he had to force himself to leave her apartment. To stride across the room, turn the lock on her door, and step outside before pulling it shut behind him. Forcing himself down the stairs and through the bar was even harder.</p><p>Because he knew what she was doing. She wasn\u2019t in a damned bubble bath. He felt her gaze the minute he stepped from the bar. She was up there watching him, the same as he had watched her enter the bar countless times. And he wondered if she was remembering the dark promise of that kiss they had shared, because he knew he sure as hell wouldn\u2019t be forgetting it.</p><p>The kiss itself was a challenge. He should have known the minute she began battling for his taste, pressing for more, for a deeper caress, a harder taste, that he was in deep trouble where that woman was concerned.</p><p>He should have known Rogue wouldn\u2019t listen to a warning, that she wouldn\u2019t see reason. She was young, impulsive, wild as the wind. Too young. Son of a bitch. He jerked his truck door open and lifted himself into the seat before slamming it closed. He wanted to ram his fists into something; he wanted to howl at the fucking moon, race back inside and show her how a man hungered, how a man took his woman, and exactly how a man expected a response.</p><p>She had no business playing games with him. No damned business pushing his buttons and leaving him with a dick so damned hard that if he did manage to get it to relax, then the bastard was still tender, still ready for action. He hadn\u2019t been this damned ready for sex in more years than he wanted to count.</p><p>The woman worked his cock quicker than old man Parsons swore Viagra worked his.</p><p>This was a damned mess, and he was beginning to lose not just his control but also his common sense.</p><p>She was, quite simply, too damned young for what he hungered for.</p><p>FOUR</p><p>Rogue woke the next morning with a headache.Gremlins from hell were digging into her brain with dull little pick-axes right behind her eyeballs. She\u2019d known when she lay down to sleep the night before that rest wouldn\u2019t follow her into that dark void of unconsciousness. Dreams had instead. The same dreams that had tormented her for years.</p><p>Those damned pictures. That fateful night that had begun the emergence of the woman she hadn\u2019t known resided inside her.</p><p>David and Amy Kerring. They had been strangers in town, but Caitlyn Rogue Walker hadn\u2019t exactly been well known in her father\u2019s bar. She hadn\u2019t told anyone her relationship; she liked to watch, to listen, with no one knowing who she was. That night, David and Amy had been friendly. Rogue hadn\u2019t particularly liked them, but damn, she had been so dumb. She had turned her back on them only moments, but it was long enough for them to spike her drink.</p><p>The next thing she had known she had woken in a strange bed, half dressed, reasonably certain she hadn\u2019t been raped, but she had known something had happened.</p><p>Nadine Grace and Dayle Mackay had happened. They had been there, and her nightmares proved it. Nadine had giggled and laughed like a schoolgirl as Dayle Mackay snapped the pictures that had been used to humiliate her ever since.</p><p>Never let them see you sweat, bleed, or cry, her grandmother had once told her. Rogue had kept her head high, but it hadn\u2019t been easy. Staring Zeke Mayes in the eye after those pictures hit the Internet had been even harder.</p><p>Now, today, four years later, she found that bravado was second nature, pissing people off came easily, and pretending to be the wild, vivacious Rogue was like a second skin now. Unfortunately, the illusion was only skin-deep. The wild, sexually aware, teasing, motorcycle-riding hellion was just that, a game, a joke on the county and the people that had turned on her. Beneath the skin Caitlyn still lurked, waiting, watching, and fantasizing about a man she couldn\u2019t have.</p><p>So what did she do after the best kiss of her life? Did she have incredibly erotic dreams of getting him out of uniform and devouring his hot, hard body? Of course not; she had nightmares.</p><p>And she also had a job outside of lounging around the bar. She\u2019d skipped out on Janey the night before, but she couldn\u2019t skip out today or tomorrow. The lunch-crowd days were murder, and the bookkeeping at the end of the day looked like something a cyclone had blown in if Rogue didn\u2019t get a hand on it quickly.</p><p>Not that Janey couldn\u2019t handle the paperwork; it was just that Rogue was better at it and she knew it. And she hated having to figure out Janey\u2019s system when she called demanding help. It was a hell of a lot easier when it was Rogue\u2019s system.</p><p>April was being especially nice when she stepped out the back door of the bar that afternoon. The early afternoon sunlight was pouring down and warming the mountains with unseasonably heated days. Perfect days for the motorcycle ride to the restaurant.</p><p>The nights were colder, though, and far less hospitable, but endurable.</p><p>She missed the nights Zeke had picked her up after he went off duty at night. The sheriff\u2019s four-by-four Tahoe had been toasty warm and smelled of Zeke. That rich, dark male scent mixed with a hint of aftershave.</p><p>Straddling the Harley, Rogue gave herself a mental shake, turned on the ignition, and kicked back the stand before pulling out of the back lot of the bar and heading toward Somerset.</p><p>The Bar was only a few miles out of town, but the drive to the Mackay restaurant was nearly a half hour. By the time she pulled into the back lot there the chill wind had sliced through her leather riding chaps and heavy jacket. Her face felt frozen, and she wasn\u2019t looking forward to the ride home that night.</p><p>Damn, if she kept this up, she was going to have to pull that ugly sedan out of the garage where she kept it stored and start driving it again. Wouldn\u2019t that just leave her reputation as the bad-girl biker in the dust. Her dignity, too, because that sedan was damned ugly.</p><p>Kicking the stand in place, she pulled the key from the ignition, tucked it into her front pocket, and dismounted in one smooth move before pulling the small leather backpack she carried from a saddlebag.</p><p>Janey was in the office as Rogue strode in. The other woman was sitting nice and cozy and warm in her lover\u2019s arms where he sat in the large leather chair behind the desk.</p><p>\u201cChief of police caught lazing on the job,\u201d Rogue reported tongue-in-cheek. \u201cSources close to the owner of the Mackay Restaurant and Caf\u00e9 report that said chief definitely knows how to make use of a leather office chair. Pictures below.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Janey rolled her eyes as Alex grunted, though his gray eyes were lit with amusement.</p><p>\u201cSources close to Rogue Walker are also well aware of a certain sheriff\u2019s late-night visit,\u201d he stated, though his gaze turned somber. \u201cHas he learned anything yet?\u201d</p><p>Rogue shook her head as she loosened the buckles to her chaps and slid them from her jeans-clad legs. \u201cNothing that I know of and I\u2019ve ignored the phone this morning, so the gossip hasn\u2019t exactly made it to me yet.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe gossip we can definitely do without,\u201d Janey stated, her dark green eyes sparking with anger.</p><p>Janey had endured enough gossip since her father\u2019s death. Dayle Mackay had been a maggot and his sister, Nadine Grace, had been even worse. Sometimes Rogue thought it rather ironic, the friendship she had developed with the other woman, considering her history with Janey\u2019s father and aunt.</p><p>\u201cHave you heard anything further?\u201d She watched Alex as he lifted Janey to her feet, then rose from the chair.</p><p>The man was definite eye candy. She got a nice slow look, then arched her brow at Janey\u2019s frown as her lips twitched in amusement. It was a game. Rogue couldn\u2019t help it.</p><p>Alex always just almost blushed, and Janey always bristled. Rogue laughed.</p> <p>\u201cI haven\u2019t heard anything further,\u201d Alex growled. \u201cStop trying to embarrass me, Rogue.</p><p>It\u2019s not going to happen.\u201d</p><p>Rogue shrugged. \u201cHey, a girl needs some excitement in her life, ya know.\u201d</p><p>Janey leaned back against the table set close to the wall and arched her brows at Rogue\u2019s comment. \u201cI guess that\u2019s why Zeke called Alex no more than five minutes before you arrived. To add excitement to your life?\u201d</p><p>Rogue glared back at her. \u201cYeah. Right. If he lets my life get any more exciting, I might not be able to handle it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh,\u201d Alex murmured. \u201cExplains the beard burn under your jaw.\u201d</p> <p>Rogue\u2019s hand flashed to the incriminating mark, and she felt the heat flood her face.</p><p>Dammit. She knew she had covered that with makeup.</p><p>He laughed in response. \u201cGood makeup job, but I watch Janey try to hide the marks too damned often not to know what you\u2019re hiding there. Tell him to shave before he comes around next time.\u201d</p><p>At that, he dropped a quick kiss on his fianc\u00e9e\u2019s lips and strode from the office as Rogue plopped onto the couch facing Janey\u2019s desk.</p><p>\u201cI hate him,\u201d she muttered as she flashed Janey a mocking glare.</p><p>Janey laughed as she took a seat beside Rogue on the couch. \u201cYeah, he has that effect on people sometimes.\u201d</p><p>Janey tilted her head to look beneath Rogue\u2019s jaw again as Rogue narrowed her eyes and stared back at her broodingly.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just beard burn,\u201d Rogue muttered. \u201cIt will go away soon.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat is it about the men around here that they just can\u2019t get past marking their women?\u201d Janey asked then.</p><p>Rogue snorted. \u201cI\u2019ve seen the marks you leave on Alex, Janey. I swear I think you\u2019re trying to have him for a midnight snack.\u201d</p><p>Janey\u2019s lips pursed with a wicked little smile. \u201cSometimes.\u201d</p><p>Rogue shook her head as a feeling of loss swept through her. She was jealous of her friend. Janey had with Alex what Rogue had only dreamed of having with Zeke in the past five years.</p><p>Why the hell was she so focused on this single man to the point that no other would do?</p><p>What was it about Zeke Mayes and his total reluctance to touch her that kept her dangling on that ever-present string of attraction to him? Whatever it was, it was going to have to stop.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not his woman anyway.\u201d She shrugged as she rose from the couch, picked up her pack, and headed for the door that led into the restaurant itself. \u201cAccording to him, why, little ole me is much too young for his big, bad sheriffy ass. Seems he wants more of a woman than it appears I am.\u201d</p><p>She tossed Janey a careless smile, but it hurt. No, it didn\u2019t just hurt, it pissed her off. She could have had a dozen lovers in the past five years. She didn\u2019t have to sleep alone. She didn\u2019t have to drift through the days waiting to see one man above all others.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t ugly. No one would have to put a bag over her head to fuck her.</p><p>Rogue jerked open the door and closed it behind her before taking a deep, cleansing breath. She had work to do. Three days a week she was the manager, and it just so happened that she had to pick the three hardest days of the week.</p><p>That meant she had a lot of work to do. First off was dressing for the role. She moved to the small employee\u2019s lounge at the back and the dressing room there. The waiters and waitresses had uniforms, but Rogue dressed as she pleased. She dressed to draw attention and send tongues wagging. Janey swore that half the clientele showed up just to see what Rogue would wear next. Tonight, she was in a wild mood. Wild, but subtle.</p><p>Subtle meant everything when it came to a particular mood, she thought with a tight little smile as she pulled the well-pressed clothing from within her pack.</p><p>The schoolgirl\u2019s checkered skirt was short but demure. It covered her ass. That was modest, but this one actually went a few inches lower and covered the tops of her thighs as well. The pleats were full and, if she turned a certain way, would flare out enticingly.</p><p>With it, she wore a see-through white blouse, a shimmering gray camisole, and beneath that, a lacy black bra. Stockings and gray stilettos finished the outfit.</p><p>An hour later the curls that cascaded around her face were pulled up to the crown of her head and secured with a thin scarf that trailed behind her head. Makeup, a quick application of bronze lipstick, and she looked subtly enticing, sexy, and wicked.</p><p>And she knew exactly who would see her looking just young, fresh, and eager to be debauched. She almost laughed at the term her mother had once used. That was exactly how she looked, and Sheriff Zeke Mayes just happened to have a reservation for dinner with his son and his aunt, Lucinda Mayes- Downes, his father\u2019s sister.</p><p>Lucinda Mayes-Downes was no one\u2019s fool, and that old woman was as rowdy as any Rogue had ever known. Shane Mayes, Zeke\u2019s son, was a crackerjack. The kid was going to be a heartbreaker when he was older, if he ever managed to get hold of that penchant to fight at any given opportunity.</p><p>She shook her head, took her hands, and mussed her hair invitingly, then pursed her lips and blew a kiss toward the mirror before giving a light, anticipatory laugh and heading out to the dining room. To work.</p><p>Damn, how had she managed to let Janey convince her to actually work?</p><p>Zeke had a feeling when he met his aunt Lucinda and son in the parking lot of the restaurant that the evening wasn\u2019t going to go nearly as planned. Once a month he was roped into taking his aunt and son out to eat. A family thing, Lucinda liked to call it. It was more along the lines of an excuse to drive from Louisville where Shane was now attending college and staying in her guest room. An excuse to get nosy, to point out the fact that he was only growing older by the day and that it was time to settle down and give Shane a brother or sister.</p><p>Thankfully, Shane didn\u2019t seem quite so enthusiastic about the brother/sister part. He found quite a bit of amusement in listening to his great-aunt gently berate Zeke though.</p><p>Hell, it if wasn\u2019t the Mackays driving him crazy with their shenanigans, then it was Shane and Lucinda. How the hell was a man supposed to consider an affair, let alone a relationship, when his aunt seemed to have an earful of gossip, about him, each time he saw her?</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re late, Zeke.\u201d Lucinda stepped out of the cherry red Mustang she owned, a new one, a bright smile on her face as Shane pushed himself from the passenger seat.</p><p>His son didn\u2019t look happy. Evidently his doting aunt had refused to allow him to drive her new baby.</p><p>\u201cBy five minutes, Lucy,\u201d he grumbled. \u201cYou\u2019re lucky I made it at all.\u201d</p><p>Lucinda\u2019s smile only brightened. \u201cOf course you made it. Otherwise I would have had to start making calls, tracking you down, and pulling you out of the arms of whatever little widow you\u2019d found to amuse yourself with. Funny, I haven\u2019t heard about any widows lately though.\u201d</p><p>He shot her a warning look. Not that Lucinda paid much attention to his warnings.</p><p>As he neared, she hooked her arm around his, the fine silk of her conservative blue blouse sliding against the cotton shirt he wore. Black slacks and conservative pumps completed her outfit.</p><p>Her once-black hair was now dark silver, styled to frame her face and add a touch of youthfulness to it. Her dark brown eyes sparkled with warmth, and a touch of impish mischief. No one could accuse Lucinda of hiding her playfulness under a barrel. The woman fairly shouted \u201cgood times\u201d with that grin of hers.</p><p>\u201cSo, nephew, how is your love life?\u201d she asked as he opened the door for her, casted her a baleful glance.</p><p>Because he was more than aware of the hostess who had glanced up and more than obviously caught his aunt\u2019s question.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s still none of your business,\u201d he told her as Shane snorted behind her.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s never stopped her, Dad,\u201d his son told him. \u201cAnd before you try to lie to her, she\u2019s been on the phone for the past two days discussing you with her cronies here in Somerset.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFriends, Shane,\u201d Lucinda reminded him with a long-suffering look. \u201cI\u2019ve told you, they\u2019re friends, not cronies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChildren, we\u2019re in public,\u201d Zeke reminded them, ignoring his aunt\u2019s pinch to his arm as she restrained her laughter.</p><p>\u201cSheriff Mayes,\u201d Rogue\u2019s voice slid through the teasing. \u201cIt\u2019s good to see you and your family again.\u201d</p><p>God, her voice did things to him. He couldn\u2019t describe exactly what it did, but every cell in his body seemed to be drawn to the sound of her. The sight of her.</p><p>He nearly swallowed his damned tongue as she stepped from behind the reservation desk and motioned the hostess to her.</p><p>\u201cTabitha will take care of you tonight.\u201d She smiled back at them.</p><p>\u201cTabitha will do no such thing.\u201d Lucy moved in front of Zeke. \u201cYoung lady, it\u2019s been too long since I\u2019ve seen you. You can take us to our table and say hello to me for a moment.\u201d She caught Rogue\u2019s hands and let her gaze go over the younger woman. Hell, Zeke couldn\u2019t take his eyes off her.</p><p>\u201cNaughty Rogue.\u201d Lucinda\u2019s smile was pure devilry. \u201cThat outfit is to die for.\u201d</p><p>Rogue\u2019s brows lifted as she accepted Lucinda\u2019s light kiss to the cheek and held on to her fingers.</p><p>\u201cI thought it particularly appropriate, for my age.\u201d Rogue widened her eyes, and Zeke had to give her credit for never looking his way. The woman could deliver a blow with precise, well- aimed precision.</p><p>He was thankful he managed to control his wince.</p><p>\u201cFor your age, huh?\u201d Lucinda drawled. \u201cThat little hickey you\u2019re trying so hard to hide under your jaw doesn\u2019t seem near as age appropriate.\u201d</p><p>Zeke\u2019s gaze sliced to her jaw. He saw her face flush, and her gaze jerked from his face as Lucinda suddenly looked between the two of them. Shane gave an odd little choke behind him.</p><p>\u201cYes, well,\u201d Rogue cleared her throat. \u201cMore like a bit of beard burn. Occupational hazard with some men. I\u2019ll show you to your table now.\u201d</p><p>Her smile was a little tighter as she turned from them, but damn, the view was good.</p><p>Shit, he shouldn\u2019t be looking. He jerked his gaze from the rounded globes of her ass beneath that flippy little skirt to his son. Only to see Shane\u2019s eyes trained in the same exact area.</p><p>\u201cHey, brat,\u201d he growled. \u201cLook up.\u201d</p><p>Shane jerked his head up, blushed, and laughed, then to Zeke\u2019s surprise murmured back, \u201cShave next time.\u201d</p><p>Hell. He should have known better than to think Lucinda didn\u2019t know where he was last night. No matter the excuse he gave, no matter the reasons why he had been in Rogue\u2019s apartment, she had turned up with beard burn the next day. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Beard burn, his ass. Yeah, he might have scratched her with his evening stubble, but he also remembered the little bite of her he had taken in the same place.</p><p>\u201cRogue dear, you need to come to Louisville for lunch,\u201d Lucinda was saying as Rogue led them to their table. \u201cWe could have a girls\u2019 day out. Go shopping.\u201d</p><p>Wild violet eyes turned on Zeke as Lucinda turned her back on Rogue. Zeke wanted to smile, hell, he wanted to laugh. She looked horrified at the prospect.</p> <p>\u201cWe could gossip,\u201d Lucinda stated smugly as she glanced at Zeke. \u201cGirl talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have to check my calendar, Lucinda,\u201d she answered, though Zeke swore she looked a little pale at the invitation. \u201cJaney keeps me pretty busy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I could have a talk with Janey.\u201d Lucinda stared up at her victim complacently.</p><p>\u201cYou could even bring her with you. I never got a chance to get to know that girl. Her brother though, now he was a wild one. Somerset lost a fine bachelor when he married that agent of his.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I definitely agree,\u201d Rogue agreed hurriedly. \u201cI\u2019ll send Janey out to you as soon as possible. You can discuss it with her. Though Alex does keep her fairly busy.\u201d</p> <p>Hell. Wrong statement, Zeke thought as he took his seat and saw the satisfaction on Lucinda\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cYes, a good man will keep you very busy,\u201d Lucinda agreed. \u201cTell me, Rogue, who was the brute that left that charming little mark beneath your jaw?\u201d She tapped her chin thoughtfully. \u201cI hadn\u2019t heard you were dating, dear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d Rogue cleared her throat. \u201cIt was an accident with my curling iron.\u201d She twirled a curl nervously as she lied with zero guilt and a charming smile. \u201cNature isn\u2019t always perfect. If you\u2019ll excuse me now, Tabitha needs help.\u201d</p><p>Rogue escaped, leaving Zeke to stare across the table at his aunt while Shane fought to hold back his laugher.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to assume you have a reason for torturing Rogue,\u201d he stated.</p><p>Lucinda\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cI wasn\u2019t torturing Rogue, dear. I was merely chatting.\u201d She looked to Shane. \u201cWas I torturing the child?\u201d</p> <p>Shane shifted in his seat, glared at his father, and cleared his throat. \u201cMaybe some,\u201d he finally admitted, before Zeke received another of the boy\u2019s accusing stares. \u201cMaybe you should torture the guy that left the mark.\u201d</p><p>Lucinda sighed. \u201cIf only I could learn for certain who did such a thing,\u201d she said calmly.</p><p>\u201cWhy, I called everyone I knew since first learning of it this morning. Didn\u2019t you hear me on the cell phone, dear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d Shane ran his hand over his shortened dark brown hair. \u201cHours\u2019 worth, Aunt Lucinda.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d Lucinda sighed. \u201cAnd the only man that she\u2019s even been known to speak with for longer than a few minutes was your father.\u201d She turned innocent eyes on Zeke.</p><p>\u201cYou talked to her last night about her cousins\u2019 deaths, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Zeke answered cautiously. Damn Lucinda, she was like a shark on the scent of blood.</p><p>\u201cDid she mention who she was dating?\u201d Supreme innocence filled his aunt\u2019s face. The look was frightening.</p> <p>\u201cNope, and I didn\u2019t ask her.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d simply more or less ordered her not to consider dating anyone. He couldn\u2019t conceive the thought of Rogue in another man\u2019s bed. In the years she had been in Somerset, there had always been talk, especially after those pictures surfaced, but nothing serious.</p><p>\u201cNot that I\u2019m sure it matters.\u201d Lucinda shrugged.</p><p>\u201cMeaning?\u201d Zeke was nearly pushing the words past his lips now. What the hell was Lucinda up to? Hell, she was dangerous. He should introduce her to that Homeland Security special agent, Timothy Cranston; Aunt Lucinda could teach him a thing or two about interrogation.</p><p>\u201cWrong question,\u201d Shane muttered as Lucinda smiled again. That smile was known to make grown men whimper.</p><p>\u201cWell, after those horrible pictures.\u201d She sighed. \u201cWell, a man has to be careful, doesn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>Zeke drew in a long, careful breath as Tabitha moved toward them. The waitress carried menus, and behind her one of the young waiters was bearing ice water.</p><p>\u201cAunt Lucinda,\u201d he said softly. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to continue this conversation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Her eyes widened. \u201cOf course not, dear. Is she a very good friend of yours as well now?\u201d</p><p>Friend. No, he had never called Rogue a friend. A fantasy. A temptation. The one thing he couldn\u2019t have and wanted more than his next breath. They were more than friends.</p><p>They weren\u2019t lovers. He couldn\u2019t allow himself to step that close to her.</p><p>\u201cEnough.\u201d He stared back at her as Tabitha moved closer.</p><p>Lucinda sighed. Shane made that odd choking sound again as Zeke sliced his gaze to him. His son had his head down, his lips tight, but if Zeke wasn\u2019t mistaken, that tight line threatened to turn to a smile. When Shane knew what the hell Lucinda was up to, and Zeke didn\u2019t, it was time to worry.</p><p>But a part of him was fairly certain he knew exactly what Lucinda was up to. No one had seen a mark on Rogue\u2019s neck before his visit last night, now, this morning, it was there, and obviously it had been seen by one of Lucinda\u2019s gossip buddies.</p><p>He was going to have to be more careful with Rogue\u2019s silken skin, he thought. It was tender, so damned sweet, and obviously he wasn\u2019t nearly as careful with her as he had been with lovers in the past. Because Zeke knew better than to leave a mark. He knew better than to leave any proof that he had spent the night with a woman, that any woman held his attention. Especially considering the fact that Lucinda butted her nose into so much as the hint that Zeke could be involved with anyone.</p><p>She believed the only way he was going to be happy would be if he remarried. Despite her own unmarried state, Lucinda wasn\u2019t happy unless everyone around her was enjoying connubial bliss.</p><p>As his father had once said, after Lucinda\u2019s husband\u2019s death, she had become damned strange. Fun. But strange as hell.</p><p>Silence filled the table as the waiter set water before them and Tabitha handed them their menus with her cheery little spiel on the chef\u2019s specials. She took their drink orders, then moved away with a promise to return shortly for their dinner orders.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a pretty little girl, Shane,\u201d Lucinda piped up. \u201cYou could do worse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I couldn\u2019t,\u201d Shane muttered. \u201cShe\u2019s older than I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a girlfriend,\u201d Shane argued.</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d Lucinda pressed again.</p><p>Shane looked to Zeke with that inborn desperate plea of a son to his father to save him from drowning. Zeke stared back at him silently. The little brat had left him floundering on his own beneath Lucinda\u2019s less-than-gentle regard. Zeke would be damned if he\u2019d save his kid now. Let him see how it felt.</p><p>\u201cHis girlfriend is barely seventeen, Zeke. Tell Shane that\u2019s too young.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s too young, Shane.\u201d Zeke wished Tabitha would get back with the whisky he\u2019d ordered.</p><p>\u201cIs not,\u201d Shane stated with a long-suffering sigh. \u201cIt\u2019s just two years. It could be worse.\u201d</p><p>Zeke stared back at him.</p><p>Lucinda tilted her head quizzically. \u201cHow could it be worse, dear?\u201d</p><p>Shane\u2019s lips twitched. \u201cIt could be eleven years.\u201d</p><p>FIVE</p><p>He should stay away.</p><p>Zeke parked his pickup at the back of the bar, wondering why he bothered. There was no way to hide the vehicle, and everyone that knew him knew what he drove off-hours.</p><p>He shouldn\u2019t be here.</p><p>Flexing his hands, he reminded himself that he was just here to check up on her, make sure everything was okay. Her Harley was still at the restaurant. She\u2019d hired a cab to return home after closing rather than calling him.</p><p>Striding to the back door he hit the intercom button and waited. He could have gone through the front and right up her stairs, but damn if he wanted to listen to more of Lucinda\u2019s questions tomorrow.</p><p>The locks on the door clicked, a second later the panel was pulled open and Rogue stood before him, still dressed in that short, checkered skirt and heels, and the thin camisole she had worn under the long-sleeved blouse earlier.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want, Zeke?\u201d she asked, her voice low, wary.</p><p>She looked good enough to eat.</p><p>He was going to at least taste.</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer her. Catching the edge of the door he pushed inside before wrapping the fingers of his other hand around her wrist. He closed the door, locked it, then looked back at the open office door and the light inside the room.</p><p>\u201cWorking?\u201d He stared down at her as he felt the slow slide of his control eroding into the dust.</p><p>\u201cDoes it matter?\u201d Her lips twisted mockingly. \u201cReady for another slap and tickle, are you?\u201d</p><p>He ignored the accusation; instead, he moved toward the room, holding her wrist firmly and drawing her with him.</p><p>Stepping inside, he came to a hard stop, his eyes narrowing at the sight of the man lounging back on the couch that sat against the wall.</p><p>Cranston was short, portly, his brown hair thinning, his expression as innocent and as unthreatening as a child\u2019s. It was a damned good thing Zeke knew just how devious and cunning the Homeland Security agent could be.</p><p>\u201cSheriff? You\u2019re putting in some long hours, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Timothy Cranston rose from the couch, straightened his wrinkled jacket on his shoulders, and flashed Zeke a sly smile. \u201cRogue and I were just discussing the unseasonably cold weather.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, we weren\u2019t, we were talking about Zeke.\u201d Rogue jerked her wrist from his grip and moved around him as Timothy chuckled at her revelation.</p><p>\u201cVery well, we were talking about you.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cShe has a very high opinion of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t. I think he\u2019s a prick,\u201d she stated, a tight smile curling her lips as Timothy laughed again, his gaze thoughtful as it came back to Zeke.</p><p>\u201cGood-bye, Agent Cranston,\u201d Zeke stated, his voice harsh.</p><p>Putting up with Cranston\u2019s bullshit wasn\u2019t high on his list of priorities right now. He\u2019d deal with him later; for now, he intended to deal with Rogue. The teasing little minx had flitted around the restaurant, like a flame- haired seductress while he had been there. Half the men in the restaurant had been panting over their meals, the other half were probably home jacking off to visions of lifting that little skirt over her ass and paddling it for driving them crazy. That was definitely what he would have been jacking off to. If he\u2019d had the good sense to go home.</p><p>\u201cWell, I can tell when I\u2019m no longer needed.\u201d Timothy adjusted the front of his suit jacket over his chest before picking up the overcoat he had laid on the couch beside him.</p><p>\u201cGood night, my dear.\u201d He nodded to Rogue before turning to Zeke. \u201cLater, Sheriff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMuch later,\u201d Zeke assured him.</p><p>Timothy smiled again, one of those amused, condescending curls of the lips that never failed to raise Zeke\u2019s hackles.</p><p>He had issues with the agent, serious ones, that weren\u2019t being resolved anytime soon.</p><p>He\u2019d been working with Timothy Cranston for ten years now to break the Freedom League and its hold in the Kentucky mountains. What had he gained for his efforts? In the past two years, two operations had been conducted in Pulaski County that Zeke had been kept in the dark about.</p><p>He didn\u2019t appreciate it. And now, six months later, he and Cranston were still at a stalemate over it.</p><p>\u201cSoon,\u201d Timothy corrected as he shrugged his overcoat on and moved around Zeke to the open door. \u201cVery soon, Sheriff.\u201d</p><p>The agent at least had the consideration to close the door behind him. Zeke went one better and locked it before turning back to Rogue. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She was no longer leaning against her desk. She had lifted herself onto it, sitting poised on the edge with her shapely, silken legs crossed. Red gold curls cascaded around her like silken flames of temptation.</p><p>\u201cAnd I ask again, what do you want?\u201d she asked archly. \u201cOr did you decide to come by and torture me another night? Keep it up, Zeke, and you may find yourself shackled to a bed somewhere with your own handcuffs.\u201d</p><p>He snorted at the threat. \u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>He watched her, simply watched her as the need to touch her grew like a sickness inside him. Staying away from her was impossible. He was learning that. The more he tried, the harder it became. The more he denied himself, the more he ached for what he shouldn\u2019t have.</p><p>\u201cYou deliberately made me crazy earlier,\u201d he accused her roughly. \u201cFlipping around that restaurant in that little skirt, daring me to take you.\u201d</p><p>Her brow arched. \u201cAre you paranoid, Zeke? Maybe you just needed to see it as a dare so you could have an excuse to do something you were dying to do anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that would be?\u201d He forced the words past his lips as he stepped closer.</p><p>Her tongue, damp and pink, flicked over her lips as her gaze lowered to his thighs, then back to his eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re dying to have me, aren\u2019t you, Zeke?\u201d Her voice lowered, became tempting, seductive. \u201cYou want me so damned bad you can\u2019t stand it, and you refuse to admit it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I freely admit it.\u201d There was no denying it.</p><p>Before he could curb the impulse he took the last steps to her, wrapped one hand around the back of her neck, tilted her chin back with his thumb, and lowered his head.</p><p>Spicy, consuming pleasure exploded through his senses as her lips parted for him.</p><p>Hunger beat through his veins, surged to his hardened cock, and had him pulling her thighs apart with his free hand to get closer to her.</p><p>The taste of her was liquid hot as she arched against him, a surprised breath of sound barely escaping. Keeping her head tilted back, he devoured her lips, her tongue. He slid his hand up her thigh, touched the wet panel of her panties, and groaned at the heat he found there.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re like an addiction.\u201d He nipped at her lips as he released her neck, only to drag the hem of her camisole up, over the filmy lace of her bra.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll find you a twelve-step program.\u201d She arched against him.</p><p>\u201cTwelve steps to complete insanity?\u201d he asked as his lips traveled along her jaw. \u201cFuck, Rogue. How the hell am I supposed to do my job when all I think about is the taste and feel of you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake breaks to feed the addiction?\u201d Breathy, sensual, her voice had his body tightening further.</p><p>\u201cThat would be a hell of a lot of breaks.\u201d It was a hell of a good idea.</p><p>Rogue tilted her head back as Zeke\u2019s lips continued their campaign of complete sensory rapture along her jaw to her ear. Shudders of pleasure raced through her body at each lick of his tongue, each nip of his lips.</p><p>It was like being consumed by hunger, by the eroticism of the feel of him against her.</p><p>The heat, the lightening stroke of rapture. God, she needed more. So much more that she arched closer to him and all but begged for it as the heat continued to build in her pussy, the tension tightening in her clit.</p><p>The feel of his calloused palm cupping her breast was enough to steal her breath. The stroke of his thumb over her distended nipple sent pulses of lightning-sharp sensation to attack her womb and her clit.</p> <p>She was sinking in sensual overload. In the hunger that wrapped around her and sank into her flesh. Nothing mattered but his touch, his kiss. If he thought he was addicted, it was nothing compared to her need for him. She felt as though she were drowning in the pleasure, drowning in the complete abandonment of her body to his.</p><p>Sensation jerked along her nerve endings as his fingertips brushed between her thighs, then over the dampness of her panties. Heated and wet, her juices spilled from her shamelessly, preparing her for his possession.</p><p>Oh boy, she hoped he possessed her. She was about to explode with need. Tension built inside her, drawing her tight as her knees lifted. Her shoes dropped from her feet as she raked the backs against the desk and propped her bare heels on the edge.</p><p>\u201cDamn you,\u201d he growled, his head lifting as she leaned back and flashed him a wicked smile.</p><p>His fingers pressed against her pussy, rubbing the silk of her panties against her clit as she lifted her hips to him.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s so good,\u201d she whispered breathlessly.</p><p>\u201cIt can get better,\u201d he promised.</p><p>She shuddered at the thought of it getting any better, then cried out in surprise as his lips lowered to the tops of her breasts.</p><p>He licked over the swollen rise of flesh above her bra. His teeth raked the sensitive flesh, and his fingers drew patterns of heated ecstasy on the silk between her thighs.</p><p>It was too much. Too much sensation. Too much need.</p><p>\u201cZeke, please.\u201d Her head fell back on her shoulders as she fought to hold herself up.</p><p>Palms planted on the top of the desk, her arms trembled with the effort to stay in place.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you need, baby?\u201d His cheek brushed over a hard nipple. \u201cTell me what you need.\u201d</p><p>What did she need? She needed so much. She needed to be touched, everywhere. She needed to sink into his skin and never be without him.</p><p>\u201cTell me, Rogue,\u201d he breathed over the hard tip of her nipple. \u201cTell me what you need.\u201d</p><p>It was a dare and a challenge.</p><p>Rogue lifted her head to stare down at him, the effort it took to keep her eyes open sapping nearly all of her strength.</p><p>\u201cSuck my nipple,\u201d she demanded, not to be outdone. \u201cSuck it hard and deep, Zeke.\u201d</p><p>His jaw clenched, his golden brown eyes seemed to flame with heat as his lips parted and a breath later covered one stiff peak and sucked it, lace and all, into the heated cavern of his mouth.</p><p>Her hips jerked, thrusting against his fingers as he lashed at her nipple with his tongue.</p><p>Pleasure detonated through her, striking without warning and stealing her breath as his fingertips grazed the silk material covering her clit.</p><p>\u201cTake the bra off,\u201d she demanded as she shook beneath the caress. \u201cPlease, Zeke. Let me feel everything.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t take it off herself. If she moved her hands from their braced position she would melt on the table like hot butter.</p><p>\u201cOh baby,\u201d he crooned as one hand stroked up her back, then around between her breasts. \u201cAll you had to do was tell me how you wanted it.\u201d</p><p>He was teasing her, burning her alive.</p><p>The clip of her bra came free easily. Rogue fought to breathe as she watched him peel the cups back from her breasts, watched as her rosy nipples seemed to lift to him.</p><p>\u201cHow pretty,\u201d he groaned as he tweaked one tight tip with his fingers. \u201cSo sweet and hard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore,\u201d she gasped. \u201cSuck them more.\u201d</p><p>His head lowered to one nipple as his fingers worked the other. Rogue shook her head as a cry spilled from her lips. It shouldn\u2019t be this good. The pleasure shouldn\u2019t go so deep that it bordered on pain. It shouldn\u2019t dissolve any objection she had.</p><p>\u201cOh yes,\u201d she moaned. \u201cOh God, Zeke. I need you. I need all of you.\u201d</p><p>She needed him inside her, between her thighs. Her pussy ached, burned. She could feel the desperate emptiness there as she never had before, and the need to be filled rose to desperate heights.</p><p>\u201cThere, baby.\u201d His head lifted as one hand pressed against her stomach. \u201cLay back for me.\u201d</p><p>Lay back? Move her arms? She would be lost if she didn\u2019t concentrate on holding herself up. She would lose her soul to him, and that couldn\u2019t be a good thing.</p><p>His dark, knowing chuckle wrapped around her as his hands moved; they caressed down her arms, gripped her wrists, and pulled them free. And Rogue melted.</p><p>Like a sensual sacrifice she reclined back along her desk, her arms falling over her head as his lips returned to her breasts. First one, then the other. His mouth sucked at her nipples, pulled them deep into his mouth; his tongue rasped over them, the wet heat of his mouth burned them.</p><p>\u201cDamn, you\u2019re fucking pretty.\u201d His voice was low, sensual, wicked as his head lifted again and he pulled her camisole over her head. \u201cSo sweet and hot. Can I taste you, baby? Taste you all over and get drunk on you?\u201d</p><p>Oh God, she had never heard anything so sexy in all her life. This wasn\u2019t fair. How was she supposed to retain any control when he talked like that? When his lips moved lower as he spoke, spreading a line of kisses along her abdomen to the band of her panties.</p><p>\u201cZeke. Oh God. I need you.\u201d</p><p>His fingers hooked in the elastic band. She didn\u2019t have to worry about him pulling them off her legs. The elastic snapped and his fingers brushed the material aside from the heated, aching folds of her pussy.</p><p>That was it. At the rending of the material Rogue swore she lost her mind. Sensation surged and exploded inside her as her hips jerked up and a shattered moan fell from her lips.</p><p>She was so turned on she wondered how she could breathe. Pleasure lashed through her system as desperation began to take over. Her arms lifted, her hands moved to his head, her fingers curling into the short strands of hair as she tried to push him lower, between her thighs.</p><p>She\u2019d dreamed of this, fantasized about it, ached to know what it would feel like. Her eyes opened as she watched, watched as he kissed his way to the flushed mound, then breathed a heated breath over the sensitive flesh.</p><p>Her thighs fell apart at the urging of his broad hands. Breath suspended in her lungs as she watched his tongue lick, slowly, so slowly around her hard, distended clit. His eyes were on her, watching her as she watched him lick. Watching her as her lashes drifted closed and ecstasy took over.</p><p>A second later a light sucking kiss had her crying out. Then his tongue became ravenous. Hard hands slid beneath her rear to lift her closer as he licked through the wet slit, circled the opening, then plunged inside in one hard, hungry stroke.</p><p>Rogue felt the explosion detonate inside her. She felt her pussy clench and spasm around his tongue, felt her clit implode with rapture, and lost herself in the fiery cataclysm that overtook her.</p><p>She was drowning in a pleasure that bordered on pain as he continued to fuck her with his tongue, drawing her juices from her as he groaned into her tender flesh. Each searing sensation seemed to tear something loose in her soul. Each stroke of his tongue fueled an orgasm that didn\u2019t seem to want to stop just as his fingers brushing against her clit rocked additional stimulus through her nerve endings until she was near screaming. She wanted to scream. She tried to scream. All that emerged were breathless whimpers and desperate moans as that last shattering wave of pleasure tore through her.</p><p>Zeke leaned his head against Rogue\u2019s thigh, lust barreling through him until he felt as though he\u2019d shatter from the need to fuck her.</p><p>His hands went to his belt. He had to have her. He was tearing at the clasp when the cell phone at his side began to beep imperatively, the tone emitting from it assuring him it was an emergency.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t on duty, but he couldn\u2019t ignore it. There was too much going on, too many things beginning to come to a head for him to ignore the summons.</p><p>With a throttled curse he jerked up and tore the phone from its holster.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he barked into the receiver as he watched Rogue\u2019s lashes lift, saw her eyes, the violet color darker, more intense than he had ever seen them as she stared back at him in confusion.</p><p>\u201cZeke, we have a problem at Joe and Jaime\u2019s mobile home,\u201d Gene stated. \u201cThe state police are here and you\u2019re needed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the problem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a ball of fire,\u201d Gene stated. \u201cIt\u2019s burning to the ground as we speak. The damned thing exploded like a bomb as I pulled up in the Tahoe after we received a call that there were vandals here. It\u2019s the Fourth of July on this mountain.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Zeke felt fury burn inside him and saw the desperation in Rogue\u2019s gaze, felt it in his own body.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be right there,\u201d he snapped. \u201cHave the state boys wait on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re all waiting,\u201d Gene promised. \u201cI\u2019d hurry though, because one of the neighbors thinks they saw someone in here just before we showed up. We could have a body.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m on my way.\u201d Zeke snapped the phone closed and shoved it back into its holster as Rogue eased up until she was sitting on the desk.</p><p>Zeke clenched his teeth as she pulled the bra over her breasts and secured the little clip before pulling the silky top back down and smoothing her skirt over her upper thighs.</p><p>\u201cAre you coming back?\u201d She didn\u2019t look at him as she asked the question.</p><p>\u201cEventually.\u201d Not tonight. If he came back tonight, God only knew how he\u2019d handle the lust tearing through him. He needed time to consider this, time to figure out how he could protect her amid the danger he could feel brewing in the county.</p><p>\u201cEventually,\u201d she breathed out as she lifted her head, her lips parting as a caustic smile shaped her lips. \u201cA few hours? A few days? A few years?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere are things going on that you don\u2019t understand, Rogue,\u201d he said, trying to keep his voice low. \u201cThings I have to deal with first.\u201d</p><p>Her head nodded jerkily. \u201cFine, deal with your things.\u201d She jumped off the desk and stalked to the door as he watched her, fighting the heaviness in his chest and his body\u2019s demand that he stay.</p><p>She jerked the door open and stared back at him furiously. \u201cDon\u2019t come back until you\u2019ve made up your mind whether or not you can stay long enough to at least supply the wham-bam-thank-you-ma\u2019am that any other woman would get. I don\u2019t like being played with, Zeke.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t like being played with, but by God, he didn\u2019t like games, either. At the moment, the game he was involved in wasn\u2019t one he couldn\u2019t step out of.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t push this, Rogue,\u201d he warned her gently. \u201cDon\u2019t push me where you\u2019re concerned. There are things you don\u2019t know and don\u2019t understand. Until I can fix that, then I don\u2019t have a whole hell of a lot to offer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you hear me asking for anything?\u201d she asked sweetly. The sweet part was a dead giveaway. Rogue was pissed. And she was hurt.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll be back.\u201d He strode to the door and stopped in front of her. \u201cAnd the next time I catch you getting cozy with any other man, no matter who he is, Rogue, there\u2019s going to be violence.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t give her a chance to respond. His hand curved around her neck and his lips took hers in a quick, hard kiss before he released her and strode from the office. He was out the back door in seconds and loping to his truck as he fought himself and his desire to walk right back inside where she waited.</p><p>She was his weakness. A man in his position couldn\u2019t afford a weakness. Especially now. Zeke could feel it beginning to come together. Whoever they were looking for was getting scared. The questions he\u2019d been asking about Joe and Jaime\u2019s death had gotten a response. This was the response. Someone was scared the two men had left something, anything, hidden that would reveal what they were doing or why they were killed.</p><p>Now, Zeke just had to figure out what it was, without the hope of finding more.</p><p>SIX</p><p>Zeke walked into his office the next morning, paused,and stared at his visitors before shaking his head with a bemused acceptance that was beginning to grow inside him.</p><p>The file in his hand was the coroner\u2019s report on the Walker boys. The forensics report was due in any day. But it wasn\u2019t looking good. And now, staring back at the four men waiting on him, he could feel his gut burning.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell do you and your sidekicks want, Cranston?\u201d</p> <p>Special Agent Timothy Cranston was supposed to be on suspended leave from the Department of Homeland Security. Zeke knew better. Timothy had never been suspended anywhere but on paper. The investigation running now was a time bomb waiting to explode with the same power that had been used on Joe and Jaime Walker\u2019s mobile home. And Timothy Cranston was smack in the middle of the whole damned thing.</p><p>Short, round, his face more often than not wreathed in a smile that rarely reached his eyes, the agent had been Zeke\u2019s nemesis for too many years. Anytime Cranston was around, trouble was sure to be there. And anywhere in Pulaski County that he found the Mackay cousins, he was damned sure to find trouble.</p><p>Douglas \u201cRowdy\u201d Mackay, James \u201cDawg\u201d Mackay, and their younger cousin, recently married to Homeland Security agent Chaya Dane, Natches Mackay.</p><p>Rowdy, Dawg, and Natches Mackay, and Timothy Cranston. Hell, he didn\u2019t need this.</p><p>His own investigation was beginning to come to a head after the years that Cranston had kept him pushed to the sidelines, unaware until too late that Homeland Security was working to take down the Freedom League without him. Cranston and the Mackay cousins had cut off the head, now Zeke was going for the backbone. Alone. He wouldn\u2019t be pushed out of this one. Not after all these years, the nightmares, or the evidence Cranston had against him personally.</p><p>\u201cWhen the four of you show up, there\u2019s trouble. I don\u2019t need trouble this week.\u201d He strode across the office to take his seat behind the wide, wood desk that sat in front of the shuttered bank of windows.</p><p>Pulling his chair close to the desk, he slapped the file on it and stared back at the four men. The Mackays were tall, muscular, and dark. Rowdy, the middle cousin, was the most clean-cut, the thinker of the group. Dawg, the oldest, was more clean-cut than he had been before his marriage. He was no longer scruffy, but his wild days reflected in his light green eyes and his hard expression. Natches, the youngest, now, he was the wild one of the group. The ringleader of most of the trouble and unapologetic about it.</p><p>Dawg and Natches had worked with Cranston for several years. As far as Zeke knew, Rowdy had just been dragged into it lately.</p><p>\u201cThe Walker boys,\u201d Natches drawled. \u201cYou have anything yet?\u201d</p><p>Zeke leaned back in his chair. \u201cThey involved with DHS?\u201d He stared back at the agent.</p><p>Of course they had been, he knew it and Cranston knew it, but he wasn\u2019t so sure the Mackays knew it.</p><p>Timothy grinned. A flash of teeth, like a shark, and a sparkle of brown eyes. \u201cNot to my knowledge. They weren\u2019t one of my contacts.\u201d</p><p>Timothy was a consummate liar. Zeke knew the Walkers fed information to DHS</p><p>because they\u2019d brought the information to him first.</p><p>Zeke looked at the Mackays.</p><p>\u201cThey helped us pull in information on that mission last year,\u201d Natches revealed. At least Natches wasn\u2019t lying to him. Yet. \u201cJoe and Jaime were always reliable sources of information.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think their deaths had something to do with that operation?\u201d Zeke asked. He knew it did, in part. Their murders had been too similar to others over the past twenty years.</p><p>He hoped for the Mackays\u2019 sakes that it didn\u2019t. Zeke was approaching his limit where their complete disregard for the chain of information was concerned. Running ops in his county, without his knowledge, not just once but twice, had pushed his level of endurance to its limit. And Cranston just took the damned cake. That son of a bitch had recruited Zeke ten years before when he had been with the FBI and Zeke had gone looking for an agent he could trust. When he\u2019d chosen Cranston, he\u2019d fucked up.</p><p>Cranston had begun the investigation without Zeke\u2019s knowledge and then had the gall to draw in three other citizens of the county instead of coming to him. Ex-marines known for their wild ways.</p><p>The Mackay cousins had spent the past two years on an investigation into stolen missiles and homegrown terrorists that Zeke had been waiting on Cranston to begin taking down. And before that, Rowdy had been too damned quiet about a stalker that had targeted his wife. They hadn\u2019t told him shit about their activities; now here they were, wanting to know about his.</p><p>They were wild and arrogant, and they made his life hell when they got involved in trouble. He\u2019d hoped marriage would have settled them down.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t believe it should have,\u201d Cranston answered as Dawg\u2019s lips parted to answer.</p><p>Dawg flashed the little man a brooding glare. Evidently, Dawg was aware he was lying, too.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t believe?\u201d Zeke kept his gaze on Dawg. \u201cDawg, you boys are newly married.</p><p>The three of you have babies on the way. Do you really want to spend a few nights in jail for withholding information on me again?\u201d</p><p>Three Mackays glared back at him. \u201cYour jail wouldn\u2019t survive it, Zeke,\u201d Rowdy stated.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t threaten us. Joe and Jaime were friends and their families are close to us.</p><p>Grandma Walker and their sister, Lisa, and her two boys are pretty much alone now.</p><p>The twins took care of them. We need to know what happened.\u201d</p><p>He stared back at Rowdy. Normally, Zeke would have believed him, but several years back, Rowdy had pulled his own bullshit over on Zeke. He hadn\u2019t forgotten it. There were times he wasn\u2019t sure he had forgiven it. He used to believe he was friends with these men, until he learned how easily they would hide the threats to the county he was duly sworn to protect.</p><p>They were here, and they didn\u2019t know shit about what he was doing; only Cranston was aware of it, and only because the other man was well aware of who and what Zeke was looking for. While they were here, he may as well get what information he could.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what happened yet. Not fully,\u201d he lied as he leaned forward and stared back at the cousins. \u201cDid those boys do hard drugs that you knew of?\u201d</p><p>They looked at each other in confusion before Rowdy shook his head firmly. \u201cJoe and Jaime were hell-raisers, but they didn\u2019t do the hard stuff.\u201d</p><p>Well, hell, that didn\u2019t help him much where the coroner\u2019s report was concerned.</p><p>\u201cDo you have the forensics\u2019 or coroner\u2019s report yet?\u201d Special Agent Timothy Cranston leaned forward in his chair, the wrinkled material of his cheap gray suit jacket shifting loosely on his shoulders.</p><p>\u201cCranston, what\u2019s your business in this?\u201d Zeke leaned back in his chair with a brooding look. \u201cIf this has anything to do with another operation in my county, then now\u2019s the time to give me a heads-up. Otherwise, I\u2019ll stop playing nice.\u201d</p><p>And that was Cranston\u2019s only warning. The agent was hiding too much information from him and Zeke was losing patience with him.</p><p>Timothy grunted. \u201cYou stopped playing nice when your buddies in the Justice Department kicked my ass last year. Now, I\u2019m being nice.\u201d His smile was all teeth.</p><p>\u201cJaney\u2019s upset over this. Rogue\u2019s her friend and mine. Those twins were her friends, and Janey asked me to see what I could find out. I\u2019d prefer not to pull in my own favors in D.C. at the moment, Sheriff. Might need those favors to get my job back.\u201d The lying bastard. \u201cSo why don\u2019t we all just play nice, and see if we can help each other here.\u201d</p><p>Which pretty much meant Cranston was involved up to his beady little eyes in Zeke\u2019s business. Playing along was easy enough, for the moment.</p><p>\u201cWell, hell,\u201d he growled, lifted the file, and tossed it closer to the edge of the desk.</p><p>\u201cInitial report. Joe was pumped on heroin. The city\u2019s investigative coroner still has the bodies, but this is the county coroner\u2019s initial findings. Joe was pumped, walked in, shot Jaime, then himself.\u201d</p><p>Natches lifted the file from the desk, sat back, and opened it. Two cousins and one portly Homeland Security agent read over his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cNot possible,\u201d Dawg murmured. \u201cJoe didn\u2019t do this shit, Zeke. And he wouldn\u2019t kill Jaime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDawg, I\u2019m doing my best with what I have here.\u201d Zeke sighed. \u201cForensics hasn\u2019t come up with anything yet. No vehicle tracks were found outside the twins\u2019 trailer, other than official vehicles that arrived that day. There was rumor of a fight over a girl, but no one knows who the girl was. There\u2019s just nothing to stand on here but my gut and your suspicions.

You know how it works. I\u2019ll wait until forensics and the coroner\u2019s investigator finish their reports. But initial calls to each aren\u2019t promising. Until then, I\u2019m asking questions and trying to piece this together.</p> <p>If Joe and Jaime were murdered, then someone knew what the hell they were doing, because I can\u2019t find so much as a whiff of suspicion. It\u2019s that simple.\u201d And it was a message to Cranston. Zeke knew who he was after; the agent could stay the hell out of his way if he didn\u2019t intend to play fair with Zeke in this little game.</p><p>\u201cDamn.\u201d Dawg rubbed at the back of his neck in a rough gesture.</p><p>Zeke\u2019s gut went haywire when he knew things weren\u2019t as they seemed. Dawg\u2019s and Rowdy\u2019s neck itched. Natches just became a time bomb with an assassin rifle. Who the hell knew what Cranston did; Zeke sure as hell couldn\u2019t figure him out.</p><p>The Mackays weren\u2019t happy, Zeke wasn\u2019t happy, Cranston was smiling, and Zeke knew that this was a bad sign. Welcome to Lake Cumberland, he thought caustically. The last few years had been hell, for law enforcement as well as citizens. Pulaski County was a quiet little place, despite the tourism to the lake.</p><p>The mountains, vibrant forests, fishing, and hometown atmosphere hadn\u2019t made up for the realization that a dark underbelly had been existing for decades beneath their notice.</p> <p>The operations Homeland Security had conducted, using the Mackay cousins as agents, had revealed a festering evil that Zeke had been fighting far longer than the Mackays could ever guess. It had become his own personal battle, the only way to make up for his sins as a child.</p><p>\u201cWhat about the explosion last night?\u201d Natches asked. \u201cTheir mobile home went up like fireworks. If it was murder-suicide rather than two homicides, then why would anyone bother to blow the place up?\u201d</p><p>Zeke lifted his shoulders in a shrug. \u201cI went over it with the state police and the arson investigator. We didn\u2019t find jack. There was a call made here to the office that there were vandals at the place. It went up in flames as Gene pulled into the driveway with the state police. There was no sign of a body.\u201d He lifted another file as he glanced at Cranston. \u201cThere was a gas stove in the mobile home that the arson investigator believes must have been faulty and caused the explosion.\u201d</p><p>Zeke didn\u2019t believe that for a moment. It was too easy and it was too similar to how he knew the League\u2019s exterminator worked. Zeke knew things the Mackays didn\u2019t. He knew things Cranston didn\u2019t. And he knew this was the work of someone from the homeland terrorist group that had escaped the net Cranston had used to pull the others in.</p><p>\u201cI have an idea.\u201d Cranston smiled as he leaned forward in his chair. \u201cRight now, whoever you\u2019re looking for, if this was a murder, knows you\u2019re looking for him. Let him think you\u2019re distracted, otherwise occupied.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeaning?\u201d Zeke gritted out. Cranston was a cunning bastard, but that didn\u2019t mean Zeke liked the games he played.</p> <p>\u201cI mean, let them think a woman has your attention. Concentrate on something pretty, pretend to be totally focused there, give your killer a chance to mess up rather than watching every move and every word because he\u2019s on guard.\u201d He shrugged his shoulders as he sat back in the chair. \u201cIt couldn\u2019t hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust use some poor woman as a tool to find a killer?\u201d Zeke snorted. \u201cHow did you make special agent, Cranston? Did you cheat on the exam?\u201d</p><p>Cranston chuckled at that. \u201cWhile you\u2019re occupied, myself, Alex Jansen, and the Mackays can watch your back. We\u2019ll see who\u2019s interested, and who\u2019s doing what. We can ask the questions needed much easier, and get more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cForget it,\u201d Zeke gritted out as he saw the mockery in the agent\u2019s eyes.</p><p>They both knew exactly who he was suggesting Zeke use. And Zeke sure as hell didn\u2019t like the excuse his lust was trying to grab with both hands.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Zeke,\u201d Dawg chided him harshly. \u201cThose were our friends. Let us help with this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need your help, Dawg, and I sure as hell don\u2019t need to pretend to be focused on a woman to solve this case. But if I learn anything new, I can let you know,\u201d Zeke told them with a complete lack of sincerity. \u201cUnlike some agents and kamikaze rednecks, I don\u2019t mind a bit of cooperating when the situation warrants it.\u201d His smile was all teeth this time. A reminder, a careful warning. He could be a friend, or he could be an enemy.</p><p>One more operation in his territory without his knowledge, and these men would find themselves on the enemy side. That wasn\u2019t a good place to be.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re worried about kamikaze rednecks when, according to every gossip source in Somerset, you\u2019re consorting with leather-wearing maniacal pixies?\u201d Dawg snorted.</p><p>\u201cHell, Zeke, even me and Natches were smart enough not to get mixed up with Rogue Walker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe turned you down,\u201d Natches reminded him as Zeke tensed. \u201cI was just smarter than to approach her.\u201d</p><p>All eyes turned to Natches.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell do you mean by that?\u201d The words slipped past Zeke\u2019s lips without control as a core of possessiveness seemed to slam into his chest. He\u2019d be damned if he\u2019d allow her to be insulted by these men.</p><p>Natches grinned. \u201cHell, Zeke, five years ago, you nearly lost your tongue when you met her at that town hall meeting when she arrived as a new schoolteacher. I have a rule, man. Don\u2019t mess with a buddy\u2019s woman.\u201d He rose from his chair, chuckling as Zeke narrowed his eyes on him. \u201c \u2019Bout time you made a move. Personally, I think she should tell you to go to hell for waiting so long. But that\u2019s just me. And Cranston\u2019s idea has merit. Grab Rogue with both hands and hold on for dear life. We\u2019ll watch your back and do what has to be done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one asked your opinion.\u201d Zeke ground the words past clenched teeth.</p><p>\u201cYeah, Chaya reminds me of that often.\u201d He laughed as he headed for the door, cousins and one special DHS agent following behind him. \u201cTell Rogue I said hi when you see her.\u201d</p><p>They left the office, and left Zeke with a raw, almost blinding sense of need where Rogue was concerned. Son of a bitch, he hadn\u2019t had enough of her last night. He\u2019d wanted it to be enough, convinced himself that he wouldn\u2019t feel what he knew he was going to feel today.</p><p>Lust had slammed into him. Even now, in the cold light of day, his balls were tight, his cock hard. The memory of her lips, like hot satin, the taste of her, equal parts liquor and female, the feel of her body, heated and molding to his, haunted him.</p><p>Rubbing his hands over his face, he tried to contain it, to push it back where it belonged, where other things he knew were not in his best interests were locked. Unfortunately, Rogue refused to stay locked away.</p><p>There were times he swore he could almost feel the silken warmth of her hair between his fingers as he caressed a fiery curl. He could almost feel her lips against his. He could almost imagine her taste. Almost. It was never enough, and the need to experience it again was making him crazy.</p><p>Lucinda and Shane hadn\u2019t helped his self-control the other night. Hell, Lucinda and Shane nothing. Damned nosy busybodies in town. Too many people had known he\u2019d gone to her apartment the night before, in plainclothes, and stayed too long. And too many gossips had put two and two together the next morning when it came to that reddened mark beneath her jaw.</p><p>Oh hell, he remembered leaving that mark. Remembered tasting her a little too deeply, too roughly. And she had loved it. Her head tilting back, her breath passing her lips in a hard sigh. She had done the same thing last night. Melted for him. Became slick and hot and ready for his touch.</p><p>Sweat collected along his spine as he shifted in his chair, trying to find a more comfortable position to accommodate the erect length of his dick. At this rate, he was going to die of a hard-on. It had to be dangerous for a man of his age to stay this hard for so long.</p><p>A sharp knock at his door had his attention turning from the need raging through him.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he called out.</p><p>The door opened and Gene stepped in slowly.</p><p>Well now, wasn\u2019t this just what he needed?</p><p>He stayed silent and waited as the deputy stepped into the room and closed the door behind him.</p><p>\u201cCan I have a minute, Zeke?\u201d Gene asked quietly.</p><p>He was dressed in the black- and-gray uniform, his hat clenched in his fingers as he faced Zeke across the room.</p><p>\u201cA minute.\u201d Zeke nodded.</p><p>Gene cleared his throat. \u201cI\u2019m still on schedule. I thought maybe we could talk about the other day. I was out of line.\u201d</p><p>A frown clenched Gene\u2019s weathered forehead as he raked back his dark hair and grimaced heavily. Zeke remained silent.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a problem with you, Zeke,\u201d he finally said. \u201cI got family issues goin\u2019 on, and I guess I was blowing off steam with the Walkers. I\u2019d like to make up for it.\u201d</p><p>Zeke hadn\u2019t filed the report against him, he hadn\u2019t initiated a suspension, simply because he hadn\u2019t had time. He and Gene had once been friends. Zeke had fought for the position as sheriff, and Gene had come on board as deputy for the same reasons Zeke had. Or so Zeke had once believed. To clean up the county, to find a way to eliminate Dayle Mackay\u2019s stranglehold here, and make up for the wrongs their fathers had committed.</p><p>He and Gene had promised themselves they would make up for those darker years.</p><p>Gene was a good deputy, and once, Zeke had known him as a good friend. But Zeke suspected now that Gene\u2019s loyalty might not run as deep as he\u2019d once believed it had.</p><p>\u201cEveryone deserves justice, Gene.\u201d He finally sighed as he watched the other man closely. \u201cWalkers are no different from anyone else. Hell, they weren\u2019t involved in that mess last year when some of our leading citizens were. I\u2019d say they were a damned sight better than some around here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree, Zeke.\u201d He nodded. \u201cI went off when I shouldn\u2019t have. It won\u2019t happen again.\u201d</p><p>Something had changed in Gene over the years, Zeke thought. He wasn\u2019t as compassionate, he wasn\u2019t as patient as he had once been. But hell, had he really ever been as diligent as Zeke knew he had wanted Gene to be? He hadn\u2019t been, and it was a fault Zeke had acknowledged a while back.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t as much Gene\u2019s fault as it was his own. He should have known better than to put Gene against his own father and the past he had shared with Zeke\u2019s father. Gene didn\u2019t have the demons Zeke had; he hadn\u2019t faced hell and turned his back on it.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll let this one go, Gene,\u201d he finally said. \u201cWe\u2019ll both see if we can\u2019t fix things in the future.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Zeke.\u201d Gene inhaled in relief as he moved to grip the doorknob. \u201cI\u2019ll head out on patrol then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGene.\u201d He stopped the other man before he left the office.</p><p>Gene turned back, his brown gaze curious.</p><p>\u201cYou said the Walker boys were fighting over a girl at the bar last week. Any gossip as to who they were fighting over?\u201d It was the one piece of information Zeke hadn\u2019t been able to uncover.</p><p>Gene lifted his hand and scratched thoughtfully at the side of his nose before shaking his head. \u201cThere was no name mentioned, now that I think about it. Just that Rogue had to throw them out because they were fighting, and the fight was over some girl both of them wanted.\u201d He frowned slowly. \u201cI didn\u2019t hear who the girl was.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Zeke nodded. No one else had heard, either. Just that it was over a girl.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll head out then.\u201d Gene opened the door, slid from the room, and closed it behind him, leaving Zeke alone to stare at the coroner\u2019s initial report that was lying on the desk.</p><p>Joe pumped up on heroin didn\u2019t make sense. Joe and Jaime fighting over a girl didn\u2019t make sense. Nothing about their deaths added up or pointed him in the right direction to look for evidence. All Zeke had was the fact that it was identical to a method the exterminator used. He knew it was, because his father had told him about it repeatedly when he\u2019d been a teenager. When he, too, had been a part of the Freedom League.</p> <p>He rubbed at his jaw, sat back in his chair, and visualized the murder scene again. The TV remote and the half a bottle of beer. But the television had been turned off.</p><p>There had been no drugs in the house, though Joe and Jaime weren\u2019t strangers to a little marijuana. There should have been some.</p><p>Jaime hadn\u2019t fought, he hadn\u2019t even tried to come out of his chair.</p><p>Joe had put the gun in his mouth and pulled the trigger within moments of killing his brother.</p><p>There were no signs of tears on his face or in his eyes. There were no defensive wounds to indicate he had been murdered. The gun was in his hand, his prints alone marking it.</p> <p>He closed his eyes and let the scene form in his head. There was something off there.</p><p>Something more than the lack of evidence for anything illegal, something more than that damned television being turned off, the remote in the exact position it would have been if it had fallen from Jaime\u2019s hand.</p><p>There had been traces of marijuana in Jaime\u2019s system, but heroin in Joe\u2019s. The coroner\u2019s report showed a single track mark in the arm. Nothing more. He\u2019d shot up only once and killed his brother while under the drug\u2019s influence.</p><p>Zeke knew it hadn\u2019t happened that way.</p><p>His eyes opened, his lips compressing as he rose from the desk and jerked his hat from the desk where he\u2019d tossed it.</p><p>He wanted to see the scene again, remember the layout of the bodies, and figure this out. The mobile home may have been blown to hell, but the ashes were still there, and Zeke could remember how it had been when he\u2019d found the bodies.</p> <p>Joe had shot up only once. Just that single time. And that was bullshit. Someone had managed to shoot him up and walk into that mobile home with him. Once there, the unsub had shot Jaime, then killed Joe.</p><p>Zeke left the office and headed from the building, walking into the warm April sunshine and ignoring the sharp pang of longing he felt at the sound of a motorcycle purring past the sheriff\u2019s department.</p><p>He looked, but it wasn\u2019t Rogue. Wild hellion curls weren\u2019t flowing back from the rider\u2019s face and a fun-loving, devil may-care smile wasn\u2019t aimed his way.</p><p>Hell, she was working, he knew. It was her afternoon at the restaurant, and if nothing else, Rogue was damned dependable in what she did.</p><p>He was the inconsistent one. He\u2019d lusted after her for years and fought against it. He\u2019d kissed her, then pushed her away. He ordered her not to bring another man between them, but he made damned certain he stayed as far away from her as possible. And when that hadn\u2019t worked he\u2019d at least tried to give her pleasure and satisfaction before walking away again. Staying away from her was killing him.</p><p>And he had to fight himself, daily now, not to go to her, not to take what he knew he could have, what she would willingly give him.</p><p>Twenty-six. She was twenty-six years old. Slender, delicate. Pixy wasn\u2019t far off when describing her. She barely topped his chest. She was fragile. She wasn\u2019t strong-boned; she wasn\u2019t mountain stock. Hell, she looked like a good breeze might blow her away, but still, she wasn\u2019t skinny. She was slender. Rounded where a woman should be rounded. Curvy and tempting. But too damned fragile, he had to remind himself as he pulled himself into the official Tahoe emblazoned with the Pulaski County sheriff\u2019s seal.</p><p>He could fuck all night, most nights. He was so damned testosterone driven that there were times he cursed it. When men he went to school with resorted to taking Viagra, Zeke still had the stamina he had had ten years before. Hell, there were times he wondered if he hadn\u2019t gotten worse as he\u2019d gotten older.</p> <p>It was a Mayes male trait, his father had once bragged. All Mayes men had a big dick and lots of fire, his father had been known to tell anyone who cared to listen.</p><p>It was definitely a Mayes trait, and one he wasn\u2019t happy with at the moment. If he had to take a little something to help his flesh get happy, then it might be better for him and Rogue both. Neither of them needed the complications that would come from the relationship he feared would evolve.</p><p>Because the fire wasn\u2019t the only Mayes trait. Zeke loved sex; he just managed to keep his lusts reined in and tried to turn them toward women he knew weren\u2019t looking for commitment or for something more than the hard ride he could give them.</p><p>Familiarity could breed a greater hunger. His marriage to Shane\u2019s mother had suffered beneath the desires that often tormented Zeke. Not all women had the hungers or the needs that Zeke knew; he\u2019d realized that with his wife before her death.</p><p>He\u2019d had to hide his needs because of her distaste of them. After her death, he\u2019d learned there were more women like her than he\u2019d realized. He was the odd one, the one that needed to put a handle on his unruly fantasies and needs.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t thought he was odd when he lived in L.A., when the friends he\u2019d made there had revealed their own darker desires. He didn\u2019t share his women. What was his was his, but damn, he liked to push them sexually.</p><p>He liked to play, to tempt, to tease a woman\u2019s body and watch her go crazy as she grew wet and wild. He loved seeing a lover with a black blindfold, his handcuffs circling her wrists, bare flesh between her thighs, sweet syrup glistening on feminine folds, and the heated flush of her flesh from an intimate spanking.</p><p>Or better. Ah, even better. A pretty, shapely ass raised for him, clenched rounded curves straining as he invaded a tender, sensitive little rear.</p><p>Perverted, his wife had called him. She\u2019d rage for days if he even tried to touch her there. And God forbid he should mention blindfolding her or spanking her. The insults she\u2019d thrown at him over that one had been nearly as bad the ones that had come when he suggested she shave or wax her pussy.</p><p>He was a hard lover. It was a part of him. It was something he\u2019d sworn he wouldn\u2019t deny himself after his wife\u2019s death, only to learn that more often than not finding a woman who enjoyed the kinkier sex was easier said than done. The women he\u2019d had affairs with liked their missionary position and their gentle loving, which could be good. But it was like having steak morning, noon, and night. Sometimes, a man craved a little variety, a little spice to his meal, or to his sex life.</p><p>And Rogue was definitely spice. All the more reason to stay the hell away from her.</p><p>Because all he could see was Rogue stretched out on his bed, her pretty violet eyes hidden by a silk blindfold, her hands cuffed, her little rear lifted to him.</p><p>She was a baby compared to him. He had no business fantasizing about her, and he had no business touching her. Despite her air of cynical sexuality, there was a glimmer of innocence in her eyes that warned him that the schoolteacher wasn\u2019t far below the surface.</p><p>The soft-spoken, tentative, shy young woman that had come to teach and had learned the dangers of a small town far faster than she should have. She was still there, and she still looked at him the same way she had looked at him at that town hall meeting. With stars and heat in her eyes.</p><p>Rogue. She was definitely wild as the wind and bordering lawless. But that schoolteacher still lurked beneath the surface. Soft, delicate, her smile shy, her violet eyes filled with curious sensuality.</p><p>She was like a delicate, sensual little bomb waiting to explode in his hands. In his hands, beneath his body, with his cock buried inside her.</p><p>And he couldn\u2019t allow it.</p><p>He had managed to contain himself over the years. Rumors of his desires had never leaked out because he never gave in to them. He didn\u2019t spank his lovers, he didn\u2019t handcuff them, and he didn\u2019t fuck their asses. He rode them hard and heavy and left them panting and exhausted at the end of the night.</p><p>That mark on Rogue\u2019s neck had surprised him. He hadn\u2019t even marked his wife Elaina\u2019s neck. He\u2019d never left a mark on a woman\u2019s flesh. Not beard burn and sure as hell not a bite mark. He\u2019d lost control in those few brief seconds that he had held her. Lost control of his need and his hunger. It was time to rein them in now. It was time to forget Rogue and get back to the business of finding a killer. The same killer that had taken his wife\u2019s and mother\u2019s lives in L.A., and then his father\u2019s, here in Kentucky.</p><p>The killer that would have no compunction in wiping out Rogue\u2019s existence if he thought it would serve his purpose. And if he learned Zeke was searching for him before Zeke managed to identify him, then it would definitely serve his purpose. It would destroy Zeke.</p><p>SEVEN</p><p>There was very little to be found in the remains of Joeand Jaime\u2019s mobile home.</p><p>Bedsprings, the springs on the couch and chair. Appliances were blackened and melted in spots; the rest was pretty much cinders. Standing at the edge of the burned remains, Zeke could remember what he had seen when he had been there the day he found the twins.</p><p>The burned, twisted metal left from the recliner became the chair Jaime had died in.</p><p>Surprise. There had been an expression of complete surprise frozen on his face. There had been something, someone he hadn\u2019t expected with his brother.</p><p>Zeke narrowed his eyes as he imagined how it could have played. Joe arriving, possibly high, not exactly himself, with a friend. They step into the house as Jaime stares at his brother in surprise. A second later, he was dead.</p><p>Zeke stepped into position, lifted his arm, and pointed his finger as though it were a weapon, imagined it firing, saw in his mind\u2019s eye where the bullet may have caught Jaime.</p><p>Either the killer was a quick aim, or he was taller than Zeke. Taller, Zeke thought. The killer\u2019s arm came up and he fired, dead center between Jaime\u2019s eyes before the other man could raise up in his chair.</p><p>Joe was high, but he would have been surprised by the shot. Turned a little, just enough.</p><p>The gun barrel against his head.Pop. Zeke imagined the shot, saw where it went, and nodded his head slowly.</p><p>\u201cBeen a long time since I\u2019ve seen you do that.\u201d</p><p>Zeke froze at the sound of Gene\u2019s voice behind him. Turning slowly, he found Gene\u2019s cruiser parked farther down the graveled road.</p><p>Zeke shrugged in answer to Gene\u2019s comment. \u201cIt\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve had to do it.\u201d</p><p>Gene shoved his hands into his uniform pockets and frowned as he stared around the small valley. \u201cGuess you were right about something not being right about those boys\u2019</p><p>deaths,\u201d he stated. \u201cSomeone made damned sure that fire was hot enough to wipe that trailer out.\u201d He turned and looked at Zeke in confusion. \u201cWhy the hell would someone want to kill those two boys?\u201d</p><p>Zeke breathed in heavily before turning away and staring out over the valley.</p><p>\u201cI figure it had something to do with the girl,\u201d he finally answered, and it struck him that he was having to tell too many damned lies lately in an attempt to protect the information he was looking for.</p><p>Gene didn\u2019t say anything. When Zeke turned back to him the other man was watching him closely.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t tell me stuff anymore, Zeke.\u201d He sighed. \u201cWe used to share cases like this.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, they had, until information had begun leaking from the office, until he had lost DHS\u2019s support and cooperation. It bit his ass that the Mackays had been involved in investigations that Zeke should have been a part of. He wouldn\u2019t have even known why he had been pushed out of it if his contact in Washington hadn\u2019t suggested that was the cause last year. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing personal, Gene,\u201d he told him, though that, too, was a lie. Gene had been a part of the Freedom League along with Zeke when they were younger. Zeke had believed Gene had gotten out after he left, but information he had dug up over the years suggested otherwise.</p><p>Gene nodded slowly as though accepting the explanation. \u201cDo you have any idea who the girl is?\u201d Gene finally asked.</p><p>Zeke shook his head. \u201cNo clue. And that\u2019s damned strange in this town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo kidding,\u201d Gene snorted. \u201cI\u2019ve asked around myself and haven\u2019t gotten any answers. Those boys didn\u2019t seem to trust anyone where she was concerned.\u201d</p> <p>Zeke felt a pulse of energy at Gene\u2019s statement. If Joe and Jaime didn\u2019t trust anyone with their potential lover\u2019s identity, then it was because they were afraid of someone. A member of her family. Father, brother, or uncle most likely.</p><p>The manner of their deaths was consistent with the exterminator\u2019s killing style, or at least one of them. Could the man he was searching for have a daughter? A daughter the boys were messing with?</p><p>\u201cGuess they kept her too much of a secret,\u201d Zeke said slowly as he turned back to Gene.</p><p>\u201cShe could be our only clue to who killed these boys.\u201d</p><p>Gene nodded. \u201cYeah.\u201d He ran his hand through his hair before replacing his hat and grimacing. \u201cToo damned bad, too. A man doesn\u2019t deserve to die like that.\u201d</p> <p>Zeke nodded to that before making his way along the graveled parking lot back to his Tahoe. \u201cI\u2019m heading back to town then,\u201d he told his deputy. \u201cSee you tomorrow, Gene.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, sure, Zeke,\u201d Gene answered pensively. \u201cI\u2019ll see you tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>What the hell was Gene doing following him? Zeke wondered as he pulled away from the wreckage of the mobile home. His deputy hadn\u2019t cared to share a murder case with Zeke in a while. He\u2019d taken patrol while Zeke normally worked with the state or Somerset city police himself to solve the crimes committed in the county.</p><p>Gene was hiding something, Zeke knew that. He knew the other man, sometimes better than he wanted to. And he knew Gene was keeping an eye on him for someone else. For the remaining members of the League, Zeke suspected.</p><p>Despite the knowledge he could feel burning in his gut, he knew if he didn\u2019t come up with something soon on this case, then he would have to put it aside, close it, and let it stand as a murder-suicide. And that just pissed him off. There was something about this case that had his nerves on edge every time he thought about it. Something he knew he wasn\u2019t seeing, and should.</p><p>He\u2019d questioned every associate of the Walker boys that he could think of. He was pushing the coroner to push the investigative coroner, and he was harassing forensics to find something more. The only ones he hadn\u2019t questioned yet were Joe and Jaime\u2019s younger sister, Lisa, and their grandmother. That he would be taking care of soon.</p> <p>Turning into the graveled lane that led to the Walker house, Zeke grimaced at the sight of the black Harley parked in the barren drive.</p><p>It looked pristine and out of place among the straggling weeds and clumps of grass that surrounded the house and the run-down sedan parked next to it.</p><p>The house was in need of several coats of paint, maybe a few new boards on the porch.</p><p>The home itself was sturdy though. Joe and Jaime had always made certain their grandmother\u2019s home was kept in good repair while Lisa oversaw her care.</p><p>As he stepped out of the Tahoe the door opened and Lisa, rounded and somber, stepped out on the porch. Grief had ravaged her pretty, pale face. Weariness gave her blue eyes a bruised, haunted look and thinned her lips as she watched him approach.</p><p>\u201cGrandmother\u2019s awake,\u201d she breathed tiredly as he stepped up onto the porch. \u201cShe\u2019s been demanding that I call you since we got back from Louisville.\u201d</p><p>Zeke\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cIs everything okay?\u201d</p><p>Lisa shook her head. \u201cYou mean other than the gossip that one of her favorite grandsons killed his brother, then himself? God, Zeke, this is killing her faster than the pneumonia is.\u201d</p> <p>Tears sparkled in her eyes as he wrapped his arms around her shoulders for a quick hug and looked inside the house where Rogue was staring back at him silently.</p><p>\u201cI need to talk to you, and to your grandmother if she\u2019s up to it,\u201d he told Lisa. \u201cAre you up to that, Lisa?\u201d</p><p>She nodded against his chest before moving back. \u201cWhatever it takes to find whoever did this. Joe wouldn\u2019t have killed Jaime. It just wouldn\u2019t happen, Zeke. And now even our memories of them are being stripped. What the hell happened to their home?\u201d</p><p>Yeah, that was what everyone else was telling him, too. As for the mobile home, he just didn\u2019t have the answers he knew she needed.</p><p>Lisa turned away and led him into the house. To face Rogue. He stared into violet eyes and damned if he knew what to do. He wanted her in his arms, he wanted to lower his head and kiss those shimmering lips, and at the same time he was aware of the dangers that lurked there.</p><p>Zeke Mayes hadn\u2019t publicly claimed a woman since his wife had died. He kept his affairs hidden and his desires carefully controlled. And controlling them had never been as hard as it was now.</p><p>As he stared at her, the heated wonder in Rogue\u2019s gaze seemed to dim when he did nothing. She turned away, her spine stiff beneath the white T-shirt she wore, her hips twitching angrily beneath her jeans as she moved toward the back of the house.</p><p>All those long, fiery curls were restrained in a braid that fell below her shoulders. She looked younger than her age, but that did nothing to cool the fire burning in his dick.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll check on Grandma, Lisa, then make coffee. You talk to Zeke,\u201d she called back.</p><p>Zeke nearly followed her. He almost moved to grab her, to pull her back, and give her what he knew she needed. What he needed. A touch, an affirmation that there was more between them than the simple friendship he had claimed for so long.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not going to wait on you forever,\u201d Lisa said behind him, her voice quiet.</p><p>Zeke turned and narrowed his eyes on her as her lips curved into a sad little smile.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the hazard of living where everyone knows everyone.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cPeople start seeing things when they see you every day. And Rogue\u2019s not nearly as good at hiding what she wants as you are.\u201d</p><p>He rubbed at the back of his neck, blowing out a hard breath.</p><p>\u201cI need to talk to you about Joe and Jaime,\u201d he told her, ignoring her advice. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Lisa, but if I don\u2019t get some evidence to the contrary soon, then I\u2019m going to have to rule their deaths as a murder-suicide.\u201d</p><p>Her lips trembled, but she nodded in acceptance. \u201cI don\u2019t know much, Zeke. I know they were seeing some girl. They fought over her at first. Joe was angry with Jaime for a couple days, then . . .\u201d She blushed and shrugged. \u201cYou know how they were. When they argued over something like that, they either ended up both doing without it or sharing it.\u201d</p><p>He moved to the threadbare though clean easy chair as she sat on the matching couch.</p><p>\u201cSo they were sharing a woman? Do you know who it was?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if it had gone that far yet.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cAnd they wouldn\u2019t tell me who the girl was. They just said her daddy would have a stroke if he found out. That was a couple of days before you found them.\u201d A tear slipped down her cheek.</p><p>\u201cYou were close to your brothers, Lisa,\u201d he stated. \u201cYou\u2019ve always known what they were doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd who they were doing,\u201d she said mockingly, bitterly. \u201cBut they weren\u2019t talking this time. They did that sometimes though, if their lover didn\u2019t want anyone to know, then they didn\u2019t tell, Zeke. You know how it is around here. Joe and Jaime knew how to keep their secrets, even from me. Most of the time I only found out by accident when they were dating someone together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid they say anything more about the father?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cThey didn\u2019t say anything more, period.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cThe next day I was at the hospital with Grandma. There was no time to question them, and I was worried about Grandma. I didn\u2019t think.\u201d Another tear slipped free. \u201cI just didn\u2019t think to question them about it.\u201d</p><p>Another damned dead end and a secret that had killed. The story of his life for too many years to count.</p><p>\u201cWere Joe and Jaime involved in anything else?\u201d he asked her then. \u201cAny kind of drugs?\u201d</p><p>A flash of anger darkened her eyes. \u201cJoe and Jaime didn\u2019t do drugs, Zeke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe found evidence of pot in the house, Lisa; could they have been involved with anything stronger?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, that\u2019s like finding a beer in the house,\u201d she exclaimed. \u201cCome on, Zeke, pot\u2019s not that big of a deal around here and you know it. Sure, they smoked a little of it, but never a lot. And Joe and Jaime didn\u2019t do the hard stuff.\u201d</p><p>He tightened his jaw for long moments, staring back at her, hating the questions he had to ask.</p><p>\u201cLisa, I need you to think for me, to be very sure. Now\u2019s not the time to try to protect Joe and Jaime, not if you want me to figure out what happened to them. Did you ever know of them doing heroin or anything stronger than a little pot?\u201d</p><p>She stared back at him as though he were a stranger now. As though he were accusing her brothers of some heinous crime.</p><p>\u201cNever, Zeke,\u201d she finally answered. \u201cAnd I would have known. Plain and simple, they didn\u2019t have the money or the personalities for that junk. Joe and Jaime liked to play, they liked to have fun, and they didn\u2019t consider hardcore drugs as fun.\u201d</p><p>He nodded at that. Joe and Jaime didn\u2019t do hard drugs. That was what everyone said.</p><p>But someone was trying to make it look as though Joe at least had done something a lot stronger than a little pot.</p><p>\u201cZeke?\u201d He turned to Rogue\u2019s melodious voice, his body tightening, his cock giving an eager jerk at the pure, sweet sound that wrapped around his head. \u201cGrandma Walker wants to talk to you. She said you can come in here and discuss her boys with her or you can face her once she\u2019s strong enough to get to your office. It\u2019s your choice.\u201d</p><p>He grimaced at that. Callie Walker was hell on wheels when she was pissed off. If she made it to the sheriff\u2019s office, it would be an event no one was likely to forget for a while. Callie Walker would flay the hide off a man at twenty paces with a look alone.</p><p>He rose from his seat. \u201cI\u2019ll talk to her.\u201d Turning back to Lisa, he felt a senseless frustrated anger filling him. They were expecting him to fix this. To figure things out and make someone pay. He couldn\u2019t make anyone pay without proof, and proof was sadly lacking.</p><p>Rogue watched Zeke as he moved into Grandma Walker\u2019s room. She could hear his voice, low, deep as he talked to the old woman. It was gentle, soothing. Grandma Walker wouldn\u2019t be with them much longer, and she knew it, ached because of it. The death of her two favorite grandsons hadn\u2019t helped anything.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t Rogue\u2019s grandmother, though the old woman had all but adopted her. The relationship was distant\u2014she was a cousin to Rogue\u2019s father\u2014but Rogue couldn\u2019t have loved her more if she had been her own grandmother.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s crazy about you,\u201d Lisa said softly as Rogue moved into the room. \u201cHe couldn\u2019t take his eyes off you.\u201d</p><p>Rogue snorted at that. \u201cNot hardly, Lisa.\u201d</p><p>Lisa shook her head. \u201cHe\u2019s always watched you just as hard as you watch him,\u201d she said. \u201cHe likes to deny it just as hard as you do.\u201d</p><p>Who said she was denying her part of it?</p><p>Rogue let a soft smile tilt her lips as she sat down on the couch and drew Lisa down with her. The other girl was exhausted. She\u2019d been trying to take care of her grandmother and her two twin boys at the same time for months. Divorced and on edge, the pressure was beginning to show on her pretty face. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHow are the boys doing?\u201d</p><p>A small sparkle lit Lisa\u2019s eyes. She loved her boys. \u201cThey\u2019re with their dad tonight.\u201d She finally sighed. \u201cWith Joe and Jaime\u2019s deaths and Grandma\u2019s illness, I had to beg him to help me with them. There\u2019s just not enough hours in the day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you need anything, you\u2019ll let me know?\u201d Rogue asked.</p> <p>\u201cI will,\u201d Lisa murmured, but Rogue knew her. Lisa wouldn\u2019t tell her if she was starving; Rogue had to guess at it. She had to buy groceries and get someone else to deliver them or face Lisa\u2019s anger. She had to slip in when Lisa wasn\u2019t around and pay home health for Grandma Walker\u2019s medicines and hospital bills. Lisa was proud as hell and she hated taking money from anyone, especially family.</p><p>Her head turned as Zeke moved back into the room. She fought her response to him, fought to keep her expression clear of the need and the hunger that burned inside her.</p><p>He was dressed in jeans again and his uniform shirt. A black official sheriff\u2019s hat perched on his head. His badge was clipped to his belt and he looked so damned sexy it made her mouth water. Her hands itched to touch him, her lips felt swollen, inflamed for his kiss.</p><p>Rising to her feet, she watched him expectantly. She wanted him until she was consumed by it, but she also remembered why he was there.</p><p>\u201cHad the boys told her anything?\u201d Rogue asked as Lisa stood beside her.</p> <p>He shook his head, his eagle-fierce gaze going between her and Lisa.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d he breathed out roughly. \u201cIf forensics or the coroner\u2019s investigator doesn\u2019t come up with anything, I\u2019m going to have to close this case.\u201d</p><p>He knew something, she knew he did. She knew that closed little look, that official expression, and she hated it.</p><p>\u201cI need to head out,\u201d he told them, heading for the door. \u201cIf the two of you think of anything, then don\u2019t hesitate to let me know.\u201d</p><p>With a slight little nod of his head he walked to the door. Rogue let him get outside before she gave Lisa a quick good- bye, grabbed her backpack, and followed him.</p><p>\u201cSheriff?\u201d She kept her voice casual, composed.</p> <p>Show no weakness, she warned herself. No familiarity. Stay distant. Zeke didn\u2019t like public displays of anything from women, and she knew it.</p><p>He paused by the Tahoe, watching her curiously as she moved toward him.</p><p>\u201cWe need to talk,\u201d she told him, keeping her voice low despite the fact that there were no neighbors.</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d he asked carefully.</p><p>\u201cJoe and Jaime.\u201d She propped her hands on her hips as she faced him. \u201cWhat have you really learned?\u201d</p><p>His arms went over his chest, his gaze became hooded. \u201cNothing conclusive,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you have that isn\u2019t conclusive?\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed, his jaw bunched, and for a second she saw lust blaze in his eyes.</p> <p>He grimaced as he glanced over her shoulder to the house. \u201cAre you busy this afternoon?\u201d</p><p>Surprised, Rogue shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m off the rest of the day. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFollow me to the house,\u201d he stated, opening his door and stepping into the Tahoe.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll talk there.\u201d</p><p>Follow him? To his house?</p><p>Rogue knew his farm wasn\u2019t far from Grandma Walker\u2019s. It was sheltered, private.</p><p>Hidden. Just as his relationships and his women stayed as hidden as he could manage.</p><p>She nodded slowly before moving away. He started the Tahoe as she moved away and was backing out of the drive as she straddled the Harley and started it with a flick of her wrist.</p><p>The rumble of power filled her senses, reminding her of Zeke.</p><p>Kicking the stand up, she maneuvered the cycle back, turned, and hit the gas as Zeke\u2019s vehicle moved ahead of her.</p><p>Why his house? she wondered. Her heart was racing in her chest through the drive, her palms sweating. She could feel the wind against her breasts, her nipples peaking in anticipation, and she knew why. It wasn\u2019t because they couldn\u2019t talk in the Walker driveway; it was because Zeke had no intention of talking.</p><p>What were her intentions though? God, she didn\u2019t want to become one of his hidden little secrets. One of the women that he kept behind closed doors and never claimed in public. But her body was raging. The memory of his touch, the need for more was building inside her like a volcano ready to explode.</p><p>She dreamed about him. She ached for him. She was the biggest fool living if she allowed him to do that to her.</p><p>Nothing ventured, nothing gained, another part of her argued. She would never know if she didn\u2019t try.</p><p>He was going to break her heart, her head warned her, but she was damned if she could stop it from happening. Zeke was her weakness, and she knew it.</p><p>She made the turn onto the farm behind him. The graveled road was long and winding, moving through the valley and angling up and around to another smaller, clear valley where the two-story wood-sided house sat beneath the blazing sun. It was surrounded on three sides by forests, and in the back led directly to the back-waters of Lake Cumberland.</p><p>A glimmer of water could be seen through the trees; the scent of it surrounded her as Zeke drew the Tahoe into an opened two-car garage and then motioned her in beside him.</p><p>The doors slid closed as the engines shut off. Rogue closed her eyes for a second, realizing what he was doing. Hiding her Harley, hiding her presence.</p><p>Breathing in deeply, she kicked the stand into place before swinging from the cycle.</p><p>Pulling the small backpack from her shoulders, she looped it over the bar on the back of the seat, all the while watching as he moved toward her.</p><p>His expression was predatory. It was hungry.</p><p>\u201cHiding me, Zeke?\u201d She couldn\u2019t keep the question inside as he came abreast of her.</p><p>He paused, stared down at her as some shadow of emotion flickered in his eyes.</p><p>Zeke couldn\u2019t believe he\u2019d allowed his control to slip this far. He never brought a woman to his home. Ever. But he couldn\u2019t stand it any longer. Need was eating him alive, the hunger for the taste of her was wearing at his control until he was like a man possessed.</p><p>It was get her here, or take her in the damned driveway in clear view of Lisa and her grandmother. Now, wouldn\u2019t that just give rise to enough gossip to fuel this county for the next decade?</p><p>\u201cCome on.\u201d He didn\u2019t answer her question. Instead, he gripped her arm and pulled her to the door, only distantly aware of the fact that she hadn\u2019t tried to shove his balls to his throat.</p><p>Men didn\u2019t manhandle Rogue, she didn\u2019t allow it. Until him.</p><p>\u201cYou are so pushing your luck,\u201d she warned him as he slammed the garage door behind them and swung around to face her.</p><p>\u201cYou think I\u2019m not aware of that?\u201d he asked.</p><p>He knew damned good and well he was pushing his luck.</p><p>\u201cGet ready,\u201d he warned her. \u201cI\u2019m about to push further.\u201d</p><p>Already part of his control was lost. The ability to deny her, to deny the hunger pulsing through him, tempting him. It was shot to damned hell, the edges frayed and broken.</p><p>But another kind of control kicked in. Instinctive. Dominant.</p><p>His fingers curved around her jaw, pushing her head back as a rush of breath parted her lips and her violet eyes darkened, widened.</p><p>Did she like it?</p><p>Her face flushed as he held her. One hand at her hip, the other controlling her head. His nostrils flared as he drew her scent in. The smell of the mountains rushed around her as the breeze had while she rode. Beneath it was the simple, clean scent of desire and femininity. The smell of the woman that tempted him into his dreams and through every second of reality.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a weakness,\u201d he told her, letting his thumb stroke over her jaw as he backed her against the wall.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Her breathing was deep, rough. \u201cI\u2019m surprised, Zeke. I thought big, bad sheriff didn\u2019t have a weakness?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmart-ass.\u201d His gaze dropped to her lips.</p><p>Tempting, sweet, her tongue licked over them slowly. Teasingly.</p><p>\u201cNow I\u2019m a smart-ass, too,\u201d she whispered, her tone sensual, sexually weak.</p><p>The sound of her need had his dick throbbing. His balls were tight, the need wrapping around him like manacles as he stared down at her, fighting it, fighting what he knew he was going to do.</p><p>\u201cDamn you,\u201d he growled.</p><p>His head lowered, and she was waiting on him. Waiting for him.</p><p>Kittenish little nails dug into his scalp as his lips covered hers and fire erupted through his system. Heat blazed along his nerve endings, dominance and overwhelming sexual starvation erupted through his mind.</p><p>She tasted like sunshine. Like spring. She kissed like the hottest caress of the sun, her lips parting beneath his, her tongue meeting his, her body arching like a slender tree before the force of a summer storm.</p><p>He was lost. Son of a bitch, he was lost in her and he knew it.</p><p>Nothing mattered but more. Kissing her deeper, stronger. Fueling the desire inside her to the depth that his had been fueled. Wiping her mind of everything, anything, but his touch, his taste. Because that was what she did to him. She wiped away the control he prized so highly and revealed the man he kept hidden from the world.</p><p>Because Zeke knew he had never kissed another woman like he was kissing Rogue now.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t just hunger, it was dominance. It was the dark central core of his sexuality moving in and claiming, when he had never claimed before.</p><p>He controlled the kiss. He held her face in place, fingers on the pressure points of her jaw, keeping her mouth open to him, controlling her ability to wrest that dominance from him. And she was trying. She tempted and she teased, licked at his tongue and tried to suckle it. She moaned when he refused to allow her the upper hand. Her body arched, her nails dug into his scalp, and her hips arched to cushion the hard-on raging beneath his jeans.</p><p>Just this kiss, he had told himself once, long ago. If he could just have this kiss, he would be satisfied. But the kiss only pushed him closer to the brink, made that dominant core stronger, more insistent.</p><p>He let her suckle his tongue lightly before pulling back. He wanted to see her lips wrapped around his cock like that. He wanted to hear her moaning around the thick, hard crest as he shot his release to her throat.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re dangerous.\u201d He pulled back, nipped at her lips warningly as she tried to follow his kiss.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m lost.\u201d She sighed, fingers trailing to his neck, her nails prickling over his flesh.</p><p>\u201cKiss me again, Zeke. One more time.\u201d</p><p>Her lashes lifted, showing the brilliance of dark, dark violet eyes. Her lips were swollen, her cheeks flushed as her breasts rose and fell roughly.</p><p>\u201cTake the shirt off.\u201d He released her and stepped back enough to allow her to move.</p><p>\u201cLet me see you.\u201d</p><p>Her face flushed deeper, the color tempting him as it washed over her neck and beneath the collar of the T-shirt.</p><p>Her tongue ran over her lips. Her hands moved to the low-rise waist of her jeans. The metal button slid free.</p><p>His hand caught hers, his gaze narrowing. \u201cJust the shirt, Rogue. Nothing else. Pull it off.\u201d</p><p>She shivered, her eyes shadowed with wariness and excitement as she pulled the material free and eased it up and over her head.</p><p>Zeke felt his jaw tighten as he tried to push back the darker aspects of the man slipping free.</p><p>\u201cThe braid,\u201d he said. \u201cLoosen it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re bossy.\u201d Her pouty little grin was filled with challenge and defiance despite the fact that her hands lifted to work her hair free.</p><p>He watched her breasts beneath the white skimpy lace of her bra. The material barely covered the hard, pointed flesh of her nipples. The cotton-candy pink tips had his teeth clenching with the need to taste them.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d he crooned as her hair fell around her shoulders and down her back.</p><p>His hands lifted to the silken strands, though he kept his gaze on her breasts. \u201cNow take the bra off.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cTake your shirt off first,\u201d she whispered. \u201cIf you want, Zeke, you can give.\u201d</p><p>And take his hands from her hair? It wasn\u2019t going to happen. He bunched his fingers in the silken strands, lowered his head, and took her lips again. He took her with the kiss.</p><p>Claimed her. His lips slanted over hers, his tongue working in her mouth until she was moaning and straining closer, her wicked little fingers at the buttons of his shirt, struggling to release them.</p> <p>She was fire in his arms and he knew it. Controlling her sexuality would never be easy.</p><p>Hell, he\u2019d never control it; he didn\u2019t want to control it. He wanted to harness it. He wanted it to burn out of control while he let the flames twist around him.</p><p>A second later, he felt buttons pop as the material of his shirt parted, revealing his chest.</p><p>He pulled his head back, ignored her need for more, and stared down at her.</p><p>\u201cThe bra,\u201d he demanded.</p> <p>He wanted to suck those sweet, hard little tips into his mouth again. He wanted to taste her, feel her shuddering in his arms.</p><p>Her hands were trembling, her fingers clumsy as she worked the clasp between her breasts loose and shed the bra.</p><p>Hell yeah. This was what he wanted.</p><p>\u201cHow pretty.\u201d One hand moved from her hair to cup a hard, swollen mound and caress it.</p><p>\u201cZeke?\u201d She whispered his name, her voice nervous, uncertain.</p><p>And innocent. The innocence was like throwing gas onto a fire. Damn her. Damn his own depravity because he wanted nothing more than to turn that shade of innocence to sexual knowledge.</p> <p>\u201cDoes it feel good?\u201d He let his thumb rub over the sensitive tip. \u201cShould I stop, sweetheart?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, her lashes drifting closed as his head lowered.</p><p>\u201cYou know what I\u2019m going to do, don\u2019t you, Rogue?\u201d</p><p>How innocent was she? That question tormented him. Was her experience limited to the event that produced those pictures or had she had more than that couple for a lover?</p><p>Not much more, he decided as his lips brushed over the curve of her breast and she shivered beneath the caress.</p><p>\u201cDrive me crazy?\u201d she accused him, her voice thick.</p><p>He almost chuckled, because that was exactly what he intended to do.</p><p>Keeping his gaze locked with hers, his lips parted, his head lowered. He watched her face, insane lust rising inside him as his lips closed over a tight, hard peak.</p> <p>Rogue cried out. The sound wouldn\u2019t stay inside, the need wouldn\u2019t abate. When his lips closed over the ultrasensitive flesh of her nipple she felt electricity sizzle from the tight tip to the swollen bud of her clit.</p><p>She stared down at him in wonder, watching the way his thick, dark lashes fell against his cheeks. The way his cheeks hollowed, his lips drew on her. The sensations were incredible. Electricity and heat sizzled through her, firing her cells and nerve endings, turning her into a shuddering mass of sensation.</p><p>\u201cZeke.\u201d She whimpered his name, she couldn\u2019t help it. It was incredible. It was a pleasure that drove all rational thought from her mind and had her shuddering in reaction.</p><p>She was on the verge of climax. She could feel the sensations whipping around her clit, pushing her closer. He had one hand in her hair, pulling at the heavy strands. The other was wrapped around her breast, fingers stroking, caressing it, plumping it.</p><p>Shudders raced through her. She needed more. So much more. She was so close, just a little bit closer, just a little bit more. Then his teeth gripped the hard tip and exerted just enough pressure to bring her to her tiptoes and send little quakes of near- release tearing through her body.</p><p>It was fingers of lightning wrapping around her clit. It was heat. It was a shuddering, vibrating rasp beneath her flesh that had her arching, pressing her sex against his thigh, writhing and exploding in pure white-hot pleasure.</p><p>\u201cThat was very, very bad, Rogue,\u201d he growled. \u201cI wasn\u2019t ready for you to come yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my,\u201d she panted. \u201cWasn\u2019t that too bad?\u201d</p><p>Her lips curled in satisfied pleasure. She wasn\u2019t finished by a long shot, but she was definitely vibrating from the pleasure that had spiraled through her. She was weak, almost relaxed, and waiting for more.</p><p>\u201cMy turn,\u201d he growled, and excitement sizzled through her veins as he pulled back, turned her, and leaned against the wall.</p><p>Rogue licked her lips, then raked her teeth over the lower curve as he took her hands and pulled them to his belt. His gaze was narrowed, watching, probing. Something warned her that if he ever realized she had never done this before, then she could kiss him good-bye right now.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t saying a damned thing.</p><p>The metal button released, the zipper rasped down. A second later she was swallowing tightly as the dark-crested length of his erection was pulled free.</p><p>He palmed the shaft, watched her intently.</p><p>Okay. She\u2019d read about this. She\u2019d watched it on some movies she\u2019d rented. She\u2019d dreamed about doing it. She ached to taste him.</p><p>She laid her lips against his chest and felt him tighten. One hand returned to her hair, his fingers bunching in it as he pressed her closer, lower.</p><p>He tasted hot and male, wild. The short chest hairs tickled her nose, but the taste of his flesh was more than worth it. Feeling him tighten, feeling the power that surged through her as his groan echoed around her.</p><p>He enjoyed her touch.</p><p>She flattened her hands on his abdomen, slid them down slowly as she moved lower, lower. Her heart was racing in her chest, fear and desire, excitement and uncertainty racing through her.</p><p>She wanted him to enjoy her touch. She was terrified he would guess her inexperience.</p><p>Remember the movies, she told herself. Those women knew what they were doing.</p><p>Think, Rogue. Think.</p><p>Her lips slid over his abdomen as she gripped his thighs. He was breathing hard, his abs flexing, his thighs tight.</p><p>Brushing his hand away from his erection she let her fingers curl around it and moaned at the feeling of silk-covered, heated iron. Blood throbbed along the heavy shaft as a bead of moisture gathered in the small slit on the crest.</p><p>She was breathless, mesmerized. Kneeling before him, holding the hard length of his cock in her hand, she felt alive, energized.</p><p>Her tongue peeked from between her lips, lapped at the creamy droplet, and her lashes fluttered over her eyes at the salty male taste of him combined with the sensual sound of a male curse of pleasure.</p><p>Okay, she was doing okay.</p><p>She licked and his hands tightened in her hair. She opened her lips and drew the hard crown between them, sucking it into her mouth, and felt his other hand slide into her hair, holding her in place.</p><p>\u201cDamn, Rogue.\u201d The sound of his voice was a spark of pleasure along her clit and inside her aching sex. \u201cAh God. That\u2019s good. So fucking good.\u201d</p><p>She was so fucking good.</p><p>She sucked him deeper, rolled her tongue along the sensitive undercrest in an imitation of what she had read, and was rewarded by a savage flexing of the shaft she still held.</p><p>Oh God. This was so good. He was here, she was touching him, sucking him, and he was enjoying it. His hips were moving as she sucked, fucking against her mouth with smooth, controlled movements.</p><p>Rogue was shaking with anticipation now. Zeke was leaning back against the wall, his thighs were taut, his abdomen flexing, his cock throbbing between her lips as she caressed and licked, sucked and moaned around the rapidly thrusting flesh.</p><p>She stroked the shaft with both hands now, needing him. She wanted to taste him, wanted to feel him spilling into her mouth, wanted a part of him that she had never known from any other man.</p><p>\u201cDamn. Yeah,\u201d he groaned as her lashes lifted, her gaze locking with his.</p><p>And it was sexier. It was making her crazy. She could feel herself creaming, saturating her panties with her juices as he held her head tighter.</p><p>\u201cRogue, baby. I\u2019m going to come. Damn.\u201d He grimaced, his expression tortured as his breath became rougher. \u201cPull back.\u201d</p><p>He pulled at her hair as defiance flashed through her. She wasn\u2019t pulling back. This was hers. She had waited, fantasized. She had studied, ached. He wasn\u2019t stealing this from her.</p><p>\u201cSweetheart. Damn you. I\u2019m going to come, Rogue. Straight down your damned throat if you don\u2019t pull back.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t pulling back. Her tongue worked beneath the thrusting shaft, her mouth suckled, drawing him deeper between her lips.</p><p>\u201cFuck.\u201d</p><p>She felt his cock flex. He stilled, then dangerously tightened before a low groan preceded the first hard spurt of semen from the heavy cock head as it sank nearly to her throat.</p><p>Oh God. She felt herself shaking, trembling. She was coming. She could feel it. Her thighs tightened as her clit vibrated and throbbed and a lash of heat seared her body as he held her in place, growled her name, and spilled more of the heated, silken release to her mouth.</p><p>\u201cAh fuck,\u201d he gasped. \u201cRogue. Son of a bitch, your mouth.\u201d</p><p>His groan was followed by a slam. The slam of a door, a moment of surging tension.</p><p>\u201cOh hell.\u201d A youthful male voice squeaked. \u201cOh fuck! Hell!\u201d The door slammed again as Rogue\u2019s eyes widened, staring up into Zeke\u2019s harsh, granite expression as he stared across the room.</p><p>At the door straight across from them. The outside door. The one that would have given a clear view to exactly what the hell was going on. That someone being Zeke\u2019s son.</p><p>If mortification could kill.</p><p>Rogue drew back and stumbled to her feet, her horrified gaze turning to the door, then to Zeke. He was still hard. Sweat sheened his chest and icy fury marked his expression.</p><p>\u201cWell.\u201d She swallowed. She could still taste him. She still burned for him. \u201cI guess I can forget this going any further, huh?\u201d</p><p>His gaze sliced to her silently.</p><p>Yeah. That was what she figured.</p><p>\u201cGo talk to your son, Zeke.\u201d She picked up her clothes from the floor when she really wanted to sink to the tile and sob. \u201cI\u2019ll get dressed and head home. Maybe I\u2019ll see you again . . . sometime.\u201d</p><p>She turned away from him. She wanted him to say something, anything. To blame her, to rage, whatever. After all, his teenage son had just caught him getting a blow job in the kitchen. It had to be a major catastrophe in any man\u2019s life. It was sure as hell a major catastrophe in her life.</p><p>\u201cGo home,\u201d he told her, his voice hard despite its very softness. \u201cWe\u2019ll talk later.\u201d</p><p>Uh-huh. She just bet they would. Like never.</p><p>She glared at his retreating back as she jerked her bra on and hurriedly clipped it. With shaking hands she pulled her shirt over her head and jammed her arms into the proper holes. She held back her tears. She held back her anger.</p><p>Until she backed the Harley out of the garage. She hit the gas, spun enough gravel to leave a trench, and raced for the main road.</p><p>Fuck him. Fuck it all. She\u2019d had enough.</p><p>EIGHT</p><p>Shane was slightly in shock. He paced the backdeck, ran his fingers through his hair, and mumbled another curse. Hell. Some things a guy didn\u2019t need to know about.</p><p>Sometimes, a guy needed to be a little more careful.</p><p>Hell, he\u2019d seen the Harley in the garage; he just hadn\u2019t thought. His dad never brought women home. It was just something that never, ever happened. Especially in the middle of the day.</p><p>Sheriff Zeke Mayes didn\u2019t do \u201cnooners.\u201d Shane almost laughed out loud. Hell, he didn\u2019t know if he should be mortified or laughing. Because he\u2019d wondered if his dad was some kind of fucking monk or something. At least now he knew that one wasn\u2019t happening.</p><p>But hell, walking in on him? Him and Rogue Walker?</p><p>Shit. He\u2019d had enough fantasies about Rogue himself; he didn\u2019t need to see his dad doing her.</p><p>His dad was going to kill him. It was that simple. Shane had seen his face. His dad was freaking going to kill him. He flinched at the sound of the door opening behind him and closing softly. He paused, took a deep breath, then turned around.</p><p>Yeah, Dad was going to kill him. He was scowling at him, arms crossed over his re-buttoned uniform shirt, his expression forbidding. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLook, I didn\u2019t think.\u201d Shane cleared his throat and tried the honesty route. \u201cIt just didn\u2019t occur to me, you know?\u201d</p><p>His dad was damned freaky about his privacy anyway. He was one of the most secretive people Shane knew, especially about his private life.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s your car?\u201d his dad asked carefully.</p> <p>Shane winced. \u201cAt the garage. I had a friend drop me off earlier. It was rattling. You know it had that rattle, Dad. I came home to get it fixed. And there are no classes tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>He could feel the flush on his face and rubbed at the back of his neck nervously. He wanted to cuss again, but knew better with his dad scowling at him like that.</p><p>\u201cSorry, Dad,\u201d he finally muttered.</p><p>His father drew in a harsh breath before dropping his arms and stalking to the porch railing. They both listened to the sound of a Harley starting. The low throb of power, then Shane winced as it roared. Oh hell, Rogue was pissed off.</p><p>He glanced at his dad and watched his shoulders tighten, the way his jaw bunched as the cycle\u2019s motor ripped through the silence of the valley on its journey to the main road.</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s pissed at me, too?\u201d He sighed.</p><p>Zeke shook his head. \u201cShe\u2019s not pissed at you.\u201d</p><p>She was hurt. He\u2019d seen that flash of pain in her eyes and hadn\u2019t known how to deal with it. Hell, it wasn\u2019t every day a man\u2019s son walked in while he was getting blown.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t see anything. Much,\u201d Shane ventured hesitantly. \u201cI turned my head. Fast.\u201d</p><p>Zeke glanced over at him. \u201cYou saw enough.\u201d</p><p>Shane cleared his throat before turning and gripping the railing. He stared out at the lake, his youthful expression still a combination of amazement and shock.</p> <p>\u201cYeah. Enough.\u201d</p><p>Shane rocked against the railing and this time, Zeke didn\u2019t chastise him for it.</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t happen again,\u201d Shane ventured. \u201cI mean, I moved out. I should, like, knock first or something. Not just barrel in when I know you have company.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be a start,\u201d Zeke said heavily. Though he doubted there would be more</p><p>\u201ccompany.\u201d Hell, he\u2019d be lucky if Rogue didn\u2019t kick his ass the next time she saw him.</p><p>And he\u2019d deserve it.</p><p>He should have said something. He should have promised to call later. Something. Hell, he\u2019d just shot his cum down her throat and threw her out. He could feel himself cringing inside.</p><p>\u201cSorry, Dad,\u201d Shane apologized again, but Zeke could hear the amusement in the boy\u2019s voice. He didn\u2019t blame him for being amused.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll kick your ass if you ever bring a girl here and let me catch you,\u201d he warned Shane, just in case. Sometimes, with a boy that thought he was a man, it was best to lay the ground rules out front and center.</p><p>\u201cUh, yeah. Wouldn\u2019t blame you.\u201d Shane sounded as horrified as Zeke felt.</p><p>Shit. This was his son. There were things a man should never let his son, no matter how old he is, know about, let alone catch a glimpse of. And Rogue. She was gossiped about enough, she didn\u2019t need her name tarnished further.</p><p>\u201cAnd this won\u2019t be mentioned,\u201d he warned Shane. \u201cEspecially to your aunt Lucinda.\u201d</p><p>Horror shaped Shane\u2019s face. \u201cOh my God, you think I\u2019d tell Aunt Big Mouth?\u201d he gasped. \u201cCome on, Dad. I like Rogue. She\u2019s cool. Too good for you, but she\u2019s cool.\u201d</p><p>Zeke\u2019s brows arched as Shane flushed again.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t mean it the way it sounded,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cThen how did you mean it?\u201d Zeke asked him carefully.</p><p>He mumbled.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Shane,\u201d he ordered. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to run your mouth, be a man and stand by it.\u201d</p><p>He had never let Shane shirk his responsibilities or his punishments. If he could run his mouth, then he could back it up.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to insult you.\u201d Shane finally shrugged. \u201cWell, kinda, I did.\u201d</p><p>Zeke stared back at the boy silently as he turned and faced him. Shane\u2019s eyes met his as his brows lowered into a fierce frown. He looked like an adult when he did that. Zeke didn\u2019t like admitting Shane was becoming an adult.</p><p>\u201cLook, I know Rogue\u2019s half crazy over you,\u201d Shane said then. \u201cEven when I was in school and you came for those stupid parent-teacher conferences that year, I could see it. She likes you. Maybe too much. And you\u2019re all about no ties. She deserves better than that.\u201d</p><p>Zeke crossed his arms over his chest and faced his son then. He\u2019d be damned if he was going to let his son stand and chastise him over something he didn\u2019t know or couldn\u2019t understand.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not your call, Shane,\u201d he pointed out firmly. \u201cWhat\u2019s between me and Rogue stays there. Understand? I don\u2019t need your advice.\u201d</p><p>Shane looked away for a moment, and Zeke was struck by the maturity his son had achieved in the past year at college. Hell, he\u2019d missed it. Shane\u2019s face had lost that youthful fullness. It was becoming more honed, closer to Zeke in looks rather than his mother\u2019s father.</p><p>Hell, it was a defining moment, Zeke thought, realizing his kid looked like him. And that his kid was berating him over a woman. There was something about that that just clashed in his head.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not trying to give you advice.\u201d Shane turned back to him, eyeing him fiercely now with eyes almost the same color as his own. \u201cI\u2019m telling you, Dad. You break her heart, and you won\u2019t be the man I\u2019ve always respected.\u201d</p><p>It was all Zeke could do to keep his jaw in place. Hell. When had reality shifted?</p><p>In his kitchen with his dick down Rogue\u2019s throat, another part of him reminded him.</p><p>\u201cSon, you\u2019re getting big enough to hit,\u201d Zeke warned him, though he knew hitting the boy wasn\u2019t in question.</p><p>Shane snorted at that. \u201cYeah, sure, Pop. And you\u2019re old enough to know better than to mess with a girl like Rogue without being serious about it. You\u2019re older than she is. And you know things she doesn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThings like what?\u201d Zeke gritted out in a snarl. Maybe he should rethink the hitting part.</p><p>Shane flushed, then straightened his shoulders and glared back at him. \u201cI\u2019m your son,\u201d</p><p>he snapped. \u201cDon\u2019t make me spell crap out. It was bad enough walking in on you like that. I\u2019m a man, not a kid, and I know I\u2019m not always normal in some things. I figure I got it from someone and I\u2019m figuring after hearing tales about Grandpa, that I get it from your side. Okay? So be careful. I like Rogue. She\u2019s cool, and she doesn\u2019t treat me like a stupid kid. You break her heart and I\u2019m gonna be pissed. That\u2019s just all.\u201d</p><p>With that, Shane turned on his booted heel and slammed back into the house, rattling the door on its hinges as Zeke stared at it in shock.</p><p>Fuck, he needed a beer. He needed a beer, a long nap, and then he needed to get his head screwed on straight where Rogue was concerned. She was pissed. Shane was pissed. And Zeke couldn\u2019t blame either damned one of them. The question now was damage control.</p><p>He rubbed the back of his neck as he grimaced. When he\u2019d been married and pissed his wife off, all he had to do was leave her alone for a while and she forgave him. When Chaya was pissed at Natches, he said the best thing to do was leave her the hell alone.</p><p>He\u2019d seen various Mackay men moping at the diner when their wives were in a snit.</p><p>Rogue couldn\u2019t be much different, could she?</p><p>Hell, it was humiliating to realize how little he knew about this female\u2019s quirks. He was thirty-seven years old, he\u2019d been married, and he hadn\u2019t exactly been celibate over the years since his wife had died.</p><p>But, he reminded himself, neither had he actually had relationships. Not that he had one now. Did he? He shook his head. Hell no, he didn\u2019t have one now. Rogue wasn\u2019t a relationship. But she was definitely going to be a lover. He\u2019d give her a few days, let her get over her mad, then he\u2019d find her.</p><p>He nodded to himself. That was all he had to do. Because the next time he found her, he was fucking her. It was that simple. He\u2019d come down her throat today with a force he hadn\u2019t known in his entire life. Watching her, seeing her innocence, realizing how she was struggling with the act and trying to hide the fact that she had no idea what she was doing. And still, she\u2019d gone down on him with a sensuality and a hunger that amazed him.</p><p>And when he\u2019d filled her mouth, she\u2019d come with him. Not the way she was going to come once he got his lips between her thighs or his cock buried deep inside that hot little pussy he knew would drive him insane. But she had come from the sheer sensuality and excitement, with him. He wasn\u2019t about to fight this much longer.</p><p>He\u2019d managed to hide the darker core of his sexuality for most of his life; it was second nature now. He\u2019d hide it with Rogue as well. He\u2019d have to, because he knew he had to have her. There was no other option.</p><p>He would hide it from Shane, he\u2019d hide it from the county. He knew how to hide his lovers and he knew how to hide his interest.</p><p>If something warned him it wasn\u2019t going to be that easy with Rogue, then he pushed it aside. Rogue was hotter, more of a temptation, more of a forbidden fruit because of her age, he told himself. It wasn\u2019t emotion. Zeke had learned long ago not to let himself get emotionally involved. He wasn\u2019t involved now.</p><p>Was he?</p><p>He wasn\u2019t, he decided. Cranston\u2019s idea had merit, too. He could have Rogue, he could let the killer think his focus was divided while Cranston and the Mackays asked their questions. Hell, they were going to do it anyway.</p><p>And he wouldn\u2019t be using her, he assured his guilty conscience. He was dying for her.</p><p>His attention was divided, it was too focused on his hunger, and he\u2019d end up missing things. This way, he\u2019d at least have a clear head for the investigation.</p><p>And he was making excuses. The plain and simple fact was he simply couldn\u2019t stay away from her any longer.</p><p>Rogue showed up at work the next day even though she didn\u2019t want to. She felt raw inside, rejected, used. She felt as though she had been stripped to the bone and had no idea how to heal the wounds; she only knew how to hide them.</p><p>She pasted on a smile after a careful application of makeup. Smoky eyes were sensual, and they hid the shadows of emotional catastrophe. Bronzed lipstick made her look seductive.</p><p>She wore chocolate ankle-strapped stilettos and a matching slip dress that just barely hid the band of her bronzed stockings. She spent hours straightening her long curls until the mass of red gold strands hung to her hips like a shimmering ribbon. Parted on the side, it framed her face with rakish appeal and gave her a slight ego boost if nothing else.</p><p>She didn\u2019t ride the Harley into work but had Jonesy drive her in with a promise to pick her up later that night. He was silent, moody, and obviously not exactly happy with her style of dress.</p><p>He approved of the leather, no matter how skimpy she got with it. He thought it was tasteful. To Jonesy, silk was a trick and her straight hair was a come-on. Go figure.</p><p>She stepped into a full restaurant, took over for Tabitha, and kept a smile on her face.</p><p>She fielded advances, she laughed at the flirtatious comments, but something inside her felt as though it was breaking.</p><p>Okay, so it was pretty bad having your son walk in while you were getting a blow job.</p><p>She could only imagine how horrifying that was. It was bad enough getting caught, period. He was shocked, needed to yell at Shane a little maybe. She excused that. She was pissed, hurt, but she understood.</p><p>She understood all night. She watched the hands of the clock tick by and felt the knowledge that she didn\u2019t matter enough to seek out growing heavier inside her.</p><p>The dinner crowd moved through, in and out, until the doors were locked and she gave one last peek as she turned the sign to Closed and realized he wasn\u2019t going to show up. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Showing up would mean others would see him. It would be an acknowledgment that she was more than just a casual little fuck, she admitted.</p><p>But how could she have expected anything less?</p><p>Ignoring Janey and Alex\u2019s concerned looks, she strode through the restaurant back to the office and started putting receipts together to begin the paperwork for the night.</p> <p>She often finished up in the office while Alex and Janey went on home. She called Jonesy and told him she would be late. She\u2019d get a cab. He wasn\u2019t happy, again. It seemed Rogue had lost the ability to please anyone who mattered to her that day, she thought with a scowl.</p><p>Damn men. When had she started caring what any man felt?</p><p>The day she\u2019d met Zeke Mayes, she admitted to herself. God, she was such a fool for him. It was insane, completely pathetic actually.</p><p>She looked up as the door to the office opened and Janey and Alex stepped inside. She knew that look on her friends\u2019 face, and she knew that evidently she hadn\u2019t hidden her emotions as effectively as she had hoped. Great, now Janey would have questions. And what Janey knew, Alex would know. What Alex knew, he would probably say something to Zeke about. And well, didn\u2019t she just know how private Zeke was?</p><p>\u201cEverything okay, Rogue?\u201d Janey asked casually as Alex closed the door behind them.</p> <p>\u201cActually, no.\u201d Rogue pushed the receipts back as Janey looked at her in surprise.</p><p>\u201cSheriff Mayes has no idea who killed Joe and Jaime. Grandma Walker hasn\u2019t stopped crying, and Lisa won\u2019t let me help.\u201d She rubbed at her temples. Those were concerns, and they were heartbreaking, but that wasn\u2019t what was digging gouges out of her soul.</p><p>\u201cForensics hasn\u2019t come back yet, Rogue,\u201d Alex stated. \u201cI\u2019ve been checking on it, and the coroners haven\u2019t finished their tests on the bodies yet. We should know something conclusive soon.\u201d</p><p>Rogue shook her head. \u201cGrandma won\u2019t be with us much longer.\u201d Her lower lip trembled despite her battle to keep her emotions in check. Acknowledging that was a bitch. She would have to bury the boys with no one to comfort her, and she knew that soon she would be burying their grandmother the same way.</p><p>How had she let this happen? How could she let herself care for a man she couldn\u2019t even lean on in her grief?</p><p>\u201cIs there anything we can do to help?\u201d Janey moved to the front of the desk and sat down gingerly in one of the chairs.</p> <p>Her forest green eyes were somber and filled with compassion, but there was an edge of suspicion in them as well. She knew when Rogue was hiding things, when she wasn\u2019t talking. That was the risk you took when you let someone become your best friend.</p><p>\u201cYes, there is,\u201d she said softly. \u201cDon\u2019t ask questions.\u201d</p><p>It was the closest she could come to admitting anything.</p><p>Alex snorted as Janey\u2019s lips compressed. \u201cThat\u2019s not fair, Rogue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s very fair,\u201d she told her friend. \u201cI have to deal with family right now, Janey; I don\u2019t have the strength to deal with more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you telling the wrong person that?\u201d Janey asked her.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Rogue shook her head, her voice roughening. \u201cI\u2019m telling the one person that should understand I need time right now. And I need a chance to figure things out on my own.\u201d</p><p>Janey stared back at her for long, silent moments.</p> <p>\u201cYou know we\u2019re here,\u201d she offered. \u201cFor family things or anything else.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t risk it.</p><p>\u201cRogue?\u201d Alex spoke then. \u201cI can leave the room. Anything you tell Janey would go no further, you know that.\u201d</p><p>No, she didn\u2019t know that. She knew men. She knew they talked and gossiped worse than women. And she knew Janey. Before she knew it, the entire Mackay clan would be privy to Zeke\u2019s secrets, and that whole privacy rule he had would be shot to hell and back. Hell, she felt sorry for his former lover now.</p><p>\u201cNot a problem, Alex.\u201d She smiled tightly. \u201cI just want to get these receipts finished and head home to bed. It\u2019s been a damned long day and it doesn\u2019t look as though things are going to get any better for a while.\u201d</p><p>They were likely to get worse. It was normally not a good thing to threaten or attempt to commit bodily harm on an officer of the law, and she knew one she wanted to shoot with his own gun.</p><p>Janey sighed. \u201cYou\u2019re sure there\u2019s nothing we can do?\u201d</p><p>Rogue looked down at the receipts, then back up to her friend. \u201cI need a few days off actually. The bar is going to hell right now and I need to straighten a few things up.\u201d</p><p>The bar was the one place she knew Zeke wouldn\u2019t enter. He may have that first night to question her, but he wouldn\u2019t do it again. Too public, and of course, no one could know he was trying to fuck the little bar whore.</p><p>Fucking Nadine Grace and Dayle Mackay. God, she had never hated them as much as she hated them now.</p><p>\u201cHow many days?\u201d Janey asked carefully, causing Rogue to smile.</p><p>\u201cI need at least four days, maybe five,\u201d she told her. Long enough to get the need eating her alive out of her system. Long enough that when she returned she wouldn\u2019t be watching for him, waiting for him. Long enough to find her balance again and get her heart straightened out. Long enough to avoid prison because of her homicidal tendencies toward one man.</p><p>\u201cFive days.\u201d Janey nodded. \u201cBut you promise you\u2019ll be back after that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be back after that,\u201d Rogue promised. \u201cI just need to get things squared away. That\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>She could feel Alex\u2019s stare, it was like a laser that cut straight through the lies she was telling.</p><p>\u201cFine. Five days.\u201d Janey sighed as she stood up. \u201cYou can leave tonight\u2019s receipts. I\u2019ll harass Natches and make him get them in the morning. He can work for his share of the profit for the next few days. But don\u2019t think I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on, Rogue.\u201d</p><p>Rogue\u2019s head jerked up to stare back at her. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>Janey leaned forward. \u201cThe plague. A plague known as redneck male stupidity. Want to know the cure?\u201d</p><p>Uh-oh, Janey\u2019s smile was all teeth. It was a Mackay smile and never boded well.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a cure?\u201d she asked warily. She was intrigued now.</p><p>Janey\u2019s smiled widened.</p><p>\u201cJaney,\u201d Alex said warningly, which only made Rogue more curious.</p><p>Her brow arched as she stared back at her friend. \u201cA girl can never have enough cures for redneck male stupidity. Just in case she runs across it.\u201d</p><p>Janey leaned closer. \u201cWhen you get your hands on him, Rogue, and you will get your hands on him, remember one thing. He\u2019s rumored to have stamina, but you have something that can bring him to his knees.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo tell.\u201d Rogue replied mockingly. Oh yeah, she definitely wanted to hear this one.</p><p>\u201cThe word \u2018no.\u2019 \u201d Janey pulled back, her expression tightening in anger. \u201cTell him to go to hell and walk away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike you did?\u201d Rogue arched her brow, remembering well just how effective that had been with Alex.</p><p>Janey pouted. \u201cThat was Alex. He\u2019s different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d Rogue nodded. \u201cDo tell how different, Janey.\u201d Her gaze flickered to Alex. He was looking less than comfortable with the direction of this conversation.</p><p>\u201cYes, sweetheart,\u201d he drawled then, his voice silky, curious and warning at the same time. \u201cDo tell us the difference.\u201d</p><p>Janey\u2019s smile was satisfied, sensual, alluring as she gazed at her lover before turning back to Rogue. \u201cHis condom broke the first time.\u201d She laughed, ducking as Alex reached for her with a laugh. \u201cI had to have mercy on him. You know, just in case I had to make an honest man of him.\u201d</p><p>Janey\u2019s laughter was filled with happiness as it echoed around the office. Her lover caught her in his arms, lifted her against him, and gave her a kiss that was filled with his smile.</p><p>\u201cAnd on that note.\u201d He turned to Rogue. \u201cWe\u2019ll give you a ride to the bar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not necessary,\u201d Rogue began.</p><p>\u201cWell, you could ride with us or with him.\u201d</p><p>With him? Rogue started back at him with a rising sense of dread.</p><p>\u201cMeaning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a certain sheriff\u2019s Tahoe parked out front, most likely ready to turn away any cabs. My truck is out back.\u201d Alex\u2019s smile was tight. \u201cWe could sneak you right out.\u201d</p><p>Rogue swallowed tightly. She couldn\u2019t face Zeke, not tonight, not yet. If he was waiting outside for her, then she knew exactly what would happen before they managed to get out of the parking lot.</p><p>She picked up her purse casually, each move deliberate.</p><p>\u201cI appreciate the offer of a ride, Alex,\u201d she said as she stood to her feet. \u201cI think I\u2019ll take you up on it after all. It\u2019s rather cold to wait outside for a cab in this weather.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He nodded. \u201cI thought you\u2019d see it that way.\u201d</p><p>Zeke was fucking up.</p><p>Alex led Janey and a rather silent Rogue to his truck, helped them in, then moved around to the driver\u2019s side with a quick look to the side of the street. The sheriff had gotten sneaky over the past weeks as he watched for Rogue to leave. Tonight, he wasn\u2019t being sneaky at all, and that was telling.</p><p>He grinned as he started the motor and pulled out of the back lot, easing slowly down the street, just to make sure that they were seen. He had no doubt Zeke was watching, and he didn\u2019t mind tormenting his friend a little here and there. Hell, sometimes, a man had to be pushed to follow his heart, and Alex didn\u2019t mind pushing Zeke any more than Zeke had minded pushing him when it came to Janey.</p><p>As they drove past the front parking lot, he timed his good friend, holding back a smile and counting off the seconds until his cell phone rang. He let it ring a time or two before taking it from the clip on his belt and answering with a brief, \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRogue\u2019s with you?\u201d Zeke didn\u2019t sound pleased, and Alex considered that encouraging.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he answered shortly.</p><p>There was a brief silence. \u201cYou\u2019re taking her back to her apartment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>It was all Alex could do to keep from laughing. He could hear the sheer frustration in the other man\u2019s voice, and he sympathized, he really did.</p><p>\u201cIt just seemed like the neighborly thing to do,\u201d Alex answered. \u201cIs there a problem with it?\u201d</p><p>That silence again. He could almost feel Zeke glaring at his back. And he probably was, considering the sheriff\u2019s Tahoe had pulled out behind him after he passed the parking lot.</p><p>\u201cNo problem,\u201d Zeke finally answered. \u201cTell her I\u2019ll talk to her soon.\u201d And the line disconnected.</p><p>Alex\u2019s brows arched. Give her a message? Now wasn\u2019t that uncharacteristic of their private sheriff?</p><p>He closed the phone and glanced to the backseat where Rogue sat silently, watching him.</p><p>\u201cZeke said to tell you he\u2019ll talk to you later,\u201d he told her. \u201cYou two been talking a lot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr something,\u201d she muttered, turning to stare out the window and keeping her lips pressed together firmly.</p><p>Alex grinned, looked at Janey, and wagged his brows. This was very interesting. Zeke had never been known to chase after any woman.</p><p>\u201cWonder why he didn\u2019t call your cell phone?\u201d he mused after a few minutes. \u201cSeems odd he\u2019d call me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMine might be turned off,\u201d she answered.</p><p>He almost had to bite his lip to keep from laughing. As though that was going to keep Zeke off her ass. She just had no idea. Once a man like Zeke decided what he wanted, nothing would hold him back. And Alex had a feeling Zeke knew exactly what he wanted.</p><p>\u201cWhy is he following us?\u201d Janey asked then, her voice smooth, and so genuinely curious as she glanced behind them. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMaybe I have a taillight out,\u201d Alex suggested. \u201cShould I pull over?\u201d</p><p>He laughed as Janey pinched his thigh. In the rearview mirror he caught Rogue\u2019s glare.</p><p>Whatever was going on, he was sure he\u2019d hear about it soon. Until then, he\u2019d drop his passenger off and head home to be with his own woman. Zeke would learn what Alex already knew. There was nothing as satisfying as holding your own woman in the still of the night and greeting the next day with her. He had confidence in the sheriff\u2019s abilities to figure that out. And if he didn\u2019t, well, Alex just might have to help him along a little.</p> <p>NINE</p><p>Spring was in full flush in the mountains, the trees weregreening out, the evenings were mildly cool, the days pleasant, and the Bar, better known as the biker haven in the Lake Cumberland area, was hopping.</p><p>For a Thursday, it was packed. The winter country tunes were replaced by harder, driving music. Leather and denim rubbed shoulder to shoulder, thigh to thigh, and cycles filled the parking lot along with a heavy share of pickups and SUVs.</p><p>Dressed in her customary black leather pants and sleeveless vest, a lacy violet camisole peeking over the top, Rogue surveyed the crowd. Four- inch stiletto-heeled boots gave her barely enough height that if she strained, she could almost see over the writhing mass.</p><p>Mainstream hard rock and metal was pounding through the PA system, drinks were flowing, bouncers were alert, and Rogue was in her element. She loved the pulse and pound of the music, the laughter, and sometimes, she even enjoyed the fights.</p> <p>It had been two nights since she had last seen Zeke, and she had used the time to regroup and reassess the damage she had allowed in her life.</p><p>Rogue had remade herself after the debacle four years before. She hadn\u2019t let that night destroy her, she hadn\u2019t let it beat her. She was bitter at times, but only because she had once believed that Nadine and Dayle had taken away her chance with the man who fascinated her. She no longer believed that was the truth. There had never been a chance, because Rogue knew, even then, the \u201cgood girl\u201d image wouldn\u2019t have changed anything. And in time, she would have matured and stepped out of that more submissive role anyway.</p><p>She had moped the past two days. She had pouted. She had even shed a tear or two and watched outside her apartment window as Zeke drove through the parking lot each night before he went off duty. And she had had a spark of realization.</p><p>Rogue didn\u2019t hide. She wouldn\u2019t be a closet lover, she wasn\u2019t going to be one of the women Zeke kept hanging on a string, always worrying, always wondering when or if it would be over on any given night. She wasn\u2019t a submissive little lapdog content to wait on the pillows for his attention.</p><p>That was her realization. It didn\u2019t change the fact that she still dreamed about him, and it didn\u2019t change the fact that she still woke wet and wild, reaching for him. But there were other things in life to occupy her.</p><p>For the moment, Grandma Walker, Lisa, and Lisa\u2019s twin boys were a concern. She had friends, she had family. She had, over the years, become content with her life.</p> <p>\u201cHey, Rogue,\u201d Jonesy called from behind the bar as she moved through the crowd in front of it. \u201cGet your luscious ass back here and help me.\u201d</p><p>Jonesy and his assistant \u2019tender, as he called her, were working frantically to fill orders as customers lined up around the wide bar.</p><p>Rogue worked her way to the entrance behind the bar, moving quickly to take orders and fill them. Thursday night wasn\u2019t usually this heavy, but the unseasonably warm days and evenings had spring fever in the air. Bikers mingled with farmers and tourists, fishermen and hikers. The Lake Cumberland area had something to tease the imagination and interests of a wide variety of people.</p><p>\u201cHey, beautiful. I wondered where you\u2019d been.\u201d Hank Gentry was from Virginia. He and his small group of friends made the trip several times a year from their homes to the lake where they rented one of the available houseboats.</p><p>Hank was handsome as hell. Very accountant neat, and biker wild. He liked to say he pretended he was revisiting his twenties when he made his trips.</p><p>\u201cHank, you\u2019re early this year.\u201d She laughed as she pushed a mug of draft beer his way and turned to pour more for the friends standing behind him. \u201cI see you have your misfits with you,\u201d she yelled over her shoulder.</p><p>The other four men laughed, obviously pleased that they were being called misfits at forty-something.</p><p>\u201cYou saving me a dance?\u201d Hank\u2019s wide grin met her as she turned back, handed over the beers, and took the cash.</p> <p>\u201cMy dance card is full, sugar.\u201d She cast him a wide grin. \u201cJonesy keeps me leashed to the bar or serving drinks.\u201d</p><p>Jonesy glowered at her. He\u2019d been doing that for two days now. His temper was getting testy, and she was getting ready to take a bite out of his butt for it.</p><p>\u201cWhen she ain\u2019t consorting with undesirables, you can almost get a good night\u2019s work out of her,\u201d Jonesy snarled, and it wasn\u2019t playful.</p><p>Hank\u2019s green eyes turned back to her in surprise, his brows raised. \u201cShame on you, Rogue.\u201d He wagged his finger at her chidingly. \u201cConsorting with undesirables.\u201d He shook his head before glancing around the bar. \u201cYou surprise me.\u201d He winked, took his beer, and moved off.</p><p>\u201cCut it out, Jonesy,\u201d she snapped as she turned to pour another beer. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to fight with me here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got fight left in you then?\u201d he grunted. \u201cNow that one surprises me. I thought you\u2019d done tucked your tail and turned vanilla on me.\u201d</p><p>God, there were days she hated men; their PMS was worse than a woman\u2019s any day, and less understandable.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to turn homicidal if you don\u2019t get off my back,\u201d she ordered him. \u201cWait till closing and take up your problems with me then.\u201d</p><p>She turned away before he could snap back in reply. She\u2019d had just about enough of snarly, snapping males that thought they could order her around or steer her damned life. She\u2019d been steering it fine on her own for over five years now.</p><p>\u201cRonnie\u2019s having problems with a couple in B area,\u201d he called out as she pushed a handful of beers across the bar. \u201cWe got a regular and a tourist having a bit of a problem over a woman.\u201d</p><p>Jonesy wore a headset radio atop his head that connected him to the other bouncers.</p><p>\u201cGet out there with him,\u201d Rogue warned him. \u201cLea and I can handle the bar for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKent\u2019s on his way,\u201d Jonesy informed her as he collected a heavy bat from beneath the bar and exited the bar area on the other side quickly.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s been dying to use that bat all week,\u201d Lea called out as she worked furiously to mix several drinks and slide them across the bar.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a man. Playing with his bat is the only thing he understands.\u201d Rogue laughed back at her, causing Lea to nearly drop a bottle of whisky in her mirth and most of the men around the bar to hoot and yell in agreement.</p><p>She toasted the men with a hastily poured shot, tossed it back, and slapped the glass on the bar with a grin at the eager cheers before going back to work.</p><p>She was having fun. She liked to have fun. She had always imagined any lover she had she would be able to tease and flirt with, to laugh and share her enjoyment of the atmosphere she had built here. She wasn\u2019t going to be ashamed of it. She wasn\u2019t going to change who and what she was, and she wouldn\u2019t ask Zeke to change his rules, either.</p><p>That left things rather at a stalemate. The night wasn\u2019t at a stalemate though. She worked the bar before making her rounds through the building again. She watched the waitresses and waiters, made certain everything was running smoothly in between brief hip-shaking dances and laughter. If Zeke were here, she wondered, what would he see?</p><p>The bar whore she was rumored to be, or the woman she truly was? She refused to question herself as to why it should matter either way. She was who she was. She couldn\u2019t be anything less, anything more.</p><p>As the night deepened, her frustration with Jonesy only mounted though. He was scowling more often, and each time he spoke to her, he snapped. It was wearing on her nerves, and she knew better than to allow it to continue. He had his moods, and if she put up with them, they would only escalate until he ended up in a fight with someone else. The only way to end it was to confront it, before she ended up with bar damage.</p><p>Motioning to Lea and Kent to take over the bar, she moved to Jonesy. \u201cMy office,\u201d she ordered.</p><p>\u201cMy ass,\u201d he growled, his brown gaze glittering in anger. \u201cI have work to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot after tonight you won\u2019t,\u201d she snapped. \u201cMy office now, or get your ass out of my bar. And you damned well better remember who owns the place.\u201d</p><p>She turned on her heel and stalked out of the area toward the back door marked Private.</p><p>Pushing through, she moved through the short hall, made a sharp turn, and quickly unlocked the door to her office.</p><p>She threw it open before Jonesy could barrel into it. He stalked into the room, jerked his white apron off, and wadded it into a ball before throwing it to the floor.</p><p>His white T-shirt stretched over the bulging muscles of his tattooed arms. The ham-sized biceps flexed menacingly as he glared back at her.</p><p>\u201cDrop the attitude.\u201d There was no fear of Jonesy. He was temperamental, tried to be a bully, and fussed like a mother hen gone rabid, but she had never seen him as dangerous.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me to drop the attitude, little girl,\u201d he snarled, face flushing as his heavy brows lowered over his dark eyes. \u201cI\u2019m the dumb bastard watching you mope around with those big, pathetic eyes of yours as you watch the door and pray that no-account sheriff makes his way back to mark you. Where the fuck is your head, letting that bastard touch you?\u201d</p><p>Rogue drew back in surprise. Evidently Jonesy had seen the reddened mark beneath her jaw as well.</p><p>\u201cThe mark or the man is none of your damned business, Jonesy,\u201d she said, voice tight.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my damned business when I have to listen to the gossip and field the questions,\u201d</p><p>he yelled back, his lips pulling back from his teeth furiously.</p><p>\u201cLike I\u2019ve ever given a damn about gossip,\u201d she retorted. \u201cAnd since when do you give a damn? Hell, Jonesy, they talk about everyone and everything. It\u2019s a fact of fucking life and I couldn\u2019t give a damn one way or the other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe that\u2019s your problem!\u201d he said, his voice rising further. \u201cYou simply don\u2019t give a damn. You didn\u2019t give a damn when they made you look like a tramp in those pictures, and now you don\u2019t give a damn and spread your fucking legs for that whoremongering sheriff who doesn\u2019t have a chance of being good enough for you.\u201d</p><p>She was going to pull her hair out. Staring back at him incredulously, she fought to figure out what the hell kind of bug had gotten up his ass to make him act this way or to say something so vile.</p><p>\u201cZeke is not a whoremonger,\u201d she bit out between clenched teeth.</p><p>\u201cYeah, you\u2019ll take up for him, but you don\u2019t give a shit when I call you a tramp,\u201d he accused roughly, his eyes narrowing as his entire body seemed to quiver with outrage.</p><p>\u201cYour daddy raised you better than this, girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy daddy raised me to have enough confidence in myself to do whatever the hell I want with whoever the hell I want,\u201d she yelled back, nearly shaking in her own anger now. \u201cHow dare you think you can take me to task for anything, Jonesy? You don\u2019t have that right, and I\u2019ll be damned if I\u2019ll let you pretend you do.\u201d</p><p>He was six feet tall to her five feet seven in her highest heels. She was in his face, snarling back at him, overwhelmed by her anger. She hated being told what to do or being taken to task for decisions she made. She was an adult. She knew what the hell she was doing even when she wasn\u2019t certain of the way to get there, and she knew she was damned sick and tired of others trying to tell her she was too young, too inexperienced, or evidently raised to do things differently than she was. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jonesy was still glaring down at her. His breathing was rough, face flushed. At his side, his beefy hands were curled into fists as though it was all he could do to keep from hitting her.</p><p>She knew him. She knew his rages, and she knew his affection, but she didn\u2019t understand his sudden animosity toward Zeke.</p><p>\u201cYou used to understand how the world works around here, Rogue,\u201d he spat out.</p> <p>\u201cWhat the hell happened to you?\u201d</p><p>The way the world worked around here. Here being Pulaski County, as though it was a separate part of the rest of the world.</p><p>\u201cOh, don\u2019t worry, Jonesy, I understand the rules very well, and I intend to break every one I can,\u201d she informed him with a tight smile.</p><p>Jonesy and his damned rules. Stay with your own kind, he\u2019d always warned her. White trash to white trash, upper-class trash to upper-class trash, and she was somewhere in between and yet somewhere above them all. She could return to Boston and take her place as a society princess there, or she could stick to her own kind here. That being the hard-drinking, motorcycle-riding men and women that made the Bar their home away from home. To Jonesy, she shouldn\u2019t look any further for entertainment or for a relationship.</p><p>\u201cThis ain\u2019t about breaking the rules, you little twit,\u201d he bit out in disgust.</p> <p>Her eyes narrowed as she began to shake in fury. \u201cDon\u2019t call me a twit, Jonesy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen don\u2019t act like one,\u201d he sneered. \u201cI\u2019ve just about had enough of it. That sheriff ain\u2019t gonna do nothin\u2019 but use you up, just like he does his other women. You\u2019re nothing but another notch in his bedpost, and you\u2019ll be a small one at that.\u201d</p><p>Rogue didn\u2019t flinch at the accusation, but it hurt. Damn, that one had been below the belt, and she felt vibrations of the pain racing through her. A part of her feared he was right; another part of her was determined to take what she wanted no matter the cost.</p><p>\u201cWhere I get notched is none of your business though, is it?\u201d she asked him. \u201cYour job is to run that bar out there, not my life. If you can\u2019t keep a civil tongue in your head otherwise, then you can get the hell out.\u201d</p><p>His eyes widened, darkened as anger flushed his face deeper and creased his rough face.</p><p>\u201cGet the hell out? I\u2019ve been here since before your ass was born,\u201d he yelled, stepping closer. \u201cYou don\u2019t tell me to get out, little girl.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m telling you if you don\u2019t learn how to keep your insults and your sneers to yourself, then replacing you will be my first priority after I have my bouncers throw your ass to the curb.\u201d</p><p>Surprise flickered over his face. \u201cI hired those bouncers. Those are my men.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI sign their paychecks. They\u2019ll do as I say or they\u2019ll find themselves on the curb with you,\u201d she yelled back.</p><p>She had always trusted Jonesy; she had never known a moment\u2019s fear of him, until that second. Those big hands reached out for her, his fingers curving harshly around her upper arms before he shook her like a rag doll.</p><p>\u201cThe hell you will.\u201d He pushed her back just as suddenly.</p><p>Rogue felt her hip hit the corner of the desk, her hair flying around her as she fought to steady herself and retreat far enough that he couldn\u2019t grab her again.</p><p>She stared at him in shock and in hurt. Jonesy, for all their fights, had never laid a hand on her, had never become threatening.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s out of line, Jonesy. You don\u2019t want to touch me again.\u201d His lips twisted furiously as he paused, his gaze narrowing on her. \u201cSomeone needs to show you your damned place. You\u2019ve become a disgrace to your daddy, and I\u2019ll be damned if I\u2019ll put up with it much longer.\u201d</p> <p>He started for her again. Rogue felt her heart racing, a tingle of fear tearing through her as she glimpsed the pure rage that seemed to transform his face. She moved to jump back, only to find herself frozen as Jonesy suddenly swung away from her, his heavy body crashing into the wall from the fist that had been planted in his jaw.</p><p>Zeke stood before her, dressed in jeans, a black shirt, and boots, his expression icy, his hawklike gaze burning in fury.</p><p>\u201cGet the hell out!\u201d Zeke\u2019s voice rang with authority and with pure unbridled power.</p><p>\u201cNow.\u201d</p><p>Shit. This wasn\u2019t good. How the hell had she managed to let her argument with Jonesy develop into this? If these two men fought, then there would end up being bloodshed.</p><p>\u201cJonesy, get your ass back to the bar,\u201d she snapped as Jonesy came slowly to his feet.</p><p>Zeke\u2019s gaze swung around to her. There was no shock, no surprise on his face, there was no fury. His expression was emotionless, but his eyes burned.</p><p>\u201cDid he sneak into the back?\u201d Jonesy sneered. \u201cI bet you this bar he did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have this bar to bet with,\u201d she told him, her heart was in her throat now as she fought to get him out of the office. \u201cNow get back to work. And don\u2019t worry about coming back after tonight until you can get your stupidity under control.\u201d</p><p>He flashed her a glare filled with animosity. \u201cMy stupidity is the least of your worries.\u201d</p><p>It sounded like a warning. \u201cBut, hell yeah, I\u2019ll get out of your office. You want to play this bastard\u2019s whore, then go for it. See who gives a damn when it\u2019s all over and you\u2019re the one crying in your beer rather than those pathetic little sluts you\u2019ve consoled over the years.\u201d</p><p>Ouch.</p><p>Rogue ignored Zeke\u2019s suddenly penetrating look as Jonesy straightened, threw them both a furious glance, and stalked back out of the office. The opened door slammed behind him with enough force to leave Rogue wincing.</p><p>She faced Zeke. Two days. She hadn\u2019t seen or heard from him in two days, and she was at the point that she didn\u2019t want to see or hear from him.</p><p>Men. They made women insane for a reason. They were so damned closed minded and closed in on themselves that it made her crazy. Even her father shared those qualities, to a point.</p><p>\u201cYou can leave now as well,\u201d she told Zeke as his broad shoulders shifted beneath the black shirt.</p><p>\u201cYou know that\u2019s not going to happen.\u201d Was his voice deeper than she remembered it or had she just never seen him angry before?</p><p>She knew his effect on her hadn\u2019t gone away. Her heart was tripping in her chest, excitement filled her, and she swore she could almost taste him in her mouth again.</p><p>Wild, tangy, and completely sexy. She wanted more of him, and she knew it was the last thing she should allow herself to reach out for.</p><p>But she ached for him. Ached for his kiss, his touch. She ached for more than a few hidden little bedroom sessions and the knowledge that just as Jonesy accused, she would be no more than a very small notch on his bedpost.</p><p>\u201cOne fight a night is enough.\u201d She rubbed at her arms, knowing she had more to face tonight than just this overriding need for Zeke\u2019s touch.</p><p>She had never been frightened of Jonesy as long as she had known him. They had yelled, screamed, thrown things, but he had never shaken her, he had never let his anger spike to the point that he was a threat rather than a friend.</p><p>\u201cLet me see your arms.\u201d He advanced.</p><p>Rogue retreated behind her desk. \u201cMy arms are fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour arms are fucking bruised,\u201d he bit out, his expression becoming livid now. \u201cDo you think I don\u2019t see those bruises forming even now, Rogue? Do you think I\u2019ll stand for it?\u201d</p><p>Rogue pressed her lips together in an effort to gain control. She was halfway tempted to bite her tongue just to hold back her own anger.</p><p>\u201cI think, quite simply, that it\u2019s none of your damned business.\u201d And that was no less than the truth. \u201cYou\u2019re not my father, my brother, my lover, or my husband, so I guess you lucked out in the explanations department, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>What stroke of fate had decided that this man had to fascinate her as no other did? That his kiss, his touch had to torment her, haunt her? She didn\u2019t want this, and she knew he didn\u2019t, either. He had proven that two days ago when he had sent her on her way without so much as a good-bye kiss, a hug. There had been nothing to soften the humiliation that had filled her. That still filled her.</p><p>Having him here in her office, seeing him, being close to him was torture. She had fantasized for so many years, dreamed of him for so long. The knowledge that she couldn\u2019t have him, not fully, sliced through her soul like a dull knife.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re fooling yourself,\u201d he told her, his voice rough. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be lovers, Rogue. We both know it.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head to that.</p><p>God, she was tired of this internal fight within herself. Lately, it seemed her emotions were never under control, and she blamed him for that. He had tilted her world on its axis, and she was having a hell of a time straightening it back up.</p><p>\u201cI think, Zeke, being lovers would be the worst decision the two of us could make. You need to turn around and leave. Get back in your nifty little sheriff\u2019s vehicle, and go look up one of your former closet lovers or whoever you keep dangling as a replacement.</p><p>Because this isn\u2019t going to work.\u201d</p><p>She wouldn\u2019t hide in a closet. She couldn\u2019t. Rogue knew that the one thing she couldn\u2019t do was enter into an emotionless relationship with this man.</p><p>His lips tilted as she watched him. A half grin, filled with male confidence and certainty.</p><p>He stood before her, the epitome of the alpha male, and a shiver raced up her spine as he watched her. There was nothing hidden, nothing latent in that look. It was pure male power and sexual intent.</p><p>It was dominant.</p><p>Heat flushed through her body as she stepped back. Distance, she needed distance between them before he could follow through with that look.</p><p>\u201cDid you really think I was just going to let this go after the other day?\u201d he asked, advancing on her. \u201cYou were on your knees, Rogue. You climaxed as I came in your mouth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you pushed me right out the door five seconds later,\u201d she reminded him. \u201cYou weren\u2019t just ashamed that we were caught by your son. You were ashamed of being with me, period.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t broadcast my affairs.\u201d His expression tightened as Rogue felt her chest ache.</p><p>\u201cThen you won\u2019t be having an affair with me,\u201d she told him quietly. \u201cFind someone else, Zeke, because I can\u2019t afford the broken heart.\u201d</p><p>She thought he would heed the request. A part of her was certain he would turn and walk right back out of her office and out of her life.</p><p>Nothing could have prepared her for how quickly he moved, his hand latching around her wrist, pulling her to him an instant before he threw her over his shoulder and strode from the office.</p><p>TEN</p><p>\u201cHave you lost your mind?\u201d Furious, outraged,Rogue beat at Zeke\u2019s back as he strode from her office and made the turn to the stairs that led to her apartment.</p><p>\u201cLet me go, you bastard!\u201d She pinched his ass, ineffective as it was through his heavy jeans.</p><p>\u201cSettle down, you little wildcat.\u201d The order was followed by a heated slap to her ass, not quite a caress, too hot to be anything but a warning.</p><p>Rogue froze. She felt the heat travel from her ass, up her spine, back down, and into places she didn\u2019t want to consider. Not as furious as she was. Not in the position she was now in.</p><p>\u201cThis is insane,\u201d she screeched. \u201cDamn you, Zeke, let me go this instant.\u201d</p><p>A muscular arm held her steady as he reached the landing and pushed open the door to her apartment.</p><p>\u201cYou need a spanking,\u201d he growled. \u201cLeaving your apartment door unlocked like that is dangerous, Rogue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs dangerous as giving you the time of day?\u201d She fought her hair, fought a response burning in her stomach that she didn\u2019t want to feel.</p><p>\u201cAs dangerous as getting on your knees and sucking my dick.\u201d The door slammed behind him as he spoke.</p><p>A second later, she was bouncing on the couch, fighting her hair for precious seconds before she was back on her feet, teetering in the high heels as her arm swung back, her fist clenched, and she let loose with every ounce of strength she possessed toward his face. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Rogue had never hit anyone deliberately. She was an admitted pacifist unless backed into a corner. She could feel the corner at her back now.</p><p>His fingers caught her wrist a second before she could make contact.</p><p>Zeke stared at her small fist, feeling that ravenous hunger burning through him. She was his weakness, and he couldn\u2019t figure out why. She tempted the darkness. She tempted hungers he didn\u2019t want to admit to.</p> <p>Staring down at her, he locked her gaze with his, watching her, seeing the hurt and the anger that darkened her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have let you go the other day,\u201d he admitted, fighting to tamp back needs he knew he should keep carefully hidden.</p><p>\u201cOf course you should have.\u201d Disdain and anger filled her voice. \u201cThat was the biggest favor you could have done me.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t let her go as she tugged at her wrist. He should, he knew he should. He stared into her furious little face and saw the hurt she was trying to hide. Pain he had dealt her.</p><p>\u201cStop fighting me, Rogue.\u201d He caught her other wrist as she slapped at his chest in her bid for freedom. \u201cSettle down, we\u2019ll talk about this.\u201d</p> <p>God, he needed her to settle down. Now, before he lost complete control.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something to talk about?\u201d Her eyes narrowed on him, defiance shimmering in those violet eyes. \u201cSorry, Zeke, but I guess I just don\u2019t have much left to say.\u201d</p><p>She struggled against him again. It wasn\u2019t a halfhearted struggle; the little minx was putting some serious effort into breaking his hold. The harder she fought against him, the more he tensed. He could feel that haze of lust burning at the edges of his vision. He hadn\u2019t felt it in years, not since leaving L.A., not since he had begun denying those urges and refusing to allow himself lovers that knew how to push those buttons. But never had he had a woman as innocent, as unknowing as Rogue awaken that core of sexuality he possessed.</p><p>\u201cRogue, enough.\u201d He heard his own voice deepen, felt his cock hardening painfully, throbbing beneath the confinement of his jeans as his balls drew up violently.</p><p>\u201cKiss off, Sheriff Mayes,\u201d she snarled, lifting herself, glaring back at him, her eyes, those beautiful fey eyes watching him in anger and in hunger. He could see the hunger; he could sense it, feel it.</p><p>Before she could evade his move he had both her wrists in one hand, his other cupping her jaw. He was going to burn in hell for this and he knew it. He was helpless against it.</p> <p>His control was so damned thin it was all he could do to hold on, but the dominance surging forward was another control. One he reveled in, one he knew he needed to fight even as he let it have hold.</p><p>Just for a second, he promised himself. Just for this moment. He wouldn\u2019t let it go further. He\u2019d keep from taking her, he\u2019d keep himself from frightening her, from revealing all the dark acts he wanted to commit on that gorgeous little body.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather kissyou .\u201d</p><p>He held her arms behind her back, arching her closer, feeling her stomach cushion his cock as she writhed against him, stroking his arousal higher.</p><p>Damn, she needed to stay still. Just for a moment.</p><p>He held her jaw firmly, stared at her lips, felt her arching against him, and gave in to the need clawing at his mind and at his body.</p><p>Zeke knew kissing Rogue again was a damned bad idea. He had come to talk to her, to try to figure out a way to have her and to hold back that part of himself now slipping free.</p><p>There was no way to do it, he finally admitted to himself. As his lips covered hers, as he felt her gasp, tighten in his arms, he knew having her would mean breaking every damned rule he had lived his life by for years now.</p> <p>Not having her wasn\u2019t an option. Not when her kiss was like fuel to a fire. Not when touching her became as important as breathing. Not when the very act of possessing her mouth sent a surge of adrenaline racing through him.</p><p>Defiance raged in the air around him now. His tongue parted her lips, pressed forward, and felt her furious cry. But he also felt her need. She was shuddering in his arms despite her struggles, fighting not to capitulate, struggling not just against him but against the pleasure that he could have told her there was no way to resist.</p><p>This pleasure was addictive. Rogue\u2019s kiss. Driven with challenge. Her teeth would have nipped at his tongue if he hadn\u2019t controlled the graceful line of her jaw. Instead, her tongue pressed against his, fought against it, and he felt a surge of heat so blistering it burned away the remaining resistance he\u2019d built against his need for it. He wanted her to fight. He wanted her to defy him. He wanted to tie her to his bed and spend hours fucking her into exhaustion. Until there was no defiance, until there was only pleasure.</p><p>No fear. No anger.</p><p>God, he had to rein back, just a little. She was a virgin. She had no idea what he could demand from her. He had to be gentle, he had to make sure she remembered this night with pleasure. The need for that was almost as sharp as the need for her touch. As sharp as the need to hear her screaming his name.</p><p>\u201cDamn you,\u201d she tried to scream as he lifted his lips and stared down at her swollen lips. \u201cWhat are you trying to do to me, Zeke?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTaste you,\u201d he murmured, those pouty lips holding his attention as he allowed his thumb to rake across the lower curve. \u201cI\u2019ve spent two days remembering the taste of your kiss, the feel of your lips against mine, then wrapped so snug around my cock. I didn\u2019t get enough, Rogue. I need more.\u201d</p><p>Another shudder raked through her body. The tremor was hard, telling. Her thighs relaxed against him despite the anger in her eyes and the refusal he could see hovering on her lips.</p><p>\u201cTell me to leave again and I won\u2019t return,\u201d he warned her harshly, his lips lowering again to brush hers as he spoke. \u201cAnything is negotiable but that. Tell me to leave, and it will be over before it begins.\u201d</p><p>Her breathing hitched. Shadows of indecision filled her eyes as she stared back at him.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do this to me if you expect me to act like your other women in public, Zeke.</p><p>Pretending we\u2019re not touching, that we\u2019re nothing to each other. I can\u2019t do that. I\u2019m not some whore you\u2019re buying and can just walk away from before the sun comes up.\u201d</p><p>It would be so much easier if that were the case. But he already knew it wasn\u2019t. He had known as he stared down at her two days ago, his erection filling her mouth. She had never gone down on a man before. She had never taken his release and she had never known the stinging rejection he\u2019d dealt her moments later. Or the regret that dug into his guts like a knife each time he thought of how he must have hurt her.</p><p>He doubted she had ever faced a relationship with a man who demanded as much from a woman as he knew he could demand from her. So much that his first wife had refused to sleep with him for years.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have relationships,\u201d he told her. \u201cI\u2019ve not had a relationship since I returned here from L.A., Rogue, for a reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGossip?\u201d she sneered.</p><p>He smiled at that. \u201cI never gave a damn what anyone thought. I cared more about making certain I never allowed myself to be caught in a loveless relationship or that no other woman ever paid for my sins as my wife did. If no one knew who I was fucking or thought I cared about who I was fucking, then they were safe.\u201d</p><p>He watched her gaze flicker then, those beautiful violet eyes watching him intently as he held her hands against the wall.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re involved in an investigation,\u201d she whispered. \u201cJoe and Jaime were mixed up in something, weren\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t, he wouldn\u2019t discuss this. Not here. Not yet. He shook his head instead. \u201cI don\u2019t know what they were involved in, Rogue. But being careful is a part of me.</p><p>Protecting you will always be a priority with me. You\u2019ll have to accept that. There\u2019s no other choice.\u201d</p><p>She stared up at him, her eyes wide, lips parted. \u201cI make my own choices.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not an easy lover,\u201d he told her softly then. \u201cI\u2019m not the type of the man that will watch his woman flirt and laugh with other men, that will allow other men to touch her with anything approaching intimacy, with any semblance of grace. You\u2019re a young woman, Rogue. Sweet and flirty and filled with life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I know how to be a woman,\u201d she informed him fiercely. \u201cAnd I know the rules of the game, Zeke. You won\u2019t own me any more than I expect to own you.\u201d</p><p>Zeke felt his stomach flex, his muscles tightening at the look in her eyes. Frustration and heated anger filled her gaze. She was a woman ready to explode in his hands, and how he touched her, how he treated her would decide if she exploded in pleasure, or in rage.</p><p>\u201cThere will be no other men.\u201d He leaned closer, letting her feel the determination, the arousal filling him. He couldn\u2019t let her feel his hands shaking, he wouldn\u2019t let her feel the adrenaline and need burning inside him. Touching her was like a shock of electricity that sang through his body, leaving every nerve on high alert.</p><p>\u201cThere are no other men now,\u201d she argued back. \u201cYou can\u2019t change who or what I am. I own a bar. I talk, I laugh, and I dance, and you won\u2019t change that.\u201d</p><p>And he had suspected that. Could he accept it? Could he get past the possessiveness that rose inside him like a sharp- toothed monster waiting to tear into any other man who even thought about touching her?</p><p>Zeke stared down at her, unwilling to delve too much into what he knew were deeply imbedded possessive traits. What was his belonged solely to him. He wasn\u2019t a man that could or would share the woman he allowed fully into his life.</p><p>And to have Rogue, he would have to allow her fully into his life. There was no other answer. Some part of him, a part that clenched his chest and left him aching for her long into the night, warned him that fully in his life was exactly where he wanted her to be.</p><p>It was a problem he would have to tackle later. It was a worry that had gnawed at his mind far longer than he wanted to admit. It was one of the concerns that had held him back in the past years, that had kept him from taking what he knew he could convince Rogue to give him.</p><p>\u201cI tried to stay away from you.\u201d He had to taste her flesh. Zeke lowered his head, his lips pressing beneath her jaw, right there, where the flesh was so tender, where her pulse beat erratically.</p><p>He licked at the flesh, felt her shiver. His teeth raked over it, and he needed more. The taste of her was incredible. The sound of her breath catching, the feel of her melting in his arms was addictive.</p><p>God, he needed her. The need was like a fever devouring his insides. He ached for her.</p><p>Ached clear to his soul for something he didn\u2019t even know how to name.</p><p>Drawing back, his hand framed her neck, not threateningly, possessively.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll belong to me.\u201d</p><p>Rogue\u2019s eyes widened, her heart raced. She had never seen this expression on a man\u2019s face, in his eyes. Zeke was staring at her as though his look alone would brand her. The flesh was stretched tight over his cheekbones and lust made his eyes gleam with an intent that had her fighting to breathe.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t let herself hope, but she couldn\u2019t help but hope that she would mean more to him than his other lovers had. How could she let herself believe that? Wasn\u2019t she the one who had sat and listened to several of those past lovers cry into their beers over him? Would she be next?</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t mean that.\u201d Rogue shook her head slowly, hearing it in his voice, seeing the possessiveness in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cDo you think I don\u2019t mean it, Rogue?\u201d</p><p>A shiver raced down her spine as his hand caressed down her throat to her collarbone, and she shivered in reaction. A reaction that was both physical as well as emotional.</p><p>Fingers and palm flat, he touched her completely; not an inch of his palm didn\u2019t touch her.</p><p>Swallowing tightly, she felt sensation wash over her. His voice stroking her senses, his hand on her flesh, sensitizing her, reminding her of the pleasure of his kiss, his touch. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Reminding her of all the fantasies, the dreams she\u2019d had of this man.</p><p>Anticipation and excitement had her shaking. Her heart raced out of control, and she even hoped, though she knew better than to allow herself that commodity. She hoped, maybe, he would care for her, just a little. That the emotions that rose inside her whenever she thought of him, saw him, would be returned in some small measure.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t resist allowing her head to fall back to the wall as his fingers, his hand, slid to the rise of her breasts, revealed by the violet lace that peeked over the top of the deeply cut vest.</p> <p>\u201cLeather and lace.\u201d The words were grating, rasping from his throat with primitive arousal. \u201cDo you know what that does to a man?\u201d</p><p>She licked her lips slowly, aching for more of him. \u201cMaybe it just does it to you.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head slowly, his fingers flicking the first button of the vest open. \u201cNot just me, baby. Every man that sees you lusts for you. It\u2019s in his face, in his eyes. That lace peeking over the leather. It makes a man want to tame you.\u201d</p><p>The second button slid open. Then the third, second by second the snug material of the butter-soft leather vest loosened until the edges hung open and the lacy camisole was revealed and another part of her resistance fell away.</p><p>She wore no bra. Her breasts swelled, her nipples hardening further beneath his gaze as he brushed the edges of the vest aside.</p> <p>\u201cLast chance,\u201d he said, his voice soft, deep. \u201cTell me to leave, Rogue. If I stay, you don\u2019t know the things I\u2019ll ask of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d She swallowed tightly as she fought to breathe. \u201cMaybe you should be the one to make that decision, Zeke. I\u2019m not a child. And never imagine I don\u2019t know what I want.\u201d</p><p>She wanted all of him. She wanted that assurance in his eyes that the wildness rising inside her would be harnessed, would be satiated. She wanted the heat rising inside her quenched. She wanted to experience the wild hunger and need she glimpsed in his eyes.</p><p>That hunger poured through her when his lips lowered to hers. They covered hers, his tongue pressing past them as he stole her breath. Nothing had ever made her more aware of the restlessness, the wildness that filled her than this kiss. The feel of his lips stroking over hers, the pleasure cascading through her body, rushing through her veins.</p><p>Hard, calloused palms cupped her breasts; confident, knowing fingers raked over her nipples. Pleasure shot from the tender tips to scatter over her nerve endings. Like tiny implosions, a rush of sensation that had her gasping and arching closer to the warmth of his hands. This was incredible. Oh God, how had she waited so long for his touch?</p><p>She lifted her hands from her sides, plowed them into the short strands of his hair, and tried to force him to kiss her deeper, harder. Tongues twining, lips melding.</p> <p>It was incredible. The rush of adrenaline through her veins, the heat that seared her flesh. This was what she dreamed of in the deepest part of the night.</p><p>The surge of pleasure that tore from her nipples to her clit, that swelled the little bud between her thighs and set it to throbbing in a hard, hot tempo. Perspiration dampened her flesh and she swore she could feel his touch beneath her skin.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She grabbed his head as his lips lifted. He was going to stop now? Right when she could feel the rising crescendo of pleasure whipping through her pussy, heating it, sending her juices flowing between her thighs?</p><p>She found her hands caught in the grip of one of his again. He pressed them back against the wall, over her head, as she forced her lashes open and stared into the dark, taut lines of his expression.</p><p>\u201cDamn, you\u2019re like dynamite.\u201d His free hand slid low on her stomach, then caressed back up, sliding beneath the camisole as she sucked in a hard, moaning breath.</p><p>Calloused fingers rasped over her flesh, sending waves of sensation washing through her. The pleasure was almost violent. It was incredible. The way it struck against her nerve endings, caused them to jerk, to press more fully against him as he held her, hands bound, his body pressing her against the wall.</p><p>\u201cLook at your face,\u201d he whispered. \u201cOne of these days I\u2019ll take you in front of a mirror where you can see how good it is.\u201d</p><p>In front of a mirror? She blushed at the thought, and Rogue wasn\u2019t prone to blushes.</p> <p>Except with Zeke. Just thinking about him could make her blush.</p><p>Her gaze dropped to where his hand cupped her breast over the camisole, lifting it, pressing the swollen mound up until it appeared to want to spill over the edge of the lace.</p><p>\u201cI want your nipple in my mouth, Rogue.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes jerked up, widened, and right there she lost her breath. A gasp left her lips and the moan that fell from them shocked her.</p><p>\u201cDo you want your nipple in my mouth, sweetheart?\u201d The hard shiver that raced up her spine shocked her.</p><p>\u201cDo I have to beg for it?\u201d she asked, amazed at the sultriness of her voice. \u201cGee, Zeke, here you\u2019ve gone all dominant on me just to start asking permission now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmart-ass.\u201d His lips quirked into the sexiest little grin, even as his golden brown eyes seemed to flare with heat.</p><p>A second later the lacy cup of the camisole was pushed beneath her breast and his head lowered. Hot, firm lips surrounded her nipple. Rasping, ecstatic pleasure surrounded the sensitive tip as she strained against his grip.</p><p>She needed to touch him. She was desperate to touch him, to feel him. To feel more of this. To hold his head closer to her breast, to force her throbbing nipple deeper into his mouth. She wanted to feel him sucking her harder, feel his teeth scraping.</p><p>\u201cOh God. Zeke.\u201d She felt it. His teeth rasping over the tender tip, sending a flood of sensation racing to her clit and the depths of her pussy.</p><p>Her muscles spasmed inside, clenched, and a sense of emptiness overwhelmed her.</p><p>She tried not to watch him. Watching his lips tugging at her breast, feeling his tongue curl around the swollen tip triggered sensations that bit into her womb with sharp, erotic teeth as her heart pounded out of control.</p><p>But she was still in control. She assured herself she was. Until his lashes lifted, then his knee bent and pressed between her thighs as he lowered his arm and pulled her hips forward.</p><p>Oh Lord, have mercy. The butter-soft leather slid over denim, pressing his thigh firmly against the swollen, sensitive flesh of her pussy until she was riding his thigh.</p><p>It was exquisite. It was the most pleasure Rogue had ever known in her life, and she was desperate for more. She whimpered at the need, at the pleasure.</p><p>She wanted to hold him to her, desperate to feel every sensation, every chaotic emotion raging through her. This was Zeke, and she had waited so long, had dreamed for so long.</p><p>\u201cLet me touch you,\u201d she moaned, straining against the hold he had on her wrists as his head lifted, his lips raking over the valley between her breasts. He nudged the camisole over her other breast, kissed around the enflamed tip of her nipple, and without answering or giving in to her plea, drew it into his mouth.</p><p>There was no such thing as control in Zeke\u2019s arms. There was only this. Flashpoints of pleasure that seared her, left her trembling, damp with perspiration, and shaking as his hand slid down her stomach to the low-rise band of her pants.</p><p>The snap and zipper were dealt with quickly, efficiently. The edges spread apart as he slid his thigh back and pressed his hand inside.</p><p>Rogue froze. Even the breath seemed suspended in her lungs as his fingers inched lower, lower.</p><p>She was slick and wet. She could feel it against the crotch of the thong she wore. The swollen inner lips were heated, slick, bare of curls, and awaiting his touch.</p><p>His fingers paused just above her clit. His head lifted from her breast with one last lick to her hypersensitive nipple.</p><p>\u201cAre you a virgin?\u201d</p><p>The question shocked her. It tore through her mind with all the implications of the truth that might cause him to walk away from her.</p><p>\u201cOh really, Zeke,\u201d she chided breathlessly, weakly. \u201cI\u2019m a bar owner and a biker chick.</p><p>Do you really think I\u2019m a virgin?\u201d</p><p>Brave last words. She almost snorted at her own daring in lying to him. It wasn\u2019t as though he wouldn\u2019t find out the truth soon enough if this continued.</p><p>The sharp little nip to her lips and the narrowing of his gaze was a warning.</p><p>\u201cThat was a nice, evasive little answer.\u201d</p><p>She gasped as he released her wrists, only to swing her up in his arms and stride into the bedroom. Within seconds she was bouncing on the bed, pushing at her hair as it fell over her eyes and feeling his hands at her hips, dragging her pants over her thighs.</p><p>He didn\u2019t waste time. Evidently, he must have felt as though he had already wasted enough time. Her shoes were slipped from her feet and the pants tossed to the floor before she could protest. If she meant to protest. She was certain she didn\u2019t.</p><p>Why would she protest? He was staring between her thighs, his expression tight, a muscle ticking in his jaw as he straightened and began unbuttoning his shirt quickly.</p><p>Just his look was enough to make her breath short and labored, enough to cause her heart to tighten and ache with the emotions racing through her.</p><p>And this was more than a casual fuck to him as well. What tomorrow would bring she had no idea, but for now, this meant something to him. Dark emotion shadowed his eyes and tormented desire filled the air around them.</p><p>\u201cTake off the vest,\u201d he ordered.</p><p>There wasn\u2019t a request in his voice, it was an order, plain and simple.</p><p>It made her shiver. The dominance in his expression, in his voice, it was wild and erotic and called to the wildness Rogue had fought to keep in check inside herself, for so long.</p><p>Her fingers fell to the vest as she sat up. It slid easily from her shoulders.</p><p>\u201cThe camisole.\u201d His shirt fell to the floor before he sat down on the edge of the bed to jerk his boots off.</p><p>Rogue pulled the camisole off as she fought the disconcerting feeling of being naked in front of him. No one had seen her naked since she was a child. But Zeke was seeing her now.</p><p>He rose to his feet, his hands going to the belt that cinched his hips. He unbuckled it quickly, confidently. The snap and zipper on his jeans came next. Then he was shedding them along with the snug boxer briefs he wore. The material slid over his powerful thighs and released the heavy length of his cock to her avid gaze.</p><p>She\u2019d had him in her mouth. She\u2019d tasted his release. But she hadn\u2019t reallyseen his erection until now. Hard, thick, heavily veined. The crest was dark, flared out, and flushed with an excess of lust with a small drop of pre-cum gracing the tip.</p><p>Rogue licked her lips, the remembered taste of his release sizzling her senses.</p><p>She was reaching for him when his hands landed on her shoulders. One knee braced on the bed, he pushed her back, loomed over her, his head lowering, his lips taking hers.</p><p>He took the kiss he wanted. His lips captured hers, held them imprisoned as his tongue slid between them and conquered hers. The kiss was hard, erotic, so sensual that the pleasure of it slammed into her senses, igniting the lust already flaming out of control.</p><p>The rasp of his chest hairs against her nipples had her arching close, crying out.</p><p>Pleasure shouldn\u2019t be this extreme. It shouldn\u2019t be filled with such wonder and such desperation.</p><p>One knee slid between her thighs, pressed high and firm until she was rocking her clit against the heavy muscle of his thigh. And it was so good. It was blazing. Hot. It was so much pleasure, so many sensations that she wondered if she would survive the inferno.</p><p>She had waited so long for this. So many years. And now here she was, naked, lying beneath his heavy, muscular body, her hands touching him, her fingertips catching each flex of his hard biceps as his kiss ravaged her senses.</p><p>\u201cNow.\u201d He pulled back, stared down at her, his gaze hard, brilliant, the color of raw gold as he watched her with predatory awareness. \u201cNow, Rogue, you get to see why I waited. Why I tried like hell to stay away from you. We\u2019ll get to see just how brave you are.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Praise for the novels of Lora Leigh</p><p>\u201cLeigh draws readers into her stories and takes them on a sensual roller coaster.\u201d</p><p>\u2014Love Romances &amp; More</p><p>\u201cLeigh writes wonderfully straightforward and emotional stories with characters that jump off the page.\u201d</p><p>\u2014The Road to Romance</p><p>\u201cFraught with tension from the first page to the last . . .

His fingertips ran from between her breasts to the mound of her pussy, his gaze following the path they took before returning to hers.</p><p>\u201cFrighten you?\u201d he asked. \u201cNo, Rogue, this shouldn\u2019t frighten you at all. I\u2019d never hurt you.\u201d</p><p>The tone of his voice had her heart rate increasing. It was darker, rougher, as though the hunger that glittered in his eyes was at the edge of slipping the leash she could sense he had on it.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t frightened, but she was wary. Zeke wasn\u2019t joking, he was intent, fiercely controlled. Her heart was racing in her chest as his palm flattened on her abdomen and his lips lowered to her neck.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a reason why you don\u2019t want me to touch you?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cThere is,\u201d he admitted, his voice rough. \u201cI want you to feel every touch, every sensation. Don\u2019t worry about anything else. Just feel.\u201d</p><p>His teeth raked over her shoulder. Heated pleasure jumped through the nerve endings there and seared her with heat.</p><p>\u201cWhat if I want to touch you, too?\u201d she gasped.</p><p>\u201cToo bad.\u201d His hands stroked down her side, fingertips pressing, feeling her.</p><p>\u201cNot into mutual pleasure, huh?\u201d She breathed in roughly as he parted her thighs, his head lifting, his gaze locking with hers.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m into you, Rogue,\u201d he said then. \u201cAnd very soon, I\u2019m going to be so into you that you won\u2019t know where you end and I begin.\u201d</p><p>A cry fell from her lips as his teeth raked over a nipple, then his lips closed over it. He didn\u2019t stop there, he lingered long enough to have her arching, writhing beneath his touch before he went to her other breast, tortured it with pleasure, and stoked the arousal burning inside her higher.</p><p>There was something about Zeke\u2019s touch that stole her mind. She would have never trusted another man enough to restrain her, she knew she wouldn\u2019t. But with Zeke the progression of fantasy to reality seemed natural. It was white-hot flames licking over her body where his tongue touched, but it felt natural.</p><p>It was Zeke. Hard, intent. The man she couldn\u2019t get out of her head, and he was touching her.</p><p>Rogue heard the moan that fell from her lips and would have been surprised by the desperation in it if she had been able to actually think clearly. She couldn\u2019t think, she could only feel. Feel what he was doing to her. Feel his hands spreading her thighs, his lips traveling from her breasts along her abdomen, the way his hands pulled her legs apart and he lay between them.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve dreamed about tasting you here again.\u201d His lips were at her hip bone. A kiss, a little nip that had her arching and crying out at the pleasure.</p><p>\u201cSo pretty.\u201d The backs of his fingers slid along the swollen flesh of her flesh. \u201cFlushed and damp. You\u2019re so wet for me, Rogue.\u201d</p><p>She could feel more of her juices easing from her vagina, coating her inner lips, tormenting her with the need for his touch.</p><p>A jerk of reaction tore through her body at the first fiery lick against her clit. A wild cry spilled from her lips as sensation raced along through the tiny bundle of nerves and sent spasms of pleasure clenching her womb.</p><p>Her feet dug into the mattress, her eyes opened, and she became lost in the sight of what he was doing to her. Gently, tenderly, his fingers parted the folds. His jaw tightened for long seconds before his lips parted and a breath of air struck the ultrasensitive bud of her clit before his tongue stroked through the slick folds.</p><p>Jerking, moaning, Rogue felt a landslide of pleasure begin to explode through her body.</p><p>She trembled beneath him, anticipation and hunger building inside her as she fought to hold on to some part of herself.</p><p>She was losing herself in his touch. She could feel it. Every cell of her body was reaching out for him as her heart opened, her soul melted, and she felt herself melding to him.</p><p>\u201cDamn, you taste like candy,\u201d he rasped, his voice tight, rough. \u201cSo fucking sweet I could drown in you.\u201d</p><p>But he licked instead. From the fluttering opening of her vagina to the hard throb of her clit. One slow, long lick as she watched, breathless. His tongue hovered over the bundle of nerves then, flickered around it, stroked, and caressed and sent her flying into a maelstrom of complete eroticism.</p><p>The pleasure was torrential. It washed over her, through her, built and rose until she was swamped with sensation with each lick. Then his lips pursed as they covered her clit to deliver a gentle, ecstatic little kiss that nearly sent her flying into rapture.</p><p>Sensation after sensation slammed through her system. Her womb clenched with it, her sex was drenched in it.</p><p>She wanted to close her eyes. She wanted to revel in the pleasure tearing through her.</p><p>But she wanted to watch. She wanted to stare in his eyes as she was now, and watch as he enjoyed her, tortured her, left her shaking, so close to release she could feel it burning at the edge of her mind.</p><p>\u201cGo over, sweetheart,\u201d he whispered. \u201cGo over for me.\u201d</p><p>His lips closed over her clit. He sucked the little bud into his mouth, his tongue caressed around it, over it, flickered against it, and she exploded. Like a catapult, sensation flew inside her, exploded, vibrating through her body with a violence that had her screaming out his name as she arched to him and felt the quaking sensations tear through her.</p><p>Rapture. It was ecstasy. It was bright lights in front of her eyes and sparks detonating one explosion after another through her senses. It was feeling him touch her, inside and out. It was knowing she would never be the same after Zeke\u2019s possession.</p><p>And he didn\u2019t stop.</p><p>She screamed his name again as his hand slid beneath her rear, clenched, and lifted her until his tongue could plunge inside her. The quick, fierce thrust had her melting, then imploding. Her senses were rioting with the overwhelming pleasure. Perspiration ran from her flesh as her fingers clenched the iron bar her hands were cuffed to.</p><p>Shudders tore through her body. The pleasure was torturous, extreme. It singed every nerve ending, sent flames racing across her flesh, and left her wilder than she had been before.</p><p>She wanted more.</p><p>Opening her eyes she stared back at Zeke as he rose between her thighs, his fingers rolling the condom over the stiff length of his cock.</p><p>For a second, she considered telling him it was her first time. She almost allowed the words to pass her lips. But she forced them back. She didn\u2019t want gentle and tender. She wanted Zeke as he was now, primal, hungry, his gaze reflecting the wildness she felt tearing through her as well.</p><p>\u201cLift to me.\u201d Still sitting on his knees, his hand gripped her hip, pulling her up his thighs until her legs draped at his hips and the heavy width of his cock head pressed against the sensitive folds of her pussy.</p><p>\u201cOh God,\u201d she breathed out, feeling the heat and hardness through the latex as the hard crown pressed against her, into her.</p><p>Seeing Zeke, muscles tight and bulging, his hands holding her hips as he pressed against her, stole her breath, her senses.</p><p>He watched her as though nothing mattered but her\u2014taking her, touching her. The feel of his erection stretching her, pressing deeper fed the wild need burning inside her. She bucked closer. Needing more. She didn\u2019t want slow and easy. She wanted to go wild beneath him, yet he restrained her, held her, watched her, and eased in by only the barest inch before pulling back.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you waiting for?\u201d Bucking against him, she fought the restraints at her wrists and glared back at him.</p><p>He was trying to kill her. He had to be. He was torturing her past bearing.</p><p>But he was just as tortured. Sweat rolled in a thin, damp line down the side of his neck as he stilled, staring down at her, his golden eyes fierce and intent. Desperation hovered in his expression, in the tight lines of his face as hunger glittered in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI need you,\u201d she whispered the plea, begging for more. If he stopped now, could she bear it?</p><p>\u201cTell me you\u2019re mine,\u201d he demanded, his voice dark and low. \u201cSay it, Rogue. Admit it.</p><p>You\u2019re mine.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. She couldn\u2019t belong to him, she didn\u2019t know how to belong to anyone, and she knew he didn\u2019t know how.</p><p>\u201cSay it, Rogue.\u201d He pressed deeper, stretched untried tissue, heated it with his strength and hardness. \u201cTell me. Mine.\u201d The words were a snarl, a growl of ownership as his cock dug in deeper, parted her flesh, and sent a hard, fierce jolt of electric pleasure racing through her.</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d she gasped desperately. \u201cWe can negotiate. I promise, we\u2019ll negotiate. Later.\u201d</p><p>Negotiate? Oh Lord, where had she come up with that one? She stared back at him and might have laughed at his expression if the need wasn\u2019t pumping hard and fast through her veins.</p><p>She had managed to surprise him. She liked that, loved it. He may have the upper hand on her here in the bed, but she still had the ability to affect him as well.</p><p>She jerked at the cuffs again. If only she were free. If only she could touch him, tempt the control that seemed as iron hard as the flesh barely buried inside her.</p><p>\u201cNegotiate?\u201d he asked carefully, his eyes narrowing, his hands flexing on her hips. \u201cYou want to negotiate on whether or not you belong to me, Rogue?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she promised breathlessly, nodding, trying to thrust against his hold. \u201cLater.\u201d</p><p>A smile curled at the ends of his lips. It wasn\u2019t a comfortable smile.</p><p>\u201cOh, bad baby,\u201d his chuckle was dark, knowing. \u201cNegotiate this first.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He slid deeper, pressed inside her slow and easy until the barrier of her virginity drew him to a halt once again.</p><p>Mocking amazement widened his eyes as he felt the shield of her virginity. \u201cWhy, Rogue, would you have lied to me?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head quickly. She hadn\u2019t lied. She really hadn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t stop, Zeke. Please don\u2019t stop.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou lied to me, sweetheart.\u201d He glanced to where his erection was buried no more than an inch inside her. \u201cWhat if I want to punish you for that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTechnicality,\u201d she gasped, tightening around the flesh she held captive. \u201cWe\u2019ll argue later, damn you. Fuck me, Zeke, before I die for it.\u201d</p><p>She bucked against him again, her hips jerking against his hold enough that she was nearly free, that she felt a hard stab into the fragile barrier. But she felt pleasure as well.</p><p>Enough that it stole her breath, left her gasping and twisting in his arms in an attempt to experience more, to know where the sensations racing through her were threatening to take her.</p><p>Hard, calloused hands held her hips still as he moved against her. Slowly. His cock slipped back, then returned. Slow, easy, shallow thrusts that had adrenaline pumping through her system and hungry flames burning around her.</p> <p>\u201cNot enough,\u201d she cried out, her hands clenched around the bars of the bed. \u201cNot enough, Zeke. Please.\u201d</p><p>Tears filled her eyes as perspiration dampened her body. She fought against his hold, twisting, surging against him, needing. Oh God, she needed. So bad.</p><p>He pulled back again, ignoring her tight, smothered scream. Pausing at the entrance to her pussy, he stilled for a moment, letting her work herself on the crest. Her juices coated the condom-covered flesh as she stared down at where they met.</p><p>She pushed closer, gasped, cried out as he buried deeper, then deeper yet as his hips surged forward, his cock tearing past that last veil of innocence.</p><p>Rogue stilled. Her eyes flashed to his face from where he was buried inside her. Burning heat and liquid pleasure seemed to enfold her. She felt as though she was drowning in the contradictory sensations as she stared into the hard, savagely honed features of his face.</p><p>\u201cI told you,\u201d he grimaced. \u201cMine. Deny it, damn you.\u201d</p> <p>Rogue shook her head. She wouldn\u2019t deny it. She wouldn\u2019t confirm it. She didn\u2019t know what belonging meant, and she was certain he had no idea what it meant to own that part of her.</p><p>He could have this. This was exquisite. It was desperate. It was real. This need, this burning hunger, every part of it. This she understood.</p><p>\u201cDamn you,\u201d he cursed again, pulled back, and buried fully inside her in one hard, long stroke.</p><p>He buried into her entire being. Rogue felt a flash stroke of emotion that made no sense as he moved over her. The cuffs fell away from her hands and she was touching him, holding him.</p><p>Locking her arms around his shoulders, wrapping her legs around his hips, her head tilted back and a low, drawn-out cry left her lips. He was moving hard and fast inside her now. Once he breached the barrier of her virginity, he didn\u2019t let up, he didn\u2019t stop.</p><p>His fingers tangled in her hair, turned her head, and his lips were on the column of her neck. Hard, fierce kisses, the scrape of his teeth, a nip, and the quick, hard thrusts inside her were the catalyst. The explosion when it came destroyed her. She felt parts of herself dissolving, burning, turning to ash. She couldn\u2019t scream, she could barely breathe.</p><p>Eyes wide open, staring blankly at the ceiling as a heated kiss was pressed to her neck, and she felt herself free-falling. She was lost to the sensations burning around her, through her. She was lost to Zeke, and she was very much afraid she just might truly belong to him in ways that might end up terrifying her later.</p><p>\u201cAh God!\u201d A harsh exclamation left his lips, his thrusts became harder, ratcheting her release higher until she felt him shudder. Felt his kiss at her neck become more fierce, hotter. Marking her. He had marked her. Again.</p> <p>Rogue tightened her hold on him, keeping him to her as she clenched through the final tremors of her release, and exhaustion began to claim her.</p><p>Her legs slid to the bed, but her arms remained around his neck. She didn\u2019t want to let him go. She didn\u2019t want to lose him tonight.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t leave yet,\u201d she whispered, her voice slurring from the exertion and the pleasure.</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d he agreed, his lips caressing her ear. \u201cNot even soon.\u201d</p><p>She wanted to whimper as he pulled back. Instead, she loosened her hold and let him move, watching as he straightened from the bed and headed to the bathroom.</p><p>She was surprised when she heard the shower running and disappointed for the few seconds it took before he returned to the bedroom.</p><p>\u201cCome on, naughty baby.\u201d He picked her up in his arms before she could protest and carried her to the bathroom. \u201cWe\u2019ll shower and see if you won\u2019t let me sleep a few minutes tonight.\u201d</p><p>She cuddled against his chest rather than protesting that he was the one that was keeping her awake. She didn\u2019t want to protest it, she loved it. Craved it. She wondered if she would ever have enough.</p><p>Zeke had a feeling he would never have enough of the fiery-haired little hellion he carried to the shower. Placing her on her feet, he crowded her into the glass stall before closing the door and letting the water fall over them.</p><p>She stared up at him, her expression slumberous, and he swore his chest clenched in response to it. When had any woman affected him as this one had? He had never showered with one before. He had never soaped a washcloth and cleaned another woman\u2019s body as he was washing Rogue\u2019s. And she had never been cared for in this fashion.</p><p>She was a virgin. Untouched. Untried. Unmolded. Her body would fit his alone now, she would always remember his touch, always know who had been the first.</p><p>Damn, pride swelled as hard and thick inside him as his dick swelled between his thighs. She had waited. He didn\u2019t want to fool himself into believing that she had waited for him, there lay disaster. There lay a relationship that could end up destroying the balance he had found in his life.</p><p>Holding back with her hadn\u2019t been easy. He had freed just enough of the dominance inside of him that he could be easy with her now, gentle. But it wasn\u2019t enough. He wanted so much more. He wanted her so wild she didn\u2019t know her own name. He wanted her screaming out for him. He wanted her swearing she belonged to him, and to him alone.</p><p>And once she did, he asked himself, what then? Could he swear himself to her?</p><p>As he watched suds slide sensually from the slender line of her back, over the pale, full globes of her ass, the question taunted him. He had promised himself he would never vow his soul to another woman. He had done that with Elaina. With their marriage he had given her parts of himself he hadn\u2019t been comfortable letting go of at the time. And over the years, he had learned to regret it.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t let regret stain whatever was developing between him and Rogue. Ignoring his own needs wouldn\u2019t work. As he watched the suds cover her rear, his teeth clenched at the needs that began to fill him again.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t let her go. Not yet. And he knew whatever this was between them, it would be nothing as it had been with past lovers. He wouldn\u2019t be leaving Rogue\u2019s bed when dawn broke. He\u2019d be lucky if he managed to get to work on time. Because he was hungry. Because this need clawing at his guts warned him he wouldn\u2019t know a measure of satiation for many hours yet.</p><p>Pushing her hair farther over her shoulder he laid his lips at her neck, stroked the soapy rag over her ass before hanging it on the shower rack and catching her wrists.</p><p>He heard the breathy little catch as he flattened her hands against the shower wall and pressed her legs apart with his foot.</p><p>\u201cI want you again.\u201d He had to have her again.</p><p>Bending his knees, he gripped the stalk of his cock, eased it against the swollen lips of her pussy, and tested her readiness.</p><p>He had to clench his teeth to hold back a yell of pleasure. Fuck, she was tight, hot. So damned good. With slow, easy thrusts this time he pushed inside her until she gripped him to the hilt.</p><p>Without the condom, the heat of her pussy was electrifying. It sizzled around his cock, caused his balls to tighten with the need for release, and sent a shock wave of pleasure tearing up his spine and back down again.</p><p>Have mercy. She was killing him with pleasure. She moved against him, rolling her hips, stroking her slick, hot flesh over his erection, working him in deeper, easing away from him, then teasing him to thrust hard and deep inside her.</p><p>Gripping her hips, Zeke held her still, plunged inside her, and lost himself. He couldn\u2019t hold back, he couldn\u2019t take her slow and easy, not yet. Not until the hunger ripping him to shreds had eased a bit more. He needed her fast and hard, desperate and screaming.</p><p>\u201cZeke!\u201d she screamed, her voice hoarse, fierce. She was coming apart in his arms, clenching around his cock, exploding around him with a force that left him fighting back his release long enough to jerk free of her.</p><p>With one hand he pumped the hard flesh until his semen spilled to her back. The other slid up her hip, to her breasts. He rubbed her nipples, cupped a breast, and lowered his head to the shower wall above hers. His emotions felt jumbled, sharp. He couldn\u2019t get a handle on them, he could only let them free, let them flow with the same jagged sensations he felt as his semen pumped from his cock.</p><p>\u201cFuck. You make me crazy,\u201d he growled, jerking at the pleasure that tore at the fragile bonds of control.</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d she said, her breathing heavy, almost a gasp as she rubbed her head against his chin. \u201cGive me a day or two, then I\u2019ll really show you crazy.\u201d</p><p>He almost smiled, because he had a feeling it could definitely get worse. It could definitely become addictive. Rogue was his weakness, and he had known it for years.</p><p>Zeke wasn\u2019t certain exactly what he thought about having a weakness. But he knew what he thought about having Rogue. And that might be the part that really worried him.</p><p>TWELVE</p><p>Rogue had never slept with a man. Hell, she hadnever slept with anyone, and she hadn\u2019t expected to fall asleep after they returned to the bed. But Zeke was as inexhaustible as he was rumored to be with his lovers. As though the same wildness that tortured her filled him as well, and the only way for him to extinguish it was in sex.</p><p>Which was fine with Rogue. By the time he had her the third time, she was exhausted and slipped easily into his arms and into sleep, never imagining he would still be there when she awoke the next morning.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t a dawn kinda girl. The morning sun was high in the sky before wakefulness had begun intruding on the heated, comfortable slumber she was enjoying.</p><p>Her pillow wasn\u2019t too hard, it wasn\u2019t too soft. Evidently she had managed to ball her blankets up in front of her again, something to hold on to through the night, because her arm was resting across something.</p><p>Something that moved slow and easy. Something that breathed. It wasn\u2019t her blanket.</p><p>Memories of the night rushed through her then, flushing her face as she remembered how tirelessly Zeke had taken her, and how she had met each thrust. At times she had been forced to bite her tongue to hold back the pleas for something more. Something . . .</p><p>just more.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t that she didn\u2019t orgasm. Oh boy, had she orgasmed. Satisfaction had definitely not been a problem. But there was an underlying restlessness she still hadn\u2019t managed to figure out.</p><p>\u201cWake up, sleepyhead.\u201d Zeke\u2019s voice was scratchy, still a little drowsy.</p><p>\u201cNot time yet.\u201d She almost smiled. \u201cI don\u2019t go to work until tonight.\u201d</p><p>He grunted at that. \u201cYeah, Janey\u2019s still glaring at me and Alex is laughing his ass off because he caught me waiting on you the other night. I should spank you for that, Rogue.\u201d</p><p>Her buttocks clenched involuntarily at the threat. Okay, so she had well fantasized about Zeke spanking her more than once. One of those erotic little spankings she had read about a time or two. She had a lot of fantasies where Zeke was concerned. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHey, you were the one waiting.\u201d She rolled to her back and stared up at him, her heart racing as he propped his head on his hand and remained on his side, watching her.</p><p>\u201cYou could have driven me home if you had shown any interest in doing so.\u201d</p><p>A dark brown brow arched. \u201cI\u2019ve been showing decided interest of late,\u201d he pointed out. \u201cEven my son managed to notice my interest.\u201d</p> <p>Heat built in her face at the reminder of exactly how interested Shane knew his father was now. She rolled back to her stomach and buried her face in her pillow at the reminder.</p><p>\u201cGo to work,\u201d she mumbled.</p><p>He chuckled, his hand settling on her back beneath the sheet, his fingers rubbing at her hip.</p><p>\u201cShower with me.\u201d She felt his lips at her ear, a tender kiss that reminded her of the aches she could feel in the tender parts of her body.</p><p>The thought of showering with him definitely aroused her interest though. As well as other things. She felt herself growing damp, felt her clit awakening and tingling at the thought.</p> <p>\u201cShower only.\u201d He nipped at her ear before she could turn to face him. \u201cOther activities can wait until tonight.\u201d</p><p>She stared back at him, seeing the amused curl of his lips, the warmth in his eyes. He was sexy like this, playful and seductive. His short hair wasn\u2019t long enough to really get mussed, but it wasn\u2019t as perfectly in place as it was when he\u2019d arrived at her office the night before.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I don\u2019t want to wait until tonight.\u201d She let her hand settle on his chest before allowing it to slide down, caressing along his abdomen and moving lower.</p><p>\u201cMinx.\u201d He caught her hand. \u201cWe\u2019ll play later. This morning, we have to talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d She was more interested in exploring his manly body now that she had it in her bed.</p><p>\u201cYour bartender.\u201d</p> <p>Rogue stilled. The steely quality of his voice assured her that play-time wasn\u2019t going to happen right now. Evidently Zeke was no more pleased with Jonesy this morning than he had been the night before.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll handle Jonesy.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cI\u2019ve been dealing with him for several years now, Zeke. I don\u2019t need your help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t ask you if you needed my help.\u201d His voice hardened.</p><p>\u201cI said we\u2019re going to discuss this. The discussion will involve how quickly you\u2019ll be firing him.\u201d</p><p>Rogue flipped the sheet off her and rolled to the edge of the bed before standing, fully nude, and stalking to the chair across the room that held her robe.</p><p>\u201cGet your shower; I\u2019ll fix your coffee,\u201d she told him, ignoring the anger that wanted to flash hot and wild inside her.</p><p>\u201cCoffee won\u2019t settle this, Rogue,\u201d he warned her. \u201cYour bartender wasn\u2019t just disrespectful last night, he was threatening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you know nothing about him.\u201d She turned as she belted her robe snugly. \u201cI\u2019m not firing Jonesy, and I\u2019ll warn you right up front, Zeke, I don\u2019t take orders worth shit, so you may as well stop right now.\u201d</p> <p>He was sprawled in her bed as though he had slept there for years rather than hours.</p><p>She had always wondered what it would be like to awaken beside Zeke; she hadn\u2019t expected this.</p><p>\u201cThe next time he threatens you, he may not live to regret it,\u201d he warned her as he rose from the bed, naked and aroused, his cock standing out proudly from his body.</p><p>The sight of it had her mouth watering, her pussy dampening. No man as arrogant as Zeke should look so damned good while he was pissing a woman off.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make sure you\u2019re not around the next time then.\u201d She smiled back at him with brittle mockery. \u201cI know how to get along with Jonesy, Zeke. This isn\u2019t something I need you to take care of for me.\u201d</p><p>A scowl creased his face, and even that made him look damned hot. Hell, she shouldn\u2019t have to deal with an irate Zeke while she was still remembering the touch of his hands and his possession from the night before.</p><p>\u201cDo you need me to take care of anything for you?\u201d he growled.</p><p>Her gaze dropped and she let a teasing smile shape her lips. She could think of several things he could take of. His scowl only deepened, his lips set in a firm line, and he turned and stalked to the bathroom as she stared at him in surprise.</p><p>Damn, Zeke might be pissed off, she thought in amazement. She had never seen Zeke pissed off. It tempted her to stalk right into that bathroom behind him and join him in the shower.</p><p>Unfortunately, having never seen Zeke pissed off, she fought herself, wary of pushing him further. There was a glimmer of warning in his eyes before he turned away. A look that had her tummy jumping in excitement even as she decided to tread very carefully for a while.</p><p>He was right about one thing though. She was going to have to deal with Jonesy. What had happened last night hadn\u2019t really frightened her, but it had concerned her. Jonesy had been uncharacteristically angry with her. It wasn\u2019t like him to lose his temper to that degree over so little.</p><p>Shaking her head, she left the bedroom and headed for the kitchen. She put on a pot of coffee, put some packaged Danishes she had bought at the store the day before on the small kitchen table.</p><p>Zeke had to force himself away from her. The farthest he could get was the shower. It was that or push her against the wall and plow into her with all the frustrated lust building inside him. Except that was the only thing she seemed to think he was capable of doing for her. Fucking her. Son of a bitch, he could feel karma biting his ass now.</p><p>For years, he had wanted nothing from his lovers but sex. Now, it was all he could do to keep from demanding more than that from Rogue. It was a situation he was going to have to fix.</p><p>Would that give her a whole new insight into the man she wanted as a lover? The one and only time he had let his emotions and his control free and had taken Elaina as he had taken Rogue last night, she had cried for hours. He\u2019d felt like the lowest form of a man to walk the face of the earth for months afterward.</p><p>It hadn\u2019t mattered that her body had responded. It hadn\u2019t mattered that she had found her release in the act. At least to her it hadn\u2019t mattered. She had raged that he had treated her like a whore he had bought for the night, and that he had broken her heart with the act.</p><p>Shame had been like a burning demon inside him. It had sliced into his soul and left him fighting to bury the hungers that tormented him.</p><p>He had never allowed himself to give in to that impulse with her again. Hell, he hadn\u2019t even been aware of the hang-ups he\u2019d had regarding sex and relationships until Rogue.</p><p>But, after Elaina\u2019s death, he had promised himself he would never get involved again. It had been his fault that she had died. His investigation that had been compromised and had backlashed onto his wife. He had sworn he would never let it happen again. And now, it was doing just that. It was happening again. He was letting another woman get under his skin and in his heart.</p><p>Bracing his hands on the wall, he let the warm water cascade over his head and fought the need to stalk back into that damned bedroom and just take her. To draw those heated cries from her lips, to feel the fragile muscles of her pussy clenching around his dick as he drove into her. To possess her. God, he wanted all of her. Not just her body, but all those fierce emotions burning in her eyes. He ached for it, but he knew the price of taking it. It was a price he didn\u2019t think he could pay again.</p><p>The need had never been this hard to control. And he knew what it would lead to. Once he released his control to give in to one impulse, another would slam into him. Taking her against the wall, wild and uncontrolled, was nothing compared to the things he wanted to do to her. The ways he wanted to take her. Ways that only the most experienced and jaded of lovers had ever accepted.</p><p>Hell, he\u2019d never stressed over having sex with a woman before. He just fucked all night long when the need burned inside him and pushed back the desires he had restrained for so long.</p><p>He\u2019d never given a lover all of himself, so those desires had never tormented him for long.</p><p>How much of himself was he giving Rogue though? Because for the first time since he had moved back to Kentucky, those needs were slicing into him like the sharpest blade.</p><p>And for Zeke, that was damned unfamiliar and uncomfortable territory. He wasn\u2019t certain if he wanted to give a woman that much of himself. He\u2019d been self-contained for too long. He\u2019d restrained too much of himself for too many years; realizing how much was slipping free was enough to send a spark of sensation racing up his spine.</p><p>It also had the power to leave his cock fully erect and throbbing as well. He was harder than he had been the night before, so damned eager to fuck her again that he could barely force himself to remain in the shower.</p><p>God, he wanted her. Right here, right now. However he could have her. He wanted her in his arms, he wanted her warmth and he wanted the taste of her, her heat and softness surrounding him so damned bad he could almost feel her against his flesh.</p><p>He ached for her.</p><p>She was so damned young though, and so innocent. The innocence was killing him.</p><p>That dark lust inside him was pushing him, urging him to replace the innocence in her eyes with all the feminine knowledge of the pleasure he could give her. The extremities of passion. The dark lines between pleasure and pain that could fill her with sensations she couldn\u2019t imagine.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t quite BDSM. What he needed didn\u2019t cross those lines. It was a driven lust. A dark infusion of extreme pleasure and control-shattering hunger. It was hearing her scream his name because she needed to come so badly she was shaking apart from the tension. It was watching her eyes as he took her as she pleasured herself, or as he fucked that sweet little ass and filled her with a pleasure/pain that left her screaming.</p><p>It was leaving control behind and taking her against the wall, on a table, or better yet, his back deck while nature looked on. It was doing all the things with her that he had never allowed himself to do with a woman when he was involved in a relationship with them. It was being who and what he was when he had never allowed himself to do that with any other woman. And now, pulling back from Rogue was next to impossible.</p><p>Gritting his teeth, he grabbed the washcloth he had hung on the inside rack, soaped it, and put himself to showering rather than driving himself insane over a problem he couldn\u2019t fix at the moment.</p><p>He had enough to keep him busy; he didn\u2019t need to add to his problems. He had a meeting with the coroner and with Alex later in the afternoon, and his own reports to file. He didn\u2019t need the additional headache of wondering if his lover was too innocent for the dominant sex his tastes ran to.</p><p>He wanted to own her. That was his problem. Own her emotions, her heated response, and the fiery depths of her heart. And owning those parts of Rogue would never be easy. She would steal his soul. And the thought of that was enough to leave him stumbling amid his own emotions. It was enough to assure him he was getting in deep, perhaps too deep, and that walking away later may be next to impossible.</p><p>Rogue was pouring her first cup of coffee when Zeke strode from the bedroom, fully dressed in clean clothes. The sight of that official uniform conforming to his body sent a shiver up her spine. It wasn\u2019t just the effect of the clothes on his hard body, but the effect his masculine expression had on her insides. It made her heart pound, made her flesh feel too sensitive.</p><p>Her brow arched at the uniform he was wearing. \u201cYou came prepared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI keep an extra uniform in the Tahoe. I went down earlier and got it.\u201d He shrugged as he moved for the coffee cup. \u201cI have to be on duty in an hour. Are you working at the restaurant this evening?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI have two more days off from the restaurant. I have some things to clear away here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThings like Jonesy?\u201d he pressed.</p><p>Jonesy worried her, but she wouldn\u2019t tell Zeke that. There was something in the other man\u2019s attitude last night that warned her that her bartender was close to stepping over the line. He wanted Rogue away from Zeke, and she couldn\u2019t figure out why. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI told you, Zeke, Jonesy is my business,\u201d she warned him as she stared into his fierce, demanding gaze.</p><p>He was staring back at her as though he could force her to do as he wanted with nothing more than his eyes. And she had to admit, she almost wished she could give in to him. But she knew Jonesy, loved him like a brother. He had helped her when Nadine Grace and Dayle Mackay had tried to destroy her life. He had taught her how to fight; he had taught her how to be who she had always been meant to be.</p><p>\u201cZeke, keep your nose out of my business,\u201d she warned him as his gaze flickered with a dangerous glitter. She didn\u2019t doubt he was planning to confront Jonesy himself. \u201cI know how to handle things fine all by my little lonesome.\u201d</p> <p>Rogue almost laughed at the frustration and the hint of arousal in his expression. Her defiance was turning him on. She loved it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you do.\u201d He appeared to agree. Somehow she doubted he was as agreeable as he sounded. He looked damned pissed.</p><p>She watched him suspiciously.</p><p>\u201cPoke your nose in my business and I\u2019ll get pissed,\u201d she warned him. \u201cI\u2019m not very nice when I\u2019m pissed, Zeke.\u201d</p><p>He snorted at that. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m the one your casualties run crying to,\u201d he reminded her.</p> <p>\u201cHow many attempted lawsuits have you had this year so far for wrecking men in your bar?\u201d</p><p>She almost blushed. She was a bit prone to using her knee rather than cool reason. But in her own defense, cool reason didn\u2019t always work when a man was filled with drink and bravado.</p><p>\u201cNot a single one this year I\u2019ll have you know.\u201d She glared back at him. \u201cAnd if their mothers had taught them how to behave, then I wouldn\u2019t have to spank them, now would I?\u201d</p><p>His lips almost twitched into a smile. She could see him holding back his amusement, but it was there. She would have been offended if she didn\u2019t often find it funny herself.</p><p>He lifted his cup to his lips and sipped at the coffee; as he lowered it, the phone at his side rang imperatively. Rogue\u2019s gaze jerked to his hip, then to his thighs as she felt her breath tighten. Damn, he really was aroused, and the pants of his uniform did nothing to hide it.</p><p>Frowning, Zeke pulled the cell phone from its hip holster, checked the number, then flipped it open with a terse, \u201cHello.\u201d</p> <p>Something was wrong. Rogue felt it the moment his expression went hard, emotionless.</p><p>His gaze became flat, distant, and something dangerous flashed in his eyes as he listened to whatever was being said.</p><p>\u201cSecure the scene, I\u2019m on my way,\u201d he ordered.</p><p>His frown deepened. \u201cI don\u2019t give a damn what you think, Gene,\u201d he snapped. \u201cSecure the fucking scene and try not to compromise it any more than you can help.\u201d</p><p>Danger seemed to radiate from him. Somehow his body seemed harder now, almost more muscular, definitely ready for action.</p><p>Rogue watched as he flipped the phone closed, his gaze locking on hers as she felt her heart begin to race in her chest.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He moved to her, staring down at her with those hard, furious brown eyes.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s Grandmother Walker, Rogue,\u201d he said, his voice incredibly gentle as he reached out for her. \u201cLisa found her this morning. She\u2019s dead.\u201d</p><p>Grandmother Walker, it appeared, had known hergranddaughter was gone from the house on an errand, freed herself from her oxygen tank, moved from the bed, and attempted to take a bath. It appeared she had slipped while getting into the tub, fallen, and hit her head before sinking into the water.</p><p>Zeke watched as the coroner loaded the body into the official vehicle and drove away.</p><p>Forensics had dusted the house, but Zeke doubted they would find anything. There was nothing there to point to foul play, but still, the back of his neck was itching.</p><p>Rogue was with Lisa and Janey in Lisa\u2019s small living room, attempting to comfort her.</p><p>Lisa had taken her boys to their father again that morning. While she was gone, her grandmother had died.</p><p>He shook his head as he moved back into the house, silent, watchful as Gene talked to the forensics team as they packed up.</p><p>His deputy hadn\u2019t agreed with the forensic team\u2019s involvement, but this time, it had been Alex\u2019s call. The Walker home was within the Somerset city limits and Grandmother Walker had been a friend of Janey Mackay as well as Chief Alex Jansen.</p><p>The detective Alex had sent was a good one. Robert Leeson was no one\u2019s fool. With his dark hair and suspicious eyes, he was a damned fine detective. He\u2019d already talked to Lisa, collected the information he needed, and promised to keep Zeke apprised of anything they found.</p><p>Rogue and Janey had taken Lisa to her home after the detective had questioned her. She had been in shock, grieving, and confused. Her grandmother didn\u2019t even like baths, Lisa had stated. She showered. She couldn\u2019t imagine how or why the old woman would have decided to try to take a bath. Grandmother Walker had been ill, weak, but she hadn\u2019t been delusional or incapable of making a rational decision. The old woman had been stubborn as hell, but she wasn\u2019t stupid. So why had she decided to disconnect her oxygen and attempt to take a bath before her granddaughter returned?</p><p>First the Walker twins and now their grandmother. The back of his neck was itching like hell.</p><p>Zeke moved back to the small bedroom, stared around it slowly with narrowed eyes, and tried to figure out the knife edge of warning prodding at his guts.</p><p>There was no evidence of foul play, nothing to suggest that murder had been committed, other than the fact that Zeke\u2019s stomach was rioting and his neck was itching.</p><p>\u201cZeke, I\u2019m heading out unless you need me to stay longer.\u201d</p><p>Zeke turned to see Gene watching him somberly.</p><p>\u201cGo ahead.\u201d Zeke nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll catch up with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll leave my report on your desk before I go off duty.\u201d Gene nodded. \u201cToo damned bad about old lady Walker. She was a good woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, she was.\u201d Zeke sighed as he turned and stared around the room.</p><p>Hell. Just like Joe and Jaime, this didn\u2019t look right; it didn\u2019tfeel right.</p><p>Behind him, Gene sighed heavily and asked, \u201cDid you know Lisa had life insurance on her brothers and grandmother?\u201d</p><p>Zeke turned around slowly. \u201cWhere did you hear that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe took out the insurance here in town,\u201d Gene answered him. \u201cAubry Riley\u2019s agency.</p><p>It\u2019s not a huge amount, but there\u2019ll still be cash left over from the burials.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen did you find this out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYesterday evening Aubry came in after you left the office. He was telling me about the policies on the brothers then, and mentioned the one on the grandmother. Joe and Jaime took out their policies. They had survivorship on theirs. In the event of both their deaths though, Lisa was beneficiary. She\u2019s also the beneficiary on the policy her grandmother took out \u2019bout twenty years ago, after her husband\u2019s death.\u201d</p><p>Zeke rubbed at the back of his neck. \u201cI\u2019ll talk to Lisa and see if she\u2019ll turn over the policies.\u201d</p><p>Would Lisa have killed her brothers and grandmother for the insurance? Zeke had seen it happen before.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll head out then,\u201d Gene told him. \u201cSee you later, Zeke.\u201d</p><p>Zeke rubbed at his jaw as he turned back to the bedroom and focused his gaze on the oxygen tank, its lines hanging forlornly to the pillows of the bed.</p><p>Lisa didn\u2019t kill her brothers. She didn\u2019t kill her grandmother. Zeke could feel it, despite the evidence of the insurance policies and the attempts to make it look as though each death had an explanation. Someone had killed with such perfect precision that not even a trace of an intruder had been left behind.</p><p>As he stared around the room the cell phone at his belt beeped demandingly.</p><p>\u201cSheriff Mayes,\u201d he answered.</p><p>\u201cSheriff?\u201d Lisa Walker\u2019s voice came through the line, timid, husky with tears. \u201cI wanted to ask. Grandma mentioned calling you last night; she said she might have known who the girl was that Joe and Jaime were seeing. I wondered if you would tell me who it was?\u201d</p><p>Click. He felt it now. Like a piece of the puzzle falling into place.</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t call me, Lisa,\u201d he said calmly. \u201cShe didn\u2019t tell you who the girl was?\u201d</p><p>Lisa sighed. \u201cShe said she wanted to talk to you first, to be sure about something before she said anything more. You know how Grandma was about gossip.\u201d</p><p>She had hated gossip. She didn\u2019t gossip, and she didn\u2019t hesitate to berate anyone who came to her with idle talk. This time, Zeke wished she had gone back on those principles.</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t mention anything?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cShe said Joe had come to see her a few days before he was killed. He was laughing, said he and Jaime had a date Saturday night. Grandma was giving him hell over it and Joe told her that sharing what they loved was better than fighting over it and neither of them having it. It was the first time he\u2019d ever mentioned love in regard to a woman, she said. When she asked who it was, she said he wouldn\u2019t give her name, but he said something that made her suspect who it might be. She wouldn\u2019t tell me what he said.\u201d</p><p>She hadn\u2019t tried to call him, Zeke knew, but she might have called the office.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Sheriff.\u201d She sighed. \u201cI should have pushed her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it, Lisa,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you can though, could you bring the insurance policies you had on your grandma and brothers into my office? I\u2019ll need to go over this to make sure everything\u2019s taken care of on my end.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can bring them in tomorrow.\u201d There was no hesitation in her voice or her attitude. \u201cI need to get that taken care of anyway for the funerals.\u201d Her voice broke.</p><p>\u201cYes, you do, Lisa.\u201d He sighed. \u201cI\u2019ll see you tomorrow whenever you\u2019re ready. Just give me a call and let me know when you\u2019re coming in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will. Good-bye, Sheriff.\u201d She disconnected and Zeke folded the phone before placing it back in its holster and moving for the front door.</p><p>Lisa didn\u2019t kill her family for the insurance. Zeke had a feeling whoever had killed Joe and Jaime had done so because of a woman they were sharing, and now their grandmother was dead because she suspected who it was. Now Zeke had to figure out who it was before anyone else died.</p><p>THIRTEEN</p><p>Jonesy was back behind the long counter servingdrinks when Rogue stepped into the bar that evening. A scowl was etched into his face as he glared at her, but his brown eyes weren\u2019t filled with fury. She thanked God for that, because she didn\u2019t have the nerves to deal with another of his snits. He had never become rough with her in all the years she had known him, but she admitted he had spooked her a little the night before.</p><p>She gave him a sharp nod but kept her gaze cool before moving around the dance floor and checking with the bouncers. She\u2019d just spent the evening on the phone with her parents and grandparents to let them know about Grandmother Walker\u2019s death.</p><p>Her father had been saddened, but Rogue knew he wouldn\u2019t grieve for the woman he had once known. He worried more about her and the rash of Walker deaths now than he did anything else. He had begged, bribed, and ordered her to return to Boston. She had declined sweetly. At least as sweetly as possible as they screamed and yelled at each other over the phone.</p><p>It was how she got along with her father. Calvin Walker wasn\u2019t the most diplomatic of men. Tact wasn\u2019t a word in his vocabulary outside a courtroom. And Rogue admitted, she was too much like her father some days rather than her soft-spoken Bostonian mother.</p><p>It had put her in the perfect mood to make a meeting that a friend had called for after her discussion with her father though.</p><p>Timothy Cranston wasn\u2019t really a friend, she corrected herself. More of a friendly adversary. He didn\u2019t seem to really like anyone except Janey Mackay and Alex Jansen. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He more often seemed to only tolerate others. The Homeland Security suspended agent was a thorn in everyone else\u2019s side. But Rogue liked him. He was snarly and grouchy and rarely seemed to smile when it was appropriate. When he did smile, he tended to cause others to shudder in wariness.</p><p>Rogue didn\u2019t shudder; privately, she was usually laughing at others\u2019 reactions. Until now. Now she felt that little shiver of wariness herself.</p><p>She made her rounds of the bar, stopped, talked, and laughed with the customers. She bumped hips with the accountant from Virginia, shimmied around the mechanic that worked for Natches Mackay, and flashed a smile at Deputy Gene Maynard as he lifted his hand in hello from the bar.</p> <p>Jonesy was still scowling, but he was serving beer as he was supposed to be and keeping his hands to himself. She contented herself with that for the moment, though she knew she was going to have to discuss the night before with him.</p><p>Breathing out tiredly at the thought, she caught sight of Agent Cranston at a back table, hidden in a corner just off to the side of the pool tables that were set up in the large open room back from the dance floor.</p><p>He was nursing a beer; he wasn\u2019t really drinking it. His expression was composed, almost innocent. God, she wished she could perfect that expression herself. She had been trying for years and hadn\u2019t quite managed it.</p><p>Maybe it had something to do with the ill- fitting wrinkled suit or the thin hair falling over his brow. She knew there was something both compassionate and dangerous that lurked in his eyes. Something that warned a person not to consider crossing him, and yet invited trust. He was an odd little man, that was for damned sure.</p><p>\u201cCranston, you\u2019re going to make me nervous if you keep lurking in corners in my bar,\u201d</p> <p>she told him as she moved into the other side of the booth and motioned one of the waitresses for a beer.</p><p>He smiled pleasantly. \u201cI live to make people nervous. Keeps them from conspiring against me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, so that\u2019s your secret.\u201d She grinned back. \u201cSo what makes you believe you need to keep me from conspiring against you?\u201d</p><p>He grunted at that. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t think that for a moment. You\u2019re too honest to conspire, Ms. Walker. You\u2019d just kick my balls into my throat and laugh at my anguish if you wanted to strike out at me.\u201d</p><p>She smiled back at him approvingly. \u201cI do so enjoy an intelligent man, Agent Cranston.\u201d</p><p>His smile was smoother this time, more manipulating as he lifted his beer and sipped before asking. \u201cSo, is Sheriff Mayes as intelligent?\u201d</p> <p>What an interesting question.</p><p>Rogue leaned back in her seat as the waitress approached and set the chilled bottle of beer on the table in front of her. She continued to regard the agent as she sipped her own drink and wondered where the question had originated from.</p><p>\u201cSheriff Mayes is very intelligent,\u201d she finally answered him. \u201cFrom what I understand, he\u2019s a master of making certain the family jewels are well protected.\u201d</p><p>A wide smile creased Timothy\u2019s lips. \u201cAh, how very elusive your answer is. Tell me.\u201d</p><p>He tilted his head to the side as he regarded her. \u201cIs it true you\u2019re sleeping with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it true that it\u2019s none of your business?\u201d She opened her eyes wide and appeared a bit surprised that she had let the words pass her lips. \u201cForgive me, Agent Cranston, I\u2019m sure that was the bitch in me speaking. I try to contain her as often as possible.\u201d</p><p>He tipped his beer toward her in acknowledgment of her not-too-subtle hint that he had crossed the line.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a strong woman,\u201d he said as he leaned back in his seat and regarded her intently. \u201cI\u2019ve heard there are bets being placed that you\u2019ll be the first woman the sheriff has publicly claimed since his wife\u2019s death.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s about as much your business as whether or not I\u2019m sleeping with him,\u201d she pointed out. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you tell me what the hell you want, Agent Cranston, and let me get back to work.\u201d</p><p>His lips quirked at her demand. \u201cI\u2019m just a curious man, Rogue,\u201d he finally stated. \u201cAnd one that worries about supposedly unconnected threads. Did you know your cousins supplied information to Homeland Security in the operation that busted Nadine Grace and Dayle Mackay\u2019s little homegrown terrorist group?\u201d</p><p>Rogue stared back at him in surprise. \u201cNo,\u201d she said faintly. \u201cI didn\u2019t know that.\u201d</p><p>But it shouldn\u2019t have surprised her. Lazy and a little shiftless the boys might have been, but all in all, they\u2019d had a patriotic streak a mile wide. Jaime and Joe both had attempted to join the Army when they turned eighteen, but a lung defect that they had shared had kept them out of the service.</p><p>Cranston nodded as he leaned forward again and braced his arms on the table and asked, \u201cDo you think Joe killed Jaime, then himself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no evidence to suggest otherwise as far as I know,\u201d she stated.</p><p>\u201cAnd within days of their deaths their grandmother slips and falls attempting to take a bath?\u201d he questioned. \u201cIs that coincidence?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you care? Fine, you think Joe and Jaime were upstanding citizens for helping you once. That doesn\u2019t explain why you\u2019re going out of your way now, Agent Cranston, or what makes you think I have any information you could use. So why don\u2019t you get to the point while I still have some patience left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy point.\u201d He sighed. \u201cMy point is that I\u2019m worried now. Maybe we get didn\u2019t everyone Dayle was working with last year. The organization we disbanded didn\u2019t have lists of names to guide us to their members. We\u2019ve been shooting in the dark in rounding them up. I want to make sure all the loose ends have been tied.\u201d</p><p>That made more sense. Rogue had a feeling Agent Cranston wasn\u2019t the benevolent sort; having it confirmed at least eased some of the suspicion rising inside her, though it didn\u2019t touch the tension knotting her shoulders.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the wrong person to ask then,\u201d she told him. \u201cThe last I heard, Sheriff Mayes was investigating that case, not me.\u201d</p><p>His gaze flickered as another smile threatened to curl his lips.</p><p>\u201cSo he is.\u201d He nodded. \u201cBut men like to share things in the dark with their lovers. And you were related to the twins and their grandmother. I was hoping you could tell me more than he has.\u201d</p><p>She leaned forward, eyes narrowed as her gaze locked with his.</p><p>\u201cIf you want information, Agent Cranston, then go to the source. I\u2019ve never seen you as a man that likes to pussyfoot around anything; don\u2019t start playing that game now. And while you\u2019re at it, stop with the little innuendoes concerning your suspicions about my relationship with the sheriff. It\u2019s not your business, nor is it anyone else\u2019s. Now, if you have no further questions, I have a bar to run.\u201d</p><p>She rose to her feet, turned, and stepped into a hard male chest that blocked her way.</p><p>Damn her temper. Her eyes shot up to stare into Zeke\u2019s annoyed brown eyes as he stared over her head at the agent. If she had been paying more attention, she might have suspected he was there. She realized he must have been there for at least the latter part of the conversation because the agent\u2019s eyes had continually flicked over her shoulder as Cranston fought a smile.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d Pushing back from him she tried to still her heart rate, tried to still her hopes.</p><p>As Cranston had said, Zeke had never publicly claimed a woman. Had he come here for her or for more information?</p><p>His gaze flicked to hers. \u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t I be here?\u201d</p><p>Great, he was in one of his uncommunicative moods. Answering a question with another question, his gaze flat and hard, his expression honed and savage. She had a feeling he wasn\u2019t there to put his handcuffs to use again. At least, not in the way she would have preferred. Guess that answered the question of whether or not he was there to see her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll just let the two of you have your little male-bonding time then.\u201d She smiled back at him tightly. \u201cIf you wouldn\u2019t mind though, before you leave, I\u2019d like to know what you\u2019ve learned about Grandmother Walker. If you can find the time for me, that is.\u201d</p><p>His brow arched. She hated the arrogance in that smooth, practiced shift of his expression.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t come to talk to the rabid little leprechaun,\u201d he told her, referring to the nickname the Mackays had given the agent. \u201cI came to see you.\u201d</p><p>She was certain she didn\u2019t hide her surprise.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d She couldn\u2019t contain her surprise, either. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>His gaze heated, moved over her face, touched upon the smooth tops of her breasts that rose above the bodice of the bustier that she had paired with a thin violet silk blouse, a leather skirt that almost showed too much, and over-the-knee black leather boots.</p><p>The look in his eyes had heat flooding to her cheeks. For a second she could feel the handcuffs around her wrists again, his hard hands on her thighs as he held her legs apart, and the touch of his tongue at her clit.</p><p>Wet heat flooded her pussy, her clit swelled, and her nipples pressed demandingly against the lace of her bra.</p><p>\u201cGood-bye, Cranston.\u201d Zeke\u2019s voice was deeper, rougher as he settled his hand at the small of her back and he moved to her side. \u201cTell the Mackays I said hello.\u201d</p><p>The hand at her back prodded her to move ahead of him. Surprised, uncertain, Rogue allowed herself to be led toward the bar\u2019s exit before she turned to him with a frown.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t just leave, Zeke.\u201d She hadn\u2019t spent enough time there as it was. Working at the restaurant to help Janey out and then struggling to put in enough hours at the bar to keep it running smoothly had her stretched pretty thin for the past six months.</p><p>\u201cJonesy\u2019s still here,\u201d he growled. \u201cLeave a message with one of your bouncers that you\u2019ll check back in later. We need to talk.\u201d</p><p>The chill in his tone had her spine tingling with warning. Looking around, she caught sight of Ronnie, one of the older bouncers, and waved him to her.</p><p>\u201cLet Jonesy know I\u2019ll be out of the bar for a while,\u201d she told him. \u201cI don\u2019t know when I\u2019ll be back, but I want him in my office tomorrow at noon.\u201d</p><p>Ronnie nodded his dark head quickly, though his hazel eyes were suspicious as he glanced at Zeke. \u201cI\u2019ll let him know, Miss Walker.\u201d</p><p>Zeke caught her hand then, twined his fingers with hers, and led her out into the night.</p><p>The feel of his hand holding hers did things to her that she didn\u2019t want to delve too deeply into. She felt a band of emotion tightening around her heart and a fragile flame of hope burning within her.</p><p>He had come to the bar for her. He had taken her out of the bar while damned near every customer in the building had watched them.</p><p>\u201cYou can be arrogant, you know,\u201d she told him as the hollow sound of her heels clicked against the paved parking lot.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d he drawled. \u201cAnd here I thought I was being amazingly considerate. After all, I didn\u2019t throw you over my shoulder this time.\u201d</p><p>Her stomach tightened, her breasts felt fuller, swollen and sensitive at the implication in his tone.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t just go running off whenever you\u2019re in the mood to drag me out of the bar, Zeke,\u201d she couldn\u2019t help but to argue. \u201cDo I interrupt your day like this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust on a regular basis,\u201d he grunted as she caught sight of the big red pickup he drove parked at the edge of the lot.</p><p>\u201cIn your dreams,\u201d she retorted. \u201cTomorrow, I\u2019m showing up at your office, locking the door, and interrupting you. You\u2019ll see what I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll see what my desk feels like against your naked back,\u201d he said, his voice rougher as he pulled her around and pressed her against his truck. \u201cDamn you, Rogue, one damned taste of you and you\u2019re like a fucking narcotic I can\u2019t get enough of.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His head lowered, his lips shocked hers, parted them, and made room for his tongue to slip past.</p><p>Holding on to him now was all that mattered. Her fingers gripped his head, her lips moved beneath his, her heart raced in her chest.</p><p>What was it about him? What made her crave him to the point that nothing mattered but his kiss, his touch? She had missed him, she\u2019d ached for him. She hadn\u2019t realized how much she needed the comfort of his touch until he was there, holding her, his hands on her ass, lifting her against his chest as her arms wrapped around his neck.</p> <p>\u201cZeke,\u201d she whispered his name, desperation clawing at her as his lips moved from hers to her neck. They caressed as his evening beard scraped against the flesh just under her jaw.</p><p>His teeth nipped at her, his tongue licked.</p><p>\u201cI need you.\u201d She let her tongue flicker over his ear as her legs bent to grip his thighs, her skirt lifting, her sex cushioning the heavy impression of his cock beneath his jeans.</p><p>\u201cDamn you.\u201d His fingers threaded in her hair, tugged, and sent heated fingers of sensation to curl over her scalp as he pulled her head back.</p><p>His lips met hers again. His kiss was hungry, devouring. It worked over her lips as his tongue stroked past them, thrusting against hers before retreating, only to return again.</p> <p>It was a hungry, desperate kiss. It was a kiss that fed the hope inside her, a hope that had been so fragile she had refused to even acknowledge it. A hope this need he had for her was more than physical. That emotion fueled him just as much as lust. That he might care for her. That he might need her in the ways she needed him.</p><p>Admitting she was falling in love with him wasn\u2019t easy. Letting herself acknowledge that she no longer had control over those emotions was frightening.</p><p>Almost as frightening as realizing she had no control over her response to him. She was losing herself in his touch, in his kiss, in his hunger for her. Losing herself to the point that he could take her right there, under the lights that blazed overhead, against the warm metal of his pickup truck, and she wouldn\u2019t offer the first protest. She would revel in the pleasure and the heat he filled her with instead.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re stealing my mind,\u201d he groaned as his lips lifted. She tried to follow, tried to retain the hunger and need she could feel pouring out of him.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t given you permission to stop,\u201d she whimpered. \u201cCome back here.\u201d</p><p>She received a rough chuckle in reply, but still he steadied her back on her feet before shifting away from her.</p> <p>Damn him. She wanted more than one of his little tease-fests.</p><p>\u201cCome on, get in.\u201d He opened the passenger side door and lifted her into the seat before she could attempt to navigate the running board that ran down the side of the cab.</p><p>\u201cWhere am I going?\u201d Her lips quirked as she stared back at him, amazed once again that somehow, there was something developing between them. She wasn\u2019t certain what it was, but it was something. Something more than sex, but perhaps something less than emotion.</p><p>\u201cFor a ride.\u201d He reached out, touched her cheek with his fingertips, and caressed the line of her jaw with his thumb. \u201cWe need to talk.\u201d</p><p>He backed away before she could reply, shifted her legs into the truck, then closed the door, all without saying another word.</p><p>Rogue blew out a hard breath as she watched him move around the front of the truck.</p><p>Hard-bodied, graceful in that predatory kind of way, dressed in jeans, a dark cotton shirt, and boots. Damn, he made her mouth water. He made her heart ache.</p><p>He made her realize all the dreams she had never known she had. Dreams of being more to him perhaps than just his current little pillow mate.</p> <p>Which was amazingly funny actually. It wasn\u2019t as though he had so much as taken her out to a burger joint, let alone anything resembling something as public as a date. God forbid he would do anything so juvenile at his age.</p><p>\u201cThat look on your face is scary,\u201d he told her as he opened his door and lifted himself into the driver\u2019s seat before turning his head to stare at her as he pushed the key into the ignition and started the motor.</p><p>\u201cScary?\u201d she asked with a smile. \u201cHow do you define scary, Sheriff Mayes?\u201d</p><p>He grunted at that. \u201cEqual parts feminine charm and sheer calculation. I saw that same look on your face before you broke Bobby Joe Wingate\u2019s nose last year at the local fair.\u201d</p><p>Shehad broken Bobby Joe\u2019s nose. \u201cThere was no proof I broke his nose,\u201d she still reminded him. \u201cHe buried his face in the cement; I didn\u2019t put it there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it was your cute little fist that plowed into it though,\u201d he chuckled as he pulled out of the parking lot. \u201cI was there, remember? I heard the crunch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd here you didn\u2019t arrest me?\u201d</p><p>Bobby Joe Wingate liked to tease and torment those much younger than himself. The twenty-three-year-old college dropout had been picking on a thirteen-year-old child whose father had been arrested on suspicion of terrorism.</p><p>The child had been unaware of the reason for her father\u2019s arrest until Bobby Joe had begun spouting accusations at her and her uncle. Rogue had hit before she had thought.</p><p>And as Zeke said, he had been there. He had come up as Bobby Joe had hit the cement, jerked him up, and rushed him away from the crowd before someone had ended up dead. Likely Bobby Joe, because if he had tried to strike back at Rogue, the six bikers with her would have ripped his head off and used his guts to strangle him.</p><p>\u201cThe girl\u2019s uncle found me and told me what was going on,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you hadn\u2019t hit him, I would have. I hit harder.\u201d</p><p>Rogue let a smile curl her lips at that. Yeah, Zeke could hit harder. She\u2019d had the supreme pleasure of seeing him do just that a time or two when he had been called to the bar when things became a little too rough during a conflict or two between customers and bouncers.</p><p>\u201cSo, you took me out tonight to discuss Bobby Joe Wingate?\u201d</p><p>He was driving through town, his eyes on the traffic as he headed toward the heavily forested city limits. Out of town. She watched as the city lights disappeared and the headlights of the truck picked up the black ribbon of the road winding through the mountain.</p><p>\u201cBobby Joe wasn\u2019t high on my list of discussion topics,\u201d he finally admitted as he signaled and turned from the main road onto a county road that led deeper into the mountains.</p><p>\u201cThen what is high on your list of priorities?\u201d she asked, smoothing her hand over the short length of her skirt as they drove deeper into the mountains.</p><p>\u201cYou.\u201d</p><p>That effectively shut her up, for the moment.</p><p>Zeke pulled the pickup into a clearing next to the lake several minutes later. The rays of a full moon glistened across the water as it lapped at the large rocks that had been set along the bank.</p><p>He stared out the windshield, too aware of Rogue sitting in the seat beside him, too aware of all the things he wanted from her.</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019m topping your list of priorities tonight, huh?\u201d she finally asked. \u201cI have to admit, Zeke, I\u2019m a little surprised. I haven\u2019t been your priority before now.\u201d</p><p>Her voice just did things to him. It was smooth, melodic; it was a breath of summer heat and a reminder of the sweet sound of her cries as she came around him. It made him fucking hard. It made him want to fuck her, right there, right then.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been my priority longer than you can imagine.\u201d He continued to stare out at the water, scowling at the truth of that statement.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Suspicion filled her voice. \u201cDamn, you sure had me fooled, Zeke. I guess all those rejections were just your way of making a pass?\u201d</p><p>He glanced over at her. \u201cSmart-ass.\u201d</p><p>Flashing that wicked smile of hers, she brushed back the long red gold curls that fell over her shoulder and turned more fully to him as she released her seat belt.</p><p>She crossed one leg over the other, those damned erotic boots making him crazy with the thought of them wrapped around his back. The leather cupped her knees, skimmed down her legs, and enfolded her feet until the four-inch heels drew his gaze.</p><p>Four-inch heels. Thin, stiletto heels.</p><p>The toe of her boot tapped against the floor of the truck and she stared back at him, obviously expectantly. The part that worried him was that she wasn\u2019t responding to the teasing little name he had called her.</p><p>She was watching him with those odd eyes of hers, a pure violet, not quite blue, not quite purple. Eyes that threatened to mesmerize him. Threatened to strip his control and make him forget exactly why he had brought her here.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t to enjoy how the moonlight made her eyes appear more violet, or how her skin glistened in the shimmering rays. Hell. He was turning fucking poetic. Son of a bitch, he wanted to fuck her until his balls felt on fire from the need. There, that wasn\u2019t the least bit poetic.</p><p>Shit.</p><p>He was reaching for her. He wasn\u2019t even aware he was reaching for her until his hand was curving around her neck.</p><p>Control. He\u2019d always known control, he\u2019d always known his own sense of self and how to rein in the needs, the hungers that tempted him.</p><p>Until Rogue.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to hurt you.\u201d His hand flexed against her nape, his fingertips stroking the soft flesh he found there.</p><p>\u201cHurt me?\u201d Her head tilted, her neck curving into his grip as that smile tempted him.</p><p>\u201cAre you afraid of breaking my heart, Zeke?\u201d There was a hint of amusement in her voice now. \u201cOr your own?\u201d</p><p>His hand tightened on her nape.</p><p>\u201cI want you to leave Somerset.\u201d His voice was harder than he had intended, a strange, burning anger rising inside him as she stared back at him, composed, her lips tilted into that mocking grin as her eyes gleamed with anger.</p><p>\u201cYou want me to leave Somerset.\u201d Her neck flexed beneath his hold as a light, scoffing little laugh left her lips. \u201cNow why doesn\u2019t that surprise me? What\u2019s wrong, Zeke, can\u2019t the big, bad sheriff handle the hard-on he\u2019s packing in his jeans for the town whore?\u201d</p><p>She leaned closer. \u201cOr is that the problem? It\u2019s just for the town whore?\u201d</p><p>Fury flashed through him. \u201cCall yourself that again, Rogue, and I might show you exactly why I keep trying to protect you. You don\u2019t want to push that limit.\u201d</p><p>Her smile was as old as time itself, as knowing as pure erotic sin.</p><p>He sat still as she moved. As she slid over him like satin silk, those leather legs straddling his thighs, the damp heat of her pussy settling over the denim-covered length of his tortured cock.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d saybwok-bwok , but I think you need a more direct approach.\u201d She breathed against his lips. \u201cI have no fear, Sheriff, because you know what I know?\u201d</p><p>His hands slid to her hips; his fingers pressed into the leather-covered flesh.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she crooned, \u201cthe big, bad sheriff is all talk and no action. Sheriff Mayes, you\u2019re chicken. One big hard-on-packing coward when it comes to something more than a quick little fuck in the dark. You don\u2019t have the guts to give more of yourself than that, and we both know it.\u201d</p><p>FOURTEEN</p><p>A hard-on-packing coward!</p><p>His hand slid to her neck, then into her hair. His fingers fisted into the curls and the dominance inside him broke loose. He lost control, and for the first time in his life he didn\u2019t even attempt to pull it back or attempt to soften it.</p><p>A hard smile pulled at his lips instead.</p><p>\u201cRemember, Rogue, you made the dare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a dare. It\u2019s the truth,\u201d she charged relentlessly. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Zeke, afraid I don\u2019t tame as easily as your other women?\u201d</p><p>He hoped to hell she didn\u2019t, because he was damned if tame was what he wanted.</p><p>Her head tipped back as he pulled at her hair, a firm tug that tilted her chin and placed her lips in the perfect position for his kiss.</p><p>Fighting his needs had never been so hard. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cTaming you isn\u2019t what I had in mind,\u201d he growled, his head lowering, his body tight as he fought not to take what he wanted.</p><p>\u201cTaming me is impossible.\u201d She nipped his lips; she broke his control.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t fight it, hungers hidden for so many years and the force of his lust slammed inside him, rocking him to his core.</p><p>The taste of her lips beneath his was imperative at this point. Silken soft and meeting him hunger for hunger, Rogue lifted against him, her arms wrapping around his neck, her fingers digging into his scalp.</p><p>This was what he craved.</p><p>His hand fisted in her hair to pull her head back further, his senses gloried in her moan as her kiss became hotter, wilder.</p><p>Hell, he hadn\u2019t fucked in a vehicle since he was sixteen years old, but the thought of not touching her for the length of time it would take to get to his home, or her apartment, was abhorrent.</p><p>Taking the edge off the lust thundering through his veins was imperative.</p><p>Touching as much of her as possible was an addiction, an instinct that he couldn\u2019t deny any longer.</p><p>Shoving her skirt to her hips, his hands gripped her ass, moving her, forcing her to ride the hard ridge of his cock as it pressed against her hot pussy.</p><p>He knew her taste. He knew the tight grip of her around his cock. He knew he would never get enough of her.</p><p>Rogue clenched her thighs around Zeke\u2019s, heard her own fragile cry as it echoed around her. Nothing mattered but Zeke\u2019s touch.</p><p>Arching her back, she pressed closer to his body, feeling his erection press tighter between her thighs. The blood was thundering through her veins as she rubbed her clit against his denim-covered cock. The tight knot of nerves was agonizingly sensitive, radiating with sensation.</p><p>\u201cBeautiful girl,\u201d he growled as his lips pulled back before he nipped at her lips.</p><p>\u201cBeautiful, sweet Rogue.\u201d</p><p>Rough, dark with lust, his voice stroked over her senses and left her shuddering with the needs rising inside her. His hands gripped the bare flesh of her rear, guided her movements as she rocked over him.</p><p>She needed more. Needed him inside her, stretching her, filling her.</p><p>\u201cPatience, baby,\u201d he crooned, his teeth raking over her neck as she panted for breath.</p><p>If he didn\u2019t do something soon, if he didn\u2019t ease the agony rising inside her, then she was going to end up screaming in need.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t used to this yet. The hunger and the need. It was unfamiliar, it was lightning sizzling across her flesh and striking at the tight bud of her clit.</p><p>\u201cPatience isn\u2019t my name,\u201d she groaned, her hands gripping the edges of his shirt and pulling.</p><p>Buttons flew, popped out of their moorings, and the material parted, revealing the warm, hair-spattered planes of his broad chest.</p> <p>This was what she needed. Arching her back Rogue pressed her hands into his chest, feeling the muscles tighten, flex.</p><p>She was drunk on him. The taste of him on her lips, his hard body against hers, it was more intoxicating than whisky.</p><p>\u201cThere, sweetheart.\u201d His voice wrapped around her, another caress, a stroke of sound that had her shivering as his fingertips stroked the cleft of her butt.</p><p>Oh God, how was she supposed to ever deny herself this? She needed him. She needed this. The only way a woman could ever hold this man. With her body. She would worry about holding his heart later, for now, nothing mattered but his touch.</p><p>His fingers gripped the cheeks of her ass, parted them farther, and sent a shard of sensation tugging at the forbidden entrance to her lower body. She could feel the juices easing from her pussy as she writhed against him, trying to press closer to his erection.</p><p>\u201cI need you,\u201d she cried breathlessly, struggling as his hands moved from her ass to her hips. \u201cNow, Zeke. Take me now.\u201d</p><p>A low, wicked chuckle met her demand, and a second later she felt his palm caress over her bare ass before it lifted, then fell in a heated little slap that sent heated pleasure tearing through her.</p><p>Her clit throbbed, her pussy clenched in need.</p><p>\u201cMore,\u201d she demanded.</p><p>She wanted to feel it again.</p><p>Zeke tensed against her.</p><p>\u201cLike that, do you, baby?\u201d His hand fell again, the heat burned hotter.</p><p>Her hips rolled, thighs clenched. Tipping her head back, she fought to breathe as his hand landed again, then again, stroking the burn beginning to bloom in her ass.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing to me?\u201d She couldn\u2019t catch her breath; she couldn\u2019t fight against the lust that continued to build inside her.</p><p>No, it wasn\u2019t just lust. It was something deeper, something hotter.</p><p>\u201cEverything.\u201d One hand tangled in her hair holding her in place as his lips descended again, stealing hers.</p><p>He didn\u2019t ask for the kiss; he owned it, just as he owned her response. His tongue slid inside, stroking against hers, thrusting between her lips as his hips lifted, pressing his cock tighter against her sex. His hips rolled, thrust. His tongue stroked and plunged as he moved, turning her as he lifted his own body and bearing her down along the bench seat, coming over her, surrounding her.</p><p>It was wicked and erotic. Moonlight spilled into the cab of the truck as she felt her panties being ripped away from her body.</p><p>A second later the corset she wore over the silk blouse fell away and the buttons were released on the blouse. The edges spread away from her breasts.</p><p>Rogue stared up at Zeke, her breathing hard and heavy. His expression was savagely hewn. The flesh was stretched tight over his cheekbones as his gaze took in the hard rise and fall of her breasts.</p><p>As he watched the hard-tipped mounds, his hands went to his belt. Rogue swallowed tightly as the belt was undone, then the snap and the zipper.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t bring a condom.\u201d He finally grimaced as he eased the heavy length of his cock free of his jeans.</p><p>She stared at the heavily veined flesh. The crest was dark and flushed, a sheen of moisture glistening on it as his big hand stroked the erect flesh.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need a condom.\u201d She was protected. And she wanted him like this. She wanted him bare and hot, intimate.</p><p>\u201cThis is dangerous, baby.\u201d His eyes roved over her possessively, finally falling to her legs. They were splayed over this thighs as he knelt on one knee before her, his other foot braced on the floor of the truck. \u201cI haven\u2019t taken a woman, until you, without a condom since my marriage.\u201d</p><p>Rogue licked her lips nervously. Not since his marriage. He hadn\u2019t been like this with another woman. The thought sent a surge of hope, of possessiveness tearing through her when she had promised herself she wouldn\u2019t let either emotion take root inside her.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay, I didn\u2019t mind being your first.\u201d She grinned back at him as her palms pressed against his hard abdomen, then slid lower. \u201cDon\u2019t be nervous, Sheriff, I promise it won\u2019t hurt.\u201d</p><p>His surprised chuckle had her smile widening as she fought to breathe through the pleasure wrapping around her.</p><p>The smile faltered though as his hand suddenly cupped the heated, slick flesh between her thighs. Her back arched. She trembled as his fingertips parted the swollen folds and found the convulsing entrance to her sex.</p><p>\u201cDamn, you\u2019re so wet,\u201d he groaned, a flush mantling his cheekbones.</p><p>Electric, destructive. Sensation tore through her body, arching her to him as one finger pierced her, pressed inside, and stroked the tender tissue flexing around his finger.</p><p>\u201cOh God, Zeke, don\u2019t tease me,\u201d she cried, her hips twisting against the penetration.</p><p>Erotic, blazing heat consumed her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to tease you,\u201d he crooned. \u201cI\u2019m going to fuck you, Rogue. Is that what you want, sweetheart? My cock stretching that sweet pussy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDuh!\u201d she breathed out hoarsely. \u201cGod, Zeke, you\u2019re killing me.\u201d</p><p>A tight smile curled his lips as he pulled his finger back, then pressed back, hard and deep as the pad of his palm ground against her clit.</p><p>Oh hell, she was going to come apart. She could feel the shudders racing through her, destroying any control she might have thought to have as she felt her juices spilling around his finger.</p><p>He pulled back again, retreating fully from her before returning, this time with two fingers. The added sensation had her hand gripping his wrist as she stared up at him, her lips parting as pleasure surged through her.</p><p>\u201cDamn, I love watching your face while I touch you,\u201d he breathed out, his voice tight.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready to come for me, sweetheart?\u201d</p><p>Pulsing, ecstatic tremors raced over her flesh as his fingers thrust inside her, twisted, stroked, and sent curling, lightning-sharp spikes of pleasure tearing through her.</p><p>She ached, she burned.</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d Her head thrashed against the leather seat. \u201cZeke, please, I can\u2019t stand this.\u201d</p><p>It was too much; it wasn\u2019t enough. Her pussy clenched on his fingers, her clit throbbed.</p><p>Sensation swirled and struck with brutal pleasure, and more of her silken juices spilled onto Zeke\u2019s fingers as her chest tightened at the emotions tearing through her.</p><p>Staring into his eyes, she watched him grimace, watched his gaze become heavy, his expression twisting with emotions she couldn\u2019t decipher. But she saw the pleasure in his eyes. She saw the desperate lust, and she saw a painful need that struck an answering chord inside her.</p><p>There was a restlessness in his eyes, a flame that wouldn\u2019t be doused. She knew, because she felt it in her own soul.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to fuck me or tease me to death, Sheriff?\u201d she drawled breathlessly, teasingly as she let a hand stroke over his as he gripped the thick stalk of his erection.</p><p>Her fingers trailed lower, her thumb caressing over the ultrasensitive head of his cock, and she smiled as it flexed beneath her touch.</p><p>\u201cTouch yourself.\u201d His voice hardened. \u201cStroke your clit. I want to feel you coming against my fingers.\u201d</p><p>Her lashes drifted over her eyes as weakening need and pleasure surged hard and fast inside her.</p><p>Memories, she reminded herself as her other hand moved slowly, touching her stomach first, then trailing to the sensitive mound of her pussy.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he breathed out, his voice rasping in his throat. \u201cLet me watch you, Rogue.</p><p>Show me how you pleasure yourself when you think of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo certain I\u2019m thinking of you?\u201d she questioned a second before her breath caught.</p><p>His fingers pushed inside her, thrusting hard and deep as her fingers glanced over her clit.</p><p>\u201cI know you think of me,\u201d he stated harshly. \u201cI know, Rogue, because I think of you.</p><p>When I\u2019m alone in my bed jacking off, it\u2019s your face I see, your touch I feel.\u201d</p><p>Her sex spasmed, her womb clenched, the surge of sensation like a punch of pleasure to her system. The explicit words were sexier, more erotic than she had ever imagined they would be.</p><p>\u201cDamn, look how sweet,\u201d he crooned as she stroked her clit. \u201cYou make my mouth water for a taste of your sweet pussy, Rogue. You make me ache for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen take it.\u201d Her thumb stroked over the head of his cock as she felt a small bead of dampness form there. \u201cTake me, Zeke. Don\u2019t you know I belong to you?\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t hide from him. She couldn\u2019t stop the words from spilling from her lips. She did belong to him. Just as in her heart, he belonged to her as well.</p><p>\u201cDamn you.\u201d He came over her, his big body blotting out the light of the moon.</p><p>His lips caught one tight, hard nipple between them and sucked it into his mouth as he tucked the head of his cock against her entrance. One hand gripped her hip, the other brushed her fingers away before he caught her wrist and drew it over her head.</p><p>Holding her hand to the seat he pushed his other hand beneath her rear, lifted her, and surged inside.</p><p>Heat slammed through her vagina. A stroke of pure, carnal sensation burned through her body as she arched her back and cried out his name.</p><p>She was stretching for him; brutal pleasure was whipping through the nerve endings just under the flesh that surrounded the thick flesh he had pushed into her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Pulling back, he paused, his tongue lashing at her nipple before he heaved inside her, pushing deeper, stretching her farther.</p><p>Rogue felt the fingers of her free hand latch onto the side of the seat, nails digging into the leather as she wrapped her legs around his back and lifted closer. She wanted all of him inside her. She wanted to hold him there for eternity and never know a moment that he didn\u2019t fill her.</p><p>She wanted him just like this, out of control, surging inside her hard and fast, his breath as broken and choppy as her own. It was different than it had been last night. This time, it was stronger, the passion and the hunger ran deeper, more imperative than it had that first time.</p> <p>It was what she needed. What she wanted. Rougher, harder, a man taking his woman.</p><p>Making her his.</p><p>\u201cHold on to me,\u201d he snarled, lifting his head from her breast, his brown eyes glittering with desperate, raging hunger before his head lowered to the other nipple. \u201cHold me, Rogue.\u201d</p><p>His lips covered the tight peak, sucked it in, sending pulses of ecstatic pleasure racing from her nipple to her clit and beyond. Flames were burning across her flesh; her chest was tight, not just with the pleasure, but with something that went much deeper, that tied her emotions into knots and assured her there was no escaping this need for a man that seemed to almost regret his hunger for her.</p><p>\u201cHold me, Rogue.\u201d It was an order, it wasn\u2019t a request.</p> <p>Hold him. She needed to hold him. He released her wrist as she loosened her fingers from the seat. Both arms wrapped around him as he slid one hand beneath her rear, his fingers tucking into the cleft there to find the ultrasensitive little portal they hid.</p><p>Rogue was flying on sensation. Breath suspended, every muscle tight, clenching in pleasure as he began to fuck her with deep, hard strokes.</p><p>His fingers caressed her rear entrance. He drew the moisture from her pussy back, rubbed against the sensitive opening, and sent her senses spinning.</p><p>His hips moved faster, harder. His fingers caressed, pressed, eased the nerve endings at her rear, and then pressed inside her, opening her, stretching her as she felt the world explode and dissolve around her.</p><p>The orgasm, when it hit, was like a cataclysm. It raced through her, shattered her with sensation and then with emotion as he cried her name, buried his face in her neck, and began to ejaculate, hot and fierce inside the tight grip of her body.</p><p>She felt him, the pulse and throb of his erection, the wet heat of his release, and the fierce kiss he laid at the bend of her shoulder.</p> <p>She felt him holding her, felt him surrounding her, his arms tight, his muscles clenched, his erection jerking inside her.</p><p>He had lost control. She sensed it, she felt it. His dominant, possessive touch, the muted groan of her name, the violent tension that radiated through his body as he spilled his release. It hadn\u2019t been like that the first time. It hadn\u2019t been wild and untamed, it had been focused and controlled.</p><p>Rogue decided she was going to have to see about breaking his control a little more often.</p><p>Zeke pulled the truck into the parking lot at the back of the bar and cut the ignition silently. He was aware of Rogue watching him, the frown at her brow and the tension that had been steadily rising between them since he had fixed their clothes earlier and left the lake.</p><p>He\u2019d taken her there to talk, not to fuck. But she was like a drug; once he touched her, he had to have more. The more he had, the more he wanted. It was a vicious cycle that threatened to destroy his mind.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to tell me why you\u2019re acting like a jackass, Zeke?\u201d she finally asked curiously. \u201cOr do I have to start guessing?\u201d</p><p>He almost smiled. Damn her, she wasn\u2019t supposed to make him laugh.</p><p>\u201cWhat would you guess?\u201d He looked over at her, realizing he was genuinely curious as to what her answer would be.</p> <p>Fiery, mussed ringlets of hair fell over her shoulder as her violet eyes went over him slowly. She was silent, thoughtful for long moments.</p><p>\u201cA lousy marriage would be too easy.\u201d She finally sighed. \u201cYou\u2019re mysterious, secretive. I\u2019m betting even your wife didn\u2019t know the real you.\u201d</p><p>He shouldn\u2019t have been surprised by her insight.</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t want to know the real me,\u201d he finally said wryly. \u201cWomen want the fantasy, Rogue. It\u2019s what my wife wanted, it\u2019s what my lovers have wanted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you say it\u2019s what I want, then I might have to hit you, Zeke.\u201d Her eyes narrowed on him. \u201cI didn\u2019t wait five years to lose my virginity to you so you could give me some kind of song and dance about how you can\u2019t be whatever the hell it is you think I want.</p><p>So save it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did you wait five years to lose your virginity to me?\u201d He\u2019d kept that question silent, but now, Zeke found, he needed the answer to it. \u201cYou could have any lover you wanted, Rogue. Why wait?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m a fool?\u201d She stared back at him, her eyes flashing with a glimmer of anger.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you wait five years to take my virginity, Zeke?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, there\u2019s a question.\u201d He gave his head a quick jerk. \u201cBecause I knew you were trouble the first second I set eyes on you. All prim and proper in your schoolteacher clothes, your pretty lips unsmiling, but those eyes.\u201d He chuckled. \u201cYou snuck a peek at my crotch right there in the middle of that damned town hall meeting.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t deny it. \u201cYou have some fine- looking goods, Sheriff.\u201d She laughed. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t answer my question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust as you didn\u2019t answer mine,\u201d he pointed out.</p><p>She shrugged at that as she turned her head away for long moments. \u201cCall it instinct,\u201d</p><p>she finally said, turning back to look at him. \u201cI knew you could satisfy me. Your turn.\u201d</p><p>Oh, there was more. She thought she was in love with him. Zeke could see it in her eyes.</p><p>He wondered how long it would take her to realize that love was no more than a carefully contrived deception.</p><p>But she wanted answers, and they were answers he knew would hurt her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re temptation,\u201d he finally answered her. \u201cYoung, wild, sweet. Every dirty old man\u2019s fantasy.\u201d</p><p>She seemed to flinch. \u201cOh, so I\u2019m your midlife crisis? I wonder what that makes Janey to Alex. You are so full of crap, Zeke.\u201d</p><p>He snorted at that. \u201cAlex doesn\u2019t come with the same baggage I come with, Rogue,\u201d he told her, shaking his head. \u201cYou\u2019re young, and you\u2019re innocent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you want to tie me down and fuck my ass until I\u2019m screaming for mercy,\u201d she drawled. \u201cYou want me blindfolded, spanked, and insane from wanting you. You want to get nasty with me, Sheriff, and you\u2019re terrified of losing all that perfect control of yours.\u201d</p><p>He snapped his teeth together, his hands clenched the steering wheel, and he fought to keep the vision of those acts out of his head. If he didn\u2019t think about them, they wouldn\u2019t torment him nearly as much.</p><p>She leaned closer. \u201cYou want to get rough and wild with me, Zeke. So bad it\u2019s like a hunger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you finished yet?\u201d He kept his expression hard, unemotional. He\u2019d managed to keep his control for years now, he wasn\u2019t going to let go now.</p><p>She stared back at him for long moments before something resembling resignation flashed in her eyes. \u201cYes, I\u2019m finished now,\u201d she finally said. \u201cDon\u2019t bother seeing me upstairs. I know the way.\u201d She reached for the door handle.</p><p>\u201cRogue. I didn\u2019t take you out to fuck you tonight. I need to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been talking.\u201d Her eyes were filled with shadows now, with pain. \u201cWhat more is there to say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis investigation into the twins\u2019 deaths, and their grandmother\u2019s,\u201d he stated. \u201cI called Lisa this evening and convinced her to go stay with her aunt in Louisville. I want you to leave town for a while as well. Until I figure out what the hell is going on. Until it\u2019s safe.\u201d</p><p>She was still, silent. Zeke stared back at her, watching as what he said sank into that quick little mind of hers.</p><p>\u201cYou think someone is killing Walkers?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI think Joe and Jaime were messing with the wrong girl,\u201d he told her. \u201cI believe their grandmother was killed because she might have known who that girl was. Joe and Jaime kept her a secret for the most part, but Grandmother Walker thought she might have known who the girl was. She told Lisa she was trying to contact me to tell me who it was, but she died before she could get ahold of me. You and Lisa were close to the twins. Someone could be afraid you might remember who the girl was as well.\u201d</p><p>Someone could kill her. Zeke hadn\u2019t forgotten what it felt like six months ago, staring down at her unconscious form in a hospital bed after she had been attacked over something someone was afraid she knew. He couldn\u2019t imagine it happening again, or worse, finding her dead.</p><p>\u201cSo you want me to leave town for my own good?\u201d she questioned him carefully.</p><p>\u201cGo home to Boston,\u201d he told her. \u201cYou weren\u2019t meant to put up with the bullshit you\u2019ve put up with here. See what it feels like to be Caitlyn Walker again rather than the rebel Rogue. I have a feeling you might like it more than you think you will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, you think I should just walk away? Just forget about my home, my bar, and my friends?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re home is a trashy little apartment over a bar full of thieves and drunks,\u201d he ground out between clenched teeth. \u201cYour friends consist of Janey Mackay and her family, and it took you years to let down your guard enough to accept them as friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about you?\u201d she whispered. \u201cWe were friends once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were never friends, Rogue,\u201d he snapped. \u201cI was the one man that didn\u2019t stand up and beg for a treat whenever you were near. I was a challenge. Now we\u2019ve both had our fun, it\u2019s time to face reality. You\u2019re in danger here. Fucking go home before it\u2019s too late to realize where you belong and you\u2019re dead.\u201d</p><p>Rogue stared back at him for long, silent moments. No tears filled her eyes, no pain creased her face. Bitterness flashed in her violet gaze though as she seemed to straighten her shoulders and stared back at him relentlessly.</p><p>\u201cWow, quite a little speech,\u201d she said softly. \u201cAnd here I thought all that \u2018you\u2019re mine\u2019</p><p>crap you were spouting the other night actually meant something.\u201d Her smile was filled with mocking bitterness. \u201cOh well, my bad for believing in it, huh?\u201d She gripped the door handle and opened the door slowly. \u201cGo to hell, Sheriff Mayes.\u201d</p><p>She jumped out of the truck before he could reach out and grab her. The door slammed closed, and she crossed the short distance to the back door, unlocked it, and disappeared. Zeke sat staring at it as he rubbed at his chest, wondering at the deep, painful ache he could feel there.</p><p>He inhaled, clenched his teeth, then started the truck and backed out.</p><p>He\u2019d taken her without a condom. He\u2019d claimed her, despite his own best intentions.</p><p>He\u2019d so fucked this up he didn\u2019t know which way to turn at the moment. He knew he had to get her out of town. He had to get her away from the danger that could be stalking her, even now. He couldn\u2019t risk a repeat of the past. His soul couldn\u2019t handle it again.</p><p>Shaking his head, he drew his cell phone from his hip, flipped it open, and punched in the speed dial he had set earlier that day.</p><p>He waited and when a deep male voice answered the call he said, \u201cCal, it\u2019s time to do something. You need to get your daughter home.\u201d</p><p>Calvin Walker was silent for long moments. \u201cWhy?\u201d he finally asked.</p><p>\u201cBecause, if you don\u2019t, she could end up dead.\u201d</p><p>FIFTEEN</p><p>The ringing of the telephone brought Rogue out of arestless sleep. Her eyes cracked open as she glared at the shades on the window. It had to be too early for her to be awake. There was barely any light between the cracks of the shades. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She reached for the phone, fumbled, dropped it on the floor, and cursed before scrambling for it and rolling back in the bed as she flipped it open.</p><p>\u201cYou could die for waking me up this early.\u201d</p><p>She knew who it was. Only one person dared to call her so early and to have the temerity to laugh in her ear about it.</p> <p>\u201cNow, baby sister, getting grumpy with me wouldn\u2019t be nice when I just finished doing you a favor of major proportions.\u201d</p><p>Amusement filled John Calvin Walker Jr.\u2019s voice.</p><p>She almost grinned at the sound of it. But she knew better. If he was calling, then she was in trouble.</p><p>\u201cWhat is Daddy mad over this time?\u201d She yawned. \u201cTell him he can\u2019t cut off my allowance simply because I never use it anyway.\u201d</p><p>John laughed again. \u201cI believe he may have canceled a delivery Mother had arranged for you. Something about silk, lace, and feel-good girly stuff?\u201d</p> <p>She sat up in the bed. \u201cThe French collection? Mom was supposed to have sent that a week ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it appears she may have been a bit late sending it.\u201d She could almost see John\u2019s violet eyes gleaming with amusement as a smile curled at the corners of his lips.</p><p>\u201cWhy would Daddy cancel my delivery?\u201d she asked, frowning. \u201cHe sent the stuff he bought in Saudi last month.\u201d</p><p>John chuckled. \u201cWell, sweet sister, it could be due to a very important phone call he received last night from the son of an enemy he used to have in Somerset. Seems this certain gentleman called Father and confirmed his suspicions that Walkers are being killed.\u201d John\u2019s voice hardened. \u201cThe family jet is prepping to leave this morning. ETA at Louisville is for noon. Have your ass there and be waiting for it.\u201d</p><p>Rogue breathed in slowly. Patience, she reminded herself. Without it, her father and John would win before the battle began. They were overprotective, forceful, and though her father loved her and tried to allow her to live her life as she pleased, he was still her father.</p><p>There was nothing Rogue hated more than being tattled on. When she was a little girl her older brother and sister had always tattled on her. Her teachers tattled, her babysitter had tattled. Rogue had always found a way to get into trouble. And her father had always given the pretense to her mother that he was disciplining her.</p> <p>Calvin Walker had been born to be a father. He had taken the time to get to know his children from infancy. He knew the best way to deal with their weaknesses and how to draw out their strengths.</p><p>But he was, at the very soul of the man, a protective father.</p><p>\u201cTell Daddy he can ignore the sheriff. Whatever Joe and Jaime were involved in, I\u2019m not a part of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you know how well Father is going to listen,\u201d John pointed out with chilling logic.</p><p>\u201cGet your butt on that plane, Rogue. It\u2019s time to come home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I am home, John.\u201d She sighed. \u201cI\u2019m not leaving Somerset. If Daddy wants to come visit, then he\u2019s more than welcome to do so. Hell, the whole family can come visit, but I\u2019ll warn you right up front, contrary to what Zeke Mayes believes, I am more than capable of watching out for my own butt here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo we\u2019re to just sit here and wait until we get that phone call that lets us know you\u2019re dead?\u201d John was becoming angry. His voice was cold, quiet. He was a lot like Calvin Walker in that regard. The angrier he got, the icier he became.</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re to accept that I\u2019m a big girl now and I don\u2019t need to run to the bosom of my family every time some paranoid sheriff gets a wild hair up his ass.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou know, Rogue, six months ago we stood over your hospital bed after some bastard tried to bash your head in. I\u2019d prefer not to do that again, if you don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind in the least,\u201d she said in exasperation. \u201cThis is ridiculous, John. Don\u2019t make me hang up on you. I\u2019m not returning to Boston. This is my home and I\u2019m old enough to decide for myself whether I stay or go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should bash you over the head myself and drag your ass home,\u201d he snapped. \u201cFrom what Father says, Zeke Mayes isn\u2019t some paranoid fool, Rogue. He was worried enough to call Father; that means there\u2019s something to worry about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, he\u2019s real damned worried someone might touch that frozen heart of his.\u201d She swung her legs out of the bed, fury erupting inside her. \u201cLet me tell you what Zeke\u2019s problem is, John. He can\u2019t stand to keep his hands off me, so he had to make certain Daddy hauls me home for his own piece of mind. Now I really don\u2019t give a damn if either of them are resting easy at night. I\u2019m an adult; I\u2019ll decide for myself when to tuck my tail and run, if you don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>Her voice was rising. She was so furious she could barely stand it. How dare Zeke call her father and upset him this way? How dare her father sic her brother on her rather than calling himself?</p><p>That was just like Daddy. He knew if he called himself that Rogue would go ballistic.</p><p>Rather than facing her anger, he called John. Because John would rather fight with her as to breathe some days.</p><p>Yes, sibling rivalry was still alive and well.</p><p>\u201cRogue, don\u2019t make me get on that jet and come after you,\u201d John warned her.</p><p>\u201cJohn, don\u2019t make me call Daddy and fight with him over this. You know it will only end up coming back to slap you on the ass. I\u2019m his favorite, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re his favorite because you\u2019re as crazy as he is,\u201d John accused. \u201cYou can fight it out with him here. I\u2019d suggest you pack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d suggest you take a flying leap,\u201d she raged back at him. \u201cGood-bye, John.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRogue, don\u2019t you hang up on me.\u201d</p><p>She hung up the phone, then turned it off. Rogue inhaled slowly, deeply. If she didn\u2019t get a handle on the hurt and the anger churning through her, then she was going to explode. Exploding wasn\u2019t a good thing. She never failed to hurt herself more than she did anyone else whenever she lost control of her temper.</p><p>Damn Zeke, she thought as she stalked to the shower. Damned tattletale. He should have never called her father and gotten him involved like this. She knew her family. She could expect every damned one of them to descend on her like a plague of locusts now.</p><p>She\u2019d be lucky if her grandparents didn\u2019t fly in with the rest of the brood.</p><p>She shuddered at the thought. She loved her grandparents, she really did. But they were dangerous. Forget the upper-crust Bostonian reserve they used like a shield. Her grandparents were wicked. And they didn\u2019t take prisoners or show mercy.</p><p>She was going to kill Zeke. She was going to string him up and make him scream for mercy. Oh, he had seriously underestimated her.</p><p>An hour later, showered, dressed, and ready to rumble, she pushed into the main section of the bar and behind the long teak counter where Jonesy was checking liquor.</p><p>He straightened from his stooped position and glared back at her.</p><p>They hadn\u2019t talked much since the night Zeke had caught him trying to throw her across the room, and Rogue was saddened by the fact that the friendship she had once believed they had was disintegrating.</p><p>\u201cYou working that damned restaurant today?\u201d Jonesy barked. \u201cIt\u2019s a sad day when a Walker is more concerned with other folks\u2019 businesses than they are with their own.\u201d</p><p>Rogue ignored the comment as she moved around him to the register and collected the receipts from the past night\u2019s sales.</p><p>\u201cWe gotta put orders in today,\u201d he snapped. \u201cOr do you care?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen put the orders in,\u201d she told him. \u201cYou know how to do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s your business,\u201d he sneered. \u201cYou do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could always fire you. Again. And hire someone who will do it.\u201d She shrugged.</p><p>She hated to admit that she preferred working with Janey over working at the Bar. The Bar had saved her at one time; it had helped to remake her at a time when she had been smarting from the loss of her teaching job and the humiliation of the pictures that had hit the Internet.</p><p>Over the years the bikers that had helped her survive had slowly drifted away. A few had died, others had found lives, until there was just her and Jonesy. And now, Jonesy was drifting away as well.</p><p>Maybe it was time to admit what she had sensed all along. The bar wasn\u2019t a permanent part of her life. It was a way to piss folks off and a means of survival. It wasn\u2019t what she enjoyed doing though.</p><p>\u201cThere were comments made about you sneaking off with that sheriff last night,\u201d he spat back at her. \u201cFolks are gossiping over it. It\u2019s going to hurt business.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes as she shoved the receipts into a large envelope to go over later.</p><p>\u201cMy private life is just that, Jonesy,\u201d she informed him. \u201cIf folks don\u2019t like it, then they can find another bar to go to.\u201d</p><p>She was wary around him now. She kept him in her peripheral vision and made certain she had room to run if she needed it. She should have ordered him out of the bar the night he had thrown her across her office. Where would he go though? Rogue knew him; she knew he had nothing but the bar and the little house he owned a few miles away.</p><p>Jonesy didn\u2019t have family, with the exception of a daughter that rarely spoke to him, and the only friends he had worked at the bar. He was always snarly and grouchy, but lately, he had been extreme, tense, and hard for anyone to get along with.</p><p>\u201cLea quit last night,\u201d he informed her.</p><p>Somehow, that didn\u2019t surprise Rogue.</p><p>\u201cThen hire someone else,\u201d she told him as she looked over the liquor that lined the wall and the shelves beneath the bar.</p><p>\u201cIt ain\u2019t that easy,\u201d he ground out between clenched teeth.</p><p>Rogue straightened and stared back at him suspiciously as he towered over her.</p><p>\u201cWhat would make it easier, Jonesy, is if you didn\u2019t scare your bartenders away,\u201d she told him. \u201cYou\u2019re like a rabid junkyard dog and the employees get tired of taking it.\u201d</p><p>She should have done something about him before now. She\u2019d always convinced herself that Jonesy was just like that. It was a gruff exterior, and it didn\u2019t mean anything. But now, she was beginning to wonder if it didn\u2019t go deeper.</p><p>\u201cPussy-faced employees are what they are,\u201d he snapped. \u201cNone of \u2019em have a lick of sense. I told you to let me take care of hiring them, but you have to just stick your nose in it, don\u2019t you? You tell me to take care of hiring, then you turn around and get all nosy and bossy. What good does it to do me to even consider anyone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJonesy, what the hell is your problem?\u201d She swung around on him, anger beginning to beat harshly inside her. \u201cWhat makes you think you can tell me how to run my life or my bar? And what in the hell made you think you could manhandle me the way you did the other night? Are you losing your damned mind?\u201d</p><p>He stared back at her in surprise now, his face flushing before he turned away and ran his hand over his bald head.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to get rough with you,\u201d he snarled, his back to her. \u201cIt was an accident, and I shouldn\u2019t have touched you.\u201d</p><p>An apology from Jonesy?</p><p>\u201cThen why did you?\u201d</p><p>He turned slowly, his expression fierce as he stared back at her. \u201cYou don\u2019t listen anymore, Rogue. You\u2019re tramping yourself out to that sheriff knowing damned good and well he won\u2019t stick around no longer than it takes for him to get his rocks off. Just like Joe and Jaime. I told you they were bad news. Always in here bumming beer and sucking up to you. You were going to give them part of the bar, weren\u2019t you? I heard you talking about it.\u201d</p><p>That had been her plan. Joe and Jaime had loved the bar; Rogue had known she was growing discontented with it. But she wanted it to remain in Walker hands.</p><p>\u201cJoe and Jaime loved the bar, Jonesy,\u201d she said, a sense of sadness enveloping her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThey helped me a lot here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey got in your damned way and conspired to take this damned bar from both of us,\u201d</p><p>he snarled, his beefy arms crossing over his heavy chest. \u201cThey were good for nothing, Rogue. You just couldn\u2019t see it. Just like that damned sheriff. He\u2019ll get you killed as dead as he got his wife killed.\u201d</p> <p>Rogue stared back at him in surprise.</p><p>\u201cZeke had nothing to do with his wife\u2019s death,\u201d she shot back furiously. \u201cShe was killed in a car accident while he was still in L.A.\u201d</p><p>A flash of cunning glittered in his gaze for a second.</p><p>\u201cWell, there\u2019s a piece of gossip you didn\u2019t know,\u201d he chuckled coldly. \u201cNo, little girl.</p><p>Zeke Mayes\u2019s wife was murdered because he was sloppy. He was working an investigation in L.A. into the bondage scene. Good ole married detective Mayes was bopping pain whores and one of them found out who he was and what he was doing.</p> <p>His wife died and his son almost died. He was the reason she died, just like he\u2019s going to be the reason you die.\u201d</p><p>Pain whores. It was a term Rogue had heard used for women who liked sexual pain.</p><p>Whips, chains, multiple sexual partners, cutting, the list went on and on.</p><p>\u201cWhere did you hear this trash, Jonesy?\u201d she asked in disgust. \u201cZeke is not into giving pain, and I doubt very seriously if he did anything to cause his wife\u2019s death, no matter why or how she died. And you need to stop this now, before I call Alex Jansen and have you escorted off my property.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGonna fire me, are you?\u201d He snorted, dropped his arms from his chest, and moved farther back along the counter. \u201cCheck it out yourself. Ain\u2019t many people that know what happened, but I was here when he came back with that kid of his, and I was here before his old man died. His daddy blubbered the whole story into his beer one night, whining like a little girl \u2019cause his boy was a failure.\u201d</p><p>Jonesy didn\u2019t lie. He was mouthy, he was pissy, but he wasn\u2019t a liar. He believed what he was saying. Rogue refused to accept it. Zeke\u2019s wife might have died because of his involvement in an investigation, but it wasn\u2019t because he had failed. She knew him too well for that. His steely control wouldn\u2019t have allowed for such a failure.</p> <p>\u201cJonesy, don\u2019t make me fire you.\u201d She faced him, shoulders squared, fury beginning to build inside her. \u201cDon\u2019t push our friendship any further.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn other words, don\u2019t tell you the truth about that jackass you\u2019re fucking?\u201d he sneered.</p><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s how you want to see it,\u201d she replied coldly, \u201cthen that\u2019s exactly what I mean.</p><p>Because the next time this trash comes out of your mouth, you\u2019ll be out of here.\u201d</p><p>With that she turned away from him and began making the order list for the liquor. An hour later she was in the kitchen in the back getting the order list the cook had left last night before moving to her office to make the necessary orders.</p><p>She still had her own financials to go through and get in shape for monthly taxes, and those for the Mackay restaurant were waiting for her to complete as well.</p><p>She had a full day ahead of her, and one little side trip to make to the sheriff\u2019s office before she headed to the restaurant. Zeke, like Jonesy, would find out just exactly how much she thought of tattlers. Which was nil. Zero. And she was getting fed up to her back teeth with autocratic, arrogant men. It was time to do something about both of them.</p><p>That evening Zeke ran his fingers over his short hair and stared at the reports the county and city coroners had submitted. The county coroner, Jay Adams, sat in the visitor\u2019s chair on the other side of the desk, his lined face creased into a worried scowl as Zeke read the report.</p> <p>Long minutes later Zeke lifted his head and pinned the other man with his eyes. \u201cYou sure about this, Jay?\u201d he asked quietly.</p><p>\u201cGene and I both ran the same tests and came back with the same conclusions, Zeke. I don\u2019t know who killed those boys, but they were unconscious before the shots were fired. Both boys were pumped full of heroin, not just Joe. Evidence shows they were nearly dead before those shots were fired. I don\u2019t know what you have going on here, but I\u2019m ruling it a double murder and I\u2019m using those grounds to justify holding their grandmother\u2019s body for an autopsy as well.\u201d</p><p>Zeke rubbed his hand over his jaw and shifted through the reports before blowing out a heavy breath.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d He lifted his gaze back to Jay. \u201cWhy go to these lengths to hide a murder?\u201d</p><p>Jay shrugged. \u201cHell, it looked like a murder-suicide, Zeke. Chances were, we\u2019d never have run these tests this in depth. Even with your suspicions I wouldn\u2019t have normally justified it myself. It was a damned slow week though, so what the hell. Whoever did this, they almost pulled it off. We had to look for this.\u201d He waved his hand to the report.</p><p>\u201cIt didn\u2019t come easy.\u201d</p><p>Zeke stared down at the file and he knew, knew in the pit of his stomach, that the Walkers had been killed by the Freedom League\u2019s killer. The why of it was driving him crazy. There were no answers to be found, no way to tie Joe or Jaime to any one particular woman, or to pinpoint if this was simply a League hit and the woman was an incidental.</p><p>\u201cThe Walkers were rumored to be courting one particular woman,\u201d Zeke said. \u201cThey told their grandmother they had a date with her that weekend. The day of that particular date they\u2019re killed. According to their sister, their grandmother was trying to contact me in regard to that girl\u2019s identity. She never called, but she ends up dead the same day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like you\u2019re looking for a very smart little girl, or a really pissed off husband or lover.\u201d Jay shrugged as he rose to his feet. \u201cIf you learn anything let me know. Until then, you have our reports and your evidence to continue the investigation. Good luck on that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Jay.\u201d He nodded as Jay turned and left the room.</p><p>He shook his head as he closed the files and slid them into the drawer at the side of his desk. It was time to figure out exactly what had happened to those boys.</p><p>Zeke had questioned everyone he could think of that were close to the Walker boys. He knew they were supplying DHS with information, but Zeke knew Cranston and the Mackays. Unless the Walker boys had let that information slip, then no one else had known it. And from everything he\u2019d learned, Joe and Jaime hadn\u2019t talked. But their grandmother must have.</p><p>Running his fingers over his hair, he tried to narrow down the choices of who Callie Walker would have chosen to talk to. Lisa hadn\u2019t had any answers for him there, and Zeke wasn\u2019t coming up with his own.</p><p>The only thing he was certain of was that this had to do with the Freedom League and the killer that seemed to shadow his life. The same killer that could threaten the one woman Zeke had promised himself he would always protect.</p><p>Rogue wasn\u2019t going to leave town, even for her own good. He\u2019d accepted that sometime in the middle of the night as he stared up at the ceiling, his dick pole stiff, his balls tormented with need.</p><p>She was just that damned stubborn that she would stay come hell or high water. Or death.</p><p>He rubbed his hands over his face as he considered the fact that he may have even made an error in judgment in calling her father. But at the time, nothing had mattered but her protection. Someone was killing Walkers, and she could be next. This investigation into Joe and Jaime\u2019s deaths could possibly bring that danger closer to her door. Just as his mother\u2019s association with his father and the League had brought death to Zeke\u2019s life in L.A. His mother had died when flames had engulfed her small house, but the coroner\u2019s report had stated she had been dead long before the fire started.</p><p>Elaina had died in a car wreck when her car has sped into traffic on a busy interstate, straight into an oncoming semi. She had been drugged, not with heroin but with a toxic mix of narcotics that she wouldn\u2019t have survived even if she had managed to live through the wreck.</p><p>On the day of Elaina\u2019s death he\u2019d received a short, printed note.We protect our own.</p><p>It was the League\u2019s motto. He\u2019d known the minute he read it that his wife had died because of his past, because of his hidden investigation into certain members of that League once he made detective.</p><p>He\u2019d thought he was being so careful, that there wasn\u2019t a chance that anyone could have known what he was doing. And he\u2019d been wrong. He hadn\u2019t protected his family as he should have, and now Rogue was being drawn into the same fire.</p><p>It was time to call Cranston, he thought. He\u2019d protect Rogue, and Cranston and the Mackays could help with this investigation. He couldn\u2019t risk her. God help him if he allowed anything to happen to his Rogue.</p><p>And he knew, the danger was drawing closer.</p><p>Zeke could feel it, that sixth sense, that awareness that the killer wasn\u2019t going to stop; he would only get cockier. Whoever it was had a taste for murder and for giving pain.</p><p>A light knock on his door had his head lifting; a second later it opened and Gene stepped in.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m heading out on patrol,\u201d Gene told him, a light frown on his brow. \u201cI just saw the coroner leave. Do we have the report on the Walkers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth boys were murdered,\u201d Zeke answered as he waved Gene into the room.</p><p>The deputy stepped in and closed the door behind him, scowling.</p><p>\u201cWell, hell,\u201d he breathed out roughly. \u201cI\u2019m damned sorry for what I said now, Zeke. It\u2019s hard to believe someone wanted to kill those boys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, someone wanted to and they accomplished it.\u201d Zeke rubbed the back of his neck tiredly. \u201cThe part that confuses the hell out of me is how they pulled it off this slick. It would take experience and balls to make that look as close to a murder- suicide as this one did.\u201d</p><p>Gene plopped down in the chair in front of his desk as he gazed back at him thoughtfully. Zeke hated the suspicion that roiled in his gut now, the feeling that Gene was somehow a part of this.</p><p>\u201cExperience would be the hard part,\u201d Gene said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a lot of folks that I know of that would have that except our new chief, the Mackay boys, and that DHS</p><p>agent that seems to be loitering around the Mackays, Agent Cranston.\u201d</p><p>Zeke shook his head. \u201cNo motive and out of character. Whoever did this, it has to do with the woman the Walker boys were sniffing after.\u201d That and their work with DHS.</p><p>Zeke kept that to himself. If Gene was involved in this, then he didn\u2019t need to know that Zeke suspected him of it.</p><p>\u201cHow so?\u201d Gene grunted. \u201cHell, those boys always had a woman they were sniffing after.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLisa said their grandmother was trying to contact me the day she died, to tell me who she thought the girl might be.\u201d Zeke leaned back in his chair and shook his head slowly.</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t call here or my cell phone. I have a feeling what she did was call someone else. The wrong someone else.\u201d</p><p>Gene stared back at him in amazement. \u201cHell,\u201d he finally breathed out. \u201cShe was confrontational as hell; she would have done that.\u201d</p><p>And if Gene was involved in this, then he was a better actor than Zeke had given him credit for.</p><p>\u201cI have a request in with the job for a subpoena of her phone records; maybe I\u2019ll figure something out there.\u201d Zeke tapped his fingers against the arm of his chair. \u201cThe way she died is sitting about as well as the way her grandsons died. She didn\u2019t decide to take a bath on her own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we have a triple homicide and no clear suspect.\u201d Gene grimaced. \u201cHell, you\u2019d think we\u2019d get a break after that bullshit with the Mackays and those terrorists last year.</p><p>What do you need me to do, Zeke?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeep your ears open, see if you can get a name. I have a few more people to question.\u201d</p><p>Top of his list was Rogue\u2019s bartender Jonesy. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jonesy had a daughter that had been in town until the day before. Angie Jones was only eighteen, pretty from what Zeke had heard. Her name hadn\u2019t been linked to the Walkers, but it was an angle he couldn\u2019t overlook. Gene had a daughter as well, one in her early twenties, but she was married and living in Louisville.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do that.\u201d Gene nodded, rising to his feet. \u201cAnd the missus told me to let you know you\u2019re invited to dinner next weekend. Willa and her new husband will be in from Louisville for a visit and they were asking about you.\u201d</p><p>Zeke shook his head. \u201cI can\u2019t make it next weekend, Gene. Shane\u2019s supposed to be home and I try to spend some time with him when he\u2019s in,\u201d he said apologetically, though Zeke didn\u2019t regret that he couldn\u2019t.</p> <p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Gene sighed. \u201cI figured. Anyway.\u201d He nodded sharply. \u201cI\u2019ll see you tomorrow then. I best head home or the missus is likely to have my hide for dinner. Evenin\u2019, Zeke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee you tomorrow, Gene.\u201d He nodded back as Gene left the office, then rubbed at the back of his neck while rising from his chair.</p><p>Picking up the coroner\u2019s report, he moved to the file cabinet, filed it, then locked the tall, gray metal cabinet and glanced at the clock.</p><p>Tonight was Rogue\u2019s early night at the restaurant. She would have taken care of paperwork rather than working as the hostess.</p><p>Hell. He\u2019d fucked up last night, it was that simple. He was so desperate to get her out of the line of fire and just egotistical enough to think he could make her mad enough, or worse, hurt her enough, to send her running for home.</p> <p>He should have known better. He had known better; that was the reason he had called her father, because he had known in his gut that wasn\u2019t going to work. Rogue wouldn\u2019t run, not from anything. She hadn\u2019t run from Nadine Grace and Dayle Mackay when they\u2019d threatened her with those pictures, and she hadn\u2019t run from her assailant six months before. She wasn\u2019t going to run now.</p><p>And she definitely wouldn\u2019t run when he showed up at the bar tomorrow afternoon to question Jonesy. She\u2019d stick right to the other man\u2019s side and glare at Zeke the whole damned time. He\u2019d get hard, horny, and once questioning was over he\u2019d be trying to carry her to her bedroom. If she didn\u2019t try to kill him first.</p><p>SIXTEEN</p><p>It was Ladies\u2019 Night at the Bar. This was the reasonRogue made certain she was on-site from seven that evening until after closing. Ladies\u2019 Night, spring and summer, was often the wildest night of the week. Saturdays could run a good close second, but the majority of her bouncers were on duty every Friday and Saturday evening. Wednesday was a bit lacking in that area, as most of her bouncers had second jobs through the week.</p><p>She kept meaning to hire more bouncers for Wednesdays, but so far she had been able to handle it with her skeleton crew. She had four bouncers on duty along with Jonesy, and the assistant bartender Kent.</p><p>The bar was filled close to capacity. The band was belting out country dance tunes and ballads, and the alcohol was flowing freely. A large majority of the regulars were there as well as a surprising number of tourists in town to enjoy the unseasonably warm weather and the many attractions to be had in Lake Cumberland.</p> <p>As the day had progressed, Rogue\u2019s frustration had only grown. Her father had called.</p><p>Ten minutes later her mother had called. After that, her grandparents and her sister.</p><p>John hadn\u2019t called back, and that worried her more than anything.</p><p>Her father no longer suspected that Walkers were being killed; Zeke had confirmed his fears and now Calvin Walker was determined to get his daughter home.</p><p>Damn them all. She had been manipulated from the moment she stepped foot into this damned town. By one person or another she had been jerked around until she felt like a fucking rubber band.</p><p>She stared around the bar, realizing what it had come to represent, the escape from reality that it had been for all these years. She had raced here after her life had fallen apart, and she had molded herself into a woman that others feared. Men and women alike. She had surrounded herself with men who were ready to fight at a moment\u2019s notice, and they had taught her how to fight.</p><p>How to use her fists. How to use her knees. How to be the rogue that didn\u2019t care what others thought or what they expected from her.</p><p>The problem was, she did care. She had always cared. And she was only now realizing it.</p> <p>\u201cRogue, dance with me, baby.\u201d An arm snaked around her waist, pulling her against a strong male body. Dressed in camouflage and smelling like week-old sweat.</p><p>Rogue wrinkled her nose and pushed away with a forced laugh. \u201cGet a shower, Bubba,\u201d</p><p>she called back to him. \u201cSoon.\u201d</p><p>It was typical. A few feet away a hand reached out to her, laughter, most of it drunken or forced, echoed around her as the customer requested a dance. A smile and polite refusal, and a stronger dislike for where she was.</p><p>She was here when she wanted to be back at the restaurant. Where she could make certain Janey or Alex or, God forbid, Natches wasn\u2019t messing with her accounting file or the reservation layout. Where she could dress in something other than denim or leather.</p><p>Where Rogue was more than the bar whore she had always allowed everyone to believe.</p><p>Damn her pride. It ran wide and deep inside her, that was for damned sure. Four years she had spent here, rubbing it in Nadine Grace\u2019s and Dayle Mackay\u2019s faces that they couldn\u2019t run her out of town. Rubbing it in Zeke\u2019s face that he couldn\u2019t ignore her.</p><p>For what? A few one-night stands? A few hours that in the end had left her feeling stark and hollow inside. And hurt. Damn, she hated feeling hurt. It was her weakness. Make her angry and she\u2019d explode and just get it out of her system. Hurt her and it was like her brain short-circuited. She didn\u2019t care for people as a rule, didn\u2019t give them the chance to hurt her because she couldn\u2019t handle that kind of pain. Emotional pain.</p><p>Rejection. Fuck, she hated rejection.</p><p>\u201cRogue, get your ass behind this bar for me,\u201d Jonesy called out as he lifted his bat from under the counter. \u201cJason\u2019s got trouble near the door.\u201d</p><p>Rogue jumped and jerked the bat out of his grip before he could stop her.</p><p>\u201cYou man the bar,\u201d she yelled back, adrenaline jangling through her nervous system.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take care of the trouble.\u201d</p><p>She turned and moved away, slapped the bat in one hand, and grinned. She hadn\u2019t had a good rousing fight all year long. That was all she needed to get over this. She could just get mad, get it out of her system, and then get on with her business. She could clear the emotional bullshit out of her head, then get on with getting over Zeke.</p><p>\u201cDammit, Rogue!\u201d She heard Jonesy cursing behind her and flashed him a smile over her shoulder before flipping her hair back and heading for the confrontation evolving close to the bar\u2019s entrance.</p><p>She didn\u2019t intend to use the bat. She had never used the bat. She\u2019d used her knee only when she had to, but the times she\u2019d been forced into it had been noted and most men tread warily around her now.</p><p>Moving quickly through the crowd, she pushed her way into the circle of customers that surrounded the two men. Billy Joe Wingate and Luke Taylor. Two rawboned country boys with a little too much drink and a whole lot of anger.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me what to do, fucker!\u201d Billy Joe spat back at the bouncer behind him and sidestepped his grip. \u201cI ain\u2019t goin\u2019 no damned where. Not till this son of a bitch apologizes.\u201d Billy Joe slammed his palms into Luke\u2019s wide chest, sending the other man back several spaces and bouncing against a female customer who slammed into the man behind her.</p><p>Oh fight.</p><p>\u201cWhoa there. Whoa there.\u201d Rogue jumped between Luke and the woman\u2019s escort, her hands gripping each end of the bat and pressing it hard into the man\u2019s chest. \u201cHold back. We have it. Jason, get these boys out of here.\u201d</p><p>She glanced over her shoulder to see Jason and another bouncer struggling with Billy Joe and Luke.</p><p>\u201cTake it outside, dammit,\u201d she yelled over the din as the bouncers dragged the two men to the door. She turned around quickly to the man she was holding back. \u201cKeep your ass in here,\u201d she yelled, pressing against his chest with the bat for emphasis. \u201cDon\u2019t make me have to take your head off, too.\u201d</p><p>She pushed away and swung around toward the door where Jason and the other bouncer were struggling with the two young men. Both combatants were a little too drunk and a little too full of adrenaline and anger.</p><p>\u201cI said I ain\u2019t leaving here,\u201d Billy Joe yelled out, his hazel eyes wild with anger as he glared at Luke. \u201cNot till you make him apologize.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ain\u2019t apologizing, you stupid little fucker,\u201d Luke screamed back at him. \u201cYou want to go dumb over a little bar whore, then you better get used to the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe ain\u2019t no whore.\u201d</p><p>Rogue was rushing to the door when Billy Joe managed to tear loose from Jason and throw a wild punch at Luke. Rogue chose that moment to push between them and went flying when that fist crashed into her cheekbone.</p><p>Stars exploded in front of her eyes as a vicious curse ripped from her throat. Turning, her foot kicked out and up, caught Billy Joe in the chest and knocked him back by maybe a foot. Dammit.</p><p>Her face felt shattered. She stumbled after the first instinctive reaction and nearly went to her knees as she shook her head and used the bat against the floor to catch herself.</p><p>Dammit. She said enough. She wasn\u2019t here to get a ham-sized fist in her face.</p><p>\u201cGet him out of here!\u201d She turned, yelling at Jason as the pain reverberated through her head. Hell, her eyes were going to pop out of their sockets.</p><p>Fury surged inside her, hot and deep as she slammed the bat into Billy Joe\u2019s chest, gripping both ends, trying to hold him back as he jerked out of Jason\u2019s hold again. Her boots slid on the wood floor as a chorus of curses and accusations began to ring around her head.</p><p>\u201cBilly Joe, enough!\u201d she yelled.</p><p>Billy Joe gripped her shoulders, snarled down at her, then drew his fist back, and as far as she was concerned, enough was enough.</p><p>Her knee swung up and connected between his heavy thighs as his fist landed at the side of her head. His eyes went wide, a high-pitched whine filling the air as silence suddenly echoed around her, and Billy Joe Wingate went to his knees, his hands now clapped between his thighs.</p><p>Rogue\u2019s head was ringing, she swore there were spots in front of her eyes, and she was thanking God that Billy Joe had pulled his punch at the last second.</p><p>\u201cGet them the fuck out of my bar!\u201d she yelled at Jason as he gripped the younger man beneath the arms and began dragging him out the door.</p><p>The other bouncer, Timmy, was pushing Luke out and Rogue followed with the bat.</p><p>Adrenaline and anger were pumping inside her. Her head hurt, her eyes hurt, and she was more furious with herself that she had allowed it to happen than she was at Billy Joe for throwing the first punch.</p><p>She stalked into the cool air of the night, glaring at the two men as the bouncers tossed them to the blacktop pavement. And of course they came up fighting, fists flying.</p><p>Hard hands gripped her shoulders and jerked her around, and she swore she saw Jonesy\u2019s face blur for a precious second.</p><p>\u201cHave you lost your damned mind?\u201d he screamed in her face, his expression twisted in fury, his eyes burning with it as he shook her roughly. \u201cLook what the hell they did to your damned face. Damn you. You\u2019ve fucking lost your mind.\u201d</p><p>He shook her until her head lobbed on her shoulders, back and forth, and she grew dizzy from the effort it took to retain consciousness. Just as she thought she was going to lose it, an enraged yell sounded behind her. She was jerked away from Jonesy, stumbled, and fell against another hard body.</p><p>Helping hands supported her as curses rained around her. Shaking her head, Rogue blinked desperately and fought to make out what was going on around her. When she finally managed to clear her gaze she saw Jonesy laid out on his stomach, Zeke straddling as he locked cuffs around his wrists. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jonesy was still and silent, but he wasn\u2019t unconscious. He was staring back at her, his gaze filled with resignation and hurt. The kind of hurt fed by betrayal and steeped in emotion.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you doing?\u201d She jerked away from the hands holding her, pushed back her hair, and stomped over to Zeke as he rose from Jonesy\u2019s back. \u201cLet him go.</p><p>Now.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe hell I will! Have you seen your damned face yet, Rogue? What the hell happened here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t hit me.\u201d Her hand connected weakly with his chest. \u201cIt was those damned yahoos the bouncers are holding for you. Now let him the hell go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was shaking you,\u201d he yelled into her face, his hands gripping her arms, and she could feel the bruises Jonesy had already left there.</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, what the hell are you getting ready to do?\u201d</p><p>Rogue stared up at him, seeing the rage in his brown eyes, the tension in his hard, lean body. Zeke was ready to kill. A muscle ticked along his jaw and his lips were a flat line of anger as he scowled back at her.</p> <p>\u201cI warned you,\u201d he growled. \u201cThe next time he laid his hands on you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet over yourself!\u201d she yelled back at him. \u201cI can\u2019t have public rights with you, then I\u2019ll be damned if you can have protective ones with me. Now let him go.\u201d</p><p>She was in his face, almost nose to nose as his head lowered and he glared down at her.</p><p>She could feel a heavy breeze whipping around them, feel the attention of the onlookers locked on them.</p><p>\u201cLet him go, Gene.\u201d Zeke\u2019s lips pulled back from his teeth in a snarl.</p><p>\u201cLet him go?\u201d Gene questioned in amazement. \u201cHe was about to break her damned neck, Sheriff.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNow.\u201d The order was an animalistic growl that sent a tremor racing up Rogue\u2019s spine.</p><p>\u201cGet the two that started this shit in lockup and dry them out. Take statements.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUhh, sure, Sheriff,\u201d Gene cleared his throat. \u201cYou\u2019re off duty, it\u2019s my call anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re damned right I\u2019m off duty.\u201d Zeke\u2019s fingers slid into her hair, clenched, and pulled her head back as his arm went around her back, jerking her to him. \u201cAnd by God, I know how to take advantage of it.\u201d</p><p>His lips landed on hers in a kiss so fiery, so filled with hunger that she was left gasping.</p><p>As quickly as it had begun, it was over. His head lifted, eyes narrowed, he stared back at her intently.</p><p>\u201cIn public,\u201d he snarled. \u201cNow let\u2019s go, you\u2019re going to the hospital.\u201d</p><p>He swung her up in his arms before she could protest and amid the surprised gazes of customers, Jonesy, and Rogue was certain she glimpsed a Mackay or two, he carried her to the pickup he had used the night before. His personal vehicle. The one he had taken her in.</p> <p>He swung the door open, then pushed her inside, one hand at her rear as he pressed her along the bench seat.</p><p>\u201cBuckle up,\u201d he bit out angrily, his voice rough.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to the damned hospital. You try to make me and I promise you\u2019ll regret it.\u201d She buckled up before turning to him and eating him with her eyes. \u201cYou damned tattletale. I\u2019m not going anywhere with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTattletale?\u201d He twisted the key in the ignition and reversed out of the parking lot with a squeal of tires. \u201cSince when am I a damned tattletale?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince you calledDaddy on me,\u201d she sneered. \u201cOh really, Zeke, did you think that worrying my father would save your ass? Like hell. I\u2019m going to kick your ass.\u201d</p><p>She was enraged, furious, and the object of every frustration she had ever had was sitting in the truck beside her.</p><p>\u201cAnd why the hell am I in your truck?\u201d Her hand slapped the dashboard furiously as she turned and stared back at him.</p><p>\u201cBecause evidently it\u2019s where you damned well belong,\u201d he yelled back at her, his voice rough. \u201cFor God\u2019s sake, Rogue, why couldn\u2019t you just go back to Boston?\u201d</p><p>That stopped her. Rogue narrowed her eyes on him, taking in the way his hands were clenched on the steering wheel, the hard set of his lips, the gleam of anger in his gaze when he glanced back at her. She could feel the blood thundering through her veins now, excitement and arousal pounding in her nerve endings.</p><p>\u201cWhy is it so damned important to you that I go back to Boston?\u201d she argued. \u201cCome on, Zeke, I have nothing to do with Joe and Jaime\u2019s death. Why the hell do you want me in Boston so bad unless it\u2019s because you can\u2019t keep that frozen heart of yours in cold storage as long as I\u2019m here?\u201d</p><p>His jaw tensed and his foot became heavier on the gas as they sped, she assumed, to his farm.</p><p>Zeke pressed his lips tightly together and reined in the anger pulsing through him. All he could see flashing through his mind was Rogue, shaking in Jonesy\u2019s grip, her head bouncing on her shoulders as her bartender shook the shit out of her.</p><p>There were bruises on her arms from the bastard\u2019s fingers, there were bruises on her face, courtesy of a fist he had heard about while he was cuffing Jonesy. One of those bastards had hit her, not once, but twice. There was a dark area close to her temple; her cheek was beginning to swell.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t my heart I was worried about protecting,\u201d he ground out between his teeth.</p><p>\u201cDid it ever enter that stubborn little brain of yours that maybe I was trying to protect you?\u201d</p><p>Silence continued to fill the cab of the truck as Zeke took the turn that led back to his farm. Hell, he should have rushed her to the emergency room, not to his farm, despite her objections.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need your protection.\u201d Her voice shook and he could hear the pain that resonated inside it. \u201cI don\u2019t need anything from you, Zeke. I\u2019m sick of your hot and cold attitude, and I\u2019m really damned sick of only seeing you whenever you need to fuck.\u201d</p><p>He shot her a furious glare. Only when he needed to fuck? He made more rounds of that damned bar and the Mackay restaurant a day than he did any other business. He waited for her, watched for her, and damn her, all he did was think about her, and she thought he was just there for the sex?</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t need to fuck tonight,\u201d he stated with an edge of disgust. \u201cI was more concerned with getting you away from that damned bar crowd before you ended up with your head bashed in. For God\u2019s sake, Rogue, you waded into a bar fight between two men more than twice your size.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor God\u2019s sake, Zeke,\u201d she drawled mockingly. \u201cIt just so happens it wasmy bar .\u201d She screamed the last two words at him. \u201cYou had no right to pull me out of there, and you sure as hell had no right to handcuff Jonesy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s lucky I didn\u2019t kill him.\u201d Rage nearly consumed him at the remembered sight of Jonesy shaking her like a rag doll. \u201cThat\u2019s the second time that bastard thought he could manhandle you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd it\u2019s the second time that you jumped to the wrong conclusion,\u201d she accused him.</p><p>\u201cI think you do it deliberately.\u201d</p><p>Zeke wiped his hand down his face before clenching the steering wheel in a death grip.</p><p>Just a few more minutes, he told himself. He\u2019d be at the farm, when he should be taking her to the hospital, in the house, and then he could turn her over his knee and paddle her ass for daring to allow herself to be in such a situation.</p><p>Damned stubborn woman. She refused medical care but wouldn\u2019t care a damned bit to jump into the middle of another fucking bar-room brawl.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t just jump to the wrong conclusions,\u201d he said carefully, attempting to throttle his anger. \u201cAnd Jonesy won\u2019t get away with this, Rogue. I\u2019ll have my own little talk with him.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened in alarm. In real alarm, there was no mockery in her gaze as she stared back at him now. \u201cYou\u2019re going to get into a fight with him because he shook me a little bit? Good God, Zeke, this is ridiculous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot nearly as ridiculous as the knots you have me tied into.\u201d Zeke knew she was breaking through barriers he hadn\u2019t even realized were weakened by her. Hell, he\u2019d just kissed her in front of a Wednesday night crowd at the bar and hauled her into his truck before reports had even been gathered. How many state and federal mandates had he broken with that one?</p><p>\u201cOh yeah, Zeke, you\u2019re really tied in knots over me,\u201d she snorted sarcastically. \u201cSo tied up that I\u2019m continually trying to figure out exactly where I stand with you. It\u2019s like trying to catch the wind.\u201d</p><p>He heard the hurt in her voice and he didn\u2019t blame her for it. He was trying too hard to make certain she didn\u2019t end up in danger that her emotions were being sacrificed. That wasn\u2019t what he wanted. He wanted her safe, and until he identified the man the League sent in to do their dirty work, then she wouldn\u2019t be safe until she was out of Pulaski County.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not that damned hard to figure out,\u201d he finally protested with an edge of disgust.</p><p>\u201cHell, Rogue, wanting you out of the county until this investigation is over doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m trying to deny anything that\u2019s between us. It simply means I\u2019m trying to protect you.\u201d</p><p>He made the turn onto the graveled road that led to his farm and prayed that Shane hadn\u2019t come home for the night.</p><p>\u201cOh yeah, that\u2019s why you just left last night rather than coming upstairs with me,\u201d she pointed out.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t come upstairs with you because we were too angry with each other for what we both know would have happened. I won\u2019t fuck you while I\u2019m angry with you, Rogue. We have things to settle between us. I wanted those things settled first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThings like me leaving town?\u201d she argued. \u201cYou can forget that one, Zeke. It\u2019s not going to happen.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, he\u2019d already pretty much figured that one out. Blowing out a deep breath he tried to consider an alternative way to make certain she didn\u2019t end up hurt, or worse, dead.</p><p>Hell, he\u2019d already lost his wife to an investigation; he didn\u2019t want to lose Rogue to another one.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll discuss other options,\u201d he said as he pulled into the driveway and shut off the ignition before turning to face her. \u201cI won\u2019t let you risk yourself though, I want that made clear here and now. Until this is over, you can\u2019t work the bar, you can\u2019t travel alone. Not until I figure out what\u2019s going on.\u201d</p><p>Rogue\u2019s expression was stark as the outside lights reflected off her pale flesh.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve learned something more,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Zeke breathed out heavily. \u201cJoe and Jaime were murdered, Rogue, and I suspect their grandmother was as well. If she was, that means you are in danger. Whoever started this isn\u2019t finished, and I have a bad feeling about it. Whoever it is will end up coming after you.\u201d</p><p>Her lips parted, vulnerable, silken soft as her tongue licked over them, leaving a glistening sheen of dampness that could have tempted a saint.</p><p>A hint of fear flashed in her eyes, and he hadn\u2019t wanted to see that. He wanted her wild, angry, laughing, or mocking, but never hurt or frightened. And seeing it made Zeke want to kill.</p><p>SEVENTEEN</p><p>Rogue sat on the couch, an ice bag on the side ofher face. The bruising really wasn\u2019t that bad, but she could see why Zeke would have been a tad upset. It sure as hell didn\u2019t look pretty.</p><p>She had changed out of the leather pants and silky camisole top she had worn at the bar and into one of Zeke\u2019s white shirts. The material enveloped her in his scent, in a sense of warmth.</p><p>With her legs curled beneath her she watched as he made a small fire in the fireplace across from her. He had changed his uniform for jeans, though he wasn\u2019t wearing a shirt or shoes.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t said much after they entered the house, and Rogue didn\u2019t know what to say at this point. She had called the bar while Zeke showered to learn that Jonesy had been released and was still running the bar. At least she didn\u2019t have to worry about him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She was going to have to make a decision about the bar though. She knew Natches was looking to sell his share in the Mackay restaurant if she decided she wanted to buy him out. It was something to think about. Hell, it was something she had been thinking about for months.</p><p>\u201cHow does your face feel?\u201d Zeke straightened from the fireplace, turned, and moved toward her.</p><p>He didn\u2019t walk, he stalked. Dark, heavy muscle flexed in his arms, chest, and powerful abdomen. His jeans lay low on his hips and beneath them, she could tell he was still heavily aroused.</p> <p>\u201cMy face is fine.\u201d She let the ice pack drop to the coffee table in front of her before leaning back against the couch cushions as he sat down beside her.</p><p>His fingers curled along her jaw to turn her face to where he could get a better look.</p><p>\u201cYou should have gone to the hospital,\u201d he said, his voice dark, rough.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve had worse.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cThe absolute worst hit I ever had was given by a woman. She was with a small biker club a couple of years ago. She gave me a concussion with her fist. That wasn\u2019t fun.\u201d She smiled back at him and gave him a wicked little wink. \u201cCome on, Zeke, stop glaring at me, I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you\u2019re fine. For now.\u201d He shook his head as he released her jaw. \u201cWhat about the next time, Rogue?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ll deal with the next time when it comes around,\u201d she told him quietly, then asked hesitantly, \u201cAre you worried because of what happened to your wife?\u201d</p><p>Rogue watched as all emotion cleared from his face with her question.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you hear about my wife?\u201d he finally asked.</p><p>It was a good thing she wasn\u2019t frightened of big men like her sister was, or cared who she pissed off.</p><p>\u201cI heard your wife died during an investigation you were conducting in L.A. You were posing as a SWAT member interested in the BDSM lifestyle to expose another member that was involved in drugs. It\u2019s amazing the information you can get if you dig enough.\u201d And evidently, she had dug just enough.</p><p>Zeke felt his jaw clench. Hell, his entire body tightened with furious tension. He\u2019d been able to cover up most of the talk his father had instigated when he first arrived home.</p> <p>The rumors his father had started had only one purpose in mind. To protect the League, because he had known damned good and well who had killed Zeke\u2019s wife. And it wasn\u2019t anything Zeke had done.</p><p>\u201cMy wife died because of an investigation,\u201d he agreed. \u201cBut it wasn\u2019t the investigation I was involved with in L.A. It had to do with something more personal.\u201d</p><p>He let her see his eyes and what was reflected in them. Shame welled inside him, and that same fury that had followed him for so many years.</p><p>\u201cMeaning?\u201d She watched him intently for long seconds.</p><p>\u201cMeaning, what happened to Elaina had more to do with the reason my mother left with me for L.A.\u201d Staring into the fire he fought to hold the full truth back from her. She deserved to know everything; unfortunately, Zeke couldn\u2019t tell her everything.</p><p>\u201cThat was a long time ago,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Zeke nodded. \u201cLong ago and far away, I\u2019d hoped. It followed us though when Mom decided to threaten Dad with something she knew. She was killed first. When I began investigating things myself, Elaina was killed and I was warned off the investigation.\u201d</p><p>His jaw tightened with the memories. \u201cI had Shane to think of. I backed off then. When I returned here, I started checking into it again. I\u2019ve been tracking the same man ever since. A man that killed for the Freedom League. The same group Dayle and Nadine were a part of.\u201d</p> <p>He heard her hard, indrawn breath and glanced back at her.</p><p>\u201cDad was a part of the League,\u201d he told her then. \u201cAnd I think it goes without saying that this stays between the two of us.\u201d</p><p>Her violet eyes flashed with anger. \u201cYou can be an asshole, Zeke,\u201d she accused him. \u201cOf course it stays between us.\u201d</p><p>He almost grinned at her vehemence. \u201cI figured it would.\u201d He had known it would.</p><p>\u201cSo you blame yourself for your mother and wife\u2019s death?\u201d</p><p>Violet eyes darkened. Zeke could see the conflicting emotions that raged in her eyes and felt his heart clench. There was no recrimination in her gaze, only acceptance and trust.</p><p>He shook his head at the sight of it.</p><p>\u201cDamn, you\u2019re too trusting,\u201d he said mockingly. \u201cI was the reason for it, Rogue. I fucked up, it\u2019s that simple. Somehow, I managed to ask the wrong question of the wrong person. They found out what I was doing and they struck back. The head of the League is behind bars now, but that killer is still out there. I don\u2019t have proof yet, but I know in my gut that he killed Joe and Jaime, and I suspect he killed Callie Walker.</p><p>There are too many similarities to their murders and the murders that man has committed over the years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen this has something to do with what happened last year as well? When the Mackays and Cranston arrested the homeland terrorists?\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019d wondered. I knew Joe and Jaime were close with the Mackays, but I wasn\u2019t certain if they were supplying them with information or not. Jonesy and I wondered about it, but they never said anything and I didn\u2019t ask. But I knew they had connections to some of the suspects.</p><p>They worked for Dayle for a while, and they were friends with several of the men arrested.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Jonesy isn\u2019t to know anything else,\u201d he warned her. \u201cNot until I know for certain who is who and talks where.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t piss me off, Zeke. I know how to keep my mouth shut,\u201d she warned him.</p><p>\u201cAnd I know how to protect you now,\u201d he promised her. \u201cI won\u2019t let you get hurt by this, Rogue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut we\u2019re responsible for ourselves, Zeke.\u201d She sighed. \u201cIf I was frightened by someone who showed up at my door, then I\u2019d take the necessary steps to protect myself. That would be common sense, wouldn\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>He wondered if any other woman would have thought of that. He wished he had thought of it then, perhaps so many things would have been different. But it wasn\u2019t different, and Rogue shouldn\u2019t have to protect herself.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said gently as he let the backs of his fingers caress over her bruised cheek. \u201cIt would be my place to protect you.\u201d</p><p>And that was how Elaina had felt. It was his place to make certain she was protected so she could enjoy her life as she pleased.</p><p>\u201cLook, stud, I don\u2019t need you to protect li\u2019l ole me,\u201d she informed him testily. \u201cI\u2019ve been doing just fine for the past five years, and I\u2019m quite certain I\u2019ll continue doing so on my own. It\u2019s not your place to pave my way with bubble wrap, okay?\u201d</p><p>No, it wasn\u2019t okay, because Zeke knew she had no idea what they could be facing.</p><p>Death could come around any corner, and she wouldn\u2019t be prepared for it. And if the killer\u2019s trend continued, then eventually, Rogue would be targeted, if she wasn\u2019t already. She was close to Joe, Jaime, and their grandmother. She was also close to him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my place to take care of you.\u201d He cupped the back of her neck, holding her head in place as he relished the feel of her silken flesh against his fingertips and the way she seemed to push closer to his touch.</p><p>Her violet gaze was dark with emotion as he held her in place.</p><p>\u201cYou just keep thinking that, Zeke,\u201d she said mockingly. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll even let you believe it, when it suits me.\u201d</p><p>He almost laughed. Damn her, she shouldn\u2019t have the ability to make him laugh when he was facing more emotional upheaval than he had ever known in his life.</p><p>\u201cBrat.\u201d His head lowered, his lips whispered over hers.</p><p>\u201cStud,\u201d she drawled as her lips parted and she pressed closer.</p><p>Zeke started with small, sipping kisses. His lips tugged at her lower one, his tongue stroked over it as he felt her hands against his bare chest. Her fingers stretched out, touched tentatively, then curled against the hair-roughened flesh of his chest. Delicate nails rasped over his flesh, and a small, feminine moan left her lips as his settled more firmly over them.</p><p>She was sweet and hot and as addictive as hell. Damn, he\u2019d missed her in the bed last night, ached for her. She was like a ray of sunshine, and she hadn\u2019t spilled into his life all day. That was uncalled for, he decided. He had to have a taste of her, morning, noon, and night.</p><p>What the hell made him think he could do without her? he wondered as he pulled her closer and groaned at the taste of her kiss. There was no way in hell he could bear for her to leave his life, not when he was just beginning to learn what having her meant.</p><p>Not when he was learning, with each new touch, her effect on his own sexuality.</p><p>He wanted to cherish this kiss, he wanted to make it last for an eternity, but she went to his head faster than moonshine. She made him drunk on his own lust, made him crazy to have her in so many ways. In every way possible.</p><p>Rogue trembled from the sheer power of Zeke\u2019s kiss. She leaned in closer to him, let her fingertips rake over the hard, muscular line of his chest and let herself drown in the pleasure building inside her.</p><p>There was a different element to his touch this time. His hands were just as firm, his kiss just as hot, but each touch, each fractured breath of sound seemed more intense now, sharper, darker.</p><p>Her hands smoothed from his chest to his shoulders, her fingers gripping the hard muscles there as she felt the clamoring sensations bombarding her now. His kiss was hungrier, rougher. Sensation rioted through her as his tongue plunged past her lips and found her own. She tasted him, reveled in him. His taste was completely male, rife with lust, with passion. It seared her lips, it seared her mind, and left her reaching, pressing tighter against him, desperate for more.</p><p>Her arms twined around his neck, her fingers gripping the back of his head as she fought to get closer, always closer.</p><p>\u201cThere you go, baby,\u201d he growled against her lips as she came to her knees and straddled his powerful thighs. \u201cSo sweet.\u201d</p><p>A cry tore from her lips as her head tipped back on her shoulders; the feel of his hands sliding beneath the long shirt to cup her ass held her enthralled. It felt so damned good.</p><p>The way his calloused hands cupped the curve of her butt and flexed into the muscle there. His fingertips rotated, caressed, pulled against the twin globes and sent a spike of heated pleasure burning into the hidden entrance there.</p><p>Writhing against him she could feel her breath panting from her lips, the tips of her breasts pressing into the material of the shirt as she rubbed against his chest like a cat.</p><p>\u201cDamn, there you go, darlin\u2019,\u201d he crooned. \u201cGo wild for me, Rogue. Let me feel you lose yourself, baby.\u201d</p><p>She had lost herself with his first kiss. She lost herself in the sensations pouring over her and the heart- melting emotions she couldn\u2019t escape, no matter how hard she tried.</p><p>Loving Zeke Mayes could be a dead-end street. It could be the most painful lesson of her entire life. She knew it, and she was walking into it with her eyes wide open.</p><p>Well, figuratively wide open. At the moment they were closed. Her hips churned against him, broken cries falling from her lips as she pressed against the hard ridge of his cock with desperate strokes of her silk- covered pussy. Her clit was swollen, throbbing in need. Her vagina was spilling its slick dampness, and she had no will to fight it.</p><p>\u201cSweet Rogue.\u201d His hands slid over her ass, along her sides, then cupped the swollen mounds of her breasts. Calloused thumbs flicked over her engorged nipples and sent a flurry of sensation to strike at her clit.</p><p>She wanted it to last forever. She wanted the flames racing over her flesh to hold her spellbound for life. She didn\u2019t want it to end. She didn\u2019t want to chance ever losing this pleasure or this man.</p><p>\u201cHold on to me, Rogue.\u201d</p><p>He was lifting her, rising to his feet as she wrapped her legs around his hips and cried out at the feel of the hard ridge of his cock pressing tighter against her humid flesh. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThis is so good,\u201d she moaned as he walked. \u201cOh God, Zeke, its damned wicked.\u201d</p><p>Each step was agony, it was desire in its rawest form.</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t seen wicked yet,\u201d he promised her as he mounted the stairs, his hands moving to her ass again, cupping the cheeks and holding her to him as he moved up the steps.</p><p>Each step raked fiery sensations across her clit and drove fragmented arcs of sensation throughout her body.</p><p>It should be illegal to give this much pleasure, she thought. There should be a law against warping a woman\u2019s mind until nothing mattered but one man\u2019s touch.</p><p>As he carried her, she made it a mission to ensure that he was just as crazed from her touch. Her lips moved over the side of his neck as she ignored his groan for mercy. Her teeth raked over his pulse, then her lips settled at the base of his neck, parted, and she drew a small bite of tough skin into her mouth for a sizzling little nip.</p><p>She had carried his brand more than once; now he could carry hers.</p><p>She was surprised as one hand jerked from her butt. His palm covered the back of her head and a strangled groan left his lips as he seemed to stumble against the wall.</p><p>Rogue tightened her legs around his hips and kept her lips at his neck. She licked, nipped, and suckled delicately at the masculine flesh as she heard him curse, then whisper her name as though on a prayer.</p><p>\u201cI should spank you for what you do to me.\u201d His voice was dark and rough as he moved into a bedroom.</p><p>\u201cPromises, promises,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>A second later Rogue felt her back meet the mattress, though she refused to release the hold she had on him. Her hips lifted and she ground herself against his erection. A gasp of agonized need left her throat at the pure sensual pleasure that raged from the action.</p><p>\u201cGet this damned shirt off.\u201d He forced her arms down as he leaned back and ripped buttons and all.</p><p>\u201cYou like tearing my clothes,\u201d she gasped.</p><p>\u201cI want you naked. Naked and ready for me. Besides, it\u2019s my shirt,\u201d he reminded her, his gaze going over her breasts as they rose and fell with each desperate breath she tried to take.</p><p>Evidently, he didn\u2019t care if she breathed or not. His head lowered and Rogue watched, suspended, held in a vortex of pleasure as his lips descended, parted, and sucked a tight, hard nipple into the hot, damp cavern of his mouth.</p><p>Arching, she cried out at the pleasure. It whipped its way across her nerve endings, sent jagged forks of heat racing across her flesh.</p><p>Tightening her legs around his hips, she lifted closer to the erection throbbing beneath his jeans and dug her nails into his scalp as he ground against her.</p><p>There was nothing like being held against him, feeling his touch, losing herself in the pleasure. He caressed each nipple, sucked it deliciously, and reduced her to begging for his possession.</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d he growled long moments later as he pulled her legs from around his waist.</p><p>His fingers hooked in the elastic band of her panties as he pulled back from her and stripped the fragile material from her legs before dropping it to the floor.</p><p>Anticipation and sexual awareness sizzled in the air now. Rogue felt perspiration dampening her flesh, sizzling over her skin as he straightened at the side of the bed and lowered his hands to the band of his jeans.</p> <p>He disposed of his jeans quickly, efficiently, and within seconds stood before her, naked and aroused. Rogue could feel anticipation like a physical caress as he watched her, his eyes narrowed, one hand gripping the stalk of his cock as his expression tightened with hunger.</p><p>\u201cSpread your legs for me,\u201d he ordered, his voice rough.</p><p>Rogue spread her legs slowly, watching him as excitement flooded her body. In that moment she realized how much he meant to her, and it terrified her. She should have run from him; she should have pushed him out of her life rather than giving him the opportunity to hurt her more.</p><p>But she couldn\u2019t run. She couldn\u2019t say no. Because she needed him more than she had ever wanted to admit.</p><p>\u201cHave mercy,\u201d he growled, his gaze centered between her thighs as he moved between her legs, his broad shoulders pushing them farther apart as he stretched out below her.</p><p>\u201cSweet, sweet Rogue. You\u2019ll be the death of me.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t have time to argue the statement. Rogue\u2019s head tilted back on a strangled cry as his lips lowered to the wet flesh between her thighs. Hot and voracious, he consumed her from the first lick. His tongue swirled around her clit, licked at the overly sensitive folds and sent her flying into a pleasure she couldn\u2019t deny if she wanted to.</p><p>The rush of pleasure was intoxicating. Her legs fell farther apart as her fingernails dug into his scalp. The sensations were overwhelming, thundering through her veins.</p><p>Nothing mattered but holding him to her, feeling him, touching him.</p><p>\u201cZeke, please,\u201d she whispered as the pleasure began to build and tighten between her thighs.</p><p>\u201cOh, you please me very much,\u201d he promised before his lips pursed over her clit and gave her a sucking little kiss.</p><p>Her hips arched as excruciating pleasure tore through her from the caress.</p><p>\u201cEasy, baby,\u201d he crooned as he lifted his head. \u201cJust feel good for me.\u201d</p><p>His lips returned, another kiss, the feel of his fingers easing through her juices, moving lower, lower, then touching, caressing the entrance to her rear.</p><p>Sensation whipped through her; it drove white-hot spikes of pleasure through her clit, her womb. Heat whipped through her, bonded her to him.</p><p>His fingers were as wicked as his mouth. He drew her dampness from her pussy back to the tiny entrance of her rear. He stroked, he massaged, then one broad finger slid inside her, stretching the opening and sending flares of heat racing through her.</p><p>She wanted more. Needed more. She could feel her mind dissolving as she cried out, arched, and drove his finger deeper only to cry out in protest as he retreated.</p><p>\u201cTurn over, Rogue.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t give her time to turn. Before she could catch her breath he rose between her thighs, gripped her hips, and turned her to her stomach.</p><p>Rogue felt the hands at her hips pulling her to her knees.</p><p>His hand smoothed over her rear, then landed in a series of small, heated taps that had her shuddering, shaking from need as he used the fingers of his other hand to lubricate and stretch her rear.</p><p>She was panting for breath, feeling the burning stretch of his fingers, the tension in the air, the hunger that seemed to sear every inch of her flesh.</p><p>She was crying out his name, lost in sensation, lost in the pure dominance of what he was doing. The significance of the act swirled through her head. A sense of submission, of bonding wove silk-covered chains through her psyche.</p><p>When she felt the broad head of his cock against the opening she stilled, barely able to breathe now and definitely unable to protest.</p><p>\u201cAre you mine, Rogue?\u201d His hand smoothed over her rear before he used both hands to part the cheeks of her.</p><p>\u201cAre you mine?\u201d Her voice was strangled, the need to own as much of him as he owned of her tearing inside her.</p><p>\u201cAlways yours now, Rogue.\u201d His voice was heavy as he held her still and pressed inside her. \u201cAll of me, Rogue. Take all of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh God, Zeke.\u201d Her back arched as burning pleasure tore through her. Her rear parted beneath the pressure as jagged lightning-hot sensations began to race through the nerve endings there.</p><p>She thought the pleasure couldn\u2019t become more brutal. She thought she had experienced everything she could know about the extremity of sensation.</p><p>When the broad head popped inside the tender entrance, Zeke paused. She was lost in the flames of that small penetration when she felt another one.</p><p>\u201cZeke!\u201d She tried to scream his name, but the breathless sound was more of a weak plea.</p><p>She felt the vibration of the vibrator tuck against the entrance to her pussy. Felt his wrist moving against her thigh as he impaled her slowly with it.</p><p>\u201cThere, baby,\u201d he crooned behind her as the toy slid slowly inside her, parting her, working every nerve ending with an insidious, buzzing caress.</p><p>When it was lodged fully inside her she thought she was going insane from the pleasure. The vibration of the toy inside her set mini-explosions off inside her nerve endings. Her pussy flexed around it, her rear tightened around the intrusion easing inside it. She was a singular mass of sensation and she was drowning in the pleasure-pain filling her.</p><p>\u201cEasy,\u201d Zeke groaned behind her.</p><p>Easy? She didn\u2019t want easy. She wanted it all.</p><p>\u201cHere, baby.\u201d He grabbed her arm, eased it down until her hand was between her thighs. \u201cHold it inside you.\u201d</p><p>Rogue whimpered at the demand as her fingers curled around the heavy base. He pressed her hand forward, pushing the toy fully inside her until the thick, rough extension that rose from the base began to massage her clit.</p><p>She lost her mind, her senses. Sensation tore through her as Zeke began to move behind her. His hands gripped her hips; his cock surged into her ass as he began to fuck her with long, even strokes. She was filled, stretched, burning, and aware of each and every stroke against nerve endings that were too sensitive to bear the pleasure for long.</p><p>Her pussy was filled, stretched tight with the buzzing toy. Her ass was on fire from the heavy strokes he was pounding into her now. She could feel every pulsing throb of his erection, each thick vein that ran the length of it.</p><p>Her head dug into the mattress as his hands tightened on her hips, and she felt the pleasure begin to build to critical mass inside her.</p><p>Every bone and muscle in her body began to tighten. She lost control of her senses, of her body. Fiery flames raced over her flesh and exploded in her womb as a long, agonized wail left her mouth.</p><p>Shock waves of destructive ecstasy flamed out of control and tore through her sensitive flesh as pinpoints of sensation ruptured inside her.</p><p>She screamed his name, the muscles of her rear tightened, trying to lock his erection inside her. Her pussy clenched on the vibrator, tightened. Her clit exploded in a cataclysm of sensation that raced to her pussy, her womb, and every point beyond as she heard him cry out her name.</p><p>He thrust inside her hard and deep, his hands tightened on her, the hard muscles of his thighs pressed into the backs of her legs, and within seconds she felt his release.</p><p>The feel of each shockingly heated spurt of semen inside her threw her higher, harder into the maelstrom of rapture.</p><p>She was flying through space and time, locked in a pleasure so intense she wondered if her heart could bear it.</p><p>Her back arched, her nails dug into the blankets, and finally, with one last powerful explosion inside her, she was flung into a place where only heat and pleasure resided.</p><p>Where she knew nothing, felt nothing but the sensation coursing through her.</p><p>She was left shaking, trembling in exhaustion when it was finished. She had collapsed to the bed. Zeke covered her, still buried inside her, his lips at her neck, his groans still filling her ears.</p><p>His hands still gripped her hips, his lips were pressed into her neck, his kiss as fierce as the hold he had on her.</p><p>\u201cGod, yes,\u201d he groaned. \u201cAh God, Rogue.\u201d</p><p>His voice was tormented, breathless. Behind her, his chest rose and fell harshly against her back as her flesh spasmed in pleasure around his cock and the erotic toy still pressed inside her.</p><p>At least the vibrator wasn\u2019t buzzing any longer. At some point he must have turned it off. Damned good thing he had, because she doubted she had the mental capacity to do it.</p><p>But she had emotional capacity. Her heart, her soul, and she knew she had just given both to Zeke.</p><p>EIGHTEEN</p><p>She was going to destroy him. That was the singularthought in his head as Zeke carefully covered Rogue with a blanket after she slipped into an exhausted slumber. She slept as deeply as a child, curled up in the center of the bed. Red gold lashes feathered her cheeks, her pink lips free of lipstick, her face free of makeup, she looked like some innocent little fairy come to tempt his mind to insanity. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She was doing a damned good job of making him crazy, too. Because he knew he wouldn\u2019t let her go after tonight. She was his, and now she was going to have to deal with the man she had tempted from the darkness.</p><p>She could handle him, of that Zeke was certain. The problem was would she want to handle him once she learned the ground rules?</p><p>Checking to make certain she was sleeping deeply after their shower, he cleaned the vibrator he had placed in the drawer of his bedside table after she had been at the house the last time and returned it and the tube of lubricating gel into the drawer.</p><p>He had known it would come to this. He had known that when he got her in his bed, where that loss of control would lead to.</p> <p>After kissing her brow gently, he dressed and left the house. It was still dark, though dawn wasn\u2019t far away. Which meant he didn\u2019t have much time to do what he needed to do.</p><p>He was in control now, but he hadn\u2019t maintained his control earlier. He had known the moment he bared her pretty ass to his gaze that he was severely out of control. Thank God that she hadn\u2019t realized the line he had been riding. But he had known. He had known and he hadn\u2019t been able to pull himself back from the brink.</p><p>It had been all he could do not to spank her as he wanted to, and that was only because he had been so desperate to test her sexual submission to him.</p><p>She was innocent, as of days ago, a virgin. She wouldn\u2019t have known the implications of what he was doing to her, and she shouldn\u2019t have accepted it so easily. There should have been a measure of fear, of wariness from her. He had expected to have to ease her, gentle her. Instead, she had lifted that pert little butt right up to him and invited him to do his worst.</p><p>He wiped his hand over his face as he started the truck\u2019s engine and reversed out of the driveway. She had taken a part of him that night that he didn\u2019t think he would ever be able to give a woman. She had stolen his heart when he had believed he didn\u2019t have a heart to steal.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t just the sex or her submission to it. It wasn\u2019t any one thing, Zeke realized. It was the realization at the moment he had taken her that she didn\u2019t just belong to him, but he belonged to her. Because in all the years that he had known of the dark sexual core he possessed, he had never known a woman like Rogue.</p><p>She was adventurous, wild as the wind, but steady, honorable. She was a woman that would love a man with every ounce of her heart, and he knew she loved him. It had been in her eyes, in her sighs, in every response she had given to every touch he had bestowed.</p><p>She was his, and protecting her was his right, ensuring that she was never, ever harmed was his privilege. Making certain he never lost her because of the job that meant so much to him was imperative.</p><p>That part would be harder than what he was setting out to do tonight. Tonight, he would make certain one particular man understood that he was never to lay his hands on her again.</p><p>Keeping control when he had driven up on the scene had nearly been impossible.</p><p>Giving in to her demands that he release Jonesy had been even harder. But he had realized something about Rogue a long time ago. She would lay down her own life for a friend; she had proved that when she had defended Shane and lost her own reputation.</p> <p>He wasn\u2019t going to risk such a confrontation, especially in public, over Jonesy.</p><p>No, he would take care of Jonesy privately, just between the two of them while Rogue slept.</p><p>It didn\u2019t take more than a half hour to arrive at the Bar. It was close to four in the morning now, but Jonesy\u2019s truck was still in the parking lot, as Zeke knew it would be.</p><p>The bartender was usually in the bar until daylight, leaving just as the sun peeked over the horizon and didn\u2019t return until just before the evening shift. His assistant bartenders along with Rogue opened the bar at five every evening except Sunday.</p><p>He pulled his truck into the front lot and shut off the engine before leaving the vehicle.</p><p>The front door was locked until Zeke strode up to it and pounded on the heavy panel.</p><p>He didn\u2019t have to wait long before it was pushed open and Jonesy stepped outside, his expression wary. Bald and heavily muscled, Jonesy was a bull of a man that most men were uncertain of antagonizing.</p><p>Zeke intended to do more than antagonize him.</p> <p>\u201cChange your mind about arrestin\u2019 me?\u201d Jonesy\u2019s broad face twisted into a sneer as he faced Zeke, his heavy fists clenching. \u201cAin\u2019t you scared Rogue might cry a little bit if you do?\u201d</p><p>A hard laugh left the bartender\u2019s throat at the statement. As though the thought of Rogue crying amused him. It sent a spurt of pure undiluted rage building inside him.</p><p>\u201cWhether or not Rogue sheds tears over you isn\u2019t what concerns me, Jonesy,\u201d Zeke drawled. \u201cThe bruises you left on her arm tonight does.\u201d</p><p>For a moment there was a flicker of regret in the bartender\u2019s eyes. It was gone just as quickly and replaced with a hateful sneer.</p><p>\u201cShe don\u2019t ever listen to reason,\u201d he bit out furiously. \u201cThat girl waded right into that fight as though it was her business who was slingin\u2019 fists. Better a bruise on the arm from me than a snapped neck from someone else.\u201d</p><p>Like hell.</p><p>Zeke didn\u2019t intend to stand around arguing with the other man; he had come here for a reason.</p><p>\u201cThis makes the second time you\u2019ve laid your hand on what belongs to me,\u201d Zeke state softly. \u201cYou don\u2019t touch what\u2019s mine, Jonesy, not for any reason. No way, no how.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLast I heard no man had papers on that girl,\u201d Jonesy grunted. \u201cI been watching out for her for four years now. Where the hell were you when she needed someone at her back?</p><p>You were whorin\u2019, Sheriff. Sleeping with tramps and trash while I was watching after Rogue. Now you think you can waltz right in here and treat her like you treat your flybys? Not while I can still talk some sense into her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike one of my flybys?\u201d Zeke\u2019s eyes narrowed.</p><p>\u201cYeah, your fly-by-night little whores that you keep hanging on a string. You know, Sheriff, the ones you hide in the day and fuck at night? Or was I wrong about Rogue?</p><p>Maybe hangin\u2019 with that Walker trash has rubbed off on her after all.\u201d</p><p>That was it. Zeke saw the haze of red that descended over his eyes. Before he could hold back the impulse, adrenaline surged through his veins. His fist flew, collided with Jonesy\u2019s rock- hard jaw, and sent the other man careening into the side of the building.</p><p>Jonesy was a bull of a man. The hit that took him by surprise wasn\u2019t the only one it would take to make him realize who was the top dog in Rogue\u2019s life. Zeke would rather kill him, hell, he\u2019d rather lock him up and see him suffer, but he knew Rogue would never stand for it.</p><p>That meant going at it man to man.</p><p>The fight that ensued was one of the hardest fistfights Zeke had been in, possibly in his life. Jonesy\u2019s fists were like hams and slammed into flesh like bricks. Zeke\u2019s kidneys took a bruising and if Zeke wasn\u2019t mistaken, Jonesy may have lost a tooth.</p><p>\u201cYou bastard!\u201d Jonesy cursed when his fist missed Zeke\u2019s jaw.</p><p>A second later a strangled, \u201cFuck you!\u201d tore from Jonesy\u2019s lips as Zeke kicked him back against the cement wall of the bar.</p><p>Jonesy\u2019s nose was bleeding, his lips were split, there was a cut beneath his eye, and he was holding his stomach where Zeke had landed a hard kick only moments before.</p><p>Jonesy surged away from the wall. This time, his broad fist connected with Zeke\u2019s jaw, throwing him back as stars exploded before his eyes for precious seconds. It gave Jonesy the opening he needed to slam another fist into his kidneys and another hard right to his jaw.</p><p>Zeke buried his fist in Jonesy\u2019s gut, threw him back, slammed his fist into his stomach again, his jaw, and another to his kidneys.</p><p>The bartender went to his knees, coughing, wheezing as he held his stomach.</p><p>\u201cTouch her again, and next time, you\u2019ll spend time behind bars,\u201d Zeke warned him, his own breathing rough, tearing in his chest as he dragged Jonesy up by the torn collar of his shirt and threw him back up against the wall. \u201cDo you understand me, Jonesy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t hurt her,\u201d Jonesy coughed roughly. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t hurt Rogue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you understand me?\u201d He slammed Jonesy\u2019s head against the wall. \u201cAnswer me, damn you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t hurt her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said you don\u2019t touch her again. Ever,\u201d Zeke snarled.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know about you, Zeke, but I think he understands now.\u201d</p><p>Zeke froze at the sound of Rogue\u2019s voice behind him. He could feel his stomach tighten now with a sense of dread. Hell, she was supposed to be at home asleep.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re fucked,\u201d Jonesy wheezed out a whisper, his eyes widening as he stared back at Zeke. \u201cShit. Damn. She\u2019s gonna de-ball us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet him go, Zeke.\u201d Her voice was soft, the enunciation of each word carefully precise.</p><p>Zeke eased his grip on Jonesy\u2019s shirt, grimaced, and once again met Jonesy\u2019s gaze.</p><p>\u201cStay out of this,\u201d he warned the bartender softly.</p><p>\u201cWay out.\u201d Jonesy nodded quickly. \u201cSo far out I\u2019m just a memory.\u201d</p><p>This was bad and Zeke knew it. He clenched his teeth, exhaled, then turned to face the wrath of Rogue.</p><p>A cab was pulling out of the parking lot behind her. She stood there, dressed in the leather skirt she had worn the night before and his white shirt. The shirt hung below the skirt and made the black platform heels look even more wicked than they had before.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re supposed to be at the house,\u201d he said, keeping his voice firm, even. \u201cI left you there for a reason.\u201d</p><p>She looked around him where the entrance door to the bar slammed closed behind Jonesy. Jonesy was running like a rat off a sinking ship.</p><p>\u201cSo you could beat up my friend?\u201d Anger glittered in her eyes and flushed her face as she moved slowly toward him, each step slow and careful.</p><p>Wild, waist-length red gold curls swirled around her in the early dawn light. Violet eyes glittered with fury in her pale face.</p><p>She looked like an enraged fairy intent on murder and mayhem. And it was his ass she was intent on murdering.</p><p>\u201cSo I could come to an understanding with your friend,\u201d he told her, wiping his mouth with his arm as he moved, striding toward her and gripping her arm in a firm hold.</p><p>\u201cLet me go!\u201d She jerked at his hold, her expression twisting with fury. \u201cDon\u2019t even try to touch me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUpstairs.\u201d Zeke hardened his voice as he pulled her to the door Jonesy had gone through earlier. \u201cNow. I\u2019m not going to fight with you in the parking lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not, you fought Jonesy in the parking lot,\u201d she screamed back at him, trying to kick out at him as he pulled her to the entrance. \u201cYou can damned well fight me here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJonesy is a whole other matter, Rogue.\u201d Zeke tamped down the frustration rising inside him. He kept his control firmly in place. The situation with Jonesy was resolved as far as he was concerned. Man to man. He had a feeling Jonesy wouldn\u2019t forget the consequences of manhandling Rogue again.</p><p>Zeke would have preferred to see the bastard fired, but until Rogue was fed up with the other man\u2019s attitude, the only thing Zeke could do was keep a close eye on the situation.</p><p>And an even closer eye on Rogue. If she didn\u2019t end up killing him before the day was over.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve gone too far this time, Zeke,\u201d she cried out as he kept his fingers locked around her wrist and all but dragged her through the bar. \u201cThis was none of your business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s where you\u2019re wrong. When another man dares to lay a hand on my woman, it\u2019s very much my damned business,\u201d he growled.</p><p>He wouldn\u2019t have it. Possessive tendencies aside, Zeke wouldn\u2019t have stood for any man to handle a woman as Jonesy had Rogue, at any time. Jonesy wasn\u2019t behind bars simply because of Rogue\u2019s interference. Any other man would have been cooling his heels in the detention center. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAnd who says I\u2019m your woman?\u201d she snarled back at him as they moved through the private door and took the turn to the stairs and her apartment above. \u201cI don\u2019t remember giving you permission to go Neanderthal on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure you did,\u201d he drawled as they reached the landing and he tested the doorknob.</p><p>Son of a bitch, she\u2019d left the door unlocked again. He turned and stared down at her.</p> <p>\u201cWhat did I tell you about locking your door up here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me, Zeke, but I was unaware I\u2019d be spending the night elsewhere,\u201d she snapped.</p><p>He shook his head at the apparent lack of judgment she had used.</p><p>Rogue wanted to smack the condescension from his face. She would have to get her wrist back first. She tugged at it again as he pushed the door open slowly and checked out the living area of the large apartment.</p><p>Hell, he should have brought his weapon with him.</p> <p>\u201cYou are being so overprotective, Zeke. Have I mentioned how much I hate being protected?\u201d</p><p>Rogue watched as Zeke moved away from her. She crossed her arms over her breasts as she glared at him hatefully.</p><p>How dare he start a fight with her bartender, over her? It was her fight; she didn\u2019t need his big male fists taking care of her business for her.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care how much you hate it,\u201d he stated as he moved through the living and kitchen area and entered her bedroom.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t care how much I hate it?\u201d She gaped at his back as it disappeared through the doorway before she moved quickly to catch up with him. \u201cWhat the hell are you doing searching my apartment, and what do you mean, you don\u2019t care how much I hate it?\u201d</p><p>He paused as he stepped out of the bathroom and stared back at her with those predatory, determined eyes of his. That look, so dominant and forceful, should have had her rage hitting to peak rather than sparking memories of the time they had spent in his bed throughout the night and the forceful sexuality he had displayed.</p> <p>\u201cI mean, it\u2019s too damned late to jump out of the game.\u201d His voice was forceful, dark. \u201cI warned you, you were getting into something you might not be able to handle, Rogue.</p><p>Now you\u2019ll just have to learn how to deal with it. What Jonesy did was out of line and you refused to fire him, so I took care of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy beating him half to death? By letting him beat on you?\u201d</p><p>Blood marred his chin and jaw, his shirt was torn, and he was going to have a black eye.</p><p>Rogue had had to curl her fingers into fists when she had first seen the damage. They had stayed curled, waiting on an opportunity to add her own bruise to his hard, stubborn expression.</p><p>His lip was swelling and she was betting his ribs were already bruising. Not that he looked or acted as though he had so much as a scratch. His shoulders were straight and arrogance was stamped thick and clear on his expression.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a male thing.\u201d He shrugged.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a male thing? A male thing?\u201d Incredulity filled her as she stared back at him. \u201cYou went completely Neanderthal because it was a male thing?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t take care of the situation and fire his ass, thereby eliminating the risk of him further abusing you, so I took care of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou took care of it?\u201d She blinked back at him. She couldn\u2019t believe the utter audacity it took for him to say such a thing. \u201cIs this how you take care of domestic squabbles, too, Zeke? Just beat the hell out of any man that doesn\u2019t do as you think he should?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on duty then.\u201d His smile was tight. \u201cI wasn\u2019t on duty this morning. What\u2019s more, the fact that you\u2019re my woman changes those rules. I took care of what\u2019s mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God,\u201d she gasped. \u201cYou\u2019ve lost your mind.\u201d</p><p>She stared back at him, amazed, bemused as he stalked slowly toward her. There was something about the move and shift of his body now. An aura of sex and danger that seemed to fill the room and surround her as she backed away from him. \u201cYou did not buy me. You don\u2019t own me. You are a crazy man.\u201d</p><p>He smiled, a slow arrogant curl of his lips. \u201cI bet your panties are wet, Rogue. I bet you\u2019re so damned turned on right now that a good hard breath would get you off.\u201d</p><p>He was so right.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve lost your mind,\u201d she accused him as her back met the wall.</p><p>\u201cYour pussy is hot and wet,\u201d he growled. \u201cCome on, Rogue, tell me it\u2019s not.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, wishing she could ignore the weakness in her knees, the tingling between her thighs.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re bloody, bruised, and arrogant,\u201d she snapped back. \u201cThat is not a turn-on, Zeke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiar.\u201d Black velvet and sex, his voice was rasping, primal. It sent a heat wave crashing through her body.</p><p>Rogue swallowed tightly. The wall was at her back; Zeke was a wall barely pressing against her breasts. Her nipples hardened, sensitized as his chest brushed against her, stimulating them further as his hands braced against the wall, bracketing her in.</p><p>\u201cWhat is your problem?\u201d She wished her voice didn\u2019t sound so weak. She wished she kept the anger burning rather than the arousal, but it was the arousal, the hunger, spurred by the complete dominance he was displaying, that took precedence.</p><p>\u201cMy problem?\u201d His eyes narrowed, dark brown lashes shielding his thoughts, his emotions as he moved one hand from the wall beside her and brushed his knuckles down the exposed line of her throat. \u201cMy problem is a hard-on that only you can satisfy.</p><p>My problem is the fact that I tried, Rogue, to stay away from you. I tried to warn you that you were dealing with something you might not be prepared to handle. But did you listen?\u201d He brushed a whispery kiss beside her lips and nearly stole her breath with the caress.</p><p>What the hell was wrong with her? She would have slammed her knee into the balls of any other man who dared to attempt to dominate her. She didn\u2019t consider herself submissive, but right now, she felt so feminine, so much weaker than Zeke, and yet so much a part of him, that she didn\u2019t know what else to call it.</p><p>Were women somehow programmed to at least sexual submission? Was it a part of their genetic makeup, the need to be conquered sexually, to be protected?</p><p>\u201cThis is crazy,\u201d she gasped as his lips slid from the corner of hers and moved to her jawline.</p><p>Her head rested back against the wall and tilted to the side to expose the sensitive underside of her jaw. Weakening pleasure flowed through her body. It thundered in her veins, raced over her nerve endings, then centered in her pussy where it turned into a blazing ache.</p><p>\u201cThis is because of your wife,\u201d she breathed out roughly. \u201cYou lost her. You think you have to protect me. I won\u2019t have it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t about anyone but you.\u201d He nipped her jawline. \u201cJust me and you, Rogue.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head desperately as his lips slid along her neck, spreading fire along her flesh as she fought to find the strength to tear away from him.</p><p>\u201cYou gave yourself to me.\u201d His teeth raked over her collarbone.</p><p>\u201cMy body,\u201d she protested.</p><p>\u201cYour heart.\u201d His voice rumbled as he forged a path to the valley of her breasts, brushing aside the cotton material of the shirt, and lifted one hand to palm a swollen mound of her breast.</p><p>Sensation was building inside her again. She had just had him, no more than a few hours ago, yet her body was weakening, softening, needing him.</p><p>And he was right, she had given him her heart.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t give you my freedom,\u201d she panted, trying to find some fragile threat of independence. Surely there was some lingering shred of independence inside her somewhere?</p><p>His head lifted as he gripped the sides of the shirt and tore it apart. Buttons were scattering as his lips stole hers in a kiss that she was certain fried any ability she could have had to speak, let alone think.</p><p>His tongue delved between her lips, tangled with hers, and the taste of him went to her head with the same force as a narcotic. He was inside her, so much a part of her that she didn\u2019t know how to fight him.</p><p>Her arms wrapped around his neck as she gave in to the kiss. A part of her knew he was right. Jonesy had a temper that she had always pampered and had to watch out for. He only really respected men willing to put up their fists.</p><p>It grated on her pride. But pride was a weak ideal when Zeke seemed to wrap around her. When he was kissing her as though he were drowning in her. Despite the split lip and the bruises she knew must be marring his body, still his lips slanted over hers as his broad hands cupped her rear and lifted her to him.</p><p>\u201cTell me you belong to me.\u201d He nipped her lips, then licked the heat of the rough caress away. \u201cNow, Rogue. Tell me you\u2019re mine.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head as his head lifted and he stared down at her with predatory intent.</p><p>\u201cBut you are.\u201d His lips slid to her ear. \u201cMine to hold, to protect.\u201d</p><p>But was she his to love? The thought whispered through her mind, then evaporated as he turned her, his hands smoothing up her arms and flattening her palms against the wall.</p><p>\u201cZeke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, baby.\u201d Her hair was swept to the side, his lips tasting her neck, spreading heated kisses along the sensitive column as his hands cupped her breasts.</p><p>He palmed the sensitive mounds; his fingers rubbed over her nipples before he encased them in two fingers, working them gently. Waves of incredible pleasure began washing through her. Rogue tipped her head back against his chest, a moan parting her lips.</p><p>\u201cYou burn me alive,\u201d he whispered against her ear as he moved one hand from her breasts.</p><p>She could feel him behind her, working his jeans loose, releasing the heavy length of his erection, and she whimpered in longing.</p><p>\u201cI have a bed,\u201d she panted, though the thought of moving at the moment wasn\u2019t high on her list of priorities.</p><p>\u201cWho needs a bed? Fuck, Rogue, I don\u2019t think I can wait that long.\u201d</p><p>She felt his knees dip as his arm slid around her hips, lifting her and holding her in place as he pressed her legs apart with his foot.</p><p>\u201cDamn, gotta love those high heels,\u201d he groaned as she felt the head of his cock press against her, hot and iron hard.</p><p>Dizzying weakness flooded her, pleasure overcame any objections she could have even thought to have as she felt the slow, stretching impalement of her pussy. A strangled cry left her throat, heat flushed her, inside and out.</p><p>It was a damned good thing he was holding her, because she would have melted to the floor otherwise. Violent pleasure tore through her as his erection worked inside her.</p><p>Slow, torturously so as her slick juices flowed around him.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t stand it,\u201d she panted. Because it was too good. Because there was something about this position, about having him behind her, controlling her responses, her movements, that made her feel more fragile, more feminine than ever before.</p><p>\u201cShould I stop, Rogue?\u201d He paused, buried to the hilt inside her now, throbbing and thick, filling her and stealing her senses with a pleasure she couldn\u2019t fight. \u201cTell me to stop, Rogue, and I will.\u201d</p><p>Her fingers curled into fists against the wall as she felt perspiration gathering along her body. Her skirt was pushed to her hips, his shirt slid over her shoulders and hung at the bend of her arms. It was decadent, wicked. The position, her half-clothed state, and the feel of him inside her added to the sensations rioting through her.</p><p>How could she ever live without him now? How could she survive without the feel of him taking her, possessing her?</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t stop.\u201d Her lashes drifted closed as she allowed her head to rest against his shoulder. \u201cPlease, Zeke. Don\u2019t stop.\u201d</p><p>He moved. A slow, gliding retreat, then a hard, fierce thrust that had her back arching and a strangling cry falling from her lips.</p><p>He gripped her hips with both hands now, holding her in place, holding her up as he began fucking her with hard, even strokes. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Rogue became lost in the pleasure, in the lightning-swift explosions of heat that began to race through her system. The slap of his flesh against hers, the scent and sound of sex surrounding her, his harsh breathing at her ear. It combined to begin that sharp, desperate rise to release that was both ecstatic and torturous.</p><p>She moved against him, thrusting back into each hard lunge of his cock inside her as she felt the pleasure tightening inside her, racing through her.</p><p>\u201cZeke, oh God. Don\u2019t stop,\u201d she whimpered, then cried out as his thrusts became harder, wilder.</p> <p>She felt his control shatter. She felt it in the slam of his erection inside her, the stroke of the hard flesh over brutally sensitive nerve endings. She felt it in the grip of his hands at her waist and heard his hard, rasping male groan as she felt the pleasure explode inside her.</p><p>She tried to scream his name but all that emerged was a breathless cry as she felt her vaginal muscles clench around him as her womb convulsed with her release. Sensation upon sensation detonated inside her, until she was shaking, sobbing, aware of nothing but Zeke, his touch, his heat as ecstatic pleasure surrounded her. She felt his release spurting inside her, liquid hot and consuming. She heard his groan as he buried his face at her neck and his hands flexed against her hips.</p><p>She was aware of nothing but the man and the pleasure. Brilliant pulses of heat were like electroshocks tearing through, shuddering through her body, leaving her breathless and weak as Zeke supported her, holding her between the wall and his body as he groaned her name and shuddered behind her.</p><p>Standing there, her legs rubbery, the pulses of pleasure still echoing through her, Rogue felt more than just the pleasure. She felt the emotion. She heard it in his rough groan at her ear, in the hard, desperate caresses of his lips against her neck. She felt his possession. She felt marked, on the inside, by a man she still wasn\u2019t certain how to read or how to predict.</p><p>But in those moments, his cock still buried inside her, his hands hard on her hips, his lips against her neck, she knew one thing. Zeke was right. She belonged irrevocably to him.</p> <p>Which left one all-important question. What would she do if or when he decided to move on?</p><p>The sun was high overhead when Zeke slipped from Rogue\u2019s bed and moved into the kitchen with his cell phone. Flipping it open he pressed speed dial and waited for the call to go through.</p><p>\u201cSheriff.\u201d Cranston sounded wide awake, while Zeke admitted his ass was starting to drag from a lack of sleep.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a bastard, Cranston.\u201d He sighed. \u201cYou\u2019ve pushed me out of the investigations you\u2019ve conducted here, and now I\u2019m fucked. I need your help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t push you out, Zeke,\u201d Cranston answered. \u201cI used you as effectively as I\u2019ve used the other tools I\u2019ve had at my disposal. That\u2019s my job. Too many eyes were watching you and a killer was just waiting on an excuse to take you or your son, or both, out. I couldn\u2019t afford that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you did it out of the kindness of your heart,\u201d Zeke snorted.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a heart,\u201d Cranston assured him. \u201cBut I do try to look at long-term goals rather than short term. Long term, you\u2019re more useful to me alive rather than dead.</p><p>Long term was, I knew the exterminator was out there and focused on you. If we didn\u2019t catch him in the first investigation, then I needed you in place. You\u2019re in place, he\u2019s killing again, and he\u2019s trying to get your attention with these murders, otherwise he would have changed his style enough to throw you off his scent. Now tell me what you need.\u201d</p><p>Zeke\u2019s lips thinned at the thought of how effectively Cranston really had used him.</p><p>\u201cAre you covering my back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe and three Mackays,\u201d Cranston admitted. \u201cNo one else. We\u2019re keeping this operation small and on a need-to-know basis. Chief Jansen has been informed of what\u2019s going on, but he\u2019s holding back for the present. Are you with the Walker girl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m distracted,\u201d he stated, knowing it was the damned truth. \u201cI want this taken care of this time. Shane\u2019s out of state, he left on a school trip a few days ago, so he\u2019s safe for the next week. I want that bastard caught.\u201d</p><p>Silence filled the line for long moments. \u201cA week will be cutting it close,\u201d he finally said.</p><p>\u201cA week,\u201d Zeke stated. \u201cHe\u2019ll use Shane against me if he gets scared I\u2019m getting too close. I\u2019ll continue the investigation from my end while keeping Rogue safe. You and the Mackays do whatever mumbo jumbo you do and let\u2019s get this taken care of.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd if it\u2019s Maynard?\u201d Cranston finally asked. \u201cI know he\u2019s your lead suspect, Zeke.</p><p>Are you looking beyond him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suspect everyone but Rogue,\u201d Zeke said softly, aware that this was the first time he had crossed any possibility off his list. \u201cNow let\u2019s do it. I\u2019ll play the distracted lover, you help me find a killer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good to be working with you again, Sheriff,\u201d Cranston replied a little gleefully.</p><p>\u201cDamned good.\u201d</p><p>Zeke just wished he felt as happy about the situation. As he glanced back at Rogue\u2019s closed bedroom door, he knew it could all backfire on him though. He could lose her.</p><p>And the thought of that had a dull ache centering in his chest and reminding him that for the first time in over ten years, he had a weakness other than his son.</p><p>For the first time in his life, he was afraid he might truly be falling in love.</p><p>NINETEEN</p><p>Zeke entered his office two days later to find the coronerJay Adams\u2019s report on Callie Walker\u2019s death. Joe and Jaime\u2019s grandmother hadn\u2019t died accidently. The blow she had received on the head had been delivered by a blunt object rather than the side of the bathtub as it had been made to appear.</p><p>The blow could have been fatal in time, but the cause of death had been drowning as she lay in the bathtub.</p><p>He read the report before breathing out roughly and shaking his head. The coroner had released the bodies for burial, and Lisa Walker had been notified.</p><p>He rubbed his hand over his head before taking the file and locking it in the file cabinet.</p><p>Joe and Jaime, and then their grandmother. A woman tied them together and Zeke was no closer to figuring out who that woman was than he had been the day of the twins\u2019</p><p>deaths, just as he, Cranston, or the Mackays were no closer to finding the killer.</p><p>He\u2019d questioned everyone he could think of to question. Even the Mackays had come up blank on the woman\u2019s identity. That didn\u2019t make sense. Pulaski County wasn\u2019t that large. It thrived on gossip as any small county did. Zeke bet he knew every lover, potential lover, or wannabe lover that Joe and Jaime could have had in their sexual lives. All but one. The one that had led to their deaths.</p><p>Or had she been the one to commit the murders?</p><p>The twins\u2019 phone records had revealed very little. They had no cell phones, so there were no records to trace there. There was just nothing left to go on except his gut-deep certainty that all three murders were linked.</p><p>At this point, there wasn\u2019t much more he could do without any leads. Lisa Walker had called earlier, informing him that she would be returning home unless he was close to an arrest. She had things to take care of, and her sons\u2019 father wanted the boys back in town. Lisa still had family here, too, her job, a life. She couldn\u2019t stay away indefinitely.</p><p>That was an additional worry. Whoever had killed the twins and their grandmother, Callie Walker, wouldn\u2019t hesitate to kill again. He had a feeling the murderer might have even enjoyed the elaborate game that had been made of the deaths, just as Cranston had suggested.</p><p>A knock at his office door had him moving from the file cabinet back to his desk as the door opened and his secretary peeked in.</p><p>\u201cZeke, you have a visitor.\u201d Kendal Birchfield arched her expressive brows as her blue eyes twinkled with amusement. \u201cMr. John Calvin Walker Jr. requests a few moments of your time.\u201d</p><p>Zeke\u2019s brows arched. John Calvin Walker Jr. It couldn\u2019t be anyone other than Calvin Walker\u2019s son.</p><p>Zeke grinned as he took his seat. \u201cI have a few minutes, Kendal. Show him in.\u201d</p><p>Kendal winked back at him playfully before closing the door. A few seconds later it opened it again and Mr. John Calvin Walker Jr. entered the room.</p><p>Zeke wasn\u2019t certain what he was expecting in the form of Rogue\u2019s brother. A polished Bostonian lawyer, perhaps. John Walker was known as a lawyer with teeth. He was picky about the cases he took, but the ones he took he rarely lost. Zeke\u2019s contacts in D.C.</p><p>had placed the younger man as an up-and-coming political force to be watched.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t the first impression Zeke had of him though. John Walker was dressed in jeans, a rumpled white cotton shirt, and well-worn boots. Zeke would have pegged him for a California surfer boy.</p><p>\u201cSheriff Mayes.\u201d Violet blue eyes were set behind thick blond lashes in a sun-darkened face. Overly long white blond hair fell almost to his shoulders and framed hard, slashing features.</p><p>The boy looked a lot like the father had when he was younger, except Calvin Walker had sported red hair rather than blond and had been broader, more muscular, where John Walker was leaner.</p><p>His handshake was firm and hinted at strength. His gaze was cool and determined, and Zeke understood why his contacts in D.C. foresaw a political future for this young man.</p><p>Zeke saw something that perhaps they didn\u2019t though. He saw a decided lack of true deception in the other man\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I do for you, Mr. Walker?\u201d Zeke held his hand out to the visitor\u2019s chair in front of his desk as he took his own seat.</p><p>John Walker sat, though he slouched with lazy negligence.</p><p>\u201cSo, you\u2019re the sheriff sleeping with my baby sister.\u201d John\u2019s smile was tight and hard. \u201cI was wondering what had Jonesy so worked up about you. I understand now.\u201d</p><p>Zeke leaned back in his chair and arched his brow. \u201cLast I heard Rogue was over twenty-one.\u201d</p><p>John\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cCaitlyn,\u201d he corrected softly. \u201cAnd she may be over twenty-one, but you, Sheriff Mayes, are nearly old enough to be her father.\u201d</p><p>Zeke stared back at him implacably, refusing to be drawn into whatever fight the younger Walker thought he was getting ready to start.</p><p>\u201cYour sister is Rogue in these parts, Mr. Walker,\u201d he said evenly. \u201cI haven\u2019t known a man yet that called her Caitlyn that didn\u2019t end up on his knees with his hands covering his balls. She has a wicked knee. And you\u2019re exaggerating the age difference by quite a bit.\u201d</p><p>John\u2019s grin was slow and filled with amusement this time. \u201cLittle witch. She always did know how to go for the weak spots.\u201d His smile dropped just as quick. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t tell me why a man your age is taking advantage of my sister. Or a man of your past.\u201d</p><p>Zeke stayed still. He stared back at Rogue\u2019s brother coldly, sensing what was coming.</p><p>This younger Walker was no man\u2019s fool; he would have run a check on Zeke the minute he knew his name, and the information he could have found would have worried any brother.</p><p>\u201cYou have quite a reputation in L.A.,\u201d the other man stated. \u201cThe detective who took down one of the most corrupt underground BDSM communities in the nation? After your wife\u2019s death, you became quite enmeshed in the community before your investigation and the subsequent arrests were made, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Zeke propped his elbows on the arms of his chair and steepled his fingers as he stared back at John Walker.</p><p>\u201cThe investigation had nothing to do with the BDSM aspects of that community,\u201d he stated. \u201cI was there to find a killer and a drug dealer, Mr. Walker. And the lifestyle itself has nothing to do with my relationship with your sister.\u201d</p><p>John\u2019s gaze sharpened. \u201cStrange, I hear you don\u2019t have relationships.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStrange,\u201d Zeke drawled. \u201cI hear that who your sister sleeps with or how she lives her life really isn\u2019t any of your damned business. If that\u2019s why you\u2019re here, then perhaps you should head back home.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOr perhaps I should just ask my sister about it,\u201d John suggested.</p><p>Zeke leaned forward, his arms bracing on his desk. \u201cMr. Walker, before this goes any further let me warn you right now, I won\u2019t brook any interference in my relationship with Rogue. You don\u2019t want to make an enemy of me, and that\u2019s something your contacts should have warned you of. You might think you see a dumb hick sheriff sitting in front of you, but let me assure you, Mr. Walker, this dumb hick knows how to hold on to what belongs to him.\u201d</p><p>Thick lashes narrowed over violet eyes as John stared back at him. \u201cAre parking lot brawls a requirement of holding on to your woman in this town?\u201d he asked. \u201cI stopped by Jonesy\u2019s before coming here. His face is a little worse for wear and yours isn\u2019t much better, even two days later. What did Caitlyn think of your beating up on the man that protected her for four years?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat did you think of the reason he received that beating?\u201d Zeke\u2019s smile was cold. \u201cOr didn\u2019t you ask him why it happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said he was protesting your treatment of Caitlyn,\u201d John said softly. \u201cAre you denying it?\u201d</p><p>Jonesy had lied. Zeke had to admit that surprised him. He hadn\u2019t thought the bartender would bother to lie.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened will stay between me and Jonesy.\u201d He finally shrugged. \u201cIf you have any questions or objections, then I imagine you\u2019ll take them up with Rogue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith Caitlyn,\u201d John stated again.</p> <p>\u201cHow old are you, Mr. Walker?\u201d Zeke asked then. \u201cTwelve? I think by now you\u2019re well aware of the name your sister prefers, as well as the one that suits her best. If you can\u2019t stop with the immature comments, then you can leave my office now.\u201d</p><p>Silence filled the room as John stared back at him with eyes that were like chips of violet ice. Finally, the younger man straightened in his chair and his expression smoothed out.</p><p>\u201cJoe and Jaime Walker, and their grandmother, Callie Walker, were murdered, weren\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>The change of subject didn\u2019t surprise Zeke. Whatever answers John had been looking for about his sister had evidently been answered. The air of confrontational disrespect had evaporated and clear, icy purpose filled those violet eyes. This was a man on a mission, and his mission was identifying and eliminating the threat to his sister.</p><p>\u201cWhere do you get your information from?\u201d Zeke asked rather than answering.</p><p>John\u2019s lips titled. \u201cLet\u2019s say I have my sources as I\u2019m certain you have your own, Sheriff.</p> <p>Joe, Jaime, and their grandmother were important to Caitlyn. But even more, they were close to her. I\u2019d like to know if her life is in danger as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Zeke leaned forward and watched the younger man intently. \u201cAt this moment, I don\u2019t believe it is, but I\u2019m taking precautions just in case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy sleeping with her?\u201d There was a spark of anger in his eyes now.</p><p>\u201cBy taking precautions,\u201d he repeated coolly.</p><p>John grimaced heavily.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to assume you didn\u2019t stop and see your sister before you arrived here,\u201d Zeke said, more than certain that was the case.</p><p>John grinned wryly. \u201cMy balls are still intact. What do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think your sister must have known how to use that knee of hers before she ever made an appearance in Somerset.\u201d Zeke grinned.</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s just say I\u2019ve experienced her wrath more than once. But in all fairness, I\u2019m the one that first taught her the maneuver. A girl has to know how to protect herself.\u201d</p><p>Zeke inclined his head in agreement. \u201cAnd sometimes, a fist is needed rather than a knee,\u201d he told the brother as he thought about his fight with Jonesy.</p><p>\u201cThen essentially, you have no idea who killed Joe, Jaime, and their grandmother, Callie?\u201d</p><p>Zeke shook his head. \u201cAll I know is that a woman ties them together. Joe and Jaime were involved with a woman together; they were due to meet with her the night they died. A few days ago, their grandmother told Lisa she thought she might know who the girl was. She was supposed to call me. She was found dead the next day. It looked as though she had slipped in the bathtub, hit her head, and drowned. The coroner\u2019s report says otherwise. Callie Walker was murdered, just as her grandsons were.\u201d</p><p>John reached up and rubbed one finger over his lower lip thoughtfully as Zeke stared back at him.</p><p>\u201cRogue was attacked six months ago because of something someone thought she knew,\u201d he mused quietly. \u201cShe was hospitalized for over a week, Sheriff Mayes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m well aware of that, Mr. Walker,\u201d Zeke stated quietly. \u201cI intend to make certain it doesn\u2019t happen again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs am I.\u201d John stood to his feet then. The deliberate slouchiness he had displayed when he first entered the office was no longer apparent. The younger man moved with unconscious grace and predatory awareness now.</p><p>\u201cJohn.\u201d</p><p>John turned back as he reached the door, his expression brooding.</p><p>\u201cYes, Sheriff?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need civilian interference in this. This is my investigation. Don\u2019t forget that.\u201d</p><p>His lips quirked. \u201cI\u2019m here, Sheriff, to see after my sister\u2019s welfare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs long as you stay out of my investigation,\u201d he agreed. \u201cAnd my relationship with your sister.\u201d</p><p>John arched an eyebrow. \u201cYou\u2019re not her husband, and that\u2019s the only relationship I\u2019m required to stay out of where my sister is concerned. Perhaps that\u2019s something you\u2019d do well to remember.\u201d</p><p>John opened the door, stepped out of the office, and with a click of the latch left Zeke alone with that final thought. It was a thought that should have filled him with a sense of dread. That was his normal feeling whenever marriage was mentioned. Strangely, the dread wasn\u2019t there now.</p><p>He shook his head at the thought of that, grabbed up his hat before strapping on his weapon and heading for the door.</p><p>\u201cKendal, radio Gene and inform him I\u2019m heading out. I\u2019d like to meet up with him at the diner in town before he takes over the evening shift,\u201d he told his secretary.</p><p>\u201cGene called in while you were meeting with Mr. Walker. He had to take the rest of the day off to take his wife to the doctor in Louisville.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlicia all right?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Kendal nodded. \u201cIt was a checkup, but she wanted Gene to go in with her. I think they\u2019re going to visit with their daughter Willa while they\u2019re there.\u201d</p><p>Zeke nodded at that. \u201cI\u2019ll head on out then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSheriff, you had a call from Teddy Winfred. He asked that you stop by his place when you can.\u201d</p><p>Zeke stopped and turned back to her. \u201cTeddy lives on the road that leads to the Walker twins\u2019 place, doesn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>Kendal\u2019s expression sobered. \u201cAbout two miles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll head out there now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSheriff,\u201d she called him back as he started to head to the door.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d He turned to her again, seeing the worry in her blue eyes.</p><p>\u201cHe asked me to make certain no one knew that he asked you to come to the house.</p><p>And he asked that you keep it to yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you tell anyone he called?\u201d</p><p>She tilted her head and stared back at him in disbelief. \u201cNot hardly,\u201d she said mockingly. \u201cI didn\u2019t even tell Gene when he called in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll head on out there then.\u201d He nodded. \u201cLet the deputy on duty tonight know that I\u2019m on call if he needs me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill do, Boss.\u201d Kendal flashed him a smile as he left the outer office and moved quickly along the hallway to the exit.</p><p>Minutes later he was in the Tahoe heading out of town toward the Winfred place.</p><p>Teddy Winfred was eighty if he was a day. He didn\u2019t venture out of his mobile home often and he didn\u2019t like visitors. He\u2019d damned near run Gene off with his cane when the deputy dropped by to question him after the Walker twins\u2019 bodies had been found. He was also a close friend with Callie Walker.</p><p>Heading out to the Winfred place had put his plans to drop by Rogue\u2019s apartment on hold though. The past two days had been hectic, for himself as well as Rogue as she worked at the restaurant well past closing. He\u2019d picked her up after work and returned to her apartment with her where he stayed the night, but there was still an edge of tension between them that he hadn\u2019t had time to deal with yet.</p><p>The appearance of her brother wasn\u2019t going to help matters. He had a feeling John Walker was going to be more trouble than he was worth and definitely more than Zeke wanted to put up with at the moment.</p><p>If he was anything like his father, Calvin Walker, then he could become a hazard if he stayed in Somerset long. Calvin Walker had been a hellion when he was younger, more often in trouble than not, simply because he hadn\u2019t known when to keep his nose out of others\u2019 business. It hadn\u2019t surprised Zeke at all that Walker had become a lawyer, and one in Boston nonetheless. Zeke bet he kept all the feathers ruffled there.</p><p>He grinned at the thought of it. He remembered Calvin, though the other man was a good decade and a half older than Zeke was. He also remembered how much his father and Gene\u2019s had hated the other man.</p><p>James Maynard had been Thad Mayes\u2019s deputy for several years when Thad had held the sheriff\u2019s office. The two men had made it a point to harass Calvin as often as possible. They considered it a game, a way to feel superior. Thad hadn\u2019t always run his office with any sense of justice. Unlike Zeke, he had seen it as a means to power, a way to keep others beneath him, and a way to ensure that he was accepted in the upper-class level of the county at the time.</p><p>Thad\u2019s dreams hadn\u2019t been Zeke\u2019s, but his father had drawn him into the dark underbelly of that life anyway. He wasn\u2019t the county\u2019s sheriff; he\u2019d been Dayle Mackay\u2019s sheriff, and what Dayle wanted, Dayle got. When Dayle had ordered Thad to prove Zeke\u2019s loyalty to the League, Thad had done it in a way that had destroyed the boy Zeke had once been.</p><p>Blood stained his hands. It wasn\u2019t innocent blood, but it was still murder. It was still a nightmare for the fourteen-year-old child he had been at the time. And it still held the potential to destroy him.</p><p>It had left a legacy that Zeke was still sometimes forced to fight. Through those years, Gene had always been a phone call away. A friend that knew the darkness and shared it with Zeke. For a while, Zeke had been certain that Gene had gotten out of the League.</p><p>Recently though, Zeke had been forced to wonder if that were indeed true.</p><p>There were times Zeke wondered if Gene would ever be fully out from under his father\u2019s thumb. There had been a time when Zeke had thought Gene was his own man; now, he wasn\u2019t so sure of it.</p><p>Thoughts of Gene brought Jonesy to mind. Danny Jones was another wild card, and one who had been a part of Thad Mayes\u2019s inner group of friends at one time. Danny</p><p>\u201cJonesy\u201d Jones had slipped out of that group when he had defended Calvin Walker against Thad Mayes and James Maynard. That had finished Jonesy\u2019s friendship with Zeke\u2019s and Gene\u2019s fathers.</p><p>That information had come through the investigation the previous year. It was in the files his contact in Washington had finally gotten for him. Jonesy had once been rumored to be in the selection process for the League when he had learned what it was and how it would affect his friendships and his life. He\u2019d chosen the friendships and had been targeted by Thad several times because of it.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t surprising that when Rogue had found herself in trouble after arriving in Somerset, Jonesy had stepped in. And now that Rogue was involved with Zeke, Jonesy felt threatened, both personally and for Rogue. That didn\u2019t excuse his treatment of her, and Zeke would never forget how Jonesy had bruised Rogue\u2019s delicate arms. He didn\u2019t trust the other man; there was something about his temper that bothered Zeke. It wasn\u2019t just anger that drove Jonesy. There was something more. Something that had Zeke\u2019s nerves on edge. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He pushed those thoughts to the back of his mind to consider later as he pulled into Teddy Winfred\u2019s driveway.</p><p>The white single-wide mobile home sat peacefully within a small clearing surrounded by oak, pine, and dogwood trees. The yard was neatly cut, and old Teddy\u2019s late- model Ford pickup was parked next to the mobile home.</p><p>Zeke parked the Tahoe, turned off the ignition, then moved from the truck and strode up the graveled driveway to the front door.</p> <p>The door opened as he stepped onto the faded porch, and a grizzled Teddy Winfred met him with a wide smile on his wrinkled face. Teddy still possessed most of his natural teeth and didn\u2019t mind bragging on them with his wide smiles.</p><p>\u201cTeddy.\u201d Zeke shook his hand. \u201cKendal said you called and asked me to drop by.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome in. Come in.\u201d Teddy\u2019s smile flashed again as his faded hazel eyes sparkled with humor as he led the way into the scrupulously neat little home.</p><p>A threadbare couch and recliner sat in the living room, facing a wide-screen television.</p><p>Zeke knew Teddy\u2019s sons, one a minister in the county, the other a store owner, made certain their father was well taken care of. It was one of their biggest gripes that their father refused to give up his independence and move in with one of them.</p> <p>\u201cHow are you doing, Teddy?\u201d Zeke removed his hat as he took the seat Teddy waved to.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m doing good, Zeke. Real good.\u201d Teddy nodded his bald head before wiping a hand over it. \u201cI heard about Callie, how she died and all. I got to thinking about those grandsons of hers and them dying. There\u2019s word going around, you know, that they were murdered. That concerned me some.\u201d</p><p>Zeke sat forward in the chair and watched the old man.</p><p>\u201cWhy did that concern you, Teddy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, Zeke.\u201d He rubbed his gnarled hands together before clasping them slowly.</p><p>\u201cCallie called me that morning. The morning she drowned.\u201d His hazel eyes darkened with sadness. \u201cShe said she thought her grandsons had been murdered because of some girl they were seeing. She asked me if I knew who it was.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy would you know who it was, Teddy?\u201d Zeke asked.</p><p>Teddy sighed. \u201cI always know when folks come and go up this road. And Joe and Jaime, they did a lot of fishing here behind the house in the creek. Sometimes, they\u2019d be drinking and talking and their voices carried real good here.\u201d</p><p>Zeke nodded encouragingly. \u201cDid you hear something before they died?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, see, that\u2019s the problem.\u201d Teddy scratched his head thoughtfully. \u201cI heard them the night before they were killed. They were drunk as skunks out back, laughing and cutting up. I opened the back door so I could hear better.\u201d He grinned unapologetically.</p><p>\u201cOld folks like to live vicariously through young, dumb kids like that, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can imagine, Teddy.\u201d Zeke chuckled. \u201cWhat did you hear Joe and Jaime talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, they were talking about a girl. Joe said he was getting serious about her, and Jaime laughed, said if Joe was serious, then he would get serious, too.\u201d Teddy shook his head. \u201cThose two got into some wild games with the girls, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Zeke nodded again.</p> <p>Teddy shook his head and breathed out roughly. \u201cI told Callie what I\u2019d heard and she said she was going to call you. But when I got hold of her granddaughter the other day, she said she thought maybe Callie hadn\u2019t had a chance to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCallie didn\u2019t have time to talk to me, Teddy,\u201d he affirmed. \u201cI wasn\u2019t aware she was trying to contact me until after her death.\u201d</p><p>Teddy\u2019s eyes glittered with moisture then. \u201cShe was killed, wasn\u2019t she, Sheriff? Because she was trying to figure out who killed those grandsons of hers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, Teddy. Until I find out who the boys were seeing and if she had anything to do with it, then I can\u2019t say,\u201d Zeke stated.</p><p>Teddy breathed out slowly before rubbing the side of his wrinkled face.</p><p>\u201cWhat else did you hear the boys say that night, Teddy?\u201d Zeke asked.</p><p>\u201cJust between me and you, Zeke?\u201d Teddy asked. \u201cCallie was going to talk to you and she ended up drowning in her bathtub. I don\u2019t want to drown in my bathtub.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can understand that, Teddy.\u201d He nodded. \u201cThis stays just between the two of us.\u201d</p><p>Teddy nodded again. \u201cI didn\u2019t hear much, and that was what I told Callie. They were talking about being serious about this girl, and Joe said they\u2019d have to be real careful for a while, because her daddy would kill them if he found out. They seemed to talk like they might be a little worried about that. Then Jaime said he had a way to take care of it.</p><p>That he knew how to keep her daddy quiet. He told Joe he had information, that he knew that her daddy was a part of those men they were looking for last summer and that her daddy wouldn\u2019t want anyone to know just how deep he was in that group.</p><p>Now, I took it at first as just talk; you know how young boys get, and Joe and Jaime could be a little paranoid sometimes about stuff. But when I told Callie what was said, she went real quiet for a long time. And she says, \u2018That was what I was afraid of, Teddy.</p><p>That was what I was afraid of.\u2019 And she hung the phone up then. Next I heard, she was dead.\u201d</p><p>The girl\u2019s father was a part of what happened last summer. Joe and Jaime had given the Mackay cousins and DHS information then that led to uncovering the identities of several citizens involved in the Freedom League.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all she said? She didn\u2019t give you a name, Teddy?\u201d</p><p>Teddy shook his head. \u201cShe didn\u2019t say a name, Zeke. She hung up and that was the last time I talked to her.\u201d</p><p>Zeke stared back at Teddy thoughtfully.</p><p>\u201cAnd you think Callie figured out who it was from that information?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Teddy sighed. \u201cI just know what she said and how she said it. And I knew Callie. She knew something. And I think that something got her killed.\u201d</p><p>Zeke was pretty damned certain it had. He considered the information Teddy had given him. There wasn\u2019t a name to go on, but there was definitely information here that Timothy Cranston needed to know.</p><p>The suspended Homeland Security special agent could have information there that Zeke could use. Zeke knew there were files that the DHS agent had on suspected homeland terrorists, though Zeke hadn\u2019t been given the privilege of going through those files.</p><p>\u201cDid you hear anything else, Teddy?\u201d Zeke asked.</p><p>Teddy shook his head. \u201cNothing about the girl they were seeing. They started talking about being thrown out of their cousin\u2019s bar. Said Rogue had a mean knee.\u201d Teddy\u2019s gaze lightened with a hint of laughter then. \u201cJonesy taught her how to use that knee, I hear. Jonesy used to be a hell of a fighter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019ve heard.\u201d Zeke nodded, moving to rise to his feet.</p><p>\u201cYou know your dad and Jonesy used to be good friends,\u201d Teddy said.</p><p>\u201cI know that.\u201d Zeke nodded.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Teddy rubbed his hands together slowly. \u201cJonesy, James, and Thad, they were all real tight at one time. Until your dad started hooking up with that Dayle Mackay.</p><p>Jonesy never could get along with Dayle, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know that, Teddy.\u201d</p><p>Teddy nodded. \u201cYour dad was a good man when he was younger, until he hooked up with Dayle.\u201d Teddy grimaced soberly. \u201cHe changed. But I guess all men change when they grow older in some ways. Some for the better, some for the worse, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo it would seem, Teddy,\u201d Zeke answered. \u201cSo it would seem.\u201d</p><p>Teddy nodded again before wiping his hand over his jaw. \u201cYou had a good mother though. She loved you like crazy. She was always taking those pictures of you and your dad. Everywhere she went she took pictures. Memories, she called them.\u201d He grinned at that. \u201cShe used to say they were her memories, and when she was old they would serve her good. I saw her once when I was hunting, taking pictures in the mountains by herself. Your daddy and some friends were fishing out by the old cabin he kept. She didn\u2019t see me. She was taking pictures of your dad and you, I guess. There were a lot of folks there. She liked her pictures.\u201d</p><p>Zeke tensed. Memories flashed in his mind, comments his mother used to make, arguments she\u2019d had with his dad. And one odd comment that stuck in his brain and shot adrenaline through his body.</p><p>His mother and her damned pictures. Her insurance, she had told his father when Zeke had been twelve, maybe thirteen. It was her insurance and if Thad was smart he\u2019d save his own insurance. And he knew where his mother had hid her insurance. Son of a bitch, all these years, time spent investigating, searching, and the proof he needed could have been right under his nose all this time.</p><p>TWENTY</p><p>Rogue watched her brother warily as he prowled theliving and kitchen area of her spacious apartment. He made the walls shrink in the once-airy rooms. Pacing like a caged tiger, she wouldn\u2019t have been surprised if he had started growling at her.</p><p>\u201cYou know, Mom and Dad are not going to be pleased.\u201d He threw her a fulminating glare as he turned and faced her from the other side of the couch. \u201cWhy the hell do you think I showed up? Dad is within days of arriving, Caitlyn. He\u2019s not happy over this situation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll have to live with it.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s no more his business than it is yours.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t need family interference right now. She\u2019d managed to keep her father off her back for the past five years by putting up with Jonesy, which she had considered the lesser of two evils. Now, she had her brother here looking for all the world like a younger version of her father, albeit with blond hair rather than her father\u2019s red gold.</p><p>\u201cDad is not just going to live with it, Cait,\u201d he warned her.</p><p>\u201cRogue,\u201d she corrected him. She\u2019d lost count of the times she had corrected him. He just threw her another glare, just as he had each time she had reminded him before.</p><p>\u201cLook, just come back to Boston for a few weeks.\u201d He crossed his arms over his chest and stared back at her as though that look alone would get him his way.</p><p>Rogue almost smiled. Why was it that men thought all they had to do was cross their arms over their chests and stare back at a woman with determined eyes to get their way? It didn\u2019t work on her.</p><p>\u201cAnd do what?\u201d She grinned. \u201cAre you going to take me out with you at night and make certain I\u2019m entertained?\u201d</p><p>His expression didn\u2019t change.</p><p>\u201cOf course you aren\u2019t,\u201d she answered her own question with a mocking edge of humor.</p><p>\u201cAnd Mom and Dad have their things to do. That leaves poor little Rogue sitting in the corner to stare at the walls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCaitlyn,\u201d he growled her name. \u201cYour name is Caitlyn. Son of a bitch, you\u2019ve had four years, Cait. You\u2019ve had plenty of time to get back at the bastards that hurt you. Now it\u2019s time to come home.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him in surprise, and she admitted a bit of anger. She would have thought that her brother would have known better than to believe she had stayed in Somerset for such a paltry reason.</p><p>\u201cYou think the only reason I stay here is because I want to get back at someone?\u201d She felt like pulling at her hair. She hated dealing with her brother, or her father, when they got something into their head. They didn\u2019t let up until they got their way, and Rogue wasn\u2019t of the mind to give in to them.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s exactly why you stay,\u201d he bit out harshly. \u201cTell me what else you have. Family?</p><p>Friends? You didn\u2019t even make friends outside the damned bar until last year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo? I have friends now.\u201d She shrugged as she adjusted the hem of her T-shirt over the band of her jeans. \u201cI have a business, a job, and a sheriff.\u201d She winked suggestively as she watched him flush angrily. She hadn\u2019t said the word lover, it hovered there in the air between them, infuriating his brotherly sensibilities. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCaitlyn . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cRogue,\u201d she injected softly. She was getting tired of reminding him.</p><p>He grimaced. \u201cEven I know Sheriff Mayes\u2019s reputation with women. He\u2019s not a relationship kind of guy and you know it. He\u2019s going to break your heart.\u201d</p> <p>Rogue pushed her hands into her back pockets and gave him a tight smile, warning herself to keep her mouth shut. She didn\u2019t want to fight with her brother. It had been too long since she had seen him. She\u2019d let him bitch a little, then maybe take him down to the bar and let him have a drink or two. Maybe a beer would chill him out a little.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not even listening to me, are you?\u201d he accused her, a hint of anger entering his voice.</p><p>\u201cShould I be?\u201d Rogue arched her brows as she pulled her hands from her pockets and turned away from him to grab her apartment keys and cell phone from the kitchen table. \u201cLet\u2019s go down to the bar. I need to check a few things out and you need a beer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need a damned beer.\u201d His violet gaze hardened as he stared back at her. \u201cI\u2019ll help you pack instead.\u201d</p><p>Her lips quirked. \u201cYou can come downstairs for a beer, or you can find yourself a hotel room for the night first. But packing isn\u2019t something we\u2019ll do.\u201d</p> <p>His lips thinned. \u201cYou have a spare bedroom here; why should I have to find a hotel room?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you aren\u2019t staying here,\u201d she informed him as she moved for the door.</p><p>\u201cBecause your sheriff stays here?\u201d he forced out between clenched teeth.</p><p>\u201cPretty much.\u201d She shrugged mockingly. \u201cI prefer not to have my brother in the next room while I\u2019m sleeping with my lover. It just smacks of tacky.\u201d</p><p>His hands plowed through his hair. Anger marked his face and glittered in his eyes as she strolled past him.</p><p>\u201cCome on, John.\u201d Opening the door, she stared back at him warningly. \u201cI\u2019m not in the mood to fight with you, and you don\u2019t want to push it. Let\u2019s go downstairs and have a beer and chill out. You can go back home tomorrow and tell Daddy I\u2019m just as stubborn as I ever was and you can go on about your business.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou think all it takes is telling Dad that you\u2019re being stubborn, don\u2019t you, Rogue?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all it took before.\u201d She moved for the stairs. \u201cI\u2019m a big girl, John. I really can make these decisions all by myself.\u201d</p><p>She heard him follow behind her, the door closing before she started down the stairs.</p><p>Music drifted up the stairs, clashing and wild as a popular classic rock tune thundered out onto the dance floor and beyond.</p><p>\u201cYou like to think you\u2019re a big girl,\u201d he snorted behind her. \u201cA half-pint wishing is more like it.\u201d</p><p>She grinned at the comment. A half-pint wishing, that was one of her father\u2019s ways of telling her she was too small and delicate to do the things she normally did. It was usually in reference to another fight she had been involved in, or when she went nose to nose with Jonesy over something he ended up tattling over.</p><p>Pushing through the door that led to the main customer area of the bar, she let a grin tilt her lips. It was going to be hard at first to step away from the home she had taken over four years ago. The bar had been her rebellion, and she had done a damned good job of rebelling in it. Maybe she had grown up a bit over the years though. The bar wasn\u2019t as important as it had been, or maybe she was tired of rebelling. Either way, she knew her time there was limited.</p><p>Moving behind the long counter, she drew her brother a draft beer before pulling a chilled bottle of her favorite brand from beneath the counter. Her gaze went over the bartenders\u2019 activity, from Jonesy at the register as he made a point to ignore her, to Kent as he filled orders quickly and efficiently.</p> <p>\u201cYou know, you should move to Somerset.\u201d She grinned at her brother\u2019s look of horror.</p><p>\u201cJust think, you could escape that stuffy lifestyle you\u2019ve adopted for yourself and have some real fun. I\u2019d even let you take over the bar.\u201d</p><p>She leaned a hip against the counter as she stared out over the dance floor before swinging her gaze back to her brother.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re joking.\u201d He grimaced as he glared at her.</p><p>\u201cNot in the least,\u201d she assured him, raising her voice to be heard over the din. \u201cI like working with Janey, John. I want to spend more time at the restaurant rather than here.</p><p>You\u2019d do well here.\u201d</p><p>Come to think of it, her brother would fit in here, she thought. He\u2019d been discontent for years at her father\u2019s law firm. Where her sister seemed to fit in fine, John and her father clashed constantly.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve lost your mind.\u201d He turned his back on her as though she weren\u2019t worth listening to any longer.</p><p>Rogue grinned; she knew her brother, and he wasn\u2019t as disinterested as he wanted to pretend. His body was tense, a frown was brewing at his forehead\u2014proof that he was at least considering her suggestion.</p><p>Shaking her head at him she finished her beer before disposing of the bottle and making her rounds of the bar.</p><p>She greeted regulars, chatted with visitors, and picked out tourists from among those just passing through on their way to other locations. She laughed and made certain the waitresses kept the drinks flowing. And through it all she kept her eye on the door, watching for one figure, one man.</p><p>\u201cHey, Rogue.\u201d</p><p>She turned at the pat on her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cGene, how are you doing?\u201d She shot the deputy a quick smile as he looked around the bar.</p><p>\u201cSeen Zeke this evening yet?\u201d he asked as he looked around the bar, his ruddy face creasing into a frown.</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d She kept her smile relaxed, kept the worry out of her expression. \u201cHe usually shows up before the night\u2019s over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you\u2019d be at the restaurant tonight?\u201d</p><p>She looked around the bar as she shook her head. \u201cI\u2019ve had some things to take care of, so I took tonight off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThings like your brother?\u201d His grin was slow and easy. \u201cTalk is already making rounds that another Boston Walker is in town. I hear he\u2019s a hell of a lawyer.\u201d</p><p>Gene\u2019s voice lifted to carry over the music, making it loud enough for those standing and sitting around them to hear their conversation clearly. Rogue was aware of the interest they were generating; it would have been impossible to miss.</p><p>\u201cJohn is definitely one hell of a lawyer. If you\u2019d like to chat with him, he\u2019s over at the bar.\u201d She nodded toward John\u2019s location. \u201cIf you\u2019ll excuse me, I have a few things I need to check on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d he answered. \u201cI might just do that, Rogue. Tell Zeke I was looking for him before he left the office. He\u2019s not answering his cell phone, but I left a few messages.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll let him know you\u2019re looking for him,\u201d she promised as she moved away. \u201cNight, Gene.\u201d</p><p>If she saw him. She checked her watch. It was going on nine and she hadn\u2019t seen him yet. That was unusual, and she admitted, it bothered her.</p><p>After making a full round of the bar she slipped back through the door next to the counter, managing to evade detection by her brother or Gene. She moved up the stairs, pulled the key to the apartment from her jeans, and unlocked the door before slipping inside.</p><p>The apartment was dark. She never left it dark. She always left lights on, simply because she hated fumbling for the switch.</p><p>Moving to back out, a surprised yelp left her lips as a hard hand gripped her wrist, pulled her in as the door was pushed closed, before she found herself flat against the wall behind her.</p><p>She would have screamed if a part of her hadn\u2019t instantly recognized the man that pressed against her. Her lips, parted on instinct, rather than blasting out in furious sound, let a moan slip by as hard male lips pressed into them, and a ravenous tongue licked over them.</p><p>Rogue let her arms wind around a muscular male neck. She arched into the hands that slid beneath her T-shirt and caressed her up her back. Her lips returned the fiery kiss that blazed over her lips.</p><p>She tasted him, felt him, smelled him. Her senses became filled with him as he lifted her against his harder body, his thigh sliding between hers as his hands moved her to ride the hard muscle.</p><p>Heated, pulsating pleasure erupted through her pussy. Instantly, her clit became swollen, her juices began to spill. Her breasts swelled beneath her bra and her nipples tightened. Every cell of her body went on high alert at the touch and the taste of this one man.</p><p>Her lips closed on his tongue, hers met it, stroked, licked. A soft cry filled the air, throttled as their lips held it back. Her body was instantly electrified, responsive, needy.</p><p>She needed and wondered at her response to him. At the sheer pleasure, the sense of anticipation that filled her as his hard hands held her hips, his heavy thigh muscle grinding between her thighs.</p><p>Blood thundered through her veins now; her flesh became sensitive, her body weak with arousal. It was like this. Each time he touched her, each time he was near, she was ready for him, waiting for him.</p><p>\u201cJohn is here,\u201d she gasped as his lips moved from hers and arrowed down her neck.</p><p>One hand pulled at the neckline of her T-shirt, pulling it back from her collarbone as he devoured flesh there.</p><p>His tongue stroked over the sensitive skin as she breathed in harshly, her head falling back to give him greater access as heated sensation raced through her.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not up here,\u201d he growled before raking his teeth over the upper swell of her breast. \u201cI checked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe has a key,\u201d she moaned, her nails digging into the muscles of his shoulder, feeling naked flesh.</p><p>He must have taken off his shirt before she entered the room. He still wore jeans, she assumed he still had his boots on. But his back and chest were bare, heated and hard.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s always interrupting things that he shouldn\u2019t.\u201d She nearly lost her breath as his hands pushed her shirt over the swell of her breasts. \u201cGod, Zeke, you make me crazy like this.\u201d</p><p>When he was hard and demanding, determined to take what he wanted. It made her blood pressure soar, made heat erupt throughout her body as her pussy clenched in need.</p><p>She ached for him. She\u2019d ached for him all day, watched for him, needed him.</p><p>\u201cI want you crazy,\u201d he breathed over the valley of her breasts. \u201cCrazy and wild. Come on, Rogue, show me how wild you can be.\u201d</p><p>How wild she could be? She was weak, arching to him as he pushed aside the lace of her bra and licked over her nipple.</p><p>\u201cWild?\u201d she moaned. \u201cDamn, Zeke, I can barely breathe.\u201d</p><p>His chuckle was dark and sexy against the tight tip of her breast as his lips covered it, sucked it into his mouth, and sent her senses spinning.</p><p>The lash of his tongue against her nipple sent fire rippling through her nervous system.</p><p>Each hard draw at the tender tip sent a spark of reaction straight to her womb, stealing her breath and leaving her gasping at the pleasure.</p><p>Her world was on fire with pleasure. Pinpoints of light sparkled behind her closed lids, and nothing existed, nothing was real but this touch, this man that held her against him with a strength, a power that she hadn\u2019t sensed in him before.</p><p>\u201cWhere is the little bastard?\u201d he finally groaned as his head lifted from her breast.</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d she lifted to him, desperate for more.</p><p>\u201cYour brother.\u201d His cheek rubbed against her breast, the dark rasp of a shadow of a beard sending a shudder through her body.</p><p>\u201cOh. Downstairs, with Gene. Your deputy left you a message on your cell phone.\u201d She finally remembered. \u201cYou can answer him later. Much later.\u201d</p><p>She felt him tense against her. Every muscle in his lean, corded frame seemed to tighten to steely hardness.</p><p>\u201cDefinitely much later,\u201d he agreed, though he was drawing away from her now, pulling back before reaching beside her to flip the lights on. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Rogue blinked at the sudden bright light, staring up at him as he slowly released her before jerking his shirt from the back of the couch and pulling it over his head.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She watched him with a frown as he pushed his arms through their holes and pulled the shirt over his lean abs.</p><p>\u201cGrab a jacket.\u201d He turned back to her, his expression hard. \u201cI had Alex drop me off here; we\u2019ll take your cycle back to my place.\u201d</p> <p>Rogue tilted her head to the side as she watched him curiously now.</p><p>\u201cAre we slipping away, Zeke?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cNot for the reasons you might be thinking,\u201d he grunted. \u201cThis has nothing to do with caring who sees me with you. There\u2019s just a few things I\u2019m avoiding right now.\u201d</p><p>That was strange enough; she couldn\u2019t imagine Zeke avoiding anything that needed to be taken care of or anyone causing him any problems.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll explain why later, right?\u201d</p> <p>He nodded slowly. \u201cLater. I promise.\u201d</p><p>Licking her lips nervously, Rogue moved to the closet where she pulled her leather riding jacket free, then lifted the keys to the Harley from the small peg inside the closet.</p><p>\u201cHere you go.\u201d She tossed him the keys after closing the closet door and turning back to him. \u201cSorry, there\u2019s no secret door to slip out of. You\u2019re going to have to take your chances going down the stairs, I guess. Unless you want to climb out the back window and shimmy down the drainpipe or something.\u201d</p><p>He glanced toward the bedroom window as Rogue\u2019s gaze narrowed.</p><p>\u201cExplanations would be nice,\u201d she finally told him.</p><p>He nodded slowly. \u201cExplanations will have to come later though. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p> <p>He grabbed his own leather jacket from the couch; she hadn\u2019t even noticed it until then.</p><p>Shrugging it on, he opened the door, looked down the stairs, then led her from the room before locking the door behind them.</p><p>Rogue stayed silent, though the questions were beginning to build in her mind. She followed him down the stairs, then the short hall to the back door. They slipped from the bar as silently as he had obviously slipped inside, and he led her straight to the covered carport behind the bar where she kept her Harley parked.</p><p>He straddled the cycle quickly and inserted the key as Rogue swung onto the padded back hump. The throb of the cycle\u2019s engines between her thighs was always an exhilarating, almost sexual sensation that gave her a reckless little thrill.</p><p>She pulled on the helmet Zeke handed her as he pulled on the extra that he had taken from a hook just inside the carport. Within seconds, the kickstand was up and he was backing the motorcycle from the covered shelter before turning the handlebars and accelerating from the back lot.</p><p>The small graveled drive that led from the back lot across a rough meadow exited at a small country road that broke off from the interstate. Zeke turned onto the small country lane before revving the engine and speeding away from the bar.</p><p>Resting her hands on his tight waist, Rogue rode behind him silently. She could feel the tension burning in him, feel the need, for whatever reason, to get her away from the bar.</p><p>She wondered if his absence that day had anything to do with his tension now.</p> <p>According to his secretary when she\u2019d called earlier, he had an appointment out of town and Kendal hadn\u2019t known when he would be back. Now, he\u2019d had Alex drop him off at the bar and they were escaping on her cycle rather than in his Tahoe?</p><p>She couldn\u2019t bitch about escaping with him though. There was something incredibly fulfilling about riding free behind him, his warmth buffeting the cool night air as she held on to him.</p><p>She\u2019d never enjoyed riding behind anyone else. She\u2019d always loved the control of wielding the cycle\u2019s power herself. But somehow, with Zeke, it seemed natural, right.</p><p>The feeling was almost as powerful as lying in his arms after the explosive orgasm he gave her.</p><p>The night sped by, the wind chilly but not cutting. There was a hint of warmth to the air, the certainty of the land that summer\u2019s heat was heading its way. In front of her, the certainty of her lover\u2019s heat seemed to wrap around her, enclose her as he navigated the darkened back roads toward his home.</p><p>The drive wasn\u2019t long, no more than half an hour, but the cell phone at her side had activated twice, and she had a feeling she knew who it was.</p><p>Her brother. Or Jonesy. They couldn\u2019t know she was with Zeke, but they would guess that she was heading to see him at the least.</p><p>Why, she wondered, was John so intent that she leave Somerset and return to Boston?</p><p>What drove not just Jonesy but her brother to such lengths to supposedly save her from Zeke? It bothered her, first Jonesy, then John. Both were pissed at the thought of her being with Zeke and she couldn\u2019t figure out why.</p><p>The broken heart was her risk to take, and the risk was one she wouldn\u2019t miss out on, not now, not after waiting this long for the chance to steal his heart.</p><p>But was she stealing his heart, or was she fooling herself? She\u2019d been throwing herself at him for years; had he just finally taken what was offered, or did it mean anything to him?</p><p>She had to let herself believe that it meant something, at least for now.</p><p>Clenching her eyes closed for precious seconds, she held on to the hope, the prayer, that more would come of this than a broken heart.</p><p>Her eyes opened as he made the turn onto the side road that led into his farm. The night seemed darker, the stars blotted out by the thick covering of pine that reached into the night sky. She felt isolated from the rest of the world, as though she and Zeke were riding into a place where nothing else could touch them, where nothing existed but the two of them.</p><p>When he broke from the heavy tree cover it was to make the short ride to his home. He pulled the motorcycle up to the garage doors, stopped, and kicked down the stand before swinging off, leaving the engine throbbing as he moved to open the garage doors.</p><p>Rogue slid into the seat he vacated, relishing the heavy heat he left, kicked up the stand, and pulled the cycle into the garage before cutting the motor and pulling off her helmet and hanging it on the end of one of the handlebars as she watched Zeke move toward her.</p><p>The cell phone at her hip beeped imperatively.</p><p>Pulling it free, she checked the number, before lifting her gaze back to Zeke.</p><p>\u201cJonesy and John are getting rather impatient,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cDo you usually check in with them?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>Rogue shook her head before flipping the phone open and bringing it to her ear.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m busy,\u201d she told her bartender. \u201cWhat\u2019s the problem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere the hell are you? John is going crazy trying to hunt you down and he\u2019s making me crazy,\u201d Jonesy growled. \u201cWhy can\u2019t you just let someone know when the hell you\u2019re riding off into the night?\u201d</p><p>Her lips thinned at the controlled anger in his tone.</p><p>\u201cWhere is John?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHang on, you can talk to the little bastard yourself,\u201d he snapped.</p><p>The muted sound of the band, conversation, and general good times could be heard through the phone for long seconds as Rogue threw her leg over the cycle\u2019s seat and waited impatiently as Zeke paced to the end of the garage before turning back, leaning against the wall, and crossing his arms over his chest as he watched her.</p><p>\u201cWhere the fuck are you?\u201d John snarled into the phone. \u201cI\u2019ve called every damned number you\u2019ve ever given me trying to find you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince when do I have to inform you of where I\u2019m going or what I\u2019m doing?\u201d she asked quietly, aware of the sound of the bar fading in the background of the phone.</p><p>\u201cSince I suspect you ran off with that damned sheriff you insist on sleeping with,\u201d he retorted harshly. \u201cGet your ass back here, we need to talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs the bar on fire?\u201d she finally asked sweetly.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t fuck with me, Rogue.\u201d His voice was grating and harsh. \u201cNo, the damned bar isn\u2019t on fire, no one is bleeding, dead, or hospitalized, and you aren\u2019t in danger of a lawsuit. What you are in danger of is the fact that Dad will be on the first flight out here if I make the call I\u2019m getting ready to make.\u201d</p><p>Anger threatened to explode through her. Zeke was watching her with those cool, predatory eyes of his, as though he knew something she didn\u2019t and he was just waiting on the explosion.</p><p>John was exploding, Jonesy was acting damned strange, and for some reason, Gene, Zeke\u2019s primary deputy, couldn\u2019t get a call through to him. Zeke wasn\u2019t even wearing his cell phone.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not fourteen,\u201d she said softly. \u201cNor does Daddy make the rules I live by any longer. Make all the calls you want to. But be warned, John, cause me too much trouble and I\u2019ll leave you lying on the floor with your balls choking you. Understand me?\u201d</p><p>She flipped the phone closed before he could answer, then turned it off, all the while her gaze locked with Zeke\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cI assume explanations will be forthcoming,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYou can assume.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cDoesn\u2019t mean I have the answers.\u201d He shifted away from the wall and headed for the door. \u201cLet\u2019s go inside, Rogue. I\u2019ll give you what I have. At this point, that\u2019s about the best I can do.\u201d</p><p>His voice was heavy, laden with something bitter that clenched at Rogue\u2019s chest and left her aching. It left her frightened.</p><p>Berkley titles by Lora Leigh</p><p>BENGAL\u2019S HEART</p><p>COYOTE\u2019S MATE</p><p>MERCURY\u2019S WAR</p><p>DAWN\u2019S AWAKENING</p><p>TANNER\u2019S SCHEME</p><p>HARMONY\u2019S WAY</p><p>MEGAN\u2019S MARK</p><p>NAUTI DECEPTIONS</p><p>NAUTI INTENTIONS</p><p>NAUTI DREAMS</p><p>NAUTI NIGHTS</p><p>NAUTI BOY</p><p>Anthologies</p><p>THE MAGICAL CHRISTMAS CAT</p><p>(with Erin McCarthy, Nalini Singh, and Linda Winstead Jones) SHIFTER</p><p>(with Angela Knight, Alyssa Day, and Virginia Kantra)</p><p>BEYOND THE DARK</p><p>(with Angela Knight, Emma Holly, and Diane Whiteside)</p><p>HOT SPELL</p><p>(with Emma Holly, Shiloh Walker, and Meljean Brook)</p><p>TWENTY-ONE</p><p>Zeke could feel the anger brewing inside him. Itwas a dark, eternal core that had begun years ago, when he first realized how diseased his father had become. When, as a fourteen-year-old kid, Zeke had made his first kill.</p><p>Disgust stirred, thick and oily, in the pit of his stomach, its acrid taste burning his tongue at the memories he rarely allowed himself to revisit. His nervousness, the complete fear that had washed over him when he\u2019d picked up the handgun lying on a small table. The shock and surprise in his victim\u2019s face when he\u2019d turned, aimed, and pulled the trigger.</p><p>Because his father had told him the man they were meeting would try to kill them and would then kill Zeke\u2019s mother. That they had no choice but to be waiting on him, and the only way to surprise him was if Zeke took the shot.</p><p>Fourteen fucking years old. So damned dumb loyal to his father that he hadn\u2019t known his ass from a hole in the ground. All he knew was that his father said he was in trouble, that someone was going to try to kill all of them. As men, it was their place to protect his mother. They were the head of the house, the protectors, the defenders. And Zeke had bought into it until the second he fired that gun and saw the other man\u2019s eyes, heard his last gasping breath as he whispered, \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>It played out in his nightmares sometimes, it lurked in the back of his mind when he was awake, and a part of Zeke had never forgotten that second of insight, as death glazed another man\u2019s eyes, that he would never be the same again.</p><p>Because of his father. Because he had idolized the man who had raised him, because he had trusted him, believed in him. Because he had been a stupid, dumb kid that the father he loved had manipulated.</p><p>Zeke remembered a time when Thad Mayes had been a good man. When his father\u2019s brown eyes had been clear with laughter and good humor. Until he had taken a devil\u2019s bargain. A bargain that had destroyed his marriage, his relationship with his son, and, Zeke suspected, had eventually taken his life. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Opening the door into the house, he stood aside as Rogue moved toward him slowly, her violet gaze dark with worry, her expression pensive.</p><p>The need to touch her was almost overwhelming. The need to sink inside her and forget the horrors of the past was a hunger he could barely deny himself. The need to hold her in his arms, to feel her warmth. It went beyond hunger, it was a compulsion now, an addiction. He needed her touch until he could barely function for it at times.</p><p>But under that fierce need was too much rage. It was dark and boiling inside him, demanding action. It was like a demon nipping at his soul, destroying his control.</p> <p>The anger rode him too deep to allow for touch. It was too much a part of him tonight, rising from his soul until it threatened to push through the very pores of his flesh.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on, Zeke?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head and held his hand out to her. \u201cCome inside; this isn\u2019t the place to talk.\u201d</p><p>Staying away from her would have been the best decision. If he\u2019d had the strength. God knew, he didn\u2019t have that strength. He\u2019d had to fight every second for the past five years to remain aloof, to keep from taking her, until the battle had been lost.</p><p>She had come to him innocent, sweet, and pure. Her illusion of sexual experience and wild disposition was just that, an illusion. It had taken him a while to see through it, to realize certain things about his tempestuous Rogue.</p> <p>She was sugar sweet on the inside; that hard outer core was so fragile that it defied understanding. She was too gentle, she was too much of everything that he didn\u2019t deserve, should never have. And his soul had claimed her despite his best intentions.</p><p>The dark, ragged core of his being had reached out to her and been comforted by her when Zeke knew he didn\u2019t deserve that comfort.</p><p>She licked her lips and his body clenched in longing. She took a deep breath, lifting her breasts against her T- shirt, and his hands ached to cup the firm mounds.</p><p>She was young, precious. Could she understand the man he was, the man that had been years in the making?</p><p>But she took his hand. Her fingers accepted his as they twined them through hers. Tiny, fragile, so fucking tender. Her hands were like silk and his dwarfed them.</p><p>\u201cA lot of people have been looking for you today,\u201d she told him softly as he drew her into the house. \u201cI assume John found you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJohn found me.\u201d He nodded as he led her inside, then closed and locked the door behind them.</p><p>He set the security alarm, just to be safe. He had no fear of his son walking in on them tonight; he\u2019d made certain Shane was safe in Louisville and that Lucinda kept him there. It wasn\u2019t the fear of his son seeing something he shouldn\u2019t that rode Zeke now. It was the fear of being caught off guard before he could finish what he started.</p><p>\u201cGene\u2019s looking for you,\u201d she told him then. \u201cHe was at the bar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d And he didn\u2019t want to talk about Gene, not yet. They\u2019d been through hell together as boys, and Zeke thought the bond that had developed then would see them through their adult years. He had been more wrong than he could have ever imagined.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re avoiding him?\u201d she asked as he led her through the darkened house.</p><p>He didn\u2019t turn on the lights as he led her through the kitchen to the basement door. It was opened, the light below was still on, lighting the stairs as he led her down them.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m avoiding him,\u201d he agreed.</p><p>\u201cZeke.\u201d She paused halfway down the steps, tugging at his hand.</p> <p>Zeke turned back to her. There was no fear in her eyes, but there was a hint of worry.</p><p>\u201cThe answers I have are down here,\u201d he told her, his jaw clenching at the truth of his life, a truth he may not be able to hide for much longer.</p><p>His father had begun this legacy, and now Zeke was going to have to finish it. Finishing it would mean revealing the truth of the past, the truth of what he had nearly become and the boundaries crossed by men he had once respected.</p><p>Dayle Mackay had started this decades ago. With his brother and a few military friends they had destroyed more lives than Zeke wanted to contemplate.</p><p>Zeke had worked ten years to uncover the proof of what Dayle was, and in a few short months the Mackay cousins had managed to do what he had fought to do for a decade.</p><p>But that was okay. He\u2019d let them do it; he had known what they were doing, and he had stood back and watched it unfold as he had been ordered to do. Homeland Security had ripped through Somerset like a plague. Men he hadn\u2019t known were involved had been uncovered as homeland terrorists working for a future destruction of the government as the nation knew it.</p><p>He\u2019d helped gather the evidence last year, and he\u2019d kept his own secrets.</p><p>Until now.</p><p>\u201cI was born in Somerset,\u201d he told her as he led her into the basement.</p><p>Boxes upon boxes of a life he hadn\u2019t wanted to remember were opened now, their contents spilling along the floor and the tables he had used to stack them on.</p><p>\u201cI knew that.\u201d Her fingers were stiff in his hold as she stared around the basement.</p><p>\u201cI left when I was fourteen. I was twenty-seven before I came back.\u201d</p><p>He glanced at her as she nodded slowly, her violet gaze locked on him.</p><p>\u201cI came back, because I thought surely, with Thad Mayes\u2019s death, it couldn\u2019t be as bad as it was when I was a kid. And if it was, I had a plan.\u201d</p><p>Bitterness welled inside him.</p><p>\u201cTo become sheriff,\u201d she stated.</p><p>He nodded at that. \u201cTo become sheriff. To clean out the filth I knew lurked just below the surface of one of the most beautiful areas in the world. I\u2019d make it safe, I thought.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have made it safe, Zeke,\u201d she ventured softly.</p><p>Zeke shook his head as he released her hand. \u201cNo, the Mackay cousins and DHS made it safe. I worked for ten years to gather the evidence I needed, and I was blocked at every turn. I couldn\u2019t figure out how it was happening for years.\u201d</p><p>He moved away from her then. \u201cIt took an old man\u2019s careless comment to remind me of a few things, and then it fell into place.\u201d</p><p>He turned back to her and breathed out harshly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not leaving town,\u201d she said then. \u201cI can see it in your face, Zeke. You\u2019re going to ask me to leave again.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head to that. \u201cIt\u2019s too late for any of us to escape this fucking mess.\u201d</p><p>He turned and faced the contents of the boxes he\u2019d emptied.</p><p>\u201cMom was like a pack rat.\u201d He sighed. \u201cShe had so much junk she had to rent a storage unit for it. When she died and the house burned around her, I just packed all these boxes away after I retrieved them, thinking I\u2019d go through them someday. See what she had kept. I didn\u2019t expect she had everything I had ever searched for. Once I found some of it, it wasn\u2019t that hard to know where to look for the rest of it.\u201d</p><p>There were pictures, there were journals he\u2019d never known his mother kept. Dozens of journals, each day of her life from the day she married Thad Mayes recorded. She had never told him about the journals and he had never known she kept one. After the divorce she never took pictures, so Zeke hadn\u2019t remembered the camera she had carried with her during her marriage to Thad Mayes.</p><p>He\u2019d forgotten most of his life as a child, because remembering always brought him back to the scent of blood in the air, and the betrayal of a father he had adored.</p><p>\u201cWhat were you looking for?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cProof,\u201d he answered, turning back to her. \u201cProof that Dayle Mackay, Nadine Grace, and several of Kentucky\u2019s highest ranking political figures were involved in treason. I knew.\u201d He shook his head as he moved to the pictures. \u201cI\u2019ve always known, I just couldn\u2019t prove it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDayle and Nadine are gone,\u201d she whispered. \u201cThey\u2019re dead, Zeke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re dead, but their legacy lives on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cZeke, you\u2019re scaring me.\u201d</p><p>There was a hint of fear in her voice, in her gaze as he turned back to her, and he knew that the time for the truth was now or never.</p><p>\u201cThirty years ago, there were three friends,\u201d he told her. \u201cThey were as close as brothers.\u201d</p><p>He laid out the three individual pictures. Thad Mayes, Gene\u2019s father, James Maynard, and Danny Jones.</p><p>\u201cThese friends hunted together, they partied together, and like the Mackays did for a time, they fucked together.\u201d His lips quirked bitterly at the little gasp that fell from her lips.</p><p>\u201cThen, along came a woman.\u201d He pulled another picture free, that of Nadine Grace, then Nadine Mackay.</p><p>There was a series of pictures then. Depraved, sexual acts the three men were involved in with the woman that had been photographed. He glanced at Rogue\u2019s face and saw in her eyes the same disgust he felt each time he had looked at those pictures after finding them. He had no idea who had taken them, or why. But they were the reason his mother had died.</p><p>\u201cThen, Nadine Mackay set her eyes on another man.\u201d He drew a picture of a young John Calvin Walker free.</p><p>He looked like his son, John. This picture showed Cal Walker in front of the Bar, a bright smile on his face as he shook Danny Jones\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cNow, he and Danny \u2018Jonesy\u2019 Jones were good friends. But I don\u2019t think he knew what Jonesy was involved in with his other friends. Until this woman showed up.\u201d</p><p>Rogue\u2019s mother, Brianna Evansworth.</p><p>\u201cZeke,\u201d she whispered. \u201cDon\u2019t destroy me.\u201d</p><p>He turned back to her and saw the fear and desperation in her face.</p><p>Zeke shook his head. \u201cYour father loved her the moment he saw her.\u201d He turned back to the pictures. \u201cDo you know why your father left Somerset?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head slowly, her eyes filling with tears.</p><p>\u201cBecause Dayle Mackay wanted her,\u201d he stated. \u201cDayle wanted the Evansworth money that backed her, and he asked his three friends, Thad, James, and Jonesy, to help him.\u201d</p><p>It was all recorded in his mother\u2019s journal. Years of sexual excess and photos that Dayle Mackay had sent to Thad Mayes when he\u2019d tried to deny the other man anything that he wanted.</p><p>\u201cJonesy refused. That\u2019s why his leg is messed up. Not from that motorcycle wreck, though that didn\u2019t help it. He was shot in the leg by his good friend Thad Mayes when it was learned he had warned Cal Walker that Dayle Mackay was going to try to take the woman he loved. Dayle thought a woman could be trained like a dog. Chain it up, starve it, abuse it, and it will come to heel.\u201d</p><p>Sickness welled inside him.</p><p>\u201cCal and Brianna left for Boston,\u201d he said. \u201cJonesy stayed, his friendship with Thad and James supposedly severed. But Somerset was his home. He eventually married and had a daughter. Thad divorced and his wife and son moved away, and James\u2019s son, Gene, slowly separated himself from his father. They weren\u2019t happy times for that little group, were they?\u201d He glanced back at her.</p><p>\u201cExcept for my father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept for your father,\u201d he agreed.</p><p>\u201cWe flash to the present now,\u201d he said. \u201cJoe and Jaime. They were in love with a girl.\u201d</p><p>He turned to her, his chest heavy as she stared back at him. \u201cA very young girl, and they were going to share her. And this is where things get dicey. This is where the sins of the father come back to haunt them.\u201d</p><p>He ran his hands over his face wearily. \u201cThis is where the sons have to pay the price for their fathers\u2019 crimes maybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know the woman they were seeing?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI think I know who she was. And I know why the boys and their grandmother died.\u201d</p><p>He slid a picture free. Gene, when he was younger, a teenager. It came from a stack of pictures that showed his friend throughout his life, until Thad Mayes\u2019s death actually.</p><p>Because Thad believed in insurance. He had sent his ex-wife pictures for years. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He fanned the pictures over the table as Rogue moved forward. She stared down at them as he did, that same black fury growing inside him as her hand lifted to his arm and her fingers tightened there.</p><p>\u201cOh God,\u201d she whispered when she came to the pictures that incriminated the man he had once thought of as a brother. The picture of Gene, his father, and Thad as they stood together with another couple, all dressed in camo gear, rifles held easily in their arms.</p><p>The couple they stood with was Dayle Mackay and Nadine Grace.</p> <p>\u201cThey were a part of the Freedom League,\u201d she whispered as she stared at the pictures.</p><p>\u201cEven Gene.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t hard to miss. The FL was emblazoned on the shoulders of their camo gear, but even more incriminating were the bound bodies in front of them. The dead bodies of two state police officers that had gone missing ten years ago.</p><p>It was an unsolved case, one that Zeke had been investigating himself for years. All this time, and the proof was under his nose.</p><p>\u201cGoddammit, all this time.\u201d He swung away from her, the fury erupting inside him. \u201cI had the proof all this time. That son of a bitch father of mine was sending Mom sealed envelopes of pictures and she never even opened them. Boxes of information, of proof.</p> <p>She kept them in boxes in a frigging rental unit in Los Angeles and never even opened them.\u201d</p><p>Because she had known what they were. He\u2019d read parts of her journals, bits and pieces.</p><p>No one would have suspected Thad Mayes of sending his ex-wife anything so incriminating. She hadn\u2019t been a part of the League\u2014it was the reason for their divorce\u2014but still, she had kept his secrets, kept his evidence against himself and the men he had banded together with.</p><p>Just in case, she had written in her journal. He had asked her to take anything he sent her and place it, unopened, in a safe place. He\u2019d collect it later, he had promised. He had never collected it.</p><p>A few months before her death she had written in that last journal that Thad was going to make life easier for her. Zeke was grown and on his own, and it was time she enjoyed her life. She\u2019d threatened to turn the pictures over to the authorities. Pictures she had taken while she had been with him, pictures of the men that had formed the Freedom League. She\u2019d had no idea the proof she had actually held in that damned rental unit.</p><p>Proof far more incriminating than what she\u2019d had herself.</p> <p>She\u2019d stored that journal away, the last one she had written in before she was killed. A year later, Thad Mayes had died in another inferno that had burned his body and any evidence he may have kept himself. That had been mere months after the picture of the two dead state police officers had been taken.</p><p>\u201cJoe and Jaime were seeing Gene\u2019s youngest daughter, Cammi,\u201d Rogue said faintly.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what this is all about, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Zeke felt as though the tension was going to break him apart. His muscles, his bones, were tight with the fury racing through him.</p><p>\u201cShe had to have been the girl they were seeing. Joe and Jaime knew Gene was a part of the Freedom League,\u201d he said harshly. \u201cThey knew, and they didn\u2019t say anything because of Cammi. Because they were in love with her. But someone overheard a conversation they had. One where Jaime stated that Gene was a part of what happened last year with the Mackays. That he\u2019d use it against her father if he caused them too much trouble. They died because of what they knew, and that\u2019s why Callie Walker died as well. Because Gene had to keep his part in this a secret.\u201d His fists clenched at his side.</p><p>\u201cBecause he was still a part of the League.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have proof?\u201d</p><p>Zeke shook his head. \u201cAll I have is proof that he was part of the League, and the deaths of those officers.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat are you going to do, Zeke?\u201d she asked. \u201cGene is at the bar looking for you. He said he\u2019d been trying to contact you all day. He has to be suspicious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve faxed the pictures to Agent Cranston,\u201d he told her as he turned to her. \u201cI want you to stay here, Rogue, where you\u2019ll be safe. No one will know you\u2019re here. The bar could be torched with you in it. They don\u2019t care to kill innocent bystanders. I\u2019m meeting the Mackay cousins and Agent Cranston in town in an hour. We\u2019ll take care of this tonight.</p><p>All of it.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d been busy. The moment Teddy Winfred\u2019s information had clicked in his brain Zeke had come home to search for the pictures he had himself from his youth. In searching for them, he\u2019d found the boxes of sealed, mailed envelopes his mother had kept. The information in her journals had shocked him, enraged him. It had taken most of the day to find everything, and there were still more to go through. But he had what he needed.</p><p>\u201cWhat about Cammi?\u201d she asked. \u201cShe\u2019s not part of this, Zeke.\u201d</p><p>He stared at her in surprise. Cammi had never been kind to Rogue. She had sneered at her, insulted her countless times over the years, but still Rogue was thinking of her.</p><p>And, as Rogue stated, Cammi was innocent of everything but wanting the wrong men.</p><p>He hoped.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll watch out for Cammi,\u201d he promised her. \u201cI want your promise that you\u2019ll stay here, keep your phone off, stay out of contact.\u201d</p><p>He held her gaze, willing, determined that she would do exactly as he wanted her to do.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t give her promises yet, he couldn\u2019t let himself believe in promises yet, not until this was finished.</p><p>\u201cWhat aren\u2019t you telling me?\u201d She asked the question he hoped she wouldn\u2019t. \u201cHow are you involved in this, Zeke?\u201d</p><p>He leaned against the old desk, crossed his arms over his chest, and watched her carefully.</p><p>\u201cLook at those pictures again,\u201d he told her softly. \u201cThe earlier ones, Rogue. I was fourteen before Mom divorced that bastard. The League is generational, baby. I was a part of it before we went to Los Angeles. Before I even understood what it meant, I was there. I hunted with them, I listened to their plans, and I let myself be convinced I was right, they were right. This is why I came back, to see it finished. The Mackays cut off the head of the organization, but the body\u2019s still alive. It can reform if it\u2019s not finished.</p><p>This will finish it. My mother and my wife were killed as a warning. Gene has to know how close I am to revealing his part in this. I can\u2019t risk you. I\u2019d die if I lost you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s more.\u201d She shook her head, those flaming curls whispering around her shoulders and down her back as she stared back at him from the most beautiful eyes in the world.</p><p>He\u2019d tried to hide from what he felt for her. From the time he first saw her, until now.</p><p>As though a veil lifted from his soul, Zeke saw what he didn\u2019t want to see. Emotions fueled by needs. The knowledge that this one woman had been created for him. She could be his greatest strength or his greatest weakness in the hands of his enemies.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve played everyone,\u201d she finally said softly. \u201cYou\u2019ve suspected all this, all along.</p><p>Didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>He barely managed to hide his surprise.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure I know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d He forced himself away from the table, paced to the other side of the room, then turned back to her.</p><p>\u201cYou suspected Gene was a part of the League and that Joe and Jaime had somehow been killed because of the group.\u201d</p><p>She hadn\u2019t moved, but her gaze followed him, thoughtful, partially angry.</p><p>\u201cWhat part did I play in this, Zeke?\u201d she asked him as she waved her hand toward the scattered papers and pictures. \u201cHow did sleeping with me help you to get where you were trying to go?\u201d</p><p>His jaw clenched. Hell, he was hoping she wouldn\u2019t see that, because while that\u2019s what it may have begun as, it wasn\u2019t finishing that way.</p><p>\u201cThey were watching me,\u201d he finally said softly. \u201cThey were focused on my investigation of Joe and Jaime\u2019s death. They weren\u2019t watching DHS or the Mackay boys.</p><p>Cranston was never suspended from duty, officially. The Mackays were never off the case. Gene\u2019s been watching you for years, simply because you were Calvin\u2019s daughter and because Jonesy tried to protect you. He wondered what you knew, what Jonesy knew. I let them focus on that while the others did their job.\u201d</p><p>Rogue felt the pain explode in her chest as Zeke stared back at her. The lack of emotion in his voice, in his eyes, cut her to the quick.</p><p>\u201cIt was all some elaborate ruse then?\u201d she whispered. \u201cIt was never about us, was it, Zeke?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t afford for it to be about us, Rogue,\u201d he said softly as he turned away from her again. \u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t turning away because he couldn\u2019t bear to see her hurt, she saw. He was turning away to collect the weapons that lay on the other side of the room. His gun belt and weapon, which he strapped on efficiently. The rifle he collected from the side of the wall.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re an intelligent woman,\u201d he said, his tone so precise, so cool she felt flayed by the very lack of emotion in it. \u201cStay here where you\u2019re safe. Stay off the phone. I\u2019ll let you know when it\u2019s finished.\u201d</p><p>She fought back her tears and her anger. She tried to swallow and felt as though she would choke from the tightness in her throat.</p><p>\u201cJohn,\u201d she whispered. \u201cWhat about my brother?\u201d</p><p>God, John had been right all along. This wasn\u2019t about love, it wasn\u2019t about anything Zeke might want from her emotionally. It was about a very elaborate deception. It was all about his job, nothing more.</p><p>\u201cNatches has John out of the way,\u201d he promised her. \u201cHe\u2019s safe. You\u2019re safe. Now let me clean up my town and undo the damage Thad Mayes did to this county without leaving any more scars on my conscience.\u201d</p><p>Scars on his conscience. He was protecting her so he wouldn\u2019t feel any guilt if she ended up hurt. It was no more than that. She wanted to go to her knees from the pain; instead, she managed to hold her head upright and even managed to nod.</p><p>\u201cBy all means.\u201d She forced a tight smile to her face; she even managed not to shed a tear. \u201cI\u2019m sure I can find something to do here while you\u2019re out saving the world.\u201d She waved her hand negligently back at him. \u201cHave fun, Sheriff Mayes.\u201d</p><p>Be safe, Zeke. She whispered the words silently as he turned and headed for the stairs.</p><p>She wouldn\u2019t cry yet, she promised herself. She wasn\u2019t going to let herself shed more tears for another betrayal. She\u2019d shed enough, she\u2019d lost enough dreams. She wouldn\u2019t lose her pride as well.</p><p>His foot rested on the first step before he paused. His back was still to her when he said,</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want things to be this way.\u201d</p><p>Lips trembling, she had to force back the cry welling in her soul. She hated him. Oh God, she hated him! She hated him just as much as she loved him.</p><p>\u201cBut they are,\u201d she said, barely holding back the pain now. \u201cWe\u2019ll talk later, Zeke. You have a job to do. Right?\u201d</p><p>He nodded, his head still turned away. \u201cI have a job to do.\u201d</p><p>With that, he moved quickly up the stairs and left her alone with a basement filled with his memories, his life. Pictures and boxes of mementos. Sand in a bottle. Seashells. A framed picture of his wedding day. Shane\u2019s first photo as a newborn. And stacks of pictures from Zeke\u2019s childhood.</p><p>She turned and stared around the basement, willing her heart not to shatter into the pieces she knew it had already shattered into. She could feel the jagged wound in her soul and the ache that seemed never ending.</p><p>Pressing her hand into her stomach she pushed back the sob locked in her throat and took a deep, hard breath. Her knees were shaking, her hands trembling, and damn Zeke Mayes to hell, there were tears on her face.</p><p>Her breathing hitched as she wrapped her arms across her breasts and turned away from the pictures, the story he had told her. There were gaps, there was something missing. Something he hadn\u2019t told her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Rogue turned back and stalked to the table, scrambling for the pictures, searching for answers. There had to be answers here. There was more to this than he had told her.</p><p>There was something in his eyes that assured her of that before he left. There were demons that haunted him, dark places that festered in his soul. Parts of him that she had sensed and yet had never known.</p><p>There were secrets.</p> <p>She pushed aside the first piles of pictures, went through the others. She stacked them in neat, orderly rows as she moved through them.</p><p>There were Zeke\u2019s baby pictures. Pictures of him with his mother and father as a toddler, pictures as he grew and became a teenager.</p><p>The majority of the pictures after his teen years were those with his father. In each progression there was a hardness to Thad Mayes\u2019s once-handsome face. A cold reptilian chill began showing in his eyes.</p><p>There were pictures that raised the hair on the back of her neck. Pictures of Thad Mayes, James Maynard, and Dayle Mackay participating in sex acts that would have brought shame to the most hedonistic of men. But there were no more pictures of Zeke.</p><p>\u201cHe burned them all, you know.\u201d</p> <p>Rogue jerked around, fear strangling her as she saw a panel slide open to reveal a gap in the cement wall of the basement, and watched as Jonesy stepped through it.</p><p>Eyes round, terror surging through her, she watched as he moved into the basement and looked around slowly, his expression heavy and filled with regret as his gaze came back to hers.</p><p>\u201cJonesy,\u201d she whispered, a sob finally tearing from her throat.</p><p>\u201cWe were always the best of friends,\u201d he said softly. \u201cMe, Thad, and James. Your daddy didn\u2019t change that. There were just some things that I was too young to understand then.\u201d</p><p>He stepped fully into the room and then she saw the handgun he held at his side. The one he lifted slowly and aimed toward her.</p><p>\u201cJohn\u2019s dead,\u201d he said. \u201cI took care of him and that Mackay bastard before I came here for you and the sheriff.\u201d</p> <p>She shook her head; her hands clenched desperately around the rim of the table beside her as she lowered her head and shuddered from the pain. Not Jonesy. Oh God, she couldn\u2019t bear it. She loved him like an uncle. He\u2019d saved her when she needed him.</p><p>He\u2019d been her friend.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d she sobbed, her head lifting as fury began to pour inside her. \u201cWhy, Jonesy?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cThe bastard burned the pictures of his boy while he obviously saved all the others. Thad was a fool. I warned him that little son of a bitch would end up turning up and taking a bite out of our asses. He always was a foolish little prick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d she demanded again. \u201cWhy are you here? Why are you involved in this?\u201d</p><p>He tilted his head and watched her almost curiously.</p><p>\u201cBecause, despite your sheriff\u2019s beliefs, the head of the serpent was never cut off, sweetheart. Mackay didn\u2019t have the temperament to be the head of anything. He took orders. He was a soldier that became a liability. He was a disease. The head is alive and breathing.\u201d He smiled, a cold, hard curve to his lips. \u201cAnd Zeke might run, but he can\u2019t hide from the truth. He\u2019s a part of it. He\u2019ll always be a part of it.\u201d</p><p>TWENTY-TWO</p> <p>She was hurting. Zeke swore he could feel her hurtas he left the house and forced himself into the Tahoe he had hidden in the back drive. The vehicle was hidden there, beneath a dense covering of trees where it wouldn\u2019t be detected, along an old dirt farm road his father had used when his parents had lived in this house.</p><p>His father had moved into another house closer to town after Zeke and his mother had left. The farm had been pretty much abandoned for years, until Zeke returned.</p><p>It was the hardest thing Zeke had ever done, forcing himself into the vehicle before starting the engine and pulling out of the drive. He headed back toward the Bar when everything inside him was urging him to return to the house, to explain, to tell her why this had to be done and the ghosts he had to exorcise from his own past.</p><p>His mother hadn\u2019t left his father simply because of his adulterous activities. Nothing was ever that simple with his mother. She had divorced Thad Mayes because he had finally crossed a line that was unacceptable to her. He had tricked his son into committing a crime that she knew would haunt him for the rest of his life.</p><p>At the age of fourteen, Zeke had shot and killed a man. It didn\u2019t matter that he had killed another of the League\u2019s members, one that his father wanted rid of. It didn\u2019t matter that the man was a deviant with the sexual tastes of the criminally insane. The fact was, Zeke had killed him. He had lifted his father\u2019s handgun from the table, turned, and shot the bastard in the heart, just as his father had taught him during target practice.</p><p>The old hunting cabin where the murder had taken place was gone now; someone had burned it to the ground after Zeke and his mother left town. Zeke often wondered if his father had destroyed it. If he\u2019d ever regretted that night and fought to get rid of the memories as well.</p><p>Zeke still had nightmares. He still remembered his father\u2019s pride, how he had lifted the slain man\u2019s head in one hand and smiled back at the camera James Maynard had wielded, as though the death were a triumph.</p><p>Zeke had become ill. He\u2019d thrown up for days. For weeks he\u2019d been unable to sleep, until he finally told his mother what had happened. It was then that she had packed their bags and escaped with him to Los Angeles, along with many of the pictures she knew his father had.</p><p>Her insurance, she had called it. And Thad Mayes had sent her more insurance over the years. He\u2019d been confident she wouldn\u2019t talk; she knew the price of talking. Everyone who talked died. Proof didn\u2019t matter, but she\u2019d had enough to keep her safe.</p><p>Now Zeke was breaking that unwritten law of keeping silent. He had talked. Years ago he had talked to Timothy Cranston when the plans to trap the homeland terrorist group were first being hatched.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t known the Mackays would be brought in on it. He hadn\u2019t known he would be pushed out of the investigation once it started. He hadn\u2019t known about the pictures his mother had amassed. But he knew now. DHS knew now. They knew everything, even his own crime.</p><p>He\u2019d stayed as far away from her as possible until it wasn\u2019t possible any longer, he told himself. But he hadn\u2019t used her to the extent she believed. Taking her to his bed had been something he\u2019d been unable to fight. But still, it had played into the job he had set for himself. That of trapping the last members of the League.</p><p>He needed Gene\u2019s attention focused on him while Cranston and the Mackay cousins worked their magic to finish the investigation they\u2019d started years before.</p><p>It would come to a head tonight. They had the Walkers\u2019 killers; they had the information on the last of the members of the League in this area as well as others. They had pictures; they had his mother\u2019s journals, all of which would be turned over to Cranston the second they met up. And tonight Gene would be at the bar with the last members of the homeland terrorist organization that would finally be rooted from his county forever.</p><p>It was almost over. More than twenty years of hell, and Zeke would see the end of it tonight. When the sun broke in the morning, the weight of a lifetime of guilt would be lifted from his shoulders, and he would have the satisfaction of knowing he had finished it.</p><p>And tonight, Zeke had broken Rogue\u2019s heart. He\u2019d seen it in her eyes and he\u2019d been helpless to stop it, just as he\u2019d been helpless to stay away from her. He\u2019d grasped at the excuse to forget his own principles and take her to his bed. He\u2019d known what he was doing even as he\u2019d done it, and he\u2019d prayed they\u2019d both survive it.</p><p>He had known he was going to hurt her, but he hadn\u2019t expected to feel that pain as though it were a part of him as well. He hadn\u2019t expected to hurt with her for everything he knew they may not have.</p><p>Not that Zeke was willing to let her go yet. He knew to the bottom of his soul if he survived this night, he\u2019d do his best to heal her heart and claim it again. But if he didn\u2019t return, if he couldn\u2019t come back to her for whatever reason, then he\u2019d know she wouldn\u2019t wait. The pain would ease with the anger, and her hatred would protect him from her loyalty.</p><p>Turning onto the back road that led to Rogue\u2019s bar, Zeke tightened his hands on the wheel of the Tahoe and felt the muscles in his jaw flex at the thought of claiming her, free and clear, knowing there might be a real future, rather than just the here and now, or the hope of a future.</p><p>This had been hanging over his head for too long. The risk of discovery before the remaining members of the League were identified. The risk that the men he was searching for would realize just how deep he was into this rather than watching from the sidelines as it had appeared.</p><p>At this point, nothing mattered but finishing this and getting back to Rogue to explain, to beg for forgiveness. To touch her. To know he had the right to touch her as he needed to. God help him, as he needed to.</p><p>The need to touch her, to taste her one last time had been nearly overwhelming. If he had though, he\u2019d have not made it out of the house without possessing her, without telling her the truth. Without loving her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be back, Rogue,\u201d he whispered, and he wished he had said it before he left.</p><p>He made the final turn toward the bar when the world exploded around him.</p><p>Zeke slammed on the brakes as a ball of fire erupted into the night where Rogue\u2019s bar had been. Debris and flames tore through the darkness as vehicles were racing out of the parking lot.</p><p>It rained fire. The ground shook with a secondary explosion, spurring Zeke to slam his foot on the gas as he flipped the sirens on.</p><p>The Mackay cousins and Rogue\u2019s brother were in that bar. They were waiting in the office, watching through the security cameras as Gene met with the other members of the League that were still free at the bar. He\u2019d been meeting them right beneath Zeke\u2019s nose. So confident. Damn him. He\u2019d taken Zeke\u2019s trust for granted, had taken his loyalty for granted.</p><p>All these years he had trusted Gene with the truth. He\u2019d discussed each move he\u2019d made with the other man; he\u2019d let him in on every step he\u2019d taken. And he\u2019d been betrayed. He\u2019d hoped he was wrong. Prayed he was wrong. He had never imagined the depths of Gene\u2019s guilt though.</p><p>That betrayal was like acid on his tongue as the Tahoe screamed into the bar\u2019s parking lot. The vehicle slid to a stop, rocking from the force applied to the brakes as Zeke caught sight of Dawg dragging Natches and John across the parking lot.</p><p>He jumped from the vehicle, racing toward them.</p><p>\u201cCranston and Rowdy. Where are they?\u201d he screamed as he gripped Dawg\u2019s shoulders, holding him in place.</p><p>Dawg\u2019s face was pale, blood streaked, his green eyes wild. \u201cInside. Goddammit, they\u2019re inside.\u201d</p><p>Everything inside Zeke began to congeal in complete rage. Turning on his heel, he ran for the bar. Pushing through the hysterical guests pouring from the main entrance to stagger into the smoky haze inside as he searched for the other two men.</p><p>\u201cCranston!\u201d he screamed out the agent\u2019s name.</p><p>\u201cI have him.\u201d</p><p>Zeke turned, staring in shock as Gene stumbled through the smoky haze.</p><p>He and Rowdy supported Cranston\u2019s half- conscious form. Gene\u2019s blond hair was singed, soot covered his face. A gash along his forehead seeped blood and Rowdy didn\u2019t look much better.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get the hell out of here.\u201d Zeke took Rowdy\u2019s weight as he swayed and nearly went to his knees. \u201cSon of a bitch, their wives will kill me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo shit,\u201d Gene snarled furiously, his blue eyes enraged. \u201cIf I don\u2019t end up killing every friggin\u2019 damned one of you myself. Motherfuckers. This is what I get for trusting a slimy damned Homeland Security agent and my best fucking friend.\u201d</p><p>Confusion and rage clouded Zeke\u2019s mind. With his hands full of Rowdy\u2019s nearly unconscious form, he couldn\u2019t slug Gene. He followed him instead, finally having to duck and sling Rowdy\u2019s weight over his shoulder to rush him from the bar as another explosion shook it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Too damned much liquor. It was going off like mini-bombs as the fire began to race through the entire building.</p><p>\u201cThank God. Son of a bitch. Son of a bitch.\u201d Dawg raced toward them, his green eyes demented in his haggard face. \u201cIs he alive?\u201d</p><p>Dawg jerked Rowdy from Zeke as Gene collapsed on the grass, far enough away from the bar for safety, and let Timothy Cranston\u2019s weight slide to the ground.</p> <p>\u201cWhat the hell happened here?\u201d Zeke jerked Dawg around, glaring down at him as sirens began to fill the air.</p><p>\u201cWe fucked up, that\u2019s what the hell happened,\u201d Dawg screamed. \u201cYou were watching the wrong man. Fucking Cranston, I\u2019m killing the son of a bitch this time. He had us watch Gene when Gene was working with him all along. He wasn\u2019t the man we were searching for.\u201d</p><p>Dawg was out of control. Thick, heavy veins pulsed in his neck as his green eyes glowed with a rage that warned Zeke that the other man wouldn\u2019t think before killing.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you talking about? You were watching the wrong man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m not your goddamned killer, you fucking moron.\u201d Gene stumbled to his feet, swaying before righting himself. \u201cAnd Cranston knew it. The dirty bastard, I\u2019ve been working with him since the day those two state police offers were killed. Yeah, the fucking pictures you found?\u201d he sneered in Zeke\u2019s face. \u201cI didn\u2019t kill those men, Zeke.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou were there!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was there, and my whole fucking family was at risk if I made the first fucking wrong move!\u201d Gene screamed. \u201cMy family, Zeke. My wife. My kids. I contacted someone I knew in DHS after the bodies were taken away. The morbid motherfucker had me watching you.\u201d</p><p>Shock resounded through Zeke with a tidal wave force as he stared back at Gene.</p><p>Cranston was a manipulating bastard, there was no doubt of that. From the moment he had hit town with the supposed excuse of having been suspended, Zeke had known he was playing games. Hell, Zeke had been helping him play those games, and he\u2019d never suspected he was being hung out to dry like every other agent that ever worked for Cranston was hung out.</p><p>\u201cHe had me watching you,\u201d Zeke rasped.</p><p>\u201cAnd the killer got away.\u201d Dawg pushed between the two men. \u201cYour killer is Jonesy, Zeke. He slipped out of the bar after taking a baseball bat to Natches and Walker. He\u2019s gone.\u201d</p> <p>Zeke stared back at him, fighting to process the information bombarding him now.</p><p>He turned to Gene, the suspicions tearing through him now were destructive. Cranston had known all along. Like Zeke, he had no proof of his suspicions, unlike Zeke, he hadn\u2019t been chasing shadows. Cranston had had them all chasing shadows as he focused on Jonesy.</p><p>\u201cDid you know it was Jonesy?\u201d Zeke rasped back at Gene.</p><p>Gene shook his head furiously. \u201cJonesy wasn\u2019t part of the League, Zeke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d Zeke grabbed him by his shirt collar and jerked him closer. \u201cThink, Gene. Did he know about the house? My house?\u201d</p><p>Did Jonesy know about the secret tunnel into the basement, or the entrance to it?</p><p>Gene\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cGod. You hid her at the house. God, no, Zeke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he know about the house?\u201d Zeke shook him roughly. \u201cDid he know about the tunnel into the basement?\u201d</p> <p>It was the only way to get to her without setting off the alarms that would have instantly rang Zeke\u2019s phone. It was the only way anyone could get to Rogue.</p><p>\u201cZeke, it was his idea,\u201d Gene rasped. \u201cDad told me about it. Jonesy helped plan the construction of that tunnel years before your father ever built the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t supposed to be like this.\u201d Jonesy\u2019s voice was saddened, filled with regret, but Rogue also saw the maniacal glimmer of determination in his eyes as he slowly closed the panel to the hidden tunnel.</p><p>He stared around the room, his expression resolved, but also heavy. As though two men resided inside him, but the one that held the gun was now dominant.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t supposed to be like what, Jonesy?\u201d She stared at the gun incredulously. \u201cLike a man betraying everyone who loves him?\u201d</p><p>She knew the moment she saw the gun that Gene wasn\u2019t the only man that had betrayed a friend. Of course it had been in the pictures as well. Those scattered across Zeke\u2019s desk. The three men, Thad Mayes, James Maynard, and Jonesy. The friendship they had forged as young men hadn\u2019t been broken. The friendship that had aided Dayle Mackay and Nadine Grace in their treasonous activities had never disintegrated. It had remained strong, regardless of what others thought. A bond such as the three had shared would have been nearly impossible to break completely.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not betraying a friend.\u201d He locked gazes with her, anger shadowing his eyes. \u201cA friend would have listened when I warned her to steer clear of trouble. Your daddy listened. He took his woman and he left town, like I told him to do. Unfortunately, he didn\u2019t come back and collect his daughter as I\u2019ve warned him to do in the past five years. For some reason, Cal thought the threat was gone because Thad, Dayle, and Nadine were gone.\u201d He shook his head with a mocking little grunt. \u201cHe didn\u2019t consider James a threat, and he thought Gene\u2019s loyalty would stay with Zeke. He\u2019s not as smart as he used to be, Rogue. Or maybe he really just doesn\u2019t care what happens to his troublemaking daughter.\u201d</p><p>That wasn\u2019t the case. Her father had screamed, harassed, and threatened her for five years in an attempt to get her back to Boston. His last-ditch effort was sending in John.</p><p>Her breathing hitched harshly. Oh God, John.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s John?\u201d she whispered, his claim that he had killed her brother ricocheting through her mind. \u201cWhat have you done, Jonesy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame thing I did to Thad.\u201d He sighed. \u201cThat baseball bat I keep at the bar has a lot of blood staining it, Rogue. Now it has your brother\u2019s and Natches Mackay\u2019s as well. Right now, they\u2019re burning in the flames of hell. I set an explosion in the bar. It\u2019s gone, little girl. Gone along with your brother, Timothy Cranston, and those bastard Mackay cousins.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Her head shook in disbelief. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t hurt John. Jonesy, please. You didn\u2019t hurt John.\u201d</p><p>Where was the man her father had said he would trust his life to? The man Rogue had trusted her life to?</p><p>Jonesy shook his head, regret filling his eyes though the gun never wavered. \u201cI told you to stay away from Zeke Mayes, Rogue. He\u2019s been trying to identify the remaining members of the League for six months now. Hell, we knew all along that he was working for DHS to take us down. Gene kept us informed there. The League has to survive. Our plans will go through. The future is more important than friendship or blood, girl.\u201d His voice rose as anger filled it. His expression creased in fury as his hand tightened around the gun.</p><p>Rogue could feel the deadly intent that washed through the room now. Jonesy was going to kill her. She could see it in his eyes, in his face. The man she had thought she had known didn\u2019t exist. Nothing existed behind the eyes she had once thought she could read except anger and murderous determination.</p><p>Betrayal was a rancid taste in her mouth as she fought to swallow past the tightness in her throat. Rogue wanted to howl with the pain now. She could feel the sharp wounds burying inside her soul, digging into her with merciless agony.</p><p>Tears were locked in her throat and in her eyes as she stared back at Jonesy, from his powerful shoulders to the insanity glittering in his eyes. It could only be insanity. There could be nothing sane about what he was doing. He had killed John and Natches.</p><p>John lit up the world with his games and his laughter. He was cynical, sometimes he was bitter, but he had loved her, made her laugh.</p><p>And Natches, with his crooked grin and his complete devotion to his wife and unborn child. He liked to joke that his wife would be the one to kill him eventually. Instead, it had been Jonesy. A trusted friend.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t believe either of them were dead. John and Natches both were tough; they were strong. Jonesy might have hurt them, but she refused to believe they weren\u2019t alive any longer.</p><p>Especially John. The brother who had taught her how to fight, the one that hid frogs in her drawers when she was a child, yet had bloodied his friend\u2019s nose when she was younger for frightening her. He had protected her. He loved her. She couldn\u2019t lose him.</p><p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s a hard thing, realizing it\u2019s your fault your brother\u2019s dead. Your friends.\u201d A flash of regret clouded his eyes for long seconds. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t easy to dispose of John, I want you to know that. But it wasn\u2019t near as hard as killing Thad Mayes was. We were like brothers. But he was a weakness to the League. All that picture taking him and James Maynard had done. He threatened us with those pictures, you know? He wanted out. Wanted to go to L.A. to be with that bastard son of his.\u201d Jonesy snorted at that. \u201cHe grew weak in his old age. Then that stupid wife of his trying to blackmail us and his dumb kid asking the wrong questions. We took care of Thad\u2019s wife, and Zeke\u2019s, too.</p><p>And we took care of Thad. Thought Zeke got the message, loud and clear. When he came back here, I was gonna let it go. He was nice and quiet, wasn\u2019t making any waves that I knew of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Joe and Jaime?\u201d she whispered, her fingers tightening into fists as she stared back at him. \u201cYou killed them, too, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>He smiled at that. \u201cThey trusted me. Joe came to me, said he knew Gene was a part of the League. He wanted to use that information to make Gene back off where that girl of his was concerned. They were stupid, Rogue, and that grandmother of theirs wasn\u2019t any smarter. The stupid bitch even called me, asking about Gene.\u201d He shook his head at that. \u201cSo I killed her, too. And no one suspected. You know she cried when I picked her up out of that bed and told her what I was going to do. Cried tears and begged me not to.\u201d</p><p>And he had enjoyed it. Rogue saw it in his face. Jonesy had enjoyed killing Callie Walker. The same way he would enjoy killing her, she realized.</p><p>\u201cHow do you think you\u2019re going to get away with this, Jonesy?\u201d Her voice was filled with tears, tears she refused to shed. She wouldn\u2019t give him the satisfaction of begging or crying. She wouldn\u2019t let him enjoy what he was getting ready to do to that extent.</p><p>\u201cZeke will know Gene didn\u2019t do this. You\u2019ve killed too many people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd anyone who would have talked is dead by now.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cI rigged the main gas tank to explode at the bar. It would have taken out most of the building, especially the back section where Gene was meeting with the few members left in town. I got John and Natches, and Cranston along with the other two Mackay cousins aren\u2019t a threat if they managed to survive it. The League will reform without the weak bastards that were cowering in their homes praying not to get arrested. I\u2019ll rebuild the League here, and one day, it will be more glorious than ever before.\u201d</p><p>That damned League. The Freedom League. The group of military and ex-military fanatics that thought they could wage a revolution and take control of the government.</p><p>Rogue would have laughed if the situation weren\u2019t so desperate right now.</p><p>\u201cHomeland Security broke the League, Jonesy,\u201d she reminded him. \u201cAll but a few stragglers are in prison or dead. Your generals are gone. The money is gone. How can you rebuild after that?\u201d</p><p>She had to think, she had to keep him talking, give herself a chance to get away from him. She couldn\u2019t let him kill her; she couldn\u2019t let him hurt anyone else that she loved.</p><p>\u201cRebuilding is never hard.\u201d He shrugged his broad shoulders at her question. \u201cYou just need the right men in place. I have those connections. I know how to do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a bartender,\u201d she rasped. \u201cIn Kentucky, Jonesy. This isn\u2019t a major metropolis. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>What connections could you have?\u201d</p><p>He chuckled at her question. \u201cPoor Rogue. I know it has to be hard to die, sweetheart. I promise, I\u2019ll make sure it doesn\u2019t hurt.\u201d He lifted the gun.</p><p>\u201cLook at the pictures, Jonesy. Zeke already knows you\u2019re involved.\u201d She threw her hand out to the table where the pictures were scattered. \u201cThad Mayes wasn\u2019t stupid. He sent Zeke\u2019s mother pictures. He doesn\u2019t even have all of them here,\u201d she lied. \u201cHe went after the others. Don\u2019t you think Thad would have protected himself, even from you?\u201d</p> <p>He paused, his eyes narrowing as it flickered to the table and the pictures. \u201cI burned those pictures,\u201d he seemed to wheeze.</p><p>\u201cHe made copies,\u201d she warned him. \u201cLots of copies, Jonesy. He sent them to Zeke\u2019s mother, and you know he sent them other places. He knew you would betray him, Jonesy. Zeke\u2019s going to know when he finds them all. He\u2019ll know you blew up the bar.</p><p>You\u2019re missing now. He\u2019ll notice you\u2019re missing.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head slowly. \u201cI covered my ass. Everyone but you heard me say I had to leave this evening. I wasn\u2019t supposed to be there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll know, Jonesy. He knows you were calling me before I arrived here. He\u2019ll figure it out, especially when he finds the other pictures.\u201d</p> <p>It was a desperate lie, but it was logical to her. Thad had sent Zeke\u2019s mother pictures; he could have sent other copies elsewhere.</p><p>\u201cThere are no pictures in there of me.\u201d But indecision flickered in his gaze.</p><p>Rogue forced a mocking smile to her lips. \u201cBut there are, Jonesy. There are several.\u201d She moved back and waved her hand toward the hundreds of pictures scattered over the table. \u201cJust look. He has all he needs to take you down just as the others were taken down.\u201d</p><p>She wouldn\u2019t have much time. Rogue fought to keep the thunder of her heart from her ears and to keep panic from setting in. She couldn\u2019t think about John or Natches; she couldn\u2019t let herself sink into the well of despair waiting on her.</p><p>She was logical. She could find a way out of this. She searched the room through her peripheral vision and tried to find a means of escape as she backed away from the table, allowing Jonesy to move closer to it.</p><p>The basement was cluttered with years of old furniture, clothes, and boxes. There were lamps propped against old tables, a hunting rifle in the other corner, a two-by-four piece of lumber stretched along the back of the couch.</p> <p>She wished she had a weapon. She should have thought and made Zeke leave one with her. He\u2019d left her here, thinking she was protected, and she had believed she would be.</p><p>No, she\u2019d been too shocked to think, too hurt to use her brain rather than her emotions.</p><p>The best-laid plans, she thought sarcastically. Zeke had known about the tunnel. He had thought she would be safe, and if by chance she wasn\u2019t, then he had given her a place to hide. He couldn\u2019t have known that anyone else knew about the tunnel, especially Jonesy, because he didn\u2019t trust Jonesy to begin with.</p><p>\u201cCrazy fucker,\u201d Jonesy muttered as he riffled through a stack of pictures. \u201cHe was always taking these damned pictures. For posterity, he said, and Dayle always laughed and said he had a hold on Thad, that he could keep him in line.\u201d He grimaced tightly as one of the more sexual pictures caught his eye. \u201cHe said he didn\u2019t develop the pictures, and Dayle believed him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you knew better,\u201d she said. \u201cDidn\u2019t you, Jonesy?\u201d</p><p>Jonesy grinned. \u201cI knew better. I knew when he left he\u2019d take those negatives with him.</p><p>I knew he\u2019d betray us for that little bastard of his and the grandson Zeke wouldn\u2019t let him see. Damn, Zeke hated his old man, ya know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know,\u201d she lied again.</p> <p>Jonesy nodded as a thoughtful look crossed his face. He picked up a picture of him, as a much younger man, with Thad and James Maynard. Zeke and Gene were in the pictures. They were just boys, dressed in camo with wide grins on their faces.</p><p>\u201cI guess I\u2019ll have to get rid of James now.\u201d He sighed. \u201cAnd Gene. That will suck.</p><p>Though James is still cowarding like a little girl on his farm. He won\u2019t even go to any of the meetings anymore. He doesn\u2019t want to rebuild what we lost, says he\u2019s too old,\u201d he sneered then. \u201cIf he\u2019s too old to fight, then he\u2019s too old to live, wouldn\u2019t you say?\u201d</p><p>Rogue backed against the couch as his attention turned back to the pictures. Her fingers curled around the six- foot length of two-by-four that lay on the back of it.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t far from him, less than six feet. If she could get a good swing in before he could bring the gun back up, then she might have a chance. That was all she needed, a fighting chance. She refused to stand here like a sacrificial lamb on the altar of his insanity. Freedom League, her ass. Those bastards needed to die anyway. They were all as damned crazy as Jonesy, otherwise they would have never gotten mixed up in such a crazy scheme as taking over the nation.</p><p>\u201cHe seems smart to me,\u201d she said faintly as her fingers tightened on the wood. \u201cSmarter than you.\u201d</p><p>When he turned back to her, she moved. The two-by-four swung for his head before he could react. His arm came up, but not quick enough. He\u2019d taught her what John hadn\u2019t about fighting. He\u2019d taught her how to disarm, how to kick effectively, but more, he\u2019d taught her how to counter a defensive move.</p><p>She was short, weak, he\u2019d always said, so he\u2019d taught her to be effective rather than powerful. Using the momentum of her body, her shoulders, she slammed the wood into his shoulder, causing the gun to drop as she kicked out.</p><p>The heel of her boot caught his chin as she punched back with the end of the two-by-four into his head. Blood sprayed around her before she dropped the wood and ran for the stairs.</p><p>Forget the tunnel, she had no idea where it went. Jonesy was bigger than her, faster; she needed corners and furniture to hide behind, not a tunnel to run through.</p><p>She raced up the stairs cursing her boots even as she gloried in the blood they had shed.</p><p>She slammed open the basement door as the blast behind her sent a bullet tearing through the wood inches above her head.</p><p>Ducking, she slammed the door closed, locked it, then threw a kitchen chair against it before racing to the back door and into the night.</p><p>It was dark and foggy as hell as the mist from the lake shrouded the house and the forest surrounding it. The night oozed a heavy blanket of thick fog, so thick it felt smothering as she stumbled around the house and ducked behind the border of evergreen hedges planted around it.</p><p>A quick glance at the bike had a sob choking her. The tires were flat. There wasn\u2019t a chance of escaping on it. For the moment, all she had were the hedges.</p><p>It was minimal covering, but it was dark, her clothes were dark. Blinking back her tears, she prayed for a chance.</p><p>TWENTY-THREE</p><p>Breathing in slow and deep, Rogue tried to forceback the panic threatening to rise inside her now that she had escaped the house. Surely it wouldn\u2019t be too hard to hide here for a while. Maybe Jonesy would just leave.</p><p>She flinched at the sound of the kitchen door slamming closed.</p><p>The night suddenly seemed malevolent and frightening. Fear congealed inside her as a shiver raced up her spine and she strained to see through the thick fog to the land around her.</p><p>\u201cScary, isn\u2019t it, little girl?\u201d Jonesy\u2019s voice was almost conversational as he spoke into the night. \u201cThe nights get real dark here in the mountains without the city lights to brighten them. Fog rolls in, and you can\u2019t see what\u2019s behind you, or what\u2019s in front of you. It\u2019s real easy to get lost, or to fall over a cliff. Or even worse, fall in the lake. The water is mighty cold this time of the year, Rogue.\u201d</p><p>She shivered at the thought of how cold.</p><p>Eyes wide, the breath laboring in her chest, she fought to stay in place rather than to sprint through the night.</p><p>\u201cDo you know the direction of the road out of here?\u201d he called out to her. \u201cHave you been here enough times that you\u2019ll be able to stay on the gravel rather than the rocky ground and know where you are?\u201d</p><p>She was smarter than that. She knew the difference between a graveled road and rocky ground.</p><p>Jonesy chuckled again. \u201cCome on, Rogue. At least I\u2019ll kill you quick. The night will make you suffer.\u201d</p><p>God, how could she and her father have been so wrong about him? He wasn\u2019t a friend, he was a monster.</p><p>Kneeling behind the thick, heavy hedge, Rogue felt the first tear fall. The night was cold, wet. For the briefest moment she remembered the feel of Zeke\u2019s arms, the warmth of his body. A sob lodged in her throat at the need for that warmth.</p><p>She had seen the pain in his eyes earlier when he had realized Gene had betrayed him.</p><p>Rogue felt that pain echoing inside her. In one night she had lost the man she loved, a friend, and possibly her brother.</p><p>\u201cRogue.\u201d Jonesy\u2019s hiss was filled with amusement as he drew closer to the hedge. \u201cI know this land, this farm. I know every inch of it and of this house. I wonder if I can guess where you\u2019re hiding.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened at the sound of his voice, so much nearer now. Struggling to move silently, she edged along the side of the house, careful not to brush against the hedges.</p><p>Jonesy was a hunter. Her father had told her about the hunting trips they had taken together and how Jonesy seemed to have almost a second sense of where his prey would hide, which way it would go.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t an animal, she told herself, but was there really any difference between a human and an animal that knew it was hunted?</p><p>Her heart racing out of control, the blood thundering through her veins, Rogue decided there wasn\u2019t much difference. There was an awareness of death hovering, the tingle of hope, the defiance to live. She had to live. She\u2019d be damned if she would let Jonesy hurt her family further.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t ask me how I managed to fool your father and everyone else all these years.\u201d Insidious and filled with hated confidence, Jonesy\u2019s voice threaded through the night again, closer than was comfortable.</p><p>\u201cShould I tell you?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>Yeah, keep talking, asshole, so I know exactly where you are.</p><p>His laughter was low, cruel. \u201cYour father is so grateful to me for warning him of Dayle Mackay\u2019s plans regarding your mother that he doesn\u2019t mind a bit to send me a nice fat check every Christmas. He had no idea it was all a very nicely laid plan to get him the hell out of Somerset. See, your father was a troublemaker and your mother was just too damned high profile to just kill. But it worked out, Rogue. Your father proved to be a nice little resource. Why, the law firm he\u2019s established has even defended several of our members and cleared their good names of the evil acts they committed. He\u2019s a fine man,\u201d he drawled mockingly. \u201cToo bad his daughter isn\u2019t as smart.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, too bad his daughter didn\u2019t fire you when she had the chance. Too bad she didn\u2019t just shoot you.</p><p>Rogue slid around the back of the house, her eyes straining to see past the fog as she fought to figure out which way to go, where the best place to hide would be.</p><p>\u201cI know where you are, Rogue,\u201d he sang through the night. \u201cJust around the corner, just around the bend. Searching for warmth before your life is set to end.\u201d</p><p>A poet he wasn\u2019t. But he had a point. She was just around the corner. Unfortunately, she didn\u2019t know a damned thing about Zeke\u2019s home other than the fact that the back deck should be within feet of her.</p><p>Moving carefully, fighting to stay silent, she managed to find the porch rails. Gripping the wood tightly, she climbed over the banister before hunkering down and feeling her way across the boards.</p><p>Would he expect her to be on the porch?</p><p>She followed the rails, found the opening that led back out into the yard, and paused there. Her nails dug into the wood as she listened and fought to hear above the racing of her heart. She couldn\u2019t hear Jonesy. Could he hear her? Her heart was like thunder in her ears, her breathing raspy. Fear was an acrid taste in her mouth now as her stomach clenched with panic. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The night itself whispered with dread. The breeze coming off the lake was a hiss of deadly intent. The shift of branches, the creak of the trees. Which was nature, which was a killer waiting to strike?</p><p>The fog danced slowly around her, shifting and thickening, thinning and moving through the night with hollow grace. Shadows twisted within the dense mist, came together, then drifted apart, giving her no hint to who was near and who wasn\u2019t.</p><p>How could a man of Jonesy\u2019s size move so silently? Surely she would have heard something.</p> <p>Biting her lip, she remained in place, stiff, still, waiting. Watching. Praying. If only Zeke would get to her in time.</p><p>\u201cHe has to be bat-shit crazy to think he could get away with this, Zeke.\u201d Alex sat beside him in the Tahoe as Zeke cut the lights to the truck and made the turn onto the graveled road leading to his house. \u201cHe\u2019s a hunter, a fighter. He\u2019s had military training.</p><p>Dishonorable discharge for striking an officer though his fellow officers testified that the officer struck first. If nothing else, he\u2019s a tough son of a bitch. If he has Rogue, getting her out won\u2019t be easy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRogue will be watching for me.\u201d He had to believe that. She wasn\u2019t weak; she wasn\u2019t stupid. She would know he was coming for her, no matter how angry she had been when he left.</p><p>\u201cListen to me, none of these men that were in the League are operating with a full deck here,\u201d Alex warned him as he slid ammo into the rifle he carried.</p> <p>He wore a night-vision device on his head; a handgun was strapped to his thigh.</p><p>Dressed in camo with a matching cap covering his hair, the chief of Somerset\u2019s police department looked like the Special Forces soldier he had been six months prior.</p><p>Zeke eased the Tahoe over, aware of the other men in the backseat and back cargo area.</p><p>They\u2019d loaded up after dragging on gear they\u2019d packed in their own vehicles. The Mackay boys believed in \u201cjust in case.\u201d They kept everything they needed on hand just in case something went from sugar to shit in a heartbeat.</p><p>Dawg, Natches, patched but still bleeding, Rowdy, limping but still walking, Cranston, a little worse for wear, but he was in one piece. And Gene. His deputy carried a sniper rifle similar to Alex\u2019s and his expression was as cold and forbidding as Alex knew his own was.</p><p>Shutting off the engine, he pulled his weapon from its holster, checked it, then shoved it back in place before taking the extra clips from Alex and shoving them in the large pocket of the dark camo jacket he wore.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re a quarter mile from the house,\u201d he said. \u201cNatches, Rowdy, and Cranston will take the tunnel entrance, Alex, Dawg, and Gene and I will take the two entrances to the house.\u201d He stared at Gene through the rearview mirror. \u201cYou\u2019re with me.\u201d</p><p>Gene nodded, his eyes meeting Zeke\u2019s, his expression tight with controlled anger. They were going to have to deal with each other, and with Cranston when this was over. But for now, nothing mattered but Rogue.</p><p>\u201cMaynard, give me that sniper rifle. He\u2019s had time to get here; that means one of us has to be in place to take him out at a moment\u2019s notice,\u201d Natches informed them, his voice rough, dark with the threat of violence as Gene handed him the sniper rifle.</p><p>Trusting no one, Natches began breaking it apart quickly and effectively. Within seconds he had it down, checked, and clicking everything back into place as Dawg stored ammo in the pockets of his own jacket.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s alive,\u201d Zeke stated. \u201cThat\u2019s all that matters.\u201d</p><p>He was aware of the looks the other men were giving each other.</p><p>\u201cIf she were dead, the house would be in flames.\u201d He nodded to the silent shadows ahead. There was no sign of light, no glow of a fire. \u201cJonesy wouldn\u2019t leave any evidence. He\u2019s been too careful so far; he would continue to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnless he took her out of the house,\u201d Cranston suggested.</p> <p>Zeke ignored him.</p><p>\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t take her out of the house,\u201d Gene said. \u201cJonesy would make it look like a suicide or he\u2019d set fire to the place. Dad told me once that the League had a silent exterminator. He never said who it was, but my money\u2019s on Danny Jones.\u201d</p><p>So was Zeke\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s move.\u201d</p><p>They exited the vehicle silently and moved quickly along the graveled road with the night-vision devices in place. The murky green visual displayed in front of his eyes gave Zeke a moment\u2019s pause. He rarely used night vision. But now, with the fog from the lake thickening around the mountains and hampering regular sight, Zeke thanked God for them.</p><p>With Alex, Dawg, and Gene at his back he set a fast pace toward the house. He could feel the prickling of danger now, the awareness that time was running out.</p><p>He had to get to her. God help him, he couldn\u2019t let her be hurt, or worse, taken from him forever. At that moment, nothing mattered but Rogue. Thoughts of her twisted through his head, rage and regret and blinding pain twisted and tangled together until rage bloomed from his inability to change the danger she was in.</p><p>He shouldn\u2019t have left her. He shouldn\u2019t have hurt her. He should have taken more time, explained more, made things clear. He should have assured her he was coming back for her, and that they would deal with the future then. He should have told her he loved her.</p><p>Rogue could feel the danger, it washed over her skin with an oily sensation and left her shuddering to the point that she had to lock her teeth together to keep them from chattering and giving her away.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t hear Jonesy anymore. How could a man so big move so quietly? Or was he moving? He could be doing as she was, waiting, watching.</p><p>Her muscles were cramping with her efforts to remain completely still. A tear spilled from her eyes, tickled her chin, but she refused to wipe it away.</p><p>Where was Zeke? He had to be coming. He had to be close. He wouldn\u2019t let her be hurt.</p><p>She was only going to be able to do so much to save herself here. It wasn\u2019t as though she carried a gun or had even borrowed one of his. And she sure as hell wasn\u2019t strong enough for a fight against Jonesy.</p><p>Damn him. She hoped he knew he was fired now. The bastard had burned her bar?</p><p>Blown it up? How could he blow up her bar?</p><p>Son of a bitch.</p><p>God, she was scared.</p><p>She clenched her teeth tighter and hoped she was out of sight. Of course in this fog, he could be standing beside her and she wouldn\u2019t know it.</p><p>A shudder worked over her as the dew began to seep into her thin T-shirt. The cool moisture became freezing after a while, and she didn\u2019t like the cold.</p><p>She wanted to be in Zeke\u2019s arms. She wanted him to hold her, wanted to be warm again against his naked flesh. She wanted a chance to kick him for using her.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t believe he had played her so easily. Rogue wasn\u2019t easy to play. At least, she hadn\u2019t thought she was.</p><p>She bit her lip as she heard a shuffle of sound. Was it wind or was it death coming closer? She was dead if Jonesy found her, and she knew it.</p><p>Another shift, it could be the breeze or the sound of a footfall against the grass.</p><p>She fought the need to run, to scream.</p><p>\u201cBitch! There you are!\u201d</p><p>She screamed as cruel fingers gripped her hair and jerked her up, then over the railing.</p><p>She slammed to the ground, her hands jerking to her head, nails digging into his flesh as he cursed.</p><p>\u201cYou sorry whore!\u201d</p><p>Agony screeched through her nervous system as he jerked her up by her hair. A hard fist glanced the side of her head, momentarily rattling her before she could kick back with the heels of her boots.</p><p>Wiggling, scratching, she fought to be free as he jerked her around by the hair, his other hand moving.</p><p>The gun. He had a gun.</p><p>Her screams pierced the night as she released his arm to grip the one she knew held the gun. He shook her as her hands reached for him, causing her to fall against him. The feel of the gun at his waist had her reaching desperately for it.</p><p>His hands knocked hers aside as she felt it, as it was almost in her grasp. The blow numbed her wrists as she felt the weapon knock to the ground.</p><p>\u201cYou fucking bitch!\u201d he yelled into the night, his fist cracking against her cheek as she struggled in his grip.</p><p>Stars exploded in front of her eyes as an edge of darkness began to seep through her mind. Rogue felt herself wavering, knees weakening as she began to fall.</p><p>He shook her and she barely felt the pain in her head until her knees collapsed and the force of her weight threatened to tear her hair from the roots.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s the fucking gun, bitch?\u201d he screamed in her ear. \u201cI\u2019m going to beat the fucking hell out of you before I put a bullet between your eyes.\u201d</p><p>It was dark, so dark. Rogue felt herself falling, felt the strength leaving her limbs.</p><p>Suddenly she was free. She went to the ground with enough force to bruise her knees.</p><p>The moment of freedom seemed to pump the strength back into her. Not a lot, just enough to scramble away before turning on her back and kicking out.</p><p>She caught him in the knees with the sharp tips of her heels, slamming them into his kneecaps and feeling a surge of triumph at his squall of pain as he stumbled backward.</p><p>Turning, she fought to crawl quickly from him. Her nails tore against the hard-packed dirt. Her hair fell over her face, blinding her further.</p><p>It was already so dark she didn\u2019t worry about the hair. The curls tangled around her arms, her face; rocks dug into her knees and palms.</p><p>She had to be close to escape. Close enough to get to her feet and run. She paused only long enough to try to jump to her feet. As her toes dug into the ground, harsh hands wrapped around her ankles and jerked her back.</p><p>The rending of fabric where her jeans ripped at the knees infuriated her. Why that would piss her off she didn\u2019t know, but a growl clawed from her throat as she tried to kick out at him again.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to be nice about this.\u201d His voice was demented, monstrous. \u201cI would have been nice.\u201d</p><p>The gun was in her face.</p><p>Rogue stilled. She felt the barrel pressing into her cheek, looked up, and through the fog saw the demon wielding it.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a nice way to murder someone?\u201d she cried out. \u201cIs that what you told Joe and Jaime, that you\u2019d be nice? Is that what you told their grandmother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he sneered. \u201cI told them to burn in hell. And that\u2019s where you\u2019ll burn, too.\u201d</p><p>His finger tightened on the trigger.</p><p>Rogue\u2019s scream pierced the night, spurring Zeke through the night as he raced to find her. The night-vision device he wore painted the world in a hazy green, but it was a clear picture of where he was going.</p><p>The house was just ahead of them. Gene was at his back, Alex off to his left, while Dawg took the right.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t seem to run fast enough, he couldn\u2019t get enough speed to his legs; adrenaline wasn\u2019t coursing fast enough through his body.</p><p>Desperation filled his mind as pain seemed to sear his soul. He was too late. He was going to be too late to save her. He was going to lose her. The only woman who had ever touched his heart, and he was going to lose her if he didn\u2019t hurry.</p><p>Her screams were digging into his head now. Piercing, filled with fury and pain. As he reached the house he jerked his gun from its holster, gripped it with both hands, and tore around the side of the house.</p><p>God, he had to run faster.</p><p>It seemed to take forever to reach the corner of the house and move around to the back deck. The fog was so damned thick he didn\u2019t know how Jonesy had navigated through it. But Zeke could see. He could see everything in slow motion. The gun in her face; Jonesy\u2019s finger tightening on the trigger.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d he screamed out in fury as he lifted his gun, then watched as Jonesy jerked at the same moment and the back of his head exploded out into the night.</p><p>Zeke didn\u2019t pause to think, he didn\u2019t give himself time to worry about shooters that might not be friendly. As Jonesy toppled over Rogue\u2019s fallen form, he jerked the other man off, threw him back to the ground, and lifted Rogue into his arms. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Keeping his body hunched he raced up the deck steps, threw his shoulder into the door of the house, felt the locks give, and fell inside the house with her. His body covered hers as he rolled her across the floor, forced to ignore her cries until he could get her safely on the other side of the room, behind the couch.</p><p>\u201cRogue. Baby.\u201d Propping her against the couch he let his hands race over, his gaze searching her body for wounds or broken bones. \u201cRogue, talk to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSon of a bitch,\u201d she gasped, her bruised face swelling, her violet eyes filled with rage.</p> <p>Zeke watched her in shock until her hand cracked against his face. The stinging slap wasn\u2019t gentle. It slammed into his cheek with enough force that he knew he\u2019d be carrying the imprint of her hand for hours. In the next second, his ever-strong, impossibly stubborn Rogue collapsed into his arms in tears.</p><p>\u201cI have you, baby.\u201d He buried his head in her hair, a shudder working through his body at how close she had come to dying. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, baby. I have you.\u201d</p><p>Rogue never cried. She wasn\u2019t a whiner. She didn\u2019t complain. She was sobbing in his arms, holding on to him with desperate hands and trying to burrow into his chest.</p><p>And God help him, he didn\u2019t blame her. Tightening his arms around her, he held her to him, rocked her, and closed his eyes as he fought the overload of fear and remorse that struck his system.</p><p>He shouldn\u2019t have left her. He should have never left her, believing she would be safe.</p> <p>He should have considered Jonesy, but instead he had relied on the loyalty the other man had always appeared to show her. Zeke knew he should have known better. It was his mistake, and it was one Rogue had nearly paid for.</p><p>\u201cDamn, he\u2019s in trouble,\u201d Rowdy\u2019s low voice whispered across the room in a tone of amazement and male concern. \u201cI\u2019ve never heard of her crying. I bet she cuts his dick off for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up, Rowdy,\u201d Dawg growled.</p><p>\u201cYeah, shut up, Rowdy.\u201d From Cranston, his voice low and filled with regret.</p><p>Zeke lifted his head and stared back at the agent.</p><p>\u201cI have to take you in, Zeke.\u201d He sighed. \u201cThis has to be wrapped up.\u201d</p> <p>His arms contracted around Rogue. God, he\u2019d known it was coming. He\u2019d known all along that the sins of the past could never be buried or even forgotten by the DHS agent that knew the truth.</p><p>\u201cGod, Cranston, give him a day or two at least,\u201d Rowdy protested. \u201cYou mean-hearted, slimy bastard. Someone\u2019s going to end up killing you.\u201d</p><p>Zeke heard sirens wailing in the distance then. Reinforcements that would have been too late if Natches hadn\u2019t managed to get in place with that sniper rifle. Zeke knew it had to have been Natches, because he was the only one missing at the moment.</p><p>\u201cZeke knew our deal,\u201d Cranston stated. \u201cWe need the information, those pictures, and his testimony. This wraps it up, boys. The pictures he sent earlier had faces of men we don\u2019t have in custody, and he remembers them. This fucking group is gone. It\u2019s damned history and I\u2019ll do whatever it takes to wrap it up for good.\u201d Because this group had destroyed his family, had killed his wife, his daughter, and his grandchild. Because destroying them was all Cranston knew and he would stop at nothing to see it finished.</p><p>It finished here, just as he said.</p><p>\u201cNo matter who you have to destroy?\u201d Rowdy asked.</p><p>\u201cNo matter who\u2019s destroyed,\u201d Cranston affirmed. \u201cNo matter what it takes.\u201d</p><p>Zeke held Rogue closer, already feeling the chill inside his soul because he knew he would have to let her go, walk away again, and walking away would destroy him more than the truth of his past ever could.</p> <p>Pressing his lips to her ear he whispered. \u201cYou fill me. Remember that, Rogue. For the first time in my life, I knew what love was supposed to be.\u201d</p><p>Her head shook against his chest as another sob tore from her throat. Her arms were like silken bands of steel around his neck, and God knew he didn\u2019t know if he had the strength to force her to release him.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t use you.\u201d He kissed the top of her head, her forehead. \u201cI was helpless against you. Know that, Caitlyn Rogue. I couldn\u2019t have walked away for anything. Even my own life.\u201d</p><p>TWENTY-FOUR</p><p>But he did walk away.</p><p>A week later Rogue stood in the parking lot of what had once been the Bar and stared at the debris with a sense of . . . relief.</p><p>She\u2019d lost everything she owned except the Harley, but she was thankful she had a reason to walk away from it now. An era had come to an end. The Bar was gone, the dangerous Dayle Mackay and his rabid revolutionists were gone. Jonesy was gone.</p><p>She shoved her hands into the pockets of her pants and let her gaze wander over the blackened remains of lumber where the walls had toppled in.</p><p>\u201cSo what now?\u201d Her father\u2019s arm went around her shoulders as his tall, sturdy body gave her a place to lean.</p><p>She shrugged at his question. \u201cI bought out Natches Mackay. I guess I\u2019m part owner in a restaurant now.\u201d</p><p>Her father gave a heavy sigh as she looked up into the strong features of his still-handsome face.</p><p>\u201cI want you to come home,\u201d he told her as her mother, Brianna Walker, moved to her other side. \u201cDamned house is too quiet. With your sister married and gone, and damned John won\u2019t even stay the night. The nest is too empty.\u201d</p><p>She grinned at that. \u201cSorry, Dad. This is home.\u201d</p><p>Somerset was home. Lake Cumberland was home.</p><p>All she had left to do was to get over one arrogant, too-sexy sheriff and her life would even out. One day she might even sleep through the night without crying.</p><p>\u201cWhat about Zeke?\u201d her mother asked as though reading her thoughts. \u201cHe called again last night.\u201d</p><p>He had called every night for the past three nights. She refused to answer the phone; she refused to talk to him. He was back on the job now, the crime that had been committed when he was a child had never been mentioned, and for that, she was glad.</p><p>His father had betrayed him, tried to destroy him and his future. No man should have to pay for that.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about Zeke.\u201d She didn\u2019t want to cry again. The pain was like a festering wound inside her soul that refused to heal.</p><p>He had used her. He may not have suspected Jonesy of being the killer he was seeking, but he hadn\u2019t been honest with her, either. He hadn\u2019t told her he was fucking her so the killer would believe he was distracted by her and not giving his attention to tracking him. He hadn\u2019t told her that the only reason he had come to her bed was to further the goal of capturing that killer.</p><p>I was helpless against you. Know that, Caitlyn Rogue. I couldn\u2019t have walked away for anything. Even my own life.</p><p>He had whispered those words before he had left with Cranston. But he had still left. He had walked away from her without a backward glance to help Cranston round up the final straggling members of the organization he had fought to bring down.</p><p>James Maynard had been arrested, though he was now free on bond due to his cooperation with the Department of Homeland Security and the Justice Department.</p><p>Gene Maynard, she had learned, had been helping DHS all along.</p><p>There had been other arrests in Louisville as well as Frankfort, and according to Alex Jansen, the Freedom League was now nothing more than a very bad memory.</p><p>\u201cJust come home for a while,\u201d her father tried again. \u201cA month.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head again as a smile touched her lips. He kept trying; she had to give him credit for that.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ready to go back to the apartment now, Daddy. It should be repaired enough,\u201d she told him as she turned into his embrace and hugged him quickly. \u201cJust take me home now.\u201d</p><p>There was a small moment of silence. Her parents were sharing that look, she thought.</p><p>The one they shared whenever they didn\u2019t know what to do with the children they had raised.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d Her father finally sighed heavily. \u201cBut if you\u2019re not coming home, then I\u2019m hanging around awhile. Dawg Mackay offered us the use of his houseboat now that\u2019s he\u2019s moved into the house he built. I think we\u2019ll take him up on that.\u201d</p><p>She almost winced. God, would Lake Cumberland survive her parents? Even for a few days? Surely they wouldn\u2019t stay any longer than that.</p><p>\u201cYou should go home, Daddy,\u201d she began to argue the decision.</p><p>\u201cCaitlyn, your father said we\u2019re staying. The decision has been made.\u201d She was using her best \u201cmommy\u201d voice. The one that all three of her strong-willed children understood clearly. That was the final word. Period.</p><p>\u201cFine, but you know he\u2019s just going to cause trouble while he\u2019s here,\u201d she informed her mother as they made their way back to the limo they had ridden in from the airport in Louisville. \u201cHe\u2019s a trouble magnet, Mom. Him and John. John\u2019s already causing trouble and he hasn\u2019t been here two weeks yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m certain we\u2019ll all survive,\u201d her mother stated. \u201cWe\u2019ll take you home, then go check out Mr. Mackay\u2019s houseboat. It looked simply charming when we drove around the docks earlier. Did you know your father used to have a boat on the lake as well? When he was much younger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Rogue looked at her askance. \u201cAnd I\u2019m sure I don\u2019t want to know about it, either.</p><p>Don\u2019t gross me out with your tales of dating Daddy. Please.\u201d</p><p>Her mother laughed as they sat back in the limo and the vehicle pulled away.</p><p>Rogue gazed back at the charred remains of the Bar and wondered about this turn in her life. She was twenty-six years old, and she had just lost the only man she could have ever imagined loving. The knowledge that he had walked away from her that night, claiming to have used her, pushing her back to be protected like a little china doll while he went off to fight the bad guys, still had the power to hurt.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t that he had left her there. He had believed she would be safe, she could forgive him for that. No, she was angry, she was hurt, because he hadn\u2019t left with so much as a</p><p>\u201csee you later.\u201d She could have died believing he had felt nothing for her.</p><p>It was the betrayal that hurt. When he needed her he hadn\u2019t wanted to accept that she would be there for him. He hadn\u2019t told her the full details of what he was doing and why he was doing it. He hadn\u2019t shared his feelings for her. He had just left her there. He could have died, been arrested for whatever, and gone from her life, and she wouldn\u2019t have known she was any more important to him than the grass under his feet.</p><p>Because he had lied to her. He had let her think he was simply using her, when she had known, known to the bottom of her soul that he cared.</p><p>\u201cRogue?\u201d her mother spoke her name softly. \u201cWhen you\u2019re young it\u2019s very easy to let pride get in the way of what\u2019s most important in your life. Don\u2019t make that mistake.\u201d</p><p>She turned away from her mother\u2019s compassionate gaze and swallowed tightly. Was it just pride?</p><p>\u201cHe lied to me,\u201d she whispered. \u201cHe left me, denying he cared anything for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if he hadn\u2019t come back?\u201d her father asked. \u201cIf he\u2019d died, Rogue? He was looking out for you.\u201d</p><p>She fought the tears that would have fallen. \u201cHe just left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd perhaps he had no other choice,\u201d her mother said gently as the limo turned into Somerset and headed for the old town center where her new apartment was located.</p><p>\u201cMen aren\u2019t always as logical as they think they are. Sometimes, Rogue, it\u2019s up to the women who love them to point that out to them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd sometimes it takes a good swift kick,\u201d her father drawled in amusement. \u201cYour mother has delivered a few of those over the years.\u201d</p><p>She stared out the window, her throat tight with unshed tears as she fought the pain that never seemed to ease, the chill that she swore went clear to her soul. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>God, she missed Zeke. She ached for him.</p><p>\u201cRogue.\u201d Her mother touched her arm gently as the limo pulled into the back lot of the restaurant. \u201cPerhaps you should just talk to him.\u201d</p><p>She saw the Tahoe then, the sheriff\u2019s emblem emblazed on the door as it opened and Zeke stepped out.</p> <p>He was dressed in jeans again, that damned badge hanging on his belt. He wore boots and a gray cotton shirt. The sun blazed around him, making his eyes appear more golden, his expression more imposing as the car drew to a stop.</p><p>\u201cJust talk to him, Rogue,\u201d her father suggested gently then. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t hurt to talk.\u201d</p><p>The chauffeur opened the door and she stepped out slowly, aware of the door closing behind her and seconds later the vehicle pulling away.</p><p>Zeke leaned against the front of the Tahoe, his arms crossing over his chest, his expression imposing.</p><p>\u201cTook you long enough,\u201d he growled, his voice dark, deep. His face was almost haggard. He looked as bad as she felt, as though the world had crashed in upon him as well.</p> <p>She pulled her keys from her pocket, turned, and moved for the steps of the apartment.</p><p>Was he following her? She could feel him behind her, watching her. She felt like a rabbit beneath the regard of a hungry wolf.</p><p>She saw him as she turned up the steps. He was behind her. Far enough away that she could tell he was deliberately keeping distance between them.</p><p>\u201cIs the investigation over?\u201d she asked as she shoved the key into the door and stepped inside.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s over. They rounded the final members up the night after Jonesy was killed. They have all the evidence they need to lock them up for a damned long time.\u201d</p><p>Rogue nodded. \u201cFrom what I\u2019ve been hearing they didn\u2019t have much of a chance for success anyway. A bunch of crazy old men looking for a war.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat about sums it up.\u201d His voice was clipped, cool as he stepped into the apartment behind her and closed the door. \u201cBut these crazy old coots were smarter than you\u2019d think. And more dangerous.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. Yeah, she\u2019d heard that, too. They\u2019d killed a lot of good men and women and been responsible for even more deaths over the past thirty years.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s Gene doing?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Zeke blew out a hard breath. \u201cIt\u2019s been hard on him. He didn\u2019t even know Cammi was seeing the Walker boys. It shook him up, realizing she was hiding it from him. Makes sense why she ran off to her sisters after they were killed though. She was devastated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe loved them?\u201d Rogue turned and stared at him from where she stood in the living room.</p><p>\u201cShe cared a hell of a lot anyway.\u201d He shook his head, his expression heavy. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t aware anyone was looking for her. She thought Joe had killed Jaime and then himself, because of her. Gene\u2019s taking care of her though. That\u2019s the important part.\u201d</p><p>That was the important part, Rogue agreed. Like her father had tried to take care of her, and she had refused to allow it. Her family had gathered around her, giving advice, offering their support, and nothing helped the pain; no one could ease it.</p><p>She stared back at Zeke now and swallowed at the lump of pain in her throat. It had been so long since she had felt his arms around her. So many nights she had cried into her pillow, aching, hurting.</p> <p>\u201cDo you hate me, Rogue?\u201d he asked then, standing before her, tall and so very arrogant, as though he were daring her to strike out at him. As though he expected it.</p><p>\u201cWould you hate me?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>She had wondered over the past week if she was right or wrong in how she felt. Should she punish him, or should she simply love him?</p><p>He grimaced heavily. \u201cI\u2019d paddle your damned ass if you pulled something like that on me,\u201d he finally admitted. \u201cBut son of a bitch if I would let you go, Rogue. There wouldn\u2019t have been a night that I wasn\u2019t trying to get into your bed anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t paddle your ass,\u201d she said, her voice thickening with the emotion clogging it.</p><p>\u201cWhat am I supposed to do, Zeke, wait until the next time you\u2019re worried for me, scared I\u2019ll be hurt, and you do it again? How do I know when you\u2019re committed to me rather than your fears of losing someone?\u201d</p><p>His jaw clenched furiously. \u201cYou sound like Shane now. He hasn\u2019t spoken to me since he found out what had been going on the past ten years. He\u2019s pouting in Louisville like a child because I didn\u2019t tell him before he left on that trip what was going on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you could have died while he was gone,\u201d she snapped. \u201cBecause he loves you, Zeke. How do you think it makes us feel? To know you\u2019d push us away so damned easily?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat I\u2019d protect you?\u201d he growled back. \u201cI\u2019d hope you\u2019d understand how important you are to me. God, Rogue, do you think I wanted to die knowing if I had told you how I felt that you would have grieved worse? Or if I was arrested and charged for a murder I committed as a child, do you think I wanted you to hold on to me when I didn\u2019t have a future to give you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s acceptable?\u201d she cried. \u201cFine, Zeke, let\u2019s turn the table. Would you accept it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck no!\u201d he yelled back. \u201cYou\u2019re mine, damn you. No matter what.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy God, listen to you.\u201d She was in his face, almost nose to nose, anger beating a ragged tattoo in her veins. \u201cListen to how arrogant you are! Why should I accept it?</p><p>Why shouldn\u2019t you belong to me, too, Zeke? Do you think for one damned minute I\u2019ll only take you when you\u2019re safe? God, what is that, a weekend out of the fucking year?\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed. \u201cYou\u2019ll take me, period, every damned day of the year,\u201d he snarled back. \u201cFine, I was a fucking fool. I was stupid. I was a dumb- fuck hick that loved his woman enough to want to protect her. So shoot me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me the gun.\u201d Hands on hips, arousal and anger firing in her blood, she yelled the words back at him.</p><p>It flooded her now. The long nights without him, the anger that he would stay away from her without telling her he loved her. That he would wait until she was angry, until she wanted to kick him, before admitting it.</p><p>\u201cYou little hellion.\u201d Amazement darkened his gaze and filled his face. \u201cYou stubborn little witch. You won\u2019t even say you love me, will you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy should I?\u201d A pout formed on her lips as she whirled away from him. \u201cWhy should I tell you anything?\u201d</p><p>If she thought he was going to let her get away that easily, she was wrong. She had hoped she was wrong. Prayed she was.</p><p>Before she could take the first step he wrapped an arm around her waist, picked her up, then strode through the apartment. Straight to her bedroom and to the bed.</p><p>\u201cYou will say it,\u201d he promised her, his voice filled with arousal and demand now.</p><p>\u201cBefore you get out of this bed, I promise you, you\u2019ll say it.\u201d</p><p>Rogue swiped the hair from her face, leaned up on her elbows, and watched him undress. He tore at his clothes. Buttons ripped from his shirt, his boots were tossed to the floor, his jeans, underwear, and shocks taken off in one swipe. When he stood before her, all dark flesh and raging arousal, Rogue swore she lost her breath.</p><p>His cock was furiously engorged, the wide crest flushed dark and throbbing as his fingers circled the thick shaft and pumped it with several slow, erotic strokes.</p><p>\u201cUndress,\u201d he ordered, his voice rough, his eyes dark.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re getting awful bossy,\u201d she murmured, though she rose from the bed as she watched him carefully.</p><p>She didn\u2019t just tear her clothes off. She bent her knee and pulled off first one shoe, then the other and let them drop to the floor. Next, with slow, exacting movements her hands gripped the hem of her light sweater and she pulled it over her head, finally shaking her hair free as his groan whispered to her.</p><p>His expression was intent now, his face flushed. Golden brown eyes seemed darker, more predatory as her fingers went to the snap of her jeans.</p><p>The metal closure came free easily, the zipper rasped open, and seconds later she was pushing the denim from her legs and standing before him in nothing but the wicked black lace of her thong and bra. As he watched, her hands lifted and she cupped the swollen mounds of her breasts before flicking open the plastic clip of the bra.</p><p>\u201cGod, I\u2019ll have a stroke before you get those panties off,\u201d he groaned hoarsely. \u201cCould you try to hurry, baby? Control isn\u2019t something I have a lot of right now.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. Let him suffer then. He deserved to suffer for what he\u2019d done to her. Just a little bit.</p><p>\u201cI should worry about your control?\u201d she asked, her voice soft, deliberately sensual.</p><p>\u201cReally, Zeke. I\u2019ve suffered a week now. Where have you been?\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t even talk to me when I called, Rogue.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cMaybe I didn\u2019t want a phone between us, Zeke. Maybe I wantedyou .</p><p>Andyou weren\u2019t here.\u201d</p><p>She shivered as she let her fingertips trail down her stomach and imagined the touch of his fingers against her. Calloused, rough, warm.</p><p>\u201cYou are treading a very thin line, sweetheart,\u201d he rasped.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to handcuff me, Sheriff?\u201d Her fingers dipped beneath the elastic of her thong, her breath catching as her fingertips grazed her clit.</p><p>The look on his face was sexy as hell. Dark and primal. She wondered how long it would take him to break that incredible control of his.</p><p>\u201cDamn, you\u2019re gorgeous,\u201d he breathed out as she trailed her fingers back to her breasts and whispered a touch over her nipples.</p><p>\u201cAm I really?\u201d She smiled back at him. \u201cI\u2019m a little short.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what they make those damned high heels for,\u201d he breathed roughly. \u201cRogue, sweetheart, we\u2019re reaching critical here.\u201d His hand tightened on his cock. \u201cTake the panties off, baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou take them off.\u201d</p><p>It was a dare. It was a challenge. And she should have known better. She would have if it hadn\u2019t produced exactly the reaction she wanted.</p><p>He was across the distance in two short steps. His fingers curled under the band of the thong and pulled. The material ripped away from her with a hiss of a sound. One arm went around her back and he lifted her, dragging one leg over his hip as he turned to the bed.</p><p>The heavy crest of his cock was poised at the entrance to her pussy, pressing against her as he laid her back along the bed, spread her legs wide, and lowered his gaze to watch.</p><p>It was so damned sexy it should be illegal. Rogue watched, too. Watched as the bare folds of her sex parted and the blunt, dark head of his erection began to press inside her.</p><p>Heat seared her from the inside out. Pleasure whipped through her body, centered at the point of penetration, and then sizzled over her flesh. Her clit throbbed, and she swore if he didn\u2019t hurry she was going to orgasm before he was even seated fully inside her.</p><p>She was desperate, on fire. Her hand pushed down her abdomen again and her fingers found the straining nub of her clit as Zeke jerked against her.</p><p>\u201cGod, that\u2019s fucking sexy,\u201d he groaned as she touched herself.</p><p>His hips shifted and a cry left her lips as he sank deeper inside her. The erotic stretching was sheer bliss. The little bite of a burn, the stroke of rapture. Rogue\u2019s back arched with the sensations, her head dug into the mattress.</p><p>\u201cThere, baby,\u201d he breathed out, his voice rough, the muscles in his abdomen flexing as she watched him pull back. \u201cAh God. You\u2019re so sweet. So tight and hot.\u201d</p><p>Her finger raced over her clit as he began to move inside her. Deep, heavy thrusts that had her hips writhing as she masturbated to the swift tempo he was creating.</p><p>It was exquisite, heated. Bliss.</p><p>\u201cMore,\u201d she begged, watching as his cock pulled free, glistened with her juices, then shoved inside again with a hard, hungry stroke. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Rogue could feel the sensations gathering inside her, the tight knot of heat in her womb, the throb of her clit, the racing of her blood, and the ache in her nipples. They were growing, signaling the approach of her orgasm as she tried to push that steady ascension faster. She wanted it now. She wanted to explode in his arms, wanted to scream his name.</p><p>It was more than just the pleasure, more than just her approaching orgasm. Zeke was here in her arms, in her bed. She stared up at him, memorizing the arousal-heavy planes and angles of his face, the perspiration building on his corded, muscular shoulders.</p><p>Arching in his arms, she felt the warning thunder in her veins, the burst of almost violent sensation as his hips twisted against her, thrusting heavily, stroking, building the pleasure inside her, and she wondered if she could survive. If she\u2019d live through the cataclysm racing for her.</p><p>She saw it as it exploded. Blinding lights, the pulse and throb of her vagina around the heavy thrusts inside it. The stretching burn, the need, the desire, and finally the blinding, soul- shattering explosion that had her screaming his name, twisting in his arms, and melting in completion.</p><p>\u201cZeke. Oh God, Zeke. I love you. I love you.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t leave her again. She couldn\u2019t bear it. She couldn\u2019t stand to see him walk away, to see him face danger alone, not knowing she loved him, not knowing that when he came back, she would be there. No matter what.</p><p>Her hands jerked to his face, clasped it as he jerked above her in his own release. Their eyes met, melded.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d she cried huskily. \u201cDon\u2019t you know, Zeke? Whether you loved me or not, I\u2019d die for you.\u201d</p><p>His golden brown eyes flared with heat. His expression twisted in pain, in remorse.</p><p>\u201cI love you until I can\u2019t breathe for needing you.\u201d His voice was jerky, panting. \u201cGod, Rogue. I live for you.\u201d</p><p>He shuddered against her; the feel of his release spilling inside her, the press of his body against her, it was completion. It was where she was meant to be.</p><p>This was the dream. It went past the little deceptions he had played upon her, it went past the anger and the hurt pride. It overrode their fears. Here. In Zeke\u2019s arms, Caitlyn Rogue found a home.</p><p>EPILOGUE</p><p>One year later</p><p>It was the party of the year as far as the MackayMarina and its inhabitants were concerned as the owners of the marina hosted the reception for the Pulaski County sheriff that finally tied the knot with the rogue that stole his heart.</p><p>The bride was exquisite in an off-white medieval gown. The groom was debonair in his black tux. The best man, Somerset\u2019s chief of police, Alex Jansen, stood with the matron of honor, his wife, Janey Mackay Jansen.</p><p>The tables that had been set up beneath the canopy erected just for the event were filled.</p><p>But the main attraction, even for the bride and groom, were the three exquisite Mackay daughters that had been born to the Mackay cousins in the past year.</p><p>All girls. Their daddies held them close and glared at the guests who laughed, because they couldn\u2019t believe the notorious Mackay cousins had all gotten payback quite so good.</p><p>\u201cYeah, those girls are going to be wilder than the wind,\u201d one guest remarked. \u201cCan\u2019t you just see Natches at fifty, hobbling on his cane to keep up with that girl of his?\u201d</p><p>His daughter, with a head full of thick black hair tipped with gold and curious green eyes, stared up at her daddy with a spark of mischief already.</p><p>\u201cWhat about that Dawg,\u201d another guest ventured. \u201cA daughter. Oh man. I can\u2019t wait to see the shenanigans those girls get into.\u201d</p> <p>Dawg growled.</p><p>\u201cBet me ole Rowdy\u2019s girl ain\u2019t the wildest,\u201d another guest dared. \u201cHe was always the quiet one of the bunch. You know he was the ringleader.\u201d</p><p>The guests laughed, looked at three perfect little girls with black hair and green eyes, and felt a smidgen of compassion for the former bad boys of the county.</p><p>Three Mackay girls. Cousins. Gorgeous and already confident of their place in the world.</p><p>Yeah, give it another twenty years and the Mackays would be the talk of the town again.</p><p>The Mackays, and the friends that backed them. The Nauti Boys would one day become the Nauti Girls. </p> </body></html>"]
