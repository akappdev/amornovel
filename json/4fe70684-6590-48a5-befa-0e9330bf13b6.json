Lounging on a sofa behind the alpha, Nicky looked gorgeous as usual in the morning sunlight streaming in the windows. His golden hair, streaked with silver highlights, was tousled and messy, probably from a recent romp in bed with Marco, his blood mate. Nicky was lying on his back, wearing only a tight pair of leather pants, with his bare feet up on the back of the sofa, pretending to read a magazine, but shamelessly eavesdropping on their conversation.</p><p>\u201cSo you think you can handle this, Rory? You\u2019re still pretty young. Training these rogue wolves to help them assimilate into our pack is a big job, not to mention getting them ready for possible battle. The Hunters are on the move again. They\u2019ve been seen within a hundred miles of us, probably heading right for us. I\u2019m assigning Ian to start training the wolves and I\u2019m laying in a supply of weapons and ammunition. You\u2019ll help to make sure everything runs smoothly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know I can do it, Marco. Give me a chance and you won\u2019t be sorry.\u201d</p> <p>Nicky made a scoffing noise behind his magazine, and Rory clenched his fists. \u201cYou got something to say, Nicky, just come out and say it.\u201d Nicky lowered the magazine, and his beautiful blue gaze raked Rory up and down. \u201cI never said a word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but you made a noise, and I can see the doubt written all over that smart-aleck face of yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRory,\u201d the alpha said quietly. \u201cDon\u2019t insult my pet, and Nicky, stop baiting him.\u201d</p><p>Nicky and Rory glared at each other. Nicky made another little sound and raised the magazine back in front of his face. The two had a long-standing love/hate relationship. Rory had changed Nicky to werekin to save his life after muggers had slit his throat. He\u2019d been careful, though, not to give him a mating bite, knowing he was Marco\u2019s designated bloodmate. Rory had also fed Nicky his wolf blood after Nicky turned into a feral, monstrous werewolf and Marco had given Nicky all he could without endangering his own life. Both events had formed a bond between them. They were close like brothers, but, like a slightly older brother, Nicky loved to tease and bait Rory whenever he got the chance.</p><p>Marco smiled indulgently at his mate. Everyone knew he spoiled Nicky shamefully. It was even rumored Nicky had only received one or two spankings the whole time he\u2019d been Marco\u2019s pet, and afterward Marco had taken him to bed and made love to him for hours. If Nicky had been Rory\u2019s pet, he\u2019d have spanked him daily, whether he needed it or not.</p> <p>\u201cI think you\u2019ll do a great job with the rogues, Rory. Only a few of them are older than you, and I\u2019ve only noticed one or two who seem a bit dominant. You\u2019ll have to show them who\u2019s boss right away and not let up on them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat should be easy enough for you, Rory,\u201d Nicky said sarcastically from behind his magazine. \u201cThe only problem you might have is if they try to outwit you, unarmed as you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust let me swat his backside one time, Marco, please,\u201d Rory said, shooting Nicky a menacing look.</p><p>Nicky jumped to his feet and threw down the magazine, striking a fighting pose. \u201cBring it on, Rory, if you think you can do it!\u201d</p><p>Marco intervened. \u201cThat backside is my property, and I\u2019ll give it a smack myself if I hear one more word.\u201d</p><p>Marco hooked an arm around Nicky\u2019s waist and pulled him down in his lap, wrapped both arms around him and gave him a little shake. Rory suspected his threat was an idle one.</p> <p>\u201cSettle down, baby,\u201d he purred, and Nicky laid his head on Marco\u2019s shoulder, giving Rory a self-satisfied little smirk, making Rory\u2019s hands itch to spank his butt.</p><p>\u201cYou can meet with them in the morning then, Rory, and get them started first by helping with building. With the rogue pack joining us, we need more room. We need the addition finished asap, so we can concentrate on training with weapons. Ian will be there to supervise the actual construction, so all your new gammas have to do is general clean-up of the site, carrying wood, or roofing, that kind of thing. Helping out, basically. Just a few days and then they can go out to train in the field.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem. Thanks again, Marco, for the assignment. I\u2019ll let you know how things go tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Rory turned and walked to the door, letting himself out quietly. Marco already had Nicky laid back across his arm, kissing his lips, his hands busy roaming all over him. They\u2019d be making love again in a minute, and that was one image he didn\u2019t need seared in his brain.</p><p>Nicky was beautiful, probably the most beautiful young man he\u2019d ever seen, but Rory liked girls. A petite but curvy brunette, with dark eyes would be his ideal woman. Someone like the girl who worked in the beauty shop, Tara, who was Cody\u2019s mate. She was a pretty, sweet little thing, very quiet and ladylike. Not a mean brat, like Nicky. It wasn\u2019t that Nicky was male. A magical, supernatural element in their blood picked their mates, and a wolf knew them immediately when he met them whether they were the same sex or not. Once recognition happened, there was no use in fighting it. Attempting to avoid the inevitable with denial made everyone miserable. The magic was strong. A wolf\u2019s blood sang for only one mate, and that person was his mate for life.</p><p>No, Rory just liked the way girls looked, smelled, and felt. They were all so smooth and smelled so good. He just knew in his heart his blood mate would be a cute girl, and he couldn\u2019t wait to meet her. Like Nicky and Tara, she\u2019d probably have to be an adopted human. He knew all the pet girls of the pack, and none of them were his blood mate. Wolves only mated with pets, either werekin who didn\u2019t inherit the wolf gene from their wolf parent or a bloodmate human turned werekin. Soon he\u2019d have to take a trip to some of the local towns in the valley and see if he could find her. Still pretty young, with his whole life ahead of him, he was in no real hurry.</p><p>This was an important job Marco had given him, and he took it seriously. The Hunters were an ancient group, well over a hundred years old, dating from the early nineteen hundreds. Their founder was a self-styled monster hunter named Abraham Van Helsing. Even after Van Helsing\u2019s death, the group of hunters he\u2019d established continued his mission, coming to be known simply as the Hunters. They\u2019d been waging a war against the werekin ever since. They\u2019d been quiet for over two years, but intelligence reports from various wolf clans around the country had them preparing themselves for more fighting. The Dark Hollow Pack had to be ready to defend itself.</p><p>Rory had called a meeting of his new crew in the main hall. He walked toward it, anxiety fluttering in his belly. He was always a little nervous when he met new wolves. Small for his age, he\u2019d pretty much stopped growing and filling out when he was about fifteen. Marco assured him he\u2019d hit another growth spurt, but so far it hadn\u2019t happened. Most wolves his age were already quite large, well over six feet and muscular, while Rory was leaner and not nearly as tall. The ten new gammas all came from the rogues who had just rejoined the family. For Marco to pick Rory to train them in pack discipline was quite an honor and meant Rory was moving up in pack hierarchy. To be the lead gamma had been his goal for as long as he could remember. Or rather, it had been Marco\u2019s goal for him, and he hated to let him down.</p> <p>He\u2019d walked no more than two feet into the main hall when he was assailed by a mouthwatering scent, delicious, and like nothing he\u2019d ever smelled before. A little like cotton candy, the scent drew him in like a beacon, and he tried to figure out where it was coming from. He quickly scanned the room, but only gammas stood gathered around the fireplace.</p><p>Rory shook his head, trying to clear it. His mind screamed, \u201cMate,\u201d and his cock stood up, paying close attention. Exciting and puzzling at the same time, he couldn\u2019t see anyone in the room as a potential mate. Yet the smell was almost overpowering. Rory crossed over to the gammas and stood in front of them, trying to keep his mind focused on the task ahead. He wanted to make a good first impression on these former rogue wolves, but the closer he got to them, the stronger the smell became.</p><p>\u201cHi, it\u2019s good to see all of you here,\u201d he announced to the assembled group. \u201cI\u2019ve been assigned by the alpha to be your leader on this part of the project. I expect you all to work very hard on this temporary job. You can be assigned a permanent job after training. There have been some alarming reports about the Hunters, as you know, and we have to prepare for them. You\u2019ll all have a vital role in our preparations.\u201d</p><p>Rory paused and looked around the group to check their reactions. Most were listening politely, but one big wolf over by the side of the fireplace glared at him. Rory didn\u2019t know the guy and had done nothing to warrant such a challenging look. He glanced nervously away and tried to concentrate on getting through his speech before the scent of his mate completely overcame him.</p><p>\u201cBe back here in the morning at seven o\u2019clock sharp, ready to work. Any questions?\u201d The big guy spoke up. \u201cYeah, I have a question. How old are you? You look like you\u2019re about fifteen. Are we really expected to take orders from a fifteen-year-old?\u201d</p><p>Rory was so surprised by the remark and the attitude he was speechless for a moment. The guy wasn\u2019t all that much older than Rory. Admittedly, Rory looked a little younger than nineteen, but not that much.</p><p>Surveying the man up and down, he asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d He kept his voice low and calm, imitating the way he\u2019d heard Marco speak many times when he was really pissed off.</p><p>\u201cCasey. And why are you avoiding the question? How old are you?\u201d The guy straightened up from the wall where he leaned. He was even bigger than Rory first thought. At least six foot two, he was extremely muscular, even for wolves well known for their well-toned bodies. His hair was brown and spiky, and his eyes were a startling cat\u2019s eyes shade of green. His face was handsome, despite the scowl and the sneer turning his lips down. As a matter of fact, those lips were full and surprisingly luscious. Rory couldn\u2019t seem to take his eyes off them.</p><p>Casey advanced on Rory in a cocky, self-assured manner, despite the efforts of a few of his friends to catch his arm and pull him back. He shrugged them off and came to stand right in front of Rory. He was most definitely where the scent came from. Up so close, like a cloud drifting off him, the smell hit Rory full force, causing him to take an involuntary step backward. Rory couldn\u2019t understand why everyone around him wasn\u2019t commenting on it, it smelled so delicious. Shocked, Rory looked up into those cat eyes, and his brain screamed at him. Mate! His dick hardened until Rory was afraid everyone would notice the bulge in his pants. Right on the heels of that thought was another one. His mate was a male wolf? No fucking way! </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>They gazes locked, and Casey must have felt it too. He stared down into Rory\u2019s face, and some strong emotion showed behind those incredible eyes. They stood locked in the moment and might have stood that way forever if a strong voice hadn\u2019t called out behind them.</p><p>\u201cHey! What are you two doing? Break it up immediately!\u201d Marco stood in the doorway, with Nicky just behind him. Nicky had a curious look on his pretty face, though Marco just looked angry. Marco came over to stand between them and put a hand on each man\u2019s chest. \u201cWere you two about to fight? We\u2019ll have none of that in here. Is that understood?\u201d</p><p>He nodded to the other uneasy wolves standing around. \u201cGo on and be back here tomorrow at seven.\u201d Marco turned his head toward Casey, indicating a chair by the fireplace. \u201cSit over there and don\u2019t move till I come back. Nicky, stay with him.\u201d He took Rory by the arm and pulled him, stunned and unresisting, into the kitchen. \u201cYou come with me.\u201d</p> <p>Rory\u2019s brain whirled. How could that big wolf be his mate? The smell was unmistakable and so was the message his brain still screamed at him. He actually felt physical pain being pulled away from him. Rory had no idea who he was or how in the hell his screwed-up supernatural blood could have picked another wolf to be his blood match. It didn\u2019t make sense. Wolves didn\u2019t mate wolves.</p><p>Marco shoved Rory down into a chair by the big, wooden kitchen table and stood looking down at him. \u201cCare to tell me what that was all about?\u201d</p><p>Rory put a shaky hand to his face. \u201cI don\u2019t know, Marco. I don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>Marco sat down across from him. Marco, in addition to being the alpha of the pack was also his uncle. More than that, since Rory\u2019s dad had died in a logging accident some ten years before, Marco had been the nearest thing to a father figure he had.</p><p>Marco looked at him with concern. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on, Rory? Tell me.\u201d</p> <p>Rory grabbed Marco\u2019s hand, a move so unusual for him Marco raised his eyebrows in concern. \u201cMarco, I-I think that man is my bloodmate. But how? How can that be? He\u2019s a wolf!\u201d</p><p>Marco narrowed his gaze. \u201cWhat are you talking about? Your bloodmate? What are you feeling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I first walked in, I could smell him, all the way across the room over the smell of the fire. A cotton candy smell, strong and overpowering, but I couldn\u2019t figure out where it was coming from, you know? I looked all over and just saw the gammas by the fire. He challenged my authority right away, asking how old I was, and then he walked over to me, and, oh my God, the smell almost knocked me down. And his eyes! I couldn\u2019t look away from them, and I think he felt it too. We both just stood there like in shock. That\u2019s what you saw when you walked in. We weren\u2019t about to fight at all. I think...I think he was about to kiss me! What am I going to do, Marco? I can\u2019t be in love with another wolf!\u201d</p><p>Before Marco could answer, Nicky spoke up from the doorway. \u201cWell, you\u2019d better figure something out quick, because Casey says he\u2019s coming in there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cComing in here? No!\u201d Rory jumped to his feet and took a few steps backward. The idea of his bloodmate standing in front of him again made Rory\u2019s heart pound, and he had trouble catching his breath.</p><p>\u201cCalm down, I stopped him. He\u2019s freaking out in there too, and yes, he felt the same thing you did. He wants to see you. Marco, I think you\u2019d better talk to him. I can\u2019t make him stay out there much longer.\u201d</p> <p>Marco got up immediately and walked toward the common room. Nicky took his place, taking Rory\u2019s hand in his. \u201cYou okay, kid? You look like you\u2019re about to pass out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not supposed to be this way, Nicky. Two wolves can\u2019t be mates. They\u2019d wind up killing each other. One mate is always the dominant partner, and the other is the submissive. One has to be a pet. That\u2019s the only way this works. Even if two wolves could mate, you can tell which role he\u2019d play. Toppy bastard! I\u2019m not a pet. I\u2019m a wolf.\u201d</p><p>Nicky patted his hand and kept quiet, but Rory shot him a furious look. \u201cI guess you think this is funny, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Rory, after all the problems Marco and I had, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything funny at all about this blood match thing. Are you sure he\u2019s the one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think so. Hell, I don\u2019t know. How does it feel, Nicky? You and Marco have the most intense blood match I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor me it was different, because when I first saw Marco, I was already in heat from your bite and just changed to werekin. It was pretty crazy all the way around even before Marco got there. I do remember the instant he walked in, I couldn\u2019t get close enough. I loved him right away, and I don\u2019t think it was just the magic. I think I would have loved him at first sight no matter what. And the scent of him! It drove me crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the way it is for me. What am I going to do, Nicky?\u201d</p><p>Before Nicky could answer, Marco appeared in the doorway. \u201cRory, I\u2019m going to bring him in. You two need to talk.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo!\u201d Rory jumped to his feet. \u201cI don\u2019t want to see him!\u201d</p><p>Casey\u2019s deep voice came from behind Marco. \u201cYes, you do, and the alpha says we need to talk too. So let\u2019s talk.\u201d He stepped into the kitchen, and right away Rory\u2019s heart beat kicked up. He was so handsome. How had he not noticed that sooner? The smell was strong, wafting around him, and Rory really wanted to pull him close and put his nose up into his throat. What was wrong with him?</p><p>Marco held out a hand to Nicky and the two of them left the kitchen, Nicky casting a sympathetic glance over at Rory as he left. Casey walked slowly up to Rory and took a deep breath. \u201cDamn, you smell good. What is that anyway? Smells a little like...\u201d He took another suspicious sniff. \u201cChocolate chip cookies fresh out of the oven. Do I smell like that to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Rory shook his head firmly.</p><p>Casey looked a little taken aback. \u201cOh, well, okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Rory sighed in defeat. \u201cYou smell like cotton candy.\u201d</p><p>Casey smiled, showing beautiful strong white teeth. \u201cReally? And that\u2019s a good thing, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, very good.\u201d Rory could feel his face turning redder by the minute.</p><p>\u201cI guess we should sit down.\u201d</p><p>Rory nodded nervously and sank to a chair. He shifted nervously while Casey simply sat and gazed at him. He was so aware of the man his body temperature had gone up a few degrees since Casey walked into the room. Casey didn\u2019t color in embarrassment, like Rory, or act nervous in any way. Rory sensed it in him\u2014the ability to be a leader, maybe even more so than Rory.</p><p>\u201cSettle down, honey, I\u2019m not going to bite you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t call me that\u2014I\u2019m not your honey. Wolves don\u2019t mate with wolves and you\u2019re sure as hell not going to make me a sub here. I\u2019m a wolf, just like you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWolves mate whoever the blood tells them to mate, darlin\u2019. Don\u2019t get yourself all upset.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do that! I\u2019m not your darlin\u2019 either!\u201d Rory jumped back to his feet and stood with clenched fists. \u201cThis is all some kind of crazy mix-up. I\u2019m not even all that attracted to you!\u201d</p><p>Casey smiled and looked pointedly down at a huge bulge in the crotch of Rory\u2019s jeans. \u201cYour hard cock tells me otherwise, darlin\u2019.\u201d He got up and walked around the table toward him. Rory found his feet backing up, almost before he knew it was happening. To stand his ground, to show Casey he was just as dominant was his intention, but as the big wolf stalked toward him, he couldn\u2019t stand still. He backed up until he came up against the kitchen counter and could go no farther. Casey didn\u2019t stop until his cock rubbed Rory\u2019s. The sensation made Rory catch his breath.</p><p>\u201cGet away from me, before I knock you down,\u201d Rory said through gritted teeth.</p><p>Casey smiled and pushed even closer. \u201cNow darlin\u2019, you know you don\u2019t want to do that.\u201d</p><p>Rory shoved him as hard as he could, barely moving the larger man. Hands on Casey\u2019s chest, Rory pushed again. Casey knocked Rory\u2019s arms away and wrapped both arms around Rory, pinning his arms to his side. Rory struggled violently, but Casey clasped him in a bear hug, tighter and tighter until Rory\u2019s knees began to buckle, and he couldn\u2019t catch his breath. Only when he sagged did Casey relent, easing his grip, lowering his head to take Rory\u2019s mouth with his own.</p><p>Casey kissed him, but the word kiss was too simple for what was happening to Rory. Casey shook him to his core and gave him feelings he\u2019d never had before. He\u2019d never really kissed too many girls. He\u2019d never kissed a male at all, especially a man who seemed to know exactly how to kiss him to make him feel like he was spinning out of control. Already out of breath, Rory felt like he was drowning, but he didn\u2019t care. He never wanted it to end. Casey did wild things with his tongue inside Rory\u2019s mouth. Rory couldn\u2019t get close enough to him, and he never wanted him to stop.</p><p>Casey lifted his head and gazed down at him. His voice was soft and sexy. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I asked you how old you were out there. When you walked in, I knew you were my mate right away, and when you didn\u2019t acknowledge me or even glance my way, I didn\u2019t like it much. I had to get you to notice me, darlin\u2019. I didn\u2019t mean to embarrass you, though, and I\u2019m sorry if I did. But you\u2019re wrong about not being my honey.\u201d He kissed Rory softly. \u201cAnd my darlin\u2019.\u201d He bent and kissed him again. \u201cAnd my baby too.\u201d He kissed him once again. \u201cCause you\u2019re all those things, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Rory still couldn\u2019t catch his breath. He stared up at Casey like a rabbit charmed by a fox.</p><p>Casey gave him a little squeeze. \u201cAren\u2019t you, baby? Just nod your head now.\u201d</p><p>Rory flushed painfully but nodded his head. Casey smiled and brushed his lips over Rory\u2019s one more time. \u201cThat\u2019s right. I know you\u2019re a wolf, and a very beautiful little wolf, I might add, but I am going to fuck you very soon, darlin\u2019. I\u2019m telling you, so you\u2019ll have a chance to get used to the idea. I\u2019m afraid there\u2019s nothing you can do about it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Casey rubbed his huge cock against Rory\u2019s again, causing him to gasp aloud. \u201cWhen we tie up, when I put my knot deep inside you, I\u2019ll make you scream my name so many times you\u2019ll be hoarse the next day.\u201d</p><p>The knot or bulbus glandis in canines was a large glandular ring of hard tissue around the base of the penis. During the mating, the gland swelled even larger, making it impossible to withdraw until the ritual was finished. A submerged gland secreted chemicals that caused multiple orgasms during the length of time the wolf remained tied with his mate, sometimes for hours. The extreme experience usually caused the chosen mate to pass out from the intensity, frequency, and extended duration of the orgasms. Some orgasms went on for over four minutes. During the first knot-induced climax, the wolf gave his partner the mating bite, sealing their union for life.</p><p>\u201cMaybe those screams will be a little payback for not acknowledging me right away. You never get to ignore me, baby. Not ever again. I\u2019ll show you no mercy when I get you in bed. No mercy at all, darlin\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>He bent and kissed Rory one more time, grinding his lips against Rory\u2019s, sweeping his tongue over the inside of his mouth and nipping at his bottom lip. \u201cI\u2019ll see you in the morning. Seven sharp, I think you said? You\u2019ll dream about me tonight, and I\u2019ll dream of you too. Goodnight, my little wolf.\u201d</p><p>Casey let him go, turned, and left the room quickly, leaving Rory trembling. At the door, Casey nearly ran into Nicky, followed more slowly by Marco. Nicky was back, Rory knew, because he was so damned nosy he couldn\u2019t stay away.</p><p>\u201cWhoa, Casey, slow down.\u201d Nicky put his hands up to stop Casey, with an amused glance over at Rory. \u201cIs everything okay with you guys?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, everything\u2019s just fine with me.\u201d Casey smiled wolfishly, looking over his shoulder at Rory. \u201cAs for Ian, he\u2019s getting there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIan?\u201d Nicky said blankly. He looked from Casey to Rory and back again. \u201cHis name\u2019s not Ian. This is Rory.\u201d</p> <p>Casey\u2019s head whipped around and a look of absolute shock came over his handsome features. \u201cRory?\u201d he said, shaking his head back and forth slowly. \u201cNo, not Rory. He\u2019s Ian.\u201d</p><p>Nicky tilted his head, puzzled. \u201cCasey, are you okay? Ian is our beta. This is Rory, our new lead gamma.\u201d A little smile played around his pretty lips. \u201cDon\u2019t you even know your future mate\u2019s name?\u201d</p><p>Casey turned and, stumbling, practically ran from the hall, leaving Nicky looking after him in surprise, and Rory quaking as he stood against the counter staring at the empty doorway.</p><p>\u201cWhat in the world was that about?\u201d Nicky bounced over to him and arched a smile at Rory. \u201cWell? What happened? Is he the one?\u201d</p><p>Rory nodded. \u201cI think so. Yes, I know he is.\u201d He put his hands over his face and groaned.</p><p>Marco came over to stand beside him and put a hand on his shoulder. \u201cSurely it\u2019s not as bad as all that. Sit down for a minute. Let\u2019s talk.\u201d</p> <p>Talking was the last thing he wanted to do. He wasn\u2019t sure exactly what he did want to do, except go running after a complete stranger and beg to stay with him. Unable to refuse an order from his alpha, he allowed Marco to draw him over to the table and sit him down.</p><p>\u201cNow start from the beginning. Why are you so upset?\u201d Marco\u2019s tone was soothing, and Nicky put a companionable arm around him, even though Marco shot Nicky a jealous, disapproving glance. A wolf never touched a mated pet, unless they were family. Even with his nephew, Marco was possessive and jealous of sharing Nicky\u2019s touch.</p><p>Rory took a deep breath. \u201cHe\u2019s so...he\u2019s such a...oh God, Marco. He said I\u2019m his mate, and he knew it the minute I walked in. He called me his baby, and his darlin\u2019.\u201d Rory\u2019s tone was bitter, yet a shiver of sexual pleasure ran through him at the words.</p><p>Nicky laughed out loud, and both men shot him a look of dismay. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Nicky said, wiping his eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t mean to laugh, but you said that like those were fighting words, or like it\u2019s such a terrible thing to be someone\u2019s darling. I think it\u2019s wonderful! I\u2019m Marco\u2019s darling, aren\u2019t I, sweetheart? And I love it!\u201d</p><p>Marco shook his head, though he smiled at his mate. \u201cYes, you certainly are, baby, but that\u2019s exactly what Rory means. Wolves are supposed to be the dominant partners. We call our mates those names, and we certainly mean them,\u201d he hastened to say at Nicky\u2019s sharp look. \u201cBut in this case, I think Rory\u2019s saying Casey is making a bid for dominance over him. For a wolf, that\u2019s very...uh...pack law forbids wolves mating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery what?\u201d Nicky demanded. \u201cMy Lord, you wolves are so Neanderthal when it comes to being the dominant partner. You, Tarzan, me, Jane. So last century!\u201d</p><p>Marco blushed. Nicky was the only one who could ever make him do that, Rory thought irrelevantly as Marco spoke. He\u2019d snap anyone else\u2019s head off for daring to speak to him that way. Nicky totally bossed him around and he seemed to love it. \u201cWell, we\u2019ll talk about all that later, honey. Right now, Rory has a problem, and I need to concentrate on that issue if you don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>Nicky shrugged, pouting, and allowed Marco to take over. \u201cWe\u2019ve never had a situation like this before that I can remember, Rory, so we\u2019re in uncharted territory here. It may be that it isn\u2019t so much that it\u2019s forbidden as it\u2019s never happened before. What is obvious is, if it\u2019s a blood match, it\u2019s too strong to be denied and ignoring it would make you both miserable. I don\u2019t know what the reason is for forbidding two wolves to mate, except for the obvious when it\u2019s two males, of course.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat obvious?\u201d Nicky asked, unable to stay out of this.</p><p>\u201cThe dominance. Remember when I gave you my knot, baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm, yes I do. It was amazing.\u201d Nicky got a dreamy look on his face.</p><p>Marco smiled fondly and colored a little again. \u201cOnly one can give the knot and mating bite. As far as I know, no one knows what taking the knot and getting the mating bite would do to a male wolf or feeding from the dominant\u2019s blood to complete the bonding. We know what the changes do to a pet or human, not wolf. He could be changed in some way just like you were.\u201d</p><p>Nicky dropped his arm from Rory\u2019s shoulders. \u201cOh, I get it. He could become werekin instead of wolf. It could mean a fate worse than death, huh? He could actually become a pet, like me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, Nicky...\u201d Marco put his hand out to cover his mate\u2019s, but Nicky brushed it away.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t patronize me, Marco. I knew all along how you wolves really feel. Pets are second class, no matter how much you go on and on about loving and treasuring us.\u201d</p><p>Rory spoke up quickly with a firm shake of his head. \u201cNo, you\u2019re wrong, Nicky. We do love and treasure our pets. More than you could know! And they\u2019re not second class anything. It\u2019s just that a wolf has a strong need to protect and yes, dominate. If we can\u2019t do that, it might destroy us, tear us apart, and cause such a split inside we\u2019d never be whole again. I\u2019m so torn right now between wanting to be with my mate and let him do whatever he wants to do with me, and at the same time, I want to care for him, protect him, and own him. I can\u2019t stand the thought of him with someone else.\u201d</p><p>Nicky\u2019s voice was softer as he gazed into Rory\u2019s eyes. \u201cSounds just like me. Don\u2019t you know if you mate, you own him as much as he owns you?\u201d He glanced up at Marco, who nodded slowly.</p><p>\u201cNicky\u2019s right, Rory. I never thought of it like that, but it\u2019s absolutely true. Nicky totally owns me, just as I do him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if you couldn\u2019t shift again, Marco? If you couldn\u2019t care for your family? No, I can\u2019t do this. I\u2019ll just have to reject him as my mate. It\u2019s the only way.\u201d</p><p>Marco sighed deeply. \u201cYou can try, but you\u2019ll wind up miserable, maybe even sick. You\u2019ve never shown any alpha traits, Rory, so it may not be as hard or different as you think.\u201d</p><p>Rory stood up, resolute, shaking his head. \u201cBut you don\u2019t know what will happen. I have to try to fight it.\u201d He looked down at Marco and Nicky. \u201cThanks for trying to help me. Please, Nicky, don\u2019t mention this to anyone.\u201d</p><p>Nicky looked hurt. \u201cOf course not. I don\u2019t gossip.\u201d Marco and Rory both looked at him dubiously, but wisely let it drop.</p><p>Rory went to the door. \u201cI\u2019ll let you know what happens, Alpha. Don\u2019t worry. I can do my job tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no doubt, Rory.\u201d</p><p>Closing the door behind him, Rory leaned his back against it for a moment and heard Nicky sigh, even through the thickness of the wood. He hadn\u2019t meant to eavesdrop but when he heard Nicky speak, he couldn\u2019t stop himself. \u201cI wonder how long it will be before Rory gives in?\u201d he heard Nicky say. \u201cCasey looked to me to be a man who won\u2019t easily take no for an answer. And what do you think all that was about Ian? He looked pretty shocked to hear Rory\u2019s name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019s just your imagination, honey,\u201d Marco replied. \u201cThey were both a little stunned by the whole thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe so,\u201d Nicky said softly. \u201cBut something tells me there\u2019s more to this than meets the eye.\u201d</p><p>The next morning, Rory was at the common room early, by six forty-five. He half-hoped Casey would be early too, but he was nowhere to be seen. Rory got a cup of coffee and stood by the fire, warming himself before going out in the cold March morning. He\u2019d dreamed about Casey the night before, just like he\u2019d told him he would. Crazy, disjointed dreams making no sense, except for one of them. In that dream, he lost his mate and couldn\u2019t find him, no matter how hard he searched. He was alone in the forest, roaming the trails as a wolf, howling for his mate, lifting his face to the indifferent moon and crying out for him.</p><p>With a headache, he was feeling irritable and out of sorts. When the men finally started filing in a few minutes before seven, Casey was among them with a scowl on his face. Rory had smelled them coming across the courtyard because of Casey and that damn cotton candy scent of his. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The evening before, Rory\u2019s lack of acknowledgment had irritated Casey. Rory planned today to ignore him completely, and what he would say to that? He had to show the larger wolf he was not about to be dominated or told what to do. He was a wolf, not a submissive. He would not, could not be anything but a wolf. So why were his palms damp just thinking about Casey\u2019s possible displeasure?</p><p>As they came over, Casey was right up front. Oddly, he didn\u2019t make eye contact with Rory, and Rory felt a tug of disappointment.</p><p>Rory spoke to the group, assuming a confidence he didn\u2019t really feel. \u201cIs everyone ready to work? The alpha wants us to do the unskilled labor, just general clean-up of the work site, picking up nails and discarded lumber, and so forth, pretty much whatever the beta tells us. We\u2019ll break for lunch around noon for an hour and get off at three o\u2019clock. Any questions?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, I have one.\u201d</p><p>Rory knew without even looking who was speaking. He tightened his lips and turned toward Casey. \u201cYes? Still need to know how old I am before you can go to work?\u201d</p><p>Casey raised his eyebrows innocently and said, \u201cNo. Although you never did say, come to think of it. But no, I was just going to ask about bathroom breaks. Do we get those? I was just wondering.\u201d</p><p>Knowing he was being a smartass, Rory tried to answer calmly, not letting Casey rattle him. \u201cJust as many as you need, uh...Connor, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Casey\u2019s eyes narrowed, promising payback for pretending to forget his name, and Rory got a stomach full of butterflies.</p> <p>\u201cThe name\u2019s Casey. Not a hard name to remember, but maybe after you shout it out a few times, it\u2019ll stick with you.\u201d</p><p>Rory felt the hot blood staining his cheeks. He lifted his chin, walked quickly past him and out the door to the worksite, hearing a soft chuckle behind him.</p><p>Ian already had a construction crew on site, getting started. Rory introduced him to the new crew and then stood aside for Ian to tell them what needed to be done. Ian, a quiet person, carefully considered his words before he ever spoke, the sign of a good advisor and a good beta. His mate had died in childbirth over two years ago, and he had almost grieved himself to death. Sorrow to such a degree was another drawback to mating for life. When your mate was unavailable to you, for whatever reason, there was no backup plan. If you were very lucky, you might find a love match, but that was difficult and rare for wolves.</p><p>Jobs were assigned, and Rory was happy to see his crew working hard and doing a good job. Casey stayed near the back of the new addition, working with some of the roofers, sparing Rory his remarks and sidelong looks. He could still smell him though, even from so far away, and he was really becoming used to that smell, clogging his nostrils and setting up a deep craving in him. All he wanted to do was go find Casey, step into his arms, and breathe him in deeply. He could see Nicky in his mind\u2019s eye, always putting his nose against Marco\u2019s neck. Now he understood why.</p><p>As the morning wore on, the sun became very warm, with only the cool southwesterly breeze keeping it from being uncomfortable. Unusually warm weather for March, but it made for ideal working conditions. At lunchtime, Casey came around the building, minus his shirt, and Rory caught his breath. His body was sculpted and cut with muscles, skin was tanned and brown. His abs were washboard flat, and he had almost no hair on his chest at all, just a little treasure trail below his navel, disappearing into his jeans. Perfect, of course, Rory thought bitterly, and dropped his gaze quickly when Casey caught him looking.</p><p>Casey walked over to where he was making notes. He was sweating a little, and the cool breeze picked up the scent and waved it temptingly under Rory\u2019s nose, begging him to take a bite of those enticing abs.</p> <p>He stood for a moment until Rory looked up at him. \u201cI changed my mind, you know. You\u2019re not my mate, after all.\u201d</p><p>Momentarily shocked by the sharp pain slashing through him at the words, Rory dropped his gaze for a moment before raising his head again. \u201cGood. Then we agree, so leave me alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a problem.\u201d Casey shot him a furious look and stalked off to stand a few feet away talking to one of the other gammas, his back firmly turned to Rory.</p><p>Rory clenched his fists, determined not to let this man get to him, but he\u2019d crawled under his skin with ease. To Rory\u2019s shame, his cock jumped to attention, rigid and ready, at the sound of Casey\u2019s voice. He couldn\u2019t let Casey see how much he wanted him, and he definitely couldn\u2019t let Casey see how much his words hurt.</p><p>Wanting to get away from him, Rory jumped to his feet and turned, running into one of the day laborers brought onto the job from the nearby town of Brevard. The big, burly man was carrying a large sheet of plywood. Rory knocked the sheet from the man\u2019s hand, almost knocking him over as well. The man turned on Rory angrily.</p><p>\u201cHey, watch where you\u2019re going! Dammit!\u201d A meaty hand on Rory\u2019s chest shoved him backward. Caught off balance, Rory fell hard, smashed his elbow against the ground and yelped out in pain.</p><p>Before Rory could react, Casey crossed the short distance between them and was in the man\u2019s face, his expression murderous. \u201cYou got a problem, buddy, take it up with me. Keep your fucking hands off him! It was an accident, and you\u2019re fixing to have a bad one if you touch him again!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay, sorry!\u201d His nerve breaking at the sight of the furious, massive young wolf in his face, the man picked up his piece of plywood and moved quickly away.</p> <p>Rory watched the exchange with his mouth open and the strangest warm tingling he\u2019d ever had swept over him.</p><p>Casey turned to Rory and stood over him looking down. \u201cDid he hurt you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about your elbow?\u201d</p><p>Rory realized he was cradling his elbow in his hand. He dropped it quickly. \u201cNo, no. I\u2019m okay, really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Good. Okay then.\u201d Casey turned around and walked away quickly. Grabbing his shirt, he shrugged it on and hurried back toward the compound for lunch, leaving Rory still on the ground, staring after him in surprise and feeling as strangely bereft from Casey walking away as he\u2019d felt excited when Casey protected him.</p><p>The rest of the day passed slowly. Casey tried to stay away from Rory as much as he could, his feelings in conflicting confusion. He finished his work for the day and walked tiredly back to the compound. Rory had left an hour or so before.</p><p>Casey knew when Rory left, as certainly as if he\u2019d come to tell him. He could already sense a great deal about him, and he knew if\u2014or when\u2014they mated, he\u2019d be able to pick up his thoughts as well.</p><p>Casey was by far the most dominant wolf in the equation, and he suffered no doubts Rory, as driven as he was, would answer the blood call. The problem was the idea of mating with Rory was the most difficult thing in the world. It just wasn\u2019t possible for Rory to be his mate. What kind of crazy cosmic joke was this, anyway? He\u2019d come to the Mountain Wolf compound for one reason and one reason only\u2014to kill the wolf called Rory, taking his justifiable revenge against the man who\u2019d killed his brother. How could this killer be his bloodmate? It just didn\u2019t seem within the realm of possibility.</p><p>When he\u2019d first arrived with the rogue group, he\u2019d been given a list and told to pick a work station. When he saw Rory\u2019s name as a gamma, along with a wolf named Ian as crew leader, he\u2019d been excited over how easily he\u2019d located his brother\u2019s murderer and could get close to him. He\u2019d signed up for the work detail immediately. He\u2019d shown up for work early, anxious to get a good look at the man he was soon going to kill. The delicious smell wafting into the common room stunned him at first and then fascinated him. Wolves never knew when they might meet their blood match, and it usually came when they least expected. Certainly, now, while he was on a vengeance quest for his brother, was not a time he expected to run into his mate, but the scent intrigued and beckoned him.</p><p>When the young, gorgeous wolf walked into the room, Casey could barely restrain himself from leaping over the chairs between them and taking him right there in front of everyone. He was smaller than average, but perfect, with beautiful little features and curly brown hair. He definitely had the cutest little bubble butt Casey had seen in a long time. Casey had a sudden vision of his cock stuck firmly between those delectable ass cheeks. The young wolf seemed not to even notice him, and Casey found himself incensed and determined to make him pay attention. He assumed the young man was Ian, the crew leader. When they stood close together, just before the alpha told them to break it up, he had been very tempted to kiss his beautiful young wolf right then.</p><p>When the alpha\u2019s mate, Nicky, called him not Ian, but Rory, Casey was devastated and rocked to his core. All he could do was run back to his room and lick his wounds, trying to figure out how such an insane thing could have happened.</p><p>By morning, he\u2019d pretty much convinced himself he was mistaken, and he wasn\u2019t nearly as attracted to Rory as he thought he was. Casey was strong\u2014he\u2019d always been strong willed and able to do anything he put his mind to doing. He could beat this thing. He\u2019d steel himself against the little murdering bastard and not be bothered by any stupid smell. He could do this. Rory was not his mate. The very idea was ludicrous. He left his room the next morning confident and strong, ready to put aside any tender feelings he might still be harboring for the young wolf.</p><p>That lasted until Rory walked in with his little notebook, looking nervous and tired, with bluish shadows under his pretty eyes, like he hadn\u2019t slept well. Tenderness, love, and passion almost overwhelmed Casey, and his shoulders slumped in defeat. He planned on ignoring him, but once again, he had to speak to him, to tease him, to make Rory notice him, like a damn kid. Later, when the dude pushed him down at the work site, he literally saw red. Damn! He felt so protective of him, he wanted to wrap him up in cotton and keep him safe.</p><p>Casey walked back to the compound dragging his feet, dreading the evening when he might see him again at supper. In the common room for dinner, he looked for Rory right away, spotting him sitting at the table of the alpha, Marco. Marco\u2019s beautiful mate, Nicky, was with them, and he gave Casey a little wave as he walked in. Rory pretended not to see Casey. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>That\u2019s okay, darlin\u2019. You know I\u2019m here, and it\u2019s taking your appetite away, isn\u2019t it? Good. Suffer, damn it. You need to suffer like my brother did. Like I\u2019m suffering now seeing how fuckin\u2019 gorgeous you are. Damn you!</p><p>Despite his harsh thoughts, every protective instinct in his body wanted to go to Rory and make sure he ate a good meal. He had to make himself stop being so protective, not think of him as his mate and fortify himself against him. He had to stop thinking of him, period. Only how in the hell was he going to do that?</p><p>After supper, he waited until he saw Rory go upstairs for the night. He went to his own room for a long, hot shower. Afterward, he slid into bed. Once there he tossed and turned, trying to sleep, trying to make his mind a blank. Instead, all he could think about was Rory. He wondered if Rory was in bed too, lying there, maybe thinking of him.</p> <p>Giving up, he slipped out of bed and got into his clothes. He went to find Rory, unable to stay away, unable to stop thinking about him. He needed to see him. He needed to be alone with him to figure out if he was really the one. If he was, everything would have to be different, and he wouldn\u2019t be able to complete his quest for revenge. At least not the way he\u2019d originally planned. A wolf was unable to kill his mate\u2014physically, emotionally unable without killing himself. It was unthinkable. In his heart, he already knew Rory was the one, and the real reason he left his room was he couldn\u2019t stay away.</p><p>He knew where Rory\u2019s room was, but he could have found it without prior knowledge. Right up until the moment he entered the hallway, Casey still had faint hopes he was mistaken about Rory being his mate. The overpowering smell of chocolate chip cookies, his favorite smell, drew him right to Rory\u2019s room. The door was unlocked, and he eased it open, finding the room glowing as pale silver moonlight streamed through an open window. Rory must have gone right to bed after he ate dinner and was stretched out on his back under a single sheet.</p><p>His mate was naked, his T-shirt and underwear lying on the floor beside the bed as if he\u2019d pulled them off while he slept. Had been dreaming and got too hot? Was it Casey he dreamed about? At the idea, a wolfish smile lit up his face. Everyone in the compound thought Nicky was the most beautiful male anyone had ever seen, and he truly was something to see, but looking down at his pretty mate, Casey thought Rory was gorgeous in his own right. His hair was a soft and silky brown, streaked with golden highlights. He had a handsome face, with high cheekbones and a cute little nose turned up ever so slightly on the end. Casey wanted to bend over and kiss the tip of his nose, but settled for brushing his finger over the tip. He smiled when Rory reached up to scratch at it. Stepping back, he dragged the sheet with him to admire Rory\u2019s body, lean and perfect, with wide shoulders, tapering down to a small waist. His abs rippled with muscles, and Casey couldn\u2019t stop himself from bending over to brush his lips across them. Rory sighed in his sleep and tried to turn over. A hand on his stomach kept him in place, but disturbed, Rory twisted his legs restlessly and moaned.</p><p>Sitting down on the side of the bed, Casey shook Rory gently. Coming awake slowly, he murmured something in his sleep, saying Casey\u2019s name. He came wide awake as he realized who sat on the bed beside him.</p><p>\u201cWhat...what are you doing here?\u201d His voice was panicky and breathless. \u201cShhh. Don\u2019t talk.\u201d Rory sat up, scooting high up in the bed next to the headboard to get as far away as possible. He yanked the sheet back up to his chest. \u201cGet out of here, Casey! We have nothing to talk about. Please. I-I\u2019ll see you tomorrow.\u201d</p> <p>Casey shook his head. \u201cNo. It\u2019s no good. You\u2019re my mate, and I can\u2019t fight it. I\u2019m tired of fighting it. Now that I\u2019ve found you, I can\u2019t eat, sleep, or do anything but think about you. You know it will be that way until we mate. Maybe then I can get some peace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! You don\u2019t understand. I\u2019m not ready yet. I have to have some time.\u201d \u201cTime to talk yourself out of it? Time to run away? No, it has to be soon. I can\u2019t wait much longer.\u201d</p><p>He gripped Rory\u2019s ankle and pulled him down from the headboard. Catching him under the arms, he lifted him onto his lap. Though Rory struggled a little, Casey took his mouth with his own and kissed him, grinding his mouth into his and battling his tongue for control until Rory kissed him back, arms wrapping tight around Casey\u2019s neck. Casey licked gently at his mouth, teasing his bottom lip with his teeth.</p><p>He laid Rory\u2019s unresisting body back on the covers and trailed kisses down his throat and onto his chest. He spent some time with each nipple, while Rory writhed under his tongue. When Rory\u2019s hand gripped his own cock, Casey pushed his hand away and took Rory\u2019s beautiful cock, rubbing the tip with his thumb while he finished his ministrations on Rory\u2019s nipples with his mouth and tongue. Slowly he continued a trail of kisses to Rory\u2019s groin where he engulfed the sweet weeping cock in his mouth, sucking it to the back of his throat when Rory\u2019s hips surged up in welcome. Over the length of the shaft, licking at the underside, he moved slowly up and down.</p><p>Rory gripped the sheets on the mattress so hard his knuckles went white, and he groaned so loudly Casey was afraid someone would come in to check on him any minute. He brought his tongue up to the tip of Rory\u2019s cock and made a rolling swirl. Rory couldn\u2019t hang on any longer. His hips bucked, fucking Casey\u2019s mouth hard, gasping out, \u201cCasey, Casey,\u201d over and over as he came explosively. Casey took every drop of his salty cum, sucking it down his throat and kept on sucking until Rory begged him to stop. Only then did he pull his mouth away with a soft plop. Rory trembled all over, limp when Casey pulled him into his arms and kissed him. Rory\u2019s arms slipped around his waist, snuggling close to him.</p><p>\u201cTell me the truth, baby. Was that your first time?\u201d</p> <p>Rory dropped his long lashes over his eyes and nodded shyly. \u201cYes,\u201d he said breathlessly.</p><p>Casey smiled, a thrill of ownership coursing through him. \u201cGood. I\u2019ll be your first and your last, darlin\u2019. No one else will ever touch you like this except me.\u201d</p><p>Rory nodded slowly, refusing to raise his gaze.</p><p>\u201cThat was your first lesson, Rory. We can\u2019t deny our blood song. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>Rory nodded again.</p><p>\u201cSay it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Next time you\u2019ll come to me. Come to my room tomorrow night, baby. Don\u2019t make me come looking for you.\u201d</p> <p>Casey stood up and walked out of the room as silently as he\u2019d come, leaving Rory sitting on the bed looking stunned.</p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>Casey trudged back to the compound wearily after a long day. They\u2019d begun their combat training with hand to hand fighting, and shifting back and forth into their wolves. He was bruised all over. Rory never showed up, and Casey was dying to get his hands on him. He knew Rory was hiding from him.</p><p>When he passed the common room, he was surprised to see decorations adorning the walls and tables, with fresh flowers everywhere. He stopped one of the pretty young pets passing by with her arms full of streamers to ask the occasion.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the first anniversary party of our alpha and his mate, Nicky. We\u2019re having a big party tonight, with dinner and dancing. Nicky said it would get our minds off all this war talk. It should be fun!\u201d She batted her eyelashes at him. \u201cMaybe you can save a dance for me, sir.\u201d</p><p>Casey smiled and nodded, but his interests didn\u2019t lie in pretty little dark-haired girls. The object of his desire happened to be a stubborn, beautiful, murdering little wolf. Maybe he\u2019d make him dance with him tonight. He smiled at the thought of the look on Rory\u2019s face if he approached him for a dance. He was so afraid of losing his status, of having to submit to another wolf. Submitting to your alpha was one thing\u2014all the wolves in Marco\u2019s pack had to yield to him. But to be submissive to another wolf, one who was his mate and would dominate him, was giving him terrible trouble. It was why he kept denying Casey, despite the evidence of his body and mind.</p><p>For Casey, it was a good thing, the one thing that might salvage this situation for him. It was painfully obvious he couldn\u2019t kill him as he\u2019d planned. Rory was his bloodmate, and he would rip out the throat of anyone else who dared even threaten him. He could, however, take him over and make him submit, make him, in effect, his prisoner. He could, and he would. Before another day went by, Rory would be his mate and his captive. Rory would be in his custody for life. For a wolf shapeshifter, being owned body and soul by another wolf would be torture. He would make it an exquisite torture for his beloved mate, but torture it would be. He\u2019d pay for what he\u2019d done, one way or the other.</p><p>Marco called to him from across the room, and he turned to face him with a respectful tilt of his head. The alpha walked over to him.</p><p>\u201cCasey, I hope you\u2019ve had a chance to talk things over with Rory.\u201d</p><p>Casey was noncommittal, spreading his hands. \u201cI\u2019ve tried, Alpha, but he refuses to talk to me. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s interested in having a mate right now.\u201d</p><p>Marco frowned. \u201cWe\u2019ve never had a situation like this before. Unfortunately, you know as well as I do neither of you has much choice. Do I understand correctly you\u2019re not opposed to so uncertain a mating if he changes his mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll speak with him again. Nothing good can come of his denial. He simply has to face whatever is going to come of this. Give him a little time to come around. Don\u2019t try to force it on him. Maybe you can talk to him tonight at the party?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I plan to.\u201d</p><p>Marco looked at him sharply.</p><p>Casey tried to look as non-threatening as he could, not wanting to arouse Marco\u2019s suspicions. He wasn\u2019t ready yet for them to know who he really was and his reason for being there.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Marco said. \u201cThanks for being understanding about this. He\u2019s a good boy, Casey. I wouldn\u2019t want to see him hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither would I,\u201d Casey replied. It was true, he didn\u2019t want to physically hurt him and would kill anyone who tried. He just wanted to own him, body and soul, stripping him of every ounce of pride. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBy the way, Casey, I spoke to Shawna about you. She said you joined their rogue pack only a few days before they rejoined us. Is that correct?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere had you been before that?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI suppose you could say I was unaffiliated.\u201d Casey grinned at the alpha, mixing truth with insinuation. \u201cMy parents were rogues, and after they died, it was just me and my brother. He passed away too, and I sort of drifted around until I met up with Shawna\u2019s group. They took me in. End of story, I guess.\u201d The story was fairly true, as far as it went.</p><p>\u201cHow have you been identified as far as rank? Did Shawna or anyone in her pack submit you to a challenge?\u201d</p><p>A challenge was traditionally a way for a wolf pack to determine what rank their wolves belonged to. Once a wolf reached puberty, he would go into the ancestral ring to wrestle with other wolves of his age. In this way, potential alphas were picked out of the pack for further training. Alphas and betas were both rare and highly prized, although in Casey\u2019s own pack, the old ways were not practiced with any diligence.</p><p>Casey shook his head, and by answering only the second part of Marco\u2019s question, he as much as lied again. He knew his rank very well. He was alpha. \u201cNo, there wasn\u2019t time for that\u2014 when I got to the pack, things were sort of in flux, and they were trying to reconnect with the Dark Hollow Wolves.\u201d</p><p>Marco studied him silently. \u201cI think we should put you in the ring very soon, then. Something tells me you\u2019re an alpha. Has anyone ever told you that before?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d Casey answered in a complete out and out lie.</p><p>\u201cIf you are, it would make it even harder on Rory, I\u2019m afraid, but it can\u2019t be helped. It\u2019s time he faced his insecurities and his responsibilities to his mate. I\u2019ve tried to be patient with him, but perhaps it\u2019s time for firmness now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can do that.\u201d</p><p>Marco looked at him in surprise. Then he nodded thoughtfully. \u201cI believe you can. Well, I hope you\u2019ve found a home here with us and Rory. I hope you\u2019ll have a good time tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure I will. Thank you, Alpha.\u201d</p><p>Watching Marco walk away, Casey\u2019s mind strayed back to not quite a year ago, when his brother Aaron, then the Alpha of the Sapphire Wolf Clan, had told him of some news he\u2019d just heard.</p> <p>\u201cMarco, Alpha of the Dark Hollow Pack, has a new mate. They say it\u2019s a pretty young man. Pretty special, too, and Marco\u2019s besotted with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Casey shrugged, only mildly interested in what was going on with the rival Clan. The two clans had been at odds since before anyone could remember, often raiding each other\u2019s camps, and taking prisoners for ransom. There hadn\u2019t been a raid for many years, and Casey was content to keep it that way. The Dark Hollow Pack had grown large and prosperous under Marco\u2019s leadership, and Casey thought it would be a good idea to let sleeping dogs lie.</p><p>\u201cNicky is his name. I\u2019ll bet Marco would pay a pretty penny to get him back should anyone decide to kidnap him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no, Aaron. I don\u2019t like the look in your eye. Marco\u2019s pack is larger than ours, and if we took his mate, he\u2019d be furious. This is not a good idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the alpha, Casey, and I decide what\u2019s a good idea and what\u2019s not. It\u2019s your job just to go along with me. Is that clear?\u201d</p><p>Casey bit his lip and nodded. \u201cYes, Alpha.\u201d</p><p>The old alpha had allowed challenges almost to go out of style, and when he died, Aaron was the only one who stepped up to take his place, claiming to be an alpha without any real challenge of any kind. Casey hadn\u2019t wanted to go up against his brother, though he knew in his heart he was the natural-born leader. His brother was too hot-headed, too rash ever to be a good alpha. But Aaron, seven years older, had raised Casey like his own son after their parents died in a car accident, and Casey felt he owed him everything. Certainly he owed him his allegiance if he wanted to be the alpha male. He\u2019d put aside his own feelings and gave his total loyalty to his brother, no matter how painful it was to him. This latest idea, however, struck him as just asking for trouble.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve decided. We\u2019ll go over to the Dark Hollow Pack\u2019s compound and just sniff around a little. We won\u2019t take any untoward risks, but if a situation happens to present itself, why then...\u201d</p> <p>They had sniffed around for several days, camping nearby, out of range of the nightly patrols and slipping across the boundary lines during the daytime. On the third day, they\u2019d seen him. He was outside on the lawns, near the woods, playing football with a young boy of around twelve or thirteen. The boy was a pet too, by the look of him. Both were barefoot and wearing the characteristic tight leather pants and no shirt. Immediately struck by his golden beauty, Casey still got a very bad feeling about the whole thing. First of all, why were these two valuable pets left alone and unguarded? Where were their masters? Something about it didn\u2019t feel right, and Casey tried to caution Aaron, who shrugged him off, saying, \u201cTheir loss is my gain! Who cares where their masters are? This is being served up to us on a golden platter, and I\u2019m taking advantage of it!\u201d</p><p>Aaron seized the young boy first when his ball came rolling into the edge of the woods and threw him to Casey to bind and gag. He caught Nicky next when he came looking for the boy. He put up quite a fight. It was all Aaron could do to subdue him without seriously hurting him. He finally got him tied and gagged, but Aaron had hit him a few times to get him to settle down. It was unusual for a pet to be so aggressive when fighting off two grown wolves, and Casey\u2019s uneasiness came back with a vengeance, even more so when he saw the cockstand Aaron had after fighting with the beautiful creature.</p><p>\u201cJust you wait till I get you home, pretty boy. I\u2019ll show you what a real man can do. You might even decide to stay with me once you get a taste of this,\u201d he bragged crudely, grabbing himself and thrusting his groin toward Nicky\u2019s face. Nicky turned his head and bucked his hips wildly, trying to loosen his bonds, but Aaron laughed and threw him over his shoulder.</p><p>As they ran down the trail back to their temporary camp, Casey holding the young boy and Nicky slung over Aaron\u2019s shoulder, his uneasiness built, like something bad was coming and coming soon. He didn\u2019t doubt Marco had bonded with his beautiful mate and was probably picking up on his distress right that minute. They ran as fast as they could, with Nicky struggling every step of the way, until they heard an unearthly howl of rage and pain behind them on the trail. It shook Casey badly, and he knew it must have affected Aaron too, because he cast a wild glance over his shoulder and threw Nicky to the ground. He turned, looked back over his shoulder at his brother, and said one word, \u201cRun!\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, Aaron, let me stay with you and fight.\u201d</p><p>Aaron held a knife to Nicky\u2019s throat. \u201cNo. Get home. I\u2019ll be along in a few minutes after I deal with Marco. Since his mate\u2019s not hurt, he\u2019ll make a deal with me. Now get! Do as I say!\u201d</p><p>Reluctantly, Casey put the young boy down by the side of the trail and ran all the way back to camp. He waited around for almost two hours, could stand it no longer and circled back to where he\u2019d last seen his brother. There, on the ground, his throat ripped out, lay his brother, his blood already cold. He must have been killed right after Casey left him. They hadn\u2019t even bothered to bury him or cover his body, just left him lying on the trail like garbage. Casey howled his grief and rage and took his brother home for a decent burial. Every step of the way, he vowed revenge. Nothing had happened to Nicky or the young boy that warranted his brother\u2019s death. Aaron had touched another wolf\u2019s mate, and he had made threats to Nicky, yes, but he hadn\u2019t hurt him, really, just roughed him up a bit when he struggled. He couldn\u2019t believe Marco had taken such a drastic action, regardless of how much he cared for his mate.</p><p>Only later did he learn from the rogue pack in the area that it hadn\u2019t been Marco who killed his brother, but a young relative of his named Rory. According to those sources, Rory jumped on his brother in wolf form, not giving Aaron a chance to shift, and killed him before Marco could even interrogate Aaron. As far as Casey was concerned it was murder, pure and simple. A man didn\u2019t stand a chance against a wolf, and Rory must have known it. Aaron had put himself in a bad position, yes, but he deserved at least a fair fight, and he hadn\u2019t received it. For that, Casey vowed, Rory would pay with his own life. He would find him and kill him for what he\u2019d done.</p><p>Coming back to the present with sigh, Casey wished it could be as easy as he\u2019d once thought it would be.</p><p>Once in his room, he stripped off his clothing and got into the shower, turning on the water as hot as he could stand it. He wished Rory was in the shower with him, his little body slick with soap and water.</p><p>Casey would take his own soapy hand and slick it up and down slowly on Rory\u2019s cock, then turn him around and take care of the backside as well. Rory\u2019s knees would be trembling, and Casey would put his arms around him and hold him close, kissing him sweetly and tenderly, rubbing his hardness against him, while his hands roamed over his body.</p><p>Smiling at his own daydreams, he finished his shower. Tonight, little wolf. Tonight I\u2019ll make you mine. He stepped out of the shower and dried himself before stretching out on the bed still naked to rest before dinner. He\u2019d told Rory to come to him tonight, but he didn\u2019t think Rory would. He was still too terrified of Casey and what he might do to him. What he would do to him. Despite what he\u2019d told Marco, force might be needed, but he hoped to avoid that. He wanted him to come to him willingly, because he couldn\u2019t stay away.</p><p>Tonight, one way or the other, Rory would become his mate. He wasn\u2019t waiting any longer. If Rory wanted to avoid it, forcing him to submit would make it that much sweeter. After submission, he would make him his pet. No more wolf for you, baby. That\u2019s your punishment, sweetheart, and I\u2019ll see to it that you never shift again. From tomorrow on, you\u2019re mine to do with as I will. You\u2019ll wear my collar. Every night, I\u2019ll feed you my blood to make you docile, and then fuck you hard and make you like it. Instead of lead gamma, you\u2019ll be little bitch to my alpha. How will you like that, my little wolf? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Casey closed his eyes and drifted off to sleep with a smile on his lips and his cock hard and aching with need.</p><p>Nicky and Marco motioned to Rory from across the room. He didn\u2019t want to even be at this party. He knew Casey would be there, and Casey had ordered him to go to his room tonight. He\u2019d implied he would mate with him, and Rory was terrified. Not of Casey physically. He\u2019d face him and try to fight him off if he had to. No, he was terrified of his feelings for the handsome young wolf. He was so terribly drawn to him. The night before, when he\u2019d come to his room, Rory felt as if he were drowning in his passion and love. He hated to admit to anyone he was a virgin. Until Casey\u2019s mouth closed over him, his poor cock had known only his own hand. Casey was the first person he\u2019d ever been with in any sexual way. When Casey put his mouth on him, he\u2019d lost his free will, never wanting the feelings to stop. That loss of his will to resist was what frightened him. If Casey made love to him again, he might totally lose himself and fall headlong into submission to him. What he feared the most was the fact he didn\u2019t trust Casey to catch him if he fell. Sometimes when he gazed into his eyes, he saw emotions he didn\u2019t understand, almost as if Casey despised him yet loved him at the same time.</p><p>If he went to Marco for protection, he\u2019d probably give it to him, but what kind of man would he be to run to his uncle for help. No, he had to stand up to Casey and tell him firmly he was not interested in him as a mate. He had to look him straight in the eye and tell him to leave him alone, with no assurances Casey would abide by his wishes even if he believed him. He strongly suspected Casey was not going to take no for an answer. The best plan for him was to avoid him if at all possible. He\u2019d stay close to Marco and Nicky tonight and hope Casey would give up and go away. Maybe he was only postponing the inevitable, but he wanted a reprieve for just one night.</p> <p>Nicky had never looked more handsome and happy. He was dressed in a lovely white robe, the same robe he\u2019d worn for his ceremony to introduce him to the clan and proclaim him Marco\u2019s mate. He and Rory had a knock-down, drag-out argument about him wearing the robe at all. Rory remembered with a smile how Nicky had threatened to beat him up if he made him wear what he called a dress. Nicky thought it looked too girly. Marco had to force him wear it that night, and he really did look nice. He bet Nicky hadn\u2019t objected for their anniversary. He jumped up and gave Rory a hug as he came over to the table.</p><p>\u201cSit down, Rory, and tell me what\u2019s going on with you and Casey. You\u2019ve been avoiding me all day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t been avoiding you. I\u2019ve been busy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBusy doing what? Hiding in your room so Casey wouldn\u2019t see you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up, Nicky. Marco, tell him to shut his mouth, or I\u2019ll shut it for him.\u201d Marco rolled his eyes and pulled Nicky closer to him with an arm around his waist. \u201cWill</p> <p>you two stop fighting? Nicky, behave yourself. If Rory doesn\u2019t want to talk about Casey, he doesn\u2019t have to, though I believe Casey said he\u2019d be at the party tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho cares if he\u2019s at the party? I\u2019m not his mate, Marco, no matter how many times he says I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not the one you have to convince.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t look now, Rory, but tall, dark, and dominant just walked in the door, and he\u2019s headed</p><p>this way.\u201d Nicky gazed toward the door and laughed at the panicked expression on Rory\u2019s face. Casey, looking impossibly gorgeous and sexy, made his way with determination across the crowded room. Rory felt like a deer in the headlights, frozen as Casey held his gaze with his eyes, refusing to release him. Rory wrenched his gaze away at the last minute and tried to dodge out onto the dance floor, anywhere to avoid speaking to him, but he was too late. Casey snapped him back by his wrist and drew him into his arms, holding him there with a steely grip.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s dance, darlin\u2019. I believe they\u2019re playing our song.\u201d</p> <p>Both hands against his chest, Rory pushed. \u201cNo! I\u2019m not dancing with you. Stop it!\u201d He may as well have been pushing against a stone pillar for all the good it did. Casey drew</p><p>him inexorably out onto the floor, and unless Rory wanted to make a scene, bringing everyone\u2019s attention to what was going on, he had to go along with him. Dragging his feet, his face beet red, he hissed at Casey, \u201cYou\u2019re embarrassing me, as you well know. I don\u2019t dance with other wolves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you do now, sweetheart. If you\u2019d stop fighting me, you might even enjoy it. C\u2019mon baby, relax.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know even know how to do this!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, dance? Or dance with another man? Relax and I\u2019ll lead.\u201d He put both arms around Rory\u2019s waist. \u201cNow put your arms around my neck, baby. That\u2019s it. See? We\u2019re dancing.\u201d</p><p>Dancing might have been too elaborate a word for what they were doing, which was mostly standing in one place swaying a little to the music. Rory put his head down facing Casey\u2019s chest so he wouldn\u2019t have to see Nicky laughing at him, as he was sure he was. He found himself wanting to rest his head against Casey\u2019s chest, thinking it might be a very comfortable place to stay, and wished he might stay there for a very long time. Casey\u2019s closeness soothed something deep inside him.</p><p>As the music played on, Rory decided he\u2019d been missing out on something by never learning to dance. It was really quite nice. Casey began to move him across the floor, and Rory went along with him, still keeping his head down, letting himself relax and enjoy being close to Casey, even if for only a few minutes. Finally he raised his head and saw that Casey was moving him slowly to the outer edge of dancers, toward the dim recesses of the room.</p><p>\u201cOh no, you don\u2019t, Casey. I\u2019m not leaving here with you, so stop trying to pull me out of here.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cC\u2019mon, baby. You know you want to be alone with me. Just for a little while.\u201d Casey bent his head and put his lips beside Rory\u2019s ear, causing him to shiver deliciously. Rory pushed against him again though, and stopped moving anywhere.</p><p>\u201cNo! Let me go, Casey. You\u2019ve had your fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually I\u2019m just getting started, darlin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, fuck you, Casey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather fuck you, honey. Let\u2019s go to my room for a little while.\u201d</p><p>Rory stomped down on Casey\u2019s foot as hard as he could, taking him completely by surprise. The look on his face was almost comical, as he dropped his arms and stumbled back a few steps. Rory jerked away from him and took off across the dance floor, heading not toward Marco\u2019s table, but toward a large group standing by the buffet table. He arrived slightly out of breath, not daring to look back over his shoulder, uneasy at the thought of Casey\u2019s anger at his resistance. He grabbed a plate from the buffet and started down the line, dishing food onto his plate, but barely glancing to see what he\u2019d even selected.</p><p>Someone came up to stand at his elbow. Thinking it was Casey, he turned viciously to growl at him, but instead of Casey, a handsome young werekin named Chad stood there.</p><p>\u201cWhoa, dude! I was just coming over to say hello.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry, Chad. I thought you were someone else!\u201d Rory ducked his head in embarrassment. \u201cSomeone much more annoying. Sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Chad said warmly, putting his hand on Rory\u2019s arm. \u201cI saw you dancing with Casey. I never knew you liked boys before. I was wondering if you\u2019d dance with me?\u201d</p><p>Rory raised his gaze to say something kind, but dismissive. He didn\u2019t like boys. He just craved Casey, and he had to get him out of his system. When he glanced into Chad\u2019s eyes, they were so hopeful and sweet he didn\u2019t want to hurt his feelings. \u201cSure, Chad. I\u2019ll dance with you,\u201d he heard himself say. \u201cLet me eat a bite or two first, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. I\u2019ll sit with you while you eat if that\u2019s okay?\u201d</p><p>Rory shrugged and was about to make some kind of excuse when he saw Casey glaring across the room at Chad\u2019s hand still on his arm. A kind of thrill went through him. Casey was jealous, really jealous, from the look of fury on his face. Some perverse little demon took hold of him, and suddenly he wanted to make Casey miserably jealous. He wanted to make Casey just as uncomfortable and confused as Casey made him. He put his arm around Chad\u2019s shoulders and squeezed. \u201cSure you can, honey. Let\u2019s find a place to sit down.\u201d</p><p>He led Chad over to an empty table, feeling the waves of disapproval coming off Casey. They hit him in a palpable tide of anger and jealousy, spurring him on to do even more. When they arrived at the table, he pulled out the chair for Chad and even dropped a little kiss on his cheek. Chad blushed, evidently pleased at the attention.</p><p>He was a cute little thing, taking after his human mother in size, not much smaller than Rory. Until the recent changes instigated by Nicky, male pets, mated or unmated, were not permitted to wear shirts. Though now many had adapted to common clothes, Chad hadn\u2019t, showing off lean muscles across his shoulders and arms and a full expanse of smooth, tanned skin on his abs. He had very pretty brown eyes shining with excitement. A part of Rory felt guilty at the idea of leading him on. He really had no interest in anyone except Casey, but the temptation of irritating Casey was too great to allow him to stop. Sitting down beside the young man and scooting his chair up close, Rory ate a little, not really tasting anything, too aware of Casey glaring at them from across the room. Chad babbled about something the whole time. Rory paid little attention, just nodding occasionally to make him think he was.</p><p>When he finished, he pushed his plate back and stood up, offering his hand to Chad. \u201cLet\u2019s dance. I\u2019m not very good at it. In fact, I really can\u2019t dance at all. You may have to show me.\u201d</p><p>Chad jumped up eagerly, and the two of them went to the dance floor as a slow song started up. Chad put both his arms enthusiastically around Rory\u2019s neck and pushed his body up close, brushing his groin against Rory\u2019s. Rory blushed and almost pulled away, but he heard Casey growl from across the room. Rory glanced nervously over at him and saw Casey get to his feet and start their way. He wrapped both arms around Chad\u2019s waist and deliberately turned his back on Casey. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Rory bent down to kiss the side of Chad\u2019s neck, knowing it would enflame Casey even further, and sure enough, a big hand came down hard on his shoulder and ripped him away from the pet. Casey put himself between Rory and the confused and frightened boy, but said gently, \u201cSorry pet, this wolf is playing games with you. Please excuse us.\u201d</p><p>Chad ducked his head, mumbling, \u201cYes, sir,\u201d and moved quickly away, casting a glance back over his shoulder at Rory. Before Rory could react, Casey turned back to him, took him firmly by the arm, and proceeded to drag him outside.</p><p>The cool air hit Rory like a wake-up call as they stepped outside, and he shivered, half from the cold and half from the excitement of Casey being so responsive to jealousy and being so forceful. What had he been doing? He felt guilty for leading Chad on just to make Casey jealous, yet he could feel his cock hardening and his stomach fluttering like a bucket full of butterflies. Casey backed him up against the nearest wall and leaned over him, a hand on either side of his head.</p> <p>\u201cWhat the hell do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not doing anything. I was just dancing with a friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDancing with a friend, my ass. You two were practically making out on the dance floor. You belong to me, buddy, and you better get used to the idea.\u201d</p><p>Rory tried to push him away, but it was like trying to push a brick wall. \u201cLeave me alone! First you say I belong to you, whatever that means, and then you say I don\u2019t. Then you come to my room and\u2014damn it, I\u2019m not interested in you! And I\u2019m getting whiplash from your changing moods.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to leave you alone, so get used to it.\u201d Casey cupped Rory\u2019s balls through his jeans and squeezed. Rory yelped in surprise, not pain, and tried to pull away in embarrassment.</p> <p>Casey squeezed harder. \u201cStop struggling or you\u2019ll get hurt.\u201d</p><p>Rory gazed up into those green eyes, mesmerized by them. He stopped moving immediately and stood still, trembling all over, his cock throbbing.</p><p>\u201cGood boy. Now kiss me.\u201d</p><p>Rory had to stand on tiptoe to reach his lips, and Casey didn\u2019t bend an inch. Kissing Casey while he held his balls in a firm grip was definitely a different experience. He felt controlled and humiliated, but excited too, and his damn, traitorous dick got even harder.</p><p>Casey didn\u2019t kiss him back, just stood there while Rory pressed a chaste little kiss to his lips.</p><p>\u201cYou call that a kiss? I said, kiss me.\u201d</p> <p>Rory sighed and stood on tiptoe again, putting both arms around Casey\u2019s neck and pressing his lips firmly against Casey\u2019s. He tried his best to part Casey\u2019s lips with his tongue and nearly despaired before Casey relaxed the tension around his mouth and allowed him access. Rory swept his tongue over his lips and the inside of his mouth, ending with a little lick and a nibble on his lips. That wonderful smell of Casey\u2019s overpowered him again, and his knees sagged a little. Casey relented and put his free arm around Rory\u2019s waist, holding him up.</p><p>Casey broke the kiss, and when it was over, Rory slumped, trying to bury his nose in Casey\u2019s neck.</p><p>\u201cNo more dancing with other boys, you understand? Or girls either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>Casey gave his balls a little harder squeeze. \u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir,\u201d Rory whispered, another little thrill shooting through him.</p><p>\u201cNow you\u2019re coming with me to my room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d The idea of leaving with Casey scared Rory to death. He knew exactly what would happen if he went to Casey\u2019s room. The possible repercussions were too scary to deal with. Flirting and kissing were one thing, even Casey visiting him in his room, but to totally surrender to him was quite another. Even though Casey\u2019s aggressiveness gave him a thrill, something deep inside Rory warned that to surrender to him would mean the end of his life as he knew it. He had to be certain he could live with the results before he made that commitment. He wasn\u2019t quite ready to give himself over to someone else like that. He didn\u2019t know if he could do it, and he didn\u2019t trust Casey enough.</p> <p>Casey still held his balls, so he dropped straight down, tearing himself away. Surprised, Casey stepped back to help him up. Rory head butted him and staggered to his feet. He ran back inside as quickly as he could, not daring to look back to see if Casey was coming after him. He practically ran over to the buffet table, to try to lose himself in the crowd of people hovering around the table. After a few minutes of standing around, filling a plate with desserts he didn\u2019t even want, and listening to the inane chatter around him, his pulse returned to almost normal.</p><p>\u201cWell, did you get that out of your system?\u201d Nicky\u2019s voice was at his elbow, sounding amused.</p><p>\u201cLeave me alone, Nicky. I need to get out of here. Casey\u2019s beginning to get on my nerves.\u201d</p><p>Nicky leaned closer. \u201cThat dominance thing is really more for role-playing in the bedroom, and if you keep pushing him away, he\u2019s liable to really leave you alone. What would you do if you lost Casey?\u201d</p><p>Rory glanced up at Nicky in surprise. The idea of Casey breaking off his pursuit had never even occurred to him. The feeling of something like panic at the thought stunned him. They were bloodmates. He glanced around behind him quickly and when he couldn\u2019t locate Casey, butterflies went crazy in his belly again. He was beginning to really hate the stupid feeling.</p><p>\u201cHe came back in after you, but left when he saw you by the buffet table,\u201d Nicky told him. \u201cHe didn\u2019t look very happy, and...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wasn\u2019t alone. He grabbed one of the female pets standing near the door and took her along. He seemed pretty angry. If he were my mate, I\u2019d go after him.\u201d</p><p>Rory handed Nicky his plate. \u201cWill you take care of this for me, Nicky? I think I have something I have to do.\u201d He thrust the plate at Nicky without waiting for an answer and crossed hurriedly to the door. What the hell did Casey think he was doing? White hot jealousy gripped him as he went directly to Casey\u2019s room. He said no one would ever touch him but Casey. Well the same thing went for him. He was not going to fuck any pet. He could only be seconds ahead of him, and Rory was determined to get rid of the girl, and have this out with Casey once and for all. His earlier feeling of panic was gone. Casey was only giving him a dose of his own medicine, but it worked. He was furious at the thought of his mate with anybody else.</p><p>He caught Casey at the door to his room, leading the young, pretty pet inside. Rory caught her by the arm, twisting her gently around to face him. Casey turned in surprise.</p><p>Unconsciously, he used almost the same words Casey had used on Chad earlier. \u201cGo back to the common room. This wolf is playing games with you, and I need to talk to him.\u201d</p><p>The girl looked up in confusion at Casey, who leaned against the door frame, a smile playing around his lips. Keeping his gaze on Rory, he spoke to her softly. \u201cGo on, sweetheart. I do need to talk to Rory. Maybe I\u2019ll come find you later.\u201d</p><p>She dropped her head in disappointment and moved away down the corridor, glancing back over her shoulder at the two wolves standing close together in the doorway.</p><p>\u201cSo talk,\u201d Casey said provocatively. \u201cI thought you made it pretty clear you had no interest in me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know that\u2019s not true. I\u2019m confused, Casey, and you don\u2019t help me when you boss me around and act so tough, or when you force your way into my room and practically force me to have oral sex with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t force you, baby. I specifically remember you participating more than willingly, so don\u2019t play that shit with me. You\u2019re a grown man, and you know what you want. I simply showed you how much you wanted me, but you\u2019re too afraid to let it happen. I told you to come to me tonight, and now you have, so I think you want this as much as I do. Do you?\u201d</p><p>He pulled Rory into his arms and took control of his mouth, hard at first, grinding against his lips and then easing off some, licking and nipping at him. Rory relaxed into him, loving his body next to his. Casey pulled his head back and looked down into Rory\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cDo you want this, Rory? Be very sure, because there\u2019s no going back.\u201d</p><p>Rory took a deep breath, his shoulders slumping. \u201cYes, I want it. I\u2019m tired of fighting it\u2014 tired of fighting you. I\u2019m scared of losing myself, though, Casey. If I\u2014submit to you\u2014will you be there for me, help me keep myself? Will you do that?\u201d</p><p>Casey hesitated a fraction of a second too long, and Rory felt the unease sweep back over him again. Even so, his desire and the singing in his blood wouldn\u2019t let him back out. He loved Casey. Casey loved him. That was all that mattered. Together they could overcome any adjustments that needed to be made.</p><p>\u201cSure I will,\u201d Casey said confidently, smoothly.</p><p>Casey stood back, letting Rory go in first. Rory\u2019s gaze fell on the bed, and his throat tightened up a little. He was determined to see this thing through, though, and he turned to face Casey. Casey, who\u2019d been staring at him warily, got a look of grudging respect on his face. He began to unbutton his shirt.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should get out of those clothes, honey.\u201d</p><p>Rory nodded and pulled them off. Once he\u2019d decided to go through with this, he was anxious to begin, anxious to be mated with this big, beautiful wolf, and to see finally what would happen next. His biggest fear had been submitting himself to another wolf\u2019s dominance and power, fear that he would somehow not be a real wolf anymore, but some kind of hybrid pet. If that was to be his fate, he\u2019d have to embrace it. This crazy blood match had left him no easy choice, and he was tired of running from his fate in fear of the unknown. Casey\u2019s blood sang to his and that was really all that mattered in the end. Love had to be all that mattered.</p><p>He realized Casey would be dominant, had known from the beginning, but he also knew what Nicky said was true. Casey would belong to him every bit as much as he would belong to Casey. Rory didn\u2019t think Casey knew it yet, and it might be fun to teach him.</p><p>When he\u2019d stripped off his clothing, he waited for Casey to tell him what to do next. Casey was in charge for now, and Rory knew he loved every minute of it. Casey was gloriously naked, and for the first time, Rory saw Casey totally bare. He was big all over, that was for sure, and his erect cock was lovely, thick, and dark skinned, rising up out of curly dark hair and curving back toward his stomach. A dark blue vein throbbed down its length, and Rory thought he might want to explore that vein with his tongue. A graceful ridge curved at the tip and unable to stop himself, Rory bent over to sweep his tongue over the ridge. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Casey gasped and gripped Rory by the shoulders, pushing him to his knees in front of him. Rory didn\u2019t have any experience, but he knew instinctively what to do. He spent several minutes just kissing Casey\u2019s dick and fondling his heavy balls, spending some time kneading them with his hands and rubbing lightly with his fingernails. With long, slow sweeps of his tongue, he covered the length of Casey\u2019s shaft before coming to a stop at the tip, lavishing attention on it with kisses and little licks. Casey\u2019s hands fisted in his hair and his legs trembled, though he hadn\u2019t made a sound. Rory wanted badly to make him cry out as he had for him. He put his mouth down over the entire shaft, swallowing and sucking at it until it hit the back of his throat. He didn\u2019t gag though, and moved his mouth up and down the length slowly and sensuously, not quite deep-throating it, ending each journey back to the top with a swirling kiss, until Casey cried out, his hips pumped to fuck Rory\u2019s mouth.</p><p>\u201cOh God, Rory!\u201d</p><p>Rory smiled. He\u2019d made him call out his name after all. Rory turned back to his ministrations, but was suddenly hauled up off the floor and tossed on his back on the bed. Casey\u2019s voice was hoarse with emotion when he spoke to him.</p><p>\u201cTurn over, baby. Get up on your hands and knees.\u201d</p><p>Rory took a deep breath and then did as he was told, looking nervously back over his shoulder at the big wolf. Casey took a tube of lube out of a bedside drawer, but he caught the look from Rory and smiled.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be scared, baby. I don\u2019t want to hurt you. I\u2019ll take it as slow as I can.\u201d</p><p>Casey knelt behind him and caressed his ass, rubbing his cheeks in little concentric circles, massaging ever closer to his goal. Rory tried his best to relax, bracing himself for the cold lube on Casey\u2019s fingers. Instead, Casey spread his cheeks with the palms of his hands, and his soft lips kissed him there on his tight, puckered little hole. He gasped in surprise and flinched away, but Casey hooked a strong arm around his hips, holding him in place.</p><p>\u201cRelax, sweetheart. Let me love you.\u201d He sucked, licked, even nipped him a little.</p><p>Rory responded with deep groans of pleasure, his arms refusing to hold him up any longer. Falling, his head rested on the pillows, his ass still high in the air. Casey pushed several pillows under his stomach so he could lie down, relaxing further and still have his ass elevated.</p><p>A finger slick with lube, probed his tight virgin hole, sliding in and out in rhythm, deeper with each drive inside Rory. Stretching, rubbing, a second and then a third finger penetrated, keeping a slow rhythm until Rory thought he\u2019d go mad from the sensations. At the same time, Casey\u2019s other hand, slipped under him to caress his cock and rub his balls, his hands seeming to be everywhere at once. Rory shoved back his hips for more, unable to be still any longer.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t move until I tell you, honey. You could hurt yourself.\u201d Casey slapped his ass, not hard, but enough to let him know he wasn\u2019t in charge of any of this, and Rory struggled to hold still. Casey\u2019s hands in his hair pulled his head around, forcing him to look at him over his shoulder. \u201cI want you to see me fuck you, baby. I want you to know you belong to me.\u201d</p><p>Rory whimpered in need, pushing back when Casey rubbed the wet head of his cock at his stretched hole. Casey pushed his cock in past the ridge Rory had lavished attention on such a short time ago through the tight ring of muscles at Rory\u2019s entrance. It burned, and Rory held his breath against the pain.</p><p>\u201cShhh, baby. I know it hurts at first. Just try to relax. Push out a little, like you\u2019re bearing down, open up for me. That\u2019s it, sweetheart.\u201d Casey eased deeper inside an inch at time, holding still, letting Rory adjust by degrees to being stretched and filled. Buried all but a few inches to his balls, Casey waited again for Rory to relax, then pulled nearly out and drove into him, hard, fast, and deep.</p><p>Rory cried out, his body flailing to escape the impalement. Casey held him down, one hand planted in the middle of his back, and drove in again, touching something inside Rory with each new thrust to turn pain into an aching pleasure. An underlying groan escaped his lips as Casey thrust at him. With drive after drive following, Rory heard himself making hard, breathy sounds he\u2019d never heard himself make before. Casey\u2019s cock repeatedly touched the spot deep within him he didn\u2019t even know he had, feeling so damn good he thought he might die from the pleasure. Casey still had one hand in his hair, and Rory looked at him, holding his gaze. He whimpered, and Casey stilled for a moment, still throbbing deep inside him, out of breath, his eyes dark with need.</p><p>\u201cAre-are you okay, baby? Am I hurting you?\u201d Rory shook his head, but Casey gentled his movements and leaned over to kiss the back of Rory\u2019s neck. \u201cI love you, sweetheart,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>Rory whispered back, \u201cI love you too.\u201d</p><p>Casey moved again a little faster, until he seemed to get swept away and thrust harder and harder. As he hit that sweet spot inside Rory with each ram of his cock, Rory\u2019s climax built closer until he cried out against the intensity of the dam breaking, cum spurting from his cock onto the bed. Casey came at the same time, his hips ramming and holding for each pump from his sack.</p><p>As the waves of pleasure washing through him stilled, he went limp all over. Casey, incredibly, was still hard inside him. He slipped a finger in alongside his cock, pushing against Rory harder, pulling with his finger to stretch Rory open even more, forcing in the knot, the ring of flesh around the base of his cock that all wolves have.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re hurting me,\u201d Rory murmured, thinking all he had to do was tell Casey and Casey would stop, but he didn\u2019t. He held Rory to the bed with his chest and forced a second finger in on the opposite side of his cock. Rory struggled, trying to get away, but Casey\u2019s weight held him down, pulling his asshole up and out, pushing with his hips to work the knot in.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re tearing me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHush, baby. It\u2019s not tearing you. You can stretch to hold it. I know it hurts, but it\u2019ll feel good in a little while. Try to push out and back against me\u2014that\u2019s it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re ripping me open,\u201d Rory cried with a sob, arms and legs flailing in a hopeless attempt to break free. \u201cStop.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not ripping, baby, and I can\u2019t. I can\u2019t stop.\u201d Casey panted, driven by instincts of centuries and hormones gone wild.</p><p>He braced his feet on the bed, got two more fingers inside.</p><p>Rory wept and pleaded. \u201cStop, Casey, please, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I can\u2019t stop. I have to do this. I have to.\u201d He pulled out on the ring of tender flesh and rammed with the power of his legs at the same time, forcing the large knot of flesh inside, past the tight ring of muscles at his entrance which clamped tight behind it as soon as Casey pulled his fingers free.</p><p>Rory screamed. Impaled and totally helpless, painfully stretched and feeling as if his insides were crushed, Rory gasped out each breath. Even that little movement made the large gland wedged deep inside his body slide firmly against his prostate, setting off a second orgasm.</p><p>While Rory\u2019s body convulsed and he wept, Casey\u2019s canine teeth, extended the instant the knot was successfully buried, bit deep into the back of Rory\u2019s neck, sinking into his flesh with the mating bite.</p><p>The orgasm magnified. The intense pleasure coming from the bite coursing through Rory\u2019s blood intensified his orgasm until he thought his entire body was ripping apart. His back arched as he pushed up with his arms, driving his neck into the bite, wanting to never let go. One orgasm faded away. Another began, rolling waves of bliss that seemed to go on forever his body caught in spasms of ecstasy, and he clawed at the bed under him.</p><p>Casey, still covering him with his body to hold him down, still buried inside him, caught his wrists with his hands, soothing him, crooning loving words.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, baby. I couldn\u2019t stop. We had to finish.\u201d</p><p>After what seemed like forever, the orgasm tapered off, and Rory slumped on the pillows, not knowing if he\u2019d be able to survive another one. \u201cIt hurts, Casey.\u201d</p><p>Casey\u2019s dick and knot was still firmly lodged in his ass, and no amount of pulling or struggling would remove him. Struggling only made it worse, rubbing his prostate until incredibly, another orgasm came on.</p><p>Panicking, he screamed, and his scream turned into a howl as his body tried to shift. Helpless to prevent it, he sagged onto the bed, afraid suddenly of what his wolf would do to Casey when it emerged. He could tell it tried, and fought hard, but his wolf was trapped inside. Casey\u2019s gland pulsated inside him, secreting fluid that seeped out of his ass, dripped to his balls and soaked the bed, mixing with the cum of his multiple orgasms. He yelled out in rage and pain as his wolf retreated deep inside him, crying and whimpering in agony.</p><p>The mating was killing his wolf. Rory could feel it dying. He struggled desperately to get away, to pull the knot and cock out of his body. He only succeeded in bringing on another orgasm, ripping into him and twisting every muscle in his body. Milked dry and spent, he no longer spurted cum. His wolf surged one last time, trying to come out to protect him, but it fell back, defeated, vanquished, and crying helplessly. Rory wept in grief and helpless rage, as his wolf retreated deep down inside him, and he tried to howl his pain. It came out as an impotent cry.</p><p>\u201cPlease, Casey, please release me. My wolf.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, baby.\u201d He heard Casey\u2019s satisfaction in his ear. \u201cI couldn\u2019t even if I wanted to, and I don\u2019t. No more murdering little wolf for you. That\u2019s over. You belong to me now, pet.\u201d</p><p>Murdering wolf? What could he mean? Rory slumped in despair and felt the edges of darkness grow closer together, overwhelming him and pulling him under when yet another orgasm shook his body.</p><p>Reeling in and out of consciousness, Rory suffered from lethargy and weakness he\u2019d never known before and was barely aware of the fact Casey was no longer tied to him. He tried to raise his head from the pillow, but it fell back weakly. Something pressed against his lips, and he opened his eyes to see Casey, pushing his bleeding wrist against his mouth. Why was Casey feeding him his blood? He tried to turn his head away, but Casey wouldn\u2019t let him, gripping his hair and forcing his head still. \u201cFinal step of the mating, baby. Drink. You need my blood.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Rory drank, swept with a desire to do anything to please him. His blood tasted so delicious, he slurped greedily at it, closed his eyes, and sucked it down until Casey stopped him by inserting a finger into his mouth and breaking the suction. Rory sucked at his finger then, only stopping when Casey pulled it away with a little plop.</p><p>\u201cEnough for now, baby. You\u2019ll make yourself sick.\u201d</p><p>Casey sat back on his heels, looking down at him. He was still naked, and Rory reached for his beautiful cock, driving to hold it in his hands and guide it inside him. Casey pushed his hands away, smiling. \u201cYou\u2019re in heat, darlin\u2019. It won\u2019t last too long, but until it\u2019s over, you\u2019ll be dizzy and disoriented\u2014and pretty horny. I can\u2019t fuck you too much, or I\u2019ll make you too weak. How do you feel?\u201d He gazed down at him closely, looking for signs of distress.</p> <p>\u201cI-I feel...tired. Weak. I want you, though. Fuck me, Casey, make love to me. Please, Casey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will, baby, after you\u2019ve rested. You\u2019re not yourself right now. You need to sleep some, and I\u2019ll hold you while you sleep. We need to make love again soon to get you through the heat, but just not right now. It will soothe you some when we can do it again. Do you trust me to take care of you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yes,\u201d Rory said, reaching for him again. \u201cI trust you, darling. I love you so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you too, baby. You\u2019re mine now. You know that, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm-hmm. Come and hold me, Casey. I need you.\u201d</p> <p>Casey looked almost conflicted as he gazed down at him, but as Rory reached for him, he lay down beside him and gathered him closely in his arms, Casey\u2019s lips on the top of his head. Rory scooted his ass back into Casey\u2019s groin and pulled his arm tightly around him. Damn his ass hurt and his insides ached, but he still squirmed and twisted, seeking to drive Casey\u2019s cock deep inside him. He drifted off, soothed with Casey fondling his balls and kissing his neck.</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>Casey awoke to an insistent knocking on the door. Exhausted, having been up half the night making love to Rory, holding and fondling him, it took him a minute to come fully awake and realize what was going on.</p><p>\u201cOpen the door, Casey. It\u2019s Marco.\u201d He sat up, rubbing the sleep from his eyes, and pulled away from Rory. The knocking came again, harder this time. \u201cCasey! I know you\u2019re in there. Open the door!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay,\u201d he said irritably and got out of bed, picking up his jeans from the floor and pulling them on before going to open the door.</p><p>Marco stood there with his hands shoved in his pockets. \u201cIs Rory in there with you?\u201d</p> <p>Casey stood so his body blocked the door. \u201cYeah, he\u2019s in here.\u201d</p><p>Marco nodded tersely. \u201cI know you mated with him. Everyone in the compound does. Is he \u2014is he okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course he\u2019s okay. What did you think?\u201d</p><p>Marco looked up sharply at the tone, but Casey held his ground. Maybe it was time to let Marco know who he really was. Casey was an alpha too, and it had been hard taking orders all these weeks.</p><p>\u201cYou know what I mean, Casey. He was worried about what would happen if he mated with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, and he was right to be worried. I think his wolf is dead. Rory\u2019s changed now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Marco looked shocked. \u201cWhat do you mean he\u2019s changed? What happened? What did you do to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t do anything but mate with him. He tried to shift while we were tied up, after I\u2019d given him the mating bite. It didn\u2019t work, and he tried again. It retreated deep inside him and finally\u2014died, I think. Anyway, it\u2019s gone, but I didn\u2019t do anything but mate with him.\u201d</p> <p>Marco shook his head sadly. \u201cHe\u2019ll be devastated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s for the best. His wolf made him a murderer, and I\u2019m glad that little son-of-a-bitch is dead.\u201d</p><p>Stunned, Marco exclaimed, \u201cWhat are you talking about? How can you say such a thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s true! You asked me yesterday how I came to be with Shawna\u2019s pack. Well, it\u2019s time you know the truth. I was never with Shawna\u2019s pack, not really. I used them to get inside this compound. I\u2019m Alpha of the Sapphire Valley Wolf Pack. My brother was the man Rory killed last year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour brother! Your brother was the man who kidnapped Nicky?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. He was wrong in what he did, I admit, but he didn\u2019t deserve to die like that. Your people\u2014Rory\u2014killed him and left him on the side of the trail like garbage. Did you really expect he wouldn\u2019t be avenged by his family?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour brother kidnapped and would have raped my mate if we hadn\u2019t caught him, and he was going to kill him!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSays who? You have no proof of anything more than he took him. The truth is your mate wasn\u2019t harmed, not really, and you never waited to ask questions or talk to my brother. Rory attacked him before he could shift. He never had a chance, and you stood by and let it happen.\u201d</p><p>The two alphas stood and glared at each other for a long moment, both of their wolves close to the surface. They might even have shifted and fought it out right there in the hallway, except for a voice calling out behind them.</p><p>\u201cMarco! Casey! What are you doing?\u201d Nicky ran up beside Marco, and Marco instinctively pushed Nicky behind him, but he wouldn\u2019t stay put. \u201cStop it right now, both of you.\u201d Nicky put a hand on both their chests, holding them apart. Casey was so shocked at the sensation of Nicky\u2019s warm hand on his chest he jumped back out of the way. Nicky belonged to Marco, and universal pack law forbade him to touch another wolf\u2019s mate or be touched by one unless they were family. It was one of the oldest laws. The thought that Aaron had broken that law when he took Nicky flashed through Casey\u2019s mind. He ignored it, watching Marco pull Nicky roughly back from him, giving Casey a vicious look, even though it hadn\u2019t been his fault.</p><p>\u201cNicky, get out of here and let me deal with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t, Marco. Think of Rory. They\u2019re mated now.\u201d</p><p>The reminder made Marco back off a step, but the hatred and anger were still there.</p><p>Nicky worked to smooth the explosive situation. \u201cI could hear the two of you yelling all the way outside, and so could half the compound.\u201d Nicky turned to Casey and spoke gently to him. \u201cCasey, can I please see Rory? I know he\u2019s your mate now, but I just want to see him. I promise I won\u2019t get him upset.\u201d</p><p>Casey bit his lip in indecision, but Nicky stretched out a hand to him in supplication, careful not to touch him again. \u201cPlease, Casey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right. But just you\u2014not him!\u201d</p><p>Nicky pushed back against Marco\u2019s chest when he growled and would have charged Casey again and smiled up at Casey. \u201cThank you, Casey. Marco, please wait for me right here while I go check on him, okay? Please, darling.\u201d</p><p>Casey stepped back to allow Nicky inside. Nicky blew Marco a kiss as the door closed firmly in his face. He crossed over to the bed. Even sound asleep, Rory\u2019s hands grasped for Casey, and he moaned his name.</p><p>\u201cGod, he\u2019s pretty bad, isn\u2019t he?\u201d Nicky bent over and laid a hand on his forehead. \u201cHe\u2019s burning up, Casey. Are you sure he\u2019s okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think so,\u201d he said worriedly, putting a hand on Rory\u2019s head and smoothing back his hair. \u201cIt\u2019s not like I have a lot of experience in this either, you know. He woke up a little while ago, and he said he felt all right\u2014just dizzy and tired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I remember I felt that way, too, after I fed. If he\u2019s not out of this before tonight, you might call the doctor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll think about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard you and Marco shouting as I came inside. You said his wolf\u2014died\u2014inside him?\u201d \u201cYeah, I\u2019m pretty sure. That\u2019s what it felt like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat may be why he has such a fever. The doctor\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said I\u2019d think about it.\u201d</p><p>Nicky nodded, not pushing anymore. \u201cSo his wolf really might be dead. Poor Rory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to feel sorry for him. He\u2019s fine. He\u2019s perfect now that murdering wolf of his is gone. I\u2019ll take care of him. He\u2019s mine and under my control.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNicky, get back out here!\u201d A loud banging sounded on the door, and Marco\u2019s voice came through, sounding anxious.</p><p>Nicky shrugged and grinned. \u201cMy master\u2019s voice.\u201d Turning serious, he said, \u201cNow that you have a mate maybe you\u2019ll understand better how Marco felt when your brother took me and why Rory did what he did.\u201d He walked over to the door and opened it, stepping out and into Marco\u2019s arms.</p><p>Casey was momentarily stunned at the idea of someone taking Rory like Aaron took Nicky, but he quickly put that disloyal thought out of his mind and refused to listen. He stepped out behind Nicky. \u201cWe\u2019ll be leaving as soon as he\u2019s able to travel,\u201d Casey said, glaring at Marco.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you taking him?\u201d Marco demanded.</p><p>\u201cBack to my pack. They\u2019ve been without my guidance long enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t take him away from the only home he\u2019s ever known.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s mine now. He belongs with me in my home just like your mate does with you,\u201d he said pointedly.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t kill you for what you\u2019ve done, but I can stop you from taking your revenge out on Rory. You aren\u2019t going to hurt him.\u201d</p><p>Casey looked at him with disgust. \u201cHe\u2019s mine, and I\u2019ll do what I want to him. That\u2019s all you need to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWatch your mouth, asshole! You\u2019re on my turf now!\u201d Marco bristled visibly and acted like he would have attacked if Nicky hadn\u2019t stood between them. He settled for pointing a finger in Casey\u2019s face. \u201cYou won\u2019t leave here with him. Is that clear? If you try, I\u2019ll stop you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t keep me here against my will! My pack will attack you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, bring it! You\u2019re free to go any time you want to\u2014Rory is not going anywhere!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s my mate. I won\u2019t leave without him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you got a problem, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>The two alphas glared at each other, neither willing to give an inch.</p> <p>Casey stood for a long moment with his fists clenched before turning and going back into the room with Rory, slamming the door in Marco\u2019s face. Rory was still sound asleep. He slipped off his jeans and got into bed beside him, wrapping his arms around his waist and pulling his hot body up close to him. He kissed the side of his neck and trailed kisses down to his shoulder, giving it a little nip. Casey thought he\u2019d never be able to get enough of him. He put his hand over Rory\u2019s smooth penis, fingering the base, stunned by the lack of Rory\u2019s knot. It dissolved, was absorbed into his body, or something when they mated, or maybe when his wolf died. Either way his penis was no longer wolfish in shape, but like a human\u2019s or a pet\u2019s.</p><p>Mine, he thought possessively, stroking it tenderly. Rory moaned in his sleep. He thought about his words the night before and how prophetic they had been. No more wolf for you, baby. That\u2019s your punishment, sweetheart. He smiled to himself. Now I\u2019ve seen to it you\u2019ll never shift again.</p><p>He meant what he\u2019d said to Marco. He was glad Rory\u2019s wolf, the bestial, murderous part of him, was gone. Rory was different now, and his life would be changed forever. He loved Rory\u2014 he couldn\u2019t deny that. But he owed his brother some measure of revenge, and he had to see this through and not be weakened by his feelings for Rory. The first steps had been taken. Now he had to stay the course. Rory was no longer a wolf, but a pet, and his mate. Casey\u2019s natural dominant nature thrilled to the idea. He hadn\u2019t been able to kill Rory, but he\u2019d killed the wolf, and Rory belonged to him. Body and soul. Maybe he hadn\u2019t been honest with Rory and told him who he really was, but he hadn\u2019t lied when he said he\u2019d take care of him.</p><p>Nicky stared out the window at the coming storm. The clouds were gathering over the mountain, piling up on top of each other and competing to see which one could turn the darkest blue. The sky was taking on the strange, almost greenish hue that sometimes comes before a bad storm, and electricity seemed to crackle in the air. Marco tugged on his back pocket and pulled him down into his lap.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t stand by the window\u2014we\u2019re about to have a lightning storm.\u201d Nicky put his head down on Marco\u2019s shoulder. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, baby?\u201d Marco said softly. \u201cIs it Rory?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said with a sigh. \u201cI kind of miss him already.\u201d</p><p>Marco tightened his lips. \u201cHe\u2019s not gone anywhere yet. I\u2019ve given orders not to let them leave until I say so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t keep them here forever if Casey wants to leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWatch me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Marco, be serious. You never given much thought to the family I left behind when I became werekin. You only knew you had to have me, and I belonged with you. Rory\u2019s his mate now, and he gave himself to Casey willingly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnder false pretenses. Casey didn\u2019t tell him who he really was or what his intentions were.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe tried so hard to avoid this situation, and we kept telling him he had to face it. Now look what\u2019s happened.\u201d</p><p>Marco put a hand to Nicky\u2019s cheek. \u201cIt was a blood match, baby. I just wish I\u2019d discovered who he was before they mated. Rory would have had all the information at least and could have decided if he wanted to stay away from him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe still can if he has the strength to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s that strong. It took everything I had to stay away from you as long as I did. I couldn\u2019t have kept it up much longer.\u201d</p><p>Nicky gave him a kiss and stood to pace around the room. \u201cI need to talk to Casey again. I have to tell him about his brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you need to stay out of this and let me handle it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m involved in this too, Marco. I\u2019m the one his brother kidnapped, you know. I know what he told me and I saw his face. I know what he was planning to do to me, and if Casey understands that, he\u2019ll understand why Rory attacked him.\u201d</p><p>Marco blew out a strong breath. \u201cYes, but he didn\u2019t actually do more than kidnap you, Nicky. Casey was right. I never should have allowed Rory to attack him like that. I was just so damned enraged when he took you in the first place and then held the knife to your throat. I wanted to jump him myself, I guess. When Rory charged in, I should have stopped him. I knew he was young and inexperienced and in poor control of his wolf. It was my fault just as much as Rory\u2019s.\u201d</p> <p>Marco dropped his head into his hands, and Nicky quickly went to him, putting his hands on his shoulders, kneading them. \u201cWell, we can play the blame game all day, but it won\u2019t help, sweetheart.</p><p>\u201cI know. This is the last damn thing I needed. I\u2019m worried about this Hunter situation. We got word yesterday they\u2019re moving this way. Some of their scouts may already be in our area.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there anything we can do for Rory?\u201d Nicky asked softly.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019ll speak to some of the elders and look through some of the old books, but I doubt I\u2019ll find anything about this kind of situation. I\u2019ve never known of a blood match between wolves, but wolves must have bred with wolves in the early years. Casey said he sensed Rory\u2019s wolf was gone, so we just have to accept the idea. My issue is with Rory\u2019s state of mind. Can he accept this change? Can he accept the fact that Casey lied to him and wants to control him? You know how difficult it was for you and you weren\u2019t a wolf or even used to our ways.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Casey isn\u2019t doing it because of traditions. He\u2019s doing it to hurt him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t trust Casey not to physically abuse him, either. He wants to punish Rory for his brother\u2019s death. If he does, I swear I\u2019ll...\u201d</p><p>\u201cCasey loves him. I know he does, and he was worried about him too. Besides Casey said Rory\u2019s wolf is dead and the part of Rory he hates is gone. Once he fully realizes that, maybe there won\u2019t even be an issue. We have to give them time to work this out. Give Casey time to realize love is more important than revenge. In the meantime, is there anything you can do to keep them here without totally going to war with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have something in mind, but it depends on Casey and how willing he is to cooperate. He blames me as much as he does Rory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe likes me though,\u201d Nicky teased, batting his eyelashes to lighten the mood.</p><p>Marco smiled. \u201cEverybody likes you, baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? Everybody? So can I be the one to talk to Casey, Marco? You tell me what you have in mind and let me try to sell him on it.\u201d</p><p>Marco pulled him into his lap. \u201cHmm. And how exactly did you plan to \u2018sell him\u2019 on it, Nicky?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure. What do you think I should I do to win him over? Do you think I should flirt with him a bit? I don\u2019t really like boys except for you, sweetheart, but Casey is very good looking. Sexy too. I could make an exception I guess, just this once.\u201d</p><p>A hard swat on his backside got Nicky\u2019s attention. \u201cOw! What was that for? I was just asking your opinion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I was giving it to you. You don\u2019t flirt with anyone but me, Nicky. You got that?\u201d He ran his hands over Nicky\u2019s gorgeous body. \u201cThis is all mine, baby, and don\u2019t you ever forget it. As a matter of fact, maybe I should give you a little refresher course on just how much you belong to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm...my memory has been bad lately. Maybe a little memory jog would be good for me. Tell me again what I need to know.\u201d</p><p>Marco was so busy stripping off Nicky\u2019s pants, he didn\u2019t answer. Once he had him naked, he picked him up and settled him on his lap, straddling and facing him. He traced Nicky\u2019s muscled abs with his tongue.</p><p>\u201cOh God,\u201d Nicky whispered when Marco\u2019s tongue flicked over his nipple.</p><p>Marco licked down toward his navel. He slid out of the chair, never losing his grip on his mate and laid Nicky on his back on the carpeted floor. Wrapping his hand around Nicky\u2019s cock, he held it out of the way so he could tease Nicky around the base with his tongue and teeth. Nicky wiggled his hips, trying to get Marco to tighten his grip or move or do something more. Marco nipped the sensitive area between his groin and his thigh, and Nicky yelped.</p><p>\u201cBe still.\u201d</p><p>Hearing something in Marco\u2019s tone he hadn\u2019t expected, Nicky held himself rigid, watching Marco closely as he licked up the shaft of his cock to reach the slit in his cockhead. He stuck his tongue inside the slit, and Nicky bucked his hips and moaned loudly. Marco\u2019s finger penetrated his ass, searching for and finding his prostate. He pressed on it, and Nicky almost lost it, but just as he was about to come, Marco removed his finger, leaving him moaning in frustration. Marco was deliberately teasing him.</p><p>Marco took Nicky\u2019s pre-cum to lubricate them both, Nicky raised his knees to his shoulders, making it easier, and Marco plunged his cock into Nicky\u2019s ass. Nicky moaned his pleasure as Marco thrust gently into him, again and again, using his hands to stroke along his sides. The head of Marco\u2019s dick stroked Nicky\u2019s prostate, teasing and torturing him.</p><p>\u201cMake yourself come for me, baby. Put your hands on yourself and make yourself come.\u201d</p><p>Nicky opened his eyes and whimpered a little, but Marco was firm. \u201cDo it now, Nicky, while I watch you.\u201d</p><p>Nicky kept his eyes on Marco\u2019s as he slowly hooked his legs over Marco\u2019s broad shoulders and took his hard cock in hand. He pulled at it and at the same time Marco shifted his position.</p><p>\u201cYou need a lesson as well as a reminder, Nicky.\u201d</p><p>In that instant Nicky realized what he\u2019d sensed in Marco\u2019s actions. He had broken a pack law in touching a male who was not family. Marco was going to show him how much he belonged exclusively to him. Only on rare occasions did Marco impale him with his knot. Pain and pleasure awaited. Excited, knowing what was coming, Nicky pushed out hard, opening the ring of muscle clinging to Marco\u2019s cock. Marco put the strength of his legs and hips into the thrust, and the hard gland knot shot in, like having a small baseball shoved up his ass. Nicky yelped in pain. He could swear the knot grew just as his cock grew in his hands. Marco\u2019s hips flexed, grinding his knot against Nicky\u2019s prostate. Nicky stroked himself as he\u2019d been ordered to do, his hands and body jerking wildly. Marco watched his face, breathing hard, matching his strokes to Nicky\u2019s. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBite me, Marco,\u201d he screamed.</p><p>Nicky\u2019s orgasm seared its way through his body and as he began to spurt, he gave in to mindless pleasure, coming so hard when Marco\u2019s love bite clamped down on his throat he almost blacked out, and the room went dim around him. When Marco climaxed, seconds later, Nicky was hardly even aware of it for the waves of ecstasy shaking his body. When he came back to himself, Marco was kissing him all over his face and down his throat.</p><p>\u201cWho do you belong to, baby?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou and only you forever,\u201d Nicky said dazedly, already drifting off to sleep. He raised one eyelid. \u201cAnd what about you, Marco? Who do you belong to?\u201d</p><p>Marco smiled. \u201cYou, darling. Always and forever.\u201d</p><p>Nicky nodded, satisfied. \u201cGood,\u201d he said, and went contentedly back to sleep.</p><p>It was much later when Nicky rolled over and nuzzled Marco to wake him up. \u201cWe\u2019re still on the floor, babe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm-hmm.\u201d</p> <p>Nicky laughed and kissed him again. \u201cSo now that I\u2019ve had my refresher course, can I go see Casey?\u201d</p><p>Marco nodded, and Nicky leaned over for a kiss to seal the deal.</p><p>\u201cSo long as you\u2019re not totally alone with him. Leave the door open, and don\u2019t you dare touch him again. I have to protect my mate too, you know.\u201d He pulled Nicky closer, smiling over Nicky\u2019s little self-satisfied moans.</p><p>Nicky, of course, was thoroughly tempted to be bad, just to have to suffer his lesson again.</p><p>Rory woke up slowly, stretching like a cat. The bed was warm and cozy, and he could hear a storm raging outside the windows. He was a little sore and his backside was achy, but mostly he felt wonderful. He turned over to find Casey stretched on his back beside him, his arms thrown up over his head, and snoring gently with his mouth open. Smiling, he put a leg over Casey\u2019s and snuggled up close to him before to putting a finger under his chin and closing his mouth. Casey snorted and jumped, only half awake. His arms flailed in the air and Rory pushed them down. He pulled Casey closer, patting him. \u201cSettle down, baby, I\u2019m right here.\u201d</p><p>Coming more fully awake, Casey opened his eyes wider in surprise. \u201cRory!\u201d \u201cHi, baby,\u201d Rory smiled down at him.</p> <p>\u201cHi yourself. Are you...are you all right?\u201d Casey looked closely at him.</p><p>\u201cOf course I am. Why wouldn\u2019t I be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh...I don\u2019t know. You\u2019ve been kind of uh...in heat...for the past twenty-four hours or</p><p>so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have? In heat, huh? I don\u2019t remember a thing about it. The last thing I remember was you</p><p>were making love to me. We\u2019re mated now, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah. Definitely mated. We were tied up for hours. You sure you don\u2019t remember any</p><p>of it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, not a thing. Well, I do kind of remember your knot and didn\u2019t you feed me your blood</p><p>at one point?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Casey said slowly. \u201cSeveral times actually, trying to calm you. You were a little</p><p>upset.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d</p><p>Casey sat up and pulled some pillows behind him before pulling Rory up to settle him</p><p>against his arm. \u201cWhen we were making love...when you started to have the multiple orgasms</p><p>that the gland and bite bring on, you\u2014you tried to shift.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, and you couldn\u2019t. You tried a couple of times, and you weren\u2019t able to. Look down</p><p>at yourself.\u201d He pulled the sheet back to expose Rory\u2019s re-shaped penis. Rory looked down at</p><p>himself for a moment seemingly without comprehension and then his eyebrows raised almost</p><p>comically, and he looked back up at Casey. \u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour knot\u2014your gland is gone. Your penis is like a pet\u2019s now or a human\u2019s.\u201d Rory looked at him, not understanding. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess it happened when you tried to shift and couldn\u2019t or maybe because it was two</p><p>wolves mating. I\u2019m not sure, Rory, but your wolf is gone. I think it\u2019s dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Throwing back the covers, Rory jumped to his feet and ran into the bathroom to get</p><p>a look at himself in the mirror. He looked up in horror at Casey who was right on his heels.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you do to me?\u201d</p><p>Casey shrugged and shook his head. \u201cI didn\u2019t do anything. It just happened.\u201d \u201cOh my God, Casey! What does this mean?\u201d Even upset, Rory still stepped closer to Casey</p><p>to be comforted.</p><p>Casey put his arm around him. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Come back in here and sit down. We need to</p><p>talk about some things.\u201d</p><p>Rory followed him back to the bedroom as if in a daze. He sat on the bed, and Casey sat</p><p>beside him. The time had come to announce his revenge.</p><p>\u201cDo you remember almost a year ago when Nicky and another boy were kidnapped?\u201d Rory nodded. \u201cYes, of course. The other boy was my little brother, Adam.\u201d \u201cYour brother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. They were both in my charge that day, and I-I fell asleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou fell asleep?\u201d Casey looked at him in disbelief. This was the first time he\u2019d ever heard</p><p>about Rory watching the two boys. To fall asleep when pets were in your charge was pretty</p><p>unforgiveable. If Rory had been attentive, he and Aaron would never have been able to get their</p><p>hands on the boys to start with. His brother would never have been killed. Rory would never</p><p>have become his enemy.</p><p>\u201cYeah. I know. Marco almost took my head off for that one, but nobody could have blamed</p><p>me more than I blamed myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well the point is, Rory, the man who kidnapped your brother was me. And my</p><p>brother, Aaron, got Nicky.\u201d</p><p>Rory stared at him uncomprehendingly. \u201cI-I don\u2019t understand. How can that be?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not who you think I am, Rory. I\u2019m Alpha of the Sapphire Pack. Look, I\u2019ve got to just</p><p>come out and say this. I came to this compound for one reason\u2014to kill you.\u201d</p><p>Rory tilted his head slightly. \u201cK-kill me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know you, baby. I only knew your name, but you killed my brother, Rory. We have</p><p>to face the fact and find a way to move on. The man you attacked when you shifted was my</p><p>brother, Aaron. He never had a chance against you in your wolf form, and you had to know that.\u201d Rory was silent, still staring at Casey, looking as if someone had kicked him in the head. \u201cI-I</p><p>protected my alpha\u2019s mate. He was holding a knife to Nicky\u2019s throat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAaron told me he was going to negotiate with Marco. Wasn\u2019t that what he was doing?\u201d \u201cHe had a knife, Casey, at Nicky\u2019s throat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he hadn\u2019t hurt anybody.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat didn\u2019t mean he wasn\u2019t about to. I did what I thought I had to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t make it right.\u201d</p><p>Rory snapped out of his daze. \u201cYou\u2019re going to talk to me about what\u2019s right? The two of</p><p>you kidnapped my brother and Nicky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe quiet. Don\u2019t argue with me! I\u2019m trying to tell you I have these crazy mixed-up feelings</p><p>about you. I came here to kill you before I knew you were my bloodmate. I took a vow of vengeance against you. How in the hell am I going to reconcile that with wanting to fuck you</p><p>every time you come close to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck me, not make love to me? So you\u2019re saying you don\u2019t love me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, damn it! I do love you. That\u2019s what\u2019s tearing me apart. Suppose I\u2019d killed your little</p><p>brother that day. On purpose. How would you feel about me?\u201d</p><p>Rory shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s a totally different situation. My little brother was an innocent pet,</p><p>kidnapped away from his home. Your brother was a wolf who deliberately put himself into that</p><p>situation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was still my brother, and he didn\u2019t have to die like that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I guess I\u2019d have to try to forgive you then if it were me. If I couldn\u2019t, then I\u2019d reject</p><p>you as my mate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a chance,\u201d Casey said angrily. \u201cStop trying to get away from me. No, I can\u2019t let you</p><p>go, but you have to be punished. It\u2019s the only thing I can do to stay loyal to my brother.\u201d \u201cPunished? I\u2019m not your child, Casey. Or your prisoner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s exactly what you are. You\u2019ll do as I tell you to now, Rory. I\u2019m in charge, and it\u2019s</p><p>time you learned that and took your proper role in this relationship. Now be quiet and say yes sir</p><p>like a good pet.\u201d</p><p>Rory stood up abruptly. \u201cYou go to hell!\u201d He began to pace around the room still stark</p><p>naked.</p><p>Casey could see the anger in his face. He watched him carefully.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me to be quiet, like I\u2019m some kind of slave here. You tell me you\u2019re an alpha</p><p>who came here to avenge your brother\u2019s death, that you\u2019re the man who kidnapped my brother,</p><p>and oh yeah, you came here to kill me. And I\u2019m supposed to do what? Kneel down and present</p><p>my throat for you to rip out? Or just kneel down and kiss your ass? Or maybe give you mine?\u201d \u201cShut up, Rory, I\u2019m warning you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWarning me? What\u2019s your plan, Casey? Gonna kill me now?\u201d</p><p>Casey lunged up, crossing the room, hand out toward Rory\u2019s throat. \u201cShut up, Rory!\u201d Rory knocked his hand away. \u201cNo! I won\u2019t shut up. I\u2019m leaving!\u201d He turned looked for his</p><p>clothes, swaying a little. \u201cWhere are my clothes?\u201d</p><p>Casey pointed. Rory went over to the chair and held up a pair of the traditional leather pants</p><p>worn by pets before the rules had been relaxed. \u201cI\u2019m not wearing these!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can stay naked if you like. Suits me just fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what I mean! I won\u2019t wear these to go out!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho said you were going anywhere?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Rory threw the pants down on the floor and stood with his arms folded across his chest.</p><p>Casey lunged up, pulled back his arm and dealt a hard blow to Rory\u2019s butt.

Then I\u2019ll put them on you myself.\u201d</p><p>Rory, still in shock, glared at him, saying nothing.</p><p>Cody picked up a collar from the table. \u201cCome here.\u201d Casey crooked his finger at him.</p><p>\u201cNext we\u2019ll take a little trip downstairs to have some of that hair taken off your chest, legs, and</p><p>other places.\u201d</p><p>Rory stared at the collar and shook his head.</p> <p>\u201cEveryone is going to know your murdering wolf is gone and that you are my property, my</p><p>pet, doing only what I allow you to do.\u201d</p><p>Rory\u2019s face drained of all color. \u201cGod, you really hate me, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Casey tightened his lips, and he stared straight into Rory\u2019s eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re my mate, Rory. I</p><p>can\u2019t hate you, damn it! And I couldn\u2019t kill you if I wanted to. But humiliation\u2014it won\u2019t physically harm you, but it will hurt. I can do that much at least for my brother. From now on, you\u2019ll submit to me totally. No more wolf for you. You\u2019re a pet now\u2014dress the part. Get used to</p><p>it!\u201d</p><p>Rory shook his head in disbelief. \u201cNo. No, I won\u2019t let you do this to me. If you do this, if</p><p>you try to humiliate me like this, I\u2019ll end up despising you. Is that really what you want?\u201d Casey gripped tight Rory\u2019s arm. \u201cShut up, Rory, and take orders. You\u2019re my property! My</p> <p>boy! You\u2019ll do what I say, when I say. Is that understood?\u201d</p><p>Rory glared at him. \u201cOh yeah, it\u2019s understood. Now understand this. I may not be a shifter</p><p>anymore, but I\u2019m still a wolf, lead gamma of the Dark Hollow Wolf Pack. You can beat me up,</p><p>\u2019cause you\u2019re bigger and stronger than I am. You can feed me your damn blood until I\u2019m</p><p>drugged with it, and you can rape me if you want to. But it will be rape from now on, Casey,</p><p>make no mistake about it. I\u2019ll never submit to you willingly again. I reject you as my mate. Do</p><p>you understand? I reject you! We\u2019re through!\u201d</p><p>Casey pushed him roughly onto the bed, ripped the blanket off, and fell on him. \u201cBullshit! I</p><p>won\u2019t allow that. You\u2019ll do as you\u2019re told!\u201d</p><p>Rory pushed back against his chest. \u201cOh no, I won\u2019t!\u201d</p><p>As they struggled, an insistent knocking made the door shudder in its frame, and Marco\u2019s</p><p>voice rang out. \u201cRory, Casey, I know you\u2019re in there. What\u2019s going on? Let me speak to Rory.</p><p>Open the damned door!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHelp me, Marco!\u201d Rory\u2019s voice called out before Casey could stop him. A bare second's</p><p>hesitation passed before the door burst open. Marco took one look at what was going on and</p><p>grabbed Casey from behind. Hauling him up and off Rory, he flung him across the room. Marco</p><p>turned and reached a hand out to Rory, but Casey jumped up off the floor and was on him. They</p><p>crashed around the room, their powerful, muscular bodies breaking up the furniture and making a</p><p>wreck of everything.</p><p>Chapter Four</p><p>Rory jumped off the bed and to his feet. \u201cStop! Please stop! You\u2019ll kill each other!\u201d The loud crashing and sounds of yelling soon drew others crowding into the room, trying to pull the two furious wolves apart. Rory grabbed the blanket from the bed to wrap around himself and fell back miserably on the bed. He shivered under his blanket, rocking back and forth, eyes tightly closed, waiting for it all to be over. His emotions were ripping him apart. Devastated by Casey\u2019s betrayal and furious with him, he didn\u2019t want to care about him, wanted him punished for what he\u2019d done. At the same time he couldn\u2019t help loving him and was terrified Casey would be hurt. Strong hands on his shoulders lifted him to his feet. He opened his eyes to see the kind face of Marco\u2019s beta, Ian.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get you out of here, son, until these two get it all worked out.\u201d Ian pushed him gently from the room, and Rory glanced back over his shoulder to see a pile of bodies on the floor. Instinctively, he knew Casey was on the bottom, and he tried to turn and go back to him. Ian tugged him away.</p><p>\u201cThey won\u2019t really hurt him. They\u2019re only holding him down. He just needs to cool off, and so does Marco. Let that happen and you can see him later. C\u2019mon, Rory, come with me.\u201d</p><p>Rory allowed Ian to draw him away and down the hall, and he\u2019d almost made it safely away when he heard the howl of a wolf. Bloodcurdling, and lonely and full of heartbreak, he knew it had to be Casey. The sound called Rory back as clearly as if it had been calling his name. Out of Rory\u2019s throat came a weak answering howl, and his wolf stirred somewhere deep inside him. Ian steered him gently down the hall to his suite of rooms.</p><p>Ian must have known he wasn\u2019t really cold\u2014the shaking was no more than reaction to all that had happened in the last forty-eight hours or so. He sat Rory down on the sofa and made him a cup of hot chocolate. Rory tried to calm down and make sense of what was happening.</p><p>Ian sat quietly beside him on a sofa. The room was neat and orderly, like Ian, and had a restful quality to it. Ian\u2019s wife had decorated the room not long before she died. Rory began to relax ever so slightly.</p><p>\u201cHow are you feeling, son? Any better?\u201d</p><p>Rory nodded, still frowning. \u201cI guess so. I\u2019m worried sick about Casey though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to see him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo\u2014yes.\u201d Rory looked up, his eyes shining with tears. \u201cNo\u2014hell, I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m so confused.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you confused about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love him so much\u2014I can\u2019t help it. To me, he\u2019s the most handsome, most sexy man I\u2019ve ever met. When he...when we...you know...I can\u2019t get enough of him.\u201d Rory blushed furiously, He\u2019d been a virgin, and Casey had blown his mind with his lovemaking. \u201cBut if his blood would let him, he\u2019d kill me. I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll ever feel any differently. All he really wants to do is hurt me. How can we have a life together? How can I live like that?\u201d</p><p>Nothing seemed to rock Ian. He listened without looking shocked. Rory guessed as loud as they were yelling everyone already knew what was going on.</p><p>Ian said, \u201cAt least you love him, and it sounds like he has very strong feelings for you, even if he\u2019s really mixed up right now.\u201d</p><p>Rory set down his cup and leaned his head back on the sofa. \u201cI thought so too, in the beginning, before he told me why he came here. He came here to k-kill me, because I killed his brother last year, the man who kidnapped my brother and Nicky. Finding out I was his bloodmate must have freaked him out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas he hurt you, Rory? Tell me the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really. He did hit me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe hit you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, on the butt. He said it was a spanking, but he forgets how strong he is. It was only once. What really bothered me was what he said afterward. He said he wanted to humiliate me by making me wear the leather pants and collar pets wear so everybody would know I was not a wolf anymore, nothing but a weak pet with no mind of my own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would he say you aren\u2019t a wolf anymore?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s because of my...you know...my private parts. They look more like a human pet\u2019s than a wolf\u2019s.\u201d When Ian still looked puzzled, Rory whispered, \u201cNo knot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat may to be a result of a wolf mating a wolf, nature\u2019s way of ensuring there is only one dominant when both are male. Since Casey is alpha and you\u2019re gamma, it would naturally be him anyway.\u201d He considered that for a moment longer before asking, \u201cHow do you feel about having Casey dominate you?\u201d</p><p>Rory sighed and admitted, \u201cIn a way, I don\u2019t really mind that part of it. I\u2019ve never been as muscular and tall as the other wolves. After all, you\u2019re right. He is an alpha. I\u2019d owe him my obedience and allegiance anyway. When I was growing up, for a long time my parents thought I might be a pet. I never minded the idea, but when my wolf matured, I didn\u2019t want to let Marco down. He\u2019s really tried to help me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarco wants you to be happy, Rory. That\u2019s all. You\u2019ve got a strange idea about pets. There\u2019s absolutely no shame involved in being one. They\u2019re precious to us. We cherish our pets, and not because we just want someone to control. A wolf\u2019s nature is to dominate. They\u2019re like our other halves. Yin to our yang, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know that, but it\u2019s a whole different mindset for me. I\u2019ve always been wolf, and even if my knot is gone, I still feel wolf. I don\u2019t know if I could be submissive, depending on him for everything, and I know I can\u2019t be the way Casey says he\u2019s going to force me to be. I can\u2019t trust him either. He lied to me.\u201d Tears welled up in his eyes again to embarrass him even though Ian ignored them.</p><p>\u201cI think we wolves flatter ourselves with the notion our pets are totally dependent on us. My pet was the strongest, smartest woman I ever knew. She couldn\u2019t shift, but she had me to do that for her. I worked for her, Rory, not the other way around. We\u2019d be nothing but animals without them. They truly are our better halves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut we discipline them and make them mind us and wear collars on their necks.\u201d</p><p>Ian smiled gently. \u201cYou\u2019re very young, Rory. Most of that is sex play. They allow us to do that, don\u2019t you see? What are we going to do to them if they say no? We can\u2019t hurt them\u2014it goes totally against our nature. They could totally dominate us if they wanted to. No, they enjoy being taken care of and pampered, and in return they let us pretend we control them. Who goes out and works every day in the cold and rain while the other one stays at home and drinks coffee and reads magazines? Who\u2019s really in charge? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNot everyone likes it, obviously. The collar is no more than a mark of ownership they allow us to put on them. We\u2019re very jealous of our pets, because we love them so much, and we need them so much. If they left us, we\u2019d die. Wolves are dominants by nature, so we need submissives as our ideal partners. We complete each other, and the dominance is a part of that, but it\u2019s not real, Rory. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKind of, I guess. If it was just sex play like when he spanked me, I could stand it. I might even like it a little, but Casey wants to strip me of everything. He wants to punish me. He said so.\u201d</p><p>Ian shrugged. \u201cMaybe he does, a little. He has whole other issues with you. He\u2019s trying to punish you because he blames you for his brother\u2019s death. I think I need to speak to Casey to make sure of his intentions. It sounds like he might be confused himself. And you need to get the idea that being a submissive is shameful out of your head. Some of the strongest people I know are submissives. Look at Nicky.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTrue.\u201d Rory shrugged. \u201cHe really does run Marco, doesn\u2019t he, but Marco lets him and allows him freedom to be himself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNicky lets Marco think he gives him freedoms. It\u2019s all a kind of game, Rory. Nicky does whatever he pleases, and he and Marco both know it. It just took Nicky a little time to catch on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat isn\u2019t what Casey plans on.\u201d Rory sighed and glanced up at the clock on the wall in worry. \u201cWhere\u2019s Casey? I want to see him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure that\u2019s a good idea?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s my blood match. I think I have to be with him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, Rory, you don\u2019t have to be\u2014not if you don\u2019t want to be, or if the two of you can\u2019t work things out. I know some of the others have said you can\u2019t fight it, that you can\u2019t live without him. It is possible to live without your true mate, even if it\u2019s hard. Unfortunately, I know that for sure.\u201d</p><p>Rory dropped his gaze, remembering how terribly the beta had grieved for his mate after she died. The entire pack had mourned along with him and had been upset by his inconsolable grief.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how you do it,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>Ian shrugged. \u201cYou do what you have to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to stay away from him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNicky did until Marco gave in and realized he had to make the changes. If you feel as strongly about the total submission, and Casey can\u2019t accept that, you can too. If you and Casey can\u2019t work it out, it doesn\u2019t mean you have to be alone forever. You can love someone again\u2014it may not be a blood match, but you can fall in love. Maybe even deeply in love.\u201d</p> <p>Rory shook his head firmly. \u201cThere\u2019s no one else like Casey. I still want him. I just don\u2019t know if I can forgive him for wanting to deliberately hurt me, Ian. He doesn\u2019t mean his dominance as any kind of love play. He means it to hurt me. He hates me.\u201d</p><p>Rory couldn\u2019t help it; his eyes filled with tears. Ian nodded. \u201cAll right. Let me see what I can do. If that\u2019s true, you need to know it now, so you can walk away.\u201d He went over to the phone, dialed a number and spoke softly into the receiver for a few moments. \u201cMarco\u2019s bringing him. Rory, are you sure about this? He hasn\u2019t changed, you know. He\u2019s the same Casey he was a little while ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I still need to talk to him. I said some things I maybe shouldn\u2019t have because I was so hurt and angry. Now that the shock\u2019s over, maybe we can talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve never had a pairing like this before, Rory\u2014two wolves. We don\u2019t know exactly what it means for the two of you even without the added issue of his vengeance for his brother. Do you think your wolf is really gone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did at first, but a while ago, when I heard Casey howl, I felt something. I wanted to shift and go to him. I don\u2019t know if I could have or not. I think maybe if I needed to shift\u2014to protect my mate or for some other really good reason\u2014I think I might be able to.\u201d</p><p>Ian patted his hand. \u201cI heard your howl. For now though, I suggest you keep that to yourself.\u201d</p><p>Marco opened the door and pushed Casey into the room in front of him. Casey\u2019s hands were tied in front of him, and his face was flushed with anger. His eyes searched the room for Rory, and he seemed to relax a bit when he saw him sitting on the couch.</p><p>Rory got up immediately and went to stand by him, appealing to Marco. \u201cPlease, Marco, untie him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, not until I find out exactly what\u2019s going on. Sit down, both of you.\u201d Marco shoved Casey, and Casey turned to snarl at him.</p><p>Rory took his arm. \u201cPlease, Casey. Sit down with me.\u201d</p><p>Casey pulled away from Rory\u2019s touch, but allowed him to sit beside him on the sofa. He was sullen and furious, his face bruised high on his cheekbone. He glared up at Marco. \u201cWhen I get my hands free, we\u2019ll finish this, Alpha.\u201d</p><p>Marco laughed shortly. \u201cYou\u2019re already finished. The only reason I haven\u2019t thrown you in a jail cell already is because of Rory, and I still might.\u201d</p><p>Ian came over to stand beside his alpha. \u201cRory says he hasn\u2019t been abused. I\u2019d like to talk to Casey about the way he\u2019s seeing things, but not now, I think it\u2019s best if everyone calms down tonight and gets some rest. We can talk in the morning.\u201d</p><p>Marco hesitated, looking doubtful, perhaps still caught up in his anger. Ian put a hand on his shoulder. \u201cGo on to your suite, Marco. You know Nicky will be dying to find out what\u2019s going on.</p><p>Nicky was everybody\u2019s favorite around the compound, because of his beauty, his quirky charm, and his courage in forcing Marco into making changes for all the pets. At the mention of his name, Marco seemed anxious to go, but he still hesitated in leaving Rory.</p><p>\u201cWhat about sleeping arrangements for the night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRory belongs to me. He stays where I stay,\u201d Casey stated in challenge and frowned at Marco belligerently.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not up to you, you son-of-a-bitch!\u201d Marco took a step toward him, and Casey tried to get up off the couch but Rory pulled him back.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll stay with him, Marco. We need to talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey can stay here tonight in my other bedroom if that\u2019s okay, Marco. You can post a guard outside if it will make you feel better about it.\u201d</p><p>Marco nodded. \u201cI will.\u201d He looked at Rory. \u201cAre you sure this is what you want? If you don\u2019t want to stay with him, you can go to your own room or I\u2019ll take you with me.\u201d</p><p>Casey made a move as if to jump up off the couch again, but Rory put a restraining hand on his arm. \u201cI\u2019ll stay with Casey,\u201d he said.</p><p>Marco nodded and left, casting Casey a warning look and closing the door firmly behind him.</p><p>\u201cMy other bedroom is through there,\u201d Ian said, \u201calong with the adjoining bathroom. Fresh towels are in the closet. If you need anything else, let me know.\u201d He yawned behind his hand. \u201cI\u2019m going to bed, but make yourselves at home.\u201d He bent over and untied Casey\u2019s hands and smiling at both of them, turned to go to his bedroom.</p><p>Casey got up without another word and stalked off to the bedroom, not even looking back to see if Rory followed him. He threw himself on the bed and lay on his back, his chest heaving with emotion. Rory came hesitantly into the bedroom and stood in the doorway. Casey glanced over at him.</p><p>\u201cOh, you\u2019re actually coming in here with me, huh? I\u2019m surprised. I thought you rejected me as your mate. You said we were through.\u201d His voice was angry and bitter.</p><p>\u201cYou hurt me, Casey. You meant to, and I-I was mad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, no matter how mad I was, I\u2019d never reject you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t?\u201d Casey came further into the room, easing the door closed behind him.</p><p>\u201cNo, and I wouldn\u2019t call out for help to get away from you, or go off and leave you when you were being attacked by a bunch of big jerks either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid they hurt you?\u201d</p><p>Casey made a dismissive sound with his lips. \u201cOf course not.\u201d</p><p>Rory perched on the bed next to him, ready to run if Casey made any threatening moves. He reached out to touch the bruise on Casey\u2019s cheek, half thinking he would pull away, but Casey lay still and allowed him to rub his fingers gently over it. Rory was shocked to see tears forming in his beautiful green eyes. They didn\u2019t spill out onto his cheeks, but glistened in the dim light.</p><p>This wasn\u2019t Casey\u2019s pack, and he was an outsider here. It must have been frightening for him to have been held down by so many of the other wolves, no matter what he said. Especially since his mate had just rejected him.</p><p>Knowing Casey\u2019s pride, Rory knew he had to make the first move. Rory took Casey\u2019s hand in his, heartened by the fact he didn\u2019t jerk it away. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean it about rejecting you. I love you, but I can\u2019t live like you said I would have to, and I can\u2019t stand the idea of you hurting me for revenge. I don\u2019t want to start hating you. I\u2019m sorry about your brother, but what he did was wrong. When I attacked him, he was holding a knife to Nicky\u2019s throat, making him bleed. I found out later, he told Nicky he was going to rape him and had the hard on to prove it. I\u2019m sorry that it hurt you, baby. If we can forgive each other, I think we can be happy.\u201d</p><p>Casey glanced up at him, but still stayed silent. Rory didn\u2019t know what the silence signified, but Casey hadn\u2019t shoved him away. Taking the silence as agreement or at least understanding, hoping he wasn\u2019t suffering from a bad case of wishful thinking, Rory bent down and kissed the bruise on Casey\u2019s face. He trailed kisses down to his lips. Casey didn\u2019t pull away, encouraging Rory to gently lick at his lips until they fell open slightly. He pushed the tip of his tongue inside Casey\u2019s mouth ever so slightly, running his tongue over his teeth and just touching Casey\u2019s tongue gently. Casey\u2019s mouth fell open a little more. Rory swept his tongue over the inside of Casey\u2019s mouth, ending with a teasing little nip at his lower lip.</p><p>Rory whispered against his mouth. \u201cCan you forgive me for saying I rejected you? I really... really...really...didn\u2019t mean it.\u201d Each really was punctuated by a soft little lick on Casey\u2019s lips. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Casey groaned, pulled him into his arms, and rolled Rory beneath him. He stretched out on top of Rory and ground his cock into his as he kissed him thoroughly. His hands strayed down to part the blanket and give him access to Rory\u2019s still naked body. He ran his hands over it possessively and pushed both hands under Rory\u2019s ass, holding him firmly beneath him.</p><p>\u201cI love you too,\u201d he whispered against his mouth. \u201cI went a little crazy when you said you were leaving me. I didn\u2019t mean to hit you so hard. I\u2019m sorry, and I\u2019ll never do it again. When you did walk out and Marco kept me away from you, I thought I might never see you again, baby. I couldn\u2019t have stood that. I would have gone crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re together now.\u201d</p> <p>Casey shuddered and together they pulled at his clothes. Once his skin was gloriously bare, Rory kissed every inch of it he could get to while pinned down again so completely. Breathing hard, Casey looked desperately around the room. \u201cLube?\u201d</p><p>Rory smiled happily. \u201cCheck the bedside drawer. Knowing Ian, he thought of everything.\u201d</p><p>Casey reached across to it and eagerly grabbed the new tube lying inside the drawer. Ian had, indeed, anticipated their needs. Casey got on his knees and squeezed some on his fingers. Keeping eye contact with Rory, whose legs fell open for him, he gently prepared him, stretching with his fingers and smoothing it deep inside Rory\u2019s still tender ass.</p><p>Casey leaned down between Rory\u2019s spread legs to kiss the tip of Rory\u2019s cock and when it responded enthusiastically by rising even farther up to stand against Rory\u2019s stomach, he put his mouth over the length, taking him in all the way to the bottom of his shaft, then slowly sliding his mouth up and down until Rory moaned and twisted beneath him. He finished with a swirling kiss to the tip before he pulled Rory\u2019s legs up over his shoulders.</p><p>\u201cI want to see you when I\u2019m loving you,\u201d he whispered to Rory, and Rory nodded, unable to speak.</p> <p>He positioned the tip of his cock at Rory\u2019s entrance, slid in slowly, pausing to see if Rory showed discomfort before gently pressing in farther. When he had filled him completely, he bent to kiss his nipples, licking at them and teasing with his tongue.</p><p>\u201cOh God,\u201d Rory groaned. \u201cCasey, I love you so much.\u201d</p><p>Casey moved, seeking the spot deep inside that would drive Rory crazy and when he found it, Rory gasped aloud.</p><p>Casey smiled and teased some more with his cock. \u201cThere, baby? Right there?\u201d</p><p>Rory came, spurting cum hard against his and Casey\u2019s chests. Casey followed him seconds later, adding his groans to Rory\u2019s. Finally they lay together, happily spent and breathing hard. Casey let himself soften inside Rory before he rose and went to the bathroom to clean himself. He brought a warm cloth back for Rory and tenderly wiped him clean as he lay exhausted on the bed. Finished, he got into bed and turned Rory on his side to spoon him and cradle him in his arms.</p><p>He whispered softly, \u201cI love you, Rory. I\u2019ll never stop loving you. I can\u2019t do what I said. I knew I couldn\u2019t keep hurting you when you walked out of that room. If I\u2019d lost you, I\u2019d have lost everything.\u201d</p> <p>Rory heard him, but was too sleepy to do more than murmur unintelligibly back at him before sinking down into his dreams.</p><p>Chapter Five</p><p>Casey woke up slowly, comfortable with Rory\u2019s sweet, little body close to his. Someone knocked insistently on the bedroom door. \u201cCasey? Rory? I\u2019ve cooked breakfast for us. Come out when you\u2019re ready.\u201d</p><p>Leaving Rory sleeping soundly, Casey went into the bathroom to pee and splash water on his face. He put on his jeans and T-shirt and padded softly out to the kitchen, where Ian was already drinking a cup of coffee and buttering a piece of toast.</p><p>\u201cI hope you like sausage and eggs.\u201d Ian spread some blackberry jam on his toast and took a big bite.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m starving.\u201d Casey sat down to eat, motioning over his shoulder at the bedroom. \u201cRory\u2019s still asleep. He hadn\u2019t had a chance to recover from the mating and being in heat before all this started.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll save him some. Actually, I wanted to talk to you anyway before Marco comes over to question you both.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, Marco again? I\u2019m gonna punch his lights out before this is over.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know you two don\u2019t get along, but Marco is Rory\u2019s uncle, don\u2019t forget, and he\u2019s practically raised him since his father died. He loves Rory, just like you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot just like I do. Nobody loves him as much as I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, I stand corrected, but you understand what I mean. He does love Rory and wants him to be happy. If he finds happiness with you, fine, but if not...\u201d</p><p>\u201cRory\u2019s happy. I keep him well satisfied.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no doubt you\u2019ll keep him sexually satisfied, but are you capable of giving him the other things he needs to be happy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have to forgive him for your brother and end your quest for revenge.\u201d \u201cRory\u2019s wolf killed him, and now the wolf is dead.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cEnd of problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat isn\u2019t what you told him, and mental abuse is as cruel as physical. Rory\u2019s wolf may have died physically, but he\u2019s still wolf in his mind. He isn\u2019t a pet and shouldn\u2019t be treated or exhibited as such.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s over with. I told him I was wrong, and I meant it.\u201d</p><p>Ian nodded and moved away from the subject. \u201cWolves are all dominants\u2014some more than others, though. You\u2019re obviously an alpha, and I suspect, like myself, you are the type who likes the dominant lifestyle domestically, and plays it, shall we say, a little rough in the bedroom.\u201d</p><p>Casey flushed. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t abuse him, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re getting at.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe not intentionally. Playing the dominant may not be new to you, but being a submissive in any way is to Rory. That swat you gave him, hurt him. Sometimes we don\u2019t realize our own strength. Remember, you are trying to correct behavior, not inflict pain. And you never ever correct when you\u2019re angry or upset.\u201d Ian leaned forward to emphasize the point.</p><p>Cody blushed and ducked his head. \u201cI know that now. I\u2019ll tell him how sorry I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs for sexual play,\u201d Ian continued. \u201cDoes he have a safe word?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA word he can say when it gets to be too much for him. A random word you know he wouldn\u2019t say in the normal course of your love play.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe really haven\u2019t had much love play yet.\u201d They hadn\u2019t. They\u2019d only had sex once after Rory woke from the mating and heat induced sleep.</p><p>\u201cBe sure you give him one, and if he uses it, everything stops immediately. I have some books you could read. You really need to be trained properly if you want to dominate him seriously. Remember being a Dom doesn\u2019t mean you have the right to be an asshole. It\u2019s got to be consensual, or it\u2019s abuse, plain and simple. Talk to Rory. I think he must be a natural sexual submissive since your blood chose him, but he\u2019s very young and very shy. Find out what his limits are. Then respect them. Understand?\u201d</p><p>Casey had been paying careful attention and nodded thoughtfully. \u201cI\u2019d never hurt him, you know.\u201d Not again, not knowing what losing Rory did to him even if it had only been a few hours. When Rory rejected their mating, he had gone crazy, and once he calmed down, he understood what Marco had felt when Nicky had been kidnapped and how those feelings had been transmitted to his pack, and to Rory. It was what made Rory attack his brother. He had to believe what Nicky said too. No matter how painful it was to think of his brother as a rapist, he knew deep down Aaron had intended to rape him.</p><p>\u201cI know you wouldn\u2019t hurt him intentionally. If he\u2019s agreed to put himself in your hands, then he\u2019s given you a great gift and an awesome responsibility. Respect it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you talking about me, Ian?\u201d</p><p>Both men turned as Rory came into the room, still wrapped in a blanket. In all the confusion of the night before, he\u2019d never retrieved anything to wear. He walked over and poured a cup of coffee, repeating his question. \u201cAre you?\u201d</p><p>Ian smiled at him. \u201cMaybe just a little. How are you feeling, Rory? Did you sleep well?\u201d</p><p>Rory smiled shyly. \u201cYes, very well, thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEat some breakfast, honey,\u201d Casey told him. \u201cYou haven\u2019t had anything for hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just want coffee for now. Maybe later.\u201d</p><p>Casey filled a plate with some toast and eggs and pushed it over to him. \u201cEat. I don\u2019t want you to get sick.\u201d</p><p>Rory sighed and blushed. \u201cOh all right.\u201d He picked up a fork and began to eat, while Casey watched him carefully. He must have been hungrier than he thought, because he finished it in just a few minutes. Ian smiled across the table at Casey and nodded.</p><p>A knock came on the door, but before Ian could open it, Nicky poked in his golden head and bounced into the room and over to the table. Marco came in more slowly and much more solemnly. Nicky bent down and hugged Rory, smiling over at Casey. \u201cHey, brat! Are you still causing trouble?\u201d</p><p>Rory rolled his eyes. \u201cGod, did you have to bring Nicky, Marco? My life is not irritating enough?\u201d</p><p>Nicky laughed and went back over to Marco, who opened his arms, it seemed, automatically. Nicky certainly had Marco well trained, Casey thought with amusement. Then Rory scooted his chair over next to his and leaned heavily against him. He immediately put an arm around him. The little sneer on Casey\u2019s face at Marco\u2019s expense suddenly died as he realized Rory was doing the same thing to him.</p><p>Marco spoke to Rory. \u201cNicky wanted a chance to see you, Rory, but I think it would be a good idea if you and I went for a walk. Nicky wants to talk to Casey alone.\u201d</p><p>Rory turned to Casey. \u201cIs it okay if I go with him?\u201d</p><p>Marco frowned, but Casey thrilled at the fact he asked permission and kissed the top of Rory\u2019s head. \u201cSure, baby, go ahead. I\u2019ll stay and talk to Nicky.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t have any clothes,\u201d Rory said, blushing.</p><p>Ian stood up. \u201cI\u2019ll get you some of mine, Rory. They\u2019ll be a little big, but you can roll them up. It\u2019ll get you to your room for your own clothes, anyway.\u201d</p><p>Rory glanced at Casey, hesitating to see if Casey objected before he said, \u201cOkay, thanks, Ian.\u201d</p> <p>In a few minutes, they all left, including Ian, who was on his way to a council meeting. Marco made sure the door was left open and glanced back, looking nervous as he left.</p><p>Nicky sat down across from Casey and smiled at him. \u201cSo you crazy about my boy or what?\u201d</p><p>Casey smiled back at him. \u201cYeah, pretty much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know he saved my life twice. I may tease him, but there\u2019s nothing I wouldn\u2019t do for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe either.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGood answer. Now let\u2019s see if you really mean it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarco wants to make you an offer. Now don\u2019t say no right away, just because you don\u2019t like Marco. You two are both too alpha to ever like each other, but maybe you can come to an understanding. For Rory\u2019s sake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d Casey\u2019s face creased with suspicion.</p><p>\u201cAbout staying on here indefinitely.\u201d Nicky held his hand up. \u201cNow wait before you get all mad and huffy. Marco is willing to let the Sapphire Valley Wolf Pack join with ours. It would be good for your people and bring them prosperity and safety. With the Hunters being such a threat and on the move again, there\u2019s safety in numbers. He would build you your own wing, and make your people welcome to our pack. We have our own doctor, our own school. It really would be to your benefit to join us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what about me, Nicky? I\u2019m their alpha. A pack can\u2019t have two.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, but again with the Hunters posing such a threat, we do need a battle commander, someone strong and a good leader, whom the other wolves would look up to. It needs to be an alpha. You would take orders directly from the council, not necessarily Marco. What do you say?\u201d</p><p>Casey hesitated, looking down at the table. Nicky pressed his advantage when Casey didn\u2019t say no immediately. \u201cRory would be so happy to stay here with his family. You know, his little brother really needs him now that his mother is getting older.\u201d Nicky caught his eye and fluttered his lashes. \u201cPlease, Casey.\u201d</p><p>Casey rolled his eyes and smiled. \u201cYou really are something, aren\u2019t you? I was warned about you, and every warning was right on.\u201d He laughed. \u201cAll right. I agree. But I want all this in writing, so Marco can\u2019t back out of it.\u201d</p><p>Nicky jumped up in excitement. \u201cHe won\u2019t back out! Thanks, Casey\u2014you won\u2019t be sorry! C\u2019mon, let\u2019s go find Rory and Marco and tell them.\u201d</p><p>Casey let Nicky lead him downstairs and out to the park area on the side of the building that faced the woods. They walked through the small area, looking for Marco and Rory. As they drew nearer the end of the garden, about to give up and look elsewhere, they realized a fight of some kind was going on just inside the tree line, evidenced by the violent sounds of struggle. Casey started walking faster and then began to run. If Rory was involved in this, he had to get to him. He heard the crack of a rifle, and his heart hammered madly. He heard Nicky cry out behind him, but he couldn\u2019t stop. He raced ahead to where he saw a small body crumpled in the grass, a large silver wolf standing over it protectively, snarling at something moving off through the trees.</p><p>Casey knew it was Rory on the ground, but couldn\u2019t stop until he was sure the danger was over. He shifted as he ran. The silver wolf howled, the sound echoing through the compound. Casey, ran out into the woods, but all he could see was a human\u2019s dead body, blood pooling under him, just inside the trees. No sign of other movement and there was absolutely no sound or smell. Confused, he ran back to where Nicky knelt in the grass, cradling Rory in his arms. He shifted back, dreading what he would see when he got closer. Rory lay white and insensible in Nicky\u2019s arms. Marco stood over them in human form, protectively, swaying dangerously, blood running down his arm.</p><p>Casey fell down beside Nicky and took Rory away from Nicky. \u201cIs he...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Nicky shook his head firmly. \u201cNo, he\u2019s been hit though. The bullet went in his side. I think it went clear through, but we have to get the doctor.\u201d He jumped up and wrapped his arms around Marco, whose knees were about to buckle, and eased him to the ground.</p> <p>Wolves had poured out of the compound to run to them. Some shifted and ran off into the woods, others crowded around them.</p><p>\u201cHunters,\u201d Marco said raggedly. \u201cWe felt someone watching us from the woods, and we turned to run. They started shooting, the bastards, and Rory fell. I tried to pick him up and run, but they shot me too. I shifted, and they took off. I got one of them just inside the tree line there, but I couldn\u2019t leave Rory. There could have been more of them in the woods.\u201d He gasped in pain, and Nicky pulled him close, soothing him, holding his hand tightly over the blood flowing from the wound in Marco\u2019s arm.</p><p>The doctor knelt first beside Marco, but he waved him away. \u201cTake care of Rory. They\u2019re using silver bullets, the bastards.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean? Like on TV?\u201d Nicky looked at Marco in horror.</p><p>\u201cWolves can heal from a gunshot wound so long as we aren\u2019t shot in such a way that a vital organ is destroyed,\u201d the doctor replied. \u201cA silver bullet\u2019s different. Our wounds will take longer to heal. Marco and Rory were lucky, and the bullets passed through. They still might get an infection though.\u201d</p><p>Nicky looked terrified, and Casey clutched Rory to his chest as he stood with him to carry him inside. The doctor spoke encouragingly, but he was still frightened and angry. He wanted to kill whoever hurt Rory. It was all he could do to keep from shifting and running off howling into the woods to hunt. Rory begun to stir, coming around slowly. He looked up at Casey.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened? Where\u2019s Marco?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been shot, baby, but you\u2019ll be okay. Marco is all right. Don\u2019t worry about anything, I\u2019ve got you.\u201d Casey was vaguely aware Marco was being helped along behind him. He still resented Marco, but he was grateful to him for protecting his mate. If anything had happened to Rory, he couldn\u2019t survive. He knew that. Rory still wasn\u2019t out of the woods yet, and anxiety clawed at Casey. Carrying him into the clinic, he placed him gently on the table, and stood by him holding his hand. The doctor came in right behind them, followed by Marco and Nicky, Nicky\u2019s face drained of all color. Nicky looked like Casey felt, shocked and scared half to death.</p><p>The doctor forced both of them outside. Nicky refused outright at first, but when Marco pointed one stern finger, too exhausted and weak to even speak. Nicky reluctantly left, after covering his face with kisses. Casey went too, because he had a feeling Nicky would fall apart once he got out in the waiting room and sure enough, he had his hands full with him. It did help keep his mind off how still and white Rory had been when he first saw him. He\u2019d been so afraid he was dead, he still trembled with reaction.</p><p>Finally, the doctor came and motioned them both inside. Nicky almost knocked him down getting in to Marco. Rory was sitting up, and Casey felt his knees go weak. He rushed over to him and kissed him gently, as if he might break. \u201cAre you all right, baby? God, I was so scared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI-I think so. Just sore and achy on my side. I think it\u2019s trying to heal over already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d the doctor said behind them. \u201cBoth their wounds are healing up from the inside. Marco\u2019s faster, of course, since he\u2019s full wolf.\u201d</p><p>Rory blushed at his words and dropped his head. Casey put his arm around him. \u201cCan I feed him some of my blood? Would that help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard to say with the two of you. We\u2019ve never had this situation before. Go ahead\u2014it might do him some good.\u201d</p><p>Casey bit into his wrist and held it up to Rory\u2019s mouth. Rory took it and sucked, gazing up at Casey so adoringly Casey thought he\u2019d have to climb in bed with him in a minute.</p><p>Nicky pouted on the other side of the room. \u201cI wish I could give you some of my blood, darling. Do you think it would help you if I did?\u201d</p><p>Marco smiled. \u201cNo, baby, but I appreciate the thought. Instead of making me stronger, I\u2019m afraid your blood would make me want to stay on the sofa all day, read magazines, and make smart remarks.\u201d</p><p>Nicky\u2019s mouth dropped open in outrage, and Marco leaned up to cover it with his own, holding the back of his head so he couldn\u2019t get away. Nicky didn\u2019t struggle long and fell across Marco\u2019s chest, trying to get in bed with him until the doctor put a stop to it.</p><p>The doctor pulled at Marco\u2019s hand on the back of Nicky\u2019s head until Marco looked over at him. \u201cAlpha, I don\u2019t mean to be disrespectful, but as your physician, I must caution you to not to get over-stimulated. You\u2019re not completely healed yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not me you have to worry about being over-stimulated\u2014it\u2019s Nicky. Get off the bed, baby, and stop trying to lick me.\u201d</p><p>Casey laughed, while Rory sucked more and more gently, the blood putting him to sleep. Finally, he fell off onto the pillow and began to softly snore. Casey bent down and pressed a soft kiss to his forehead, realizing more every minute how important he was to him.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re sure you\u2019re all right then, I\u2019m going out to hunt with the others.\u201d \u201cOf course I\u2019m all right, or I would be if you\u2019d stop feeding me your blood and making me so sleepy. I slept for twelve hours yesterday!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Casey said moodily. \u201cYou needed it. It\u2019s helping you, and you still need to regain your strength. Why don\u2019t you try to take another little nap while I\u2019m gone? I could give you a little more of my blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely not! I have more of it inside me now than you probably do. I appreciate what you\u2019re trying to do, honey, but really, enough is enough. I need to get out of bed.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOkay, but just for a little while. Don\u2019t do anything strenuous and don\u2019t you dare go outside. The Hunters may still be in the woods. We haven\u2019t figured out how they got away. There was absolutely no smell of them at all, and we should have been able to track them. They might have developed some new chemical to mask their scent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t much like the idea of you out there either, you know. You could be shot or captured.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a big, bad wolf, baby. I\u2019ll be okay.\u201d He leaned over to kiss Rory before he left and Rory clung to his neck.</p> <p>\u201cYeah, well, Big and Bad, don\u2019t do anything risky. Stay with the rest of the pack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course!\u201d Casey grinned and took off out the door, whistling loudly, leaving the room strangely empty without him. They\u2019d grown much closer in the days since he\u2019d been shot, with Casey staying by his side constantly, making love to him and holding him for hours while he slept. Neither of them had talked about the issues that still separated them\u2014the fact that Casey hadn\u2019t forgiven him totally for his brother\u2019s death or how much submissiveness Casey was going to want.</p><p>He had, at least, not said a word when Rory continued to wear his own clothes. Rory hoped he\u2019d not give him an argument about his continuing with his gamma duties as well when he recovered. That would be a deal breaker for Rory. Soon they would have to sit down together and figure this whole thing out. They were in a holding pattern, neither one of them wanting to push the issues, for fear of it coming between them.</p><p>Rory sighed and wandered over to the window to look outside. He watched as Casey neared several of his friends. They all started laughing together, their easy wolf camaraderie a thing which had to be in the past for Rory now. As a wolf\u2019s mate, tradition forbade him letting another dominant wolf touch him. He was pretty conservative when it came to the traditions of his pack, and he would uphold them, Casey or no Casey. Still, he had a secret he hadn\u2019t shared with anyone. When he was shot and he lay on the ground listening to the sounds of a terrible struggle going on with Marco and the Hunter, he had shifted a little. Not all the way, or even enough to change his body, but he did shift some when he was afraid Marco was in danger. He was pretty sure he\u2019d be able to again if he really needed to. Maybe all the way the next time it happened when he was stronger.</p><p>He was happy his wolf wasn\u2019t dead, as Casey thought, but what would the news mean to his relationship with Casey? Casey hadn\u2019t said anything different about hating his wolf. If he knew his wolf was alive and if not well, at least healed a little, what would he think? His knot was still absolutely gone, so he knew he was no longer exactly a wolf, so what was he?</p> <p>Watching them from the window, Rory was amazed to see them all suddenly transform into wolves. Casey was big and brown and as beautiful as he was as a human. They all sprang out into the woods together, howling and nipping at each other\u2019s flanks playfully. Rory watched them go, not really wanting to join them, just worried about his mate.</p><p>He put his head back against the chair and lethargy overtook him. Damn Casey\u2019s strong blood anyway! Maybe he\u2019d take just a short nap. No sooner did he think it than he dozed off and woke up after about an hour. Gazing out the window into the woods he slowly came awake. From his vantage point on the second floor, he could see into the woods for a good little way, especially since the foliage hadn\u2019t fully come out yet for spring. He got a glimpse now and then of a wolf darting by as they trained and hunted in the woods near the compound, ordered by Marco not to venture too far away.</p><p>Then, off on the opposite side of the woods from the wolves, perhaps a hundred or more yards away, Rory saw human forms moving through the trees, sneaking up quietly toward the compound. Hunters! For a moment he couldn\u2019t move, and then he raced to the phone to call for help. He told the operator where he\u2019d last seen the Hunters then he was out the door and running to warn Casey. He could feel the excitement building in him as he ran. He had to get to him, and he felt a low growl start in his throat.</p><p>With a sharp pain in his stomach and groin, he started to shift, pulled off his clothes as his wolf formed and ran through the woods, faster and faster. He howled in anger and outrage as he saw the Hunters taking aim on the group from a hiding place in the trees. They turned and saw him, and one of them turned his rifle toward him. Before he could squeeze the trigger, he was knocked to the ground, and wolves surrounded him on all sides, snarling and yipping, concentrating on one Hunter while the others ran, trying to control their rage enough to take the one alive for questioning.</p><p>Rory stopped at the edge of the trees, panting in relief and reaction, resting for a moment before he tried to make it back to his room. He was about to shift back when a big, brown wolf stalked toward him. The wolf bared huge, glistening fangs, emitting a warning growl as it moved forward. It was Casey. He knew Casey recognized him too, yet looked like he was about to attack, and there was no way he could stop him. Instinctively, Rory dropped to his belly and began to crawl toward the giant wolf. Casey stood still, his large yellow eyes glistening. When Rory got to within a few feet of him, he rolled over on his back and offered his throat, making his surrender clear. Casey could kill him if he wanted to. He would offer no resistance. Casey\u2019s wolf whimpered and came closer, sniffing at him. He straddled Rory\u2019s body and brought his snout right down to his neck. Yet instead of ripping out his throat, his tongue flickered out, and he licked Rory\u2019s mouth and nose before he jumped off and ran away into the woods.</p><p>Rory got to his feet, shaking and shifting back to his human form. Still trembling, he made it back to the compound and up to their room, falling to the bed in complete exhaustion. Shifting took a lot of energy, and it was obviously energy he still didn\u2019t have. There was the added trauma of seeing Casey and exposing his secret. He knew deep down Casey wouldn\u2019t kill him, yet there had been just a moment in the woods when he was a little doubtful. Still he\u2019d offered his throat to him, and Casey had licked him. Licked him! That had to mean he forgave him. Didn\u2019t it? His mind whirling over the possibilities, he closed his eyes and fell asleep. In his dreams, he hunted alongside a big brown wolf, and they ran together under the moonlit night sky.</p> <p>When he awoke, Casey sat quietly in the chair by the bed, staring at him.</p><p>Rory cleared his throat nervously. \u201cHi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh? Oh. You mean how long since I knew I could shift? Just since the day I got shot. I shifted a little when Marco was fighting the Hunter. I think I can only do it when someone I love is threatened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you didn\u2019t think you should share this information with your mate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I guess. I...uh...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw them from the window. I called for help and then ran to warn you. I shifted on the way. It wasn\u2019t a real decision\u2014I just did it because I was so worried about you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYour wolf gave me complete submission.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. I love you, Casey. I\u2019ll do whatever you tell me to.\u201d He batted his eyelashes at Casey as he\u2019d seen Nicky do so many times, while both understood whatever came with conditions.</p><p>\u201cMmm-hmm. Except stay inside when the Hunters are around. God, you\u2019re going to be just like Nicky, aren\u2019t you? You\u2019ve learned from the master, I guess. You\u2019ll do whatever I want you to as long as you want it too. I believe I told you specifically not to go outside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yeah, but I had to. I had to go to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019ll be glad to follow my orders, except when it doesn\u2019t suit you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Casey...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo buts! Do you know the Hunter tried to shoot you again? Do you have any idea how it made me feel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Okay, Rory, your safe word is tornado.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour safe word. Ian said, you have to have a safe word so if you\u2019re uncomfortable when I spank you it all stops.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, then tornado.\u201d</p><p>Casey smiled grimly. \u201cNo, baby, it doesn\u2019t work like that. You can only use it during the punishment, and then only if you really need to. Then we\u2019ll wait and try it again later. But the punishment happens, one way or another. Best to get it over with. So what do you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat-what exactly are you going to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to spank you, Rory. Take your clothes off, put you over my knee, and spank your bottom. Probably for a while. You have to learn when I give you an order it\u2019s for your own safety. Now take off your clothes and put yourself across my lap.\u201d</p><p>Rory got up off the bed and slowly took off his clothes. He walked over to Casey and hesitated. \u201cOne thing. When Nicky gets a spanking, Marco takes him to bed afterward and makes love to him. Are you going to do that to me?\u201d</p><p>Casey tried to hide his smile as he reached up and touched Rory\u2019s erection. \u201cWould you like me to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yes,\u201d Rory said, nodding his head.</p><p>\u201cThen I think that most definitely can be arranged, darlin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>Rory lowered himself across Casey\u2019s knees with a satisfied smile on his face. He arranged himself so his cock rubbed firmly against Casey\u2019s thighs. This discipline stuff might not be half bad.</p><p>*THE END* </p> </body></html>"]
