She tucked a lock of long brown hair behind her ear and continued to update the team on the weekly stats for our Internet startup, Clozpin. I listened attentively, grateful to have her back on the team.</p> <p>Alli had been back in Boston only a few weeks, but she was finally sharing a city and an apartment with Heath again. Heath was happy, she was happy, and I was thrilled to have her reclaim her position as the marketing director after the debacle with Risa. I\u2019d invited Alli back even before letting Risa go for sharing confidential information about the company.</p><p>I winced at the thought. Alli was a fountain of optimism, but Risa\u2019s betrayal still stung me. I hadn\u2019t heard from her since our last meeting, and somehow the silence between us filled me more with dread than anything else. I wanted to doubt her ability to start a competing site with Max, our almost-investor and Blake\u2019s sworn enemy, but the unknown worried me. What if they successfully lured our advertisers away? What if they were able to build something that was legitimately better and filled a need that Clozpin didn\u2019t?</p><p>With the kind of money Max was bringing to the table plus Risa\u2019s inside information gleaned directly from everything I\u2019d learned in my short tenure as CEO of the company, anything was possible. And something about the way she left, filled with so much venom and resentment, spoke to every insecurity I had about running a business. I was still fledgling, without a doubt. I wanted to believe I could hold my own, and in many ways I had, but I had a lot to learn.</p><p>Another text message arrived on my phone, no less distracting as it vibrated against the glass top of the conference table.</p><p>B: Erica?</p> <p>I rolled my eyes and quickly tapped out a reply. I knew he\u2019d pester me until I acknowledged him.</p><p>E: I\u2019m in a meeting. I\u2019ll call you after.</p><p>B: I want you naked in my bed by the time I get home. You should leave soon.</p><p>E: I need more time.</p><p>B: I\u2019ll be inside you within the hour. Your office, our bed, your choice. Wrap it up.</p><p>The air in the room was suddenly too cool against my hot skin. I shivered and my nipples beaded, grazing uncomfortably against my shirt. How did he do that? A few well-placed words, delivered via text no less, had me checking my watch.</p> <p>\u201cErica, do you have anything else you want to cover?\u201d</p><p>My eyes locked with Alli\u2019s. She cocked an eyebrow like maybe she knew I wasn\u2019t paying attention. All I could think about were the consequences of keeping Blake waiting, and the physical response to that anticipation was already becoming difficult to ignore. I corralled my thoughts away from Blake\u2019s promises and back to the present.</p><p>\u201cNo, I think we\u2019re good. Thanks, everyone.\u201d I collected my things quickly, eager to get moving. I waved off the rest of the group, and they dispersed to their workstations. Alli followed me into my partitioned office.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up with Perry? I didn\u2019t want to bring it up at the meeting since it\u2019s kind of an odd situation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot much. He emailed me again, but I haven\u2019t replied yet.\u201d I didn\u2019t have time to get into the complexities of that situation right now if I wanted to meet Blake\u2019s deadline.</p><p>\u201cAre you thinking about taking him on as an advertiser?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure.\u201d I was still conflicted on the matter.</p><p>Her big brown eyes were wide. \u201cDoes Blake know he reached out to you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d I gave her a pointed stare, making it clear without words that I didn\u2019t want him to either. The last time I\u2019d seen Isaac Perry, Blake had him pinned to the wall by his throat threatening to de-limb him if he dared touch me ever again. I didn\u2019t want to make excuses for Isaac\u2019s bad behavior that night, and I didn\u2019t want to forgive him any more than Blake did. But this was business.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not going to be happy if you end up working with him.\u201d</p><p>I stuffed my laptop into my bag. \u201cYou think I don\u2019t know that?\u201d</p><p>Blake\u2019s associations colored more strategic business decisions than I cared to admit.</p><p>Alli leaned against my desk. \u201cSo what are you going to do? Perry must be offering something impressive if you haven\u2019t completely shot him down yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerry Media Group represents a dozen multimedia publications that span the globe. I\u2019m not saying I trust him, but I can at least hear him out.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cWhatever you think is best for the company I\u2019ll support. I don\u2019t mind dealing with him directly either, if you\u2019re more comfortable with that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Alli. I\u2019d rather get to the bottom of this myself though. We can talk about it more later. I need to head out. Blake is waiting for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, are you going out?\u201d She brightened immediately, her business persona vanishing, replaced by the energetic best friend who made every day a little brighter.</p><p>\u201cUm, we have plans. I\u2019ll see you later,\u201d I said, trying not to sound cryptic before slipping out of the office and waving my goodbyes.</p><p>A minute later I stepped outside into the early August heat. Rush hour traffic pushed by, and my phone rang before I could take my first steps toward home. I groaned and fished it out of my purse. Blake could be maddeningly persistent. When I retrieved it, a Chicago phone number appeared instead.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d I answered tentatively.</p><p>\u201cErica?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, who is this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s me, Elliot.\u201d</p><p>I brought my hand to my mouth, muffling the sound of my shock at hearing my stepfather\u2019s voice. \u201cElliot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have a minute? Is this a bad time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, this is fine.\u201d I pushed through the doors of Mocha, the caf\u00e9 downstairs, for a reprieve from the heat. \u201cHow are you? I haven\u2019t talked to you in forever.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cI\u2019ve been busy.\u201d</p><p>I smiled to myself. I hadn\u2019t heard that sound in so long.</p><p>\u201cOf course. How are the kids?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re doing really well. Growing up too fast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bet. How\u2019s Beth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s fine. She\u2019s back to work now that the kids are in school, so that keeps her busy. We\u2019ve both got our hands full.\u201d He cleared his throat and took an audible breath. \u201cListen, Erica, I know I haven\u2019t been very good about keeping in touch. Honestly, I feel terrible about it. I really wanted to come to the graduation. Things were just really hectic here\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine, Elliot. I understand. You have a lot going on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d He sighed quietly. \u201cYou\u2019ve always been so level-headed. Even when you were younger. Sometimes I think you had it together more than I did. I know your mother would be proud of the woman you\u2019ve become.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. I hope so.\u201d I closed my eyes, letting a remembered vision of my mother take over my mind. Despite the strong facade I kept up, my heart hurt at the memory\u2014times when the three of us were happy. That time had been cut short abruptly when my mother was diagnosed with cancer, a disease that ripped through her at an alarming speed and took her from us too soon.</p><p>While our lives had gone in different directions after her death, I hoped Elliot had found happiness with his new wife and their children. Even if it had come at the expense of any normal childhood for me. Boarding school and then college had raised me, yet I couldn\u2019t imagine it any other way. This was my life, and the journey had brought me to Blake, to a life that was finally beginning to take shape now that school was behind me.</p> <p>\u201cI have been thinking about Patricia a lot lately. I can\u2019t believe it\u2019s been almost ten years. Life runs away from you sometimes. Made me realize how long it\u2019s been since we talked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true. The past few years have really been a blur. Especially lately. I was crazy to think I was busy before.\u201d Between the business and my relationship with Blake, my life had been turned upside down a few times over. Just when things started to calm down, life seemed to throw us something new.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m going to see if we can make it out to Boston soon. I can\u2019t stomach the thought of letting ten years go by without...you know, some kind of acknowledgment. We owe her that much.\u201d</p><p>My mouth curved into a sad smile. \u201cThat would be nice. I would like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. I\u2019ll see what I can do.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLet me know if you pick dates, and I\u2019ll coordinate things on my end too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfect. I\u2019ll talk to Beth about it soon and let you know what we decide.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll look forward to it. I\u2019d love to see you again, and of course meet your family.\u201d Your family. The words sounded strange as they left me.</p><p>\u201cTake care, Erica. I\u2019ll be in touch.\u201d</p><p>I said goodbye, but the second I hung up another call came in. My heart sped up when I saw Blake\u2019s number.</p><p>Shit.</p> <p>I stepped into the apartment and dropped my bags onto the counter in the kitchen. The lights were off, but the afternoon sun peeked in through the shaded windows. As I moved into the living room, I heard Blake\u2019s voice.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re late.\u201d</p><p>I spun to find him at the bar on the other side of the room. He was shirtless, barefoot, and held a half empty tumbler in his hand. His face was void of emotion yet somehow filled with an intensity that had me immediately on edge. His green eyes seemed to glow in the dim light of the room. His jaw was tight, loosening only briefly to take a drink.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I got a call\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome here.\u201d</p><p>I let my next words fizzle out unspoken. We weren\u2019t going to be discussing Elliot\u2019s unexpected call, at least not right now. Something was off about the way he looked at me, the unforgiving edge in his voice as he uttered those two little words.</p><p>I walked slowly toward him until we were inches apart and the heat radiated between us. Blake was undeniably gorgeous, male beauty perfected. Tall and lean, his body had my brain regularly short-circuiting. This was no exception. I touched his chest, unable to resist in our proximity. The muscles flinched in response.</p><p>\u201cTake your shirt off,\u201d he said.</p> <p>I searched his eyes a moment but found no humor there. He stood before me like a statue, a beautifully carved work of art, cold and unmoving. I feathered my fingers over his abs, trailing them to the band of his jeans slung low on his hips.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d I murmured. I\u2019d seen him like this before. He didn\u2019t need to tell me, because I already knew something or someone had gotten under his skin today.</p><p>He winced, a nearly imperceptible response. \u201cI\u2019ll be better in a minute.\u201d</p><p>Knowing what could get him there, I pulled off my blouse and let it drop to the floor.</p><p>\u201cBetter?\u201d I cocked my head, hoping to draw out the playful lover in him.</p><p>His eyes were unchanged, steely as ever. \u201cDon\u2019t make me wait again, Erica.\u201d</p><p>His voice was dangerously low. I held my breath, trying in vain to harness control over my own body\u2019s reactions to him. That potent mix of desire and anticipation welled up inside of me. The details of the day blurred into the background, secondary to the here and now and the domineering man who was moments from fucking away his release and using my body so very well to do it.</p><p>I lowered my hand to the hard outline of his erection and stroked him through the soft worn fabric of his jeans. \u201cI\u2019m here now. Let me make it up to you.\u201d</p><p>He caught my wrist. \u201cYou will, trust me.\u201d</p><p>I looked up through my eyelashes. He released me and brought his hand to my chest. He traced the lace hem of my bra and the skin beneath. The simple contact warmed me. He pushed the cup of the bra down roughly, palmed my freed breast, and thumbed my nipple. I leaned into the slow circular motions as a flicker of desire took root in my belly.</p><p>I moaned, and he pinched tightly. I sucked in a breath through my teeth but didn\u2019t push him away. His lip turned up at the corner and a flash of terrible mischief passed over his eyes.</p><p>\u201cUndress and bend over the table.\u201d</p><p>Playful had arrived, but so had someone else.</p><p>I frowned in the direction of the dining area and the large wooden farmhouse table at the center of it. Before I could argue, he swatted my ass and gave me a gentle shove in that direction. I moved quickly and removed my skirt, bra, and panties. I faced the table, resting my hands on the warm textured wood. On the center of the table, lengths of rope were curled into a pile.</p><p>\u201cDown,\u201d he said in a clipped tone.</p><p>He placed his hand between my shoulder blades and pressured me lower. I slid my hands out in front of me, exhaling sharply as the front of my body touched the cool table, the tops of my thighs pressed firmly against the edge. The anticipation held me hostage, robbed me of the ability to make sense of anything but the surety that Blake was taking control now.</p><p>And I\u2019d given him that.</p><p>As soon as I\u2019d walked out of my normal working life and into the apartment we now shared, I went to war with damn near every instinct I had. I handed over all control to the man I loved, trusting that he\u2019d take care of us both. He always did, but sometimes I couldn\u2019t resist the urge to push back just a bit, so he knew I was still there, fighting. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He ran a cool hand over my ass. I tensed in response to the simple touch. I bit my lip, steadying myself for what always came next.</p><p>\u201cYou were twenty minutes late. Do you know what that means?\u201d</p><p>Before I could speak, his hand made sharp contact with my ass. I whimpered at the sharp pain. Then the sting melted, setting off a fiery heat through my body. I arched, pushing back against him.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to punish me?\u201d I asked quietly.</p> <p>\u201cIs that what you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d The meekness of my responses still surprised me, considering how far we\u2019d gone and how much I loved those dark places we found in each other. Admitting how much I loved it still took a certain amount of courage.</p><p>\u201cLucky for you. You\u2019re going to get twenty lashes. I want you to count. Don\u2019t forget, or I\u2019ll get the belt.\u201d</p><p>Without delay he slapped my ass again, hard enough to echo through the room. The second I caught my breath, I rushed to speak.</p><p>\u201cOne.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s it.\u201d He delivered another.</p><p>\u201cTwo.\u201d</p><p>With every punishing swat, I tightened and grew wetter, a circumstance I still couldn\u2019t quite grasp. But getting spanked drove me fucking crazy. By the time we were in double digits I was clawing at the table, more than ready for the pleasure that came after the delicious pain.</p><p>Twenty.</p><p>I sighed and rested against the table. The relief was short-lived as Blake caught my ponytail and coaxed me up to stand.</p><p>\u201cUp.\u201d</p> <p>I straightened, and he spun me. He dropped his jaw, as if to speak, but instead he pulled our bodies together. His skin scorched under mine, and suddenly I wanted him even more. He sealed his lips over mine with a hard kiss. The aroma of scotch mingled with the musk of him. I opened my lips to him, inviting him, wanting his taste on my tongue. He yanked my ponytail gently, breaking the contact.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re too greedy.\u201d</p><p>I pouted.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re spoiled, and you don\u2019t listen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI listen,\u201d I insisted.</p><p>\u201cYou may listen, but you don\u2019t obey worth a damn. Playtime is over. You need to learn, and tonight I\u2019m going to teach you.\u201d</p><p>I fought the fear that coiled in my gut. Fear of the unknown. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a good start. Get on the table.\u201d</p> <p>I hesitated a second and then quickly lifted myself onto the edge. He shook his head and scooted me back.</p><p>\u201cIn the middle. Hurry up.\u201d</p><p>I lifted my eyebrows, but rather than question him, I shimmied to the middle. As I did, he circled the table and retrieved the rope from my path.</p><p>\u201cLie down.\u201d</p><p>I obeyed, and he caught my wrist, extending my arm to reach the corner of the table. With shocking speed and dexterity, he bound my arms to the legs of the table. As he moved to my ankles, I pulled against the rope, testing its security. No give.</p><p>He bound one leg, and then the other, until I was spread eagle on the table.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s better.\u201d He gave my calf a small squeeze.</p><p>My skin heated all the way to my cheeks as the extent of my vulnerability sank in. I wanted to tell him this was too much. The words were on the edge of my lips, but I was already wet and needy for him, for whatever he was cooking up in that devious mind of his. Adding to my growing unease, Blake moved away until he was out of my range of vision.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d I tried to hide the anxiety in my voice.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019m not leaving. Not when you\u2019re spread out for me like a fucking banquet.\u201d</p><p>I heard ice hitting the inside of a glass and then the quiet guzzle of it being filled. He returned and stood before me, bringing the glass to his lips, obscuring the ghost of a grin on his beautiful face. Something in his expression promised I was in for a slow torture. The need that pulsed through me doubled. I was entirely at his mercy now.</p><p>Seconds that felt like minutes passed. My breasts heaved in time to my breathing, which ticked up as I waited. For what? I had no idea, but the possibilities thrilled me.</p><p>He lifted the glass once more, drained its contents, and dropped the tumbler loudly onto the table between my legs. He dipped his hand into the glass, and the clink of the ice was followed by the silent shock of the cold on my skin. He traced a slow wet path down the inside of my leg, along the sensitive skin of my inner thigh. I shivered, tensing, as he traveled over my hips to my belly. The cube melted slowly at my navel while he reached for another.</p><p>He rounded the table, coming to my side. With the next cube, he circled my nipples, lingering on each. On the brink of pain, I suppressed my protest. I couldn\u2019t risk more punishment if it delayed him being inside me. He lowered his lips, replacing the numbing cool of the ice with the wet heat of his mouth. His teeth clipped the hardened points while a cool hand found its mark between my thighs.</p><p>He hummed, sliding easily through my folds, teasing my clit. \u201cYou like when I tie you up, baby?\u201d</p><p>I licked my dry lips, nodding quickly. Did I? I wasn\u2019t sure. All I really knew was that I didn\u2019t want him to stop. I didn\u2019t want to say anything to keep him from giving me the pleasure that only he could. He kept me right on the edge, a state so heightened and helpless that it bordered on unbearable. I tugged against the restraints, the rope biting into my skin.</p><p>\u201cStop fighting, Erica.\u201d</p><p>He straightened, depriving me of his touch and his closeness.</p><p>\u201cI thought you were in a hurry,\u201d I complained, trying to get a grip on the desire that burned through me a little more fiercely with each passing minute. Goddamn him and this rope.</p><p>He grinned. \u201cI was, but the thought of punishing you tempered that sense of urgency. Now I\u2019m just enjoying myself.\u201d</p><p>I closed my eyes. My chest expanded with a deep breath, and I willed myself to relax. As I did, I felt a shock of cold between my legs.</p><p>I cried out, from surprise and the sensation that I wasn\u2019t convinced yet was discomfort. My clit was throbbing against the ice as he maneuvered over the nub, between my folds. I released a breath as he lowered it away from my most sensitive parts and dipped the tip gently into my pussy. When I thought he might relieve me, the hint of a touch gave way to the ice. How long could he do this to me and keep his own desires in check? How long could I do this? I was ready to burst and scream.</p><p>\u201cBlake, I can\u2019t...I can\u2019t do this anymore. You\u2019re killing me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow does it feel to wait...to want?\u201d</p><p>I clamped my jaw tight, trying to distract myself from the terrible ache between my thighs. I squirmed despite myself, knowing it wouldn\u2019t bring him any closer to fucking me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI hate it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould we end it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said, the desperation plain in my voice.</p><p>He leaned closer, his lips grazing the sensitive skin of my neck. He traced the curve of my ear with his tongue, a slow torture all its own.</p> <p>\u201cBeg.\u201d</p><p>Chills broke out over my skin. I arched my chest into the air, into nothing because he was barely touching me now.</p><p>\u201cTell me how much you want it. I need the words.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlake...please, just fuck me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds like an order. I want begging.\u201d</p> <p>I groaned and he pulled away, no longer touching me anywhere in any way.</p><p>\u201cBlake!\u201d I was furious and desperate.</p><p>\u201cSubmit.\u201d</p><p>I jolted at the sharp edge of his voice.</p><p>\u201cYou need to submit to me, Erica, if you want to come. No more playing games. No more testing me.\u201d</p><p>I swallowed hard, fighting the instinct to rile at his order. Submit. My throat tightened, as if the word had lodged itself there and wouldn\u2019t pass until I accepted it. That word meant so much. Submitting was easier when I was coaxing him into taking what he needed from me. Now he was taking what he wanted. He wasn\u2019t asking and we weren\u2019t negotiating.</p> <p>I closed my eyes, straining to hear the voice in my head telling me to relax, to let go. \u201cYou\u2019re not making it easy.\u201d I wanted him to understand my resistance, maybe even let it slide. Even when he went all Dom on me, sometimes he\u2019d give me room to push back.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been putting out fires all day. I want to come home to you, and I don\u2019t want to have to break you every time. If I have to, I will, but I won\u2019t always be asking nicely and making it easy for you. So you should get used to submitting. You\u2019re naked, tied to the table, and one stroke away from coming. Do you want to come?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, badly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen beg.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease...\u201d The plea was weak as it left my lips.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m listening, Erica. Please what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, make me come. I want your hands on me. I\u2019ll do anything...I swear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you be home, naked, when I ask you next time?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>His fingertips grazed my throbbing clit. I sucked in a sharp breath and lifted my hips to meet his touch, but he evaded me as quickly as he\u2019d arrived.</p><p>\u201cPromise?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promise. Jesus, I\u2019ll do anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I won\u2019t have to give you directions about how to submit again, will I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I promised, shaking my head emphatically.</p><p>The heat of his hand radiated where I badly needed him. I resisted the urge to coax my body centimeters closer. Fucking hell, this is torture.</p><p>Every cell in my body strained toward his touch, and yet I had no control.</p><p>This was the reality I fought to accept. Somehow I had to trust that he\u2019d get us there. With that realization, something inside me released. I weakened against the table, no longer fighting the restraints. My muscles let go but my mind spun, no more in control than my body was over how badly I wanted him.</p><p>Then he touched me. Covering my pussy with the palm of his hand, he gripped me firmly.</p><p>\u201cThis is mine. You don\u2019t come unless I want you to. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>I gazed at him, bleary eyed with my own need. I was seconds from crying for how on edge I was, as if somehow his own frustrations from the day had passed right through me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be whatever you need, Blake.\u201d</p><p>His eyes softened a fraction at my concession. Then he entered me with two fingers. My jaw fell, releasing a gasp of relief. He twisted inside me, exploring my wet depths. Trembling, I tightened around him, wishing I had more of him there but grateful I had anything at all. He pumped gently and thumbed my clit with quick circles.</p><p>I released a small cry at the potency of that one motion, relieved and coiled up again all at once. My nerves came back to life, my flesh hot and ready for him all over again. God, the man had a gift for making me painfully aware of how much my body thrived with his touch. I caught myself when my hips lifted a fraction on their own accord.</p><p>Beg. His demand echoed in my head, both sultry and unforgiving. My core pulsed. Blood thrummed through my veins, humming in my ears. The beginnings of an unstoppable orgasm crept up on me, and I wasn\u2019t about to let it go. Not for pride, not for anything.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t stop. I\u2019m begging you, please don\u2019t stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I want to hear, baby. You want all of me in there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant me to let you come first?\u201d</p><p>Colors swirled behind my eyes and every muscle tensed now with anticipation. My eyes flashed open when I realized he hadn\u2019t yet given me explicit permission to come. I met his dark gaze, his eyelids hooded with the same brand of desire that was rushing through me at this very moment.</p><p>\u201cPlease let me. Blake, please...\u201d</p><p>He lowered and caught my mouth in a rough kiss. Our lips rushed over each other, our tongues clashed and sucked. All the while his fingers continued their ministrations, gently fucking me, coaxing me to the edge. The searing pleasure of it overtook me, as if the only sense in the world came from the places where our bodies met, the pleasure he was gifting to me. And I was as grateful as I was desperate to have it. An all-consuming heat swept over me. I began to shake with the effort not to orgasm.</p><p>\u201cOh God,\u201d I whimpered, losing my hold on reality, on anything. \u201cPlease, please, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome, Erica. Right now,\u201d he rasped into my mouth, his intimate touch deepening.</p><p>I gasped for air, arching off the table. Bound by the rope, I could hasten nothing, control nothing. The words, the order, had stripped me down. I was owned. His. At his mercy and command, I crashed over the edge with a wail. I clenched my fists, tight and tautly held as the climax ripped through me.</p><p>The world went silent in that perfect moment. I was still trembling when he left me. His fingers went to work loosening the rope around my ankles. Somewhere in the delirious aftermath of the orgasm, I registered relief at this new freedom. Seconds later he was fully naked, covering my body with his. He hooked my legs around his waist and with the thick head of cock against my entrance, he pressed into me a bare inch.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so fucking hard it hurts. I\u2019m going to fuck you deep, so deep that next time you won\u2019t forget who owns you, baby. I\u2019ll have you coming again and again, until you trust me to give us what we both want.\u201d</p><p>My voice was lost in my delirium. I was reeling, barely prepared for what he\u2019d give me next. The muscles of his torso were hard and taut as he wrapped an arm around my waist. His green eyes were dark and dilated, and they locked with mine. I saw him then\u2014the man, but also the animal that lived below the surface. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He needed this. He needed me this way.</p><p>\u201cBlake.\u201d I licked my lips, now dry from my ragged breathing. \u201cKiss me...please.\u201d</p><p>The tension in his gaze, the dominant determination, gave way to something else.</p><p>And I felt it when our lips met, with more care now than before, but no less passionate. Love. I recognized it. With all his kinks and maddening control issues, I loved this man. As much as he needed this, I needed to be this for him.</p> <p>\u201cI love you.\u201d The words rushed out when I broke our kiss.</p><p>Those intense eyes burned into me once more. The need that vibrated through his body seemed to still for a moment. Then he lowered again. His lips brushed over mine gently.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t breathe without you, baby. You undo me and then put me back together whole again. You take it all, and you still love me for it.\u201d</p><p>The questioning in his eyes and the doubt in those last few words broke my heart a little.</p><p>\u201cBlake...I\u2019m yours. I want this. I want every part of you.\u201d My throat tightened, for reasons altogether different now. Desire and a soul-wrenching love worked its way through me, radiating between us.</p> <p>Our lips met again and he pushed into me, dipping his tongue into my mouth as he did. My sex gripped around him, stretching around his thick cock. Then he was deep inside me. We were so close, our souls joining as our bodies did. He withdrew and thrust again, hitting me deeper. I gasped. His body was hard above me, rippling with strain as he held back. I felt it too, that need to burst, to be engulfed in this wild desire.</p><p>Heat blazed in his eyes as he cupped a hand at my nape, leveraging his weight on his elbow. I locked my ankles around his waist as his bicep flexed into the flesh of my waist. Then he drove hard, just the way I wanted him to. The friction of his entry hurled me to the sharp edge of an orgasm. My jaw dropped with a soundless cry that found its voice as he pounded into me.</p><p>Hard. Fast. Merciless and rough. One of the many ways I loved having him.</p><p>The relentless pace had me coming again quickly. My pussy tightened around him, as I clung to his hips with my thighs. One climax crashed right into the next until he began to come with me. He ground his hips into me, pinning us to the table in a rabid race for relief, for release...my name on his lips.</p><p>CHAPTER TWO</p><p>I straddled Blake\u2019s hips, massaging my thumbs over the protruding muscles of his shoulders. His muscles barely gave, and I wondered if I was having any effect on him at all. Then he breathed out a soft moan. I smiled and lowered so my front covered his back. I kissed his skin, breathing in the fragrance of the lotion mingled with his scent. By some magic of nature, my own muscles let go. His musk, the sweat from our lovemaking, nearly overwhelmed me. I could lie like this and smell the man all damn day.</p> <p>\u201cYou smell amazing.\u201d I pressed my lips against him, kissing him, inhaling him.</p><p>He released a soft chuckle.</p><p>I darted my tongue out to taste him, like the smell of him wasn\u2019t enough. As if getting screwed to oblivion on a dining room table, bound like the bad little submissive I was, wasn\u2019t enough. Blake Landon was my drug, my obsession\u2014a habit I had no intentions of ever quitting.</p><p>I worshipped him with my lips and my teeth. I massaged him, my fingers trailing over him with the same kind of obsession.</p><p>In a flash, he bucked me off and I was on my back, his gorgeous naked body between my legs.</p><p>\u201cAre you trying to get fucked again? Because if you are, you\u2019re doing a damn good job of it.\u201d</p><p>I giggled. He smiled broadly, capturing my wrists on either side of my head. He rubbed the tender spots where the rope had bitten into me.</p><p>Recognizing a whisper of familiar worry in his features, I slipped out of his grasp. I cupped his cheeks, holding his focus on me. \u201cI\u2019m fine. Don\u2019t start with the guilt, okay?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust me, I didn\u2019t feel a thing. In the heat of the moment, all I can feel are your hands on me, you inside me. It\u2019s all consuming. Something that might hurt normally just adds an edge to whatever pleasure you\u2019re giving me. And you know damn well I like it, so don\u2019t start acting like I\u2019m some wounded kitten.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it hurts you now. What if you bruise?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho cares? I won\u2019t fight so hard next time. You wanted to teach me a lesson, didn\u2019t you?\u201d I shifted my hips beneath him, teasing him as his erection throbbed hot against my belly. I twisted my lips into a crooked grin. I wanted playful Blake, and I wasn\u2019t about to let him fall back into shaming his needs\u2014needs that were quickly becoming mine too.</p><p>After what I\u2019d been through with the man who\u2019d raped me four years ago, I never thought I\u2019d be able to give someone the kind of control I\u2019d given Blake. But he\u2019d shown me how to enjoy letting go. He\u2019d opened my eyes to the craving, to something deeper and infinitely more intense than anything I\u2019d ever experienced.</p><p>I fought for control only to have him strip me of it in that masterful way that he always did. He broke me down until I was mindless with desire, and I didn\u2019t want it any other way now. I couldn\u2019t imagine it.</p><p>I ran two fingers over the frown that curved his brow. \u201cWhat\u2019s eating you, anyway? You seemed upset earlier.\u201d</p><p>He rolled off of me and onto his back, his gaze fixed on the ceiling. Before I could press him, a door slammed and I heard muffled voices. I hopped up quickly, shut the bedroom door, and locked it. I joined Blake back on the bed, snuggling into the nook of his arm. I tossed my leg lazily over his strong thigh.</p><p>A loud thud from the hallway in the apartment echoed through the room. The sound was followed by a woman\u2019s giggle and then a moan. I smirked. Alli and Heath were at it again, but who was I to talk?</p><p>Thank God they hadn\u2019t walked in on Blake\u2019s little stunt in the dining room. I couldn\u2019t imagine explaining any of that to Alli. She was still mercifully in the dark about all of Blake\u2019s kinks and quirks in the bedroom, and at least for now, I\u2019d rather it stay that way.</p><p>\u201cWe should take a trip,\u201d Blake said suddenly.</p><p>I sighed. \u201cI\u2019m sure they\u2019ll get a place soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot soon enough. Plus, we haven\u2019t been away together since...well, since Vegas. We could use a long weekend. I want to spend some time with you. Just us. No distractions.\u201d</p><p>An unexpected series of events, many of them orchestrated by Blake, had brought us here. Vegas had been a turning point among them, and the memory of our first time together still warmed me from head to toe. There had been only lust between us then, but lust had turned to obsession and somewhere in that wild blur, I had fallen in love with him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure I should take time away from work right now.\u201d The past few hours had pushed Risa and Max and their whole scheming madness out of my mind, but slowly reality crept back in.</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019ve earned it. Let me take you away for a few days. There will always be something we need to do and someone who needs us. But there\u2019s nothing that can\u2019t wait an extra day or two.\u201d</p><p>I raised my eyebrows, the compulsive worker in me not entirely believing him. \u201cYou sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPositive. In fact, I\u2019ve just decided I\u2019m not giving you a choice. We\u2019ll leave after work tomorrow.\u201d</p> <p>I grinned, a little thrill working its way through me. \u201cWhat should I pack?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll put a bag together for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure you\u2019ll be wearing clothes much anyway, so it doesn\u2019t really matter, does it? Bikini, some thongs. That should do fine.\u201d</p><p>I laughed and playfully swatted his face. He caught my hand and growled, hauling me on top of him.</p> <p>\u201cUntil then, I think we need to make a little noise of our own.\u201d</p><p>I laughed again and shook my head. \u201cNot to be outdone, Blake. You are incorrigible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust me, I have no interest in hearing my little brother getting laid. The only way I can send a message is to return the favor. All I need to do is figure out a way to make you scream for me.\u201d</p><p>My smile slipped a little. He wrapped his arms around me, holding me tight and stoking the fire with every soft graze of his fingertips over my skin.</p><p>\u201cI have a feeling you already know how to do that very well.\u201d</p><p>A loud knock woke me. Blake stirred behind me but didn\u2019t wake.</p> <p>\u201cErica, are you up?\u201d The muffled voice came from behind the door.</p><p>I slipped on Blake\u2019s T-shirt and glanced back to make sure Blake was decently covered. I opened the door a bit. Alli was wide-eyed and already dressed for work.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I frowned. \u201cWhat time is it anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s eight o\u2019clock. Get dressed. I need to show you something.\u201d</p><p>I studied her with tired eyes, not awake enough to comprehend anything beyond wanting to curl up in bed with Blake again. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust get moving and meet me at the office.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2014\u201d</p><p>Before I could finish she\u2019d disappeared down the hallway and the door clicked shut a few seconds later. I turned back into the bedroom and headed to the bathroom. Blake was still sleeping when I finished my shower. I dressed quickly and hovered over him a moment, enjoying the rare peace on his countenance as he slept. Of the two of us, he was typically the early riser, but it had been a long night. Some nights we couldn\u2019t get enough of each other, and last night had turned into the morning before sleep finally found us. I pressed a soft kiss to his cheek and left for work.</p> <p>When I walked into the office, the entire team was huddled around James, their eyes glued to something on his display monitor. I joined them, unsure at first of what I was looking at.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis site, PinDeelz launched last night,\u201d Alli explained. \u201cAll our Clozpin users were messaged about the launch, including us. Very discreet.\u201d</p><p>I leaned over James\u2019s shoulder as he navigated through pages of a site that, though different in its branding, displayed very similarly to ours. My stomach fell when each page displayed ads from Bryant\u2019s, one of our major advertisers who had yet to renew their contract with us for the following month.</p><p>Motherfucker.</p><p>I straightened and disappeared to my office. I whipped open my laptop and investigated the site further. The about page listed Max as its founder and Risa as its chief operating officer. Not surprisingly, Trevor\u2019s role wasn\u2019t mentioned, but I knew damn well that the hacker who\u2019d spent months, maybe years, trying to ruin Blake\u2019s ventures had been pivotal in getting this competing site off the ground. Even if that meant taking a break from relentlessly attacking my and Blake\u2019s businesses.</p><p>Anger surged through me. I could barely process that this was happening. Sid and I had spent months fine-tuning Clozpin, making it what it was today. All our success, all the mistakes and the lessons, had been swiftly copied and enhanced.</p><p>Alli joined me and sat in the chair across from my desk, my concern reflecting in her features. She worried her lip but said nothing. Inside I was flying into a psychotic rage. I wanted to throw the biggest temper tantrum anyone had ever seen. I wanted to curse, and God help me if I could get Max and Risa...and Trevor...in front me, there would be blood.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe they really did it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she said quietly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in disbelief that someone would harbor so much hatred for me and for Blake that they would do something like this. Total sabotage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey won\u2019t last, Erica.\u201d</p><p>I let out a short laugh. \u201cWhy not? What\u2019s keeping them from it? You met Risa. You know how determined she is, and with Max\u2019s money, I see no reason why they can\u2019t completely wipe us out now. This market isn\u2019t big enough to support two sites with such similar offerings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t think like that. We\u2019re far from doomed. I have been talking to a lot of new prospects since I\u2019ve been back. It\u2019s a process, but we\u2019re close to closing more. We\u2019re established, and we have the track record. I\u2019m shocked they could get Bryant\u2019s to take a risk with them being so new.\u201d</p><p>I was pissed all over again imagining what Risa must have said to lure one of our biggest advertisers away. \u201cWhat am I supposed to do now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe keep going. They want to distract us and scare us. Don\u2019t let them do that.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. Nothing she said would improve my present mood. Deep down, I didn\u2019t believe her either. The sky was falling, and I couldn\u2019t sit back and watch them tear down everything I\u2019d worked for.</p><p>The morning passed, and I didn\u2019t feel any less exasperated by the situation. I\u2019d wasted hours obsessing over every detail of their new site, comparing every bell and whistle to ours. My insecurities were at the wheel, and they were steadily driving me right off the tracks. By lunch, most of my adrenaline rush had worn off and my body reminded me that I\u2019d been up half the night with Blake. I needed coffee.</p><p>I walked down to Mocha and took a small table in the corner. I fidgeted with the paper menu even though I always got the same thing. Simone sauntered up, carrying more than a few stares with her as she moved across the cafe. Her red hair, enviable curves, and saucy smile greeted me a moment later. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHow\u2019s my favorite techie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve had better days,\u201d I said. \u201cAnyway, I thought James was your favorite techie.\u201d</p><p>She smirked and leaned against the table. \u201cYeah, well, he\u2019s getting there. I\u2019m not completely convinced he\u2019s not still pining over you.\u201d</p><p>I resisted the urge to roll my eyes. I really hoped James had moved on, and Simone absolutely had my blessing. From his mop of inky black hair to his muscled sleeve of ink, James was her dream man. The only problem was he\u2019d read all the signs wrong when Blake and I had been apart. Or maybe he\u2019d read them right, knowing I was in desperate need of a friend, of anything or anyone to fill the void that being away from Blake had created. I hadn\u2019t known until too late that nothing would ever fill that void except for the man who shared my bed now.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you have to worry about that, Simone.\u201d</p><p>She frowned slightly. \u201cYou guys never hooked up did you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d My eyes went wide at the suggestion. \u201cGod, no.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cRelax. It was just a question.\u201d</p><p>Except it wasn\u2019t. It was an unwelcome reminder of the indiscretion that James and I had shared. Regret washed over me every time I thought of that weak moment outside the office. At the time, I had been convinced Blake was up to no good with Risa, not to mention his ex-girlfriend Sophia who had been ruthless in her pursuit of him. Everything was mixed up and confused. I didn\u2019t know what the future held until I found myself in James\u2019s arms, swept up in a kiss that quickly faded into the cold reality that if there would be any man in my future, Blake would be that man.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, hon? You look wiped out.\u201d</p><p>I looked up. \u201cI am. Just work stuff. Long story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant to give me the cliff notes tonight? You can break it down into layman\u2019s terms for me over a cocktail. You know I only understand half the shit you guys say anyway.\u201d</p><p>I gave a weak laugh. \u201cI\u2019m going out of town with Blake tonight, but maybe we could grab a quick drink before we leave. Do you care if he comes?\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019Course not. Now, what can I get you?\u201d</p><p>I ordered and took my time with my food. Most days I\u2019d rush through lunch to get back to work, but today I watched unhurried as people passed by the windows of the cafe, carrying on with their lives. A story hid behind every face, and I couldn\u2019t help but wonder if I could ever trust someone outside of our team again. Naively and against Blake\u2019s warnings, I\u2019d trusted Max\u2014enough to consider giving him ownership in my company before Blake funded the business instead. And Risa... she\u2019d been hungry, eager to learn and take on all the responsibility that I desperately needed to delegate, only to use all of it against me today.</p> <p>I fought the tears that threatened. If I\u2019d let them free, they\u2019d be full of anger at having let myself learn this lesson the hard way.</p><p>CHAPTER THREE</p><p>I scanned the bar for Simone. Not finding her, I chose a seat beside an empty stool. I flagged down the bartender, a little too eager for a cool drink to wash away the bullshit of my day.</p><p>As I waited for my drink, the five o\u2019clock news played out in silence on the screens above the bar. My heart thumped as Mark\u2019s face appeared, followed by footage of Daniel, presumably on the campaign trail. Along the bottom of the screen, the segment was captioned \u201cMacLeod death still under investigation.\u201d A sick feeling writhed in my gut. I wanted that chapter closed maybe as much as Daniel did now. I couldn\u2019t imagine what was still in question after Mark\u2019s apparent suicide. I wasn\u2019t sure I wanted to know either. I was about to ask the bartender to turn up the sound when someone came up beside me.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>I jumped slightly only to find James there offering me a tentative smile. He was wearing one of his graphic T-shirts that seemed to perfectly fit the tattooed man beneath.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I said. \u201cHi.\u201d</p><p>He raised his eyebrows. We hadn\u2019t really been alone, or remotely one-on-one for a long time. Work had carried on as usual, but we hadn\u2019t talked things through the way we should have. Everything that had been left unsaid weighed on me sometimes. I\u2019d been too wiped out from the drama of reuniting with Blake to really make time to sort it all out with James. Instead it lingered awkwardly between us, in the past but also never far from my thoughts when he was around.</p> <p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t expecting to see you here, sorry,\u201d I said, trying to excuse my awkwardness.</p><p>\u201cSimone didn\u2019t tell you I was coming?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head, hiding my surprised expression with a slow sip of my drink. I wondered where this was all going with Simone.</p><p>I shifted uncomfortably, as if I could feel his gaze on me, studying my reaction. Did he want me to be jealous? To show me that he\u2019d moved on? If so, all I wanted to convey was how happy I was that someone amazing like Simone held his interest. I hated to believe I\u2019d led him on in any way, encouraged feelings I had no right to encourage in my completely fucked up state of mind weeks ago.</p><p>\u201cHow are things with you two? Getting serious?\u201d I avoided his eyes, as if that could hide the fact that I was clearly fishing for confirmation.</p><p>He laughed quietly and shoved a hand through his wavy black hair, pushing it back away from his face as he stared down at the beer the bartender had just delivered.</p><p>\u201cSorry if I\u2019m not really up for talking girls with you, Erica. It just seems a little...strange, I guess, in light of everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d God, could this get any worse?</p><p>He smiled, disarming the moment a little. \u201cIt\u2019s fine. Anyway, Simone\u2019s your friend, right? I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll give you the dirt.\u201d</p><p>I returned his smile, a little relieved. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t really ask her about it. It\u2019s not my business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes she know about...us?\u201d He motioned between us, that small gesture signifying weeks of tension and dancing around an unexpected attraction that had cropped up.</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cI mean, kind of, but she knows I\u2019m with Blake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d He exhaled.</p><p>His relief gave me a little hope that he was more than a little interested in Simone. Maybe he didn\u2019t want her knowing about our little moment any more than I wanted Blake to. The prospect of Blake knowing roiled my stomach. He was jealous enough of James.</p><p>\u201cHow are you doing lately? You seemed pretty upset today.\u201d</p><p>James had a way of picking up on my moods, no matter how carefully I tried to hide them behind my flimsy partition. It would do no good to hide how I really felt or to pretend all was well. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m upset, I won\u2019t lie,\u201d I said. \u201cTo be honest, I wouldn\u2019t mind beating someone to a pulp right now. I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m more upset by Risa stabbing me in the back, or the effects all of this will have on the business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can imagine. You trusted her. Hell, we all did.\u201d</p><p>I stared at my drink. \u201cI feel so stupid. Like I should have seen this coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no way you could have known.\u201d</p> <p>I shrugged. \u201cMaybe. Maybe if I hadn\u2019t been so lost in my own head the past few weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll you did was work. I don\u2019t know how you could have been more present with the business. Seriously, you were sleeping at the office most nights.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head, my thoughts drifting to that time. A wave of fatigue hit me at the memory. I couldn\u2019t remember being more worn down, more determined to wear myself down than I had been. And somehow Risa had been conspiring with Max the whole time, even as I worked tirelessly to move us forward. The whole sequence of events spun in my head, over and over. Every rotation made less sense, gave me that much less faith that I could stop their attempts. What could I really do?</p><p>I systematically pushed the sweat of my drink down the glass, saturating the small napkin underneath. James rubbed my shoulder gently.</p><p>\u201cErica,\u201d he murmured.</p> <p>I looked up, my focus returning to the present as I transfixed on James\u2019s deep blue eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou have the rest of us, and you have me. You know we\u2019re solid, and we will get through this. Don\u2019t give her the satisfaction of knowing she\u2019s upset you. Give yourself a break this weekend, and we\u2019ll figure all this out next week. I know how you get and worrying yourself into a nervous breakdown isn\u2019t going to help anyone. We need you, remember?\u201d</p><p>I lifted my lips in a small smile. \u201cThanks, James.\u201d</p><p>\u201cErica.\u201d</p><p>A man\u2019s voice rang out behind me. A possessive hand curved around my upper arm. Blake stood close behind me, his gaze trained on James. The bitterness in his eyes seemed to radiate and reflect back onto him as James barely suppressed a sneer in his direction. I wanted to rise and stand between the two men, to shut down any potential standoff before it could escalate.</p><p>\u201cBlake.\u201d</p> <p>I doubted whether I\u2019d said the word out loud until Blake answered, his eyes never losing their focus on James.</p><p>\u201cWe should go. We\u2019re going to be late.\u201d</p><p>James\u2019s gaze went to Blake\u2019s hand circled possessively around my upper arm. James\u2019s jaw tightened and the muscles in his neck strained. That sick feeling washed over me again. He still believed Blake had hit me. I wanted to put that suspicion to rest, but I couldn\u2019t without revealing more information than he needed to know.</p><p>\u201cI thought we had time for a drink.\u201d</p><p>I put a hand over Blake\u2019s. His eyes flashed to mine, as if the small touch had broken a trance.</p><p>\u201cChange of plans,\u201d he said quickly.</p><p>I nodded and grabbed my purse, eager to diffuse this tension. I turned back to James and out of Blake\u2019s hold. \u201cI\u2019ll see you next week.\u201d</p><p>James nodded and turned away from me. I tensed, wishing I could say something to make all this go away. But Blake\u2019s jealousy and James\u2019s need to protect me against some imagined threat ran deep. Blake reached into his pocket and tossed a twenty-dollar bill on the bar, threaded his fingers through mine, and led me toward the entrance.</p> <p>\u201cWhat was the change of plans?\u201d</p><p>We stepped out and into the fading late afternoon sun. Before he could answer, Simone bounded up to us.</p><p>\u201cHey, where are you going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, Simone. We have to head out earlier than expected,\u201d Blake said.</p><p>\u201cJames is waiting for you though,\u201d I added cheerfully, gesturing toward the inside.</p><p>Her gaze flashed between us. \u201cOkay. Well, you two love birds have fun, okay?\u201d</p><p>I smiled shyly and let Blake guide me toward the idling Escalade at the curb. A second later, I stepped up into the vehicle captained by Clay, the bodyguard who Blake insisted on keeping more available lately.</p><p>I slid onto the cool leather seat next to Blake. Before I could say anything, he scooped me onto his lap and pressed his lips to mine. The kiss was urgent, intense as it had been the night before. He swept his tongue over my lips, urging me to part for him. I opened to him and reveled in the velvet push of his tongue over mine. With soft licks, he explored my mouth. Harnessing every wayward thought I\u2019d had, I turned my attention to the passion in his touch, the need I could nearly taste between us.</p><p>His scent filled my lungs as we shared breath. I sifted my fingers into his hair, angling him deeper, pulling him closer. The sweetness of his tongue lingered as we teased and nipped at each other\u2019s flesh. I stifled a moan, vaguely aware that we weren\u2019t entirely alone.</p><p>We separated enough to catch our breath. If we went much further, we\u2019d be devouring each other in no time.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d I said, realizing we hadn\u2019t yet said a single word since we\u2019d been in the car, which had been several minutes now.</p><p>\u201cHey yourself,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>His eyes were dark and determined. He slid his hand up my thigh up to my ass and grabbed me under my dress. I bit my lip, acutely aware of the ache between my legs and the wild desire he could inspire in me in a matter of minutes. I could think of nothing else but the fastest way to have him.</p><p>\u201cI have no idea where we\u2019re going, but it\u2019ll be a long drive at this rate.\u201d</p><p>He looked toward the front of the car. \u201cWe\u2019re not driving. Clay\u2019s taking us to the airport. I have a plane waiting for us there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI figured we\u2019d stay close, but I didn\u2019t want to spend half the night in traffic. We\u2019ll catch a flight to the Vineyard and be at the house within the hour. I didn\u2019t want to waste a minute more than we had to this weekend.\u201d</p><p>I grinned and met his lips for a sweet kiss. \u201cI can\u2019t wait.\u201d</p><p>A predictably small and sporty car was waiting for us when we disembarked and got us to our final destination as quickly as Blake\u2019s fancy Tesla would. We pulled up to the sprawling house at the far tip of the island. The small span of time and the miles of separation from day-to-day life sank in as we ascended the steps to the house. The warm ocean air was a welcome change from the muggy city heat. The relief was another reminder of how much I really needed a break.</p><p>Blake dropped our bags inside the door and turned to me. He pressed against me as I wove my arms around his neck. He slid his hands down the fabric of my dress until he reached the hem and pushed it up. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI missed the hell out of you today,\u201d he said, his grip tightening on my hip.</p><p>\u201cI missed you too. I always do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll warn you, though, I\u2019m not feeling very patient. Want you fast and hard. Can you take that, baby?\u201d</p><p>I gasped, fire rushing over my skin with the promise. Flexing and releasing, he pushed me back against the door. Without waiting for an answer, he hooked his thumbs over my panties and slid them down.</p> <p>\u201cI want in you now.\u201d</p><p>My breath rushed out, heat flushing my skin all the way to my cheeks. My heart fluttered with anticipation. I shrugged out of my dress and he separated long enough to let it fall. Then he was back, his mouth at my breast, sucking hard. One, and then the next. I whimpered when his teeth came down around the sensitive tip. There wasn\u2019t a cell in my body that didn\u2019t want him to deliver on his promises now.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>I fumbled with his shirt, tugging it over his head. He unzipped his pants, freeing his full erection before it fell heavily in his hands. I bit my lip hard. He wouldn\u2019t wait a moment longer to claim me.</p><p>He hooked my leg over his hip and positioned himself at my entrance. He pushed in slow, letting me accommodate him gradually, retreating again only to push deeper. By the time he filled me completely, I\u2019d grown slick around him.</p> <p>My head fell back against the door with a small cry.</p><p>\u201cBlake.\u201d</p><p>My core pulsed around his thick penetration. We stayed that way, breathless, connected, desire shooting through my veins. I dug my fingernails into his side, pulling him closer, deeper.</p><p>\u201cFuck, you feel amazing. I thought about this all day, being buried deep inside you. Your body tight around me, coming hard all over my cock. All fucking day, I haven\u2019t been able to think about anything else.\u201d He pinned me harder, pushing in deeper as he did.</p><p>I gasped. \u201cMore.\u201d</p><p>With the small plea, he cupped his hands under my ass, lifting me so my legs wrapped around him. He leveraged me against the wall. The weight of my body combined with the strength of his had us joined tightly. I was tense with anticipation and just as relieved by the welcome sensation of having him there, our bodies united again. It had only been hours, and the tender flesh between my thighs did nothing to lessen my craving for him.</p> <p>I held his face in my hands, the stubble from the day rough on my palms. He looked deep into my eyes. Lust, love, and that intense possessiveness swam in those green depths, taking my breath away all over again.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re mine, Erica.\u201d</p><p>As the words hit my ears, he pushed upward. I clenched around him instantly, gasping at the bite of discomfort. He was deep, impossibly deep.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m yours,\u201d I breathed.</p><p>\u201cIf I have to remind every man who stares too long, who thinks for a second he could have you, I\u2019ll do it.\u201d</p><p>He surged up again. The friction of our bodies and his tension took over my senses. As urgently as he wanted to claim me, I wanted to be claimed. I closed my eyes, the promise of orgasm suddenly close. Muscles tense, I tightened around him helplessly.</p><p>My voice wavered, strangled by the rush of his powerful thrusts, one following the next in rapid succession now. His name filled the air between us, again and again as I begged for more. I clenched down around him, reveling in the friction as it unraveled me, stroke by stroke.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll know it. Goddamnit. He\u2019ll know you belong to me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe knows, Blake. I\u2019m yours... I\u2019ve always been yours.\u201d I opened my eyes, desire blurring my vision. \u201cMake me yours, Blake.\u201d</p><p>I ran a hand through his hair and gripped at the roots. Silenced with our kiss, he groaned. He shoved my hips against the hard wood of the door as he drove into me. In seconds I was drunk on his taste, lost. Lost in him, flying high on this feeling, surrendering to it completely. He took me fiercely, love and desperation passing through every touch. We climbed together, in a rush for the release that would bring us together in the only way that mattered right now.</p><p>\u201cBlake...oh, God. Oh, fuck.\u201d</p><p>The grip of my thighs around him weakened as the climax crept up, taking hold of my mind. I couldn\u2019t think of anything but Blake, this love. He was the answer when nothing else in my life seemed right. This made sense. I needed this, him, in a way that made no sense and perfect sense.</p><p>\u201cNow,\u201d he gritted out.</p><p>The simple word pushed me over. My mouth opened with a soundless cry as the orgasm took its hold. I clung to him, my focus pinpointed on the throb of his cock plunging into me, guiding me over the edge to that perfect place. A few more powerful thrusts and I came with a scream. He dug into me, his grip rough, until every muscle went taut, his body buried deeply within me.</p><p>\u201cErica!\u201d</p><p>His voice was hoarse, sounding as stripped down as I felt. Arms holding me closer, as if I\u2019d disappear if he didn\u2019t, he caught his breath, brushing his lips along my neck.</p><p>All my strength left with the orgasm, a fact that became evident when he finally loosened his embrace. When my feet found the floor, my legs wobbled. He held me steady, hands at my hips, as he slipped out of me. Warm release dripped down my thigh with his retreat. I went to move, but he stilled me so I was held firmly in place. His gaze riveted on the translucent line it trailed down my skin.</p><p>\u201cFuck, baby. Seeing that just makes me want to fill you up again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to make a mess on your floor.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cWe might have to make a mess all over the house then, because I\u2019m still hard. I\u2019m wrecked, but all I can think about right now is coming in you again. All fucking night.\u201d</p><p>A delirious smile spread across my face. \u201cYou going to keep me up two nights in a row? You\u2019ll wear us both out at this rate.\u201d</p><p>He smiled and hauled me back into his arms, brushing a soft kiss over my lips.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re on vacation, remember? I can make love to you all night and we can sleep all day. Not a damn thing anyone\u2019s going to say about it either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo house guests,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>\u201cThank God. I\u2019m not sharing you with anyone until Tuesday morning.\u201d</p><p>He moved away, zipping his pants up. Then he lifted me into his arms, taking us to the bedroom and into its adjoining bathroom.</p><p>We showered, lathering each other. We stepped out and Blake wrapped me in a fluffy white towel and dried my hair with another. The heat of the shower might have wiped the last of our energy. We collapsed into the bed, weakened by the day, by our lovemaking.</p><p>I cuddled up to him, enjoying the closeness, our skin clean and smooth against each other. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI love you, Blake.\u201d</p><p>He tipped my chin up so I met his gaze.</p><p>\u201cI love you too.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER FOUR</p> <p>I opened my eyes, and the world came into focus. Propped up on his elbow, Blake raked me in with a lazy smile across his lips.</p><p>I stretched, curious how long we\u2019d slept. A glide of his hand down the side of my torso sent a tingle of awareness through me. I hummed, leaning against him, all too aware of my nakedness and the mere sheet covering his. His eyes gleamed with pure appreciation and the love that hummed between us. Love. It bloomed in small moments like this, making all the good times that much better, all the tough times worth working through. What I felt for this man took my breath away.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so beautiful in the morning,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>I tried to hide my smile, turning to the pillow. \u201cStop.\u201d</p><p>He brushed the hair off my cheek and kissed me there, lingering by my ear. \u201cI\u2019ll never stop. As long as I live, I\u2019ll never stop.\u201d</p> <p>I arched to kiss him, melting so easily for him. I took it all in, let it soak into my skin down to my bones. This new freedom, being away with the man I loved so desperately.</p><p>I settled back down, nuzzled against his arm. A part of me was still groggy, like I could sleep for days. I\u2019d recognized that in his tired eyes last night too. I sensed he had been struggling lately, but I still had no idea why. As close as we could be, physically, I hated that distance that crept between us at times. That wall that he kept up, usually to keep me safe.</p><p>I traced the ridge of his lower lip with my finger. \u201cI want you to be able to tell me anything. Do you feel like you can?\u201d</p><p>He raised an eyebrow. \u201cYes, why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel like you\u2019ve been...I don\u2019t know, tense, lately. I wish you would tell me why.\u201d</p><p>He released a breath, caught my hands, and pressed a kiss to my fingertips. \u201cIt\u2019s not a matter of being comfortable sharing anything with you. I know that I can. It\u2019s more whether or not I decide to burden you with whatever I\u2019m dealing with.\u201d</p> <p>I waited until his eyes locked with mine, wanting to show him I meant what I said. \u201cYou\u2019re not burdening me. Not knowing what\u2019s bothering you is more of a burden. I never know if it\u2019s me, or if there\u2019s something I could be doing to help.\u201d</p><p>His expression changed, masking whatever emotions brewed below the surface. \u201cYou can\u2019t help with this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith what? Just tell me.\u201d</p><p>He sighed and leaned back into the pillow. \u201cYou really want to talk about Max? Not exactly a pleasant topic of conversation.\u201d</p><p>I frowned. Curiosity over what Max was up to now burned through me. \u201cWhat is he doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not really doing anything, but that doesn\u2019t keep him from being an impressive pain in my ass. I\u2019ve been trying to get him off the Angelcom board since I found out he was funding Trevor to attack my\u2014our\u2014sites.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t that be easy? You\u2019re the executive director.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am, but this is more like a democracy versus a dictatorship, which I\u2019m somewhat regretting now. I can\u2019t just kick him out. I have to run these decisions by a board. The majority won\u2019t agree to vote him out.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy? Isn\u2019t that a no-brainer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey don\u2019t want to piss off Michael, Max\u2019s father. He\u2019s got more money than God, and risking any potential connection with him isn\u2019t worth penalizing Max\u2019s complete and utter lack of ethics.\u201d</p><p>I stared at him, contemplating this frustrating circumstance. No wonder Blake was ready to burst every night lately. To have to tolerate the man who had spent years trying to undermine him, with no support from his colleagues, was hard to imagine. At least the people on my team were on my team, and there was never any question who the enemy was. Well, at least now that Risa was gone. I was still struggling to quell my lingering paranoia that I couldn\u2019t trust anyone after I\u2019d trusted her with everything, confidential information that she was now using against me. Still, Clozpin was a far cry from white-collar investors and the corporate circles many of them ran in.</p><p>\u201cAre you so surprised?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean, the premise of Angelcom is to make more money for people who already have mountains of it. Seems like those kinds of people have it because they\u2019re in the habit of amassing and protecting it. Would you expect them to act any differently than they have?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI suppose not. It\u2019s pretty ironic though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe company is infested with the greedy fucks I\u2019d wanted to take down in the first place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do now? If they won\u2019t vote him out, what other recourse do you have?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t decided my next move yet. I\u2019m not sure how Michael would react if I approached him with what\u2019s going on. If I could get him to understand, I could get the support of the board and make sure Max didn\u2019t get near another boardroom of mine ever again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you and Michael were close.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are. At least we were at one point. I haven\u2019t seen him in a while, and understandably, I don\u2019t want our next meeting to be me telling him that his son is a fraud and a cheat.\u201d</p><p>I traced a path over his chest as it moved with each breath. My beautiful man. I hated that we had to deal with people like Max, like Trevor. Jesus, the list went on.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really sorry, Blake. It\u2019s a shitty situation. But you\u2019ll find a way through it. You always do. And someone like Max can\u2019t keep going around stomping on people\u2019s dreams and get away with it forever. At least I hope not.\u201d</p><p>As angry as Blake was with Max, I wasn\u2019t sure this was the best time to tell him about his and Risa\u2019s new site and how it threatened me now.</p><p>He tipped my chin up. Our eyes met. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>I hesitated before I began. \u201cMax and Risa launched their little venture. A competing site. Total rip off of Clozpin, and it looks like they took at least one of our major advertisers with them. Who knows how many users.\u201d</p><p>His eyebrows shot up. \u201cWhen were you going to tell me this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlli told me about it yesterday. She wanted me to be the one to tell you. And frankly I needed some time to make sense of it. I don\u2019t know if I have though. I\u2019m mostly feeling like they\u2019re going to systematically destroy my business with the same determination that they went after you. Except I\u2019m not you. I don\u2019t have your resources or your experience. I\u2019m still trying to figure out how to run a company. I wasn\u2019t expecting to go on the defensive like this in the midst of our growth. First Trevor, and now this. I\u2019m trying not to feel hopeless about all of it, but it\u2019s kind of hard not to.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cTrust me, he\u2019s not going to destroy your business. I won\u2019t let him. And as hate-filled as they are, the two of them are no match for the two of us.\u201d He brushed my cheek with his knuckles. \u201cIt hurts, but it\u2019s business. You can\u2019t lose faith. That\u2019s what they want. If I gave up every time someone took a sucker punch at me professionally, I\u2019d have been done long ago. You\u2019re too strong for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just can\u2019t believe someone could be so devious, so hateful. I couldn\u2019t imagine ever wanting to do this to someone, anyone, no matter how much I despised him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate to say this, but get used to it. As soon as you start to do well, someone will want to take that shine away from the things you do, lessen it or make it their own.\u201d</p><p>My eyes went wide. \u201cYou\u2019re not making me feel so hopeful about a future in entrepreneurship.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ll toughen up. And you have me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what can we do? We have no control over what they\u2019re doing. This feels like sabotage, but I\u2019m totally powerless over it.\u201d</p><p>He was silent a moment, as if he were strategically thinking his way through this one. \u201cWell, I could always hack their site.\u201d The corner of his mouth lifted.</p><p>I rolled my eyes. \u201cGreat. Dueling hackers. I think we can both agree that solves nothing. Beyond that, it\u2019s beneath you.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cIs it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou said you only use your powers for good, remember? Even if they are terrible, I can\u2019t see you destroying their site.\u201d</p><p>He pursed his lips. \u201cMaybe you\u2019re right.\u201d He wrapped an arm around me and brought me down to him, kissing me gently. \u201cNo more talk of Max. This weekend is for us. What do you want to do?\u201d</p><p>I glanced at the clock; it was nearly lunchtime. Our schedule was all kinds of mixed up. Time didn\u2019t really matter when it was just Blake and me.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want to do?\u201d</p><p>His eyes darkened with a knowing smile. \u201cIf it were up to me, we\u2019d never leave the bed.\u201d</p><p>I pushed myself up and straddled him. \u201cWe didn\u2019t come all this way to stay in bed all day.\u201d</p> <p>He groaned, raking over my nakedness. \u201cYou\u2019re not making a very good argument for leaving.\u201d</p><p>He followed the path with his hands, palming my breasts and teasing my nipples into hardened points. The carnal appreciation in his stare warmed me instantly. I ached for his mouth, squirming despite myself.</p><p>As if he could see my resolve melting away, he cupped my ass and ground me down against the hard erection that strained through the sheets between us. I bit my lip and rolled into the motion, seduced by the unavoidable truth that I wanted what he wanted, and just as badly. My head fell back as the contact rubbed over my clit in just the right way. Fire licked over my skin, heating me through to my core.</p><p>He lifted me with his hips, ripping away the sheet the separated us. His cock was as hard as I\u2019d imagined, thick and ready for me. More than ready. His narrowed gaze told me refusal was a lost cause. Finding the slick heat between my legs, he fingered me gently.</p><p>\u201cAlways ready for me,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>Answering the silent pleas my body gave, he lowered me down onto the rigid length of his cock. I gasped at the depth, the sharp edge that we always seemed to walk with each other.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it, baby. Take all of me.\u201d</p><p>My eyes fell shut as I gave myself over to it. All my senses tuned in to the way our bodies fit, all the ways this man owned my pleasure.</p> <p>We left the privacy of the house and wandered into town. The island buzzed with activity. We wasted the rest of the afternoon perusing shops, trying to avoid the now unavoidable throngs of summer tourists. We talked, but never about work. We laughed, always touching in some way. I needed it, and maybe he did too, because I couldn\u2019t remember a moment when we weren\u2019t connected. Most of the time we were simply together, without words, but in the comfort of being with each other.</p><p>We\u2019d been ravenous for each other lately, some all-consuming hunger that only grew stronger once sated. I needed him. And that need pulsed through me every waking hour. In the background of my days, in the demands of our nights, and in the quiet wordless moments that we shared in between. I\u2019d lost all control over it, and I\u2019d given up trying to harness it. We\u2019d spent too much time apart. I couldn\u2019t deny any fleeting chances to be together.</p><p>From the day Blake derailed my presentation months ago, he\u2019d captivated something in me. What had grown between us since I could no longer be without. Maybe he felt the same way, and that ever present need\u2014to touch, to hold, to be lost in each other through the long nights\u2014was a manifestation of that nameless emotion between us.</p><p>Between our afternoon romp, the activities in town, and the fresh air on the island, I was exhausted by the time we pulled up to the house. I shivered when we stepped into the cool air. I much preferred the breezy summer air over the climate control of the indoors. I\u2019d spent too many months cold, yearning for summer. The warm sun was not something to waste.</p><p>Always so in tune, Blake rubbed my arms, coaxing some warmth into the chill that had worked its way over me.</p><p>\u201cAre you hungry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little, yeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo relax on the deck. I\u2019ll grab something for us to eat.\u201d</p><p>I agreed and stepped out onto the deck that gave an unobstructed view of the ocean beyond. I sank into one of the Adirondacks and propped my feet on a stool. I closed my eyes and let the warm breeze dance over my skin as the sun set. The sounds of ocean waves lapping against the sandy shore might have lulled me to sleep if I\u2019d been alone a few minutes longer.</p><p>Blake joined me then, setting a plate with cheeses, crackers, and meats on a table. He poured white wine into two glasses and handed me one.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I said.</p><p>His eyes glittering warmly. I met his smile, wondering what had inspired that look since I saw him moments ago. \u201cYou\u2019re happy.\u201d</p><p>He sat back, smirking before taking a drink. \u201cI am very happy. You have that effect on me, you know.\u201d</p><p>My heart sang. I tipped the glass, and as the fruity liquid hit my tongue, I knew this had been a great idea. Three days of peace and quiet with Blake was already pure heaven. I relaxed into the chair.</p><p>\u201cThis is amazing, Blake. I could stay out here forever. It\u2019s so peaceful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCareful what you wish for. I\u2019ll have us moved out here by the week\u2019s end.\u201d</p><p>I laughed. \u201cNo kidding. I can\u2019t make a wish without you rushing in to make it come true.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His eyes held me steady, serious in their depth. The humor in my words faded away when I thought about what a gift he was to me. I took a breath, suddenly overwhelmed by that truth. What had I done to deserve such an amazing man to call my own?</p><p>\u201cYou know there\u2019s no way I can thank you for everything you do for me. I kid, but seriously, how can I ever repay you for all the wonderful things you\u2019ve done?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2019ll think of something.\u201d He nodded to my glass. \u201cDrink up.\u201d</p><p>I sighed and took a long sip. I nearly spit the liquid out when something hard fell against my lips. I swallowed quickly and looked inside the glass.</p> <p>Oh my God.</p><p>I straightened, planting my feet on the ground, though nothing could ground me for what I was seeing. I stared stupidly into the glass, frozen and vaguely aware that Blake had moved to kneel at my feet. His palms brushed along the sides of my bare thighs up to my shorts.</p><p>\u201cBreathe, baby.\u201d</p><p>I inhaled on command, my eyes unable to shift from the shiny diamond-studded ring that rested in the empty well of my glass. I couldn\u2019t think. I could barely breathe.</p><p>\u201cThis hasn\u2019t been a one-way street. You\u2019ve given me just as much as I\u2019ve given you. You\u2019ve loved me at times when I haven\u2019t made it so easy for you to... Erica, honey, look at me.\u201d</p> <p>I swallowed over the tight prickle in my throat. Tears burned my eyes as I met his warm gaze. \u201cThis is crazy,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>\u201cThis might be crazy, but this is our life, and I want to spend it with you, as your husband. I want to come home to you and know you\u2019ll always be there. I want to make love to you every night and wake up with you every morning for the rest of my life.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head in disbelief, tears falling. I searched for words, but none came.</p><p>He brushed away the wetness on my cheeks and reached for my glass. Tipping it, he retrieved the ring and set the glass away. He grasped my hand gently and looked up at me.</p><p>\u201cErica, will you marry me?\u201d</p><p>I stared into his eyes, now green and bright in the fading daylight. Time stood still as the question echoed in my mind, as the enormity of what he was asking me sank in. Could this be real? Could he really mean it?</p> <p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>He smiled. Somehow he\u2019d never looked so gorgeous. \u201cYes, I\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre we rushing into this? That\u2019s what everyone\u2019s going to say.\u201d</p><p>His eyes widened a fraction. \u201cWe\u2019ve been through enough to fill a lifetime. I don\u2019t need any more time to know you\u2019re the one I want to be with. And I seriously don\u2019t give a damn what anyone else has to say about it. Neither should you.\u201d</p><p>I looked past him to the steady ebb and flow of the ocean. Our little paradise had become that much more surreal. To be Blake\u2019s wife, to tie our lives together, irrevocably. I\u2019d thought of it, of course. I\u2019d tried not to read into his insinuations about a future of forever. Deep down that was what I wanted too, though. As much as the prospect terrified me when I thought about what it really meant, I did want forever with Blake. He brushed his thumb over the skin above my knuckle, sending a rush to my heart. I loved this man, and I couldn\u2019t believe anything would ever change that.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I said quietly.</p><p>He cocked an eyebrow. \u201cOkay?\u201d</p><p>I smiled. \u201cYes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>I laughed softly. \u201cYes, I\u2019m sure. I\u2014I want to marry you. I love you, Blake. How could I say anything but yes?\u201d</p><p>His face split with a smile. He slipped the sparkling band over my knuckle and into place, pressing a kiss where it sat. He stood, bringing me with him and into his arms. We were wrapped together so tightly, I could scarcely take a breath.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Erica. You\u2019ll never understand how much, but I\u2019m going to try like hell to show you.\u201d</p><p>I held him back and the reality of our promise settled over me, warming me from limb to limb. Our love filled me, until I thought my heart might explode with it.</p><p>In that moment, I knew I could never love anyone the way I loved Blake.</p><p>CHAPTER FIVE</p><p>The rest of the weekend flew by. Blake took us out on the water, jetting us to outlying islands where we basked in the sun and listened to the steady rush of the ocean water until we were too tired or hungry to stay longer. We explored every quiet corner of the island. We ate and drank and made love. We talked and made promises. Every minute was like its own little paradise.</p><p>This commitment between us still felt new, like a dream. But so was being on the island, isolated from our real world. Every time my eyes lit on the sparkle of the band on my finger, my heart leapt. It was a brilliant and overwhelming reminder of Blake\u2019s love. Both thrilled and apprehensive of what it meant for our future, I couldn\u2019t help but fantasize about our happily ever after.</p><p>\u201cDo you like the ring?\u201d</p><p>I looked up at Blake, who\u2019d caught me admiring it as our plane approached Boston\u2019s dusky skyline. \u201cI love it. It\u2019s simple.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can pick out something bigger if you want. I took a risk with it. I wasn\u2019t sure what you\u2019d want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I want this. It\u2019s perfect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He grinned and squeezed my hand gently. \u201cWe\u2019ll put another one next to it, and then I\u2019ll know I have you for good.\u201d</p><p>I envisioned its companion, and the meaning struck me.</p><p>\u201cLike the bracelets.\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have me cuffed and bound to you forever, Blake. You sure you want that?\u201d</p><p>He leaned in, taking my lips in a gentle kiss. \u201cThat\u2019s the idea.\u201d</p><p>My heart twisted. A tiny flutter of nerves hit my belly at the thought of being Blake\u2019s forever. His wife.</p><p>As our plane floated toward Logan Airport, I regretted that we were returning so soon. The break had been amazing but short-lived. I was still high on it, but less pleasant realities waited for both of us. Whatever trouble came our way, we\u2019d face it together. I\u2019d made Blake a promise that we always would. No more running and no more trying to be strong on my own. Fighting my own independent nature wasn\u2019t easy, but sharing my life, the good and the bad, was more important now than ever.</p><p>When we stepped into the apartment, Alli met me with a squeal and tight hug. I laughed and hugged her back. The happiness of having my best friend so close compounded with this news, warming me.</p><p>Heath\u2019s hand slapped Blake\u2019s in a shake. \u201cCongrats, man.\u201d</p><p>A small smile spread across Blake\u2019s face. \u201cThanks.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Heath\u2019s focus shifted to me and he pulled me into a tight hug. \u201cErica, future sister-in-law. You have no idea what you\u2019re getting into with this one, but more power to you.\u201d</p><p>I laughed and pushed him back playfully. The two men wandered into the living room and talked while Alli all but dragged me toward the kitchen so she could inspect the ring. She studied it for several seconds as the light danced off the diamonds. I smiled, thrilled all over again that he\u2019d asked, that I\u2019d agreed. Without even having had the chance to fantasize about what that moment between us might be like, I\u2019d known immediately it was what I wanted.</p><p>Alli ran a thumb over the band, one eyebrow raised. \u201cThis is different.\u201d</p><p>I shrugged, not quite sure what to say. I wasn\u2019t about to tell her that the bracelets he\u2019d given me months ago doubled as handcuffs, and this ring held a similar symbolism. \u201cDifferent, but it\u2019s us. I love it. Plus, how am I supposed to work on a computer all day with some huge rock on my finger?\u201d</p> <p>She leaned back against the counter, her gaze lifting from the ring to my eyes for the first time in several minutes. She studied me then, with almost as much intrigue as she\u2019d studied my diamonds.</p><p>\u201cSo if I know you, your mind must be going a million miles an hour with all this.\u201d</p><p>I laughed. \u201cA little. I\u2019m just...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>I sighed. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I think I\u2019m still in shock that he wants this, you know, to make things permanent.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBlake is crazy about you. You know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was an easy decision to make. Obviously I\u2019m head over heels for him too. Not like he would have taken no for an answer anyway.\u201d I laughed to myself, trying to imagine what lengths he would have gone to get the answer he wanted.</p><p>While my thoughts ran away from me, Alli smiled broadly and bounced a little. \u201cI\u2019m so happy for you, Erica! I\u2019ve been freaking out all weekend. Heath told me after you left, and I\u2019ve been dying to see you again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had no idea,\u201d I said, admiring Blake\u2019s gift, his promise.</p><p>\u201cThis can\u2019t have been the first time you\u2019ve talked about marriage.\u201d</p><p>My eyebrows shot up. \u201cWhy, have you?\u201d</p> <p>A flush reddened her cheeks. \u201cI\u2019m not talking about me. I\u2019m talking about you. Usually people talk about marriage before proposing. Test the waters and what not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe mentioned it once, kind of in jest I think, but I told him he was crazy. And I meant it. I still think this is all kind of crazy. I\u2019m scared to death, but I want to be with him. If this is what he wants and it needs to be now, so be it.\u201d</p><p>The whole prospect was overwhelming and unexpected. I loved Blake without condition, but solidifying our relationship with marriage was something I wasn\u2019t considering as a possibility for years more.</p><p>Marriage, to me, implied stability, something sure and reliable. Happily ever after and all good things. Conversely, very little in my life felt stable right now except my love for Blake. Despite his reassurances, the future of the business would worry me deeply until I knew it was safe along with everyone\u2019s jobs.</p><p>Clozpin was so much more than a job, and seeing it successful was more than a short-term goal. I needed it to work, for so many reasons. If it didn\u2019t, I\u2019d be even more dependent on Blake\u2019s wealth and security. While I appreciated that he would be that for me and never make me feel less for it, the idea of being completely dependent on someone else was unsettling.</p><p>\u201cSo have you thought of a date? A venue?\u201d</p><p>I laughed at Alli\u2019s enthusiasm but also fought a wave of anxiety at sorting out all those details. When on earth would I have time for that? Did his family expect something big? I\u2019d been so overwhelmed with the proposal, I hadn\u2019t even thought to ask Blake what his thoughts were on the matter. I was still trying to wrap my head around the basic concept of marriage.</p><p>\u201cI seriously have no idea what we\u2019re going to do or when.\u201d</p> <p>Alli\u2019s big brown eyes were wide and expectant.</p><p>\u201cBut of course I could use your help,\u201d I added quickly.</p><p>She smiled and bounced again. I laughed at her boundless enthusiasm. She was going to be an invaluable resource on all things wedding. If anyone could pull it off, Alli could.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the one who should be getting married. You probably have the whole thing planned out already.\u201d My voice was hushed, and I looked behind my shoulder quickly to make sure Heath hadn\u2019t heard me.</p><p>\u201cI might, but I\u2019ll settle for planning yours for now. Who knows when or if we\u2019ll ever get around to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like you two have actually talked about it though?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged and leaned her hip against the counter. \u201cA little, but that\u2019s a huge step. We know we\u2019re not quite ready for that. I do have some more good news for you though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d My eyebrows lifted with curiosity.</p><p>\u201cHeath and I found a new place. It\u2019s pretty close, but I\u2019m sure Blake will be psyched to have his apartment back. We\u2019re going to start moving things over this week, so Mr. Broody won\u2019t need to share you with me anymore.\u201d She smiled and poked my shoulder.</p><p>I smiled, happy for her and for us. \u201cYou must be excited.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am. It\u2019s the first time we\u2019ll be getting a place together, that\u2019s ours. It\u2019s already vacant, so we should be moved over completely in a few days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s awesome. Let me know if I can help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. You focus on work. I know you have plenty to catch up on at the office, but pencil me in for dinner next week. Heath wants to invite the family over to see the new place. Plus I\u2019m sure everyone will want to talk wedding details, so that will be fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I agreed weakly.</p><p>The knot in my stomach grew at the mention of Blake\u2019s family. I loved them, but they were a little overwhelming sometimes. Was there such a thing as being too nice, caring too much? Maybe by comparison to my family. The thought of inviting the Hathaways into my life to celebrate this occasion was unsettling at best. They\u2019d done little more than shun my mother since the day she told them she was pregnant with me. Would they shun me now too, or feign interest and attend as if they\u2019d cared at all my whole life? Either scenario seemed stressful, but I didn\u2019t want to deprive Blake\u2019s family of an occasion that might mean the world to them. Heaven help me, our two families could not be more different. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>To avoid further inquisition, I pulled Alli back into the living room and we chatted away the rest of the evening with the guys. I relaxed into Blake\u2019s side, grateful, in love, and determined to make the most of the last few hours of our break away from the world.</p><p>The office had been quiet this week, save the quiet hum of machines and tapping of keyboards as people worked. I was doing some quick math when my phone rang. Daniel\u2019s number lit up the screen. For the first time in weeks I considered answering. As soon as I reestablished contact with him, the battle to maintain a healthy separation between our lives and business affairs would begin. I hadn\u2019t felt up to it, and after learning that two more advertisers would be closing their accounts with us since PinDeelz launched, I wasn\u2019t sure why I would be now. Perhaps out of sheer desperation to occupy my mind with something other than the downward spiral of my business, I answered.</p><p>\u201cDaniel, hi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi. I wasn\u2019t sure you\u2019d answer.\u201d</p> <p>I wanted to be honest in my response, but I also didn\u2019t want to piss him off. I\u2019d really hoped this next chapter of our relationship wouldn\u2019t be so contentious. I wasn\u2019t sure if I could survive it if it was. Daniel Fitzgerald had proven himself to be both violent and dangerous, but I forced myself to believe I could harness the man behind the political machine, behind the layers of societal pressure to be all that he\u2019d become. Despite all my misgivings, something inside me was committed to salvage what I could from our warped father-daughter relationship.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been out of town,\u201d I said, offering a half-truth. \u201cHow are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe campaign has been doing well, so I can\u2019t complain. How about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, good.\u201d</p><p>His silence extended over the next few seconds, and I felt an odd pressure to fill it.</p> <p>\u201cBlake and I are engaged.\u201d</p><p>He paused. \u201cI suppose congratulations are in order.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d My voice was small. I had hard time believing he was genuinely happy for me, when he was the reason why Blake and I had spent the most agonizing weeks of my life apart. The separation had almost ruined us.</p><p>\u201cAssuming you haven\u2019t forgotten about the campaign work we discussed,\u201d he said.</p><p>I inhaled, steeling myself to hold my ground.</p><p>\u201cI needed some time, Daniel, after everything. But no, I haven\u2019t forgotten.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHave you had enough time then? Can we meet to discuss? Time is running down on the clock, and your contribution is still important. I\u2019m not taking anything for granted with this race.\u201d</p><p>I tapped my pen, my thoughts swirling around my own business problems. \u201cMaybe. When did you want to meet?\u201d The last thing I wanted to admit was the state of the business. That could open a door to him pushing me to work for him permanently. I couldn\u2019t imagine any worse punishment for failing at entrepreneurship than being forced into that arrangement.</p><p>\u201cMaybe next week we can get lunch and meet at the headquarters after. Will has some things to update you on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee you then. And congratulations again, Erica. I\u2019m happy for you.\u201d</p><p>I frowned, words catching in my throat. \u201cThank you,\u201d I finally managed.</p><p>I hung up and stared at my phone. Perhaps I\u2019d never be able to figure Daniel out. Or perhaps this was the beginning of having his trust, and maybe of him earning mine.</p><p>The rest of the day whittled away in a flurry of tasks, large and small, until my energy was thoroughly battered. I glanced at the clock and considered packing up so I could have a few extra minutes to get ready for dinner with Marie, my mother\u2019s best friend, and her boyfriend Richard later. Sid stepped into my office and interrupted the thought.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d I craned my neck to look up at him.</p><p>He folded his thin frame into a seat across from my desk. \u201cI was wondering if you had a few minutes to talk.\u201d</p><p>I tensed, imagining the worst. The site was wrecked, or he\u2019d found another job and given up on Clozpin. \u201cIs everything okay?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cOther than the fact that we\u2019re losing advertisers and user engagement is slowing. Are we going to sit by and watch this happen?\u201d</p><p>I relaxed slightly, but the tone of his question put me on the defensive. \u201cWhat do you want me to do, Sid? I have no control over Risa\u2019s site or the lengths they go to undermine us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d He regarded me quietly with his big brown eyes.</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, why don\u2019t you focus on things that you can control instead of obsessing over what they\u2019re doing? They aren\u2019t going away any time soon, and if your strategy is to sit idly by hoping they do, we\u2019re not going to last long. Sites like ours come and go every day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re maintaining, Sid. All hope is not lost.\u201d I worked to believe the words.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t sign on to maintain. There\u2019s no reason why we can\u2019t grow. Diversify.\u201d</p><p>I frowned. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean we should up the ante. They\u2019ve duplicated our concept, and if that\u2019s all they know how to do, they\u2019ll be the ones who falter. I think we need to start thinking outside the box. What can we do to make the site better?\u201d</p><p>I threw my hands up. \u201cI\u2019ve thought of little else for days, believe me. I mean, I have some ideas but nothing revolutionary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you\u2019re thinking too small. You have all these connections now, right? What about a partnership? Maybe we need to take another look at those kinds of opportunities.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t need money. Blake invested.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I\u2019m talking about. I\u2019m talking about broadening our target market. Take your brain out of the small service that we\u2019re providing and consider what we could do on a larger scale.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, humbled by the suggestion. \u201cYou could be onto something. Do you have any ideas?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m not really a twenty something female. I just feel like we\u2019re looking at the problem from the wrong angle. You\u2019re the one who came up with this concept, and I think if you can get past the panic and forget about what PinDeelz is doing, you can take us to the next level. Put them in the rearview.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Sid. I\u2019ll think about it, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Let me know if I can help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d I leaned back into my chair. \u201cHow is Cady?\u201d</p>  </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGood. We\u2019re good.\u201d His cheeks reddened.</p><p>I fought a smile. \u201cI\u2019m glad to hear it.\u201d</p><p>He unfolded himself from the chair quickly. \u201cI\u2019m taking off. I\u2019ll see you tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>I waved him off and got lost in thought. I doodled on my notepad until the loss of revenue I\u2019d tallied a few minutes earlier was surrounded with an ornate design. Maybe Sid was right. Why couldn\u2019t the answers be easier to find? Every major decision I\u2019d made lately seemed to be reactionary. What happened to the time when we were driven by ideas, not survival? We\u2019d secured the finances from Blake to grow and carry on, but if I didn\u2019t figure my way through this, his investment would dwindle quickly. I cringed at the thought of failing him. He\u2019d opened so many doors for me, and all for what?</p> <p>I was about to give up when a thought occurred to me. I shuffled through my desk drawer until I found a card. I took a deep breath to calm my nerves and dialed the number on it.</p><p>We stepped into the cool air of Abe and Louie\u2019s, the heavy door closing out the light that flowed in with our entrance. My arm hooked around Blake\u2019s. The steak house\u2019s ma\u00eetre d\u2019 disappeared to prepare our table, and Blake turned me, pinning me to his chest. My breath hitched at the sudden contact, our closeness in plain view of anyone nearby.</p><p>\u201cBring back anything?\u201d</p><p>I smiled as the memory of our first chance meeting came back to me. Even then, he\u2019d taken my breath away.</p><p>\u201cA few. I was ready to haul you into a coat closet and kiss that smirk off your face.\u201d</p> <p>He hummed, tracing my lower lip. The hunger in his eyes had my heart beating against my chest. \u201cNot too late for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue. But I don\u2019t want to get kicked out before Marie gets here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think they\u2019ll kick us out for this?\u201d</p><p>I sucked in a sharp breath. He cupped a hand at my nape and planted a chaste kiss on my lips. The other slid around my waist to hold me as he dipped me back. I smiled under the soft press of his kiss, wrapping my arms around his neck.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re quite the romantic these days, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>He grinned and pulled me up, not loosening his hold around me.</p> <p>\u201cStill celebrating, I take it?\u201d</p><p>My loving gaze shifted toward the door, the voice there reminding me that we were far from alone. Marie walked closer, a dark-haired man behind her. Curiosity, pride, and love shone from her eyes, and the look hit my heart. Blake loosened his hold so I could go to her. She pulled me into a warm hug. `</p><p>She whispered in my ear. \u201cCongrats, baby girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>She stepped back and looked up to the man who was at her side now. He was tall, nearly six-feet, with short black hair and olive skin. His dark eyes captivated me for a moment.</p><p>\u201cErica, I\u2019m Richard Craven. It\u2019s a pleasure to finally meet you.\u201d</p><p>He captured his hand in mine as I reached out.</p><p>\u201cLikewise. I\u2019ve heard so much about you.\u201d</p> <p>Tall, dark, and unwilling to commit. I looked between him and Marie. Marie, the woman who could be my mother but always seemed to strike me as too youthful and vibrant for her age, somehow looked even younger beside him, her expression soft and almost girlish in his presence.</p><p>Blake came up beside us. \u201cRichard, I\u2019m Blake Landon.\u201d</p><p>Richard grinned and shook his hand. \u201cWe meet at last.\u201d</p><p>Blake\u2019s eyes narrowed.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve attended a few of the same events around town. I\u2019m a journalist, so I\u2019ve been there to cover local stories and what not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see. Well, it\u2019s a pleasure to meet you formally, Richard. Should we eat?\u201d</p><p>Marie clapped and smiled. \u201cLet\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>Blake caught my hand and nodded toward the approaching ma\u00eetre d\u2019.</p><p>We settled at our table, and Marie peppered me with questions while we waited for our meal. Where and when would we have the wedding? Who were we inviting? When I was going dress shopping? I answered as many as I could. Blake and I would need to figure out some basic wedding plans before anyone else had the chance to pump me for details. Not having answers was driving me crazy and adding to the mountain of anxiety I was already dealing with.</p><p>I turned my attention to Blake\u2019s conversation with Richard, desperate for an escape.</p><p>\u201cDo you write for a specific publication?\u201d Blake asked.</p><p>\u201cI have a staff position at the Globe, but occasionally I write for others.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRichard is asked to travel quite a bit,\u201d Marie chimed in.</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of stories do you report on?\u201d I asked.</p><p>His gaze shifted to me. Something passed behind his eyes. Curiosity, vague interest maybe, but I couldn\u2019t put my finger on it. \u201cThe type of reporting I do really runs the gamut, but I take a special interest in political coverage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you enjoy it?\u201d I hoped the disinterest wasn\u2019t evident in my voice when I asked.</p><p>A charming grin lifted his lips. \u201cWhat isn\u2019t entertaining about politics?\u201d</p><p>I could think of a thing or two. I laughed lightly, unwilling or maybe unable to give him an honest answer that wouldn\u2019t open a can of worms not conducive to polite dinner conversation.</p><p>\u201cWhat about you, Erica? Do you have any interest in politics?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot especially, no.\u201d I put my napkin on the table. \u201cIf you\u2019ll excuse me a moment. I have to use the ladies room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll join you, dear,\u201d Marie said.</p><p>\u201cSo what do you think?\u201d She freshened her makeup in the mirror, brushing gloss over her bottom lip.</p><p>\u201cAbout Richard? He seems great. Definitely very charming.\u201d</p><p>She shot me a sassy grin. \u201cHe charms the hell out of me.\u201d</p><p>I rolled my eyes and laughed. \u201cTMI, Marie. Anyway, I thought things were kind of rocky with you two? What changed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was traveling for a while, and we didn\u2019t see much of each other. Honestly, I really thought things had fizzled between us. The past couple weeks have been different though. I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s hard to explain, but maybe we\u2019ve just passed a certain point with each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess that\u2019s good, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good enough for now. I\u2019m having too much fun to push the issue. What about Blake? You must be on cloud nine.\u201d</p><p>I smiled, warming at the mere thought of him. We\u2019d been apart for all of four minutes and I missed him. Was I ever hopeless.</p><p>\u201cI am, yeah. He caught me completely off guard, so I think I\u2019m still getting used to the idea of all this marriage stuff.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She shook her head and patted my cheek. \u201cMy little girl. I can\u2019t believe it. You\u2019re going to beat me to the altar. If I didn\u2019t love you so damn much, I might hate you a little.\u201d</p><p>I laughed. \u201cBlake\u2019s the one who seems to be in a rush, otherwise I\u2019d be happy to give you a head start.\u201d</p><p>She cocked her head slightly. \u201cYou sure about this? Blake seems wonderful, but you know you don\u2019t have to do this if you\u2019re not ready. I don\u2019t want you to be an old maid like me, but you have plenty of time.\u201d</p><p>I looked down, my fingers twisting around the beautiful ring. I couldn\u2019t imagine anything, any doubt or reservation, threatening to come between me and keeping this ring on my finger.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure if marriage is something anyone is ever ready for, right? Plus I already said yes, so I\u2019m a little committed already.\u201d I laughed nervously.</p><p>She brought her hand up, brushing my cheek softly. \u201cListen to your heart, Erica. There\u2019s nothing but noise in this world, and that\u2019s got to be the one steady voice in our lives. If your heart says yes, nothing else matters.\u201d</p><p>I reached for her, holding her in a hug for a long time. I thought about all the times she\u2019d comforted me, given me advice and solace.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Marie, for everything. Also, you\u2019re not an old maid.\u201d</p><p>She laughed softly and released me, blinking away the wetness in her eyes.</p> <p>\u201cAll right, enough of that. I\u2019m going to wreck my makeup. Let\u2019s get back to our men.\u201d</p><p>The rest of the evening went well. We chatted, and Marie shared stories of our summers together when I was back in school. Any embarrassment that came with her honesty was quickly replaced with gratitude that she was the one person who could represent my otherwise absent family. Blake squeezed my hand under the table, occasionally shooting me a knowing look, as if he too appreciated her little insights into my past. It was the closest to embarrassing baby pictures he was likely to experience in my world.</p><p>We finished a decadent dessert, and Richard picked up the check just as my phone rang. I fished it out of my purse and recognized the number.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me, I have to take this.\u201d</p><p>Blake\u2019s brow wrinkled, but I slipped away from the table before he could question me.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cErica, it\u2019s Alex Hannon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlex, hi. Thanks for getting back to me. Um, I\u2019m not sure if you remember me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. Landon introduced us at the Vegas event. Took a minute to jog my memory, but you\u2019ve got the fashion site, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Clozpin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo how\u2019s it been going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOverall really well. I\u2019m actually brainstorming options for expanding the site, possibly incorporating some e-commerce. You came to mind, of course, which is why I\u2019m calling. I\u2019m not sure if there are any partnership opportunities, but if nothing else, I\u2019d love to just get your advice. I know you must be busy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo worries. It\u2019d be easier to talk in person though, I think. Any chance you\u2019re coming out for the Tech Awards this weekend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, no,\u201d I said, not wanting to admit that the event wasn\u2019t on my radar at all.</p> <p>\u201cI could scrounge up a couple tickets if you can make the trip. We could discuss any opportunities for working together while you\u2019re out. And you could write it off as a business expense, of course.\u201d</p><p>I laughed. \u201cI think I could probably work something out. Let me check my schedule and shoot you an email to confirm, but I\u2019d love to come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat, let me know. If you can\u2019t make it for some reason, I\u2019m planning to be out your way in a couple weeks to see some family, so we could always meet up then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds good. Thanks again, Alex.\u201d</p><p>We hung up, and I couldn\u2019t hide the smile on my face when Blake approached me in the entryway.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s got you smiling like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was Alex Hannon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you talking to him?\u201d</p><p>The furrow in his brow deepened and quickly released when Marie and Richard joined us. We hugged our goodbyes, and Marie made me promise to call her for dress shopping.</p><p>My mind spun as Blake led me outside. The valet drove the Tesla up to the curb and Blake opened the door for me to get in. Settled behind the wheel, Blake pulled into the steady flow of evening traffic. After a few minutes of silence he finally spoke.</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s going on with Alex?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was talking to Sid about maybe taking Clozpin in a different direction, trying to think outside the box a little, and it occurred to me that Alex had offered to be a resource when we met. I\u2019m not sure if he\u2019d be interested in any partnership\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of partnership?\u201d</p><p>My excitement over the call waned quickly at the skepticism in his voice. \u201cI don\u2019t know if that\u2019s something he would consider. His site is huge, and he\u2019s obviously doing really well on his own. But Max and Risa are in business competing with us now. I\u2019ve lost a handful more advertisers, and my revenue is going to take a hit. I just thought\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get it, but you\u2019re considering a partnership with Alex Hannon and you didn\u2019t run this by me?\u201d</p><p>I shifted in my seat. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize I had to. Is there something with Alex that I need to know about? If it\u2019s anything like what you kept from me about Max, I\u2019d like to know before I fly out to San Francisco to see him.\u201d</p><p>He exhaled audibly, betraying his growing frustration. He parked abruptly down the street from the apartment and stared off a moment. \u201cHe\u2019s nothing like Max. I\u2019m a little shocked you didn\u2019t talk to me about any of this though. I\u2019m the investor in your company.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m grateful for what you\u2019ve done, Blake. I have every intention of paying you back, but if I have any chance of doing that, I need to get us back on track. Otherwise this is going to be an epic failure and your investment will be lost.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t give a shit about the money, Erica. Four million dollars would be worth losing if it brought you into my life. Every penny I have would be.\u201d</p><p>My heart twisted at the proclamation. \u201cThank you, Blake. But this is about me making this business work. I reached out to Alex on a whim, and I honestly didn\u2019t think he\u2019d get back to me so quickly. I definitely wasn\u2019t expecting him to be receptive to discussing this further, but it seems like an opportunity I should pursue. I\u2019m telling you about it now, literally minutes after it\u2019s happened. I\u2019m sorry if you felt I was keeping anything from you, because that wasn\u2019t my intention.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He caught my hand and rubbed the back of it gently.</p><p>\u201cAre things going okay at work?\u201d I didn\u2019t want to argue, but I could tell something was bothering him, hoping it wasn\u2019t all me. \u201cHave you been able to talk to Michael yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI put a call in to him, but I haven\u2019t heard back yet. I might make a trip to Dallas. Some things are better discussed face to face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you could go while I\u2019m in California.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, his lips pulled into a tight line. \u201cNo, I\u2019ll go with you. Alex is a friend. We\u2019ve worked together before, and obviously I don\u2019t want you traveling alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like that. There\u2019s some technology awards event this weekend, and he said that he could get tickets if I could make it.\u201d</p><p>His hold on my hand tightened slightly. \u201cSure. I\u2019ll have Cady make arrangements. We can get a flight Friday night.\u201d</p><p>I leaned over and slid my free hand across his button down. His eyes darkened. We stayed that way, still in the darkness, eyes glittering in lamplight. I sensed he had more to say, but I didn\u2019t want to push him tonight. I reached up, closing the small distance between us.</p><p>Sealing our mouths together, I sought the sweet depth of his. The kiss deepened. Our tongues tangled. He freed my hand to cup my cheek, angling me to his liking. I reared up, wanting our bodies closer in this small moment, as impractical as it might have been.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d I whispered, panting for air when we separated.</p><p>I lowered my hand, gratified as always to find him hard, his erection straining. I kissed him deeper, teasing him with strokes of my tongue that I imagined lavishing elsewhere.</p><p>He pulled back, catching his breath. \u201cLet\u2019s go in.\u201d</p><p>Before he could move I had his fly unzipped, my fingers circled around his length. I kissed his neck, nipping at his skin while I stroked him from root to tip.</p><p>\u201cFuck, Erica, let\u2019s go in. Someone\u2019s going to walk by.\u201d</p><p>I smiled against him. \u201cAnd do what? Tell on us? Maybe they\u2019ll want to watch me suck you off.\u201d I took his earlobe in my mouth. \u201cMy lover\u2019s had a bad day. Let me make it better.\u201d</p><p>He exhaled sharply, his cock twitching in my palm. \u201cI\u2019m going to punish you for this later.\u201d</p><p>I laughed quietly. \u201cYou\u2019re going to punish me for wanting your cock in my mouth? I think I can handle that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf a cop pulls up before I come, we\u2019re going to redefine punishment. You might not like it. Make it fast.\u201d</p><p>He lifted a fraction, his erection shifting in my grasp. My mouth watered at the promise of tasting him. I took the hint, lowered, and wrapped my lips around his hot flesh. I swiped my tongue over the head and down his shaft, lubricating my path until my mouth was filled with the throb of his erection.</p><p>\u201cFucking hell. I love your mouth.\u201d</p><p>I moaned. The taste and his musk overwhelmed my senses. I eased him in and out with a rhythmic pulse. With his hand fisted in my hair, I slowed, letting him take control of my movements. He tightened his hold, guiding me over his cock, forcing himself deeper, faster. I heard his hand hit the steering wheel. His hips arched, holding himself to the back of my throat and then releasing me. I drew in a sharp breath through my nose a second before he repeated the motion, challenging what I could take.</p><p>Once more, and with a strangled cry, his muscles jumped. Curses filled the air around us. A warm gush flooded my mouth. I finished him, swallowing the evidence of his release until he was clean. He pulled me off abruptly, his head thrown back on the seat rest.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re killing me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know the feeling,\u201d I breathed, writhing with need now.</p><p>He turned his head, gazing down at me. \u201cYou\u2019re all wet, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>I shifted slightly, the rub of my thighs together doing little to ease the ache there. \u201cYes, and I\u2019m willing to beg you to do something about it.\u201d</p><p>He trailed a finger along the low neck of my blouse, grazing the top of my breast. I bit my lip hard, the tension inside me mounting. He lifted his hand to release it with his thumb and pressed our lips together. A deep, possessive kiss, his taste lingered on my swollen lips.</p><p>\u201cTouch me,\u201d I whimpered.</p><p>\u201cI want to, believe me. But as soon as I sink my fingers into your pussy, I\u2019m never going to be able to get out of this car without fucking you. You might want the world to know I\u2019m fucking you straight out of your mind, but if I\u2019m going to jail, I\u2019d like it to be a little more notable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s your sense of adventure,\u201d I teased. I kissed him hard, too wound up for my own good. \u201cI can\u2019t wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust me, you can wait, and you will wait. You\u2019ll wait even longer if you don\u2019t get your ass inside now,\u201d he growled. \u201cThis car\u2019s not big enough for all the things I\u2019m going to do to you.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER SIX</p><p>The sun set over the curve of the horizon as the plane made its way east. I leaned against Blake, tired from my day. I was grateful for the weekend, even if it meant travel and more work. I would have rather enjoyed another break on the Vineyard, but I\u2019d take what I could get.</p><p>\u201cWe should talk about all this wedding stuff. If I have to sit through another inquisition with Alli I\u2019m going to lose my mind.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cShe\u2019s probably giving Heath a heart attack.\u201d</p><p>I stayed quiet, not wanting to hint that maybe marriage plans weren\u2019t so terribly far away for the couple. Heath still had a long way to go pulling his life together after his stint in rehab. Being back in Boston with his family and now Alli seemed like the right move, but we all cared too much about Heath to take this good stretch for granted. That may have been why Blake hadn\u2019t pushed him to move out, even if it had encroached on our privacy now that we were living together.</p><p>\u201cHave you thought about what you want to do?\u201d</p><p>I sighed. \u201cNot really. I think I\u2019m too overwhelmed to even consider the details. When, where, and who... I can\u2019t imagine how I\u2019m going to pull this together.\u201d</p><p>He slid his hand into mine and squeezed gently. \u201cWe can do whatever you want. At the end of the day, all I care about is being married to you. If that\u2019s at some lavish affair that will go down in Landon family history, or if we take a weekend in Vegas and tie the knot on our own, I don\u2019t really care as long as you\u2019re Mrs. Erica Landon at the end of it. Just don\u2019t make me wait too long, okay?\u201d</p><p>I relaxed a little at the sweet look in his eyes when he said my name, the name that would be mine. \u201cI feel the same way, but I don\u2019t want to disappoint your family. If we eloped, they\u2019d probably hate me for stealing their moment.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He laughed softly. \u201cTheir moment? Baby, this is our moment. We can do whatever we want. Heath will get around to it eventually, and Alli can go nuts with her planning then. Say the word, and I\u2019ll book the Elvis chapel.\u201d</p><p>I rested my head against his shoulder, closing my eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I guess I need to think about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you worried about your family?\u201d</p><p>The dread in my stomach answered his question before I could respond. \u201cMaybe a little. Too bad my family can\u2019t be more like yours. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d even want to invite them to a ceremony.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHave you told Elliot?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head.</p><p>\u201cDaniel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I told him. He actually said he was happy for us. Totally threw me off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell he sure as hell won\u2019t be walking you down the aisle.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think we have to worry about that. If anyone would, it\u2019d probably be Elliot. He actually called me out of the blue the other day. We haven\u2019t talked in months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never mentioned it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would have, but you had a pressing need to tie me to the dining room table. He\u2019s what made me late, by the way.\u201d</p><p>He squeezed my hand, maybe in a silent apology. I was too comfortable to move and catch his reaction.</p><p>\u201cSo what did he say?\u201d</p><p>I shrugged my shoulders, suddenly wishing I hadn\u2019t brought it up at all. I understood Elliot\u2019s reasons for wanting to reach out to me, but I hated feeling like he was doing it out of obligation or guilt.</p> <p>Blake caught my chin, tipping it toward him. \u201cDid he say something to upset you?\u201d</p><p>I met his gaze and straightened in my seat. \u201cNo. It\u2019s just that talking to him again brought back a lot of memories. A lot of those are sad, I suppose. He wants to come visit and commemorate Mom\u2019s passing. It\u2019s been ten years.\u201d</p><p>I stared into the darkening night sky through the small window at my side. A vision of my mother as I remembered her passed through my mind, the same way it did every day and at times like these. She was always with me, somehow.</p><p>\u201cFunny how years can go by and one conversation can bring me back there so quickly. All of a sudden I was twelve again. I mean, I\u2019m an adult now. I can rationalize and cope when difficult things happen, but I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ll ever be able to think about her life or her death without the kind of devastating feelings I had as a child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat makes sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes it? I mean, I should be able to move on by now, but that conversation made me realize how much is still there, unresolved, for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you feel is unresolved about it? I mean, it doesn\u2019t sound like she had options.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that. I understand there was nothing that could have been done to save her. It\u2019s more how everything fell apart after she died.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWith Elliot?\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cI don\u2019t feel like I can be angry with him. When everything boils down, he\u2019s not really my father. His commitment was to my mother, and he could have never known she would get sick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis commitment was to you too, though.\u201d</p><p>I lingered on that idea longer than I really wanted to. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter now. I don\u2019t even know why I\u2019m talking about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it still hurts you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a big girl. I can deal with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d He brought my hand up and kissed it softly. \u201cYou don\u2019t always have to be so damn strong, you know.\u201d</p><p>I laughed quietly. \u201cI don\u2019t know how else to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose that makes two of us. Except I\u2019d be a lot happier if you let me shoulder more of the burden for you.\u201d</p><p>I shot a questioning look his way.</p><p>\u201cThis meeting with Alex, for example. I could have easily set that up for you, felt him out for possibilities, and negotiated something that would work out favorably for you. But you\u2019re so damn headstrong you insist on doing it all yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>He laughed softly. \u201cWhy would you want to, when I can do it and you can focus on other things?\u201d</p><p>I pulled out of his grasp. \u201cLike what? Wedding planning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, like running other aspects of the business. Isn\u2019t that what you enjoy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBuilding these relationships is part of my job. If anyone should be doing it, I should.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuit yourself, Erica. You want to do things the hard way, I\u2019ll let you, but I\u2019m not going anywhere so it might be worth a second thought. We\u2019re on the same team, remember?\u201d</p><p>He took my hand from my lap, laced his fingers through mine, and trailed his lips down my arm. I shivered at the whisper of his breath on my skin. My nipples beaded instantly. I looked out the window, trying hard to be mad, but the innocent touch was a dangerous promise of how easily he could take control whenever he wanted. Blake had enough persistence to break down anyone\u2019s defenses.</p><p>I could fight, but he\u2019d always win.</p><p>The expansive function room was teaming with people. All walks of life. From suits to techies to everyone in between. From what Blake had told me, this was the \u201cwho\u2019s who\u201d event in the tech world, and I could expect to meet an impressive cross-section of people in the industry. Blake wore a dark gray suit, and I\u2019d dressed simply in a deep red wrap dress and black heels.</p><p>Blake kept an arm around my waist as we wove through the crowd. The gesture warmed me in more ways than one. I was always nervous at events like this, and as much as I wanted to hold my own, having him there with me was a comfort.</p><p>\u201cLandon.\u201d</p><p>Months had passed since we\u2019d met, but after a second, I recognized Alex as he walked toward us. His gaze drifted from Blake to me, and then to Blake\u2019s hold on me. I considered stepping away, but doing so would only be awkward. If Alex didn\u2019t already know about our relationship, he would now. And if he thought my recent success came from Blake\u2019s wealth...well, he might be right. I only hoped he wouldn\u2019t discredit the pitch I\u2019d planned for partnership opportunities because of it.</p><p>I scolded myself silently for reading so much into it. After all, Blake and I were engaged now. Engaged. The thought blew me away every time I said it to myself.</p><p>\u201cAlex, it\u2019s great to see you. Thanks so much for inviting us out.\u201d I reached to shake his hand, giving him my best professional grip.</p><p>He met me with a broad smile. \u201cAbsolutely. I\u2019m glad you two could make it. This is always a fun event. All the hot shots are here, so you\u2019ll fit right in.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh, thanks,\u201d I said shyly.</p><p>\u201cSo tell me about Clozpin. What have you been up to?\u201d</p><p>I cleared my throat, hoping I didn\u2019t look as awkward as I felt. I looked up at Blake. \u201cUm, I\u2019d love a drink.\u201d</p><p>A crooked grin curved his lips. \u201cSure thing. Alex?\u201d</p> <p>Alex raised his glass. \u201cI\u2019m good.\u201d</p><p>Blake maneuvered with grace toward the bar. My body cooled where he\u2019d held me by his side. I took a quick breath. I needed some space to say what I\u2019d come to say to Alex. I met his eyes with a small smile.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be honest, Alex. The business has been going great. We\u2019ve picked up some big name advertisers, and there has been an impressive growth spurt in the very short time we\u2019ve been funded. The trajectory is strong. However, a competitor site recently popped up. They\u2019ve essentially cloned us and are now trying to poach our advertisers.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cThat must be frustrating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery, but it\u2019s been an eye-opener too. Our team is stronger than we\u2019ve ever been, our foundation is very solid, and I think we could transition to the next level pretty easily and leave this copycat in the dust.\u201d</p> <p>He took a sip off his drink.</p><p>\u201cHow do you plan to do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s where you come in. I\u2019m open to suggestions, but this seems like a perfect time to partner with someone who could use our traffic to build sales of their own and help us grow in return. I checked out your site after the conference, and while ecommerce has always been in the back of my mind, I\u2019ve admittedly had my hands full growing our current business model. I wasn\u2019t ready for a major shift until recently.\u201d</p><p>He nodded slowly. A ghost of a smile curved his lips. \u201cI can see why Landon invested with you.\u201d</p><p>I laughed nervously, not quite knowing how to respond. My thoughts went to Blake as Alex\u2019s words echoed in my mind. I cocked my head and studied him a moment.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t remember mentioning that Blake was an investor, but perhaps that was obvious.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI might have assumed, but no, we spoke a bit today over the phone. He just wanted to touch base and it came up. Don\u2019t worry, he was determined to let you pitch me. He failed to mention the copycat though, which makes me all the more impressed that you were honest with me about it.\u201d</p><p>My jaw set. I didn\u2019t know whether to be annoyed with Blake or proud that I\u2019d impressed Alex. But why was he always meddling? When would he realize I could hold my own? My brain reminded me that he wanted to help, compulsively so, but another part of me wondered if he truly believed I could handle it.</p><p>Alex\u2019s voice broke me from my thoughts. \u201cSounds like a promising start though. Let\u2019s meet up tomorrow to talk details. I don\u2019t want to pull you away from the party. I\u2019m sure Blake\u2019s eager to show you around. Plenty of people to meet here.\u201d</p><p>He nodded beyond me. I followed his gaze, suddenly more determined to find Blake\u2019s face in the crowd than I was to butter up my prospective business partner. When I found him, my heart fell into my stomach. The chiseled outline of his profile faced Risa. She twisted a lose strand of her jet-black hair around her finger as she spoke, mouthing words I couldn\u2019t read. She looked as put together as ever in an all black designer suit. But her expression was tentative, her eyes wide and her body leaning back slightly from the unmoving column of Blake\u2019s body.</p><p>\u201cErica?\u201d</p><p>I turned my attention back to Alex.</p><p>\u201cAre you fine meeting for lunch tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>My thoughts suddenly scattered. \u201cYes, that\u2019s fine.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGreat. Let\u2019s meet at the hotel restaurant around noon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds good. I\u2019ll look forward to it.\u201d</p><p>Then Blake was beside me, circling a hand around my upper arm. His grip was firm enough to send warning signals to my brain. When had I become so in tune to his moods? And when did my body start reacting so acutely to them?</p><p>\u201cAlex, will you excuse us?\u201d Blake\u2019s voice was no longer relaxed and casual. Instead the words came across curt, as if Alex were no longer an old friend, but just another business acquaintance.</p><p>\u201cOf course. Have a great night, you two.\u201d</p><p>Alex waved us off without another word. Blake led me toward the exit we\u2019d just arrived through, his hold on me tightening a fraction. I resisted the urge to yank out of his grasp and call him out on getting to Alex with my pitch before I had a chance to. I wanted to be angry with him for unnecessarily butting into my professional life yet again, but something was definitely wrong beyond all that.</p><p>\u201cWhat is Risa doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s here for the same reason everyone else is here. To see and be seen.\u201d The words came through gritted teeth.</p><p>My stomach knotted with worry. We slowed in front of the bank of elevators, and he hit the button hard.</p><p>\u201cWhat did she say?\u201d</p><p>The bell rang, and we entered the mercifully empty car. The doors closed slowly and he backed me toward the mirrored wall of the elevator, pinning me there with the closeness of his body. He grasped my jaw, forcing us eye-to-eye. I couldn\u2019t evade the intense eyes that burned into me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to ask you one last time. And you\u2019ll tell me the goddamn truth. If you don\u2019t, we\u2019re finished. Done.\u201d</p><p>The knot in my stomach doubled at hearing his threat.</p><p>\u201cYou lied to me once, because you thought you were protecting me, but if you lie to me right now, it\u2019ll be the last chance you\u2019ll ever have.\u201d He took a short breath. \u201cTell me the truth, and we\u2019ll figure it out.\u201d</p><p>I thought my heart might pound right out of my chest at its current pace. I was too stunned to respond for a few seconds.</p><p>\u201cBlake...you\u2019re scaring me.\u201d</p><p>His jaw worked, as if wrestling with the words he held behind the firm line of his beautiful lips. \u201cDid. You. Fuck. James?\u201d</p><p>My heart stopped. I looked into his eyes, desperately searching for a reason for his unexpected question.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>The car came to a stop, and he left me, moving swiftly down the hallway. I hurried out, following him into our room. I lingered by the door, my mind still racing. What had Risa said? What had spurred this intensity from him, seemingly out of nowhere?</p><p>Blake tossed his jacket off. It landed on a chair and he moved to the window. Shoving his hands through his hair, he faced the sprawling city view.</p><p>I simply stared. In awe, in fear, in love. I didn\u2019t know what was happening between us tonight, but I hated how far away he already felt. I took a step toward him and stopped short when he turned to face me. My breath left me when our eyes met again. Stone cold. As dark and unfeeling as I\u2019d ever seen them. No longer my sweet and romantic lover, the man in front of me was the ruthless billionaire who wouldn\u2019t be crossed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cStrip.\u201d</p><p>The order settled into the silence between us. The word physically chilled me, a shiver working its way up my spine.</p><p>\u201cBlake, I don\u2019t understand...\u201d</p><p>He unbuttoned his shirt, unhurriedly pulling it loose from his pants. \u201cI want you to strip down. Naked, here in the middle of the room.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy...why are you so upset with me?\u201d</p><p>The smooth veneer of his controlled expression broke. A frustrating grimace revealed his teeth. \u201cGoddamnit, Erica. I\u2019ll get another room, and I\u2019ll be on the first plane out of here in the morning. You can sleep alone and go home alone. If that\u2019s what you want, you should test me now. See how much room I\u2019ll give you.\u201d</p><p>His skin reddened. Had he ever been this angry with me? But why? His jaw ticked, the muscle bulging as he waited for me to react. I opened my mouth to speak, but I couldn\u2019t. I had no idea what I was defending myself against. What had taken us from an enjoyable evening to being swept up in the tornado of this unexpected rage?</p><p>As if in answer to my unspoken question, he spoke in low and measured tones. \u201cRisa let me know about James. Remember, your little rendezvous outside the office after I dropped her off? Sounds like things got pretty heated between the two of you.\u201d He cocked his head a fraction. \u201cAssuming there\u2019s some weight to that story.\u201d</p><p>No. No, this wasn\u2019t happening.</p> <p>My eyes blurred with the sting of the tears I held back. I was paralyzed. Without consideration, I would have done anything to stop where this was going.</p><p>He tossed his shirt aside and came toward me.</p><p>\u201cWas it as steamy as the beach? I seem to recall you being pretty worked up after that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlake,\u201d I pleaded. He was twisting everything. Goddamn her for doing this to me, to us.</p><p>He stood in front of me, staring down into my eyes. He seemed taller, more intimidating than I\u2019d ever remembered. I lowered my shoulders, his posture seeming to demand that I do.</p><p>\u201cIs it not true? Tell me it\u2019s not true.\u201d</p> <p>I snapped my jaw shut. Anything I said now would be futile. He wasn\u2019t interested in my excuses.</p><p>He threaded his fingers into my hair, gripping it by the roots to pull me an inch closer. I whimpered at the small pain. My hands found his chest, the leverage holding me up as my knees weakened slightly. The heat of his skin nearly burned mine. He leaned in so I could feel his breath in my hair, against my neck. I could smell him\u2014the man I loved who maybe hated me now.</p><p>\u201cStrip.\u201d The venom in his voice was now replaced with a dangerous determination that prickled under my skin. \u201cAnd kneel.\u201d</p><p>My eyes fell shut. I exhaled sharply, already feeling stripped by his words. I wanted to cry, but I remembered his threat. That he\u2019d leave me. Maybe only for a night, but the thought of him leaving in the midst of all this terrified me. I couldn\u2019t believe that he wasn\u2019t already considering leaving me completely.</p><p>He released his grip. I nearly stumbled as he moved away. I looked down at my feet, my hands sliding restlessly against my dress. Without thinking, because I couldn\u2019t make sense of anything right now, I kicked off my heels, one after the other. My fingers went to the knot holding my dress across my body. I fumbled with it, my hands trembling badly now. I loosened it and let the dress fall to the floor around me. Sensing the seconds ticking by and knowing he was counting them, waiting, I quickly released my bra and slid my panties down.</p><p>I stood there, starkly naked. The silence stretched between us. I lifted my head to find him. Eyes that stormed with emotion seemed to bark the order in the silence of the room.</p><p>With the unspoken command, I lowered, resting shaky hands on my knees. A voice in my head screamed that I shouldn\u2019t have to, not this way, answered by another that told me I deserved every minute of it. Either way, I couldn\u2019t let him leave me, and if I had to kneel to make him stay, I would.</p><p>CHAPTER SEVEN</p> <p>I stared at the carpeted floor in front of me. This was what he wanted from me. When I wanted to ask why, when I wanted to fight it, Blake\u2019s words echoed in my mind.</p><p>Total submission. Total control over your pleasure and pain.</p><p>He wanted this...my submission. He didn\u2019t want to explain himself. I could say sorry. We could talk it out, fight it out, but this is what he wanted now. Maybe it\u2019s what I needed too. That tornado of our bodies crashing together, silencing the rest of the world. Except he was furious, and I hated to see that look in his eyes knowing I\u2019d put it there.</p><p>He crouched down in front of me, but I kept my eyes down, focusing on his shoes, the way his slacks strained against his muscled thighs. God, but the man was gorgeous. Even when he was angry as hell.</p><p>His hand graced my cheek, eliciting a shiver that traveled up my spine.</p><p>\u201cIf I wasn\u2019t so pissed off right now, I might be impressed with you, Erica. My little submissive is finally learning. We\u2019ll see how long you can keep it up, because you\u2019re going to get the punishment of a lifetime tonight. Do you think you can take it?\u201d</p><p>I lifted my head, my eyes narrowing. The fighter in me threatened to spout off to him. I inhaled a slow, steadying breath through my nose. Ride out the storm.</p><p>\u201cStill don\u2019t want a safe word?\u201d</p><p>My chest fought to expand over my next breath. I took another quickly and shook my head, casting my eyes down again. Stupidly, I assured myself that committing myself to one would give him license to make me want to use it.</p><p>He brushed his fingertips over my lips, sending a tingle over them.</p><p>\u201cHe kissed you. Did you kiss him back?\u201d</p><p>I sucked in a breath through my now quivering lips.</p><p>\u201cIn case you haven\u2019t noticed, I\u2019m not in the mood to repeat myself tonight. Did you kiss him back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I...I kissed him back.\u201d The words left a sour taste in my mouth. Why? Why had I let myself wander so damn far? A tinge of nausea hit my stomach at the thought I could lose Blake over that one stupid moment.</p><p>\u201cWas he in your mouth?\u201d</p><p>I waited a second and nodded again, the sickness reeling through me now. His touch feathered down to my breasts, cupping the heavy weight of one.</p><p>\u201cWhat about his hands? How could he resist these perfect tits when his tongue was in your mouth? Did he touch you here?\u201d</p><p>He gave my nipple a tug, eliciting a whimper.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. No.\u201d</p><p>Lowering, his palm skimmed over my belly until he was between my parted legs. He grazed the lips of my pussy, barely touching me.</p><p>\u201cHere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I insisted.</p>  </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDid you want him to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He slapped my pussy, a sharp motion that sent a shock of pain and unexpected pleasure through me.</p><p>\u201cTruth, Erica,\u201d he snapped.</p><p>\u201cI wanted it to be you,\u201d I rushed. \u201cIf any part of me wanted those things, that was why. But I\u2019m telling you the truth when I say I didn\u2019t feel anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean to tell me that he held you in a kiss long enough for Risa to see, with his goddamn tongue in your mouth, and you didn\u2019t feel a thing?\u201d</p><p>I closed my eyes, hating all of this. Everything was confused, as mixed up as I had felt when I let James too close that day. My throat constricted with emotion.</p><p>\u201cBlake. Please believe me. Everything happened so fast. He caught me off guard, and maybe for a split second, yes, I thought I wanted him. But then I couldn\u2019t stand it. Even believing you were gone, that I\u2019d never have you again, I didn\u2019t want him. I wanted you, but he\u2019s not you. He\u2019ll never be you. Even if you hate me and punish me, that will never change.\u201d</p><p>My voice was watery as I uttered the last words, the truth that would haunt me to the day I died if he ever left me. God forbid, he\u2019d ruin me forever.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me? Why the fuck did I have to find out this way?\u201d</p><p>I bowed my head. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to hurt you, Blake,\u201d I said, but it was too late for that.</p><p>\u201cDo you have any idea how furious I am right now?\u201d His voice was lower, dangerously low.</p><p>I chanced a look in his eyes. They were blurry through the wetness in my own. The lack of sympathy chilled me further. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m so sorry...\u201d My voice wavered, but I was desperate for him to know it.</p><p>\u201cAre you? And will you show me how sorry you are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do whatever you want.\u201d I reached for him, but he stilled me, holding my wrists away from him.</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you think I want you after what you did?\u201d</p><p>He could have pushed a dagger straight into my heart the way the words hit me. But his eyes told a different story. I saw fury there, but hurt too. Not enough to weaken the hard lines of his features, but enough to give me the smallest of hopes.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the only one I\u2019ll ever want. Please don\u2019t hate me. Blake, I was stupid and scared. I hate that it happened, that I gave up on us before we could find our way back to each other. I love you. Please...let me show you.\u201d</p><p>He paused a moment before releasing my wrists. He rose and crossed the short distance to the couch. The swift rejection gave weight to the already heavy sickness in my belly. My breath left me at the whoosh of his belt leaving his pants. He held it in his hand a moment, a knowing look leveling me. My chest tightened, heaving under my now anxious breathing. Unexpectedly, he let it drop to the floor before settling himself onto the couch.</p><p>He unzipped his pants and freed his erection. He began slow strokes up and down the hard length. A different kind of tension rolled off him then, one I could release for him, if he\u2019d let me. Several moments passed as he worked himself up, his gaze never leaving me. I pressed my fingernails into the tops of my thighs. I wanted badly to go to him, but he\u2019d punish me if I moved without his permission. I didn\u2019t dare speak it.</p><p>\u201cCome here,\u201d he rasped.</p><p>Relieved, I moved to stand.</p><p>But he cut me off. \u201cCrawl. I want you on your hands and knees until I tell you otherwise.\u201d</p> <p>I hesitated a moment, and then began to move. The carpet pressed into my palms and stung my knees as I crossed the distance between us. My cheeks heated with embarrassment. This position delivered all the humiliation he could have wanted to deliver.</p><p>Nothing could diminish my wanting him, though. I sat on my heels between his legs, as willing as I\u2019d been a moment ago. The engorged head of his large cock disappeared under his palm and reappeared as his hand slid to the base. The tip glistened with moisture. Licking my lips, I could nearly taste him. Suddenly I wanted nothing more than him in my mouth. I could take away this frustration, ease this ache that burned inside both of us.</p><p>\u201cYou want this?\u201d Strain weakened his words as his pace quickened.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I lifted off my heels, my hands resting on his knees.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t deserve this. The satisfaction it would give you.\u201d</p><p>The dagger he\u2019d already lodged in my heart twisted. Like a wounded animal, I lowered.</p><p>\u201cPlease. Let me,\u201d I pleaded softly.</p><p>His breath hissed through his teeth. I bit my lip, my own frustration mounting with the rise of his orgasm. The words seemed lost. Would he ignore me until he came? I slid my hands up his thighs and back down. I licked my lips, imagining his taste on them, the push of his desire between them.</p><p>\u201cLet me please you, baby. I love you. I want to.\u201d</p><p>His eyelids fell closed, his muscles hardening beneath my touch. \u201cFuck,\u201d he groaned. His head fell back with a shaky breath.</p><p>Emboldened, I placed a hand over his, holding down his rapid movement. A second later he was deep in the wetness of my mouth. I circled his head rapidly with my tongue. My cheeks hollowed with a hard suck, and I took him as far as I could. I shifted and moaned, my thighs brushing together as I positioned myself so I could take him as deeply as I could.</p><p>That quickly he was at the edge. A few urgent shoves against the back of my throat, and he shuddered with a pained groan. He caught me by the hair and held me to him until he\u2019d emptied himself completely, his cock twitching and throbbing through the aftershocks.</p><p>The ache of kneeling and the discomfort of the way he moved me for his pleasure faded into the background as I tasted him, breathed in his scent. From base to tip, I licked him clean. My lover, my beautiful tortured lover. I wanted to be this for him. I wanted to worship him, to serve him. I wanted to be everything for him, even in these dark moments when nothing made sense but the demands of our flesh.</p><p>He slipped from my mouth, and the sounds of our breathing filled the silence. My breasts were tight and heavy. Moisture pooled between my legs. I wanted him now, as angry as he\u2019d been moments ago. But I fought the urge to show him, to ask for more. I let my hands slip back to my knees, breathing through the desire that surged.</p><p>He raised his head. His face had softened in the aftermath of his orgasm, but his jaw was resolute. \u201cTouch yourself.\u201d</p><p>Without another thought I reached between my legs. Pulling the moisture of my arousal over my clit, I began a rhythm. My eyes closed. A soft moan left my lips when I thought of his fingers there, pleasuring me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWish it were me touching you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant me to sink my cock into that wet pussy of yours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I gasped. My belly tightened and heat prickled across my skin. My core pulsed and clenched, wanting to be filled with him. All of him, until all of this madness went away and it was just us, together.</p><p>\u201cGo ahead and work yourself up.\u201d</p><p>A flash of fear shot through me as I felt him move away from me. If he was willing to shun me earlier, what would stop him from teasing me to the edge and leaving me there just to spite me? My fingers worked feverishly over my clit. My orgasm built, and I chased it. Eyes squeezed tight, I blocked everything else out. Suddenly I was convinced he\u2019d leave me unsatisfied if I didn\u2019t get there myself.</p><p>\u201cBlake,\u201d I moaned. His name left my lips like a desperate prayer. He wasn\u2019t inside me, but he was still with me. Invading my thoughts, deeply embedded in any fantasy that would bring me to climax. I kept him close as I clawed at the now empty couch, my hips lifting into my own chase.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m right here.\u201d</p><p>My eyes flew open at the sound of his voice at my neck. Before I could focus, he linked his arm through both of mine at the elbow, pulling my shoulders back. My breasts jutted out. My clit throbbed for attention. I shifted restlessly, too eager to finish or be finished. His free hand came to my throat, his grasp both gentle and possessive. His thumb rested on the heavy pulse point that beat stronger as he circled the column of my neck.</p><p>\u201cI want to show your body who it belongs to, but I want to hear you say it,\u201d he whispered, pulling my earlobe into his mouth. He sucked, bit down hard.</p><p>I jerked as much as his restraint allowed me. I was wound too tight.</p><p>He soothed the sting with his tongue. Hot open-mouthed kisses down my neck had me breathless and squirming. I pushed my hips back into his erection, silently begging him to fuck me. He leaned me forward, so my chest rested against the couch. His hand left my throat and curved around my front. He slipped into my wet heat, his fingers teasing the hard nub of my clit. I tensed at the contact, the leisurely pace of his touch driving me to the brink of madness.</p><p>\u201cI own you, Erica. Your heart, the blood that beats through it when I hold you down this way. Your body, the way it moves for me, comes for me. It\u2019s all mine. Say it. Tell me I own you, baby.\u201d</p><p>I shifted into his touch, ignoring his demand.</p><p>\u201cSay it.\u201d</p><p>I winced, the fight stirring in me anew. \u201cNo one owns me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Challenge laced his question. Somehow the fire of my desire fed my anger too. I needed to come, to be free of this tension, all of it.</p><p>\u201cNo one owns me,\u201d I snapped, helpless and frustrated all over again.</p><p>His fingertips left my clit. Gripping my hips tightly, he pushed me back against him, his hard cock shoving against my ass. I gasped, my anger fizzling in the tornado of my need to be fucked.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wrong. The second I slid that ring on your finger, I owned you. Don\u2019t play dumb and pretend you didn\u2019t know it either. You promised me no one would touch you again. Do you remember? I punished you then, and I\u2019m going to punish your ass again and again until I hear the fucking words.\u201d</p><p>He pulled back and moved sideways, and the next thing I felt was the lash of his belt across my thighs. The cry that emerged muffled into the couch when another landed.</p><p>\u201cBlake!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe can do this as long as you want. Watching your ass turn red just gets me hard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe weren\u2019t together.\u201d My voice, full of every emotion that he seemed to lack, broke as he unleashed another searing slap against my ass.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s fucking fault was that?\u201d he barked.</p><p>Mine. The burning heat of my skin doubled when another strike landed in the same spot. I cried out, tensing and shifting away, but he held me too tight. He wasn\u2019t spacing them out. He wanted me to feel this in a way I hadn\u2019t fully before.</p><p>I own you.</p><p>The words wrote themselves across my brain as I took one after the next, tensing until I thought my muscles might cramp. Every one delivered a measure of pain that made pleasure look like a faraway place. Each one seemed harder than the last until I went numb. Tears fell, and the only place I could feel the pain was in my heart, the place where I\u2019d wounded us both.</p><p>I barely registered relief when he stopped. My view of the room from the cushion of the couch was blurred with tears. He nudged my knees apart, and I jolted when his palms grazed the sensitive skin that had taken the brunt of his punishment. His fingers slid down the crack of my ass down into my wet sex and plunged deeply. I whimpered, overwhelmed by everything. My body was a live wire, numb and overcharged all at once. Despite all the punishing, I was soaked for him.</p><p>He withdrew and pressed a wet fingertip just inside the tight ring of my ass. \u201cI should fuck you here. You deserve it,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>I shook my head. I\u2019d made it through the pain, but I couldn\u2019t take any more. I didn\u2019t think I could anyway. I didn\u2019t know if he\u2019d let me come at all, but even that maddening fate seemed better than what he was threatening now.</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>A second finger entered me, stretching me.</p><p>My breath caught, and my brain came back to life out of the fog. My head came up off the couch and I tensed everywhere. \u201cNo! I\u2019m begging you, Blake. Please don\u2019t. I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He stilled behind me and withdrew without a word. The relief came down on me like a hammer.</p><p>\u201cMaybe not tonight, but I\u2019ll have your ass. You can count on it. Do you know why?\u201d He lowered, his lips grazing my ear. \u201cBecause I own you,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>My jaw clamped down, some small thread of fight lingering in me. The tightness in my throat signaled the torrent of emotions surging its way to my eyes. Anticipation, pain, love. However many minutes or hours had passed had brought on a violent string of emotions shooting through me like a lightning storm.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to fuck you, and God help me, you will not come until you say the words.\u201d</p><p>With a grip on my hip, he slid his cock against the pulsing entrance of my pussy and pushed in hard. An almost feral groan filled the air, and I realized it was my own. A desperate kind of pleasure filled me. It slid through my veins like the most addictive drug, taking me straight out of my mind where the only thing on earth that mattered was his body in mine. He kneed my legs farther apart so I felt every thrust deep in my core.</p><p>\u201cMine.\u201d He pounded into me. \u201cYou will never forget it again, Erica.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His possession consumed me, took me someplace else. I needed it, I needed him. This. And I was his.</p><p>Mine. You\u2019re mine. I\u2019m yours. Forever. Mindless, I repeated the words like a mantra until they lost meaning. You own me. You own me. You always have.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. I own you, baby.\u201d</p><p>My eyes shot open. I\u2019d said the words aloud. All of them. In the blind rush of wanting him.</p> <p>\u201cAnd goddamnit, you own me.\u201d</p><p>His confession interrupted my scattered thoughts. Then he shoved into me so hard I screamed. His fingers went back to my clit, building me up again. Every muscle tensed, but he held my arms firmly. He trapped me in the pleasure, restraining me so all I could feel were his rough movements, the impossible friction inside me. The need to come burned through me like fire in my veins.</p><p>\u201cBlake... Oh my God, please let me come. I love you. I\u2019m yours...please...please. I can\u2019t stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want to come?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen come,\u201d he said.</p><p>On command, the storm in my body exploded. I clenched down hard, pulling him into me. Every muscle tensed, a seemingly endless heightened state of satisfaction. I sobbed with the pleasure, my sounds muffled against the cushions beneath me. Everything released, leaving me weak and trembling. Leveraging himself with a hand on the couch, he took his pleasure, claiming my body with the same passion and vigor as he\u2019d claimed my heart. All of me. I took it all, wanting his possession to reach the soul of me.</p><p>He buried inside me with a final thrust, tense and silent.</p><p>Sweat cooled my skin. He covered my back with his body, enveloping me with his heat. My whole body seemed to sigh, weak as it had ever been. He finally released a shuddery breath and wrapped his arm around my rib cage. An embrace. Warm, and I wanted to believe it was loving. I flexed my fingers against his stomach, wanting to hold him to me, keep him close. But I was still held captive, and he didn\u2019t release me.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d I said.</p><p>As the words left me, I prayed he\u2019d say them back. Forgive me. Bring us past all of this. But that quickly, he slipped out of me. Then I couldn\u2019t feel him at all. Freed, I turned around. He disappeared into the bathroom. The door shut, loud in the quiet of the room.</p> <p>Empty and cold, I sat on the floor and wrapped my arms around myself. After a few minutes of listening to the shower I moved to the bed. My legs could barely make the journey. I collapsed onto the cool sheets and pulled the duvet over me, wishing the heavy blanket were Blake\u2019s arms around me.</p><p>I let the tears fall. Wave after wave, until sleep turned everything to black.</p><p>CHAPTER EIGHT</p><p>\u201cErica...wake up.\u201d</p><p>I jolted awake, eyes wide as the now bright room came into focus. My heart was beating too fast, as if some latent panic still lingered with me. Blake was standing beside me, sipping coffee. He was fully dressed in slacks and a freshly pressed shirt. I relaxed a little, grateful he was there at all.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re meeting Alex for lunch. He texted me that he was running late, but you should get ready.\u201d</p><p>I sat up slowly and pulled the covers up to hide my nakedness. I rubbed my eyes, waiting for the sleepiness to ebb. I glanced at the clock. I\u2019d slept for nearly twelve hours, but my body felt drugged, exhausted to the bone. Slowly I began to remember the night. I hadn\u2019t had a drop of alcohol, but somehow I felt hung over. As promised, Blake had given my ass the beating of a lifetime last night. I searched for anger, but my heart just ached with sadness and regret.</p><p>When I sought his gaze, he walked away and turned his attention to his phone. \u201cYou should get cleaned up.\u201d</p> <p>I rested back against the pillows. My hand went to the mess of my hair, and my thoughts went to how our night had ended. Alone. So far apart. Cringing, I found the strength to get on my feet. My movements were far from spry as I walked to the bathroom. My muscles were stiff, and a dull headache throbbed behind my eyes.</p><p>I lingered in the shower, escaping under the hot spray as if somehow the water could wash away the lingering hurt that filled me. Thoughts of James and the mistake I\u2019d made that both of us were paying for shuttered through my tired brain. Blake was fiercely jealous, but I could see the pain I\u2019d caused him last night.</p><p>He\u2019d walked away from me, leaving me alone with the intensity of what we\u2019d done without so much as a word. We\u2019d had intense nights before. He\u2019d pushed me to the edge, and we\u2019d crashed over together. For better or worse, we\u2019d ended those nights together. Not last night, and when he left me alone, we\u2019d crossed a line. He\u2019d breached some new invisible boundary I\u2019d never known was there. Perhaps I\u2019d crossed a line too, with what I\u2019d done to set him off. But the empty feeling he\u2019d left me with wasn\u2019t like anything I\u2019d ever felt with him before. That emptiness cast a shadow on all the pain and punishment he\u2019d doled out, making it all that much darker.</p><p>The heat of the shower was making me weak and tired all over again. I turned it off and stepped out to towel myself dry, acutely aware that Blake was on the other side of that door with my heart in his hands. We had to talk about what went down at some point, but it wasn\u2019t going to be an easy conversation. My head wasn\u2019t in the right place to pitch Alex right now either, but somehow that didn\u2019t matter as much as it should have.</p><p>Blake worked at his laptop while I dressed for the meeting. We didn\u2019t speak. As if compelled by some magnetic force, my gaze kept drifting his way. If he sensed it, he didn\u2019t show it, his focus seemingly undeterred.</p><p>If he had wanted to talk, what would I have said anyway? Instead, I fell into step behind him as we entered the restaurant downstairs and took our table. I tried to mask a wince as I lowered into my seat. I couldn\u2019t ignore the discomfort of my rather bruised ass, but I didn\u2019t want to give Blake the satisfaction of knowing it bothered me.</p><p>When Alex arrived, he greeted me. I smiled weakly and kept up with niceties. Something about leaving the party early because I didn\u2019t feel well. True enough, I hadn\u2019t. He wanted to know more details, work out the logistics with Clozpin. I nodded, but the fire that might have taken over and pulled me through the conversation wasn\u2019t there. I simply stared at my lunch, not hungry in the least. My thoughts circled around what had gone down between Blake and me. What else mattered when things weren\u2019t right between us?</p><p>An awkward silence fell, but the part of me that might have cared simply didn\u2019t. Blake\u2019s hand went to my knee under the table and squeezed me gently. I glanced up. My heart pulsed against my chest at the contact, as if it had only started beating again in that moment. He frowned slightly, questioning me, but when I went to speak, tears filled my eyes. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAlex, we\u2019ll be right back,\u201d he said quickly.</p><p>In a blur, we left the table and found some privacy at the other side of the restaurant. The darkness wrapped around us. His body came close, seeming to force the air from my lungs. I waited for him to touch me. I needed him to touch me or I was going to break.</p><p>Gently, he brought his hands up and framed my face. I sighed, my earlier fatigue taking hold again. He tilted my head up, bringing us eye to eye. Those eyes that undid me, that stormed with darkness and passion\u2014everything I had come to love about the man\u2014stared down at me.</p><p>I love you. I wanted to tell him. I wanted to let the words spill out again and again until he said it back.</p> <p>\u201cBlake...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>He thumbed my cheek. More contact, every touch overwhelmed me. My eyes brimmed with tears that began to fall now. My hands went to his chest, wanting to feel his heat, his strength.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t do this, Blake. Not right now. I\u2019m sorry... I just can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He hushed me and brushed away the tears. \u201cI can take care of it, okay?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, I can\u2019t mess this up. I need to be there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t messing anything up. It\u2019s fine. I\u2019ll talk to Alex. Go up and rest.\u201d He gripped my shoulders and skimmed down my arms, resting there only a moment before he left. Before I could call him back, he was out of sight, and I was alone again.</p><p>I walked quickly to the elevators, my head down to hide the mess of my face. I brushed away my tears but they kept coming. What the hell was wrong with me?</p><p>Back upstairs, I scanned the empty room. Empty, like my hollow, painful heart. I wanted Blake here. I hated that he wasn\u2019t, but I was in no condition to face Alex and talk business right now. Ironic, since that was the entire purpose for the trip.</p><p>Without undressing, I fell back into the unmade bed. I\u2019d woken without his touch and here I was, barely surviving without it. I began to drift off, ready for home, praying that somehow I could wake up and start all over.</p><p>I took a seat at the head of the conference table and waited for the rest of the team to settle around me. After sleeping away most of the afternoon in the hotel room and on the red-eye home, I should have been rested. Some of the heavy emotional fog had lifted. Enough that when Blake eventually briefed me on his meeting with Alex, my brain reluctantly shifted back into business mode. The terms they\u2019d agreed to were good, better than I would have pushed for or even asked for. I wanted to be surprised, but with Blake behind the wheel, I shouldn\u2019t have expected anything less. All I needed to do was seize the opportunity while it was there and act now so we could stay ahead.</p> <p>\u201cHow was San Francisco?\u201d</p><p>Alli\u2019s voice interrupted my wandering thoughts. She\u2019d settled into the seat beside me. I met her brown eyes, wishing that somehow I could explain all of this to her. My sweet, loving friend. I didn\u2019t know where to begin. How would I broach the topic of being punished by my future husband because I\u2019d been caught in a lip lock with one of my employees when Blake and I had been broken up? God, my current dilemma sounded all kinds of fucked up.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d I lied.</p><p>My whole body ached, from the sex, sure, but hours had gone by without any real emotion between Blake and me. On the trip home, everything had been matter-of-fact between us. But I could sense his hesitation, the strain that came through with the short delivery of every word, the careful avoidance of my stares as I silently begged him for more. A look, a touch, anything to let me know we were okay.</p><p>Too wiped out to push him, I simply went through the motions. It was a remembered feeling, one I had brought on myself not so long ago when we\u2019d been separated under very different circumstances. All of it wore on me now. I hated not knowing what he was thinking, and a part of me was afraid of what he\u2019d say if I dared ask. I needed to believe that we\u2019d get through this, that there was a light at the end of this tunnel. If I thought for a second that we couldn\u2019t\u2014that we wouldn\u2019t\u2014I wasn\u2019t sure I could go on.</p><p>Gradually people pulled up their chairs, and I jotted down some last minute notes. I pushed down all the fears, silently refusing to let the events of the weekend derail my entire day. Despite everything, we had work to do, and I had to push on.</p><p>James dropped into the seat opposite Blake. The air grew thick around me, filling the space between them. It crackled with their distaste for one another. The clarity I was grasping scattered when I caught Blake\u2019s stare. James shifted in his seat as Blake leveled a look so venomous, I wouldn\u2019t have been surprised to find them at each other\u2019s throats, literally, in a matter of seconds.</p><p>I cursed inwardly, questioning how Blake had convinced me to let him drive this meeting knowing James would be there too, right in the thick of it. I might have guessed that Blake would be looking for an opportunity to meet him head on, to start something that he could finish.</p> <p>I hurried to speak and shift their attention to the matters at hand.</p><p>\u201cThis weekend Blake and I met with a prospective partner, Alex Hannon, who\u2019s given us the go-ahead to refer ecommerce sales to his site, in return for increased exposure and commissions for us. We\u2019re still working out the finer details, but this is a huge break for our growth, to expand beyond what we\u2019ve been doing and broaden our reach. We\u2019ll need to make some adjustments to our platform to maximize this opportunity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny updates with advertisers?\u201d James asked, tempering my good news with the cold reality of the hit we\u2019d already taken as a result of the competing site\u2019s endeavors.</p><p>Alli chimed in. \u201cNo one else has pulled their account since last week, so maybe Risa\u2019s grabbed all the low-hanging fruit, so to speak. Hopefully the rest remain loyal through this expansion.\u201d</p><p>I masked a grimace. I had a few other choice monikers for Risa I would have rather used.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the timeline?\u201d Chris, our resident Hawaiian shirt-wearing developer, spoke up.</p><p>\u201cAs soon as possible. I know it\u2019ll be tricky to build this out while maintaining what we have. But I figure with what we\u2019ve been through with the hacking attempts, we can multi-task easily on this. Sid, can you start looking into their API?\u201d</p><p>Blake offered him a stack of papers. \u201cI have the documentation for you. Alex and I went through it. Should be pretty straightforward to implement.\u201d</p><p>Sid reached for it, his eyes wide. I cracked a small smile, not quite ready to celebrate but grateful at least to have Sid\u2019s interest. Seeing the plan moving forward was a little scary. I was wandering into uncharted waters, but this was what we had to do. Sink or swim, and I was determined that we would survive. This opportunity with Alex promised to be the lifeline we needed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The rest of the meeting went well as I divvied up tasks among everyone. In the process I began to feel more grounded than I had been. I\u2019d only been away the weekend, but I\u2019d returned completely off kilter. Being with the team again had grounded me, and I was eager to dig into this new work. The tension rolling off Blake had eased, so maybe the same was true for him. Still, James sent me a few concerning looks. As always, he knew something was up, that I was off. Except I had no idea how I\u2019d ever tell him why. A weary sigh left me. What I wouldn\u2019t give to turn back time.</p><p>The meeting ended and people began to disperse. I gathered my notes, preparing to return to my desk and dive into my day.</p><p>\u201cWe need to talk.\u201d</p><p>Blake\u2019s voice was low, the threatening tone unmistakable. I looked up to find him fixed on James.</p> <p>James sat unmoving behind a mask of supposed indifference. \u201cAbout?\u201d</p><p>Blake rose slowly. \u201cI think it\u2019s better discussed in private. Shall we?\u201d He gestured toward the door.</p><p>James casually shoved out of his chair and led the way. My heart was beating wildly as I scanned the office. No one seemed the wiser. Hurriedly I followed. They\u2019d moved a few feet down the hallway by the time I\u2019d joined them, closing the door behind me.</p><p>Blake stood across from James, his stance wide and his arms across his chest. \u201cI wanted to be the one to tell you that you\u2019ll be giving your notice. Preferably this week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d James\u2019s posture tensed. \u201cErica\u2019s my boss, not you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s not the point. You\u2019ll be leaving.\u201d</p><p>Blake\u2019s tone left no doubt. Anger and confusion whipped through me. I wanted Blake to know how sorry I was, how desperate I was to make this right between us. But he was attacking me where I felt it most. My business. My livelihood. The safe place that was mine and only mine, and he was casting a shadow over it all with these demands.</p><p>\u201cBlake, what are you doing? Stop this.\u201d I took a step closer, hoping no one in the office could hear us.</p><p>He turned to me, his eyes colored with all the hurt I\u2019d caused, compounded with the rage he\u2019d focused onto James. \u201cHe\u2019s leaving, Erica. It\u2019s that simple. Unless you\u2019d like me to leave instead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t mean that.\u201d I stared hard at him, almost too tired to test his resolve.</p><p>James\u2019s soft chuckle broke our standoff. His cool blue stare fixed on Blake, his hands fisted tightly by his sides. \u201cYou really let success get to your head don\u2019t you, Landon? You think you can march around here and bark orders. What kind of smug bastard does that? And you have the balls to lay a hand on her. I should beat the hell out of you so you know what it feels like.\u201d</p> <p>Blake snapped to face James again, his jaw twitching. \u201cWhat the fuck are you talking about? I\u2019ve never hit her.\u201d</p><p>I took a tentative step forward, not entirely comfortable with physically coming between them right now. With all the emotions flying around, I didn\u2019t trust that I wouldn\u2019t get hurt in the fray.</p><p>\u201cJames, no. You don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou told him I hit you?\u201d</p><p>I met Blake\u2019s imploring look full of confusion, maybe even a hint of guilt. But he had it all wrong. My heart fell, tears threatening.</p><p>\u201cNo. God, just stop, both of you.\u201d</p><p>James took a careful step toward me, his voice softer. \u201cYou don\u2019t need this shit, Erica. Say the word, and I\u2019ll have him out of here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike hell you will.\u201d</p> <p>Blake shoved James then, his slightly shorter frame hitting the wall. James reacted immediately, throwing a punch that Blake narrowly avoided. The two men skirmished. They pushed and pulled until I was certain they\u2019d tear each other apart if I stood idly by. I was desperate to make them stop.</p><p>\u201cIt was Daniel,\u201d I yelled, no longer clinging to that secret truth if it meant they\u2019d stop this madness.</p><p>Blake shoved James off, and for the moment he kept a distance, as they both heaved for air, eyes wild with fury.</p><p>A look of confusion softened James\u2019s anger slightly. \u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s\u2014it\u2019s not important. But the day you saw me that way, I\u2019d just seen him. We had a fight, and...\u201d I sighed, the weight of the past forty-eight hours crashing down on me in an instant. \u201cHe hit me.\u201d</p><p>Silence fell. No words, no fists. Neither man moved.</p><p>The look on Blake\u2019s face gutted me. As if learning about James hadn\u2019t been enough, these words cast a shade of betrayal across his features that made me want to go to him then. To hold him to me and say sorry all over again. For all of it.</p><p>\u201cFirst this,\u201d Blake said, pointing to James, \u201cand now you\u2019re telling me that Daniel hit you. What the hell is going on, Erica? Is there anything else you want to tell me? Let\u2019s just get it all out.\u201d</p><p>My lip quivered, tears threatening again. Too wrapped up in his own anger, he wouldn\u2019t feel my remorse today. I was alone with it. Alone and scrambling to keep some semblance of peace between my personal and professional life. A lost cause if I\u2019d ever seen one.</p><p>\u201cYou should go. Both of you. Just leave.\u201d The last words caught in my throat, lacking conviction and reflecting my frayed nerves.</p><p>James cursed and left us alone, his footsteps disappearing down the stairwell. The door slammed shut below, the sound echoing up to us. Blake stood motionless, his stare burning into me. The silence was painful, my own thoughts reeling and loud amidst it.</p><p>I could almost hear his too. More questions of why. Why had I been so stupid? So stubborn? When I looked up into his wounded eyes, they confirmed it. The effort to restrain his anger, the culmination of all the hurt, was evident in his posture. The muscles of his arms were taut and coiled, no doubt still primed to punch James into next week.</p><p>I would have apologized, tried to bring him back to me, if I weren\u2019t so goddamn angry at myself now. I knew he was jealous, but he\u2019d taken it too far. He had no right to confront James and step into my business that way. No matter what had happened.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t even know what to say to you,\u201d he finally said.</p><p>\u201cThen don\u2019t say anything at all. Blake...I\u2019m exhausted, I\u2019m sore, and I\u2019m ready to seriously lose it. I don\u2019t need you berating me, making this all my fault.\u201d My voice wavered as I brushed away a tear that had broken free. \u201cMaybe it is, but I can\u2019t bear you telling me that right now. I can\u2019t take it.\u201d</p><p>He hesitated a moment, that heavy silence filling the space between us again. Then, without another word, he left. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Out of my world again. I watched his retreat, relieved of the pressure of his resentment, yet infinitely more miserable than I\u2019d been before.</p><p>CHAPTER NINE</p><p>I hesitated in the hallway, my hand resting on the door. Alli\u2019s laughter with others carried beyond the walls of their new apartment. I wanted to celebrate and be happy for Alli and Heath, but I was on the other side of that emotion as long as Blake was keeping me at arm\u2019s length.</p><p>He\u2019d taken my request to not say anything at all and to leave too literally. A couple days had gone by. He\u2019d worked late again last night, arriving after I\u2019d fallen asleep and rising before I had. The only proof of his being there was an empty coffee mug in the sink. He always seemed just beyond my grasp, and though I was angry too, the distance was tearing me up inside.</p> <p>I took a breath and pushed open the door, not remotely prepared for all the love that rushed around me whenever I was around Blake\u2019s family. All of it was infectious too though, so I held some hope that they could pull me, and maybe even Blake too, out of this funk.</p><p>As if in perfect reflection of Alli and Heath\u2019s energy, the apartment hummed with laughter, the buzz of conversation, and Alli\u2019s loud whoop when the cork popped off the champagne.</p><p>\u201cErica!\u201d</p><p>Blake\u2019s younger sister, Fiona, ran over to hug me as I stepped into the main area. Catherine was right behind her, coming for a warm embrace as soon as Fiona stepped away.</p><p>\u201cHow are you, honey? You look wonderful.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m good. Thanks.\u201d I gave a weak smile, self-consciously glancing down at the outfit I\u2019d thrown together. I was surprised I wasn\u2019t wearing two different shoes for how focused my brain had been lately. Black skirt, top, and ballet flats. That was hard to screw up.</p><p>When I met Catherine\u2019s gaze again, a line of worry marked her forehead. I brightened instantly and plastered on a happy face. No matter what, I didn\u2019t want my problems with Blake to upset Alli\u2019s party. This was an important moment for her and Heath, and I was already worried about stealing her thunder with all this wedding madness that she reassured me we had to cover tonight.</p><p>Alli joined us, grabbed my hand, and pulled me farther in. \u201cLet me give you the tour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d I gave Heath and Greg a small wave before they disappeared out of view.</p><p>Alli took me room by room, through the space. The apartment lacked for nothing, on par with what I would expect from any Landon property. Warm colors, spacious rooms, and tasteful design. Some rooms were still cluttered with boxes, but for the most part, it already felt like a home, theirs.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful, Alli.\u201d</p> <p>Her shoulders crept higher as she smiled. \u201cThanks. I love it. I\u2019m so excited to make it ours. Heath has been working a lot, but hopefully soon we can do a little more to it.\u201d</p><p>I smiled too, appreciating how far she and Heath had come. He\u2019d only been out of rehab a couple weeks but they were now well on their way to better, to a normal life together. Alli was hard at work re-immersing in my business and Heath was doing the same with Blake\u2019s. Blake wanted him more involved, and from everything I\u2019d heard, he was taking the bull by the horns, investing himself more heavily than he ever had before.</p><p>Deep down I was happy for them, so very happy. But I couldn\u2019t help but draw parallels to Blake and me. Even sharing an apartment, we felt farther apart than when I\u2019d lived a floor below. Moving in together had been easy, too easy almost. I was hesitant at first, but at Blake\u2019s insistence, my overstuffed trash bags that I\u2019d moved a couple months earlier from the Harvard dorms took another trip up a flight of stairs. In less than twenty-four hours, my life had melded even more firmly into the organized wealth of his. While I enjoyed sharing the space, the apartment never really felt like mine, not the way Alli felt about this place now.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so happy for you,\u201d I said, trying to keep my voice steady as Alli looked to me for reassurance, for my support as her best friend.</p><p>She smiled, content, and hooked her arm in mine. \u201cThanks, hon. I am happy. Now let\u2019s go get extra happy and drink some champagne. We need to talk wedding details and work out the last stuff for the party with Fiona.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe party?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes shot up, her hand going to her mouth. \u201cOh shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh shit shit shit. Just forget I said it.\u201d</p><p>I stopped our exit from the room. \u201cSeriously, Alli. Just spill it.\u201d</p><p>Her shoulders slumped. \u201cIt was supposed to be a surprise. Catherine wants to throw you two a little engagement party.\u201d</p><p>I lifted my eyebrows. \u201cDoes Blake know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t anyone tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe thought it would be fun to make it a surprise. I know you\u2019ve been stressed with everything that\u2019s going down with the business right now. We didn\u2019t want to add one more thing to your plate. And it\u2019s no big deal, really. Just a small party at their house with some friends of the family who wanted to meet you and catch up with everyone.\u201d</p><p>On cue, my stomach rolled. I couldn\u2019t imagine who friends of the family entailed, but considering how tense things were between Blake and me, I could very well be flying solo for much of the event. That thought was far from comforting.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay with that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I insisted. \u201cIt sounds like fun. If I can help with anything let me know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. I think Catherine\u2019s got everything covered. All you two need to do is show up and be yourselves.\u201d</p><p>She grabbed my hand and gave me a reassuring squeeze as we reemerged into the main living area. Fiona was filling the flutes, getting as close to the rim as she could without the foam spilling over.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019d the guys go?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Fiona sat back onto the couch with her glass. \u201cUpstairs. There\u2019s a rooftop deck. Really nice after the sun goes down on nights like this.\u201d</p><p>I wondered if Blake had arrived and was already up there with his dad and brother, but I was embarrassed to admit that I had almost no idea where he\u2019d been for the past day and night. I wanted to believe today might be different. The company of his family always seemed to make Blake seem more human, less godlike in a way. Maybe around them we could let down this wall between us so we could talk, really talk. Newly engaged, we were supposed to be in love, stable, wanting to be with each other. Right now we could barely share a room without palpable tension between us. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Alli and I sat down on the large sectional across from Fiona. I admired the open space and light that filled it through a bay window at the front.</p><p>\u201cI think we should toast. To the move.\u201d Fiona tipped her glass to Alli. \u201cAnd of course to Blake and Erica\u2019s engagement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCheers,\u201d we sang in unison.</p><p>I relaxed back, taking a sip. Maybe this is what I needed while Blake cooled off. A little champagne and girl time.</p> <p>Alli wasted no time rummaging through her purse on the floor.</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of engagements.\u201d</p><p>She pulled out a sizeable stack of wedding magazines adorned with colorful bookmarks. My eagerness for girl time came to a skidding halt.</p><p>\u201cObviously the most important thing is picking out your dress, Erica, but we need to decide on colors tonight, because it\u2019s driving me nuts not knowing, and I\u2019m selfish like that.\u201d</p><p>I laughed softly. I hadn\u2019t given it a single thought. At least not since middle school when pink and purple were on the top of every little girl\u2019s list.</p> <p>Fiona repositioned herself on the other side of Alli. \u201cOh, I love this one. But maybe in navy.\u201d She pointed to one of the models.</p><p>Alli pursed her lips. \u201cI don\u2019t know. If we\u2019re doing beachside, there might not be enough contrast. What about mauve, or something really bright, like fuchsia?\u201d</p><p>Fiona laughed. \u201cMaking Blake and Heath wear pink vests and ties would be amazing.\u201d</p><p>Alli joined her laughter. Before long their brainstorming had degraded to pink glittering cummerbunds and they were nearly falling off the couch with giggles. I was willing to give them the go ahead if it meant talking about anything else. Then I heard some clatter in the kitchen and remembered Catherine was prepping dinner for our whole group on her own. The men were still nowhere in sight.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to go check on dinner. I\u2019ll be back in a minute.\u201d</p><p>I disappeared into the kitchen and found Catherine stirring something in a large steaming pot. Dinner smelled Italian and delicious. I was suddenly hungry though I hadn\u2019t had much of an appetite today.</p> <p>\u201cHey, honey. Can I get you something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no. I\u2019m fine. I was just wondering if you needed help with anything.\u201d</p><p>Catherine smiled. \u201cI think I\u2019ve got it covered. Go hang out with the girls.\u201d</p><p>I surveyed the large designer kitchen, wishing I could find a mess to clean. Anything to give me an excuse not to go for a few more minutes. Back to the bridesmaid\u2019s den.</p><p>What the hell was wrong with me? Didn\u2019t every woman on the planet want to get caught up in this whole process? How could I run a fashion start-up and lack the slightest interest in the finer details of what was shaping up to be a wedding far beyond anything I would have ever imagined? \u201cBig white wedding\u201d was being given new meaning with each passing moment as Alli and Fiona vied for confirmation of their opinions.</p><p>I bit my lip and searched my brain for an excuse to stay.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m fine.\u201d I nodded. I wouldn\u2019t mind disappearing into the floor right now though. \u201cI just needed a break I guess. They\u2019re...\u201d</p> <p>She lifted the corner of her mouth, quiet understanding in her eyes. \u201cDriving you nuts?\u201d</p><p>I laughed. \u201cMaybe a little.\u201d</p><p>New peals of laughter echoed from the living room and we shared a knowing look.</p><p>\u201cAlli accidentally let it slip about the engagement party. Thank you. You didn\u2019t have to do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh! Nonsense. I want to. You have no idea how excited our family is about the news. They can\u2019t wait to meet you. Honestly, they can\u2019t wait to see Blake either. He can be a little reclusive when it comes to making appearances for extended family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, thank you, again. I feel bad because I should probably be thinking of things like that. I should probably be doing a dozen things that haven\u2019t even occurred to me lately.\u201d</p><p>Everything was moving too fast. Work. Wedding plans. As if that weren\u2019t enough, this clash with Blake was threatening to throw everything else completely off kilter.</p><p>\u201cBlake\u2019s a take charge kind of guy, but I don\u2019t suppose he\u2019s much help with wedding planning.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cI guess not.\u201d</p><p>I glanced around the room nervously, my gaze landing anywhere but her face. When she grew silent, I chanced a look. Her eyebrows wrinkled. She stepped closer and covered my hand with hers.</p><p>\u201cIs everything okay between you two?\u201d she asked gently. \u201cI hope you don\u2019t mind me saying this, but you don\u2019t look like a girl who\u2019s happily engaged at the moment.\u201d</p><p>I swallowed over the knot in my throat. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing to worry about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he upset you?\u201d</p><p>My heart twisted, and I squeezed my eyes closed. How could I begin to put into words what had happened between us these past few days? I simply nodded, unable to hide the hurt. \u201cWe upset each other. We were both wrong. And things have been tense. It\u2019s been difficult to talk lately.\u201d</p><p>I stared down, scuffing my toe against the slate tile floor. \u201cSometimes he\u2019s just completely overwhelming. Maddening, really.\u201d</p><p>She laughed softly. \u201cI could have told you that. Try raising him.\u201d</p><p>I gave her a weak smile. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a difficult young man. He always has been. He\u2019s my son, and I will love him no matter what, but he\u2019s about as stubborn as they come. But somehow I knew from the moment I met you that you were good for him. I pray every day that he\u2019s good for you too. He\u2019s changed, in so many good ways. I\u2019ve never seen him as tender as he is with you, Erica. Something is different. It\u2019s little things, but I see it.\u201d</p><p>Tears burned in my eyes. Before I could say anything or find an excuse to leave, she pulled me to her. I hugged her back.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t give up on him,\u201d she whispered. \u201cIf anyone can get through to him and break through those walls, it\u2019s you.\u201d</p><p>I pulled back slightly and brushed away the tears that had fallen. \u201cI just wish I didn\u2019t feel so far away from him right now.\u201d</p><p>Blake\u2019s voice carried through the apartment, mingled with Heath\u2019s and his father\u2019s. My heart leapt with sudden anticipation. He was here.</p><p>\u201cBlake!\u201d Catherine called out in the direction the living room, releasing me from her embrace.</p><p>I wiped my eyes again, hoping to hide any signs of my upset. A few seconds later, Blake had joined us. He held his ground a few steps inside the doorway, his hands unmoving in the pockets of his jeans. My heart stopped at how drop-dead gorgeous he could look with so little effort. All mine, I reassured myself, yet that\u2019s not entirely how I felt lately. His green-eyed gaze passed between us, pausing on me. I looked away, wanting to hide my recent vulnerability, but I knew I\u2019d given myself away the second he saw me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBlake.\u201d Catherine\u2019s tone hardened. \u201cYou need to speak to Erica. Everyone here is celebrating and making a fuss and this poor child is in tears over you. You need to start talking.\u201d</p><p>He stared at her a moment, his expression unchanged. \u201cMom, I\u2019m not talking to you about this.\u201d</p><p>She grimaced. \u201cAren\u2019t you the genius of the family? Good heavens, I don\u2019t expect you to talk to me about it. Speak to your fianc\u00e9e, soon to be your wife. You fix whatever you broke here, and that\u2019s all I have to say on the matter.\u201d</p><p>She gave him a hard stare and then softened when she faced me again. She gave my hand a reassuring squeeze.</p> <p>Without a word Blake turned. He passed through the kitchen and disappeared into the hallway beyond. I followed him until we were alone in one of the nearly empty rooms I\u2019d seen earlier. This would be their home office. Two desks lined the wall, already cluttered with a stack of papers.</p><p>Blake stood in the middle of the room, his back to me. I closed the door behind me and leaned against it.</p><p>The sudden privacy also meant silence, an awkward empty silence between us. I searched for words, for something that could possibly bring us back to where we\u2019d been before San Francisco. But I didn\u2019t know what to say to him now. He\u2019d be angry with me for breaking down in front of his mother, not that I\u2019d ever dream of telling her what had happened between us.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m guessing you want to talk,\u201d he said quietly, turning to face me.</p><p>I nodded and swallowed over the knot in my throat. I didn\u2019t want to talk here, but who knew when I would have his attention again. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to do this here, but you\u2019ve been gone. She started asking about us, and I just lost it. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m here now.\u201d</p><p>His voice was quieter as he took a step closer. He paused a few feet in front of me, his hands still casually nested in his pockets. Usually I enjoyed the posture, that could give a shit attitude that rolled off him sometimes, usually when it came to work. I remembered then how he\u2019d looked when he dropped into the seat in front of me at the Angelcom boardroom, seemingly unaffected. I was as annoyed as I was painfully attracted to him. Today I knew better. I knew he cared, but I was no less conflicted about how I felt about our situation right now.</p><p>\u201cBlake...you hurt me.\u201d</p><p>His jaw tightened and several empty seconds passed.</p><p>\u201cI warned you that if you opened the door to that part of me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not talking about physical pain,\u201d I said. \u201cI know we\u2019ll be angry sometimes, and we\u2019ll hurt each other. That\u2019s inevitable. I know that we\u2019ll take it out on each other in different ways. I\u2019ll admit the other night was difficult for me, not because that\u2019s anything we haven\u2019t done before, but because in the end, all I could feel was your anger. That wounded me far worse than anything physical could have, because I felt like you hated me, and that you wanted to hurt me. Maybe it made you feel better\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt didn\u2019t, trust me.\u201d A grimace pinched his features.</p><p>\u201cThen why? You left me there like it meant nothing to you. It\u2019s like you\u2019re shutting me out to punish me even more. When is it going to end? How many different ways do I have to say that I\u2019m sorry, that I made a stupid mistake I wish I could take back?\u201d</p><p>He turned away slightly, raking his fingers through his hair. The dark brown strands stuck every which way.</p><p>\u201cIt should have never happened.\u201d</p><p>I sagged against the door. \u201cI know that. I wish it hadn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He faced me again. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think you fully understand. The things that happened when we were apart... all of that happened because you didn\u2019t trust me to handle Daniel threatening you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is true, Erica. If you had, we would have never been apart. James would have never had a chance to get that close to you when you were vulnerable.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI thought Daniel was going to kill you. Do you understand that? I was falling apart missing you, wishing I could find a way to save our relationship, but when I saw you with Sophia that night, and then Risa, something in me just gave up. I knew we were over, that I\u2019d lost you. It had nothing to do with wanting James. It had everything to do with feeling so goddamn empty inside without you that I let him get too close.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you really think I would have let Daniel hurt me or you? Do you think for a second I wouldn\u2019t have moved hell and earth to make sure you were safe from that maniac? Instead you fucking ripped my heart out.\u201d</p><p>The hurt inflected with the words was real. I knew, because I\u2019d lived that torture too. In fear of Daniel\u2019s threats, I\u2019d put us both through weeks of hell.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t just about James, though I\u2019m not happy it happened, believe me. But this was another ugly reminder of that entire situation. You\u2019d been through a lot with Daniel, and I didn\u2019t want to put you through any more. But the reality of it is that you put us both in more danger because you wouldn\u2019t come to me for help. How am I supposed to be your husband when you won\u2019t let me protect you? Goddamnit, Erica, I\u2019ve gone against every instinct giving you the space you need, and where has it gotten us?\u201d</p><p>My lips trembled as I absorbed the fierceness of his words. \u201cI made a mistake. I was scared, and all that mattered at the time was knowing you were safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many more times are you going to put us through this, because you\u2019re too goddamn stubborn to trust me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou're punishing me for choices I already made, things I can't undo. Things are different now.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cAre they? Can you tell me that you wouldn't make the exact same choices? Because I can tell you right now, if you'd known, intrinsically and without a doubt to come to me when Daniel threatened you, all of that would have played out differently. And all this time I warned you about James. I knew it. I fucking knew he was getting too close to you, and you kept him around. What\u2019s more, you're still doing it, even though you know it's making me crazy. I want to tear the motherfucker apart for having his hands on you. Do you understand what it does to me, Erica?\u201d</p><p>I blinked away tears at this onslaught. Days with nothing, and now this. \u201cBlake...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want control, Erica. But I'm not going to take it from you. You have to give it to me. You opened the door. Now you have to walk through it. You've tried to draw this hard line between us, with work and our relationship, where you keep the amount of control you think you need. It ends now.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My stomach tightened with that familiar urge to run, to push him away. I didn\u2019t know if I could ever give him the kind of control he wanted. What if I couldn\u2019t, ever?</p><p>\u201cWhat are you saying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI'm saying that you've said you want me, all of me. And this is who I am. The shit that went down with Daniel...and now James. Nothing like that can happen ever again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don't want it to,\u201d I insisted.</p> <p>\u201cAnd I'll guarantee that it doesn't.\u201d</p><p>My jaw fell open a fraction, the words lost in what he was saying. He had to know how impossible it was, what he was asking of me. Why couldn\u2019t dominating me in the bedroom be enough?</p><p>\u201cIs this about me being your submissive? You want me to play some Dom/sub game with you? That's fine, Blake. I\u2019ll beg, I\u2019ll kneel, but I'm not letting it trickle into my professional life. I have boundaries, and you need to understand that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn't a game for me. And that way of thinking is exactly the problem.\u201d</p><p>He took a step closer, leveling me with his eyes. Defensively, I leaned back, now pressed firmly against the door. He rested his hands on either side of me, our bodies nearly touching, not giving me an inch. I couldn\u2019t think straight this way, this close. He held me in his steady gaze, no shred of doubt to be found there. His voice was low when he spoke again.</p> <p>\u201cHow does it feel, Erica, when you give me control?\u201d</p><p>That was a loaded question, but I could tell we were no longer talking about Daniel or James. His countenance had softened, the hard intensity there morphing into something else. Something sexual. No less intense, the energy was palpable. It resonated between us, lighting sparks over my skin everywhere he touched. A fingertip over the bow of my mouth, his thumb on the racing pulse at my neck. God, I wanted his hands everywhere now.</p><p>\u201cYou let everything go, and it feels good, doesn\u2019t it? To know I\u2019m taking care of you, of us. That no matter what, I\u2019ll get us there.\u201d</p><p>He grazed his hand lower, his palm skimming over my breast and down my torso, as if he were marking all the places that were his domain. On my body, the places were many.</p><p>\u201cHave I ever left you unsatisfied? Has there ever been a time between us, no matter how far I've pushed you, when you haven't begged for more? When you haven\u2019t come hard screaming my name? Tell me if you haven't.\u201d</p><p>My breath left me and I struggled to replace it. I shook my head, knowing the answer as well as he did. Heat prickled under my skin and pulsed between my legs at the reminder of what he could do to my body, the power he wielded so easily. That kind of domination I could embrace. In fact I didn\u2019t want that part of him to change, ever.</p> <p>He leaned in. The smallest brush of his mouth teased my lips. I arched up to meet him fully but he pulled back, leaving me wanting, dizzy with it. I drew in a shaky breath, trying to get sober from this spell he\u2019d put me under. With promises of the control I was already a slave to, he was luring me into something that meant far more.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShowing you what you want, what we need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know that's not what this is about. I know I can give you anything and you\u2019ll be there for me. But you can\u2019t... you can\u2019t hold me down, stake your claim over me, and expect me to let you own me.\u201d</p><p>His eyebrows shot up. \u201cIs that so? That\u2019s not what you said the other night. I heard the words, loud and clear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs if you gave me any choice. Dangle me on the edge of an orgasm like that and I\u2019ll tell you you\u2019re the emperor of Rome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to be owned, is that it? You don\u2019t want to belong to me as much as I want to belong to you, is that right?\u201d</p><p>A dull ache began in my chest at the words. I couldn\u2019t resolve what he was saying with the fears I couldn\u2019t seem to shake about someone else controlling my life.</p> <p>\u201cI've never had to rely on anyone, answer to anyone. You know this, and you keep trying to change me, as if somehow I can turn that off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you marry me, that is going to change. Permanently.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt means you come to me before you even begin to consider making a rash decision. It means you involve me so I can make sure you do, which includes removing James from your business. It means you ask me for help when you need it, and you don't keep secrets from me, ever. And when a situation arises that makes more sense for me to manage, you let me. No matter what.\u201d</p><p>He leaned in close again, his serious gaze flickering over my features, tracing a soft line down my jawline. When he spoke again, his voice was a whisper.</p><p>\u201cIt means that every waking breath you take, every step you take, you don't just take to move your own life forward, but ours. You take it knowing I'm right there with you, irrevocably tied to every decision you make.\u201d</p><p>My chest ached with the effort to fill my lungs with a full breath. One after the next as I grappled with what he was saying. He wasn\u2019t giving me room to run, to fight, nothing.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I feel like you're giving me an ultimatum.\u201d</p><p>My eyes were wide as I questioned him, hoping I was reading this all wrong. The serious look in his eye answered me before he could.</p><p>\u201cI want it all, Erica. I won't accept any less. Wrap your head around it, or\u2014\u201d</p><p>I tried to still the tremble that worked its way through me. How could he ask me this? Threaten me with our relationship? I felt like a caged animal who\u2019d been backed into a corner.</p><p>\u201cOr what?\u201d The words came out sharp, laced with challenge.</p><p>His hold on my waist tightened, mimicking the restless working of his jaw. Before I could gauge how pissed he was at my challenge, his lips crashed down onto mine. Now hard and demanding, he sought entrance. I opened for him, barely prepared for the devouring passion of his tongue. Curses rumbled through his chest, muffled in the wild merging of our mouths. The onslaught of his fervency shot through me, revving all my instincts to return his passion.</p><p>I kissed him back, fisting my hands in his shirt to urge us together. Tongues tangling, teeth biting, we melded hotly into each other. Pinned by his hips, I felt the unmistakable stirring of his erection pressed against me. He palmed my thigh, raising the hem of my skirt high, making no mistake about what he wanted from me. I sucked in a sharp breath, stifling the loud moan that wanted to burst from my lips when I exhaled.</p><p>He slipped his hand between my legs, rubbing me through my panties, making me crazy for him. A small moan escaped, pleasure overwhelming the rational part of my brain that knew we were in the wrong place for this. My body didn\u2019t care when I was in his clutches. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhy, Erica? Why do you fucking fight me?\u201d</p><p>My hips churned, bucking against his hand. My panties were soaked and I was ready to have him here. When it came to having his hands on me, he\u2019d win every time. Fighting him was a lost cause, and now that I\u2019d been deprived of his touch for so long, I was ready to crawl up his body if it meant ending this distance.</p><p>My hands traveled under his shirt, over his naked torso.</p><p>\u201cI want you...right now.\u201d</p> <p>His breath rushed out, and massaging his fingers against my throbbing sex through the flimsy fabric of my underwear. Curling my fingers, I trailed my nails down his sides, blind with all the ways I wanted him.</p><p>Then another loud pop sounded from the living room. The sound was followed by the familiar voices of his family and Alli\u2019s calling my name, a sobering reminder that we weren\u2019t nearly alone enough to follow through on what we\u2019d started here.</p><p>We broke apart, breathless.</p><p>\u201cChrist.\u201d Blake stepped back unsteadily and readjusted himself.</p><p>Even through his jeans I could see that he was painfully hard, fully ready to fuck me on any surface he could find. In this room, that might have been Heath\u2019s desk. That would have been bad. So very good, but very bad.</p> <p>I swallowed hard, trying like hell to drive my thoughts back to reality. I let my head fall back. My chest heaved even as I hopelessly tried to tame the rush of sexual tension that flowed through me. Fuck. This had to be worse than the seventh circle of hell. He\u2019d taken several steps away, a crushing distance considering how intimately he\u2019d just held me.</p><p>\u201cBlake, I don\u2019t want to fight. Please, let\u2019s go home and just put this all behind us.\u201d</p><p>After a moment, he turned back to me, sending my heart flying again. But I didn\u2019t see resignation in his eyes. Far from it, he seemed to have gathered his resolve in that short moment as I was putting my brain cells back to work.</p><p>\u201cI told you I was sorry, and I meant it,\u201d I pleaded.</p><p>\u201cI know you are. But it\u2019s not enough this time. What I\u2019m asking for... this isn\u2019t what I want. This is what I need. It\u2019s what we need.\u201d</p><p>He held me in his gaze, the tension arcing between us. I opened my mouth, but he spoke before I could.</p> <p>\u201cThe choice is yours, Erica.\u201d</p><p>The simple words. The finality in his voice when he said them. The expectation in his eyes as he waited for me to... to what? To submit? To give everything to him? Every last tiny little piece of myself that was ever worth hanging on to, he expected me to deliver along with my love and trust and future.</p><p>I wanted to crack. I wanted to cry, because I knew I couldn\u2019t give him the answer he needed. Could I? I couldn\u2019t imagine it.</p><p>As I went to war with myself, he closed the distance between us. He kissed me, a quick soft press of his lips to mine. The sweet gesture scattered my thoughts again as he looked deep into my eyes.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Erica. But if you can\u2019t give this to me...\u201d He didn\u2019t finish, only shaking his head, eyes a tornado of emotion that seemed to reflect.</p><p>But... what was he saying? This was it? Before I could question him, he reached for the door and I moved to let him pass. Head down, his hands stuffed back into his pockets, he disappeared down the hallway toward the noise of the party.</p><p>I stood there, paralyzed by what had happened. For all my wanting to talk, I was in disbelief that this is what had been brewing inside Blake all this time.</p><p>All the emotions I\u2019d pushed down to go on about my life the past couple days had crept up to the surface tonight, and I\u2019d passed the point of being able to be here with his family and pretend everything was fine. One look at Blake, knowing our relationship was now very much on the line, would have me in tears.</p> <p>Even if sorry was enough, I couldn\u2019t say it any more than I had, and my heart couldn\u2019t take any more of this. I couldn\u2019t take another minute of knowing that everything I\u2019d given him still wasn\u2019t enough.</p><p>Without giving Blake\u2019s mother any indication of how our talk had gone, I slipped through the kitchen past her and into the living room. The friendly chatter quieted when I entered. Ignoring the others, for fear I\u2019d break down if I made eye contact with anyone, especially Blake, I found Alli. She was standing by the couch, drink in hand. I grabbed my purse and gave her a quick hug.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I whispered and found my way out.</p><p>CHAPTER TEN</p><p>The apartment was dark and quiet. Too quiet.</p><p>I\u2019d returned home alone and tried in vain to sleep. Inside I was battling with the enormity of what Blake had said, what he\u2019d asked of me\u2014the proposal after the proposal. Except this one hadn\u2019t come with a glittering band of diamonds, but the very real threat of having nothing at all. I wanted to believe he was bluffing, that I could talk him out of this way of thinking. But what if he wasn\u2019t? What if nothing I could say would sway this position he\u2019d put me in?</p><p>I\u2019d texted Alli just before midnight, wondering if he\u2019d stayed the night there. No, he\u2019d left. She didn\u2019t know where. Sleep finally took me in the early hours of the morning.</p><p>The morning was muggier than usual after an evening of light showers. I stepped outside and found Clay waiting outside with the Escalade, ready to take me to work. Even when he didn\u2019t drive me on other days, he was always nearby. Evidently Blake wasn\u2019t going to take any more chances with my safety \u0327 and I didn\u2019t suppose there was much I could say to change his mind on the matter.</p><p>I relished the cool dry air of the SUV and let him guide us through the city streets. My mind drifted to Blake and where he was spending his nights. Before my imagination began to run wild again, I looked to Clay.</p><p>\u201cDo you know where Blake was last night?\u201d</p><p>His gaze lifted meeting me in the rearview mirror. \u201cI couldn\u2019t say for sure, Miss Hathaway. He asked me to stay available for you this week. I haven\u2019t heard from him since then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes someone else stay with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, ma\u2019am. Just you.\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t worried about himself it would seem, but I was. The streets sped by until we slowed in front of the office. I said goodbye to Clay and walked briskly toward the entrance to the building.</p><p>My body desperately needed more coffee to get me through the day, but I\u2019d decided to skip my usual morning routine of stopping at Mocha. I\u2019d been avoiding Simone. I didn\u2019t know how much James had shared with her about Blake confronting him. I was already emotionally maxed out with what had transpired between Blake and me the previous night. If I had to face one more emotionally draining situation, I was going to snap. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cErica.\u201d</p><p>Pausing at the door leading up the office stairwell, I spun to find a familiar face. Dressed professionally in gray slacks and a light V-neck shirt, Isaac Perry stood before me. Fucking great.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>I could barely mask my annoyance. Of all the days to show up uninvited, he had to pick today. He had the decency to look a little uneasy.</p> <p>\u201cI emailed you. I didn\u2019t hear back from you, so I thought I\u2019d swing by since I was in town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could have called and given me a heads up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, sorry. Was a bit of a last minute decision.\u201d</p><p>He worked his jaw a bit. He didn\u2019t look like the man who\u2019d groped me months ago. He looked like the man with a boyish smile who\u2019d talked me into a private dinner that started it all.</p><p>\u201cI know you have things to do. I won\u2019t take much of your time,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cIf Blake knows you came here...\u201d I was thankful for once that I didn\u2019t have to worry about Blake stopping in on me today. At least I didn\u2019t think he would. After last night, I figured we were destined for some more time apart.</p><p>He winced slightly, looking down to his expensive loafers. \u201cI know. I realize he\u2019s not my biggest fan. I was hoping you\u2019d take mercy on me and give me a chance to explain though.\u201d</p><p>I took a step away from the door, folding my arms around my chest. We were in public, but the last time I\u2019d seen him, he\u2019d had his unwelcome hands all over me. I couldn\u2019t and wouldn\u2019t trust him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure there is anything we really need to discuss, Isaac.\u201d</p><p>He exhaled, looking more human and less tentative than he had before. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Erica. I really am. Please, let me buy you a coffee. It\u2019s all I\u2019m asking for. Five minutes.\u201d</p><p>His soft blue eyes pleaded with me, and I remembered the Isaac Perry who\u2019d been charming. Also, he was promising coffee.</p> <p>\u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>His eyes lit up, but I was less than excited. I cringed inwardly as I pushed through the doors of Mocha with him behind me, hoping for a miracle that Simone wouldn\u2019t be working this morning. That would have been asking a lot since I\u2019d not once graced the establishment without the vivacious red haired barista greeting me.</p><p>She was helping another customer as we settled into our seats. I sat back, tracing the edge of the table. Isaac was going to press me about the advertising, and I still hadn\u2019t decided what to do. Blake would be furious, of course, but maybe I\u2019d be an idiot for turning down an account like Isaac\u2019s if it meant moving the business forward quicker. With so many emotions tainting the situation, I wasn\u2019t any closer to deciding how to approach his offer.</p><p>Lost momentarily in thought, I almost jumped when Simone greeted us.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d she said with a soft smile. \u201cHaven\u2019t seen you in a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Simone. Um, yeah. Sorry,\u201d I said. Worlds collided, and I couldn\u2019t get into it with her right now. I should probably just tell her what happened with James and be done with it.</p><p>\u201cThe usual?\u201d she asked, jarring my thoughts back to the present.</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p> <p>Her gaze slid to Isaac, who seemed to be casually appreciating her figure the way most men did.</p><p>\u201cMake it two,\u201d he said with a polite smile.</p><p>I sighed, all too ready for my next shot of caffeine. \u201cSo...what did you want to talk about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted to explain\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is there to explain, Isaac? Really. I\u2019m not a fan of men groping me, or touching me in any way without my explicit permission.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI took things too far, I realize that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWay too far. And it\u2019s a little hard for me to look past that and jump into wanting to do business with you. Hopefully you can understand that.\u201d</p><p>His lips went tight. \u201cI do. I made a mistake. My behavior was beyond reproach.\u201d</p><p>The simple confession settled over me, and just as I considered forgiving him, he spoke again.</p><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have been drinking.\u201d</p><p>I frowned, unwilling to accept his excuse. \u201cAre you kidding? We shared a bottle of wine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was on meds. Meds that severely impair my judgment when mixed with alcohol. You couldn\u2019t have known that, and it\u2019s not an excuse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, it\u2019s not.\u201d</p><p>He stared at the table.</p><p>\u201cI want you to understand that\u2019s not who I am. I\u2019d be lying if I said I wasn\u2019t attracted to you, but if I\u2019d been in my right mind, I wouldn\u2019t have approached you that way.\u201d</p><p>I studied him carefully, wondering where all this was going. His need to seek my forgiveness seemed sudden, and I couldn\u2019t help but be suspicious.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want from me, Isaac?\u201d</p><p>He sighed and straightened. \u201cIt\u2019s a small world. We have several mutual connections. I know Blake\u2019s written me off, but it\u2019s likely that our paths will cross again at some point. Despite all this,\u201d he said, gesturing between us, \u201cI was hoping we could work together still. Call it a peace offering.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA binding financial arrangement is an odd kind of peace offering.\u201d</p><p>He barely suppressed a smile. \u201cPerhaps, but I figured you\u2019d see more value in that than flowers and chocolates.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m engaged. You\u2019d be wasting your money.\u201d</p><p>His eyes stilled, narrowing slightly. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize that. Congratulations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I said dryly.</p><p>\u201cIn any case, I do genuinely want to work with you. Before the alcohol got the best of me, I was intrigued with what you proposed. I\u2019d love to give it a try if you think we can get past my epic fuck up.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. If he only knew what I\u2019d been through. \u201cI don\u2019t know...\u201d</p><p>He sat back in his seat and lowered his head.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I understand, Erica. No hard feelings. I just thought it was worth a try. For what it\u2019s worth, I am exceedingly sorry. I\u2019m appalled at my behavior. The more I thought about it, the more I knew I had to see you and apologize. I hope if we see each other again, and I expect we will, we can at least be cordial.\u201d</p><p>I sighed, wishing I didn\u2019t feel sorry for him. I tried to read his body language for signs that he was bullshitting me, but he was as disarming as he\u2019d been the day we met.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll think about it, okay?\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cThat\u2019s all I\u2019m asking for.\u201d He rose quickly. \u201cListen, thanks for meeting. I didn\u2019t mean to take you off guard, but some things are better said face to face.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI can appreciate that.\u201d It would have been much easier to rebuff his attempt at a truce via email. Despite Blake\u2019s fervent hatred for the man, I now found myself considering this bridge between our companies.</p><p>Simone swung by with our coffee, already conveniently steaming from to-go cups. He handed her a bill and thanked her before turning to leave.</p><p>\u201cWho was that?\u201d Simone asked.</p><p>\u201cA prospective advertiser.\u201d Was he? Was I seriously considering this truce bridge between our companies? I wasn\u2019t totally convinced that his intentions were all bad, though I wasn\u2019t exactly inclined to forgive him either.</p> <p>\u201cLooks like a good prospect. He tipped me like forty bucks.\u201d</p><p>I managed a laugh. She sidled up to the seat that he\u2019d occupied. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Are you avoiding me?\u201d</p><p>I took a sip of my coffee, too tired to paint on a face that wasn\u2019t mine. Her eyes narrowed.</p><p>\u201cSimone, at the risk of pissing you off and creating tension between you and James, I need to tell you something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJames kissed you. I know.\u201d</p> <p>My eyes went wide. \u201cYou know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, he told me the other day. Said Blake went nutso on him, telling him to give his notice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d I muttered, as much in reflection of that afternoon as to the fact that she knew about it.</p><p>\u201cListen, you need to figure this out with James. This is kind of what I was worried about with the love triangle stuff, but...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cErica, I care about James. I mean, we\u2019ve been hanging out for a while, and I know he cares about you. He assures me that he\u2019s over any romantic hang up he had with you, but he still very much considers you a friend. I don\u2019t know if he and Blake can get past this, but you\u2019re in the driver\u2019s seat here. It\u2019s your call.\u201d</p> <p>I groaned. \u201cI hate this. All of it. Blake has me in an awful position right now. I don\u2019t want to fire James, and I\u2019m furious with Blake for confronting him. He did not have my blessing to do that. He\u2019s obviously very jealous and can\u2019t stand the idea of me working every day with someone who made a pass at me.\u201d</p><p>She upturned her red lips.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll talk to James. And for what it\u2019s worth, I\u2019m sorry all this is affecting you. I think you and James are great together. I really do. I consider you both my friends, and the last thing I want to do is come between you over this. Unfortunately, Blake\u2019s jealousy is a persistent reminder of an indiscretion that I\u2019m sure both James and I would rather forget. I know we both want to move on, and I hope we can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not an easy situation. This doesn\u2019t affect our friendship though, no matter what. I\u2019m still your girl. Bitches first, okay?\u201d</p><p>I laughed, and she held out her hand for a fist pump. I met it, and she slid off her seat.</p><p>\u201cGo fix your crazy life, and I\u2019m going to serve up some more rocket fuel to the addicts here, all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like a plan. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>She smirked before sauntering off. I grabbed my coffee and left the caf\u00e9 feeling just a little bit lighter. At least that was one fire I didn\u2019t need to put out.</p> <p>At the office, I spent the morning catching up on emails before Alli popped in to brief me on advertising progress. She\u2019d picked up two more accounts, which was a strong start in making up for the lost revenue we\u2019d incurred. I was tallying some quick figures when she interrupted me.</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s going on with you and Blake?\u201d</p><p>I looked up to her worried eyes. I sighed and dropped my pen. I\u2019d need to spill at some point. After running out on her party, she was bound to wonder what had gone down between Blake and me to make me leave.</p><p>\u201cNothing to worry about. Bumps in the road, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to worry about you. Especially when Blake is at my place late, holed up with Heath having some sort of brotherly heart-to-heart til midnight.\u201d</p><p>I fidgeted in my seat. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize he\u2019d stayed that long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t come home?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head.</p><p>\u201cWhere do you think he went?\u201d</p><p>I clicked my pen nervously. \u201cI honestly have no idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened between you two? You\u2019ve been acting strange since you got back from San Francisco. I thought things went well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey did, on the business front. But we ran into Risa there. Listen, I can\u2019t talk about this here. Do you want to grab a drink tonight after work? I can try to explain it all...somehow.\u201d</p><p>I suppressed a groan. That conversation was going to be all kinds of fucked up.</p><p>\u201cOkay. I\u2019m going to step out to pick up some lunch. Do you want anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, just get me whatever you\u2019re having.\u201d</p><p>She left me alone then, and a minute later James took her place in the chair behind my desk.</p><p>\u201cYou have a minute?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>I shuffled some papers around on my desk, for no reason at all other than to delay whatever he was going to say. But Simone was right. We needed to talk. We needed to get to the bottom of this. I let my forehead fall into my hands. We hadn\u2019t even said anything and I was losing my shit. I took in a deep breath. \u201cWe should talk.\u201d</p><p>He leaned back into his chair, eying me. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to fire me, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I sulked back into the chair. No amount of coffee was going to make this conversation bearable. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry about all of this. Honestly, I don\u2019t know where this all went wrong, but I\u2019m desperate to fix it. I\u2019m just lost about how to do it in a way that everyone can live with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLandon\u2019s the only one with his panties in a twist about it. The rest of us are being adults. I don\u2019t see why you need to cater to his temper tantrums unless he\u2019s financially threatening you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe would never do that. And...I don\u2019t know, James. I put him in a difficult situation that\u2019s kind of impossible for me to explain to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething to do with this Daniel guy, I\u2019m guessing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s more complicated than you can possibly understand. Not because you\u2019re not capable of understanding it... but some things are better kept private. And yes. Daniel had a big part in me and Blake not being together. Everything kind of became more and more fucked up after that until we found our way back together again. When he realized what happened between you and me...\u201d I sighed, closing my eyes. \u201cI guess you could say it was the last straw, and now I\u2019m sort of grappling with how to make things right between us.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He hesitated a moment. \u201cI care about you, Erica. I care about this job too, but if you\u2019re going to stay with Blake and as a result, my being here is making your life unnecessarily difficult, I should go. I don\u2019t like this tension any more than you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t want you to go. You\u2019re important to the company, and to me. Despite everything that\u2019s happened, you\u2019re still a friend. And I\u2019m not going to fire a friend.\u201d</p><p>He chewed his lip, tapping his thumb on the edge of the chair looking lost in thought. \u201cWould it help if I wasn\u2019t here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean? I just told you\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI mean, in the office. Would it be easier if I wasn\u2019t here in the office every day? I could work from home. I mean, it\u2019s a technicality, but if it means keeping my job and staying with the company, it\u2019s something worth considering.\u201d</p><p>I did just that. \u201cYou\u2019d be willing to do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. And if eventually you want someone else in house, I can transition out. Maybe go out on my own. Freelance or whatever.\u201d</p><p>I wrinkled my nose, not liking that part of the proposal. \u201cI hate this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do too, but it\u2019s not your fault. I\u2019m not sure what Blake is making you believe, but I should have backed off as soon as I knew you were coming out of a relationship. You needed a friend, and I failed you in that regard.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t fail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI jumped to conclusions. About a lot of things. This is my doing too, and if I have to make sacrifices for it, so be it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI appreciate the offer. But let\u2019s not make any hasty decisions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s hasty, honestly. It\u2019s more like a long time in the making. I can see you\u2019re stressed. You haven\u2019t been yourself all week, and I hate to see you this way. I don\u2019t want to be the cause of that. I never have been and I never will. But if we can make this change, at least for now, and that gives you some relief or room to fix things with him, we should do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m hoping he\u2019ll cool down a little. Maybe I can try to reason with him.\u201d That was a big maybe.</p><p>He leaned forward, resting his forearms on his knees. \u201cYou want to marry Blake, right?\u201d</p> <p>I paused. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPersonally, I can\u2019t stand the guy, but obviously he\u2019s important to you. Important enough that you said yes when he proposed. I don\u2019t want to be the person who fucks that up for you. We made a mess with this workplace relationship thing, and now we both need to clean it up.\u201d</p><p>I offered a slight nod, wishing there wasn\u2019t so much truth in what he was saying. \u201cMaybe you\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not what either of us wants, but maybe it\u2019s the right thing.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER ELEVEN</p><p>The rest of the day sped by. Maybe not all hope was lost in the landscape of my life. New accounts were coming in, I was at peace with Simone, and at least for now, James and I had a plan on how to move forward. I couldn\u2019t deny that the thought of him leaving the company broke my heart a little though. He\u2019d become part of the team, as well as a friend. I would miss seeing him every day, and I couldn\u2019t help but resent that Blake was putting me in a position to make him go. As I dwelled on that thought, Alli popped in to remind me of our after-dinner date.</p><p>I pulled my things together to leave. A few minutes later, Clay dropped us at a trendy sushi spot on a busy street. Alli and I ordered Mai Tais. I sucked the sweet drink down and politely asked the waitress for another when she delivered our assorted rolls. Today was simply one of those days. If nothing else, maybe the alcohol would put me to sleep when I went home to our empty bed again.</p><p>\u201cSo James is going to be working from home for a while.\u201d I finally blurted it out, knowing that Alli\u2019s tense silence was filled with her unspoken questions about what the hell was going on.</p> <p>Alli frowned. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>I took a deep breath. \u201cWhen Blake and I weren\u2019t together, James and I started to hang out more, as friends. I tried to keep things professional, but he started to want more. Eventually he made a pass at me, and...\u201d</p><p>Alli\u2019s dropped her jaw dropped. \u201cYou didn\u2019t...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe kissed. It was brief, and I wanted it to end about three seconds after it started. Apparently Risa saw the whole thing, and this weekend at the awards event, she told Blake about it. I\u2019m guessing she wanted to get back at me and mess with our relationship. Unfortunately, it worked. Blake was beside himself. We fought. He wanted James gone...or else.\u201d</p><p>I shoved a piece of sushi in my mouth, hating that he\u2019d won. That I\u2019d given him what he wanted.</p><p>Alli stared, unmoving with wide eyes. \u201cI wasn\u2019t expecting all of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell that\u2019s why I never told you. It was a mistake, and I wanted it to go away, but it hasn\u2019t, so now I\u2019m paying for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo is everything okay between you now that James isn\u2019t going to be in the office?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no idea. We haven\u2019t really talked.\u201d</p><p>I mangled one of my rolls as I thought about the awful distance that had come between us in the past few days. As angry as I was with Blake, I hated every minute when we fought. Nothing was right when we weren\u2019t together, and I could only hope all that would change now.</p><p>\u201cAny way, how are things going with Heath? Give me some hope. Things seem to be perfect with you two right now.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged and placed a slice of ginger on one of her rolls. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say perfect.\u201d</p><p>I lifted an eyebrow. \u201cTrouble in paradise?\u201d</p><p>She laughed, but her smile quickly faded. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I worry about him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s understandable, but has he given you a reason to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the thing. Not really. But I can\u2019t help but worry. He finished the program, and ever since it\u2019s like I haven\u2019t been able to shake this feeling that he\u2019s going to slip up again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he has you. He has Blake and work and his family. It seems like he\u2019s on the right track. Everything is going so well, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. On the surface everything is great. The apartment, our jobs. But it seems like whenever I check in with him, he tells me I\u2019m hovering. He reminds me that Blake hovers and his family hovers. Understandably so, but he says he doesn\u2019t need one more person studying his every move. I just care about him too damn much to lose what we have.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I contemplated what she was telling me for a moment. I hadn\u2019t known the Heath that used as well as I knew the new, sober Heath, but I\u2019d seen enough to recognize how different he\u2019d been. I believed that his relationship with Alli and being deprived of it when he went back to rehab was what sobered him on an entirely different level. Blake believed it too, which is what prompted him to bring him back home early and unexpectedly.</p><p>\u201cIt sounds like you\u2019re waiting for him to fail, Alli,\u201d I finally said.</p><p>Her shoulders slumped and sadness flickered behind her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m scared. I don\u2019t want to go through what we went through again. I was a mess. I mean, you saw me. I need Heath\u2014like I\u2019m wildly in love with him and I can\u2019t imagine being without him. But for this to work, I need him to stay healthy. I\u2019ll do anything I can to make sure that happens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember you were a mess, but he was too. I think you both need each other, but maybe what he needs more than anything is for you to have faith in him. We all know how Blake is, and parents are parents. He wants you to love him and believe in him, not mother him.\u201d</p> <p>She sighed. \u201cIt\u2019s hard, because when we were in New York, we spent every spare minute together. We only had to work around my schedule then, but now that he\u2019s working with Blake, we have even less time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust because you aren\u2019t spending every waking minute together doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s in peril. Working with Blake and taking those responsibilities more seriously is good for him. Even if it\u2019s time that he can\u2019t spend with you.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cYou\u2019re right. I just wish we didn\u2019t have to live with this invisible demon threatening to come between us. Every day is an opportunity for things to go wrong.\u201d</p><p>I caught her hand and gave it a squeeze. \u201cAlli.\u201d</p><p>She lifted her gaze to mine.</p> <p>\u201cStop waiting for something bad to happen. The best thing you can do is love him, show him you care, and make the most out of every minute you have. Stop trying to control what you can\u2019t control.\u201d</p><p>I hurried under the awning of the building as the rain started to come down harder. Scanning the street, I saw no sign of Blake\u2019s Tesla. My heart sank, and the prospect of spending another night without him gnawed at me. Earlier I\u2019d considered calling to tell him about my conversation with James, but something\u2014maybe pride\u2014held me back. He\u2019d find out...but I wasn\u2019t entirely ready to let him know he\u2019d won this round yet.</p><p>As I climbed the stairs, I met Cady just outside the door of the apartment Sid and I once shared.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d She beamed, keys in hand.</p><p>\u201cHave you seen Blake?\u201d I asked, my enthusiasm obviously far dimmer than hers.</p><p>\u201cHe was at the office when I left. Why?\u201d</p> <p>I hesitated, debating whether to tell her more. \u201cHe didn\u2019t come home last night, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Concern painted her features. \u201cI think he probably stayed at work last night then. He looked tired, and...well, he hasn\u2019t exactly been in a chipper mood today. That might explain why.\u201d</p><p>I sighed, relief washing over me. Still, knowing he was staying at work wasn\u2019t bringing him any closer to home. I thanked her and climbed the stairs to our apartment. I dropped my things on the island and went to our bedroom. The bed was a mess, the sheets an unmade mess, for all the wrong reasons. I hadn\u2019t slept much, and likely, neither had he.</p><p>I took a quick shower and emerged. The apartment was as silent as it had been when I\u2019d arrived. Securing the towel around my chest, I went to the dresser where I kept my clothes. My jewelry rested in a shallow box on top of it. I slipped my ring back on, and the diamonds of the matching bracelets caught my eye. I picked them up. The weight of the bracelets rested heavily in my palm. The expensive bands sparkled in the dim light of the bedroom. They were beautiful, but their meaning meant more. I fingered the small medallions. The platinum roulette wheel clinked against its mate, the heart...Blake\u2019s heart.</p><p>Looking up, I caught my reflection in the mirror. All I could see now were my tired eyes filled with the kind of sadness that only being away from Blake could bring. Fighting this fight with him seemed fruitless and damaging, when my answer would always be yes. When the only future I could envision was one with him.</p><p>I wanted him back, at any cost, even my pride. To think I could stand my ground against someone like him\u2014a man who saw what he wanted and stopped at nothing to have it\u2014was delusional at best. But damn, he pushed me. Trusting him with my body and my heart wasn\u2019t enough, yet somehow I\u2019d always known that would be true. A part of me knew that one day our relationship would come to this, that he\u2019d push me for all I could give. He\u2019d been controlling and maddening from day one. I\u2019d been a fool to expect any of that to change.</p><p>But he was right. I\u2019d fought like hell to maintain that line between our worlds. I\u2019d let him in, bit by bit, but always held him a safe distance from certain aspects of my life. Because I\u2019d given him more than I\u2019d ever given anyone else, I wanted to think that was enough. But it wasn\u2019t. That much was clear now.</p><p>I didn\u2019t want to fight, and I didn\u2019t want our relationship to be a battlefield. Perhaps that was why he wasn\u2019t giving me any other options now. We both were hurting and unhappy as a result of my fuck up, and now, because he was making me pay for it, or change for it.</p> <p>I clasped the bracelets around my wrist, admiring them. Always I\u2019d worn them with pride. I wanted the world to know I wore them for him, even if no one knew what they meant to us. Our promise. Like the one on my finger.</p><p>Blake could own me, he could hold something deep in me, but I\u2019d captured something precious in him too. Something he\u2019d never given anyone else.</p><p>I glanced back to the bed, the sharp ache of missing him too painful to ignore.</p><p>The downpour of rain had me nearly soaked by the time I stepped through the doors of the Landon Group offices. A sliver of light cast across the floor where Blake\u2019s door was ajar. I knocked quietly before entering, hoping not to greet him with a heart attack.</p><p>Inside he was sitting lazily at his desk, feet propped up, his focus on the televisions across the room before shifting to me.</p><p>\u201cWorking hard?\u201d I walked around his desk and propped myself on the edge.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d Blake asked.</p><p>\u201cI should ask you that. How long are you going to camp out here and pout?\u201d</p>  </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His jaw shifted, and he lifted a tumbler of scotch to his lips. His throat worked on a swallow. \u201cI\u2019m not pouting.\u201d He set the glass down, his eyes traveling the length of me, all the way down to my strappy black heels. \u201cYou\u2019re wet.\u201d</p><p>I raised my eyebrows and looked out the windows of his office. They were covered with blinds, blocking him from the view of the world outside.</p><p>\u201cIf you ever left your cave, you might notice that it\u2019s raining buckets out there.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cYou walked?\u201d</p> <p>I rolled my eyes. \u201cNo, Clay drove me. Relax.\u201d I glanced over his desk and lit on a stack of documents with a familiar logo.</p><p>\u201cWhat are these?\u201d I asked, picking them up.</p><p>He sighed, seeming annoyed. \u201cFinancials for Sophia\u2019s modeling agency.\u201d He pulled them from my grasp and tossed them to the other side of the desk beyond my reach.</p><p>I narrowed my eyes at him. \u201cHas she been in town?\u201d</p><p>He took another drink. \u201cWhy, do you think she hand delivered them?\u201d</p> <p>I stared at him, unwilling to let it drop.</p><p>\u201cNo, Sophia has not been in town, at least that I know of. You can put your claws back.\u201d</p><p>Relieved, I shot him a grin. \u201cCan\u2019t blame me for asking, can you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuppose not,\u201d he mumbled.</p><p>I took a deep breath and decided to dive in. As much as I wanted to tease him to resolution, we\u2019d probably only get there by talking seriously. Even though the last time hadn\u2019t gone so well.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve thought a lot about what you said last night.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd,\u201d he said dryly.</p><p>\u201cI understand that you\u2019re upset, and I understand why. I have held back, especially with the business. It\u2019s been my safe place in a way. The part of my life I can go to, no matter what happens between us, and know that it\u2019s mine. That every success and every failure is mine. It\u2019s everything I\u2019ve worked for, and it scares me to share it with you. It always has. But I\u2019m willing to change and involve you more.\u201d</p><p>His gaze held me steadily. \u201cWhy would you do that, after all this time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, for starters, if we\u2019re getting married...\u201d I lingered on that thought a moment, trying not to derail with the possibility that we wouldn\u2019t, that he wouldn\u2019t want that anymore. \u201cI suppose what\u2019s yours is mine in that regard. If I can\u2019t trust my husband-to-be with it, who can I trust?\u201d</p><p>He set down his glass. He folded his hands on his lap, seeming to study me. \u201cOkay,\u201d he said simply. \u201cSo James is leaving, I take it?\u201d</p><p>I searched his eyes for any sign that he might relent on that point. \u201cHas it occurred to you that you\u2019re being a little unreasonable when it comes to me keeping James with the company?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I\u2019m being unreasonable, it\u2019s in response to unreasonable behavior, and in that case, I\u2019ll call it purely justified. I told you where I stand on this issue. Nothing\u2019s changed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if I said that starting today, you can have all the control in the business you want, except for that one tiny piece.\u201d I illustrated the tiny piece with my thumb and forefinger, as if that might help.</p> <p>\u201cYou should go, Erica. No point in both of us sleeping here tonight.\u201d He lowered his feet to the floor and swiveled to face the computer screens.</p><p>Christ was he stubborn. I could almost see his heels digging in.</p><p>God love him, Blake fought dirty. He was putting the survival of our relationship on the line to get what he wanted\u2014what he said he needed. I wouldn\u2019t be reasoning with him tonight. Not unless I fought dirty too.</p><p>\u201cSuit yourself,\u201d I said and slid off the desk. Slowly, I fingered the top button of my raincoat. One by one, I released them. Blake\u2019s attention turned back to me. His gaze fixed on the front as the jacket parted, giving him a sliver of vision into what I was wearing underneath. It wasn\u2019t much.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to ply me with sex.\u201d</p><p>I canted my head. \u201cNo?\u201d I challenged, secretly knowing I\u2019d already given in to his demands.</p><p>I smiled and shrugged out of the jacket I\u2019d traveled here in. Tossing it away, I stood near naked in just enough black lace to cover the bare necessities. Trails of water from my rain-soaked hair trickled down my body over my already damp skin. I had been worried about the weather hampering my look, but based on the way Blake\u2019s lips parted, the effect might have worked in my favor.</p><p>\u201cI think I might be able to change your mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t. I\u2019m sick of this shit, Erica.\u201d</p><p>If I\u2019d been blindfolded, I might have believed him, that he couldn\u2019t be swayed. But his eyes gave him away, leveled at my chest as I reached for the clasp at the front of my bra.</p><p>\u201cI seem to recall you have a weakness for lace,\u201d I teased.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re my only weakness,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>The words hit my heart. The playful smile I wore faded. I wanted to be his weakness, but not if he resented it, the way it sounded like he did now. Turning, I walked slowly away. My boldness had taken a hit, and now I only felt embarrassed and hurt. I wanted him to want me, to meet me not even close to the middle, but to consider this one concession.</p><p>\u201cWhere the hell are you going?\u201d</p><p>I lifted my lips again at that small sign of hope. I slowed in front of the couch on the other side of the office and unclasped my bra. I let it slip over my shoulders and down my arms, depriving him of the view of my naked chest. Hooking my thumbs over the barely there panties, I pulled them down, leaving me completely naked, save my jewelry.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t win this way, you know.\u201d</p><p>I spun, and he was there in front of me instantly, eyes blazing.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not trying to win anymore.\u201d All teasing was lost from my voice with that concession.</p><p>\u201cThen what are you doing?\u201d</p><p>I ran my hands up his chest. \u201cI\u2019m letting you win.\u201d</p><p>He winced. \u201cYou\u2019re playing games. I\u2019m not interested in games.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not playing. I\u2019m giving you what you want. I\u2019m giving you all of me.\u201d I reached up and curled my arms around his neck. My breasts brushed against his clothed chest. I could feel his heart beating quickly, matching the wild rhythm of my own.</p><p>\u201cThis doesn\u2019t work. Being apart destroys us. I can\u2019t live without you, Blake. I can barely survive a night without you. How am I supposed to risk losing you for a lifetime? If you won\u2019t give me this one thing, then I have no choice in the matter, do I? So I\u2019m letting you win. I\u2019m trusting you with everything I have, body, soul, and business. Take what you want, be wherever you need to be.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I met his eyes, wanting him to believe every word.</p><p>\u201cAnd James.\u201d</p><p>I drew in a breath, resigning myself to the choice I had to make. \u201cHe\u2019s leaving. It\u2019s done.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER TWELVE</p><p>He regarded me silently. I held myself to him, but he hadn\u2019t touched me in any other way. Still holding back. Yet the way his muscles coiled tight under his skin, I couldn\u2019t help but feel that could change at any moment. I\u2019d become the hunted, and this chase would turn on its head in an instant. The anticipation had my heart racing.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what you want, isn\u2019t it?\u201d My voice caught when he licked his lips.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not all I want.\u201d</p><p>Lust filled his eyes, mixing with the quiet determination I\u2019d seen grow in him over the past several days. Heat bloomed across my skin under his traveling gaze.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m giving you everything,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to believe it, but you\u2019ve done nothing but fight me. How do I know anything has changed?\u201d</p><p>How could I show him?</p><p>Love wasn\u2019t enough. Words, meaning every one I uttered, weren\u2019t enough. I was here, naked and vulnerable, chest-to-chest with the man who was demanding I give him every piece of myself. I lowered back onto my heels and let my hands fall down. How much was enough? I\u2019d finally acquiesced to his demands, and now I was scrambling with how I could prove it to him.</p><p>I twisted my fingers nervously between us. My fingertip traced the small band of diamonds above my knuckle. A thought struck me. Nerves tightened my stomach and adrenaline pulsed through me. I closed my eyes.</p><p>Fuck. I was about to give him everything. And I was petrified.</p><p>I exhaled a shaky breath, hoping the release would loosen the knot in my throat. Opening my eyes, I braced myself for what I had to do. I looked up into Blake\u2019s eyes, a tornado of want and worry.</p><p>\u201cBlake, I love you so much. And I trust you. I really do.\u201d I kept my voice steady, not wanting to give him any reason to doubt me. \u201cSo please understand this for what it is...everything...everything that I have. Please don\u2019t make me regret it.\u201d</p><p>I closed my eyes a second and dropped slowly to my knees. The only sound in the room was metal against metal, the clink of the bracelets as I positioned my hands on my thighs.</p><p>I waited for him. To believe me, to come to me and be the one to bring us back together.</p><p>A minute that felt like forever passed. No movement, no words. Only the echo of what I\u2019d done and the anticipation of where it would take us. Slowly he lowered in front of me. I kept my focus on the floor and then the dark fabric of his jeans stretching over his knees. He tipped my chin to meet his eyes. His lips were parted, his breath rushing out in soft pants that met my own ragged breathing.</p><p>He drew a line across my quivering lips. \u201cThis is what I want, if it\u2019s what you want,\u201d he finally said.</p><p>My heart hammered in my chest, a loud reminder of how much he meant to me. \u201cI want you. I can\u2019t promise I\u2019ll be perfect, but I\u2019ll try to be what you want, everything you need.\u201d</p><p>He slid his palm over my cheek and into my hair, urging me up. I lifted to my knees and steadied myself with my palms against his chest. The hard muscles rippled under my hands. He held me that way, our lips a breath apart, his eyes scorching with emotion.</p><p>His breath whispered over my lips. \u201cAll I\u2019ve ever wanted, since the day we met, was your trust. I want to be there for you, to help you, protect you. I can\u2019t do any of that the way I need to when you fight me and push me back.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI won\u2019t anymore, I promise.\u201d</p><p>His eyes softened. He wrapped an arm around my waist, pulling me closer to him. \u201cAnd I promise that I will never let you regret that choice.\u201d</p><p>A warm feeling expanded in my chest, dispelling the nerves and the doubt. My love for this man shot through me, sending a tremble down every limb. Lust and desire lit up on its path, and I had to have him now. His name on my lips, I kissed him feverishly, as if I\u2019d never have another chance. Hands in his hair, I clung to him, wanting our bodies as close as they could be. He answered the silent wish, bringing both hands to my ass. A quick thrust of his hips showed me how badly he wanted me too.</p><p>I gasped for air, breathless from the kiss and the electricity in the air. \u201cTake me now. Take what\u2019s yours, Blake.\u201d</p><p>He lifted me quickly to the couch so I lay on my back. As we kissed, an all consuming kiss, he caught my wrists and held them above me. I arched my back off the couch, restless and eager to feel him against me again. He loosened his hold and I went to reach for him, only to find my wrists bound in the bracelets. They were the most expensive handcuffs I\u2019d ever wear, and their beauty kept me captive in a way nothing else ever had.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve given me what I want, Erica. Now I\u2019m going to give you everything you want. You\u2019ll lack for nothing tonight, baby.\u201d</p><p>My fingers itched to touch him, to rake through his hair, down his back. I groaned, the now hopeless desire to move and take hold of him shooting through me. \u201cThen fuck me and don\u2019t make me wait anymore.\u201d</p><p>He moved down my body, kissing a wet path down my torso. A lick into my navel, a soft graze of his teeth over my hipbone.</p><p>\u201cBlake,\u201d I whimpered.</p><p>\u201cI will, baby. Trust me, I will. I want a little taste of you first.\u201d</p><p>He pushed one of my legs to the floor. Grabbing the other at the knee, he held it firmly against the back of the couch, exposing me to him completely. I lay there, full of need and on display for the man who never failed to reduce me to a shameless harlot with a few well-timed words.</p><p>Warm snaked through me. My heart thundered, sexual anticipation now rushing in over my love for him. I clenched my fists, remembering my bonds. The cool metal tight at my skin where I strained reminded me who owned this moment. I closed my eyes and sighed, going limp into the soft give of the couch.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a good girl. Lay back and I\u2019m going to make you see stars,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>He brushed his lips down my thigh. Every time his tongue slipped out and made contact with my skin, my eyes rolled back. My fingers curled tightly over the armrest of the couch, steadfast where he\u2019d placed them earlier. Heat flowed through me like molten lava. I swore I\u2019d never been so damn needy and yet so patient and trusting that he\u2019d sate those needs.</p><p>Warm, sure hands slid from my knees to the center of my body where Blake spread me farther with his fingers. When his mouth made contact with the sensitive flesh between my legs, I began to tremble. His grip on my thighs stiffened, ready to keep me still. The soft press of the intimate kiss gave way to his tongue, drawing a full velvet lick up my clit. I cried out and my patience took a serious hit as he continued to massage the taut bundle of nerves, sucking and licking, moaning curses against it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou taste like heaven.\u201d The words blew air onto my throbbing sex, cool under the warm bliss of his mouth. Christ, his mouth. His tongue traveled the same path, up and down, sucking and devouring. Nothing was teasing about how he ate me. I was perilously close to coming now, rocking into his motions wantonly.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to come with me inside you, baby? You want something to crush down on when I push you over?\u201d He slid a single finger inside me, just enough to remind me what I was missing.</p><p>I nodded quickly, my voice effectively replaced by the breathing I could no longer control. I wanted that. I wanted every intensely erotic moment his beautiful mind could think up. Without another word, he stood. He tugged off his shirt and unfastened his belt.</p><p>The sound it made slipping through the loops sent a fiery tingle over my skin. I bit my lip and arched slightly. The corner of his mouth lifted in a smirk as he undid his jeans and pushed them down his thighs with his boxers, revealing his hard, gorgeous, and very ready cock.</p> <p>\u201cAdmit it.\u201d</p><p>I shifted my focus to his face, as breathtaking as every other part of him. I frowned.</p><p>\u201cAdmit that you like the belt.\u201d</p><p>My teeth dug into my lower lip a little harder. The pain, the sweet edge of desire.</p><p>\u201cI know you do.\u201d He laughed. \u201cYour pussy gets impossibly wet every time. You don\u2019t really have to admit it, because I already know. Your body gives you away. But I\u2019d love to hear the words come out of your mouth.\u201d</p> <p>The memory of the leather smarting my skin elicited a physical response beyond anything I could comprehend. For all the fears I\u2019d faced, through little fault of my own, I did like the things we\u2019d done. I couldn\u2019t think of a single thing I hadn\u2019t liked, or hadn\u2019t fucking loved for that matter. I wanted to be pushed. I wanted that edge. Maybe that was twisted, and maybe nothing about it made sense to the rest of the world, but he was right. I liked it, and it was useless to deny it. My lips twisted into a small smile. \u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>He stood above me, grinning devilishly. \u201cI think I caught myself a little deviant. A smart and beautiful little deviant. I knew you were perfect for me, and you keep proving me right.\u201d</p><p>I widened my smile. \u201cI like your hand better though. I like when you can feel the sting too, and when you stop to grab me and touch me there.\u201d</p><p>He groaned and palmed his erection, pumping the rigid length. \u201cI wasn\u2019t planning on spanking you tonight, but you\u2019re making me want to bend you over my desk right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat could be arranged.\u201d I gazed at him through hooded eyes. I was getting ready to beg for it when he lowered between my legs. When he came over me, the silk contact of our warm bodies sliding over each other was almost too much. I sucked in a breath, and he caught the lower lip I had trapped earlier. Sucking it into his mouth, he traced his tongue over the swollen flesh.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to punish you, baby. I want to reward you. I want to spend hours making you come for me. Again\u201d\u2014he lowered his lips to my neck\u2014\u201cand again\u201d\u2014sucking a path down to my shoulder\u2014\u201cand again, until you beg me to stop.\u201d</p> <p>I clenched, all too aware of how close to the edge he\u2019d already taken me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m begging you right now...to start. Let me come, Blake, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will. How do you want it? Slow?\u201d</p><p>I arched into his mouth as he lowered to my breast. Circling the taut point with his tongue, he sucked and pulled.</p><p>He gazed up at me. I shook my head.</p><p>\u201cFast?\u201d Turning his attention to the other, he lavished the same treatment until I thought I\u2019d lose my mind.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I breathed.</p><p>\u201cRough?\u201d</p> <p>He caught the tip between his teeth and his fingers found my wet heat again. He slipped two fingers in, twisting slowly. He bit down gently on my nipple, and I shuddered and clenched.</p><p>\u201cOh, fuck,\u201d I gasped.</p><p>He released and moved up my body again. \u201cYour body tells me everything I need to know, baby. Now I\u2019m going to give you everything you want.\u201d</p><p>When the hot crown of his head pressed into me, I thought I might die from the sweet overwhelming relief of it. He pushed in easily, and my breath left me with a groan. I was losing my grip on reality far too quickly. Rooted there, he churned his hips. The possessive motion did little for my sanity. Then he kissed me everywhere, my face, my shoulders, my neck.</p><p>\u201cBlake, please, let me touch you. I need to.\u201d</p><p>His body deeply seated in mine, I recognized the vulnerability in his eyes when he nodded. I brought my hands down, the muscles in my shoulders aching from the posture. He unclasped the bracelets, freeing me quickly. The second he did, I shoved a hand through his hair and pulled him down to my mouth for a heated kiss.</p><p>As if that one gesture were a green light to fuck me out of my mind, he caught my hip and drove into me. Deep, powerful thrusts that pushed me up the couch until his other hand pressed again the armrest. The leverage allowed him to fuck me even harder, claim me ever deeper.</p><p>\u201cThis what you want, beautiful?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I whimpered. \u201cGod, yes.\u201d I raked my nails down his sides, wanting to mark him. I gripped his hips between my thighs, hastening his movements over me. I needed to feel him, us together, everything disappearing in the blissful way it could this way.</p><p>\u201cI never thought I could love anyone the way I love you... Erica...God, you have no idea what you do to me.\u201d</p><p>I trembled, the depth of his penetration sending waves of pleasure like electricity through my body. I was lost in the sensation. I gripped his hair by the roots, my sex crushing down around him. Everything crashed down. Every wall, all my pride. Nothing mattered except this...</p><p>Without warning he rose up on his knees. He caught my ankles, placed them on his shoulders. With his next thrust, I went into orbit. He was so deep.</p><p>He slipped his hand between us and teased tight circles over my clit. Colors flew behind my eyes. I started to slip. The orgasm so close I could taste it. I could feel it down to my fingertips and all the way to my toes.</p><p>\u201cBlake.\u201d His name flew out of my mouth like a plea.</p><p>\u201cTell me what you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHard!\u201d I screamed, the climax already ripping through me. My back bowed off the couch completely, my muscles spasming beyond my control.</p><p>With a fierce growl, he dug into the flesh of my hips. With both hands, he shoved me down onto his cock and fucked me harder than I had ever been fucked in my life. His cock lengthened inside me, hitting my core in the delicious way that it always did seconds before he came. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He cursed, pulsing into me. Eyes to the sky, he caught his breath. He looked as destroyed as I felt. Slipping out of me, he fell back onto the couch. Hands on his head, he blew out a slow unsteady breath.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>He turned his head to look at me, confusion mingling with the utter wreckage on his face. \u201cWhy what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy on earth would you deprive us of that?\u201d</p><p>He laughed, and I smiled too, too wasted for anything else but levity. Then his smile faded. He brought his hand to my knee, and stroked my leg gently. Several empty minutes passed.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t leave me again, Blake,\u201d I said softly.</p><p>Our eyes locked. \u201cI didn\u2019t leave you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou left our bed, and I didn\u2019t know where you were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to stay away. I never want to be away from you. You\u2019re all I think about. You\u2019re the only person I ever want to be with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why did you leave?\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cIf I came home, I was going to fuck you senseless.\u201d</p><p>I laughed again, despite the seriousness I was trying to convey. \u201cWhen did that become a crime?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot nearly a crime, but as amazing as this is\u2014and believe me, it was amazing\u2014fucking you wasn\u2019t going to get me what I wanted. If anything, it would only complicate matters and confuse the issue. We both know sex isn\u2019t the issue here. But I was hoping you\u2019d come around, sooner rather than later. I was prepared to jerk off until you gave in to my demands, but I can\u2019t say I was looking forward to it.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head in disbelief. \u201cAnd now that I have?\u201d</p><p>He slid his hand down farther, catching mine and threading our fingers together. \u201cNow I want to take you home and show you how grateful I am until the sun comes up.\u201d</p><p>I dressed for work and joined Blake in the kitchen. Seeing him there pouring coffee made me realize even more how terrible the brief distance had been. I wanted Blake in my life, every morning, every night, and every minute we could steal in between. Married life, I figured, would cater to that pretty well. A little flutter of excitement went through me at that sentiment.</p><p>I navigated around the island for my coffee, and he snagged me close for a kiss. I melted into it. His lips lingered and his tongue teased. Memories from last night whirled through my mind. Every touch, every toe-curling moment. Now I wished we had time for more. Still, the weekend was close, and we could spend at least some of it in bed. I wanted Blake by my side, but I also wanted to catch up on some much needed sleep. I hadn\u2019t really slept since the trip to San Francisco, and the fatigue was catching up with me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m exhausted.\u201d I slipped out of his embrace and lifted myself onto a seat at the island with my coffee.</p><p>\u201cMakes two of us. Why don\u2019t you stay home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome of us have to work, dear.\u201d</p><p>A comfortable silence fell as we drank our coffee.</p><p>\u201cWhen does James leave?\u201d</p><p>I tightened my jaw, lingering bitterness at James leaving seeping in. \u201cI wanted to talk to you about that, actually.\u201d</p> <p>He set his cup down with a thud. His eyebrows went up with a challenge.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not what you think,\u201d I reassured him.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsking James to leave wasn\u2019t something I wanted to do, but I did it for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor us,\u201d he said.</p><p>I exhaled heavily. \u201cWhatever. It\u2019s difficult for me to not draw parallels to your situation with Sophia, though.\u201d</p><p>He leveled an expressionless stare at me before turning to refill his cup. \u201cShe lives in New York.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve also slept with her. You have a history with her. You had a sexual and romantic relationship. Even if I didn\u2019t despise her personally, it would bother me that you still see her...sporadically or not.\u201d</p><p>He turned and leaned against the counter. The pose was casual, but I could sense the tension rippling below his clothes. I resented what this woman\u2019s name brought into the room. I also resented his clothes. These conversations seemed to go better when we were both naked.</p><p>\u201cThe only reason I ever see her is on business. I\u2019ve told you this. Why do you keep pressing the issue?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m human, and like you, I\u2019m jealous of anyone who wants what\u2019s mine. You\u2019re mine, and neither of us can deny that she wants you. You can claim you\u2019re just friends all day long, but I could say the same about James and me, and the words would fall on deaf ears.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want me to do about it?\u201d</p><p>I traced the rim of my cup, suddenly scared to the death that I was dancing on the edge of disaster with Blake again and so soon after we\u2019d come to terms.</p><p>\u201cHow long have you been invested in her business?\u201d</p><p>He knitted his brows. \u201cFour years.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s a long time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you getting at, Erica? Spit it out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like it if you would consider removing yourself from her business. I\u2019m not saying I want her business to suffer, but I can\u2019t help but feel like keeping that connection with you is like a lifeline for her. Like she\u2019ll always have a chance to try to get you back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe has zero chance of getting me back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you tell her we were getting married?\u201d</p><p>His jaw tensed. He pushed off the counter and dumped the remains of his coffee cup into the sink. \u201cYou\u2019re a pain in the ass, Erica. Do you realize that?\u201d</p><p>I laughed, relieved to have a little comic relief. \u201cDo what you want, Blake. I\u2019m just letting you know how I feel. You want me to be honest with you, so I am. I made a sacrifice for the health of our relationship, and those sacrifices are more easily made when there isn\u2019t a double standard.\u201d</p><p>He circled the island and stood in front of me. Staring down, his eyes glimmered with humor. Something had changed in him, and already I loved it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take it into consideration.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I murmured, arching up to kiss his lips.</p><p>\u201cDoes that make you happy?\u201d</p><p>I smiled. \u201cYou make me happy, so yes. The less of you I have to share, the better.\u201d</p><p>He hummed and lowered again to kiss me, tracing his tongue over my lip. \u201cHow about we make you happy one more time before work.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER THIRTEEN</p><p>I worked busily through my work all morning. For the most part, everything was on track. Blake and I were good, James and I had an understanding, and I was ready to move on with my life. After lunch Daniel texted me, reminding me of the meeting we\u2019d scheduled for the afternoon. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I cursed myself for forgetting. Stepping outside, I caught a cab to Daniel\u2019s campaign headquarters. As much as I didn\u2019t need a second job, meeting Daniel\u2019s assistant campaign manager\u2019s frazzled energy made me sorry for him. Without delay, he led me through the hustle and bustle of the headquarters office that always put me on edge.</p><p>\u201cGreat to see you again, Erica.\u201d Will shut the door behind us. Running a hand over his dark blond and generally untamed hair, he settled down behind his desk.</p><p>I sat across from him and pulled out my notebook. \u201cYou too. How has everything been going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, as I\u2019m sure you know, we\u2019re in the midst of the debates.\u201d He threw his hands up.</p> <p>I twisted my lips up. \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t. Is that good?\u201d</p><p>He raised his eyebrows. He still thought this was an important job for me, not a situation that Daniel had coerced me into, which would explain my total lack of knowledge about the campaign as it currently stood. If I wanted information, I knew how to seek it, but nothing about the Massachusetts governor\u2019s race appealed to me, even with my biological father as a prominent candidate.</p><p>\u201cSo far, yes, it\u2019s good. Mr. Fitzgerald is winning most of them. We have a strong position in the race, and with only a month of campaigning left to do, we want this last push to be what solidifies the win.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d I was still uncertain how I felt about Daniel winning or losing. He was my father, and even though he was a murdering sociopath, part of me wanted to root for him. I shook the strange thought from my head and pressed Will to fill me in more. I hadn\u2019t been in the loop for weeks. Thank goodness, Daniel had given me some space, but I had a feeling that wouldn\u2019t last much longer.</p><p>Will spent the next hour bringing me up to speed. We strategized and bounced ideas around. Somehow I was able to draw some parallels between my own venture and Daniel\u2019s marketing goals, and by the time I left, I\u2019d armed Will with some new initiatives to carry through until our next meeting in a week.</p> <p>The constant hum of the area beyond Will\u2019s small office seemed to grow in volume. Sensing a change, I shifted my focus from Will. Through the glass windows of the office, a few people gathered near the entrance where Daniel now stood. He looked imposing as ever in an impeccable suit, but his stance was casual. His lips moved silently. Then his blue eyes met mine and his smile seemed to broaden a bit. A few seconds later, he joined us in Will\u2019s office.</p><p>I stood awkwardly. Should I shake his hand?</p><p>\u201cWill, one of the interns out there had some questions about some press releases that were going out today. Quotes and what not. Can you take care of it? Give me a moment to speak with Erica.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. Take your time.\u201d Will stood quickly, gathering up his phone and papers.</p><p>As unsettling as Daniel\u2019s presence could sometimes be, I relaxed when Will\u2019s brand of stress left the room. Daniel sat back, legs crossed, drumming his fingers on his knee.</p><p>\u201cHow are you doing?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s Blake?\u201d</p><p>I shot a concerned look his way. He laughed quietly. His mood seemed light, but out of habit, I approached any direct communication with him, especially on the topic of Blake, with caution. Maybe I was still a little shell shocked from some of our other less civilized meetings.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just asking. Last time we spoke you said you were engaged. Any news on that front?\u201d</p><p>I inhaled a breath, relief tempering the worry that he still harbored a serious grudge toward my fianc\u00e9.</p><p>\u201cUm, no. Not really. How\u2019s Margo?\u201d I asked, hoping to change the subject.</p><p>Daniel shifted his gaze from me.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s coming to terms. The election has been a saving grace for her, given her something to focus her energies on, thank God.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s good, I suppose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe actually asked about you the other day.\u201d</p><p>I hadn\u2019t seen Margo in weeks, since before Mark\u2019s death. No part of me wanted to face the woman who\u2019d mothered my rapist knowing that our unfortunate connection was what had ultimately led to his death. I couldn\u2019t see the sorrow in her eyes and share it. And I couldn\u2019t pretend I didn\u2019t know my father was the reason she was now childless.</p><p>\u201cDoes she know I\u2019m working with you on the campaign?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cShe knows. You and Will worked out the details?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I think we came up with a good plan for your next steps. If things continue to go well outside of the online outreach, it seems our efforts could put you over the edge. I mean, I haven\u2019t done this before in terms of politics, but it\u2019s promising, I\u2019d say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent. That\u2019s what I want to hear. I\u2019m glad we could figure this out, one way or the other.\u201d</p><p>I doodled into my notebook. He was glad now, but he\u2019d put me through hell to get me here when he could have simply asked nicely. Without the murder and violence and death threats that I hoped were all now safely in the past.</p><p>\u201cErica.\u201d</p><p>I lifted my chin at his more demanding tone.</p><p>\u201cWould it help if I said I was sorry? For everything that happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here now. Isn\u2019t that enough? Do I have to be happy about it too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d feel a little better if you were. If we win, there will be plenty to be happy about.\u201d</p><p>I tried to imagine that for a moment. I wasn\u2019t sure my vision of victory lined up with his. \u201cDo you really believe that winning this election will bring you happiness?\u201d</p><p>A deep frown marked his brow, and he stood. \u201cI have a full day. Need to go over some things with Will before I go, but it was good to see you.\u201d</p><p>I collected my bag quickly, stuffing my notebook into it as I rose. \u201cI\u2019ll see you later then.\u201d</p><p>I stepped past him, reaching for the door. He placed a hand at my elbow and I jerked away. My heart sped up at the memory of the last time he\u2019d touched me, shaking me with rage.</p><p>I looked over my shoulder. Our eyes locked.</p><p>\u201cEven if it means nothing to you, if you aren\u2019t necessarily happy to be here, I want you to know that I\u2019m glad that you\u2019re a part of this.\u201d</p><p>I gave a short nod and moved forward.</p><p>I waved Will a goodbye and left as quickly as I could. As I did, I caught Daniel\u2019s figure watching my departure, his expression stoic.</p><p>I stepped into the apartment to the savory smell of dinner, quiet jazz playing in the surround sound. Blake was in the kitchen, a look of concentration on his face as he put the finishing touches on two plates. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat is all this?\u201d I tossed my bag down and leaned against the island to watch him.</p><p>\u201cIf I did everything right, it should look and taste like beef wellington. Julia Child would be proud, I think.\u201d</p><p>I smirked, enamored by the gesture and a little proud too. Not surprisingly, Blake was amazing at anything he put his mind to.</p><p>\u201cIf I knew getting on my knees was going to result in home cooked meals every night, I would have done it sooner. You know food is the way to my heart.\u201d</p> <p>He grinned. \u201cWatch that mouth. I might have to punish it later.\u201d</p><p>I hummed with a giggle. \u201cSounds intriguing. I hope you put it to good use.\u201d</p><p>He flashed me a dark look. \u201cDon\u2019t mistake my culinary prowess for weakness, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t dare. Nothing you do is anything less than perfectly dominant. Just don\u2019t make me call you Master while we eat, okay?\u201d</p><p>I came up behind him and circled his chest with my arms, giving him a hug as he placed tiny springs of herbs on top our plates.</p> <p>\u201cFair enough. Come on, let\u2019s eat,\u201d he said.</p><p>I let go, and we walked to the table. My cheeks heated at the memory of being tied down to the very thing, having come home to a far less amiable Blake.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking about?\u201d</p><p>I widened my eyes as if I\u2019d been caught in the very act. \u201cUm...the table.\u201d</p><p>He laughed and popped a bite of steak into his mouth. \u201cYou\u2019re trying to rush us through a gourmet meal so I can tie you up, baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I like to unwind a bit before you start practicing your rope work. What has you so chipper anyway?\u201d</p> <p>He leaned back in his chair. \u201cMax is out.\u201d</p><p>My eyebrows shot up. \u201cOut of Angelcom? That\u2019s amazing. How did you do it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately, my chat with Michael was pretty fruitless. He said exactly what I thought he\u2019d say. Always wants us to work it out between us, not get involved. So I worked it out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you do it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was talking to Heath about pulling our investment from Sophia\u2019s business. He\u2019s invested too, you know. I\u2019m not sure it can be done without\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, what does this have to do with Max?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBasically, I looked into every investment I shared with the dissenting board members and figured out the absolute worst move I could make on each of them. A few short conversations later, I had consent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow. You fight dirty.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis surprises you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I admitted.</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI could have hacked their bank accounts and bled them dry. I was being nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you tell Max?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, the undercurrent of contentment still glittering in his eyes. I hated Max, sure. But I loved seeing Blake finally happy after what he\u2019d put him through.</p><p>\u201cI had one of the admins send him a copy of our minutes with our sincerest apologies. He\u2019ll get the message.\u201d</p><p>I chewed in silence for a moment, trying to imagine Max\u2019s reaction to the news. I wondered if he cared as much about getting kicked out as Blake did about getting him out. If nothing else, Angelcom was a major channel into Blake\u2019s affairs that gave Max opportunities to hurt him again in the future. Without access to that, Blake was safer. We were safer.</p><p>\u201cYou must be relieved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am. And I\u2019m hopeful too, because while we were voting on board positions, I had them add someone new.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe future Mrs. Blake Landon, of course.\u201d</p><p>I stared at him in shock and searched for words.</p><p>\u201cI think some of the trust issues that we have maybe root from the fact that I\u2019ve been involved with your work, and you have virtually no involvement in mine. I\u2019m happy that you came to me, Erica. I can\u2019t tell you what a relief it\u2019s already been. But I don\u2019t want you to think that you have no power in our relationship, that you have no say. And I don\u2019t want to discourage your growth as an entrepreneur. It\u2019s that spirit that attracted me to you after all, so the last thing I want to do it dampen that flame in you. I\u2019ve thought about it, and I think a position on the board would be the perfect place for you to participate with your experience as a startup.\u201d</p><p>I set down my fork and swallowed over the tightness in my throat. The words and the gesture were almost too much for me to process right away. Everything that I was so scared of having taken away from me felt that much safer in Blake\u2019s hands. In his control. Maybe all I had to do was give up a little control to have it come back to me in a different way.</p><p>\u201cThank you. I\u2019m flattered that you would even consider it. But are you sure? I mean, I already feel like I\u2019m in over my head at any of these industry events. I can\u2019t imagine sitting on the board and holding my own. Involving me at that level is a huge decision.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeciding to marry you was a huge decision. Adding you to the board was easy. You\u2019ll have these guys won over in no time. You\u2019re smart and beautiful, sassy as hell. They won\u2019t know what to do with you, the same way I don\u2019t half the time. I can\u2019t wait to sit back and watch, frankly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t they all investors, though? I\u2019m not an investor. What place do I have?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re my wife, or you will be. And this is what I do. I find new projects to invest in. When I decide to drop one or five million into a new project, you\u2019ll be a part of that decision process now.\u201d</p><p>I toyed with my napkin on my lap. \u201cI have no wish to ruin this amazing night, but maybe this is a good time to talk about that. I mean, I\u2019m assuming you want a pre-nup, right?\u201d</p><p>We hadn\u2019t talked about ownership of assets, or any of those things since he\u2019d asked me to be his wife. I wasn\u2019t sure I\u2019d ever be able to shake the inequity between us when it came to money. As much as he reassured me that it meant nothing, I wanted to earn my way, make my own contribution to our lives.</p><p>The warmth in his eyes faded a little, a seriousness coming over him. \u201cMake no mistake, what\u2019s yours is mine. I don\u2019t need a legal document to make me feel any safer in our marriage. If you decide to divorce me and rake me over the coals, I\u2019m not sure any amount of money would ease the pain of losing you. It\u2019s a non-issue for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat seems rash. You\u2019ve spent half your life amassing your wealth, and you want to risk it all now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you a risk? Usually when you leave me, you just take my heart. That\u2019s the biggest risk of all, I\u2019d say.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I tossed my napkin onto the table and looked past him, hating the fresh reminder of how I\u2019d hurt him. Before I could slip much further into my pout, he caught my hand and pulled me up and onto his lap.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about the what-ifs of not being together, in any capacity. I love you. I want to marry you. Nothing\u2019s as important as making that happen. That bond, that promise, is the only paperwork I\u2019m interested in having between us.\u201d</p><p>I sighed. I wasn\u2019t going to win this argument. I rested a hand on his chest, feeling the slow rise and fall of his breathing. His heart beat there, feeding the flesh and blood of the man who I loved so much it hurt. \u201cI hope you know I would never\u2014\u201d</p><p>He lifted a finger to my lips. \u201cI trust you, and believe me when I say I\u2019m not worried about it. About Angelcom, is it something you want to do? I mean, I wanted to vote you in while I had them all by the balls, but if you really don\u2019t want to do it, you don\u2019t have to.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI think it would be fun. And I agree it would be nice to have some more insight into everything you do. It\u2019s scary of course, but it would be a good experience for me. You\u2019ve taught me so much already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He threaded his hand through my hair and pulled me down for a kiss. My mind reeled a bit as I reveled in the softness of his lips. His firm but loving hold around me, anchoring me against him. Amidst the sweet moment between us, I stumbled over all this...progress. That part of me that had wanted to hold back and protect myself for so long now seemed very small, almost childish. Giving Blake my trust, all of it, had already changed things between us more than I could imagine. In a very good way.</p><p>This shift reminded me of something less positive. I pulled back, searching his eyes.</p><p>He reached up and brushed a strand of hair back from my face. \u201cEverything okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something I wanted to talk to you about.\u201d</p> <p>I went to move, but he held me there.</p><p>\u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>I hesitated a moment. \u201cIsaac came to the office yesterday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he.\u201d</p><p>The displeasure that left his lips was less of a question and more of a threat. I toyed with the fabric of his shirt. I wasn\u2019t so sure I liked talking about people he despised in such close proximity.</p><p>\u201cHe reached out to me a couple weeks ago. I ignored him at first, not knowing how I wanted to handle dealing with him in light of what he did.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t mention it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t, but I am now.\u201d I looked into his eyes, trying to convey that this too was progress, even if it was packaged in news that he didn\u2019t like. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to upset you, and I wanted to think through it a little on my own also. He wants to advertise with us. It wouldn\u2019t be a small account either. It would span all the publications relevant to our market, which would be an enormous coup for us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t bring him on as an advertiser.\u201d His voice was flat, without a shred of doubt.</p><p>\u201cI had a feeling you\u2019d say that, and I understand your reasons. Obviously I share them. For what it\u2019s worth, he seemed genuinely sorry. Outside of that incident, he seems fairly harmless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnyone with that much money and power is far from harmless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen with all your money and power, what makes you any different?\u201d</p><p>He lifted his eyebrows. \u201cDo I come across as harmless to you? Because I\u2019m in love with you doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019d hesitate dismantling someone who threatened you, me, or either of our businesses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue enough. It would help us bridge the revenue gap while we roll out these changes with Alex, but I suppose it\u2019s not a risk worth taking.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019d pay for it later, I can guarantee it. Everything comes with a price.\u201d</p><p>I studied him a moment. \u201cWhat\u2019s between you two?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs if trying to force himself onto you isn\u2019t enough of a reason to hate the man?\u201d</p><p>I slanted my head, a silent call for his honesty. \u201cI know there\u2019s more. You knew him before we met, and you didn\u2019t like him much then.\u201d</p><p>He sighed and released his hold on me. He patted my ass in a way that said, Shoo.</p><p>I frowned. \u201cNo. You can tell me right here while I\u2019m on your lap.\u201d</p><p>His expression didn\u2019t change for a moment, and I worried he might not agree. Finally he blew out a breath and began to speak.</p><p>\u201cAs long as I knew Sophia, Isaac had been in her circle of friends. She modeled for his shoots and they\u2019d known each other for a while. When I ended things with her, he came to her rescue. He played the hero, and oh, did he play the part. I\u2019m certain he only wanted to fuck her, and who knows, maybe he did. When we broke up, he made a point to demonize me to her and others. I didn\u2019t really care what everyone else thought. I cared more that she felt like I abandoned her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you didn\u2019t abandon her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you before, she didn\u2019t take it well. She was clean when we broke up, and she couldn\u2019t understand. It took a lot of willpower for me to not go back to her if only to see her stop hurting. But it wasn\u2019t just the drugs. In reality it was the last straw. The distance when she was in rehab just polarized how different we were. How it would have never worked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you love her?\u201d</p><p>He drew his lips drew together. \u201cI don\u2019t know. We said it, but I can\u2019t tell you if what I felt then was love. I wanted to take care of her, and she thrived on being taken care of. It worked for a while, but I can\u2019t say that was love. It wasn\u2019t anything close to what we have, Erica.\u201d</p><p>I chewed my lip, trying like hell to ignore the jealousy that coursed through me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve thought about what you said, about exiting from her agency. Financially, it could be damaging for her if I did. I own more stake in it than anyone. I invested heavily when she started to help get her off the ground. Beyond that, Heath is also invested. I\u2019m not sure what his thoughts are on the matter, but he seems hesitant. Their relationship is different. They have more of a friendship, a connection that she and I didn\u2019t. Maybe because they went through a difficult time in their lives together and have come out of it. I don\u2019t know, but a part of me doesn\u2019t want to push Heath on it if I don\u2019t have to.\u201d</p><p>I looked past him, trying to hide my disappointment. Making James work from home wasn\u2019t exactly convenient for me either. I tightened my lips into a firm line as resentment set in. Blake slid his palm over my cheek and turned me slightly, regaining my attention. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI understand why it bothers you, so I\u2019m going to see what I can do. Maybe it can be done more gradually so it doesn\u2019t impact her business so dramatically.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou baby her still.\u201d</p><p>He tensed slightly. \u201cMaybe. Old habits die hard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not as helpless as she seems. If you\u2019d seen how she spoke to me...she can be truly vicious. If she uses that personality in her business life, she\u2019ll do fine.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJealousy can turn people into very ugly versions of themselves.\u201d</p><p>My thoughts swirled around the sentiment. I\u2019d been forced to expel James from our office to satisfy Blake\u2019s own jealousy. I pushed off of him abruptly, despite his effort to keep me there.</p><p>By the time I reached the kitchen with every intention of cleaning until I wasn\u2019t so pissed anymore, he was behind me. He spun me and pushed me back to the counter.</p><p>\u201cStop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop what?\u201d I snapped.</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you want me to do? Destroy her business?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re smart, Blake. I think you can figure it out. Put her on a payment plan. Make her take out a loan. Maybe she can start selling what I imagine is a sizeable designer shoe collection. But I don\u2019t want her claws in you, at all, in any way.\u201d</p><p>He rolled his eyes. \u201cHer claws are not in me. Yours are. Like, right this fucking minute.\u201d</p><p>I gave him a hard stare. I didn\u2019t care what he said. His assurances were a waste of air if whenever I crossed paths with Sophia, the look on her face told a different story. Until he\u2019d severed their connection, she\u2019d always dangle it in front of me.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re mine, and the next time I see her face, I want her to know it. Call me jealous, and if that makes me ugly, then so be it.\u201d</p><p>He pushed my hair back behind my ear. \u201cI like that you\u2019re protective. It doesn\u2019t make you ugly.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen end it with her. Please.\u201d I softened in his arms, wishing he\u2019d just do the right thing.</p><p>A long moment passed between. My resentment melted into a pile of disappointment.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>I lifted my gaze, but before I could say anything, his lips were on me, silencing me, giving me everything I wanted.</p><p>CHAPTER FOURTEEN</p><p>Marie stood behind me, curling small sections of my hair. Alli had a concentrated look on her face as she brushed some color onto my cheeks.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re fussing too much, Alli. This is an engagement party, not the big day. I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>She stood back, head cocked to the side. \u201cYou are now. You look perfect. Also, you should get used to it. Getting married is like prom on steroids.\u201d</p> <p>My lips lifted with a smile. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m afraid of. You keep saying things like that, I\u2019m going to take Blake up on his offer to elope.\u201d</p><p>Fiona looked up from her seat, another bridal magazine in her lap. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I relented. \u201cYou\u2019re the only friends I have, and if I deprived you of this wedding, I\u2019m sure neither of you would ever speak to me again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNonsense.\u201d Alli fluffed a spiral of hair that Marie had just released. \u201cWe should go dress shopping soon though. I think that\u2019s the key to getting you into wedding mode.\u201d</p><p>I sighed. \u201cYou could be right. Maybe I should start looking at those magazines for ideas. I don\u2019t even know where to start.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, don\u2019t look too hard, because Alli and I have picked just about everything out for you already,\u201d Fiona chimed in, her eyes glittering with humor.</p><p>I laughed. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSatin and strapless.\u201d Fiona opened it to a page, showing me a photo of a beautiful model bride.</p><p>\u201cHmm, pretty. What about lace?\u201d</p><p>Alli widened her eyes a bit. \u201cIs that what you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, maybe. I think Blake likes lace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMust run in the family,\u201d Alli quipped, her eyes alight.</p><p>I laughed, trying to keep myself still so Marie wouldn\u2019t inadvertently catch me with the hot iron.</p><p>Fiona did little to mask her look of disgust. \u201cOh my God, this conversation has to end. Please. You\u2019ll give me nightmares.\u201d</p><p>Alli and I laughed, sharing a look.</p><p>The door opened then, and Heath poked his head in. \u201cMom wanted me to tell you guys that people are starting to show up, so come out whenever you\u2019re ready. Don\u2019t make them wait too long to meet our guest of honor.\u201d He winked.</p><p>\u201cGo away, Heath. You\u2019re going to make her nervous,\u201d Fiona said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. I have my liquid charisma right here.\u201d I lifted my nearly empty champagne flute.</p><p>Marie loosened the last curl. \u201cYou don\u2019t need liquid charisma. Everyone will love you.\u201d</p><p>I warmed at her words. Of all the people here, Marie was my only family, though the more I thought of it, the more that line between Blake\u2019s family and mine began to blur. Alli lived in both worlds right along with me, and I was far from an outsider in the Landons\u2019 lives. They were a warm and welcoming family that I was belonging to a little more each day. The absence of my own relatives mattered less, and the times when I mourned not having a more normal family were fewer.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be out soon. As soon as we\u2019re beautiful.\u201d Alli ran her fingers through her already perfectly straight hair.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re already beautiful, gorgeous.\u201d Heath smirked, his eyes fixed on Alli.</p><p>She blushed, pretending to ignore him.</p><p>\u201cGross, get out.\u201d Fiona tossed a throw pillow at the door, missing her target as she closed the door shut, his laughter audible from the other side.</p><p>Marie curled the last piece of my hair. \u201cYou\u2019re all set, baby girl.\u201d</p><p>I stood, taking in my appearance once more. I wasn\u2019t as concerned about how I looked as I was about holding my own in front of all of the Landons\u2019 friends and family. This was going to be family overload, but I was as ready as I ever would be.</p><p>Alli hooked her arm through mine and gave me a little nudge. \u201cLet\u2019s go charm the hell out of the Landon family tree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ready. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>Blake met us as we left the spare room where the girls and I had stationed ourselves to get ready. He looked delectable in dark jeans and a pin-striped collared shirt rolled up at the sleeves and loose at the waist. He\u2019d look good in a burlap sack, a toga, basically anything. While everyone else meandered farther into the house, I stayed back to steal a moment with him.</p><p>\u201cYou look stunning. I can\u2019t wait to show you off,\u201d he said, his eyes darkening. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou like it?\u201d I glanced down at the cream-colored strapless dress I wore. Covered lace at the top met sheer layers of the skirt that fell just below my knees.</p><p>\u201cLove it. Very bridal. But of course, I love you more.\u201d</p><p>He caught me up to his body and leaned down for a kiss, gentle and filled with devotion. That awareness, the ever-present arc of energy, crackled between us. His lips brushed against mine almost reverently. I closed my eyes and sank into the embrace. He traced the seam of my lips with his tongue. I sighed and opened to him, welcoming the sweet taste of him.</p><p>His tongue lashed deeper, seeking and nibbling. I moaned softly, pressing myself up to my toes. He pulled away slightly, shaking his head.</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s go before I decide to steal you away from here and make love to you instead.\u201d</p><p>I wouldn\u2019t argue one bit, if I hadn\u2019t known his parents were expecting us and had already put so much time into planning the party.</p><p>\u201cAlli spent at least twenty minutes on my makeup. She\u2019d kill me. Not to mention your parents and everyone else.\u201d</p><p>He paused. \u201cAre you nervous?\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cMaybe a little. I won\u2019t know most of the people.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou will soon. They\u2019re mostly my parents\u2019 friends from when I was growing up. They\u2019ll love you.\u201d He clasped our hands together, lacing our fingers. Chest to chest, we made no effort to move. I could stay this way, hiding away in his arms all day. As if the rest of the world didn\u2019t exist.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Blake. We say it all the time, but sometimes I wish I could show you more. Nothing seems to do the words justice.\u201d</p><p>He lifted my hand and pressed his lips to the band that adorned my ring finger. \u201cYou do show me. Every day, by being with me. And if that\u2019s not enough, you have the rest of our lives to prove it to me.\u201d</p><p>I smiled warmly. \u201cSounds like a good plan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>Blake led me into the large open living area that joined with the Landons\u2019 designer kitchen and an impressive dining area. The combined rooms looked out onto the ocean through a wall of windows. The already expansive room had begun to fill with mingling guests. Before I could think of introducing myself, Catherine ushered over the first group of friends. Recognition lit up Blake\u2019s face, and I steeled myself for the first of what would be many introductions tonight.</p> <p>Hours passed as we went from one group to the next. The members of Blake\u2019s extended family were as sweet and lovable as the immediate. To them, Blake was still a young man, a boy even. I could see it in their eyes and the way they interacted with him so casually. No longer the intimidating, dominating man who fought tooth and nail for what he wanted, Blake joked and even reddened a few times as people shared stories of his youth.</p><p>I repeated the story of how we\u2019d met in the Angelcom boardroom, reliving the moments. The attraction that charged our initial interest in each other had only grown since that time.</p><p>On the outside, Blake was perfection. Beautiful, wildly successful, rich beyond anything I could fathom, and he was charming to boot. So few people knew his heart, though. The darkness that lived there sometimes, and the passion that had deepened our bond. In the picture he painted of his youth, I saw a highly intelligent man searching for answers in our convoluted world. And in that seeking, he\u2019d lost a friend.</p><p>Though he refused to talk about it with any depth, I knew he carried the weight of Cooper\u2019s suicide with him. I\u2019d guessed too that something had altered in him when it happened. A commitment to the control he so needed had been born. A fervent determination to never go through that kind of terrible experience again combined with the opportunity that Pope, his mentor, had given him to succeed with the software venture made control possible for him. He now had more control than any average person could ever hope to have.</p><p>I was lost in my own thoughts for a moment when Blake\u2019s countenance turned stony. I followed the path of his gaze and stopped abruptly. Max stood casually next to the man I recognized from photos online to be his father, Michael. Dressed in khakis and a dark V-neck, Max carried his usual charming smile into the room. The two men were the same height and build, and Michael was no less attractive for being an older man. His skin was darkened by the sun, his hair white with the hint of blond that had faded out with age.</p><p>When Max\u2019s gaze lit on us, he stilled a moment. Michael proceeded toward us. Without a word, he pulled Blake into a casual hug. The small gesture spoke to how their relationship went beyond the professional world. Max pivoted away and merged with another group of people in the party.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s great to see you, Blake. And of course, many congratulations.\u201d</p><p>When Michael pulled back, his eyes smiled. For a magnate, he possessed more warmth than I would have expected.</p> <p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t convinced you\u2019d ever get around to it, but I am very pleasantly surprised.\u201d</p><p>His gaze slid over to me, with no less warmth or appreciation. \u201cYou must be the lovely Erica I\u2019ve heard so much about. Catherine kept me on the phone for nearly an hour last week. I think she wanted to make sure I made the trip, but of course I would have anyway. I\u2019m Michael, by the way.\u201d</p><p>I shook his hand. \u201cI\u2019m so glad you did. It\u2019s wonderful to finally meet you.\u201d</p><p>Blake\u2019s posture had relaxed only slightly. \u201cYou didn\u2019t mention that Max was coming with you.\u201d</p><p>Michael glanced back in the direction of the door where they\u2019d entered. \u201cTo be honest, I didn\u2019t know he would be. I let him know I\u2019d be in town, and he already knew about the party, so I assumed your mother extended an invitation.\u201d</p><p>Michael\u2019s expression cooled slightly while Blake\u2019s nostrils flared.</p><p>\u201cMichael, Erica, if you would excuse me a moment, I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d His smile was tight, but the tone of his voice betrayed the anger that now simmered below the surface.</p><p>Michael sighed heavily. \u201cI\u2019ll die a happy man if that rivalry will settle itself one of these days. In the meantime, they\u2019re taking years off my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019re not the only one who\u2019d like to see it end.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWithout a doubt. It\u2019s unfortunate that two people with so much intelligence can devote so much time to trying to outdo each other.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t disagree entirely, yet I knew that of the two, Max was the aggressor. I bit my tongue though. Michael seemed mercifully in the dark about the finer details of Max\u2019s tactics, or perhaps he simply ignored them. A man of his professional stature might not have much choice. He had empires to run while his son and prot\u00e9g\u00e9 had it out over affairs that likely were not worth his time. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Blake and Catherine stepped out of sight. I felt for them both. Max shouldn\u2019t have come, but now that he was here, worry knotted in my gut. He couldn\u2019t be pleased with Blake removing him from the board, and I could only hope that an argument didn\u2019t erupt and ruin the night.</p><p>Michael\u2019s expression was thoughtful. \u201cPerhaps you could be the one to make them see the absurdity of it all, Erica. They know you, respect you. Men can be awfully short-sighted sometimes. Reactionary. I\u2019m sure you know this from experience. Maybe all they need is some guidance from an intelligent, compelling woman to make them see what a waste of time all this is.\u201d</p><p>I felt myself flush. The man barely knew me. Besides, what power did I have over either of them? Max had gone to such great lengths to upset my company\u2019s success. I was the last person who could bring them peace. I\u2019d become a third party, inextricably involved in the whole terrible mess.</p><p>\u201cI appreciate the vote of confidence, but I think stepping between them would be dangerous.\u201d</p> <p>He nodded. \u201cPerhaps. Max is my son, and Blake is very much like a son to me. Neither of them listen worth a damn to anything I say, sadly. You\u2019ve certainly captured Blake\u2019s attention though. Now if only Max would do the same, maybe we\u2019d have some progress. It\u2019s hard to care about much else when you have a beautiful woman in your arms.\u201d</p><p>He smiled, and I warmed despite myself. I wanted to say more and try to enlighten this idealistic albeit sweet man with the truth. But it would do no good. Michael, Max, and Blake were like gods at war with one another, having no perspective on the potential impact of all those involved. Except Max knew exactly what his impact would be on me. The health of my business might have been a passing interest at a time, but it had considerably more importance as soon as Max realized he could hurt Blake through it.</p><p>Still, I hadn\u2019t spoken to either Risa or Max since their site went up. As much as I wanted to tell them exactly what I thought of them, I\u2019d chosen to stay silent.</p><p>\u201cYou look like you could use a drink.\u201d</p><p>I spun to find Max extending a glass of champagne to me. I hesitated, but sensing Michael\u2019s eyes on me, I took it, if only in the momentary spirit of peace. I masked the disgust for the younger man, painting on a tight-lipped smile.</p> <p>Max nodded to his father. \u201cDad, Greg was asking about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas he? I\u2019ll go find him then.\u201d Michael scanned the room and then turned back to me. \u201cErica, it was lovely to meet you finally. We\u2019ll chat again before I go, but if not, perhaps you can convince Blake to come to Dallas for a proper visit. It\u2019s been too long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. I\u2019ll see what I can do.\u201d</p><p>He kissed me on the cheek and winked before leaving me with Max. Being alone with him made me instantly uncomfortable. This was supposed to be a happy day, but I had nothing nice to say to Max. No matter Michael\u2019s optimistic thoughts about everyone getting along, Max had wounded me and attacked my business in a way that was unforgiveable.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d</p><p>He scoffed, feigning offense. \u201cYou\u2019d think you might be happier to see me. I was a few signatures away from giving you two million dollars. Or did Blake\u2019s four mil trump that whole thing?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, but your propensity to shit on everything he does certainly colored that choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas it a choice? Or did he back you into a corner? That\u2019s how he works, you know. He manipulates and positions himself to the point where you can\u2019t make any other decision but the one he wants. Is that the kind of man you want to marry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want Max? Or did you just come here to upset everyone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was hoping I could speak with you, actually.\u201d</p><p>I shrugged, taking a sip of the champagne. \u201cHere I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to discuss business, and I\u2019d rather not do it in front of parents and childhood friends. Could we speak alone?\u201d</p><p>He eyed me steadily. Looking around the room, I couldn\u2019t see Blake, but the thought that he would intervene if he saw us speaking seemed likely.</p><p>\u201cBlake doesn\u2019t want you here. You should really leave. His parents put a lot into this party, and I\u2019d rather not see it ruined because you two can\u2019t get along.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAgreed. I\u2019ll be on my way as soon as I can have a moment of your time.\u201d</p><p>I sighed, my aggravation growing the longer I stayed in this holding pattern with him. As much as I wasn\u2019t in the mood for any kind of powwow with Max, I also didn\u2019t want Blake to cause a scene. I\u2019d let Max say what he needed to say and hopefully get him to leave so the rest of the night could carry on as planned.</p><p>\u201cFine. Five minutes, and then you need to leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFair enough.\u201d</p><p>Reluctantly, I led him from where we stood down a hallway that led to Greg\u2019s den. The room was cool and quiet.</p><p>I walked in and turned at Greg\u2019s large desk, leaning against it.</p><p>The door closed behind Max with a click.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s better isn\u2019t it?\u201d He walked closer, something hidden in his guarded expression.</p><p>\u201cSay what you have to say.\u201d</p><p>He stopped a few feet away, a distance I assured myself was safe. My stomach tensed. An uncomfortable sensation prickled under my skin.</p><p>Lifting his glass, he smirked. \u201cHow about a toast?\u201d</p><p>I rolled my eyes. \u201cWhat would we possibly toast to, Max?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo Blake.\u201d</p><p>I canted my head, waiting for him to continue.</p><p>\u201cFor winning the girl, driving me out of Angelcom, and managing to turn my old man\u2019s eye from his own family for the better part of fifteen years. How\u2019s that for a toast?\u201d</p><p>Resentment laced every word. But when I considered what he\u2019d done to both of us, I couldn\u2019t muster an ounce of sympathy for him. I was glad he was losing his battle with Blake, and I could certainly toast to that.</p><p>\u201cCheers.\u201d I lifted my glass to him and let the champagne slide down, the liquid welcome to my mouth now parched from the hours of introductions and conversations.</p><p>A smile lifted his lips. \u201cSo tell me, how\u2019s business?\u201d</p><p>I laughed. \u201cWouldn\u2019t you like to know? You lost your inside connection. I suppose you\u2019ll have to guess and hope for the best now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sound bitter, Erica. Why? I told you I was interested in the concept. You chose not to let me invest in it. Shouldn\u2019t it show my commitment that I was willing to make it happen with or without you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt speaks volumes to your commitment to chase after Blake\u2019s ventures trying to carve out something that could rival anything he\u2019s created. You had access to privileged information about my company and used it against me. Below the belt, I\u2019d say.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His eyes narrowed slightly. I didn\u2019t care. I wanted him to feel any dig I sent his way.</p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t exchange a non-disclosure. I was well within my rights.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were well within your rights to be a deceitful, unethical bastard. Unfortunately there\u2019s no law against that.\u201d</p><p>He laughed quietly. \u201cThank goodness. Lucky for you, there\u2019s no law for fucking your way to the top either.\u201d</p> <p>I closed my eyes. I set my glass down, suddenly too exhausted to want the relief of a drink.</p><p>\u201cGet out.\u201d My voice lacked the force I\u2019d meant to deliver with the demand.</p><p>When I opened my eyes, he\u2019d come closer, facing me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just saying, if you wanted to fuck someone for your funding, I was right there. You know that\u2019s what everyone thinks, right? You don\u2019t need me to ruin your reputation. You did that all by yourself, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>I winced. \u201cYou\u2019re lying.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAm I? People love to talk. A little bit of industry gossip can spread quickly if started in the right circles. Pretty girl like you, taken under the wing of someone like Landon. He\u2019s got a reputation of his own, you know. You\u2019re the last in a long line, so don\u2019t go feeling special just because he\u2019s going to marry you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know anything about who he really is. He loves me\u2014\u201d I stopped myself, confused by how slow the words were leaving me. How tired my body suddenly felt. I shook my head, but the movement only made me dizzier. I was drunk, suddenly more drunk than I could remember being in a long time. Shit.</p><p>I stared down at my glass, and amidst the rising bubbles, barely visible granules floated near the well of the glass. I looked up, my vision blurring. When Max came into focus, his perfect white teeth gleamed through a deviant smile. He was a demon in disguise, if I\u2019d ever met one.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see if he loves you after tonight.\u201d</p><p>A surge of panic powered my legs to carry me toward the door, but he blocked my passage catching me by the upper arms.</p><p>\u201cGoing so soon? Stay a while.\u201d</p> <p>He shuffled me backwards and shoved me back onto the couch. A new wave of fatigue hit me with the impact. I struggled to hold myself upright. Every muscle sagged, weighted with this new and sudden weakness. I\u2019d underestimated him before, and now again. Confusion swirled through me as I tried to think my way through what was happening. My mind was moving too slow, my attention scattering until he was beside me, catching my jaw painfully so I faced him.</p><p>\u201cBest case scenario, I thought you\u2019d look like a fall down drunk in front of Blake\u2019s family. But this is so much better. Now I\u2019ll get a little taste and maybe...just maybe we can ruin Blake\u2019s happily ever after when he sees you this way. Drunk, just fucked, like the cunt that you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMax, no.\u201d My head felt like a drum barrel, buzzing with a never-ending soundless vibration. I told my limbs to move, but when they did, it was Max pushing me down sideways on the couch.</p><p>Then his mouth was on me, forcing his tongue past my lips. Feebly I pushed at him. He answered the weak effort with a snicker, his breath hot on my face.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, MacLeod said you were a fighter. You get around, don\u2019t you? Does Blake know what a little slut you are?\u201d</p><p>The mention of Mark\u2019s name conjured a memory deep and violent. \u201cPlease, no,\u201d I slurred. The words melted into the space between us, along with my fading consciousness.</p><p>He muffled my weak cries.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll make it quick. I\u2019ve had a hard on for you for months, Erica. Going to show you what it feels like to get fucked by a real man, not some two-bit hacker riding on my family\u2019s success. If we\u2019re lucky, you\u2019ll remember it too.\u201d</p> <p>I grasped desperately for control, to fight the paralysis that slid like cold molasses through my veins, making everything slow. My lungs struggled for air, the effort to breathe taxed amidst the rising panic and whatever invisible enemy my body was fighting.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a good girl.\u201d</p><p>Losing my grip, I was vaguely aware of him pressing me roughly through my panties.</p><p>No, no, no. God, no.</p><p>No one would hear me, but my mind screamed it until my vision went black.</p><p>CHAPTER FIFTEEN</p><p>My eyes fluttered open, and then fell shut. Every time I reached for consciousness, something knocked me back down. I\u2019d never been this tired in my life. Even as my conscious mind began to grasp details from what happened, my body demanded sleep. I gave in yet fought the unsettling urge. Something wasn\u2019t right about it. The weariness weakened my muscles, sank into my tired bones.</p><p>As I drifted in and out of sleep, my stomach twisted, sickness brewing in my gut. The potent nausea and the real threat that I\u2019d be sick right where I lay was what finally propelled me out of bed. On my feet, I shoved the bathroom door open and barely made it to the toilet.</p><p>Several exhausting minutes later, I sat unmoving on the floor. My head rested on my arm as I caught my breath.</p><p>\u201cBaby.\u201d</p><p>Blake\u2019s pained voice came up behind me. Then his arms were cradled around me. He palmed my back, the heat of his touch penetrating the thin nightshirt I wore. The fatigue took root again, weakening me in the security of his arms. I sat back against him and wiped my mouth, determined not to make a bed out of the bathroom floor.</p><p>He kissed my shoulder. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cBetter now.\u201d Thankfully, being ill had quelled the sick feeling for the time being. I wanted to move, to shake this weight that settled over me. \u201cHelp me up? I feel so weak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Just go slow.\u201d</p><p>I nodded again, the task of lifting to my feet impossible at the moment. He circled my shoulders and then my waist until I was upright. He tucked a loose lock of hair behind my ear, and I caught his reflection in the mirror. His normally expressive eyes hid behind the dark rimmed glasses that he rarely wore.</p><p>I let go of the security of his solid body and held myself up at the sink, gathering enough of my strength to wash my face and brush my teeth. He brushed my hair back from my face and neck, allowing the cold sweat to evaporate off my skin.</p><p>\u201cDo you want some tea? Can I get you anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTea would be good, I think.\u201d My voice was so small. I couldn\u2019t be sure he\u2019d heard me until he stepped away, kissing me gently on the cheek before he went.</p><p>I could have been sleeping on my feet, but I managed to make my way back to our bed. In the whirlwind of this physical onslaught, my mind kept asking what had happened. What had brought this on? This wasn\u2019t a hangover. This wasn\u2019t any kind of sick I\u2019d ever been, and my brain was too murky to make sense of it. I sank into the bed and the second the blanket covered me, the welcome warmth was just enough to pull me back into the same deep sleep. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The night was black but slowly the details of my surroundings began to register. The grass was wet on my feet. Cool against the warm air. Then he yanked me forward. Ignorant as I was, I still knew where we were going. The same place he\u2019d always led me. A hundred times maybe, and I went every time. Like the stupid, drunk girl I was, I followed.</p><p>Laughter. Everyone was laughing, celebrating. People I knew. I frowned, wondering why they were all here.</p><p>The pressure of his grip on my arm increased enough to be painful, and the familiar fear coiled in my gut. It was coming.</p><p>The vicious sneer, an expression painted on by his smug satisfaction, his hatred. He hated me. He had to, to do this to me. I\u2019d plead, but he\u2019d pin me down. The same gravel in his voice as he gritted out his plan for me.</p> <p>Except when I met his eyes they were different. No longer the dark round irises that haunted me. Confused, I searched his features until they solidified and recognition dawned. Max. The face, this body pressing down on me now, belonged to Max.</p><p>My heart lurched seconds before the familiar pain. No matter how hard I fought, he\u2019d always find his way in the darkness, taking what he wanted.</p><p>Powerless, I couldn\u2019t move. I couldn\u2019t run. Gasping for air, grasping for reality, I said his name. A questioning plea. Then, realizing I had a voice, even over the noise and the blur of laughter around us, I screamed. I screamed for help.</p><p>I shot up in the bed still screaming until I realized I was home, in our bedroom. Air rushed in and out of my lungs, feeding the lightheadedness. My skin crawled, tingling with sweat and imagined trails of another man\u2019s hands on me.</p><p>I started when Blake barreled through the door. He was shirtless, dressed in his pajama pants. He circled the bed and slowed, sitting on the edge of the bed. My breathing was ragged and uneven. After a minute he spoke, barely a whisper.</p> <p>\u201cCan I hold you, baby?\u201d</p><p>Eyes wide, I held his gaze. I couldn\u2019t speak, still too much in the dream. Could I let him? Did I want him to? I couldn\u2019t make sense of anything until he reached for me tentatively.</p><p>I caught his hands between us, keeping them at a safe distance. The sudden contact shot remembered pain through me. Still, against every instinct, I held them, something in me not wanting to let go. I clenched my jaw down, swallowing hard over the dry knot in my throat. Tears welled, but something inside me fought the reflex to fight. My rational mind reminded me that he was no enemy, that I needed him. Like holding onto an electric fence, I simply waited out the panic and pain.</p><p>\u201cErica...sweetheart. Breathe. It\u2019s just me, okay?\u201d</p><p>I breathed through it until my body relaxed enough to let me speak. I found my voice again, now hoarse. \u201cI had a dream. I... I\u2019m not sure what happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA nightmare...like the others?\u201d</p> <p>I nodded quickly. He\u2019d known about the dream and how it crept up on me sometimes, as much as I wished it would disappear forever.</p><p>\u201cKind of, but it was Max. He was Max, somehow.\u201d</p><p>I recalled his face, the dream version merging with the face my conscious mind knew. Then a rush of visions from the party fluttered through my brain. Marie, Michael, and a blur of people. Then Max, his arrogant smile as he hovered over my powerless body. Bile rose in my throat. I let go of Blake and wrapped my arms around myself, as if that could protect me from what my mind was showing me now.</p><p>\u201cBlake, what happened?\u201d I rushed, my eyes now wide with alarm. \u201cI can\u2019t remember, but I know something happened. Just tell me.\u201d</p><p>The grief in Blake\u2019s eyes as he worked his jaw confirmed it. \u201cHe didn\u2019t hurt you, baby.\u201d</p><p>Reaching up to touch me, he fisted his hand and lowered it before he could make contact. His complexion was pale save a dark bruise on his cheek that I hadn\u2019t noticed before. The muscles in his arms flexed as if he was restraining himself from touching me more. Then I noticed his hand, a thick white bandage wrapped around it.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re hurt.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, his jaw tight. \u201cHe\u2019s hurt worse.\u201d</p> <p>I covered my mouth. A new wave of nausea hit me as I tried to string the words together to ask him. I didn\u2019t want to know, but I had to. I held Blake\u2019s gaze, searching, wishing I didn\u2019t need to ask. If I didn\u2019t want to hear it, he didn\u2019t want to tell me.</p><p>The tears poured from my eyes as my body shook. I could only piece together a few details from the night, but somehow I knew something terrible had happened. And heaven help me, it had happened at Max\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cI need to know what he did,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>He closed his eyes a moment as if to collect his anger. \u201cI walked in on Max...touching you. He didn\u2019t\u2014he didn\u2019t have sex with you.\u201d</p><p>My eyes clenched shut, forcing more tears out. \u201cOh God.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were drugged. It was obvious. You could barely move. You\u2019ve been sleeping for a couple days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would he do this? Why?\u201d The words came out in a sob as I struggled to understand why he\u2019d want to hurt me, to put me through the kind of torture that I\u2019d barely survived before.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll never do anything like it again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you know that?\u201d</p><p>His eyes became serious and still in the brief silence. \u201cI rearranged his fucking face, Erica, that\u2019s why. We\u2019re both lucky I didn\u2019t kill him because I had every intention of it. Took three of them to pull me off of him.\u201d He flexed his hand, grimacing.</p><p>\u201cEveryone saw. I can\u2019t imagine what they must think.\u201d</p><p>He reached for my hand, pulling it away from my face. I licked my dry lips and took a steadying breath. The contact didn\u2019t hurt the way it had a moment ago. Something had rearranged in my mind as the dream separated from reality.</p><p>\u201cThey don\u2019t think anything. They know what he did. My mom\u2019s been worried sick. Marie\u2019s been calling off the hook. Alli, Christ, I\u2019ve had to turn her away a few times. I haven\u2019t had anyone by so you could rest. I knew you\u2019d need some time. No one thinks any less of you. I can guarantee they think a hell of a lot less of him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe called me a whore.\u201d I winced at the words as they resurfaced in my memory. \u201cSaid I\u2019d fucked my way to the top. He wants to ruin us, Blake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s the one who\u2019s ruined.\u201d</p><p>I flashed him a questioning look.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never seen Michael so devastated in my life. I don\u2019t know what will happen between them, but this is one fuck up that even Michael might not be able to look past. He pulled me off Max, but I\u2019ll never forget the way he looked at him. He didn\u2019t even go to him, to help him. He just walked away.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHe was telling me about wanting you two to make peace.\u201d</p><p>His nostrils flared. \u201cThere\u2019ll never be peace between us until one of us is dead.\u201d</p><p>Hatred played out on the hard lines of his features. I reached up and traced the tight muscle at his jaw. He released it, turning into my touch. He pressed a soft kiss against my fingertips. The sweet gesture began to unravel the horror I\u2019d woken with. Blake was here. We were together, both safe. I reminded myself of these truths over and over, even when my mind grappled with the broken memories of what Max had done.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure he didn\u2019t...\u201d</p> <p>His eyes widened, sadness lingering there. \u201cI\u2019m positive. I came looking for you before anyone else was there. His intentions were pretty clear, but he didn\u2019t get far.\u201d As if gentling a frightened child, he skimmed my arm, circling his thumb over my shoulder. \u201cI would have killed him. No one could have stopped me, then or now. His heart would have stopped beating if he\u2019d gone an inch farther than he had.\u201d</p><p>A strange kind of relief washed over me, as if I\u2019d narrowly escaped death. If Max had raped me, I couldn\u2019t begin to grasp what it would have done to me. It would be a kind of death all its own, the same way Mark had killed a part of me when he took my innocence years ago. I pushed down the lingering nausea, all the feelings new and fresh washing over me. A fine mist swept over my skin. He hadn\u2019t taken what he wanted, but the threat that he could have haunted me.</p><p>I outstretched a shaky hand to Blake\u2019s chest. Bringing myself closer to him physically was like pushing through a wall. All my instincts told me stay back where it was safe. He let me come to him, unhurried, his touch a whisper on my skin. Trembling from head to toe, I finally found a place on his lap. He caressed me slowly, carefully, up and down my back until I relaxed fully against him.</p><p>\u201cEverything\u2019s going to be okay. You\u2019re safe now. I\u2019ve got you, baby.\u201d</p><p>He hushed me quietly while I broke down in his arms. This new violation compounded with the weight of the old until I thought I\u2019d cried all the tears my body could produce. Through my sobs, he murmured reassurances. Promises of his love, that he\u2019d always protect me and keep me safe, filled the air around us until I believed it, with every ounce of my soul.</p> <p>The relentless fatigue that had weighed me down for days had finally lifted. For the first time since the party, I had energy, but at Blake\u2019s insistence, I stayed home from work another day. Unable to be alone with my rambling thoughts, I wasted an afternoon watching movies. Comedies with no emotional depth that couldn\u2019t threaten the mental peace I\u2019d been trying like hell to achieve.</p><p>I shrieked when the door to the apartment opened. Jumping up from the couch, I beheld Alli\u2019s worried face.</p><p>\u201cSorry, I didn\u2019t mean to scare you. I brought you lunch.\u201d She held up a paper bag.</p><p>I lowered my hand from my racing heart. \u201cOkay. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>She joined me on the couch, setting the bag down on the coffee table. \u201cSorry,\u201d she said again. \u201cHow are you doing? I wanted to see you sooner, but Blake insisted that you needed your rest. Heath told me he was at the office today, so I thought I\u2019d sneak in and see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay. Better. Whatever Max put in that drink completely took over my system for a while. But I\u2019m finally starting to feel human again. I\u2019m looking forward to getting back to work tomorrow though. Sitting around gives me too much time to overthink everything.\u201d</p> <p>She chewed her lip, her eyes glazing. Before I could say anything she pulled me into a tight hug. I held her back as I too fought tears. She knew. Everyone knew. I couldn\u2019t hide from my best friend and pretend that I wasn\u2019t hurting.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t even know what to say,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI\u2019m still in disbelief. I just can\u2019t believe it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Alli. I\u2019m okay,\u201d I reassured her, wanting to believe it too, even as my voice wavered. Maybe I wasn\u2019t okay today, but I would be. I would get through this, the same way I got through it before. Except the more I thought about what Max did and the party, the more I questioned if I\u2019d ever really gotten over what Mark had done to me.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not okay. He can\u2019t get away with this, Erica.\u201d</p><p>I sat back and brushed my tears away. I didn\u2019t want to be breaking down right now. I didn\u2019t want to stir it all up again when I\u2019d spent all day trying to forget. In addition to bombarding my brain with mindless television, I had been busy shoving down the memories of the other night that kept popping up, back down to the dark place I kept Mark\u2019s memories. I didn\u2019t want to think about any of it.</p><p>\u201cErica?\u201d</p><p>I looked up.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to police, aren\u2019t you? They\u2019ll need you to cooperate with them if they are going to prosecute.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI think so,\u201d I said, betraying the fact that I still wasn\u2019t really convinced that I could go through with it.</p><p>\u201cYou have to. I can\u2019t believe he\u2019s got the audacity to press charges against Blake after what he did to you. His vengeance seriously has no bounds. The whole thing is so backwards and wrong.\u201d</p><p>I sat up straighter, making sure I\u2019d heard her right. \u201cHe\u2019s doing what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlake didn\u2019t tell you? Max is pressing charges against Blake for assault. Obviously he was acting in your behalf. The bastard deserved everything he got.\u201d</p><p>I let out a breath I\u2019d been holding. I let my forehead fall into my palm. \u201cI can\u2019t believe he didn\u2019t tell me that. He told me he messed Max up, but I didn\u2019t even put it together that he could be in trouble over this. Shit, I can\u2019t even think straight. This isn\u2019t good.\u201d</p><p>Alli touched my shoulder gently. \u201cHe never wants to worry you. He knows this isn\u2019t easy for you, especially with what you went through with Mark. I\u2019m sure Heath would have probably done the same thing in Blake\u2019s shoes. Thankfully, the Landons have good lawyers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure the Popes do too. God, he doesn\u2019t need to be dealing with this shit too. Now I\u2019m upset all over again.\u201d</p><p>She sighed quietly. \u201cAre you going to talk to the police? Promise me you will.\u201d</p><p>I nodded quickly.</p><p>I\u2019d been wrestling with the prospect of going to the police. Blake had told me that they\u2019d left cards and would want to speak with me. Something about it scared the hell out of me. Maybe it was the same thing that had kept me from going to the police when Mark raped me. Deep down I\u2019d blamed myself. The blame and the shame of sharing the experience with someone else had kept me silent. I buried it all, so far down that I didn\u2019t care about finding my attacker, about having a voice. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But this was different. I knew Max, and no one could question about what he\u2019d done, with all the people who had been there. The drugs in my system were proof enough of his intentions. How I\u2019d find the strength to walk into the police station and tell my story though, I\u2019d never know. But if it helped Blake out of this madness, I\u2019d do whatever I needed to do.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go with you. You won\u2019t be alone.\u201d Alli reached for my hand.</p><p>\u201cThank you. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do without you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll never have to know. I\u2019m always here for you, and I\u2019m not going anywhere. We all are. We\u2019re all but family now.\u201d</p> <p>My heart pulsed with gratitude for her friendship.</p><p>\u201cHey, I have an idea.\u201d Alli brightened a little and took my hand.</p><p>I raised my eyebrows. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know this is probably the last thing on your mind, but what do you think about going dress shopping this week? It would take your mind off all of this upset.\u201d</p><p>I smiled and nodded. \u201cThat sounds perfect.\u201d</p> <p>CHAPTER SIXTEEN</p><p>\u201cAlli told me about Max pressing charges.\u201d</p><p>Blake had worked late and he hadn\u2019t been home five minutes before I approached him. I could think of little else since Alli left that afternoon. On top of that, I was pissed off that he didn\u2019t tell me right away. He tugged off his shirt and stepped out of the bedroom into the adjoining bathroom, effectively ignoring me. I followed him in.</p><p>\u201cBlake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaving criminal charges against you matters.\u201d</p> <p>He let out a sigh and turned toward me. I tried to hold my concentration on the matter at hand, but his shirtless body and the way he smelled when he pulled me close the way he did now always seemed to scatter my brain cells. A hand on my hip, he leaned down and pressed a soft kiss on my lips.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t worry me, so it shouldn\u2019t worry you, okay? You\u2019ve got enough on your mind.\u201d</p><p>I stared into his eyes, letting him know that I sure as hell was going to worry. \u201cWill this affect your work? What about Angelcom, or all the other businesses your name is attached to?\u201d</p><p>A short laugh escaped him. \u201cAre you talking about my reputation? Money talks, Erica, and thankfully I\u2019ve got plenty of it. The same reasons the board wanted to keep rubbing up against Max until I put their balls in a jar are the same reasons why none of this is going to matter to any of them. I\u2019m the one holding the cards. Anyway, I could give a shit what anyone else thinks.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t help the worry that rooted right next to all the hate I now held for Max.</p><p>Blake framed my face in his hands. \u201cListen to me. Do not worry about this. It\u2019s nothing I can\u2019t handle, and trust me that I\u2019m handling it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>He sighed and released me, leaving a few inches of distance between us.</p> <p>I looped my fingers into his jeans, tugging him back. His eyes widened a fraction.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to talk to the police tomorrow. I don\u2019t remember everything, but hopefully it\u2019ll be enough. If that means testifying or whatever, I\u2019ll do whatever I need to do.\u201d</p><p>He paused. \u201cI\u2019m glad to hear it. Not for my sake, but for yours.\u201d</p><p>I frowned. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I\u2019d do it if it weren\u2019t for your sake. I hate that he\u2019s done this to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t you tell the police your story, Erica? He deserves to face what he did, and God knows, you deserve justice. You\u2019ll never have it if you don\u2019t tell the police what happened. You\u2019re the victim, and they need to hear your story, not mine.\u201d</p><p>I dropped my gaze to Blake\u2019s waist where my fingers idly tangled in the loops of his jeans. \u201cThe thought of going through it all makes me sick, that\u2019s why.\u201d</p><p>He tipped my chin until I met his serious eyes. \u201cThere are times when it makes sense to let go, and there are times when you need to fight, no matter how miserable the idea might seem.\u201d</p><p>I got lost in his eyes for a second. \u201cAnd you want me to fight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t make the decision for you. But if this is any indication,\u201d he said, gesturing to the now deep red scabs decorating his knuckles, \u201cyou know where I stand on knocking him down to size.\u201d</p><p>I winced at his injury and how it\u2019d been incurred. I couldn\u2019t imagine Max\u2019s injuries, but I relished that he was likely still suffering with them. I drew in a deep breath through my nose. I\u2019d spent the past few days trying to push past all of it. I couldn\u2019t go down this road again. I wouldn\u2019t give Max the satisfaction of breaking me like Mark had.</p><p>\u201cI appreciate that you fought for me, but this isn\u2019t about revenge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. It\u2019s about holding Max Pope accountable for the first time in his life. He needs to learn a lesson that he\u2019s been working up to for a very long time. That\u2019s not revenge. That\u2019s justice. That\u2019s making a situation right that\u2019s been wrong for too long.\u201d</p><p>I could argue all I wanted, but Blake was right. Max hadn\u2019t just threatened me, crossing a line that could never be uncrossed. He\u2019d betrayed my trust, threatened both my business and Blake\u2019s. Blake\u2019s grievances extended far beyond the experiences we\u2019d shared with Max. Before I\u2019d even met Max, I\u2019d known he was a playboy, a spoiled young man. He skated above the consequences that would have fallen on anyone else. Instead, he\u2019d been shielded by his family\u2019s fortress of wealth and prominence. Professor Quinlan had used such a circumstance to his advantage, earning me a meeting with him with the promise that he\u2019d invest in Clozpin.</p><p>How long would this go on? How long could he wreak havoc over our lives without consequences, spurred by this mindless jealousy that Blake inspired in him? Maybe Blake was right. Perhaps this was the one strike that couldn\u2019t be ignored\u2014by Michael or by the law. Maybe this infraction would finally show him he wasn\u2019t immune from consequence.</p><p>Blake broke my thoughts with a kiss that was both tender and careful. Pulling back, he studied me. \u201cHow was your day? Are you feeling any better?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel fine. I told you that this morning. I\u2019m going back to work tomorrow, regardless of what you say. If I sit around here lazing around one more day, I\u2019m going to lose my mind.\u201d</p><p>He smirked. \u201cWell, we can\u2019t have that.\u201d</p><p>Turning away from me, he started the shower. He stripped naked and opened the door, filling the room with a rush of steam. I chewed my lip, following his backside as he stepped in under the stream. The fire that had lain dormant for days lit within me. Apparently the days of being deprived of intimacy had taken its toll, and now that my energy was back, I was having a hard time ignoring it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I wasn\u2019t sure if I was ready, but I missed our closeness. Blake had been careful with me. Exceedingly careful. I hated that what happened had put an invisible wall between us, separating us by our fear of hurting each other when I needed Blake more than ever.</p><p>I pushed my jeans past my hips to the floor and tugged off my bra and shirt at once. He turned to watch me, his countenance reflecting the quiet hunger that was simmering through me. I stepped into the shower behind him. He let me pass to share the water. Our bodies brushed close, setting off all the familiar alarms. My nipples grazed the soft hairs on his chest, hardening instantly. I paused my journey there, perfectly content with our proximity, the hot water pulsing down on us.</p><p>\u201cI missed you,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cI missed you too, baby.\u201d</p><p>I placed my hands on his chest, eager to feel every ridge slide under my fingertips, to entwine with him. I grazed lower over the taut muscles of his abs. I wanted to go lower. I wanted to feel his hot flesh in my hands, to know he wanted me as much as I wanted him. After all of this madness, I longed for his touch, for the reassurance that nothing had changed between us. I traced the line of hair that led from his navel downward. He caught my hand, halting my journey.</p><p>\u201cTurn around,\u201d he said quietly.</p><p>I gazed at him from under my lashes, my breath hitching with the simple command. Good things were usually in store when he told me to turn around. I spun and braced my hands on the cool marble of the shower wall. I closed my eyes, imagining his hands on me, while the water ran down my back between us.</p><p>I heard a small click, and then his hands were in my hair, massaging and lathering. While it wasn\u2019t the touch I expected, I welcomed it all the same. I let my head fall back as he rubbed ten tiny circles over my scalp.</p><p>\u201cFeel good?\u201d</p><p>I hummed. \u201cVery. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnytime.\u201d</p><p>I smiled. He moved the spray to rinse me and cleaned the rest of me from head to toe. He washed my shoulders, massaging the tense muscles as he went. Turning me so we were face to face again, he left no expanse untouched, between my breasts and over my belly. He avoided lingering anywhere I especially wanted him. The whole process was driving me crazy, but he didn\u2019t seem to be in a rush, nor did he seem to be enjoying the usual game of sexual torture that we so often played.</p><p>He knelt to rub the loofa along the soles of my feet. The sensation tickled, but seeing him crouched at my feet, unable to hide his desire bobbing under its own weight in front of me seemed to cancel that out. Every innocent contact piqued my craving for a more intimate touch. He was hard, and I was burning with need.</p><p>When he rose, I took the loofa from him and tossed it to the floor. I caught him by the hair and levered against him, bringing us chest to chest. He groaned and pushed me back against the shower wall. Instinct took over, and in seconds I was climbing him. Thigh over hip, arching into his hard body. He cupped my ass, increasing the contact. We couldn\u2019t be close enough.</p><p>\u201cI miss you. I want to feel you,\u201d I whimpered.</p><p>I caught a breath of air, before sealing my mouth over his again. His erection pressed against me, teasing against me. The connection sent a tingle of desire through me. But the sensation was tainted. I kissed him harder, drowning the doubt. He moaned, sliding his hand down my thigh. He trailed a slow path between my legs, slowing over my mound before cupping me. I tensed in his arms, not immediately understanding why. My chest heaved, my rapid breathing betraying the battle raging inside me. Shit.</p><p>\u201cBaby?\u201d</p><p>I kissed him fiercely, closing the small separation between us, answering any question he might have. Damn it all, I needed him. No less than I\u2019d ever needed him.</p><p>He pulled back and caught my roaming touch, stilling me. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to.\u201d</p><p>He hesitated. \u201cI know. I want to too, but...give yourself some time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I insisted, even as my voice wavered.</p><p>Was I? I knew what I wanted, what I craved, but I recognized the tension. On edge, ready to react, I battled with my desire. The battle made me as angry as I was horny, starving for him to love me, to fuck me right through the feeling that I didn\u2019t want to face.</p> <p>He kissed me, a slow chaste kiss that I barely felt through the heat and mist that collected on my skin. The gesture seemed to repeat his words.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, Blake,\u201d I repeated. \u201cHe didn\u2019t do anything. I\u2019m fine. Nothing\u2019s changed.\u201d</p><p>He stared down, concern swimming behind his eyes. \u201cJust because he didn\u2019t get a chance to follow through doesn\u2019t mean you haven\u2019t been through emotional hell. We\u2019re not talking about banged up knuckles. You know as well as I do those wounds go deeper than either of us want them to. You need time. We should take some time.\u201d</p><p>I hated that he was probably right. I hated that I\u2019d become so flawed and vulnerable in a matter of days. \u201cMaybe I\u2019m stronger than you give me credit for.\u201d</p><p>He let out an exasperated sigh. \u201cI have no doubts about your strength, Erica. I\u2019m talking about your state of mind, your well-being. You can\u2019t brush this whole thing off like it\u2019s nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about you let me tell what you what I can take?\u201d</p><p>My embarrassment mingled with the rejection. I left him there alone. In the bedroom I slammed drawers as I collected underwear and a shirt and then went to bed. Huddled onto my side, I tried to ignore his presence when he joined me. A moment passed before he came behind me, wrapping an arm around my waist. Pressing his lips to my shoulder, he caressed down my arm, eliciting a shiver that almost made me forget my irritation.</p><p>\u201cI pushed you past your limits before. Let me honor them now, even if you won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>I closed my eyes at the truth in his words. Truth and love and all the concern that the men who\u2019d lodged this emotional wall between us had none of. I sighed heavily, giving myself over to trusting him.</p><p>\u201cLook at me,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>Reluctantly I turned, positioning my body to face his. A smile softened his features as he traced my jaw, running a sensual line over my lips.</p><p>\u201cI love you, even when you\u2019re marching around all pissed and indignant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate this.\u201d</p><p>His eyes dimmed. \u201cI know you do. I know we both want more, but it\u2019s worth waiting for. Tonight, all I want is to taste your sweet lips and hold you. I have the rest of my life to make love to you. Tonight, I just want you in my arms.\u201d</p><p>Something cracked in me, that need to fight wilting under Blake\u2019s gentle insistence. My muscles weakened, and I surrendered. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I walked into the office the next morning ready to face the day.

There was a whole range of possibilities for things I might not believe. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>PinDeelz is down. Sid said it\u2019s been down since last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo we know why?

As it did, a bold black and white image branded the screen. I\u2019d seen it before, on our own site. M89. The hacker group\u2019s logo had replaced the competing site\u2019s home page, but now I was more confused than ever.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand. If Trevor and Max have been in cahoots to build this thing, why would Trevor hack it? Moreover, how would he hack his own site?\u201d</p><p>Alli twisted a strand of hair between her fingertips. \u201cI don\u2019t either. Unless somehow things went sour with Trevor, and this is payback. Like he\u2019s making a statement or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust when I thought things couldn\u2019t get any stranger.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe good news is that at least one of their advertisers got back in touch about renewing their ad contract with us. Never mentioned PinDeelz of course, but I\u2019d say we can expect to hear from more of them now.\u201d</p><p>I chuckled softly. \u201cUnbelievable. We\u2019ll see how many come crawling back, I suppose. Or how long the site stays this way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of crawling back, what did you decide about Perry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe seems sorry, but it\u2019s not enough. Blake\u2019s right. It\u2019s a bad idea to get involved with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d have to agree.\u201d James\u2019s deeper voice interrupted us. He seemed to have appeared out of nowhere.</p><p>\u201cJames, hey,\u201d I said, confused about his presence in the office.</p> <p>\u201cAlli thought it\u2019d be a good idea for me to be in while you were out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d I nodded quickly, not wanting to think about Blake\u2019s potential reaction to this.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m glad you\u2019re here. Can we catch up for a second?\u201d</p><p>I left Alli for the small privacy of my office. James followed me and sank into the chair across from me.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on? What did I miss, other than an entire week?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI talked to your fianc\u00e9. That was pretty interesting, but I\u2019m going to stay on in-house for now.\u201d</p><p>I dropped my jaw and the shock settled over me. Already I was more overwhelmed than I expected to be in my first fifteen minutes back at work. Fear rooted in my stomach. \u201cAre you kidding me?\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing to worry about. You should probably talk to Landon about it though.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOkay, fine. In that case, you want to give me an update. I\u2019m behind on everything.\u201d</p><p>I spent the rest of the morning getting up to speed. After a week away from watching the pot boil, I could fully appreciate the progress that had been made in my absence. We were close to rolling out the changes that would have put us light years ahead of Max\u2019s site. While the threat of competition might be in the past, I could see clearly now that the competition had been important motivation to push us forward in an entirely new way.</p><p>As lunch approached my phone rang. My heart nearly stopped when I saw Risa\u2019s face light up the screen.</p><p>I answered, hesitating a moment. \u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cErica, it\u2019s Risa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Obviously. What the hell do you want?</p><p>\u201cListen, I know I\u2019m probably the last person you want to talk to. I just...I really need to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould we meet for lunch?\u201d</p><p>An anxious feeling rolled through me. Risa was associated with Max, and nothing good came of meeting with him to discuss business.</p><p>\u201cI have nothing to say to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, I\u2019m begging you. Please. I know you hate me. And you have every right to. If you don\u2019t want to ever see or talk to me again after today, I\u2019ll stay out of your life completely.\u201d</p><p>I stared at the white partition in front of me. She sounded different. She sounded...desperate. I wasn\u2019t supposed to care, but I did. I squeezed my eyes shut, trying to imagine how I was going to possibly handle this on my own. Then an idea occurred to me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll meet you at the corner deli near the office at noon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfect, thank you.\u201d</p><p>I hung up before she could say anything else and Skyped Alli to come talk to me.</p><p>She popped in a few seconds later. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy any chance, are you interested in meeting with Risa for lunch? She wants to talk to me. I don\u2019t trust her, and I don\u2019t trust myself not to strangle her if I go alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. I\u2019ve got a few words for her myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a date.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER SEVENTEEN</p><p>\u201cThank you again for meeting me.\u201d</p><p>Risa looked like a stray puppy sitting across from us. Alli sat back with her arms crossed, giving Risa her best stare down. I didn\u2019t think Alli was capable of hating anyone, but she looked pretty convincing right now. Even as pathetic as Risa looked, I struggled to pity her. Her normally pin-straight glossy hair was tossed into a messy bun. Dressed in jeans and a simple black button-up, her face made up, she looked tired and worn. The shrewd and energetic girl who\u2019d left Clozpin and taken my user database with her seemed to have aged in the short time since she\u2019d left. I wanted to tell her she looked like hell, but figured I\u2019d save it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still not convinced I should be wasting my time with you, so if you have something to say, say it.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes glistened as they darted between us. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I want you to know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a little late to be sorry,\u201d Alli snapped, taking the words from my mouth.</p><p>\u201cI know, and I don\u2019t expect forgiveness. I made a mistake. Max...he made me believe leaving was the right choice, the only choice if I wanted to make something of myself and push my career forward. He\u2019s not who I thought he was.\u201d</p><p>I clenched my jaw, keeping the words down. He wasn\u2019t who I thought he was either. He was so much worse.</p><p>\u201cHe used me to get to you,\u201d she continued, her wounded eyes pleading with me. \u201cHe played on all my emotions, my own jealousy and insecurities to get me to leave. But now, I don\u2019t even know who he is. He\u2019s in trouble, I think, and he\u2019s so obsessed with destroying Blake. It has nothing to do with the business I thought we were going to build together. It goes so much deeper than I ever realized.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I leaned forward, studying her. I began to see that she had no idea what had happened between Max and me.</p><p>\u201cRisa, Max drugged me and tried to have sex with me last week. That\u2019s how much he wants to hurt Blake. Trust me, you have no idea how depraved he is until you\u2019ve walked in my shoes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Her jaw fell open, her eyes fixed on me. \u201cOh my God. I didn\u2019t know. I knew he and Blake fought, but I had no idea.\u201d</p><p>I tensed against the emotions that threatened. I couldn\u2019t lose my shit in front of her, as much as Max\u2019s behavior still tore at me. I clung to my anger instead.</p> <p>\u201cYes. You should ask him about it. I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll spin some story about how I came onto him at my own engagement party. And maybe since you thought it\u2019d be a fun idea to tell Blake about James, you can swap stories about what a whore I am.\u201d I clenched my teeth, barely resisting the urge to leave. If nothing else, I\u2019d wanted to meet Risa once more to get my verbal pound of flesh. Who knows when I\u2019d get another chance to tell her what I thought.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019re a whore. At one point, in the heat of the moment after you\u2019d fired me, I mentioned that I saw you with James to Max. He\u2019s the one who wanted me to tell Blake. I didn\u2019t want to, really. Blake looked so angry when I told him that I regretted it immediately. I didn\u2019t even know you and Blake were engaged.\u201d</p><p>I lifted my chin, my lips in a tight line. \u201cAnd thriving, somehow, despite all this. Despite you and Max trying to ruin my business and our relationship, me, we\u2019re stronger than we ever were. So what do you want now? He\u2019s the one you chose. Now you have to live with that choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to leave him. I really do.\u201d Her eyes glistened. The napkin in her hand was twisted nearly to shreds. God, she was a legitimate mess.</p><p>\u201cThen leave him. It has no bearing on me.\u201d</p> <p>She nodded quickly, her head down. \u201cI want to,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI\u2019m afraid he\u2019ll ruin me. Whatever happened between you, he\u2019s a completely different person. I don\u2019t know who he is. I think he\u2019s in financial trouble. He said he can\u2019t fund the site anymore. Everything we worked for, down the drain. And I\u2019ve been overhearing conversations with his father. I don\u2019t know for sure, but I think he\u2019s cutting him off. Everything is so fucked up right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, Risa. But I don\u2019t really care either.\u201d</p><p>She released a heavy sigh. \u201cLet me make it up to you. I felt terrible before, but now...I can\u2019t believe what he did to you.\u201d</p><p>I laughed. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to make it up to me. I want to move on with my life, and you\u2019re not going to be a part of that. It sounds like you fell prey to a horrible person with terrible motives, but I\u2019m not the person to reach out to for help.\u201d</p><p>Her dark brown eyes looked serious for a moment. \u201cI can help you find Trevor.\u201d</p><p>I cocked an eyebrow. \u201cHe\u2019s pretty elusive. I have a hard time imagining he\u2019d let you or even Max get very close.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI can try to find proof that Max paid him, maybe an address so you could track him down. He\u2019s not going to stop. If anyone hates Blake more than Max, it\u2019s Trevor.\u201d</p><p>I narrowed my gaze at her, curiosity burning through me. Would I have a chance to find one enemy through another, or was this just a dangerous step that would bring Risa closer to my world when I wanted anything but?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll admit I\u2019m intrigued, but not enough to take the bait. Trevor isn\u2019t a concern of mine right now. Unlike you and your partners, I don\u2019t plan my days around revenge and counter attacks. I just want to move on with my life. I have a wedding to plan and a business to run. I\u2019m sorry Max took advantage of you. Maybe I shouldn\u2019t have, but I actually cared about you, Risa, and that\u2019s hard to forget. I hope if nothing else you learned a lesson from all of this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t expect you to take me back, but I want to make it right. I\u2019m going to make it up to you somehow.\u201d</p><p>I leaned against the wall in the cool dark hallway outside the office while I considered an early retirement. This had to have been the most emotionally exhausting day back to work in history. I lifted my phone and pulled up Blake\u2019s number.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up, baby?\u201d</p><p>I sighed, still unable to process all of it. \u201cSo...I had lunch with Risa today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d His concern came through clearly in that one word.</p> <p>\u201cI brought Alli with me, and Clay drove us. It was fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did she want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess she wants to make it up to me. Says she feels horrible about everything, though not surprisingly, Max didn\u2019t tell her what really happened at the party. She just thought you two got into a fistfight.\u201d</p><p>He snorted.</p><p>\u201cBut at least for now, she\u2019s still with him. She seems worried about him retaliating if she leaves. Honestly I feel sorry for her, even if she\u2019s made her own bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey deserve each other,\u201d he muttered, the clicking of a keyboard quiet in the background.</p><p>\u201cShe thinks that Michael is cutting him off.\u201d</p><p>Silence hung in the air. No clicking, no words, only the faint sound of Blake\u2019s breathing.</p><p>\u201cWhy does she think that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe said she overheard conversations between them. And he told her that he can\u2019t fund PinDeelz anymore. I\u2019m not sure, but I\u2019m guessing that might have something to do with the site being down. It says M89 hacked it right now, which makes no sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hacked the site.\u201d</p><p>My mouth opened to speak, but the words lodged there for a second. \u201cYou hacked their site?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t act so surprised. He had it coming.\u201d</p><p>If I weren\u2019t so shocked, I might have felt a little sorry for them. \u201cBut how...if Trevor built the site?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrevor is a troll, not a developer. And he obviously didn\u2019t build their site with the same dedication he has for hacking. I was able to get in and wipe the server with very little effort. He\u2019s a shitty programmer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut wait, what about the M89 logo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just did that to fuck with Max\u2019s head.\u201d</p><p>A short laugh escaped me. Blake was devious, but I kind of loved it.</p><p>\u201cMaybe it worked. Risa mentioned that Trevor fell off the map. Max can\u2019t reach him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo doubt because he\u2019s not paying him anymore. The business Max was using as a front to pay Trevor was dissolved a few days ago. If Michael is cutting him off, that might be why.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My mind spun as I absorbed these new details. Attacking me would have been the shot that set off this whole chain of events. And if what Risa said was true, Max\u2019s world might be imploding. His finances, his family, maybe even his freedom.</p><p>\u201cIf all this is happening because of Michael, it would make sense why none of your other investors would want to upset him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t let his charms fool you. Michael\u2019s a great guy, but he\u2019s not someone to cross.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut his own son?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMax is finally getting what he deserves. I have no sympathy for him, and neither should you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. Trust me, I don\u2019t,\u201d I said. My thoughts drifted. I still had to speak with the police, and I was less than thrilled about it.</p><p>\u201cI have to run, Erica. I have a call. But I forgot to tell you earlier that Mom wanted to have us for dinner tomorrow night. I told her we\u2019d go, but I wasn\u2019t thinking. Are you okay going there and seeing everyone so soon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. Blake, I love your family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but after everything that went down...we don\u2019t have to go if you don\u2019t want to go back there so soon.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s fine. Really, I\u2019m fine. I have to move on. I can\u2019t undo what happened, but I can\u2019t dwell on it either. Remember that I\u2019ve been through worse. Beyond that, it\u2019d be nice to get together with everyone. Most of the time they overwhelm me, but you\u2019ve been keeping me in isolation long enough. I\u2019m actually looking forward to all the commotion now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll let her know we\u2019ll be there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, baby.\u201d</p><p>I smiled. \u201cLove you too.\u201d</p><p>I focused intently on the magazine on my lap, trying like hell not to feel overwhelmed. Living inside my brain lately was like living inside a three-ring circus. Sid and James had the re-launch plans under control, so Alli and I decided to take the afternoon off to go dress shopping. I was still reeling from the meeting with Risa so I didn\u2019t argue when she suggested the break.</p> <p>\u201cBaby girl.\u201d</p><p>I lifted my gaze to find Marie walking toward me. She smiled warmly, but I could see the worry in her eyes. I rose from the bridal shop\u2019s ornate cream-colored couch, and hugged her when she was close enough.</p><p>\u201cYou look good, honey. How are you feeling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good,\u201d I insisted, swallowing over the rush of emotions that came with seeing her again. \u201cI feel really good. Back to work and everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad.\u201d She didn\u2019t budge, her arms wrapped tightly around my shoulders. The longer we stood that way, the less control I had over the tears burning behind my eyes.</p><p>\u201cMarie.\u201d I laughed weakly to keep from sobbing. \u201cYou\u2019re going to make me cry again. I can\u2019t cry over this anymore.\u201d</p><p>She pulled away, her eyes glistening as mine were. \u201cIt\u2019s okay to cry. What happened was terrible. I can\u2019t imagine what you must be going through.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head and rubbed my eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing I haven\u2019t already survived. I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p> <p>She frowned and I regretted the words as soon as they slipped from my lips. I had started to take for granted that everyone knew about Max, and most even knew about Mark. Having my past so out in the open wasn\u2019t a comfortable feeling, but oddly it had given me a small measure of relief. Sometimes hiding what had happened and pretending like it hadn\u2019t become a part of me took more energy than simply owning it.</p><p>Over the past few years I had often battled over whether or not to tell Marie about what happened with Mark, but in the end, decided it was better not to burden her with it. I don\u2019t know why I said it now, except to take another step toward bringing that scar out into the light. Still, I didn\u2019t want to worry her with it today.</p><p>She rubbed up and down the tops of my arms slowly. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. Forget it. This is supposed to be a happy day. Right?\u201d I smiled and sniffed, trying to pull myself back together.</p><p>Her lips were tight and then she released a small sigh. \u201cOf course. Thank you for inviting me. I\u2019m not sure how I\u2019m going to keep from balling like a baby when I see you in a white dress though. Have you picked anything out?\u201d</p><p>I looked around for Alli. \u201cNo, not yet. Alli is with the sales lady picking out dresses for me. She says she knows what I want anyway. She usually does, so I\u2019m going with it.\u201d I shrugged.</p><p>Then Alli emerged with another young woman. They both had their arms full of more white lace than I\u2019d ever know what to do with.</p><p>My stomach fell. Oh hell, here we go.</p><p>Fifteen minutes later, the sales lady was clipping the back of my dress, cinching the fabric tightly around my bust and waist. Carefully I stepped into the little room the store had reserved for us. Alli and Marie sat on the edge of the couch, eyes wide as I emerged. I turned to face the mirrors.</p><p>Marie\u2019s hands went to her mouth. Before I could let the waterworks loose, I turned my focus back to the dress. It was beautiful, but the details of its design escaped me when all I could imagine was walking toward Blake in it. To be his wife. To be his, forever.</p><p>The reality of that thought hit me like a sledgehammer. I didn\u2019t know if I wanted to be sick or pass out or launch into tears. All I knew was up until this moment, the thought of getting married had seemed more abstract. Right now, it was real and staring me in the face, impossible to ignore.</p><p>Alli came up beside me with a broad smile. \u201cIt\u2019s beautiful. I love it. Do you like it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is really happening,\u201d was all I could say.</p><p>She laughed and squeezed my shoulders. \u201cYes! This is happening, and you\u2019re going to be so happy.\u201d</p><p>I laughed a little at how surreal it all felt. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I\u2019m doing this. I\u2019m actually getting married.\u201d</p><p>Marie stood on the other side and took my hand, so much love in her eyes. \u201cYou ready for this, honey?\u201d</p><p>I stared back at her reflection, frozen as I asked myself the same question. A weight inside me lifted when I heard myself answer.</p><p>Yes.</p><p>I\u2019d never been more ready.</p><p>CHAPTER EIGHTEEN</p><p>I stared down at my feet as they sank into the wet sand. Wave after wave lapped against my calves. While we waited for dinner, Blake and I had walked down to the shore, stopping at the edge of his parents\u2019 private beach. I took in the salty air, moist on my skin in the warm summer night. I lifted my gaze to the darkening horizon. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t you feel like we\u2019re standing at the edge of the world?\u201d</p><p>Blake bent to catch a shell rolling up with the tide. \u201cI suppose so.\u201d He tossed it back into the restless waters. \u201cYou love the ocean, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do. I\u2019m not sure I can ever be without it again.\u201d I laughed quietly. \u201cI guess I like living on the edge.\u201d</p><p>I met Blake\u2019s gaze. His eyes were quiet, contemplative. The fading glow of the sunset cast shadows across his face. The vintage T-shirt he wore ruffled in the breeze blowing off the ocean. Though still damp at the bottom, his jeans were rolled up past his ankles. Blake was perfect in all the ways that mattered to me. Perfect and all mine.</p> <p>He took my hand and pulled me to him. I went willingly, loving the warmth of his embrace. He circled my waist, bringing us chest to chest. My hands found his hair, mussing the dark brown strands. I smiled, memorizing him and this moment.</p><p>\u201cSometimes I wish I could just sweep you up and take you away. Run away from all this madness and take a real break. A long break.\u201d</p><p>I drew in a breath. I couldn\u2019t agree more, but I also knew how unrealistic it was. I\u2019d spent a long time wishing I could run away from my life, but not having any idea where or whom to run to. Instead I\u2019d resisted the urge and forged ahead, making life work through the hardest times. Through my mother\u2019s death, through the separation from the only father I\u2019d ever known until recently, and then through the hell that Mark had put me through. And here I was\u2014stronger, happier than I\u2019d ever been, enjoying this perfect moment with the man I loved so completely.</p><p>\u201cI want to escape with you too. But this is our home, and our lives will always be here waiting for us. Besides, taking more time off would send me into a meltdown. I have a ton of catching up to do from being out so long.\u201d I immediately thought of the mountain of work I\u2019d barely put a dent in today. Risa\u2019s lunch had thrown me off when my focus should have been on the details surrounding the impending upgrades.</p><p>Then I remembered something.</p> <p>\u201cSo what is going on with James? I nearly had a heart attack when I saw him at the office this morning. What happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlli wanted him in the office to help while you were out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t imagine that\u2019s the only reason why you let him stay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, we talked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe came to you?\u201d I pulled back slightly, in disbelief that James would actually seek Blake out, or vice-versa.</p><p>\u201cI think we can both agree that he\u2019s fairly protective of you, so when Alli hinted that you\u2019d been hurt, it didn\u2019t take long for him to show up at my office wanting to know more.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think initially he wanted to know that I didn\u2019t have anything to do with you being hurt. He seems caught up on this idea that I abuse you.\u201d</p><p>He winced, and I didn\u2019t like the emotions that played out there.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it has anything to do with you. His dad was violent. I think it\u2019s a sensitive subject for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe that\u2019s it. Anyway, after learning that Max attacked you and knowing that Daniel hurt you too, he posed a compelling argument that he stay, for your sake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you agreed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBasically, as much as I would like to, I can\u2019t be with you twenty four hours a day. With everything that has happened lately, it makes sense that James be there to make sure that you can be safe at work.\u201d</p><p>I put more of a separation between us, staring at him in disbelief.</p> <p>\u201cLet me make sure I have this right. Are you telling me that you\u2019re willing to let James stay with the company with the understanding that he act as my in-house bodyguard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cErica.\u201d An undercurrent of warning came through as he uttered my name. \u201cIf you think I\u2019m taking any chances with your safety, you\u2019re crazy.\u201d</p><p>I tried to step away but he didn\u2019t budge. \u201cI can\u2019t stand the idea of having all of you hovering around me, waiting for something terrible happen. I want to be trusted to take care of myself, at least a little bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but taking care of you is my job now. Remember?\u201d</p><p>True enough. I\u2019d given up the right to fight him on this matter.</p><p>\u201cBeyond that, I knew agreeing to remove James from your life wasn\u2019t an easy decision for you to make.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t give me much choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou still had a choice. I\u2019m glad you made it and were willing to make that sacrifice for us. I\u2019m not saying I completely trust that he doesn\u2019t still harbor feelings for you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s seeing Simone. I\u2019m pretty confident he\u2019s moved on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe made a point to tell me as much. I haven\u2019t had much success with getting over you personally, so you\u2019ll excuse me for taking his reassurance with a grain of salt. As I was saying, he might still care about you, but as long as he can keep his hands to himself, those feelings can serve to keep you safe and out of danger while you\u2019re away from me. Keeping him there seemed like a worthwhile concession.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlake Landon making a concession?\u201d I rolled my eyes.</p><p>He hauled me back up, slapping my ass through the thin cotton of my dress. I yelped and squirmed.</p><p>\u201cRoll those pretty blue eyes at me again, and you\u2019ll regret it.\u201d He massaged me where he\u2019d made contact, grabbing me gently. \u201cMaybe you could thank me instead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d I meant to sound sarcastic. Instead I was breathless as he pressed me against him, his hands splayed possessively at my back and over my ass.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s more like it.\u201d</p><p>I suppressed a smile. \u201cYou\u2019re hopeless, you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Hopelessly in love with you. Get used to it. Marriage is forever.\u201d</p><p>His eyes glittered in a way that made me forget I was annoyed with him.</p><p>\u201cOn that note, actually. I was hoping we could talk about wedding plans tonight.\u201d</p><p>I weakened a little. \u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>He took my hand and we began to walk back toward his parents\u2019 house.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s any secret that you can\u2019t quite compete with Alli\u2019s enthusiasm over all this wedding stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou picked up on that, did you?\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cI\u2019m very observant. But I was thinking maybe we can scrap all this elaborate planning, and just do something small. We can still have my family, your family, but skip trying to put on some big display. I want to be married to you, Erica. I don\u2019t want to wait. Put me in a pink cummerbund, and let\u2019s just do it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally. What do you think? We could do it here or at the Vineyard. A little ceremony on the beach, get some pictures, and spend a couple weeks at the house there just us. Then I can re-explore every inch of your body with the sweet satisfaction of knowing you\u2019re my wife.\u201d</p><p>I smiled broadly, loving the sound of all of that. Especially the re-exploring my body part.</p><p>\u201cSounds perfect.\u201d</p> <p>He raised an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cAll of it. It sounds perfect.\u201d</p><p>Alli nearly overflowed my glass of Pinot Grigio laughing over something Heath was saying. I was too busy listening to Fiona vent about her last date gone wrong. A couple empty bottles littered the table as we finished yet another expertly cooked family dinner, courtesy of Greg, who was proving to be a force in the kitchen.</p><p>Greg tended to be quiet, as least compared to the rest of the family. But he was approachable. More approachable than Blake was at times, though I could see similarities between the two men. How people became a product of their parents always fascinated me, maybe because it was a perspective I\u2019d largely lacked. Blake was so different from both Heath and Fiona, yet they all shared this common thread that made them a family.</p><p>I could not have asked for a better family to become a part of. My heart swelled every time I thought of what a blessing they\u2019d become. Having Blake would have been enough, but becoming a part of their world made the whole prospect of marrying into another family more than I would have ever expected.</p> <p>Catherine defied all the horror stories I\u2019d ever heard about wretched mothers-in-law, and Fiona was sweet, plain and simple. Heath, as troubled as he\u2019d been, too was becoming a loyal friend. And Greg seemed to be the glue that held everyone together.</p><p>A sudden dinging rang out and my gaze fell on the glass that Blake held.</p><p>\u201cWe have a little announcement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh! What is it?\u201d Alli clapped her hands together, straightening in her chair.</p><p>\u201cYou already proposed, Blake. Enough of the fanfare. You\u2019re making me look bad,\u201d Heath said.</p><p>Alli turned a deep shade of red and shoved him. He caught her by the wrist, pulling her back to him and planting a chaste kiss on her lips.</p> <p>Blake cleared his throat. \u201cAnyway, we wanted to let you know that we\u2019ve made some decisions about the wedding.\u201d He looked to me, silently letting me know I could take the floor if I wanted to.</p><p>I inhaled a deep breath and began. \u201cWell, as most of you know, I haven\u2019t had a lot of time and energy to devote to wedding planning. I know you all were probably wanting and hoping for something big, which, to be honest, has been a little intimidating.\u201d</p><p>Catherine shook her head. \u201cNonsense. We are here to support you and Blake, no matter what you decide. Selfishly of course, I would love to be there to see my son get married, but however you want to do it is entirely up to you. It\u2019s your special day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would love to have you there, all of you. You all have already become my family...\u201d I tapped my foot nervously, reminding myself not to start crying. Damn if this wasn\u2019t a sensitive subject. Then I felt Blake\u2019s hand on my knee, reassuring me. \u201cAnd my own family being so small and kind of distant, we thought that it would be wonderful to have something small with the few people close to us. For the sake of simplicity maybe, and also because we could do it sooner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not pregnant, are you?\u201d Heath blurted out.</p><p>He was nursing a glass of wine. Alli frowned and hit him harder on the shoulder. He shot her an apologetic look.</p><p>\u201cNo, definitely not,\u201d I said quickly.</p><p>Catherine grabbed the last nearly empty bottle of wine and refilled her glass. \u201cWell, you wouldn\u2019t get any arguments from us. We\u2019re bored and retired. I need a grandbaby sooner rather than later.\u201d</p> <p>I snapped my jaw shut. Oh hell. Blake could barely hide a grin. He gave my knee another small squeeze.</p><p>\u201cDinner was great, Mom. I think that might be our cue to head home.\u201d</p><p>Maybe the white wine and ocean air did something to me, because I couldn\u2019t keep my hands off Blake as he drove us back to the city. I crept my hand over his thigh to the bulge in his jeans and kneaded gently. He placed his hand over mine but didn\u2019t stop me.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing, sweetheart?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you tonight, Blake. I can\u2019t wait anymore.\u201d I stroked him, his erection growing under my touch. I wanted every inch of him, and tonight I\u2019d have it. I didn\u2019t care what had happened. Blake was my lover, and our bodies were made for everything I wanted to give him tonight. It had been too long and I needed him. Except need didn\u2019t do justice to the emotions running through me tonight. Something else was at work, and slowly I had begun to put it together.</p><p>His hold over me firmed, slowing my movements. He worked his jaw, and I could sense his concern.</p><p>\u201cWait until we get home,\u201d he said quietly.</p><p>I thumbed over the soft head of his cock and grasping him more firmly.</p><p>He sucked in a sharp breath. \u201cChrist.\u201d</p><p>I hummed with pure female satisfaction, leaning over so more of our bodies made contact. \u201cI don\u2019t want to wait,\u201d I whispered into his ear. My breasts rubbed against his arm as I reached to unzip his fly.</p><p>But he stopped me. \u201cErica, put your hands on your knees. Right now.\u201d His expression hardened as the sharp command left his lips, the earlier vulnerability disappearing.</p><p>My heart beat rapidly as I assessed his mood. Was he mad or bossing me around? Regardless, a little rush at being told what to do fluttered through me, settling low in my belly. I eased back into the seat and rested my hands on my knees.</p><p>He glanced at me briefly before turning his attention back to the road.</p><p>\u201cLift up your skirt and take your panties off. I want to see you.\u201d</p><p>I smiled, pleased with where this was going. I obeyed and hiked my skirt up high enough so he could see me naked and ready for him. I wanted nothing more than to straddle him on the highway, but I could live with this until we got home.</p><p>\u201cGood. Now touch your breasts.\u201d</p><p>I hesitated a second, considering his request and how hot it made me. Then I cupped my hands over my breasts, noticing how heavy and tight they\u2019d already become.</p><p>\u201cPinch your nipples, just like I would. Nice and hard.\u201d</p><p>I did as he asked, and the sensation arrowed to my pussy. I stifled a tiny moan. My nipples quickly beaded into taut buds begging for his mouth. The way he looked back at me now, his eyes dark and dangerous, melted me on the spot. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cTell me how that feels.\u201d</p><p>I closed my eyes and squirmed, the feel of leather on my ass reminding me of my nakedness. I groaned. \u201cI\u2019m warm all over. But I\u2019m frustrated. I want your hands on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you do, baby. Soon enough. Do you want me to let you touch yourself some more?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Please.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow about you slide your fingers into your pussy and tell me how that feels.\u201d</p><p>I exhaled sharply, my need urgent now. I couldn\u2019t possibly last long this way. I moved down to my torso until my fingers traced the seam of my sex. I glided my index finger along my opening, over my sensitive clit, and back down again. I opened my eyes to find Blake\u2019s on me again, his tongue wetting his lower lip. Seeing that small sign of his own hunger, I pressed into myself. I arched my back off the seat and moaned, wishing he were filling me now, where I\u2019d wanted him for so long.</p><p>He adjusted himself before hitting the gas a little harder. \u201cTalk to me, baby. We\u2019re close.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could be inside me so easily. I want you here, your mouth and your cock. It\u2019s not enough, just me. I have to have you or I\u2019m going to lose my mind, Blake.\u201d I grabbed my breast with my free hand, pinching my nipple as he\u2019d told me to before.</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d he breathed. His grip tightened on the wheel.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I want. I want you moving inside me, slamming into me. I want to forget everything except how that feels, how perfect you make it feel every time.\u201d</p><p>He glanced sideways and caught my thigh with his free hand. He tugged my leg up so my knee rested on the console. I was fully open, exposed and eager for the attention he should have been putting on the road.</p><p>\u201cKeep going,\u201d he rasped.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the only one who\u2019s ever made me feel this way. I love it. I love you. I\u2019ve been going crazy missing you, needing you. Blake, I need you.\u201d</p><p>I pumped into my sensitive tissues, my mind reeling with want.</p><p>\u201cBlake, please,\u201d I moaned, having no care of where we were. I was close and I couldn\u2019t wait.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t stop. I want to see you come for me.\u201d</p><p>I did as he asked, desperate for any relief, even at my own hand. I edged closer to orgasm, the promise of it coiling tight in my muscles. Eyes closed, I had no idea where we were until the car came to a sudden stop and Blake\u2019s hands were at my breasts, his mouth hot and wet at my mouth.</p><p>\u201cCome, baby. Hurry.\u201d</p><p>His hand covered mine as I hastened my final strokes. My muscles tensed, my skin burning under the small places where we touched.</p><p>\u201cBlake,\u201d I breathed his name, over and over.</p><p>\u201cI love watching you do this. God, I want you so bad. So fucking bad.\u201d</p><p>Then I crashed over, just as his teeth sank down into my shoulder. I cried out, shaking with the force of the climax.</p><p>I came down slowly, the reality that I was spread eagle in his car on our not-so-private street slowly dawning. I swallowed over a gasp, gradually pulling myself back together. Blake leaned back, seeming to do the same as he stared through the window.</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER NINETEEN</p><p>I leaned back against the door of the apartment the minute it shut behind us, only a little sated. My legs were still jelly, but every cell was charged, ready for him.</p><p>\u201cCome here.\u201d</p><p>Blake turned after a few steps, hunger and hesitation at war on his beautiful features. Hunger won as he came back to me, pinning me gently. He kissed me, petal-soft brushes of his lips over mine. I shivered as he traced the skin of my shoulder down my arm, lacing our fingers together. He pulled back a fraction.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have to do this if you\u2019re not ready.\u201d</p><p>My heart ached at the smallest increase in separation between us, that small recession from where we\u2019d been moments ago. I gripped him by the hip, wishing I could will him back to me, wishing distance were the only obstacle between us.</p><p>\u201cI want to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can wait. God knows, I don\u2019t want to, but I can.\u201d</p><p>Strain laced the words as he spoke. I arched into his gentle touch\u2014whispers of skin on skin, quiet declarations of the love between us that had very recently had no outlet. Blake was my lover, and we loved with our bodies.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ready, Blake. I need this, to be this close to you.\u201d I had to find my way through this, so we could find ourselves in each other again.</p><p>He cupped my cheek, holding my gaze. \u201cI will wait. As long as you need to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo more waiting. I\u2019m...\u201d</p><p>I shook my head, not wanting to show him my doubts, but it was too late. He leaned away, his green eyes questioning me.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t take this anymore. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m ready or if I\u2019ll freak out somewhere along the way, but we have to try because I can\u2019t live like this, without you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m right here. I\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not the same. You know it\u2019s not. This is who we are, how we love, and sometimes I can\u2019t show you any other way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need time to work through this. I can see the hesitation in your eyes. I can feel it when you hold back. It shreds me. I can\u2019t stand the idea of being the one who scares you and brings you back to those memories.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know...God, you\u2019ll never know how sorry I am, for all of this.\u201d I sagged against the door, defeated by what Max had brought between us.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to be sorry. I\u2019ve told you a hundred times. You need to believe me when I say that. None of this is or has ever been your fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish I could make it go away. You have no idea how badly I want that...to have Mark\u2019s memory wiped away forever, but even his death couldn\u2019t do that. I thought maybe it would, but it didn\u2019t. It took away the fear that he could hurt me again, but what he did to me on the inside...I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll ever be free of it. I want to believe it won\u2019t haunt me one day, but all of this...lately...everything feels so fresh. Sometimes I feel like I\u2019m seeing it again, but with different eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know it sounds crazy, but before, with Mark, right after he attacked me and for the years after, I was never really better. I was functional and happy enough and moving forward with my life, but in order to be, I put what Mark did to me away. I locked him in a box, threw away the key, and convinced myself I was fine. But I wasn\u2019t. Before you came into my life, I hadn\u2019t really faced any of it. Maybe out of self-preservation with school, because I couldn\u2019t imagine letting the rape ruin me and everything I\u2019d worked so hard for. But I can\u2019t block it out anymore. It\u2019s like this terrible ugly scar and I\u2019m too exhausted to hide it anymore. You\u2019ve seen it, and you don\u2019t judge me or pity me for it. It\u2019s a part of me, and for the first time in years I\u2019m realizing that I\u2019m not all the way healed yet. And that\u2019s okay. But I\u2019m better because of you, because of us.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I brought us chest to chest again and kissed him softly. I breathed him in. His scent, his closeness, made me dizzy.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to lie to you, Blake. I\u2019m a little shell-shocked. I hate that I am, and that I reacted the way I did before. And I can\u2019t promise that I won\u2019t again, in some small way. Physically, there\u2019s no question about what I want, but I never know what will trigger my mind. You\u2019re right that I need time. But I can\u2019t spend that time away from you because you\u2019re the one who makes me better. You\u2019re the only one who can bring me through this, because I\u2019ve never trusted someone the way I trust you. I love you so much it hurts sometimes. You have to believe me, that you\u2019re the only one who can heal me, Blake.\u201d</p><p>I held him tightly, letting a tear fall down my cheek. The emotions running wild inside me were creeping over, one way or the other.</p><p>\u201cBaby,\u201d he breathed against my lips, his shoulders softened under my hands.</p> <p>\u201cPlease.\u201d I kissed him again, more firmly, more demanding.</p><p>He pulled away again slightly, worry etched into the lines at his eyes. I reached to him, but before I could seal the plea with another kiss he had lifted me up by the waist. I wrapped my legs around him and let him carry us to the darkness of the bedroom. He lowered me at the foot of the bed, never breaking the contact.</p><p>I sifted my hand through his hair, deepening the kiss and melding our bodies together. My tongue found the ridge of his lips, flicking lightly for entrance. He sighed against me, opening. Our hands slid over each other. Even as the tension radiated between us, every move was measured and unrushed as it had never been before. I couldn\u2019t remember when we\u2019d taken this much time and care. And even though a part of me was screaming for him to hurry, to take me with all the passion he possessed, somehow this was more important. This slow dance of asking with each touch.</p><p>As our clothes fell to the floor and our hands found their way to each other again. I broke our kiss and sat on the edge of the bed. I inched back, unsure how he wanted me or what I could handle. Only the moon lit the room, casting a violet glow on the ruffled sheets beneath me. He stood for a moment, a dedicated love painting his shadowed features.</p><p>Catching my foot, he lifted it to his lips and pressed a kiss to the pad of my big toe. I lay back, letting my body relax into the soft comforter as he worked his way up my calf, tracing a decadent path to my knee and up my thigh. Stopping just short of my pussy, he traveled the other side.</p> <p>The craving I\u2019d been battling for days was now impossible to ignore, impossible to resist. My earlier orgasm had done little to quell it. I wanted to beg, but he\u2019d take his time now regardless of what I said. Nothing would push him past the limits of his control. He followed his path with his hand, and my eyes flew open. I caught his hand mid-thigh, stilling his journey. Breathing through the rapid beating of my heart, I struggled as a different kind of rush worked its way through me.</p><p>His eyes widened, every muscle frozen in place. I searched for words as he waited for me to speak.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t use your hands, okay?\u201d My voice was small. I hated what the words implied, but I couldn\u2019t not tell him and risk this moment between us.</p><p>The line of his jaw hardened, the muscle below twitching. I gave his hand a reassuring squeeze.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d I said, avoiding the real reasons, reasons he\u2019d likely already deduced. One of the least pleasant memories I\u2019d had lately was of Max\u2019s hands on me that night. I wanted to squeeze my eyes shut until the image went away, but instead I focused on Blake.</p><p>He\u2019d let my foot fall back to the bed. Now he stood, penetrating me with his stare. He wouldn\u2019t miss a trick tonight. Most days, he was more tuned to my body than I was. Knowing what we were up against now, nothing would get past him.</p> <p>\u201cErica, I\u2019ve said this before, but we need a safe word. If you didn\u2019t think we needed one before, I need you to have one now.\u201d</p><p>I rolled my eyes.</p><p>\u201cThink of it as giving me peace of mind too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you when to stop. I always do,\u201d I insisted.</p><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s harder to tell me to stop and explain why. All you need is one word, and that says it all. It tells me to stop. It tells me I\u2019m pushing you too far, that your mind is screaming at you to tell me to stop enough to say it. We need one now, or we shouldn\u2019t go any further tonight because I won\u2019t risk pushing you. Not tonight.\u201d</p><p>I sighed, unconvinced that we needed one, but if it meant that much to Blake, I\u2019d relent. \u201cWhat should it be? Just pick something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have to pick it. It\u2019s your safe word. Pick a word that you won\u2019t hesitate to say if I\u2019m pushing you past your limits. I don\u2019t intend to, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLimit.\u201d</p> <p>He raised his eyebrows.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it. I\u2019ll say limit if you\u2019re doing anything that I can\u2019t handle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, that works.\u201d</p><p>He seemed convinced. He released a breath, and the worry in his eyes subsided. I had no idea that choosing the word would give him so much reassurance, because I\u2019d always thought of it differently. As if saying it meant I couldn\u2019t take all he could give me, or that I was fully subscribing to the submissive role that I had slipped further into than I\u2019d ever imagined.</p><p>Silence settled over us, an empty expanse that threatened our moment. I hooked my heel behind his thigh and pulled on his hand to coax him over me. Instead of settling between my legs, he lay beside me. I turned into his body, bringing us flush. Both our heads on the pillows, we stared into each other.</p><p>\u201cI want this,\u201d I whispered. \u201cPlease don\u2019t let me ruin this or scare you off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me exactly what you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you to make love to me, Blake, and never stop. For the rest of our lives, I want love in our bed. Nothing can come between us like this again, no matter what.\u201d</p><p>Before he could respond, I kissed him. It was a kiss full of frustration and determination and more than anything, love. Our love was what could pull us through this. He met my passion, angling me how he wanted me. We breathed each other\u2019s air and drank each other until the seconds turned into minutes. Until my lips were tender and swollen. The heat between us had made our skin sweat. My hesitations weren\u2019t gone, but they were far in the background. I circled the hard thickness of his erection between us, stroking him to the tip.</p><p>He groaned, arching his hips upwards into my grasp. I slid to the base and back to the tip, pumping him gently. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThis is what I want. Come here.\u201d</p><p>I pulled his hip toward me and rolled to my back. He moved with grace, hovering over me, but we barely touched. Hands on either side of my head, he lowered. The heat of our bodies met. He kissed my shoulder and nuzzled into my neck.</p><p>\u201cPut me inside you.\u201d</p><p>Trembling slightly, I found the hot flesh of his cock again and guided him to me until the head barely penetrated me. I pulled again at his hip and arched, signaling him to push into me. Inch by inch, he slid inside with no hint of resistance from my body.</p> <p>\u201cOh my God.\u201d My eyes rolled back, a wave of relief and pleasure flooding me. Every cell in my body seemed to sigh, because he was with me again, where he should have been all this time. This unbearable chasm between us had finally been breached, and nothing had ever felt more right.</p><p>\u201cLook at me,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>When I opened my eyes, Blake\u2019s were dark, hooded with lust. But the usual intensity that could barely be reined in had somehow been subdued behind his concern for me. He\u2019d rooted in me, nestling there until I spoke.</p><p>\u201cYou feel amazing, Blake.\u201d My voice wavered, thick with emotion. \u201cI feel like I could come already, but I want this to last.\u201d</p><p>He released his breath, rocking into me gently but not thrusting fully.</p> <p>\u201cYou know I\u2019m not opposed to making you come as much as you want. No need to hold back.\u201d</p><p>I smiled and wrapped my legs around his waist. Gripping his hips between my thighs, I coaxed him to push into me again. He did, again and again, each movement a little more sure, each press of our bodies unwinding me and washing away every thought that could haunt me in the midst of this perfect moment.</p><p>We loved that way, without words, his motions guided only by my own. We were in tune, as if his body heard me. With every surge of our bodies meeting, the fire inside me grew. I rushed my hands over his skin, wishing I could hurry his movements to sate this consuming hunger but loving the slow climb. The flame was no less intense, and the need to come no less potent.</p><p>\u201cTell me when you\u2019re going to come. Tell me what you need.\u201d</p><p>The desperation of his voice, his breath against my neck pushed me to the edge.</p><p>\u201cOh, God. Now... I\u2019m coming now.\u201d</p> <p>The flash of heat rushed over me as the orgasm took hold. I marked his skin with my nails when I needed more. I crushed down around him, creating an acute friction between us. He drove deeper, pushing me to that oblivion where no one else had ever taken me.</p><p>\u201cErica...\u201d</p><p>Over the pounding in my heart, I heard the question in his voice. He wanted to know I was with him, that we were okay to let go. He didn\u2019t need to be so careful. I was mindless now, immune to the terrors when we were this close to rapture.</p><p>\u201cI love you. I love you so much,\u201d I whimpered, tears forming in the corners of my eyes. Everything was incredibly right now, finally. The words left my lips again and again.</p><p>He took my hand in his, pressing it into the bed above my head. With the other, he gripped my hip and lifted me off the bed. He drove hard, and I cried out. The pleasure vibrated through me, soaring right over the climax that already had me breathless and weak.</p><p>\u201cNo one can take this away from us,\u201d he rasped, surging into me. He stole my next breath with a devouring kiss. Tightening his grasp where he held me, he came.</p><p>I opened an eye to daylight peeking in through the window. Another morning greeted us, and with one glance at the clock, I decided it was time to get moving. Blake\u2019s warm body curled behind me. Half the pillows had made their way to the floor. The sheets tangled around us. When I went to rise, he moaned, tugging me back so I was locked against his muscular chest.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s getting late. We should get up.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t care,\u201d he mumbled, nuzzling into my hair. \u201cYou\u2019re too pretty to leave.\u201d</p><p>I smiled. My heart swelled, and I relaxed into his embrace. He caressed a soft path down my arms, down the tops of my thighs, and back up to the jut of my hips. He caught me there and shifted me back. Enough that our bodies were molded together. Enough to feel how hard he was. The fact wasn\u2019t surprising, but it did threaten my ability to get to work on time.</p><p>We\u2019d had an amazing night, and I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about it. Not just the sex, which as always left me nothing short of boneless and satisfied in the most wonderful ways. But we\u2019d broken through a barrier, and we\u2019d done it together. I refused to let my past keep us apart, and we trusted each other enough to rise above the fears it had planted in both of us.</p><p>Something had changed between us over these past few weeks. Over all the push and pull, the snags in the road, we were learning to move forward together. Sometimes we were out of step and stumbled, but we were finding a new kind of rhythm. Every time we trusted each other, we moved with a little more grace.</p><p>The way Blake had made love to me last night had embodied that grace, and I couldn\u2019t have been any more relieved and fulfilled. I squeezed the arm that hugged around my waist, unable and unwilling to resist.</p><p>He made his way to my shoulder, raining kisses over my back and up to my neck. There his tongue darted out, licking and sucking gently at the sensitive skin. I closed my eyes and arched back into him before I even realized what I was doing. Encouraging him, leading us down a path I had no hope of turning away from.</p><p>I caught his hand and guided him to my front, down toward the V between my thighs. He stopped before he could touch me where I wanted him to, and I didn\u2019t have the strength to push him any further.</p><p>\u201cTouch me. It\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure?\u201d His voice was rough from sleep, making it all the more sexy as he released the muscle that was keeping him away.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure,\u201d I said.</p><p>Slowly he lowered his touch until he reached my pussy. With tentative strokes, he teased my clit. I added pressure to his fingers, urging him, even more sure that we were fine and this was absolutely what I wanted. Slowly and then more rapidly he moved over me until I could hear the wet sounds of his motions. A soft moan escaped my lips. Tension rippled through my core, the part of me that wanted to be filled.</p><p>Behind me, Blake lifted up to his elbow. He curled my hair around his hand and gave it a soft tug. I arched my neck, exposed as he continued his assault. His breath tickled my sensitive skin as he sucked and licked, and nibbled.</p><p>\u201cBlake,\u201d I whimpered. I pushed back against the heat of his erection.</p><p>\u201cSomething you want?\u201d He kissed along the line of my jaw and behind my ear, his diabolical fingers working their magic over my clit. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He left my clit to rub his cock against my entrance, teasing me. Against every instinct, I resisted the urge to push into him, to take him inside me all at once. He\u2019d call me greedy, because I was. I wanted all of him, and I hated to wait for it.</p><p>If that wasn\u2019t enough, he gripped tightly at my hip, securing me in place, ensuring that I\u2019d move only when he wanted me to. My skin burned under his dominant touch.</p><p>\u201cTell me what I like to hear, and I\u2019ll give you what you want.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFuck me, Blake. Make me yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, I love your dirty mouth,\u201d he murmured before pushing in a bare inch. \u201cDo you have any idea what it does to my cock when you beg me to fuck you?\u201d</p><p>I fisted my hand in the sheets. Already my longing was razor-sharp. He thrust in and out that small, maddening amount. Patiently I waited for more. Then he rolled his hips with a short thrust and pressed deeper. I gasped at the sensation of his small reward.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Blake. Please...please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have no idea how much I love hearing you tell me.\u201d</p> <p>Still he took his time, sinking into me inch by inch, driving me wild with the need to be fucked. His grip tightened and released. Then, without warning, he released me. His palm found contact with my ass a second later. I cried out, clenching helplessly around his cock, warmth rocketing through my limbs.</p><p>\u201cFuck, baby. I love watching my dick slide into you. So smooth, like this is where I was meant to be.\u201d He rooted with a sharp exhale. \u201cAnd you\u2019re so fucking tight. Takes my breath away.\u201d</p><p>My moan turned into a strangled cry when he slapped my ass again, harder than before. The responses of my body launched me into orbit as he began a rugged pace, driving deep into me. Our bodies molded tightly together. He banded an arm around my waist and slammed his hips into me from behind.</p><p>\u201cBlake,\u201d I cried out when he hit the end of me. Again and again, so quickly I was scrambling to the edge. At the brink, his hand slapped again, hard. I shuddered as the climax came down on me, shooting out into every limb. A second later, Blake was there. His cock buried deep with me, he groaned. He held himself there and the warm rush of his release filled me.</p><p>We lay there, wasted in the morning light. What a way to wake up.</p><p>After a moment, Blake slipped from me and rolled over to his back, his chest moving with the effort to catch his breath.</p> <p>\u201cShower?\u201d I asked, rolling to face him.</p><p>\u201cGo on. I\u2019ll join you in a minute.\u201d He turned his head, catching my stare. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>I traced a tiny circle over his shoulder. \u201cI was just thinking that I\u2019ll never get tired of putting that look on your face.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cYou\u2019d better get your sweet ass in that shower, before I make you put that look on my face for the rest of the afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have to work, Mister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust me. For that, work can wait.\u201d</p><p>He twisted and reached for me, but I scooted away, barely missing his attempt to pull me back to him. Not that I would have minded much, but I had my own mountain of work waiting for me at the office.</p><p>I lingered in the shower, my muscles taxed and tired. I smiled when I thought about all the ways we could make up for lost time over the weekend. Finally, realizing he wasn\u2019t coming, I finished up and turned off the shower.</p> <p>I stepped out, and when he wasn\u2019t in the bedroom, I went searching for him. Padding through the apartment, towel wrapped around my chest, I followed the sound of his voice and found him in the kitchen still wonderfully naked. His chest wore a few scratches from our weekend adventures, and his just-fucked wayward hair was adorable in a way only I could fully appreciate.</p><p>\u201cAll right, thanks. Let me know if anything else comes up.\u201d He ended the call and dropped the phone down on the counter. I was in his line of sight but he stared ahead.</p><p>\u201cIs everything okay?\u201d</p><p>He looked to me, but I couldn\u2019t tell what was going on in his head.</p><p>\u201cBlake?\u201d</p><p>He blinked, seeming to jar himself from whatever thoughts were buzzing through his head. \u201cEverything is fine. More than fine actually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho were you talking to on the phone?\u201d</p><p>He rubbed his forehead absently. \u201cThat was my lawyer. He wanted to let me know the charges were dropped. So the hearing was canceled.\u201d</p><p>I lifted my eyebrows. \u201cThat\u2019s it, just like that?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cJust like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would Max drop the charges against you? He can\u2019t possibly hate you any less that he did a week ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t drop them. The prosecutor simply dismissed them. The lawyer thinks maybe it\u2019s because of the nature of the situation, with Max being charged for sexual assault. Even with that though, he seemed to think it was a pretty lucky break. But I\u2019ll take it.\u201d</p><p>My chest fell with a sigh of relief. \u201cThat\u2019s great.\u201d</p><p>My thoughts immediately shifted to the nagging reminder that I still needed to go to the police station to give a statement. The charges against Blake had been my motivation to actually go through with it.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still going to the police, right?\u201d</p><p>He must have read the doubt in my eyes because he came to me. I stood still, paralyzed by the sight of his perfectly sculpted body. He stood before me and skimmed his palms down my arm. I shivered, his touch cool against my skin.</p><p>\u201cYou need to do this,\u201d he said quietly.</p><p>\u201cWhy? Why do I need to put myself through this?\u201d Tears quickly brimmed my eyes. Apprehension took root in my gut.</p><p>\u201cYou said it yourself that you still have healing to do. I\u2019m here for you. I always will be. I\u2019m here to love you in every way that you need to be loved. God knows, I can\u2019t help myself. But telling me, telling Alli... It\u2019s not enough. You need to be strong and stand up to what happened to you. Then and now. Every time I think about what Max did...what he could have done...my blood boils. But I can\u2019t do this for you. This is your chance to make things right, and you\u2019re the only one who can do it.\u201d</p><p>I closed my eyes. \u201cI can\u2019t. Something about it...I don\u2019t want to break down in front of a stranger. To admit how stupid I\u2019d been...how vulnerable he made me. Everyone saw.\u201d I choked over the last words.</p><p>He hushed me and pulled me close. I melted against him and let the tears fall.</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t stupid. He made you vulnerable, but you don\u2019t need to be now. You\u2019re strong.\u201d He held me a little tighter then. \u201cYou can do this.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>CHAPTER TWENTY</p><p>Officer Bates led me away from her desk to a small private room. She might have been my mother\u2019s age, a little heavy set. Her hair was pulled into a tight ponytail. A few short curls had escaped from it, framing a face that was lined.</p><p>The chair legs squeaked against the concrete floor, and we sat down at a table across from each other. I twisted my fingers together nervously as she opened a file and shuffled through some of the papers. My heart pounded at the walls of my chest as I waited for her. My meager lunch turned in my stomach a little. My pep talk affirmations were drowned out by the voice in my head that kept reminding me how much I didn\u2019t want to do this.</p><p>What Max had done was the ultimate trigger threatening to dredge up the past that I wanted to stay in the past. This was part of working through it. But I didn\u2019t know this woman. A stranger to me, she seemed as hard and cold as the room we now shared, and I didn\u2019t want to be vulnerable now to her, or anyone else for that matter.</p> <p>She scanned the papers and glanced over at me briefly. \u201cYou okay, hon?\u201d</p><p>I regained my focus on her face. My breathing had become erratic. I licked my lips. \u201cYes, I\u2019m fine. Just nervous, I guess.\u201d</p><p>She pulled out a piece of paper and positioned her pen above it. \u201cNo need to be nervous. All you need to do is tell me what happened exactly how you remember it. I\u2019m going to write it down here. I\u2019ll read it back to you when we\u2019re done. And if everything is accurate, you sign it and then we\u2019re done.\u201d</p><p>I nodded quickly. My mind had invented all of her coldness. In that second, she\u2019d become someone different, someone who maybe wasn\u2019t judging me in all the ways I was afraid she and the rest of the world would.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I finally said.</p> <p>\u201cTell me what happened the night of the assault.\u201d</p><p>I closed my eyes and let my mind travel back to the night.</p><p>Over the next half hour, I relayed to Officer Bates how the evening had unfolded. From talking to guests, and then Michael, to relenting to Max\u2019s request to speak privately. I told her all I could remember until everything went black. Over the past week or so, fragments of the night had resurfaced. I would have rather they hadn\u2019t, but any information might be helpful to paint a more complete picture of what had happened. The rest had been witnessed by Blake and several others. While she scribbled down the final pieces of my account, I cringed inwardly that anyone else had seen me so helpless.</p><p>\u201cIs there anything else you\u2019d like to add?\u201d</p><p>I shifted my focus back to her and shook my head, unsettled by how little I actually remembered from the night. As promised, she read it back to me. I signed it, my hand trembling slightly as I did.</p><p>Nervousness wasn\u2019t making me shake, but a flood of relief. This was over. Finally. She let me know that they would be in touch if they needed anything further and showed me out of the room.</p> <p>As I left, the concrete block that had taken up residence in my stomach lifted. It was all said and done, literally. I couldn\u2019t know if it would mean justice for Max, but it began to mean something more to me. I\u2019d done something I\u2019d never had the chance to do before. I\u2019d overcome my fears and insecurities enough to tell my story. I wanted to believe it was an important step toward healing.</p><p>I made my way through the rows of desks and back out to the bank of elevators. I waited there a moment before I heard a man\u2019s voice behind me. I turned slightly to see Daniel with another man who I recognized as one of the detectives I\u2019d spoken with.</p><p>\u201cMiss Hathaway. You must remember me, Detective Carmody?\u201d</p><p>My hand twitched, but he didn\u2019t reach out. Instead he maintained a casual stance, almost too casual compared to how shrewdly he was studying me. I forced an impassive look.</p><p>\u201cWhat brings you here?\u201d the detective asked.</p><p>My gaze flashed to Daniel. The displeasure in his countenance made my heart stop.</p><p>\u201cA private matter,\u201d I murmured.</p><p>\u201cFair enough. Well, Mr. Fitzgerald, thanks for your time. I\u2019ll leave you two alone.\u201d He shifted back to me and lifted his chin slightly. \u201cI\u2019ll be in touch.\u201d</p> <p>The elevator opened, and we stepped in together. I retreated to the back of the car, my hands going to the cold metal railing.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t say I was expecting to see you here.\u201d Daniel\u2019s expression revealed nothing.</p><p>Oh, shit. What if he thought I was talking to someone about the still unresolved case of Mark\u2019s suicide?</p><p>I stuttered over how to begin, not knowing what to say. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing about Mark.\u201d</p><p>He glanced up at the numbers descending above the elevator door. \u201cAssuming it has something to do with Max Pope then.\u201d</p><p>I stared at him stupidly, my brows knitted together. \u201cYes. But how did you know?\u201d</p><p>His gaze fell back down to mine. \u201cI run a law firm, remember? Who do you think he called first?\u201d</p><p>My jaw fell open. I startled when the bell dinged, announcing our arrival at the ground floor. He stepped out and I released my death grip on the railing to follow him. We pushed through the heavy doors of the police station and slowed a few steps outside. He pulled out a pack of cigarettes and tapped one out. I wrinkled my nose.</p><p>\u201cYou should really stop smoking.\u201d</p><p>He shot me an annoyed look and took in a drag. \u201cReally? I\u2019m at risk of losing a race that I\u2019ve sunk millions of my own money into. And you\u2019re telling me to give up smoking. You\u2019ve got to be kidding me.\u201d</p><p>I took a defensive step back. His anger, however fleeting, still had the power to make me take pause.</p><p>\u201cWhy were you in there?\u201d I asked, assuming whatever the reasons were tied directly to his presently pissy mood.</p><p>\u201cBecause someone is leaking information to the cops.\u201d</p><p>I froze. None of that sounded good. \u201cWhat information?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone leaked a tip that you\u2019re my daughter. They know good and goddamn well how damaging it\u2019s going to be to my campaign too. Pricks.\u201d He grimaced and blew out a smoky breath.</p><p>That would have explained why Carmody looked at me that way, like he knew a secret. He did.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t deny it?\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cWhat\u2019s the point? You clearly are, and if there\u2019s any doubt, a simple DNA test would confirm it. The two of us drink a cup of coffee in their office and they would have their proof.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho would have tipped them off though?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, a bitter smile twisting his lips. \u201cCall me crazy, but I\u2019ve got your fianc\u00e9 at the top of that list. Unless you want to start telling me who else knows, because I sure as hell haven\u2019t been advertising it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My stomach plummeted as I mentally ran through the list. Sid, Alli, Marie...maybe even Heath knew now. But none of them would have any reason to benefit from the information being made public.</p><p>Blake had his own reasons to out Daniel, but would he do that? Even after I\u2019d made him promise me he wouldn\u2019t? Maybe learning that Daniel had hit me would have been enough to nullify that promise. In the context of our new arrangement, maybe his promise meant nothing at all if Blake deemed it in my best interest. Still, that seemed an extreme position to take. The repercussions of this information going public would be damaging for Daniel, but I couldn\u2019t see how Blake would want to bring the extra attention to me either. He wouldn\u2019t do that to me. Would he?</p><p>\u201cDaniel, Blake knows I\u2019m your daughter, yes, but I really don\u2019t believe he would leak the information. He assured me he wouldn\u2019t do that to you.\u201d I hoped he couldn\u2019t hear the doubt in my voice, because above all, I wanted to keep us safe. I\u2019d lived under the fear of Daniel\u2019s death threats before.</p><p>He laughed again, sucking in a long drag on his cigarette.</p> <p>\u201cHe promised me,\u201d I insisted.</p><p>\u201cI promise Margo about ten things a day. Keeps her happy just to hear me say it even if I don\u2019t always deliver. Sorry if I don\u2019t put a lot of stock into your hacker\u2019s promises. Lot of fucking thanks I get for getting his ass out of a jam too.\u201d</p><p>I frowned. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho do you think got the charges dropped?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did that?\u201d I hesitated as I absorbed this news. \u201cHow?\u201d</p> <p>He looked at me sidelong, an almost bored expression on his face. \u201cShouldn\u2019t surprise you that I have a few prosecutors who owe me favors. Wasn\u2019t too much to ask someone to look the other way for someone defending a sexual assault. He tuned Max up pretty good though, I\u2019ll say that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you know what happened.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, his expression still blank, if a little more tense.</p><p>\u201cBut if he came to you, isn\u2019t your firm defending Max?\u201d</p><p>He grimaced then. \u201cFuck no. Jesus, who do you think I am?\u201d</p><p>My eyes went wide, too wide maybe in response to what he was asking. Who was he? One minute he could be tugging at my heart strings, and the next he could be ruthlessly threatening to eliminate the man I loved. I couldn\u2019t ever be sure what kind of man Daniel was.</p> <p>He exhaled sharply. \u201cAs much as I may not want the world to know it, you are my daughter. And the man drugged you and tried to rape you. I\u2019m probably going straight to hell anyway, but I\u2019m not completely fucking heartless. It\u2019s enough I have to live with what Mark did. I may not always follow the rules, but I\u2019m not about to help Max get off scot-free.\u201d</p><p>My brain spun with all of this new information. I would have never told Daniel about the attack, but a small part of me was glad that he knew, especially if it meant snubbing Max from the protection of one of the most prominent firms in the city.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do now?\u201d I asked quietly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got to talk to my PR people about damage control. I\u2019d say it\u2019s only a matter of days before all this hits the presses.\u201d</p><p>He studied me a moment. \u201cIf you really believe Blake didn\u2019t leak the info, then you can tell him to at least help me find out who did.\u201d He tossed his cigarette on the ground, and stamped it out. \u201cBecause I want to talk to that person.\u201d</p><p>I believed him, and I had little doubt he had plans to do more than talk.</p><p>I offered a quick hello to Cady, who looked up from her desk outside Blake\u2019s office. Her hair was a bright shade of pink today.</p><p>\u201cYou can go right in.\u201d She motioned toward the door though it went without saying that I could, and I would, whether Blake liked it or not.</p> <p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I said, and entered.</p><p>Blake spun in his chair when I shut the door behind me.</p><p>He smiled, and my heart melted a little. So much had happened since I saw him a few hours ago, and there was no one I wanted to see more.</p><p>I walked toward him, and he rose to meet me. He pulled me to him and pressed a kiss to my forehead. I leaned in, welcoming the relief of being in his arms, even if my relief might be short-lived after we started talking. He tipped my chin up. His eyebrows drew together.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re upset.\u201d</p><p>I sighed, exhaling the relief in the same breath.</p><p>\u201cI saw Daniel today. I went to the police station to give my statement, and he was there. He\u2019d been talking to the same detectives who interviewed me last month.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he say something to you?\u201d</p><p>He guided me to the couch on the other side of the room. He sat down beside me, his worried look demanding I tell him everything. I was prepared to tell Blake the truth, but I wasn\u2019t sure if I was entirely prepared to hear it. I was giving him more control than I ever had, but he had no right to release this information, no matter how much he hated Daniel.</p><p>\u201cThe police know that Daniel is my father. Someone tipped them off. Did you tell them? Please just be honest and tell me if you did.\u201d</p><p>Blake\u2019s frown deepened. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>I looked into his eyes, studying his expression for any signs that he might be lying.</p><p>He flinched slightly. \u201cErica, have I ever lied to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I admitted finally, sliding back into the smooth leather of the couch. I realized suddenly that learning Blake had done it would have be easier to accept than grasping at the unknown. It was a miracle I could sleep at night for all the people who\u2019d made it their life\u2019s mission to tear one of us down.</p><p>\u201cDid Daniel threaten you again?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, thank God. You\u2019re his number one suspect though. Obviously, I assured him you wouldn\u2019t do this, but he doesn\u2019t take much stock in the promises you\u2019ve made to me. He\u2019s pissed, and he can\u2019t wait to get his hands on whoever gave the police this information. He says if it\u2019s not you, you should find out who it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if it was an anonymous tip? How the hell am I supposed to trace that? Tell Daniel to fuck off and do his own research.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlake.\u201d I glared at him.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is serious. The police know, and I\u2019m pretty sure they\u2019ll want to talk to me again soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should have told them the truth when you had the chance. Now you have to keep up with the lie and risk obstruction of justice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to see Daniel behind bars.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He cursed, his expression suddenly tight. \u201cErica, you\u2019re maddening sometimes, you know that? The man hit you and threatened to kill me. God knows what else he\u2019s done that warrants a lifetime behind bars.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s my father, Blake. I\u2019m sorry I don\u2019t have a picture perfect family like yours. My mother\u2019s dead and my stepfather started over without me. Unfortunately, Daniel\u2019s the only parent I\u2019ve got. I\u2019d rather not live the rest of my life with the knowledge that I put him behind bars for killing the man who nearly destroyed my life.\u201d</p><p>He shoved a hand through his hair, a gesture that always betrayed his growing frustration, usually with me.</p><p>\u201cSo what now?\u201d</p> <p>I sighed. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Before, I was just a girl Mark was hitting on the night he died. Now I\u2019m officially his stepsister and the illegitimate daughter of a powerful man with a multi-million dollar campaign on the line. The discovery is bound to raise eyebrows. They\u2019ll have more questions without a doubt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou definitely told the police that Mark was coming on to you that night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven if I hadn\u2019t, it was obvious in the photos. They had a whole series of shots of us dancing. Him...talking in my ear.\u201d I shuddered, the memory creeping over my skin.</p><p>Blake stared off in silence a few moments.</p><p>\u201cWhy would there be so many photos you that night? There were hundreds of people at that event, and I don\u2019t remember seeing a ton of press there. You were stunning, obviously. I can\u2019t deny that you would have caught anyone\u2019s eye that night. But doesn\u2019t that strike you as uncanny?\u201d</p> <p>I couldn\u2019t disagree, but I couldn\u2019t come up with another answer that made sense. I\u2019d never really thought about the unlucky existence of the photos when the detectives came to the apartment last month asking questions about Mark. I was too nervous about protecting Daniel and sounding natural doing it. But what luck to have so many shots of a man the night he died? Of all the people there, the who\u2019s who of the city, that someone would take an interest in us, in me...</p><p>Then it struck me.</p><p>\u201cOh my God.\u201d My hand went to my mouth.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>My stomach fell, and I thought I might be sick.</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d I whispered, shaking my head in disbelief.</p> <p>\u201cErica. Talk to me,\u201d he pressed, pulling my hand away and slipping it into his palm.</p><p>\u201cRichard.\u201d I looked up. \u201cRichard was covering the event that night with a photojournalist. And he knew I was going to be there. I remember, Marie told him to look for me.\u201d</p><p>Blake and I shared a knowing look.</p><p>\u201cWhat else has she told him?\u201d</p>  </body></html>"]
