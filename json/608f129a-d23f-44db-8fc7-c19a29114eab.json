But knocking the man senseless turned out to be a real deal breaker.</p><p>The CEO of one of the largest investment firms in the country, Eric Jorguson, was now being questioned by an FBI agent. He wasn\u2019t cooperating. The agent had taken Jorguson to the opposite side of the terrace and was trying to get him to calm down and answer his questions. Jorguson was busy screaming at Olivia, threatening to have her killed and also sue her because she\u2019d broken his jaw. She hadn\u2019t done any such thing, of course. The man was exaggerating. She\u2019d smashed his nose in, not his jaw. A waiter wearing the name tag TERRY pinned to his black vest stood next to her trying to soothe what he referred to as her extreme case of nerves. She wanted to punch him, too.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re in shock,\u201d he told her. \u201cThat\u2019s why you look so calm. The guy tears your dress and gropes you, and it\u2019s only natural for you to go into shock. Don\u2019t you think? That\u2019s why you\u2019re not crying and carrying on.\u201d</p> <p>Olivia looked at him. \u201cI\u2019m fine, really.\u201d Now please leave me alone, she silently added.</p><p>\u201cHey, look,\u201d Terry said. \u201cThey\u2019re arresting Jorguson\u2019s bodyguard. What\u2019s the guy doing with a bodyguard, I wonder.\u201d A few seconds later he answered his own question. \u201cHe must need one. Especially if he attacks other women the way he attacked you. You think you\u2019d like to go out with me sometime?\u201d</p><p>She smiled to ease the rejection. \u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still in shock, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Olivia was angry, not hysterical. She stood by the table with her arms folded across her waist as she patiently waited for the FBI agent to get to her. She had been told it wouldn\u2019t take long.</p> <p>Terry tried twice more to engage her in conversation. She was polite but firm each time he attempted to get personal.</p><p>She watched the agents while she tried to figure out how she had gotten into this bizarre situation. Job hunting wasn\u2019t supposed to be dangerous. She had already interviewed with three other Fortune 500 companies without incident. Before she had gone to those interviews, however, she had done quite a bit of research. She didn\u2019t have that luxury with Jorguson Investments. Because the position had just become available, she\u2019d had less than a day to study the company\u2019s prospectus. She should have looked more closely before she agreed to the preliminary interview. Should have, could have, she lamented.</p><p>She hated job hunting and all the inane interviews, especially since she really liked her current job and the people she worked with. But there was talk of cutbacks. Serious talk, and according to some of the other employees, Olivia didn\u2019t have seniority. She would be one of the first laid off. It was important to her that she stay in her current job until she accomplished what she had set out to do, but it didn\u2019t look like that was going to happen. The only constant in Olivia\u2019s life right now was the mortgage. It had to be paid, no matter what, which was why she had to have job options.</p><p>She had gone to the office an hour earlier than usual this morning, finished two case files by noon, and headed over to Seraphina, a lovely restaurant with a stunning view. The five-star restaurant overlooked a manicured terrace, with tables strategically placed under a canopy of tree branches. Beyond was the river. Lunch was going to be a treat. She\u2019d never dined at Seraphina because of the expense, but she\u2019d heard that the food was wonderful. Grossly overpriced, but wonderful. No peanut butter and jelly sandwich today.</p><p>The hostess showed her to a table on the south side of the terrace. It was such a beautiful day with just a slight nip in the air, perfect for lunch outside.</p><p>The preliminary interview with Xavier Cannon, the company\u2019s lead attorney, had gone well, she thought, but he hadn\u2019t answered some of her more pressing questions and had suggested instead that she ask Jorguson. Cannon also mentioned that, if Jorguson liked her, he would offer her the job during lunch.</p> <p>Jorguson was waiting for her. She spotted him across the busy terrace. He held an open folder in his hand and was reading a paper inside it. As she drew closer she could see that it was her r\u00e9sum\u00e9.</p><p>For about twenty seconds she thought he was quite a charmer and a rather distinguished-looking man. He was tall and thin and had a bright, white smile.</p><p>He stood and shook her hand. \u201cBring the lady a drink,\u201d he snapped impatiently to a passing waiter.</p><p>\u201cIced tea, please,\u201d she said.</p><p>The waiter had already moved her chair for her, and she sat before Jorguson could come around the table to assist her.</p><p>Jorguson\u2019s cell phone rang, and without offering an apology or an excuse for the interruption, he turned his back to her and answered. His voice was low and angry. Whoever he was talking to was getting a dressing-down. His vocabulary was crude.</p><p>So much for charming, she thought. She tried to focus on her surroundings while she waited. The linen tablecloth draped all the way to the ground, and in the center of the round table was a crystal bowl of fresh-cut flowers in every color. She looked around her and smiled. It was a really pretty day.</p><p>Jorguson finished his call. He slipped the phone into his suit jacket and gave her his full attention, but the way he was staring at her quickly made her uncomfortable. She was about to ask him if something was wrong when he said, \u201cYou\u2019re stunning. Absolutely stunning.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re very beautiful,\u201d he said then. \u201cXavier mentioned how pretty you were, but I still didn\u2019t expect . . . that is to say, I wasn\u2019t prepared . . .\u201d</p><p>Olivia was horrified by his close scrutiny. His leering inspection made her skin crawl. Jorguson wasn\u2019t just unprofessional; he was also creepy. She opened her linen napkin and placed it in her lap. She tried to turn his attention so he would stop gawking at her.</p><p>Typically she would have waited for him to lead the questioning, but the awkward silence and his inappropriate behavior compelled her to speak first.</p><p>\u201cThis morning I had a few minutes, and I pulled up your prospectus. Your company is quite impressive,\u201d she said. \u201cBut there was a note that last year you were investigated by the FBI\u2014\u201d</p><p>He rudely cut her off with a wave of his hand. \u201cYes, but of course nothing came of it. It was simple harassment.\u201d He continued, \u201cThey didn\u2019t like some of my clients and wanted to make trouble, which was ridiculous. I should have sued, but I didn\u2019t have the time.\u201d</p><p>Sue the FBI? Was he serious or just trying to impress her with his power. His arrogance was overwhelming.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a brand-new attorney, aren\u2019t you?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s correct.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly two people ranked higher than you on the bar. I cannot tell you how remarkable that is. Still, you don\u2019t have much experience with contracts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t,\u201d she agreed. \u201cHow did you find out about my scores? That\u2019s confidential\u2014\u201d</p><p>He waved his hand in the air again, dismissing her question. The gesture irritated her. She admitted then that pretty much everything about the man irritated her.</p><p>\u201cThere were quite a few others who applied for the position, and most of them have more experience than you, but when I discovered you were Robert MacKenzie\u2019s daughter, I moved you to the top of the list.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know my father?\u201d She couldn\u2019t hide her surprise.</p><p>\u201cEveryone who\u2019s anyone knows who your father is,\u201d he replied. \u201cI know people who have invested in your father\u2019s Trinity Fund and have made a handsome profit. Very impressive,\u201d he stated with a nod. \u201cI\u2019m considering adding the fund to my own portfolio. No one plays the market like your father does. He seems to have a knack for choosing the right investments. If you\u2019re half as clever as he is, you\u2019ll go far, young lady.\u201d</p><p>Olivia wasn\u2019t given time to respond. He\u2019d already moved on. \u201cYou\u2019ll be wonderful working with our clients. With that smile of yours, you could get them to sign anything. Oh yes, they\u2019ll be as dazzled by you as I am,\u201d he gushed. \u201cAnd I have several powerful clients. Xavier will guide you. Now then, what questions do you have for me? I have a potential client meeting me here at one, so this will have to be a quick lunch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid the SEC investigate when\u2014\u201d</p><p>He interrupted. \u201cNo, the SEC will never investigate me,\u201d he boasted. \u201cI\u2019m protected there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re protected? How?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a friend, and he has assured me . . .\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened. \u201cYou have a friend at the Securities and Exchange Commission?\u201d</p><p>Color crept up his neck. His eyes darted to the left, then to the right. Was he checking to make sure no one was listening to the conversation?</p><p>He leaned into the table and lowered his voice. \u201cI don\u2019t have any worries there. As I just said, I won\u2019t be investigated, and since you\u2019re going to be working closely with me, I don\u2019t want you to be concerned.\u201d</p><p>Working closely with him? That thought made her cringe.</p><p>\u201cAbout this friend . . .\u201d she began.</p><p>\u201cNo more questions about the SEC,\u201d he snapped. He wasn\u2019t looking into her eyes now. He was staring at her chest. The longer he stared, the more indignant she became. She considered snapping her fingers several times in front of his eyes to get his attention but, wanting to remain composed and professional, decided to ask a question about the investments he\u2019d made.</p><p>Jorguson was slick; she\u2019d give him that much. He danced around each question but never really gave her any satisfactory answers.</p><p>The topic eventually returned to the SEC. \u201cWho is your contact?\u201d she asked, wondering if he would tell her. He was so smug and arrogant, she thought there was a good chance he might. She also wanted him to assure her that everything he did was legal, and she thought it was odd that he hadn\u2019t offered any such affirmation.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you want to know? That\u2019s confidential information.\u201d</p><p>He was staring at her chest again. She folded her napkin, smiled at Terry the waiter when he placed her iced tea in front of her, and handed him her menu.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t be staying for lunch.\u201d</p><p>The waiter hesitated, then took her menu, glanced at Jorguson, and walked away.</p><p>Olivia was disheartened. The salary at Jorguson Investments was good, really good, but it had taken less than five minutes to know she couldn\u2019t work for this man.</p><p>What a waste of time, she thought. And money. She could have worn one of her old suits, but she\u2019d wanted to stand out, so she bought a new dress. It was expensive, too. She loved the fit and the color, a deep emerald green silk. It had a high V-neck, so there was no need to wear a necklace. Diamond stud earrings, which were so tiny you could barely see the sparkle, and a watch were her only jewelry. She wore her hair down around her shoulders and had taken the time to use a curling iron.</p><p>Olivia looked at Jorguson. The degenerate was still staring at her chest. And for this she had curled her hair?</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t going to work,\u201d she said.</p><p>She tried to stand. Jorguson suddenly bolted upright, grabbed the top of her dress, and ripped it apart. The silk material tore, exposing her collarbone and part of her black bra.</p><p>Appalled, she slapped Jorguson\u2019s hands away. \u201cWhat do you think\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you wearing a wire? You are, aren\u2019t you? That\u2019s why you asked me who my contact was. That investigation stalled, sweetheart. It\u2019s not going anywhere. The FBI\u2019s been after me for two years now, and they\u2019ve got nothing. I know for a fact they\u2019re following me. They won\u2019t ever get anything on me. They like to go after successful entrepreneurs. I\u2019m an honest businessman,\u201d he shouted into her chest. \u201cNow where\u2019s the damn wire? I know it\u2019s in there somewhere.\u201d</p><p>Olivia was so shocked by his behavior, she bounced between disbelief and outrage. She shoved his hands away, pulled her top together, and said, \u201cIf you try to touch me again, you\u2019ll regret it.\u201d</p><p>He tried again, and she retaliated. She heard a crunching sound when she punched him and felt a good deal of satisfaction. It was short-lived. A giant of a man with a thick neck and bald head appeared out of nowhere. He was wearing a tailored black suit, but he looked like a thug. He was at the other end of the terrace and heading toward her. As Jorguson was screaming and holding his nose with one hand, he was waving to the big man and pointing at Olivia with the other.</p><p>\u201cMartin, see what she did to me?\u201d he howled. \u201cGet her, get her.\u201d</p><p>Get her? Was he twelve? Olivia could feel her face turning red. She kept her attention centered on the bodyguard as she jumped to her feet. His suit jacket opened, and she saw a gun. He hadn\u2019t reached for it, though, and was glancing around to see how many people were watching.</p><p>She was in trouble, all right. She thought about taking off one of her stiletto heels and using that as a weapon, but she decided she could do more damage with it on. She spied Terry watching from the doorway with a cell phone to his ear. She hoped he was calling the police.</p><p>\u201cDo you have a permit to carry that gun?\u201d she demanded of the bodyguard, trying to make her voice sound as mean as possible. Now, why, in God\u2019s name, had she asked that? What did she care if he had a permit or not? She was slowly slipping her hand inside her purse to get to her pepper spray. She couldn\u2019t find it and realized then that, when she\u2019d changed purses, she\u2019d left the spray at home on her bedside table. A lot of good it would do her there.</p><p>The thug named Martin, zigzagging around the tables, was getting closer. The man was built like a sumo wrestler. Olivia figured she was on her own. The other diners were already beginning to scatter. She stepped back from the table, dropped her purse into the chair, and waited for the man to reach her. If he touched her, she\u2019d kick him where it mattered most, and if he blocked her, she\u2019d go for his knee or his midsection.</p><p>Jorguson, holding his bloody nose, was backing away but still pointing at her and shouting. \u201cHow dare you touch me. You\u2019re going to be sorry. I know people who will hurt you. You don\u2019t hit me and get away with it. Don\u2019t you know who I am and what I can do? One phone call is all it will take,\u201d he screamed. \u201cYou\u2019re a dead woman, Olivia MacKenzie. Do you hear me? A dead woman.\u201d</p><p>Of course she\u2019d heard him. She thought everyone within a ten-block area had heard him. She refused to give him any satisfaction by reacting, though, and that was probably why he was becoming more outrageous with his threats.</p><p>Her attention remained centered on the bodyguard. She thought he would do his best to intimidate her in front of his employer, maybe even try to get her to apologize to Jorguson\u2014hell would freeze before she\u2019d do that\u2014but he surely wouldn\u2019t touch her. Not in front of all these people. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Or maybe he wouldn\u2019t care who was watching. Jorguson had shouted his intent to have her killed. Would this bodyguard try to top that crazy threat?</p><p>There was a wall of windows in the restaurant facing the river, and diners were crammed together, their faces plastered to the glass. Some had their cell phones glued to their ears; others were using the cell phone cameras to record the incident . . . for YouTube, no doubt. Certainly, most of them had witnessed Jorguson ripping her dress and then screaming after she\u2019d punched him. The man had howled like an outraged hyena. Surely they\u2019d heard his ridiculous threats, too.</p><p>The bodyguard took Jorguson\u2019s orders to \u201cget her\u201d to heart. He lunged. He grabbed her upper arm and twisted as he jerked her toward him. Pain shot up into her neck and down to her fingers. His grip was strong enough to break her bone.</p><p>He glanced over his shoulder at the crowd before turning back to her. \u201cYou\u2019re coming with me,\u201d he ordered.</p> <p>A woman rushed out of the restaurant shouting, \u201cYou leave her alone.\u201d At the same time, two men in business suits ran past the woman to help Olivia.</p><p>\u201cLet go of me,\u201d she demanded as she slammed the heel of her shoe into the top of his foot.</p><p>He grunted and let go. Olivia got in a solid kick, and he doubled over. But not for long. He quickly recovered and, roaring several grossly unflattering names at her, straightened and reached for his gun. His face was now bloodred.</p><p>Good Lord, was he going to shoot her? The look in his eyes suggested that he might. Apparently, Martin had forgotten his audience, or he no longer cared he was being watched. His impulse control had vanished. He had the most hateful look on his face as he pulled the gun from the waistband of his pants. The two businessmen coming to her aid stopped when they spotted the weapon.</p><p>\u201cI said you\u2019re coming with me,\u201d he snarled as he lunged.</p> <p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not.\u201d She threw a twelve-dollar glass of iced tea at him. He ducked.</p><p>\u201cBitch.\u201d He spit the word and tried to grab her again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere with you. Now get away from me.\u201d</p><p>The gun seemed to be growing in his hand. She backed away from him, and that infuriated him even more. He came at her again, and before she could protect herself, he backhanded her. He struck the side of her face, his knuckles clipping her jaw. It was a hard hit and hurt like hell. The blow threw her backward, but even as she was falling, she didn\u2019t take her eyes off the gun.</p><p>She landed on her backside, winced from the impact on her tailbone, and quickly staggered to her feet.</p><p>She understood what the expression \u201cseeing stars\u201d meant. Dazed, she tried to back away.</p> <p>The thug raised his gun again, and suddenly he was gone. Olivia saw a blur fly past her, tackling the bodyguard to the ground. The gun went one way, and the thug went the other, landing hard. Within seconds her rescuer had the man facedown on the grass and was putting handcuffs on him while reading him his rights. When he was finished, he motioned to another man wearing a badge and gun who was rushing across the terrace.</p><p>With one of his knees pressed against the bodyguard\u2019s spine, the rescuer turned toward her. She suddenly felt lightheaded. She could have sworn she saw an ethereal glow radiating all around him and the sound of a singing choir echoing overhead. She closed her eyes and shook her head. The blow to her jaw must be making her hallucinate. When she opened her eyes again, the vision and the choir were gone, but the man was still there, looking up at her with beautiful hazel eyes.</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d he asked as he hauled the bodyguard to his feet.</p><p>\u201cOlivia MacKenzie,\u201d she answered. She sounded bewildered, but she couldn\u2019t help that. The last few minutes had been hair-raising, and she was having trouble forming a clear thought.</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cAgent Grayson Kincaid. FBI. Are you all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should sit down.\u201d</p> <p>The bodyguard finally found his voice. \u201cI was protecting my boss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith a Glock?\u201d Kincaid asked. \u201cAnd against an unarmed woman?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe kicked me.\u201d</p><p>A hint of a smile turned his expression. \u201cYeah, I saw.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m bringing charges.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou attacked her,\u201d Kincaid snapped. \u201cIf I were you, I\u2019d be real quiet right now.\u201d</p><p>The bodyguard ignored the suggestion. \u201cMr. Jorguson has known for a long time that the FBI has been tailing him and listening in on his private conversations. What you\u2019re doing is illegal, but you people don\u2019t play by the rules, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop talking,\u201d Kincaid said.</p><p>Another agent grabbed hold of the bodyguard\u2019s arm and led him away. He didn\u2019t go peacefully. He was shouting for a lawyer.</p><p>\u201cHey, Ronan,\u201d Kincaid shouted.</p><p>The agent dragging the bodyguard away turned back. \u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you see it?\u201d</p><p>Ronan smiled. \u201cOh yeah, I saw it all. After I put this clown in the back of the car, I\u2019ll go get Jorguson.\u201d</p><p>Olivia glanced around the terrace. In all the commotion she hadn\u2019t seen him slip away.</p><p>Kincaid nodded, then turned back to her.</p><p>\u201cThe gun is under the table,\u201d she offered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get it,\u201d Kincaid said.</p><p>He walked over to her, and she flinched when he reached out to touch her. Frowning, he said, \u201cI\u2019m not going to hurt you. I just want to see how bad it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d she insisted. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>He ignored her protest. He gently pushed her hair away from the side of her face. \u201cYour cheek\u2019s okay, but he really clipped your jaw. It\u2019s already starting to swell. You need to put ice on it. Maybe I should take you to the emergency room, have a physician look at your arm, too. I saw the way he twisted it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be all right. I\u2019ll ice it,\u201d she promised when he looked like he wanted to argue.</p><p>He took a step back and said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry I couldn\u2019t get to him faster.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got here before he shot me. He really was going to shoot me, wasn\u2019t he?\u201d She was still astounded by the possibility and getting madder by the second.</p><p>\u201cHe might have tried,\u201d he agreed.</p><p>She frowned. \u201cYou\u2019re awfully nonchalant about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would have taken him down before he shot you.\u201d</p><p>Her cell phone rang. She checked the number, then sent the call to voice mail. Out of the corner of her eye, she saw a man rounding the corner of the building and glaring at her. He stormed toward her, just as Kincaid bent to retrieve the bodyguard\u2019s gun.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell\u2019s the matter with you?\u201d the man shouted.</p><p>Since he was wearing a gun and badge, she knew he was also FBI. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou ruined a perfectly good sting. Were you wearing a wire? Did you get anything we could use? No, I didn\u2019t think so. You weren\u2019t supposed to be here until one. We weren\u2019t ready.\u201d</p><p>The agent screaming at her was an older man, late fifties, she guessed. His face was bright red, and his anger could light fires.</p><p>He moved closer until he was all but touching her, but she refused to be intimidated. \u201cStop yelling at me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not with the FBI,\u201d Kincaid said.</p><p>\u201cHow . . .\u201d The confused agent took a step back. He looked at Olivia, then at Kincaid.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d know if she was. Your undercover woman hasn\u2019t shown up yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo months\u2019 planning,\u201d the agent muttered. He pointed at Olivia. \u201cAre you wearing a wire? Jorguson seems to think you are. Are you with a newspaper or\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoole, leave her the hell alone,\u201d Kincaid said.</p><p>Poole was staring at her chest. Uh-oh.

Literally. She\u2019d waited until he took his helmet off. Then she\u2019d swung the narrow strip of leather in a circle high above her head. The small stone nestled in the center of her makeshift sling had gathered speed until it wasn\u2019t visible to the na*ed eye. The sound as the leather sliced through the air was like that of a disgruntled beast, half snarl, half whistle. Her prey had been too far away to hear the noise, though, for she stood in the frigid morning shadows of the walkway at the top of the wall, and he stood down below, nearly fifty feet away by her measure, at the base of the wooden drawbridge.</p><p>The giant Norman had made an easy target. The fact that he was also the leader of the infidels who were out to steal her family\u2019s holding had sweetened her concentration, too. In her mind, the giant had become Goliath.</p><p>And she was his David.</p><p>But unlike the saintly hero of ancient stories, she hadn\u2019t meant to kill her adversary. She would have aimed for the side of his temple if that had been her goal. No, she had wanted only to stun him. For that reason, she\u2019d chosen his forehead. God willing, she\u2019d given him a mark to carry for the rest of his days, a reminder, she hoped, of the atrocity he\u2019d committed on this dark day of victory.</p><p>The Normans were winning this battle. In another hour or two they would breach the inner sanctuary.</p><p>It was inevitable, she knew. Her Saxon soldiers were hopelessly outnumbered now. Retreat was the only logical alternative. Yes, it was inevitable, but damn galling, too.</p><p>This Norman giant was the fourth challenger the bastard William of Normandy had sent to take her holding in the past three weeks.</p><p>The first three had fought like boys. She and her brother\u2019s men had easily chased them away.</p><p>This one was different. He wouldn\u2019t be chased. It had soon became apparent that he was more seasoned than his predecessors. He was certainly more cunning. The soldiers under his command were as inexperienced as the ones who\u2019d come before, but this newest leader kept them well disciplined and at their task hour after relentless hour.</p><p>Victory would go to the hated Normans by the end of the day.</p><p>Their leader would be dizzy with his success, however. She would see to it.</p><p>She had smiled when she dispatched her stone.</p><p>Baron Royce had left his mount to pull one of his soldiers out of the moat surrounding the holding. The foolish soldier had lost his footing and fallen head first into the deep water. Because of his heavy armor, he couldn\u2019t catch his balance and was sinking to the bottom. Royce reached down with one hand, caught hold of a booted foot, and lifted the young soldier out of the murky depths. With a flick of his wrist, he tossed the vassal onto the grassy bank. The racking coughs coming from the lad had told Royce he didn\u2019t need further assistance. The boy was still breathing. Royce had paused to remove his own helmet, and was just wiping the sweat from his brow when the stone had found its mark. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Royce was thrown backwards. He landed a fair distance away from his stallion. He didn\u2019t sleep long. Dust still clouded the air around him when he opened his eyes. His soldiers were running toward him to offer assistance.</p><p>He declined their help. He sat up, shook his head in an attempt to rid himself of the pain and fog that confused him. For a minute or two, he couldn\u2019t even remember where the hell he was. Blood trickled from a cut high on his forehead, above his right eye. He prodded around the edges of the injury and only then realized a fair chunk of flesh had been torn away.</p><p>He still didn\u2019t understand what had hit him. From the size of the jagged wound, he knew an arrow couldn\u2019t have done the damage. But damn it all, his head seemed to be on fire.</p><p>Royce pushed his pain aside and concentrated on standing up. Fury came to his aid. By God, he would find the bastard who\u2019d done this to him and give him equal measure.</p> <p>That thought cheered him considerably.</p><p>His squire stood holding the reins of his mount. Royce swung himself up into the saddle and turned his attention to the top of the wall that surrounded the holding. Had his enemy aimed at him from that spot? The distance was too great for him to see even a glimpse of a threat.</p><p>He put his helmet back on.</p><p>Looking around, he saw that in the ten or fifteen minutes that had passed since he\u2019d taken the blow, his soldiers had seemingly forgotten everything he\u2019d taught them.</p><p>Ingelram, his temporary second-in-command, had the full contingent of men fighting in a unit near the south side of the fortress. Arrows rained down on them from the top of the wall, making advance impossible.</p> <p>Royce was appalled by their ineptness. The soldiers held their shields up above their heads to ward off the arrows, and they were fighting a defensive battle again. They were in the exact position he\u2019d found them in when he\u2019d joined them for this nuisance duty this morning.</p><p>Royce let out a long sigh, then took command again.</p><p>He immediately changed tactics to prevent them from losing the ground they\u2019d already secured. He pulled ten of his most reliable soldiers away from the wall and went with them to the small rise above the holding. With one of his own arrows he killed a Saxon soldier who was standing on top of the wall before his men had even had time to secure their own sightings. Then he allowed them to take over the task. In little time at all, the Saxon walls were once again unprotected.</p><p>Five of Royce\u2019s men climbed the walls and cut the ropes to the bridge, lowering it. God help him, he\u2019d actually had to remind one of the eager volunteers to take his sword with him.</p><p>Royce rode first across the wooden planks of the drawbridge, his sword drawn, though there really wasn\u2019t any need. Both the lower bailey and the upper one were completely deserted.</p><p>They made a thorough search of the huts and outer buildings and discovered not a single Saxon soldier. It became clear to Royce that the enemy had left their holding by a secret passage. Royce ordered half his men to search the walls for such an opening. He would seal it the minute they located it.</p> <p>The Normans secured the holding in William\u2019s name a few minutes later when they hoisted the duke of Normandy\u2019s banner, displaying his magnificent colors, onto the pole atop the wall. The castle now belonged to the Normans.</p><p>Yet Royce had completed only half of his duties. He still had to collect the prize and take her to London.</p><p>Aye, it was time to capture Lady Nicholaa.</p><p>A search of the living quarters of the keep produced a handful of servants, who were dragged outside and pushed into a tight circle in the courtyard.</p><p>Ingelram, as tall as Royce was, though he lacked the bulk and battle scars, held one Saxon servant by the back of his tunic. The servant was an elderly man with thin, graying hair and puckered skin.</p><p>Royce hadn\u2019t had time to dismount before Ingelram blurted out, \u201cThis one\u2019s the steward, Baron. His name\u2019s Hacon. He\u2019s the one who told Gregory all about the family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t talk to any Normans,\u201d Hacon protested. \u201cI don\u2019t even know anyone named Gregory. God strike me dead if that ain\u2019t the truth,\u201d he added boldly.</p><p>The \u201cfaithful\u201d servant was lying, and he was feeling quite proud of himself for possessing such courage in the face of dire circumstances. The old man still hadn\u2019t looked up at the Norman leader, though, but kept his attention on the overly eager blond knight who was trying to tear his tunic off his back.</p> <p>\u201cAye, you did talk to Gregory,\u201d Ingelram countered. \u201cHe was the first knight to take on the challenge of securing this holding and capturing the prize. It won\u2019t do you any good to lie, old man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe be the one who left with the arrow in his backside?\u201d Hacon asked.</p><p>Ingelram glared at the servant for mentioning Gregory\u2019s humiliation. He forced Hacon to turn around. The servant\u2019s breath caught in the back of his throat when he finally looked up at the Norman leader. He had to tilt his head all the way back in order to get a decent look at the giant, who was covered in leather and steel links. Hacon squinted against the streamers of sunlight that reflected off the armor and into his eyes. Neither the warrior nor his magnificent black stallion moved, and for a brief minute, the steward imagined that he was looking at a grand statue made of stone.</p><p>Hacon held on to his composure until the Norman removed his helmet.</p><p>He almost lost his supper then and there. The barbarian terrified him. Hacon felt sick with the need to cry out for mercy. The look in the Norman\u2019s cold gray eyes was frigid with determination, and Hacon was sure he was about to die. Yes, he\u2019ll kill me, Hacon thought. He said a quick Pater Noster. It would be an honorable death, he decided, because he was determined to help his gentle mistress until the very end. Surely God would welcome him to heaven for protecting an innocent.</p><p>Royce stared down at the trembling servant a long while. Then he tossed his helmet to his waiting squire, dismounted, and handed the reins to a soldier. The stallion reared up, but one hard command from his master stopped his budding tantrum.</p><p>Hacon\u2019s knees went limp. He fell to the ground. Ingelram reached down and hauled him back up to his feet. \u201cOne of the twins is inside the keep, abovestairs, Baron,\u201d Ingelram announced. \u201cShe prays in the chapel.\u201d</p><p>Hacon took a deep breath, then blurted out, \u201cThe church was burned to the ground when last we were under siege.\u201d His voice sounded like a strangled whisper. \u201cAs soon as Sister Danielle arrived from the abbey, she ordered the altar moved to one of the chambers inside the keep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDanielle\u2019s the nun,\u201d Ingelram volunteered. \u201cIt just as we heard, Baron. They\u2019re twins, they are. One\u2019s a saint, bent on serving the world, and the other\u2019s a sinner, bent on giving us trouble.\u201d</p><p>Royce still hadn\u2019t said a word. He continued to stare down at the servant. Hacon couldn\u2019t look up into the leader\u2019s eyes very long. He turned his gaze to the ground, clasped his hands together, and whispered, \u201cSister Danielle\u2019s been caught in this war betwixt the Saxons and the Normans. She\u2019s an innocent and wishes only to return to the abbey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want the other one.\u201d</p><p>The baron\u2019s voice was soft, chilling. Hacon\u2019s stomach lurched again.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s wanting the other twin,\u201d Ingelram shouted. He started to say more, then caught his baron\u2019s hard stare and decided to close his mouth instead.</p><p>\u201cThe other twin\u2019s name is Nicholaa,\u201d Hacon said. He took another deep breath before adding, \u201cShe left, Baron.\u201d</p><p>Royce didn\u2019t show any reaction to this news. Ingelram, on the other hand, couldn\u2019t contain his disappointment. \u201cHow could she have left?\u201d he demanded in another shout as he shoved the old man back to his knees.</p><p>\u201cThere are many secret passages built into the thick walls of the keep,\u201d Hacon confessed. \u201cDidn\u2019t you notice there weren\u2019t any Saxon soldiers here when you crossed over the drawbridge? Mistress Nicholaa left with her brother\u2019s men near to an hour past.\u201d</p><p>Ingelram bellowed in frustration. In a bid to ease his anger, he shoved the servant again.</p><p>Royce took a step forward, his stare directed at his vassal. \u201cYou do not show me your strength when you mistreat a defenseless old man, Ingelram, nor do you show me your ability to control your enthusiasm when you interfere with my questioning.\u201d</p><p>The vassal was properly humiliated. He bowed his head to his baron, then helped the Saxon to his feet.</p><p>Royce waited until the young soldier had taken a step away from the servant. He then looked at Hacon again. \u201cHow long have you served this household?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNear to twenty years now,\u201d Hacon answered. There was pride in his voice when he added, \u201cI\u2019ve always been treated fair, Baron. They made me feel as important as one of their own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYet after twenty years of fair treatment you betray your mistresses now?\u201d He shook his head in disgust. \u201cYou won\u2019t give me your pledge of loyalty, Hacon, for your word isn\u2019t trustworthy.\u201d</p><p>Royce didn\u2019t waste another minute on the steward. His stride was determined as he made his way to the doors of the keep. He pushed his eager men out of his path and went inside.</p><p>Hacon was motioned into the cluster of servants and left to worry about his fate when Ingelram rushed after his lord.</p><p>Royce was methodical in his search. The first floor of the keep was cluttered with rubble. Litter covered the old rushes. The long table near the far corner had been overturned, and most of the stools had been destroyed.</p><p>The staircase leading to the chambers abovestairs was still intact, though just barely. The wooden steps were slippery with water dripping down from the walls. It was a dangerously narrow climb. Most of the banister had been torn away and dangled over the side, and if a man lost his footing, there was nothing to prevent him from falling.</p><p>The landing on the second level was just as pitiful. Wind howled through a gaping man-sized hole in the center of the far wall. The air was bitter from the cold winter wind blowing in from outside. A long, dark corridor led away from the head of the stairs.</p><p>As soon as Royce reached the landing, Ingelram rushed ahead of him and awkwardly drew his sword. The vassal obviously meant to protect his lord. The floorboards were just as wet and slippery as the steps, however. Ingelram lost both his sword and his balance and went flying toward the gaping hole.</p><p>Royce caught him by the nape of the neck and sent him flying in the opposite direction. The vassal landed with a thud against the inside wall, shook himself like a wet dog to rid himself of the shivers, then picked up his sword and went chasing after his lord again.</p><p>Royce shook his head in exasperation at his inept vassal\u2019s puny attempt to protect him. He didn\u2019t bother to draw his own sword as he started down the hallway. When he reached the first chamber and found the door barred against him, he simply kicked it open, ducked under the low lintel, and went inside.</p><p>The room was a bedchamber in which six candles were burning. It was unoccupied save for a serving girl who cowered in a corner.</p><p>\u201cWho resides in this chamber?\u201d Royce demanded.</p><p>\u201cMistress Nicholaa,\u201d came the whispered reply.</p><p>Royce took his time studying the room. He was mildly surprised at how Spartan and orderly the chamber was. He didn\u2019t realize women could live without a clutter of possessions surrounding them. His experience was limited to his three sisters, of course, but that was quite enough to allow him to draw such a conclusion. Still, Lady Nicholaa\u2019s room didn\u2019t have a bit of clutter. A large bed stood against one wall, its burgundy draperies tied back. The hearth was on the opposite wall. A single low-fashioned chest made of fine, burnish red wood stood in a corner.</p><p>There wasn\u2019t a single article of clothing hanging from the hooks to give Royce any idea of the woman\u2019s size. He turned to leave the chamber, but found his path blocked by his vassal. A glare quickly removed the obstacle.</p><p>The second door was also barred from inside. Royce was about to kick it out of his way when he heard the sound of the latch being removed.</p><p>The door was opened by a young serving girl. Freckles and fear covered her face. She tried to curtsy to him but only half completed the formal greeting when she got a true look at his face. She let out a cry and went running across the large chamber.</p><p>The room was alight with candles. A wooden altar covered with a white cloth stood in front of the hearth. On the floor in front of the altar were several leather-padded kneelers.</p><p>He saw the nun at once. She was kneeling, her head bowed in prayer, her hands folded below the cross she wore on a thin leather thong around her neck.</p><p>She was dressed in white, from the long veil covering her hair to her white shoes. Royce stood inside the doorway and waited for her to acknowledge him. Because there was no chalice on the altar, he didn\u2019t genuflect.</p><p>The serving girl timidly touched the nun\u2019s slender shoulder, bent down, and whispered in her ear. \u201cSister Danielle, the Norman leader has arrived. Do we surrender now?\u201d</p><p>That question seemed so ridiculous that Royce almost smiled. He motioned to Ingelram to replace his sword, then walked farther into the room. Two servants stood together near the fur-covered window across the room. One held a baby in her arms. The infant was diligently chewing on his fists.</p><p>Royce\u2019s attention returned to the nun. He could only see her profile from his position. She finally made the sign of the cross, a signal her prayers were finished, then gracefully gained her feet. As soon as she stood up, the baby let out a lusty cry and reached out to her.</p><p>The nun motioned the dark-haired servant forward and took the baby into her arms. She kissed the top of his head and turned to walk toward Royce.</p><p>He still hadn\u2019t gotten a good look at her face because she kept her head bowed, but he found himself pleasantly affected by her gentle manners and her whisper-soft voice as she crooned to the baby. The infant\u2019s head was covered with a sprinkling of white-blond hair that literally stood up on end, giving him a comical look. The baby cuddled contentedly against the nun and continued to suckle on his fists. He made loud, slurping sounds, interrupted only by an occasional yawn.</p><p>Danielle stopped when she was just a foot or two away from Royce. The top of her head only reached his shoulders, and he was thinking to himself how very fragile and vulnerable she appeared to be.</p><p>Then she lifted her gaze and stared into his eyes, and he couldn\u2019t seem to think at all.</p><p>She was exquisite. God\u2019s truth, she had the face of an angel. Her skin was flawless. Her eyes fascinated him. They were the most appealing shade of blue. Royce imagined that he was looking at a goddess who\u2019d come to earth just to tantalize him. Her light brown eyebrows were perfectly sculptured into soft arches, her nose was wonderfully straight, and her mouth was full, rosy, and damned appealing. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Royce found himself physically reacting to the woman and was immediately disgusted with himself. His sudden lack of discipline was appalling to him. The indrawn breath he heard told him Ingelram was experiencing the same reaction to the beautiful woman. Royce turned to glare at his vassal before looking at the nun again.</p><p>Danielle was a bride of the sacred church, for God\u2019s sake, and not booty to be lusted after. Like his overlord, William of Normandy, Royce honored the church and protected the clergy whenever possible.</p><p>He let out a long sigh. \u201cWho does this child belong to?\u201d he asked in an attempt to regain his unholy thoughts about the woman.</p><p>\u201cThe baby belongs to Clarise,\u201d she answered in a husky voice he found incredibly arousing. She motioned to the dark-haired servant in the shadows. The woman immediately took a step forward. \u201cClarise has been a faithful servant for many years. Her son\u2019s name is Ulric.\u201d</p> <p>She looked down at the infant and saw that he was gnawing on her cross. She removed it before looking back up at Royce.</p><p>They stared at each other a long silent minute. She began to rub Ulric\u2019s shoulders in a circular motion, but kept her gaze fully directed on Royce.</p><p>She showed absolutely no fear in her expression, and she\u2019d given the long sickle-shaped scar on his cheek little notice. Royce was a bit unsettled by that\u2014he was used to quite a different reaction when women first saw his face. The disfigurement didn\u2019t seem to bother the nun, though. That pleased him considerably.</p><p>\u201cUlric\u2019s eyes are the same color as yours,\u201d Royce remarked.</p><p>That wasn\u2019t exactly true, he realized. The baby\u2019s eyes were a pretty blue. Danielle\u2019s were beautiful.</p> <p>\u201cMany Saxons have blue eyes,\u201d she replied. \u201cUlric will be eight months old in less than a week. Will he live that long, Norman?\u201d</p><p>Because she asked the question in such a gentle, undemanding voice, Royce didn\u2019t take offense. \u201cWe Normans don\u2019t kill innocent children,\u201d he replied.</p><p>She nodded, then honored him with a smile. His heart started pounding in reaction. She had an enchanting dimple in her cheek, and, Lord, how her eyes could bewitch him. They weren\u2019t blue, he decided. They were violet, the identical shade of the fragile flower he\u2019d once seen.</p><p>He really needed to get hold of his thoughts, he told himself. He was acting like a besotted squire. He was feeling just as awkward, too.</p><p>Royce was too old for such feelings. \u201cHow is it you\u2019ve learned to speak our language so well?\u201d he asked. His voice had gone hoarse.</p><p>She didn\u2019t seem to notice. \u201cOne of my brothers went with Harold, our Saxon king, to Normandy six years ago,\u201d she answered. \u201cWhen he returned, he insisted we all conquer this language.\u201d</p> <p>Ingelram moved to stand next to his baron. \u201cDoes your twin sister look like you?\u201d he blurted out.</p><p>The nun turned to look at the soldier. She seemed to be taking his measure. Her stare was intense, unwavering. Ingelram, Royce noticed, turned bright red under her close scrutiny and couldn\u2019t hold her gaze long.</p><p>\u201cNicholaa and I are very much alike in appearance,\u201d she finally answered. \u201cMost people cannot tell us apart. Our dispositions, however, are vastly different. I\u2019ve an accepting nature, but my sister certainly doesn\u2019t. She has vowed to die before surrendering to England\u2019s invaders. Nicholaa believes it\u2019s only a matter of time before you Normans give up and go back home. \u2019Tis the truth, I fear for my sister\u2019s safety.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know where Lady Nicholaa went?\u201d Ingelram asked. \u201cMy baron has need to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she answered. She kept her gaze on the vassal. \u201cIf your baron will give me his assurance that no harm will come to my sister, I\u2019ll tell you her destination.\u201d</p><p>Ingelram let out a loud snort. \u201cWe Normans don\u2019t kill women. We tame them.\u201d</p><p>Royce felt like tossing his vassal out the doorway when he heard that arrogant boast. He noticed the nun didn\u2019t much care for the remark, either. Her expression turned mutinous, though only for a fleeting second. The flash of anger was quickly gone, too, replaced by a look of serenity.</p><p>His guard was suddenly up, and though he couldn\u2019t give a reason for his suspicions, he knew something was amiss.</p> <p>\u201cNo harm will come to your sister,\u201d Royce said.</p><p>She looked relieved. Royce decided then her anger had been a reaction to her fear for her sister.</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d Ingelram interjected with great enthusiasm. \u201cNicholaa is the king\u2019s prize.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe king\u2019s prize?\u201d</p><p>She was having difficulty hiding her anger now. Her face became flushed. Her voice, however, remained calm. \u201cI don\u2019t understand what you mean. King Harold is dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour Saxon king is dead,\u201d Ingelram explained, \u201cbut duke William of Normandy is on his way to London even now and will soon be anointed king of all England. We have orders to take Nicholaa to London as soon as possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what purpose?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYour sister is the king\u2019s prize. He intends to award her to a noble knight.\u201d Ingelram\u2019s voice was filled with pride when he added, \u201cThat is an honor.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cYou\u2019ve still to explain why my sister is to become the king\u2019s prize,\u201d she whispered. \u201cHow would your William even know about Nicholaa?\u201d</p><p>Royce wasn\u2019t about to let Ingelram enlighten the nun. The truth would only upset the gentlewoman. He shoved his vassal toward the doorway. \u201cYou have my word no harm will come to your sister,\u201d he promised Danielle again. \u201cNow tell me her destination. You have no understanding of the dangers outside these walls. It\u2019s only a matter of time before she\u2019s captured, and there are, unfortunately, a few Normans who won\u2019t treat her kindly.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d softened the truth for the innocent woman, of course. He saw no reason to explain in detail the atrocities her twin would be subjected to if she was caught by ill-disciplined soldiers. He wanted to protect the nun from the harsh realities of life, to shelter her innocence from worldly sins, but if she refused to give him the information he needed, he would have to be more blunt with her.</p><p>\u201cWill you give me your word you\u2019ll go after Nicholaa yourself? You won\u2019t give the duty to someone else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s important to you that I go?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll give you my word,\u201d he said. \u201cAlthough I wonder why it matters to you if I go or send someone\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe you\u2019ll act with honor toward my sister,\u201d she interrupted. \u201cYou have already given me your word no harm will come to Nicholaa.\u201d She smiled again. \u201cYou would not have attained such a powerful position if you habitually broke your word. Besides, you\u2019re considerably older than the soldiers under your command, or so I was told by one of the servants. I believe you\u2019ve learned patience and restraint by now. You\u2019ll need both to capture Nicholaa, for she can be very difficult when she\u2019s riled. She\u2019s clever, too.\u201d</p><p>Before Royce could respond to those comments, Danielle turned and walked over to the two women standing by the window. She handed the baby to the woman called Clarise, then whispered instructions to the other servant.</p><p>She turned back to Royce. \u201cI shall give you my sister\u2019s destination after I\u2019ve seen to your injury,\u201d she announced. \u201cYou\u2019ve a fair-sized cut on your forehead, Baron. I\u2019ll clean and bandage it. Do sit down. It should only take a minute or two of your time.\u201d</p><p>Royce was so surprised by her thoughtfulness and her kindness that he didn\u2019t know how to react. He started to shake his head, then changed his mind. He finally sat down. Ingelram stood in the doorway, watching. The servant placed a bowl of water on the low chest next to the stool on which Royce sat while Danielle collected several strips of clean white cloth.</p><p>The baron swallowed up the stool. His long legs were stretched out in front of him. Danielle skirted her way between his feet and stood between his thighs.</p><p>He noticed her hands shook when she dipped the cloth into the water. She didn\u2019t say a word to him while she saw to his care, but when the injury was cleaned to her satisfaction and she was applying soothing salve, she asked him how he\u2019d come by the wound.</p><p>\u201cA stone perhaps,\u201d he answered with a shrug. \u201cIt isn\u2019t significant.\u201d</p><p>Her smile was gentle. \u201cI think perhaps it was significant at the time. Why, the blow must have left you stunned, at the very least.\u201d</p><p>He was barely paying attention to what she was saying. Damn, she smelled good. He couldn\u2019t seem to concentrate on anything but the beautiful woman standing so close to him. The faint scent of roses caught his attention. So did the cross nestled between her breasts. He stared at the holy article until he was able to control his reaction to her. The minute she stepped back, he stood up.</p><p>\u201cMy sister went to Baron Alfred\u2019s holding,\u201d she told him. \u201cHis home is just three hours north of here. Alfred has vowed to resist the Normans, and Nicholaa plans to add our brother\u2019s loyal soldiers to his fight.\u201d</p><p>A shout came from the doorway, interrupting the conversation. One of Royce\u2019s soldiers was requesting his attention. \u201cStay with her,\u201d Royce ordered Ingelram.</p><p>The warrior was already out the doorway when the vassal\u2019s fervent reply reached him. \u201cI\u2019ll protect her with my life, Baron. As God is my witness, no one will touch her.\u201d</p><p>Royce\u2019s sigh echoed down the hallway. God save me from eager young knights, he thought to himself. If he hadn\u2019t been blessed with such a patient nature, he knew he would have slammed Ingelram\u2019s ignorant head through a wall by now. He\u2019d imagined doing just that several times in the last hour.</p><p>Another young soldier was waiting for Royce at the top of the steps. \u201cThere\u2019s a battle raging even now, Baron, to the south of the fortress. From the walkway atop the wall we can see that the Saxon dogs have our Norman soldiers surrounded. The colors of the banner tell us the small contingent belongs to Baron Hugh. Do we ride to give him assistance?\u201d</p><p>Royce left the keep and climbed up to the walkway to judge the situation for himself. The soldier who\u2019d reported the battle trailed behind him. He was, unfortunately, just as unskilled as Ingelram and as hopelessly enthusiastic as well. It was a dangerous combination.</p><p>\u201cDo you see how the Saxons have our soldiers in retreat, Baron?\u201d the soldier asked.</p><p>Royce shook his head. \u201cYou look, but you don\u2019t see,\u201d he muttered. \u201cHugh\u2019s men use the same tactic we employed in our battle near Hastings. Our soldiers are drawing the Saxons into a trap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut the odds are surely in the Saxons\u2019 favor. Their numbers are thrice\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe numbers aren\u2019t in the least significant,\u201d Royce countered. He let out a weary sigh, reminded himself he was a patient man, and then turned to look at the dark-haired soldier. \u201cHow long have you been in my ranks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNearly eight weeks now.\u201d</p><p>Royce\u2019s irritation immediately vanished. There hadn\u2019t been time for training, what with all the preparations needed for the invasion of England. \u201cYou\u2019re excused for your ignorance,\u201d he announced. He started toward the steps. \u201cWe\u2019ll give Hugh\u2019s men assistance, but only because of our love of a good battle, not because they need our help. Norman soldiers are vastly superior in any fight, and Hugh\u2019s men will most assuredly claim victory with or without our help.\u201d</p><p>The young soldier nodded, then asked if he could go into battle by his baron\u2019s side. Royce granted his request. He left twenty soldiers at the holding and rode out with the remaining men. Since there were only women, children, and servants inside the walls, he decided Ingelram could easily maintain order until he returned.</p><p>The fight was invigorating, though too quickly finished, in Royce\u2019s estimation. Because he was a cynical man, he thought it odd indeed that as soon as he and his soldiers joined the battle, the Saxons, with still at least double the number of soldiers, scattered like mountain wolves into the hills. Had the battle been staged to draw him out? Royce, weary from too little sleep, decided he was arrogantly overly concerned about the Saxons\u2019 retreat. He and his men spent another hour ferreting out infidels from their dens before giving up the chase.</p><p>Royce was surprised to find that Hugh, a friend and equal in rank under William\u2019s command, was leading the contingent, for he assumed Hugh would be fighting by their leader\u2019s side on the final sweep into London. When he put that question to the warrior, Hugh explained he\u2019d been dispatched to the north to subdue the faction there. He had been on his way back to London when the Saxons attacked him.</p><p>Hugh was a good ten years older than Royce. Gray stained his brown hair, and the faded scars on his face and arms made Royce look almost unblemished.</p><p>\u201cI have only lesser-skilled soldiers in my unit,\u201d Hugh confessed in a bleak voice. \u201cThe more experienced were sent ahead to William. I tell you, Royce, I don\u2019t have your patience for training men. Had it not been for our informant\u2019s warning, I believe I would have lost most of my men just now. The Saxon spy put us on our guard at just the right moment, and for that reason the ambush wasn\u2019t nearly as effective as it might have been. My soldiers are still without discipline.\u201d Hugh leaned forward and, in a voice usually reserved for the confessional, whispered, \u201cTwo of my men have misplaced their swords, I tell you. Can you believe such a sin? I should kill the fools now and be saved the aggravation.\u201d He let out a long sigh. \u201cWith your permission, I\u2019ll ask William to place a few of my boy warriors in your ranks for proper training.\u201d</p><p>The two barons, surrounded by their troops, started back toward the holding.</p><p>\u201cWho is this informant you mentioned?\u201d Royce asked. \u201cAnd why do you trust him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe man\u2019s name is James, and I haven\u2019t said I trust him,\u201d Hugh answered. \u201cHe has proved to be reliable thus far, that\u2019s all. He tells me he\u2019s hated by the other Saxons because he was given the unholy chore of collecting the tax. James is very familiar with the families in this area. He was raised here, you see. He knows all the favorite hiding places, too. Has the wind not taken on a wicked bite this past hour, Royce?\u201d Hugh asked then, switching topics as he pulled his heavy cloak around his shoulders. \u201cMy bones are feeling the rattle of winter now.\u201d</p><p>Royce barely noticed the cold. A fine mist of snow was swirling around them, but it wasn\u2019t sufficient to blanket the ground. \u201cYou have old bones, Hugh. That\u2019s the reason you feel the cold.\u201d He grinned at his friend to soften the insult. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Hugh smiled back. \u201cOld, say you? You\u2019ll change your opinion when you hear about my astonishing victories against the Saxons.\u201d</p><p>The arrogant warrior then began to relate, detail by methodical detail, the series of victories he\u2019d claimed in William\u2019s name. He didn\u2019t finish with his litany of boasts until they were in the courtyard of the castle.</p><p>Ingelram wasn\u2019t there to greet his lord, and Royce surmised the besotted vassal was still abovestairs, staring at the nun.</p><p>The mere reminder of the Saxon woman made him uneasy\u2014something about her bothered Royce, but he couldn\u2019t quite put his finger on what it was.</p> <p>Perhaps, he thought to himself, it was because she was such an appealing woman. It was a shame, to his way of thinking, for such a beautiful woman to belong to the church. She should belong to a man.</p><p>He decided it was weariness making him think such sinful thoughts. He walked at Hugh\u2019s side into the keep. It had already been decided that Hugh and his contingent would spend the night at the holding, for dark was fast approaching.</p><p>Hugh looked exhausted and chilled through. Royce ordered a fire started in the hearth for his friend\u2019s benefit, then requested that the Saxon informant Hugh had told him had useful information be ordered inside. \u201cI would like to ask him a few questions regarding this household,\u201d he explained.</p><p>A soldier was immediately dispatched to bring the Saxon inside. A minute or two later, Ingelram came running into the great hall. The fair-haired soldier skidded to a halt, bowed to his lord, and prepared to give his accounting.</p><p>Royce cut him off with a curt order. \u201cBring the nun to me. I\u2019ll question her now.\u201d</p> <p>Ingelram looked astonished by the order; he paled visibly. Royce was just about to give the vassal a hard shove to get him moving when his attention was turned to the entrance. The soldier Hugh had sent outside had just returned with the informant at his side. The Saxon Judas was dressed in ill-fitting garments, an indication to Royce of his fall in status. The brown tunic the man wore brushed the ground and was caked with mud. He reminded Royce of an owl. He was a short man with stooped shoulders, and his eyelids were so heavily laden with extra folds of skin that they appeared hooded. Aye, he looked like an owl, but he had the heart of a vulture to betray his countrymen, Royce thought with distain.</p><p>\u201cCome forward, James,\u201d Royce commanded.</p><p>The Saxon did as he was ordered. When he reached the Norman soldiers, he made a low bow. \u201cI am ever your faithful servant, my lords.\u201d</p><p>Royce stood by Hugh\u2019s side in front of the hearth with his hands clasped behind his back. Hugh held a woolen cloak around his shoulders in an attempt to ward off the chills racking his body. Royce noticed the pallor of his complexion, the fevered look in his brown eyes, and immediately ordered a chair carried over to the fireplace.</p><p>\u201cBring your baron a full cup of ale,\u201d he called out to one of Hugh\u2019s soldiers standing sentry near the entrance. \u201cMake one of the Saxons take the first swallow. If the servant doesn\u2019t die, we\u2019ll know the ale isn\u2019t poisoned.\u201d</p><p>Hugh grumbled over Royce\u2019s order. \u201cI\u2019m every bit as fit as you are,\u201d he muttered. \u201cI\u2019ll be seeing to my own wants.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, you are as fit as I am,\u201d Royce agreed. \u201cBut you\u2019ve fought double the number of battles this past week.\u201d That was a lie, of course, but Royce sought to appease his friend\u2019s pride. \u201cI, too, would be weary if I had accomplished half your number of victories in William\u2019s name.\u201d</p><p>Hugh muttered agreement. \u201c\u2019Tis the truth you would be weary.\u201d</p><p>The shield of Hugh\u2019s pride had gone undented. Royce held his smile and turned his attention back to the informant. Since the infidel had spoken the guttural Saxon language, Royce questioned him in kind. \u201cTell me about this household,\u201d he ordered. \u201cBegin with the parents. Is it true they\u2019re both dead?\u201d</p><p>The Saxon moved out of the way as a soldier carried a large high-backed chair over to the hearth. He waited until Hugh was settled before answering. \u201cAye, my lord. The parents are both dead. They\u2019re buried in the family plot atop the crest to the north.\u201d</p><p>James\u2019s neck began to ache from having to tilt his head all the way back in order to look up at the Norman\u2019s face. When the crick became too irritating, he turned his gaze to the floor. The action proved a blessing, for the tightness in his chest immediately loosened once he wasn\u2019t looking directly at the warrior\u2019s face. The Norman\u2019s eyes were just as terrifying as the hideous scar covering most of his right cheek, James admitted. His hard, cold gaze was far more intimidating than his size or his marks.</p><p>\u201cNow tell me about the other members of this family,\u201d Royce commanded.</p><p>James hurried to answer. \u201cThere are two brothers. Thurston is the eldest of the children. It was reported he died during the battle in the north. This hasn\u2019t been verified yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the other brother?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHis name is Justin. He\u2019s the youngest in the family. He was injured in the same battle. The nuns are taking care of him now at the abbey. It isn\u2019t believed Justin will live, though. His injuries were quite severe.\u201d</p><p>Ingelram continued to stand by his leader\u2019s side. Royce suddenly turned to his vassal. \u201cDid I not order you to bring the nun to me?\u201d he demanded, still speaking Saxon.</p><p>Ingelram answered him in the same language. \u201cI didn\u2019t know you meant to question her, Baron.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t your duty to know what I plan to do, Ingelram. You\u2019re to obey without question.\u201d</p><p>Ingelram took a deep breath. \u201cShe isn\u2019t here,\u201d he blurted out.</p><p>Royce resisted the urge to strangle his vassal. \u201cExplain yourself,\u201d he ordered in a hard voice.</p><p>It took all the courage Ingelram possessed to meet his lord\u2019s stare. \u201cSister Danielle requested an escort back to the abbey. She\u2019d given her word to her superiors she\u2019d be back before dark. She was also most concerned about her brother. Because he\u2019s the youngest in the family, she feels great responsibility for him.\u201d</p><p>Throughout the halting explanation, Royce hadn\u2019t shown any reaction. Ingelram didn\u2019t have the faintest idea what his lord was thinking. The not knowing made his voice squeak when he continued. \u201cThe brother\u2019s injuries are life-threatening, Baron, and she wanted to sit by his side through the night. She promised me she\u2019d return to us in the morning. Surely then she\u2019ll answer any questions you have for her.\u201d</p><p>Royce had to take a deep, calming breath before he dared to speak again. \u201cAnd if she doesn\u2019t return to us in the morning?\u201d he asked in a mild, thoroughly controlled voice.</p><p>Ingelram looked stunned by that question. He\u2019d never considered such a dark possibility. \u201cShe gave me her word, Baron. She wouldn\u2019t lie to me. She couldn\u2019t. She\u2019s a bride of the church. It would be a mortal sin on her soul if she didn\u2019t tell the truth. If, for some reason, she cannot leave the abbey in the morning, I\u2019ll be happy to go inside and fetch her for you.\u201d</p><p>Royce was conditioned by years of training to control his temper. He did so now, though the urge to shout at the foolish vassal made his throat ache. The fact that the Saxon informant was in the hall did help somewhat, for Royce would never ever chastise one of his men in front of an outsider. It would be an indignity, and Royce always treated his men the way he expected to be treated. Respect was earned, not demanded, but dignity was taught by example.</p><p>Hugh cleared his throat, gaining Royce\u2019s full attention. The older warrior gave his friend a sympathetic look, then turned to Ingelram. \u201cSon, you can\u2019t go inside the sacred walls to get her. The left hand of God would descend upon all of us if we dared to violate the most holy law of all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe holy law?\u201d Ingelram stammered out, clearly not understanding.</p><p>Hugh rolled his eyes heavenward. \u201cShe\u2019s under the protection of the church now, son. You\u2019ve just given her sanctuary.\u201d</p><p>Ingelram was finally beginning to understand the ramifications of his deed. He was horrified by his own conduct. He was also desperate to find a way to redeem himself in his lord\u2019s eyes. \u201cBut she promised me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe silent.\u201d</p><p>Royce hadn\u2019t raised his voice when he gave that command, but the Saxon informant jumped a good foot, for he\u2019d gotten a glimpse of the fury in the warrior\u2019s gray eyes. He took several steps back in a puny attempt to separate himself from the Norman\u2019s wrath.</p><p>Royce was amused by the Saxon\u2019s cowardly retreat. The little man was literally shaking in his boots. \u201cYou\u2019ve told me about the brothers, James,\u201d Royce said then, returning the conversation to the household. \u201cNow tell me about the twin sisters. We were told that one is a nun and the other . . .\u201d</p><p>He stopped when the Saxon shook his head. \u201cThere is no nun in this household,\u201d James blurted out. \u201cThere is Lady Nicholaa,\u201d he added in a rush when he saw how his explanation was affecting the Norman. The jagged scar on the warrior\u2019s face had turned stark white. \u201cLady Nicholaa is\u2014\u201d</p><p>Royce interrupted him. \u201cWe know about Lady Nicholaa,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s the one who defended her castle against us, isn\u2019t that correct?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, my lord,\u201d James answered. \u201cThat is correct.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow I want to hear about the other twin. If she isn\u2019t a nun, then . . .\u201d</p><p>The Saxon dared to shake his head at him again. James looked more perplexed than frightened now. \u201cBut my lord,\u201d he whispered, \u201cthere is only one. Lady Nicholaa does not have a twin.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>Royce\u2019s reaction to the Saxon\u2019s announcement was swift and surprising. He threw back his head and laughed until tears filled his eyes. Lady Nicholaa\u2019s clever ploy to gain sanctuary astonished him. The woman had proved to be extremely resourceful, a trait he was quick to appreciate whenever he chanced upon it.</p><p>Nicholaa wasn\u2019t a nun. Relief swelled inside him. He didn\u2019t understand the reason for such a reaction, however, and quickly pushed the feeling aside. Then he started laughing again. By God, he hadn\u2019t lusted after a bride of the church after all.</p><p>Ingelram didn\u2019t know what to make of his lord\u2019s bizarre behavior. In the short while he\u2019d been under the baron\u2019s command, he\u2019d never even seen him smile. The vassal suddenly realized he\u2019d never witnessed his leader accept defeat, either.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you understand, Baron?\u201d Ingelram blurted out. \u201cYou\u2019ve suffered a humiliation because of me. I believed her lies. I gave her escort to the abbey.\u201d</p><p>Ingelram boldly moved forward until he had placed himself within striking distance of his lord, then said in an anguished whisper, \u201cI alone am to blame.\u201d</p><p>Royce raised an eyebrow over his vassal\u2019s dramatic confession. \u201cWe will discuss this later,\u201d he announced with a meaningful glance toward the Saxon.</p><p>When Ingelram bowed his head, Royce turned back to the tax collector. \u201cTell me what you know about Nicholaa,\u201d he ordered.</p><p>James lifted his shoulders in a helpless shrug. \u201cI was run out of this area two and one half years ago, milord, when the task of collecting the tax was given to another man. I know that Nicholaa was supposed to marry a giant of a man named Roulf, who had a large holding to the south. She\u2019d been pledged to him since childhood, and if the wedding took place as scheduled, she was married to him almost two full years before he was slain at Hastings. \u2019Tis all I know about Nicholaa, milord.\u201d</p><p>Royce made no comment on the information he\u2019d just been given. He dismissed James, waited until he had left the hall, and then turned back to Ingelram. \u201cIn future, you will not parade your sins in front of outsiders. Do you understand me?\u201d</p><p>Ingelram nodded. He looked properly horrified by the reprimand.</p><p>Royce let out a sigh. \u201cWhen you act in my stead, Ingelram, your mistakes become mine. If you\u2019ve learned anything from this incident, then the inconvenience you\u2019ve caused me might all be for the good.\u201d</p><p>Ingelram was astonished by his lord\u2019s remarks. He\u2019d never heard a defeat referred to as an inconvenience before. He didn\u2019t know how to respond.</p><p>Hugh captured Royce\u2019s attention when he interjected, \u201cLady Nicholaa has proved to be cunning, hasn\u2019t she, Royce? She certainly slipped out of your grasp . . . for the time being,\u201d he added with a nod in Ingelram\u2019s direction.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Royce answered with a grin. \u201cFor the time being.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019Tis the truth, I fell victim to her lies,\u201d Ingelram blurted out.</p><p>\u201cNay,\u201d Royce contradicted. \u201cYou fell prey to her beauty. Recognize the error for what it was so you won\u2019t repeat it.\u201d</p><p>The vassal slowly nodded. He took a deep breath while he removed his sword from his scabbard. His hands shook when he offered his father\u2019s bejeweled weapon to Royce. \u201cI\u2019ve failed you, Baron. Because of me, you\u2019ve been shamed.\u201d</p><p>Ingelram closed his eyes in anticipation of the blow. A long agonizing minute passed before he opened them. Why was his leader hesitating? \u201cYou don\u2019t wish to retaliate, Baron?\u201d he asked, confusion obvious in his gaze.</p><p>Royce let him see his exasperation. He turned to Hugh, caught his smile, and almost smiled himself. \u201cWhat I wish to do and what I will do are two different things, Ingelram,\u201d he said. \u201cIn time you will understand. Why do you offer me your sword?\u201d</p><p>Ingelram was caught off guard by the question. Baron Royce\u2019s voice had been so mild. Was it possible his lord wasn\u2019t overly displeased by his error in judgment? \u201cI offer you my sword so that you may use it against me, if that is your inclination. Baron, I don\u2019t understand why you . . . I have disgraced you, haven\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>Royce ignored that question and asked one of his own. \u201cUnder whose command were you before you came into my ranks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was Baron Guy\u2019s squire for two years,\u201d Ingelram answered.</p><p>\u201cAnd in all that time did you ever see Guy use a vassal\u2019s sword against him?\u201d</p><p>Royce was prepared to hear a quick denial. He knew Guy sometimes used intimidating tactics when dealing with younger, inexperienced soldiers, a method that found little favor with Royce. There had even been whispers of true brutality, but he didn\u2019t pay any attention to such talk. He believed the stories were simply exaggerations spread by disgruntled men who hadn\u2019t been able to meet Baron Guy\u2019s rigid training requirements.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t hide his surprise when Ingelram nodded. \u201cI did witness such retaliation. Baron Guy never killed a vassal, but several unfortunate soldiers later died from the punishment he inflicted. Their wounds became infected.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIngelram, that explains your peculiar behavior,\u201d Hugh interjected. He turned to Royce. \u201cThe boy\u2019s speaking the truth, Royce. Guy uses physical retaliation and humiliation to gain obedience and loyalty. Tell me this, Ingelram,\u201d Hugh continued with a glance in the vassal\u2019s direction. \u201cAre the bastards Henry and Morgan still acting as Guy\u2019s right and left hands?\u201d</p><p>Ingelram nodded again. \u201cThey are his closest advisers,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen Baron Guy is occupied with more important matters, Henry and Morgan supervise the training of the men.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the punishment as well?\u201d Hugh prodded.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Ingelram answered. \u201cThe punishment as well.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMorgan\u2019s worse than Henry,\u201d Hugh announced. \u201cI\u2019ve seen him fight. I hoped he would die during the invasion, but the Saxons didn\u2019t accommodate me. I suppose the devil\u2019s bent on keeping him alive.\u201d</p><p>Ingelram took a bold step forward. \u201cMay I speak freely?\u201d he asked Royce.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that what you\u2019ve been doing?\u201d his baron answered.</p><p>Ingelram blushed. Royce suddenly felt like an old man. He was a good twelve years older than the vassal, but the differences in their reactions made it seem more like twenty. \u201cWhat else did you wish to say, Ingelram?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost of the soldiers are obedient to Guy, but they aren\u2019t loyal, as Baron Hugh supposed. They fear him and do his bidding for that reason alone. There\u2019s no loyalty, save to Duke William, of course.\u201d</p> <p>Royce showed no outward reaction to the startling news about Guy. He leaned back against the mantel of the fireplace and folded his arms across his chest. He looked very relaxed. Inside he was furious. A man of such status should be a protector by nature, Royce believed, with values stronger than those of his men. It sounded as though Guy had become a destroyer.</p><p>\u201cIngelram?\u201d Hugh asked. \u201cDid you request this move into Royce\u2019s ranks?\u201d</p><p>A noticeable wheeze had entered Hugh\u2019s voice. He leaned back in his chair to ease his weariness and rubbed his whiskered jaw while he waited for an answer.</p><p>\u201cI did request the move,\u201d Ingelram answered. \u201cIn truth, I held little hope I would be considered, though. The list of soldiers begging entrance into Baron Royce\u2019s army numbers over a thousand. My father was able to sway William\u2019s mind, however, and my name was lifted to the top of the list. I was very fortunate.\u201d</p><p>Hugh shook his head. \u201cI still don\u2019t understand how you managed it, with or without William\u2019s blessing. First you had to gain Guy\u2019s permission to request this transfer. \u2019Tis a fact Guy isn\u2019t known for granting requests, especially those that might benefit Royce. Guy\u2019s been in competition with Royce ever since their squire days together.\u201d</p><p>Hugh paused to let out a low chuckle. \u201cI almost pity Guy. He always comes in second best. I think it\u2019s making him crazed.\u201d</p> <p>Royce was watching Ingelram. The vassal\u2019s face had turned bright red. When Ingelram realized his lord was staring at him, he blurted out, \u201cBaron Guy isn\u2019t your friend. He\u2019s filled with jealousy. You always best him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut why did he grant you this transfer?\u201d Hugh prodded, wishing to get to the bottom of this puzzle.</p><p>Ingelram\u2019s gaze turned to the tops of his boots. \u201cHe didn\u2019t see my transfer as a favor to Baron Royce. Quite the opposite, in fact. Both Henry and Morgan had a good laugh over their lord\u2019s cunning decision. They all believe I\u2019ll never be a fit knight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would Guy consider you unfit?\u201d Royce asked.</p><p>If Ingelram turned any redder, Royce thought, he might burst into flames. He held his patience and waited for the soldier to answer him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m weakhearted,\u201d Ingelram confessed. \u201cBaron Guy said I wasn\u2019t strong-willed enough for his unit. Now you have the truth, and Baron Guy has been proven correct. My weakness caused your defeat.\u201d</p><p>Royce felt like growling. \u201cWe\u2019re not defeated,\u201d he snapped. \u201cFor God\u2019s sake, put your sword away. You haven\u2019t even begun your training, and for that reason I do not fault you. If, however, after six months under my direction, you should make a similar misjudgment, I\u2019ll take your throat between my hands and try to strangle some sense into you. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>Royce\u2019s voice had taken on a hard edge. Ingelram nodded vigorously. \u201cI shall willingly give you my neck if I fail you again,\u201d he vowed dramatically. \u201cNo other defeat will I\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFor the love of God, will you cease calling this minor inconvenience a defeat?\u201d Royce demanded. \u201cLady Nicholaa has only delayed me; she hasn\u2019t eluded me. When I\u2019m ready to leave for London, I\u2019ll go to the abbey, and I won\u2019t have to go inside, Ingelram. She\u2019ll come out to me.\u201d</p><p>He took a threatening step toward his vassal. \u201cDo you doubt me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNay, my lord.\u201d</p><p>Royce nodded. He didn\u2019t explain how he planned to accomplish this feat, and Ingelram knew better than to ask. The topic was duly dismissed.</p><p>Soon, however, Royce was forced to put the matter of collecting Nicholaa on the bottom of his list of duties. Hugh was far more ill than anyone realized. By the following morning the warrior was burning with fever.</p><p>Royce stayed by his friend\u2019s side for three long days and nights. He wasn\u2019t about to let any of his own inexperienced young men or the Saxon servants near the Norman. They would poison him at the first opportunity, or so Royce believed. The duty of caring for the knight therefore fell on Royce\u2019s shoulders. It was a task he was, unfortunately, unqualified to accomplish with much skill.</p><p>Royce kept the tax collector in residence and left Hugh\u2019s side only once during the long vigil, to question the Saxon about Nicholaa\u2019s family. He\u2019d already formulated a plan to force the woman from her sanctuary, but he wanted to make certain he hadn\u2019t missed any other considerations.</p><p>Hugh\u2019s condition deteriorated. By week\u2019s end, it became apparent he would die if he didn\u2019t receive proper treatment. In desperation, Royce took his friend to the abbey. Both Ingelram and Hugh\u2019s vassal, Charles, flanked the cart in which Hugh rested.</p><p>The four men were denied entrance to the abbey until they agreed to remove their weapons. Royce didn\u2019t argue with the order, and once the swords were handed over, the iron gates to the abbey were opened.</p><p>The abbess met them in the center of the stonepaved courtyard. She was an old woman, nearly forty by Royce\u2019s estimation, stooped in posture, too, but with a surprisingly clear, unwrinkled complexion.</p><p>She was dressed in black, from the veil hiding her hair to the shoes covering her feet, and though the top of her head didn\u2019t even reach his shoulders, she seemed unimpressed by his size. Her gaze was direct, unwavering.</p><p>The abbess reminded him of Sister Danielle . . . or rather Lady Nicholaa, he corrected.</p><p>\u201cWhy have you placed your soldiers around the walls of this abbey?\u201d the nun asked in greeting.</p><p>\u201cMy soldiers are here to make certain Lady Nicholaa doesn\u2019t leave her sanctuary,\u201d Royce answered.</p><p>\u201cHave you come here with the intent of persuading her to leave?\u201d</p><p>Royce shook his head. He walked over to the back of the cart and motioned for the abbess to follow.</p><p>The abbess proved to have a compassionate nature. As soon as she saw Hugh\u2019s condition, she ordered him taken inside.</p><p>Hugh was too weak to stand on his own. Royce hoisted the sleeping warrior over his shoulder. He staggered under the weight, straightened, and then followed the abbess inside. There was a stone staircase directly to the left of the arched entrance. He and his men climbed the steps and followed the nun down a long, brightly lit corridor.</p><p>Whispers followed them. The clatter of men\u2019s boots as they strode down the wooden floor echoed off the stone walls, but Royce could still hear the soft chanting of the other nuns. The closer he came to the door at the end of the hallway, the stronger the voices became. He recognized the Pater Noster and knew then the sisters were at prayer. From the direction of the sweet, musical sound, he guessed the nuns were sequestered on the floor above.</p><p>\u201cWe have only one large room in which to house the sick who come to us,\u201d the abbess explained. \u201cJust one week past we were filled to capacity, but today only one Saxon soldier remains under our care. You do agree, don\u2019t you, Baron, that all men are equal inside these walls, be they Norman or Saxon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree,\u201d Royce answered. \u201cIs this Saxon soldier Lady Nicholaa\u2019s brother?\u201d</p><p>The abbess turned around. \u201cYes,\u201d she answered. \u201cJustin is resting inside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he dying, as I was informed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly God can answer that question,\u201d she replied. \u201cJustin refuses to accept the cross thrust upon his shoulders. He fights our every treatment. He prays for death while we diligently pray for his recovery. I can only hope God will not become confused by our contradictory pleas.\u201d</p><p>Royce wasn\u2019t certain if the mother superior was making a jest or not. Her brow was puckered into a frown. He nodded again, shifted Hugh over his shoulder, and then said, \u201cI would like to get my friend settled. Can we not discuss your concerns after Hugh has been made comfortable?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve only one concern now,\u201d the abbess announced. \u201cYou\u2019d best know I have every intention of placing your friend in the bed next to Justin\u2019s. I can see from your frown you\u2019ve little liking for this decision, but I have a sound, practical reason. Sister Felicity is best qualified to care for both men. She\u2019s quite elderly now, and I won\u2019t have her running from one end of the room to the other. She\u2019ll sit between the soldiers. Do you accept this condition?\u201d</p><p>Royce nodded. The abbess looked relieved. She turned and opened the door. The room Royce entered was gigantic. He squinted against the sunlight that poured in from three large windows in the far wall. Wooden benches stood beneath each window. The walls were sparkling clean from a recent whitewashing.</p><p>Along the opposite wall were over twenty beds. Next to each bed stood a small chest. A single white candle sat on each chest.</p><p>Each bed and chest could be enclosed on all sides by white curtains that hung from ceiling to floor. When the draperies were pulled, the area became a cell of privacy.</p><p>All but one of the beds was exposed to the sunshine now. Royce surmised that the square white cocoon near the center of the room was the cell where Justin rested.</p><p>He settled Hugh in the bed next to the curtained cell. Within minutes he\u2019d stripped his friend of his heavy outer garments and covered him with a mound of thick, soft fleece blankets.</p><p>\u201cThe wounds on his arms and shoulders are festering,\u201d the abbess remarked with a worried frown. \u201cSister Felicity will know what to do.\u201d She bent down and stroked Hugh\u2019s forehead in a motherly gesture. \u201cGod willing, this one will recover.\u201d</p><p>Royce nodded. He continued to be very accommodating until the nun suggested he and his men take their leave. Royce shook his head then. \u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cA Norman soldier will guard Hugh until he recovers. He will not be allowed to eat or drink until the food has been tasted by one of your own,\u201d he added in a hard voice.</p><p>It was obvious from the surprised look on the abbess\u2019s face that she wasn\u2019t used to being contradicted. \u201cYou\u2019re a suspicious man, Baron,\u201d she said frowning. \u201cThis is a sacred house. No harm will come to your friend.\u201d</p><p>When Royce only shrugged his shoulders, the abbess asked, \u201cAnd if I do not accept your conditions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t turn Hugh away,\u201d he countered. \u201cYour vows won\u2019t let you.\u201d</p><p>Her smile surprised him. \u201cI see you\u2019re every bit as stubborn as I am,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ll both spend a bit of time in purgatory for that flaw in our natures. Very well, then. I\u2019ll accept your conditions.\u201d</p><p>Hugh moaned in his sleep, drawing the mother superior\u2019s attention again. She gently tucked the covers around the warrior, whispering soft words of comfort all the while. Then she closed the curtains and went in search of Sister Felicity. The minute she turned to leave, Royce motioned to Ingelram and Hugh\u2019s vassal. The two soldiers immediately followed the abbess to the doorway and took up their positions on either side of the entrance. No one but a nun would be allowed inside the chamber until Hugh had fully recovered.</p><p>While he waited for the abbess to return, Royce decided to appease his curiosity about the Saxon soldier. He wanted to see for himself that the man was too ill to be a threat to Hugh. He wasn\u2019t about to take for granted anything a Saxon told him until he had personally confirmed it.</p><p>Royce walked to the other side of Hugh\u2019s bed and was just about to push the curtain away when someone pulled it back from the other side.</p><p>He suddenly found himself shoulders to face with Lady Nicholaa.</p><p>Her indrawn breath told him she was even more surprised by their encounter than he was. He assumed she thought he\u2019d left with the abbess. He knew she must have heard every word of their conversation.</p><p>They stood no more than a foot apart. A light fragrance of roses caught his attention.</p><p>Lord, she was lovely\u2014and, he hoped, frightened. Her eyes were wide with what he suspected was fear.</p><p>Yes, he decided, she was afraid. Royce thought that was a most intelligent reaction. The woman should damn well be afraid of him, for every action after all produced a reaction, or a retaliation. Lady Nicholaa had lied in order to gain temporary freedom. Soon, however, it would be his turn to retaliate.</p><p>Neither of them said a word for several moments. Royce towered over her and waited for her to cower.</p><p>She waited until she could control her anger.</p><p>The longer she stared at him, the more furious she became. How dare this Norman venture inside her brother\u2019s sickroom?</p><p>Her chin came up in an instinctively defiant action.</p><p>He quit smiling.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t afraid of him. That realization stunned him. It was followed by a sinful thought. The woman was close enough for him to grab. Lord, how easy it would be simply to toss her over his shoulder and leave the abbey. It was a sinful thought because she was under the church\u2019s protection now. But it was no more sinful than the sudden burst of desire that caught him unawares.</p><p>If a man\u2019s preferences ran to blue-eyed nymphs, then Nicholaa would certainly be his first choice. He told himself his preferences didn\u2019t run in that direction. Then he recognized the lie and gave it up. Hell, he could be content to spend the rest of his days staring at her and wanting more.</p><p>Her mouth was too appealing to give him any peace of mind. All he wanted to think about was what she would taste like. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His discipline saved him from grabbing hold of her and finding out then and there. He took a deep, calming breath. He forced himself to put his lust aside and concentrate on staring the woman to her knees. Defiance was all very well and good under certain circumstances, but this wasn\u2019t one of them. She needed to be afraid now. With fear came caution, he reasoned. Nicholaa had caused quite enough havoc. It was time for her to surrender. He was determined to make her realize just whom she was up against. He was her conquerer, and she was his booty. The sooner she came to terms with that fact, the easier her life would be.</p><p>He was good at intimidation. The scar on his face helped, of course.</p><p>Odd, but it didn\u2019t seem to be helping him now. No matter how fierce his scowl became, she still didn\u2019t cower.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t help but be impressed. He took a step forward. The tips of his boots touched the toes of her shoes. She still didn\u2019t back away. Her head was tilted all the way back so she could continue to hold his gaze, and if he hadn\u2019t known better, he would have thought there was a sparkle in her eyes.</p> <p>Dared she mock him?</p><p>Nicholaa was having difficulty remembering how to breathe. In truth, she was more furious with herself than with the warlord frowning so furiously down at her. Her reaction to the Norman was unexplainable. She couldn\u2019t quit staring at him. He had the most beautiful gray eyes, though why in God\u2019s name she\u2019d taken time to notice the appealing trait was simply beyond her comprehension.</p><p>He was trying to intimidate her. She wasn\u2019t going to let him. The warrior really was handsome, damn his hide. And damn her own for noticing. What was the matter with her? He was her enemy, and she was supposed to hate him, wasn\u2019t she?</p><p>He obviously wasn\u2019t having any trouble hating her. His dark expression told of his displeasure. Her back straightened in reaction.</p><p>\u201cI should have killed you when I had the chance,\u201d she whispered.</p> <p>He raised an eyebrow. \u201cAnd when was that?\u201d he asked in a soft, mocking voice.</p><p>\u201cWhen I knocked you off your feet with the stone from my sling.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head.</p><p>She nodded. \u201cMy aim was true,\u201d she boasted. \u201cI meant to mark you, not kill you. Now I regret that decision. Perhaps I\u2019ll get a second chance before you\u2019re chased back to Normandy where you belong.\u201d</p><p>He still didn\u2019t believe her. He folded his arms across his chest and smiled down at her. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you kill me when you had the chance?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cI didn\u2019t feel like it,\u201d she announced. \u201cNow I do.\u201d</p> <p>When he laughed, she realized that he still didn\u2019t believe her. She couldn\u2019t blame him, she supposed, because until this very minute, she hadn\u2019t told him a single truth. She wondered if he\u2019d found out she wasn\u2019t really a member of the order of nuns. Of course he had, she decided almost immediately. The treasonous tax collector would have told him.</p><p>Nicholaa could feel her composure slipping away. Her knees, too. She decided to dismiss him and reached up to pull the curtain closed.</p><p>He was much quicker than she was. He had hold of her hand before she\u2019d even touched the drapery.</p><p>He wouldn\u2019t let go, either. His grip stung like a hornet. She quit trying to pull away from him as soon as she realized how futile her struggle was, and how weak it made her appear.</p><p>\u201cAre your possessions here, Nicholaa?\u201d</p><p>That question, asked so matter-of-factly, took her by surprise. She nodded before she could stop herself. Then she said, \u201cWhy would you ask me such a question?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a practical man,\u201d he answered. \u201cIt will save time to go directly to London from here. Have your things ready or I\u2019ll leave them behind. As soon as my friend has recovered, we leave.\u201d</p><p>She was astonished by his arrogance. \u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, you are.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head at him. The veil hiding her hair slipped to one side. Before she could right the damage, he reached over and ripped the covering from her head.</p><p>Nicholaa\u2019s glorious blond mass of hair tumbled down from the coil on top of her head to hang almost to her waist. His breath caught in his throat at the magnificent sight.</p><p>\u201cOnly nuns wear the veil, Nicholaa, and you aren\u2019t a nun, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe pretense was necessary. God understands. He\u2019s on my side, not yours.\u201d</p><p>That ridiculous remark made him smile. \u201cAnd how did you come to that conclusion?\u201d</p><p>The smile had moved into his voice. Was he laughing at her? No, of course not, she told herself. He wouldn\u2019t know how. Norman warriors didn\u2019t experience human emotions. They lived only to kill and to conquer, or so her brothers had told her. The reason was simple: the enemy soldiers followed a leader who was more monster than man.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you believe God\u2019s on your side?\u201d he asked again when she didn\u2019t answer him.</p><p>\u201cI did get away from you, didn\u2019t I? That should be proof enough, Baron, that God\u2019s on my side. I\u2019m quite safe here.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t argue with that bit of lopsided logic. \u201cFor the time being, you\u2019re safe,\u201d he agreed.</p><p>She granted him a smile that showed off the attractive dimple in her cheek. \u201cI\u2019ll stay here as long as I want,\u201d she boasted. \u201c'Tis the truth, I\u2019m not leaving this sanctuary until the invasion attempt has been foiled and you\u2019ve gone back home where you belong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe invasion is all but over, Nicholaa. England belongs to us. Accept that fact, and life will be much easier for you. You\u2019ve already been conquered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will never be conquered.\u201d</p><p>The mighty boast was thoroughly ruined by the quaver in her voice. He noticed it, too. The rude man had the gall to smile. Her shoulders straightened in reaction.</p><p>Royce gave her hand a hard squeeze before finally letting go. Nicholaa started to turn away. He stopped her by grabbing hold of her chin.</p><p>He forced her face up, then leaned down until he was just inches away from her. \u201cDon\u2019t inconvenience me again.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t raise his voice above a whisper when he gave that command, but his tone was hard enough to truly infuriate her. She pushed his hand away from her chin, then moved to one side so he could get a clear look at her brother.</p><p>\u201cDo you actually believe I care if you\u2019re inconvenienced or not?\u201d she asked. \u201cMy brother lies near death because of your greedy, land-hungry leader, Duke William. Had he left England alone, Justin would still be whole.\u201d</p><p>Royce turned his attention to her brother. The first thought that came into his mind was that the Saxon soldier really was near death. His complexion was as white as the blanket covering him. Beads of perspiration covered his brow. His hair was the same white-blond as Nicholaa\u2019s, but that was the only similarity between brother and sister.</p><p>Royce couldn\u2019t see any injuries, because the blanket covered the big man from neck to feet.</p><p>He judged the soldier to be young from the lack of wrinkles at the outer corners of his eyes and the few scars on his face. He remembered then that the Saxon informant had told him Justin was a year younger than Nicholaa, and from all appearances, she was a very young woman.</p><p>So the Saxons also sent boy warriors into battle. Royce suddenly felt very weary. He shook his head in an effort to clear it while he kept his gaze on Justin. The brother\u2019s sleep was fitful. He wore a frown that suggested demons were racking his nightmares. Royce found himself affected by the sight of such obvious torment.</p><p>Nicholaa saw the concern in his eyes. He\u2019d tried to hide his reaction, but he hadn\u2019t been able to. She was surprised, confused, too. Shouldn\u2019t he be gloating?</p><p>\u201cWhen he\u2019s awake, he prays for death,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>He sounded genuinely perplexed. Nicholaa realized he couldn\u2019t see Justin\u2019s affliction. \u201cMy brother\u2019s left hand was severed in battle.\u201d</p><p>Royce showed no reaction to her announcement. \u201cHe could still live,\u201d he said after a long minute. \u201cThe injury could heal.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t want him to be optimistic. She wanted him to feel guilty. She took a protective step toward her brother. \u201cYou might have been the one who did this to Justin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>His easy acceptance of such a foul deed took her breath away. \u201cYou feel no remorse?\u201d</p><p>He gave her a look that suggested she\u2019d lost her mind. \u201cRemorse has no place in a warrior\u2019s mind.\u201d</p><p>He could tell from her expression she didn\u2019t understand what he was saying. He patiently explained. \u201cA war is like a game of chess, Nicholaa. Every battle is like a well-thought-out move on the board. Once it begins, there shouldn\u2019t be any emotion involved whatsoever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo if you did, in fact, injure my brother\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s highly doubtful,\u201d he interrupted.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat isn\u2019t how I fight.\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t making any sense to her. \u201cOh? What is it you do when you go into battle if you don\u2019t injure your enemies?\u201d</p><p>He let out a sigh. \u201cI kill them.\u201d</p><p>She tried not to let him know how appalled she was. The man acted as though they were discussing the week\u2019s mass schedule, for all the emotion in his voice. His callous attitude made her stomach burn.</p><p>\u201cYour brother was injured near Hastings and not in the north as I was informed?\u201d he asked, drawing her attention again.</p><p>\u201cNo, Justin wasn\u2019t in the battle near Hastings,\u201d she answered. \u201cHe was felled at Stamford Bridge.\u201d</p><p>Royce couldn\u2019t contain his exasperation. The confused woman had her enemies mixed up in her mind. \u201cI\u2019m Norman, Nicholaa, or have you forgotten that fact?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe battle at Stanford Bridge in the north was waged by the king of Norway and his soldiers. We Normans weren\u2019t even there.\u201d He took a step closer to her. \u201cAnd so, whether you wish it to be so or not, I couldn\u2019t have injured your brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t wish it,\u201d she blurted out.</p><p>Royce didn\u2019t know what to say to that. He considered himself an excellent judge of his opponent\u2019s reactions. Yet now he doubted his own ability. God\u2019s truth, she looked relieved. That didn\u2019t make any sense to him at all. Why would it matter to her if he had or hadn\u2019t injured her brother?</p><p>\u201cYou look relieved.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI am . . . pleased to know it wasn\u2019t you,\u201d she admitted. She turned her gaze to the floor. \u201cAnd I apologize to you for jumping to the wrong conclusion.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t believe what he\u2019d just heard. \u201cYou what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI apologize,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>He shook his head, trying to clear it of this illogical conversation.</p><p>\u201cIf it had been you, I would have had to retaliate, wouldn\u2019t I? I\u2019m all Justin has left, Baron. It has become my duty to protect him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m his sister.\u201d</p><p>Nicholaa rubbed her arms, for it seemed that the room had suddenly become frigid. God, she was tired. She\u2019d been cold for so long, and so exhausted she could barely form a coherent thought.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like this war,\u201d she whispered. \u201cMen do, though, don\u2019t they? They like to fight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome do,\u201d he acknowledged, his voice brusque in reaction to his sudden urge to take Nicholaa into his arms. Lord, she looked fragile. He could only imagine the hell she\u2019d been through since the invasion. He found it admirable that she would try to protect her brother, even though it was quite ridiculous for her to think she could.</p><p>From the whispers he\u2019d heard about her, he realized he shouldn\u2019t have expected less. \u201cDo you know, Nicholaa, that you\u2019ve become a legend among the Norman soldiers?\u201d</p><p>That announcement gained her full attention and caught her curiosity. \u201cOnly the dead become legends,\u201d she countered. \u201cNot the living.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s true, you\u2019re an exception,\u201d he said. \u201cYou did lead the defense against the first three challengers Duke William sent to secure your holding, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cYour leader sent children to try to steal my home. I merely sent them back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven so,\u201d he argued, \u201cthere\u2014\u201d</p><p>She interrupted him. \u201cMy brother\u2019s soldiers were under my direction, yes, but only after the first-in-command was forced to leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho is this soldier and where is he now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis name is John,\u201d she answered, \u201cand he left for the north.\u201d She folded her arms in front of her and turned to look down at her brother. \u201cYou\u2019ll never catch him. He\u2019s far too clever for the likes of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe sounds like a coward. He left you unprotected.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ordered him to leave. John isn\u2019t a coward. Besides, I can take care of myself, Baron. I can even get away from tiresome Normans when I want to.\u201d</p><p>He ignored that barb. \u201cA Norman would never have left a woman in charge.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. She knew she couldn\u2019t defend John now. In her heart, she thought her brother\u2019s loyal vassal was one of the most courageous men she\u2019d ever known. Against terrible odds, he had brought little Ulric to her. Her brother Thurston had ordered John to deliver his son to Nicholaa for safekeeping until the war was finished. James, the Saxon traitor, would have no knowledge about the baby, and neither, Nicholaa reasoned, would the Normans. It was a pity that Nicholaa couldn\u2019t boast of John\u2019s courage now. Little Ulric\u2019s safety came first. As far as the Normans were concerned, Ulric was simply the child of one of the servants.</p><p>Royce watched the play of emotions cross her face and wondered what thoughts were going through her mind. He didn\u2019t like the way she defended the soldier who\u2019d left her to survive on her own with but a small contingent of men to offer protection, but he decided to put that topic aside for now.</p><p>\u201cYou showed cleverness when you disguised yourself as a nun. My soldiers were taken in.\u201d</p><p>She noticed he hadn\u2019t included himself in that admission. Did he refuse to confess that he\u2019d also been fooled? \u201cYour soldiers are also little boys,\u201d she said. \u201c\u2019Tis yet another reason you\u2019ll be defeated, Baron.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost of my soldiers are older than you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen they\u2019re ignorant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUntrained, not ignorant,\u201d he corrected. \u201cThe skilled soldiers were needed for more important work.\u201d</p><p>He was being honest with her, but the look on her face indicated she was insulted by the truth. She turned her back on him in an attempt to dismiss him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He wasn\u2019t ready to be dismissed. \u201cI would warn you, Nicholaa, that being clever isn\u2019t going to aid your cause. The journey to London will be difficult at best, and the time we\u2019re forced to spend together will be tolerable for you only if you behave.\u201d</p><p>She refused to turn around. There was fire in her voice when she spoke again. \u201cMy God, you are an arrogant man. I\u2019ve been given sanctuary here and even unholy Normans cannot break that law. I won\u2019t leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will.\u201d</p><p>She let out a gasp and turned to confront him. \u201cYou would violate the right of sanctuary?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, but you will walk outside these walls when the time comes.\u201d</p><p>A shiver of fear rushed down Nicholaa\u2019s spine. What weapon could he use against her? Her mind jumped from one possibility to another, and after a long minute she concluded that he was bluffing. There wasn\u2019t a thing he could do to force her to leave her safe haven.</p><p>The rush of relief made her eyes fill with tears.</p><p>He smiled.</p><p>Her composure vanished. She completely forgot she was standing in a sickroom. She certainly wouldn\u2019t have shouted at the barbarian otherwise.</p> <p>\u201cAs long as Normans are in England, I\u2019ll never leave here. Never!\u201d</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>Never arrived exactly eight weeks later.</p><p>Baron Hugh had fully recovered from his illness and had left the abbey the day before. The abbess told Nicholaa she\u2019d overheard Baron Royce ask his friend to stay at the holding until he\u2019d taken the prize to London.</p><p>\u201cI believe, Nicholaa, the prize he referred to is you,\u201d the abbess remarked in a sympathetic voice.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s bluffing,\u201d Nicholaa muttered.</p> <p>She repeated those two words to herself over and over again during that long day. She didn\u2019t sleep at all that night, either. Royce had sent a messenger back to the abbey just before nightfall with the order that Lady Nicholaa was to gather her possessions and be ready to leave the abbey the following morning.</p><p>The abbess didn\u2019t believe the Norman was the type of man who would bluff, but she kept that thought to herself. She packed Nicholaa\u2019s small traveling bag and carried it down to the front entrance as a precaution against the very remote possibility that the baron did in fact have a plan of action in mind.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps, if you\u2019re prepared, nothing will happen,\u201d the abbess declared.</p><p>Nicholaa was dressed and pacing in earnest by the crack of dawn. She wore her favorite cream-colored chainse and royal blue bliaut for the simple reason that her mother had helped her stitch the garments and the clothing always made her mood lighten. The material was too thin for the harsh winter weather, but she wasn\u2019t going outside so that didn\u2019t matter.</p><p>She declined the invitation to join the sisters for morning prayers, knowing full well she\u2019d do more squirming than praying and would certainly distract the others.</p><p>Her trusted servant, Alice, came to give her weekly report a scant hour later. The elderly woman was sweet-tempered, extremely loyal to her mistress, and had a strong memory for details. She was fifteen years older than Nicholaa, yet clung to the youthful habit of giggling whenever she was nervous.</p><p>Alice was giggling when she rushed into the vestibule where Nicholaa waited for her. \u201cIt\u2019s just as we suspected, milady,\u201d Alice blurted out. She managed a quick curtsy, then continued. \u201cBaron Hugh has settled in for a nice long stay at the castle, and Baron Royce is preparing to come and fetch you.\u201d</p><p>Nicholaa took hold of Alice\u2019s hand and pulled her to the window. She motioned for her servant to sit down on the bench and then sat down next to her.</p> <p>\u201cWere you able to find out how he plans to persuade me to leave this sanctuary?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Alice shook her head so vehemently that wisps of gray hair flew free from her braid. \u201cWe\u2019ve all been guessing and guessing, milady, but not one of us has been able to come up with a single possibility. Baron Royce holds his own counsel. Clarise has taken on the duty of eavesdropping on the two men, but neither has spoken of this trickery, milady. You would think Baron Hugh would be interested in knowing just how Baron Royce plans to snatch you away from here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClarise is being careful, isn\u2019t she? I wouldn\u2019t want her to get into trouble because of me.\u201d</p><p>Alice giggled again. \u201cClarise is just as loyal to you as the rest of your staff. Why, she\u2019d give her life to keep you safe.\u201d</p><p>Nicholaa shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t want her to give her life for me. Nor you either, Alice. You take too many chances coming here, though, God\u2019s truth, I do look forward to hearing the news from home.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019Tis called Rosewood now,\u201d Alice whispered.</p><p>She nodded when Nicholaa looked so surprised. \u201cThey\u2019ve named my home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was Hugh who gave it the name. Your Baron Royce didn\u2019t seem to mind. Then afore you knew it, even the staff was calling the place Rosewood. It\u2019s got a nice sound to it, doesn\u2019t it, milady?\u201d</p><p>Alice didn\u2019t give her mistress time to answer. \u201cI\u2019ve got to speak the truth, milady. The two barons are acting as though the place belongs to them now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat other changes have they made?\u201d Nicholaa asked.</p><p>\u201cThey found one of the passageways to the outside through the north wall and sealed it up real tight. It\u2019s the only one they\u2019ve spotted so far, though.\u201d</p><p>Nicholaa realized she was wringing her hands. She forced herself to stop the nervous action. \u201cAnd my chamber, Alice?\u201d she asked. \u201cWhich one of the infidels has taken over my room?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither,\u201d Alice replied. \u201cBaron Royce has had the door barred and won\u2019t let anyone inside. When Hugh took ill, he was given your room, but when he returned to Rosewood, he was given the larger chamber. Clarise and Ruth were given the unholy chore of cleaning the room for the Norman. Are you wanting to hear the rest of this, milady?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course,\u201d Nicholaa said. \u201cYou mustn\u2019t try to shield me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s becoming very difficult for us to hate Baron Royce,\u201d Alice confessed with yet another inappropriate giggle.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a sin to hate, and for that reason alone, we must not hate the Normans,\u201d Nicholaa said. \u201cWe can, however, thoroughly dislike them, Alice.\u201d</p><p>The servant nodded. \u201cBut even that\u2019s difficult to do,\u201d she wailed in a voice as bleak as the howling wind outside. \u201cHe called all of us together before him. We hid Hacon in the back, thinking the sight of him would remind the baron that he\u2019d boldly lied to him about you being a twin and all. And do you know what happened, milady? Baron Royce called the meeting to praise Hacon for defending his mistress. The baron asked him to kneel and give his pledge of loyalty. He didn\u2019t demand it. He asked!\u201d</p><p>Several loud giggles followed that explanation. Alice put her hand to her breast and took a deep breath. \u201cThe baron even helped Hacon to his feet after he\u2019d given his oath. Well, now, we were all put right in a muddle over that kindness. We all thought the Norman would want Hacon\u2019s head, not his loyalty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho can know what the barbarian wants?\u201d Nicholaa said.</p><p>\u201cThe baron never raises his voice to anyone, either. Clarise says it\u2019s because he\u2019s older, though certainly not as old as his friend, Baron Hugh. Myrtle spilled a full draft of ale right on Baron Royce\u2019s trencher of food, and do you know he didn\u2019t raise his hand against her? Nay, he just moved to another spot at the table and went right on having a conversation with his friend.\u201d</p><p>Nicholaa didn\u2019t want to hear any more about Royce. \u201cHow is Baron Hugh?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cSinging your praises, milady,\u201d Alice answered. \u201cHe told Baron Royce it was you who took care of him, you who sat by his side during the dark nights when he was so fevered, you who held a damp cloth to his brow and offered him comfort\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did not offer him comfort,\u201d Nicholaa interrupted, her voice emphatic. \u201cI was just helping Sister Felicity. You know how old and tired she is, Alice. And since I was sitting up at night by Justin\u2019s side, I only added Hugh to my duties. That\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaron Hugh says you\u2019ve got a kind heart. Now, don\u2019t take to frowning, mistress. It\u2019s the truth. Hugh also said you beat him fair and fast at chess time and again.\u201d</p><p>Nicholaa smiled. \u201cHugh was bored with his confinement,\u201d she explained, \u201cand giving the abbess one tantrum after another, demanding to be let up. I played chess to help her, not to entertain the Norman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaron Hugh smiled when he spoke of you, but he frowned fierce whenever Justin\u2019s name cropped up. He told how your brother threw the tray of food at you. Then Baron Royce took to frowning, too. He\u2019s a pure fright when he scowls, isn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t notice,\u201d Nicholaa replied. \u201cNeither of the Normans could possibly understand the torment Justin is going through,\u201d she whispered. \u201cNow, please, tell me all about Ulric. How is my dear nephew doing?\u201d</p><p>Alice smiled. \u201cHe\u2019s a handful, that one is, now that he\u2019s taken to crawling. Another tooth poked through just the day before yesterday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it too soon?\u201d Nicholaa asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, no,\u201d Alice answered. \u201cUlric\u2019s doing just what he\u2019s supposed to be doing at his tender age. You haven\u2019t had much experience with babies, so you\u2019ll have to be taking my word on this.\u201d</p><p>Nicholaa nodded. \u201cI wish I\u2019d brought him here with me. I worry about him, Alice. Oh, I know you and Clarise are doing a fine job of caring for him, but I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou made the right decision,\u201d Alice interjected. \u201cYou had no way of knowing if you\u2019d make it to the abbey without being caught,\u201d she reminded her mistress. \u201cAnd the weather would have chilled Ulric through to his bones. Besides, what would you have told your escort? They thought you were Sister Danielle, remember? Rest your frown, milady. Ulric\u2019s safe at Rosewood. It\u2019s just as we predicted it would be,\u201d she added with a nod. \u201cThe Normans don\u2019t pay any attention to the babe. They\u2019re still believing your lie that he\u2019s just the son of a servant. Clarise keeps him abovestairs all the time. Why, I\u2019m thinking Baron Royce doesn\u2019t even remember he\u2019s there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI pray to God his father\u2019s still alive,\u201d Nicholaa whispered. \u201cThe longer we go without word, the more convinced I become that Thurston\u2019s dead, Alice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t think such dour thoughts,\u201d Alice ordered. She used the hem of her bliaut to mop at the corners of her eyes. \u201cYou\u2019ve had a time of it, haven\u2019t you? Now listen to me. God wouldn\u2019t be so cruel as to take both Ulric\u2019s mama and his papa. Your older brother must still be alive. You mustn\u2019t give up hope.\u201d</p><p>Nicholaa nodded. \u201cNo, I mustn\u2019t give up hope.\u201d</p><p>Alice patted her mistress\u2019s hand. \u201cBaron Royce believes you\u2019ve been married,\u201d she announced. \u201cThat fool, James, thinks the wedding to Roulf took place. We\u2019re all snickering over that one, we are. That know-it-all traitor doesn\u2019t know everything, does he? I\u2019m hoping Baron Royce will toss James out on his backside when he finds out the truth.\u201d</p><p>Bennett and Oscar, two of the stable hands, came to escort Alice back to the holding. As soon as the three loyal servants took their leave, Nicholaa hurried back up to the sickroom to sit by Justin\u2019s side.</p><p>Her brother\u2019s mood was as stormy as the weather. When he finally fell asleep, Nicholaa leaned over him to pull the covers up around his shoulders. His right hand slammed into the side of her face\u2014quite by accident, for he was sleeping now, but the blow was still powerful enough to knock Nicholaa to the floor.</p><p>Justin had caught her below the right eye, and she knew from the horrid throbbing she was feeling that she would wear a dark bruise by nightfall.</p><p>She left Justin alone and resumed her pacing. Every now and again she would pause at the window to look outside. By midafternoon she was convinced that whatever plan Royce had decided upon had somehow failed.</p><p>She was just about to pull the heavy animal skin back over the opening when the sound of thunder drew her attention. Men on horseback were racing around the bend in the road. The contingent of soldiers numbered at least fifty. They stopped when they reached the bottom of the steep path that led up to the doors of the abbey. The soldiers who\u2019d been keeping guard around the perimeter of the walls then joined the ranks. When they were added to the unit, the number swelled to over seventy.</p><p>One warrior separated himself from the others and nudged his mount up the hill. From the size of horse and rider, she knew it was Royce.</p><p>He\u2019d come for her after all.</p><p>Nicholaa backed away from the window, but kept her gaze directed on him.</p><p>Sunlight bounced off his open faced helmet and the metal rings sewn into his leather chest armor. It was the dead of winter, and yet his arms were bare. Nicholaa shivered. Royce suddenly seemed invincible to her.</p><p>She had to shake her head. He was just a man, she reminded herself. A man who would soon freeze to death, she hoped. Nicholaa saw his sword strapped to his side, but she didn\u2019t see a shield. He was still armed for battle\u2014or for the journey through hostile land to London.</p><p>Royce stopped when he reached the center of the path. He sat there a long while, looking up at the abbey.</p><p>What was he waiting for? Did he actually think she would come outside? She shook her head and smiled. The Norman could sit atop his stallion for the rest of the day for all the care she would give. She wouldn\u2019t be so easily intimidated.</p><p>Royce sent a messenger up to the abbey\u2019s iron gates and waited until he was certain Nicholaa had been informed of his arrival.</p><p>The abbess found Nicholaa standing near the window. \u201cBaron Royce asks that you look out the window, Nicholaa. He says he has a message for you.\u201d</p><p>Nicholaa moved to the center of the opening so that Royce could see her. She stood with her hands folded in front of her, trying to look serene and confident. She wasn\u2019t certain that he could see her expression, but she wasn\u2019t taking any chances. She was worried, yes, but the Norman wouldn\u2019t know it. Besides, she told herself again, he was bluffing.</p><p>Royce waited until he spotted her in the window, then slowly removed the heavy blankets protecting the baby he cradled in his arms.</p><p>Ulric was sound asleep, but his face scrunched up into a frown when the cold air reached him. \u201cYou\u2019ll be warm in just a minute,\u201d Royce promised.</p><p>He lifted the baby high into the air and waited for a reaction.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t long in coming. Lady Nicholaa suddenly disappeared from the window. Her scream of outrage lingered in the room. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ulric had just filled his lungs with the intention of letting out an outraged bellow of his own when Royce gently wrapped him up in his cocoon of blankets. The warmth soothed the baby, and he began to suckle diligently on his chubby fists.</p><p>The slurping noise made Royce smile. He pulled the blanket back so he could see the baby\u2019s face and was rewarded with a grin. Four sparkling white teeth, two on top and two on the bottom, were visible when Ulric removed his fist from his mouth. Drool covered the baby\u2019s chin and cheeks. Royce awkwardly mopped the wetness away and then thought to dismiss the child by again covering his face.</p><p>Ulric had other intentions. He immediately arched his back into a bow, let out a loud, thoroughly undisciplined scream, and then started kicking.</p><p>Royce had absolutely no experience handling such a little baby. His three younger sisters had children, yes, but he\u2019d never spent any time with them. As to that, he wasn\u2019t even sure how many nieces and nephews he had. He didn\u2019t have any idea why Ulric was upset. The baby was warm and protected, and that should have been quite enough. Royce had, after all, patiently waited until the servant, Clarise, had fed the child.</p> <p>The baby had absolutely nothing to complain about.</p><p>He pulled the covers away from the baby\u2019s face. \u201cGo back to sleep,\u201d he ordered in a soft but firm voice. Ulric quit squirming long enough to smile up at Royce. The baby looked absolutely ridiculous with his hair standing on end. Royce couldn\u2019t help smiling back.</p><p>He then decided he\u2019d spent enough time soothing the child and once again pulled the covers over the baby\u2019s face. \u201cNow you will go back to sleep.\u201d</p><p>Ulric let out another bellow. Royce spotted Nicholaa then. She came running through the open gates with her hair flying out behind her, paying no heed to the weather, for she hadn\u2019t even taken the time to put a cloak around her shoulders in her haste to get to Ulric.</p><p>His plan had worked. Royce was relieved\u2014not so much at having tricked her into leaving the abbey as to be rid of the squirming infant.</p> <p>Nicholaa flew down the hill at a breakneck run. She was out of breath but full of fury when she finally reached Royce. \u201cGive me that baby,\u201d she demanded in a hoarse shout.</p><p>She was so infuriated that she couldn\u2019t stop herself from slapping his leg.</p><p>\u201cIs Ulric your son, Nicholaa?\u201d</p><p>She hesitated for only a fraction of a second before nodding. \u201cYes, he\u2019s my son.\u201d</p><p>He knew she was lying. Again. He let out a sigh. The fear he saw in her gaze made him hold his silence. He wouldn\u2019t challenge her now. She had lied because she was afraid. She couldn\u2019t possibly understand him. He knew she was trying to protect the child from harm. Royce was her enemy, and he could well imagine the foul stories she\u2019d been fed about the Normans.</p><p>\u201cUlric\u2019s safe, Nicholaa. No harm will come to him.\u201d</p> <p>After making that promise, he reached down to her, offering her his hand.</p><p>She shoved it away. \u201cGive him to me. Now.\u201d</p><p>He would have liked nothing better than to hand the child down to her, for Ulric was at it again, squirming, kicking, howling, too, but Royce wasn\u2019t about to let Nicholaa have the upper hand. She wasn\u2019t the one giving the orders, and the sooner she understood that, the better. The journey would be difficult enough without her challenging him every step of the way.</p><p>Ulric had gone into a rage of rebellion. Royce turned his attention to calming him. He gently turned the infant so that his back rested against the cloak covering his chest. He then removed the blanket from his face, for the babe did seem determined to look around him. He mopped his face again, too. Then he finally turned his gaze back to Nicholaa.</p><p>The bluster had gone out of her anger. Royce was being incredibly gentle with Ulric. The warrior had such big hands, and yet he wasn\u2019t at all awkward with the infant. Ulric liked him, too. The baby kept tilting his head back and grinning up at his captor.</p><p>He was only a baby. He didn\u2019t know any better, she told herself. She finally turned her gaze to Royce. They stared at each other for a long minute while Ulric gurgled out his new sounds. The baby was very content.</p><p>Nicholaa couldn\u2019t hold Royce\u2019s stare long. She started shivering and couldn\u2019t decide if the chills were due to the weather or the giant\u2019s glacial stare.</p><p>\u201cThe game\u2019s over, Nicholaa. I\u2019ve won. If this were a chess match, I would say checkmate,\u201d he said. \u201cAdmit your defeat and I\u2019ll show you mercy.\u201d</p> <p>The amusement in his voice was more infuriating to her than his arrogant boast. She looked up at him again and saw that he was trying hard not to laugh at her.</p><p>The man was literally gloating with victory. She slapped his leg again. \u201cIf this were a game, your move would not be checkmate, Baron, but check, for you\u2019ve only cornered me with this devil\u2019s move. Aye, this game isn\u2019t over yet.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cYou\u2019re in an untenable position, Nicholaa. Give up this foolish struggle and accept what cannot be changed.\u201d</p><p>He had the gall to smile at her. She disliked him intensely for that. How could she have thought he was the least bit handsome? The man was a monster to use a baby to get his way. Why, he\u2019d deliberately put Ulric in jeopardy just to gain the advantage.</p><p>Nicholaa realized that, in all honesty, the baby wasn\u2019t in any jeopardy. She was candid enough with herself to admit that truth. Ulric was safe. There was a full army within shouting distance to keep the baby safe from attack, and he was well protected in the Norman\u2019s arms.</p><p>No, Ulric wasn\u2019t in any jeopardy, but she was. It was only a matter of minutes before she would be turned into a block of ice by the wind.</p><p>Nicholaa rubbed her arms and stomped her feet in an effort to take the sting out of her toes. \u201cGive me my son,\u201d she demanded again, though her voice lacked conviction now.</p><p>\u201cIs he your son?\u201d</p><p>Before she could answer that question, Ulric gurgled out a word: \u201cMama.\u201d Since the baby was looking at her, she seized the opportunity.</p><p>\u201cOf course he is,\u201d she announced. \u201cYou just heard him call me Mama.\u201d</p><p>His exasperation was obvious. \u201cMadam, in the past five minutes this babe has called me, my horse, and his fists Mama. You\u2019re trying my patience,\u201d he added with a frown. \u201cAre you determined to stand there until you freeze to death or will you concede defeat?\u201d</p><p>She nibbled on her lower lip for a long minute before giving him answer. \u201cI\u2019ll concede only that you\u2019ve bested me by means of sinful trickery, but that\u2019s all I\u2019m going to concede.\u201d</p><p>It was enough to satisfy him. He lifted his cloak from where it was draped across his thighs and tossed it down to her.</p><p>\u201cPut this on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d whispered those words, and he wasn\u2019t certain he\u2019d heard her correctly. \u201cWhat did you just say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d he asked, his puzzlement obvious.</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cFor a kindness given,\u201d she explained. \u201cThere is never a good reason for rudeness, Baron. We Saxons understand that, but I assume from the look on your face that Normans do not. \u2019Tis yet another reason you should go back where you belong and leave England alone. Our cultures are too different to mix.\u201d</p><p>God, she was exasperating. He let out a sigh. \u201cAre all the Saxons as daft as you?\u201d</p><p>She clutched the edges of his heavy cloak around her shoulders and glared at him. \u201cWe aren\u2019t daft. We\u2019re civilized.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cSo civilized that Saxon men and women paint their bodies? Don\u2019t shake your head at me. I\u2019ve seen the pagan designs drawn on the Saxon soldiers\u2019 arms and faces. Even your church leaders think it quite decadent.\u201d</p><p>The man had a valid argument there, but she wasn\u2019t about to admit it. She, too, thought it a bit decadent the way some of the Saxons painted themselves. However, this was a ridiculous conversation to be having right now.</p><p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t you just leave me alone?\u201d</p><p>The anguish in her voice caught him off guard. One minute she was arguing with him about his manners, and the next she was pleading with him and looking ready to weep.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like nothing better than to leave you alone, but it is my duty to take you to London, and it\u2019s your duty to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo become some man\u2019s prize? Isn\u2019t that the real reason I\u2019m being dragged to London?\u201d</p><p>She was bloody furious again. Her changes of mood occurred so swiftly that he was amazed. And pleased. He much preferred an angry woman to a weeping one.</p><p>\u201cI hadn\u2019t planned to drag you all the way to London, but the idea has merit.\u201d</p><p>The amusement in his voice made her want to scream. \u201cYou do try my patience,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>\u201cAnd you mine,\u201d he announced when she pushed his outstretched hand away a second time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I\u2019m going to London, then I shall walk there. I won\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>She never got to finish her threat, because he took matters into his hands. Literally. Before she realized his intention, he leaned to one side of the saddle, grabbed her around the middle, and lifted her up onto his lap. It happened so quickly she didn\u2019t even have time to gasp. Her bottom landed on his hard thighs. Her back was slammed up against his chest, and his arm became an anchor around her waist.</p><p>Ulric was tucked under one of his arms. The baby\u2019s lusty laugh indicated he was thoroughly enjoying being jostled about.</p><p>Nicholaa hated being so close to her captor. His size overwhelmed her. The heat and the strength radiating from him made her feel horribly vulnerable.</p><p>She fought this fresh spurt of fear, but she knew she was losing the battle when she started trembling again. It was actually her captor who made her terror subside. He handed Ulric to her and then took time\u2014and care, she couldn\u2019t help but notice\u2014to adjust his cloak around her shoulders. He tucked the heavy garment around her legs and even offered her his warmth when by pulling her back against his chest. He was being extremely gentle with her, as gentle as he\u2019d been with little Ulric.</p><p>He smelled nice, too. She let out a little sigh. He wasn\u2019t a monster after all. God\u2019s truth, that admission took the wind right out of her. The fear, too. She realized she couldn\u2019t dislike him as much as she wanted to, and then she found her first smile. Heaven help her, she\u2019d never been good at holding a grudge or disliking anyone as thoroughly as she was supposed to dislike him.</p><p>She mulled that truth over for a minute or two and came up with an alternative. She couldn\u2019t hate him, for that would be a sin. She could, however, make his life a living hell during the short time they spent together. Odd, but that plan cheered her considerably. The possibilities, after all, were endless.</p><p>The Norman barbarian deserved every inconvenience she could give him. He was the one who insisted on taking her to London, and any misery she could give him would be his just reward.</p><p>Nicholaa turned her attention to the baby. She cuddled him against her bosom, kissed the top of his head. Ulric let out a happy gurgle. Absentmindedly she brushed his hair down. The strands of blond fluff sprang right back up.</p><p>Royce watched her. \u201cWhy does his hair do that?\u201d he asked.</p><p>He\u2019d whispered that question close to her ear. She kept her gaze directed on the baby. \u201cDo what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStand up on end,\u201d he said. \u201cHe looks as if he\u2019d just suffered a fright.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t help but smile. Ulric did look silly. And adorable. She didn\u2019t let the Norman see her amusement, though. \u201cHe\u2019s perfect,\u201d she announced.</p><p>He didn\u2019t agree or disagree.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t plan to take Ulric to London with us, do you, Baron? The journey would be too difficult for him.\u201d</p><p>He ignored her question and nudged his stallion forward. They stopped when they reached the iron gates. He dismounted in one fluid motion. \u201cYou will wait here,\u201d he ordered. He put his hand on her thigh. \u201cDo you understand me?\u201d</p><p>His grip stung. She put her hand on top of his to push him away. She wasn\u2019t going to obey any order he gave her. Then he captured her fingers and started squeezing. \u201cI understand. I\u2019ll stay here,\u201d she lied, hoping that the lie didn\u2019t qualify as a sin, since the Norman was her enemy and God was still on her side. God would help her get away, she reasoned. As soon as the Norman went inside the abbey, she and Ulric would take to the north road.</p><p>And then what? The baron\u2019s men would surely notice she was leaving.</p><p>She completely discarded the plan when Royce took Ulric into his arms.</p><p>\u201cGive him back to me,\u201d she demanded.</p><p>He shook his head.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking to do?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI told you to stay there,\u201d he commanded when she started to dismount.</p><p>His voice hadn\u2019t risen above a whisper, but the sternness in his tone got her full attention. \u201cGive me my son and I\u2019ll do whatever you ask.\u201d</p><p>He pretended he hadn\u2019t heard her. Nicholaa waited until he went inside the abbey. She was left to fret a good ten minutes before he came outside again.</p><p>The baby wasn\u2019t with him. Royce carried her baggage, though, and once he\u2019d secured it to the back of the saddle, he remounted behind her.</p><p>\u201cWill the abbess see that Ulric is taken back home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>She waited for him to explain in full, but after he\u2019d settled her on his lap and covered her with his cloak, the rude man still didn\u2019t say another word.</p><p>\u201cWho will take care of Ulric?\u201d</p><p>The worry in her voice softened his attitude. \u201cUlric\u2019s going to stay at the abbey until your future has been decided.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you get the abbess to agree to tend Ulric?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI offered her a bargain she couldn\u2019t resist,\u201d Royce replied.</p><p>She could hear the amusement in his voice. She tried to turn so she could see his expression, but he forced her to stay where she was. \u201cWhat was this bargain?\u201d</p><p>They started back down the hill before he answered her. \u201cIn return for the favor of looking after Ulric, I promised to see that Justin is taken care of,\u201d he said.</p><p>She was astonished. \u201cHow could you make such a bargain? Justin\u2019s dying, or have you forgotten?\u201d</p><p>His sigh was long. \u201cHe isn\u2019t dying,\u201d he said. \u201cSomewhere in that mind of yours I think you know I\u2019m speaking the truth. Justin might not want to live, but he\u2019s going to, Nicholaa.\u201d</p><p>When she started to answer him, he put his hand over her mouth. \u201cIn the past two months there have been many changes in your country. England is ours now, and William is as much your king as mine.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Nicholaa was completely disheartened. He spoke the truth, and she wasn\u2019t naive enough to pretend otherwise. She\u2019d heard about some of the changes, too. Even though the abbey was isolated, the nuns kept abreast of the latest happenings. Nicholaa was well aware that the Saxon defense had crumbled on the fields of Hastings.</p><p>\u201cYou still had no right to make such a promise to the abbess. Justin\u2019s my brother. I\u2019ll take care of him,\u201d she said.</p><p>He shook his head.</p><p>She wanted to hit him. \u201cIf you had an ounce of compassion inside you, you\u2019d let me stay by my brother\u2019s side during this unsettling time and give him the comfort he needs.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe last thing your brother needs is comfort.\u201d</p><p>He sounded so sure of himself. Odd, but his attitude made her feel a glimmer of hope, a possibility that he might hold the answer to Justin\u2019s future. She\u2019d been so terrified for her brother. What was going to become of him? How could he ever learn to make it on his own in this cold world?</p><p>\u201cWhat is it you think he needs?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cSomeone to teach him how to survive. Compassion won\u2019t keep him alive. Proper training will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t forgotten Justin has only one hand?\u201d</p> <p>There was a smile in his voice when he answered her. \u201cI haven\u2019t forgotten.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYet you believe you could train him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s what I do, Nicholaa,\u201d he patiently explained. \u201cI\u2019m a trainer of men.\u201d</p><p>She was stunned by the commitment he\u2019d just made to Justin. She was terrified, too. Could she really trust this man? \u201cWhat happens to this promise of yours when you return to Normandy?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf I return to Normandy, Justin will go with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she cried out. \u201cI won\u2019t let you take my brother away from me.\u201d</p><p>He heard the panic in her voice. He gave her a squeeze to calm her. He understood her distress, of course. She\u2019d already lost one brother to the war, if he\u2019d heard correctly, and it was apparent to Royce that she felt complete responsibility for Justin\u2019s welfare. She carried a heavy burden on her shoulders, too heavy, he thought, for someone of her young age.</p><p>\u201cJustin would return to England as soon as his training is completed. There is also a chance that I\u2019ll stay here, Nicholaa.\u201d</p><p>God, she hoped he would stay in England. For Justin\u2019s sake only, she qualified. Nicholaa felt such relief. The baron would keep his word. She didn\u2019t have a single doubt about that now.</p><p>\u201cI still don\u2019t understand how you could take on the responsibility for a Saxon soldier, Baron, when you\u2014\u201d</p><p>His hand covered her mouth again. \u201cWe are finished with this discussion,\u201d he announced. \u201cI\u2019ve been extremely patient with you, Nicholaa. I\u2019ve allowed you to express your concerns, and I\u2019ve explained my position. We\u2019ve wasted enough time.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t agree with that rude dictate. He had his way, though. He goaded his mount into motion again, making conversation impossible.</p> <p>He set a hard pace. There was one amusing moment, though, when he paused at the foot of the hill to collect his shield. The soldier holding it obviously thought to impress his baron by tossing it to him. The weight proved to be too heavy for the soldier, though, and the kite-shaped shield ended up on the ground between the two mounts.</p><p>Nicholaa almost laughed out loud until she saw the horrified expression on the young soldier\u2019s face. She couldn\u2019t add to his humiliation by openly laughing at him. She bit her lower lip, turned her gaze to her lap, and simply waited to see what Royce would do.</p><p>He never said a word. She heard his sigh, though, and almost lost her composure then and there. He must have guessed she was amused. He squeezed her around the waist, a silent message, she supposed, for her to remain silent.</p><p>The poor soldier finally regained his wits and went to fetch the shield. His face was bright red when he picked it up.</p><p>And still Royce didn\u2019t chasten him. He accepted his shield and then took over the lead. Just as soon as they were out of earshot of the embarrassed soldier, Nich\u00f3laa gave in to her urge and started laughing.</p><p>She thought he might laugh, too. It had been amusing, after all. He didn\u2019t laugh, though, and when he pulled the top of his cloak down over her head, she came to the conclusion that he took exception to her own laughter.</p><p>There wasn\u2019t much to laugh about during the rest of the long day. They made camp when it became too dark to continue. Nicholaa was beginning to think Royce was actually a tolerable man to be around. He made certain she was warm, well fed, and even fashioned a tent for her near one of the fires.</p><p>Then he ruined her good opinion of him by reminding her why he was taking her to London. He spoke of an immediate marriage and kept referring to her as the king\u2019s prize.</p><p>She began making her escape plans then. She pretended to be very docile, exhausted, too, and waited for her opportunity.</p><p>Royce gave her his cloak again as an added blanket to cover herself. She thanked him for that consideration.</p><p>He laughed.</p><p>Nicholaa was about to go inside the tent when she suddenly stopped and turned around. \u201cRoyce?\u201d</p><p>He was surprised she\u2019d used his name. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo matter what happens to me, you cannot break your promise to the abbess. You have to take care of Justin, isn\u2019t that right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he answered. \u201cThe promise can\u2019t be broken.\u201d</p><p>She was satisfied. She pretended to fall asleep a few minutes later. Her plan was set in her mind. She would sneak away from the camp just as soon as the soldiers had all settled down for the night. She knew the area well. The forest was part of Baron Norland\u2019s holding to the south of her own estate. It was a fair walk back to the abbey, though. Nicholaa thought it might take her an entire day to get there. She\u2019d have to keep to the trees, she thought with a yawn, and avoid the broken north road as much as possible.</p><p>The warmth from the fire and her own real fatigue overtook her good intentions then, and she fell asleep.</p><p>Royce waited until he was certain she really was fast asleep, then sat down on the ground directly across from her. He leaned back against a fat tree and closed his eyes. He didn\u2019t think she\u2019d try to run away until the camp had quieted down for the night. That would give him an hour or two to gain a little rest . . . and peace.</p><p>Nicholaa came awake with a start in the middle of the night. She spotted Royce immediately. She stared at him for a long while, until she was absolutely certain he was sleeping.</p><p>He looked very peaceful\u2014content, too. He\u2019d placed his helmet on the ground beside him. His left arm rested on the headgear, his hand only inches away from the sword strapped to his side.</p><p>He was a handsome one all right. His hair was dark and much longer than was customary, even for barbaric Normans. It was a rich, dark brown, given to curl, too.</p><p>Nicholaa shivered with disgust. How could she be thinking what a fit man he was when he was determined to ruin her life? He considered her a mere possession, a trinket to be given to a knight.</p><p>The injustice of it got her moving. She found her shoes buried under the blankets. Her toes stung when she slipped the shoes on. The wind was bitter cold tonight. The long walk back to the abbey was a dreaded ordeal ahead of her. She almost let out a loud sigh just thinking about it.</p><p>Nicholaa wrapped herself in Royce\u2019s cloak and silently made her way to the woods beyond the small clearing. None of the soldiers paid her much attention, though one of the three men standing near the second fire did glance her way. When he didn\u2019t call out to her, Nicholaa assumed he thought she needed a few minutes of privacy.</p><p>As soon as she turned her back, Royce motioned to the soldiers to stay where they were. He waited only a minute or two, then stood, stretched the cramps out of his legs, and went after her.</p><p>He had expected her to make this move, and she hadn\u2019t disappointed him. The woman was courageous to brave such harsh conditions just to get away from him. Foolish, he thought to himself, but courageous all the same.</p><p>Nicholaa started running as soon as she\u2019d edged her way through the denser foliage. In the light from the half-moon she wasn\u2019t able to see every little obstacle in her path. It was treacherous going. She was as careful as she could be, until she thought she heard someone behind her. She kept on running, but turned to see if one of the soldiers was chasing her.</p><p>She tripped over a rotting log and went flying head first down a deep ravine. She had enough of her wits left to shield her head and turn to one side before she hit the ground.</p><p>She landed with a thud. And a curse. She lost one of her shoes in the fall and Royce\u2019s heavy cloak, too, and when she finally sat up, she was a sorry sight to behold. There were more leaves than curls in her hair, and she was covered with dirt.</p><p>Royce stood in the shadows and waited. The daft woman could have broken her neck. Yet the loud, unladylike muttering he heard told him she was all right, just furious. She was cursing loud enough to wake the nuns back at the abbey.</p><p>She\u2019d never make a proper chess mate. She didn\u2019t know how to calculate her moves. She wouldn\u2019t make a true enemy, either. He\u2019d already concluded that she didn\u2019t have it in her nature to hate . . . or to retaliate. She didn\u2019t even know how to hold a grudge. Royce smiled, remembering how she\u2019d questioned him about keeping his promise to look after Justin, no matter what happened to her. He\u2019d known then she\u2019d try to escape. Her thoughts were so easy to read, her every expression so refreshingly honest and transparent.</p><p>A tightness settled inside his chest. Nicholaa was like a fragile flower, so delicate, so incredibly soft, so beautiful.</p><p>His delicate little flower was muttering the most searing curses he\u2019d ever heard. None of the phrases made any sense.</p><p>Her burst of temper was short-lived, though. She was ashamed of herself for using such coarse words. She made a quick sign of the cross to placate her Maker, and then stood up. As soon as she put her weight on her left foot, hot pain shot up her calf.</p><p>Nicholaa let out a loud cry and fell to the ground. She sat there a long minute debating what to do. When Royce heard her whimper, he started toward her.</p><p>Nicholaa finally admitted defeat. She shouted for help.</p><p>He was standing by her side before she\u2019d finished her plea. She was in too much pain to notice it hadn\u2019t taken him any time at all to reach her.</p><p>He had her shoe in his hand. He dropped it into her lap, then dropped down on one knee beside her.</p><p>She thought he looked exasperated. \u201cIf you say \u2018Check\u2019 to me now, I\u2019ll scream.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou already did scream,\u201d he replied, his tone gratingly cheerful. \u201cAnd it\u2019s \u2018checkmate,\u2019 Nicholaa. The game\u2019s over.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t in the mood to argue with him. She turned her gaze to her lap. \u201cI fell,\u201d she announced, stating the obvious. \u201cI believe I\u2019ve broken my ankle.\u201d</p><p>She sounded pitiful. She looked sorry, too. Her hair hung over her face in total disarray, her gown was torn around the shoulders, and she was covered with dead leaves.</p><p>Royce didn\u2019t say a word, just leaned forward to examine the damage. She cried out in pain before he\u2019d even touched her.</p><p>\u201cNicholaa, it\u2019s common to wait until you\u2019ve felt the pain before you complain,\u201d he explained.</p><p>\u201cI was preparing,\u201d she snapped.</p><p>He hid his smile. He was already certain the ankle wasn\u2019t broken. There wasn\u2019t a hint of swelling around the bone. She could move her toes without crying out, too, another sure indication to him that she\u2019d merely bruised herself.</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t broken.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t believe him. She leaned forward, instinctively placing her hand on his arm for balance, to see for herself that her ankle was all right. Her face was just inches away from his. She stared at her foot while he stared at her.</p><p>\u201cIt looks broken,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMust you sound so cheerful? I would have your sympathy over this unfortunate tragic mishap,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cThis \u2018tragic mishap\u2019 wouldn\u2019t have happened if you hadn\u2019t been trying to\u2014\u201d</p><p>She interrupted him. \u201cI was trying to gain a few minutes privacy to take care of a rather personal matter.\u201d</p><p>She looked right at him when she told that lie. It was a mistake, for only then did she discover how very close to him she was.</p><p>Their gazes held for the longest while. Neither said a word. Nicholaa couldn\u2019t seem to catch her breath.</p><p>Royce couldn\u2019t either. He didn\u2019t know what to make of his reaction to her. The urge to touch her was overwhelming. He couldn\u2019t stop himself from gently brushing her hair back away from her face. His fingers gently touched her cheek.</p><p>Nicholaa was comforted by the caress. The feeling didn\u2019t last long, though, for he was suddenly scowling at her. Her eyes widened. His hand gripped her chin, and he forced her head to one side, towards the moonlight. Then he pushed her hair farther away from her eye with his other hand.</p><p>\u201cHow did you get this bruise?\u201d he demanded. His voice was rough, angry.</p><p>She shrugged.</p><p>He squeezed her chin. \u201cAnswer me. This couldn\u2019t have just happened, Nicholaa. The mark is too dark.\u201d His frown intensified. \u201cBut it wasn\u2019t there this afternoon. I would have noticed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was too there this afternoon,\u201d she told him. \u201cIt just wasn\u2019t as noticeable. Why are you so angry? It\u2019s my bruise, not yours.\u201d</p><p>He ignored that remark. \u201cHow did it happen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not your concern.\u201d</p><p>She pushed his hand away and pulled back. The stubborn man followed her. He nudged her chin back up with the crook of his fingers.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m weary of your stubbornness, woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs weary as I am of your constant orders?\u201d</p><p>She thought that was a rather cunning reply. She was giving back as much as she was getting, she thought. Besides, the Norman needed to know he wasn\u2019t dealing with a timid, frightened adversary. He wasn\u2019t going to intimidate her. He\u2019d better not turn his back on her, either, for if she had a dagger, she\u2019d plunge the blade deep between his shoulder blades.</p><p>God save her, she was lying to herself now. She couldn\u2019t kill him. And in the corner of her mind, she thought he might know that.</p><p>She let out a frustrated sigh. She noticed a lock of hair had fallen forward to rest on his forehead. Before she could think about what she was doing, she reached up and brushed the hair back where it belonged.</p><p>He acted as though she\u2019d just smacked him. He jerked back, looking incredulous. She was so embarrassed by his reaction that she turned her gaze away. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It took him a moment to recover from her bold action. His voice was gruff when he said, \u201cEvery mark on your body is my concern, Nicholaa. I\u2019m responsible for you. Now tell me how you came by this injury.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll get surly if I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been watching you,\u201d she answered. \u201cIt\u2019s important for one enemy to know how the other\u2019s mind works, Baron. I\u2019ve been studying you closely and am now convinced you have a surly nature.\u201d</p> <p>He smiled at the authority in her voice. \u201cAnd what else have you noticed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t like me.\u201d</p><p>She waited for a contradiction. When none came, she continued. \u201cYou think I\u2019m a nuisance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I do.\u201d</p><p>She took exception to that bit of honesty. \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t a mortal sin to hate, I could become very good at hating you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, you couldn\u2019t,\u201d he answered, smiling gently. The look in his eyes made her stomach quiver. \u201cI may have an unpleasant nature, Nicholaa, but you have a very gentle one. You don\u2019t know how to hate.\u201d</p><p>She was too weary to trade insults with him. \u201cI\u2019m going to freeze if I don\u2019t return to the fire,\u201d she announced. \u201cAre you waiting for me to beg for your assistance?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m waiting to hear how you came by this bruise,\u201d he informed her.</p><p>Lord, he was stubborn. She could tell from the look on his face that he was determined to get his way. \u201cJustin struck me.\u201d</p><p>She should have softened the truth a little. Royce looked bloody furious. She didn\u2019t want him to think ill of Justin. \u201cYou cannot blame my brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hell I can\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>He started to stand. She grabbed his arm. \u201cI can explain,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cNicholaa, you can\u2019t justify what\u2014\u201d</p><p>She put her hand over his mouth. \u201cJustin was sound asleep, Royce. I was leaning over him to pull the covers up, and he turned. His fist caught me below the eye when he rolled to his side. Justin had no idea he struck me.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t look convinced.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m telling you the truth,\u201d she muttered. \u201cSaxon sisters and brothers don\u2019t strike one another. Is it because the Norman families fight like devils that you find my truth difficult to believe?\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t going to let her bait him. He picked up his cloak, wrapped it around her, and lifted her in his arms. She wrapped her arms around his neck as he headed for the camp.</p><p>She whispered thank you against his neck.</p><p>What the hell was he going to do with her? he wondered.</p> <p>She was easing herself right into his heart and he didn\u2019t have any weapons to stop her. Damn it, his life was set in a pattern, and he was too old to change. Besides, he liked the order, the discipline, of his daily routine. He was very content.</p><p>Wasn\u2019t he?</p><p>Royce tried to put the contrary woman out of his thoughts. It was difficult, though, because she was so wonderfully soft and cuddly in his arms.</p><p>She was still a nuisance. She gave him hell all the way back to camp. She was back in the mood to argue with him. He was in the mood to gag her just to gain a few minutes\u2019 peace.</p><p>When they finally reached the campsite, he carried her back to his spot by the tree. He sat down in one fluid motion that didn\u2019t even jar her, adjusted her on his lap, shoved her head down against his shoulders, and then closed his eyes.</p><p>His cloak covered her from head to foot, and his arms held her close. The heat from his body kept her nice and warm.</p><p>\u201cRoyce?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t sleep like this,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI\u2019m a married woman, after all, and I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour husband\u2019s dead.\u201d</p><p>She was surprised by the vehemence in his voice. \u201cYou can\u2019t possibly know if my beloved husband is dead or alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s dead.\u201d</p><p>Was he amused? She thought he might be, but when she tried to look at his face, he rudely shoved her head back on his shoulder again. \u201cOh, all right,\u201d she muttered. \u201cHe\u2019s dead. I\u2019m still mourning him, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wear blue to mourn him?\u201d</p><p>She hadn\u2019t thought of that. The man was a quick thinker, she realized. But then, so was she. \u201cI\u2019m mourning him in my heart,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>\u201cHow long has he been dead?\u201d</p><p>He was gently rubbing her shoulders. The soothing touch felt too good to protest. She let out a loud, unladylike yawn before answering. \u201cTwo years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re certain?\u201d</p><p>He was laughing at her all right. She could hear the amusement in his voice. \u201cYes, I\u2019m certain,\u201d she snapped. \u201c\u2019Tis the reason I\u2019m not wearing black any longer. It\u2019s been two years.\u201d</p><p>There, she\u2019d bested him, she thought to herself. She closed her eyes. Her smile was smug.</p><p>A long minute passed. She\u2019d almost drifted off to sleep when he whispered her name.</p><p>\u201cNicholaa?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow old is Ulric?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlmost eight months now.\u201d</p><p>He guessed she was too sleepy to see the error in her lies. She didn\u2019t even tense against him. \u201cBut your husband\u2019s been dead two years?\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t wait to see how she would try to get out of this one.</p><p>Her eyes flew open. \u201cMy husband\u2019s been gone just one year. Yes, exactly one full year. I specifically remember telling you so.\u201d</p><p>A good five minutes passed before he spoke again. \u201cYou aren\u2019t any good at lying, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never lie.\u201d</p><p>He squeezed her to let her know he was irritated with her. \u201cWill you concede defeat now?\u201d he asked. \u201cYou were trying to run away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you let me sleep?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cWhen you admit\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she interrupted. \u201cI was trying to run away. There, are you happy now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will not try to escape again.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t have to sound so mean-hearted when he gave her that order. Nicholaa suddenly felt like crying. She had to escape. It was the only way she could protect herself against the horrible future his overlord, William, had planned for her.</p><p>She adjusted her arms around his shoulders. Her fingers toyed absentmindedly with the hair on the back of his neck while she thought about the injustice of it all.</p><p>Her touch was driving him to distraction.</p><p>\u201cYour William is determined to give me as booty to some man, isn\u2019t he?\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>She shoved away from his shoulder and glared at him. A leaf fell out of her hair. Her face was bruised and covered with dirt. He couldn\u2019t contain his smile. Nicholaa looked as if she\u2019d just lost a tug-of-war.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a prize.\u201d</p><p>He agreed wholeheartedly. \u201cNo, you\u2019re not.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Four</p><p>After spending one long week with Lady Nicholaa, Royce decided he wasn\u2019t a very patient man, after all. By the time they reached their destination, he was ready to strangle her.</p><p>The hellion had made the journey as unpleasant as possible, and damn if she didn\u2019t try to escape three additional times.</p><p>The woman simply refused to see the futility of running away. She was sinfully stubborn. But then, so was he. He had demanded she concede defeat to him each time he caught her. He had even said the one word\u2014\u201ccheckmate\u201d\u2014that seemed to send her into a full rage, but in truth, he wasn\u2019t trying to humiliate her. He only had her best interests at heart. If she was going to survive with her spirit intact under Norman rule, she would have to be more docile. Not everyone would be as kind and as thoughtful as he was.</p><p>Royce didn\u2019t want Nicholaa to be hurt. The mere thought of anyone mistreating her made his mood blacken.</p><p>The need to protect her nagged at his conscience. He found himself lecturing her on how to behave when they reached London. Nicholaa, however, wasn\u2019t in the mood to listen to anything he had to say. When he suggested she be docile, she bit him. He let her get away with that only because she\u2019d had so little sleep over the past god-awful week, and she was simply too muddleheaded to think properly.</p><p>They reached London in midafternoon. The palace was nearly empty of guests when Royce strode inside, nearly dragging Nicholaa in his wake. He ordered two soldiers to report to William that his prize had at last arrived. Royce personally saw to the task of settling Nicholaa in her chamber.</p><p>She tried to trip him with her foot, and he really did drag her a good distance before letting her regain her balance.</p><p>He would be glad to be rid of her. Royce kept telling himself that lie until he almost believed it.</p><p>Almost.</p><p>His second-in-command, a knight several years his senior, caught up with the pair just as Royce was opening the door to Nicholaa\u2019s quarters. The soldier\u2019s name was Lawrence. He was a fit looking man with brown hair and hazel eyes. He was nearly as tall as his liege lord, but lacked the bulk and the muscle around his shoulders. Lawrence had fought by Royce\u2019s side in countless battles. He was a seasoned warrior, trustworthy, and loyal to his very soul. He was also Royce\u2019s good friend.</p><p>\u201c\u2019Tis good to see you again, my lord,\u201d Lawrence said in greeting. In his enthusiasm, he slapped Royce on his shoulder. Dust flew up into the air between the two giants. Lawrence laughed. \u201cYou\u2019re in need of a bath, Baron.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, I am,\u201d Royce answered. \u201cIt\u2019s good to be here.\u201d He glanced down at Nicholaa, matched her frown, and then added, \u201cAt last.\u201d</p><p>The implication wasn\u2019t lost on her. She knew she was the reason the journey had taken so long. Her chin came up a notch.</p><p>Lawrence was highly curious about the woman. When he turned to her, his heart skipped a beat. Lord, she was a beauty. Her eyes captivated him. They were the most unusual shade of blue he\u2019d ever seen.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t timid, either. Her gaze was direct, unwavering.</p><p>Royce was amused by his vassal\u2019s reaction. It was as telling as Ingelram\u2019s had been when he\u2019d first seen Nicholaa. Lawrence looked stunned.</p><p>\u201cThis is Lady Nicholaa,\u201d Royce announced.</p><p>Lawrence bowed low. \u201cIt is a pleasure to meet you, milady.\u201d</p><p>She curtsied in response to his politeness.</p><p>\u201cI look forward to hearing about your adventures,\u201d Lawrence said.</p><p>\u201cWhat adventures?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cFor one, I would like to hear how you came by all those bruises. You do look as though you\u2019d been in battle,\u201d he added with a gentle smile. \u201cSurely there\u2019s a story there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s prone to accidents,\u201d Royce drawled.</p><p>She let Royce see her frown. Then she turned back to Lawrence. \u201cI won\u2019t be in London long enough to tell you any stories.\u201d</p><p>She remembered Royce still had hold of her wrist when he started squeezing it. Lawrence noticed the frown on his baron\u2019s face, but couldn\u2019t understand the reason behind it. \u201cAre you going somewhere soon, milady?\u201d he inquired.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Royce said.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said at the very same instant.</p><p>Lawrence grinned. \u201cThere\u2019s a rumor, Baron, that we will be leaving for Normandy before the week is out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll discuss that later,\u201d Royce announced with a meaningful glance at Nicholaa.</p><p>The vassal nodded. He noticed that a stricken look had come over the beautiful woman\u2019s face and decided she must be exhausted from her journey. \u201cThe king will send servants to see to your comforts, Lady Nicholaa,\u201d he announced.</p><p>\u201cAnd soldiers to see that I don\u2019t escape?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Lawrence was taken aback by the vehemence in her voice. \u201cYou\u2019re not a prisoner,\u201d he announced. He gave Royce a look of puzzlement. \u201cIs she, Baron?\u201d</p><p>Royce nodded. \u201cShe is until she accepts her fate,\u201d he announced.</p><p>\u201cWilliam is your king, too,\u201d Lawrence said to Nicholaa. His voice was gentle.</p><p>\u201cNo, he isn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLawrence, it won\u2019t do you any good to argue with her.\u201d</p><p>Royce let go of Nicholaa\u2019s wrist and gave her a nudge to get her moving. She walked into the chamber, Royce and Lawrence following close behind her. \u201cI will escape,\u201d she boasted.</p><p>She went directly to the window. Royce knew what was going through her mind. \u201cYou\u2019ll break your neck if you try to jump, Nicholaa.\u201d</p><p>She turned around and smiled at him. \u201cAnd would you care, Baron?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t give her a direct answer. \u201cYour Ulric will care when he\u2019s old enough to understand. Consider him and Justin, too, Nicholaa, whenever you contemplate doing something foolish. You\u2019ll be harming your family as well as yourself.\u201d He started to pull the door closed.</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d she called out, a frantic edge in her voice.</p><p>Royce stopped and turned to face her. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>She took a step toward him. \u201cIs that it, then? You\u2019re leaving?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas there something more you wanted?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He started to leave again.</p><p>\u201cIs that all you can say to me?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>He stopped again and let out a loud sigh. \u201cWhat more do you want me to say?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes filled with tears, and she started wringing her hands.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t understand what had come over her. \u201cWhat in God\u2019s name is the matter with you?\u201d he asked, thoroughly confused by her manner.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNothing. Nothing\u2019s the matter with me. I\u2019m well rid of you, Baron. You\u2019re. rude and insufferable.\u201d A tear slipped down her cheek. She wiped it away with the back of her hand.</p><p>Hell, she acted as though he was deserting her, and heaven help him, he felt as though he was. \u201cI\u2019m not leaving for Normandy,\u201d he said then. \u201cIf you need me, send one of the soldiers with a message. He\u2019ll find me.\u201d</p><p>Her relief was visible. The panic eased from her expression, and her stance relaxed. She couldn\u2019t seem to control her tears, though, and she turned her back on him so that he wouldn\u2019t witness her disgrace. \u201cI won\u2019t be sending anyone to fetch you, Norman. Leave. I don\u2019t care.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t leave her like this. She looked so alone, so miserable . . . and so vulnerable. Damn it all, for some reason he wanted to see her strong and angry at him as she\u2019d been on their journey.</p><p>\u201cBaron?\u201d Lawrence asked when his lord continued to stand there for such a long time without saying a word. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Royce shook his head. \u201cNicholaa?\u201d he called out as he reached for the door.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do have one last thing to say to you.\u201d</p><p>She turned around to look at him. Anger, he thought to himself. The anger would make her forget her fear.</p> <p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He grinned. \u201cCheckmate.\u201d</p><p>He pulled the door closed on her outraged gasp. Royce laughed.</p><p>A loud crash sounded against the door. \u201cWhat was that?\u201d Lawrence asked.</p><p>\u201cThe water pitcher, I believe. She\u2019s feeling better.\u201d</p> <p>And so was Royce.</p><p>Nicholaa\u2019s anger kept her occupied for the better part of the day. Two women came to her chamber late that afternoon. Both were Saxons, a fact that surprised Nicholaa. One carried fresh clothing; the other brought linens. Nicholaa moved to the window when they carried a wooden tub into the room and poured it full of hot, steaming water.</p><p>The bath was too inviting to refuse. Nicholaa soaked in the rose-scented water and washed her hair until she finally felt clean.</p><p>She didn\u2019t speak to either woman until one offered to brush the tangles out of her hair. \u201cWhy do you serve the Norman king?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s England\u2019s king now,\u201d the servant named Mary answered. \u201cEveryone serves him.\u201d</p><p>Nicholaa didn\u2019t agree with the servant, but she felt it would be unkind to contradict her. Mary was entitled to her own opinion, even though she was wrong.</p> <p>Mary was about Nicholaa\u2019s age. She was a plump young woman with bright red hair and freckles that covered most of her face. The other servant, Heloise, was considerably older, and her manner was brisk and unfriendly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll never serve William,\u201d Nicholaa announced. She sat down on the stool Mary had provided and folded her hands in her lap.</p><p>Mary started to brush her hair. \u201cTalk like that will land you in trouble, milady,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Heloise was turning down the covers on the large bed. \u201cMary speaks the truth,\u201d she announced with a dour-faced nod. \u201cThose who won\u2019t kneel before King William get themselves killed. Even now a dozen Saxon soldiers are waiting for the deathblow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are these Saxon soldiers?\u201d Nicholaa asked.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re here, two floors below us,\u201d Mary whispered.</p><p>\u201cGod have mercy on their souls for being so stubborn,\u201d Heloise muttered. \u201cEach one was given the chance to pledge his loyalty, and each one turned his back on that chance.\u201d</p><p>The fire crackled in the hearth, causing Mary and Nicholaa to jump. \u201cEverything\u2019s so different now,\u201d Nicholaa said.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s orderly,\u201d Heloise interjected. \u201cIt\u2019s only taken the king two short months to squelch most of the resistance. He rules with an iron hand, that one does. Everyone has his place now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone except Saxons,\u201d Nicholaa said.</p><p>\u201cNay, even Saxons have a place,\u201d Mary countered. \u201c\u2019Tis the reason you\u2019re going to become a Norman\u2019s bride, milady. The more marriages between the two, the better for the future peace.\u201d</p><p>Nicholaa listened to the women talk about all the changes. She didn\u2019t eat the supper that the women provided, but went to bed early. She thought about the twelve Saxon soldiers waiting for execution. Her heart went out to the men and the families they would leave behind. She knew her brother Thurston might very well be one of the twelve, and that thought terrified her. She prayed until she was exhausted and then cried herself to sleep.</p><p>She dreamed about Royce.</p><p>He had a nightmare about her. He decided he must have been more fatigued than usual to have had such a bizarre dream. It had been a long day, after all. He\u2019d spent over three hours talking with King William and hadn\u2019t returned to his chamber until the dark hours of the night.</p><p>The nightmare made him wake up in a cold sweat. It had been so vivid, so real. In the dream Nicholaa was lost in a forest. She was in great danger, and he couldn\u2019t get to her.</p><p>Royce couldn\u2019t go back to sleep and ended up pacing in the gardens behind the palace. There was much to consider. His life would be forever altered if he allowed himself to lose his heart to this woman.</p><p>But damn it all, he was too old for her, too set in his ways. Why, his life was like a map. Yes, that was it . . . a map. The lines had already been drawn, and the map couldn\u2019t be altered. And neither could he. It was simply too late for him to change.</p><p>He felt relieved after he\u2019d come to this conclusion. He\u2019d made the right decision. Yet time and again he found himself staring up at Lady Nicholaa\u2019s window, wondering if she was all right\u2014and if that wasn\u2019t ridiculous, he didn\u2019t know what was.</p><p>The Norman knights were called before their king the following evening. Lawrence walked by Royce\u2019s side when they went into the gigantic great hall. The vassal was concerned about his lord, who seemed preoccupied. Lawrence sensed that something was wrong, but he couldn\u2019t imagine what it was. He knew it wouldn\u2019t do him any good to prod, though. Royce would tell him when he was ready.</p><p>King William took his seat in the tall-backed chair in the center of the platform four steps up from his audience. The king was a big man, given to bulk around his middle. His brown hair was tinged with gray, an indicator of his true age, but when he smiled he looked like a fit young man.</p><p>Matilda, the king\u2019s wife, was the complete opposite. She was a tiny woman, plump in bosom and thighs, and had sparkling brown eyes and curly brown hair.</p><p>King William motioned for his wife to join him on the platform, and when Matilda stood by her husband, the top of her head came only to William\u2019s waist. He waved his hand for silence. A hush immediately fell over the group. William then took his wife\u2019s hand and smiled at her.</p><p>\u201cMost of you have heard the tale about Lady Nicholaa and how she bested three of my noble knights.\u201d</p><p>A loud murmur rushed through the crowd. Royce smiled. He had explained to his king that the Saxon named John had helped defend the holding against the Norman challengers, but William had decided to withhold that information from the group. The soldiers were in need of a reward, he explained to Royce, and he didn\u2019t want to sour the sweet by splitting the praise and possibly marring the legend.</p><p>\u201cClayton the herald will recite the feats soon so that those who aren\u2019t familiar with this remarkable woman will understand why the rest of us are so well pleased,\u201d William continued. \u201cBut first you must meet my prize. I\u2019ve deliberately kept Lady Nicholaa well hidden until this very minute just to pique your curiosity.\u201d</p><p>William paused to kiss the back of his wife\u2019s hand, added a wink to let her know how much he was enjoying himself, and then motioned to two soldiers who stood to the right of the platform. As soon as the soldiers opened the doors behind them, William turned back to his audience.</p><p>\u201cYou will decide whether to engage in battle games for her hand in marriage. The winner will have his bride tomorrow evening.\u201d</p><p>Matilda whispered in William\u2019s ear. He nodded, then said to the crowd, \u201cI\u2019ve been reminded to tell you that the holding goes with Lady Nicholaa, as do fertile lands as far as the eye can see to the east and west. \u2019Tis a generous dowry I give with this courageous woman.\u201d</p><p>A loud cheer went up. William smiled in amusement. He was immensely pleased with the men\u2019s enthusiasm.</p><p>The noise soon became deafening\u2014until Lady Nicholaa walked into the hall. Silence reigned then. Men quit cheering in mid-bellow. Women stopped laughing. Everyone stared in fascination at the beautiful woman walking toward King William.</p><p>Nicholaa was dressed in white, a gold braided belt looped around her waist. Her unbound hair fell in soft curls that swayed ever so slightly with each step she took.</p><p>She looked like a vision. Royce stood at the very back of the hall, his big shoulders resting against the wall. Because he was the tallest man in the room, he didn\u2019t have any trouble seeing Nicholaa.</p><p>\u201cLord, she\u2019s a beauty,\u201d Lawrence remarked.</p><p>Royce agreed, but in truth he was far more impressed with Nicholaa\u2019s regal bearing. There was such pride, such dignity, in her manner.</p><p>He knew she had to be terrified. Yet she kept her feelings well hidden from her audience. The expression on her face was peaceful, serene.</p><p>He knew, though, that the hellion was probably plotting to kill both the king and his wife right now. He heard someone whisper that she was an angel and almost laughed out loud.</p><p>Lawrence glanced up at Royce just in time to catch his smile. \u201cWill you fight for her?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Royce didn\u2019t answer him.</p><p>Nicholaa followed the guards over to the fireplace. When they stopped, so did she. Then the two soldiers moved away, and she was all alone. She stood several feet in front of the giant hearth, a fair distance from the crowd and the king.</p><p>God\u2019s truth, she felt as though she\u2019d just been led into a den of lions. And she was their supper. She hoped her expression didn\u2019t betray her fear. Her heart was pounding such a wild beat it was almost painful, and her stomach seemed to be on fire. Thank God she hadn\u2019t eaten any of the nooning meal she\u2019d been offered. She\u2019d have been throwing it up now if she had.</p><p>It didn\u2019t take long for her to start feeling like a freak. Everyone was staring at her. She could feel their rude gazes on her, like bugs crawling up her arms.</p><p>Three little girls sneaked away from their mother\u2019s skirts and rushed over to stand directly in front of Nicholaa. They looked up at her, mouths gaping open, eyes wide with curiosity. They reminded her of little birds waiting to be fed.</p><p>\u201cAre you a princess?\u201d one whispered.</p><p>Nicholaa looked down at the child. The dark-haired little girl couldn\u2019t have seen more than four or five summers. There was innocent curiosity in the child\u2019s expression. Nicholaa couldn\u2019t be rude to her. She slowly shook her head. Then she turned her gaze to the far wall, determined to ignore everyone.</p><p>Baron Guy stood in the center of the hall, surrounded by his vassals. He\u2019d been relating an amusing story when Lady Nicholaa entered the hall, and he had lost his train of thought then and there. He feared he might have lost his heart as well, for though he wasn\u2019t given to fancy, he was certain he was in love. The vast holding King William offered as dowry added to the Saxon woman\u2019s appeal, of course, but Guy was smitten by her beauty, too.</p><p>He decided he would have her.</p><p>Guy took a step forward and broke the silence in the hall with an arrogant boast: \u201cI\u2019ll challenge anyone for her hand in marriage, and I\u2019ll win, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll win only if Baron Royce doesn\u2019t enter the games,\u201d a bold knight shouted.</p><p>That remark didn\u2019t go unappreciated. Laughter echoed through the crowd. Guy kept his composure. He turned to face the king, bowed formally, and then stood with his legs braced apart and his hands at his sides while he waited for the other knights to enter their bids.</p><p>Guy had fought beside William for nearly ten years. The scars on his arms were ample testimony to his battles. By sheer luck, his face had remained unblemished, and the ladies at court considered him quite handsome. He had golden hair and clear hazel eyes. He was almost as tall as his king, though he lacked both the bulk and the advanced age.</p><p>Royce was Guy\u2019s opposite. He was as dark skinned as Guy was light and towered over his friend. He wasn\u2019t considered the least bit handsome, either. The right side of his face was marred by a jagged scar that ran from the top of his ear to the base of his neck. He had earned the sickle-shaped mark years before when as a squire he\u2019d put himself in front of his leader\u2019s wife, Matilda, to protect her from attack. Needless to say, that noble act hadn\u2019t gone unrewarded. Royce had been given his own contingent of men as soon as he\u2019d finished his training under William\u2019s personal supervision.</p><p>Royce had proved his value early. Because he\u2019d become so skilled in battle tactics, William began to send young, unseasoned knights to him for instruction. Royce was always patient, though ruthlessly demanding, and it was considered a privilege to train under his tutelage. His troops were the elite, invincible core of William\u2019s mighty army.</p><p>Guy considered himself a true friend to Royce, but he was still consumed with jealousy at what he considered Royce\u2019s good fortune. The leftovers were sent to Guy for training, for he\u2019d also become known as a trainer of men. Guy had been fiercely competitive with Royce ever since their squire days together, and he often thought to himself that he would have become the more favored knight in William\u2019s eyes if he\u2019d been the one to save Matilda\u2019s life.</p><p>Royce recognized the fever of jealousy in Guy\u2019s character, acknowledged it as simply a flaw he would surely eventually overcome, and then dismissed the insignificant matter from his mind.</p><p>\u201cI, too, shall fight for her hand,\u201d another knight shouted. He strutted forward to stand before his king.</p><p>And then another and another stepped forward to join in the bids.</p><p>Nicholaa had never felt such stark humiliation before. She straightened her shoulders in reaction as she tried to block the shouts and fuel her anger at the same time. She needed to stay furious inside so she wouldn\u2019t break down and weep. But the humiliation, the degradation, was making her too sick to concentrate on much of anything.</p><p>The three little girls, all dressed like ladies, in long, flowing gowns, were now chasing one another in a spontaneous game of tag. They ran in wide circles around Nicholaa.</p><p>Where was Royce? Why was he letting this happen to her?</p><p>She forced herself to block any thoughts of him and tried to picture little Ulric in her mind. Royce had told her to keep Ulric\u2019s future in her thoughts whenever she was tempted to do something foolish.</p><p>She thought she might like to kill the king of England. Was that foolish? William alone was responsible for the disgrace she was now suffering. If he\u2019d left England alone, none of this would be taking place.</p><p>It was a foolish plan. She couldn\u2019t kill the king. She\u2019d never get away with it. She didn\u2019t even have a weapon. She was a good distance away from the platform where the king and his wife were seated, a good distance, too, from the gawking crowd bidding for her.</p><p>She still hadn\u2019t heard Royce\u2019s distinctive voice enter into the bidding. Was he even in the crowd or had he already left for Normandy? God\u2019s truth, she wanted to kill him, too.</p><p>An ear-piercing scream turned Nicholaa\u2019s attention. It was a child\u2019s voice. Nicholaa turned just in time to see one of the little girls screaming in agony. The child\u2019s gown had caught on fire. The flames were licking their way up the backs of her legs.</p><p>Nicholaa pulled the child up against her own gown and used her skirt and her hands to beat the flames out. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The fire was extinguished before any of the soldiers could give assistance. Nicholaa knelt on the floor, tore the remnants of the gown away from the little girl, and then hugged her tight, whispering words of comfort all the while.</p><p>The child clung to her savior, whimpering softly against her neck.</p><p>No one seemed capable of moving for a long minute. Then the child\u2019s mother let out a scream and came running across the hall.</p><p>Nicholaa stood up with the little girl still clinging to her neck. She transferred the child into her mother\u2019s outstretched arms. \u201cShe\u2019s still frightened,\u201d Nicholaa whispered, \u201cbut I don\u2019t believe she suffered any serious burns.\u201d</p> <p>King William had bounded out of his chair as soon as the child\u2019s tortured scream reached him. His wife stood by his side with her hands clasped over her mouth.</p><p>They both watched as the mother accepted her daughter. The little girl turned back at the last second and loudly kissed Nicholaa on her cheek. \u201cYou are a princess,\u201d she whispered. \u201cYou saved me.\u201d</p><p>The child\u2019s mother wept with relief. \u201cYes, she did save you,\u201d she agreed. She hugged her daughter and turned to smile at Nicholaa. \u201cI would thank you properly,\u201d she said. She started to bow low, then let out another scream. \u201cDear heaven, look at your hands. You\u2019ve blisters already.\u201d</p><p>Nicholaa didn\u2019t want to look at her hands. If she saw the damage, she knew it would hurt even more. Her left hand and arm throbbed far more than the right did. \u2019Twas the truth the burns felt as though she were holding a burning log in her hands.</p><p>She glanced up and saw Royce making his way toward her. She spotted him through the haze of tears burring her vision.</p> <p>It was about time, she thought to herself. He damn well should come to her. This was all his fault . . . wasn\u2019t it?</p><p>She couldn\u2019t seem to concentrate. The crowd swelled around her. Nicholaa took a step back. She hid her hands behind her back.</p><p>She desperately wanted Royce to get to her so that she could tell him to go away.</p><p>\u201cLet me see your hands, Nicholaa.\u201d</p><p>He was standing so close to her; all she had to do was lean forward and she\u2019d be touching him. He might put his arm around her shoulders and offer her comfort.</p><p>She vowed she\u2019d smack him if he touched her.</p> <p>Dear Lord, she wasn\u2019t making any sense. She shook her head and took another step back.</p><p>\u201cMake way, make way.\u201d</p><p>The shrill feminine demand forced the crowd aside. Royce moved to her side, and Nicholaa suddenly found herself staring down at the king\u2019s wife.</p><p>Lord, she was short. The top of Matilda\u2019s head only reached Nicholaa\u2019s shoulders. The woman had the bearing of a commander, though. \u201cGive me your hands. Now.\u201d</p><p>Nicholaa didn\u2019t argue. She showed the woman her burns. Determined not to look at her hands, she stared over Matilda\u2019s head while the queen examined her injuries.</p><p>\u201cYou must be in terrible pain, my dear. Come, I shall personally supervise your care. William?\u201d she called out. \u201cThere will be no more talk of challenging until we return.\u201d</p><p>The king was in complete agreement. Matilda tried to take hold of Nicholaa\u2019s elbow, but ended up grasping air, for Nicholaa moved like lightning to get closer to Royce. She was literally snuggled up against his side before Matilda could blink.</p><p>The action was telling. Matilda looked at her loyal vassal, then at the Saxon woman and back at Royce again. \u201cYou may come along with us, Baron,\u201d she announced.</p> <p>Nicholaa allowed the queen to take hold of her elbow then. Matilda tried not to smile. She noticed that when she led Nicholaa out of the hall and down the corridor, the lovely young lady kept glancing back over her shoulder to make certain Royce was following.</p><p>He was right behind her. Relief swept through Nicholaa, though she couldn\u2019t imagine why. Oh, yes, now she remembered. This was all his fault and she needed to tell him so.</p><p>He was only doing his duty by dragging her to London. That logical thought popped into her mind all of the sudden. She pushed it aside. She didn\u2019t want to be logical now.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a very courageous woman, Lady Nicholaa,\u201d said Matilda. \u201cThe little girl you saved is my dear niece. We\u2019re all in your debt.\u201d She paused to give Nicholaa a penetrating look, then added, \u201cShe\u2019s Norman, but that didn\u2019t seem to make any difference to you, did it?\u201d</p><p>Nicholaa shook her head. She wished Matilda would quit being so solicitous. She looked back over her shoulder and gave Royce a wait-until-I-get-you-alone glare.</p><p>He winked at her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re responsible for this, Royce,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Matilda heard her. \u201cNo, dear, it was an accident,\u201d she said. She motioned for the guards to open the door to Nicholaa\u2019s chamber, then marched inside.</p><p>Royce had to nudge Nicholaa forward.</p><p>The next fifteen minutes were sheer agony for Nicholaa. While the king\u2019s bossy wife issued her orders, her personal healer\u2014a wrinkled old man named Samuel who looked in dire need of a healer of his own\u2014arrived with three servants. The women put their supplies down on the wooden chest, bowed to Matilda, and then backed out of the room.</p><p>Royce stood at Nicholaa\u2019s side, his hands clasped behind his back, when the healer began his ministrations. Matilda stood near the window, her arms folded across her ample bosom, her gaze as sharp as a hawk\u2019s as she watched the couple.</p><p>Nicholaa had refused to take to her bed. She sat on a stool. Her back was as straight as a lance, her expression devoid of all emotion as she stared off into space.</p><p>Baron Samuel sat on a stool facing his patient. He cleaned the burns with cool water and then spread a thick brown salve from her fingertips to her elbows.</p><p>The cleansing had hurt like fire, but the cooling salve had a soothing effect on her skin. Nicholaa didn\u2019t realize she was leaning against Royce\u2019s thigh. Matilda noticed, though, and she couldn\u2019t contain her smile this time.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll have a few scars,\u201d Samuel told Matilda after he\u2019d finished wrapping the injuries with soft white cotton strips.</p><p>Royce assisted the old man to his feet. Samuel\u2019s knees crackled louder than the logs in the hearth.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll send you a sleeping draft,\u201d he told Nicholaa. \u201cIt will ease your pain and help you rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>They were the first words she\u2019d uttered since the healer had entered the chamber. His smile was broad. \u201cI\u2019ll return tomorrow to change your bandages.\u201d</p><p>She thanked him again. Matilda\u2019s piercing gaze kept turning from Nicholaa\u2019s serene expression to Royce\u2019s worried one.</p><p>\u201cAre you in pain now, Nicholaa?\u201d Royce asked.</p><p>The compassion in his voice was almost her undoing. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare be kind to me, you scoundrel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRoyce, would you leave us now?\u201d Matilda requested.</p><p>He didn\u2019t want to leave. That was very obvious to Matilda. The baron did her bidding, of course, just as she knew he would, but he paused at the door to give Nicholaa a long hard look before he bowed and left the chamber.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that frown all about?\u201d Matilda asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s his you\u2019d-better-behave-yourself glare,\u201d she answered.</p><p>Matilda walked over to stand in front of Nicholaa. She brushed Nicholaa\u2019s hair back over her shoulders in a motherly gesture. \u201cIt was Baron Royce\u2019s duty to bring you to us. Why do you blame him?\u201d</p><p>Nicholaa shrugged. \u201cBecause he was so cheerful about it,\u201d she remarked. \u201cAnd it makes me feel better to blame him.\u201d</p><p>She glanced up in time to catch Matilda\u2019s smile. \u201cI know Baron Royce is your loyal servant, my lady. You probably appreciate him, but I must tell you I find him insufferable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he mistreat you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why do you find him insufferable?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s rude, arrogant, and . . .\u201d Nicholaa stopped when she saw how amused Matilda was. That reaction thoroughly confused her. She was insulting one of the king\u2019s most favored knights, wasn\u2019t she?</p><p>\u201cIf Royce had left you at the abbey, my dear niece would have been severely burned before my worthy knights could have saved her. So you see, Nicholaa, it was God\u2019s will that you were here to save the child. Do you argue with me?\u201d</p><p>Her tone suggested Nicholaa agree. \u201cI won\u2019t argue with you,\u201d she said. In her heart she knew Matilda was wrong, though. Her coming here hadn\u2019t been God\u2019s will at all. It was William\u2019s decision, and that was that.</p><p>\u201cTell me what you see when you look at Royce.\u201d</p><p>Nicholaa thought that was a peculiar request. She didn\u2019t want to talk about Royce anymore. Still, it would have been rude to ignore the question. \u201cI see a very stubborn man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA vain man,\u201d Nicholaa answered.</p><p>Matilda looked startled. \u201cVain, you say?\u201d</p><p>Nicholaa nodded. \u201cI know you don\u2019t want to hear about your baron\u2019s flaws, but Royce is vain. He knows his appeal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExplain to me exactly how you feel about his appearance,\u201d Matilda prodded.</p><p>Nicholaa decided from the determined look on Matilda\u2019s face she wouldn\u2019t let up until she had her answers. She wasn\u2019t going to soften the truth, though, when she gave her opinion. \u201cHe has dark, handsome looks, and he knows it. Even I will admit that I\u2019ve admired his beautiful gray eyes. I\u2019d have to be blind not to notice, my lady. He also has a strong profile.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou noticed that, too, did you?\u201d Matilda asked, smiling.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Nicholaa said with a sigh. \u201cThen he gives me one of his lectures, and I forget how handsome he is. I just want to shout at him. Do tell me why you\u2019re smiling. I am insulting one of your barons, and I would expect you to take exception to my remarks.\u201d</p><p>Matilda shook her head. \u201cYou\u2019re telling me what\u2019s inside your heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRoyce means nothing to me,\u201d Nicholaa announced. \u201cThe man\u2019s a barbarian. He has the manners of a . . .\u201d She started to say that Royce had the manners of a Norman, but caught herself in time. \u201cA dog.\u201d</p><p>Matilda nodded. She walked over to the door. \u201cI shall have the servants help you change your clothing. Are you up to returning to the hall and finishing this contest?\u201d</p><p>Nicholaa nodded. She wanted to get the ordeal over and done with. \u201cI\u2019ll give you fair warning, my lady,\u201d she called out. \u201cI won\u2019t be a good wife. I\u2019ll make whoever weds me miserable for the rest of his days.\u201d</p><p>She meant the remark as a threat, but Matilda misunderstood. Her smile was gentle. \u201cDo not berate yourself, my dear. I\u2019m certain you have enough good qualities to keep your husband content for the rest of his days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I meant . . .\u201d</p><p>Nicholaa didn\u2019t get a chance to explain. Matilda had already left. Mary and Heloise came rushing into the chamber then, and she turned her attention to the matter of keeping their hands off her. She was determined to be left alone, and she determined not to change her gown.</p><p>Matilda hurried back to the hall. She didn\u2019t pause to speak to anyone but continued until she was once again standing by her husband on the platform. William was sprawled out in his chair. He held a silver goblet of ale in one hand.</p><p>His wife whispered into his ear. It was a lengthy, one-sided conversation. Matilda paused several times to dab at her eyes with her linen square, and when she\u2019d finished her explanation, William was smiling. He took hold of his wife\u2019s hand and kissed it.</p><p>The king handed the goblet to his squire, then motioned for silence. In a loud, booming voice he ordered all the married knights, along with their wives and children, to leave the hall. The unattached knights were to remain where they were.</p><p>Royce thought the order odd, and the puzzled expressions on his friends\u2019 faces told him they thought it peculiar, too. No one questioned the king, though. Royce walked back to his place against the far wall, for it gave him the best unblocked view of the double doors where Nicholaa would reenter the room. He nodded to Lawrence and then leaned back to wait.</p><p>The doors were finally opened. Everyone, including the king of England and his wife, turned to watch Lady Nicholaa walk into the hall.</p><p>Those who had been sitting quickly gained their feet. Someone started clapping. Then another joined in, and another and another, until the hall was a thunder of noise.</p><p>King William didn\u2019t stand, but he did join in the applause. Nicholaa didn\u2019t understand what was happening. She came to an abrupt stop and almost turned around to see who was standing behind her drawing everyone\u2019s cheers.</p><p>From her expression, Royce could tell she didn\u2019t realize the crowd was paying her a tribute. She didn\u2019t appear rattled by the noise, however. Nay, she looked quite serene.</p><p>And lovely. She was dressed in a deep blue chainse and bliaut. Royce thought the color was even more beautiful on her than the white gown she\u2019d worn into the hall an hour before.</p><p>King William motioned Nicholaa forward. She hesitated for the barest of seconds before doing as he commanded.</p><p>Royce frowned over the lustful gazes some of the knights wore as they watched Nicholaa walk toward their king. He had an almost overwhelming urge to beat the soldiers to a bloody pulp.</p><p>In that minute of raw possessiveness and true jealousy, he knew what he had to do.</p><p>\u201cWhat has you scowling, Royce?\u201d Lawrence asked.</p><p>\u201cNothing has me scowling,\u201d Royce muttered. \u201cDamn it, Lawrence, Nicholaa has to be in severe pain. Look at those bandages. They cover most of her arms. She should be resting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is for our overlord to decide,\u201d Lawrence remarked. \u201cPerhaps he thinks it best to get the ordeal finished,\u201c he added before turning back to watch Nicholaa.</p><p>In truth, Nicholaa wasn\u2019t feeling any pain at all. Baron Samuel had promised her the salve contained a special ingredient that would numb the burns. He\u2019d been true in giving her that promise.</p><p>She walked over to stand in front of the four steps that led up to the platform. She couldn\u2019t have knelt down if she\u2019d wanted to, because she couldn\u2019t grasp the hem of her gown to move it out of her way.</p><p>William noticed the slight. He leaned forward in his chair. \u201cYou do not kneel before me?\u201d</p><p>A frown was settling on his harsh features when his wife interjected, \u201cShe cannot kneel, husband. Her hands are bandaged, and she can\u2019t catch hold of her skirts. She\u2019ll fall on her face if she tries. Nicholaa dear,\u201d she called out. \u201cBow your head. That will please your king.\u201d</p><p>William nodded. He looked appeased by his wife\u2019s explanation. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Nicholaa realized she could defy the king then and there.</p><p>And what would become of Ulric?</p><p>She bowed her head.</p><p>William chuckled. \u201cYou\u2019ve shown great courage,\u201d he announced in a near shout so everyone would be sure to hear his praise. \u201cI had thought to allow my knights to compete for your hand in marriage, but now I\u2019ve changed my mind. You will have the choice.\u201d</p> <p>Her head came up with a start. The king smiled at the surprise he\u2019d given her. \u201cYes, you shall choose your husband,\u201d he said. \u201cTurn and take their measure, my dear. They are now the prizes, Lady Nicholaa. All are worthy soldiers. Prod each one if you wish; question each, too. If it takes you the rest of the night to make your decision, so be it. We\u2019ll wait. The marriage will take place as soon as you\u2019ve made your choice.\u201d</p><p>Baron Guy let out a hoot of laughter. He adjusted his red tunic and took a step forward. One of his vassals nudged him in the ribs and gave him a knowing grin.</p><p>There wasn\u2019t any doubt in Guy\u2019s mind that she would choose him. He didn\u2019t believe he was being the least bit conceited in that judgment, either. He recognized his value. He was a handsome man, perhaps the most handsome baron in William\u2019s army. Women tripped all over their hems just to get near him. And why not? He had thick blond hair, perfect hazel eyes, white teeth, and a commanding nature. He was also tall, reed thin, and possessed the physical endurance of three ordinary men put together. What more could any woman want?</p><p>Yes, she would choose him. He just needed to get her attention. Then he\u2019d smile at her, and she would be his for the plucking.</p><p>As soon as Lady Nicholaa turned and started through the crowd, Guy moved to one side and barred her path. He smiled. She stopped, turned her gaze up to look into his eyes, and smiled back.</p> <p>And then she skirted her way around him and continued on.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t believe she\u2019d rejected him. He reached out to touch her arm. Nicholaa shrugged it away.</p><p>Guy could feel his face turning red with embarrassment. His hands became fists at his side, and it took all the restraint he had not to grab her shoulders and demand she choose him. With an effort, he forced himself to feign indifference.</p><p>Guy\u2019s two favored vassals, Morgan and Henry, moved to flank their baron. Not even trying to hide their anger, they openly scowled at Nicholaa\u2019s back.</p><p>Nicholaa had no idea of the fury she\u2019d caused. Her attention was solely directed on one man. Royce. He was leaning against the far wall, looking very bored, almost sleepy.</p><p>But he was staring at her.</p> <p>The closer she got, the more worried he looked. She tried not to smile.</p><p>She could feel the tension in the hall. Most of it, she thought, came from Royce. None of the barons could possibly like this turn of the tables, for one of them had just become the coveted prize, the possession.</p><p>She really should have felt a little compassion for the knights. She didn\u2019t, though. She was too busy gloating.</p><p>Lord, it was a fine moment.</p><p>Nicholaa continued to move through the crowd until she reached Royce. When she was just a foot away from him, she stopped. She didn\u2019t say a word, just looked up at him for the longest while.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t believe she was standing there. He shook his head.</p><p>She nodded. \u201cRoyce?\u201d She said his name in a whisper, but he heard it all the same.</p><p>\u201cYes, Nicholaa?\u201d</p> <p>Her smile captivated him. She motioned for him to come closer. And then she stretched up on tiptoes and whispered into his ear.</p><p>\u201cCheckmate.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Five</p><p>They were married a scant half hour later.</p><p>Both the bride and the groom acted like the guests of honor at a human sacrifice. Theirs.</p><p>Nicholaa refused to look up at Royce. She knew he had to be furious.</p><p>He kept his gaze directed at the top of her head throughout the brief ceremony. He thought she\u2019d lost her mind.</p><p>The queen was the only one who looked thoroughly pleased. She kept dabbing at the corners of her eyes while the bishop recited the ritual. It was an unusual display of emotion, for Matilda wasn\u2019t one to let her feelings be known to anyone but her husband.</p><p>After the promises were given, Royce bent down to kiss his bride. Nicholaa didn\u2019t have time to get ready. His mouth was there and gone before she could even react.</p><p>The married couples and their children had been allowed back inside the hall to watch the ceremony. They surged forward now to offer their congratulations. Men nodded to Nicholaa while their wives, unable to grasp her hands because of the bandages, gently patted her shoulder and offered her their best wishes for a happy future.</p><p>The crowd suddenly moved back again, as though an unspoken command had been given and everyone but Nicholaa had heard it. She glanced up to judge Royce\u2019s reaction to this oddity. He ignored her and kept his gaze directed on the crowd. She peeked around her husband to look at the vassal standing next to him. She remembered that his name was Lawrence. He was Royce\u2019s second-in-command and had been the first knight to greet them when they\u2019d arrived in London.</p><p>Lawrence noticed she was staring at him. He winked at her. She blushed, then smiled back. She would have spoken to him if Royce hadn\u2019t taken hold of her arm and pulled her back.</p><p>Her attention turned to the crowd again. One of Royce\u2019s vassals came forward. Nicholaa was astonished when he knelt in front of her, placed his hand over his heart, and vowed his loyalty. To her.</p><p>And then another and another came forward to kneel in front of her. After each man had given his pledge, Royce nodded.</p><p>She felt humbled and confused by their promises. Had they forgotten she was Saxon? They must have, she decided, or they wouldn\u2019t have vowed to give up their lives just to keep her safe.</p><p>Royce never looked at Nicholaa while his vassals took turns coming forward. He knew she was nervous, though. She kept edging closer and closer to him until she\u2019d squeezed herself up tight against his side.</p><p>The king watched from the platform. When the last of Royce\u2019s vassals had given his pledge, William came lumbering down the steps.</p><p>The king whacked Royce on the shoulder, then reached out and hauled Nicholaa into his arms. He gave her a fierce embrace before nudging her back to Royce. She was just getting over that surprise when the king patted her shoulder. The affectionate gesture nearly felled her.</p><p>Royce caught her. He pulled her back into his side, put his arm around her shoulders, and anchored her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m very pleased with this marriage,\u201d the king announced. \u201cYou\u2019ve chosen well, Lady Nicholaa.\u201d He paused to give a dramatic eyebrow-lifting nod. \u201cMy dear wife was correct, as always. She told me you\u2019d choose my most favored baron. Aye, sweet Matilda made just that prediction.\u201d</p><p>Nicholaa couldn\u2019t stop herself from smiling. It was amusing to see such a fierce giant of a man acting so love-struck by his tiny wife. Heartwarming, too. It was apparent they were very much in love. In these advanced times, when the heart\u2019s preference was placed on the bottom of everyone\u2019s list of priorities in choosing a mate, it seemed a true miracle that William actually loved Matilda and that she returned those tender feelings.</p><p>It made Nicholaa like the couple all the more. The bond of respect and trust between husband and wife reminded Nicholaa of her own parents.</p><p>Heavens, what was the matter with her? She wasn\u2019t supposed to like the king and his wife. It was disloyal, wasn\u2019t it?</p><p>But disloyal to whom? The Saxon king had been dead nearly three months now. The Normans were firmly entrenched, and there didn\u2019t seem to be any faction strong enough to challenge them. It was such a confusion to her. She needed time to sort it all out.</p><p>A voice from the crowd caught her attention. \u201cPerhaps Lady Nicholaa made that choice because Royce was the only knight she knew. Had you sent me to fetch her, she surely would have chosen me.\u201d</p><p>It was the man who\u2019d tried to block her path when she walked through the crowd to Royce. Nicholaa watched him walk forward as he made that outrageous boast, his stride every bit as arrogant as his remark. He was smiling, but Nicholaa didn\u2019t think it was a sincere smile. His eyes looked as cold as frost.</p><p>She didn\u2019t like him.</p><p>Two vassals had moved to flank the boastful knight. Nicholaa didn\u2019t look up at their faces until she was formally introduced.</p><p>\u201cNicholaa,\u201d Royce said, \u201cmay I present Baron Guy and his vassals, Morgan and Henry.\u201d</p><p>Baron Guy made a low bow; his vassals rudely stood tall. Nicholaa inclined her head to Guy, then turned to look at his vassals.</p><p>She wished she hadn\u2019t bothered. The anger she saw on their faces almost took her breath away. Their disapproval bordered on hatred.</p><p>Instantly she knew they both had black hearts, and just as quickly she realized the absurdity of such a fast judgment. She didn\u2019t even know them. She still edged a little closer to Royce\u2019s side, but she couldn\u2019t seem to stop herself from shivering.</p><p>They were only men, she told herself. Ugly men at that. The one called Morgan had dark brown hair and hazel eyes. He was identical in size to the one named Henry, though Henry\u2019s hair was much lighter and his eyes were brown. The ugliness was a result of their scowls, Nicholaa decided, and their thoughts.</p><p>Did they hate her because she was Saxon or because she hadn\u2019t chosen their liege lord? Nicholaa decided it didn\u2019t matter. They were damned rude, and if that wasn\u2019t offensive, she didn\u2019t know what was.</p><p>King William whacked Royce\u2019s shoulder again. \u201cWhat say you to Baron Guy\u2019s boast? Do you think Nicholaa would have chosen him over you if he\u2019d been the one to escort her to London?\u201d</p><p>Royce shrugged. Nicholaa wanted to nudge him in his ribs. Did he have to act so bored? She stepped on his foot instead.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps,\u201d Royce allowed.</p><p>\u201cMy friend has such good fortune,\u201d Guy interjected. His gaze returned to Nicholaa. \u201cAnd now you, dear lady, will forever be denied the joy of having me for your mate.\u201d He paused to sigh. \u201c\u2019Tis a pity.\u201d</p><p>Morgan and Henry snickered in unison.</p><p>Why was Guy mocking her and Royce? Nicholaa was certain that\u2019s exactly what he was doing, but she didn\u2019t understand his reason. She looked up to judge Royce\u2019s reaction. Her husband\u2019s expression didn\u2019t tell her anything, though.</p><p>\u201cDo you wish us well, Guy?\u201d Royce asked in a voice as mild as a summer breeze.</p><p>Guy took a long time answering. The atmosphere turned brittle with tension. What in God\u2019s name was going on? It was as though a game was in play and Nicholaa was the only one who wasn\u2019t taking part. Her stomach turned queasy, and she suddenly felt threatened.</p><p>Then Royce tightened his hold on her shoulders and gave her a quick squeeze. Her fear vanished. She didn\u2019t know what to make of that reaction, either.</p><p>The Normans were making her daft.</p><p>Guy still hadn\u2019t answered Royce\u2019s question. Several vassals moved forward, obviously intent on listening to the conversation. Lawrence took a step forward.</p><p>She certainly liked this vassal. Lawrence wasn\u2019t hiding his feelings or trying to play this strange game. His scowl was as fierce as a bear\u2019s bite. He was properly furious on his baron\u2019s behalf. At least he understood the insults Guy was tossing around, even if Royce didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cOf course I wish you well,\u201d Guy finally answered. \u201cI\u2019m just surprised,\u201d he added with a shrug.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Lawrence asked. He folded his arms across his chest and waited for an answer.</p><p>\u201cYes, why?\u201d Nicholaa asked.</p><p>Morgan and Henry both moved forward. Nicholaa thought the two vassals were trying to show their loyalty to their baron and intimidate Lawrence at the same time.</p><p>Still Royce showed no outward reaction to the tension surrounding him.</p><p>\u201cI was surprised you chose Royce because of his appearance,\u201d Guy explained. \u201c\u2019Tis a fact that his scar offends most women.\u201d</p><p>Morgan immediately nodded agreement. Henry was the least subtle of the lot. He grinned.</p><p>Nicholaa shrugged Royce\u2019s arm away from her shoulder and took a step forward. \u201cAre you referring to the handsome mark of valor upon his cheek, Baron?\u201d</p><p>Her voice shook his anger. Guy couldn\u2019t hide his surprise. The Saxon wench was a spirited woman. That added to her appeal, as did her eyes, which had turned a deep violet. Guy found her quite arousing. Damn but he wanted her.</p><p>\u201cMark of valor?\u201d he repeated. \u201cWhat an unusual way of looking at the imperfection.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoys have perfection,\u201d Nicholaa answered. \u201cI chose a man.\u201d</p><p>That barb hit deep. Guy\u2019s face turned pink with embarrassment. Nicholaa would have let the matter drop then and there if the baron hadn\u2019t enraged her with his next remark: \u201cEveryone knows you would have been happier with me.\u201d</p><p>That did it. His superior attitude might not have offended Royce, but it damn well offended her.</p><p>Matilda chose that moment to interfere. \u201cNicholaa,\u201d she began, \u201cyou have no way of knowing what this is all about, and so I shall explain Guy\u2019s peculiar behavior. He\u2019s a very competitive man, my dear. He doesn\u2019t take defeat lightly. Yet each time he faces Royce in games of strength, Guy comes in second best.\u201d</p><p>Matilda\u2019s voice held a note of censure. Guy bowed his head and tried to look amused instead of furious.</p><p>Nicholaa now had her weapon. She knew she\u2019d probably burn in purgatory an extra day or two for the sin she was about to commit, but she couldn\u2019t be bothered with that worry now.</p><p>\u201cIt was kind of you to explain,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I already knew Royce is considered the best warrior in your army.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow would you have come by that knowledge?\u201d Matilda asked.</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019d heard about Royce a long time ago,\u201d Nicholaa lied. \u201cMy brother\u2019s soldiers would whisper about him. He\u2019d become a legend. His feats were recounted over and over again. Royce was their most feared adversary.\u201d</p><p>Nicholaa turned and gave Guy a sympathetic smile. \u201cOdd, but I never heard your name whispered, Baron.\u201d</p><p>King William laughed. \u201cThere you are, Guy,\u201d he announced. \u201cYou have your answer. She would have chosen Royce even if you\u2019d gone to fetch her.\u201d</p><p>Nicholaa nodded. She smiled at Morgan, then at Henry. \u201cAye,\u201d she agreed. \u201cI wanted the best.\u201d</p><p>It took a supreme act of concentration for Guy to smile back. \u201cI\u2019ve been properly answered.\u201d</p><p>Someone shouted for a toast to the groom, and the tension was broken. Guy walked across the hall with Henry by his side. Morgan lingered.</p><p>The angry vassal was intent on whispering a threat or two, but Royce wouldn\u2019t let him. He nudged Morgan forward and away from Nicholaa, then motioned for Lawrence to stand by her side. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her husband hadn\u2019t even looked at her before he was dragged away by his friends. Nicholaa didn\u2019t know if he was pleased by her defense or angry.</p><p>Matilda couldn\u2019t have been more pleased, however. \u201cBaron Guy is sinfully jealous of Royce, but he\u2019s also loyal to his king. I try not to forget that.\u201d She turned to smile at Lawrence. \u201cIt\u2019s a sound match,\u201d she told the vassal. \u201cNicholaa\u2019s already loyal to Royce. In time I believe she\u2019ll give him her heart.\u201d</p><p>Nicholaa didn\u2019t delude herself. Royce wasn\u2019t the type of man who would accept her love\u2014assuming she was in the mood to give it, she qualified. She let out a sigh then, realizing how addled her thoughts had become.</p><p>\u201cDid you love William when first you met?\u201d she asked.</p> <p>Matilda laughed. \u201cNo, dear, he courted me for seven years. I finally agreed to marry him, and from that moment on, he had my love. I pray it won\u2019t take Royce that long to win yours.\u201d</p><p>Nicholaa wondered what had changed Matilda\u2019s mind after such a long time, but didn\u2019t feel she could prod her to explain. Besides, she had another question on her mind. \u201cI was wondering,\u201d she began, \u201chow you knew I would choose Royce. I did hear your husband say you knew I would, and I don\u2019t understand\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a simple conclusion,\u201d Matilda answered. \u201cWhen I asked you to tell me how you felt about Royce\u2019s appearance it was what you didn\u2019t mention that gave me my answer. I\u2019d already guessed it would be a fitting match,\u201d she added, patting her hair. \u201cIt\u2019s what you didn\u2019t see.\u201d</p><p>Nicholaa had no idea what the woman was talking about. \u201cWhat didn\u2019t I see?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe scar.\u201d</p> <p>Well, of course she saw the scar when she looked at Royce. It covered half his cheek after all. And just what did that have to do with anything?</p><p>Matilda turned to Lawrence. \u201cYour new mistress told me she believes Royce to be a vain man.\u201d</p><p>Lawrence laughed. Nicholaa could feel herself turning pink with embarrassment.</p><p>Matilda patted her arm. \u201cCome along now,\u201d she ordered. \u201cYou must return to your chamber to await your husband. We aren\u2019t allowed to join in tonight\u2019s celebration. Tomorrow night you\u2019ll have your festive dinner, Nicholaa, but tonight belongs to the men. It\u2019s for the better,\u201d she added with a nod. \u201cYou look exhausted from all the chaos. It was a lovely ceremony, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d she continued. \u201cDon\u2019t dally, Nicholaa. I shall walk with you part of the distance. Lawrence? You may have the honor of escorting us.\u201d</p><p>The vassal bowed low. He couldn\u2019t seem to quit smiling. He\u2019d overheard Matilda\u2019s remarks about Royce\u2019s scar and had seen Nicholaa\u2019s confused reaction. He couldn\u2019t have been more pleased. Nicholaa was a fitting choice for his baron.</p><p>Matilda took Nicholaa\u2019s elbow and walked toward the doors. Her guards fell into step behind Lawrence.</p> <p>Nicholaa was exhausted. The evening had been overwhelming. It had drained her strength, she decided. Everyone was being so kind to her, everyone except Baron Guy\u2019s mean-hearted vassals, but those two didn\u2019t signify.</p><p>Was it really possible for the Normans and the Saxons to live together in harmony?</p><p>The king\u2019s wife waved farewell when she turned down the south corridor. Her attendants rushed to catch up with her. Lawrence walked by Nicholaa\u2019s side down the north hallway.</p><p>\u201cWill you accompany Baron Royce to my home when we leave here?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI would imagine so,\u201d Lawrence answered.</p><p>She looked up and caught his smile. \u201cYou\u2019re pleased to be staying in England?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged.</p><p>\u201cThen why are you smiling?\u201d she asked.</p> <p>He debated a minute before giving her his answer. \u201cI was remembering the look on Royce\u2019s face when you walked up to him. I don\u2019t believe my lord expected you to choose him.\u201d</p><p>She lowered her gaze. \u201cDo you think I\u2019ve ruined his life?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019ve enhanced it,\u201d he returned. \u201cLady Nicholaa, I wouldn\u2019t be smiling if I believed otherwise.\u201d</p><p>It was a lovely compliment he\u2019d just given her. Nicholaa didn\u2019t know how to respond. She looked up at him and suddenly burst into laughter. \u201cHe was surprised, wasn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, he was,\u201d Lawrence agreed.</p><p>Two soldiers stood guard in front of her door. Lawrence bowed to his new mistress, opened the door for her, and then turned to leave.</p><p>\u201cLawrence?\u201d</p><p>He immediately stopped.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what, my lady?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor accepting me.\u201d She shut the door before he could respond.</p><p>Lawrence whistled on his way back to the great hall. The irritation of having to put up with Baron Guy\u2019s foolishness was gone now. His new mistress\u2019s smile had brightened his mood considerably. Yes, he thought to himself, she would enhance his baron\u2019s life. She would bring light into his dreary, disciplined existence. It wouldn\u2019t be long, Lawrence wagered, before she had Royce smiling. That would take magic, the vassal knew, but Nicholaa was up to the challenge.</p><p>Nicholaa was too exhausted to think about anything other than going to bed. Mary was waiting to assist her. She kept up a steady stream of chatter while she helped Nicholaa undress. After her mistress had bathed and changed into a long white nightgown, Mary brushed her hair.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the talk of the palace,\u201d Mary announced. \u201cSuch bravery, they\u2019re all whispering, the way you saved the king\u2019s niece. Here now, milady, drink this down,\u201d she pleaded after she\u2019d tucked Nicholaa under the covers. \u201cBaron Samuel sent this draft to ease your pain.\u201d</p><p>Mary didn\u2019t let up her nagging until Nicholaa had swallowed the last drop.</p><p>Nicholaa fell into a deep sleep minutes later. Mary went over to the stool by the hearth to watch over her mistress until Baron Royce dismissed her for the night.</p><p>A full hour passed before Royce was able to leave the hall. When he entered his chamber, the servant jumped to attention.</p><p>\u201cYou wife is having a very fitful sleep, milord,\u201d Mary whispered. \u201cShe cries out in fear. I tried to wake her from her nightmare but the draft she took makes that impossible.\u201d</p><p>Royce nodded. He surprised the servant by thanking her for her assistance; then he dismissed her.</p><p>He barred the door against intruders and walked to the side of the bed. Nicholaa was frowning in her sleep. He gently brushed his hand across her brow. \u201cYou\u2019ve had one hell of a week, haven\u2019t you, Nicholaa?\u201d</p><p>She muttered something in her sleep, then rolled onto her side. The weight of her body on her burned hand made her cry out in pain.</p><p>He gently turned her onto her back again, then stood there for a long while staring down at her. Dear God, she really belonged to him now. He shook his head. What was he supposed to do with her?</p><p>A slow grin settled on his face. Protect her, and her family as well. That had become his primary duty. It didn\u2019t matter who had made the choice; the deed was done. It didn\u2019t matter, either, that he was set in his ways and that he liked order and discipline in his life.</p><p>Everything was going to change now. She\u2019d give him fits before she calmed down and learned to accept her new station in life. Odd, but he found he was looking forward to the challenge of taming Nicholaa. If he was patient and understanding with her, he didn\u2019t think it would take him long to win her loyalty. The way she\u2019d stood up to Guy had shown him she was capable of being loyal to others outside her family.</p><p>He doubted Nicholaa would ever love him. That didn\u2019t matter, of course, as love had little meaning to him. He was a warrior, and warriors neither wanted nor needed love. He was out to conquer Nicholaa\u2019s mind, not her heart. He would use a firm though gentle hand while he trained her to be his wife.</p><p>It was a sound, logical plan. Royce put the matter aside and prepared for bed.</p><p>It felt strange to sleep next to a woman. He had bedded a fair number of wenches, of course, but he\u2019d never slept the night through with any of them.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t making it an easy adjustment either. When she wasn\u2019t muttering incoherent phrases, she was tossing and turning like an errant wave. Each time she moved, she bumped one of her injured hands and cried out in pain.</p><p>Royce tried to help her get comfortable. It was a damn difficult task. She wouldn\u2019t stay still long enough for him to anchor her.</p><p>Just when he was finally drifting off to sleep, she bolted up in the bed. \u201cI want to sleep on my stomach,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>Royce didn\u2019t think she even knew where she was; she hadn\u2019t even opened her eyes when she blurted out that demand. When she kicked the covers aside and tried to get out of the bed, he grabbed her.</p><p>She went limp in his arms. He was about to haul her up against his side, but she suddenly turned around. She ended up sprawled on top of him.</p><p>Nicholaa finally found a comfortable position. She let out a little sigh of pleasure and stopped squirming.</p><p>The top of her head was tucked under his chin. Her soft br**sts were pressed against his bare chest. Her pelvis was right on top of his, and her legs were draped over one of his thighs.</p><p>He adjusted her position until her legs were between his own, then wrapped his arms around her waist.</p><p>She was all soft and feminine. She smelled as good as she felt, too. They were a nice fit, he thought to himself. That thought led to another and another, of course, and it wasn\u2019t long before Royce was damned uncomfortable.</p><p>He tried to go to sleep, but her warm body kept getting in his thoughts. All he wanted to think about was making love to her.</p><p>She squirmed.</p><p>He groaned.</p><p>It was a wedding night he would never forget.</p><p>Chapter Six</p><p>It was midafternoon before Nicholaa awakened. She spent an hour stumbling around the room, trying to clear her mind of the effects of the powerful sleeping drug.</p><p>Lord, she\u2019d slept like the dead. Odd, but she didn\u2019t feel the least bit refreshed after her long rest, either.</p><p>Mary found her mistress sitting on the side of the bed when she entered the chamber a short time later. The servant carried a beautiful white bliaut and chainse. The sleeves of the bliaut were embroidered with gold threads, and the chainse had the same distinctive design sewn into the hem. The fabric looked delicate enough to shred with a good sneeze. It felt wonderfully soft against Nicholaa\u2019s cheek.</p><p>\u201cWho sends this to me?\u201d Nicholaa asked.</p><p>\u201cThe king\u2019s wife,\u201d Mary answered. \u201cYou\u2019ve won her affection,\u201d she added with a nod. \u201cShe even sent along gold threads to weave through your hair. You\u2019re to sit with your husband at the king\u2019s table for tonight\u2019s celebration, milady.\u201d</p><p>Nicholaa didn\u2019t show any reaction to that announcement. She knew she probably should show some enthusiasm over the honor of dining with the king of England. She couldn\u2019t, though. She still felt a little dull-witted from the draft she\u2019d taken. She was homesick, too, and all she wanted was to be left alone for a while.</p><p>She didn\u2019t get that wish. The next several hours were spent on practical matters. After she\u2019d been bathed and dressed in the elegant garments, Nicholaa did feel better. Mary brushed her hair thoroughly, poking and tugging until Nicholaa was ready to scream. She wasn\u2019t used to being pampered, but she didn\u2019t want to hurt Mary\u2019s feelings, and so she put up with the nuisance. The servant couldn\u2019t seem to get the gold threads to stay in her mistress\u2019s curls, though. Nicholaa finally ordered her to stop trying.</p><p>Baron Samuel and his staff arrived then to see to Nicholaa\u2019s injuries. She couldn\u2019t persuade the healer to leave her hands unbandaged, though she was able to elicit from him a promise that the wrapping would stay on for only one more night.</p><p>She kept expecting Royce to pay her a visit. She hadn\u2019t seen him since the wedding, after all, and she thought it would be proper for him at least to look in on her. By the dinner hour, she was good and pricked by his rudeness. It was obvious to her that Royce was ignoring her.</p><p>Mary kept fawning over her. Nicholaa wasn\u2019t used to hearing how pretty she was, and the servant\u2019s compliments soon had her blushing with embarrassment. In desperation, she sent Mary to get her fresh water just so she could have a few minutes of peace and quiet.</p><p>The servant left the door ajar. When Nicholaa saw that two soldiers stood guard in the hallway, she was irritated. Was she still a prisoner, then? She decided to find out. She walked over to the entrance, nudged the door wider with the toe of her shoe, and bowed to the men.</p><p>The soldiers were staring at her, clearly astonished. She wondered about their amazement even as she bade the men good day.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a worthy bride for our lord,\u201d one blurted out.</p><p>The other nodded. \u201cAye, you are.\u201d</p><p>Nicholaa thanked the soldiers for their kind remarks, then asked, \u201cWhy do you guard my door?\u201d</p><p>The taller soldier answered. \u201cBaron Royce has ordered us to stay here, milady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what purpose?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo protect you,\u201d the soldier answered. \u201cYou\u2019re our mistress now,\u201d he added with a dramatic bow.</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019m allowed to leave without interference?\u201d</p><p>Both soldiers nodded. \u201cWe would be honored to escort you to your destination,\u201d he explained.</p><p>Nicholaa felt better. She wasn\u2019t a prisoner, after all. \u201cWould you please escort me to my husband\u2019s quarters?\u201d she requested. \u201cI have need to speak to him.\u201d</p><p>The two men shared a look before turning back to their mistress. \u201cBut you\u2019re already inside his chamber,\u201d the shorter one said.</p><p>Then where had Royce slept? Nicholaa wasn\u2019t about to ask that question. The answer might prove humiliating. She nodded to the soldiers and was about to nudge the door closed again when Lawrence came rushing down the hallway.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready for your supper, Lady Nicholaa?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is my husband?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s waiting for you in the great hall,\u201d Lawrence answered. \u201cIf you would allow me to escort you, my lady, I\u2019ll take you to him.\u201d</p><p>The man couldn\u2019t even be bothered to come and fetch his wife? Nicholaa hid her frown. She told herself she didn\u2019t care. It was all right with her if he wanted to sleep in someone else\u2019s bed. He could keep right on ignoring her, too.</p><p>No, she didn\u2019t care at all. Nicholaa kept telling herself that lie as she walked by Lawrence\u2019s side.</p><p>The great hall was filled to capacity. She found Royce right away. He was the tallest warrior in the room, which made her task easy. His back was turned to her, and he was surrounded by acquaintances. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A hush fell over the crowd when she and Lawrence walked inside. Everyone seemed to be staring in her direction. She couldn\u2019t imagine why. \u201cWho is everyone staring at, Lawrence?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYou.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t have been more blunt than that, she supposed. Her heartbeat quickened. \u201cI thought they accepted me,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Lawrence smiled. \u201cThey do accept you, my lady. This festive dinner is for you and Royce.\u201d</p> <p>Nicholaa was too busy feeling awkward to be appeased by his explanation. She didn\u2019t like being the center of attention. She didn\u2019t like being ignored by her husband, either. She stared at Royce\u2019s back while she waited for him to come to her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take you to Royce,\u201d Lawrence announced.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cRoyce should come to me,\u201d she said.</p><p>One of the knights speaking to Royce finally noticed her. He stopped talking and nudged her husband.</p><p>Royce slowly turned around. His gaze found her immediately of course. She was the most beautiful woman in the hall. Would he ever get used to her? Each time he saw her, he became rattled by her appearance. Her hair shimmered like gold. He liked it the way she wore it today\u2014unbound and swinging loose around her shoulders. He suddenly wanted to touch her.</p> <p>He had to take a deep breath to gain control of his thoughts. He nodded and arrogantly motioned Lawrence and Nicholaa forward.</p><p>She rejected his order by shaking her head at him. Lawrence looked uncomfortable. Royce watched as his vassal leaned down and whispered something into Nicholaa\u2019s ear. She shook her head again.</p><p>What was her game now? Royce was having difficulty believing what he was seeing. His bride dared to disobey his command? It was unthinkable. He almost laughed, but caught himself in time. He motioned to her again.</p><p>His expression showed nothing of what he was thinking\u2014until she beckoned to him. His eyes widened then, and damn, if he didn\u2019t find himself shaking his head at her.</p><p>Even from the distance separating them, Nicholaa could see a muscle jerk in his cheek. His jaw was clenched tight. He was angry all right. Although she worried over the look in his eyes, she refused to back down. By God, she was his wife and he would come to her.</p><p>Royce folded his arms across his chest and continued to stare at her. The message was clear. He wasn\u2019t going to budge.</p> <p>There was only one alternative left: she would have to leave the hall. She wasn\u2019t very hungry anyway, she told herself. Besides, Royce would surely come chasing after her, and in the privacy of the corridor she could give him hell for being rude to her. She might take the opportunity to explain his new duties to him, too. First and foremost, she would tell him, a husband should always escort his wife to any important function.</p><p>Nicholaa put her plan into action. She thanked Lawrence for his escort, then smiled at Royce. She couldn\u2019t manage a curtsy with her bandaged hands, so she inclined her head. Then she turned and walked toward the doorway.</p><p>\u201cNicholaa.\u201d</p><p>His voice made the rafters shake. Nicholaa came to a dead stop. She couldn\u2019t believe he\u2019d bellowed her name in front of all the guests. She turned around to look at him, mortified. The entire gathering was once again staring at her, thanks to her inconsiderate husband.</p><p>She could feel her cheeks burning with embarrassment. The look in Royce\u2019s eyes told her he would continue to make a scene and not be embarrassed at all. She pictured him dragging her to the table by her hair, and that dark thought made her reevaluate her position. God only knew the man was rude enough to go to any length to get what he wanted.</p><p>She supposed she\u2019d better let him have his way . . . this one time. She let out a sigh, slapped a serene expression on her face, and walked across the room. She kept her gaze directed on Royce. If that man dared to smile, she swore to her Maker she\u2019d kick him.</p><p>She stopped when she was just a foot away from him. \u201cDid you wish something?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. He looked complacent to her. She moved a little closer. \u201cYou aren\u2019t always going to get what you want,\u201d she whispered.</p> <p>\u201cYes, I am.\u201d</p><p>She saw the sparkle in his eyes then. \u201cYou\u2019re an impossible man,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>\u201cYou mentioned that before.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. She didn\u2019t know what to make of that. She bowed her head. He forced her chin back up. Then he slowly leaned down and kissed her. His mouth only brushed her lips for a fleeting second, but it still left her flustered.</p><p>She was just regaining her wits after that surprise when he pulled her to his side, draped an arm around her shoulders, and turned back to his friends.</p><p>He treated her like a piece of baggage, she thought to herself, but at least he had given her a proper greeting. Lord, he confused her.</p><p>That feeling stayed with Nicholaa throughout the long dinner. The man all but ignored her while the meal was served. She was given compliment after compliment from both the men and the ladies, yet somehow their remarks didn\u2019t count. Royce hadn\u2019t said anything about her appearance, but she didn\u2019t care what he thought, she told herself, even as she tried to smooth her hair just so.</p><p>Because of the injury to her hands, someone would have to feed her, and that was a humiliation Nicholaa wasn\u2019t about to suffer. She turned to whisper just that thought to her husband, but was waylaid when he shoved a piece of meat into her mouth. She chewed instead.</p><p>There was such a commotion of laughing and talking going on inside the hall that Nicholaa didn\u2019t think anyone was paying her any attention. Matilda sat on her right, but she was in deep discussion with her husband. The topic, Nicholaa chanced to overhear, was their children.</p><p>And so she allowed Royce to assist her with her dinner. It helped that he was so nonchalant about the task. He could have ordered his squire to see to the chore, and she found herself thankful that he wasn\u2019t making an issue out of her affliction.</p><p>\u201cBaron Samuel said he would take my bandages off tomorrow,\u201d she told Royce.</p><p>He nodded. Then he turned to speak to a baron she hadn\u2019t met. She nudged Royce with her foot. He didn\u2019t turn back to her.</p><p>Nicholaa sat there, feeling all alone and miserable, her burned hands resting in her lap. It didn\u2019t take her long to start feeling sorry for herself. Her hands were stinging, and the pain only added to her melancholy mood. She noticed several unattached women giving her husband coy looks. She edged closer to Royce and frowned at the shameless wenches.</p><p>She didn\u2019t like being ignored. Royce came to that conclusion when she kept squeezing herself closer to his side on the long bench. If she moved again, she\u2019d be sitting on his lap.</p><p>He finally took mercy on her. \u201cAre you enjoying yourself, Nicholaa?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She lifted her shoulders in a dainty shrug. \u201cWhere did you sleep last night?\u201d</p><p>Nicholaa turned away from Royce to glare at an ugly redheaded woman who was trying to get her husband\u2019s attention. \u201cWell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook at me when you ask me a question,\u201d he commanded.</p><p>He patiently waited until she\u2019d complied with that order, then said, \u201cI slept with my wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m your wife.\u201d</p><p>He raised an eyebrow. \u201cYes, you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou slept with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I just said, woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou needn\u2019t sound irritated. I don\u2019t remember last night, and I did wonder. So you slept with me.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t seem to get it straight in her mind. Royce held his patience. She was such a joy to watch when she was pricked about something. She was certainly pricked now. She was trying not to frown and failing miserably. He decided to goad her a little. \u201cActually, I slept under you. You were on top.\u201d</p><p>Her face turned flame red. Royce laughed. The loud booming sound drew several startled glances.</p><p>\u201cYou made me sleep on top of\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wanted to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was drugged.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Her shoulders straightened. \u201cI\u2019m not taking a draft tonight.\u201d</p><p>He agreed when he saw how upset she was becoming.</p><p>Nicholaa was pulled into a conversation with Matilda then. Royce noticed she didn\u2019t move away from his side. She seemed to want to be close to him. He didn\u2019t understand why, but he liked having her by his side. It seemed the most natural thing in the world to put his arm around her shoulders. Nicholaa didn\u2019t shrug his arm away. A few minutes later, when Matilda finished relating an amusing story about one of her daughters and turned back to her husband, Nicholaa gave in to her weariness and leaned against Royce\u2019s side.</p><p>To outsiders, she supposed she and Royce looked like a happily wedded couple who couldn\u2019t wait to have a bit of time alone together. In part, that was true, Nicholaa thought. She couldn\u2019t wait to get Royce alone. And the minute she did, she was going to give that unbending brute a fair piece of her mind. Lord, he was inconsiderate. Why, every time she thought about the way he\u2019d bellowed her name and arrogantly motioned for her to come to him, she started seething.</p><p>It didn\u2019t take her any time at all to work herself into a fine state of fury. Then Royce ruined it. He started rubbing the tension right out of her shoulders in such a soothing way she couldn\u2019t help but snuggle up against him. She yawned, too.</p><p>\u201cDo your hands still burn, Nicholaa?\u201d he whispered against her ear.</p><p>A shiver of pleasure made her neck tickle. The tenderness in his voice felt like a caress. She knew it probably wasn\u2019t proper to be pressed up against his side in front of the guests, but she was too weary to care.</p><p>Besides, it was chilly inside the hall and Royce was so incredibly warm. She told herself she only wanted to borrow a little of his heat.</p><p>She wiggled a little closer to him before she gave him her answer. \u201cMy hands do sting a little, Royce. It isn\u2019t unbearable, though.\u201d</p><p>He started rubbing her shoulders again. She liked that. She liked his scent, too. Royce smelled so clean, so masculine. When he turned back to talk to his friends, she didn\u2019t feel as though he was completely ignoring her anymore, because every now and then he\u2019d gently stroke the back of her neck or brush his hand against her upper arm, just to let her know, she thought, that he hadn\u2019t forgotten her.</p><p>King William suddenly stood up, waved his hand for silence, and then commanded that Sir Clayton come forward.</p><p>A tall, thin man with a long, narrow nose and thick jowls separated himself from the group and made a low bow. He was dressed in purple garb, a bright red cape draped across one shoulder.</p><p>King William took his seat, and everyone hurried to find a chair. In a matter of minutes silence reigned in the hall.</p><p>Clayton made quite a flourish when he motioned for his assistants to come forward. Two young men, dressed alike, stood on either side of Clayton. The assistants held trumpets in their hands.</p><p>Nicholaa straightened away from Royce\u2019s side, her curiosity piqued. She assumed the trio would sing for the gathering.</p><p>King William clapped his hands. The assistants sounded the trumpets, then walked forward. Clayton followed.</p><p>Royce was also watching now. He leaned back against the bench, then nudged Nicholaa to do the same.</p><p>She turned to smile at him. \u201cAre they going to sing for us?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cThat\u2019s Clayton the herald,\u201d he explained.</p><p>Nicholaa didn\u2019t understand. She knew that the herald was the living memory of the times, the history teller of important events. The Saxons also used heralds, of course, and although she knew what the duties were, she couldn\u2019t imagine why Clayton was giving an accounting now.</p><p>She leaned into Royce\u2019s side again. \u201cIs he going to tell what happened at Hastings?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cHe\u2019s going to recount a special legend, Nicholaa. Pay attention. You\u2019ll understand soon enough.\u201d</p><p>Clayton had already begun his tale. Nicholaa caught the end of his remarks about the importance of securing a lucrative holding in King William\u2019s name.</p><p>The herald\u2019s voice was strong yet musical, too. In no time at all, Nicholaa had become engrossed in the remarkable story.</p><p>Clayton paused, turned to smile at Nicholaa, and then turned back to the group and continued. \u201cThree other Norman knights had tried to capture the Saxon. Each man had failed.</p><p>\u201cSir Gregory was the first to request the challenge. The eager young knight, bold in heart and soul, was anxious to prove his value to his overlord. He begged to be given the duty, and when his plea was granted, the knight boasted to everyone within shouting distance that he would return victorious in less than a week\u2019s time. The rumors, after all, whispered that it wasn\u2019t a Saxon warrior in charge of the stronghold, and if that talk turned out to be true, the battle wouldn\u2019t be worthy of a single retelling. Gregory was so confident of his success that he took only thirty soldiers with him, and he fairly strutted out of the camp.\u201d</p><p>A loud round of laughter erupted from the crowd. Clayton waited until the noise had died down, then continued. \u201cAlas,\u201d he drawled in a long sigh, \u201cSir Gregory didn\u2019t strut back. He couldn\u2019t, for the arrow protruding from his backside made an arrogant swagger impossible. As soon as the arrow was pulled free from his flesh, the now humble Gregory threw himself on his knees in front of his leader. His head, I assure you, was bowed low enough to touch the ground. After admitting his failure, the knight begged our beloved William to have off with his head for his shame.\u201d</p><p>Nicholaa let out a little gasp. King William was chuckling over the story and dabbing at his eyes with a linen cloth. It was obvious that he was thoroughly enjoying this tale.</p><p>Clayton bowed to his king and then once again continued. \u201c\u2018Were the rumors true?\u2019 King Wiliam asked. \u2018Was it a mere woman who bested my noble knight?\u2019</p><p>\u201cGregory, I can attest, made no attempt to come up with a plausible excuse. He could only give his lord the truth, no matter how humiliating the outcome. \u2018Aye, my lord,\u2019 he said, \u2018it was a woman directing the defense.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Clayton once again waited until the laughter subsided, then continued his explanation. \u201cThe duke of Normandy\u2014for our lord wasn\u2019t officially anointed king of England then\u2014clasped his hands behind his back and stared down at the knight kneeling before him. Our lord had won handsomely at the battle near Hastings, but there were still more battles to win before England would belong to him. His men, he informed me, were weary from battle.</p><p>\u201cBe it known to all,\u201d Clayton continued, \u201cthat William is a shrewd judge of men. He quickly noticed that from the minute Gregory came limping back into camp, his soldiers had shed their fatigued expressions and had eagerly crowded around the young warrior to hear his tale. By the time Gregory finished his confession of failure, the men were smiling in amusement. No one, you see, could believe a woman could best a Norman knight. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWilliam reported to me that he also was feeling invigorated by this fresh puzzle. He announced that the Saxon woman had provided a respite for his men. She\u2019d actually made the soldiers forget their injuries and their fatigue. \u2018Who will take on this challenge in my name?\u2019 William, our leader, called out.\u201d Clayton was once again forced to wait for everyone\u2019s attention as heads turned.</p><p>Nicholaa whispered, \u201cWho are they looking for?\u201d</p><p>Royce smiled. \u201cFor Hannibal,\u201d he answered. \u201cThere he is, in the back. He\u2019s the one with the red face. His failings are about to be paraded before us.\u201d</p><p>Nicholaa tried not to laugh. The poor man looked embarrassed. \u201cWhere is Gregory?\u201d she asked. \u201cThe first knight who took on this challenge?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s trying to blend into the back wall to your left, Nicholaa.\u201d</p><p>Clayton drew her attention when he finally continued. \u201cAnother eager young knight by name of Sir Hannibal rushed forward. He placed his hand over his heart, bowed his head low, and humbly requested the duty. Our beloved William granted him permission. \u2018I want the woman unharmed,\u2019 he decreed. \u2019 Bring her to London once you\u2019ve secured the fortress. She\u2019ll witness my coronation.\u2019 William then paused to stare at his attentive audience before adding, \u2018She\u2019ll be my prize to award to a worthy knight.\u2019\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until that moment, when Clayton said the word \u201cprize\u201d that Nicholaa realized the tale was about her.</p><p>She would have bolted out of her seat if Royce hadn\u2019t held her down. She turned to her husband. She looked stricken. Her eyes filled with tears.</p><p>Royce whispered into her ear, \u201cClayton doesn\u2019t mock you, Nicholaa. He praises you.\u201d</p> <p>She took a deep breath. Her back was rigid, and she stared straight ahead. She tried, but she couldn\u2019t block out the herald\u2019s voice.</p><p>\u201cHannibal left the camp on his quest the following morning. He took sixty soldiers with him, double the number Gregory had commanded. The flame of determination in the knight\u2019s eyes was bright, but like Gregory, he also underestimated his adversary. Six days later, he caught up with his overlord to confess his failure.</p><p>\u201cA third knight by name of Michael was dispatched the following morning. He was older than the first two challengers and far more experienced, but alas, he also failed.\u201d</p><p>The herald continued, telling how William finally called together his most trusted barons, Guy and Royce, for a conference. Clayton went into great detail with praise for the barons and finally ended the dissertation with the events leading up to the marriage.</p><p>When Clayton finally finished his tale, he bowed to King William and walked over to stand directly in front of Nicholaa. He bowed low again, to her this time. Everyone in the hall stood up and applauded.</p><p>Royce stood up, but Nicholaa seemed glued to the bench. He lifted her up and held her steady with his arm around her waist.</p> <p>The knights she\u2019d bested came forward through the crowd. Each carried an armful of flowers. Gregory carried white; Hannibal carried pink, and Michael carried red. The knights bowed to Royce before placing the flowers on the table in front of Nicholaa.</p><p>King William raised his hand for silence again. \u201cThese three have earned the right to join Baron Royce\u2019s ranks. When he\u2019s finished training them, they won\u2019t be bested again.\u201d</p><p>Laughter followed that announcement. William clapped his hands together again, and the musicians began to play.</p><p>Nicholaa sat down, confused by what had just happened. She turned to Royce. He was watching her closely. He wasn\u2019t smiling. \u201cIt was all a game,\u201d she whispered. \u201cStealing my home and\u2014\u201d</p><p>He took the bluster out of her when he leaned down and kissed her. Surprised by the show of affection, she became even more confused.</p><p>He stroked her cheek with the back of his hand. \u201cIt was war, Nicholaa, not a game,\u201d he whispered. \u201cAccept their tribute.\u201d</p><p>She slowly nodded, but she wasn\u2019t convinced.</p><p>Royce shook his head. \u201cNicholaa, I would never have allowed Clayton to repeat the tale if there had been mockery intended, and if I believed it was only a game to ease our soldiers\u2019 weariness, I would not have subjected you to this.\u201d</p> <p>She was at last appeased. In her heart, she knew Royce wouldn\u2019t allow anyone to mock her. The flowers suddenly took on new significance. She smiled at her husband and turned to pick one up, then stopped, realizing she couldn\u2019t grasp anything with her bandaged hands.</p><p>Royce picked up a white bloom and held it under her nose. She inhaled the light, sweet fragrance, then nudged the flower toward Royce. \u201cIt smells wonderful,\u201d she announced.</p><p>He inhaled the fragrance before tossing the flower back on the table. \u201cYou smell better.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t given time to say thank you. Royce turned when a friend called out to him, dismissing her then and there.</p><p>The celebration went on and on into the dark hours of the night. Most of the guests seemed to be enjoying themselves. One by one they came forward to speak to Nicholaa and offer their congratulations again. She was pleased by the good wishes, and she believed in her heart they were sincere. She also noticed several elderly Saxon barons mixing with the Normans. When she mentioned this to Royce, he explained that those who\u2019d pledged their fealty to William were now considered equal members of the realm. A very few were even allowed to retain a portion of their properties.</p><p>In the shadows near the alcove by the entrance, four men stood together, deep in discussion. Every now and then one would turn to look at Lady Nicholaa. The leader of the four stood in the center, dictating his orders. Each time he listed a command, the other three nodded agreement.</p><p>\u201cAre you certain she\u2019ll do it?\u201d one asked. He gave a worried glance over his shoulder just to make certain they weren\u2019t being overheard, then turned back to his leader. \u201cIf the plan doesn\u2019t work\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll be the one to suffer the consequences,\u201d the leader whispered.</p><p>\u201cShe might not cooperate,\u201d another pointed out.</p><p>The leader smiled. \u201cNicholaa is a Saxon, first and always. She\u2019ll do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then?\u201d the third asked.</p><p>\u201cShe dies.\u201d</p><p>Nicholaa had no idea she was the topic under discussion. She was jarred from her sleepy state by a sudden burst of raucous laughter from the alcove. She turned to see who was making all the commotion, but the crowd got in her way. The ale had been flowing freely for hours now, and she concluded that some of the less cautious knights had consumed too much of the sweet, intoxicating drink.</p><p>The burns were making her hands throb with pain now, and her skin itched. The soothing salve had worn off, she supposed.</p><p>\u201cRoyce? Would it be rude for me to leave now?\u201d she asked.</p><p>In answer her husband motioned to Lawrence.</p><p>The vassal put down his goblet and walked over to the table.</p><p>Nicholaa smiled at the knight before turning to Royce. \u201cAre you staying here?\u201d</p><p>He smiled. She was so sleepy that her eyelids were half closed. \u201cIt isn\u2019t rude for you to leave, Nicholaa, but I must stay here until King William ends the celebration. He must take his leave before I do.\u201d</p><p>She looked pleased with his explanation. He didn\u2019t know what to make of that. She had the smile of an angel, though, and he had an almost overwhelming urge to give her a real kiss.</p><p>\u201cYou do know what\u2019s proper behavior, after all,\u201d she said. \u201cNow I\u2019ll know that whenever you\u2019re rude to me, you\u2019re doing it on purpose and not because you\u2019re just plain ignorant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that makes you happy?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cA woman doesn\u2019t wish to be married to an ignorant man,\u201d she explained. \u201cI should warn you, Royce: now that I know you\u2019re aware of what you\u2019re doing, I\u2019m going to start retaliating in kind. That\u2019s only fair, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt certainly is. Why, I believe\u2014\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t let her finish. He kissed her, quick and hard, and when he pulled back, she was too bemused to remember what she\u2019d been talking about.</p><p>Damn, he wanted to kiss her thoroughly. He wanted her mouth open, his tongue inside . . . hell, he wanted a wedding night.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you frowning?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer her. He helped her to her feet instead. Nicholaa turned to thank the king and his wife.</p><p>Royce stood by her side, watching the way she won their smiles with her gentle, shyly whispered words.</p><p>She was such a fragile thing, and so very, very proper. Yes, an angel, but with a bit of the devil in her, too, if the sudden sparkle that came into her eyes was any indication.</p><p>\u201cWhen I get across the hall,\u201d she whispered, \u201cI just might stop and shout your name. Then I might motion for you to come to me. What do you suppose you\u2019ll do?\u201d</p><p>She was bluffing of course. She was too much of a lady to go to such undignified lengths just to even their positions.</p><p>Royce must have realized that fact, too. He winked at her, then motioned Lawrence closer.</p><p>\u201cMy wife\u2019s ready to leave now,\u201d he said. \u201cYou may escort her to our chamber.\u201d</p><p>Lawrence nodded and reached for Nicholaa\u2019s elbow. His baron\u2019s next command made him pause. \u201cIf Lady Nicholaa stops at the doorway, you have my permission to carry her to our chamber.\u201d</p><p>Nicholaa\u2019s eyes widened. She looked at Lawrence to see how he was reacting to such a shameful order and noticed he was trying not to smile. She glared at him, then turned to her husband. \u201cYou\u2019re horribly inconsiderate, Royce.\u201d</p><p>He smiled at her. \u201cYou wound me with such harsh criticism,\u201d he returned. \u201cI\u2019m never inconsiderate.\u201d</p><p>To prove his point he said, \u201cLawrence, if you have to toss my wife over your shoulder, don\u2019t touch her hands. They\u2019re still tender from her injuries.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Baron,\u201d Lawrence answered. \u201cI\u2019ll be careful.\u201d</p><p>Royce winked at Nicholaa. \u201cThere, wife, I\u2019ve just shown you how considerate I can be.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cYou know, Royce, every time I begin to think there might be a glimmer of hope for a peaceful future together, you say something to ruin it. You\u2019d better understand your new position, sir.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes had turned a deep violet. She was getting all worked up, he decided. He felt like laughing. His wife stood up to him with no fear in her expression, as though she thought she was his equal. Damn, she pleased him.</p><p>Lawrence watched his baron stare at Nicholaa and felt safe smiling. Royce was trying to intimidate his wife, but it wasn\u2019t working. The vassal could almost see the sparks flying between them. Lawrence thought Nicholaa might already be in love with Royce. She\u2019d certainly given him her loyalty. The way she\u2019d stood up to Guy was proof of that. He wondered if Royce realized his good fortune. It would take him a while to appreciate her value, of course, for he was a warrior, and warriors rarely thought about such insignificant matters.</p><p>\u201cNicholaa?\u201d Royce asked, drawing Lawrence\u2019s attention again. \u201cWhat did you mean when you said I didn\u2019t know what my position was?\u201d</p><p>She had to stop staring into his eyes so she could concentrate. He was a handsome man, even when he was insulting her. All she had to do was notice the beautiful gray flecks in his eyes and she\u2019d forget her own thoughts. She turned her gaze to his chest. \u201cNow isn\u2019t the time to discuss\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, but I want to hear your explanation now.\u201d He clasped his hands behind his back and patiently waited.</p><p>She took a deep breath. \u201cVery well,\u201d she said. \u201cIn a few days, we\u2019ll be going back to my holding, won\u2019t we?\u201d She didn\u2019t wait for him to agree. \u201cAnd you are married to me now.\u201d</p><p>It took him a full minute to realize she was finished. She was looking up at him with a hopeful expression on her face. He wanted to laugh. God, she was daft. \u201cYou haven\u2019t explained sufficiently for me to understand.\u201d</p><p>She lifted her shoulders in a shrug. She\u2019d hoped for privacy when she explained in full, but this opportunity was too good to pass up. She had his full attention now, and God only knew when that would happen again.</p><p>\u201cAs your wife, it\u2019s my duty to serve you, and as my husband, it\u2019s your duty to serve me.\u201d</p><p>He quit smiling. \u201cAnd how am I supposed to serve you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy following my directions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Nicholaa wasn\u2019t about to back down now, no matter how furious he became. The issue was too important. \u201cBy following my directions,\u201d she said again. \u201cIt won\u2019t be an easy adjustment. You are going to be the outsider. The servants at my holding are loyal to me, of course. Do you see how simple it is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNicholaa, it\u2019s my duty to protect you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat, too,\u201d she agreed. It took all she had to stand there. The look in his eyes was chilling. \u201cI would like to live in peace with you, Royce. If you\u2019ll only be patient\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m always patient,\u201d he snapped.</p><p>He didn\u2019t sound at all patient, but she decided not to argue with him. \u201cIn time you\u2019ll learn all our customs. I\u2019ll help you make this adjustment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou believe I\u2019m going to change my ways?\u201d His voice had gone hoarse.</p><p>\u201cI hadn\u2019t thought of it that way,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m very weary. Couldn\u2019t we discuss your new duties tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer her. He just stood there staring down at her with the oddest expression on his face.</p><p>Nicholaa thought it would be best if she took her leave now. She stretched up to kiss his cheek, then hurried toward the entrance. \u201cAren\u2019t you coming along, Lawrence?\u201d she called over her shoulder.</p><p>The vassal rushed after his mistress.</p><p>Nicholaa was feeling very pleased with herself. She\u2019d expressed her wishes, and Royce had listened. It was a fair start, she decided. In no time at all he\u2019d see how right she was. Royce was the outsider, and it was her holding, but he was intelligent and he\u2019d make the adjustment quickly. She was sure of it.</p><p>Lawrence didn\u2019t say a word to his mistress as he escorted her to her quarters. God\u2019s truth, he couldn\u2019t. He was too busy trying to contain his amusement. The incredulous look on Baron Royce\u2019s face would live in his memory for a long, long while.</p><p>\u201cThank you for giving me your escort, Lawrence,\u201d Nicholaa said when they reached her door. \u201cGood night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood night, my lady. Sleep well.\u201d</p><p>Nicholaa smiled at the two guards standing by the doorway, then went inside. One of the soldiers pulled the door closed behind her. She let out a loud sigh. A serving woman was waiting for her in the shadows by the hearth, but Nicholaa didn\u2019t notice her until she was halfway across the room. She came to quick stop and let out a gasp of surprise. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She hadn\u2019t seen this servant before. The woman was much older than Mary, rigid in bearing, with heavy brows and a heavier frown. She gestured Nicholaa forward.</p><p>The woman certainly wasn\u2019t acting like a servant. Nicholaa was immediately put on guard. \u201cWhat is your name?\u201d she asked. \u201cWhy isn\u2019t Mary here? She was assigned the duty of assisting me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy name isn\u2019t important,\u201d the woman answered in a low whisper. \u201cYou won\u2019t be seeing me again. As for the girl, I told her she was wanted in the kitchens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d Nicholaa asked. She noticed the woman\u2019s hands were hidden behind her back and took a cautious step back toward the doors and the guards.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve been ordered to give you a message and then leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho sends me this message?\u201d Nicholaa asked.</p><p>\u201cThe leader of those who resist the pretender they call king.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are Saxons here in London who resist?\u201d</p><p>The woman\u2019s frown deepened. \u201cHave you lost your loyalty already?\u201d she demanded.</p> <p>Nicholaa straightened her shoulders. \u201cGive me the name of your leader,\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know his name, and I wouldn\u2019t be giving it to you if I did. You haven\u2019t proved to be trustworthy yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have to prove anything to you,\u201d Nicholaa countered. \u201cNow give me this message and leave.\u201d</p><p>The woman pulled a sharp dagger from behind her back and held it up in front of Nicholaa. \u201cBaron Royce is the finest trainer of soldiers. If something happened to him, the army would suffer. William depends on this baron in all matters of war. Your husband is to be the first one we take away.\u201d</p><p>Nicholaa\u2019s gaze was riveted on the knife. She watched as the woman placed the dagger on the low chest next to the bed. The servant rushed across the chamber toward the door. \u201cKill him,\u201d she whispered. \u201cTonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Nicholaa shouted.</p> <p>The woman whirled around. \u201cDo you want the guards to hear you?\u201d</p><p>Nicholaa shook her head. She was terrified, but she didn\u2019t want the old hag to leave just yet. She was determined to learn the name of the man in charge of the resistance. More important, this woman might know what had happened to her brother Thurston, who had gone to the north to join Baron Alfred\u2019s army.</p><p>\u201cI ask you again to give me the name of your leader. Baron Alfred is the only Saxon I know of who continues to resist William. He and his men have their stronghold in the north, near my holding.\u201d</p><p>She would have continued, but the woman cut her off. \u201cMore than one group remains loyal to the old ways,\u201d she said. \u201cYou must prove your loyalty to us tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you suggest I kill my husband?\u201d Nicholaa asked. She lifted her bandaged hands. \u201cI cannot even hold a knife.\u201d</p><p>The woman looked startled. It was apparent she hadn\u2019t considered that problem.</p><p>Nicholaa said a quick prayer of thanksgiving that she hadn\u2019t been able to sway Baron Samuel into taking the bandages off. \u201cI could not kill my husband even if I wanted to,\u201d she said. There was a hint of victory in her voice, relief as well. She didn\u2019t think the woman noticed. She was glaring at Nicholaa\u2019s hands.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to find a way,\u201d the woman announced. \u201cHis death or yours.\u201d</p> <p>She was reaching for the door latch when Nicholaa said, \u201cIt would be my death regardless. William would retaliate.\u201d</p><p>The woman shook her head. \u201cAt dawn three men will come to take you away. The deed must be done before then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen they\u2019ll kill both of you.\u201d</p><p>The door closed on that threat.</p><p>Chapter Seven</p><p>Nicholaa knew she was going to be sick. The evil radiating from the woman made the chamber as frigid as death.</p><p>Royce came into the chamber approximately twenty minutes later. He wasn\u2019t at all certain what to expect from Nicholaa. She\u2019d either be sound asleep and looking like an innocent or wide awake and pacing while she thought of more outrageous opinions to share with him.</p><p>One thing was certain: just as soon as possible, he was going to set the woman straight. Granted, he\u2019d never been married before, and he didn\u2019t have a strong understanding of how a man and woman lived together in harmony. But then, she hadn\u2019t been married before, either. Still, the laws of marriage were the same for Saxons as they were for Normans, the rules set down by the church. The husband was lord of the manor, and his wife was simply his chattel.</p><p>Nicholaa had gotten everything turned around inside her head. Royce smiled then. It wasn\u2019t going to be easy for her, what with all the changes he would insist upon. One thing was certain, though: she would be the one doing all the adjusting, not he.</p><p>As soon as he walked into the chamber, he put the matter of lecturing his wife aside. Nicholaa didn\u2019t seem to be in any condition to listen to anything he had to say. She was kneeling on the floor by the bed, doubled over an empty chamber pot, gagging.</p><p>It was one hell of a greeting, he decided. He\u2019d heard about women coming down with wedding-night jitters, but Nicholaa\u2019s reaction went way beyond that. Was she so frightened of being bedded that she\u2019d made herself ill?</p><p>That possibility didn\u2019t sit well. He let out a loud sigh as he went over to the washbowl. After dipping a cloth in the cool water, he walked over to her.</p><p>Nicholaa was leaning back on her heels, trying to catch her breath when Royce scooped her up into his arms and sat down on the side of the bed. She ended up in his lap.</p><p>The minute he touched her, she started crying. Royce held the soggy cloth against her forehead. \u201cQuit your weeping,\u201d he ordered, \u201cand tell me what ails you.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t like his gruff tone of voice at all. \u201cNothing ails me,\u201d she lied.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d he agreed. \u201cThen tell me why you\u2019re weeping.\u201d</p><p>Now he sounded a little too reasonable. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean any of those nice things I said about you,\u201d she announced. She shoved the cloth away from her brow and turned in his arms so he could see her frown. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare believe I meant a single kind word I said.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, just to placate her. \u201cWhen did you say those things I\u2019m not supposed to believe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLast night,\u201d she answered. \u201cWhen Baron Guy was being such an arrogant nuisance.\u201d</p><p>Royce remembered and smiled, but Nicholaa was too overwhelmed by her worries to notice. The past few hours had left her spent. She collapsed against her husband\u2019s chest and closed her eyes. In the back of her mind she realized she wanted him to touch her, to comfort her. That didn\u2019t make any sense, but she wasn\u2019t in the mood to work it all out in her mind.</p><p>\u201cRoyce?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you hate me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you very angry I chose you for my husband?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you were,\u201d she whispered. \u201cNow you can\u2019t go back to Normandy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes that upset you?\u201d</p><p>He smiled again. He rested his chin on the top of her head. Nicholaa sounded worried. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, why not?\u201d</p><p>His sigh was long. \u201cDo you want to argue?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she answered. \u201cYou should go back to Normandy, Royce. Was there a special lady waiting for your return?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a little late to be concerned about that possibility, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes got teary again. \u201cI only just considered that possibility,\u201d she wailed. \u201cOh, God, I\u2019ve ruined your life, haven\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>He hugged her. \u201cNo, you haven\u2019t ruined my life,\u201d he answered. \u201cI didn\u2019t leave a woman behind in Normandy, Nicholaa.\u201d</p><p>She sagged against him. He concluded then that she was relieved by that news. \u201cMy family\u2019s there, of course,\u201d he told her. \u201cMy father\u2019s dead, but my mother\u2019s still alive. She\u2019s kept busy with my sisters and her grandchildren.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill I ever meet your family?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps,\u201d he answered.</p><p>He thought he\u2019d soothed her sufficiently to return to his question as to why she\u2019d been weeping and was just about to turn the topic back to that concern when she suddenly whispered, \u201cYou must go back to Normandy, Royce, if only for a nice long visit with your family.\u201d</p><p>The urgency in her tone wasn\u2019t lost on him. \u201cAnd why is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be safe there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just as safe here.\u201d</p><p>Nicholaa decided to take a different approach. \u201cI\u2019d like to leave this place as soon as possible, husband. Could we go now? The moon is sufficient to show us the way home.\u201d</p><p>There was a note of desperation in her voice. Royce nudged her chin up so he could see her expression. One look told him she was terrified. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d she blurted out. \u201cI just want to leave now.\u201d</p><p>She pushed his hand away from her chin and hid her face in the crook of his neck.</p><p>\u201cNicholaa? Are you so worried about my touching you that you\u2019ve made yourself ill?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about? You\u2019re touching me now, Royce.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat isn\u2019t what I meant,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I bed you . . .\u201d</p><p>He never got to finish. Her head came up with a start. Good God, she hadn\u2019t even thought about that. Leave it to him to add another worry to her growing list.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t expect me to sleep with you that way,\u201d she blurted out. \u201cI haven\u2019t even had time to think about that possibility. No, you can\u2019t expect\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do expect,\u201d he interrupted.</p><p>She stared into his eyes. He looked as if he meant what he said. Her face lost its color, and her heart started racing. Nicholaa burst into tears again.</p><p>Royce controlled his exasperation. He decided he shouldn\u2019t have mentioned that topic. When the time came to bed her, he\u2019d do just that, but he wouldn\u2019t give her time to let her fear catch hold of her.</p><p>\u201cNicholaa, do you trust me?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t even think about it before answering. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re not afraid of me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d he whispered. \u201cThen tell me why you\u2019re upset.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy hands and arms are burning something fierce,\u201d she muttered. \u201cI\u2019m in agony with all my worries. Royce, I\u2019m in no condition to let you touch me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me?\u201d He sounded more surprised than angry over her poor choice of words.</p><p>\u201cYou know my meaning,\u201d she cried out. \u201cHave you no sympathy?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. She guessed that he didn\u2019t.</p><p>If she hadn\u2019t been so busy trying to think of a plan to keep the man alive, she surely would have had time to think of a way to discourage him from exercising his husbandly rights.</p><p>She fell back against him again. \u201cI don\u2019t hate you, Royce, but at times I do dislike you.\u201d</p><p>He hugged her tight. Long minutes passed in silence. He was patiently waiting for her to calm down. He thought about how soft she was, how feminine her scent was, and how much he liked holding her in his arms.</p><p>She thought about the evil look on the woman\u2019s face when she relayed her message.</p><p>Royce felt her shiver in his arms. He tightened his hold. The candlelight flickered, drawing his attention. He saw the dagger on the chest, then frowned in reaction. He\u2019d left specific instructions the evening before that all weapons were to be removed from the chamber. Although he was certain that Nicholaa didn\u2019t have it in her nature to kill anyone, she could do a fair amount of damage in an attempt to escape.</p><p>He smiled then. He was certain that if she had injured one of his soldiers, she\u2019d be sure to apologize afterward.</p><p>The woman was still a puzzle to him, but he was beginning to understand a few of her quirks.</p><p>\u201cNicholaa? Do you still think to escape?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a married woman now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d he prodded when she didn\u2019t continue.</p><p>She let out a sigh. \u201cIf I escaped, you\u2019d have to come with me.\u201d</p><p>Nicholaa was just realizing her remark was absurd when he said, \u201cWhere did the dagger come from?\u201d</p><p>She tensed against him. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you do,\u201d he answered. \u201cDon\u2019t lie to me, Nicholaa.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t say another word for a long while. \u201cIt\u2019s a long story,\u201d she finally whispered. \u201cSurely you don\u2019t wish to hear it now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I do wish to hear it now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn old woman gave me the dagger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTonight. I don\u2019t want to talk about it,\u201d she cried out. \u201cI just want you to take me away from here tonight. Please, Royce?\u201d</p><p>He acted as though he hadn\u2019t even heard her plea. \u201cWhy did she give you the dagger?\u201d</p><p>She was going to have to tell him everything. He wasn\u2019t going to let up. Besides, she reasoned, she needed his help with this worry, and God only knew he needed her warning. \u201cShe said I\u2019m supposed to kill you with it.\u201d</p><p>She waited a long while for Royce to react to her announcement before she realized he wasn\u2019t going to say anything. Didn\u2019t he believe her?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not jesting,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI\u2019m really supposed to kill you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d he asked, sounding incredulous. \u201cYou can\u2019t even hold a dagger in your hands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mentioned that very problem to the messenger,\u201d she muttered. \u201cI was told to find a way. The more you doubt my word, Royce, the more convinced I am that it wouldn\u2019t be too difficult.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNicholaa, you couldn\u2019t kill me.\u201d</p><p>He sounded pleased with that evaluation. He gently brushed the hair away from her temple. It felt like a caress from a husband who cared about his wife.</p><p>God, she was tired. Surely that was the reason her eyes clouded with tears again. \u201cJust when I was beginning to think the war was finally over and we could all live in peace together, this had to happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe war is over,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re worrying over nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t believe me, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t have to,\u201d she cried out. \u201cI have proof, husband.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDo you mean the dagger?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she answered. \u201cMy proof will arrive at dawn. Three men are coming. If I haven\u2019t killed you by then, they\u2019re going to kill both of us. Then you\u2019ll know I was telling you the truth.\u201d</p><p>He leaned down and kissed her brow. \u201cYou really are telling me the truth, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow could you believe I\u2019d make up something this vile?\u201d</p> <p>She moved away from his shoulder so she could glare at him. She was surprised to see how furious he was, for his voice had been mild when he spoke to her. She lost her frown immediately and nodded with satisfaction. It was high time the man showed a proper reaction.</p><p>Lord, she was relieved, too. His anger actually comforted her. He would know what to do. He\u2019d take care of this threat. She snuggled up against him and let out a loud, unladylike yawn. \u201cNow do you see why I thought we should leave tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNicholaa, I want you to start at the beginning,\u201d he ordered. \u201cTell me exactly what happened.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t argue with him. When she finished her explanation, he was squeezing her hard around her waist. He was frowning like a devil, too. The scar on his face had turned stark white again. He looked like a warrior now, even though he wasn\u2019t dressed in battle gear.</p><p>The strangest feeling came over her. God\u2019s truth, he made her feel safe. How long had it been since she\u2019d felt that way? Nicholaa couldn\u2019t remember.</p> <p>She didn\u2019t even worry about leaving now. Royce would protect her no matter where they were.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take care of it, Nicholaa.\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cStand up now and let me help you get your clothes off,\u201d he said quietly.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p> <p>He ignored the startled tone in her voice. \u201cSo you can sleep, wife. I\u2019ll wait until your hands have healed before bedding you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, you don\u2019t have to sound so relieved.\u201d</p><p>His surly tone of voice told her she\u2019d offended him. She guessed she\u2019d dented his pride. She stood up and faced him. \u201cRoyce, the first time between a husband and a wife should be special, shouldn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>She was blushing like a virgin. She couldn\u2019t look him in the eye, either. Her gaze was centered on the floor. He couldn\u2019t resist goading her just a little. \u201cBut you\u2019ve been married before, remember? You\u2019ve had a child, too, or have you forgotten Ulric?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I remember Ulric,\u201d she rushed out. \u201cI was just trying to explain that, with or without experience, the first time between us should be . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpecial?\u201d he said when she didn\u2019t continue.</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI would rather not have to worry about someone putting a dagger between your shoulder blades while you\u2019re . . . otherwise occupied.\u201d</p> <p>He untied her belt, tossed it aside, and then stood up. He tried to detach himself from what he was doing as he pulled the bliaut up, over her head. The rest of her clothes followed, save for the thin-as-air chemise.</p><p>A heavy silence fell between them. She stood as still as a statue. She didn\u2019t feel like one, though. Royce was already regretting his rash promise not to bed her.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t mention your own shoulder blades,\u201d he remarked in an attempt to ease the tension building inside him. \u201cYou could well be the first to feel the enemy\u2019s blade.\u201d His voice sounded harsh to him.</p><p>She stood before him, her toes curled into the rushes, her head bowed low. Lord, she was even more beautiful without her clothes on. Her legs were so incredibly long. Her skin was smooth all over, and in the flickering candlelight she looked like a golden goddess from magical days.</p><p>The provocative scoop-neck chemise left little to his imagination. The swell of her full br**sts pressing against the embroidered fabric made his chest tighten.</p><p>Yes, she was beautiful. And she belonged to him.</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t let anyone hurt me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said you wouldn\u2019t let anyone hurt me.\u201d</p><p>It took all his discipline to concentrate on the conversation. \u201cNo, I wouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you frowning? Are you angry with me?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head and almost laughed. The innocent had absolutely no idea what thoughts were going through his mind. He took a deep breath and then put his bride to bed. He covered her with the blankets and turned back to the door.</p><p>\u201cNicholaa?\u201d he called over his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen we reach my holding,\u201d he said, stressing his ownership. \u201cI won\u2019t allow any more lies. From the moment we take up residence, you\u2019ll always tell me the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you thinking I lied about the woman telling me to kill you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he answered. He turned and stared at her. \u201cI\u2019m talking about the other lies you\u2019ve told me. They end when we reach Rosewood. Give me your promise.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to promise him anything. \u201cWhat lies do you mean?\u201d she asked, trying to find out exactly what he knew.</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t necessary for me to explain,\u201d he countered. \u201cJust promise me, Nicholaa.\u201d A hard glint came into his eyes as he waited for her to give him what he wanted.</p><p>\u201cRoyce, understand this,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI will do whatever I have to do to protect Ulric and Justin. That promise I give you now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs lying to me your way of protecting them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the past, when I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m talking about the future,\u201d he interrupted. \u201cFrom the minute we reach Rosewood,\u201d he added. \u201cNo more lies.\u201d</p><p>She took a deep breath. \u201cAll right,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI promise you there won\u2019t be any more lies.\u201d</p><p>Royce turned around and started for the door again. He\u2019d already dismissed his wife from his thoughts. There was much to be done before dawn. He had reached for the door latch when Nicholaa called out to him.</p><p>\u201cRoyce, my father always kissed my mother good night. It was a family tradition.\u201d</p><p>He turned back to her. \u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a Saxon tradition, too.\u201d Another minute passed. \u201cI was just wondering if it was a Norman tradition, too.\u201d She was trying to act nonchalant.</p><p>He shrugged his answer.</p><p>\u201cTraditions should be continued, Royce, especially during unsettled times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>The man wasn\u2019t catching on. It was apparent he still didn\u2019t understand she wanted him to kiss her. \u201cSo they won\u2019t be forgotten,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>\u201cNicholaa? Do you want me to kiss you?\u201d</p><p>So much for subtlety, she thought to herself. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>As soon as she saw him coming toward her, she closed her eyes. Royce sat down on the side of the bed. He leaned down and kissed her brow. She told him thank you. He kissed the bridge of her nose. She said thank you again.</p><p>Her face looked as if it had been burned by the sun. He knew she was embarrassed, but didn\u2019t have the faintest idea why. He was too pleased that she wanted his touch to dwell on her daft behavior.</p><p>\u201cTraditions are v-very important to m-me,\u201d she stammered. \u201cNow that you\u2019re my husband, they have to be important to you, too.\u201d</p><p>That statement gave him pause. \u201cThey do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she answered. She opened her eyes to look up at him. \u201cIt\u2019s not that I want you to kiss me. It\u2019s just that\u2014\u201d</p><p>She quit trying to explain when his mouth settled on hers. He stole her concentration completely. His mouth was so wonderfully warm. His fingers threaded through her hair to hold her captive, although that wasn\u2019t really necessary; she didn\u2019t want to move. The kiss was gentle, undemanding. It left her breathless. And wanting.</p><p>Royce pulled back just a little. \u201cOpen your mouth for me, Nicholaa,\u201d he Whispered.</p><p>She barely had time to do as he commanded before his mouth took possession again. His tongue swept inside her mouth then, to taste, to stroke, to drive her wild.</p><p>He held her still as his mouth slanted over hers again and again. He felt her tremble, and in the back of his mind was the thought that he was probably scaring the hell out of her. She was such an innocent.</p><p>Then her tongue touched his and she let out a low, ragged moan. He could feel the passion in her response. Stunned, he damn near lost his control then and there.</p><p>He forced himself to pull back. His smile was tender when he saw the result of his touch. Her lips were swollen, rosy, and she wore the most astonished expression.</p><p>He rubbed his thumb across her lower lip.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe my father ever kissed my mother quite like that,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>There was a definite sparkle in her eyes. He realized she was teasing him. He responded in kind. \u201cWith all those children? I think he did.\u201d</p><p>He bent down and kissed her again, a quick no-nonsense kiss without a hint of passion in it. She couldn\u2019t hide her disappointment when he stood up. \u201cNow go to sleep, Nicholaa,\u201d he ordered. \u201cThe tradition has been continued.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t say thank you. She sighed instead. Nicholaa was sound asleep before Royce reached the door.</p><p>Two fresh guards had just arrived to replace the pair in the hallway. All four soldiers were seasoned knights under Royce\u2019s command. One soldier held a goblet filled with the sleeping draft the healer had just delivered. Royce ordered the soldier to throw it away. He then commanded another guard to tell Lawrence he needed to speak to him.</p><p>The second-in-command arrived a few minutes later. Royce still hadn\u2019t dismissed the soldiers from their watch. He leaned against the door and quickly explained the situation. When he was finished, he gave his orders.</p><p>By Royce\u2019s command, the leader of the king\u2019s guard was to be alerted of the possible threat immediately, and the number of men on the night watch would be tripled. A clean sweep was to be made of the castle and the grounds. The old woman who\u2019d told Nicholaa to kill him might still be lingering nearby, and Royce wanted her found.</p><p>\u201cWhat about the men who are coming to challenge you at dawn?\u201d Lawrence asked when Royce had finished giving his orders.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take care of that possible threat,\u201d Royce answered. \u201cI hold little hope they\u2019ll actually show up, though. They used the old woman to give Nicholaa her duty and will now leave her to suffer the consequences on her own. It would be too dangerous for them to try to get to either one of us.\u201d He expelled a long breath. \u201cGod, I hope I\u2019m wrong,\u201d he admitted. \u201cI would like for them to try. I want a chance to kill the bastards. They frightened my wife.\u201d</p><p>Lawrence noticed that his baron seemed more furious over the fact that Nicholaa had been frightened than he did over the possibility that someone was trying to kill him. It was a telling reaction, to the vassal\u2019s way of thinking.</p><p>After bowing, Lawrence and the other soldiers left to carry out their assignments. Royce stood with his back protecting the door until two of the soldiers returned. He went back inside the chamber when the hallway was once again guarded by his trusted men.</p><p>Less than an hour later a knock sounded. Royce had the door open before Lawrence had let his hand drop back to his side.</p><p>The vassal moved out of the way so Royce could join him in the corridor. \u201cWe found the old woman,\u201d he announced in a low voice. \u201cShe\u2019s dead. Her neck was broken. Someone tossed her body behind a couple of crates. Do we round up all the Saxons in residence and question them?\u201d</p><p>Royce shook his head. \u201cThe Saxon barons who have pledged their loyalty to William would be insulted by our distrust. That wouldn\u2019t matter to our king, of course, but it wouldn\u2019t serve our purposes. If there is a Saxon traitor in league with those who still resist the king, he certainly won\u2019t give us any answers. We\u2019ll have to find another way to ferret out the bastard.\u201d</p><p>Lawrence nodded agreement. \u201cThere are many people here, Baron,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t recognize a fair number of them. The crowd will make it difficult for us to find the culprit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn, I wish we could set a trap now and be done with it,\u201d Royce muttered.</p><p>\u201cA trap with you as the bait?\u201d Lawrence asked. \u201cIt would be too difficult to control the outcome, my lord.\u201d</p><p>Royce shrugged. \u201cIt could be done,\u201d he countered. \u201cStill, I won\u2019t take the chance. Nicholaa\u2019s safety comes first. I\u2019m anxious to get her home. Once I\u2019m certain no one can get to her, I can turn my attention to finding the bastard behind this scheme. This isn\u2019t finished, Lawrence. They\u2019ll try again. I\u2019m sure of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen do you wish to leave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTomorrow, by midday,\u201d Royce answered. \u201cI\u2019ll talk to William in the morning.\u201d</p><p>Royce dismissed his vassal and went back inside the chamber. Nicholaa was sleeping soundly. The dark smudges under her eyes were still noticeable, and he wished he could let her stay in London a few more days, until she regained her strength.</p><p>There wasn\u2019t time, however. He wouldn\u2019t rest until he knew she was safe. His gentle wife didn\u2019t appear worried, though. She couldn\u2019t have slept so peacefully if she had been.</p><p>He tucked the covers around her shoulders. Wives were a damn nuisance, he decided. If a husband cared about his wife, the enemy could use her to get to him. They could, in effect, use her as a weapon to destroy him.</p><p>If a husband cared, he thought again.</p><p>He was desperate to get Nicholaa home to Rosewood where she would be safe. He shook his head. The evidence couldn\u2019t be denied. How in God\u2019s name had it happened? And so quickly, too? He thought about the week of hell she\u2019d put him through on the journey to London, and had to shake his head again.</p><p>And then he grinned. He didn\u2019t understand how or why it had happened. Only one thing was certain: he cared.</p><p>Chapter Eight</p><p>The assassins didn\u2019t arrive at dawn.</p><p>Royce wasn\u2019t surprised. He was disappointed, though.</p><p>He let Nicholaa sleep several more hours before finally prodding her awake. She was pleased to hear that no one had tried to breach their quarters.</p><p>Baron Samuel arrived a few minutes later. Royce helped Nicholaa into her robe and stood like a sentry by her side while the healer looked at her injuries. As soon as Lawrence arrived, Royce took his leave to speak to the king.</p><p>Samuel wrapped fresh bandages around Nicholaa\u2019s hands and arms. The healer had promised to leave the bindings off, but since she was leaving for her home, he thought the raw skin should be protected from the brittle winter air. She didn\u2019t argue with him, however. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Samuel left her a small packet of herbs with instructions to mix a pinch with clear water to make a salve to apply to the injuries each morning.</p><p>Nicholaa thanked him profusely. Mary, the sweet-tempered serving girl, was waiting to help her mistress dress when Royce walked into the room and motioned to her to leave.</p><p>\u201cI would like Mary to stay,\u201d Nicholaa said. \u201cI need her assistance, Royce.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll help you,\u201d Royce answered. \u201cLawrence, see to your duties now. We\u2019ll leave in one hour.\u201d He held up the packet of herbs. \u201cWhat is this?\u201d he demanded.</p> <p>She told him. When she\u2019d finished her explanation, Royce walked over to the hearth and tossed the packet into the fire. Nicholaa was too astonished to try to stop him.</p><p>\u201cWhy in heaven\u2019s name did you do that?\u201d</p><p>He wouldn\u2019t answer her. His mood didn\u2019t improve, either. He finally allowed Mary to come back into the chamber, though, when Nicholaa asked him to braid her hair. He couldn\u2019t be bothered to perform such a menial task, of course, but he wouldn\u2019t leave the chamber, either. Poor Mary was so intimidated by his presence that she couldn\u2019t get the braid done. Her hands were shaking too much.</p><p>As soon as Nicholaa dismissed the servant, she turned to Royce. \u201cWhat is the matter with you? Don\u2019t you trust me enough to let me have a few minutes alone with my servant to see to personal matters, husband? Do you still believe I would try to escape? Is that the reason for your irritable mood?\u201d</p><p>He looked exasperated with her. \u201cI\u2019m thinking of your safety, wife,\u201d he announced. \u201cI don\u2019t trust any of the servants. The sooner we leave for home, the better my mood will be.\u201d</p> <p>She shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m not the one in danger, husband,\u201d she countered. \u201cYou are. Besides, the servants are in the king\u2019s employ. Surely none of them would try to harm me.\u201d</p><p>He clasped his hands behind his back and scowled at her. \u201cNicholaa, it\u2019s obvious that not all the servants are loyal to William. The old woman who came into our chamber last night to give you your assignment certainly wasn\u2019t loyal. There could be others. You\u2019re as much in jeopardy as I am,\u201d he added.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>He let out a sigh. \u201cYou\u2019re my wife now. The Saxons could use you to get to me. That\u2019s why. Now quit your questions. It\u2019s time we left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow could the enemy use me to get to you?\u201d she asked, completely ignoring his order to stop questioning him.</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer her.</p> <p>They left London a few minutes later. Nicholaa rode with Royce. She noticed that the soldiers who escorted them were older than the ones who\u2019d accompanied them to London. The younger knights now rode at the back of the procession.</p><p>\u201cHow many ride with us?\u201d she asked Royce.</p><p>\u201cEnough.\u201d</p><p>Now what did that mean? Nicholaa decided against prodding her husband for an answer. The set of his jaw indicated he wasn\u2019t in the mood for conversation.</p><p>By the time they made camp for the night, Nicholaa was too exhausted to care about her husband\u2019s mood. She slept inside the small tent on a pallet of furs he\u2019d fashioned for her, but when she awakened during the night she found herself snuggled up on Royce\u2019s lap. She didn\u2019t know how she\u2019d gotten there.</p><p>Two days later, riding at breakneck pace, they arrived at the edge of Nicholaa\u2019s holding. They wouldn\u2019t reach the keep until the following morning, however, for the hills they still had to climb would make the journey arduous. They would have to slow their pace.</p><p>Nicholaa didn\u2019t mind. The weather had taken a turn for the better. The sun shone bright, and the breeze had lost a little of its winter sting. The scent of spring was in the air. Nicholaa\u2019s spirits lifted. She listed all the things she would do as soon as she arrived home. First she would change her clothes, and then she\u2019d hurry over to the abbey to see Justin and Ulric.</p><p>She told Royce her intentions while they ate supper together.</p> <p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t leaving Rosewood,\u201d he announced. He handed her a thick crust of bread. \u201cJustin and Ulric will come to you.\u201d</p><p>She must have been overly tired from the long day\u2019s ride. Surely that was the reason she became so irritated with her husband now. \u201cWhy must you be so difficult to get along with?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>He seemed genuinely surprised by her question. \u201cI\u2019m not difficult to get along with,\u201d he countered.</p><p>He suddenly reached out and pulled her onto his lap. He wrapped one arm around her waist. When she turned to protest, he shoved a bit of cheese into her mouth.</p><p>Neither said a word until the meal was finished. Then Nicholaa leaned back against Royce\u2019s shoulder and said, \u201cAre you going to be pleasant once we reach home?\u201d</p><p>That question was too foolish to answer. He was always pleasant\u2014except, of course, when he was in battle. He wasn\u2019t pleasant then. Lord, he was too weary to think about such things now. \u201cAre you ready to sleep?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ready to talk to my husband,\u201d she muttered. \u201cI would like to discuss our future.\u201d</p><p>She tilted her face up, and Royce leaned down and kissed her. Hard. He thought only to turn her thoughts away from nagging him into conversation, but the kiss quickly overshadowed all other motives.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t a gentle kiss. It was hot, demanding, thoroughly arousing. He couldn\u2019t seem to get enough of her. His tongue swept inside to mate with hers. He let out a low growl that mingled with her sigh of pleasure.</p><p>In no time at all she forgot where they were. Royce didn\u2019t. He ended the kiss and pushed her head down on his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cYou will sleep now,\u201d he ordered.</p><p>She was too shaken to answer. Her face rested against his chest, and she could hear his heart racing. Nicholaa suddenly didn\u2019t mind his abruptness; her discovery was too pleasing. Royce might not want to admit it, but the kiss had affected him, too.</p><p>She let out a little sigh, closed her eyes, and yawned. She was just about to drift off to sleep when Royce whispered her name.</p><p>\u201cNicholaa?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Royce?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour hands will be healed in two days.\u201d</p><p>His voice had turned hard, demanding. \u201cThey will?\u201d she asked, wondering how he could make such a prophecy. What did it matter to him how long it took for the injuries to heal?</p><p>And then she remembered. He\u2019d promised her he wouldn\u2019t bed her until the bandages were off. Nicholaa smiled.</p><p>He wanted her. She thought she should probably be a little frightened of the bedding to come, for the unknown was always worrisome. Her mother had told her only that it was a commonplace occurrence between husband and wife, necessary for the begetting of heirs, and fully approved by the church.</p><p>None of those reasons eased her worry as much as Royce\u2019s gentle touch did, though. He really wanted her. That was all that mattered to her now. Nicholaa suddenly needed to hear him tell her so. \u201cWill you be pleased when my hands are healed?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer her for the longest while. He tightened his hold around her waist, rubbed his chin against the top of her head, and when she\u2019d finally come to the conclusion that he wasn\u2019t going to say anything more, he spoke. \u201cYes, Nicholaa, I\u2019ll be pleased.\u201d</p><p>Her heartbeat quickened when she heard the caress in his voice.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t go to sleep for a long time. Her mind was racing with all the new responsibilities she now had to take on as wife and mistress of Rosewood.</p><p>Her mother had taught her all the gentle skills a lady should possess, but she hadn\u2019t said much about a wife\u2019s duties to her husband. Nicholaa did know, however, that as mistress of Rosewood, it would be up to her to create a happy, peaceful home.</p><p>Her mother had taught by example, not by lecture. Her father had liked order, Nicholaa remembered, and her mother had seen that he got it. She\u2019d pampered him and, by her actions, taught him to pamper her. No matter what chaos ruled beyond the walls, when her father returned to his home, Nicholaa\u2019s mother would rush outside to greet him. Sometimes Nicholaa would stand by her mother\u2019s side on the top step of the castle. Her father, a fierce-looking man when dressed in battle gear, would usually be scowling and looking weary to his bones as he rode up the last hill. Nicholaa was never afraid of him, though. She knew her mother could cajole him out of his black mood, so magical was her smile.</p><p>It always worked. By the time her father reached the bottom step, he\u2019d be smiling, too. He\u2019d kiss his wife, hoist Nicholaa up on his shoulders, and then decree in a booming voice that he was a starving man in need of his supper.</p><p>Nicholaa was comforted by that memory from childhood. A man\u2019s home should be a sanctuary, she decided, a haven of peace and safety and\u2014sometimes \u2014love.</p><p>Making Royce\u2019s life a living hell wasn\u2019t a consideration now. She would only be hurting herself if she acted like a shrew. She was a grown woman now. It was time to behave like one.</p><p>There was also Ulric to think about. He\u2019d lost his mama during the birthing, and Nicholaa became more convinced each day that Ulric\u2019s papa was also dead. Thurston would have sent word to her if he\u2019d survived the last battle.</p><p>She and Justin were Ulric\u2019s only family now. But there was Royce, too. Was he willing to become Ulric\u2019s father? Would he teach the boy all the lessons a father should teach his son? Nicholaa thought about the gentle way Royce had held the baby in his arms when he came to collect her from the abbey. In her heart, she was convinced he\u2019d protect Ulric. Perhaps, in time, he would even begin to care for the child as his own.</p><p>Ulric needed a tranquil home. Nicholaa vowed then and there to put her criticisms aside. She would learn to bend a little in order to get along with her husband, and she\u2019d teach him to bend, too.</p><p>Nicholaa snuggled up against Royce while she considered her new plan.</p><p>He told her to be still.</p><p>His voice was gruff, filled with sleepy irritation. Yet he rubbed her back when he gave the command.</p><p>She was content. The future seemed filled with promise, now that she\u2019d worked it all out in her mind.</p><p>It was all so simple. Royce was the first trainer of men. His duty had been determined years before, when William recognized his talent. Matilda had told Nicholaa several stories about Royce\u2019s mighty feats. She\u2019d been duly impressed.</p><p>Nicholaa decided not to interfere with her husband\u2019s primary duties. She\u2019d stay out of his way while he turned ordinary men into invincible warriors.</p><p>She had only just decided upon her duty, however. She wasn\u2019t sure how to begin. Only one thing was certain: she and Royce were going to live together in peace and harmony even if it killed him.</p><p>Yes, she thought to herself, Royce would train his men.</p><p>And she would train him.</p><p>She had dreamed of living happily ever after, but on the following morning, Nicholaa\u2019s certainty that the future would be filled with joy and peace was put to a terrifying test.</p><p>The procession had ridden for nearly an hour when they reached a narrow trail that led to the top of a steep hill. Royce hadn\u2019t taken the lead, but rode in the center of his men, with Nicholaa riding by herself directly behind him, the reins wrapped around her wrist.</p><p>Royce suddenly called a halt and took over the lead, leaving Nicholaa at the base of the hill with soldiers surrounding her. He then led the first twenty soldiers to the crest above.</p><p>It was a perfect place for an ambush, Royce thought. The pathway up the hill was so narrow that his men had to ride in single file.</p><p>Royce returned for Nicholaa after the first group had spread out over the crest, their arrows nocked in preparation for a sneak attack. Nicholaa thought Royce was being overly cautious. They were almost home now, and surely the resisters to William\u2019s rule had better things to do than attack such an isolated holding.</p><p>The set of her husband\u2019s jaw told Nicholaa to keep her opinion to herself. She felt comforted by the extreme measures he was taking to keep everyone safe, even though they seemed a bit excessive.</p><p>The attack caught her completely by surprise. It came when the last soldier reached the crest.</p><p>Royce sounded the battle cry. The earth-shuddering shout nearly jarred her off her mount. She was suddenly surrounded by soldiers, their shields up, protecting her from harm.</p><p>Arrows rained down on them from the surrounding hills. The attackers swarmed over the hills like locusts in search of prey.</p><p>Nicholaa watched as Royce drew his sword. He nudged his stallion into a gallop, then swung the sword high above his head. It was a magnificent sight. Terrifying, too. Nicholaa murmured fast and furious Pater Nosters that God would keep her husband safe.</p><p>The soldier behind her let out a cry and fell to the ground. Nicholaa turned and saw more resisters coming up the hill from their hiding places below.</p><p>The soldiers surrounding her immediately changed tactics. One slapped Nicholaa\u2019s horse and shouted the order to ride to the west ridge.</p><p>Nicholaa had trouble controlling her mount. She couldn\u2019t grasp the reins with enough strength to direct the animal. The horse veered to the east. A soldier shouted to her not to ride in the direction Royce had taken.</p><p>Nicholaa paid no attention. She wanted to find her husband, to make certain he was safe, before she took cover. Her gaze scanned the hills while she frantically repeated her prayers.</p><p>Royce and his soldiers were within striking distance of the first wave of outcasts when Nicholaa spotted him.</p><p>Dear God, why did he have to be so big? He was such an easy target. Surely the enemy would take him down first.</p><p>Nicholaa tried to slow down her mount. She didn\u2019t want to get in her husband\u2019s way. The distraction could well cost him his life. Her attention was drawn to the top of the ridge just as she was nudging her horse to the west. A beam of sunlight bounced off the enemy\u2019s chest armor, blinding her.</p><p>She shifted in the saddle and looked up again. A lone rider, dressed in Saxon battle attire, suddenly raised his hand high into the air\u2014a signal for the remaining horsemen to take up the attack. Approximately fifty Saxon soldiers, shouting their battle cry, galloped down the ridge.</p><p>Nicholaa couldn\u2019t take her gaze away from the leader. Sunlight shone all around him, giving him an almost mystical appearance. The light acted like a mirror, making him seem to be closer than he really was.</p><p>When the leader turned in his saddle and reached for an arrow, Nicholaa saw his profile.</p><p>She understood then why she\u2019d been so mesmerized.</p><p>The Saxon leader was aiming at a target, his arrow nocked, his bowstring pulled taut.</p><p>Nicholaa started screaming.</p><p>Her brother Thurston was alive. And he was preparing to kill Royce.</p><p>Chapter Nine</p><p>Royce turned when he heard Nicholaa\u2019s scream. He slowed his horse just as she goaded hers into a full gallop. She reached his side and literally threw herself into his arms. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She was just in time. She took the arrow that was meant for him. The force of the arrow threw her hard against him. He caught her, then tried to force her down onto his lap so that his shield could protect her. He realized then that Nicholaa was pinned to him. The arrow had gone through her shoulder and into his hauberk.</p><p>Royce\u2019s anguished bellow echoed from above the ridge. He turned his mount and urged the big stallion toward the safety of the trees to the west. Nicholaa\u2019s long golden hair covered her injury, and though Lawrence hadn\u2019t witnessed the attack, his baron\u2019s shout told him something terrible had happened to his mistress. The vassal motioned to three other seasoned soldiers to follow their lord, then ordered another to command the raging battle. Then Lawrence followed his baron into the trees.</p><p>Royce thought Nicholaa had fainted. He considered that a blessing, for she wouldn\u2019t feel the pain when he pulled the arrow from her shoulder.</p><p>He was just about to dismount when she said, \u201cForgive him, Royce. He didn\u2019t know. He couldn\u2019t have known.\u201d</p> <p>Royce didn\u2019t understand what she was talking about. When she went limp in his arms, he knew she couldn\u2019t answer his questions now. He couldn\u2019t have formed a logical question anyway, for his rage at what had just happened held his full attention.</p><p>Lawrence jumped from his mount and spread his cloak on the ground. He reached up to take Nicholaa from Royce so he could dismount without jarring her. Royce shook his head. \u201cShe\u2019s still pinned to me,\u201d he announced, his voice filled with anguish.</p><p>He didn\u2019t allow his vassal to assist him. His hands shook as he pulled the tip of the arrow from his hauberk, then took a calming breath before he dismounted. He couldn\u2019t stand to think about the torment to come. He laid Nicholaa\u2019s limp body on the cloak, snapped off the arrowhead, and slipped the shaft free.</p><p>She screamed. The sound tore at his heart. He whispered broken words of comfort as blood poured from her injury down upon his arm.</p><p>Lawrence was far more experienced at taking care of injuries than his overlord was. Royce\u2019s mind understood that fact well enough, but his heart didn\u2019t understand it at all. Lawrence tried three times before his leader would let him near Nicholaa.</p> <p>She was just coming out of her swoon when the vassal poured liquid fire over her shoulder. She didn\u2019t scream this time; she roared. She lunged up at her tormentor, too. Royce had to hold her down. If she\u2019d had a dagger, she might have killed the man who was trying to help her.</p><p>The concern on Lawrence\u2019s face finally penetrated her stupor. Her mind suddenly cleared. She realized she was shouting then and fell silent.</p><p>Royce was kneeling on the ground beside her, his hand on her other shoulder. Nicholaa took one look at the chilling expression on his face and almost fainted again. Lord, he looked furious. He seemed to want to kill someone, she thought, and since he was staring down at her so intently, she could only surmise she was the victim he had in mind. How dare he scowl at her? She\u2019d just saved his life, hadn\u2019t she?</p><p>Oh, God, her brother Thurston had tried to kill Royce. It was too much to take in. Dear Lord, what was she going to do? Thurston was alive. But for how long?</p><p>She turned to look at her injury as Lawrence tore the bliaut away from her shoulder with his dagger.</p><p>Nicholaa realized it wasn\u2019t a fatal injury. The cut was deep, aye, but the bleeding had already slowed to a trickle.</p> <p>Royce turned her face away. \u201cDon\u2019t look at it,\u201d he ordered. \u201cIt will only upset you.\u201d</p><p>His voice shook. She thought it was because his throat was strained from not being able to shout at her.</p><p>Thurston was alive, and he was trying to kill Royce. Her husband would certainly try to kill Thurston, too, given the chance. What was she going to do?</p><p>She decided to take the coward\u2019s way out. She struggled to sit up, then pretended that the movement made her head spin. She slumped against Royce\u2019s side, whispered a pitiful plea that he put his arm around her waist to steady her, and closed her eyes.</p><p>A wave of nausea caught her by surprise. She wasn\u2019t sure if it was a reaction to her trickery or if she had lost more blood than she\u2019d realized.</p><p>Lawrence lifted the hem of her gown, tore off a strip of her chemise, and began wrapping her throbbing shoulder.</p><p>Nicholaa looked down at the ragged bandages covering her hands and had to shake her head over her own condition. Lord, she was a mess. Since meeting Royce, she\u2019d suffered one injury or indignity after another. If this continued, she\u2019d be dead in a week.</p><p>She started to mention this to her husband, just to prick his pride, but suddenly the light-headed feeling she\u2019d pretended to experience only minutes before, came on all at once. She wasn\u2019t pretending this time when she asked Royce to tighten his hold.</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t decide if I\u2019m going to lose my supper or swoon,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Royce fervently hoped she\u2019d swoon. She proved to be accommodating.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s sleeping again,\u201d Lawrence remarked.</p><p>Royce nodded. His voice was ragged when he said, \u201cShe\u2019s lost so much blood.\u201d</p><p>The anguish in his lord\u2019s voice wasn\u2019t lost on the vassal. \u201cNay, Royce,\u201d he replied. \u201cOnly a fair amount. She should be fully recovered in a week or two.\u201d</p><p>Neither warrior spoke again until Lawrence finished his ministrations. Royce allowed the vassal to hold Nicholaa while he remounted and then took Nicholaa into his lap. He noticed that the white bandage on her shoulder had already turned red. \u201cShe could bleed to death before we reach home,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>Lawrence shook his head. \u201cThe flow has already eased,\u201d he said. \u201cRoyce, I don\u2019t understand your reaction. This isn\u2019t a life threatening injury.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t wish to discuss my reaction,\u201d Royce interjected.</p><p>The vassal quickly nodded agreement. He regained his mount before speaking again. \u201cWhy did she interfere, my lord? Surely she realized your armor would protect you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe wasn\u2019t thinking,\u201d Royce returned. \u201cShe thought only to protect me.\u201d</p><p>He sounded baffled by his own explanation. \u201cNicholaa said something just after . . . I don\u2019t understand her meaning, Lawrence, but there is more to this than . . .\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t continue. One of the soldiers drew his attention when he offered him his cloak. Royce accepted the garment and wrapped it around Nicholaa.</p><p>He then gave the order to call his men together. It was the first time in all his days that he\u2019d retreated from a fight. He didn\u2019t hesitate though. Nicholaa was his only concern now. Nothing else mattered.</p><p>As it turned out, retreat wasn\u2019t necessary. Lawrence returned to Royce with the announcement that the attackers had fled as suddenly as they\u2019d appeared.</p><p>Royce mulled over that oddity a long while. Although the rebels had clearly had the initial advantage, Royce could have turned the fight into a victory, as his soldiers were far more skilled than the Saxons were. That much had been evident from the way the enemy had rushed toward them from the hills. They had run without a thought of flanking the Normans or protecting their own backsides. There wasn\u2019t any discipline in their ranks. They had made an easy target for the Normans\u2019 arrows.</p><p>On the long ride to Rosewood, Royce kept trying to separate his mind from his emotions, a simple undertaking under usual conditions. His heart kept getting in his way, though. He told himself again and again that when he\u2019d given the order to quit the battle, he\u2019d merely been doing his duty. Nicholaa was his wife, and it was his responsibility to protect her. But why were his hands still shaking? Why was his fury over her injury so consuming he could barely think?</p><p>Damn it all, this inconvenience was getting out of hand. His wife was muddling his mind. His life was a carefully drawn map, and now she was easing her way right into his every thought.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until they had reached the castle and Royce was carrying Nicholaa up the narrow steps to the bedchambers that he realized the full horror of his situation.</p><p>He didn\u2019t just care about her. He was falling in love with the woman.</p><p>God\u2019s truth, that admission so stunned him that he almost dropped her. He quickly recovered and continued on toward Nicholaa\u2019s chamber, his mind racing with all the reasons he couldn\u2019t possibly love such a stubborn, illogical woman. Hell, he didn\u2019t even like her most of the time.</p><p>Logic came to his rescue. It wasn\u2019t possible for him to love her. He didn\u2019t know how to love anyone. Aye, he told himself. He\u2019d been trained all these years to be a warrior, and he had never learned how to love. Therefore, he reasoned quite logically, he couldn\u2019t possibly love Nicholaa.</p><p>It was all right to care about the woman, of course, for she was his possession. He could care as an owner would care about any valuable property.</p><p>Royce felt better after he\u2019d sorted it all out. Yet he contradicted his new convictions by growling at all the servants who presumed they would take over Nicholaa\u2019s care. Baron Hugh had followed the parade of weeping women up the stairs. He stood in the doorway, watching with growing astonishment as Royce tried to put Nicholaa on the bed. The giant warrior couldn\u2019t seem to get the deed done. He leaned over the bed twice, but each time he straightened up, Nicholaa was still in his arms. Royce couldn\u2019t seem to let go of her.</p><p>Hugh took mercy on his friend. He ushered the servants out of the room, save for one, a sweet, plump temptress named Clarise whom he\u2019d been trying to get into his bed for nearly a week now. He motioned for her to stand aside, then ordered Royce to put his wife down. His hand rested on Royce\u2019s shoulder. \u201cTake your helmet off and see to your own comforts. Clarise will take care of Nicholaa.\u201d</p><p>Royce did put Nicholaa down and take his helmet off, but he refused to leave the room. He tossed the headgear into a corner, then clasped his hands behind his back and stood guard beside the bed. He saw Nicholaa jump when the helmet hit the floor. Could she hear them? he wondered. Perhaps she was finally coming out of her swoon. God, he hoped so.</p><p>Nicholaa knew exactly what was going on. She\u2019d alternated between true sleep and pretending to be asleep all the way home. The pain in her shoulder had eased considerably, and she was feeling much better now. The problem was that she\u2019d have to explain her actions to her husband once he knew she\u2019d recovered, and she still didn\u2019t know what she was going to tell him.</p><p>She needed time to worry through this problem. She was still a bit stunned that Thurston was alive\u2014thankful too, of course. As his only sister, she felt it was her duty to protect him. But she was also Royce\u2019s wife now. She had to give her loyalty to him and try to protect him as well. God, it was confusing.</p><p>Nicholaa started shivering. She was frightened for Thurston and for Royce. She knew her brother\u2019s stubborn nature. He wouldn\u2019t give up until he\u2019d regained his holding, but Royce wouldn\u2019t let Thurston have Rosewood without a fight, either. One or both could die before the matter was settled.</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to lose either of them. What was she going to do? Should she trust Royce with the truth? Or would that be disloyal to Thurston?</p><p>Tears filled her eyes. She needed time to sort it all out before doing anything.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s in pain,\u201d Royce muttered, drawing her attention. \u201cI want it stopped. Now.\u201d</p><p>Nicholaa didn\u2019t open her eyes. She wished Royce would take her into his arms and offer her the comfort she so desperately needed right now. She wanted him to tell her everything would be all right.</p><p>God help her, she actually wanted him to love her, if only just a little.</p><p>\u201cWe could send someone to the abbey for a healer,\u201d Hugh suggested.</p><p>Clarise had just finished sorting through the trunk, looking for Nicholaa\u2019s sleeping gowns. She carried a white cotton garment over to the bed. When Nicholaa moaned, Clarise burst into tears. She dropped the gown and began to twist the hem of her bliaut into a knot. \u201cLady Nicholaa cannot die,\u201d she cried out. \u201cWe would be lost without her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop that sinful talk,\u201d Hugh commanded. \u201cShe isn\u2019t going to die. She just lost a bit of blood, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>Clarise nodded, then picked up her mistress\u2019s gown.</p><p>Hugh stood by Royce\u2019s side, staring down at Nicholaa. He rubbed his beard as he asked. \u201cWas it an arrow that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe threw herself in front of me to save me from taking that arrow,\u201d Royce interrupted.</p><p>\u201cRoyce she\u2019s going to be all right,\u201d Hugh said again. \u201cAre you in the mood to tell me why she\u2019s here? I thought she was going to be given to some worthy knight as wife. Did the king change his mind?\u201d</p><p>Royce shook his head. \u201cShe\u2019s my wife.\u201d</p><p>Hugh raised an eyebrow and smiled. \u201cSo you challenged for her after all. I guessed you would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t challenge for her,\u201d Royce countered. He found his first smile when he explained. \u201cYou might say Nicholaa challenged for me.\u201d</p><p>Hugh let out a snort of laughter. \u201cThere\u2019s more to this tale than you\u2019re telling me. I\u2019ll demand the rest at supper. Now turn your mind back to this sorry matter, and explain to me why your wife would throw herself in front of you. You were wearing armor, weren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have my answers when Nicholaa wakes up.\u201d</p><p>Nicholaa had heard every word of the exchange. She grimaced over the harshness in her husband\u2019s voice. She decided then and there she just might have to pretend to be asleep for another week or two, or until she could decide what to do about Thurston. She wouldn\u2019t lie to Royce, though. Her word was as important to her as her loyalty. She\u2019d given her husband her promise, and she wouldn\u2019t break it.</p><p>\u201cI pray to God Lady Nicholaa knows where she is when she wakes up.\u201d</p><p>Clarise\u2019s remark gained both warriors\u2019 attention. \u201cWhat are you rambling on about?\u201d Hugh asked. \u201cOf course she\u2019ll remember where she is.\u201d</p><p>Clarise shook her head. \u201cThere\u2019s those who don\u2019t remember a thing after they\u2019ve been hit on the head or lost their blood. Some get confused. Others get forgetful. It\u2019s the truth I\u2019m giving you,\u201d she added on a sob. \u201cMy lady might not even recognize me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never heard of such an affliction,\u201d Hugh scoffed.</p><p>Royce hadn\u2019t taken his gaze away from his wife during the conversation, so he alone noticed that the grimace eased from her expression and she suddenly looked quite peaceful.</p><p>Was she listening to their conversation? \u201cNicholaa, open your eyes,\u201d he commanded.</p><p>She didn\u2019t obey him. She groaned instead. It was a dramatic sound, not the least bit convincing. What was her game? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He couldn\u2019t contain his sudden smile. She was going to be all right. Relief swelled through him. \u201cYou will answer my questions when you wake up, Nicholaa.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t respond. \u201cShe\u2019s still in a swoon, milord,\u201d Clarise whispered. \u201cShe\u2019s all tuckered out.\u201d</p><p>Royce let out a long sigh. And then he waited.</p><p>Several minutes passed. Clarise left to collect supplies to change Nicholaa\u2019s bandage. Hugh saw to starting a fire in the hearth. Royce didn\u2019t move from his position by the side of the bed.</p> <p>She finally opened her eyes. Her gaze slowly turned to look up at Royce. Her eyes were clear, not cloudy. Her frown, he decided, was forced.</p><p>He guessed her plan before she put it into action.</p><p>\u201cWhere am I?\u201d Nicholaa looked around the chamber before giving Royce her attention again.</p><p>He sat down on the side of the bed. \u201cYou\u2019re in your chamber,\u201d he answered. \u201cYou\u2019ve been asleep a long while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have?\u201d</p> <p>He nodded.</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><p>He hid his exasperation. He\u2019d been right: Nicholaa had heard Clarise\u2019s remarks. He braced his hands on either side of her head and slowly leaned down. \u201cI\u2019m your husband, Nicholaa,\u201d he whispered, \u201cthe man you love above all others.\u201d</p><p>That announcement caused just the reaction he wanted. She looked astonished. He wanted more. \u201cYou don\u2019t remember?\u201d he whispered.</p><p>She shrugged. He smiled. \u201cI\u2019m the man you begged on bended knee to marry you. Surely you remember how you pleaded\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t beg you to marry me, you insolent\u2014\u201d</p> <p>He silenced her with a long kiss. When he pulled back, she frowned up at him. He couldn\u2019t have been more pleased. In his mind, his wife was already on the road to recovery.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to have to explain your actions to me, Nicholaa.\u201d</p><p>She stared up at him a long while. \u201cI know,\u201d she finally said on a long sigh. \u201cI would ask that you wait until I\u2019m feeling better, Royce. All right?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cYou\u2019re also going to give me your word that you will never, ever take such a foolish risk again. You are completely without self-discipline, Nicholaa.\u201d</p><p>She was highly insulted. Royce stood up and walked toward the door. \u201cI\u2019ll wait until tomorrow to hear both your confession and your apology, wife. You have my permission to rest now.\u201d</p><p>She bolted up in the bed. The action jarred her shoulder into stinging. \u201cI was trying to save your hide, you ungrateful man.\u201d</p><p>Royce didn\u2019t pause in his stride. \u201cAye, you were,\u201d he acknowledged. \u201cBut there was more to your actions than you\u2019re telling, wasn\u2019t there?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t answer him. The spurt of anger had worn her out. She collapsed against the bed again. She was muttering her opinions of her husband when she noticed Baron Hugh standing by the hearth. Nicholaa was horrified the older knight had seen her act so undignified. \u201cI don\u2019t usually raise my voice to anyone,\u201d she announced. \u201cBut that man does bring out my temper, Baron.\u201d</p> <p>Hugh smiled. \u201cDo you usually call your husband a son of a boar?\u201d</p><p>So he\u2019d heard her muttering. Nicholaa let out a sigh. \u201cOnly when I believe no one can overhear me,\u201d she confessed.</p><p>He walked over to stand next to the bed. \u201cAre you rested enough to tell me what happened to you, Nicholaa? I\u2019m intrigued by the bandages on your hands.\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cIt has been a most difficult week, Baron.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo it would seem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was perfectly sound until I met Royce.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you believe these injuries are all his fault?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot directly,\u201d she hedged.</p><p>From the expectant look on his face, Nicholaa knew he wanted the details, but she wasn\u2019t up to giving them to him. Let Royce explain. \u201cIt\u2019s a long story, sir,\u201d she whispered. \u201cA pitiful one, too. Suffice it to say that that man is responsible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRoyce.\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes and let out another sigh. Hugh assumed she wanted to rest. He turned to leave.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why I bothered to save his life,\u201d she muttered. \u201cDid he express his gratitude?\u201d</p><p>Hugh paused in his stride. He was about to respond to her question when she answered it. \u201cNo, Baron, he did not. He wasn\u2019t pleased with my courageous act, either. Nay, he was furious with me. He\u2019s insufferable. You may tell him I said that, too, my lord.\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes again. Hugh tried to leave the chamber a second time. He was waylaid in the doorway by a request to give Royce a few more of her opinions.</p><p>Fifteen minutes later Hugh was finally able to leave the chamber.</p><p>Royce met him at the bottom of the steps. \u201cI was just about to send someone to get you,\u201d he announced. \u201cNicholaa needs her rest, Hugh.\u201d</p><p>There was such disapproval in Royce\u2019s voice that Hugh laughed. \u201cI didn\u2019t wear her out, if that\u2019s your concern,\u201d he said. \u201cGod\u2019s truth, she wore me out giving me all her opinions of you. Would you like to hear a few of them?\u201d</p><p>Royce let his friend see his exasperation. \u201cI\u2019m not interested in insignificant things. Nicholaa\u2019s safe now. When she recovers, I\u2019ll explain her duties to her.\u201d</p><p>He went to the door and started outside, but Hugh stopped him. \u201cIt\u2019s all so simple to you, isn\u2019t it, Royce?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Royce called over his shoulder. He took exception to the amusement he heard in his friend\u2019s voice. \u201cI may be newly married, Hugh, but I understand that there is only one way this partnership can work to everyone\u2019s satisfaction. I will give the orders, and she will obey them. I\u2019ll be patient, of course. She deserves that consideration. Marriage is new to her, too,\u201d he added. \u201cOnce she catches on, life will go along peacefully. She only has to obey me, Hugh. It won\u2019t be difficult.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes Nicholaa understand this dictate?\u201d Hugh asked.</p><p>\u201cIn time she will,\u201d Royce vowed. His voice was as hard as stone when he added, \u201cI will have a peaceful home.\u201d</p><p>The door slammed shut on that promise.</p><p>Hugh turned to look up the stairs. He laughed again. Aye, he thought to himself, Royce would have peace. But Nicholaa would have his heart first.</p><p>Chapter Ten</p><p>She decided to be nice. After all, she\u2019d tried everything else. Nagging hadn\u2019t worked. Neither had shouting. Nicholaa was getting desperate. She reasoned that if she turned pleasant, Royce might retaliate in kind. Perhaps then he would listen to her orders.</p><p>It was high time he brought Justin and little Ulric home. A full two weeks had passed since they\u2019d returned to Rosewood. She\u2019d expected Royce to collect her family right away, but it soon became apparent he wasn\u2019t in the mood to obey her commands. He avoided doing his duty as thoroughly as he\u2019d been avoiding her. Why, in the past fourteen days, she\u2019d seen her husband only six or seven times.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t minded his inattention the first few days. She knew he was irritated that she hadn\u2019t explained her actions on the day of the attack. Still, he\u2019d agreed to wait until she was ready to tell him. At least that was the conclusion she came to when she\u2019d made her position clear and he\u2019d given her a no-nonsense nod.</p><p>Now that she thought about it, Nicholaa realized it was just after she explained her position that he had started ignoring her.</p><p>It was time to right things between them. She wanted to be a proper wife. God\u2019s truth, she hated the way he was ignoring her. He wasn\u2019t acting at all the way a husband should act around his wife, or so she believed from her extremely limited observations of marriages.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t sleeping in her chamber, either. Clarise told her he\u2019d taken over the north bedroom, which had belonged to Nicholaa\u2019s father and mother. The large bed had been built to accommodate her father\u2019s sizable bulk. The hearth was enormous as well, since the area the fire warmed was thrice the size of Nicholaa\u2019s small room.</p><p>She understood Royce\u2019s reasons for selecting the chamber, yet still thought it rude he didn\u2019t sleep with her. He was her husband, after all, and they should rest side by side. The truth stung. He could have invited her to share his bed . . . but he hadn\u2019t.</p><p>Nicholaa didn\u2019t want to go on like this any longer. She was miserable. She decided she would have to put her pride aside. Come hell or high tide, she would find a way to turn this mockery of a marriage around.</p><p>She would start by finding out why he was avoiding her. She probably wouldn\u2019t like his answer, and she knew he could be as blunt as a dull knife when he gave his opinion. Still, she was determined to ask.</p><p>She dressed with care for dinner, bathing and washing her hair with sweet-scented soap. Clarise assisted her. The dear woman had openly wept when the bandages were removed from Nicholaa\u2019s hands and she saw all the scars.</p><p>Nicholaa had been embarrassed. The ugly marks were much more evident on her left hand and wrist. She didn\u2019t consider herself a vain woman, but the hideous scars did worry her. Royce might be as repulsed by the marks as she was.</p><p>She decided to turn his attention from them by wearing her prettiest gown. The color was pleasing to look upon, or so she hoped. Both garments were the palest of blue. The fit was snug, but not overly so.</p><p>Yet maybe the gold would be a better choice. Nicholaa worried over that possibility until Clarise came back into the chamber. She then put the question to the servant. \u201cDo you think my husband would prefer the gold or the blue?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI favor the blue, milady, but I don\u2019t know your husband\u2019s preferences.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know them, either,\u201d Nicholaa admitted. \u201cNow that I think about it, I don\u2019t know any of Royce\u2019s preferences.\u201d</p><p>Clarise smiled at the irritation in her mistress\u2019s voice. When she picked up the brush, Nicholaa sat down on the stool. The servant brushed her hair until it crackled. Twice she began to fashion a braid, and twice her mistress changed her mind.</p><p>Clarise had never known Nicholaa to be so indecisive or so concerned about her appearance. \u201cWhat\u2019s got you so riled, milady?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not riled. I just want to look pretty tonight.\u201d</p><p>Clarise smiled. \u201cAre you wanting to look pretty for anyone in particular?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy husband,\u201d Nicholaa answered. \u201cI\u2019m determined to get his attention tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, that\u2019s telling.\u201d</p><p>Nicholaa was thankful the servant couldn\u2019t see her face. She could feel herself blushing. \u201cI\u2019ve come up with a sound plan.\u201d</p><p>Clarise chuckled. \u201cYou\u2019ve always got a sound plan.\u201d</p><p>Nicholaa smiled over the praise in the servant\u2019s voice. \u201cIn these trying times, one must always be a step ahead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe times aren\u2019t trying any longer,\u201d Clarise said. \u201cYour husband\u2019s bringing order to the household, milady.\u201d</p><p>Nicholaa shook her head. Clarise had every right to be optimistic. She didn\u2019t know Thurston was still alive. Nicholaa hadn\u2019t told anyone that secret. She couldn\u2019t even think about her brother without a tightness settling inside her chest.</p><p>\u201cFor some the war is over,\u201d she whispered. \u201cFor others it has only just begun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat nonsense is this, milady?\u201d Clarise asked. \u201cYou aren\u2019t talking about your marriage, are you, now? You aren\u2019t at war with your husband. You\u2019re just being a bit stubborn, if you\u2019re wanting my opinion.\u201d</p><p>Nicholaa didn\u2019t respond to the servant\u2019s opinions. Clarise turned her attention when she said, \u201cTell me about this plan of yours, milady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to be very pleasant tonight at dinner,\u201d Nicholaa answered. \u201cRoyce isn\u2019t going to rile my temper, no matter what horrible things he says to me. I hope that when he notices how accommodating I\u2019m being, he\u2019ll reciprocate in like measure. Then perhaps he\u2019ll listen to reason and go fetch my family for me.\u201d</p><p>Clarise couldn\u2019t hide her disappointment. When Nicholaa stood up and reached for her braided belt, she caught the servant\u2019s frown. \u201cYou don\u2019t think my plan is sound?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s sound all right,\u201d she agreed. \u201cI\u2019m just disappointed, milady. I hoped you were getting all prettied up for quite another reason.\u201d</p><p>Nicholaa adjusted the belt just so on her hips, then slipped her small meat dagger into one of the narrow loops.</p><p>\u201cThere is more to my plan,\u201d Nicholaa said. \u201cI\u2019m not at all happy with the way my marriage is going. Royce is difficult to get along with. Surely you\u2019ve noticed how he ignores me. Why, every time I try to talk to him about Justin and Ulric, he turns and walks away. He\u2019s horribly rude. Right in the middle of my petition I suddenly find myself talking to his shadow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPetition?\u201d Clarise replied with a snort. \u201cYour husband leaves when you start ordering him around, milady. That\u2019s what I\u2019ve noticed. You haven\u2019t been yourself these past weeks, if I may say so, and you\u2019ve done more ordering and shouting than ever before.\u201d</p><p>Nicholaa knew Clarise was speaking the truth. She bowed her head in embarrassment. \u201cMy husband does prick my temper,\u201d she confessed. \u201cStill, I promise there won\u2019t be any more shouting. I realize how unladylike it is.\u201d</p><p>The servant smiled. \u201cYou won\u2019t be doing any shouting because you realize it doesn\u2019t work with your husband.\u201d</p><p>Nicholaa nodded. \u201cThat, too,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can quit frowning, Clarise. I\u2019ve decided it\u2019s time Royce and I put our differences aside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, praise God,\u201d the servant said. \u201cYou\u2019ve finally come to your senses. It isn\u2019t right to sleep apart the way you two do. Are you telling me you\u2019re going to correct this shame?\u201d</p><p>Nicholaa stared at the hearth. Lord, she was embarrassed. It was difficult for her to discuss such a personal topic. \u201cI\u2019m going to seduce him.\u201d</p><p>Clarise hooted with laughter. Nicholaa frowned at her. \u201cThis is a serious topic,\u201d she announced.</p><p>She waited for the servant to gain control of herself, then said, \u201cRoyce and I are going to have a fresh beginning. Marriage is a sacred vow, and it is my duty to give the man children.\u201d</p><p>Before Clarise could agree, Nicholaa rushed on. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter how it came to happen. Royce and I are married now. We must accept this and try to live together in harmony. I\u2019m also thinking of Ulric. The baby deserves a happy home.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to convince me, milady. I\u2019m in favor of this plan. There is one problem I would mention, though. Doesn\u2019t your husband think Ulric\u2019s your son?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Clarise let out a sigh. \u201cHe\u2019ll be noticing you lied, milady, when he beds you. You\u2019d better tell him the truth before he finds out on his own.\u201d</p><p>Nicholaa shook her head. \u201cI had good reason for telling that lie,\u201d she said. \u201cI was protecting Ulric. As long as the Normans believed he was my son, they\u2019d leave him alone.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut things have changed,\u201d Clarise argued. \u201cAnd you can\u2019t possibly believe your baron would harm the babe now.\u201d</p><p>The servant sounded outraged. Nicholaa realized then that Clarise had already given her loyalty to Royce. That pleased her, though she couldn\u2019t understand why. \u201cOnce I met Royce, I knew he wouldn\u2019t harm Ulric. Still, he might use him to get Thurston\u2019s cooperation. There is that worry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat foolishness are you talking?\u201d Clarise asked. \u201cWe both know Thurston\u2019s dead.\u201d The servant paused to make a quick sign of the cross. \u201cGod rest his soul.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if he isn\u2019t?\u201d Nicholaa asked.</p><p>\u201cYour baron still wouldn\u2019t use the babe against him. I believe that with all my heart.\u201d</p> <p>Nicholaa let out a sigh. She turned the topic just a little then. \u201cI know that a marriage based on deceit is doomed. I\u2019ve already given Royce my promise never to lie to him again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re going to tell him\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to get him sotted first,\u201d Nicholaa announced. \u201cThen I\u2019m going to tell him everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you lost your mind, milady?\u201d</p><p>Nicholaa laughed. The astonished look on Clarise\u2019s face was amusing. \u201cI know what I\u2019m doing,\u201d Nicholaa said. \u201cAlice told me that when a man has had too much ale, he doesn\u2019t remember much of what he\u2019s been told. I\u2019ll confess my lie about Ulric and tell Royce another secret I\u2019ve been worrying over, but if Royce is muddleheaded, he\u2019ll remember only bits of what I\u2019ve told him come morning.\u201d</p><p>Clarise thought that had to be the most daft plan she\u2019d ever heard. \u201cYou\u2019d better have another plan in mind if this one doesn\u2019t take,\u201d she advised. \u201cAlice is a twit, giving you such ignorant advice. A drunk man usually thinks only about sleep, but if he\u2019s set to dally, he won\u2019t be considerate, especially if he thinks you\u2019re experienced.\u201d</p> <p>Nicholaa shook her head. \u201cRoyce would never hurt me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe might not want to, but . . .\u201d</p><p>Clarise stopped trying to explain when her mistress walked out of the chamber. She chased down the corridor after Nicholaa. \u201cMilady, you\u2019ve come up with a poor plan this time. You\u2019ll have to take my word on this, for I\u2019ve had quite a bit of experience, God forgive me, and you haven\u2019t had any experience at all. I\u2019ve seen the way the baron watches you when you aren\u2019t noticing. He\u2019s wanting you something fierce, and unless you explain . . .\u201d</p><p>They reached the entrance to the great hall. Nicholaa give Clarise an affectionate hug. \u201cIt will be all right,\u201d she whispered. \u201cDon\u2019t fret so, Clarise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDear Lord, put your pride aside, Nicholaa, and simply confess your lies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPride has nothing to do with this,\u201d Nicholaa countered.</p><p>Clarise shook her head. \u201cNay, milady. Pride has everything to do with this plan of yours.\u201d</p><p>When her mistress shook her head again, the servant gave up. She moved to the shadows and stood there wringing her hands and wishing with all her heart it was Alice\u2019s neck she had between her fingers.</p> <p>Nicholaa forced a smile and slowly walked toward her husband.</p><p>He did look handsome tonight. He was dressed all in black, but the severe color made him look quite invincible to her. He was standing in front of the hearth beside Hugh, and the two men were in deep discussion. Nicholaa was pleased to see that Hugh hadn\u2019t yet left for London. He\u2019d told her he would gather his men for the journey soon now. She was going to miss him, for he knew how to be pleasant. He played a fair game of chess, too. He wasn\u2019t any match for her, of course, and she always beat him quickly, but he was the only man who actually forced her to concentrate on the game. When she\u2019d told him that one evening the previous week, Hugh had laughed until tears filled his eyes. She thought that was a strange reaction to her compliment, but she didn\u2019t tell him so for fear she\u2019d hurt his feelings.</p><p>Royce didn\u2019t come into the hall often enough to challenge anyone to a game, but Nicholaa didn\u2019t want to play chess with her husband anyway. She knew she wouldn\u2019t be able to concentrate. Perhaps in another year or two, when she\u2019d gotten used to his nearness and his handsome looks, she\u2019d be able to think about the game. Then she would play him. She\u2019d beat him, too. That thought made her smile.</p><p>Hugh noticed her standing there. He looked startled for a second or two, then bowed low and called out a greeting.</p><p>Royce simply stared at his wife and then motioned for her to come to him.</p><p>She gritted her teeth against the rudeness even as she obeyed the arrogant command. She stopped a foot away from the men and was in the middle of a curtsy when she realized Royce could see the scars on her hands. She straightened and hid her hands behind her back.</p><p>Hugh told her how lovely she looked. Royce didn\u2019t say anything. Nicholaa wouldn\u2019t let him sour her mood, though. She stood there, determined to remain patient and sweet-tempered until they finished their conversation.</p><p>\u201cDo go on with your discussion,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to interrupt.\u201d</p><p>Hugh turned back to Royce and said, \u201cWill you tear down the wall first or the castle?\u201d</p><p>Nicholaa let out a low gasp. \u201cYou think to tear down my home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Her relief was visible. Then Royce explained. \u201cI\u2019m going to reinforce my home with wood and stone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I want to.\u201d</p><p>It took all she had to smile. \u201cThank you for explaining.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d</p><p>There was a definite glint in his eyes. She noticed that right away. She didn\u2019t understand why he was amused. \u201cI wasn\u2019t questioning you, Royce,\u201d she said. She bowed her head so she would look submissive. \u201cI was only interested in your plans. What you do with this holding is no concern of mine.\u201d</p><p>She looked up in time to catch his smile. She took heart then. Being pleasant was far easier than she\u2019d realized.</p><p>What was her game now? Royce wondered. He had never seen her act so agreeable. The last two weeks had been an ordeal . . . an invigorating ordeal, he qualified. There had been moments when he\u2019d felt as though he was standing in the middle of a whirlwind. It hadn\u2019t been at all peaceful, and yet he was honest enough to admit that he enjoyed her clever attempts to outwit him.</p><p>Now she was acting submissive. It was probably killing her. Royce continued to smile as he said, \u201cThen it wouldn\u2019t matter to you if I tore this building down and built another one?\u201d</p><p>Since he\u2019d only just announced his intention to reinforce the wood with stone, she felt safe lying. \u201cNo, it wouldn\u2019t matter at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m thoroughly confused,\u201d Hugh interjected. \u201cI thought that was your plan all along.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was,\u201d Royce said. \u201cBut then I decided that my plan might prove unsettling to my wife. She was raised here, Hugh, and I thought she might have strong feelings about having her home torn down. Now, however, I shall\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do have strong feelings,\u201d she blurted out.</p><p>\u201cBut you just said\u2014\u201d</p><p>She forgot to be nice. \u201cYou aren\u2019t going to tear my home down, Royce.\u201d</p><p>He raised an eyebrow.</p><p>She let out a sigh. She hadn\u2019t meant to shout at her husband. \u201cI hope you will leave the building alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you were lying when you said\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was trying to get along,\u201d she interrupted. \u201cGod\u2019s truth, that\u2019s almost impossible with you. Could we not eat our supper now and put this matter aside?\u201d</p><p>Hugh was in wholehearted agreement. He hurried over to the table, bellowing for Clarise to bring on the food.</p><p>Nicholaa turned to follow Hugh. Royce held her by her arm and forced her to stand still. \u201cYou will speak the truth at all times,\u201d he ordered.</p><p>She turned to look up at him. \u201cI am trying,\u201d she said. \u201cI would like to please you.\u201d</p><p>That admission stunned him. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I please you,\u201d she answered, \u201cperhaps you\u2019ll begin to please me.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cAnd how am I to please you?\u201d he asked. He slowly pulled her closer to him.</p><p>\u201cIf you would bring Justin and Ulric home, that would please me,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll do that,\u201d he answered. His hand cupped her chin. \u201cJust as soon as you explain your actions on the day we were attacked by the Saxons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you still wish me to apologize for interfering?\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>She stretched up and kissed him. It was a gentle, undemanding touch. \u201cI will give you your explanation tonight, Royce. When you\u2019ve heard it, I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll want me to apologize. I haven\u2019t done anything wrong, and once I\u2019ve explained, I\u2019m certain you\u2019ll agree. You might even have to apologize to me. You do know how, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>She was smiling up at him so sweetly, looking so damn innocent too. It was difficult to believe she was the hellion he\u2019d been living with these two past weeks.</p><p>\u201cNicholaa?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Royce?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could drive a man to drink.\u201d</p><p>Dear God, she hoped so. His insult thrilled her. She almost laughed out loud.</p><p>The dimple was back in her cheek when she smiled at him. The temptation was becoming too much to resist. Royce had been determined to ignore her until she realized her demands weren\u2019t going to get her anywhere. Aye, she needed to understand her position in his household.</p><p>The stakes were too high for Royce to back down. He wanted Nicholaa\u2019s complete loyalty and honesty, and by God, he would have both before he touched her. Hell, he was the only one suffering in this marriage. Royce had recognized that truth quickly enough. Nicholaa was too innocent to understand the torment she was putting him through. She didn\u2019t have the faintest idea of her own appeal, either. The woman was so feminine. When she smiled up at him, all he could think about was touching her. She didn\u2019t understand the joy and fulfillment they could give each other in bed, and at the rate they were going, she\u2019d be an old woman before she found out.</p><p>Perhaps he should change tactics. That thought popped into his mind even as he was reaching for her. He threaded his fingers through her hair to keep her captive as he slowly leaned down to her mouth. He intended to take one quick taste, but his wife went all soft and willing on him, and he couldn\u2019t stop himself from deepening the kiss. His tongue swept inside her mouth to rub against hers. The taste of her was intoxicating. It made him hungry for more.</p><p>He growled low in his throat when Nicholaa wrapped her arms around his waist and held him tight against her. The kiss turned hot, ravenous. His mouth slanted over hers again and again until he was shaking with his need for more.</p><p>It was time to stop. This was neither the time nor the place for such uninhibited behavior. Royce gently pulled back. She followed him. He was so pleased with that reaction he had to kiss her again.</p><p>Nicholaa was trembling when he finally forced himself to end their love play. She went limp against him. He held her close until they\u2019d both regained their composure, then forced her chin up so he could see her eyes. He whispered the obvious: \u201cI want you, Nicholaa.\u201d</p><p>The harshness in his whisper didn\u2019t frighten her. Nay, she was warmed by his confession. \u201cI\u2019m pleased you want me, Royce. I want you, too. It should be that way, shouldn\u2019t it, between husband and wife?\u201d</p><p>He brushed her cheek with the back of his hand. \u201cYes, it should be that way, though in truth it is a rarity.\u201d</p><p>Nicholaa didn\u2019t know what to say next. She couldn\u2019t stop looking at him. He didn\u2019t want to stop staring at her. They stayed that way for what seemed an eternity. The spell was broken when Clarise\u2019s laughter reached them. Royce was the first to move. He grabbed Nicholaa\u2019s hand and led her to the table.</p><p>She shook her head in exasperation when she saw that Baron Hugh had Clarise pinned up against the far wall. The big Norman was diligently nibbling on her ear, and Clarise was thoroughly enjoying his attention until she realized her mistress was watching her. The servant quickly disengaged herself from Hugh\u2019s hold and scurried into the buttery. Hugh let out a loud sigh of regret. \u201cShe\u2019s leading me a merry chase,\u201d he muttered as he took his place.</p><p>Royce sat at the head of the table. Nicholaa took her place to his right. Hugh settled himself across from her.</p><p>Alice waited at the entrance to the buttery for her mistress to give the signal. The servant had already set the table with three silver goblets. As soon as Nicholaa motioned to her, Alice rushed over with a fat jug and filled each goblet with dark ale. She filled Royce\u2019s goblet to the rim. He didn\u2019t reprove her because he thought she was simply eager to please him.</p><p>Nicholaa immediately lifted her goblet and suggested a toast. She kept her hand turned away from Royce so he wouldn\u2019t notice the scars. She took a long drink, too, because she didn\u2019t want her husband to become suspicious.</p><p>She didn\u2019t stop after just one toast, either. No, she offered another and another until she\u2019d given a salutation to everyone in England except the stable master. She was about to toast him, too, when bread trenchers filled with quail and pheasant were placed on the table. Thick loaves of freshly baked black bread and wide wedges of yellow cheese came next. Additional salt had been added to the meat to increase Royce\u2019s thirst. Nicholaa forgot about the added salt, though. Her head was muddled from all the ale she\u2019d already swallowed. She ate a good portion of her supper, drinking heartily after each bite.</p><p>It didn\u2019t take Royce long to realize Nicholaa was up to something. Each time he took a drink, Alice was there to refill his goblet. He suspected that the two women were in league together. They kept giving each other knowing looks.</p><p>His wife wanted to get him drunk, but he was aware of her plan. Each time his goblet was refilled, he poured half of the ale into Nicholaa\u2019s cup. She couldn\u2019t refuse his generosity, and after a while she was too confused to notice. Within an hour, Nicholaa\u2019s eyelids were drooping and she was having extreme difficulty staying on her stool. Her elbow rested on the table, her head propped up in her hand. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI believe this is the worst supper I\u2019ve ever tried to eat,\u201d Hugh announced. \u201cIt\u2019s more salt than meat, Royce.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, it is,\u201d Royce agreed.</p><p>Hugh stood up. \u201cI\u2019m weary this evening. I\u2019m taking to my bed. Now where did sweet Clarise wander off to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s hiding in the buttery,\u201d Nicholaa blurted out. She then apologized for the supper and bade Hugh a good night. She didn\u2019t realize how slurred her words were or how disheveled she looked. Her hair had fallen forward and hid half her face. She was fully occupied trying to keep her head from slipping off her hand.</p> <p>Royce was exasperated with her. He waited until Hugh had left the hall, then motioned for Alice to leave and turned his attention to his wife. Just as he was about to demand that she explain her actions, she shifted and almost fell off her stool. Royce caught her before she hit the floor, then leaned back and pulled her onto his lap.</p><p>The room was spinning around Nicholaa. She reached up to put her arms around his neck, then changed her mind. She awkwardly tried to hide her hands in the folds of her gown.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d he asked when she continued to pull at her gown.</p><p>\u201cHiding my hands from you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to see my scars. They\u2019re ugly,\u201d she announced. She pressed her cheek against his shoulder. \u201cYou smell nice, Royce. Like the outdoors.\u201d</p><p>Royce ignored the compliment and reached around her to take hold of her hands. He forced her to open her fists, then looked at the marks. He thought her skin must still feel tender, because the palms were bright red.</p><p>When he didn\u2019t immediately tell her what he was thinking, she whispered, \u201cThey\u2019re ugly, aren\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>She leaned away from him so she could see if he was teasing her or telling her the truth.</p><p>Royce almost laughed when he saw her disgruntled expression. A lock of hair hung over her left eye, and she looked half asleep.</p> <p>\u201cYou have to tell me the truth,\u201d she announced. \u201cThey\u2019re ugly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, they aren\u2019t ugly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey aren\u2019t pretty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what are they?\u201d</p><p>His smile was filled with tenderness. \u201cThey\u2019re just scars, Nicholaa.\u201d</p><p>She was appeased. He kissed the frown away from her brow.</p><p>She smiled with pleasure. \u201cI\u2019m no longer perfect,\u201d she said in a cheerful voice that made him want to laugh again. \u201cWhat say you to that?\u201d She didn\u2019t give him time to answer. \u201cDo hold still, Royce. You make the room spin when you move like that.\u201d</p> <p>Since he hadn\u2019t moved at all, he didn\u2019t know how to correct that problem for her. He was still looking at her hands when he noticed the hard calluses on two of her fingers.</p><p>\u201cWhere did you get these calluses?\u201d he asked.</p><p>The top of her head bumped his chin when she turned to examine her left hand. \u201cWhat calluses?\u201d she asked.</p><p>She was nearly doubled over in her bid to see her hands. It obviously hadn\u2019t occurred to her that she could have lifted her arm.</p><p>He controlled his exasperation. \u201cThe calluses on your other hand, Nicholaa.\u201d</p><p>He lifted her right hand. She frowned as she stared at her fingers, then smiled. \u201cOh, those calluses. They\u2019re from the loops, of course. Where else could I have gotten them?\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d lost him with that explanation. \u201cWhat loops?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe ones my two fingers fit through.\u201d</p><p>He closed his eyes and prayed for patience. \u201cBut what do the loops belong to, Nicholaa?\u201d he prodded again.</p><p>\u201cMy sling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour what?\u201d</p><p>She cuddled up against his chest, wondering why he\u2019d gone all tense on her. Then she remembered how she\u2019d felled him with a stone. Since she\u2019d decided to be completely honest with him, she guessed she\u2019d have to confess this transgression.</p><p>\u201cI hit you with a stone from my sling, but I already admitted that to you. I wasn\u2019t at all sorry, either. I could have killed you if that had been my intent.\u201d</p><p>She paused to yawn noisily, then added, \u201cThurston taught me how to use a sling. Did you know that?\u201d</p><p>He was too busy reacting to her confession to answer her. She\u2019d tried to tell him before, he remembered, but he hadn\u2019t believed her. He did now.</p><p>\u201cLord, I\u2019m sleepy,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Royce let out a sigh. He decided to put the matter of the sling aside for now and get to the heart of the matter before his wife passed into a drunken slumber. From the look of her, that wouldn\u2019t be long in coming.</p><p>\u201cDid you want to get me drunk?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I could seduce you.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t be more specific than that, he decided. \u201cYou thought you needed to get me drunk in order to seduce me?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. The top of her head bumped his chin again. She rubbed the ache away. \u201cYou are sotted, aren\u2019t you? You drank at least twelve goblets of ale. I counted.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d miscalculated by at least eight cups, unless she\u2019d kept count of her own consumption by mistake. \u201cHave you ever been drunk, Nicholaa?\u201d</p><p>Her gasp nearly knocked her off his lap. \u201cGood heavens no. That wouldn\u2019t be ladylike, Royce. Only common wenches get drunk. Besides, I really don\u2019t like the taste of ale very much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could have fooled me,\u201d he drawled.</p><p>She smiled. \u201cYes, I did fool you,\u201d she agreed. \u201cI got you good and sotted, and you didn\u2019t even notice. Wasn\u2019t that clever of me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou still haven\u2019t explained why,\u201d he reminded her.</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re very handsome, Royce, but you already know that.\u201d</p><p>That explanation didn\u2019t make any sense. He wasn\u2019t irritated, though. Nay, he was astonished. \u201cYou think I\u2019m handsome?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d she answered. \u201cI have this plan, you see, and you\u2019re following it quite nicely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what is this plan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow that you\u2019re sotted, I\u2019m going to confess my lies to you. You\u2019re too drunk to be upset. Then I\u2019m going to seduce you. Do you see how easy it is, husband?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he answered. \u201cTell me why it\u2019s easy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the morning you aren\u2019t going to remember what I told you.\u201d</p><p>The woman was as daft as a donkey. \u201cWhat if I do remember?\u201d</p><p>She frowned over that question a long while before answering. \u201cThen you\u2019ll have bedded me and only half remember. Alice says so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor the love of God, Nicholaa\u2014\u201d</p><p>She poked him in the shoulder. \u201cIt\u2019s a sound plan, Royce.\u201d</p><p>He rolled his eyes heavenward. The plan belonged to a half-wit. \u201cWhy go to all this trouble, wife?\u201d he asked then. \u201cCouldn\u2019t you have just explained?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy must you complicate everything?\u201d she asked. \u201cThis is my plan, not yours. We have to do it my way. You\u2019re confusing me with all your questions.\u201d</p><p>She was getting all worked up. Her eyes filled with tears, and she looked as if she might break into a fit of weeping.</p><p>He tried to soothe her. \u201cAll right,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll do it your way. Let\u2019s begin with the lies, shall we? Then we can move on to my seduction.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my seduction, not yours.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t argue with her. \u201cI assume there is more than one lie. Is that correct?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich one would you like to tell me about first?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe big one.\u201d</p><p>When she didn\u2019t continue, he prodded her. \u201cI\u2019m waiting, Nicholaa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not Ulric\u2019s mama.\u201d</p><p>She tensed in anticipation of his reaction. Royce didn\u2019t say anything. She leaned away from him to see if he was frowning. He wasn\u2019t. She took heart. \u201cI\u2019ve never even been married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNo, you don\u2019t see,\u201d she whispered. \u201cYou think I\u2019m experienced, but the truth is just the opposite.\u201d</p><p>He still didn\u2019t react. She didn\u2019t know what to make of that. Perhaps he didn\u2019t understand. \u201cRoyce, this is going to upset you, and I\u2019m sorry for that, but I\u2019m really still . . .\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t get the word out. He took mercy on her. \u201cYou\u2019re still a virgin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you believed I would be upset by this news?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou needn\u2019t smile at me, Royce. I had to tell you before I seduced you. You were bound . . .\u201d She stopped in mid-sentence to frown up at him. \u201cYou would have noticed, wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I would have noticed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere, do you see?\u201d she asked. She leaned farther back and would have kept right on going if Royce hadn\u2019t tightened his hold around her waist.</p><p>\u201cTomorrow you won\u2019t remember any of this discussion. You can\u2019t know little Ulric belongs to my brother. It wouldn\u2019t be safe for the baby, especially when you find out Thurston\u2019s still alive.\u201d</p><p>She started getting misty-eyed again. Royce pulled her close. \u201cNicholaa, I know you\u2019re having a little trouble concentrating now, but I want you to try to understand what I\u2019m going to say to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re afraid of me, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps just a little.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to be even a little afraid,\u201d he whispered. He squeezed her to emphasize that statement, then continued. \u201cDo you know, you have a much stronger temper than I do.\u201d</p><p>She thought about that remark for a long minute, then nodded. \u201cThank you, husband.\u201d</p><p>He held his exasperation. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a compliment, just an observation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI admit I do raise my voice every now and again,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re turning the topic, Nicholaa. I want to talk about this unreasonable fear you have of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t unreasonable,\u201d she muttered. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not overly afraid. I\u2019m just a cautious sort, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCaution is all good and well, wife, but you needn\u2019t be cautious around me. No matter how often you provoke me, I\u2019ll never hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou hurt my feelings when you ignore me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s different.\u201d</p><p>She let out a sigh. \u201cI don\u2019t see how.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me what happened the day we were attacked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI interfered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you interfered. I want to know why.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t tell you,\u201d she whispered. \u201cBut I want to tell you. I don\u2019t know what to do. You\u2019re going to be furious with Thurston. Please don\u2019t hate my brother. He didn\u2019t realize he was trying to kill you. I mean to say, he probably meant to fell you, but he couldn\u2019t have known you were my husband.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNicholaa, will you try to make sense?\u201d he ordered. \u201cThurston is still alive? Is that what you\u2019re telling me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, God, how did you guess?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour brother\u2019s in league with the resisters against William.\u201d</p><p>His cunning amazed her. \u201cHow did you guess that?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>He didn\u2019t remind her that she\u2019d just told him. \u201cAnd Thurston is Ulric\u2019s father, isn\u2019t that right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she cried out. \u201cBut you won\u2019t remember whom the baby belongs to in the morning, Royce. Promise me.\u201d</p><p>He was suddenly furious with her. \u201cDo you actually believe I\u2019d hurt the baby just because his father is my enemy?\u201d</p><p>She snuggled up against his shoulder. \u201cNo, you wouldn\u2019t hurt him, but you might use him to get Thurston. My brother was leading the soldiers who attacked us, Royce. I saw him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn it all, Nicholaa, I would never use Ulric in such a way. How could you think . . .\u201d</p><p>He quit protesting when he realized he\u2019d already done just that by using the baby to force Nicholaa to leave her sanctuary. It was only logical for her to assume he\u2019d use Ulric again.</p><p>His anger evaporated. His mind was reeling with the information she\u2019d given him. \u201cNicholaa? Did you see your brother before or after you took the arrow in your shoulder?\u201d</p><p>She put her arms around his neck. Her fingers began to toy with his hair. He stopped that distraction by pulling her hands away. \u201cAnswer me,\u201d he commanded.</p><p>She let out a sigh. \u201cIt was Thurston\u2019s arrow that hit me,\u201d she said. \u201cYou were his target.\u201d</p><p>His smile was tender. \u201cThat\u2019s why you screamed, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was afraid for you,\u201d she said. She kissed his chin, then fell back against him. \u201cYou can\u2019t blame my brother. He didn\u2019t know I was there. He loves me, Royce. He would never intentionally hurt me.\u201d</p><p>It all fell into place now. Thurston must have realized what he\u2019d done after he dispatched the arrow. Nicholaa\u2019s white-blond hair must have been visible to the Saxon warrior. Royce remembered the anguished bellow that came from the crest and mingled with his own outraged roar. Aye, Thurston knew what he\u2019d done. That was the reason he\u2019d ordered the retreat.</p><p>God help Nicholaa. She\u2019d had a hell of a time since she\u2019d met him. He kissed the top of her head and then stood up, cushioning her in his arms.</p><p>\u201cDo you doubt that Thurston loves me?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t doubt his love,\u201d he answered. \u201cI do doubt his eyesight,\u201d he added in a mutter. \u201cHe damn well should have\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThurston has wonderful eyesight,\u201d she announced. \u201cI\u2019ve better, though. Do you know I can hit any target with my sling?\u201d</p><p>She reached up and touched the small jagged scar on his forehead. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly where I meant to hit you, husband.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t help noticing how cheerful she sounded. \u201cYou do not regret injuring your husband?\u201d he asked, his amusement obvious.</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t my husband then,\u201d she answered. \u201cI use arrows, too, sometimes.\u201d She kissed his chin again, then whispered, \u201cI\u2019m always accurate. The first knight your William sent to seize my holding took one of my arrows home with him.\u201d</p><p>Royce had just started carrying her up the steps. He stopped and looked down at her. She was looking thoroughly pleased with herself. \u201cYou\u2019re the one who put the arrow in Gregory\u2019s backside?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Since he wasn\u2019t going to remember much of anything in the morning, she felt it was safe to boast. \u201cJust below his backside, in his thigh. It was just a flesh wound, Royce, meant to stop him from taking my home.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI thought you said your brother\u2019s second-in-command was in charge of the defense. Are you telling me you lied about that, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, John was in charge some of the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you interfered?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJust a little.\u201d She slumped back against his shoulder. \u201cYou smell nice, Royce.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d obviously forgotten she\u2019d already said that. He continued on up the steps and walked down the long corridor past her own chamber and on to his own.</p><p>His squire, a dark-haired lad named Trevor, waited inside to assist his lord. Royce dismissed the boy with a quick motion of his head, then shut the door behind him.</p><p>A fire blazed on the hearth. The room was as warm, as inviting, as the woman cuddled up in his arms. Royce walked over to the bed and sat down with Nicholaa in his lap.</p><p>He thought she\u2019d fallen asleep until she said, \u201cHave you noticed how sweet-tempered I\u2019ve been this evening?\u201d</p> <p>Her voice was a sleepy whisper. \u201cI noticed,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cMama used to say you can catch more vermin with sweet than with sour.\u201d</p><p>That statement baffled him. \u201cWhy in God\u2019s name would you want to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant to what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCatch vermin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to catch vermin,\u201d she muttered. \u201cI want to catch you.\u201d Lord, how she wished her husband would quit tossing her about in his arms. She grabbed hold of his shoulders to steady herself. Her head was spinning, and her stomach was fighting waves of nausea.</p> <p>\u201cNicholaa?\u201d he said. \u201cAbout this plan of yours . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat plan?\u201d</p><p>He gave up. He continued to hold her until he was certain she\u2019d fallen asleep. Then he set about the task of undressing her.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t stay irritated with her. She was a master with her games of manipulation, but he understood her motives now. She was trying to hold her family together, any way she could. Aye, she was trying to survive.</p><p>It was going to take her time to learn to trust him completely, he knew, and then perhaps they would be able to settle down to a peaceful life together. He wanted her to be happy. He didn\u2019t know how he was going to achieve that goal, though, until the problem with Thurston was solved. Hell, he might have to kill the bastard. That certainly wouldn\u2019t win Nicholaa\u2019s heart.</p><p>Royce felt that he was in an impossible position. But then, so was Nicholaa. She was desperately trying to protect her brother from him and, at the same time, protect him from her brother.</p><p>There was much to consider before he formed his plans, he decided. Nicholaa wore only her chemise now, and he was about to pull the covers up over her when he changed his mind. He slowly reached for the silk ribbon that held her chemise in place. His hands shook when he touched her bare skin.</p><p>Lord, she was exquisitely formed. Her br**sts were full, her waist incredibly narrow, and the gentle flair of her h*ps couldn\u2019t have been more pleasing to him.</p> <p>He stripped off his own clothes. Then he stretched out next to his wife. If she didn\u2019t touch him, he might be able to stand the torment of having her warm body so close.</p><p>It took Royce a long while to fall asleep. All of Nicholaa\u2019s worries filtered through his mind.</p><p>And then his mind returned to the one remark she\u2019d made so matter-of-factly that he knew it was true.</p><p>She wanted to seduce him.</p><p>A man couldn\u2019t ask for more than that.</p><p>Chapter Eleven</p><p>Nicholaa awakened to the sound of a waterfall thundering in her ear. It took her a long time to realize what the noise was, and she didn\u2019t have any idea at all until she tried to move.</p><p>She felt Royce then. His arm was wrapped around her waist. They both slept on their sides. She was in front, with her backside snuggled up against his groin. The noise was her husband\u2019s snoring.</p><p>Her feet were tucked between his legs. She slowly edged away from him and was about to roll onto her stomach when he tightened his hold and pulled her back up against him.</p><p>The movement almost killed her. Her head felt as though it might split in half. She went completely still. Her stomach immediately calmed down. Her mind didn\u2019t. Dear God, what had happened last night? She couldn\u2019t remember.</p><p>She\u2019d slept with her husband. That was the only fact she was certain of. She had no idea what else had happened.</p><p>Had she gotten him sotted or had she gotten herself sotted instead? Nicholaa closed her eyes. It was too much to think about with her head pounding. Perhaps if she went back to sleep for just a little longer, she\u2019d feel refreshed enough to remember.</p><p>Royce awakened just a few minutes later. Morning light filtered through the window he\u2019d left uncovered. He lifted his head to look at his wife. Her eyes were closed. He thought she might be pretending sleep just to avoid him.</p><p>He gently nudged her. She groaned.</p><p>\u201cNicholaa?\u201d He whispered her name.</p><p>She reacted as though he\u2019d roared it. Her hand flew up to cover her ear.</p><p>\u201cAre you still sleepy?\u201d he asked. He rolled her onto her back and leaned over her.</p><p>The movement made her want to gag. She slowly opened her eyes and looked up at him. Her first thought was that he didn\u2019t look ill. Nay, he appeared fit. Happy, too. A lock of hair had fallen over his forehead, giving him a boyish look. If she\u2019d had the strength, she would have eased his hair back where it belonged. The man didn\u2019t need much sleep, she supposed. His eyes were filled with laughter, and he seemed ready to take on the world.</p><p>He thought she looked like hell. Her eyes were so bloodshot it hurt to look at them. Her complexion was greenish. The afteraffects of too much ale, he decided. His wife was going to suffer this morning.</p><p>She fell asleep again while he stared at her. He leaned down and kissed her brow, then rolled onto his side to get out of bed. The movement woke her up. She grabbed hold of the covers to keep herself from shaking.</p><p>He noticed that action. \u201cAren\u2019t you feeling well, Nicholaa?\u201d he asked.</p><p>If he didn\u2019t quit shouting, she was going to die. \u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He laughed. His wife sounded as if she were being strangled.</p><p>The man was a morning talker. She vowed to work on that flaw. Royce kept up a steady one-sided conversation while he dressed. God, he was cheerful. She wished she could put a gag in his mouth. It was a mean thought, she knew, but she didn\u2019t much care.</p><p>Royce shouted his farewell, then deliberately slammed the door. He wasn\u2019t finished with his cruelty, though. He caught Clarise at the bottom of the steps and told her to bring a trencher of food to his wife\u2019s chamber.</p><p>Ten minutes later, when Clarise presented the meal to her mistress, Nicholaa literally bolted from the bed. She made it to the chamber pot without a second to spare.</p><p>It took her all morning to regain her strength. By nooning she was feeling better. She finally got dressed in a green bliaut, but she changed when Clarise mentioned the color matched her complexion. The royal blue gown was much better, or so the servant decreed.</p><p>Her hair hurt too much to let Clarise braid it. Nicholaa gritted her teeth while the servant brushed the tangles away, then used a blue ribbon to secure it behind her neck.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to tell me what happened last night?\u201d Clarise asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what happened last night,\u201d Nicholaa whispered.</p><p>\u201cYou were stark na*ed when you got out of his bed this morn, milady. Something happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, God, I was naked, wasn\u2019t I? Clarise, I don\u2019t remember last night. What am I going to do?\u201d</p><p>The servant shrugged. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to ask him what happened, but first you need to take a nice stroll outside. The fresh air will clear your head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019ll go outside. Then maybe my head will clear and I\u2019ll remember.\u201d</p><p>Clarise nodded. \u201cMilady, you aren\u2019t feeling a little tenderness?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy head\u2019s feeling tender.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t my meaning,\u201d Clarise said. She handed Nicholaa her cloak.</p><p>\u201cWhat was your meaning?\u201d Nicholaa asked.</p><p>\u201cNever you mind,\u201d the servant countered. \u201cGet your fresh air. It will all come back to you eventually.\u201d</p><p>Nicholaa hoped the servant was right. She wanted to remember what she\u2019d told Royce. More, she wanted to remember what had taken place in the bedchamber.</p><p>The cold air did clear her thoughts. She felt much better, but she still didn\u2019t remember anything.</p><p>She intercepted her husband as he was returning to the courtyard from the lower bailey. She hurried over to him. \u201cRoyce? I would like to ask you about last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>She moved closer to him so she wouldn\u2019t be overheard, then lowered her gaze. \u201cDid you have a little too much ale?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d</p><p>He put his thumb under her chin and tilted her face up. \u201cYes, you did.\u201d</p><p>He looked serious, but not angry. \u201cI don\u2019t remember what happened,\u201d she whispered. \u201cWhat did I do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou talked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what did you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI listened.\u201d</p><p>She let him see her displeasure. \u201cPlease don\u2019t make this difficult for me. Tell me what I said. I would like to remember.\u201d</p><p>He decided to make her wait. \u201cWe will discuss this tonight,\u201d he announced. He tried to walk away from her.</p><p>She grabbed hold of his arm. \u201cPlease,\u201d she whispered. \u201cAnswer just one question now.\u201d</p><p>He turned back to her. \u201cAll right,\u201d he agreed. \u201cWhat is it you wish to know?\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t look at him when she asked her question. \u201cDid I please you last night?\u201d</p><p>The shyness in her voice, added to the blush on her cheeks, told him exactly what she was asking him. She wanted to know if she\u2019d pleased him in bed. He clasped his hands behind his back and waited for her to look up at him. When she finally did, he shook his head. \u201cNot particularly,\u201d he announced.</p><p>She looked devastated. \u201cI\u2019m sorry if I disappointed you,\u201d she whispered. \u201cIt\u2019s usually a little . . . awkward the first time, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d His voice turned hard. \u201cIt should have been easy for you.\u201d</p><p>She let out a gasp. The man was heartless. Her eyes filled with tears. \u201cI wasn\u2019t experienced, Royce,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>\u201cNo, it was obvious to me you had no experience,\u201d he countered.</p><p>\u201cAnd that displeased you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d he drawled out. \u201cNicholaa, telling me the truth should never be awkward, with or without experience.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened. Dear God, they weren\u2019t even talking about the same issue. She was acutely relieved. The feeling didn\u2019t last long. Royce smiled. She decided then that he\u2019d deliberately misled her.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t talking about telling the truth,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>He was a cruel-hearted man. She decided she was finished with the conversation and turned to leave. He grabbed her shoulders and forced her to turn around. \u201cAs I said before, wife, we will discuss this tonight.\u201d</p><p>She was still frowning at him when suddenly he pulled her into his arms and kissed her soundly. Several soldiers were strolling past, but she forgot all about her audience when Royce deepened the kiss. She was enjoying herself too much to care about anything but kissing him back.</p><p>He finally pulled away. \u201cI like the way you respond to me,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>She melted against him. \u201cThank you. I\u2019m happy I please you.\u201d</p><p>He smiled against the top of her head. \u201cTomorrow I\u2019ll go and get Justin and Ulric. Does that please you?\u201d</p><p>He had his answer when she hugged him tight.</p><p>Lawrence called out to Royce then, drawing his attention. Nicholaa immediately disengaged herself from her husband and rushed back inside. She was so excited about Justin and Ulric coming home that she could barely contain herself. There was much to do in preparation. Justin would take over her chamber, she decided, and Ulric would sleep with her and Royce.</p><p>When Royce joined her at the supper table, she explained the sleeping arrangements to him. He dampened her good mood when he shook his head. \u201cUlric will have your old chamber. Justin will sleep with the other soldiers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he\u2019s my brother,\u201d she argued. \u201cShouldn\u2019t he . . .\u201d</p><p>She gave up her argument when his hand covered hers and he started squeezing. Hugh was watching them, and Nicholaa decided her husband didn\u2019t want her to argue in front of him.</p><p>\u201cWe will discuss this later,\u201d she announced with a smile in Hugh\u2019s direction.</p><p>\u201cNo, we won\u2019t,\u201d Royce replied. \u201cThe matter is settled.\u201d</p><p>He squeezed her left hand again. She smiled sweetly up at him as she placed her right hand on top of his and gave him a good squeeze. Surprised by her boldness, he almost smiled.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m leaving for London tomorrow,\u201d Hugh announced. \u201cI\u2019m hoping for one last game of chess this evening, Nicholaa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you be upset when I beat you again?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Hugh grinned. At first she thought it was because she\u2019d teased him about being upset. Then she realized he was watching the silent tug-of-war she was having with her husband. She kept trying to pull her hand away, and Royce wasn\u2019t letting her.</p><p>\u201cI never get upset, Nicholaa,\u201d Hugh announced. \u201cIt won\u2019t matter, anyway, for I plan to win this game. I\u2019ve just been toying with you until now. Since I\u2019m leaving in the morning, I\u2019ve decided to beat you soundly. You\u2019d best prepare yourself to be upset.\u201d</p><p>She laughed at his arrogance. Royce smiled. \u201cI hate to disappoint you, Hugh,\u201d he interjected. \u201cBut Nicholaa\u2019s going to be busy after dinner. She and I are going to have a discussion. Aren\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>He squeezed both her hands to let her know he didn\u2019t want an argument. Nicholaa didn\u2019t like the look in his eyes or the set of his jaw. It was the look he always wore when he was about to lecture her.</p><p>Hugh didn\u2019t want to be denied this one last opportunity to play chess with Nicholaa. \u201cI\u2019m not above pleading,\u201d he told Royce.</p><p>Nicholaa thought the baron looked like a child whose sugar treat had just been taken away. She didn\u2019t want his last night to be a disappointment.</p><p>\u201cI could play one quick game,\u201d she told Royce. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t take me any time at all to humiliate Hugh. You could give me your lecture while we play, husband.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It sounded like a perfectly good plan to her. Royce obviously didn\u2019t agree. His frown was fierce. \u201cI\u2019m not going to lecture you,\u201d he announced. \u201cThe two of us are going to have a discussion.\u201d</p><p>She gave him a disgruntled look. She would have snorted, too, but it wouldn\u2019t have been ladylike. \u201cThe kind of discussion on the way to London where you do all the talking and I do all the listening?\u201d She didn\u2019t give him time to answer, but turned back to Hugh. \u201cSounds like a lecture to me,\u201d she said.</p><p>Hugh was trying not to laugh. Nicholaa seemed to be deliberately pricking her husband\u2019s temper. Royce didn\u2019t look happy with his wife either. He let go of her hands and leaned back, then folded his arms across his chest. His glare could have set a fire.</p><p>She had trouble holding on to her smile. She refused to back down, though. The man was going to lecture her, and she wanted him to admit it. \u201cI was only making an observation,\u201d she announced.</p> <p>His wife was totally without discipline, arguing with him in front of a guest. It didn\u2019t matter that Hugh was his good friend. The issue he wished to discuss with her was of a personal nature and came under the heading of \u201cfamily concerns.\u201d She should have more sense than to drag an outsider into their problems.</p><p>\u201cYou may play one game of chess,\u201d he said. \u201cBut only one. Do you agree, Hugh?\u201d</p><p>His friend was already rushing toward the fireplace to gather the wooden chess pieces from the mantel. The man was literally rubbing his hands together in anticipation.</p><p>Nicholaa smiled and turned back to Royce. \u201cI also agree,\u201d she said.</p><p>Royce raised an eyebrow. \u201cAgree with what?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTo play only one game.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t ask for your agreement, Nicholaa.\u201d He smiled when he said that.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cSometimes I find you most difficult to get along with, Royce.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly sometimes?\u201d</p><p>When Alice rushed over to clear the table, Nicholaa was glad for the interruption. \u201cI do hope your mood improves,\u201d she whispered to her husband. She stood up and helped Alice with the chore just to get away from her husband\u2019s frown.</p><p>As soon as the table was mopped dry, Hugh placed the board in the center and spread out the chess pieces. One of the wooden statues toppled to the floor. Nicholaa let out a little gasp. \u201cDo be careful, Hugh. My father carved those pieces. I wouldn\u2019t want anything to happen to them.\u201d</p> <p>Hugh retrieved the chess piece, checked it over, and then polished it with the sleeve of his tunic. \u201cIt\u2019s good as new, Nicholaa. Your father really carved this? Have a look, Royce. It\u2019s a piece of work, it is. Look at the detail on the helmet. Your father was clever with his hands, Nicholaa.\u201d</p><p>Royce took the statue and held it closer to the candles to get a better look. Nicholaa walked over to stand behind him, putting her hand on his shoulder and leaning forward to look at the piece with him. \u201cSee the nick in the black queen\u2019s crown? I remember how that happened. As he carved that piece, Papa was telling us an amusing story that we had all heard at least a dozen times, and when he finished the tale, he laughed so hard he cut his finger and nicked the wood just there.\u201d She leaned farther forward until she was draped over Royce\u2019s shoulder and pointed out the small flaw in the chess piece.</p><p>The pleasure in her voice warmed him. \u201cAnd did you laugh with your father even though you\u2019d heard this story countless times?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She smiled at him before answering. The sparkle in her eyes made his chest tighten. He liked seeing her so carefree, he decided. \u201cOf course we laughed. Mother said we\u2019d hurt papa\u2019s feelings if we didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo his feelings were important to your mother?\u201d</p><p>Nicholaa nodded. \u201cJust as your feelings are important to me.\u201d Her expression turned serious. \u201cWhy do you look surprised?\u201d she asked. \u201cA wife should care about her husband. It\u2019s the way of things.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t seem to stop herself. He had such an intent look on his face as he stared at her. It was as though she had spoken in a foreign language. She wanted to ease his frown. She kissed him.</p><p>He was stunned by her spontaneous action. She became embarrassed and pulled back, thinking to put some distance between them, but he wouldn\u2019t let her move away. He reached up and caught her arm.</p> <p>\u201cTell me about the rest of these pieces,\u201d he commanded in a gruff voice.</p><p>\u201cDo you really wish to know or are you just being polite?\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cI\u2019m never polite, remember? I\u2019m rude.\u201d</p><p>He was teasing her. The sparkle in his eyes indicated as much. \u201cDo you know,\u201d she said, \u201cthat you have beautiful silver chips in your eyes?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t realize she\u2019d made that comment out loud until he shook his head. Her blush intensified. She took her place across the table from Hugh. \u201cDo you notice how the white queen tilts to the left? Justin tried to improve on the base. He was only eight or nine at the time, so Papa didn\u2019t become too irritated with him. He said Justin was only trying to be helpful. Everyone in the family helped with the pieces.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what did you do?\u201d Royce asked. \u201cWhich piece bears your handiwork?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMother and I were given the assignment of painting and polishing the pieces. The whites are my work, and the blacks were done by mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful set,\u201d Hugh announced. His voice became abrupt when he added, \u201cNow put this chitchat aside, Nicholaa. On to the game.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re our guest,\u201d Nicholaa said, \u201cso you should have the first move.\u201d</p><p>Hugh nodded. \u201cPrepare yourself for defeat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m prepared,\u201d Nicholaa answered. She winked at Royce, drawing yet another surprised reaction, then said, \u201cSome my favorite memories are tied to this chess set. The pieces are all I have left of my parents. I must remember all the stories, Royce, and pass them on to our children.\u201d</p><p>Hugh pondered his first move a good five minutes and finally executed it. Nicholaa barely glanced down at the board before moving her pawn forward.</p><p>\u201cTraditions are very important to you, aren\u2019t they, Nicholaa?\u201d Royce asked.</p><p>Hugh drummed his fingertips on the table while he considered his next action. He was scowling in concentration. Nicholaa whispered her answer so she wouldn\u2019t disturb Hugh. \u201cYes, traditions are important to me. Are they important to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe tradition of telling the truth at all times is very important to me.\u201d</p><p>She gave him a disgruntled look, then saw that Hugh had made another move. She immediately countered.</p><p>\u201cBut are other traditions important to you?\u201d she prodded Royce.</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI hadn\u2019t thought about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis game\u2019s important to me,\u201d Hugh grumbled. \u201cCease this banter, woman. You need to think about what you\u2019re doing.\u201d</p><p>Both players made three more moves apiece before Nicholaa turned back to Royce. He\u2019d been watching the game, and she had noticed that each time she executed a move, he smiled. She wondered what he was thinking.</p><p>\u201cThey should be important to you,\u201d she blurted out.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTraditions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Royce asked. He leaned closer to the table to observe the game.</p><p>\u201cBecause they\u2019re important to me. Check, Hugh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt can\u2019t be check yet.\u201d</p><p>She gave him a sympathetic expression. \u201cYour queen\u2019s trapped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNay, she\u2019s not.\u201d He wailed that denial.</p><p>Nicholaa hid her smile, moved her bishop, and then snatched Hugh\u2019s queen from the board.</p><p>Royce was having difficulty believing what he\u2019d just witnessed. After the first two moves, he\u2019d thought the cunning she\u2019d shown was but a fluke. He was forced to reevaluate that position when she executed her next move. The game was brilliantly executed. She was brilliant.</p><p>Hugh\u2019s head fell to rest on his arms. \u201cIt didn\u2019t take more than eight moves to best me.\u201d</p><p>Nicholaa reached over and patted his shoulder. \u201cYou\u2019re getting much better with each game, Hugh.\u201d</p><p>He straightened up. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not,\u201d he muttered. \u201cBut you\u2019ve got a kind heart to lie to me, Nicholaa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not lying,\u201d she blurted out with a hasty glance in her husband\u2019s direction. \u201cYou really have improved.\u201d</p><p>Hugh snorted. He stood, bowed formally to Nicholaa, and then announced he was going to bed. \u201cI\u2019m going to miss your wife more than I\u2019ll miss you, Royce,\u201d he called out as he strode toward the entrance.</p><p>\u201cIn court Hugh\u2019s considered a good chess player,\u201d Royce remarked.</p><p>Nicholaa smiled. The dimple was back in her cheek. \u201cI\u2019m better.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t contradict that arrogant reply. She was better. \u201cAye, you are better,\u201d he acknowledged. \u201cBut then, so am I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps,\u201d she allowed. \u201cI won\u2019t be challenging you to a game, though. Your feelings would be hurt when I beat you.\u201d</p><p>He was so astonished by the remark that he burst into laughter. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t beat me, wife, and my feelings wouldn\u2019t be affected.\u201d</p><p>The look she gave him suggested she didn\u2019t believe him. She started to stand up, thinking she\u2019d put the chess set back on the mantel, but Royce stopped her by placing his hand on hers.</p><p>\u201cStay where you are, wife. It\u2019s time for our discussion.\u201d</p><p>Then he stood up. Nicholaa let out a little sigh. She smoothed her hair back over her shoulders, folded her hands on the tabletop, and smiled up at Royce. He\u2019d moved to the other side of the table and now stood there towering over her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ready to listen,\u201d she announced.</p><p>\u201cAbout last night . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was yet another attempt on your part to manipulate me, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Royce patiently waited for her to deny her scheme to get him drunk. Then he was going to force her to be honest, even if it took him the rest of the night. He had his argument ready, point by logical point.</p><p>\u201cYes, Royce, I was trying to manipulate you.\u201d</p><p>He was brought up short by her ready agreement. He quickly recovered. \u201cYour plan went sour, didn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you remember what you told me?\u201d</p><p>She was getting a crick in her neck from having to look up at him. She wished he\u2019d either sit down or back up a step or two. \u201cOnly little pieces,\u201d she admitted. \u201cI believe I told you Ulric is my brother\u2019s son. Or had you guessed that?\u201d</p><p>He was about to answer her, then changed his mind. \u201cAll right, Nicholaa,\u201d he said in a clipped voice. \u201cWhat is this new game you\u2019re playing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not playing a game.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why are you being so agreeable?\u201d</p><p>She lifted her shoulders in a dainty shrug. \u201cI promised to be completely honest with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you believe you were being honest with me last night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had planned to tell you several things last night,\u201d she returned. \u201cI was going to be completely honest with you when I told you about my family. Yes, I was being honest all right. I certainly was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you wanted to get me drunk first.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI thought it would be easier for you to accept the truth that way.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cYou thought you\u2019d manipulate me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess you could look at it that way,\u201d she countered. \u201cI admit it was a foolish plan, Royce. Is that what you\u2019re after?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s a good beginning,\u201d he allowed.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s exactly why I did it. Also, I would like a new beginning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou would?\u201d</p><p>She turned her gaze to her hands. \u201cI would like for us to get along well together.\u201d</p><p>The wistfulness in her voice caught his attention. He stared at her for a long minute while he decided if she was being honest with him or trying to manipulate him again. \u201cThis is important to you?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes.\u201d She looked at him. \u201cVery important.\u201d</p><p>He believed her. He smiled.</p><p>\u201cYou are amused by my opinion?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He didn\u2019t give her time to work herself up into a fit of temper. \u201cI\u2019m pleased, not amused,\u201d he explained. \u201cI also wish for us to get along well together,\u201d he added gruffly.</p><p>Her eyes widened in surprise. He sounded so sincere. Then he nodded.</p><p>She nodded back.</p><p>Hell, she\u2019d taken all the bluster out of him. He was suddenly feeling as awkward as a fresh squire unfamiliar with his new duties.</p><p>\u201cWell, then, we are in agreement,\u201d Royce said.</p><p>She nodded again and started to stand up. He turned around and clasped his hands behind his back.</p><p>She sat down again. She knew what was coming. Her easy agreement hadn\u2019t stopped him after all. It was time for the lecture. \u201cA husband should have ultimate confidence that his wife will always be honest with him,\u201d he announced.</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019ve never been married before,\u201d she couldn\u2019t resist pointing out. \u201cHow can you know if that is true or not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNicholaa, a man doesn\u2019t have to be burned by fire to know the damage a flame can do.\u201d</p><p>She thought that was a rather peculiar comparison, but the intense look on her husband\u2019s face made her keep her opinion to herself.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m older than you are,\u201d Royce began again. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to trust me to know what I\u2019m talking about. Now then, Nicholaa, speaking of trust . . .\u201d</p><p>Lord, how he liked to lecture her. He resumed his pacing and continued. Nicholaa bowed her head again and began to make a list in her mind of all the chores that needed to be done before Justin and Ulric came home. The floors should have a thorough scrubbing; the baby was crawling now, and she didn\u2019t want his knees to get dusty. She wanted Cook to prepare some of Justin\u2019s favorite dishes, too; that would please her brother. Tomorrow night they would have pheasant and sweet baked apples. Justin loved pheasant. And after the bird had been cooked, she would help Cook redress it with the colorful feathers just to make the dinner a little fancier.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you agree, Nicholaa?\u201d</p><p>Her head came up with a start when she heard her name. Royce was staring at her, obviously waiting for a response. \u201cYes, Royce.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. Then he started in again. \u201cMarriage is like a map.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cA what?\u201d She sounded incredulous.</p><p>\u201cA map,\u201d he said again. \u201cDo not interrupt me when I\u2019m instructing you.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t raise his voice when he gave that command. He never raised his voice, she suddenly realized. Royce was a controlled, disciplined man. In truth, she couldn\u2019t help admiring his restraint. He was kind, too.</p><p>She caught a few more snatches of his lecture before she started daydreaming again and realized that everything he said was meant to ease her adjustment to her new status. He wanted her to be happy. That fact became more and more evident the longer he lectured.</p> <p>The man cared about her\u2014perhaps almost as much as she cared about him. Aye, she did care. She wouldn\u2019t have been sitting there acting so thoroughly interested in his every word if she didn\u2019t care just a little. She was behaving the way her mother used to behave, she realized. Papa loved to retell the same old tired stories again and again and her mother had pretended to be vastly amused each and every time he\u2019d finished.</p><p>Royce liked to lecture her. And now she was pretending to be vastly interested.</p><p>The traditions were continuing.</p><p>A warm feeling filled her. Her mother would be proud of her, for just as she\u2019d protected her husband\u2019s feelings, Nicholaa was trying to protect Royce\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cAnd so, wife, I believe it would be a good idea for you to outline for me the duties you plan to undertake each day,\u201d Royce concluded. \u201cIt\u2019s yet another way we will be able to achieve order in our daily lives.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo you mean to say you want me to stand before you every morning and tell you what I plan to do that day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened in surprise. \u201cBut you aren\u2019t leaving any room for surprises, husband,\u201d she pointed out.</p><p>He looked appalled. \u201cNo, of course not. For God\u2019s sake, Nicholaa, haven\u2019t you heard a word I\u2019ve said?\u201d</p><p>She guessed he\u2019d already covered the topic of spontaneous actions. She didn\u2019t dare smile. \u201cOh, yes,\u201d she rushed out, trying to placate him. \u201cI\u2019ve learned quite a lot. I just wasn\u2019t certain how you felt about . . . surprises.\u201d</p><p>The excuse sounded pitifully lame to her, but Royce looked appeased. She did smile then. \u201cAre you almost finished? It\u2019s getting late, and Clarise promised to have a bath ready for me before bed this evening. I don\u2019t want the water to get cold.\u201d</p> <p>He gave her permission to leave. Her legs were stiff when she walked to the entrance. Lord, how long had she been sitting there?</p><p>She turned to say good night to Royce and noticed he was replacing the chess set on the mantel. She waited until he turned around. \u201cGood night, Royce.\u201d</p><p>He looked at her for a long minute. \u201cYou\u2019re sleeping with me tonight.\u201d</p><p>The harshness in his voice didn\u2019t leave room for argument, but it didn\u2019t frighten her either. Nay, he was only letting her know he was determined.</p><p>But then, so was she. It was time their marriage became real in every sense. It didn\u2019t matter that she was a little afraid. In her heart she knew Royce wouldn\u2019t hurt her.</p><p>The servants had placed a wooden tub in her chamber. Nicholaa took a long bath, all the while reminding herself that everything would be all right. She was even able to smile when she realized she was lecturing herself.</p><p>Clarise hovered about, acting like a substitute mother, but once the servant believed Nicholaa understood exactly what was going to happen, she let the embarrassing topic drop.</p><p>Nicholaa hadn\u2019t told Clarise the full truth, however. She had only learned bits and pieces of information over the years about the marriage act. Her mother had only spoken in generalities, too.</p> <p>Still, Royce would know what to do . . . if she ever gathered enough courage to leave her room and go to his, she thought to herself.</p><p>Clarise finished brushing her hair, then helped her put on her robe. \u201cI don\u2019t believe he bedded you proper last night,\u201d the servant whispered. \u201cYou would have felt a bit of tenderness if he had.\u201d</p><p>Nicholaa nodded. \u201cI don\u2019t believe he touched me,\u201d she whispered back. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t have been honorable. I\u2019m starting to understand how my husband\u2019s mind works, you see. He wouldn\u2019t have touched me when I was in such a . . . vulnerable condition.\u201d</p><p>Nicholaa tied the belt of her robe. She wore a white cotton sleeping gown underneath. She\u2019d started to put on a heavy chemise first, but Clarise told her that wouldn\u2019t do.</p><p>The walk from her chamber to his took forever. She didn\u2019t hesitate, though. She opened the door and hurried inside.</p><p>Royce was kneeling in front of the hearth. He was barefoot, bare-chested, too. The display of muscles across his broad shoulders was impressive when he lifted a fat log and added it to the fire.</p><p>She stood there watching him for a long minute. She said a prayer of thanksgiving that he still had his pants on. She didn\u2019t want to start the night blushing. Royce would notice.</p><p>When she felt a draft around her ankles, she closed the door, then turned around to find Royce leaning against the mantel, staring at her.</p><p>She tried to smile.</p><p>He didn\u2019t smile back. \u201cWhat are you thinking about, husband?\u201d she asked, worrying over his dark, almost brooding expression.</p><p>\u201cI was thinking that I\u2019m married to a very beautiful woman.\u201d</p><p>Her heart started in pounding. \u201cThank you,\u201d she replied. She took a step forward. \u201cDo you know, I believe that\u2019s the very first compliment you\u2019ve ever given me.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cNo, there was one other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you I thought you were cunning when you disguised yourself as a nun. Don\u2019t you remember? It was when we met again at the abbey.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cI do remember, but I didn\u2019t consider that comment a compliment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not? It was more substantial than my comment about your appearance.\u201d</p><p>She was thoroughly confused. \u201cWhy was it more substantial?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA woman can\u2019t do anything about her appearance,\u201d he said. \u201cEither she\u2019s pretty or she isn\u2019t. But her character is quite another matter. Now do you understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand you\u2019re trying to confuse me,\u201d she announced. \u201cAnd I\u2019m still pleased you find me attractive. It doesn\u2019t matter which compliment has more substance.\u201d</p><p>She was also pleased that her voice wasn\u2019t shaky. Her legs were. She didn\u2019t want Royce to know she was a little afraid and very embarrassed about what was going to happen. She was his wife now, not some silly little chit. Why, she didn\u2019t even think she was blushing now.</p><p>Her face was as red as fire. Royce let out a long sigh. Nicholaa was desperately trying to hide her fear from him, but even from across the room he could see how her shoulders trembled. She was wringing the belt of her robe into knots, another telling indication she was frightened.</p><p>\u201cShould I latch the door?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. She kicked off her shoes and walked over to the bed, forgetting in her haste that the door was still unlocked.</p><p>Nicholaa stopped, suddenly so nervous she couldn\u2019t stop rambling. \u201cA compliment about one\u2019s nature is more important because a person has to choose how to behave, whilst a compliment about one\u2019s appearance doesn\u2019t mean overly much because there is no choice involved there. You didn\u2019t bed me last night, did you?\u201d</p><p>It took him a minute to make the switch in topics. \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t bed you last night.\u201d</p><p>She turned her attention to taking her robe off. \u201cI knew you hadn\u2019t,\u201d she whispered. \u201cStill, I needed to ask.\u201d</p><p>She folded the robe just so, then placed it on the foot of the bed.</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to get under the covers now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to?\u201d</p><p>She looked down at the bed, then up at Royce, then back to the bed again. A frown marred her brow. Royce thought she acted as though he\u2019d just asked her to solve all the problems of the world.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe I want to get into bed just yet,\u201d she finally answered.</p><p>\u201cThen don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>She turned to frown at him. \u201cWhy are you being so agreeable?\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cI was told I could catch more vermin with sweet than with sour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho would say such a ridiculous thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said it,\u201d he answered. \u201cLast night.\u201d</p><p>He had such an adorable smile that a little of her fear eased away. \u201cI was sotted,\u201d she answered. She threaded her fingers through her hair and tried to concentrate on the conversation. \u201cI\u2019m ashamed of my behavior. I promise you it won\u2019t happen again. You did notice I drank only water with my supper tonight, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cI\u2019m noticing you don\u2019t sound at all contrite,\u201d he drawled out. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m noticing.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. She was starting to relax, for Royce didn\u2019t seem to be in any particular hurry to bed her. Perhaps he knew she was a bit nervous and was deliberately giving her time to rid herself of her fear.</p><p>That possibility made the rest of her fears vanish. She walked over to stand in front of him. The fact that he towered over her didn\u2019t seem to bother her now. His bare chest bothered her, though. Lord, he was a handsome devil. A warm knot settled in her stomach. His skin was bronzed, and he was powerfully built. His upper arms were sleek with roped muscles, and his chest was magnificent. A sprinkling of dark curly hair covered most of his chest, then tapered into a narrow line that disappeared below the waistband of his pants. She felt a little breathless just looking at him. It was a foolish reaction, she told herself, because she\u2019d seen him without his tunic several times now.</p><p>Still, he hadn\u2019t been thinking about bedding her then. He was now.</p><p>Nicholaa noticed a long, thin scar running down the center of his chest. She touched the mark near the top, then followed the line with her fingertips. The muscles in his stomach contracted when her fingers touched him there.</p><p>\u201cThis blow should have killed you,\u201d she whispered. \u201cYou\u2019ve led a charmed life, Royce, to have suffered so many injuries and still survived.\u201d</p><p>He was having difficulty concentrating on what she was saying to him. Her fingers were rubbing circles on his stomach. The feathery caress made his heartbeat quicken.</p><p>She liked touching him. The heat from his skin surprised her. He was hard all over, yet warm, too. His body reflected his spirit, she decided. Royce was ruthless in battle, but he was being gentle with her. Yes, the warrior\u2019s body protected a kind heart.</p><p>She wrapped her arms around his waist and hugged him.</p><p>He put his arms around her and pulled her even closer, her cheek resting against his chest. \u201cRoyce? Will you explain what\u2019s going to happen?\u201d</p><p>The shyness in her voice made him smile. He kissed the top of her head. He wanted her mouth. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>She leaned back so she could look into his eyes. \u201cYou aren\u2019t going to tell me?\u201d</p><p>He put his hand under her chin so she couldn\u2019t hide her face from him, then slowly leaned down. When he was just a breath away from her mouth he said, \u201cI\u2019ll show you instead, Nicholaa.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t have time to wonder if that was a good idea. Royce caught her full attention when his mouth settled on hers. The kiss wasn\u2019t at all gentle. Nay, it was hot, wet, and blatantly possessive. He used his thumb to force her mouth to open wider for him, and then his tongue swept inside.</p><p>God, she tasted good. He couldn\u2019t get enough of her. His hands stroked her back, then moved lower until he was cupping her backside. He lifted her up and pulled her tight against his arousal.</p><p>Nicholaa tried to move away when she felt his hardness against her, but Royce wouldn\u2019t let her. He tightened his hold. His mouth slanted over hers again and again, until her resistance was forgotten and she was passionately kissing him back.</p><p>The sound of their breathing\u2014his raspy, hers shallow\u2014mingled with the pounding of their hearts.</p><p>He kept up the gentle attack for long minutes. He was determined to go easy, to savor each and every caress. When Nicholaa was ready for deeper intimacy, she would let him know.</p><p>Royce\u2019s legs were braced apart, and he continued to lean back against the mantel as he casually ravaged his wife\u2019s sweet mouth. It didn\u2019t take him long to rid her of her shyness. She began to caress his arms, his shoulders, his back. Then she moved restlessly against him. She cuddled his hardness between her h*ps and pressed against him. When she began to move back and forth, deliberately rubbing against him, his composure vanished. He held her backside and made her stop the torment. It was too soon for him to lose control, he reminded himself, but if his innocent wife didn\u2019t stop her sweet torture, he might forget his vow to go slowly.</p><p>His hands stroked her shoulders, then brushed the sides of her breasts. She shivered with pleasure and reached up to put her arms around his neck. It wasn\u2019t long before she was clinging to him. He finally tore his mouth away from her, then began to nibble on the side of her neck. Her head fell to one side to give him better access. His teeth tugged on her earlobe. She let out a ragged moan.</p><p>Lord, how she pleased him. He\u2019d never taken this much time to woo a woman before, but then, he\u2019d never taken a virgin to his bed, either. Nicholaa was his wife, and he was determined to make this first union perfect for her. Her own uninhibited response to his touch made him feel as though it was his first time, too. His hands shook, and the ache in his groin had become painful.</p><p>\u201cNicholaa, take your nightgown off.\u201d</p><p>He had to pull her arms away from his neck before she could obey him. She bowed her head, turned, and slowly walked over to the side of the bed. She was a little surprised her legs would support her. His kisses had left her feeling weak, light-headed. Her heart pounded a thundering beat when she pulled her gown up over her head. She hurriedly tossed the garment on the foot of the bed, lifted the covers, got under them.</p><p>Royce stripped off the rest of his garments, his gaze on Nicholaa all the while. She was still nervous. Her eyes were tightly closed, and she wouldn\u2019t look at him. His nudity obviously embarrassed her. He smiled at his wife\u2019s innocence while he snuffed out the candle flame. A soft glow from the hearth cast a golden light over Nicholaa\u2019s face. Nothing else was visible to him, because she\u2019d pulled the covers up to her chin.</p><p>He went to her side of the bed and pulled the covers aside. He didn\u2019t give her time to shield herself or move away from him. He came down on top of her, bracing his arms on either side of her shoulders so his weight wouldn\u2019t crush her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The contact of his body against hers almost shattered his control. It was the most wonderful feeling he\u2019d ever experienced. She was so soft all over. He suddenly wanted to touch her everywhere. His heart started slamming inside his chest, and he had to take a deep breath to try to regain his discipline.</p><p>The initial touch of his body against hers overwhelmed her. He was so hard, so hot, so big all over. He seemed to swallow her up. When he forced her thighs apart with his knee and settled himself between her legs, his hardness pressed against her pelvis, she went completely rigid.</p><p>The time had finally come, she realized. She braced herself for the pain she\u2019d heard so much about. She took a ragged breath and tried to prepare herself for his invasion.</p><p>Royce kissed her forehead, then looked down at her. He waited for her to open her eyes. Then he grinned at her. \u201cFeels good, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Lord, he sounded pleased with himself. He looked happy, too. Royce didn\u2019t act at all like a man crazed with lust, either. When that realization settled in her mind, she began to relax. \u201cIt feels strange to me,\u201d she admitted.</p><p>She rubbed her toes against his legs. His crisp hair tickled her. The differences between their bodies amazed her. The heat from his chest against her br**sts made her ni**les ache in an odd, heavy way. His arousal, nestled intimately against the juncture of her thighs, made that heavy, warm feeling permeate her stomach and pelvis, too. It felt good to her, and yet she ached at the same time. The feeling was as confusing to her as her sudden awareness that Royce didn\u2019t seem to be at all affected by their closeness.</p><p>The fear had left her eyes. Now his wife looked disgruntled. He wondered what thoughts were going through her mind now.</p><p>\u201cYou do want me, don\u2019t you, Royce?\u201d</p><p>He almost laughed. She sounded worried. The effort to act as though he had all the time in the world to bed her had been worth the agony, he told himself. If Nicholaa had any idea of the battle he was undergoing to keep her calm, if she could guess what he wanted to do to her, she\u2019d probably swoon.</p><p>\u201cYes, I want you. Can\u2019t you feel me against you? I ache with my need for you, Nicholaa.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened. \u201cYou ache?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. He took her hand and shifted his weight so she could touch his hard arousal. Yet the second her fingers brushed against him, his forehead dropped on top of hers and he let out a ragged groan.</p><p>She was both curious and terrified. When he moaned, she pulled her hand away. He put it back. She knew then he liked her touch.</p><p>\u201cRoyce?\u201d</p><p>He gritted his teeth against the fear he heard in her voice, then let out a sigh. \u201cYes, Nicholaa?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe won\u2019t fit.\u201d</p><p>He lifted up to look into her eyes again. She wasn\u2019t teasing him. The worry was there in her gaze. His smile was filled with tenderness. \u201cAye, we will fit,\u201d he promised her in a husky whisper.</p><p>Her fingers closed around his shaft. He closed his eyes in blissful surrender. The pleasure her touch gave him amazed her. It made her feel bold\u2014powerful, too. She squeezed him. He growled, then pulled her hand away and put it around his neck.</p><p>He was taking deep breaths against her neck. His warm breath sent shivers down her legs. \u201cI\u2019m glad you want me,\u201d she whispered. \u201cIs there something I should do to help you?\u201d</p><p>He kissed the blush on her cheek, then kissed the bridge of her nose. \u201cJust tell me what you like, Nicholaa. I want to please you.\u201d</p><p>She gently stroked his face. \u201cI want to please you too, husband.\u201d</p><p>His mouth covered hers then. The kiss was hot, wet, thoroughly arousing. He gave her his tongue; she caught it between her teeth just to tease him. His growl told her he liked that. Then he nibbled on her neck again. His chest hair rubbing against her br**sts felt good, and she suddenly wanted more. She deliberately rubbed against him. The warm knot inside her began to expand.</p><p>Royce liked her restless motions as much as she did. He couldn\u2019t seem to get enough of her soon enough. He kissed her shoulders while his hands caressed her breasts. When his thumbs brushed over her nipples, she arched up against him to let him know how much she liked that.</p> <p>His actions weren\u2019t as deliberate now, for his control was quickly vanishing. He moved down her body until he was able to kiss her breasts. He cupped her left breast in his hand, then took the nipple into his mouth. She whimpered when he began to suckle. She clung to his shoulders and arched up against him again.</p><p>He kissed the valley between her breasts. His hand moved down between her thighs. His fingers gently touched the heat there. The soft curls shielding her virginity were damp with passion. Nicholaa tried to push his hand away, but he wouldn\u2019t be deterred. \u201cYou\u2019ll like this,\u201d he promised before his mouth claimed hers again for a long, hot kiss.</p><p>His thumb rubbed against her most sensitive spot. She arched up against him and moaned into his mouth. White-hot desire claimed her. She kissed him with a passion that left him shaken. Royce slowly forced his fingers inside her slick, tight opening. His own desire was almost completely out of control now. A sheen of perspiration covered his brow. Nicholaa felt hot, wet, wonderful. His mouth clung to hers, and his tongue slid in and out in a mating ritual that his fingers mimicked until she was bucking against his hand and whimpering with pleasure.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t wait any longer. He moved between her legs, spread her thighs farther apart, and slowly began to penetrate her. Her nails dug into his shoulder blades. She squirmed, trying to get away from him, and inadvertently took a little more of him inside herself. He stopped when he felt the shield of her virginity blocking him. He tried to be gentle as he pushed through the barrier. She wouldn\u2019t let him. She tightened against him and tried to push him away.</p><p>He soothed her with honeyed words while he stroked her backside. She didn\u2019t understand his intent when he lifted her thighs higher up on his hips.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t fight me, Nicholaa,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>She barely understood what he was telling her. Her mind was a riot of emotions. She was trembling with desire, and yet the ache he was causing made the pleasure and the pain blend into such confusing feelings. She didn\u2019t want him to hurt her, but she didn\u2019t want him to stop, either.</p><p>He didn\u2019t give her any warning. With one powerful thrust, he broke through the shield and fully embedded himself inside her.</p><p>Nicholaa cried out in pain. She clung to her husband, buried her face against his neck, and demanded that he move away from her.</p><p>He wouldn\u2019t obey her.</p><p>\u201cRoyce, you\u2019re hurting me.\u201d</p><p>Bracing his weight on his elbows, he kissed her hard. His hands cupped her face. Nicholaa tried to move away from him again, but his weight made that impossible. Tears streamed down her face. She was throbbing with pain, though in truth the raw feeling had eased.</p><p>The look on Royce\u2019s face was intense, determined, and yet there was tenderness there as well. \u201cIt\u2019s going to feel better soon,\u201d he whispered. He took a deep, shuddering breath. \u201cGive me just a minute, sweetheart. Then I\u2019ll help you like it.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t want his help. She wanted him to get off of her. He tried to kiss her again. She turned her face away from him. Royce followed her. He tugged on her lower lip with his teeth until she opened for him; then he kissed her long and hard.</p><p>Royce didn\u2019t know how much longer he could maintain his control. The sweet torture of holding still inside her made him throb with pain. He wanted to slam into her tight sheath again and again until he found his release and spilled his seed into her.</p><p>He wanted her to want that as much as he did, though. Her pleasure was far more important to him than his own.</p><p>The longer he kissed her, the more she relaxed. Royce was deliberately giving her body time to adjust to him, and when she finally began to caress his shoulders, he thought the initial pain might have eased.</p><p>His hand moved down between their joined bodies. Nicholaa caught hold of his wrist and tried to stop him. \u201cLet go, Nicholaa,\u201d he ordered, his voice a ragged whisper. \u201cYou\u2019ll like this.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t stop him. He was right, too, she realized with a sigh. She did like the way he was touching her now. His fingers knew just where to stroke. When his thumb brushed against the sensitive nub hidden between her soft feminine folds, she almost came off the bed. The pleasure was intense, consuming.</p><p>He kept up the sweet torment until she felt as though her body had turned to liquid in his arms. Her whole body instinctively tightened around him. He groaned in reaction. He partially withdrew, then sank deep inside her again.</p><p>Her control was slipping away. She couldn\u2019t seem to catch a thought and hold on to it. The pressure building inside her was unbearable. She wanted Royce to stop, for she was suddenly terrified by the feelings overwhelming her, and yet she didn\u2019t want him to stop, and that scared her even more.</p><p>\u201cRoyce, I can\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>He silenced her protest with a deep kiss. \u201cIt\u2019s all right, love. Don\u2019t be afraid. I\u2019ll keep you safe.\u201d</p><p>His soothing words pushed her fear and her control away. He would keep her safe. Nicholaa\u2019s heart accepted what her mind couldn\u2019t sort out. She let the feelings take over. She pulled her knees up so that she could take him deeper inside herself, and then arched against him with bold insistence.</p><p>His control snapped. He thrust into her again and again, mindless now to everything but giving her fulfillment and finding his own. The mating ritual took over. The bed rocked with his forceful thrusts. And hers.</p><p>She knew she was coming apart in his arms. She didn\u2019t care. She called his name as wave after wave of pleasure washed over her. Her cl**ax was so shattering she started to cry.</p><p>When he felt her tighten around him and cry out his name, he found his own release. He poured his seed into her with a grunt of surrender.</p><p>She thought she might have died. Yet her heart was pounding so furiously that she knew she was still alive. When Royce let out a low groan and collapsed against her, she thought he might be feeling much the same way.</p><p>She was blissfully exhausted and thoroughly astonished by what had just happened to her. She closed her eyes and tried to make sense out of the wonderful act.</p><p>It took Royce a long while to recover. He didn\u2019t want to move. The scent of their lovemaking still hovered in the air around them. He liked that. He liked his scent on her, too.</p><p>God, he was content. It seemed so right to hold Nicholaa in his arms. It was as though she\u2019d always belonged to him.</p><p>\u201cRoyce?\u201d</p><p>He grunted his answer.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re crushing me.\u201d</p><p>He reluctantly rolled onto his back. She snuggled up against his side and used his shoulder for her pillow.</p><p>Her fingers caressed his chest. \u201cDid I please you, husband?\u201d</p><p>His hand covered hers. \u201cYes, you pleased me.\u201d</p><p>She waited a long minute to hear more praise, then whispered, \u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>He yawned. \u201cAnd what?\u201d</p><p>She waited again for him to give her more compliments. He waited for her to explain what she wanted from him.</p><p>Neither said a word. It didn\u2019t take Nicholaa long at all to start feeling vulnerable. She shivered and rolled away from Royce. She was beginning to feel embarrassed over her wanton behavior. His silence was tarnishing their beautiful union.</p><p>Nicholaa pulled the covers up and turned away from him. Tears filled her eyes. She didn\u2019t understand why she felt like weeping, but she did. She hoped Royce wouldn\u2019t know how foolishly she was behaving. He\u2019d ask for an explanation, and since she didn\u2019t know why she was feeling so sad, she certainly wouldn\u2019t be able to tell him.</p><p>\u201cNicholaa?\u201d</p><p>His voice was gruff with affection when he whispered her name. \u201cCome back here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s where you belong.\u201d</p><p>That wasn\u2019t a compliment by any means, but the joy she felt was there all the same. She rolled back against his side. Royce put his arms around her and pulled her tight against him.</p><p>There weren\u2019t any more compliments, or fervent declarations of love either. He did kiss her on the top of her head, though.</p><p>It was just a simple little kiss.</p><p>But it was enough.</p><p>Chapter Twelve</p><p>Royce had already left the bedroom when Nicholaa finally awakened. Sunlight streamed through the open window. When she realized it was late morning, she was astonished. She\u2019d never slept this long, or this soundly. It was decadent, she supposed with a happy sigh.</p><p>She felt wonderful until she got out of bed. The tenderness between her thighs drew her attention then. Her legs were stiff, too. The discomfort didn\u2019t blemish the memory of last night, though. Nothing could ever mar the beauty of their lovemaking.</p><p>She was officially his wife now, she realized with a smile. She\u2019d done her duty and pleased him, too.</p><p>They could have a good life together. Royce was a good man. He was a Norman, of course, but he was also kind, considerate, and understanding.</p><p>Nicholaa lingered in the bedroom until she realized it was embarrassment that kept her hidden. She wasn\u2019t certain how she should behave when she saw Royce again. Would he want her to kiss him in greeting? She shook her head over that fanciful notion. The man was a warrior. Of course he wouldn\u2019t want her to kiss him in daylight. He probably wouldn\u2019t want her to show any sign of affection in front of his men. Still, if they chanced to meet each other alone in a corridor, then . . .</p><p>She let out a loud sigh. She was being foolish. She had a household to run, and there were many pressing duties that required her immediate attention. She shouldn\u2019t be wasting her time worrying about her husband\u2019s wants and her own embarrassment.</p><p>Nicholaa dressed in a pale blue gown with a cream-colored underskirt, then hurried downstairs. Odd, but she didn\u2019t run into a single servant along the way.</p><p>A sizable group of knights had gathered in the great hall. They stood in a cluster around the long table. Only three men were seated. She spotted Royce right away at the head of the table. He was half turned away from her, speaking in a low voice to his men. Lawrence sat on Royce\u2019s right, and the young blond man named Ingelram sat on his left.</p><p>Everyone seemed tense. Nicholaa assumed an important secret meeting was in progress, and she didn\u2019t know if she should interrupt. Then Lawrence happened to look up. He noticed her, smiled, and nudged Royce.</p><p>Her husband slowly turned his head. He didn\u2019t smile. He simply looked at her for a long minute, then beckoned her forward.</p><p>Odd, but she thought she saw a glimpse of relief in his expression, but that didn\u2019t make any sense. Why would he be relieved to see her?</p><p>She pushed that thought aside while she tried to hide her irritation. Lord, how she hated it when he beckoned to her. Couldn\u2019t the man call out a decent greeting? And why couldn\u2019t he come to her side once in a while? Nicholaa decided to put those questions to him as soon as they were alone. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Everyone watched her as she walked across the room. She felt awkward and unsure of herself, a feeling that was new to her and one she didn\u2019t like at all.</p><p>She took a deep breath. \u201cPray forgive me for interrupting your conference, husband,\u201d she called out. \u201cI\u2014\u201d</p><p>She came to an abrupt stop, then let out a low gasp of surprise.</p><p>Little Ulric was home. The baby was sound asleep, nestled in the crook of Royce\u2019s arm. He was wrapped in a sparkling white blanket, and only his face was visible to her.</p> <p>Nicholaa stared at her beautiful nephew while she struggled to contain the tears that came into her eyes.</p><p>She didn\u2019t even realize she\u2019d rushed to Royce\u2019s side. He grabbed her around the waist to hold her steady. When she finally looked up at him, his breath caught in his throat. The joy in her gaze warmed his heart.</p><p>Royce couldn\u2019t imagine why her pleasure meant so much to him, but he accepted the truth that her joy had become his joy as well.</p><p>Nicholaa felt a tear slip down her cheek. She wiped it away. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p> <p>\u201cShall I take Ulric abovestairs so that you may continue with your conference?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cThe servants are cleaning his chamber,\u201d Royce answered. He tightened his hold around her waist when she tried to move back. \u201cWe weren\u2019t in conference,\u201d he added almost as an afterthought.</p><p>\u201cBut you were whispering . . .\u201d She suddenly realized why. \u201cYou kept your voices low so you wouldn\u2019t disturb the baby.\u201d</p><p>He nodded again. He let go of her, then stood up and placed Ulric in her arms. After motioning to his men to leave the hall, Royce started toward the entrance. Then he suddenly turned around and walked back to her. He grasped her chin, leaned down, and kissed her hard.</p><p>She was clutching his tunic with one hand and clutching the sleeping babe with the other when he pulled back. \u201cYou are feeling well today?\u201d he asked, his voice a gruff whisper.</p><p>It took her a minute to concentrate on what he was asking her. Then she nodded. \u201cYou\u2019ve just given me back my nephew,\u201d she answered. \u201cHow could I not feel well?\u201d</p> <p>He shook his head. \u201cThat isn\u2019t what I meant,\u201d he said. \u201cI hurt you last night. It was necessary, Nicholaa, but now I\u2019m . . . concerned that I might have been too rough with you.\u201d</p><p>She immediately turned her gaze to his chest. She could feel her cheeks burning. \u201cYou were very considerate,\u201d she whispered. \u201cAnd I am only just a little tender.\u201d</p><p>He started to turn away, obviously appeased by her explanation. She tightened her hold on his tunic and blurted out a question. \u201cRoyce? Do you wish me to kiss you each morning?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cDo you want to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t that I want to,\u201d she answered. \u201cIt\u2019s what we should do\u2014for Ulric.\u201d</p><p>He raised an eyebrow. Her cheeks were burning now. He felt like laughing. She was such a joy to watch when she was embarrassed. \u201cWe should kiss Ulric?\u201d he asked, knowing full well that wasn\u2019t what she meant. He just didn\u2019t want the ludicrous conversation to end.</p><p>\u201cYes, of course we should kiss Ulric. Babies need affection, Royce. But we should also kiss each other in front of Ulric. Then he\u2019ll feel content.\u201d</p><p>She was making a mess of things, she decided. \u201cA baby should be surrounded by a happy family,\u201d she continued. \u201cIf he sees us kissing, he\u2019ll assume we\u2019re happy. Now do you understand?\u201d</p> <p>He grinned at her. He bent down until his lips were just an inch away from her mouth. \u201cI understand you want me to kiss you every morning.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t give her time to argue with him. He kissed her just to take her mind off the matter, then once again turned to leave the hall.</p><p>She hurried after him. \u201cRoyce, what about Justin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about him?\u201d he called over his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cDid you bring him home, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t understand his sudden abrupt manner. \u201cI\u2019d like to welcome my brother home,\u201d she said. \u201cCould you please ask him to come inside?\u201d</p><p>Royce stopped. He turned around and stared at her for a long minute. She noticed how incredulous he looked. What had she said to cause that reaction? she wondered.</p><p>\u201cAsk him?\u201d His voice had gone hoarse.</p><p>She nodded. \u201cYes, please.\u201d</p><p>He let out a loud sigh. \u201cNicholaa, you do understand Justin\u2019s position now, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t know what he was talking about. \u201cI understand he\u2019s home now,\u201d she replied.</p><p>\u201cThis is no longer his home, wife. It\u2019s mine. Your brother is now a soldier in my ranks. I don\u2019t ask anything of my men. I give commands, not requests.\u201d He could tell from the look on her face that she still didn\u2019t understand.</p><p>\u201cAll right, then,\u201d she said. \u201cPlease command my brother to come inside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d</p><p>She had to chase him to the front doors before she was finally able to stop him again. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why you\u2019re being so difficult,\u201d she announced. \u201cJustin was born and raised here. This is his home. If you don\u2019t want him to come inside, then I\u2019ll go outside.\u201d</p><p>He blocked the doorway. \u201cYou will stay inside and see to Ulric\u2019s comfort, Nicholaa. You may see Justin after he\u2019s settled in.\u201d</p><p>She frowned in confusion, but decided not to argue. \u201cI\u2019ll be happy to wait until he\u2019s settled in. Do you suppose it will take him an hour or two?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNay, wife, I suppose it will take at least a month, possibly more. Until then you will stay away from him. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>Royce shut the door behind him before she could protest that appalling dictate. Nicholaa couldn\u2019t believe he\u2019d really meant it. He couldn\u2019t possibly expect her to ignore her brother.</p><p>She mulled over that worry until Ulric started squirming in her arms. She looked down to find him smiling up at her. Her mood immediately lightened. She carried the babe upstairs and got him settled in his new home.</p><p>Nicholaa spent the remainder of the day with her nephew. She thought Ulric was terribly clever. He could get from one end of the room to another with a speed and agility she found amazing. If he was this quick now, what would he be like when he was walking?</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have to nail our possessions down once he starts running about,\u201d Clarise commented. \u201cCould you hold him for a moment, mistress? The baron wishes us to move this chest to his room.\u201d</p><p>Nicholaa canceled that order. \u201cLeave it here, Clarise. We can use it for Ulric\u2019s things.\u201d</p><p>Before supper that night, Nicholaa had countermanded at least six more of Royce\u2019s orders. He\u2019d told Cook to prepare quail for the meal. She changed the order to pheasant.</p><p>After Ulric had been put to bed for the night, with Alice acting as his nanny until other arrangements could be made, Nicholaa returned to the great hall. The long table had been moved to the center of the room, near the fireplace. She had it moved back where it belonged. The servants did as she requested, for they were extremely loyal to her.</p><p>Nicholaa didn\u2019t think Royce had even noticed his orders hadn\u2019t been followed. He didn\u2019t say a word about the position of the table. He ate a fair portion of the pheasant, too. Supper was really very pleasant. Lawrence and Ingelram joined them at the table, and most of the talk centered on the plans to expand the holding. Royce wasn\u2019t specific about his plans, though.</p><p>\u201cDo you mean to build a new wall or reinforce the perfectly sound one we now have?\u201d Nicholaa asked.</p><p>\u201cNay, my lady, the wall isn\u2019t sound,\u201d Ingelram said.</p><p>Nicholaa turned her attention to the vassal. \u201cIt isn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>Ingelram was so bewitched by his beautiful mistress that he couldn\u2019t remember what they were talking about. Her pretty blue eyes took his concentration away. Her smile stole his heart. He could barely catch a breath.</p><p>The elbow in his side helped him gain control of himself. He turned to catch his baron\u2019s scowl. \u201cYou may be excused, Ingelram.\u201d</p><p>The vassal jumped to do his lord\u2019s bidding, overturning a stool in his haste. He hurried to right the damage, bowed formally to Royce, and then rushed out of the room.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with him?\u201d Nicholaa asked.</p><p>\u201cYou,\u201d Lawrence announced.</p><p>Nicholaa\u2019s shoulders straightened. \u201cWhat do you mean, Lawrence? I barely said a word to Ingelram. I couldn\u2019t have upset him. He was acting peculiar all through supper, though, wasn\u2019t he, Royce?\u201d</p><p>She waited for her husband\u2019s nod, then turned back to Lawrence. \u201cDo you see? Royce noticed, too. Why, Ingelram barely ate.\u201d She waved her hand toward the bread trencher filled with food. \u201cHe must not be feeling well.\u201d</p><p>Lawrence smiled. Ingelram wasn\u2019t ill. The boy hadn\u2019t eaten because he\u2019d been too occupied gaping at his beautiful mistress. She was a charmer, all right, the vassal admitted. And when those blue eyes were looking directly at a man, it was possible to forget every serious thought.</p><p>Nicholaa wondered about Lawrence\u2019s sudden grin. She thought it was a rather odd reaction to her suggestion that Ingelram might be ill. She put the matter aside and looked at Royce again. He was smiling, too. She didn\u2019t know why her husband was pleased, but decided to seize upon the opportunity. \u201cIs Justin feeling well?\u201d</p><p>Royce shrugged. Then he changed the topic. \u201cLawrence, as soon as you\u2019re finished, call the servants together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you want to call the servants together?\u201d Nicholaa asked.</p><p>\u201cI want to speak to them.\u201d</p><p>She ignored his frown. \u201cMost of the servants have already taken to their beds, husband. They get up before dawn each day.\u201d</p><p>Royce ignored her. \u201cLawrence?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, my lord,\u201d the vassal said. \u201cI\u2019ll see to it at once.\u201d</p><p>Nicholaa started to protest again. Royce put his hand over hers and squeezed. As soon as Lawrence left the hall, Royce turned back to her. \u201cDo not question my orders again, Nicholaa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t questioning,\u201d she argued. She tried to pull her hand away. He wouldn\u2019t let her. \u201cI was just being curious. Please tell me why you want to speak to the servants at this late hour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well,\u201d he said. \u201cI gave specific instructions this morning, and they were not followed. Those who defied me will be removed from the holding.\u201d</p><p>She was appalled. \u201cRemoved? But where would they go? They belong here. Surely you cannot mean to force them out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t give a damn where they go,\u201d he countered in a hard voice.</p><p>\u201cThese . . . instructions were of extreme importance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cEach and every order must be followed,\u201d he said. \u201cThe importance isn\u2019t determined by the soldiers or servants.\u201d</p><p>Nicholaa was so infuriated by his unbending position that she wanted to scream. She was just as worried about her staff, though, and knew that shouting at her arrogant husband wouldn\u2019t help their cause. \u201cYou will not give them a second chance? One sin and they are condemned?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cIn battle a knight is never given a second chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t a battle.\u201d</p><p>Aye, it was a battle, he thought to himself. And Nicholaa was his opponent. He knew she was the one who had changed his orders. Now he wanted her to admit it. Then he would calmly explain the importance of organization, the necessity of a hierarchy, and where her place was in his household.</p><p>He almost smiled. His wife was so outraged she could barely sit still. The training had begun.</p><p>His voice was mild when he said, \u201cDo not raise your voice to me, wife.\u201d</p><p>Nicholaa stared at her husband a long minute. He wasn\u2019t bluffing, she finally decided. She took a deep breath. She wasn\u2019t about to let her servants take the blame for her error in judgment. \u201cI have a request, husband.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would like to speak to the servants first, if you will allow my interference.\u201d</p><p>She was thankful when he simply nodded, a warm glint in his eyes, but she didn\u2019t understand the reason for his reaction.</p><p>The servants came hurrying into the great hall, some dressed in their nightclothes. Nicholaa stood up and walked around the table, her hands folded in front of her, her expression serene.</p><p>Alice was the last to join the group. Nicholaa nodded to her. \u201cMy husband has graciously allowed me to speak to you first,\u201d she began. She was pleased her voice didn\u2019t crack; her heart was about to. \u201cToday your lord gave some of you specific orders.\u201d</p><p>Several servants nodded. Nicholaa smiled. \u201cI changed those orders. That was thoughtless of me,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd I apologize both to my husband and to you for creating confusion.\u201d</p><p>As she came to the difficult part, she took another deep breath. \u201cIn future, when my husband gives an order, you will obey it. If I should inadvertently contradict that command, please remind me that you must follow your lord\u2019s order. He is master of this holding now, and you must be loyal to him above all others.\u201d</p><p>Clarise took a step forward. \u201cAbove even you, milady?\u201d she asked with a frown.</p><p>Nicholaa nodded. \u201cYes, above even me. Are there any other questions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if you be the one to give the order first and the baron changes it?\u201d Alice called out.</p><p>\u201cYou will follow my husband\u2019s command, Alice.\u201d</p><p>The servants nodded. Nicholaa held on to her smile. \u201cMy husband would like to speak to you now.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t turn to Royce but slowly walked out of the hall, hoping he wouldn\u2019t call her back. She knew she wouldn\u2019t be able to maintain her smile when she was feeling so bloody furious inside.</p><p>Nicholaa muttered to herself all the way up the stairs. Her husband was a cad. First he\u2019d taken away her holding, and now he was determined to take away her servants\u2019 loyalty, too. It was all so unfair and damn lopsided, too. Why did she always have to be the one to give in? She supposed it was because the Normans had won the war. Still, she was Royce\u2019s wife now, and he should consider her opinions.</p><p>She passed her old chamber and decided to look in on Ulric. Surely the sight of the precious baby would remind her why she was trying to get along with her obstinate husband.</p><p>She tried to be as quiet as possible when she went inside so she wouldn\u2019t disturb the baby. Nicholaa was just closing the door behind her when she thought she noticed a movement in the shadows on her left. She instinctively turned. Then she tried to scream. A hand clamped down hard over her mouth to cut off the sound. Nicholaa was pulled up against what felt very like a stone wall. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She fought like a wild woman. She bit her captor\u2019s hand while she clawed at his arm with her nails.</p><p>\u201cDamn it, Nicholaa. Stop it. It\u2019s me, Thurston.\u201d</p><p>She went limp against him. Her brother removed his hand and slowly turned her around to face him.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t believe her brother was standing there in front of her. She was overwhelmed. And terrified. \u201cAre you out of your mind, Thurston?\u201d she whispered. \u201cWhy would you take such a risk? How did you get inside? Dear God, if they find you here . . .\u201d</p> <p>Thurston put his arms around her and hugged her tight. \u201cI came up through one of the secret passages. I had to see you, Nicholaa. I needed to make certain you were all right. God, I almost killed you, didn\u2019t I? When I saw the golden hair, I knew it was you my arrow had hit.\u201d</p><p>The anguish in his voice tore at her heart. \u201cIt was only a scratch,\u201d she lied.</p><p>\u201cThe Norman was in my sights, but at the last second you threw yourself in front of him. Why? Were you trying to protect him? It looked that way to me, but that explanation doesn\u2019t make any sense. Did you know I was there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw you, Thurston. I guessed Royce was your target.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRoyce? Is that the name of your captor?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe isn\u2019t my captor,\u201d she whispered. \u201cHe\u2019s my husband.\u201d</p><p>Thurston didn\u2019t take that news well. He squeezed her arms with such force she knew she would have bruises, and the look in his blue eyes indicated his fury. Nicholaa pried his hands away while she tried to think of a way to make him understand. \u201cThere is much to talk about,\u201d she blurted out. \u201cDon\u2019t judge me until you know all the facts.\u201d</p><p>She took her brother\u2019s hand and led him across the chamber and away from the sleeping baby.</p><p>Moonlight filtered through the window. Nicholaa lit a candle and looked up at her brother.</p><p>Thurston was every bit as big as Royce. Her brother had blond hair and an unscarred complexion. He was a handsome man, even when he was scowling, but he looked tired.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t come back here,\u201d Nicholaa said. \u201cRoyce has found most of the passages. It\u2019s only a matter of time before he discovers the one that leads to this room, too. I don\u2019t want anything to happen to you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNicholaa, were you forced to marry this Norman?\u201d</p><p>There wasn\u2019t time to explain everything that had happened. Thurston would never understand, anyway. She took a deep breath. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t want to believe her. \u201cYou weren\u2019t forced?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said again. \u201cI chose him. If anyone was forced into this marriage, it was Royce, not me.\u201d</p><p>Thurston leaned against the window ledge. A clap of thunder sounded in the distance. Nicholaa jumped. Her brother folded his arms across his chest and stared at her. \u201cWhy would you do such a thing?\u201d</p><p>She knew the full truth would only fuel his anger. \u201cIf the circumstances were different, and if you could meet my husband, you\u2019d know why I chose him. Royce is a good man, Thurston. He\u2019s been very kind to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a Norman.\u201d</p><p>He spit that reminder out like a blasphemy. The fury in his voice made her stomach lurch. It made her angry, too. \u201cThe war\u2019s over, Thurston. If you don\u2019t kneel before William and give your pledge of loyalty, you\u2019ll be killed. I beg you, please accept this. I don\u2019t want you to die.\u201d</p> <p>He shook his head. \u201cThe war isn\u2019t over,\u201d he said. \u201cThe resistance is growing stronger with each passing day. It\u2019s only a matter of time before we unseat the bastard Norman king.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou cannot believe this foolishness,\u201d she cried out.</p><p>Thurston let out a weary sigh. \u201cYou\u2019ve been isolated here, Nicholaa. You can\u2019t understand. We have to leave now. My men are waiting outside the walls. Wrap Ulric in the blankets. Hurry, before the storm breaks.\u201d</p><p>Nicholaa was too stunned to react at first. Thurston towered over her. She took a step back, then shook her head. \u201cI can\u2019t go with you. Royce is my husband now. I have to stay here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t mean to stay with him.\u201d</p><p>The disgust in her brother\u2019s voice made her stomach ache. She bowed her head. \u201cI want to stay here.\u201d</p><p>A long moment passed in silence. Thurston\u2019s voice shook when he spoke again. \u201cGod have mercy on your soul, Nicholaa. You love him, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until that very moment, when she was actually confronted with the truth, that she acknowledged it in her mind. \u201cYes, I love him.\u201d</p><p>Sickened by her confession, her brother lashed out, slapping her hard across the face. The blow almost toppled her over. Nicholaa staggered, then quickly recovered. Her face burned with pain, but she didn\u2019t cry out. She simply stared up at her brother and waited to see what he would do next.</p><p>He had never before raised his hand against her. Thurston had always had a terrible temper, but he\u2019d been reasonable, too. It was the war, she told herself, that had turned him into a stranger.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve become a traitor,\u201d he said.</p><p>Those words hurt more than the blow. Nicholaa\u2019s eyes filled with tears. She desperately tried to think of a way to get through to him. \u201cI love you, Thurston,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m afraid for you. Your hate is eating your heart. Think of your son. Ulric needs you. Forget this sinful pride and consider his future.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cMy son has no future with the Normans,\u201d he muttered. \u201cWhere is Justin? Is he still at the abbey?\u201d</p><p>The change in topics infuriated her. Did his son mean so little to him that he could so easily dismiss his duty to Ulric?</p><p>\u201cAnswer me, Nicholaa,\u201d he ordered. \u201cWhere is Justin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s here.\u201d</p><p>Nicholaa reached out to touch Thurston\u2019s arm. He pushed her hand away. \u201cPlease don\u2019t be like this,\u201d she whispered. \u201cJustin wanted to die, Thurston, but Royce wouldn\u2019t let him.\u201d</p><p>Her brother showed no reaction to her fervent words. \u201cWhere exactly is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s quartered with the other soldiers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, he must hate that humiliation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRoyce promised to help him.\u201d</p><p>Thurston shook his head. \u201cGive Justin a message for me. Tell him I haven\u2019t forgotten him. I\u2019ll be back . . . soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t realize she\u2019d screamed that denial. The sound bounced off the walls. Ulric flinched and started whimpering. Nicholaa rushed over to the crib and gently patted the baby\u2019s back. Ulric put his thumb in his mouth and closed his eyes.</p><p>\u201cGet away from him,\u201d Thurston ordered. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to touch my son.\u201d</p><p>His repulsion made her feel like a leper. She straightened away from the crib and turned to look at her brother.</p><p>Ulric might have gone back to sleep if Royce hadn\u2019t thrown the door open then. The hinges held, though just barely, and the door bounced against the wall twice before settling.</p><p>Nicholaa jumped. Ulric bellowed.</p><p>Royce filled the doorway. His legs were braced apart and his hands were fisted at his sides. It was a fighting stance, frightening, too, but it was the look in his eyes that terrified her.</p><p>Nicholaa was safe. Royce had just started up the stairs when he\u2019d heard her scream. He\u2019d started running then. His heart felt as though it had stopped. He pictured every foul possibility in his mind, and by the time he reached Ulric\u2019s chamber terror consumed him.</p><p>She was all right. He stared at his wife until that fact had registered.</p><p>Nicholaa deliberately kept the left side of her face hidden from her husband. She could tell from the cold look in his eyes that he was already furious. If he knew her brother had struck her, he might forget he was such a patient man and become as unreasonable as Thurston.</p><p>She was determined to prevent a disaster, but she didn\u2019t know whom to placate first. The baby was still fretting, even though a heavy silence had descended on the room. Ulric wasn\u2019t in jeopardy, however. He was safe. Royce might not be. Thurston suddenly took a step forward.</p><p>She stood in the center of the chamber between the two adversaries. Thurston and Royce were both staring at her now. She turned to look at one, then the other.</p><p>And then she ran across the room\u2014to her husband.</p><p>She threw herself into his arms. \u201cPlease be patient,\u201d she whispered. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>The distress in her voice cut through his rage. He gave her a quick squeeze, then shoved her behind his back and focused his full attention on his enemy.</p><p>Nicholaa\u2019s brother took another step toward him.</p><p>Royce leaned against the door frame. He folded his arms across his chest and stared at the Saxon. His casual attitude confused Thurston.</p><p>\u201cI expected you sooner, Thurston.\u201d</p><p>Royce made that comment in such a mild tone of voice that Nicholaa\u2019s brother was pushed a little more off center. He quickly recovered. \u201cDid Nicholaa tell you about the secret passageways?\u201d</p><p>Royce shook his head. He could feel his wife twisting the back of his tunic. He knew she was terrified, and he decided then not to prolong her pain. \u201cMake up your mind, Thurston,\u201d he ordered. His voice had gone hard.</p><p>Nicholaa tried to move to her husband\u2019s side. He shoved her back behind him. His gaze never left Thurston\u2019s face. \u201cThe choice is yours,\u201d he said. \u201cEither hand over your sword and give me your oath of fealty, or . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr what?\u201d Thurston demanded. \u201cOr die, Norman? I\u2019d kill you first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Nicholaa shouted. She felt someone\u2019s hands on her shoulders, turned, and saw Lawrence standing behind her.</p><p>\u201cBaron?\u201d Lawrence said.</p><p>Royce didn\u2019t take his attention away from Thurston. \u201cTake my wife to our chamber, Lawrence. Stay there with her.\u201d</p><p>The vassal had to pull Nicholaa\u2019s hands away from the back of Royce\u2019s tunic. \u201cNo!\u201d she cried out again. \u201cRoyce, the baby . . . Please let me take Ulric.\u201d</p><p>Now it was Thurston who shouted his denial. \u201cYou will leave my son where he is, Nicholaa. You\u2019ve chosen your path.\u201d</p><p>She let go of Royce then. Her shoulders were rigid when she backed out of the chamber.</p><p>Royce took a step forward. Lawrence reached around Nicholaa and pulled the door closed.</p><p>Thurston took another step toward Royce. \u201cYou should have allowed your soldiers inside this room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Thurston smiled. \u201cTo protect you. I\u2019ve got you all to myself now, you bastard. I\u2019m going to kill you.\u201d</p><p>Royce shook his head. \u201cNo, you\u2019re not going to kill me, Thurston. God\u2019s truth, I would like you to try.\u201d He paused to let out a sigh. \u201cThen I could kill you. I would derive a great deal of satisfaction from that, but my wife would be upset.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe betrayed her own family.\u201d</p><p>Royce raised an eyebrow. The effort of controlling his anger was becoming more difficult with each passing minute. \u201cWhen did Nicholaa become a traitor?\u201d he asked in a mild, thoroughly controlled voice. \u201cWas it before or after you abandoned her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbandoned her? You don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t I? You left her to survive on her own,\u201d Royce countered. \u201cThen you sent your son to her to add to her burden. She went to great lengths to keep Ulric safe, but you don\u2019t give a damn about any sacrifices she made, do you? Yes, you did abandon her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was needed in the north,\u201d Thurston muttered.</p><p>\u201cAh, yes, the north,\u201d Royce drawled out. \u201cIsn\u2019t that where you left your brother to die?\u201d</p><p>Thurston\u2019s face turned blotchy red. His hatred for the Norman consumed him. There wasn\u2019t any room in his mind for reason. \u201cI was told Justin was dead.\u201d</p><p>Something in his voice told Royce he wasn\u2019t telling the full truth. \u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cYou were told he was injured. When you heard what the injury was, you left him to die. That\u2019s what really happened, isn\u2019t it, Thurston? Justin was useless to you with only one hand to use in defense of your cause.\u201d</p><p>Thurston was too shaken by the information Royce had gathered to mask his reaction. The Norman was trying to make him feel responsible for his brother\u2019s plight. \u201cI continued to fight because I wanted to avenge my brother.\u201d</p><p>Royce was sickened. He\u2019d been able to put together only a few of the pieces of the puzzle. He had simply guessed about Justin being left for dead. Now Thurston\u2019s defense of his vile behavior told him he\u2019d been right. The bastard really had left his brother to die.</p><p>\u201cJustin knew, didn\u2019t he?\u201d Royce asked.</p><p>Thurston shrugged. \u201cHe understood. Has my brother also turned traitor?\u201d he asked. \u201cDid he tell you what happened? Or did Nicholaa get to him? In his weakened condition, did she somehow convince him he\u2019d be better off with the Normans?\u201d</p><p>Royce didn\u2019t respond to the questions. \u201cTell me this,\u201d he ordered. \u201cDo you condemn Nicholaa because she married me or because she\u2019s still alive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer own admission damned her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat admission?\u201d</p><p>She told me she chose you,\u201d Thurston muttered. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t coerced. She\u2019s letting you touch her, isn\u2019t she? God, my own sister in bed with a Norman. I wish now my arrow had pierced her heart.\u201d</p><p>Royce\u2019s control snapped. Thurston didn\u2019t have time to prepare. Royce moved too quickly. His fist slammed into the Saxon\u2019s face before Thurston could protect himself. The blow sent him reeling backwards into the fireplace. The mantel was torn free from the stone and fell to the floor as Thurston staggered to recover.</p><p>Royce had broken his nose. He wished it had been his neck. The baby\u2019s shrill screams helped Royce regain control of his temper. He glanced at the crib to make certain Ulric was still safe, then kicked open the panel built into the wooden wall.</p><p>\u201cI allowed you entrance, Thurston, because I wanted to talk to you. I want the name of the man who threatened my wife when she was in London. You\u2019re going to tell me who it was before you leave here.\u201d</p><p>Thurston shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t know what the hell you\u2019re talking about,\u201d he muttered. He wiped the blood away from his mouth with the back of his hand. \u201cWe don\u2019t have anyone in London . . . yet,\u201d he added. \u201cSoon, however, we\u2019ll take back what belongs to us. There won\u2019t be a Norman left\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpare me your political speeches,\u201d Royce interjected. \u201cI want the truth. Give me the Saxon\u2019s name, Thurston, or I\u2019ll beat it out of you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ulric\u2019s screams finally penetrated Thurston\u2019s rage. He walked over to the crib and picked up his son. He gently patted Ulric\u2019s back in a bid to calm him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m taking my son with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re not,\u201d Royce replied. \u201cYou may not give a damn about the baby\u2019s welfare, but Nicholaa and I do. It\u2019s cold and raining outside. You aren\u2019t taking Ulric out into such conditions. I\u2019ll strike a bargain with you,\u201d he added before Thurston could protest. \u201cWhen you\u2019ve found a safe place for your son, you can send someone to get him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll let him go?\u201d</p> <p>Royce nodded. \u201cI give you my word,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd now I want your word that you don\u2019t know who threatened my wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me what happened,\u201d Thurston asked.</p><p>Royce explained about the woman who\u2019d given Nicholaa the dagger with instructions to kill him. He could tell from Thurston\u2019s expression that he really didn\u2019t know about the incident.</p><p>\u201cThe Saxon barons who\u2019ve joined William certainly can\u2019t be trusted,\u201d Thurston said. \u201cWe never would have given any of those men such an assignment. Look to your own people for the man,\u201d he added. \u201cSaxons don\u2019t send women to do their work.\u201d</p><p>Royce believed him. He watched as Thurston put Ulric back in his crib. The Saxon was his enemy, but he was also Nicholaa\u2019s brother. Royce held his patience while father said good-bye to son.</p> <p>Thurston took a deep breath. Reason nagged him to admit that the Norman was right. Yet he found it galling to leave his son in the enemy\u2019s nest. He was going to have to trust the Norman to keep his word. That was even more galling.</p><p>\u201cUlric is going to my wife\u2019s family. When they arrive, you will give Ulric to them.\u201d</p><p>It was an order, not a request. Royce nodded. Then he qualified his decision. \u201cYour wife\u2019s family can come. If I\u2019m convinced Ulric will be safe with them, I\u2019ll let him go. Leave now, Thurston. You\u2019ve used up all the time I\u2019m going to give you.\u201d</p><p>Thurston looked down at his son, then walked over to the opening to the hidden staircase.</p><p>\u201cGet rid of the hate, Thurston. There\u2019s still time. It doesn\u2019t have to destroy you.\u201d</p><p>If Nicholaa\u2019s brother heard the warning, he didn\u2019t acknowledge it. He went down the steps without a backward glance.</p> <p>Royce shut the panel, then went over to the crib. Ulric was once again in a full rage. Royce lifted the baby and put him up against his shoulder the way he\u2019d seen Nicholaa do. He soothed the infant with whispered nonsense words he\u2019d heard his wife say, and it didn\u2019t take him any time at all to calm the tantrum.</p><p>Ingelram was waiting in the hallway. Royce ordered him to seal both the upper and the lower entrances to the passageway.</p><p>He noticed Alice standing by the steps and motioned her forward. \u201cThe baby\u2019s fine,\u201d he said when he saw her frown. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t harmed.\u201d</p><p>Ulric was wide awake now. He leaned away from Royce\u2019s shoulder and looked around him. Alice took the baby into her arms. \u201cYou soothed this little innocent,\u201d she said. \u201cNow you\u2019d best go soothe the other one.\u201d Alice blushed after making that suggestion. \u201cBegging your pardon, milord, for my boldness in speaking out like that, but I\u2019m concerned about my Nicholaa. She must surely be worn through with worry.\u201d</p><p>Royce nodded. \u201cAye, Alice, she surely must,\u201d he agreed. He patted Ulric\u2019s head, then turned and walked down the hallway. God\u2019s truth, he dreaded the task ahead of him, for he felt completely inadequate. He didn\u2019t have the faintest idea how to soothe Nicholaa.</p><p>She was standing by the window, looking out into the night when Royce walked into the chamber. She turned as soon as the door squeaked open. The look on her face made his heart ache. She was terrified. Royce let out a weary sigh. He assumed she thought he\u2019d already killed her brother and was waiting for his confirmation.</p><p>Lawrence stood by the hearth. He looked relieved to see his lord. \u201cLady Nicholaa\u2019s been worried,\u201d he called out, stating the obvious.</p><p>Royce continued to stare at his wife. \u201cshe needn\u2019t have worried. Her brother\u2019s still alive.\u201d</p> <p>Lawrence held his smile. He passed Royce on his way out of the room. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t worried about Thurston, Baron. She was worried about you.\u201d</p><p>The vassal pulled the door closed after making that telling statement.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t worried about you,\u201d Nicholaa said.</p><p>\u201cLawrence just said you were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe lied.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe never lies.\u201d</p><p>Tears blurred her vision. \u201cI should hate you, Royce. Yes, I should. Since the moment we met, the most horrible things have happened to me. Just look at me.\u201d She raised her hands. \u201cI\u2019ve got scars on both hands and another ugly one on my shoulder. It\u2019s your fault.\u201d</p><p>Nicholaa untied her belt and threw it on the floor. She kicked her shoes off next. \u201cIt\u2019s because you\u2019re a Norman. That\u2019s why everything\u2019s your fault.\u201d</p><p>She pulled the bliaut over her head, tossed it aside, then grasped the underskirt and tugged it off. \u201cWell?\u201d she demanded. \u201cHave you nothing to say in your defense?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t give him time to reply. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be riddled with scars if it hadn\u2019t been for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you were just prone to accidents.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t think she heard that remark. She was too busy reciting a litany of his flaws. He didn\u2019t smile, even when she blamed the thunderstorm on him. Royce let her rant and rave because he understood her desperate need to vent her anger and her fear. Aye, she was afraid to ask him about Thurston and Ulric.</p><p>Nicholaa had worn herself out by the time she\u2019d stripped down to her chemise. She stood facing him, head bowed and toes curled into the rushes. She looked so vulnerable.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready to listen to me?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t answer him. \u201cNicholaa, come here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She walked across the room to stand in front of him. \u201cI\u2019m never going to obey any of your commands again, Royce.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t think now would be a good time to point out that she\u2019d already done just that. He put his arms around her and tried to pull her up against him.</p><p>She slapped his hands away. \u201cI\u2019m never going to let you touch me again, either.\u201d</p><p>Royce wouldn\u2019t be denied. He forced her into his arms and hugged her tight. She was ready to be comforted. She collapsed against him, wrapped her arms around his waist, and wept without restraint. She was as loud, as undisciplined as little Ulric. Royce didn\u2019t try to calm her. He rested his chin on the top of her head and simply waited for her to finish.</p><p>The front of his tunic was soaked through by the time she was done. Nicholaa continued to hiccup against his chest for several more minutes. She was appalled by her conduct, but she hadn\u2019t been able to stop herself. She\u2019d been so overwhelmed with relief when Royce walked into the room and she\u2019d known for certain he was all right that she hadn\u2019t been able to control her emotions.</p><p>She was shivering with exhaustion and cold now. Royce felt her tremble and tightened his hold. \u201cYou should get under the covers before you freeze,\u201d he told her in a gruff whisper.</p><p>She ignored that suggestion. Nicholaa didn\u2019t understand why, but she needed him to hold her a little while longer. \u201cYou must think I\u2019m a baby,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m acting just like Ulric.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou might act like him, but you smell much better.\u201d</p><p>Nicholaa heard the amusement in his voice and realized he was teasing her. It was an odd reaction to the tragic events that had taken place. \u201cRoyce?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>A long minute passed before she could get her question out. \u201cAm I a traitor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>The force in his denial made her jump. \u201cDon\u2019t be angry with me. There\u2019s been too much anger tonight.\u201d</p><p>He held her chin and forced her to look up at him. \u201cI\u2019m not angry with you. The question made me angry, that\u2019s all. Thurston called you a traitor, didn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>Tears filled her eyes again. He was amazed she had any left. \u201cGod, Nicholaa, don\u2019t start crying again. It\u2019s over now. Thurston\u2019s safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew he\u2019d be safe,\u201d she cried out. \u201cI was worried about you.\u201d</p><p>Her vehemence surprised him. He didn\u2019t know if he should be insulted or not. \u201cHave you so little faith in my ability?\u201d</p><p>She jabbed his chest with her fingers. \u201cYour ability has nothing to do with this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>He looked thoroughly confused. \u201cNo, of course not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNicholaa, make sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThurston\u2019s my brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m aware of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know him better than you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe has many fine qualities.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare defend him to me.\u201d</p><p>She tried to turn away from him. Royce wouldn\u2019t let her. He forced her to look up at him again, then trailed the backs of his fingers down her cheek. \u201cHe did this, didn\u2019t he?\u201d he asked with a frown as fierce as the welt on her face. \u201cIf you tell me he didn\u2019t mean to strike you, I\u2019ll completely lose my patience.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you know Thurston struck me? Did he tell you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got a mark the size of a man\u2019s fist on your face, wife. That\u2019s how I know.\u201d</p><p>The fury in his voice made her shiver. \u201cYou won\u2019t lose your patience,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to explain to you. Thurston has a terrible temper. From the time he was a little boy, he would react before he would think. Papa was often in despair. He couldn\u2019t seem to teach Thurston restraint. My brother doesn\u2019t fight with honor, Royce. You do.\u201d</p><p>His smile was filled with tenderness. \u201cAnd how do you know how I fight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just know,\u201d she answered. \u201cYou have strong values. You\u2019ve learned to control your temper. You\u2019re extremely patient, too. On the journey to London, when I kept trying to get away from you and you kept catching me, you never once lost your temper.\u201d</p><p>Nicholaa was suddenly weary. She leaned against Royce again. \u201cThe war changed Thurston. He\u2019s full of hate now. He wouldn\u2019t have fought fairly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you believe I would?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>He kissed the top of her head, then lifted her into his arms and carried her to the bed. He was smiling inside. He didn\u2019t think she realized how she\u2019d just complimented him. His wife didn\u2019t understand what was fair and what wasn\u2019t. She obviously thought there were specific rules of conduct.</p><p>She had it all wrong, aye, but he wasn\u2019t going to explain that in a fight there weren\u2019t any rules. He was too pleased she\u2019d been concerned about him.</p><p>He set her on her feet next to the bed, then reached for the ribbon that held her chemise in place. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cTaking this off,\u201d he answered.</p><p>She tried to push his hands away. The straps of the undergarment slipped down her arms. \u201cI want it on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>The chemise fell to the floor. Nicholaa was too embarrassed by her nakedness to argue. She jerked the covers back and got into bed. Royce got only a glimpse of a blush before she cocooned herself under the quilts.</p><p>Her shyness amused him. Royce stripped out of his clothes, blew the candle out, and got into bed. He was pleased he didn\u2019t have to force her into his arms. The cold had done that for him. Nicholaa rolled up against his side to borrow some of his heat. He turned onto his side, wrapped his arms around her, trapped her legs between his own, and tucked her head under his chin. In minutes her shivers were gone.</p><p>He liked holding her in his arms. Her scent was light and appealing enough to drive a man to distraction. He wanted her. He let out a long sigh over that realization. It was too soon for her. He\u2019d hurt her last night, and she needed time for the tenderness to ease. She\u2019d been through purgatory tonight, too, and she needed time to recover from that upset as well. No, he shouldn\u2019t touch her.</p><p>His body wasn\u2019t paying any attention to the decisions his mind was making. He was already hard, hurting with his need to be inside her.</p><p>Hell, he had no more discipline than a goat when he was near her. Royce didn\u2019t understand his lack of control. She was just his wife. Nothing more. It was actually a little astonishing that she had this strong an effect on him.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do with Thurston?\u201d Nicholaa murmured into the darkness. Her whole body tensed in anticipation of his answer.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to do anything with him.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t understand. \u201cDid you lock him up? You\u2019re taking him to London, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>She was getting all worked up again. Royce squeezed her. \u201cI let him leave, Nicholaa.\u201d</p><p>She was stunned by that news. She didn\u2019t say anything for a long minute. Then she asked, \u201cWill you get into trouble because you let him go?\u201d</p><p>Her question was so ridiculous that he smiled. \u201cNo,\u201d he answered dryly.</p><p>\u201cI heard a commotion,\u201d she said. \u201cIt sounded as though the walls had caved in.\u201d</p><p>Nicholaa put her hand on his chest while she waited for him to explain. Her skin was so incredibly warm. Her fingers caressed him absentmindedly. He stopped her by putting his hand on hers. Another minute or so passed before she finally realized he wasn\u2019t going to say anything more. She guessed she\u2019d have to prod him. \u201cWas there a fight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what was that noise I heard?\u201d</p><p>He let out a long sigh. She wasn\u2019t going to give up. \u201cThe mantel fell to the floor.\u201d He sounded half asleep.</p><p>She leaned up to look at him and saw that his eyes were closed. \u201cIt just fell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo to sleep, Nicholaa. It\u2019s late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did you let Thurston leave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know why.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou let him leave because of me, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer her.</p><p>She kissed his chin. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>He opened his eyes and frowned at her. \u201cYou have nothing to thank me for,\u201d he said in a hard, thoroughly unlikable voice. \u201cI wanted to talk to Thurston, and that\u2019s what I did. I gave him an opportunity to surrender. He chose not to. You do understand what that means, don\u2019t you?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Nicholaa understood exactly what he meant, but she didn\u2019t want to talk about it. She started to turn away, but Royce grabbed the back of her neck. \u201cI will not allow you to deceive yourself. Thurston is going to resist until he dies. If he comes back here, I\u2019ll have to kill him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what about Ulric?\u201d she cried out. \u201cThurston will have to come back to see his son. You cannot mean to\u2014\u201d</p><p>Royce forced her head down by applying gentle pressure on the back of her neck. At the same time, he sealed her protest with a long kiss. He thought only to turn her attention, but her lips went all soft and willing on him and she tasted so incredibly good that he couldn\u2019t seem to stop. His mouth was hot, open, demanding. His tongue sank deep inside. She liked that. Her sexy little moan told him so. God, he wanted her. His tongue slid in and out again and again in an erotic rhythm that made him ache for more. He couldn\u2019t get close enough to her. His one hand held the nape of her neck while his other hand gripped her backside, and he pushed up against her heat with his arousal.</p><p>She was out of breath when he finally released her. He couldn\u2019t seem to catch his breath, either. He stared at her mouth. Her lips were red, swollen, enticing. He rubbed his thumb across her lower lip. He could feel his heart slamming inside his chest. He took several deep breaths to calm his thoughts.</p> <p>\u201cNow you will listen to me,\u201d he instructed in a husky voice. \u201cThurston won\u2019t come back. Your brother is sending someone from his wife\u2019s family to get Ulric. If these guardians prove acceptable to me, I\u2019ll let the baby go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She tried to push herself away from him.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He threw one leg over both of hers, trapping her. \u201cThurston is Ulric\u2019s father. Because he is a member of your family, I\u2019ve agreed. You will not argue with me, Nicholaa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust as I can\u2019t argue with you about Justin? You won\u2019t let me see my younger brother, and you won\u2019t even give me a good reason why I can\u2019t. You ask too much from me, Royce.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ask only what I know you can give,\u201d he countered. He kissed her brow. \u201cMy decision regarding Justin wasn\u2019t meant to hurt you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou are hurting me, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see. And do you believe I\u2019ve deliberately kept you away from Justin just to hurt you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she admitted with a sigh. \u201cYou would not be so petty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you considered the possibility that my decision had nothing to do with you at all? That perhaps I was thinking about Justin\u2019s welfare when I decided to keep you away from him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJustin loves me. He needs me now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the last person he needs now, wife.\u201d</p> <p>The anger in his voice confused her. \u201cI would never hurt Justin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, you would,\u201d he answered. He shook his head in aggravation. \u201cI specifically remember explaining that I would take on the responsibility of handling Justin when I went to the abbey to get you, Nicholaa. Didn\u2019t you listen to a word I said?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t remember,\u201d she muttered. \u201cI was upset at the time. I cannot believe you think I\u2019d deliberately hurt my own brother. I\u2019ve always looked out for Justin. He\u2019s the baby in the family, after all, and now that I\u2019m\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNicholaa, cease this tirade. Justin would mistake your concern for pity. Your compassion would humiliate him. He has enough to worry about now. I can\u2019t let you add to his burden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does he have to worry about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe.\u201d</p><p>Odd, but that arrogant statement soothed her. In her heart, she knew Royce was right about her brother, too. Justin was a proud man. It would be a humiliation for him to know she was watching him struggle. She wouldn\u2019t be able to hide her worry, either. He\u2019d see her concern and mistake it for pity.</p><p>Her husband was right about Thurston, too. By promising to allow Ulric to leave the household, he\u2019d robbed her brother of a true reason for returning. She said a prayer that Thurston would realize his good fortune. She knew Royce wouldn\u2019t give him a second chance to walk away.</p> <p>Nicholaa put her head on Royce\u2019s shoulder and closed her eyes. She felt inadequate now. She wasn\u2019t one to wallow in self-pity, but everything had turned upside down since the Normans started running things.</p><p>Royce nudged her face up and kissed her forehead, then the bridge of her nose. \u201cI want you, Nicholaa,\u201d he whispered with a weary sigh. He suddenly rolled over, cushioning her in his arms. She was flat on her back now with her husband covering her from head to foot. \u201cGo to sleep before I forget my good intentions.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to sleep. She wanted, nay, she needed him to touch her. And while he was making love to her, she would pretend that he truly did love her. She didn\u2019t even care that she would be lying to herself. The encounter with Thurston had been so painful, so heartbreaking. Royce could make her forget her torment, if only for a little while.</p><p>\u201cYou said you wanted me,\u201d she whispered in a voice filled with embarrassment. \u201cDon\u2019t change your mind, Royce. I want you, too.\u201d</p><p>He propped himself up on his elbows and smiled down at her. Her heart took notice of his devilish grin and started in pounding a wild beat. \u201cHow can you act so shy now, when you\u2019ve been draped over me the last half hour without\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur discussion made me forget I\u2014I wasn\u2019t wearing anything,\u201d she stammered. \u201cI\u2019ve remembered now. Kiss me, please. You\u2019ll make me forget to be shy. You did last night.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. The memory of their lovemaking last night made him ache to take her again. \u201cI\u2019d hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne kiss? Surely that wouldn\u2019t hurt me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t stop, Nicholaa. My discipline will vanish.\u201d</p><p>Her smile captivated him. \u201cI like it when your discipline vanishes.\u201d</p><p>She clasped his face in her hands and pulled him down to her. She kissed him, long and thoroughly. She didn\u2019t get a bit of cooperation from him, though, and finally had to bite his lower lip to get his attention. It was just a gentle nip, but it worked. Royce growled low in his throat before his mouth settled on hers possessively. The kiss quickly took over all other considerations. It was blatantly carnal. She was being ravished. It was a glorious feeling. Royce made her burn for more and more of his touch. She clung to him and let her love and her passion for this man take over her mind and her soul.</p><p>Her response to him shattered his control. He tried to slow down, to give her time to want him as much as he wanted her, but he\u2019d been hard for so long that it proved an impossible task.</p><p>He dragged his mouth away from hers, moved lower to kiss the valley between her breasts. He kissed the flat of her stomach, then moved lower still. She didn\u2019t have time to protest until he was kissing the very heat of her. Her gasp of astonishment turned into a moan of raw pleasure.</p><p>It was decadant, this intimacy he forced on her. And wonderful. She cried out for more.</p><p>She tasted so good to him. His tongue stroked the sensitive nub hidden within the slick folds of flesh, then pressed high inside her. She felt as if she\u2019d been hit by hot lightning. She arched up against him, demanding more of this sweet torture. \u201cRoyce, please,\u201d she whimpered, begging him to give her the ecstasy she knew was there, just beyond her reach.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t wait any longer. He knelt between her thighs, lifted her hips, and thrust deep into her. He stopped when he was fully embedded inside her. His voice was gritty with passion. \u201cAm I hurting you? Tell me if I\u2019m hurting you.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t capable of telling him anything. She arched up against him instead, digging her nails into his shoulders. The pressure building inside her was excruciating.</p><p>His hand moved down between their joined bodies. He stroked her with his fingers until the fire burning inside her was completely out of control. Her moans of pleasure told him she liked that. His mouth covered hers again. And then he began to move. He wasn\u2019t at all gentle. He withdrew and then sank deep into her again. She was so hot, so wet, so wonderfully tight. His thrust became more powerful, more consuming. And when he finally felt her tighten around him and he knew she was about to find her own release, he poured his seed into her with a low groan of surrender.</p><p>She found her fulfillment at the very same moment. The splendor overwhelmed her. She held on to her husband and let the waves of ecstasy wash over her. She wasn\u2019t afraid, even when she felt as though her mind had become separated from her body. She welcomed the glorious feeling, for she knew that Royce would keep her safe.</p><p>When the last tremor faded, she fell back against the blankets. She thought she\u2019d died.</p><p>He thought he\u2019d killed her. He collapsed on top of her with a grant of satisfaction. His sweet wife had taken all his strength. She\u2019d taken away his willpower, too, for he couldn\u2019t seem to make himself move away from her.</p><p>It took him several minutes to recover. Then he started worrying. \u201cNicholaa, are you all right?\u201d</p><p>The concern in his voice warmed her heart. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He could hear the blush in her voice. God help him, he started laughing. The woman had been wild just a few minutes before, yet now was obviously embarrassed.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you amused?\u201d she asked shyly. \u201cAre you laughing at me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou please me,\u201d he told her. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m laughing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRoyce?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t going to be all right, is it?\u201d</p><p>The fear in her voice sobered him. \u201cI\u2019ll take care of you, Nicholaa,\u201d he said, giving her a roundabout answer.</p><p>\u201cUlric has to leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you believe Thurston won\u2019t come back once his son is gone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my hope,\u201d he admitted.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll come for Justin.\u201d</p><p>His sigh was long. He\u2019d hoped she wouldn\u2019t figure that out so soon. \u201cJustin won\u2019t leave with Thurston. Go to sleep, Nicholaa. It\u2019s my duty to protect this family.\u201d</p><p>Yes, it was his duty, and he wouldn\u2019t turn his back on what he felt was right. But that duty had been thrust upon him when she chose him for her husband.</p><p>She wished with all her heart it wasn\u2019t just duty that drove him. Nicholaa closed her eyes and tried not to weep. She had Royce\u2019s protection, aye.</p><p>But she wanted his love.</p><p>Chapter Thirteen</p><p>Royce was standing near the buttery when Nicholaa walked into the great hall with little Ulric settled on her hip. An older soldier Nicholaa didn\u2019t recognize stood next to her husband, speaking in a low voice. Both men were staring at the floor where the table had stood before Royce ordered it moved to the center of the room.</p><p>She decided to interrupt. She walked over to greet her husband. Ulric was babbling out his new sounds. When Royce turned to her, the baby reached out for him.</p><p>He took the baby, settled him up against his shoulder, then looked at his wife. She folded her hands in front of her and smiled at him.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, husband.\u201d She started to stretch up and kiss him, then thought better of it. There was a stranger with her husband. She didn\u2019t want to embarrass him.</p><p>Royce didn\u2019t seem to mind an audience, though. He grasped her chin, tilted her face up, and brushed his mouth over hers. Then he pulled her up against his side and turned back to the soldier.</p><p>\u201cYou were explaining, Thomas?\u201d he prodded.</p><p>\u201cI was explaining that it\u2019s a miracle, my lord, that the floor hasn\u2019t caved in yet. You can see how rotten the wood is here,\u201d he added with a sweep of his hand.</p><p>Royce nodded. \u201cFinish your inspection,\u201d he ordered. \u201cYou will join us for dinner tonight. I\u2019ll hear your evaluation then.\u201d</p><p>The dark-haired soldier bowed to his baron but kept his gaze on Nicholaa. She nudged her husband. He finally remembered his manners and introduced Thomas to his wife. Nicholaa smiled at the soldier. Royce started counting. It only took Thomas the count of five to turn bright red. It was a damned odd affliction, but one from which all of his soldiers, old and young alike, seemed to suffer. All Nicholaa had to do was give a man her full attention, and he was turned from a mighty soldier to a soggy piece of milk toast.</p><p>It was shameful. Thomas was now tugging at his collar. He acted as though a heat wave had just poured over him.</p><p>Royce glared Thomas into moving, then shook his head in exasperation when the soldier tried to walk out of the hall without taking his gaze away from Nicholaa. He tripped over his own feet of course, then righted himself like an awkward pup and rushed out of the hall.</p><p>Nicholaa looked up at Royce. \u201cThe soldiers seem nervous around you,\u201d she remarked. \u201cI believe you intimidate them.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. She decided he thought she\u2019d given him a compliment. She was about to explain she hadn\u2019t done any such thing when he turned her attention. \u201cI don\u2019t intimidate you, do I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlmost as much as you intimidate Ulric,\u201d she answered. She edged around her husband to look up at the baby and saw he was sucking on the latches of Royce\u2019s tunic.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready to tell me your plans for today?\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cMy plans?\u201d She didn\u2019t seem to know what he was talking about.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll hear your list of duties,\u201d he patiently explained.</p><p>\u201cWhat list of duties?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNicholaa, didn\u2019t you listen to what I said last night? I distinctly remember telling you that each and every morning you would outline for me your plans for the day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I listened,\u201d she rushed out. \u201cDon\u2019t frown so. I do remember. I just don\u2019t have any duties to tell you about. You\u2019ve taken them all away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExplain yourself,\u201d he ordered.</p><p>She didn\u2019t care for his curt tone of voice, but she didn\u2019t remark on it. \u201cIf Justin and Ulric didn\u2019t need me so much, I\u2019d have no reason to stay here,\u201d she announced. \u201cYou certainly don\u2019t need me.\u201d</p><p>Nicholaa hoped for a denial. He didn\u2019t give it to her. \u201cYou\u2019ve still to explain why you don\u2019t have duties,\u201d he reminded her.</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cI thought I was supposed to run my household. However, you\u2019ve taken over that duty. You gave the staff their orders yesterday, and I assume you will continue to do so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was an unusual circumstance,\u201d he replied. \u201cYou slept the morning away, remember?\u201d</p><p>She did remember. She turned her gaze to the floor. Her husband had kept her up most of the night making love to her. She remembered that, too. \u201cI was very weary,\u201d she said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her cheeks turned pink. He couldn\u2019t imagine what was going through her mind now. He was a patient man, he reminded himself. \u201cThat isn\u2019t the point,\u201d he told her. \u201cIn your absence, I made certain decisions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuch as moving the table to the center of the room?\u201d</p><p>When Royce nodded, she said, \u201cBut I changed that order, and others, too, and you were very displeased.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p> <p>She shook her head. \u201cRoyce, I don\u2019t understand what you want from me. I\u2019m trying to get along with you, but you confuse me with contradictory requests. Do you or do you not want me to run this household?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I want you to run this household.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I never want you to countermand an order I\u2019ve given. Now you do understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you mean to say that you were upset because I changed your orders?\u201d she asked. \u201cYou called the servants together just because . . .\u201d She stopped when he nodded.</p> <p>\u201cIt was deliberate, wasn\u2019t it, Nicholaa?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was deliberate?\u201d she asked, knowing full well what he meant.</p><p>\u201cChanging my orders,\u201d he answered. \u201cWell?\u201d he prodded when she didn\u2019t immediately answer him.</p><p>Her shoulders slumped. The man was cunning all right. \u201cIt was deliberate,\u201d she admitted.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause this is my household and my staff,\u201d she returned. \u201cAnd I took exception to you interfering.\u201d</p> <p>Nicholaa walked across the room, then turned around to look at him again. \u201cI don\u2019t interfere with your duties, and I don\u2019t believe you should interfere with mine.\u201d</p><p>He took a step toward her. \u201cYou\u2019ve got it backwards, woman. This isn\u2019t your household, and it isn\u2019t your staff. Both belong to me now. Furthermore,\u201d he added before she could argue, \u201cyou will never take that tone of voice with me again.\u201d</p><p>He hadn\u2019t raised his voice, but Nicholaa still felt as though he\u2019d roared every word. Even Ulric noticed. He stopped sucking on the latches and stared in wide-eyed surprise at Royce.</p><p>Alice walked into the hall then, and Nicholaa thought she\u2019d been given a blessed reprieve from her husband\u2019s sudden anger. She was wrong, though. Royce motioned the servant over, handed Ulric to her, and ordered her to take the baby abovestairs.</p><p>He waited until Alice left before turning his attention back to his wife. The look on his face was frightening. \u201cSit down.\u201d</p><p>She folded her arms in front of her. She wasn\u2019t going to back down this time. The man needed to understand she wasn\u2019t one of his servants. She was his wife, and he would treat her as such. She couldn\u2019t quite look him in the eyes, but she managed to keep her voice from shaking when she said, \u201cIf you would like me to sit down, kindly ask me to. I\u2019m not one of your soldiers to be ordered about. I\u2019m your wife. You do understand the difference, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>He wondered if the soldiers training in the lower bailey had heard her, since Nicholaa had ended her speech in a near shout. She really needed to do something about her temper, he thought to himself. He was still pleased with her, though. She was afraid, yes, but she still held her ground and stood up to him.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t about to back down, either, of course. \u201cSit down,\u201d he ordered again.</p> <p>The bite was missing from his order this time. Nicholaa let out a loud sigh as she took her seat. The look on her husband\u2019s face told her they would spend the rest of the day arguing. He was so stubborn. He wouldn\u2019t give up. She was going to have to let him have his way this one last time.</p><p>Nicholaa rested her elbow on the table, propped her head in her hand, and looked up at him. \u201cI\u2019m ready,\u201d she announced resignedly.</p><p>\u201cReady for what?\u201d he asked, surprised by her sudden acceptance. He\u2019d expected a little more bluster before she conceded.</p><p>\u201cYour lecture.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t lecture.\u201d</p><p>She started to stand up.</p><p>He clasped his hands behind his back. \u201cHowever . . .\u201d he began.</p><p>She sat down again.</p><p>\u201cThere are a few things I would like to explain to you once again, wife. You\u2019ve still to understand how this marriage works.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you do understand?\u201d</p><p>He frowned at her for interrupting him. \u201cYes, I do understand,\u201d he announced. \u201cI\u2019ve given this matter much consideration.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid I have a place in this consideration?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d he answered. \u201cYou\u2019re my wife.\u201d</p><p>She guessed she should be pleased he\u2019d remembered that fact. \u201cAnd?\u201d she prodded.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my duty to protect you. You do agree with that, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cAnd now we come to your primary duty,\u201d he continued.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d She found herself eager to hear what he was going to say. She suspected that it was going to be outrageous.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s very simple to understand, Nicholaa,\u201d Royce said. \u201cIt\u2019s your duty to give me peace. Now, if you would only do your duty\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t give you peace?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cThere are specific rules of conduct, wife, and I would like you to understand them so we can live in peace together.\u201d</p><p>She started drumming her fingertips on the table. Royce hadn\u2019t said a word about love or caring . . . yet. She tried not to be disheartened. \u201cWhat are these rules?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He was pleased with her interest. It had been a long time coming, he thought to himself. His patience was being rewarded, though, for his wife was now ready to listen. \u201cOne,\u201d he began, \u201cyou will never raise your voice to me. Two, you will obey my orders without question. Three, you will not weep again. Four, you will not allow spontaneous actions to rule your decisions. Five\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d she called out. \u201cPlease go back to the third rule. Did you just tell me I cannot weep?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>He was irritated because she looked so incredulous. \u201cI don\u2019t like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>It was his turn to look incredulous. \u201cYou can\u2019t be serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m very serious,\u201d she answered. \u201cI like to weep. Not all the time, of course, just sometimes. I feel better afterward.\u201d</p><p>Royce stared down at Nicholaa for a long minute before he came to the conclusion she wasn\u2019t jesting. The daft woman really meant what she\u2019d said. He shook his head. He didn\u2019t have the faintest idea how to respond to such an illogical remark.</p><p>Nicholaa tried to make him understand. \u201cSometimes, when the frustrations build inside me and everything gets so cluttered up inside my mind, crying makes me feel better. Now do you see?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>She held her patience. By God, he would understand, she vowed. She didn\u2019t know why this foolish conversation mattered so much to her, but it did. She decided to take a different approach. \u201cHaven\u2019t you ever become so angry you wanted to hit someone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t weep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, of course not,\u201d she returned, trying not to smile. Her husband sounded incensed at the mere possibility. \u201cStill, when the anger builds inside you, when you become so furious you want to hit\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I hit,\u201d he interrupted. He paused to give her a fierce frown. \u201cI sure as hell don\u2019t weep about it, woman.\u201d</p><p>She gave up. The man was too obtuse to ever understand.</p><p>\u201cNicholaa, give me your promise you won\u2019t weep again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it displeases me to see you unhappy.\u201d</p><p>Some of her irritation vanished. \u201cThen you want me to be happy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d he answered. \u201cWe\u2019ll get along much better if you\u2019re happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about love?\u201d she asked. \u201cDo you want me to love you?\u201d She held her breath while she waited for his answer.</p><p>He shrugged.</p><p>She wanted to kill him. \u201cYes or no?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>He stared at her. \u201cThe question isn\u2019t relevant to our discussion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove isn\u2019t relevant to marriage?\u201d she said, looking astonished.</p><p>Royce didn\u2019t know how to answer her. He suddenly felt very unsure of himself.</p><p>Nicholaa folded her hands on the table. She decided to tell him the truth, to let him know exactly what was in her heart. It was a little terrifying to bare her soul to Royce. She didn\u2019t know what she\u2019d do if he rejected her. It was a gamble, for she hoped and prayed he would tell her what was in his heart as well.</p><p>\u201cI told Thurston I loved you.\u201d She gazed at her hands and waited for his reaction. God, she felt vulnerable.</p><p>\u201cYou did?\u201d He sounded surprised.</p><p>She nodded. \u201cYes, I did,\u201d she announced in a stronger voice.</p><p>He let out a sigh.</p><p>She looked up to see if he was smiling or scowling. His expression didn\u2019t tell her much, though. He looked as though she\u2019d just given him the dinner menu. \u201cWhat do you think of that, Royce?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI understand your reason for telling your brother you loved me,\u201d he answered. He nodded to emphasize that fact. \u201cYou wanted to gain his cooperation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis cooperation?\u201d</p><p>He nodded again. He had it all figured out. He sounded so damn logical. She wished she could give him a swift kick in his logical backside.</p><p>\u201cYou wanted Thurston to accept me. That\u2019s why you told him you loved me.\u201d</p><p>He thought she\u2019d lied to her brother. Nicholaa\u2019s eyes widened. She didn\u2019t know if she should correct him or not. The conversation wasn\u2019t going at all well.</p><p>\u201cI wanted Thurston to believe I was happy with you,\u201d she said. \u201cHe asked me to leave with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd so you told him you loved me and wanted to stay with me, but you were thinking of Ulric and Justin, weren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was that,\u201d she muttered. She began to drum her fingers on the table again. \u201cI was trying to convince him I\u2019d chosen you for my husband.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did choose me.\u201d</p><p>They were going around in circles. Royce started pacing again. \u201cIt made good sense, wife. You thought to ease your brother\u2019s mind about your circumstances. Instead of easing his mind, however, you made him furious. Aye, that\u2019s why Thurston went into a rage and called you traitor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA very logical assumption,\u201d she announced. \u201cYou\u2019ve figured it all out, haven\u2019t you? But you\u2019ve still to give me a satisfactory answer. Do you want me to love you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know about such things,\u201d he admitted, his voice hesitant. \u201cDo you want to love me?\u201d</p><p>She wanted to throttle him. It was apparent he didn\u2019t have any idea how important this discussion was to her. He wouldn\u2019t act so blase if he did. She couldn\u2019t decide whether to weep or throw something. She thought she just might do both.</p><p>\u201cIs that all you can say to me?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Her heart started pounding. Perhaps now he\u2019d tell her he wanted her love. The past few minutes had persuaded her to forget her hope that he\u2019d profess his own feelings. She knew Royce didn\u2019t love her yet, but perhaps his attitude was softening. In time, with care and gentle nagging, he might decide to love her just a little.</p><p>Royce wasn\u2019t able to hide his irritation with his wife. Nicholaa was staring off into space, looking bemused. It was obvious she was daydreaming.</p><p>\u201cYou will pay attention to what I say.\u201d</p><p>She smiled up at him. \u201cYes, husband?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere was I?\u201d he asked, thoroughly distracted.</p><p>\u201cI asked you if you wanted me to love you, and you said you didn\u2019t know about such things. Then I asked you if you didn\u2019t have more to say to me, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, now I remember,\u201d he said. He turned around and started pacing again. He was determined to turn the conversation away from the subject of love. God\u2019s truth, he felt completely inadequate discussing that topic. \u201cNicholaa, I know this is difficult for you, but if you\u2019ll only consider . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d she asked breathlessly. Now he would tell her what she so desperately wanted to hear. The way he hesitated was clue enough for Nicholaa. He seemed agitated, too. That was another good sign, she thought to herself.</p><p>He cleared his throat and turned to look at her.</p><p>She straightened up in her chair and waited.</p><p>\u201cMarriage is like a map,\u201d he said.</p><p>She bounded to her feet. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarriage is like a map, Nicholaa.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cDo you know what I think?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>Lord, she was furious. He was astonished by that reaction. What in God\u2019s name was the matter with her? \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI think you should have married one of your soldiers.\u201d</p><p>Nicholaa darted around the table and ran out of the great hall. If she hurried, she might reach her room before she started screaming.</p><p>Lawrence walked into the hall as Nicholaa rushed out, and the two of them nearly collided. The vassal grabbed her shoulders to steady her. He noticed the tears in her eyes immediately. \u201cIs something wrong, my lady?\u201d he asked. \u201cHas something upset you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot something,\u201d she muttered. \u201cSomeone.\u201d She turned to glare at Royce and jumped when she found him standing right behind her. He\u2019d sneaked up on her without making a sound.</p><p>Royce stared at Nicholaa as he spoke to his vassal. \u201cWas there something you wanted, Lawrence?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Baron.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen take your hands off my wife and tell me,\u201d Royce ordered.</p><p>Lawrence realized he was still holding Nicholaa\u2019s shoulders and immediately let go. \u201cYou asked to be informed when a change occurred,\u201d he announced. He gave Nicholaa a quick glance, then looked at Royce again. \u201cIt\u2019s happened. He\u2019s gone into a rage.\u201d Lawrence smiled.</p><p>Royce nodded. \u201cIt seems to run in the family,\u201d he drawled, sending a meaningful frown in Nicholaa\u2019s direction. \u201cThough in this instance, I\u2019m pleased. It\u2019s about time.\u201d</p><p>Lawrence nodded. He fell into step next to his baron and started for the outside doors. \u201cAbout time indeed,\u201d the vassal agreed.</p><p>Nicholaa\u2019s own feelings were pushed aside by the announcement. She knew Lawrence was talking about her brother. \u201cIt\u2019s Justin, isn\u2019t it? He\u2019s the one who\u2019s gone into a rage.\u201d She rushed after her husband. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Royce suddenly stopped. Nicholaa didn\u2019t. She bumped into him. He turned around and grabbed hold of her. His grip was almost painful. \u201cYou will not interfere.\u201d</p><p>She had her answer then. It was definitely Justin.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t interfere,\u201d she promised. \u201cJust tell me why you\u2019re pleased that he\u2019s gone into a rage. I would like to be pleased, too.\u201d</p><p>She hadn\u2019t demanded an explanation; she\u2019d merely asked for one. Royce immediately answered. \u201cWe\u2019ve been waiting for your brother to show some kind of reaction to his situation. Until now we\u2019ve had to force him to eat, to drink, to move. Justin\u2019s been trying to hide from life, Nicholaa. Now he\u2019s finally opening his eyes. This sudden rage is a good beginning, and that\u2019s why I\u2019m pleased.\u201d</p> <p>She hadn\u2019t realized she\u2019d grabbed his tunic until he pulled her hands away. \u201cWhat will you do now?\u201d</p><p>His smile made some of her fear dissipate. \u201cI\u2019m going to help him re-direct his anger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy giving him a target.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA target?\u201d she repeated, still not understanding.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m going to direct his anger toward me,\u201d Royce explained. \u201cGod willing, by the end of the day your brother\u2019s rage will be fully centered on me. He\u2019ll want to live for the sole purpose of killing me.\u201d</p><p>As soon as the words were out of his mouth, he regretted giving her that bit of information. She looked appalled.</p><p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t you give him some other target?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>She sighed. She knew he was right. As the leader of his men, he alone was responsible for the welfare of each and every soldier. She realized she\u2019d actually insulted him by suggesting he give the duty to someone else. He\u2019d taken on the burden of helping Justin and she shouldn\u2019t try to undermine his decision.</p><p>\u201cI trust you,\u201d she announced. She smiled then. \u201cI won\u2019t worry about you, either. You wouldn\u2019t sound so cheerful if you weren\u2019t prepared,\u201d she explained. \u201cYou\u2019ll do what you think is best for Justin.\u201d</p> <p>She stood on tiptoe and kissed him. \u201cI\u2019ve detained you long enough. Thank you for taking the time to explain it all to me.\u201d She smiled at Lawrence, then turned around and walked toward the back of the keep.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good to see a wife who has faith in her husband,\u201d Lawrence remarked as he followed Royce outside.</p><p>His baron smiled. \u201cLawrence, wait here,\u201d he ordered, \u201cand catch her when she comes around the corner. I won\u2019t have her interference. Keep her occupied inside.\u201d</p><p>The vassal looked astonished. \u201cDo you mean to say\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNicholaa\u2019s probably on her way out one of the back doors right now. She has faith in me, yes, but she\u2019ll still want to see what\u2019s going on. Then she won\u2019t be able to stop herself from interfering.\u201d</p><p>Lawrence smiled. \u201cYou understand her very well, Baron.\u201d</p><p>Royce shook his head. His voice was bleak when he said, \u201cIn this instance I understand her. She\u2019ll do exactly what you or I would do if Justin were our brother. As for thoroughly understanding my wife, I must confess I\u2019m finding out she\u2019s far more complex than I first realized. \u2019Tis the truth that the smallest remarks set her temper flaring.\u201d</p><p>He sounded so bewildered that Lawrence nodded sympathetically. Since he\u2019d never been married, he didn\u2019t know enough about wives to offer any advice.</p> <p>Royce wasn\u2019t expecting a response, however. He nodded to Lawrence and then walked away. He hadn\u2019t even reached the bottom of the first slope when Justin\u2019s bellows reached him.</p><p>He found Nicholaa\u2019s younger brother in the center of a circle of soldiers. One of the men had a bloody nose. Royce assumed Justin was responsible for the injury. He couldn\u2019t have been more pleased. He dismissed the soldiers with a curt order, motioned for Ingelram to stay nearby, and then faced Justin alone.</p><p>Nicholaa\u2019s brother looked like hell. His hair hung around his shoulders in clumps of tangles. It was brown from dirt, and as filthy looking as the rest of him. Justin was dressed in a foul-smelling blue tunic and baggy brown pants. His eyes were blazing with hatred. It was a dramatic change from the flat, glazed look Royce had seen there before.</p><p>Royce folded his arms across his chest and stared at Justin. Then he calmly explained the rules of conduct for all soldiers in his ranks. He went right on speaking in a mild, patient voice, even when Justin let out a roar of outrage and lunged at him. Royce easily sidestepped the attack and tripped Justin with his foot.</p><p>The boy went sprawling face down. He didn\u2019t give up, though. Again and again he attacked. Royce effortlessly ducked each blow while he continued to outline his training program. Justin used his fist, his head, and his shoulders to try to knock Royce down. He spewed foul words all the while. When he called Royce his bastard captor, he found himself flat on his back on the ground. Dust billowed up around him. As soon as the air cleared, he saw Royce looming over him. Justin tried to regain his feet, but Royce held him down by putting one booted foot on his chest.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m neither your captor nor a bastard,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m your baron, Justin, and you\u2019re my faithful vassal.\u201d</p><p>Justin closed his eyes and gasped for breath. Royce moved back and continued his list of rules while Justin staggered to his feet. He gathered the last of his strength and spat in Royce\u2019s face. He missed his mark by a good yard, but the insult was still there. Royce\u2019s reaction was instantaneous. He gave Justin a well deserved kick in his backside and sent him sprawling on the ground again. There wasn\u2019t a bit of anger in the punishment. Royce was merely giving the boy his first lesson in survival.</p><p>He\u2019d gained Justin\u2019s full attention, too. For all his rage, he noticed Royce didn\u2019t even look mildly irritated. Justin didn\u2019t understand, but inside he was so scared he couldn\u2019t think. It seemed that no matter how much he provoked the baron, he couldn\u2019t push him into killing him. That realization terrified Justin, for it meant he\u2019d have to go on living.</p><p>\u201cAll the things I\u2019ve just explained to you come down to a few basic rules,\u201d Royce continued. \u201cYou will not embarrass your unit. You will train to your fullest capacity, you will treat others with respect, and you will never, ever show cowardice, for to do any of those things would embarrass this unit. You will learn to depend upon others as they will learn to depend upon you. It\u2019s very simple, Justin.\u201d</p><p>Royce knew full well the boy didn\u2019t understand. Justin looked like a caged animal who\u2019d just escaped his prison. There was a wild, hunted look about him.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want from me?\u201d Justin suddenly roared.</p><p>Royce put his booted foot on Justin\u2019s chest again. \u201cAll you can give,\u201d he announced. \u201cAnd then more, Justin. And by God, you\u2019ll give me exactly what I want.\u201d</p><p>He moved away from Justin then and motioned Ingelram over to his side. \u201cGo with Justin,\u201d he commanded. \u201cShow him where the uniforms are kept.\u201d He glanced down at Justin. \u201cYou will wash the filth away now. Tomorrow your training with the others begins.\u201d</p><p>Royce deliberately turned his back on Justin when he walked away. Ingelram reached down to offer his hand in helping the boy up. Justin shoved his hand away. When he regained his feet, Ingelram moved to one side and waited. He didn\u2019t call out a warning, for he knew his baron would expect a sneak attack. Justin rushed after Royce and tried to tackle him from behind. He found himself grasping air at the last second and ended up on his knees.</p><p>Royce turned around and once again used his foot to shove Justin onto his back on the ground. \u201cIf you want the privilege of fighting me, you\u2019ll have to earn it. You\u2019re going to have to get a hell of a lot stronger first, boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoy!\u201d Justin roared.</p><p>Royce nodded. \u201cYou aren\u2019t even worthy to be called Dove yet,\u201d he said. \u201cIngelram? I just ordered you to show him to the uniforms. See it carried through.\u201d</p><p>The vassal nodded to Royce, then again offered his hand to Justin. Nicholaa\u2019s brother instinctively reached up. He was pulled to his feet before he realized he\u2019d accepted assistance. He was too overwhelmed with exhaustion to think coherently. His shoulders were slumped in defeat. He would fight them all tomorrow, he decided, when he was rested, when he was stronger.</p><p>He fell into step beside the young Norman soldier.</p><p>\u201cI was called \u2018boy\u2019 once or twice when I first entered the baron\u2019s ranks,\u201d Ingelram said. \u201cThen I officially became a Dove. You see, Justin, we new recruits are called Doves by the older, more experienced knights. It\u2019s meant as an insult, of course, but they were all once Doves, too, and so we take it in stride. We compete against them every chance we\u2019re given, too. When you get rid of your anger, you\u2019ll realize how fortunate you are to have been allowed to join the most elite unit in all of England and Normandy combined.\u201d</p><p>Ingelram had spoken earnestly, but Justin scoffed. \u201cI\u2019ll be leaving soon,\u201d he muttered. \u201cI have no need to hear this ignorant explanation.\u201d</p><p>Ingelram shook his head. \u201cYou can\u2019t leave without permission,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would embarrass our unit. You have to stay here.\u201d</p><p>He turned Justin\u2019s attention then when he said, \u201cDid you notice that each time you attacked the baron, he retaliated without using his hands?\u201d</p><p>Justin hadn\u2019t noticed. His eyes widened when he realized Ingelram had spoken the truth. He refused to answer Ingelram, though. He scowled instead.</p><p>Ingelram wasn\u2019t daunted. \u201cBaron Royce used his feet. You didn\u2019t.\u201d He slapped Justin on his shoulder. \u201cYou\u2019ve just had your first lesson in defense.\u201d He laughed after making that statement, then added, \u201cGod, Justin, you smell as rank as a well-used whore.\u201d</p><p>Justin ignored that comment. He vowed there wouldn\u2019t be any more lessons to endure. He was going to leave the holding tonight, after the other soldiers had fallen asleep.</p><p>He was so ravenous that evening he ate a full dinner. He was forced to sit with the other soldiers and listen to their conversations. No one tried to draw him into discussion, but the men didn\u2019t actually exclude him, either.</p><p>His pallet was positioned between Ingelram\u2019s and Gerald\u2019s. Justin\u2019s last thought before exhaustion overtook him was that he would rest for just a few minutes, then get up, gather his meager possessions, and leave.</p><p>He awakened in the dead of night, but he didn\u2019t even make it to the door. A soldier Justin had never seen before blocked his path. He calmly explained that his name was Bryan, that he was also a new recruit, and that he only wanted to remind Justin he couldn\u2019t leave without permission.</p><p>Bryan had dark curly hair and brown eyes. He was shorter than Justin by an inch or two, but his muscles made him an intimidating barrier. \u201cI\u2019ve been reminded,\u201d Justin muttered. \u201cNow get out of my way.\u201d</p><p>Bryan was suddenly joined by three more soldiers. They were as sleepy-eyed as Bryan, and just as determined to keep Justin inside.</p><p>\u201cWhy the hell do you care if I leave or not?\u201d Justin raged.</p><p>\u201cIt would embarrass our unit if one of us left,\u201d Ingelram called out from his bed. \u201cGo back to sleep, Justin.\u201d</p><p>He knew he couldn\u2019t win. There were too many of them, and he was too weary. He grudgingly returned to his bed. No one jeered at him. That surprised Justin. It infuriated him, too. He wanted a reason to hate the soldiers, and they weren\u2019t giving him any.</p><p>Several minutes passed before everyone settled back down for the remainder of the night. Ingelram was just drifting off to sleep when he felt Justin nudge him.</p><p>\u201cWhat happens when someone embarrasses your unit?\u201d Justin whispered. He was already damning himself for asking that question. He certainly didn\u2019t want to give Ingelram the notion he cared. He was merely curious, that was all.</p><p>\u201cBelieve me, Justin,\u201d Ingelram whispered back, \u201cyou don\u2019t want to know.\u201d</p><p>He did want to know, though, and couldn\u2019t stop himself from prodding Ingelram again. \u201cIs the punishment severe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it death, then?\u201d</p><p>Ingelram snorted. \u201cNo,\u201d he answered. \u201cDeath\u2019s easy, Justin. The punishment isn\u2019t. Go to sleep now. Tomorrow will be a difficult day for all of us.\u201d</p><p>Justin didn\u2019t take that advice. There was too much to think about.</p><p>Nicholaa was also wide awake. Little Ulric was giving her fits. The baby was terribly fretful tonight. Since he wasn\u2019t feverish, she decided he was crying over another tooth trying to poke through his tender gums.</p><p>He was content only when he was being held and walked. Nicholaa felt it was her responsibility to take care of the little one at night. The servants needed their rest. She dismissed the staff and then paced the chamber with Ulric in her arms.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t have slept anyway. Her mind was in such a state of confusion. She wished now she hadn\u2019t witnessed the confrontation between Royce and her brother, Justin. Oh, God, how she wished she hadn\u2019t seen that horror.</p><p>Royce had been so cruel. If she hadn\u2019t seen what was happening, she wouldn\u2019t have believed it possible. To kick an injured, defenseless boy . . . No, she wouldn\u2019t have believed her husband capable of such despicable conduct.</p><p>She would have wept over her brother\u2019s humiliation if Lawrence hadn\u2019t spotted her on the walkway and rushed up to join her. He\u2019d tried to coax her into leaving, but it was already too late.</p><p>Nicholaa couldn\u2019t face Royce at dinner. She stayed abovestairs, taking care of her nephew. Royce didn\u2019t send anyone to fetch her. He probably wouldn\u2019t even notice she wasn\u2019t sitting beside him at the table. No, her husband was very likely planning his next attack on her brother.</p><p>Royce did miss Nicholaa, of course. Supper was served an hour later than usual to accommodate Royce\u2019s schedule, and Alice thought her mistress had already gone to bed. \u201cShe looked very sleepy,\u201d she remarked.</p><p>Lawrence waited until the servant had returned to the buttery, then leaned over to offer his own explanation. \u201cI\u2019ve been trying to catch you alone to tell you what happened today,\u201d he began. \u201cNicholaa is probably avoiding you, Baron. I would wager that\u2019s why she\u2019s upstairs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would she avoid me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe witnessed your confrontation with Justin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell. How in God\u2019s name did that happen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI take full responsibility,\u201d Lawrence said. \u201cAs you instructed, I waited for Lady Nicholaa to come around the corner. A good five minutes passed before I happened to glance up and catch a glimpse of blue. It was her gown. Your wife had climbed up to the walkway atop the wall, Baron. By the time I reached her, it was too late. She\u2019d seen it all.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Royce shook his head. \u201cDamn,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>Lawrence nodded. \u201cThe look on her face was very distressing to see,\u201d he admitted. \u201cShe looked . . . devastated. She didn\u2019t say anything, though. She just turned around and walked away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can just imagine what she\u2019s thinking. She\u2019s never going to understand. Perhaps it\u2019s just as well she\u2019s already gone to bed. In the morning I\u2019ll try to reason with her.\u201d</p><p>Thomas joined the men at the table. Royce forced the matter of his wife aside and concentrated on listening to the soldier\u2019s report concerning the feasibility of restoring Nicholaa\u2019s home. The report confirmed what Royce already suspected: the structure wasn\u2019t sound enough to save.</p> <p>Talk continued until midnight. Royce finally went up to his chamber, fully expecting to find Nicholaa sound asleep.</p><p>He didn\u2019t find her at all. The chamber was empty. His first thought was that she\u2019d left him. It was a ridiculous, illogical reaction, but she wasn\u2019t there, damn it all, and she should have been in bed by now. His heart started slamming a wild beat inside his chest. He could almost taste his fear. If she\u2019d left the holding, she wouldn\u2019t survive the night. Royce suddenly felt that he was actually living a nightmare he\u2019d had about her the night they\u2019d reached London. In his dream, Nicholaa had been lost in the forest, and he hadn\u2019t been able to get to her.</p><p>He shook his head. He needed to calm down, he told himself, in order to think this situation through. The woman had absolutely no reason to leave him. He\u2019d been kind and patient with her. Dear God, if anything happened to her, he didn\u2019t know what he\u2019d do.</p><p>He raced out of the room. He shouted her name in a true roar, then started down the hallway, bellowing her name again.</p><p>As he passed Ulric\u2019s chamber, the door flew open and Nicholaa stood there frowning at him. Ulric was settled against her shoulder. The baby was fretting.</p> <p>Royce was so relieved to see her that he scowled. \u201cWhat the hell do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLower your voice, Royce,\u201d she ordered. \u201cYou\u2019re upsetting the baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you in bed where you belong?\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t seem to control his anger. He was so happy to see her that he felt like shouting. Then he realized he was. He almost laughed then. She was safe. She hadn\u2019t left him.</p><p>And he was losing his mind. He took a deep breath. His voice was mild when he said, \u201cUlric needs his sleep, Nicholaa. If you must hold him, do so tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wants to be held now,\u201d she snapped.</p> <p>Royce shook his head. \u201cGive him to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you quit giving orders? I\u2019m exhausted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen go to bed.\u201d</p><p>She was never going to understand him. \u201cAll right,\u201d she announced. \u201cI\u2019ll go to bed.\u201d She thrust Ulric into his arms and marched out of the room. \u201cYou take care of the baby,\u201d she ordered. \u201cPerhaps you can shout him to sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never shout.\u201d He shut the door.</p><p>She was shaking with anger by the time she reached their room. God was supposed to be on her side, wasn\u2019t he? Then why was she married to such a mean, impossible man? She couldn\u2019t possibly love him. He was arrogant, unbending, and had to have his way all the time. There wasn\u2019t a bit of give-and-take in his nature.</p><p>He\u2019d actually raised his voice to her! Royce had never shouted at her before. She didn\u2019t like it. Nicholaa was stopped short by that realization. She wanted him to change, didn\u2019t she? No, she admitted. She wanted him to stay just the way he was.</p><p>She was losing her mind. It was exhaustion, she told herself. She fell asleep the minute she closed her eyes. She awakened an hour later when she rolled over to snuggle up against her husband and found his side of the bed empty. Her mind immediately cleared.</p> <p>The baby must be giving Royce fits. She put on her robe and ran barefoot down the dark corridor.</p><p>She rushed into the baby\u2019s chamber, then came to a quick stop. She smiled at the sight before her. Both Royce and Ulric were sound asleep. Her husband was stretched out on the bed. He\u2019d taken his boots off but was otherwise fully clothed. Ulric was sleeping face down on Royce\u2019s chest. The baby\u2019s mouth was open and he was drooling all over her husband\u2019s tunic.</p><p>Royce held the baby with both hands. Nicholaa quietly closed the door and then stood there a long, long while staring at the pair.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t losing her mind after all. She wasn\u2019t even confused now. She knew exactly why she\u2019d fallen in love with Royce. He was everything a wife could ever want. He was kind, gentle, and soon, she promised herself, he\u2019d become loving, too. She wouldn\u2019t give up. The next time he pricked her temper, she would pull this night from her memory as a reminder to herself.</p><p>Nicholaa walked over to the side of the bed intending to move Ulric to his crib without waking her husband, but the minute she touched Royce\u2019s hand, he opened his eyes and reached for her. He held Ulric steady with one hand and pulled her down next to him with the other.</p><p>She snuggled up against her husband\u2019s side and closed her eyes.</p><p>\u201cNicholaa?\u201d His voice was a bare whisper.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d she whispered back.</p><p>\u201cYou belong with me.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Fourteen</p><p>Lady Millicent and her husband, Baron Duncan, of the border Duncans, came to collect Ulric six days later. Nicholaa hadn\u2019t been informed of the guests\u2019 arrival. Quite by chance, she walked into the great hall, her apron filled with spring flowers, and saw them there. She dropped the flowers.</p><p>Ulric\u2019s aunt was holding him and cooing, as a mother would to her own son. Duncan stood next to his wife, his hand on her shoulder. He was leaning down toward the baby and grinning like a proud father.</p><p>Nicholaa couldn\u2019t seem to remember her manners. She stood there staring for the longest while, trying to gather her composure.</p><p>Fortunately only Royce noticed her distress. He walked over to her, just as she was kneeling to collect the flowers. \u201cLeave them,\u201d he whispered as he gently lifted her back to her feet.</p><p>Alice stood to one side of the entrance mopping her eyes with her sleeve. Royce motioned for her to pick up the flowers, then took Nicholaa\u2019s hand and pulled her forward.</p><p>\u201cHave you ever met Baron Duncan and Lady Millicent?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>Nicholaa nodded. \u201cAt Thurston\u2019s wedding. They seemed pleasant enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you know they\u2019ve been married twelve years?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t know, and she didn\u2019t particularly care. She just wanted to snatch Ulric out of his aunt\u2019s arms and take him upstairs.</p><p>But that wasn\u2019t possible. \u201cDo they have children of their own?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Royce answered. \u201cSmile, Nicholaa,\u201d he ordered.</p><p>She smiled. Baron Duncan was staring intently at her. He was a squat-framed man with a full reddish orange beard. She remembered how kind he was to her when she and her family went to his holding for Thurston\u2019s wedding.</p><p>She moved away from Royce and made a curtsy. Her expression was serene now. She wanted to weep with Alice, but she knew she must behave with dignity. Ulric\u2019s welfare was more important than her own feelings. She tried to remember that.</p><p>Her voice barely quavered when she spoke. \u201cIt\u2019s a pleasure to see both of you again.\u201d</p><p>Ulric reached out to her. Nicholaa started to take him from Millicent, then changed her mind. She backed up a step. \u201cHe\u2019s a very affectionate child,\u201d she remarked, \u201cand he\u2019s not afraid of strangers. Most babies are, you know,\u201d she rambled on, wishing Royce would stop her. \u201cUlric\u2019s an exceptional child.\u201d</p><p>Baron Duncan nodded. \u201cAye, he is exceptional,\u201d he agreed. \u201cWe know how difficult this parting is for you, Nicholaa. Your husband has told us how attached you\u2019ve become to the babe.\u201d</p><p>Millicent handed Ulric to her husband and then rushed over to take Nicholaa\u2019s hand. Ulric\u2019s aunt, his mother\u2019s sister, was a heavyset woman with wide shoulders and wider thighs. She wasn\u2019t very appealing in appearance until you looked at her eyes. Then you forgot about her figure altogether, for Lady Millicent had lovely brown eyes that sparkled with warmth. \u201cWe\u2019ll take good care of him,\u201d she promised.</p><p>\u201cWill you love him?\u201d Nicholaa asked. \u201cBabies need love. Did my brother explain why he wanted you to take Ulric?\u201d</p><p>Millicent turned to her husband, and Duncan walked over to stand directly in front of Nicholaa. Ulric, she noticed, was clearly fascinated by Duncan\u2019s beard. He was tugging on it while he babbled out his new sounds.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Duncan answered. \u201cHe did explain, but Thurston isn\u2019t thinking clearly now, Nicholaa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to give me excuses for my brother\u2019s conduct,\u201d Nicholaa interrupted. She took a deep breath, then said, \u201cPlease sit down, both of you. I shall have a chamber made ready for you. We\u2019ll have a fine supper . . .\u201d</p><p>She stopped when Duncan shook his head. The sadness in his expression should have been warning enough for Nicholaa. \u201cWe can\u2019t stay,\u201d he announced, \u201cbecause of yet another outrageous promise your brother made us give him.\u201d</p><p>\u201c \u2019Tis the truth we would have promised him anything to make certain Ulric remained safe,\u201d Millicent interjected. \u201cIf we didn\u2019t agree to his conditions, he said he would take his son up into the hills.\u201d</p><p>Nicholaa edged closer to Royce\u2019s side. Just touching him somehow helped her maintain her composure. His mere presence comforted her. \u201cWhat was the other promise you had to give?\u201d she asked. \u201cYou said, \u2018yet another outrageous promise,\u2019 \u201d she reminded Duncan.</p><p>\u201cThurston made us promise you\u2019d have nothing to do with Ulric.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cHe had his plans all set when he came here,\u201d he said. \u201cHe fully expected you and Ulric to leave with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight then and there, in the dead of night,\u201d Millicent interjected.</p><p>Nicholaa didn\u2019t want to talk about Thurston\u2019s expectations. \u201cThe only important issue now is the welfare of the baby,\u201d she announced.</p><p>She turned around to make certain Alice was still lingering in the hall. \u201cYou may weep later, Alice. Go and pack Ulric\u2019s things now.\u201d She softened her command by adding, \u201cPlease, Alice?\u201d</p><p>Nicholaa turned around again to confront the couple. She moved away from Royce\u2019s side, folded her arms in front of her, and then said, \u201cNow I\u2019ll have two promises from you before I let Ulric leave.\u201d</p><p>Royce raised an eyebrow over the change in his wife. She sounded like a commander now.</p><p>Duncan looked wary. \u201cWhat are these promises?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst, you must promise to treat Ulric as if he is your own son.\u201d</p><p>Before she could go into her reasons for demanding that promise, both Millicent and Duncan agreed.</p><p>\u201cSecond, you will give me your word that Ulric will stay with you. If Thurston comes back and wants to take his son to someone else, for whatever reason, you won\u2019t let him. You will treat Ulric like your own son, and soon he\u2019ll begin to feel . . . secure. He will stay with you two from this moment on. I won\u2019t have him uprooted again. I . . .\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t go on. Royce put his arm around her and pulled her up against his side. \u201cThey\u2019ve already given me that promise, Nicholaa,\u201d he said.</p><p>Millicent and Duncan immediately nodded.</p><p>Nicholaa sagged against Royce.</p><p>\u201cThurston won\u2019t be allowed to uproot his son again,\u201d Royce assured her.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d She was stunned that Royce had already taken care of that worry, and she was pleased that he was so concerned about Ulric\u2019s well-being.</p><p>An hour later Millicent and Duncan took Ulric away. Royce ordered a full contingent of soldiers to ride escort.</p><p>Nicholaa barely spoke a word to anyone for the rest of the long day. She kept busy with a frenzy of cleaning. Royce didn\u2019t know how to console his wife. When she didn\u2019t come to the great hall for dinner, he went up to their room. He found Nicholaa sitting in a chair near the hearth. Without a word, he pulled her up, sat down, and then settled her on his lap. He wrapped his arms around her and held her tight.</p><p>Neither said a word for a long while. Then Royce broke the silence. \u201cIt was difficult for you today.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t remark on that truth.</p><p>\u201cThey didn\u2019t know how difficult,\u201d he said then. \u201cI\u2019m proud of you, Nicholaa.\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes and let her head drop onto his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cDo you remember my order to you?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cWhich one?\u201d she asked. \u201cThere were so many.\u201d</p><p>He ignored her sarcasm. \u201cThe one about weeping,\u201d he reminded her.</p><p>She smiled in spite of her misery. \u201cAh, yes, rule number three,\u201d she whispered. \u201cYou told me I couldn\u2019t cry.\u201d</p><p>He kissed the top of her head. \u201cI\u2019ve changed my mind,\u201d he announced in a gruff voice. \u201cYou may weep if you\u2019re so inclined.\u201d</p><p>It really was ridiculous for him to think that a simple change in orders could bring about her tears. She certainly wasn\u2019t going to cry just because he\u2019d told her it was now permissible. Besides, she didn\u2019t feel like weeping.</p><p>She soaked his tunic through before she finished. Then she started hiccuping. He didn\u2019t try to stop her. He just continued to hold her close until she finally quieted down.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re good people, Nicholaa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey will treat Ulric like their own,\u201d Royce remarked.</p><p>She nodded. Lord he hated to see her unhappy. \u201cNicholaa, you do understand why I let Ulric leave, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>The worry in his voice was more of a comfort to her than his hug. He did care about her feelings, if only just a little, or he wouldn\u2019t have been so eager to make her fully understand his motives.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to hurt Thurston because he\u2019s my brother, but you knew he\u2019d come back here if Ulric remained. I understand.\u201d</p><p>Royce was surprised he felt so relieved. \u201cI\u2019m not a difficult man to get along with,\u201d he told her.</p><p>He fully expected her agreement. He didn\u2019t get it. \u201cYes, you are difficult,\u201d she countered. \u201cWhere will you send Justin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sending Justin anywhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen Thurston will still come back here. He\u2019ll come for Justin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He didn\u2019t expound on that answer.</p><p>Nicholaa leaned away from him. \u201cUlric could have stayed . . .\u201d She stopped when he shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d she said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cJustin\u2019s a man, Nicholaa.

He wouldn\u2019t allow her brother to leave until he was strong enough to survive on his own.</p><p>\u201cHas he improved since that first day?\u201d she asked, trying to sound only mildly interested.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo everything\u2019s going according to your plans?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>She let out a loud sigh. \u201cThen you don\u2019t have to kick Justin anymore?\u201d</p><p>Royce smiled. His wife had finally managed to bring up the topic he knew she\u2019d wanted to discuss.</p><p>\u201cAnswer me, please,\u201d she said. \u201cDo you still kick Justin?\u201d</p><p>There was a noticeable sting in her voice now. Royce ignored it. \u201cOnly when I want to,\u201d he finally answered.</p><p>She tried to get off his lap. He held her tight. \u201cYou really shouldn\u2019t have watched, you know.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLawrence told you, didn\u2019t he?\u201d She sounded indignant.</p><p>\u201cMy vassal didn\u2019t betray you, Nicholaa. It was his duty to tell me. Besides, your expression would have told me anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was my right to watch,\u201d she announced. \u201cHe\u2019s my brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat isn\u2019t as important as his relationship to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s just your brother-in-law,\u201d she said incredulously.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s also my vassal,\u201d he patiently explained. \u201cThat bond is far more important. Surely you understand that.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t understand anything anymore. Everything had been turned inside out since the Normans started running things. King William had set up a rigid power structure in which everyone in his kingdom had a specific place, a specific duty. Aye, from the lowest serfs to the highest noblemen, everyone had a place. Everyone but Nicholaa . . . or so she felt in her heart. She didn\u2019t fit in to this new scheme of things. She was suddenly so frightened that she actually started shaking. For a long time she\u2019d had many responsibilities, but now Royce was methodically taking those duties away from her. She\u2019d made a vow to protect her family in any way that she could. She had once believed that Ulric and Justin needed her to keep them safe. Now Ulric was gone. Soon Justin would leave, too. When her brother completed his training, he would leave to find his own way in this difficult world. Justin didn\u2019t need her even now, she realized. No, he needed Royce to teach him how to be strong again.</p><p>No one needed her. The holding belonged to Royce, and so did the servants. They had already given her husband their complete loyalty. It was only right, she told herself, because he was the master of this castle now . . . but where did that leave her?</p> <p>Nicholaa couldn\u2019t shake the bout of self-pity she seemed to be wallowing in. She let out a sigh, pushed herself off her husband\u2019s lap, and prepared for bed. She barely noticed that Royce was undressing, too.</p><p>Damn, she hated feeling sorry for herself, but she couldn\u2019t seem to stop. She felt empty inside\u2014guilty, too. She\u2019d deliberately trapped Royce into this marriage. He was only making the best of his circumstances.</p><p>Nicholaa was standing near the bed, dressed only in her white chemise, her mind filled with chaos, when Royce put his arms around her waist and pulled her back against him. He leaned down to nuzzle the side of her neck.</p><p>\u201cRoyce, you don\u2019t need anyone, do you?\u201d</p><p>Since they\u2019d been talking about her brother only minutes before, he misunderstood her question. \u201cI\u2019m a trainer,\u201d he answered. \u201cI\u2019m not supposed to need anyone.\u201d</p><p>She turned around in his arms, splaying her hands on his bare chest. \u201cI have a confession to make to you,\u201d she said. \u201cWill you listen to me?\u201d</p><p>Her fingers were making circles around his nipples. He put his hands on top of hers. \u201cIf you want me to listen, you\u2019ll have to stop that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is a serious confession,\u201d she warned him.</p><p>He quit smiling. \u201cAll right. I\u2019m listening.\u201d</p><p>She turned her gaze to his chin. She didn\u2019t want to be distracted. \u201cWhen I chose you for my husband, I was thinking only of myself. I was being very selfish. I realize that now. I didn\u2019t care if I ruined your life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would never allow anyone to ruin my life,\u201d he countered.</p><p>\u201cBut you never would have chosen me,\u201d she rushed out. She put her hand over his mouth to stop him from interrupting her again. \u201cYou probably think I was just getting even with you for taking me to London, and in part, perhaps that was true. But there was much more to my reasons, Royce. You were so gentle with Ulric. I knew you\u2019d be a good father when I saw how you held him and made certain he was protected. You were gentle with me, too,\u201d she added in another rush. \u201cI came to know you quite well by the time we reached London. You\u2019re proud and arrogant, but also strong and patient.\u201d</p><p>She paused to gather her courage to give him the rest of her confession. Royce pulled her hand away from his mouth and kissed her palm. \u201cAre you finished yet? I have something to say to you when you\u2019re done.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI have to say all of this, Royce, before I lose my courage.\u201d</p><p>His smile was filled with tenderness. \u201cYou have enough courage. You can afford to lose a little of it,\u201d he told her.</p><p>He was wrong, but she wasn\u2019t going to tell him so now.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d already given me your word you\u2019d look after Justin,\u201d she said, \u201cbut that wasn\u2019t enough for me. No, I then forced you to marry me and added Ulric and myself to your burden.\u201d She let out a sigh. \u201cI can\u2019t change what I\u2019ve done to you, but I want you to know I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t consider your feelings. I know I haven\u2019t made your adjustment easy. I\u2019ve fought you every step of the way. But that\u2019s going to stop now. I\u2019m going to be the kind of wife you want, Royce. I give you my word. We\u2019ll live in peace and harmony together, just the way you want.\u201d</p><p>He gently brushed the hair away from her face. The tenderness in his expression brought tears to her eyes. She ached with her need to tell him she loved him. She wouldn\u2019t give him that confession, though, no matter how much she wanted to, for her pledge would only be one more burden for him to carry around. She knew he didn\u2019t love her, and because he was such a kind, caring man, he was sure to feel guilty over that fact.</p><p>\u201cNicholaa, are you sorry you married me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no, I\u2019m not sorry,\u201d she answered. \u201cYou haven\u2019t listened to a word I\u2019ve said, have you? You\u2019re the one who\u2019s sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am?\u201d</p><p>His sudden grin waylaid her concentration. She nodded, but couldn\u2019t remember why. She was overwrought, she decided. She put her arms around her husband\u2019s neck, drawing his full attention, then tugged on his hair to bring his head down to hers. When he complied with that command, she kissed him with all the love and passion inside her.</p><p>Royce had planned to sit down with her and straighten out all of her crooked conclusions, but the minute her mouth touched his, he decided to put that discussion aside until later. He only wanted to think about kissing her back.</p><p>He went a little wild when her tongue rubbed against his. He growled low in his throat to let her know how much he liked that boldness. His hands shook when he untied the ribbon holding her chemise together. He moved back just long enough to let the garment fall to the floor, then roughly pulled her up against him, his jaw clenching when he felt her soft full br**sts press against his chest.</p><p>Nicholaa tore her mouth away from his and kissed a wet path down his throat. She pushed his hands away from her waist as she moved lower. Her tongue stroked a circle around first one and then the other nipple hidden beneath the mat of crisp hair covering his chest. Then she moved lower still until she\u2019d reached his hard, flat stomach. His skin was so hot, so appealing to her. Her tongue flicked his navel. He inhaled sharply, telling her without words he liked that caress.</p><p>His reaction made her want to please him even more.</p><p>Royce\u2019s knees almost buckled when Nicholaa knelt in front of him. His hands turned into fists at his sides. He knew what she was going to do, but the agony of waiting for her to touch him, to feel himself inside her soft, wet mouth was almost unbearable.</p><p>And then the wait was over. Her hands stroked him until he was wild, and then her mouth closed around the tip of his arousal. Royce forgot to breathe. The growl deep in his throat turned into a low groan of surrender. He moved against her. Once. Twice. He had to stop her. Her tongue was making him crazed, and he knew if he didn\u2019t stop her now, it would be too late.</p><p>\u201cEnough,\u201d he commanded, his voice harsh with his need.</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to stop. He forced her to stand up, then wrapped his arms around her waist and lifted her off the floor. He was out of control now, desperate to find fulfillment, and yet he wanted Nicholaa to surrender with him.</p><p>Somehow they got into bed. His mouth slanted over hers even as he was covering her body with his own. He stroked the fire of passion inside her with his tongue and his hands. His fingers thrust inside her and when he felt the moist heat there, his control completely snapped.</p><p>She arched up against him. \u201cRoyce, come to me now. I don\u2019t want to wait any longer.\u201d</p><p>He would have smiled over the demand in her voice if he\u2019d had the strength. Nicholaa was wild now, as out of control as he was. She scraped his shoulders with her nails and moved restlessly against him.</p><p>Royce rolled onto his back, taking her with him, then forced her legs apart. She straddled his thighs, but still didn\u2019t understand what he wanted to do. She tried to get him to roll over again.</p><p>\u201cRoyce!\u201d She shouted her demand this time.</p><p>He jerked her head down by pulling on her hair and sealed her protest with a long hot kiss. His thighs came up and the tip of his hard arousal brushed against her. She understood then. She pulled back and looked down into her husband\u2019s eyes. The passion she saw there made the warm knot of longing inside her burst into flames of pleasure.</p><p>\u201cWe can make love this way?\u201d she asked in a ragged voice.</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer her. He showed her instead. He slowly eased into her. God, she was so tight, so hot. She felt so good. Royce closed his eyes in sheer ecstasy. He never wanted the feeling to end.</p><p>He wouldn\u2019t let her quicken the pace. He gripped her h*ps as he slowly penetrated her. Nicholaa\u2019s head fell back, and she let out a moan of pleasure. Her hands gripped Royce\u2019s upper arms.</p><p>\u201cLean back, Nicholaa.\u201d</p><p>She did as he ordered, then cried out. She\u2019d taken all of him inside her. Her lower back was cushioned against his thighs now. Heat surrounded her, penetrated her.</p><p>\u201cAm I hurting you? I don\u2019t want to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>She hushed his worry by taking his mind off the matter. She shifted, just a little and liked that wonderful feeling so much that she moved again.</p><p>He grunted with pleasure. He opened his eyes to find her staring down at him. Were his eyes as glazed with passion as hers were? He knew they must be. It seemed a miracle to him that such a beautiful woman would want him as much as he wanted her.</p><p>She loved him. The thought cut through his haze of passion and lust. Aye, she loved him.</p><p>Nicholaa could no longer ignore the pressure building inside her. She felt as if she might explode with her need to find release from this sweet torture. She wanted it all now. She wouldn\u2019t let Royce set the pace, couldn\u2019t stop herself from moving, ever so slowly at first, and then more forcefully until she was mindless to everything but finding release.</p><p>He helped her find fulfillment. He knew just what spots to touch, to caress, to drive her beyond the brink.</p><p>His fingers were as magical as the rest of him. Her whole body suddenly tightened around him. Royce couldn\u2019t hold back any longer. He poured his seed into her with a shout of surrender. Nicholaa\u2019s release was every bit as consuming, just as shattering. She didn\u2019t shout; she wept.</p><p>She collapsed against her husband and held him tight. She never wanted to let go.</p><p>It took a long, long time for Royce to recover. He gently stroked Nicholaa\u2019s shoulders, her back, her arms. He couldn\u2019t stop touching her. She felt so good pressed up against him. Each time he made love to her, he was left feeling stunned by the beauty of her response to him. She never held a part of herself back from him. Royce had never experienced such bliss or felt such contentment.</p><p>It was a miracle, a gift. His wife could make him feel weak and powerful at the very same time. He knew that contradiction didn\u2019t make any sense, but neither did the fact that he was now married to such a gentle, beautiful woman.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t believe she could love him. He\u2019d never expected such a thing could happen to him. On the day he was disfigured\u2014Lord, was he only fifteen years old then?\u2014he\u2019d accepted his lot in life. The looks of revulsion on women\u2019s faces as they openly stared at him . . . yes, he\u2019d learned to accept.</p><p>But Nicholaa loved him.</p><p>\u201cRoyce?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas it . . . all right?\u201d Her voice was hesitant, filled with embarrassment. \u201cWhat I did?\u201d</p><p>He knew what she was talking about of course. \u201cOh, yes, it was all right,\u201d he answered. \u201cWhat made you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted to,\u201d she interrupted.</p><p>A long minute passed before Royce spoke again. \u201cNicholaa, did you make love that way because you were trying to be the kind of wife you thought I wanted, or did you take me into your mouth because you wanted to?\u201d</p><p>She was thankful he couldn\u2019t see her face. She was burning with embarrassment. \u201cI already told you I wanted to,\u201d she whispered into the darkness. \u201cAnd you said you liked it. My, I\u2019m tired. I believe I\u2019ll go to sleep now.\u201d</p><p>He wrapped his arms around her to keep her warm. He took the hint, of course, that Nicholaa didn\u2019t want to discuss the intimacy.</p><p>She fell asleep minutes later. Royce stayed awake much longer. What an innocent charmer his wife was. He recounted her confession over and over again in his mind. She really believed she\u2019d forced him to marry her.</p><p>Something else was bothering her, too. Something in the way she\u2019d spoken told him she was harboring another worry or two. Nicholaa had looked so vulnerable, he remembered, and there had been a desperate edge in her voice. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Hell, he hoped she didn\u2019t have a couple more brothers she hadn\u2019t mentioned to him yet.</p><p>That possibility made him smile. He wondered how long it would take him to really understand his wife. Royce decided he\u2019d have to sit down with her and discuss these concerns. He didn\u2019t want her to worry about anything. She was going to be happy, he vowed, and he wouldn\u2019t stop prodding her until she was.</p><p>Royce woke up in the middle of the night when Nicholaa rolled away from him in her sleep. He followed her. He would have fallen back to sleep if her backside hadn\u2019t rubbed up against his groin. That enticement was too much to ignore. He had to touch her then. One caress led to another and another, and before he was fully awake, he was making slow, sweet love to her.</p><p>Their mouths melted together in long, lazy kisses, and their lovemaking was filled with tenderness. And when they\u2019d both found fulfillment, they fell asleep hugging each other.</p> <p>Chapter Fifteen</p><p>Nicholaa\u2019s behavior underwent a radical change. It all started the morning after she promised to become the kind of wife Royce wanted.</p><p>She rose at the crack of dawn, dressed quietly, and went down to the great hall. She was giving directions to the servants for the day\u2019s activities before her husband had even opened his eyes.</p><p>Nicholaa missed Ulric so much she was aching inside. She was determined to keep busy so she wouldn\u2019t have time for self-pity. She was going to work until she dropped from exhaustion.</p><p>She was going to give her husband peace, too. The problem, of course, was figuring out how to accomplish that goal. She\u2019d have to control her temper, keep her opinions to herself, and agree with her husband at all times.</p> <p>She might as well be dead, she thought to herself. The changes would probably kill her. Still, she\u2019d given her word to Royce, and she was going to keep it. She owed him her gratitude for everything he\u2019d done for her family, too. Granted, she\u2019d forced him to take on those responsibilities, and she\u2019d ruined his life in the process. The very least she could do to make up for that was to give the man what he wanted.</p><p>In the back of her mind lurked the tiny hope that, once she\u2019d made all these changes, Royce might start to love her. She didn\u2019t just want a place in his life. She wanted his heart, too.</p><p>Nicholaa was arranging flowers in the brown clay bowl on the table when Clarise and Alice hurried into the hall.</p><p>The two women took turns offering comfort to each other over the loss of their \u201cprecious little baggage,\u201d the affectionate term they\u2019d given to Ulric.</p><p>The more they talked about the baby the more upset Nicholaa became. She shook her head and announced Ulric would be well loved.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve a list of chores to give you today,\u201d she said then. \u201cEvery morning I\u2019ll divide our duties and we\u2019ll get them done before nightfall. We\u2019re going to get organized, ladies.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Clarise asked. \u201cWe\u2019ve gotten everything done in the past without being organized.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy husband doesn\u2019t like disorder,\u201d Nicholaa explained. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve given him my word I will become the kind of wife he wants. Therefore\u2014\u201d</p><p>Alice interrupted her. \u201cBut he likes you fine the way you are.\u201d</p><p>Clarise agreed. \u201cYou can\u2019t believe otherwise, mistress. Why, the baron\u2019s so kind and patient\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s kind and patient with everyone,\u201d Nicholaa interjected.</p><p>\u201cWell, then,\u201d Clarise asked, \u201cwhy this need to change?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m after more,\u201d Nicholaa confessed in a whisper. \u201cI would like Royce to . . .\u201d She couldn\u2019t get the words out.</p><p>Clarise took sympathy on her. \u201cYou would like the baron to feel about you the same way your father felt about your mother? Is that what you\u2019re meaning to say?\u201d</p> <p>Nicholaa nodded.</p><p>Clarise snorted, then turned to Alice. \u201cShe thinks the baron doesn\u2019t love her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, he must love her,\u201d Alice replied. \u201cOf course he does.\u201d</p><p>Nicholaa let out a sigh. \u201cYou both love me,\u201d she announced, \u201cjust as I love you, and for that reason you can\u2019t imagine that someone else wouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Clarise scowled. Nicholaa held up her hand so neither servant would interrupt, then calmly outlined the changes she planned to make. The two women looked at her incredulously.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re never going to raise your voice?\u201d Alice asked, latching on to the last change Nicholaa had explained.</p><p>Clarise shook her head. \u201cYou can\u2019t be serious,\u201d she said. \u201cIf the man can\u2019t love you for what you are\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m saying he does love her,\u201d Alice muttered. \u201cMilady, you need only put the question to him.\u201d</p><p>Nicholaa\u2019s shoulders drooped. She didn\u2019t like admitting that she was afraid to ask. If he told her no, what would she do? \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if he loves me or not,\u201d she said. \u201cI owe him my gratitude. I\u2019m going to give him the happiness and peace he deserves. It\u2019s the least I can do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never seen you so unsure of yourself,\u201d Clarise muttered. \u201cI\u2019m not liking it, either. I liked you better when you would take the dog by his tail and give him what for. Aye, you always had yourself a plan in the past when you wanted to get something.\u201d</p><p>Nicholaa smiled. \u201cI have a plan now,\u201d she argued. \u201cI\u2019ll give Royce exactly what he wants, and then he\u2019ll realize he loves me. See how simple it is?\u201d</p><p>Royce walked into the hall, interrupting the discussion. Nicholaa hurried over to meet him at the entrance and gave him a proper greeting. She kissed him, too.</p><p>Clarise and Alice hurried to the buttery to see about the morning meal. Nicholaa walked with Royce to the table.</p><p>She was smiling. Royce was pleased by that. Since his wife was in a pleasant frame of mind, he decided to wait before sitting down to discuss her worries with her.</p><p>Perhaps he\u2019d been too concerned last night. Nicholaa was probably just overwrought because Ulric had left. He knew she was going to miss the baby, and her mood last night was probably just a reflection of the emptiness she was feeling inside.</p><p>Thomas and Lawrence strolled into the hall and took their positions at the table.</p><p>As soon as Royce sat down, Nicholaa clasped her hands behind her back and recited the duties she planned to undertake for the day.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t have been more pleased with her. He was about to tell her so when Thomas interrupted.</p><p>\u201cHave you had a chance to explain about the wood, Baron?\u201d</p><p>Royce shook his head. He reached around behind Nicholaa and took one of her hands. Since she was in such a cheerful mood, now would be a good time to discuss her home.</p><p>\u201cNicholaa, you never asked me why I ordered this table moved to the center of the room,\u201d he began.</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t my place to question your orders, husband,\u201d she answered, repeating his own dictate back to him.</p><p>He smiled.</p><p>She decided then he was happy because she remembered that lecture.</p><p>\u201cI had the table moved because the floorboards under the spot where it used to stand have almost completely rotted through. By all rights, the table should have crashed through to the lower level long ago.\u201d</p><p>Nicholaa hadn\u2019t realized the floors were in such bad condition. She forced herself to keep smiling as she waited for Royce to continue.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a miracle the entire floor hasn\u2019t collapsed,\u201d Thomas interjected.</p><p>Royce nodded. \u201cThe second floor is rotted as well. Thomas doesn\u2019t believe it can be reinforced.\u201d</p><p>Thomas volunteered additional information. Nicholaa noticed that Royce nudged the vassal first. \u201cThe entire structure should be torn down and a new one built,\u201d Thomas blurted out.</p><p>\u201cThe cost will be four times greater if the baron tries to save this one,\u201d Lawrence added.</p><p>Nicholaa didn\u2019t react to this news. She knew Royce was only telling her the truth. How often had her mother remarked that the keep was falling down around them? Nicholaa remembered the heated debates between her parents. Papa had wanted to leave things just the way they were. He hated change. Mother had been more practical.</p><p>Nicholaa realized she took after her father; she also hated change. Then she noticed how concerned the three men looked as they stared at her. They were in league together, gently planting the seeds of her eventual acceptance.</p><p>Her husband obviously did care about her feelings after all. \u201cI haven\u2019t made a final decision,\u201d Royce announced in a gruff, no-nonsense voice.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t telling her the truth. He\u2019d made his decision, all right, but he wanted to give her time to get use to the idea first.</p><p>She smiled at her husband and went back to arranging the flowers. All three warriors continued to watch her. She caught Royce\u2019s shrug out of the corner of her eye.</p><p>\u201cI know how much this home means to you, wife. If possible, I\u2019ll\u2014\u201d</p><p>She finished his sentence for him. \u201cTry to save the keep?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. She shook her head. \u201cYou mustn\u2019t consider my feelings. This is your holding now, not mine. Do what you feel is best. Whatever you decide will be fine with me.\u201d</p><p>Thomas and Lawrence sighed. Royce frowned. His wife\u2019s easy acceptance bothered him.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll discuss this later,\u201d he announced.</p><p>\u201cIf it will please you,\u201d she answered.</p><p>She was being too accommodating. He was immediately suspicious. He decided to put his wife\u2019s unusual behavior out of his mind for the rest of the day and focus his attention on training his soldiers.</p><p>Nicholaa continued to arrange the flowers so that she could hear her husband\u2019s plans for the day. She was hoping for a word about her brother.</p><p>Her patience was finally rewarded. Justin, Lawrence told Royce, was beginning to work within the unit. He still showed no allegiance to the others, but his hostility had lessened and he was giving his opinions more and more often. Lawrence thought that was a good start.</p><p>Royce agreed. He noticed how his wife was pulling and tugging on the flowers and took mercy on her. \u201cNicholaa, would you like to speak to your brother today?\u201d</p><p>She almost knocked the vase over. \u201cOh, yes, I would like to,\u201d she answered in a rush. \u201cI couldn\u2019t help overhearing your remarks about Justin getting along now, Lawrence. Is my brother also feeling well?\u201d</p><p>The vassal smiled. \u201cYes, my lady, though in truth I haven\u2019t asked him,\u201d he admitted.</p><p>Nicholaa walked over to stand by her husband. She was looking at Lawrence. \u201cYou are training Justin, then?\u201d</p><p>Royce gave his vassal permission to explain.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve always been commander of the new soldiers,\u201d Lawrence said. \u201cI do very little training in weapons and attack methods, however. My task is to strengthen their bodies. When I feel they\u2019re as fit as possible, then they\u2019ll move up into Royce\u2019s ranks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo that is why they are taking those heavy stones from one pile and putting them in another? It isn\u2019t punishment, after all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNicholaa, the soldiers aren\u2019t my enemies,\u201d Royce interjected, clearly exasperated. \u201cWe serve two purposes with that duty. Those men will build a new wall, much wider and taller than the old one, for I want a larger area in which to train,\u201d he explained. \u201cAnd the work will strengthen the men.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, letting him know she understood. \u201cWhen will I see Justin? Should I go down to the soldiers\u2019 quarters? Yes, I should,\u201d she answered in a rush. \u201cI want to make certain Justin has enough blankets for the cold nights.\u201d</p><p>Royce tried not to laugh. He could just imagine the embarrassment Justin would feel if she tried to coddle him. \u201cYou may see him later. I\u2019ll send him to the courtyard.\u201d</p><p>Royce was as good as his word, of course. Nicholaa paced back and forth along the edge of the inner courtyard for what seemed like hours before she spotted her brother walking up the slope toward her. She started running to meet him. Tears came to her eyes, but she forced herself to stop that foolishness.</p><p>Nicholaa threw herself into Justin\u2019s arms and hugged him tight. How fit he looked! The color was back in his face, and when she finally pulled away and looked up into his eyes, she knew without a doubt that he was going to be all right.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t find her voice. She kissed his chin and finally let go of him.</p><p>\u201cYou look happy, sister,\u201d Justin announced, his voice gruff with emotion.</p><p>\u201cI am happy,\u201d she answered. \u201cHappy to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe baron treats you well?\u201d</p><p>He was already beginning to frown when she answered him. \u201cOh, yes, very well,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s kind and patient with me.\u201d</p><p>His frown eased away. He actually laughed when she added that she was also being kind and patient with him.</p><p>\u201cAre you getting enough to eat, Justin? Do you have enough blankets at night? Do you need anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have enough,\u201d Justin answered. He turned and saw Ingelram and Bryan watching. Justin\u2019s voice was a bit more gruff when he said, \u201cI\u2019m not a boy, Nicholaa. Do not treat me as such.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t realize they had an audience, nor did she see Royce coming up the slope toward them. Her gaze was fully directed on her brother\u2019s face. The sun had darkened his skin and lightened his blond hair. She hadn\u2019t realized what a handsome man Justin was becoming.</p><p>\u201cDid you know Ulric left?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Justin nodded. \u201cThe baron told me.\u201d</p><p>Nicholaa noticed that her brother\u2019s voice had taken on a hard edge. \u201cYou aren\u2019t concerned about Ulric, are you? He\u2019ll be well taken care of by Duncan and Millicent,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not concerned,\u201d Justin answered. \u201cUlric will be happy with them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why are you frowning?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cThe baron told me Thurston came here. He shouldn\u2019t have.\u201d</p><p>Justin\u2019s voice was flat, devoid of emotion. Nicholaa didn\u2019t know what to make of that reaction.</p><p>Then Royce interrupted them. \u201cJustin, you have one afternoon a week away from your duties. This isn\u2019t it. Say good-bye to your sister. Ingelram and Bryan are waiting.\u201d</p><p>Justin immediately separated himself from his sister and turned to bow to his baron. Nicholaa didn\u2019t want him to leave just yet. She reached out to detain him and noticed that his entire left arm was covered with black leather. Two wide loops from elbow to shoulder held the covering in place.</p><p>Royce also noticed the contraption. \u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Justin turned back to his baron just as Bryan and Ingelram came forward. \u201cBryan made this for me,\u201d Justin muttered with a shrug, his gaze on the ground. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Royce took hold of one of the two loops. \u201cWhen you begin training with the Hawks, I\u2019d advise you not to wear this,\u201d he announced.</p><p>\u201cWould they jeer him, Baron?\u201d Ingelram asked, frowning over that possibility.</p><p>Royce laughed. Lord, they were ignorant . . . and young. He twisted the loop until he had it firmly wedged between his fingers. He kept his gaze on Justin all the while. The boy\u2019s face was turning red. \u201cThey won\u2019t jeer him,\u201d he told Ingelram. \u201cBut they sure as hell will take advantage.\u201d</p><p>Royce tightened his hold until Justin could barely move. \u201cThen they\u2019ll take their sweet time as they beat some sense into Justin for wearing such a contraption.\u201d</p> <p>Nicholaa was horrified when her husband laughed at Justin. She didn\u2019t interfere, though, and when the full explanation had been given, even she realized that the leather covering wasn\u2019t a protection but a weapon that could be used against her brother.</p><p>Justin understood, too. As soon as Royce let go, her brother took the covering off.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been excused,\u201d Royce told the three soldiers.</p><p>In unison they bowed to their baron and turned to leave. Justin walked between Bryan and Ingelram. Nicholaa stood next to Royce as she watched her brother walk down the first slope.</p><p>She didn\u2019t realize she\u2019d taken her husband\u2019s hand. He could feel her trembling. He. squeezed. \u201cDo you feel better now that you\u2019ve spoken to Justin?\u201d</p> <p>She kept her gaze on her brother\u2019s back. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Then Ingelram\u2019s voice reached her. The young soldier obviously thought he was far enough away not to be overheard. \u201cAre you getting enough to eat?\u201d he drawled out in a horrible imitation of a woman\u2019s high-pitched voice.</p><p>Bryan immediately joined in. \u201cWould you like my blanket tonight, Justin?\u201d</p><p>Nicholaa\u2019s brother retaliated by shoving Ingelram with his left shoulder and trying to trip Bryan with his right foot.</p><p>Both Ingelram and Bryan were laughing, and\u2014miracle of miracles\u2014Justin joined in.</p><p>Royce forced himself not to laugh. He didn\u2019t want to hurt Nicholaa\u2019s feelings. He turned to look down at her and found her smiling.</p> <p>\u201cI was coddling him like a mother,\u201d she admitted. \u201cHe laughed, Royce, didn\u2019t he? I haven\u2019t heard his laughter in so long I\u2019d forgotten. Thank you, husband.\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t sure why she thanked him, but she suddenly threw herself into his arms and kissed him.</p><p>His wife did lose a bit of her smile when he announced that she wouldn\u2019t be able to talk to Justin again until the first phase of his training was completed, in approximately sixty days. She didn\u2019t argue with him. Royce thought that was a nice change.</p><p>He didn\u2019t see his wife again until the dinner hour. She sat beside him at the table, but as soon as the meal was finished and he and Lawrence began to discuss their plans for the following day, Nicholaa excused herself from the table with the request that she be allowed to go up to the chamber.</p><p>That routine became the standard. A full two months passed in a peaceful, organized manner. There wasn\u2019t one outburst of anger, one surprise to put him on his guard, or one argument. Royce should have been pleased with this remarkable turnaround. He wasn\u2019t, though. Nicholaa hadn\u2019t lost her temper in almost sixty days. If she became any more serene, he thought he\u2019d have to start checking to make certain the woman was still breathing.</p><p>Her attitude frustrated the hell out of him. She granted his every wish. Even before he realized he wanted something, she was there giving it to him.</p><p>Her passionate nature asserted itself only when they were in bed together and he was touching her. She couldn\u2019t act serene then. Royce was thankful for that blessing, but he wanted more. God\u2019s truth, he wanted his impossible wife back.</p><p>He missed her glares when she wasn\u2019t getting her way. He missed their arguments, too, especially the ones he couldn\u2019t possibly win because she was so stubbornly illogical. But most of all, he missed lecturing her.</p> <p>Nicholaa wore a smile from the time she got out of the bed in the morning until she closed her eyes at night. It seemed to be a permanent condition, and it was making him daft. She couldn\u2019t be that happy. No one could be that happy. The sparkle was missing from her eyes, too. She didn\u2019t laugh, either.</p><p>But then, laughter was spontaneous, wasn\u2019t it? And Nicholaa didn\u2019t do anything spontaneous anymore.</p><p>God help him, he\u2019d done this to her. He took full blame for the change in her. He was getting exactly what he\u2019d set out to get. The problem was finding a way to undo the damage. He considered one plan after another, but none seemed acceptable. Then Justin solved his problem for him\u2014rather nicely, too.</p><p>It was mid-June. Royce was in the lower bailey supervising the training of the experienced soldiers. Lawrence, who commanded the Doves, rarely requested Royce\u2019s assistance.</p><p>Today proved to be an exception however. Lawrence called Royce down to the lower hill, and when his baron reached his side, the vassal motioned for Ingelram and Bryan to begin sparring.</p><p>Justin stood to one side, waiting his turn.</p><p>\u201cThose three have become fast friends,\u201d Lawrence remarked. \u201cI\u2019m pleased with Justin\u2019s progress on the whole. You can see he\u2019s regained the weight he lost, added a bit more bulk, too. Swinging a sword and lifting stones have added to his muscle. Aye, he\u2019s coming along nicely.\u201d</p><p>Ingelram knocked Bryan to the ground, let out a shout of victory, then turned to Justin. Bryan rolled out of the way as Justin swaggered forward. Ingelram and Justin put on quite a show for their baron. Several other soldiers formed a wide circle to watch.</p><p>The longer Royce observed, the more he frowned. \u201cTell me this, Lawrence,\u201d he asked. \u201cIs Ingelram sparring with Justin or dancing with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly,\u201d Lawrence muttered. \u201cThat\u2019s why I wanted you to watch, Baron. No matter which man I pair with Justin, the result is always the same. I don\u2019t think they do it on purpose, but the men soften their attack when I pit them against the boy.\u201d</p><p>Royce nodded. He let out a shrill whistle, drawing everyone\u2019s attention. Justin was still a bit wary of his baron. He\u2019d been grinning while he battled his friend, but his expression was contained when he turned to Royce.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in the mood to knock a few of you on your backsides,\u201d Royce announced. \u201cWho wants this privilege?\u201d</p><p>It was a rare honor their baron bestowed upon the younger soldiers, and each was eager to be the first to take on the challenge.</p><p>Yet while the soldiers rushed forward, Royce noticed they also tried to keep Justin at the back of the line. Even now they were trying to protect him. Their friendship for Nicholaa\u2019s brother could very well get him killed.</p><p>Justin wasn\u2019t about to be left out, though. He shouldered his way to the front of the group.</p><p>\u201cHow many will get this opportunity, Baron?\u201d Justin called out.</p><p>The others now lined up behind him, with Ingelram and Bryan flanking him. Justin was acting as their spokesman, and Royce was so pleased with this turn of events that he almost laughed. Lawrence had kept Royce informed of Justin\u2019s progress, of course, but seeing the boy now standing so tall and proud still took him by surprise. It warmed his heart, too.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll only waste enough of my valuable time to fight four of you,\u201d Royce drawled. \u201cSince you\u2019ve taken it upon yourself to speak for the unit, you\u2019ll be one of those four. Pick the other three, Justin, and then put yourself last, as befits a leader.\u201d</p><p>Justin nodded. He started to turn to his friends, then stopped. \u201cAnd if one of us knocks you on your backside, Baron?\u201d</p><p>Royce did laugh then. \u201cHe will be suitably rewarded.\u201d</p><p>Justin smiled. A conference was immediately called. Royce and Lawrence stood by while the soldiers decided among themselves who the other three would be.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve done well,\u201d Royce told Lawrence in a low whisper. \u201cHis body\u2019s strong now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s ready to train,\u201d Lawrence replied. \u201cSo are the others, Royce.\u201d</p><p>The decision was finally reached among the Doves. A redheaded soldier by the name of Merrill strutted forward. He bowed first to Royce, then to Lawrence.</p><p>Royce took a step forward. \u201cWe won\u2019t use weapons,\u201d he decreed.</p><p>Merrill immediately unstrapped the sheath from his side and handed the sword and covering to Justin. Then he turned back to his baron. \u201cI\u2019m ready, my lord.\u201d</p><p>Royce laughed again. \u201cNay, you\u2019re not ready,\u201d he said. \u201cPerhaps after three months of training with me, you will be ready, but not today, Merrill.\u201d</p><p>He beckoned with one hand for Merrill to attack. The soldier slowly circled his baron. Royce didn\u2019t move at all, even when Merrill had worked his way around him.</p><p>Merrill positioned himself behind his baron and finally attacked, intending to grab his lord by his neck and wrestle him to the ground.</p><p>Royce waited until he felt Merrill\u2019s touch, then twisted and, with one hand, lifted the soldier off his feet, flung him over his shoulder, and dropped him on the ground. Merrill landed with a grunt on his backside.</p><p>\u201cYou gave me too much time to think about what you were going to do, Merrill,\u201d Royce instructed. \u201cIf you want to surprise your adversary by sneaking up behind him, do so with speed. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>Merrill nodded. Royce reached down, offering his hand to the soldier. Merrill grabbed hold and was hauled back to his feet.</p><p>\u201cNext,\u201d Royce ordered.</p><p>Bryan moved forward. He\u2019d already removed his sword. He swung at his baron with his left fist. If the blow had connected, it would have flattened an ordinary man. Royce wasn\u2019t ordinary, though, but Bryan didn\u2019t remember that fact soon enough. The baron easily caught hold of the soldier\u2019s fist with one hand and held on.</p><p>\u201cNow what, Bryan?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Bryan\u2019s hand throbbed. He felt as though he\u2019d just rammed it into a stone wall. He grimaced against the pain, then tried to strike Royce with his other fist. Royce deflected the blow and sent Bryan flying to the ground.</p><p>\u201cAgain you allowed me to have the advantage,\u201d he explained to the group. \u201cUse whatever method works. Bryan, you have feet. Use them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Baron.\u201d</p><p>A third soldier hurried into the center of the circle. His name was Howard, and he proved to be a bit more cunning than the first two. Royce had to knock him down twice before he landed on his backside.</p><p>And then it was Justin\u2019s turn. Royce stared at him a long minute before giving him the order to begin.</p><p>\u201cWhat have you learned from the first three challengers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve learned to use my feet and my fist,\u201d Justin answered. \u201cAnd to use any method, fair or foul, to get you to the ground, Baron.\u201d</p><p>Royce nodded. \u201cThen my time hasn\u2019t been wasted,\u201d he announced. His gaze moved over the entire group. \u201cLawrence has given you tasks to strengthen your bodies, but now the time has come for you to learn how to use your heads. In battle, strength without cunning means nothing. Tomorrow you will begin training with the experienced knights.\u201d</p><p>A loud cheer went up. The soldiers had officially completed the first phase of their training. It was time to celebrate.</p><p>Royce smiled. The soldiers wouldn\u2019t be cheering tomorrow night. Nay, by then every inch of their bodies would be screaming in agony, for the first full day of training with the seasoned warriors would be the most difficult day of their lives.</p><p>Nicholaa was coming down the first slope when she heard the shouts. Curious, she quickened her stride until she reached the bottom. She saw the crowd circling Justin and her husband then.</p><p>She tried not to be worried. Then Justin threw himself at Royce, and she almost cried out. Her brother had feigned the attack; he twisted away at the last possible minute and tried to kick Royce in the backs of his legs.</p><p>Royce deflected the blow and clipped Justin between his shoulder blades with the back of his hand. Nicholaa\u2019s brother staggered forward, quickly recovered, and then launched yet another attack.</p><p>Quite by accident, Justin got in one solid punch. His fist connected with Royce\u2019s jaw approximately five seconds after his baron noticed Nicholaa was observing the scene.</p><p>Royce instinctively struck back, knocking Justin to the ground. He moved forward, put his foot on Justin\u2019s chest to keep him down, then gave the soldier a most bizarre command.</p><p>\u201cSmile, Justin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Justin gasped, trying to regain his breath.</p><p>\u201cI said smile,\u201d Royce told him in a furious whisper. \u201cNow, damn it.\u201d</p><p>Justin smiled.</p><p>Nicholaa desperately tried not to interfere. But the sight of her brother sprawled on the ground, added to the fact that all the other soldiers were grinning, did made her forget her vow.</p><p>Justin\u2019s face was turned away from her. For that reason, she didn\u2019t see his smile.</p><p>\u201cRoyce, my brother has only one hand.\u201d</p><p>God help her, she hadn\u2019t meant to shout that reminder.</p><p>\u201cBut I have two,\u201d Royce called out.</p><p>Nicholaa had rushed forward, but she came to an abrupt stop when Royce shouted that cruel remark.</p><p>She stared at Royce. He winked at her. Then Justin turned to her. He started laughing. She took a step back, stopped, shook her head, and finally turned around and walked back up the hill.</p><p>Royce let out a sigh. He knew she didn\u2019t understand. He moved away from Justin and offered him his hand. Justin grabbed hold and was pulled to his feet.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve done well,\u201d he told Justin. \u201cAs a reward for striking me, you and the other three will join me for dinner.\u201d</p><p>Justin grinned. His cheeks were red when he moved back to stand with the other soldiers. Royce didn\u2019t know if the coloring was from exertion or his praise.</p><p>Royce clasped his hands behind his back and stared at the group. \u201cI have one last thing to say to you. You have all become friends, and that is as it should be, but when you fight with one another, you will give it your total concentration. You will not make allowances for anyone, for any reason. What you may perceive as kindness or protectiveness could very well get your friend killed in a real battle.\u201d</p><p>They all knew what he was talking about, Royce was sure of that. He addressed his next remarks to Justin. \u201cIn battle no allowances will be given because you have but one hand. For that reason, you can\u2019t be as good as the others. You have to be better.\u201d</p><p>Justin nodded. \u201cBaron, when will I know I\u2019m ready?\u201d</p><p>Royce smiled. \u201cYou\u2019ll just know, Justin. No one will have to tell you.\u201d</p><p>Lawrence stepped forward. \u201cTo celebrate the beginning of your training with the Hawks, perhaps our baron will let you watch a game of kickball.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Royce nodded. King William frowned on the game, for he felt it took away from the knights\u2019 primary responsibility of training for his army. Royce occasionally made an exception simply because he loved to play the brutal game. The objective was to move the leather-covered ball from one end of the field to the other. There was only one rule: the knights couldn\u2019t use their hands. The game always turned bloody, of course, which was yet another reason everyone loved to play.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll lead one team, Lawrence, and I\u2019ll take the other,\u201d Royce announced. \u201cWe\u2019ll start as soon as I\u2019ve talked to Nicholaa.\u201d</p><p>He and Lawrence turned to leave. Ingelram nudged Justin, and then the two of them hurried forward to block their baron\u2019s path.</p><p>\u201cBaron, why must we watch?\u201d Ingelram blurted out.</p> <p>Royce raised an eyebrow over that question. Then he shrugged. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to watch if you don\u2019t want to,\u201d he answered. \u201cYou\u2019re free to do whatever you want this afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat Ingelram means to say, Baron,\u201d Justin explained, \u201cis that we don\u2019t want to watch; we want to play. We have enough men for a team of our own, and we would welcome the opportunity to defeat the Hawks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019d be insulted if we made them play against Doves,\u201d Lawrence interjected.</p><p>Justin grinned. \u201cNot if you and the baron joined our team.\u201d</p><p>Royce laughed. \u201cThat\u2019s up to your commander,\u201d he announced with a nod in Lawrence\u2019s direction.</p> <p>His vassal was in the mood to be accommodating. He gave the unit permission. The soldiers immediately rushed toward the area they would use for their field. They were already planning their strategy.</p><p>\u201cDid you notice?\u201d Lawrence asked Royce when they were alone.</p><p>\u201cNotice what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJustin has not only become their spokesman,\u201d he explained. \u201cHe also considers himself one of them now. Don\u2019t you remember how he was when he first started? Everything was theirs, not his. A good change in attitude, wouldn\u2019t you say?\u201d</p><p>It was a simple statement, but Royce reacted as though he\u2019d just been struck. Hell, he thought to himself, he\u2019d been acting just like Justin. From the beginning the holding was his, not Nicholaa\u2019s; the servants belonged to him, not her . . . and after a time she\u2019d finally conceded.</p><p>He slapped Lawrence on the shoulder. \u201cYou\u2019ve made me realize an error,\u201d he told his vassal. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p> <p>Royce didn\u2019t give his vassal further explanation. He would go up to the keep to make certain Nicholaa wasn\u2019t too upset by what she\u2019d seen, but after supper he\u2019d sit her down and explain the changes he wanted. He wouldn\u2019t lecture her. No, no, he never lectured. He wouldn\u2019t stop talking, though, until he was certain she understood.</p><p>His wife had fully recovered from her initial reaction to seeing Justin fight with Royce. Her brother\u2019s wonderful smile still lingered in her mind. She had rushed inside the keep and hurried up the steps. She wanted to get to the bedchamber before she deliberately and blatantly broke rule number three.</p><p>Aye, she was going to weep. They would be tears of joy, but Royce wouldn\u2019t understand that if he happened to catch her.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going, my lady?\u201d Clarise called out to her. \u201cI\u2019ve a question to ask you about supper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot now, please,\u201d Nicholaa called back. \u201cI\u2019ll be back down in a few minutes. You may ask me then.\u201d</p><p>Clarise didn\u2019t want to wait. Cook was already peevish, and Clarise didn\u2019t want the woman\u2019s mood to sour any more than it already had. If that happened, everyone would suffer because supper would be ruined.</p><p>The servant rushed toward the steps and stopped Nicholaa just as she reached the landing. \u201cIt won\u2019t take but a minute of your time,\u201d she called out. \u201cCook wants to know if she should prepare the sweet berry tarts or the sugared apples. You won\u2019t be getting either unless you let her know right away,\u201d she warned.</p><p>Nicholaa leaned one hip against the railing while she considered her options. \u201cI believe we\u2019ll celebrate tonight. Have Cook prepare both.\u201d</p> <p>Nicholaa turned to go down the corridor, just as the wood and the railing gave way.</p><p>Clarise screamed. Nicholaa didn\u2019t have time to do more than gasp in surprise. She grabbed hold of a ledge as she started to fall and held on for dear life. The railing crashed to the floor below. Wood splintered in every direction. Clarise jumped back to get out of the way. She finally quit screaming, though, and went to help her mistress. \u201cDear God above, hold tight. I\u2019m coming up to help you. Don\u2019t look down, milady. You\u2019ll only panic if you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, don\u2019t come up here,\u201d Nicholaa shouted. \u201cYou\u2019ll fall through. Get my husband. Hurry, please. I can\u2019t hold on much longer.\u201d</p><p>The servant immediately changed directions. She\u2019d just reached the double doors when they were flung open and Royce strode inside.</p><p>Clarise didn\u2019t have to explain. Royce took it all in at once, the splintered wood scattered on the floor in front of him, a pair of feet dangling above. His heart almost failed him. He rushed forward to position himself below Nicholaa.</p><p>\u201cWhat in God\u2019s name are you doing?\u201d</p><p>His roar actually calmed her. Then his outrageous question penetrated her mind. God\u2019s truth, she almost laughed. \u201cWhat do you think I\u2019m doing?\u201d she called out. \u201cI\u2019m hanging from the ledge, you daft man.\u201d</p><p>Royce heard the threat of amusement in her voice, then decided that wasn\u2019t possible. His wife had to be terrified.</p><p>\u201cLet go, Nicholaa, and bend your knees. I\u2019ll catch you,\u201d he said in a calm, reasonable voice.</p><p>\u201cYes, Royce.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet go now, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>Nicholaa was so surprised by the endearment that she forgot to worry. She let go and simply waited for her husband to catch her.</p><p>He barely buckled under the weight as he caught her in his arms and held her close. Then he backed up several steps as a precaution against more of the wood crashing down on top of the two of them.</p><p>He was shaking by the time he\u2019d carried his wife into the great hall. Her near disaster had left him reeling. She could have broken her neck.</p><p>\u201cYou will not go upstairs again, Nicholaa. Do you hear me?\u201d</p><p>He was squeezing bruises into her arms when he issued that command. She would have given him her agreement immediately, but then he distracted her by kicking a stool out of his path. He sat down in a high-backed chair near the hearth and took several deep breaths. Nicholaa realized then how upset her husband was. Since he hadn\u2019t raised his voice, his distress was a bit of a revelation to her. \u201cYou were worried about me?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He scowled to let her know how foolish he thought that question was. \u201cI\u2019m going to have everything moved down here before this day is over. Don\u2019t you dare argue with me, Nicholaa. My mind\u2019s made up. You will not go abovestairs again.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cYou were worried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>One word, spoken in a harsh, clipped voice that absolutely thrilled her. He did care about her. His heart was slamming inside his chest, another telling indication. She heard it loud and clear when he roughly pressed her head against his chest.</p><p>The man really needed to calm down, she decided. The danger was over now. Nicholaa decided to turn his attention a bit.</p><p>\u201cRoyce, you really should tear your home down and build another one. I wonder why you hesitate.\u201d</p><p>He suddenly wanted to throttle her. \u201cIt isn\u2019t my home, and it isn\u2019t yours,\u201d he announced, carefully enunciating each word.</p><p>\u201cThen whose is it?\u201d she asked, thoroughly confused.</p><p>He lifted her off his lap and stood up. \u201cOurs,\u201d he snapped. \u201cEverything is ours, wife\u2014not mine, not yours, but ours. Got that?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. Damn, he never wanted to have another scare like that for the rest of his life. He roughly grabbed her shoulders and kissed her. Then he turned and walked out of the hall.</p><p>The need to pound his fists into something solid nearly overwhelmed him. A game of ball was just what he needed now. Once he\u2019d knocked a few of his soldiers to the ground, perhaps he\u2019d feel better. Then he walked past the pieces of the railing and knew that hitting a few men wouldn\u2019t be enough. He\u2019d have to fell the whole contingent.</p><p>Nicholaa wasn\u2019t sure what had just happened. She thought it might be significant, this change in her husband\u2019s attitude about ownership, but he\u2019d acted so furious that he\u2019d only confused her all the more.</p><p>Not ten minutes later a group of soldiers came inside. Within an hour they had emptied the upstairs. They placed Royce\u2019s bed in the corner of the great hall, though only after Thomas had checked to make certain the floor would support the weight. They placed Nicholaa\u2019s chest next to the headboard. The men took the rest of the furniture outside. Thomas stood by Nicholaa\u2019s side, watching. He explained that everything would be stored in huts until the baron made further decisions.</p><p>Nicholaa was disheartened over the lack of privacy. She asked Thomas if it was possible to fashion a screen around the bed, and he promised to accomplish that task before the day was over.</p><p>The soldier kept his word, too. Sturdy screens, made of panels of flat brown wood, were positioned around the corner.</p><p>Nicholaa didn\u2019t see Royce again until dinner. She was given quite a surprise when Justin and three other young soldiers walked into the hall right behind her husband. She was so pleased to see her brother again that she almost made a scene. She ran to hug her brother, but Royce intercepted her. He anchored her to his side by putting his arm around her shoulders.</p><p>When she got a good look at her brother, she was appalled by his condition. Justin\u2019s face was covered with cuts and bruises. Then she noticed that the other soldiers were in much the same shape.</p><p>Royce and Lawrence had a fair number of nicks and bruises, too. It took Nicholaa a good ten minutes to get a straight answer to how the men had come by the injuries. It took her even longer to accept the explanation that it had only been a game.</p><p>She tried not to pamper Justin during supper. She knew that would embarrass him. She also tried to pretend she was enjoying their stories of the brutal game they had played.</p><p>The four young soldiers, Justin included, ate like starving men, and when they weren\u2019t devouring the food, they were nudging one another and boasting.</p><p>They smiled, too. So did Justin. Real smiles. She looked at the four men. They were all quite alike, and Justin was just one of them now. He fit in. Aye, he belonged.</p><p>Oh, God, she was going to break that damn rule number three again if she didn\u2019t get hold of herself. The soldiers would never understand if she suddenly burst into tears. Royce wouldn\u2019t understand, either.</p><p>She needed to get out of the hall before she disgraced herself. Fortunately the men were so absorbed in recounting their moments of glory that they hardly noticed when she left them to their victories and went outside. She circled the courtyard, then walked down to the lower bailey.</p><p>There was so much to be thankful for. God had taken such good care of her when he\u2019d sent Royce to her.</p><p>Justin now had a future. Royce had given him that. Yes, there was much to be thankful for. She smiled then. If someone had dared to tell her a year ago that she would one day be hopelessly in love with a Norman, she would have been highly insulted. Now she felt blessed.</p><p>Royce cared about her, too. And that was enough for her. She would continue to be just the kind of wife he wanted. It was the least she could do to repay his kindness and his patience.</p><p>Nicholaa finished weeping and walked back up the hill. She spotted her husband when she reached the crest of the courtyard. Royce was standing on the top step watching her.</p><p>In the moonlight he resembled a giant statue. She stopped in the center of the courtyard. \u201cI\u2019m supposed to stand here with our children,\u201d she said, \u201cand wait for your return.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mother always did.\u201d She took a step closer.</p><p>\u201cWas this a specific duty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a habit,\u201d she answered. \u201cOne my father liked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat other habits did they have?\u201d</p><p>She took another step toward him. \u201cAfter supper every night they would play chess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we will do the same,\u201d he announced.</p><p>\u201cBut after dinner you always discuss the next day\u2019s plans with your soldiers,\u201d she reminded him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do that before dinner,\u201d he answered. \u201cYou and I will play chess together after.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would you adopt this habit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTraditions should be continued, or so my wife told me on our wedding night when she was trying to get me to kiss her.\u201d</p><p>She smiled again. \u201cYour wife now admits that was her true motive.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. His expression turned serious. \u201cI would like you to admit something else to me,\u201d he said, his voice gruff. \u201cAdmit you love me, Nicholaa. I would like to hear you say the words.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes immediately filled with tears. She bowed her head so he wouldn\u2019t see how upset she was. \u201cI do not wish to become a burden to you.\u201d</p><p>Royce went to his wife. He gathered her into his arms and held her tight. \u201cTelling me you love me will make you a burden to me?\u201d he asked, certain he couldn\u2019t have heard correctly.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He laughed then, a full, rich sound that filled the air around them. \u201cYou aren\u2019t ever going to make sense to me, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do love you.\u201d</p><p>He hadn\u2019t realized until she gave him the words how much he really needed to hear them. It was a miracle, this precious gift. He was humbled by it. A part of him, the thoroughly logical part, couldn\u2019t understand how she could possibly love him.</p><p>She was his miracle. His face was grossly disfigured by scars, but she noticed only the silver flecks in what she called his handsome eyes. He\u2019d always thought of himself as big, awkward, but she praised him because he was so wonderfully tall and strong. Nicholaa seemed blind to the truth, and he would thank God for that flaw for the rest of his life.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t said a word to her. She\u2019d waited, hoping, praying, but he hadn\u2019t given her the words she so desperately needed to hear.</p><p>\u201cSweetheart, tell me why you think you\u2019re a burden?\u201d</p><p>She burst into tears. \u201cBecause you had no choice about marrying me.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t quit smiling. He tucked her head under his chin so she wouldn\u2019t see his expression. He didn\u2019t want her to think he was laughing at her. He didn\u2019t want her to notice how misty his eyes were, either. But damn, the joy inside him was suddenly overwhelming. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAh, the choice,\u201d he whispered. \u201cYou\u2019ve been worrying about that for a long while, haven\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>She bumped his chin when she nodded.</p><p>\u201cNicholaa, hasn\u2019t it occurred to you that I could have left the hall before you made your choice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you couldn\u2019t have left,\u201d she whispered. \u201cOnly the married knights could leave. You didn\u2019t qualify.\u201d</p> <p>He tried a different approach. \u201cI could have said no to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you couldn\u2019t have,\u201d she argued. \u201cYou\u2019re too honorable. You felt responsible for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have it all figured out, don\u2019t you? Nothing I can say will change your mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuch as?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d already made up my mind to challenge for you? I never would have allowed anyone else to have you, Nicholaa.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re just being kind to me, Royce. You\u2019re always kind and patient with everyone.\u201d</p><p>He kissed the top of her head. He didn\u2019t know how to convince her he would have chosen her. He had made up his mind to challenge for her hand in marriage for the simple reason that he couldn\u2019t stand the thought of anyone else touching her.</p><p>She belonged to him. He\u2019d gotten used to her by the time they reached London. He was possessive by nature. Surely that was the reason he didn\u2019t want to let her go.</p><p>This loving business was confusing to him, though. Royce didn\u2019t even know if he was capable of loving her the way a husband should love a wife. He felt completely inadequate, unprepared.</p><p>It wouldn\u2019t be enough to tell her he felt content with her by his side. No, nothing he could say would convince her that, in his own way, he did care for her.</p><p>He decided he wouldn\u2019t say anything. He\u2019d find a way to show her instead.</p> <p>Chapter Sixteen</p><p>That was easier decided than accomplished. No matter how much thought he put into the task, Royce couldn\u2019t come up with a single plan to convince his wife he would have chosen her. It didn\u2019t stop him from trying, however.</p><p>It was maddening not to be able to make her believe him, but it was no more maddening than his wife\u2019s perpetual smile. If he hadn\u2019t been so happy she\u2019d finally spoken the words he wanted to hear, he would have been in complete despair.</p><p>He tried praising her. She praised him back. He kissed her whenever he got the chance. She eagerly kissed him back. It was the only time she wasn\u2019t wearing that serene smile, because his mouth was covering hers.</p><p>He even played chess with her. He was going to let her win, until he realized she already was winning; then he changed his mind. The game lasted into the early hours of the morning, and in the end, he didn\u2019t let her win at all.</p><p>She did that all by herself.</p><p>Afterward, while he was still reeling from his first defeat in years, she promised to let him win next time.</p><p>It got worse before it got better.</p> <p>It was late morning on a hot Monday when Royce came into the hall with Lawrence at his side. He noticed the fire blazing in the hearth right away. He felt as though he had walked into a furnace. Sweat dripped from his brow before he\u2019d crossed to the buttery where his wife was busy working.</p><p>\u201cNicholaa, it\u2019s hot as purgatory in here,\u201d he announced. \u201cWas there a particular reason for starting a fire?\u201d</p><p>She turned to smile at her husband. She was waving a square linen cloth in front of her face. She used the linen to mop her husband\u2019s brow while she explained. \u201cYou invited six additional soldiers to supper, and Cook needed the extra fire to prepare all the meat. I appreciate how pleasant you\u2019re being, husband.\u201d</p><p>When she\u2019d finished wiping her husband\u2019s forehead, she turned the cloth inside out and mopped Lawrence\u2019s brow. Surprised, he backed away. She followed him, finished her task, and then suggested they both go back outside.</p><p>Royce and Lawrence turned to do just that. They\u2019d reached the center of the great hall when Baron Guy\u2019s two inseparable vassals, Morgan and Henry, came inside.</p><p>Nicholaa decided to block open the front doors to allow a breeze inside. She walked out of the buttery just as Morgan was boasting.</p><p>\u201cOur baron has brought a full contingent of men with him to hunt down the last of the resisters. He\u2019s vowed to slaughter the lot before a fortnight has passed.\u201d</p><p>Nicholaa\u2019s face paled, but she kept her expression contained. Royce knew she was thinking about Thurston. Morgan followed Royce\u2019s gaze, spotted Nicholaa, and immediately bowed.</p><p>She didn\u2019t acknowledge the greeting. She simply stared at the vassal and waited to hear what else he had to say.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s our understanding that the leader of these resisters is your brother, Lady Nicholaa,\u201d Henry announced. \u201cIs that true?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps,\u201d she answered.</p><p>Morgan grinned. \u201cThen we should give you our condolences now,\u201d he said. \u201cOur baron is a compassionate man. I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll drop your brother\u2019s body here on his way back to London so you can give him a proper burial.\u201d</p><p>Royce\u2019s fist came down on the table. \u201cEnough,\u201d he ordered. \u201cTell me what message you bring and get out.\u201d</p><p>Henry had never seen Baron Royce lose his composure. The flash of temper stunned him. Morgan didn\u2019t seem worried at all. He was occupied scowling at Nicholaa.</p><p>She smiled back. \u201cI forgive you your poor manners,\u201d she said in a calm voice. \u201cJealousy makes you act that way.\u201d</p><p>Morgan opened his mouth to protest.</p><p>She raised her hand for silence. The look on her face showed her disdain. She took a step toward the knight. Morgan backed up nearly into the fireplace.</p><p>\u201cYou heard my husband\u2019s command. Tell him why you\u2019re here and then get out.\u201d</p><p>Morgan was too furious to see the duty done. He nodded to Henry, then turned to look at the fire. He noticed the chess pieces lined up on the mantel and absentmindedly took one into his hand to get a better look. He wasn\u2019t paying attention to what he was doing, though, for he was listening to Henry\u2019s message from the king as well.</p><p>\u201cKing William sends his greetings and his request for you to choose ten of your best men to engage in a celebration of games six weeks hence. You\u2019re also to select ten new soldiers because our overlord believes they should be allowed to join in the festivities. The king has one additional request,\u201d Henry muttered.</p><p>Royce folded his arms across his chest and scowled with impatience as he waited for Henry to finish.</p><p>\u201cBaron Royce is waiting to hear the rest,\u201d Lawrence snapped.</p><p>Henry nodded. \u201cOur king wants it known that he and his beloved wife insist Lady Nicholaa attend the celebration. She has won their affections, and they wish to see her again.\u201d The vassal sounded as though he was gargling with vinegar.</p><p>Nicholaa would have laughed if she hadn\u2019t been so worried about the chess piece Morgan was holding. She didn\u2019t dare order him to put the piece back for fear he\u2019d realize the importance to her and deliberately destroy it.</p><p>Henry bowed to Royce, then walked toward Nicholaa. \u201cPerhaps then, my lady, we will see who is first and who is second.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut we already know that, don\u2019t we?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Nicholaa couldn\u2019t stand still a minute longer. Watching Morgan fondling the chess piece was too upsetting. She walked over to the entrance. \u201cLawrence, please see the soldiers out. My husband did want them to leave right away.\u201d</p><p>Morgan turned to Royce. \u201cWe plan to crush your soldiers,\u201d he boasted. \u201cWe won\u2019t be defeated this time.\u201d</p><p>To emphasize his boast, he snapped the head off the chess piece, then tossed the black queen into the fire.</p><p>Until that minute Royce hadn\u2019t realized Morgan was holding the piece. He\u2019d been watching Nicholaa. He saw the look of anguish on her face and then saw the chess piece destroyed.</p><p>He let out a roar of fury. Morgan turned, surprised, as Royce moved like a bolt of lightning. It all happened too quickly for Nicholaa to react. One minute Morgan was standing there looking smug and arrogant, and the next he was sailing through the air like a disk.</p><p>Royce threw the big man a fair distance. Morgan went hurling past the table, then past the screen. He should have landed against the front wall. He didn\u2019t, though. He went through it. Nicholaa guessed the wall was riddled with rotten wood, too.</p><p>A gaping hole the size of a man\u2019s doubled-over body appeared in the very center of the wall, giving them a rather pleasant view of the courtyard beyond.</p><p>Nicholaa clasped a hand over her mouth in astonishment. She could see through the hole that Morgan was already staggering to his feet. Royce hadn\u2019t killed him. Henry came rushing towards her. He was obviously not going to give his friend assistance. Morgan couldn\u2019t seem to stand up straight. He kept falling back to his knees. She guessed he was a little dizzy.</p><p>She tried, but she couldn\u2019t stop herself from smiling. Henry noticed. He was so furious he was shaking. He stopped when he reached her side. \u201cYou chose the wrong baron to wed,\u201d he snarled.</p><p>Henry might have been able to control his anger if Nicholaa hadn\u2019t laughed. He wanted to strike her. Yet even in his rage he knew Royce would kill him if he touched Nicholaa. Still, the desire to rid her of her smile overwhelmed his caution. He tried to frighten her with words instead. \u201cYou\u2019ll be widowed before the games are finished,\u201d he muttered. \u201cYou really should have listened to the old hag and killed Royce when you had the chance. You would have saved us the trouble.\u201d</p><p>Nicholaa wouldn\u2019t let him bait her into losing her temper. Henry sounded like a little boy who hadn\u2019t gotten his way.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cDo leave, Henry. You\u2019re beginning to irritate me.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t waste another minute on the stupid man. Royce was her main concern now. Lord, she\u2019d never seen him lose his control this thoroughly. It was a little unnerving. He didn\u2019t seem to be finished with Morgan, either. When he turned and started for the doorway and she got a good look at the scowl on his face, she knew she\u2019d have to interfere. She didn\u2019t want him to kill Morgan. The soldier\u2019s death wouldn\u2019t be worth the explanation Royce would have to give the king. Besides, she didn\u2019t want Morgan\u2019s body buried on their land.</p><p>Royce had almost reached her when she blurted out, \u201cWe have a lovely breeze now, husband. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, passed her, then suddenly stopped. He turned around. \u201cWhat did you just say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thanked you for the window.\u201d</p><p>Lawrence started to laugh. Nicholaa smiled. Royce closed his eyes and let out a loud sigh. \u201cI\u2019m not going to kill the bastard,\u201d he announced.</p><p>\u201cNo, of course not,\u201d she agreed. \u201cThe chess piece is gone. Killing Morgan won\u2019t change that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just wanted to break a leg or two, Nicholaa.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d sounded so reasonable when he confessed that plan to her. He grinned, too.</p><p>\u201cNothing will be gained by breaking his legs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll gain immense satisfaction,\u201d he countered.</p><p>She shook her head.</p><p>He scowled. Then he gave up. The woman had her mind set on getting her way. He wouldn\u2019t disappoint her. He glanced at the fire, then back to Nicholaa. \u201cSweetheart, which piece was it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe black queen.\u201d</p><p>His shoulders slumped. That was the piece her father had made a nick in while laughing over one of his stories.</p><p>Royce felt responsible for the disaster. He should have been watching Morgan\u2019s every move. He could have prevented the destruction if he\u2019d been paying more attention.</p><p>He roughly pulled Nicholaa into his arms. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he whispered. \u201cIt\u2019s my fault. I should have\u2014\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t let him finish. \u201cIt happened too quickly for you to prevent it.\u201d She patted his chest and kissed his chin. \u201cDon\u2019t frown so. It\u2019s over and done.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t believe she was soothing him. \u201cYou\u2019re taking this loss remarkably well,\u201d he told her.</p><p>Nicholaa kept right on smiling. It took her a good five minutes to get him to leave the hall. She stood in the open doorway until Royce and Lawrence had crossed the courtyard.</p><p>\u201cIs Nicholaa still standing there?\u201d Royce asked Lawrence.</p><p>The vassal turned around to look. \u201cNo, Baron. She\u2019s gone.\u201d</p><p>Royce immediately changed directions. \u201cI\u2019ve a suspicious nature,\u201d he told his vassal. \u201cMy wife took Morgan\u2019s treachery rather well, wouldn\u2019t you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, she did.\u201d</p><p>Royce smiled. \u201cA little too well, I think. He rounded the corner and went to the ladder leading to the walkway near the top of the wall. Then he leaned against the slats and waited.</p><p>He didn\u2019t have to stand there very long. Nicholaa came flying around the corner, her skirts raised above her ankles to quicken her speed. She came to an abrupt stop when she spotted her husband lounging against the ladder.</p><p>Nicholaa hid her hands behind her back and smiled sweetly at her husband. He smiled back. He didn\u2019t take his gaze off his wife when he ordered Lawrence to return to his duties, and as soon as the vassal had walked away, he motioned Nicholaa closer with the crook of his finger.</p><p>Royce waited until she was standing directly in front of him. Then he put his hand out.</p><p>She lost her smile and backed up a step.</p><p>\u201cFair\u2019s fair, Nicholaa,\u201d he announced. \u201cIf I can\u2019t hurt him, neither can you. Give it to me.\u201d</p><p>She looked thoroughly disgruntled. \u201cHow did you know?\u201d</p><p>He touched the mark on his forehead. \u201cI used logic.\u201d</p><p>She put the leather sling in his outstretched hand. She dropped the two stones on the ground.</p><p>\u201cYou thought you might miss with the first stone?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI never miss. The other was for Henry.\u201d</p><p>He started laughing. She didn\u2019t know what to make of that. She took another step back.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve taken you away from your duties long enough,\u201d she announced. Her disappointment over not being able to give Morgan and Henry a proper send-off still chafed. She wanted to shout at her husband because he wouldn\u2019t let her have her way. She stared at the sling dangling from his fingers, took a deep breath, and then said, \u201cI shall try to keep my temper under control.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes that mean you\u2019ll smile even more often?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod help me.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze flew to his. \u201cHe already helped me,\u201d she whispered. \u201cHe gave me you.\u201d</p><p>She always took him by surprise when she said such incredibly wonderful things to him. He pulled away from the ladder, took hold of his wife\u2019s hand, and started walking toward the castle. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>They walked side by side without saying a word to each other. She thought he was taking her back to the great hall so he could sit her down and lecture her.</p><p>Yet when they reached the table and the chairs, he didn\u2019t let go of her hand. He just continued tugging her along toward the screens that hid their bed.</p><p>He stopped to look out the hole he\u2019d made with Morgan\u2019s body, then turned to wink at Nicholaa. \u201cNice view, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRoyce, where are you taking me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTo bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRoyce, this isn\u2019t like you,\u201d she blurted out. \u201cYou never stray from your plans for the day. It\u2019s . . . disorganized.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d sounded appalled. He pulled her into his arms. \u201cSpontaneous actions are just as important as planned ones, wife. You really should leave a little room in your life for surprises.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI must learn\u2014\u201d</p><p>He wrapped his arms around her waist and lifted her off the floor. His mouth came down on hers just as she was putting her arms around his neck.</p><p>Ingelram, Justin, and their commander, Lawrence, were passing the hole in the front wall. They were all given quite a surprise at seeing their baron kissing his wife.</p><p>Lawrence smiled. Ingelram nudged Justin in his ribs and let out a hoot of laughter. Justin took the longest to react. He turned to his commander, caught his grin, and then said, \u201cMy sister must love her husband.\u201d</p><p>Lawrence nodded. \u201cHer husband loves her just as much.\u201d</p><p>Justin smiled. He wasn\u2019t going to worry about his sister any longer. She\u2019d found her place in this new Norman world, just as he had.</p> <p>Ingelram nudged him again. Justin immediately turned his attention to tripping his friend.</p><p>Lawrence grabbed both soldiers by the nape of the neck and shoved them forward. His baron obviously wanted privacy, and Lawrence was going to see that he got it.</p><p>Royce gathered the soldiers together and told them about the message from King William. Although every man present wanted to be one of the twenty chosen for the battle games, none dared ask for the honor. They knew they would have to wait until he was ready to tell them.</p><p>The next evening during dinner Nicholaa noticed several cuts on her husband\u2019s hands. She asked him about the nicks, but he only shrugged and changed the subject. She thought he didn\u2019t remember how he\u2019d come by the cuts.</p><p>Royce looked exhausted. He was too tired to play chess after the table was cleared. He wasn\u2019t too tired to make love to her, though.</p><p>She awakened in the middle of the night. She moved toward Royce and nearly slid off his side of the bed before she realized he wasn\u2019t there.</p><p>She put on her robe and went to find her husband. She didn\u2019t have to go far. Royce was sitting at the head of the table concentrating so hard on what he was doing that he didn\u2019t notice her.</p><p>Royce had a small block of wood in his hands. In the flickering candlelight she could see the white queen on the table in front of him. Royce held the block of wood near the bottom in his left hand. He held a small knife in his other hand and was hard at work carving away slivers from the top. He would occasionally look up at the queen, then turn back to the block of wood.</p> <p>He was making another black queen for her.</p><p>She understood then where all the cuts had come from. She understood why her husband looked so exhausted, too. But most of all, she understood something else: Royce loved her.</p><p>Nicholaa didn\u2019t move for a long while. Tears streamed down her cheeks as she watched her husband. She smiled each time he muttered an expletive, for she knew he\u2019d nicked his hand again.</p><p>She heard the door open and immediately moved back behind the screen. She peeked around the corner and saw Justin striding toward Royce. Her brother held a small dagger in his hand.</p><p>Royce didn\u2019t even look up. Nicholaa guessed he\u2019d been expecting Justin. Her brother looked just as haggard as Royce did. Had he been staying up each night to help with this project?</p><p>\u201cThis was my father\u2019s knife,\u201d Justin whispered. \u201cIt should work much better, Baron.\u201d</p><p>Justin sat down on the stool next to Royce. He put the knife down and then took hold of the base of the wooden block. Justin wore a strip of black leather over his hand. When Nicholaa saw the way Royce was awkwardly cutting with the knife, she realized the leather was a necessary precaution.</p><p>Nicholaa wiped the tears away from her eyes and quietly walked over to join the two men she loved with all her heart.</p><p>\u201cNicholaa\u2019s going to be surprised,\u201d Justin whispered.</p><p>\u201cI hope she\u2019s pleased,\u201d Royce whispered back.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m both surprised and pleased,\u201d Nicholaa whispered.</p><p>Her brother jumped at the sound of her voice. Royce flinched. He nicked the neck of the barely formed statue. \u201cNow look what you\u2019ve made me do, wife,\u201d Royce grumbled.</p><p>She leaned over her husband\u2019s shoulder to see the damage. She started laughing then. It was the most lopsided, ill-fashioned chess piece she\u2019d ever seen. The head was bigger than the body, and the neck was thrice the size of the white queen\u2019s.</p><p>She loved it. Especially the hole in the side of the neck. She leaned down to kiss her husband, then sat down opposite the men.</p><p>\u201cYou must remember that nick, husband, so you can tell our children how it happened.\u201d</p><p>She suspected that Royce was embarrassed because he\u2019d been caught doing such a sweet, tenderhearted task for his wife.</p><p>Nicholaa felt like crying again. Dear heavens, how she loved this man.</p><p>Her gaze turned to Justin\u2019s. He winked at her. She thought he might have noticed the color in Royce\u2019s face, too, or perhaps he\u2019d noticed how misty her eyes were.</p><p>\u201cJustin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love Royce.\u201d</p><p>Her brother smiled. \u201cI already knew you did, Nicholaa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe way you look at him.\u201d</p><p>She turned to see Royce\u2019s reaction to their conversation. Her husband was bent over the table, diligently laboring over the half-formed statue. But he was smiling, too.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something else you should know, Justin,\u201d Nicholaa said then. \u201cRoyce loves me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI already knew that, too,\u201d Justin announced with a laugh.</p><p>Royce dropped the knife and turned to look at Nicholaa. He stared at her for a long minute. \u201cYou\u2019re certain I love you?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. He sighed, too. \u201cThen you\u2019ll quit this infernal smiling all the time? God, Nicholaa, it\u2019s driving me crazy.\u201d</p><p>Justin looked incredulous. Nicholaa burst into laughter. \u201cI was only trying to be the kind of wife you wanted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNicholaa, aren\u2019t you supposed to smile?\u201d Justin asked, trying to make sense out of the conversation.</p><p>Royce didn\u2019t take his gaze away from his beautiful wife\u2019s face when he said, \u201cJustin, go away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Baron,\u201d Justin answered with a grin.</p><p>Nicholaa stood up when her brother did. She picked up one of the candles and slowly walked back to the bed. She put the candle down on the chest and waited for Royce to come to her.</p><p>He went to the other side of the bed. In the flickering candlelight, she watched him disrobe.</p><p>He was such a handsome man. There was such strength in him, such power. And such gentleness, too. Nicholaa took off her robe and dropped it on the floor, staring at her husband all the while.</p><p>\u201cI love you so much, Royce.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, too.\u201d</p><p>They met in the center of the bed on their knees, facing each other. His hands grasped her hips. Her arms were wrapped around his neck.</p><p>She kissed his chest, his chin, his scar. Royce wasn\u2019t in the mood to let her tease him. His hand became a fist in her hair. He jerked her head back with a low growl of longing. His mouth covered hers. Their tongues met, rubbed against each other. He growled again. She sighed.</p><p>He pulled her down to the bed. He covered her with his body and then began to kiss every inch of her. He was such a gentle, patient lover . . . until she became so wild and demanding she made him forget his control. His need consumed him then.</p><p>He moved between her thighs and slowly eased into her tight sheath. The ache intensified, burned with raw pleasure, and when he was finally fully one with her he was able to slow down for just a minute, long enough to tell her all the love words he\u2019d held inside himself for so long.</p><p>Nicholaa only caught snatches here and there, for she was telling him all the tender words of love she\u2019d stored inside her heart for so long.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t long before their feelings overwhelmed them and speech became impossible. The bed rocked from their lovemaking. Royce\u2019s thrusts were slow, controlled, until she came apart in his arms and squeezed him tight. He went wild then. He shouted her name when he poured his seed into her.</p><p>And still he stayed inside her. She wept against his neck, and once he understood they were tears of joy, he didn\u2019t mind at all.</p><p>Nicholaa fell asleep listening to her husband\u2019s whispers of love in her ear.</p><p>Royce reached over to put the candle out, then gathered his wife into his arms again. He could feel her warmth.</p><p>He closed his eyes and smiled. He could feel the contentment, too. It was there, in his wife\u2019s arms. Her love gave him such strength.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t a man given to prayer, but he got out a grumbled thank-you to his Maker before he fell asleep. He touched the scar on his face, and then he smiled again.</p><p>Nicholaa was wrong. God wasn\u2019t on her side. He was on theirs.</p><p>Chapter Seventeen</p><p>His impossible, stubborn-to-her-soul wife was back in full evidence the following day. It wasn\u2019t even noon before they had their first argument. Thomas had drawn the design for their new home, using all of his baron\u2019s specifications of course, and when Royce graciously allowed Nicholaa to look over the plan, she announced that it simply wouldn\u2019t do.</p><p>She waved her hand toward the area reserved for the kitchens and told him they\u2019d need twice the amount of space. She frowned over the gigantic area he\u2019d reserved for the soldiers\u2019 quarters he planned to put on the lower level. He\u2019d accidentally left out a buttery, too. He didn\u2019t think they really needed it anyway. Nicholaa thought otherwise.</p><p>He finally had to sit her down and discuss each of her opinions. She let him talk without once interrupting, but it didn\u2019t take him long to realize she was daydreaming again. God, she was maddening. Damned invigorating, too. She finally agreed he was right on every single point. He went back to his duties feeling content. Nicholaa waited until her husband had whistled his way across the courtyard, then called Thomas back inside to give him the new, corrected specifications. She added a large buttery to the plan, extended the kitchens and the size of the hearth, and increased the master bedchamber to twice the original size.</p><p>Royce was terribly busy the rest of the week. He told Nicholaa he\u2019d decided not to choose the soldiers who would participate in the king\u2019s games. He would set up feats of strength instead, and the top ten soldiers from each division would earn the honor on their own.</p><p>Nicholaa thought that was more than fair. She was pleased, too, that her husband had begun to include her when he discussed his plans with Lawrence. Yet as the second week progressed, Royce became more and more withdrawn. Whenever the topic of the competition came up, he would either change the subject or simply stop talking.</p><p>Something was worrying her husband, but he wasn\u2019t ready to tell her what it was. Nicholaa was learning to be patient. In time she was certain he\u2019d sort it all out in his mind and then confide in her.</p><p>Four weeks remained before they would leave for the games. Royce finally confided in Nicholaa. It was a warm Sunday evening. Royce asked Nicholaa to sit down. He didn\u2019t look enthusiastic, as he usually did when he was about to launch into a lecture. No, he looked terribly serious, and if she hadn\u2019t known better, she would have thought he looked worried, too.</p><p>He didn\u2019t pace, either. He stood in front of the hearth with his hands clasped behind his back.</p><p>Royce didn\u2019t want to look at Nicholaa when he gave her his news. The fear he was sure to see in her expression would tear at his heart.</p><p>\u201cNicholaa,\u201d he began in a brisk, no-nonsense voice. \u201cAs you know, I allowed my men to compete against one another, and those most skilled would earn the honor of representing me . . . that is to say,\u201d he corrected, \u201cthe honor of representing us.\u201d</p><p>Nicholaa was beginning to get worried. She\u2019d never seen her husband act this hesitant before. She folded her hands in her lap, straightened her shoulders, and forced herself to wait until he told her the rest.</p><p>Long minutes passed before Royce spoke again. \u201cIt\u2019s finished now,\u201d he announced. \u201cThe men all know who the ten from each division are. It can\u2019t be undone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, of course not,\u201d she agreed.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cEach unit will have nine soldiers and one commander. Lawrence easily won the honor of becoming commander over the experienced soldiers.\u201d</p><p>He went into great detail outlining Lawrence\u2019s strengths. Then he finally turned the topic to the Doves. \u201cNine soldiers were above all the others in every competition. There was one, however, whose expertise put him well above the others. He was quite exceptional.\u201d</p><p>Nicholaa had already guessed that Ingelram had earned the honor of becoming commander. Bryan might also be one of the ten. She thought she understood then. Royce was going to leave Justin behind, and he was concerned about her brother\u2019s feelings. Justin would have to accept this decision, of course. It would probably sting his pride to watch his friends leave for the games. Still, Nicholaa thought he had quite a lot to be thankful for, and if she had to, she\u2019d sit him down and tell him so.</p><p>Royce turned away from the hearth and walked over to Nicholaa. He pulled her to her feet, took her hands, and said, \u201cJustin has earned the right to command the unit.\u201d He braced himself for her tears.</p><p>She looked incredulous. She shook her head. It was obvious she didn\u2019t believe him. \u201cYou can\u2019t be serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m very serious,\u201d he answered. \u201cHe earned the right, wife.\u201d</p><p>She pulled her hands away from his and collapsed into the chair. She was suddenly so frightened for her brother that her stomach started aching. She was furious with Royce, too. How could he have let this happen?</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d she whispered. \u201cJustin isn\u2019t ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, he is ready,\u201d he countered. \u201cHe was quite exceptional in the competition,\u201d he told her again. There was a noticeable tinge of pride in his voice. \u201cYou should be very proud of him, Nicholaa. I am.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t want him to participate,\u201d she cried out. \u201cIt\u2019s too soon. He needs further instruction.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNicholaa, look at me,\u201d he commanded.</p><p>When she looked up, he saw the tears in her eyes. He let out a long sigh. \u201cDo you have faith in me?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She was surprised by that question, and yet after a minute or two of reasoning, she understood why he\u2019d asked it. That was what it all came down to, wasn\u2019t it? Either she believed in her husband or she didn\u2019t.</p> <p>Royce stood by his wife\u2019s side and patiently waited for her to sort it all out in her mind. He was a little irritated when she didn\u2019t immediately answer him. He understood her hesitation, however. Her fear was clouding her judgment. Still, he knew what her answer would be.</p><p>She finally nodded. \u201cYes, I do have faith in you.\u201d She stared at the tabletop when she admitted that truth. Then she turned her gaze up to his so that he could see her frown. \u201cAnd now you\u2019re going to tell me I must also have complete faith in all your decisions, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>He gave her a smile. She couldn\u2019t sit still for another minute. She stood up just as Royce sat down. \u201cDo you believe that because I have faith in you I must also have faith in Justin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he answered. He folded his arms across his chest and stared at her. \u201cYou should, however, have complete faith in my judgment.\u201d</p><p>God, how she hated it when he was so logical. They were talking about her brother, not an outsider, and for that simple reason she was letting her emotions control her thoughts.</p> <p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t it be undone?\u201d she blurted out.</p><p>\u201cThat question doesn\u2019t deserve an answer, wife.\u201d</p><p>Her shoulders slumped. \u201cI imagine Justin\u2019s pleased with this honor, isn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>Royce nodded. He flashed a quick grin, then forced a serious expression when Nicholaa\u2019s frown intensified. \u201cJustin\u2019s strutting around like a rooster now. Ingelram and Bryan also won the right to participate. They\u2019re strutting, too.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t amused by the picture he\u2019d painted. \u201cThey\u2019re boys,\u201d she cried out. \u201cRoyce, they could get killed.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. He would have pulled her onto his lap and comforted her if she hadn\u2019t backed away from him. He decided she wasn\u2019t quite ready to be soothed yet. She needed time to feel angry first.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re men, Nicholaa. They\u2019re young, yes, but still men, not boys.\u201d</p><p>Nicholaa realized she was wringing her hands and immediately clasped them behind her back.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps you\u2019ll stop worrying after I\u2019ve told you just how exceptional your brother was when he competed for his place,\u201d Royce suggested.</p><p>She shrugged. He hid his smile. He knew she wanted to scream at him. She didn\u2019t, though. She was trying to accept his decision, and that pleased him very much. She\u2019d never seen Justin train with the others and couldn\u2019t possibly know he\u2019d developed into quite a warrior.</p><p>Royce knew, though. He\u2019d been with Justin day in and day out, demanding perfection. Justin had measured up, the honor now belonged to him, and by God, despite Nicholaa\u2019s resistance, Royce wouldn\u2019t take that privilege away.</p><p>He patiently explained each test the soldiers were put through and told how Justin had met every challenge. In truth, he was fairly bursting with pride by the time he\u2019d finished telling Nicholaa about the feats. And when he was done, he again told her it couldn\u2019t be undone.</p><p>\u201cThis announcement caught me by surprise,\u201d she announced. \u201cI do have faith in you, and for that reason I assume you\u2019ve considered every possibility. Do you believe the men who go up against my brother will fight fairly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he answered. \u201cThey\u2019ll do whatever it takes to win, Nicholaa.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEven if that means trying to break Justin\u2019s one hand to make him completely vulnerable? Even if they use their swords to try to cut his hand off?\u201d</p><p>She was shaking with fear by the time she\u2019d spoken those dark possibilities aloud. Royce leaned back in the chair and stared at her. \u201cEven then,\u201d he agreed.</p><p>Odd, but his casual agreement eased her fear just a little. He\u2019d obviously thought about those possibilities, too.</p><p>She started pacing. \u201cI imagine you\u2019ve told Justin what to expect. You\u2019ve surely warned him about Baron Guy\u2019s soldiers.\u201d Nicholaa didn\u2019t wait for his agreement but continued. \u201cAlthough you won\u2019t admit it, you must be a bit worried. I\u2019m worried, too, but I guess it doesn\u2019t matter how we feel. We\u2019ll have to keep our concern hidden from Justin.\u201d She threaded her fingers through her hair, then blurted out, \u201cRoyce, if you doubt he\u2019s completely ready, then help him.\u201d</p><p>He was having difficulty following her. In the space of a few minutes she\u2019d done a complete turnaround. She was now trying to persuade him not to worry.</p><p>She resumed her pacing. \u201cYou\u2019ve given Justin back his pride,\u201d she told him. \u201cYou can\u2019t take that away now.\u201d</p><p>Royce continued to listen to her reasons for accepting this decision and it suddenly dawned on him that Nicholaa wasn\u2019t just repeating what he\u2019d already told her.</p><p>She was actually lecturing him.</p><p>He waited until her pacing brought her close enough, then reached out and grabbed her. He settled her on his lap and kissed her.</p><p>\u201cYou please me, wife,\u201d he announced gruffly.</p><p>\u201cWill I please you when I tell you I won\u2019t stop being afraid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he answered. \u201cBecause I know you won\u2019t intervene, and I know you\u2019ll hide your fear from your brother.\u201d</p><p>She clasped his face. \u201cMake certain he\u2019s ready,\u201d she whispered. \u201cTeach him all the deceitful tricks they\u2019ll use. If anyone knows how to fight unfairly, it\u2019s you, husband.\u201d</p><p>He raised an eyebrow. \u201cThank you . . . I think. That was a compliment, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes,\u201d she replied. \u201cYou didn\u2019t fight fairly when you tricked me into leaving the abbey. Had I known then what a soft heart you had, I would have realized Ulric was safer with you than with anyone else in England. Yes, you used cunning then. It certainly wasn\u2019t fair of you to trick me that way.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her again, a long, wet, hot kiss that left them both shaking. Lawrence\u2019s discreet cough made Royce reluctantly pull away.</p><p>Nicholaa looked flustered. She jumped off her husband\u2019s lap, smoothed her hair and her skirts, and smiled at the vassal. \u201cI understand you\u2019re going to lead the experienced soldiers in William\u2019s games. Congratulations, Lawrence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, my lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe must have a special dinner tonight,\u201d she said. She turned to Royce. \u201cCould Justin join us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he does, the others must also be invited.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cCook\u2019s going to pitch a tantrum when I tell her we\u2019re having twenty guests.\u201d</p><p>Her husband shook his head. \u201cTwenty-four,\u201d he corrected. \u201cTwo extra men from each division will go along as reserves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReserves?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just a precaution, Nicholaa,\u201d he explained, \u201cin case one or two are injured.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr become too ill to compete?\u201d</p><p>He knew from the eagerness in her voice what she was thinking . . . and probably hoping. \u201cJustin isn\u2019t going to get injured or become ill. Do not waste your time praying he will, wife.\u201d</p><p>She frowned at him. \u201cI would never pray for such a thing,\u201d she muttered. She turned to the vassal, forced a smile, and said, \u201cLawrence, my husband must learn to have a little more faith in me. Still, he has other redeeming qualities, and so I forgive him his flaws.\u201d</p><p>The vassal didn\u2019t know how to respond to that remark. He did notice his baron was looking surprised. Then Nicholaa drew his attention again when she asked if he would order a few of the soldiers to bring the other table up from the floor below.</p><p>As soon as he\u2019d given her his agreement, she hurried toward the back of the castle. Nicholaa knew that the sooner she gave Cook the bad news, the sooner she could get over her tantrum and down to the business of preparing a fine meal.</p><p>It turned out to be a festive occasion. Royce was right when he said Justin strutted. So did the other young soldiers. The older knights took it all in stride. They were dignified. But they smiled all through dinner, too.</p><p>Justin was asked to stay after the dinner was finished. He thought his baron wanted him to assist him with the statue again.</p><p>Royce wasn\u2019t in the mood to work on the project tonight, however. \u201cBeginning tomorrow I will set aside two hours each day to instruct you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith the others on my team?\u201d Justin asked.</p><p>It was Lawrence who answered him. \u201cOf course, Justin,\u201d he said. \u201cYour baron is simply respecting the chain of command when he tells you his plans, because you earned the right to lead your team. Tomorrow you will relay this message to your men.\u201d</p><p>Justin smiled. \u201cI understand.\u201d He turned his gaze to his sister. \u201cNicholaa, what are you looking at?\u201d he asked. He\u2019d noticed she was frowning intently and staring at his arm.</p><p>\u201cYour scars,\u201d she answered immediately. \u201cThey aren\u2019t still tender, are they?\u201d</p><p>Since she\u2019d asked the question so casually, Justin was hard pressed to take exception. \u201cNo, they aren\u2019t tender.\u201d</p><p>Nicholaa nodded. \u201cLawrence told me that you put on a leather covering with loops to slip over your shoulder, and Royce made you take it off. His reason was that the opponent could use the loops to pin you down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s true,\u201d Justin acknowledged.</p><p>\u201cWho made that covering for you?\u201d Nicholaa asked.</p><p>\u201cBryan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he very clever?\u201d</p><p>Royce interrupted then. \u201cYou aren\u2019t thinking to ask Bryan to make the black queen, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, of course not,\u201d she rushed out before her husband\u2019s feelings could become injured. \u201cYou must finish the black queen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was just considering ways to be devious,\u201d she said. \u201cI also have a cunning mind.\u201d</p><p>Royce laughed. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to convince me, Sister Danielle,\u201d he drawled out.</p><p>Lawrence laughed, for he\u2019d heard the tale how Nicholaa posed as a nun. He recounted the story for Justin\u2019s benefit.</p><p>Nicholaa drummed her fingertips on the tabletop until the laughter had subsided, then turned to Royce again. \u201cYour worry was that the opponent would grab hold of the leather, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. She smiled. \u201cI think you should let them.\u201d</p><p>Lawrence and Justin didn\u2019t know what she was getting at. Royce caught on right away. He laughed. \u201cYes,\u201d he said then. \u201cWe should let them.\u201d He turned to look at Justin. \u201cShe\u2019s talking about a surprise,\u201d he explained. \u201cSomething sharp sewn into the leather that would even the odds.\u201d</p><p>Nicholaa was already blushing. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t normally consider such trickery, but if someone is going to grab your arm to hold you down, I do believe a few blades in the leather would be a just reward.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo and put the possibility to Bryan,\u201d Royce told Nicholaa\u2019s brother.</p><p>Justin immediately stood up, winked at his sister, and then hurried out of the hall.</p><p>\u201cRoyce, you won\u2019t be taking part in the games, will you?\u201d Nicholaa asked.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cThe men act in my stead,\u201d he explained. \u201cWhen they win, I win.\u201d</p><p>She was warmed by his arrogance. He hadn\u2019t said if he won but when he won, and she knew he believed his soldiers would be victorious no matter what challenges they faced.</p><p>Nicholaa turned her attention to Lawrence. The look of worry on her face surprised the vassal. She took his hand. That surprised him even more.</p><p>\u201cLawrence,\u201d she said, \u201cMorgan and Henry are going to try to hurt Royce at the games. You\u2019ll have to keep your guard up at all times. If they can\u2019t get to him, they\u2019ll hurt you.\u201d</p><p>The warning wasn\u2019t necessary. Lawrence was well aware of Morgan\u2019s and Henry\u2019s black hearts. \u201cYou mustn\u2019t worry, my lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, but I do worry.\u201d She squeezed his hand affectionately and then let go when she caught her husband\u2019s frown.</p><p>\u201cHow would you know what they plan to do?\u201d Royce asked.</p><p>\u201cHenry told me,\u201d she answered. \u201cHe wants to get even with you. He\u2019s still angry because I didn\u2019t choose to wed his baron. I can\u2019t imagine why he thought I\u2019d prefer Guy to you.\u201d</p><p>She sounded so bewildered that Lawrence couldn\u2019t help smiling. Her love for Royce was evident.</p><p>\u201cHenry\u2019s jealous,\u201d she said. \u201cHe had the gall to bring up that sorry incident with the woman who told me to kill Royce. It was rude of him to mention it.\u201d</p><p>She let out a sigh, then dismissed Henry from her thoughts. She stood up, intent on helping Clarise clear the table. She wanted to praise Cook one last time too, for doing such a fine job of feeding all the men such a wonderful meal.</p><p>Royce grabbed her hand and forced her to sit down again.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t shown any reaction to her remarks about Guy\u2019s vassals. He seemed interested now, however. \u201cTell me when Henry said these things to you,\u201d he ordered.</p><p>\u201cIt was right after you tossed Morgan through the wall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe specifically mentioned the woman who threatened you when we were in London?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she answered. \u201cHe was trying to frighten me, I suppose,\u201d she said. \u201cIt didn\u2019t work, though. Are you finished with your questions, husband? I really must thank Cook again before I forget.\u201d As soon as he gave her permission, Nicholaa hurried out of the room.</p><p>Royce waited until he and Lawrence were alone. \u201cDamn interesting, wouldn\u2019t you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHenry and Morgan could have heard about the incident,\u201d Lawrence interjected.</p><p>\u201cThe king wanted it kept quiet, remember? He didn\u2019t want the celebration tainted. Only a handful knew what happened, and Baron Guy wasn\u2019t one of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut after we left London and the celebration was over, someone could have mentioned it,\u201d Lawrence said.</p><p>Royce shook his head. \u201cThe king was furious to learn that someone had actually breached his home. He took it as a personal insult, and he didn\u2019t want the news to spread. No, word didn\u2019t get out, Lawrence. There\u2019s something else, too,\u201d he added with a scowl. \u201cWhen Nicholaa\u2019s older brother came here, I questioned him about the activities of the resisters in London. Thurston didn\u2019t know what I was talking about. I believed then and I believe now that it was an honest reaction on his part. He was too surprised. Damn it, my opinion is that Morgan and Henry sent that messenger to Nicholaa.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Lawrence nodded. \u201cThat is my opinion, too,\u201d he admitted. \u201cDid they act on their own or did Guy have a hand in this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d Royce\u2019s voice turned as hard and as cold as ice. \u201cHe\u2019s responsible for his vassals\u2019 actions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Lawrence agreed. \u201cStill, I\u2019d like to know if he had a part in this treachery. I\u2019m curious to know how far his malice extends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe won\u2019t have long to wait. In just a few weeks we\u2019ll have our answer.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd then we retaliate.\u201d Lawrence hadn\u2019t asked a question but simply stated a fact. He\u2019d served his baron long enough to understand how his mind worked.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to take care of Morgan and Henry,\u201d Royce said.</p><p>\u201cWith pleasure, Baron.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn, I wish I could fight the two of them.\u201d</p><p>Lawrence understood his baron\u2019s frustration. The king would never allow a baron to fight another baron\u2019s vassals in games of strength. It would be beneath his station. It was therefore up to Lawrence to right the treachery. And, Lord, how he was looking forward to the opportunity.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s still Baron Guy,\u201d Lawrence said, reminding Royce he wouldn\u2019t be completely left out.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Royce replied. \u201cThat bastard\u2019s all mine.\u201d</p><p>The following weeks of preparation proved to be a torment for Nicholaa, and an enlightenment, too.</p><p>The torment came first. Nicholaa had to pretend to be happy whenever she ran into Justin or one of his friends. She also had to pretend she wasn\u2019t worried and didn\u2019t doubt her husband\u2019s judgment when she was with him.</p><p>There was a price to be paid for her feigned happiness. By keeping all her fears hidden, she made herself sick. Each morning when she opened her eyes, she was so sick to her stomach she could barely get out of bed.</p><p>The nausea would dissipate after an hour or two. She thought it was because once she was wide awake, she was able to push her fears away. She couldn\u2019t soothe her nerves when she was sleeping, however. She was vulnerable then.</p> <p>And then enlightenment came. It took her a good week to catch on. She noticed how tender her br**sts were. She noticed other changes, too. She suddenly couldn\u2019t stand the smell of quail. She couldn\u2019t stand to watch anyone eat the disgustingly greasy meat, either. She was sleeping longer, and more often than not she was sneaking in an afternoon nap when everyone else was too busy to notice.</p><p>She was going to have Royce\u2019s baby. Nicholaa was so filled with joy over the wonderful miracle that she got teary-eyed every time she thought about it.</p><p>When she wasn\u2019t occupied worrying about Justin, she was thinking about the perfect way to tell her husband he was going to be a father. She knew he was going to be surprised. He\u2019d been so busy with his duties, she didn\u2019t think he\u2019d noticed any changes in her behavior.</p><p>Royce worked with the younger soldiers from dawn until dinner. The two hours a day he\u2019d promised to give the Doves had turned into nine.</p><p>Royce was clearly worn out by the time dinner was finished, yet he still took time to sit her down and lecture her. She thought it was probably the only enjoyment he gained during the day.</p><p>The topic of his lectures was always the same. He talked about her safety at the games. Night after night he made her promise him she\u2019d take every care, that she wouldn\u2019t go anywhere without a proper escort, that she wouldn\u2019t take any unnecessary risks, such as even acknowledging Morgan or Henry.</p><p>Nicholaa couldn\u2019t remember the rest of his list of orders because she was usually daydreaming by then.</p><p>Royce made it quite clear he would rather leave her behind, but her feelings weren\u2019t hurt. She was certain he still hadn\u2019t recovered from the incident when the woman got into their chamber in London.</p> <p>He didn\u2019t want her in Baron Guy\u2019s company, either. Royce would surely have left her home if the king and his wife hadn\u2019t requested that she attend.</p><p>She decided not to tell him about the baby just yet. It would give him a good excuse to leave her behind and simply tell his overlord that her delicate condition didn\u2019t allow her to travel.</p><p>Nicholaa would take every precaution to ensure the baby\u2019s safety, of course. She wasn\u2019t going to let her husband set a breakneck pace. She wasn\u2019t going to become overly tired, either.</p><p>On a bright sunny Monday morning they left for the fields near London where the games were going to take place. Nicholaa got up an hour earlier than necessary so she could recover from her morning sickness before Royce awakened.</p><p>Justin rode with the other young soldiers toward the rear of the procession. Every now and then she heard her brother\u2019s laughter. A terrible thought\u2014that it was the laughter of an innocent riding toward destruction \u2014would immediately pop into her mind. She\u2019d shake her head, tell herself she trusted Royce\u2019s judgment, and then force herself to think of happier thoughts. Then Justin would laugh again, and the cycle would be repeated.</p><p>It was exhausting, this mental game she played. After they stopped to eat their nooning meal, she was so sleepy she could barely keep her eyes open. She asked Royce if she could ride with him. He thought she was finally going to confide her worries to him, but after she\u2019d settled herself on his lap and wrapped her arms around his waist, she went to sleep. It wasn\u2019t a short rest, either; she slept the entire afternoon away. Royce guessed the fear she\u2019d been so desperately trying to hide from him had worn her out.</p><p>He didn\u2019t worry that she was having difficulty maintaining her faith in him. Nicholaa was trying, and that was all that mattered.</p><p>They made camp several hours later in a narrow meadow surrounded by forest. A clear knee-deep stream ran along one side of the clearing.</p><p>Royce had to wake Nicholaa up before he could dismount. A wave of nausea washed over her as soon as she was helped to the ground. She was able to catch the gag in the back of her throat. Then she begged for a few minutes of privacy. Royce noticed how pale she looked. She took off running toward the cluster of trees. Royce frowned with concern as he watched her leave.</p><p>He turned his attention to the care of his mount. He removed the saddle, tossed it to his squire, and then ordered that his horse be allowed to cool down before being given water and oats.</p><p>Ten minutes passed, and still his wife hadn\u2019t returned. Royce went after her. He heard the sound of retching when he reached the trees. Justin came up to speak to him and also heard the noise.</p><p>\u201cYour sister\u2019s ill,\u201d Royce said.</p><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t we go to her?\u201d Justin asked, his concern obvious.</p><p>Royce shook his head. \u201cGive her a few more minutes of privacy. If she doesn\u2019t come back then, I\u2019ll go to her.\u201d</p><p>The two men stood side by side, waiting. Several more minutes passed in silence.</p><p>\u201cWas it something she ate, do you suppose?\u201d Justin asked. The sound of retching had stopped, but Nicholaa still hadn\u2019t walked back to the clearing.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Royce answered. \u201cShe\u2019s made herself ill worrying, Justin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is she worrying about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou.\u201d</p><p>Justin didn\u2019t know what to say to that.</p><p>Nicholaa came toward them then. She frowned when she saw the two of them standing there, then went to kneel by the stream. She rinsed her mouth with the cool water, then patted water on her face.</p><p>\u201cNicholaa?\u201d Justin called out. \u201cHave you really made yourself sick worrying about me?\u201d</p><p>She turned around to look up at her brother. \u201cNo,\u201d she answered. \u201cI\u2019m sick for quite another reason.\u201d</p><p>Justin looked relieved. He pulled her to her feet.</p><p>\u201cI am worried about you, though,\u201d she told him. \u201cJustin, please understand. I\u2019m your older sister, and I\u2019ll always try to protect you.\u201d She turned to Royce. \u201cIf you were going to compete in these games, I\u2019d be worried about you, too. If that means I lack faith in either of you, my only defense is that I love you both.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen it was something you ate that made you sick?\u201d Royce asked.</p><p>Nicholaa gave him a roundabout answer. \u201cI\u2019m feeling fine now.\u201d</p><p>Royce didn\u2019t look convinced. He seemed preoccupied during dinner, and when they\u2019d finished, he went to the stream. She followed him.</p><p>He was bent on worrying about her now, and Nicholaa didn\u2019t think a lecture would ease his mind. A spontaneous action might, though.</p><p>Her husband was kneeling beside the stream. He\u2019d taken his tunic off and was splashing water over his neck and chest. Nicholaa walked up behind him and used the flat of her foot against his solid backside to give him a quick shove.</p><p>He didn\u2019t budge. He did turn around, though, and give her a most incredulous look.</p><p>She laughed and then tried to push him into the water again.</p><p>He thought she\u2019d lost her mind. \u201cI\u2019m being spontaneous,\u201d she announced as she lunged for him a second time. \u201cBut you aren\u2019t cooperating.\u201d</p><p>He still didn\u2019t fall into the water. Nicholaa backed up, thinking to try again, but Royce suddenly stood up. He deliberately glanced over his shoulder at the water, then looked at her and grinned.</p><p>She knew what he was going to do, of course, and immediately lifted her skirts to run in the opposite direction.</p><p>He caught her from behind. She let out a shrill scream. Royce picked her up, turned, and held her over the water.</p><p>Soldiers came running. She and Royce were suddenly surrounded by armed men ready to defend them.</p><p>She was both horrified and embarrassed.</p><p>Royce laughed at the blush that covered her face. He dismissed his soldiers, and when they were once again alone, he bent down and kissed her forehead. \u201cI love you, Nicholaa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, too.\u201d</p><p>They shared a long kiss. Nicholaa quite forgot where they were. His touch was magical, and when he was holding her in his arms, all she could think about was him.</p><p>She was standing with his arms around her waist when he finally ended the kiss. She stared up into his eyes for a long while until she regained her wits. She noticed the sparkle in his beautiful eyes, that adorable rascal\u2019s smile. She noticed something else, too. She was standing in the water. He wasn\u2019t.</p><p>Her intent was to make him forget to worry about her for just a little while, and when he started laughing, she knew she\u2019d succeeded.</p><p>He sat down on the grassy bank, pulled her out of the water and into his lap, laughing over his cunning still, and helped her take off her soggy shoes.</p><p>\u201cRoyce, if you forgot something, would there still be time to go back home to fetch it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he answered. \u201cWhy do you ask?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you wanted to take something back you couldn\u2019t do that, either, could you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>She gave him a radiant smile. \u201cI have something to tell you,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>She didn\u2019t go on. She folded her hands in her lap and turned her gaze to his chest. Her sudden shyness made him smile. \u201cWhat is it, Nicholaa?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to have a baby.\u201d</p><p>He was too stunned to react at first. Then he was speechless.</p><p>She peeked up to see how he was taking her announcement. She laughed when she saw the look of astonishment on his face. Tears of joy streamed down her cheeks, and she wondered how it was possible to laugh and cry at the same time even as she continued to do just that.</p><p>Royce\u2019s hand shook when he gently touched her face. \u201cYou\u2019re certain about this?\u201d he asked her in a gruff whisper.</p><p>It was of course a very logical question. It wasn\u2019t logical that after she told him she was certain, he repeated the same question two more times. He couldn\u2019t seem to accept it.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re pleased, husband?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He didn\u2019t say another word. He didn\u2019t need to. There was so much emotion in that simple acknowledgment, so much love. He put his arms around her and held her against him. He was still having difficulty putting his thoughts into words. They stayed that way for a long while, holding each other, kissing, whispering to each other. Every now and then she\u2019d feel him tremble.</p><p>Oh, yes, he was very pleased.</p><p>Chapter Eighteen</p><p>The fields outside London had been turned into a paradise of color. Tents with each baron\u2019s colors sprinkled the hills overlooking the site where the games would be held. The king\u2019s quarters, on the opposite side, were gigantic and far more elegant than all the others.</p><p>It seemed to Nicholaa that everyone in England was in attendance. Women, dressed in their finest gowns, strolled beside the jousting fields so they could be noticed by the men. Children ran from cart to cart, snatching sweets. Minstrels moved through the crowd, singing romantic ballads. Heralds were busy watching everyone so they could accurately record the history of the event in their minds for future recitation.</p><p>Only six barons had received the honor of having their men engage in the games. Had all the barons been allowed to enter, the festive occasion would have lasted a month or more.</p><p>The experienced soldiers engaged in combat first. Nicholaa stood on the side of the hill with Justin at her side and all the other younger soldiers lined up behind her. They cheered for Lawrence and his team.</p><p>Baron Hanson\u2019s soldiers were almost immediately defeated. Baron George\u2019s soldiers left the fields next. By early afternoon only two divisions remained. Baron Guy\u2019s soldiers were now pitted against Baron Royce\u2019s, just as everyone had predicted.</p><p>Nicholaa was too nervous to cheer. She didn\u2019t watch Lawrence, either. She kept her gaze locked on her husband. He stood at the side of the field, directly across from Guy.</p><p>Each time Royce smiled, Nicholaa let out a little sigh of relief. When he frowned, her stomach did a flip. A deafening roar suddenly caught her attention. She turned to the field. Only Lawrence and Henry remained now. Royce\u2019s vassal was standing over Henry. Guy\u2019s soldier was sprawled on the ground. The tip of Lawrence\u2019s sword touched Henry\u2019s neck. Lawrence wasn\u2019t looking at his prey, though. He was staring at Royce, waiting for his signal.</p><p>Nicholaa held her breath. Royce took his sweet time making up his mind. A silence fell over the crowd. Royce turned to his king, caught his smile, and then finally turned back to Lawrence.</p><p>Royce finally shook his head. Lawrence immediately backed away from Henry, giving him enough room to get up and leave the field.</p><p>It didn\u2019t take Lawrence so long to defeat Morgan. Nicholaa thought Lawrence didn\u2019t want to take the time to toy with him. He knocked him into a sound sleep within ten minutes.</p><p>Only Royce\u2019s soldiers remained on the field now. They lined up and walked over to their baron. Their stride was arrogant, their grins telling. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Royce didn\u2019t show any outward reaction to the victory. When his soldiers joined him, he merely nodded, then turned and walked to the king\u2019s platform. His soldiers fell in behind their baron.</p><p>William stood up, raised his hand for silence, and then proclaimed in a shout that once again Baron Royce\u2019s soldiers had proved their excellence. They would all be suitably rewarded. The cheers were nearly deafening.</p><p>Nicholaa clasped her hands together and said a prayer of thanksgiving for the victory.</p><p>It would soon be time for the younger soldiers to participate. Nicholaa turned to her brother and took his hand. \u201cNo matter what happens, I want you to know how proud I am of you,\u201d she whispered.</p> <p>Since the other soldiers were watching, she didn\u2019t hug him. She squeezed his hand instead. God\u2019s truth, she didn\u2019t want him to go down that hill. She forced herself to let go of him. Bryan helped Justin put on the leather hauberk. Justin flexed his arms. The left sleeve was a bit stiffer than the right. Nicholaa watched her brother adjust the fit, then nod with satisfaction.</p><p>The trumpets sounded from the field, calling the soldiers into position. The men bowed to Nicholaa, straightened their shoulders, and then fell into line behind their commander. Justin led the procession down the hill.</p><p>Nicholaa watched her brother follow the path down to the base of the hill. She spotted Royce then. He\u2019d walked across the field and was now waiting at the edge for his soldiers to join him. He would give them his instructions, then await his second victory.</p><p>Nicholaa could see her husband clearly. He was smiling. The most remarkable thing happened to her then. Every bit of her fear vanished. She drew such strength from her husband\u2019s arrogant confidence.</p><p>Royce looked up at Nicholaa. His breath caught in his throat at the sight of her. She looked like a vision to him, dressed in shimmering blue. She was a beautiful woman, yes, but what captivated Royce was her smile.</p> <p>Justin had to clear his throat in order to get his baron\u2019s attention. Royce seemed content to stand there staring up at his wife for the rest of the afternoon. The other soldiers were already in deep discussion with their barons, who were issuing last-minute instructions.</p><p>Royce forced himself to turn away from his wife. He gave his soldiers one simple order. \u201cYou will give me victory today.\u201d He then turned and walked by Justin\u2019s side toward the center of the field.</p><p>\u201cWill we use swords, Baron?\u201d Justin asked.</p><p>\u201cThe king will decide. Wait until you receive his instructions.\u201d</p><p>Justin nodded. There was still a fair distance to walk. He cleared his throat again. \u201cBaron?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI noticed that over the past few weeks you\u2019ve seemed more concerned about training me than the others. Was that because you had less faith in my ability?\u201d</p><p>Royce held his smile. Justin was experiencing an attack of pre-battle worries. It was a common affliction, especially among the younger, unseasoned soldiers.</p><p>\u201cAs your baron, I have complete faith in your ability. I didn\u2019t give you this honor, Justin. You earned it. As your brother, however, I\u2019ll admit I\u2019ve forced you to work harder. You have to be better than the others, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have fulfilled my expectations,\u201d Royce announced, giving him the praise he knew he needed to hear.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Royce did smile then. \u201cYou insult me by giving me your gratitude,\u201d he said. \u201cAs your baron, I was only doing my duty.\u201d</p><p>Justin didn\u2019t look at Royce but kept his gaze directed on the center of the field. \u201cI wasn\u2019t thanking my baron,\u201d he said. His voice was gruff with emotion. \u201cI was thanking my brother.\u201d</p> <p>Royce gave Justin an affectionate cuff on the side of his neck. They reached the center of the field. Justin and the other nine were the first to arrive. The other competitors were still in huddles with their barons.</p><p>\u201cWas there something more you wished to say to us?\u201d Justin asked when the baron started to walk away.</p><p>Royce turned around. \u201cThe others need further instruction. You don\u2019t. I\u2019ve told you what I expect. Victory, Justin. Nothing less.\u201d</p><p>Nicholaa watched her husband walk to the side of the field. He had such a wonderful swagger. She started laughing. Justin and his team were lined up now. They all stood with their legs braced apart and their arms at their sides. They radiated confidence.</p><p>Clayton the herald drew her notice then. He climbed the hill and stopped at Nicholaa\u2019s side.</p><p>\u201cHistory is being made this fine day,\u201d he told Nicholaa. \u201cA one-handed warrior is leading Baron Royce\u2019s soldiers in combat. This is what legends are made of, Lady Nicholaa.\u201d</p><p>She smiled over his enthusiasm. \u201cHis name is Justin,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd he\u2019s my brother.\u201d</p><p>Clayton was thrilled with her news. \u201cTwo legends in the same family,\u201d he announced. \u201cQuite remarkable.\u201d He bowed to Nicholaa, after explaining he was on his way to gain a better position to watch the feats, and hurried on up the hill.</p><p>As one of the three official observers, Clayton kept his gaze on the field, memorizing each and every detail for future recounting, and watching Lady Nicholaa, too, hoping to get a few additional details to add to her legend. He would not question her until the games were concluded, however.</p><p>The competition finally began. Nicholaa kept her gaze on Justin. She let out a gasp when the very first opponent grabbed his arm and tried to pin him down. Justin shifted positions. His opponent jumped back, then stared down at his bloody hand. The blades sewn into the leather had done their work. The soldier had taken his attention away from Justin, too. Nicholaa\u2019s brother used the back of his hand to knock the soldier backward. As he was staggering to the ground, Justin slammed his foot into the man\u2019s groin.</p><p>The king hadn\u2019t allowed the use of any weapons. Some of the opposing soldiers had wrapped their hands with steel links. The covering proved to be more of a hindrance than a help, though. Justin and his men quickly took the advantage over the soldiers who were trying to hold on to their makeshift weapons. In minutes only Baron Guy\u2019s soldiers were left to fight.</p><p>A giant of a man swaggered toward Justin. Even from a distance Nicholaa could tell he was much older than all the others. Guy had planted a seasoned warrior in with his Doves, she realized.</p><p>Justin didn\u2019t seem intimidated. He motioned for the soldier to come closer. It was an arrogant command. The crowd loved it, too. They cheered. Even Royce, who hadn\u2019t shown any reaction to what was going on until now, actually smiled.</p><p>So did Justin. Guy\u2019s vassal became infuriated. Justin couldn\u2019t have been more pleased. His opponent was making a fatal mistake. He was letting emotion get in his way. He let out a battle cry as he lunged for Justin. Justin did just as Royce had instructed time and time again. He waited until the last possible second, then moved to one side. The warrior went flying to the ground, losing any advantage he might have had. Justin didn\u2019t show the older soldier any mercy either. He made certain he stayed down.</p><p>Two members of Justin\u2019s team were knocked unconscious. As leader, Justin now had to take on two additional opponents. God\u2019s truth, he was thoroughly enjoying himself. He actually laughed when one of his opponents got in a lucky kick; then he retaliated in kind.</p><p>The crowd went wild. They began to chant Justin\u2019s name. Nicholaa was overwhelmed by what she was watching. Her brother\u2019s strength astonished her. His cunning was even more impressive. The two guards assigned to Nicholaa completely lost their composure when the last of the challengers went down. Their cheers made her ears ring.</p><p>For a minute or so before the others joined him, Justin stood all alone in the center of the field. Victory belonged to him. The proof littered the ground around him.</p><p>Justin heard the cheers, but it didn\u2019t register in his mind that the crowd was chanting his name or that their shouts were for him. He bowed low to the king, then turned to his baron.</p><p>Royce gave him an arrogant nod. Justin nodded back. Ingelram and the others joined Justin then. Together now, they walked toward their baron.</p><p>The crowd swelled onto the field. Nicholaa watched as the ladies hurried to surround her brother. He seemed confused by all the attention he was getting.</p><p>Nicholaa expected Royce to come up the hill. He went in the opposite direction. She noticed King William had left his platform, too, and now stood at the bottom of the steps. Guy stood on one side of his overlord, and Royce stood on the other side. A heated discussion got under way. Nicholaa couldn\u2019t see Royce\u2019s face. His back was turned to her. Guy kept shaking his head. Then he took a step toward Royce.</p><p>King William shoved Guy back.</p><p>\u201cThe barons are having a disagreement,\u201d the guard named Vincent announced.</p><p>\u201cA heated one, from the looks of things,\u201d replied Edward, the second guard assigned to protect Nicholaa. \u201cSee how the crowd has backed away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease go and find out what this disagreement is all about,\u201d Nicholaa requested.</p><p>Both Edward and Vincent shook their heads. \u201cWe cannot leave your side, my lady,\u201d Vincent explained.</p><p>\u201cThen at least go up to the top of the hill and ask Clayton what\u2019s going on.\u201d</p><p>The two guards agreed with that request. Only the herald stood above them. Clayton wasn\u2019t that far away, either, and if anyone came up the hill to get to Nicholaa, the soldiers would have plenty of time to get to her side to protect her.</p><p>Nicholaa turned her attention back to her husband. Guy\u2019s two vassals were now being escorted over to the king. Morgan and Henry genuflected in front of their overlord, then stood up. The king was doing all the talking now. Nicholaa wished she could hear what he was saying. He was waving his hands in obvious agitation. His face was red, and she thought he might be shouting at the vassals.</p><p>Morgan and Henry took turns shaking their heads. The king raised his hand, turned to say something to Guy. After a minute or two Guy nodded.</p><p>Royce hadn\u2019t moved at all. Nicholaa didn\u2019t know if he was pleased or angry by whatever was being decided.</p><p>William mounted the platform. Guy moved to stand in front of Royce. He faced Morgan and Henry. He spoke to them, then struck Morgan across his face. Guy gave the same punishment to Henry next.</p><p>Two other soldiers wearing Guy\u2019s colors moved forward when their baron motioned to them. They waited while the vassals removed their swords. Nicholaa understood then. Morgan and Henry were being dishonored for something they\u2019d done.</p><p>Neither vassal appeared to be shamed by the public humiliation. In unison they turned and walked across the field, escorted by the two other soldiers. Guy bent to pick up their swords, walked to the side of the platform, and threw the weapons into the trees beyond.</p><p>Nicholaa kept her attention on the insolent vassals. Morgan stared straight ahead, but Henry kept turning back to look at Royce. She thought then that perhaps Henry blamed her husband for the disgrace he was suffering. The two vassals finally reached the area near the trees where the horses were tethered.</p><p>She let out a sigh of relief. The vassals had obviously been banned from the celebration, and she wouldn\u2019t have to put up with their insolent remarks at the dinner tonight.</p><p>Royce turned and walked onto the field. Nicholaa thought he might be coming up the hill to her. She hurried back inside the tent. Her husband would surely be in need of a refreshment and she wanted to have it ready for him.</p><p>His packet was on their cot. Nicholaa unlatched the fastenings and reached inside to pull out a fresh tunic for her husband. She let out a surprised laugh when she unfolded the tunic and her sling fell out. There were three smooth stones inside, too. Nicholaa couldn\u2019t imagine why Royce had carried that equipment along.</p><p>The sound of trumpets caught her attention. Nicholaa rushed back outside to see what was going on. The games were supposed to be over by now. Royce had told her the young soldiers would be the last to participate, and their competition had just ended.</p><p>She came to a dead stop when she saw what was happening. Royce stood near the center of the field. Guy faced her husband, though he stood almost twenty feet away.</p><p>Both barons were removing their swords. Then each turned. Guy to his right, where his soldiers were lined up on the sidelines, and Royce to his right, where his soldiers had also formed a line.</p><p>Royce\u2019s soldiers weren\u2019t smiling. Neither were Guy\u2019s. A hush had fallen over the crowd, too. Lawrence started onto the field toward Royce just as one of Guy\u2019s vassals moved forward. Lawrence paused in his stride, turned to nod at Justin, and then continued. Justin didn\u2019t understand what was expected of him until Ingelram nudged him and gave him a little shove. Nicholaa\u2019s brother then hurried onto the field after Lawrence.</p><p>Nicholaa didn\u2019t know what was going on, but she was determined to find out, no matter how many guards Royce had ordered to keep her on the hill. She lifted her skirts and started running down the path. She was caught from behind. Vincent grabbed her. The redheaded knight apologized profusely as he escorted her back to her tent.</p><p>\u201cThe baron wishes you to watch from here, my lady,\u201d Vincent explained for the tenth time.</p><p>She turned around to give the soldier a curt response, but quickly changed her mind when she saw the sympathy on the soldier\u2019s face. Vincent was only doing his duty. Nicholaa couldn\u2019t fault him for that.</p><p>\u201cExactly what am I going to be watching?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cThe fight,\u201d Vincent answered, looking confused by her question.</p><p>\u201cVincent, I gathered there was going to be a fight,\u201d she returned. \u201cI\u2019m asking you why. Royce told me he wasn\u2019t going to participate.\u201d</p><p>The second guard moved forward. \u201cThe king just ordered the challenge to settle a dispute.\u201d</p><p>Edward had told her everything he knew, and she still hadn\u2019t learned anything.</p><p>Then Vincent spoke again. \u201cYour brother\u2019s receiving an honor, my lady,\u201d he said as he motioned to the field below. Nicholaa turned just as Royce handed his sword to Lawrence, who in turn handed the jeweled weapon to Justin.</p><p>\u201cNow what are they doing?\u201d she whispered. Justin had left the field, and Royce was speaking to Lawrence. Guy was also talking to his vassal.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re following procedure,\u201d Vincent answered. \u201cOur baron is letting it be known in front of witnesses that Lawrence will take charge in the event . . .\u201d</p><p>The soldier realized what he was explaining a little too late. Nicholaa let out a gasp. \u201cI can\u2019t believe this is happening,\u201d she whispered. Anger was quickly replacing her fear. Her voice had a sting in it when she added, \u201cRoyce specifically told me he wouldn\u2019t be competing.\u201d</p><p>The two soldiers exchanged a look. \u201cHe isn\u2019t competing,\u201d Vincent said. \u201cA dispute is being settled. That\u2019s quite different from a competition, my lady.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWill the two of you at least go down to the base of the hill where the other soldiers stand and ask them if they know what this dispute is all about?\u201d Her words fairly tripped over one another in her rush to gain their agreement.</p><p>\u201cBy God, if this is a fight to the death, neither one of them will win,\u201d she announced, \u201cbecause I\u2019ll kill both of them. Just see if I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Vincent was able to keep his smile contained. Edward wasn\u2019t. Their mistress\u2019s concern for her husband warmed their hearts. Her worry was unfounded, however. Their baron could meet any challenge.</p><p>The soldiers finally agreed to her request and walked down the long path.</p> <p>And then it began. Guy was first to attack. Nicholaa was thankful they used only their fists instead of weapons, yet after several minutes of watching the men battle each other, she realized one could easily kill the other.</p><p>At first they seemed to be evenly matched. Each was able to shake off the other\u2019s powerful blows. Royce was a little more controlled in his actions, though.</p><p>Nicholaa\u2019s stomach did a little flip when Guy tripped Royce. Her husband was sprawled out on his back. Guy seized the advantage. He made a dive to pin Royce down. Just as Guy lunged forward, Royce\u2019s foot came up. He caught Guy in the groin, lifted him a good distance into the air, and sent him into a backward somersault. It was a dazzling display of strength.</p><p>The crowd went wild. Guy must have had the wind knocked out of him. He stayed flat on his back for a long minute. Royce didn\u2019t take the opportunity to end the fight then and there, however. He simply stood with his hands on his h*ps and waited for Guy to get up.</p><p>Nicholaa began to relax. Her husband was obviously toying with Guy. His superior ability was very apparent to her now. She was even able to smile a little.</p> <p>The noise from the crowd made her head pound. The only ones not cheering were Royce\u2019s soldiers. They looked very dignified, and arrogantly confident, too, as they stood side by side along the length of the field watching their baron.</p><p>Guy got in a lucky punch. Nicholaa winced in reaction. She turned her attention away from the field then. Her stomach wasn\u2019t going to let her watch much more. She wished to God Royce would end this and come up to her. She wanted to kiss him first and yell at him next.</p><p>Her gaze scanned the crowd. Everyone was intent on the battle. A movement among the horses caught her eye then. Nicholaa moved a little to her left to see what that commotion was about. She saw two soldiers sprawled on the ground in a huddle. She realized they were the men who had escorted Morgan and Henry off the field. Neither moved. Then she saw Guy\u2019s vassals. Morgan and Henry were reaching for the reins of the nearest mounts. Henry turned her way. She saw the bow and arrow in his hands then.</p><p>They were simply running away from their humiliation, she told herself. Yet she remembered the way Henry had looked back over his shoulder at Royce when he\u2019d been escorted off the field. Those two escorts were now injured . . . or worse.</p><p>Nicholaa ran back inside the tent, grabbed her sling and the stones, and hurried back outside. She stared down at the field while she slipped the loops around her fingers and inserted one smooth stone into the pouch.</p><p>It was only a precaution she was taking, she told herself. The vassals wouldn\u2019t be foolish enough to try to have their revenge now. They\u2019d never make it to safety if they dared to do what in her heart she already knew they were going to do.</p> <p>She prayed she was wrong. She also moved to the edge of the slope as another precaution, though.</p><p>The vassals\u2019 mounts broke through the trees in a full gallop toward the field. Henry came first, with Morgan behind him.</p><p>The crowd hadn\u2019t noticed the intrusion yet. Nicholaa swung her sling into a wide arch above her head. \u201cCome closer, Henry, just a bit closer,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>The horses pounded onto the field. Everything seemed to happen at once then. Guy was facing the soldiers. Henry was still too far away from Nicholaa for her to do him any damage. The arrow was positioned in his bow. He let go of the reins and took aim.</p><p>Baron Guy did a remarkably brave thing then. He threw himself in front of Royce at the last possible second and took the arrow that was meant for his opponent.</p><p>Henry tried to grasp the reins and turn his mount before Royce could get to him. He wasn\u2019t quick enough. Royce moved with the speed of a panther. He didn\u2019t try to stop the mount but jumped up and ripped Henry from the saddle. Royce didn\u2019t waste time killing the dishonored knight, for there was still Morgan to contend with. He kicked Henry just once. The blow was well placed and powerful enough to knock the breath out of the soldier.</p><p>Morgan had finally come within range of Nicholaa\u2019s stone. The vassal\u2019s arrow was nocked to his bow. Royce wouldn\u2019t be able to get to him in time. Neither would any of the other soldiers who were now running onto the field. Everyone was still too far away.</p><p>Morgan had slowed his mount. He raised the bow and took aim.</p> <p>So did Nicholaa. Her target was his arm. She wanted to knock the arrow out of his grasp before he tried to kill her husband.</p><p>Just as she dispatched the stone, Morgan twisted in his saddle. His arrow wasn\u2019t directed on Royce now, but on another target altogether.</p><p>A collective scream came from the crowd. Then the stone caught Morgan on the side of his head, slamming into his temple. Morgan was lifted from the saddle and thrown backwards. He was dead before he hit the ground.</p><p>Everyone seemed to freeze in position. Everyone but Royce. While the crowd stared at Morgan, he turned to look up at the hill where Nicholaa stood.</p><p>She promptly hid the sling behind her back. She couldn\u2019t see his expression, but she knew he\u2019d guessed she was responsible.</p><p>Guy drew Royce\u2019s attention then. The baron walked toward Royce. An arrow protruded from his shoulder. Royce went to help Guy leave the field.</p><p>Nicholaa didn\u2019t stand there watching a minute longer. She went back inside the tent, replaced the sling and the one remaining stone in Royce\u2019s packet, and then sat down to wait for the lecture she was sure was coming.</p><p>She\u2019d interfered. That was probably how Royce would begin his lecture. Then he\u2019d tell her that it simply wasn\u2019t acceptable to kill another baron\u2019s vassal.</p><p>She would interrupt him, of course, and tell him she didn\u2019t care about anyone but him. Yes, she\u2019d defend her actions, and in the end, he would certainly agree.</p><p>Nicholaa worked herself into quite a state of nerves in little time at all. She finally accepted the real reason she was so upset: she had killed a man. She\u2019d never taken a life before, and she never wanted to again. Yet she knew she would if it was the only way to protect her husband.</p><p>Lord, she was exhausted. She stretched out on the cot and closed her eyes. An expectant mother shouldn\u2019t have this kind of excitement, she decided, and she was going to tell Royce just that if he dared to even frown at her.</p><p>She could be thankful for one small blessing, she supposed. Royce was the only one who knew about the sling. She knew from the way he\u2019d turned to look up at her that he\u2019d already concluded she\u2019d interfered. Still, he was as loyal to her as she was to him. He wouldn\u2019t tell anyone.</p><p>When Royce came into the tent an hour later, Nicholaa was sound asleep. He sat down beside her and stared at her angelic face for a long while. He knew she needed her rest, but he was going to have to wake her. He stroked the side of her face.</p><p>\u201cNicholaa? Wake up, love.\u201d</p><p>She opened her eyes and looked up at him.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Nicholaa,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>Her head cleared. \u201cI interfered. Are you angry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t let him go on. \u201cI\u2019m not sorry. No matter how many lectures you give me, I still won\u2019t be sorry. I do have faith in you, Royce, but Morgan could still have put an arrow through your heart all the same.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweetheart\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did you bring my sling?\u201d she interrupted.</p><p>\u201cI thought, if there was time, you\u2019d show me how to use it,\u201d he admitted.</p><p>\u201cI killed him, Royce.\u201d Tears filled her eyes.</p><p>He gently gathered her into his arms and soothed her.</p><p>\u201cIs Baron Guy going to be all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Royce answered. \u201cThe dispute was settled when he put himself in front of me and took the arrow. It was an act of contrition, I think, for past offenses. Guy won\u2019t be training soldiers any longer. He admits he doesn\u2019t have the temperament for the duty.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cWhy did his vassals attack? They must have known they wouldn\u2019t get away with such treachery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe king had already sentenced them to die,\u201d he explained. \u201cThey didn\u2019t have anything to lose.\u201d Royce didn\u2019t go into the reasons behind the king\u2019s decision. Nicholaa had had enough excitement for one day, and there was more to come tonight.</p><p>\u201cRoyce, you won\u2019t tell anyone I killed Morgan, will you? Promise me,\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cI promise.\u201d He almost laughed. Nicholaa had obviously forgotten about Clayton the herald.</p><p>\u201cThe king would be upset,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI didn\u2019t deliberately kill the man, but William might not understand that. Morgan turned at the last second; he must have changed his mind. It was too late, though. I\u2019d already dispatched my stone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t change his mind, only his target.\u201d</p><p>She let out a sigh. \u201cI want to go home,\u201d she said.</p><p>Royce would give her what she wanted. They would leave for home the following morning. Nicholaa was forced to endure a little more excitement that evening. She stood next to Royce in front of the entire gathering while Clayton the herald, whose only duty in life was to poke his nose into everyone else\u2019s affairs, once again sang the legend of Lady Nicholaa. She stayed calm until Clayton sang the newest verses. She heard the word \u201csling\u201d and let out a low groan. Royce laughed. His wife had finally remembered where Clayton had been standing when she\u2019d intervened.</p><p>The king came forward and embraced Nicholaa. Matilda hugged her next. Nicholaa found out then that the king had been Morgan\u2019s target. She hadn\u2019t realized until that minute exactly what she\u2019d done. She reacted to all the attention by edging closer to Royce\u2019s side and blushing pink.</p><p>It seemed an eternity passed before he was finally able to take Nicholaa back to their tent. He was as eager to go home as she was. He wanted to work on the black queen. It had to be finished\u2014perfect, too\u2014before their baby was born.</p><p>It suddenly dawned on him how radically she had changed his life.
