The pain wrapped around her legs, defying the morphine that seeped through her young veins.</p><p>She tried to sit up in her hospital bed and look around the dark room. There was no one there, not even her parents. She started to shake and cry, not understanding what had happened to her, not able to deal with the agony that had taken over.</p> <p>She was alone and forever damaged.</p><p>Finally one of the night-shift nurses appeared at the door and came running over to her.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it, Ellie?\u201d the nurse asked but the girl couldn\u2019t speak. Her sobs were too powerful. She could only shake her head and moan pitifully, tears streaming down her face.</p><p>The nurse knew. She quickly administered more drugs through the IV drip that went into the girl\u2019s arm. The girl had been horribly burned on her leg, one of the worst instances the nurse had ever seen. The doctors had done what they could but without insurance, her parents were unable to pay for any reconstructive surgery. A skin graft could have saved the girl from having horrible scars in the future.</p><p>Her parents weren\u2019t even around. They had been sitting in the waiting room for most of the day, but at night they\u2019d gone elsewhere, leaving the girl alone in the hospital. The nurse was extremely suspicious of them \u2013 everything from the furtive way they kept leaving the building to the way they explained what had happened to the girl.</p> <p>Though it was believable that the girl came from the type of low-income family that would allow her to search for car parts on a nearby trash heap, the whole story about accidently spilling battery acid on her leg didn\u2019t ring true. The nurse thought it sounded like her parents were probably running a meth lab instead. Even worse, they could have been neglecting or abusing the girl. There was definitely something wrong with the story but the girl had been in so much pain that neither the doctors or the nurses could find out what her version of events were.</p><p>Except now. The girl\u2019s sobs were subsiding as the morphine began to take effect, working quickly in her eleven-year-old system. The nurse watched her carefully, debating whether or not she should try and ask her. This was a job for Child Services, not her, but there was something about the girl she wanted to protect. It was like she could see the child was already damaged before the burns on her leg happened.</p><p>\u201cEllie,\u201d she said gently, smoothing back the girl\u2019s fine blonde hair. She was going to grow up to be a stunning woman, already showing promise in the usually awkward pre-teen phase. That made the nurse feel even more sickened for her, knowing her beauty would be marred by the scars that would come.</p><p>The girl opened her wide brown eyes and looked up at the nurse. Her face was wet from tears and she looked scared despite the subsiding pain.</p><p>\u201cEllie,\u201d the nurse went on, \u201care you able to tell me what happened to you?\u201d</p><p>The girl blinked, unsure of what to do or say. She could barely remember what happened herself but knew that what had happened was wrong. And even though her parents hadn\u2019t told her yet to keep quiet about Travis Raines, the bad man whose house her mother made her break into, she knew all too well to keep her mouth shut. She was the daughter of con artists, after all, and truth was never an option.</p> <p>Still, there was a part of her that wanted to tell the nurse what happened. She wanted to get the Travis man in trouble. She wanted him to be put away for what he did to her.</p><p>\u201cI ... I don\u2019t remember,\u201d the girl said, so terribly afraid she\u2019d tell the truth.</p><p>The nurse studied her. \u201cDo you remember looking for car parts?\u201d</p><p>Car parts? The girl had no idea what her parents had told the doctors. The confusion came across her face, just long enough for the nurse to pick up on it.</p><p>\u201cEllie, what was the last thing you remember?\u201d the nurse asked quickly. \u201cHow did you burn your leg, did your parents do this to you?\u201d</p><p>The girl\u2019s face fell as she tried to figure out what to do.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d Amelie Watt yelled, appearing at the doorway.</p><p>The girl cringed at the sound of her mother\u2019s voice. In her increasingly delirious state, she was worried that she may have done something to anger her.</p> <p>Amelie marched into the hospital room, her eyes blazing at the nurse.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you questioning my daughter?\u201d she yelled, furious, her arms waving. \u201cThat isn\u2019t your right.\u201d</p><p>The nurse stepped back from the girl but refused to apologize. \u201cI\u2019m concerned about her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour only concern is to make my daughter better.\u201d Amelie crossed her arms, head held high. She was a striking woman with exotic Eastern European features \u2013 high cheekbones, a strong jaw, and dark sloe-eyes. She gave off the impression that she wasn\u2019t afraid but she couldn\u2019t hide the tremor in her voice. \u201cWhy are you waking her up in the middle of the night anyway? Let my poor baby sleep.\u201d</p><p>The nurse raised her brows. \u201cYour baby was crying in the middle of the night, screaming from the pain. I was the only one around.\u201d She let those last words sink in like daggers.</p><p>Amelie sucked in her breath and shook her head. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare question my parenting skills. We had to leave to get some sleep at home. It\u2019s the only way we can be there for her.\u201d</p><p>The nurse stared back at her, wondering if she should push it further. She glanced at the girl who was staring at her mother with a mix of admiration and fear. Perhaps there was no use digging around here. If the girl really was being abused or neglected, Child Services would find out about it. They\u2019d already been notified anyway. The Watts could deal with them in the morning.</p><p>Finally the nurse sighed and said, \u201cYou\u2019ve got five minutes before I\u2019ll need you to leave the room. She\u2019ll need to sleep and the drugs will keep the pain at bay.\u201d</p><p>Amelie narrowed her eyes and then looked to her daughter. The nurse left the room, closing the door behind her.</p><p>Amelie relaxed visibly once she heard the door shut. She came closer to her daughter and placed a hand on Ellie\u2019s thin, tanned arm, wincing at the sight of the IV going into it.</p><p>\u201cBaby,\u201d she whispered. \u201cWhat did you tell them?\u2019</p><p>By now the girl was slowly losing consciousness, eased into a comfortable state by the morphine. She licked her lips and said what she knew her mother wanted her to hear. \u201cI didn\u2019t tell them anything, mama.\u201d</p><p>Amelie gave her painful smile. \u201cThat\u2019s my baby girl. When you\u2019re feeling better, we\u2019ll let you know what to say. For now, tell them that you were looking for car parts at the dump and that was the last thing you remember. You got it? The last thing you remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut ...\u201d the girl started. \u201cBut the man. Travis.\u201d Amelie shuddered at the sound of his name. \u201cHe needs to be punished. He needs to go to jail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe will be punished one day, baby,\u201d her mother said. \u201cOne day, he will pay. But that\u2019s not your job. We\u2019ll take care of it. I promise.\u201d</p><p>Her mother stayed with her, holding her hand.</p><p>I\u2019ll make him pay, the girl thought. Then fell asleep.</p><p>CHAPTER ONE</p><p>The storm raged on and inside I was screaming.</p><p>I was sitting in a stolen Jeep with no roof, parked on the side of a dirt road beneath a wavering canopy that occasionally let a spattering of rain pelt me in the face. Despite the warmth of the tropical night, I was cold and soaked to the bone in my muddy evening gown. On one side of me was Camden McQueen, on the other was Javier Bernal. One more light than dark, one more dark than light. Both men had come for me. Both men had loved me. And both of them I had seriously underestimated.</p><p>There really wasn\u2019t much time to sit around and try to get my head on straight. But after everything that happened, I knew a panic attack was just waiting to devour me, to incapacitate me, to take me out of the game. I could feel the fear buzzing through my veins, threatening to tear me up from the inside out. The fear of losing everything \u2013 Gus, my mother, my revenge, my purpose. I feared Javier and what he might do to Camden. I feared Camden and the way he\u2019d changed toward me. I feared myself and the things I might do to try and make sense of it all.</p><p>We had only been in the Jeep for about ten minutes, heading back to Veracruz, when I\u2019d told Javier to park the car so I could have a moment. He reluctantly complied, finding an area beneath some massive trees that shook from the howling winds. Both men were staring at me and I could only look down at my hands as I rubbed them up and down against the mud on my dress, the coldness seeping into my palms. They both knew me, knew my attacks, and that alone had me screaming internally, wanting to run. I couldn\u2019t even look at them. I couldn\u2019t even accept the situation. Javier and Camden. The three of us having to work together, let alone sit in a Jeep together without them killing each other. And I was in the middle.</p><p>My mind raced back to our escape. My mother. Dear God, my mother. I really never thought I\u2019d see her again, let alone at a drug lord\u2019s party, but there was she was, serving motherfucking champagne. She was working for Travis of all people, the man who poured acid down my leg when I was just eleven years old, the same man who my mother wanted to rob that night in Mississippi. What the hell had happened to her? After everything we had gone through as a family, after all the pain I suffered, the inquests from authorities, the move to Palm Valley to stay with Uncle Jim and her eventual abandonment of me, why was she here with him now? And where was my father?</p><p>I swallowed, my throat feeling thick and debated on asking Javier. He had known this all along, knew where they were. He\u2019d even wanted me to kill them for some sick, divine purpose from that damaged moral code of his. This whole time he knew and he was using me.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t even be angry at him over that, though. I should have known better, I should have expected this. I was so damn angry at myself for falling for his old tricks, for slipping into a past that would have been better left buried. I hated myself for losing my faith in Camden and putting it in Javier instead, and hated myself even more for the damage I caused. That was another reason I couldn\u2019t look at him. Every time I looked at Camden, I saw the ways he\u2019d changed. He was stronger, tougher and more ruthless. He was also hurt, scarred deep inside by what I\u2019d done. He now had the kind of scars that even his skilled hands couldn\u2019t transform.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Camden asked, his voice low. My knee was touching his knee. My other knee was touching Javier\u2019s. I could feel them on either side of me, hear their breathing, both their bodies tense and rigid as we sat there in the darkness. This was so awkward. So fucking awkward.</p><p>And from the looks of it, with Gus and my parents in the clutches of Travis Raines, my cover being blown, the three of us having to make our way through Mexico together, awkward was the least of my problems.</p><p>I nodded, still looking at my hands, even though I wasn\u2019t okay. None of us were.</p><p>Javier sighed loudly. Something about his tone made me look over. Somehow it was easier to look at him, maybe because I didn\u2019t feel guilt when I did. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I asked. I pressed my fingers into my thigh to keep my nerves from misfiring.</p><p>He tilted his head toward me and though the only light came from the glow of the Jeep\u2019s dashboard and the far-off flashes of lightning in the sky, I could see the gleam in his eyes. Unreadable, as always.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just wondering how long we\u2019re going to sit here in a fucking tropical storm,\u201d he said simply, a false smile spread across his face. \u201cThat\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>Camden sat up straighter. \u201cAt least the rain should wash all that blood off your face.\u201d</p> <p>Javier\u2019s eyes flicked over to him. \u201cAre you sure you want me to help you get your fat Gus back? Because I think I\u2019m the one doing you both a favor. Aside from saving your behinds, of course. I don\u2019t recall either of you thanking me yet.\u201d</p><p>I exhaled through my nose. \u201cJust give me a few minutes. I need to figure out the plan.\u201d</p><p>Javier let out a dry laugh, rain running off the tip of his nose, and eyed me incredulously. \u201cThe plan? You\u2019re not in charge of the plan, angel. If you want my help, then you\u2019re doing it my way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck that,\u201d Camden spat out.</p><p>I finally had to look at him. His eyes were raging beneath his glasses that reflected the dull glow from the car and he was gripping the door handle like he was about to break it in two. Oh god, I didn\u2019t need this. But then again, it was partly my fault. Maybe I did need this.</p> <p>\u201cCamden,\u201d I said, trying to placate him with my eyes, \u201cplease, let\u2019s just ... let\u2019s just stay calm and think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am calm,\u201d Javier answered as Camden opened his mouth. \u201cI need to go find my sister, Violetta. That\u2019s my goal first and foremost. Then I\u2019ll help you get to Travis and Gus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd my mother?\u201d I filled in, daring him to be honest.</p><p>He gave me a short nod, though he was looking off onto the dark road. \u201cYes ... and your mother.\u201d</p><p>Now was the time to ask him. Better now than never.</p><p>I took in a deep breath. \u201cWhere\u2019s my father? I didn\u2019t see him at the party.\u201d</p> <p>He raised a brow and looked over my head at Camden. Why, I had no fucking idea. I turned to look at Camden but he was staring back at Javier like he didn\u2019t even know who he was.</p><p>\u201cJavier,\u201d I repeated. \u201cWhere is my father?\u201d</p><p>He frowned at Camden and looked back at me. His face went stony. \u201cThe man you call your father is dead.\u201d</p><p>Every limb on me froze. My lungs sucked in warm air and raindrops.</p><p>\u201cDead?\u201d I asked, feeling like I was choking.</p><p>Dead.</p><p>My father was dead?</p><p>No.</p> <p>Javier\u2019s eyes softened momentarily but only for a minute. \u201cI didn\u2019t know until I got here.\u201d</p><p>I let it soak in over my bones. My father was dead.</p><p>The good parent.</p><p>The weak one.</p><p>Dead.</p><p>With my mother working for Travis, I truly was an orphan now.</p><p>\u201cOh god,\u201d I said, finally finding enough air. I leaned forward, trying to ward off another panic attack, and Camden\u2019s warm hand met the small of my back, just enough to let me know he was there. His touch somehow strengthened me. \u201cOh god.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Javier said.</p><p>It took a few moments before I realized what he said.</p><p>I immediately whipped my head toward him. \u201cNo you\u2019re not,\u201d I seethed. \u201cYou wanted me to kill them. You sick fucking bastard, you wanted me to kill my own parents. You brought me here for that. You are not fucking sorry!\u201d</p><p>Javier stared at me impassively, his features forever reptilian, smooth and calculating. No emotion. No anything. How could I have even thought there was something warm inside him?</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d he said, turning his attention back to the empty road. \u201cI\u2019m not sorry. I\u2019m glad he\u2019s dead. He deserves it for what he did to you. But I am sorry you feel this way, right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I wouldn\u2019t have felt worse if I killed them?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cObviously now I know how that would have played out. Apparently you don\u2019t hold the same grudges that I do.\u201d</p><p>I felt like elbowing him in the nose again, seeing it break over and over. But Javier was one of those men who could take the pain and make it work for him. He had too much of an advantage over us at the moment and he liked it when I hated him as much as he liked it when I loved him.</p><p>\u201cHow did he die?\u201d I asked, grinding my teeth.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he said. \u201cAll I know is that he is one less person to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are so fucked-up,\u201d Camden muttered, his hand tightening on my back.</p><p>Javier merely grinned at that, his teeth white in the darkness, taking no offense at all. \u201cWhatever I am, you need me more than I need you. And because of that, you\u2019ll do as I say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like a deal with the devil,\u201d I told him.</p><p>\u201cMy, my, angel, how quickly you\u2019ve changed your tune now that this tattooed ape is back in your life.\u201d He eyed Camden. \u201cYou know, just because you\u2019re here now, doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ve won anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI only came to get Ellie back,\u201d he said, his voice quiet but full of animosity. I knew that Camden was keeping himself on a very tight leash. I also knew that when he didn\u2019t, well, I didn\u2019t have to look long at Javier\u2019s bruised and bloodied face to know what happens.</p><p>\u201cOh, of course,\u201d Javier said with deliberation. \u201cBut is she really back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJavier, shut the fuck up,\u201d I said. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got a plan then tell us what the plan is, because the longer we sit here arguing, the further Gus gets away from us.\u201d</p><p>He slowly looked back to me. \u201cThat has been my point all along. Are you able to think now? Is your little attack over? Because I know what worked last time you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet on with it,\u201d I cut in. Neither Camden nor I needed him to finish his sentence. The last time I had a panic attack around Javier, we ended up having sex in an orange grove. I was vulnerable, driven by lust, desperate for closure and lured back into my own past. I had a million excuses for why I fucked him but what bothered me the most was that at the heart of them all, I did it because I wanted to. I needed to. Now, looking at him, knowing how much he had and hadn\u2019t changed, I hated myself for being so weak, hated my body for betraying me so easily.</p><p>He held my gaze and I knew in the dim light he could make out the raw anger in my eyes. He was thinking, wondering how much more he could toy with me. He now had the ability to get a rise out of both Camden and I anytime he wanted. He was a man with too much ammo, but perhaps he\u2019d always been that way. He stockpiled it like a squirrel preparing for winter.</p><p>He shifted the Jeep with a lurch, causing me to fall into Camden, and pulled the vehicle back onto the dirt road, the rain whipping us as it continued to fall in heavy drops. We sped in the direction of Veracruz, where the city lights were casting a dull orange glow on the bottoms of the storm clouds.</p><p>\u201cThe first step is to get rid of this car,\u201d Javier said, his mouth setting in a grim line. \u201cThey\u2019ll be looking for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s always Jose,\u201d Camden said.</p><p>I looked at him incredulously. \u201cYou have Jose?\u201d</p><p>He gave me a small smile. \u201cThe car\u2019s a bit battered but yeah I have Jose. It brought me and Gus down here. All your stuff is still in the trunk.\u201d</p><p>Thank god, because all my other stuff was in the hotel room that I wouldn\u2019t be returning to. The only thing I had on me was what fit into my clutch purse: Eleanor Willis\u2019s passport (which was pretty much useless now since Travis knew it was a fa\u00e7ade), some makeup, a few pesos and that was it.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Javier scoffed. \u201cI\u2019m sure the car isn\u2019t wanted by a few people either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean other than you?\u201d I asked.</p><p>He grunted. \u201cThe past is the past. We\u2019re better off getting something more inconspicuous, don\u2019t you agree?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re getting my stuff out of the car, at least,\u201d I told Javier. \u201cYou can add that to your plan.\u201d</p><p>He made another disagreeable sound but didn\u2019t argue. \u201cFine. Get your stuff. Get a new car. Head to Mexico City to check on Violetta.\u201d</p><p>I frowned at the mention of his sister. \u201cCheck on?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll tell her to get out of town, go to Marguerite or Alana\u2019s in Jalisco.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd she\u2019ll listen to you?\u201d</p><p>He bit his lip for a second. \u201cShe knows what happened to Beatriz. She\u2019ll listen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho is Beatriz?\u201d Camden asked.</p><p>Javier shot him a look as he brought the Jeep onto the main highway. \u201cNone of your fucking business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s one of his sisters,\u201d I quickly told Camden. \u201cTravis murdered her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course he did,\u201d Camden said with a sigh, leaning back into the seat. I finally had the strength to watch him for a few moments. The wind was ruffling up his dark hair, his glasses reflecting the lights of the few cars on the highway that were braving the storm. His jaw was strong, lips full but held together tightly. I knew he was tormented but I didn\u2019t know by whom. Was it Javier?</p><p>Or was it me?</p><p>He took his glasses off and wiped the rain off of them with the sleeve of his tuxedo he had gotten for Travis\u2019s party. It took effort, his brilliant blue eyes wincing with pain. His shoulder was still messed up from being shot.</p><p>\u201cDo you have any more of your painkillers?\u201d I asked him.</p><p>He closed his eyes and nodded while he slipped his glasses back on. \u201cNow\u2019s not the time. I\u2019ll deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell you certainly dealt with Javier\u2019s face,\u201d I said. It slipped out before I had a chance to take it back. I wasn\u2019t about to start provoking the monster but it was easier said than done.</p><p>And provoked him I did.</p><p>Javier\u2019s grip on the wheel tightened and he slammed on the brakes so we went skidding across the highway. I screamed, the tires squealing beneath us, as we came to a shuddering stop on the shoulder and he flipped it into park.</p><p>\u201cJesus!\u201d Camden yelled. \u201cAre you trying to kill us?\u201d</p><p>Javier immediately whipped out his gun so it was in front of my face and pointed it at Camden.</p><p>\u201cNo. Now I\u2019m trying to kill you,\u201d Javier sneered, staring down the barrel of the gun.</p><p>\u201cThen fucking do it,\u201d Camden said, his eyes blazing, meeting the challenge.</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t tempt me,\u201d Javier countered.</p><p>My eyes darted between the two of them and the gun. It wavered slightly, betraying Javier\u2019s smooth exterior. He was damn angry, angry enough to do something stupid. He didn\u2019t need Camden egging him on.</p><p>I raised my hands slowly, careful not to touch the gun that was inches away. I spoke carefully, trying to keep my voice from shaking. \u201cPlease, please, Javier, Camden, let\u2019s just ... let\u2019s just calm down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up,\u201d Javier said, his eyes flitting to me and back to Camden. \u201cThis is all your fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow is this my fault?\u201d I exclaimed and then realized it was. I needed to keep my mouth shut. We all did. I looked between the two of them and said, \u201cOkay, I\u2019m sorry. It is my fault. Obviously we\u2019re not getting anywhere if we can\u2019t get along.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Javier\u2019s grip tightened on the gun. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a matter of getting along, angel.\u201d He licked his lips and nodded at Camden. \u201cTell me, Camden, how did you manage to escape from your ex-wife and the mighty Vincent Madano?\u201d</p><p>Camden frowned at him, his jaw tensing. \u201cHow do you know about that?\u201d</p><p>Javier grinned. \u201cI read it in the newspaper like everyone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI have to say, I\u2019m impressed,\u201d Javier went on. \u201cVincent Madano is not a man you can just mess up and walk away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow well do you really know them?\u201d I asked Javier, remembering that Camden had said something about it all being a set up, that Sophia and her brothers, and possibly Javier were all in on it. The exchange, the kidnapping \u2013 it was all for show. All to get me away from Camden and maybe to put Camden in danger.</p><p>It must have been driving Javier crazy to have Camden here with us. Camden could not be caught that easily.</p><p>\u201cI know them well enough,\u201d Javier said. He loosed his grip on the gun, shook the rain off of it and put it back in his waistband. I exhaled in relief. \u201cBut I suppose that\u2019s neither here nor there at this point.\u201d</p><p>I was sure that Camden wouldn\u2019t let it go that easily. Just how deeply was Javier tied to his ex-wife and her brothers and why? But Camden only gave Javier a final glare before turning his attention back to the darkened farmland we had stopped beside.</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s just get Gus back,\u201d he said and pressed his lips together as if to prevent himself from saying something else.</p><p>Javier watched him for a few moments before putting the Jeep back into drive and returning us to the highway.</p><p>We sat in unbearable silence as we made our way into Veracruz, yet it was safer than saying anything. I felt like we were a word away from incinerating each other. Camden only spoke up to give directions to where he had ditched Jose.</p><p>Unfortunately it was a bit too close to Travis\u2019s compound for comfort. We pulled down a quiet residential street only a few blocks away, the leafy trees blowing wildly in the wind, the rain having thankfully dropped off. The sound of helicopters buzzed in the distance.</p><p>Javier eyed the sky and I asked, \u201cAre those his or news choppers?\u201d</p><p>He nodded subtly. \u201cThey\u2019re his. The news wouldn\u2019t dare cover this.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTurn right down here,\u201d Camden told him and we came down another street, this one more narrow, with the trees blocking out the streetlights that were few and far between. This was still a well-to-do area, though the houses were smaller and spaced further apart, all behind tall gates and walls. I did note that it was a dead-end road, which meant there was only one way out if something were to happen to us. We couldn\u2019t be too careful, not with the choppers circling in the distance, their spotlights occasionally lighting up the sky.</p><p>\u201cThere she is,\u201d Camden said, pointing to the end of the street where jungle seemed to have taken over and there were no streetlights. I could barely make out the shape of the car in the darkness.</p><p>\u201cShe?\u201d Javier asked, eyebrow cocked. \u201cIts name is Jose.\u201d</p><p>Camden shrugged. \u201cGuess she\u2019s a cross-dresser.\u201d</p><p>Javier sighed, shaking his head in disgust, and pulled the Jeep up to it. \u201cLet\u2019s make this fast.\u201d</p><p>We hopped out and it was only now that we were closer that I saw what Camden meant by \u201cbattered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoly shit, Camden!\u201d I cried out at the sight of the poor vehicle.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell did you do to my car?\u201d Javier yelled, his hands thrown up in the air.</p> <p>The GTO had the paint scraped off all along one side, the windows on the driver\u2019s side were all shot out, the driver\u2019s side mirror was missing, the front was totally crunched up with only the right headlight intact.</p><p>\u201cYour car?\u201d I asked Javier once I managed to look away from poor Jose. \u201cWhat happened to the past being the past?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow\u2019s not the time to argue semantics,\u201d Camden interrupted us. \u201cShe\u2019s broken but she\u2019s a survivor.\u201d He fished the keys out of his suit jacket and tossed them at me. \u201cJust like you.\u201d</p><p>I caught them and he held my eyes for a moment before walking past me back to the Jeep.</p><p>Javier scoffed, though I didn\u2019t know if it was for the state of the car or Camden\u2019s comment, and made his way to the trunk. He bumped it with his fist. \u201cCome on, let\u2019s get her open.\u201d</p><p>I was about to hurry over to him when Camden suddenly said, \u201cFuck.\u201d</p><p>I spun around and looked at him. He was frozen in the act of taking off his jacket, his good arm free, his head cocked upward, eyes searching the sky. The sound of the choppers had gotten louder and over the tips of the waving trees I could see the spotlight in the sky, the blades whirring.</p><p>\u201cYeah, no kidding fuck,\u201d I said. I turned to Javier and quickly ran over to him, trying to get my keys into the trunk of the car. I kept fumbling, missing the lock just as the wind blew my hair back and we were lit up by the spotlight, the helicopter coming closer. We were in their sights, no doubt about that. We had been spotted.</p><p>\u201cHurry up!\u201d Javier yelled at me before ripping the keys out of my hands.</p><p>Camden hit the side of the Jeep with his fist. \u201cThere\u2019s no time!\u201d he yelled. \u201cWe have to go!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I yelled back as Javier got the trunk open. \u201cNot without my stuff!\u201d</p><p>Suddenly the ground in front Camden started exploding with bullets as a steady stream of them came off the approaching chopper. We all cried out, dirt flying everywhere.</p><p>Javier quickly slammed the trunk shut. \u201cThen we\u2019re taking Jose. Get the fuck in!\u201d</p><p>He went for the driver\u2019s seat as Camden came running over, taking my hand and pulling me to the passenger side. He shoved me into the backseat, telling me to lie down, and barely got in the car himself before Javier was gunning the engine and driving the car backward. I could feel the wheels spinning for grip beneath my head and tried to sit up just as the sound of more bullets filled the air. I was tossed back down as Javier put the pedal to the floor and turned the wheel, the sheer power of the rear wheels grinding until we did a 180 until we were facing the right way. The chopper was now directly above us and I could feel the wind its blades created flowing through the smashed windows, the spotlight blinding me.</p><p>\u201cHang on,\u201d Javier said, \u201cthis is going to get ugly before it gets better.\u201d</p><p>He pressed down on the gas again and the car roared loudly before it lurched forward and we were all pinned back to our seats from the force. This is exactly why I loved this car. I just hoped he was stronger than he looked at the moment.</p><p>We raced down the street, the chopper in hot pursuit, the whir of blades and bullets gaining on us. I leaned forward between the seats, reaching for the glove compartment, waving my hand at it when I couldn\u2019t reach. \u201cMy gun, give me my gun!\u201d</p><p>Camden gave me an odd look but opened the compartment and handed me the gun that was thankfully still in there. It wasn\u2019t my colt .45\u2014that was in the trunk still\u2014but it would do.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Camden yelled as I quickly checked the clip and slammed it back in.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s being a good girl,\u201d Javier said, just as the trunk was bombarded with bullets, sounding like metal fireworks being set off. \u201cFuck!\u201d he yelled and swerved, trying to lose them, as I attempted to lean out of his window. I wedged myself up against the back of his seat and faced behind us. The wind whipped my hair around, the spotlight blinding me, but I managed to keep the gun aimed upward at the helicopter. I had no idea if this would work like it did in the movies but I figured it was better than just sitting in the backseat and doing nothing.</p><p>Only problem was, Javier kept swerving and throwing me off balance and the chopper kept moving out of my sights. You\u2019d think that would mean that their bullets weren\u2019t any closer to hitting us but that wasn\u2019t quite the case. One hit the trunk again, a dangerously close call, just as Javier brought the car spinning around the corner and on to another road.</p><p>\u201cWhere do I shoot?\u201d I screamed above the noise. \u201cThe fuel tank?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShoot the fucking person who\u2019s shooting at us!\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d I muttered. All I could see against the light was the outline of the chopper, not anyone inside. Still, there was a faint red glow whenever the gun went off so I just aimed there, firing off a few rounds and hoping they went somewhere.</p><p>Suddenly the windshield in the back of the car was hit and I screamed as it exploded into a million shards of glass. Obviously I hadn\u2019t hit the gunman yet.</p><p>\u201cKeep shooting!\u201d Javier yelled as he brought the car around onto another street. We were leaving the hidden, residential hills of the wealthy and into the more open and busier suburbs of Veracruz. It was well lit and now there was traffic we had to contend with.</p><p>The chopper ducked down lower and sped up as we slowed to navigate around the cars on the road. The sound of horns, irate yells from drivers, and screeching tires filled the air. I took aim once more and fired again and again, hoping it would hit at least the windshield. But the helicopter came closer, the wind from the rotors shaking my arm like jelly, its landing skids almost coming down on top of us until Javier swerved the car to the left and the chopper had to rise quickly to get above a tall semi-truck in its path. I took the time to grab my arm with my other hand, trying to steady myself, to ignore the cramp in my lower back, the pressure of the door frame against my shoulder.</p><p>Come on, Ellie, I told myself as the helicopter came back again, much faster now and much lower, as if it didn\u2019t give a fuck anymore.</p><p>\u201cDrive faster!\u201d I yelled but wasn\u2019t sure Javier could hear me over the noise. I took in a deep breath, trying to see past the hair flying in front of my face and started firing.</p><p>I fired and fired but it just came closer and closer.</p><p>And then there was a dull click.</p><p>There were no more bullets left in my gun.</p><p>And my other clip was in the glove compartment.</p><p>We were fucking screwed.</p><p>CHAPTER TWO</p><p>\u201cShit, shit, shit!\u201d I yelled at the gun, trying to figure out if I had enough time to duck back into the car to get the extra round. The helicopter was close enough now that I could see the guy with the semi-automatic leaning out of the door, one of his feet on the landing skids, the gun aimed directly at me.</p><p>A shot rang out through the air, blasting my ears.</p><p>The man with the gun wavered from his position, the gun slipping out of his hands first before he fell over and smashed onto the street below him, the cars behind us trying to drive around his body on the pavement.</p><p>What the hell?</p><p>I turned my head and looked over the hood of Jose. Camden was leaning out of his window, a gun in his hand, aimed at the chopper.</p><p>\u201cNice shot!\u201d I yelled at him, feeling a surge of giddiness and adrenaline run through me. I think I was grinning.</p><p>He gave me a look that was as blas\u00e9 as it could be when he was hanging outside of a speeding muscle car having just shot a man in a helicopter. Then with stark determination he aimed again and shattered the chopper\u2019s window. Within seconds the helicopter started to tilt off to the side before going into a tailspin and crashing onto the shoulder of the road. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My mouth dropped open, eyes wide as hell, as the helicopter erupted into a giant fireball that lit up the street, nearly engulfing the passing cars around it. Though we were still speeding away, I could feel the blast of heat on my face.</p><p>I looked back to Camden incredulously. Where the hell had this man learned to shoot?</p><p>He gave me a weary smile. \u201cI have steady hands.\u201d Then he disappeared inside the car.</p><p>I slipped back in as well, my heart racing a mile a minute as I found the security of the back seat. That was a rush greater than a thousand cons. I\u2019m not sure why I expected Javier to say something encouraging, but he just glared at me in the mirror and said, \u201cTook you long enough.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou should thank your ass that she\u2019s a good shot,\u201d Camden said quickly. I guess from his perspective, Javier couldn\u2019t really tell whose gun took down the helicopter and Camden was making it look like it was all my doing. I felt simultaneously touched and ashamed. He was trying to make me look better than I really was.</p><p>Javier grunted and kept Jose swerving in and out of the cars on the road.</p><p>\u201cNow what?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cThere will be more helicopters where that came from,\u201d Javier answered. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to avoid the highways now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan we switch cars?\u201d Camden asked.</p> <p>\u201cNo time,\u201d Javier said, not looking at him. I watched his grip on the steering wheel, the pronounced ridge of his knuckles. He was gripping it hard \u2013 he was rattled to the bone over what had just happened. I wasn\u2019t sure if that should make me feel better or not. \u201cWe\u2019re not stopping until we have to.\u201d</p><p>It was about three in the morning when we finally had to stop. Jose ran out of gas right outside the city limits of Apizaco, not too far from Mexico City. Luckily we were able to pull up to a small albeit rundown motel to shelter us until the nearest gas station opened in the morning.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure it\u2019s even open?\u201d I asked Javier as we climbed out of the car, legs stiff and tired from the voyage. Taking the back roads and staying off the major highways meant it took us much longer than it should have, though I was appreciating the fact that we arrived close to our destination and still in one piece.</p><p>He jerked his head at the motel. \u201cThey\u2019ll take our money.\u201d</p><p>It was a row of rooms all facing a dirt parking lot. It reminded me a lot of Shady Acres, the motel where Camden and I had met Uncle Jim, just before he set me up and Javier shot him in the head. I tried to control the wave of anger and sorrow that was rollicking through me. I couldn\u2019t keep dwelling on the past, things that would drown me if I let it. I couldn\u2019t succumb to it now, not in this situation, not with the murderer right beside me.</p><p>Crickets filled the night air as Javier went toward the small house behind the motel, probably to go wake up whoever was in charge of the place. There were no other cars in the parking lot and from the look of the dilapidated grounds, they probably didn\u2019t have much business. I suppose the fact that it was the middle of the night and Camden and I were dressed as if we were attending the Oscars wouldn\u2019t faze them either.</p> <p>I looked at Camden as Javier disappeared around the corner. \u201cHow\u2019s your shoulder? Ready for those pills?\u201d</p><p>He grimaced. \u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>I took a step toward him, feeling entranced by his presence so close to me. This was the first instance we\u2019d been alone all night, and after the escape from Travis\u2019s and the consequent car chase, he was looking larger than life. His tuxedo tie had come undone, his white shirt unbuttoned a bit, just enough to show off his tats, which looked dark in the dim light.</p><p>\u201cCan I see?\u201d I asked, reaching for his jacket. I wasn\u2019t a nurse by any means, but I still wanted to help. He\u2019d gotten fucking shot trying to reach me.</p><p>He shrank back slightly, something I pretended didn\u2019t hurt like hell, but in the end relented and let me help him get his jacket off. His shoulder was completely soaked through with blood.</p><p>\u201cJesus, Camden,\u201d I couldn\u2019t help but exclaim. \u201cWe need to get your bandages changed.\u201d</p><p>I carefully pulled the rest of the jacket through his arms.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you mean, \u2018don\u2019t worry about it?\u2019\u201d</p><p>He gave me a leveling gaze. \u201cIt\u2019s not your problem. It\u2019s mine. I can take care of myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you can but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cEllie, I think you need to stay with Javier tonight.\u201d</p><p>My lungs felt like they were suddenly dumped full of glass.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I managed to get out.</p><p>He rubbed his lips with the back of his hand and brought his gaze over to the motel. \u201cI don\u2019t know about you, but I don\u2019t trust that fucking bastard for a second.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I do?\u201d I asked incredulously.</p><p>He smirked, only for a second. \u201cWell, it\u2019s hard to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCamden, the minute he discovered the tracking device on my necklace\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, so that\u2019s what happened?\u201d</p><p>I inhaled quickly though my nose, trying to keep from panicking. \u201cI didn\u2019t set you up. He found out! You have to believe me.\u201d</p><p>He sighed and looked back at me but all I could see were the lights of the motel in the reflection of his glasses. \u201cI believe you, Ellie. I believe you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you think I should stay with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t trust him either, then you know we can\u2019t leave him alone. We\u2019ll wake up and the car will be gone with all your stuff. He\u2019ll abandon us. I don\u2019t care what he says. There is no way that he needs us to do what he wants. He\u2019s got connections ... we\u2019re just being allowed to tag along and I don\u2019t know why.\u201d</p><p>I almost stamped my foot. \u201cBut I can\u2019t stay with him!\u201d</p><p>\u201cObviously if I do, one of us will end up dead. At least for you it\u2019s as natural as wiping your ass.\u201d</p><p>I glared at him. \u201cWhy are you doing this?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, as if to himself, and kicked a stone that went skidding across the dry soil of the lot. \u201cI\u2019m doing what needs to be done. It doesn\u2019t mean you have to sleep with him, Ellie. Just keep an eye on him. I\u2019ll be stationed outside the door anyway.\u201d</p><p>I walked over to him and placed my hands on his firm chest. \u201cI want to stay with you.\u201d I bit the bullet. I didn\u2019t care.</p><p>He peered at me, his Adam\u2019s apple bobbing as he swallowed hard. He opened his beautiful mouth, about to say something then abruptly closed it for a few moments. \u201cHe\u2019s coming.\u201d</p><p>I stepped back and took my hands off him.</p><p>Javier appeared around the corner and came marching to us with a smile on his face. \u201cWell I got us our rooms. Uno, dos and tres.\u201d He gestured to the first three to our left.</p><p>Ugh. Sharing a room with Javier would be a nightmare but Camden did have a point. I didn\u2019t trust Javier and knew he was capable of screwing us over at the best opportunity. Staying in separate bedrooms this early in the game would be the perfect opportunity for him to up and leave us. Javier\u2019s alliance only went to his sister, not to Gus, and the fact that he was even agreeing to help us at all said a lot. Unfortunately, I didn\u2019t know exactly what it said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m staying with you,\u201d I quickly said to Javier. I didn\u2019t bother putting on an act, smiling or acting coy. He\u2019d see straight through me anyway.</p><p>He raised his brow. \u201cIs that right, angel? And to what do I owe your angelic company?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re both the same,\u201d Camden filled in. He stepped forward and quickly swiped the key out of Javier\u2019s hand. \u201cYou\u2019re meant for each other.\u201d He took off for his room, his back straight and proud. My heart both lurched and ached at his words, how badly he was brushing me off, how ill he thought of me.</p><p>Javier was surprised and loving it. He turned to me, mouth slightly agape. \u201cWow. Something tells me he was trying to be insulting.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t even fake a smile. \u201cWhich one is our room?\u201d I asked, feeling sick as the words came out.</p><p>He grinned at me, all snake, no conscience. \u201cWhichever one I choose, angel. Have you got all your belongings?\u201d</p><p>Normally I would have brought out everything from the trunk but there were an awful lot of lives in there, an awful lot of stuff. With me keeping an eye on Javier all night, it was probably safe.</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>He smiled again, especially as Camden shut his door to room number one.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s take numero tres, si?\u201d Javier asked. \u201cMore privacy.\u201d He grabbed my hand and led me toward it though there was nothing gentle or warm in his touch. Those days were over. I was back to dealing with the spurned Javier, the hunter and the sadist.</p><p>He opened the door and flicked on the lights. A few cockroaches skittered underneath the bed, and moths darted to the threadbare light fixture hanging from the ceiling. The room was as run-down as I\u2019d ever seen and for one twisted second I was glad I wasn\u2019t sleeping there alone. In the next second, though, I was reminded that the company of insects was preferable to his.</p><p>He closed the door behind us and put his hand at my neck, holding me there, and leaned into my ear. \u201cDo you want top or bottom?\u201d</p><p>I stiffened for a moment then rammed my elbow back into his gut. \u201cFuck you.\u201d</p><p>He let go of me and coughed loudly, still trying to smile. \u201cYou should be glad I\u2019m giving you the option, angel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a sick pig.\u201d</p><p>He straightened up and shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s what you liked until about, oh, twelve hours ago. Tell me, angel, what is it about that boy that makes you forget who you really are? Is it the tattoos, because you know I have those.\u201d He quickly shed his linen shirt and stood bare-chested before me, the tattoo of his mother\u2019s name on his inner arm. He turned around slowly, making sure I saw the large cross going down his spine. \u201cOr is it those horrible glasses of his. You know, I can look like a fucking idiot if I really wanted to.\u201d</p><p>I narrowed my eyes, keeping far away from him like wary prey. \u201cHe sees the good in me.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cThe good. Of course. The good. So, is that why you\u2019re spending the night with me? Because I looked into that boy\u2019s eyes tonight and there was no good in there left for you.\u201d</p><p>My gaze locked with his, a war without further words. His eyes shone yellow-green in the light, looking more inhuman by the moment. Deep in his insanity, he was making some sense. That\u2019s what I hated most about Javier, that there was always a kernel of truth to his words, a truth that made you fall for the lies.</p><p>I sucked back my breath and nodded at the sagging bed. \u201cYou better get a good night\u2019s sleep.\u201d Then I grabbed one of the pillows and the top sheet and brought it over to the thin Mexican rug that ran along the end of the foot of it.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re serious?\u201d he asked as I started making my bed on the floor.</p><p>\u201cGood night,\u201d I told him, lying down on top of the sheet. I didn\u2019t trust the cleanliness of the floor and it was too hot to have a sheet on top of me anyway. I rolled over so I was facing away from him who was still standing near the bed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCome now,\u201d Javier said. \u201cSharing a bed with me isn\u2019t that bad. You\u2019ve been doing it for the last week. Is the inevitable sex too distracting?\u201d</p><p>I grinded my teeth together but didn\u2019t say a word.</p><p>Suddenly he dropped to the ground on top of me, flipping me over so I was on my back, pinning both of my arms to the ground, his face just inches from mine. Wild strands of his hair partially obscured his feverish eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll scream,\u201d I said hoarsely, fear pulsing through my veins.</p> <p>He grinned. \u201cYou know I love that.\u201d</p><p>Then he lowered his lips to mine, his warm and salty taste engulfing me. I did my best to keep my lips shut, to wriggle my mouth out of the way.</p><p>\u201cOh, angel,\u201d he murmured near my lips. \u201cStop the act. We both know you want this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you fucking dare,\u201d I grunted, \u201cor I will make you pay.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled and lifted his head, peering down at me curiously, still keeping a death grip on my arms. \u201cYou\u2019re not thinking straight. You\u2019ve got everything backwards, you know?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m thinking just fine.\u201d I stared right back at him, refusing to be intimidated, even though he was straddling me on the floor of our hotel room. \u201cYou\u2019re backwards.\u201d</p><p>He gave a subtle shake of his head. \u201cHow quickly you change your tune, how easily you are manipulated. You think that just because Camden came for you that it means he knows what\u2019s best for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what\u2019s best,\u201d I said, trying to keep my voice steady.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t,\u201d he said, \u201cand you never did. You keep trying to be good, to be this person that you\u2019re not, and you think the minute someone tries to convince you, tells you something that you want to hear, that they must speak the truth.\u201d He ran his fingers down the side of my face, gently at first before pressing them in harder near my mouth. \u201cSo beautiful, so na\u00efve. You know, even though he is here it doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re obligated to be with him. It doesn\u2019t mean you owe him anything. You never asked him to come after you.\u201d He traced my rigid lips with his forefinger. \u201cIt isn\u2019t too late, you know. I can forgive your lies, your ... lack of loyalty. I can forget that you ever conspired with him. We can do this, just the two of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo what?\u201d I asked once he removed his finger.</p><p>His smile was lopsided. It would have looked cute on anyone else, but the depravation in his eyes soiled it. \u201cRule the world. Don\u2019t you remember? I\u2019ll be the king and you\u2019ll be my queen.\u201d He leaned in closer and closed his eyes, whispering, \u201cTravis is in our reach. We are so close now. You are so close to getting your revenge.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said. \u201cI only want Gus back. You can have Travis.\u201d</p><p>His eyes fluttered even though they were shut, as if he were having trouble comprehending what I was saying. \u201cOf course, your Gus. And your mother too, I suppose.\u201d</p><p>I swallowed with effort, stifled again by the memory of seeing her at the party. \u201cYes, my mother. I\u2019m just here for them. That\u2019s the only reason I\u2019m going after Travis.\u201d</p><p>He opened his eyes, narrowing them slightly. \u201cI figured as much. You know, you\u2019ll change your mind when you see Travis again. And I\u2019ll be the one handing you the gun to finish the job. Then you\u2019ll have your people back. And then, with his blood on your hands, you\u2019ll finally have your peace. Don\u2019t forget what you were prepared to do earlier. Don\u2019t pretend like you weren\u2019t going to drop that poison into his meal. Don\u2019t act like you weren\u2019t fully prepared to kill the very man that ruined our lives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur lives?\u201d</p><p>He blinked a few times. \u201cYour pain has been my pain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI call bullshit on that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I call bullshit on you. You know what you mean to me, angel. You know the lengths that I\u2019ll go to, all to make sure you get justice.\u201d</p> <p>I took in a deep breath, so conscious of how close his face was to mine, so mindful of his lips that looked ready to come crashing onto mine again. I had to say what I needed to say and had to say it right. Being straight was the only way out.</p><p>\u201cJavier. I appreciate you saving us. And I do want to get your sister someplace safe. And if you can really help me get Gus back, then I owe you everything in the world. But what we shared, what we had, is over. It was over the moment I found out your true intentions. It was over the moment I realized I was being manipulated like some fucking puppet on a string. And it was over when I realized you and I are as toxic as the poison you put in my necklace. That has always been the truth and that will never change. The us that was is gone. This is the new us. We can help each other and if we can\u2019t, then we shouldn\u2019t be in each other\u2019s lives. If you\u2019re going to have your own agenda and your own plan other than helping me get to Gus, then we should part ways, right now, tonight, and never look back at each other. Never look for each. Move on and forget. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>My heart was beating so hard I could feel it in my lips, in my fingers. I had no idea how he was going to take this.</p><p>He stared at me stone-faced, as if he didn\u2019t even hear me. He clicked his tongue against the roof of his mouth and looked up at the ceiling. \u201cI think I understand. Yes, I think I hear you.\u201d He cleared his throat and straightened up, still straddling me but at least my face was free from his lips and grasp. His eyes still focused upward and he said, \u201cAngel, angel, angel,\u201d while shaking his head back and forth. \u201cI thought I knew you. I only knew the ... fetus ... compared to the woman you could be.\u201d He looked at my sharply. \u201cWhat a fucking disappointment you are.\u201d</p><p>Then he quickly got up and marched over to the bathroom, slamming the door behind him. I sat up, rubbing at my face. He hadn\u2019t hurt me but his touch still lingered like aftertaste. The thing was, a part of me still wanted that revenge on Travis. But now that it was his idea, I wasn\u2019t about to give him credit. Javier had the advantage when it came to tricks, to contacts, to the plan. But I felt like I had the emotional upper hand. I didn\u2019t know how long it would last and I didn\u2019t know what kind of man it would make him \u2013 this would be the second time I\u2019d spurned him after all. He was a loose cannon, a wild card and it was the moment I underestimated him that he\u2019d totally pull the rug out from under us.</p><p>I thought back to Camden, wondering if he was in his room or outside the door like he\u2019d said. It hurt like hell that he\u2019d asked me to stay with Javier. I wanted Camden to be protective, to be my shield, especially now when I needed him the most. Instead, he was distant and becoming more distant by the moment. I knew he\u2019d never let anything happen to me, that he would do his best to make sure I was alive, that he\u2019d help me get Gus back, that he\u2019d return me to California all in one piece. I just didn\u2019t know how deep his wounds went either. When he was gone, Javier had been the person I relied on, whether that was a smart decision or not. But now with Camden in the picture, I felt myself naturally gravitate toward him.</p><p>Screw Javier and what he thought of my nature. My real nature, my real self, wanted that person to believe in me, to see the good, ignore the bad, and make me feel like I had a future. Camden was my future \u2013 though now that he was closer than ever, I felt that future being taken away from me. All because I made a foolish mistake. All because I had no faith.</p><p>The fact was, when I really looked at it, when I really searched deep inside, I was still in love with Camden. It was a love I had to bury for the last few weeks, a love I thought I could never have, that I\u2019d never deserve. But I felt it, hidden underneath the layers, like the center of the sun. It was blinding when you had a glimpse of it but it was enough that you knew it was there, shining down on you. I\u2019d let myself get burned if I could.</p><p>Yet now that everything had changed between us, that he knew I\u2019d been with Javier, that I\u2019d been sleeping with him ... I wasn\u2019t sure how we could recover from that. I could argue my side until I was blue in the face, keep telling him it never meant anything. But he wouldn\u2019t believe that and even I knew that was a bit of a lie, because Javier did mean something. Just for those moments where I could fool myself into thinking it meant more than it did, it still meant something. That was what I was having the hardest time wrapping my head around. How could I ever explain that my body got what it needed at the time but my heart was fooled? That my heart had always belonged to him, even if just the memory of a man I never thought would come for me. What man would ever understand that? Camden was noble but he was still a man with insecurities like everyone else. He\u2019d go out of his way to make sure I was okay but I was afraid he\u2019d never let his own heart get over it. I was so fucking afraid that he\u2019d never let himself love me again.</p><p>I felt shredded up inside and my own heart was afraid to repair itself.</p><p>I sighed and looked down at my dress. It was dirty, brown from mud, and I quickly shimmied out of it and into a pair of jeans and a tee-shirt I brought out of one of the spare bags from the trunk before Javier came out of the bathroom. I was tempted to go out to Camden, but even then I wouldn\u2019t know what to say. And, he was right. Someone had to make sure that Javier wasn\u2019t about to screw us over, especially now that I\u2019d slighted him. He was extra volatile.</p><p>I was sitting cross-legged on the makeshift bed when Javier came out of the bathroom, ruffling his now wet hair, with a towel. A shower would have been nice considering I had dried patches of dirt on my arms but I\u2019d get by without it. I couldn\u2019t risk leaving Javier alone right now.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still here?\u201d he asked, tossing the towel across the room. He walked barefoot, just a towel around his waist, to the bed. \u201cI would have thought you\u2019d left after what you\u2019d said to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, you\u2019re stuck with me,\u201d I told him, turning my head away before he dropped his towel like I knew he would.</p><p>\u201cOr perhaps you\u2019re the one stuck with me,\u201d he said. He climbed in under the shawl-like blanket I\u2019d left on the bed and rolled over to his side.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to turn off the light?\u201d I asked.</p><p>He laughed quietly, facing the wall. \u201cBelieve me, angel, you don\u2019t want to see what comes out in the dark.\u201d</p><p>I gradually lay back down, keeping my arms close to my chest. Within moments he was snoring and I did my best to stay awake. Even with the light on, it wasn\u2019t too long before I fell asleep.</p><p>I was awakened the next morning by Camden\u2019s warm and strong hands on my face. I smiled into his touch, still half-asleep and delirious with dreams.</p><p>\u201cSee, she\u2019s alive,\u201d Javier\u2019s voice broke through the clouds. I blinked a few times and looked beyond Camden\u2019s chiseled face. Javier was standing behind Camden\u2019s crouched body, fully clothed and ready to face the day.</p><p>\u201cThen why is she on the floor?\u201d Camden asked, looking behind him in annoyance.</p><p>Javier turned around and left my vision. \u201cBecause she wanted to sleep there.\u201d</p><p>Camden looked back at me, shaking his head as Javier left the room. \u201cAsshole. Like he couldn\u2019t have taken the floor himself.\u201d But I could tell he was relieved that I hadn\u2019t shared Javier\u2019s bed. I was relieved too. I fell asleep and slept all the way through the night. I was still exhausted and groggy-headed, though, but I felt more prepared to face the day, to face North America\u2019s largest metropolis, Mexico City. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat time is it?\u201d I groaned, wishing Camden would keep his hands on me for as long as he could. My eyes drifted over to his shoulder where the blood had dried and I winced at the sight.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s eight,\u201d Camden said. \u201cWe slept in a bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour shoulder.\u201d</p><p>He eyed it. \u201cYeah. I took the pills last night, okay Nurse Ellie? New bandage too from Jose\u2019s first aid kit. I\u2019ll be okay. Need a change of clothes though.\u201d</p> <p>I smiled despite myself, feeling strength returning, and slowly sat up. He grabbed underneath my arms and pulled me to my feet. There was a second or two where he was holding onto me, my chest against his chest, my head positioned just below his lips. I stared forward at his battered collar, at the bright tattoos \u2013 snake heads \u2013 that were coming through. I breathed in deeply, taking in his familiar smell and making it my fuel.</p><p>Don\u2019t ever leave my side again, I thought. I wanted to say. I missed you. I still love you.</p><p>I looked up at his eyes, hoping he could see far enough in, see how I was really feeling.</p><p>I love you.</p><p>He stared back at me, eyes so perfect, so blue. Then he cleared his throat and looked away. \u201cAre you ready to go?\u201d</p> <p>I took a second to compose myself and shot him a weak smile. \u201cI just need to use the bathroom. I\u2019ll be quick.\u201d</p><p>Within minutes I was slipping a bra underneath my tee-shirt and heading out to Jose. The poor car looked even worse in the daylight. I was amazed it had even gotten us this far.</p><p>Javier was standing by the driver\u2019s door and noted my expression. \u201cAt least the car will blend in with the city. Every car looks like this. Such a shame.\u201d</p><p>I made my way to the trunk. \u201cWe should at least put on new plates.\u201d I opened it, throwing my overnight bag back in and started rifling through the large Ziplock bag where I kept all the spare plates. There were about ten of them and two of them were foreign, one from British Columbia in Canada and the other from Tijuana state in Mexico. I took the Mexican plate out and waved it at them.</p><p>\u201cThis should help a bit,\u201d I said and fished out my screwdriver from my spare toolkit. Man, it was nice to have my stuff again. I quickly took off the old Cali plates and put the news ones on, already feeling the heat of the morning sun beating down on me. With any luck, Jose would blend in with any old Mexican car now.</p><p>I brought out a pair of black shit-kicker boots that were extra wide at the top and had a leather belt around them that I\u2019d added to them. They were perfect for stuffing a gun and strapping a knife to you. I brought out my Colt from the box in the truck and shoved it down my right boot, making sure it was secure. It looked awfully pretty next to the cherry blossoms on my shin.</p> <p>I straightened up and looked over the trunk at Camden. \u201cHey where did you get the gun you were using last night?\u2019</p><p>\u201cGus,\u201d he said and my heart was immediately crushed at the thought of him. He\u2019d come all this way with Camden for me and could be very well dead, if not tortured, by now. Every second we spent trying to get to Javier\u2019s sister, the more Gus slipped away. But we needed Javier\u2019s help, his knowledge of Travis, of the cartels, of Mexico. We had to help him before he could help us, even though I had a feeling all of us were equally wanted now.</p><p>I looked over at Camden and Javier, the wheels in my head turning.</p><p>\u201cJavier,\u201d I said, \u201cdo you think we need to change our appearances?\u201d As it was I had a blonde wig in the trunk too and brought it out before he could say anything. I plopped it on my head and turned to look at them.</p><p>With Javier on one side of the car and Camden on the other, they both looked at me with a speechless expression on their faces. I guess with the blonde hair, I looked to Camden like I did in high school and I looked to Javier like I did when we were living together.</p><p>\u201cTake it off,\u201d they both said in unison then exchanged furtive glances with each other.</p><p>All right, so no disguises. I took the wig off, my scalp already sweating from it and threw it back in the trunk. I was okay with being who I was.</p><p>Camden pulled his seat forward and let me squeeze in to the back of the car. I hated being back there. I missed being in the front, I missed fucking driving, but knew Camden would feel slighted if I asked to change places and that was the last thing I wanted him to feel. More than he already did, anyway.</p> <p>Javier pulled out of the dusty motel parking lot and drove steadily until we reached the first gas station. After we filled up, it was only about two hours before we reached the city.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t prepared for the sprawl. I mean, I knew how large Mexico City was especially since it was the one of the largest cities in the world. I knew how far it was spread out, how many people lived there. But I still wasn\u2019t prepared to see block after block of shanty houses reaching as far as the eye could see. There was no land, just houses. Just city. Just people. No wonder Javier vetoed our disguises \u2013 if you couldn\u2019t get lost in Mexico City, you couldn\u2019t get lost anywhere.</p><p>\u201cDo you even know where to find your sister?\u201d I asked him as he took the car down a busy thoroughfare off of one of the many intersecting highways. Traffic was thick enough to cut with a butter knife. The humanity was spilling out the city\u2019s pores, leaking everywhere with poor beggars sitting roadside and skinny-limbed children playing in black exhaust fumes.</p><p>\u201cOf course I know where to find her,\u201d he snapped. \u201cShe\u2019s family.\u201d</p><p>I bit my lip feeling slightly chagrined, then said, \u201cWhen was the last time you were here?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t say anything for a few moments, just laid on the horn at a car that had cut him off with no apology. \u201cVioletta doesn\u2019t live in the slums. She lives like she should. I\u2019ll find her soon.\u201d</p><p>Camden looked back at me and I raised my brows. I wasn\u2019t going to argue with Javier about his sister, it just all seemed a bit impossible, especially without GPS.</p><p>\u201cCamden could use his GPS,\u201d I offered and was immediately shut down with an icy glare in the rear view mirror.</p><p>\u201cCamden can go fuck himself,\u201d Javier said, still looking at me. Camden didn\u2019t bother reacting, only looked back out the window at the never-ending hills of buildings. There were a few skyscrapers in the middle of the city but beyond that it was just house after house after house. Shack after shack after shack. It took a lot of effort to keep another panic attack from coming on, that\u2019s how ... engulfing ... the city was. It went on forever yet made you feel like you were trapped in a box.</p><p>We drove for quite a bit, never really making it anywhere, before he begrudgingly told Camden to enter in \u201c301-1250 Calle Burnaby\u201d into his GPS on his phone. To his credit, Camden did it without saying anything, though it was at least another forty-five minutes before we got to the place.</p><p>Javier might have said that his sister didn\u2019t live in the slums, but she was at least surrounded by the slums. Or maybe that was the case everywhere in Mexico City. Her apartment building was white-washed and fairly clean-looking with underground parking and a concierge-type person I could see lurking behind the barred windows of the lobby. But on either side of the building were slum houses, mostly one-story, some two, rising up around it like weeds.</p><p>We managed to find parking across the street. Javier got out of the car and glanced at us.</p><p>\u201cYou wait here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo fucking way,\u201d Camden said, quickly getting out from his side. I followed, joining him on the broken sidewalk. \u201cWe\u2019re going with you.\u201d</p><p>Javier waved at us dismissively and kept walking across the road. Camden and I waited until it was safe \u2013 the drivers here were crazy \u2013 before trotting after him.</p><p>\u201cSo mistrusting,\u201d Javier muttered to himself as we approached the building.</p><p>\u201cHow can we be so sure that your sister isn\u2019t part of your little plan?\u201d Camden asked.</p><p>Javier shot him an exasperated look. \u201cShe is the plan. Get her safe, get her out of Travis\u2019s way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then you\u2019re going to help us out of the goodness of your heart.\u201d</p><p>He looked the building up and down, rubbing his hands together. \u201cYou\u2019re not the only one who wants Travis dead. I\u2019ve wanted this for a long time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor revenge or so you can take over his cartel?\u201d Camden asked.</p><p>Javier eyed him and smiled, teeth white against his bronzed skin. \u201cWho says I can\u2019t have both?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven though it\u2019s the same cartel that murdered your parents?\u201d I dared to ask.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s always room for improvement,\u201d he said.</p><p>He went up to the building\u2019s entrance and I was impressed to see it had a buzzer system. His finger trailed along the buttons until they paused at #301 Bernal. His shoulders rose and fell as if he were steadying himself before he held down the button. I knew, back in the day anyway, that Javier was fond of his sisters and had taken it upon himself to take care of them financially after his parents had been murdered by a rival cartel, the same cartel that Travis was now a part of, the same cartel that Javier suddenly had his sights on. Or maybe it wasn\u2019t so sudden after all.</p><p>We waited for a few anxious moments, the ringing repeating until we heard a faint yet demanding \u201cHola?\u201d over the intercom.</p><p>He shook his head and looked at us. \u201cShe shouldn\u2019t even be answering this right now.\u201d Then he faced back to the intercom and said, \u201cVioletta, es Javier.\u201d There was a longer pause and he added, \u201cTu hermano.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJavier?\u201d she asked. \u201cQue ...?\u201d</p><p>He quickly asked her to let him upstairs and after a few more heavy pauses the door buzzed open. He grabbed it and swung it open for us and marched inside the cool building, his dusty yet sharp shoes echoing on the tile floor, nodding quickly at the concierge who only briefly looked up from his newspaper, not even batting his eye at Camden\u2019s blood-stained shirt. We walked past the elevator and went for the stairs, running up the flights until we got to the third floor.</p><p>We walked swiftly and quietly down the hall, stopping in front of #301.</p><p>Javier knocked quickly and took a step back from the door as it promptly swung open.</p><p>We were greeted by a large gun aimed at his head.</p><p>CHAPTER THREE</p><p>I automatically threw up my hands, though Javier barely even flinched. A slender young woman stood on the other side of the door, a large Beretta in her hands aimed right at him. Her eyes hadn\u2019t even left his face to take me and Camden in, but one look at those golden green eyes of hers and it wasn\u2019t hard to see she was related to Javier.</p><p>\u201cVioletta,\u201d Javier said calmly. He rattled off a question to her in Spanish with that smooth voice of his. Her gun never wavered, if anything her eyes narrowed even more. Finally she looked over his shoulder and spotted me and Camden. She frowned, lowered the gun and then jerked her head to follow her into the apartment.</p><p>Camden and I eyed each other nervously. I don\u2019t know what I was expecting but I certainly wasn\u2019t expecting this, particularly from someone that had to be in their late teens, early twenties. Then again, I guess I was handling guns at a young age too.</p><p>We walked into her apartment and Camden slowly closed the door behind us. It was quite large considering how much space seemed to be an issue in this city, with a terracotta-tiled floor, blue and white porcelain accents in the kitchen and large windows that looked out onto the sea of roofs. There was a room off to the side and I caught the sight of a rumpled bed and a large balcony beyond that. There were hair appliances and makeup and clothes strewn all over the place, cementing the fact that Violetta may have had a gun in her hands, but she was still a young girl. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She spun around in the middle of the room and suddenly slapped Javier clear across his face. I couldn\u2019t help but suck in my breath, afraid of what Javier might do. But he merely took it as she started to rant at him in rapid-fire Spanish, throwing up her hands and launching what must have been a million obscenities.</p><p>Violetta really was a very beautiful woman, slim-limbed and around my height, 5\u20326\u2032\u2032, with thick and long golden highlighted hair, dark olive skin and full lips, slightly slanted yellow-green eyes. She was wearing a summery dress that was cut short and had applied her makeup with a heavy hand.</p><p>When she was finally done, Javier retorted with a sentence or two, still succinct in his own language, and it wasn\u2019t until I picked up on the words Eden White, that Violetta looked toward me.</p><p>She frowned and pointed my way, looking askance at Javier. \u201cEden?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEllie,\u201d he corrected her with a grim smile. \u201cHer real name is Ellie. And she doesn\u2019t speak Spanish, not that much, anyway.\u201d</p><p>She stepped slowly toward me, her flip flops smacking against the tiles, and though I was very conscious of the gun in her hands, I stood my ground and looked her in the eye.</p><p>She smiled, playful and deceptive all at once. \u201cSo you are the famous Eden. You\u2019re the one who broke my brother\u2019s heart all those years ago.\u201d</p><p>It took everything I had to keep from rolling my eyes. Of course I had been painted the villain. Of course Javier never bothered to fill his sister in on the fact that he was cheating on me with a woman he\u2019d later end up beheading.</p><p>\u201cI guess it depends on what side you hear,\u201d I answered.</p> <p>She smirked and took another step forward. I caught a whiff of her perfume, freesia and linen. Fresh. Out of place in this smog-filled super city.</p><p>\u201cYou know, for the longest time I swore I\u2019d kill you if I ever saw you,\u201d she said slowly, her accent barely audible. \u201cI wanted to make you suffer for the pain you caused my brother. But, now I\u2019m older. And I see how Javi is. The only thing I want to do is shake your hand.\u201d</p><p>She put hers out for me to shake and I did so, surprised at the strength of her grip. She smiled and jerked it up and down. \u201cI\u2019m Violetta Bernal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEllie Watt,\u201d I said, returning her smile. I nodded over my shoulder at Camden who was still by the door. \u201cThat\u2019s Camden McQueen.\u201d</p><p>Violetta looked at him, her eyes widening appreciatively. \u201cHello, Camden McQueen.\u201d Then they went over to his shoulder. \u201cWhat happened to your arm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot shot by the policia,\u201d he said with a grin and I felt a weird prickle surge through me. He sounded almost as if he was flirting with her. I couldn\u2019t help but look over at Javier to see what he felt about all of this. He was watching the three of us carefully; his brow was furrowed and he was slowly running the back of his hand underneath the scruff of his jaw, calculating something.</p> <p>\u201cLet me get you something,\u201d she said brightly and took off to her room. Through the doorway I could see a flurry of clothes being tossed across the room and within seconds she\u2019d come back out with a large plain black tee-shirt. She placed it in his hands.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d she said. \u201cSome guy left it here. I won\u2019t be calling him again anyway, so it\u2019s yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d he said genuinely, flashing her his drop-dead gorgeous dimples. Damn, and I thought those were reserved especially for me. \u201cDo you have a washroom I can change in? Banos?\u201d</p><p>She smiled and pointed down the hall to a door. Once he disappeared, she put her gun down on mantle and placed her hands on her hips. \u201cIs he your boyfriend? Or are you still with this guy?\u201d She jerked her head at Javier.</p><p>I swallowed hard and said, \u201cNeither.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood, I guess,\u201d she said. \u201cDo you know what this asshole has done? Nothing. Nothing at all! He\u2019s been promising to send me money every month and the last check I got from him was, oh, two years ago!\u201d</p><p>I glanced at Javier in shock. He was red in the face, sweating a bit at the temples, but not arguing with her.</p><p>She looked at him too. \u201cWell, so what was your excuse, hey brother?\u201d</p> <p>He rubbed his lips together, eying the both of us, before saying, \u201cI was busy. I tried.\u201d</p><p>She snorted and walked over to the kitchen, her little ass sashaying. \u201cPuta co\u00f1o,\u201d she swore. She opened up her fridge. \u201cDo you want a glass of water? A beer?\u201d</p><p>It was just before noon and I definitely needed my head on straight but I still said, \u201cCervesa, por favor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMake that two,\u201d Camden said, coming out of the bathroom. He was looking much better, his hair slicked back with water, his biceps bulging from the shirt that was a bit too snug on him. That, combined with his black dress shoes and tuxedo pants, made him look like a dapper man in black. Well, with a shitload of tats and Clark Kent glasses.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have time for beer,\u201d Javier said angrily, watching as she brought me and Camden a Modelo each. He fastened his eyes on me. \u201cYou haven\u2019t forgotten about Gus, have you?\u201d</p><p>I felt the sting from that and glared back at him while Violetta asked. \u201cWho is Gus?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA family friend of mine,\u201d I answered, eyes still on Javier. \u201cActually, more family than my own family. Travis has him. He kidnapped him in front of Javier.\u201d</p><p>She looked at him. \u201cThis is true?\u201d</p><p>Javier ran a hand through his hair and turned to look out the window. \u201cSomeone took him. I\u2019m assuming it was Travis since my own fucking men turned on me just seconds before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo is that why you\u2019re here?\u201d she asked, cocking her head to the side. \u201cTo warn me about this Travis?\u201d</p><p>He kept staring out the window, at the rows and rows of houses, the layer of muddy smog that blocked us from blue sky. \u201cThere is no \u2018this\u2019 Travis, Violetta. He\u2019s not a made up character. He\u2019s real. And he will be coming for you.\u201d</p><p>Her smile faltered for a second before she noticed I was observing her then it was full of false bravado. \u201cI know all about Travis. I\u2019ve been watching the news.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis made the news?\u201d Camden asked, stepping forward. His arm brushed against mine and I tried to ward my mind against the warmth of our contact. \u201cI thought he owned half of Veracruz.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course it did,\u201d she said, smiling her bright teeth at him. \u201cI\u2019m sure in Veracruz you wouldn\u2019t hear anything, but this is a different state. People here don\u2019t look too kindly on the Zetas and their new leader. It\u2019s been playing all morning, how an unknown cartel attempted to assassinate him at his own party. Most people have been celebrating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid they mention how one of his helicopters was shot down?\u201d Camden asked eagerly.</p><p>\u201cMost people?\u201d I asked at the same time.</p><p>She gave us both a placating smile. \u201cI never heard anything about a helicopter. But yes, Ellie, most people. This is a big city, right here, bingo, in the middle of the country. There are ties to all the cartels here. The Zetas definitely have a presence, it\u2019s just not the most ... popular one. I have a few friends in the Zetas right now.\u201d</p><p>Javier moved so fast that all I could see was a blur of menace and stealth. He grabbed Violetta by the mouth and forced her backward until she was pressed against the door. Camden immediately went for him but I grabbed Camden quickly and pulled him back. This wasn\u2019t his place to interfere.</p><p>Javier started swearing at her in Spanish. I picked up a few words but anyone could have figured out what he was so riled up about: the fact that she was fraternizing with members of the same cartel that had her parents and sister killed. For the first time I saw fear in Violetta\u2019s eyes, shame and anguish. I reached forward and touched Javier lightly on the shoulder.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d I said gently, heart-racing knowing he might turn on me at any moment. \u201cYou\u2019re here for her.\u201d</p><p>He squeezed her face harder and Violetta\u2019s eyes looked to me. In this moment of fear, she finally looked her age.</p><p>\u201cJavier,\u201d I warned.</p><p>He loosened his grip and lowered his head so his hair hung around his face. He grunted, trying to control himself. Finally he let go of her completely and stormed straight to the bathroom where he slammed the door shut.</p><p>Violetta rubbed at her jaw, her chest heaving, eyes on the bathroom door. \u201cWhat is wrong with him?\u201d</p><p>How well do you actually know your brother? I couldn\u2019t help but think. I gave her a sympathetic smile. \u201cHe thinks you\u2019re in a lot of danger. He\u2019s worried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes he really think Travis would go after me?\u201d</p><p>No way to say this delicately. \u201cHe went after your sister.\u201d</p><p>She ran her tongue over her teeth. \u201cBeatriz was wrapped up with the wrong people. I\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re friends with the cartel that murdered her and your parents,\u201d Camden said, playing Devil\u2019s Advocate.</p><p>She cocked her penciled brow at him. \u201cOh, do tell me what else you know, you American boy.\u201d</p><p>I placed my hand on her arm. \u201cI think Javier has a right to be worried. We need you to leave the city.\u201d</p><p>She gave me a dirty look and shrugged out of my grasp. \u201cThis is my home. I will do no such thing.\u201d</p><p>Javier came out of the washroom, looking slightly more collected. I\u2019d rarely seen him so short-tempered and never expected it with his own sister. But he\u2019d always described Violetta as the youngest, the bratty one, and I could definitely see that youngest sibling/oldest sibling dynamic coming out. It was a bit weird, actually, to see someone as lethal as Javier interacting with someone younger than him, someone that had the power to bring him down and get under his skin. He cared about Violetta a great deal, that much I could tell.</p><p>\u201cEllie is right,\u201d he said, his voice measured. \u201cThat\u2019s why I came. You have to leave, today.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes, shook her head and did all the things a girl her age would do when asked to leave the life she\u2019d built on her own. \u201cI don\u2019t think so. No.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVioletta,\u201d Javier said slowly, coming up to her. His eyes were locked on hers. \u201cPlease. This isn\u2019t an option. You have to go stay with Marguerite or Alana.\u201d</p><p>She laughed, loud and dry. \u201cAre you serious? Mio Dios! You have no idea, do you Javier? I haven\u2019t spoken to those witches for the last eight months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey are your sisters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re my brother!\u201d she suddenly screamed. Her face contorted, all control, all the fa\u00e7ade disappearing in one second. \u201cYou\u2019re my brother and I haven\u2019t heard from you for years! Years! You just left us, all of us! Once Beatriz was gone, it\u2019s like you thought the rest of us died too!\u201d</p><p>She pushed him back with one hand, snatched my beer from me with the other and stormed off to the bedroom, slamming the door behind her. So much dramatic door slamming already.</p><p>Javier looked pale. I almost felt sorry for him until I remembered he\u2019d been lying to me about sending money to his sisters. How much was the price of his rise to the top? How much money had he kept to himself to ensure he could pay off the right people? Not family, not the people who needed it, but the people who could help him with his single-minded goal? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He rubbed his ashen lips together and went to the fridge to bring out a bottle of water. He drank it back in one go and tossed it in the sink when he was done. The air was thick with tension and humidity and I felt awkward, unsure of what to do or say. One glance to Camden let me know that I wasn\u2019t alone. I hadn\u2019t been prepared to be brought into family drama. Then again, neither of us had been prepared for anything really. Except, apparently, for Camden when he shot down that helicopter. He did that with such ease that it floored me and seriously had me hot and bothered every time I thought about it, no matter how inappropriate the circumstance.</p><p>And yeah, standing in my ex-lover\u2019s sister\u2019s apartment was a pretty inappropriate circumstance. I bit my lip and looked away from Camden. Getting turned wasn\u2019t going to help me at the moment and his tight tee-shirt was only making it worse.</p><p>I slowly went to Violetta\u2019s door and rapped on it gently.</p><p>\u201cVioletta?\u201d I asked. I waited, hearing her stirring inside. I didn\u2019t expect her to want to talk to me and I wasn\u2019t sure why I cared so much about getting her safe. If anything, she seemed slightly untrustworthy thanks to her casual ties to Los Zetas. Well, that and the fact that she was related to Javier.</p> <p>Suddenly her door flung open and I jumped out of the way as she marched past me to the front door.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m starving,\u201d she announced, taking her gun and stuffing it in her purse. \u201cWhich one of you people is going to buy me lunch?\u201d</p><p>We all looked at Javier.</p><p>He grunted and went for the door, holding it open for us. \u201cOkay, but we aren\u2019t going far and we are going to talk about this, Violetta.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes and we followed her out.</p> <p>Luckily the caf\u00e9 she was thinking of was only three blocks away. The air had somehow grown more oppressive while we\u2019d been inside, or maybe it was that I felt heavier after meeting Violetta. I could see this wasn\u2019t going to be easy for Javier and unfortunately if it wasn\u2019t easy, it wasn\u2019t quick and if it wasn\u2019t quick, I was further from getting to Gus.</p><p>Though I tried to prevent my brain from going there, I had to wonder what Travis was doing to him right now. There was a cartel leader in the Baja who was infamous for drowning people in vats of acid. I wondered if Travis would do anything so depraved; maybe my leg was just his first little taste. When I had looked at that man, I couldn\u2019t see any trace of humanity in him. He was a shell, a mask, the devil disguised as El Hombre Blanco. Now he had Gus, and he had my mother, and the idea of rescuing them seemed more and more impossible.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Camden said to me, voice lowered, as we walked down the cracked pavement, Javier and Violetta ahead of us. He put his warm hand on the small of my back and I felt both strong and weak at the same time. \u201cHow\u2019re you holding up?\u201d</p><p>I looked up at him, squinting against the sun that fought valiantly through the smog. \u201cI\u2019m holding up.\u201d</p><p>He shot me a smile. \u201cWe\u2019ll get to him, don\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><p>He could read me like a book.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s just every second that we\u2019re here ...,\u201d I started.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll get him,\u201d he said more grimly, then removed his hand. I couldn\u2019t tell who the \u201chim\u201d was in that sentence \u2013 Gus, Javier or Travis? I think if it were up to Camden, he\u2019d get them all in some shape or form.</p><p>The caf\u00e9 was a busy place, noisy and dark and thick with cigarette smoke. Javier was looking paranoid as he scoped the room and I couldn\u2019t really blame him. But everyone in the caf\u00e9 were drinking copious amounts of beer and coffee, ordinary citizens of Mexico City, minding their own business, not even pausing to look up at us.</p><p>We were able to squeeze into a small booth near the back, the Bernals on one side of the booth, Camden and I on the other. Violetta immediately brought out a pack of cigarettes and lit one up.</p><p>\u201cYou smoke?\u201d Javier asked her, looking disgusted.</p><p>She laughed. \u201cWhen did you become so lame? Aren\u2019t you running up a small cartel at the moment?\u201d</p><p>His eyes widened then darted around the cafe but she patted his hand and said. \u201cThis place is cool, it\u2019s cool.\u201d Then she blew smoke in his face and smiled. \u201cCool.\u201d</p><p>She turned to us and said, \u201cSo can one of you tell me what\u2019s really going on here?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s as he says, he just wants you safe,\u201d I said, avoiding Javier\u2019s eyes. Last thing I wanted was for him to think I was vouching for him.</p><p>\u201cSi,\u201d she said, taking another puff. Her eyes darted to him, then to Camden and then back to me. \u201cBut why are you here?\u201d She nods at Camden. \u201cAnd why is he here?\u201d</p><p>Oh boy. Javier\u2019s eyes narrowed slightly, daring me to tell the truth.</p><p>So I did. I took in a deep breath and launched into it. \u201cIt\u2019s a long story, longer than what I\u2019ll tell you. Basically, I knew Camden back in high school and recently returned to my home town of Palm Valley in California. He ran a tattoo shop, was stuck laundering money for his ex-wife\u2019s brothers who have some sort of gang in Cali running guns or pot or whatever. He wanted me to help him escape with the money. I did. Meanwhile, your brother shows up with a fifty-thousand dollar price tag on my head. Goes to Camden. Camden tells me. We go on the run. Javier nearly finds us. Then he bribes my Uncle Jim with the money. My uncle almost turns me over to him, ducks out at the last minute. Javier shoots him in the head.\u201d</p><p>This whole time Violetta had been watching me with her mouth slightly open, forgetting her cigarette existed, the ash piling up on the end. Javier looked stone-faced, not even caring what I was telling her, which of course, was the truth.</p><p>I went on, my voice strained by the memories, \u201cAfter he killed Jim, he contacted us and told me that either I\u2019d go with him or he\u2019d hurt Camden\u2019s son, Ben, and his ex-wife. Camden and I went back to Palm Valley and the exchange was made. I went with Javier, Camden got his son and ex back, plus the money your brother was originally offering people. Only, Camden discovered that everything had been a set up. His ex had gone willingly with Javier. She and her brothers planned to take the fifty grand from him afterward and I\u2019m guessing right now that Javier, you, had everything to do with it. That in the end, Camden would never have gotten very far.\u201d</p><p>He stared right back at me, unflinching. Camden, on the other, was growing tense beside me. I didn\u2019t need to look at him to know he was shooting Javier daggers, that his strong hands were gripping the edge of the table.</p><p>\u201cAnyway,\u201d I said, and brushed the sweat off the back of my neck. Fuck it was hot in here. \u201cJavier\u2019s plan at first was to get me to kill Travis, which I was willing to do ... well, I was willing to help him kill him. We ended up here. Then I find out it wasn\u2019t just Travis, but it was my parents too. That they\u2019d been working with Travis and Javier knew this. I was supposed to be his fucking assassin.\u201d</p><p>Violetta puffed nervously on her cigarette and looked to Javier. \u201cThis true? You wanted her to kill her own parents?\u201d</p><p>Javier swallowed hard but didn\u2019t say anything.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid your brother is sick in the head,\u201d I told her, half apologetic.</p><p>She snorted. \u201cThis much I know.\u201d</p><p>Javier cleared his throat. \u201cEllie,\u201d he spoke softly and folded his hands on the table, \u201cyou\u2019re neglecting to tell her the part where I rescued both you and Camden at Travis\u2019s party, saving you from certain death.\u201d</p><p>Yes. That part.</p><p>I smiled weakly. \u201cI almost forgot. That was after you let them take Gus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGus isn\u2019t my problem. I never asked for him and Camden to come down here.\u201d</p><p>Violetta nodded to Camden. \u201cAnd why did you come down here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you think?\u201d Camden asked, his voice clipped.</p><p>\u201cTo get the girl?\u201d She smiled at the two of us. \u201cWhich would be very romantic if it weren\u2019t for my brother sitting right here, correct?\u201d</p><p>Romantic. I looked at Camden, feeling my face growing hot. I found it romantic. I found it sexy. I found it brave, honest, noble, even dangerous. I found Camden\u2019s devotion to me to fill my soul with a warmth I\u2019d never, ever felt before.</p><p>But how could it be romantic, when I could see the hurt and anger in his eyes, his disappointment in me and what I\u2019d done to him. How easily I tossed away his accountability. This wasn\u2019t romantic anymore, this was tragic and it was all my fault.</p><p>I didn\u2019t need to say that to Violetta though. She only stubbed out her smoke on the table and said, \u201cOh, but I forgot, you aren\u2019t with him.\u201d</p><p>Camden looked at me sharply.</p><p>She went on, \u201cAnd you\u2019re not with my brother. And yet here you all are. Together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s helping us get Gus back,\u201d I said.</p><p>She looked at him. \u201cSo you keep saying. And me. I\u2019m assuming Javi was too afraid to come and get me on his own.\u201d</p><p>Javier sighed and leaned back in the booth. Though her cigarette was out, there was a still a layer of smoke that hung above our heads in the muggy air, the overhead fans doing nothing to disperse it. \u201cI knew you\u2019d be angry with me, Violetta. I thought maybe if you heard the danger from someone else, why you need to leave, you\u2019d listen. You can leave with us, even. We\u2019ll take you where you need to go.\u201d</p><p>Okay, that was a new one. As much as I wanted to help her, once again we didn\u2019t have time to drive her around the country, not with Gus\u2019s life on the line.</p><p>She looked down at her slender hands. \u201cDo you really think that I\u2019m in danger?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell us about your friends in the Zetas,\u201d Javier said by way of answering. \u201cDo they know about me?\u201d</p><p>She shot him a wry smile. \u201cJavi. You\u2019re not exactly big news down here. I\u2019m sorry. You\u2019ve got the Zetas, the Sinoloa, the Baja, the Gulf. The big boys. The big balls. Then you have a bunch of little ones that no one cares about. You\u2019re one of the little ones that no one cares about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept for Travis,\u201d I said.</p><p>She nodded. \u201cSi. Except for him. Who is now with the Zetas. But even Travis isn\u2019t at the top of the food chain. Maybe in Veracruz he is. But it\u2019s Morales and his family in Nuevo Laredo who really run it. Not many people can take a gringo seriously, no matter how many men he tortured and killed to get to the top.\u201d She cocked her head at Javier. \u201cI\u2019m a bit surprised that you\u2019re not in Travis\u2019s position. I\u2019m sure the cartel would rather have you there than a white man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have loyalty,\u201d Javier said simply. \u201cTo our family. As should you, you who is hanging out with these men like it\u2019s no big deal.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cOh, relax. I\u2019m just friends with two guys who do the deliveries, the transporting of the money.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s a good job for them. And no, of course they don\u2019t know who you are or that I even have a brother. You make it easy to pretend you don\u2019t exist.\u201d</p><p>He looked grim. \u201cAnd that may have helped you before, but you can\u2019t afford to take that chance now. I have no doubt that there\u2019s been word about me traveling down the Zeta chain. My cartel might be small, but when it comes to Travis, I\u2019m as big as it gets.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She raised her hand in the air and snapped her fingers for the waiter, who until now had been ignoring our table. \u201cI can\u2019t talk about this anymore without food.\u201d</p><p>The waiter came by and we promptly ordered coffee, beer and food. Though my stomach was growling, I had zero appetite, so just munched the tortilla chips and fresh salsa that came with our drinks. Javier spent the rest of the time trying to figure out a plan for Violetta. Though she was too busy stuffing her face to talk back, I could still see she was going to try and evade this idea for as long as she could. Like her brother, she was stubborn, even in the face of imminent danger.</p><p>CHAPTER FOUR</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until we were done with our meal \u2013 Javier taking care of the check, much to Violetta\u2019s delight \u2013 and were walking back to her apartment that he finally wore her down.</p> <p>\u201cFine,\u201d she said, wiping the sweat from her brow and giving him an exasperated glance. \u201cI\u2019ll go pack a bag. But I\u2019m only going for a few days. I have a job here, a life, I have no intentions of leaving it for good because of you, Javi.\u201d</p><p>I was going to ask her where she was planning on going, if she had friends she could stay with, but thought better of it. Though we were steps from going into her building, we were still in a public place and I was starting to feel the slightest bit uneasy. As she fumbled in her purse for her keys, I paused on the curb and did a quick sweep of the area, shielding my eyes with my hand.</p><p>Jose was parked across the street, looking like a mangled wreck but two cars down there was another mangled wreck, so at least the car didn\u2019t attract any attention here. The sun was damn strong, the air even thicker and browner than before, like hot soup. There were a few squalid looking apartment buildings across the street, white stucco like Violetta\u2019s place, but stained with green sludge. Beside them were tiny, colorful houses in bright greens and yellows. On the balcony of the yellow house, an older woman sat in the sun, sorting through her basket of laundry. In the yard of another house, a skinny dog lapped up a bucket of water.</p><p>\u201cSomething wrong?\u201d Camden asked quietly as Javier berated Violetta for being disorganized.</p><p>I looked up at him and gave a small shake of my head. \u201cI don\u2019t think so. Just had a weird feeling.\u201d</p> <p>He pursed his lips and looked around at all the things I was just surveying. Finally he nodded at Violetta who brought out her keys with a whoop of joy. \u201cWorried for her? Or about her?\u201d he whispered.</p><p>Though I guess I had a right to be suspicious about Violetta herself, I wasn\u2019t for some reason. She wasn\u2019t like her brother. Maybe that\u2019s why I liked her. Or maybe she was like her brother and that\u2019s why I liked her too.</p><p>\u201cI just want to get moving again,\u201d I said and we walked up to the door that Violetta was proudly holding open for us.</p><p>The weird feeling didn\u2019t leave, even as we went inside the elevator and up to her apartment, Violetta protesting it was always too hot to take the stairs. Outside her door, I kneeled down and made sure my Ka-Bar knife and gun were still secure in my boots. When I straightened up, Javier was staring at me with an air of approval.</p><p>Violetta went to put the key in the lock but Javier quickly grabbed her wrist, his eyes burning into hers with warning. He nodded to the door then pushed her out of the way, grabbing his gun from his waistband and holding it loosely to his side. Camden and I took a step back.</p><p>Swiftly, Javier kicked open the door and sprung into the room, his gun drawn. I grabbed my gun from my boot and followed after him, heart racing in my throat as we quickly searched the rooms.</p> <p>When it was all clear, he waved at Violetta to come inside.</p><p>She crossed her arms and huffed her way into the middle of the apartment.</p><p>\u201cMy landlord is going to kill me,\u201d she scowled and waved her hand at the broken lock on the door.</p><p>Javier didn\u2019t smile. \u201cThat shouldn\u2019t have been so easy. You need to be more careful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m taking off for a few days, isn\u2019t that careful enough?\u201d</p><p>He grunted and told her to go pack her bag. She sighed and disappeared into her room, muttering obscenities under her breath.</p><p>\u201cDid you think you heard something?\u201d Javier asked me.</p><p>\u201cWhy, because I was checking my gun and knife?\u201d</p> <p>He nodded.</p><p>\u201cI was just being cautious, Javier,\u201d I told him, slipping my gun back into my boot. \u201cI have learned something from my line of work, you know.\u201d</p><p>He raised his brows in disbelief and I knew he was close to bringing up the foolish mistakes I\u2019d made that allowed him catch me in the first place. I didn\u2019t need the reminder that I wasn\u2019t as good of a con artist as I thought I was.</p><p>I guess he could see the warning in my eyes because a small smile tugged at the corner of his mouth and he turned around.</p><p>Camden cleared his throat and I looked behind me at him. He was leaning his good shoulder against the wall near the door, observing us. I couldn\u2019t read his eyes, though he was swallowing hard and his jaw looked tense. One hand was on his shot shoulder, pressing down lightly. I wondered if he was in pain or had been taking the pills when I wasn\u2019t looking.</p><p>I was about to ask him when a god awful sound buzzed through the room, causing me to jump.</p><p>Javier whipped around. \u201cWhat the hell was that?\u201d</p><p>It sounded again, coming from the intercom. Violetta came out of her room, wiping her hands. She looked at our expressions and said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, it\u2019s probably just a friend\u201d and went for the intercom. She pressed the button and asked, \u201cHola?\u201d</p><p>There was no response.</p><p>That wicked feeling was sweeping through me again, causing all the hairs on my arms and neck to stand at attention. This was bad.</p><p>While Violetta tried the buzzer again, I ran to the window and looked out. The glare from the sun and the dirt on the glass made it hard to see through so I quickly went into Violetta\u2019s room and out to her balcony.</p><p>There was a sea of roofs spreading out before us, the one right next to the building one story below. I craned my neck to look up at the building. I didn\u2019t even know what I was looking for, someone who didn\u2019t belong, I guess.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Camden asked, standing in the doorway.</p><p>\u201cThat feeling I had?\u201d I asked. \u201cI think we have to get out of here. Now.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly the apartment erupted in gunfire and I heard Violetta scream. Instinctively, I ducked, pulling down Camden, and brought out my gun again. Violetta burst into the room as another round of gunfire went off and I quickly motioned for her to come onto the balcony.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d I asked her frantically.</p><p>She was shaking her head and screamed again when more shots went off. The window in the living room exploded into a storm of shattered glass and then seconds later, a tall man went flying out of it. He landed on the roof below, only a ten foot drop, and then staggered to his feet. The minute he looked up at us on the balcony, he yelled something and pulled out his gun.</p><p>I was faster. I aimed, said a prayer, and squeezed the trigger. The gun roared in my hands and the bullet hit the man in his chest, causing him to fly backward. My first thought was, thank god I was better shot this time.</p><p>Then Violetta let out a small sob and it hit me.</p><p>It was a good shot.</p><p>And I\u2019d actually killed a man.</p><p>Me.</p><p>Suddenly I heard Javier\u2019s voice ring out from the apartment amid the gunshots.</p><p>\u201cRun!\u201d Javier yelled.</p><p>Right. I quickly shook my head, trying to focus. There\u2019s was only one place for us to go.</p><p>Camden was already climbing over the railing and helping Violetta over.</p><p>It was only a twelve foot drop or so. It wouldn\u2019t kill us but it wouldn\u2019t feel good either.</p><p>\u201cEllie,\u201d Camden yelled, \u201ccome on!\u201d</p><p>I nodded absently, still dazed, and brought my legs over the side of the railing just as Camden and Violetta dropped to the roof. Camden\u2019s large frame landed with ease, sending the terracotta tiles of the roof flying, while Violetta quickly crumpled to her knees, her flip flops providing no traction. Within seconds Camden was helping her up.</p><p>The roof was almost totally flat, just peaking a bit at the spine, but I still had to be careful how I landed.</p><p>\u201cJump!\u201d Camden yelled up at me as a bullet whizzed past my shoulder.</p><p>I turned to look in time to see Javier bursting through Violetta\u2019s bedroom, simultaneously running toward me and shooting at someone who was in pursuit, the assailant\u2019s gun aimed at me. Javier shot them in the shoulder and in seconds he was beside me, yelling \u201cWhat the fuck are you waiting for, the circus?\u201d</p><p>I stared at him for a moment, wondering why I felt relief coursing through me at the sight of him.</p><p>Then he put his hand on my back and pushed me off the balcony.</p><p>I screamed in surprise but managed to land in the right spot, my shins taking a beating but I still remained on my feet. Gunshots followed and Javier landed beside me seconds later.</p><p>\u201cYou ass!\u201d I yelled at him.</p><p>\u201cKeep running!\u201d he yelled back and started sprinting past me.</p><p>Another bullet went screaming past my ear. Too many close calls and too soon. Too dangerous to even think about it.</p><p>I started running, the tiles sliding under my boots, following behind him. Camden and Violetta were a few paces ahead, slowing down as they came to the edge of the roof. Luckily the next building was the same height and there was no gap in between them. In fact, the sea of roofs on the block all seemed to be together, like one giant, distorted house.</p><p>Another gun shot rang out and beyond the thudding of my heart in my ears, I could hear the assailants landing on the tiles behind us. Motherfucking shit, they were persistent whoever they were.</p><p>We kept running and I willed my legs to move faster as we went from tile, to shingles, to gravel, to stucco, roof to roof to roof. Somewhere in our retreat, Camden and Javier got ahead of us and Violetta started to stagger, her flip flops causing her to stumble so often. I grabbed her by the arm and kept her upright and ran alongside her.</p><p>But I knew the men were gaining on us. And I knew we would run out of luck.</p><p>I squeezed her arm and told her to keep going and then I stopped and spun around.</p><p>A few yards behind us was a lean, dark-complexioned man with an eye patch, ready to take a shot at us. I pulled my trigger before he could, getting him in the stomach by accident.</p><p>The man went down with a scream, his gun shooting at nothing. Fucking Mexican pirate.</p><p>Unfortunately there were three more men behind him, albeit further back. I didn\u2019t have much time to try my luck. I tried to take in a deep breath, my lungs burning from the air pollution and the exertion, and aimed at them. I fired off three rounds and hit only one of them. The remaining too kept coming.</p><p>Time to move.</p><p>I turned around and started running again, surprised to see that not only were Camden and Javier further away but that Violetta had stopped and was looking down at something. I booked it up to her and saw what made her pause. There was a large gap between this roof and the next, though it fortunately was half a story shorter. We could make it if we had a running start, a running start we\u2019d both just lost.</p><p>\u201cFuck!\u201d I yelled then whipped behind me to see how much time we had before our pursuers were at us. Not much. I grabbed Violetta\u2019s arm and started running with her back a few steps. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cReady?\u201d I asked her.</p><p>She nodded, her eyes welling with fear.</p><p>We both started running, as fast as we could, my hand holding hers until we both launched off of the roof and into the air.</p><p>I landed on the roof below, my ankles shuddering in pain from the impact. Thanks to my scarring, they didn\u2019t always hold up after a lot of wear and tear, and I immediately fell to my knees, my legs getting scratched up by the tar shingles.</p> <p>Violetta\u2019s scream came through a second later.</p><p>She had hit the roof, scrambled to hold on then disappeared, falling down the gap to the ground below.</p><p>I looked over the edge and saw her lying in a heap on the dirt alley, holding her arm in pain and crying out.</p><p>Another shot came dangerously close. The men were coming closer. There was no time to think.</p><p>I ran along the roof for a few steps, then jumped down onto a rickety iron balcony that swung with my weight, then launched off of that to the ground below.</p> <p>I ignored my throbbing ankles and hurried over to her just as one of the men appeared at the rooftop. I aimed and fired, all instinct, and got him right in the head. When he pitched off the roof and fell with a thud to the ground beside us, I dragged Violetta up to her feet. There was no time to be gentle. Her arm was probably broken and it was going to hurt like a bitch, but it was better to be hurt than dead.</p><p>\u201cWe have to run, okay?\u201d I told her and she cried in response. I had no idea if Camden or Javier even noticed we weren\u2019t behind them but that couldn\u2019t be my concern. We had to get us safe then we\u2019d get to them.</p><p>And then, then maybe I\u2019d have a moment to think about the people I\u2019d killed.</p><p>Together we scampered down the narrow alley, dirt flying from our feet, just as a bullet ricocheted from the wall. We yelped but kept going, zig-zagging our way toward the street, knowing the last asshole standing was firing at us from the roof.</p><p>As soon as we hit the street that ran along the block of buildings, we were a tiny bit safer. At least I figured since there was light traffic on the roads and people going to and fro. However, despite the fact that I was running across the street and darting between the cars with Violetta in tow, both of us bruised, scratched and bleeding, my gun visible in one of my hands, no one really seemed to bat an eye. I wondered how bad Mexico City was for crime then decided it didn\u2019t matter.</p><p>We ran up the sidewalk until I saw another alley then brought Violetta down that one and around the corner. I stopped us beside a dumpster that sat behind a caf\u00e9, a couple of stray cats sleeping in the shade.</p> <p>\u201cVioletta,\u201d I said to her, putting one hand on her good arm and trying to get her to look at me. Her cheeks were wet and dirty, a mess of mascara and tears. She was shaking and sobbing softly. \u201cVioletta, listen to me. Do you know who those men were?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNo,\u201d she cried. \u201cI didn\u2019t recognize them. Javier told me to go to my room but I wanted to see what was going on. It looked like he heard something out in the hallway. He hid near the door and suddenly a group of men came in the room and started shooting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you didn\u2019t recognize them?\u201d</p><p>She let out a loud sob, shaking her head even more, her forehead scrunched in pain. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t know. They looked like cartel men. Bad men.\u201d</p><p>Obviously.</p><p>\u201cMy arm, I think it\u2019s broken,\u201d she whimpered.</p><p>I nodded. \u201cI know. We\u2019ll get it fixed, but we have to get Camden and your brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cScrew Javier!\u201d she yelped. \u201cHe\u2019s what got us into this in the first place.\u201d</p> <p>I smiled grimly. \u201cI know. But you don\u2019t mean that. You can\u2019t leave him behind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe left me behind! He forgot I existed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd we\u2019re better than that.\u201d I gave her a steady look, my eyes imploring hers. \u201cOkay? We\u2019re going to go back to your place\u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d she cried out.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going back to your place,\u201d I said, my voice harder, \u201cand we\u2019re getting my car. Then we\u2019re going to find them. And then we\u2019re gone. You can do this.\u201d</p><p>I stared at her for a few moments until she relented with a nod. Then we moved down the alley that ran parallel to the main road until we were back on her street. Jose was still sitting on the side of the road.</p><p>Only now I realized that Javier had the car keys.</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d I muttered.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to hotwire it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo do it.\u201d</p><p>I gave her a wry look.</p><p>Suddenly the air was filled with a flurry of shouts and Spanish. I looked over at her apartment building and saw a few men on the balcony of one of the apartments, pointing at us and flipping out.</p><p>\u201cDo it I shall,\u201d I said. I opened the door (no point in locking it since half the windows were shot out) and ushered Violetta into the backseat, where she could lie down, and then jumped into the front. Even though I\u2019d been driving Jose for most of the last six years, my car-stealing skills were still pretty sharp. After crossing wires for a few seconds, Jose roared to life, his engine loud and proud, and I gunned him out of the parking spot just as a group of men came running out of the apartment for us.</p><p>\u201cPersistent,\u201d I grumbled and spun the car around the corner. Despite the circumstances, it felt fucking great to be driving my car again.</p><p>I took Jose zooming down the one-way street, swerving in and out of traffic while trying to keep an eye on the roofs that whipped past us. Dust flew up in our wake, coating us through the windows and I narrowly missed smashing into a motorcycle. I was glad Violetta was in the back and whimpering softly, it made it easier to concentrate when the only screams you heard were in your head.</p><p>My stomach began to twist on itself when I realized I had no idea where Javier and Camden were, if they were still alive, still running. The houses in this barrio kept going on and on, family after family after family packed into these ramshackle dwellings like sweltering sardines.</p><p>I\u2019d almost clipped a bus in front of me when I suddenly saw a dark figure running on the roof, his head disappearing behind the occasional awning and the back of the bus. It was one of the cartel men and he was chasing someone, which had to mean that Camden and Javier were up ahead.</p><p>I exhaled briefly with hope, before pushing the pedal to the floor and going up the shoulder, trying to get ahead of the bus. There was a stack of bicycles up ahead and I was either going to hit them, the bus, or the people on the dirt sidewalk.</p><p>I chose the bicycles. I gunned the car harder, the rear wheels spinning furiously and braced for impact.</p><p>\u201cHold on!\u201d I yelled to Violetta and then screamed as Jose plowed into them. The bicycles flew up onto the hood, cracking the windshield in the corner, before clattering across the roof. \u201cSorry!\u201d</p><p>Then I whipped the car in front of the bus to a round of angry honks from the driver and finally saw Camden and Javier on the roofs, still running for their lives. I grinned to myself, despite the severity of the situation, and let out a relieved laugh. Somewhere in the back of my masochistic head, I had been so certain that Camden would be done for. I hadn\u2019t wanted to think about it but I was sure that Javier would have ditched him along the way. Or killed him.</p><p>\u201cI see them,\u201d I told Violetta.</p><p>\u201cCamden\u2019s still alive?\u201d she asked weakly.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t the only with that idea.</p><p>\u201cSo far,\u201d I told her.</p><p>\u201cI can tell my brother wants to kill him,\u201d she said.</p><p>I rubbed my lips together, my hands gripping the wheel harder. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t yet.\u201d I shot her a look over my shoulder. \u201cJust hang tight okay? I\u2019m going to try and get their attention and pull up ahead.\u201d</p><p>I drove a bit faster, trying to keep up in the traffic that was growing increasingly heavier, and was about to start honking my horn like crazy when I saw the unthinkable happen.</p><p>Javier and Camden both jumped from one roof to another, the gap not too wide, but when Camden landed, it looked like his weight broke through part of the roofing and he went down, sinking in until I could only see him from the shoulders up.</p><p>I gasped, slowing the car so I could watch, the bus behind me honking again.</p><p>The man in pursuit started firing at them, closer now.</p><p>Camden was fucked.</p><p>A sitting duck.</p><p>And Javier ... Javier stopped.</p><p>He stopped and raised his gun and tried to fire off a few rounds at the man but I could see from the frustration in his face that he was out of ammo. He hastily tucked his gun back into his pants and then crouched down to help Camden up.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Violetta asked, trying to sit up. \u201cWhy are we slowing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJavier is helping Camden,\u201d I said absently. I wasn\u2019t sure what to make of it, other than the fact that I was grateful. Cautiously grateful.</p><p>\u201cHow noble of him,\u201d she said, her voice acidic.</p><p>It didn\u2019t matter, soon Camden was on his feet again and they were back to sprinting. I took the car around a rickshaw and started honking the horn wildly. I didn\u2019t care if everyone in the barrio looked over at me. I just wanted them to see me.</p><p>But they didn\u2019t. And I could we were coming up to an intersection where the roofs would end and they\u2019d have to come down. The intersection that had the street on a red light and cars were started to slow in front of me.</p><p>I had to act fast. I brought the GTO onto the dirt sidewalk to get past the traffic and kept laying on the horn, now to get Camden and Javier\u2019s attention as much as the attention of the people I was about to run over. Fortunately, everyone got out of the way and there wasn\u2019t another group of bikes to smash through. Unfortunately, because we were right up against the buildings, Camden and Javier wouldn\u2019t be able to see the car.</p><p>I stuck my head out of the window and started yelling for Camden, shouting his name over and over again. I hoped he could hear me above the noise of the city. There wasn\u2019t much time left. I was almost at the intersection and if they got off the block of roofs and started running, there was a chance I could never find them again in this city.</p><p>The light was still red when we came to it and I wasted no time.</p><p>I spun the car out, turning left onto oncoming traffic and kept another scream inside my burning lungs. Cars were honking as they came toward me. People were yelling and swearing, fists waving outside of windows.</p><p>And I slammed Jose into park and climbed out of the window onto the roof of the car. I stood up unsteadily, mindful that I was precariously perched in the middle of a rush of cars in all directions, some of them slamming their brakes dangerously close to me, and looked to the roof.</p><p>In seconds, Javier and Camden appeared, looking over the edge, trying to figure out a way down, before the commotion I had created caught their eye. I waved my arms over my head until they both spotted me.</p><p>\u201cGet the fuck down here!\u201d I yelled.</p><p>Camden squinted then nodded and I noticed he wasn\u2019t wearing his glasses anymore, while Javier pointed at an awning that sat above a convenience store. They ran over until they were above it, Javier glancing nervously over his shoulder, then with one fluid leap they jumped down onto the awning.</p><p>It crashed and collapsed under their weight and brought them down over crates of fruit, but they were up quickly and running across the road to the car, all while the store owner was emerging from the wreckage and swearing his head off. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I jumped down from the roof and quickly pushed the seat back to make room for Javier. He could sit with his sister and comfort her.</p><p>Camden was going beside me.</p><p>\u201cGet in,\u201d I told them.</p><p>Javier\u2019s eyes locked with mine briefly and he said, \u201cThanks\u201d before slipping inside.</p> <p>I slammed the seat back and got in just as Camden got in the passenger side. Two bullets exploded nearby, one hitting the street, the other hitting the trunk of the car. The man was firing at us from the roof. I had half a mind to fish out my gun again and finish him off, but we had an opportunity to escape and I wasn\u2019t going to lose it.</p><p>I put Jose into drive and peeled out, avoiding the cars that were now making their way around me, zigging in and out until we were on the right side of the road and speeding through the city. The traffic was growing thicker by the moment, but still moving fast enough that I was able to keep up my speeds, as long as I paid close attention to the road.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d I cried out at the same time that Camden did. He was missing his glasses \u2013 his big blue eyes looked startling - and covered in sweat but other than that he looked okay.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to your arm?\u201d Javier asked Violetta. She whimpered in response.</p><p>I eyed him in the rear view mirror. \u201cWe were running and came to that first gap. She fell. I think her arm is broken. I jumped down and we ran back to the car.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDid you kill the rest of the men?\u201d Javier asked, his eyes meeting mine. They danced, looking alive. If he was a lion, his tail would be twitching.</p><p>I swallowed hard and ignored the lump in my chest. \u201cYes. I had to.\u201d</p><p>His lips curled in delight. \u201cI\u2019m impressed.\u201d</p><p>I looked away and back at the road before I nearly took out a green and red taxi cab.</p><p>\u201cDo you know those men, Javier?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cNo. But I bet my little sister here does.\u201d</p> <p>Violetta moaned from the back and at that Camden quickly pulled out a few of his pills from his pocket.</p><p>\u201cVioletta doesn\u2019t know them,\u201d I told Javier while Camden twisted around in his seat and dispensed the pills to her.</p><p>\u201cSo Violetta says,\u201d Javier said.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got to get her to a hospital,\u201d Camden said.</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d Javier said calmly.</p><p>My eyes flew back at him. \u201cNot yet?\u201d</p><p>He smiled, lips tight together. \u201cWe have to go straight to Aguascalientes. It\u2019s about five hours from here, four if you hurry. My friend Dom will be able to help us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs Dom a doctor?\u201d</p> <p>He shook his head. \u201cHe\u2019s part of my cartel and he\u2019s really into bullfighting. I have to talk to him first, tell him the situation. Then we can get Violetta sorted out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut she\u2019s in pain,\u201d I said.</p><p>He shrugged and sat back in his seat, looking away from me, away from her, out the window at the city\u2019s smog-filled sky. \u201cShe got into this mess when she started spreading her legs for the Zetas. She can afford to suffer for a bit.\u201d</p><p>Violetta groaned, writhing in discomfort.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a sick fuck,\u201d Camden seethed at him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to have to start coming up with more original insults. I believe you\u2019ve already called me that before.\u201d Javier looked at him briefly, his face lighting up at the sight of Camden so angry and bothered. \u201cDon\u2019t make me regret not leaving you on that roof to die.\u201d</p><p>Silence filled the car.</p><p>It was going to be a long drive to Aguascalientes.</p><p>CHAPTER FIVE</p><p>We made it to Aguascalientes in just under five hours. Traffic on the main highway was thick and we had to stop to use the restroom and fill up on gas. Thankfully, Camden\u2019s pills worked well on Violetta and she was out like a light for most of the drive, her head on Javier\u2019s shoulder \u2013 though I was sure it wouldn\u2019t remain that way when she woke up.</p><p>I only got to speak to Camden alone, briefly, when I went into the store to pay.</p><p>We were waiting in line at the cashier and he grabbed a bag of the ubiquitous pork rinds you find all over Mexico and tossed them to me. I caught them one-handed and found myself smiling shyly.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to your glasses?\u201d I asked him.</p><p>He bit his lip, his eyes darting to the car. \u201cThey fell off somewhere. Probably when I fell. I can\u2019t remember. That whole thing was ... a blur.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you still see?\u201d</p><p>He smiled all beautiful white teeth, full lips and dimples. \u201cI\u2019m nearsighted. Which means I\u2019ll be a lousy shot until I get a new pair or some contacts. But at least I can see you clearly. The things up close. The things that matter.\u201d</p><p>Boom. There went my heart.</p><p>In the middle of a Mexican convenience store.</p><p>I had a sudden urge to step closer to him, press myself into his chest, find out how clearly he could see me then. But then the clerk was calling us forward and Camden gave me a little nudge. His fingers felt hot and rough on my arm, awakening my skin.</p><p>I smiled at the clerk and awkwardly asked in Spanish to pay for a full tank on the pump we were at but the clerk figured some of it out on his own. While I was handing over the pesos I had, Camden whispered in my ear.</p><p>\u201cI know Javier helped me back there,\u201d he said deeply, shivers going down my neck, \u201cbut don\u2019t you dare start thinking he\u2019s on our side. He\u2019s not. He\u2019s not even on his sister\u2019s side.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo who is on my side?\u201d I whispered back while the clerk counted the money. Funny, back in the day I would have been busy trying to scam my way out of paying for the gas, but the idea wasn\u2019t even an option anymore.</p><p>His lips brushed against my ear, his presence behind me so large and commanding, I was surprised hadn\u2019t filled the whole store. \u201cI\u2019m on your side. I\u2019ll be on your side. All the way, until we get home.\u201d</p><p>Then he turned and walked out of the store and back to the car.</p><p>Until we got home.</p><p>Home seemed like such a strange concept now.</p><p>And what would happen to us then?</p><p>When the clerk was satisfied, I went out to the car, Camden already pumping away. I met his eyes, wondering if I was a blur to him at that distance or if he could fill in the details. Giving him a grateful smile, I got in the car.</p><p>Javier was sitting stiffly in the back, Violetta now sleeping against the far window. The hot and dusty breeze from the highway swept in through the shattered back window, messing her hair. Javier was watching me observe her, thinking, always thinking.</p><p>\u201cYou like her, don\u2019t you?\u201d Javier asked.</p><p>I raised a shoulder. \u201cWhy not? She seems like a good kid.\u201d</p><p>He grunted in disgust and started examining his fingernails. \u201cGood kid. Right. You think associating with the Zetas is good now?\u201d</p><p>I gave him a sharp look. \u201cYou don\u2019t know that those men had anything to do with her. They\u2019re after us in the end, isn\u2019t that what matters?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re after me, angel,\u201d he corrected.</p><p>\u201cThen why take Gus?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey think Gus is of importance to you. They think you are of importance to me. That\u2019s how it goes.\u201d</p><p>They thought I was of importance to him \u2013 but was I? I shook my head, not seeing why I should care, and looked at Violetta. \u201cAnyway, she didn\u2019t know you were coming, Javier. She didn\u2019t do anything. You\u2019re the one who is after Travis.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter Gus, yes, you\u2019ve said that,\u201d he filled in sharply.</p><p>Camden opened his door and climbed in. He eyed me, the tension in my jaw and shoulders and then looked to Javier. \u201cEverything all right in here?\u201d</p><p>I had a feeling Camden wouldn\u2019t need much of an excuse to beat the shit out of Javier again. What I would have given to see that.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Javier said. \u201cJust getting our priorities straight.\u201d He tapped the back of my seat. \u201cYou better get this damn car moving again. I called Dom and let him know we\u2019d be there soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that safe?\u201d I asked him as I started the car and pulled him back on to the highway heading north. \u201cI mean, calling people and letting them know where we are?\u201d</p><p>Javier laughed. \u201cOnce again, angel, I am not Jason Bourne and the government isn\u2019t after me. No one is tapping my phones because no one has this phone number. Except for Dom now. And if I can\u2019t trust Dom, I can\u2019t trust anyone.\u201d</p><p>I definitely didn\u2019t trust Dom. And Camden would be happy to know, I didn\u2019t trust Javier either.</p><p>As soon as we got to the city limits of Aguascalientes, a pleasant looking city at the base of ragged mountains, Javier instructed me to look out for the signs for the Aguascalientes Monumental Bullring.</p><p>\u201cAre we seriously going to a bullring?\u201d I asked. Violetta was awake now, not talking but obviously in pain. Camden had courteously spared her the last of his pain medication but apparently it wasn\u2019t enough. She was trying to keep it together but little bursts of agony would occasionally squeak past her lips.</p><p>\u201cJust do as I say,\u201d was Javier\u2019s answer. I half-expected him to tell me to trust him.</p><p>I grumbled, my hands sweaty on the wheel, my back aching from the drive, but did as he asked. It was all for Gus, all for Gus, all for Gus.</p><p>My mother\u2019s face came flashing into my head, the look of horror when she saw who I was, where I was.</p><p>Yes. This was all for her too, even though I knew she wouldn\u2019t do the same for me.</p><p>I sighed and focused on my new surroundings. The city was actually quite clean and civilized looking, well-maintained with lots of greenery and wide thoroughfares. It wasn\u2019t long until we came to a very high, very round building done up in pinks, oranges and blues.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s like the coliseum on Gay Pride Day,\u201d Camden commented.</p><p>\u201cYou would know,\u201d Javier sniped.</p><p>I shot him a look. \u201cOkay, we\u2019re here. Now what?\u201d</p><p>Javier motioned to the giant parking lot across the street that was emptying out of cars. \u201cPull in there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLooks like the fight is over,\u201d Camden mused, staring at the crowds spilling out of the bullring and into the surrounding plaza.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not here to see the fight,\u201d Javier explained. Thank god. The idea of watching a bull fight made me feel sick to my stomach. I remembered being fifteen years old and actually donating money to some charity at school that was trying to make that event, and other animal sporting events, illegal. Obviously it did shit all. Bullfighting looked to be as popular in Mexico as it ever was.</p><p>I parked the car in an empty spot and Javier tapped the back of my seat to be let out. I sighed and got out. It was cooler here in Aguascalientes, the sky blue even as the sun began to set.</p><p>He started to walk away so I reached out and grabbed his hand.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p><p>He paused and looked down at my fingers around his wrist, then looked back at me, brow raised.</p><p>I immediately dropped his hand like a hot potato and licked my lips nervously. I hated how I couldn\u2019t even touch him without him making a big deal about it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to see Dom,\u201d he said, trying to hide a smile.</p><p>I folded my arms. \u201cI\u2019m going too.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cEllie, he doesn\u2019t know you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll get to know me. I\u2019m not letting you walk in there, leaving me, Camden and your poor sister in the car like easy prey.\u201d</p><p>He frowned and shoved his hands into his pant pockets. \u201cYou\u2019re so mistrustful, after everything I\u2019ve done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause of everything you\u2019ve done.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSuch a short memory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy memory is just fine. I have a hard time thinking that any of the good you\u2019ve done lately, for us, is because you\u2019ve found your soul.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cOh angel, you forget. You\u2019re the only one who gave me a soul. If I don\u2019t have one anymore, it\u2019s not my fault.\u201d</p><p>I automatically dug my nails into my arm in frustration. \u201cI\u2019m going with you,\u201d I said again, making each word sharp.</p><p>He sighed and brushed his hair behind his ears. \u201cVery well. You may come. You better make sure your ape doesn\u2019t try anything with my sister.\u201d He walked off.</p> <p>I turned and looked at Camden who was leaning over my seat, hearing the whole thing. He gave me a grim nod, one I knew meant he\u2019d stay and take care of Violetta, and then mouthed to me \u201cbe careful.\u201d I smiled uneasily and went after Javier. I hoped we\u2019d be quick.</p><p>I also hoped Dom wasn\u2019t waiting for us with a loaded gun.</p><p>Javier didn\u2019t say much to me as we went into the building and unlike the way he was in Mexico City, he was relaxed and confident. Considering the way his sister was, the way we all battled our way from death on those barrio rooftops, he was acting like none of that even happened. I don\u2019t know why I was so surprised \u2013 I guess from the way that Javier would describe his sisters before, they sounded like they meant a great deal to him. After this, I wasn\u2019t sure of that. I wasn\u2019t sure of anything involving him.</p><p>He looked over his shoulder at me as we walked down a cool, linoleum tiled corridor. It felt like we were heading backstage at a concert or a hockey game.</p><p>\u201cI can feel how nervous you are, angel,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s coming right off you, like sweat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you feel this?\u201d I stuck up my middle finger at him.</p> <p>He only looked amused at that. Great.</p><p>We went around the corner to a room that said something in Spanish and Javier lightly knocked on it. A very distinctive knock. Code. Funny how cartels had the same knock as those No Girls Allowed clubs back when I was in middle school.</p><p>We waited for a few moments, Javier looking as cool and collected as he could ever be. Like he didn\u2019t fear a single thing. Like we were on his turf again.</p><p>That could be both a good thing and a bad thing. My gun tingled in my boot.</p><p>Finally the door opened and I was somewhat shocked to see the face of a good-looking man staring back at us.</p><p>\u201cJavi,\u201d he said with an easy smile. \u201cEntrar, por favor.\u201d</p><p>The man brought his dark eyes to me and I could have sworn they were twinkling. His hair was black and cropped short to his head, a layer of thin stubble on his angular face. He was probably in his late thirties and I could see a wedding ring glinting on his left hand. He looked like he\u2019d be a family man, albeit one in Javier\u2019s cartel. He was built like a runner, tall and lean, but like Javier he had fluidity and grace to his movements. He opened the door wider to let Javier in then extended his hand to me.</p><p>\u201cAnd you must be his friend, Ellie,\u201d he said, his voice light but heavily accented. I gave him my hand and he shook it heartily. There was something impish in his expression as he watched me and I had to figure that he knew I once was the infamous Eden, the heartbreaker.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not quite his friend,\u201d I said, my words coming out harder than I meant them to.</p><p>He smiled. \u201cOf course not. Javi doesn\u2019t have friends.\u201d He dropped my hand and welcomed me into the room.</p><p>I went inside and stood against the wall, looking around the room. It looked like an ordinary office, filing cabinets, a messy desk, a fax machine. On the walls were a few colorful paintings of bullfighters.</p><p>\u201cTake a seat,\u201d Dom said as he eased himself into his leather chair and gestured at the two chairs across from him.</p><p>Javier shook his head. \u201cWe have to make this fast. I need your help.\u201d</p><p>Dom smiled and brought out a cigar from his desk, pulling it out of the silver canister. He had no interest in making this fast.</p><p>\u201cCare for a cigar?\u201d he asked Javier. When Javier refused he looked to me.</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>Javier shot me a dirty look but I didn\u2019t care. A cigar would take some of the edge off the day. Hell, it would take some of the edge off the right now.</p><p>\u201cI like you,\u201d Dom said. He lit his own with a thick match from an antique-looking matchbox. After a few satisfied puffs, he pulled out another cigar and offered it to me. I went over to him and took them from him. Both he and Javier watched me closely as I lit it and once I showed that I wasn\u2019t an idiot and knew how to smoke a cigar, Dom murmured something in approval.</p><p>\u201cNow that the formalities are over,\u201d Javier said, glaring at me for no real reason. I glared right back, my eyes cutting through the cigar smoke trailing up from my lips. \u201cWe have something urgent to discuss.\u201d</p><p>Dom nodded. \u201cSi. You\u2019ve said so already. What is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need a doctor, for my sister. Someone who won\u2019t talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich sister?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes it matter?\u201d</p><p>Dom shrugged. \u201cNo, I guess not. What else do you need?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need you to get us to Travis Raines.\u201d</p><p>He frowned and looked at me. \u201cUs? What does she have to do with Travis?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not important,\u201d Javier told him. \u201cWhat\u2019s important is that you\u2019ll do it and do it fast. Dominique, I know you know where he is. This is part of your job.\u201d</p><p>Dom smiled wryly. He had this calm, bemused air about him but underneath it all I could see there was that layer of fear. Whether it was for Travis or Javier, I didn\u2019t know.</p><p>\u201cMy job, Javi, is taking care of my men.\u201d He eyed the paintings on the wall.</p><p>\u201cThe matadors?\u201d I asked.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cNo. Well, yes. But only Americans call them that. We call them Toreros. You see, after Javier decided to restructure the cartel, I was sent back to Mexico. There\u2019s money in bull fighting, yes? There\u2019s not much money in Javi\u2019s business. Not anymore.\u201d</p><p>I could feel Javier\u2019s posture snapping. It was like his mood could change the air pressure in a room, maybe even in a whole building.</p><p>Dom\u2019s eyes flew to Javier\u2019s face which was struggling to stay calm. \u201cSorry, Javi. You know it\u2019s true. Travis took a great deal from us. Well, anyway, no hard feelings from me. I much prefer dealing with bulls here than dealing with the bullshit in America.\u201d</p><p>Javier swallowed loudly. \u201cYou\u2019re still on the payroll, Dom. You owe me this.\u201d</p><p>Dom breathed out through his nose and put his cigar down on the silver ashtray. He folded his hands in front of him. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll be on the payroll till my death, isn\u2019t that the case?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have a lovely wife and two lovely little girls. What were their names again?\u201d</p><p>Dom\u2019s eyes darkened momentarily, like a shadow passed over them. He and Javier stared at each other for a few moments, the clock on the wall ticking loud. Then Dom said, slowly, \u201cEstella and Abril.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. So lovely. They must be what, four years old now? Such a precious age. They live in Aguascalientes still? With your beautiful wife. Does she still work for the bank?\u201d</p><p>Dom was starting to look nervous. I looked to Javier who was as cold as stone except for that cunning look in his eyes. He was threatening him.</p><p>\u201cJavier,\u201d I warned, hoping I wasn\u2019t jumping to conclusions, that they were still just having a simple business discussion.</p><p>\u201cEllie, shut up,\u201d he said, not even looking at me. \u201cThis is for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is extortion!\u201d I cried out.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cNo, this is loyalty. This is Dom proving how loyal he is. He knows he\u2019ll help us get to Travis. I don\u2019t even have to take his children. He\u2019ll do it because he\u2019s loyal. I just like to remind him from time to time that what he has, what I gave him, can oh so easily be taken away.\u201d</p><p>Javier then leaned on the desk, coming closer to Dom\u2019s face, beads of sweat running down his temples. He started speaking in Spanish to him, fast and cutting, too quick for me to pick up on it. Javier\u2019s tone was so smooth that I couldn\u2019t even tell if he was further threatening him or what.</p><p>Dom nodded a few times and averted his eyes. \u201cSi. Comprende.\u201d</p><p>This was ridiculous. I had to wonder what the hell Javier had said, if Dom was agreeing to something that was nothing short of a death wish. I mean, that\u2019s all this could be, couldn\u2019t it? Me, Camden and Javier heading off to find Travis Raines, now, when he knows we\u2019re out there, was a suicide mission. It wasn\u2019t until I saw how reluctant Dom was to get involved that it finally hit home for me, the futility of it all.</p><p>And just like that, my bravado was slowly slipping away, like the wisps of cigar smoke that were trailing up to the ceiling. The thought that I may never get to see Gus again. The fact that Camden and I were heading into something that we most likely would never return from.</p><p>Javier turned his head to look at me, as if sensing my hesitation.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d he said. \u201cEverything is good.\u201d</p><p>More lies. I couldn\u2019t smile. I licked my lips and put my cigar beside Dom\u2019s in the ashtray.</p><p>\u201cThank you for that,\u201d I told Dom earnestly. \u201cI don\u2019t think it can help me anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe must really mean something to you,\u201d Dom said. I looked to Javier in confusion and Dom went on, \u201cNot Javi. This man that Travis has.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cHe does. He came here for me. It\u2019s the least I can do for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well,\u201d Dom said, getting out of his chair. \u201cI will help you, Ellie. I will do this for you, because I like you. I am not doing it for him.\u201d He jerked his head at Javier.</p><p>Javier rolled his eyes. \u201cYou can think of any reasons you want to, Dom, as long as you get the job done.\u201d</p><p>Dom sighed and rubbed his chin. \u201cSi. Always getting things done. Okay, I will write down where to bring your sister. Then I want you to meet me here.\u201d He started scribbling on a piece of paper he tore out of a notebook. \u201cWe can talk there tonight. It\u2019s a bar. Busy but safe. There\u2019s a small hotel attached to it, also a safe place to stay.\u201d</p><p>Javier gently took the paper from his hands and narrowed his cat-like eyes ever so slightly. \u201cIf you are trying to fuck with me ...\u201d</p><p>Dom gave him a small smile. \u201cI\u2019m not an idiot, Javi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat remains to be seen,\u201d Javier replied. Then he straightened up and grabbed my arm, wrapping his fingers around my bicep. \u201cCome on, let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>Dom opened the door and Javier escorted me outside, his fingers digging into my skin.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you fucking touch me,\u201d I hissed at him as he brought me down the hall. People were passing us, giving us dubious glances. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh, give it a rest, angel,\u201d he said, exasperated. \u201cOne minute I\u2019m hurting you, the next minute you like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t liked it for a long time,\u201d I seethed through my teeth.</p><p>\u201cIs that so?\u201d He cocked his head at me. \u201cI could have sworn it was just a few days ago that I last made you scream.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck you.\u201d</p> <p>He grinned. \u201cThat you did, my angel. That you did.\u201d</p><p>I ripped myself out of his grasp before we exited the building. Outside the air was cooler, the sky layered with pink, blue and orange, like the sand art I used to see in the gift shops along the Mississippi coast. As we walked toward Jose, looking more battered than ever in the fading light, I asked him, \u201cAre you sure we can trust Dom?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cCan I be sure? No. But he knows if something goes wrong, he will pay for it in the end. Or, his family will pay and he will have to watch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes everything have to be a threat with you?\u201d What I really wanted to do was call him a sick fuck but he\u2019d heard it too many times already.</p><p>\u201cIf there are no threats, then people die. I don\u2019t feel like dying anytime soon. Do you? Does Camden?\u201d</p> <p>I rubbed my lips together, wishing I had some lip balm on me. Actually, what I really wished for was a long hot shower, then a drink or two, then a few hours by myself to think.</p><p>No. Not by myself. With Camden. I needed him to think with me.</p><p>When we got to the car, he was turned around in his seat and speaking to Violetta. At a closer look, he was holding her hand as she lay in the back. My lungs pinched at the sight, as silly as it was. Poor thing was in agony and I was getting jealous.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Javier asked him as he got into the backseat, Violetta slowly sitting up.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s holding my hand, what does it look like?\u201d Violetta asked snidely. She looked like utter shit. Her face was ashen, her forehead thick with sweat, her lips dry and cracking. A shiver occasionally rocked through her despite my leather jacket that covered her shoulders that Camden must have gotten out of the trunk.</p><p>Camden looked to me and said, \u201cShe\u2019s in a lot of pain.\u201d</p> <p>I nodded. \u201cWe\u2019re taking her to the doctor now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTook you long enough,\u201d she said, then groaned. I noticed Camden squeezing her hand harder. I looked behind me at Javier who was watching them with a look of utter disdain.</p><p>\u201cJavier,\u201d I said carefully, slowly, until he looked at me. \u201cWhere are we taking her?\u201d</p><p>He looked at the piece of paper that Dom had given him. \u201cOutside of town. I know where this is. Take your first left until you see signs for the highway. Take it west.\u201d</p><p>I did as he suggested, hoping the cops wouldn\u2019t pull us over for driving with one headlight. It was Mexico but Aguascalientes was a lot more civilized than Mexico City and Veracruz had been.</p><p>We drove for a few miles outside of the suburbs before we came to a ranch house that was surrounded by darkness, only a few lights on inside. It looked like a farm \u2013 not exactly the place I had been picturing in my head. You know, like a doctor\u2019s office or a hospital.</p><p>\u201cThis better not be another vet,\u201d Camden mumbled. \u201cThough I could use a refill on the dog medication now that we\u2019ve run out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a vet,\u201d Javier said with impatience. \u201cPull up beside the truck there. This is Alonso\u2019s house. He\u2019s part of my ... family.\u201d</p> <p>His cartel. I wondered if he was still on the \u201cpayroll\u201d as Dom seemed to be, if he too was banished back to Mexico when Travis up and switched sides. More and more I was finding out that Javier didn\u2019t have the power I once thought he did.</p><p>We got out of the car, Camden easing Violetta to her feet and supporting her. Javier marched past them, apparently no longer caring that Camden was touching his sister \u2013 not like he was offering to help her himself \u2013 and went for the front door. The path lit up from motion sensor lights.</p><p>He rang the doorbell and we waited a few moments.</p><p>A short man with thick grey hair and mustache eyed us over a pair of square glasses. \u201cSi?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlonso,\u201d Javier said. \u201cComo est a?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJavier?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSi.\u201d</p><p>Alonso rattled off something in Spanish and eyed the rest of us.</p><p>Javier waved in our direction, said something about his sister needing surgery and something else. Probably that we were two gringos and inconsequential.</p><p>Alonso sighed dejectedly and opened the door wider, quickly motioning for us to come inside.</p><p>Camden helped Violetta through, Alonso staring at his tattoos with a mix of curiosity and revulsion. He then looked to Violetta\u2019s arm and nodded grimly.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Alonso said.</p><p>Javier took her from Camden, much to her annoyance and he gave us both a steady look. \u201cHe\u2019s going to fix her. You stay here. If you move, if you run, I will kill you. That is all.\u201d</p><p>Then he, Violetta and Alonso disappeared down a darkened hallway until they entered a brightly lit room at the end of the hall. I could see Violetta\u2019s eyes glinting as she turned her head to look back at us. Then they disappeared behind a dark door, the latch echoing in the quiet house.</p><p>Camden watched the door for a few moments before he folded his arms and looked at me.</p><p>\u201cWhat went on in there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith Dom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Him. He a good guy or a bad guy?\u201d</p><p>My lips twitched in a half-hearted smile. \u201cI don\u2019t think there are good guys and bad guys anymore. I don\u2019t even know what I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEllie,\u201d he said, his voice becoming softer. \u201cYou had to kill those men.\u201d</p><p>I gave him a sharp nod. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had to do some things that I\u2019m not proud of too.\u201d There was a rawness in his tone, like he was close cracking open. \u201cI don\u2019t think you and I can ever go back to being the people we were before.\u201d</p><p>His words hit me hard, splicing me open. It wasn\u2019t that I couldn\u2019t go back to being me \u2013 I was never very good to begin with \u2013 but that if we\u2019d both changed, could we find each other again as we had before? Did Camden lose himself in order to save me, and if he did, did that mean I\u2019d lost the Camden that loved me?</p><p>Violetta\u2019s scream pierced through my thoughts, jolting me into the present. I was about to take off toward the room when Javier came out, strolling toward us casually, his face in shadow until the last minute.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d I exclaimed.</p><p>\u201cHe set her arm,\u201d he said. He walked over to the bar and pulled out a crystal bottle of dark amber liquid, pulling the top off with a pop.</p><p>\u201cWithout any pain medication?\u201d Camden asked incredulously.</p><p>He calmly poured the liquid into a textured highball glass and swirled it around. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a lot of time. She bit down on something, don\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry?\u201d Camden sneered, stepping up to him.</p><p>Javier sipped his drink and winced, peering at the glass. \u201cI\u2019m fairly sure Alonso made this in his bathtub.\u201d He eyed Camden with amusement. \u201cAnd yes. Don\u2019t worry. She\u2019s my sister. I know what\u2019s best for her. She\u2019ll be on some pain medication, the good kind, better than that monkey shit you were given.\u201d</p><p>Camden\u2019s fists clenched and Javier saw that too.</p><p>\u201cEasy there, big boy,\u201d he said, grinning. He finished the rest of the drink and slammed the glass down. He wiped the back of his hand across his snaking lips. \u201cYou\u2019re so overprotective over the ladies. They\u2019re a lot tougher than you give them credit for, you know.\u201d</p><p>Javier winked at me and went back down the hall. Camden went to the bar, snatched the booze off the table and then stormed out the front door and into the emptiness of the night, perhaps hoping to drink the rage out of him.</p><p>I didn\u2019t know what direction to go. Camden wanted to be alone and I didn\u2019t want to be with Javier.</p><p>I sighed and sat down on Alonso\u2019s couch.</p><p>And waited.</p><p>CHAPTER SIX</p><p>\u201cEllie, do you mind sleeping with me tonight?\u201d</p><p>I looked behind me at Violetta. I was pulling Jose up to the motel that Dom had recommended. It was actually a clean-looking place, quite busy, with noise thumping from the bar at the end of the row. That was where Dom had wanted to meet us.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love to,\u201d I told her.</p><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s not one Bernal, it\u2019s another,\u201d Javier remarked.</p><p>I glared at him though he didn\u2019t seem to notice. Instead, he merely tapped the front of the seat so I could let him out. Camden was still asleep from the alcohol he downed, his head resting against the window.</p><p>We had been at Alonso\u2019s for about an hour. Eventually Violetta was brought out to us, high as a kite on morphine and with a sling around her shoulder, protecting the makeshift cast covering her arm. Camden had successfully drunk half the bottle of mystery booze and had lapsed into an even more quiet and introverted state. Alonso didn\u2019t seem to mind, he just wanted us out of his house and gone. I wondered if he really was a doctor, and if so, if he was still practicing. The more I learned about the cartels and the people tied to them, the more their history interested me. I couldn\u2019t imagine someone like Javier being anything else before becoming a drug lord and I couldn\u2019t see him going on to any other career if he had to. This was Javier\u2019s past and future, this was his destiny, and nothing else would ever compare to that.</p><p>I certainly never did.</p><p>Don\u2019t get me wrong, I wasn\u2019t feeling sorry for myself. I knew now what I didn\u2019t know then, that for some people love was never enough. It\u2019s just sad that I had to learn that twice, two lessons six years apart.</p><p>Okay, maybe I was feeling a little bit sorry for myself. It was hard not to when I was reminded of what I had with Camden and what my actions had cost me.</p><p>We stepped out of the car, Camden slowly stirring awake, and surveyed the area. So far so good. Nothing suspicious, no one out to kill us. Not yet, anyway.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get us the rooms,\u201d I said, about to walk off but Javier pulled me back.</p><p>\u201cWith what money?\u201d he asked.</p><p>I pulled out my wallet from my back jean pocket and waved it at him. \u201cThere\u2019s more than a few lives in that car, more than a few credit cards. One of them will work.\u201d</p><p>He raised his brow. \u201cPerhaps you should start taking inventory of your stuff before you begin making assumptions. You know what happens when you assume, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>I rolled my eyes. \u201cYes, they make an \u2018ass\u2019 out of \u2018u\u2019 and \u2018me\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey get you killed,\u201d he said quickly. He pushed me back slightly and took off for the motel office, tossing over his shoulder, \u201cI\u2019ll get this. And yes, I\u2019ll make sure you and Violetta can share a room together.\u201d</p><p>Oh, of course, like he was letting us. The ass always had to be in control.</p><p>I turned to see Violetta and Camden standing beside each other and leaning against the car in matching poses, her dark skin glistening in the heat of the night, his body, strong yet tired. Both of them were a little fucked-up in the head at the moment, their eyes glazed, their half-smiles loopy. I had to admit, I was kind of envious. It would be nice to be oblivious to the shit going on around me at every given turn. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Javier did have a point though. Once he came back with the room keys \u2013 Violetta and I were sharing one but Camden and Javier had separate rooms, thank god \u2013 I decided to take everything out of my trunk and start going through them. My aliases needed organizing. If we ever did return to America, I\u2019d have to choose a new life to live, a new person to become.</p><p>I was exhausted thinking about it.</p><p>Maybe, just maybe, I could pick one life and stick with it for a long time.</p><p>I looked over at Camden who was helping take stuff into my room, Ziploc bags of license plates, boxes of falsified papers, IDs, checks. This new life felt entirely dependent on one thing.</p> <p>Him.</p><p>The motel room was a lot nicer than the one we stayed at before. Sort of a Best Western, middle-ground quality of place. No roaches on the floors, no geckos on the wall. Shit mattresses, I discovered as I pounded my fist on the bed, but I didn\u2019t care.</p><p>Camden had just put the final box on my bed, Violetta sprawled out on hers in a state of drug-induced euphoria, when I noticed Javier lingering at the doorway.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to be meeting Dom in about twenty minutes,\u201d Javier said to me. \u201cIs that enough time for you to get ready?\u201d</p><p>I frowned and he quickly added, \u201cYou know he\u2019ll want you there, if this is going to get anywhere. I figured you might want to shower and look nice.\u201d</p> <p>He rapped his fingers along the doorframe, his mouth opening as if to say something else, then he turned and walked off.</p><p>Camden eyed me. \u201cI\u2019m going with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou might be kind of drunk, Camden,\u201d I told him, though the determination in his voice warmed me like the finest cognac.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never felt better,\u201d he said, enunciating each word. His eyes, my god they were still such a clear fucking blue, even in the pallid light of the hotel room. They bore into me with such startling clarity, sending shivers down my back like trailing fingertips. He would be coming with me.</p><p>I wished he\u2019d be coming in me. A vision of us in this hotel room, alone, him nailing me to the bed, the headboard banging, slammed into my head.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay with that?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>I suppressed the thought, the flare of heat between my legs, and smiled quickly. \u201cYes, of course.\u201d</p><p>Meanwhile Violetta\u2019s head flopped to the side, her arm still bound to her stiffly in the sling, and started snoring lightly. I motioned to her. \u201cDo you think it\u2019s safe to leave her here?\u201d</p><p>He watched her for a few moments, blinking a few times, before saying, \u201cI think she needs to sleep it off.\u201d He went and sat down on my bed. \u201cI\u2019ll be here when you get out.\u201d</p><p>I grabbed my bag of clothes I had brought out of the car and brought it into the bathroom. I had a quick shower, trying to rub off all the grime \u2013 both real and imagined \u2013 with the flimsy hotel soap, then picked through my clothes. Everything that had been in my trunk was musty and wrinkled, some even dirty. I had a packet of unopened (and decidedly unsexy) Hanes underwear, a bra, another pair of jeans, a pair of gladiator sandals that I thought were dressy enough, a pair of Timberland hiking boots, a plain white tee shirt, a couple of wife-beaters, a coral-colored blouse, a plaid shirt, and a light blue tank dress that went to the ground. I wasn\u2019t exactly known for my fashion sense and even with the cherry blossoms covering the scars on my leg, bringing me beauty that I didn\u2019t have before, I didn\u2019t see myself branching out anytime soon. Dressing up in my old clothes for Javier hadn\u2019t exactly helped either.</p><p>I slipped on the tank dress, opting to go commando for the evening, and put on the sandals. I looked at myself in the mirror. Once again, I felt like a different person was staring back at me. This me, this Ellie, was tired and hardened. I rubbed the residue mascara away from under my eyes and applied a new coat. My skin was brown from the sun now and I didn\u2019t need much else.</p><p>When I came out of the bathroom, Camden straightened up on the bed. I felt strangely shy in front of him, especially as his eyes trailed up and down the length of me.</p><p>\u201cDo I look okay?\u201d I asked him, feeling the need to say something. \u201cI mean, if you can see me, that is.\u201d</p><p>He bit his lip and stared, a multitude of emotions flashing through his eyes, too fast for me to pick up on each individual one. I thought I saw lust in there \u2013 maybe that\u2019s what I wanted to see.</p> <p>When he still didn\u2019t say anything, I walked over to the dresser where I had my clutch purse left over from the other night at Travis\u2019s and rifled through it for my lip stuff. His silence at my back was a heavy weight, laden with too many uncertainties between us. It was eating at me, burning through me, rendering me with a lead heart. There were so many things I had to focus on, to worry about, fucking impossible things, and yet I needed him to tell me I looked beautiful. I needed him to tell me I was something to him.</p><p>I heard him get off the bed and walk toward me, that heaviness, that warmth that he brought with his bones, teased at my back. He stopped, close enough to touch me, and I was about to turn around, perhaps to do something foolish, when he crouched down.</p><p>\u201cHow is my art?\u201d</p><p>His hands found my leg, one of them lifting the hem of my dress, the other slowly moving over the cherry blossom tattoo. I sucked in my breath, holding completely still, trying to contain my nerves that were firing wildly as his fingers ran along the ridges of the ink. He touched me gently over every vine, leaf and petal, until I had to supress a shaky moan that tried to escape from my lips.</p><p>\u201cIt feels fine,\u201d I said softly when I found my voice.</p><p>\u201cIt looks beautiful,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI had a beautiful artist,\u201d I told him. I turned at the waist and look down at him, my blue dress glowing in his tanned hand, his other one placed firmly around my calf, his strong fingers imparting heat that sunk deep. He was looking up at me, lips parted slightly.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t take a second more of this.</p><p>I turned and dropped to the ground, my knees rubbing against his.</p><p>I grabbed his face, his rough stubble pressing into my palms, and kissed him.</p><p>Hard.</p><p>There was surprise for a second, a hesitation, a pulse that refused to beat on. Then Camden kissed me back, his soft lips enveloping mine, his mouth opening to give me life. He put his hand behind my head, holding it there with power and control.</p><p>My heart was an elevator car, the cable suddenly snapped, and I was freefalling and falling and falling as his lips and tongue and hot, wet mouth took away every inch of my resolve. The more he kissed me, the deeper and longer we found each other, the thirstier I got for him. I felt like if we stopped, I would die, empty on the inside and forever longing.</p><p>\u201cEllie,\u201d he whispered into my lips. \u201cI ... can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>And I was empty.</p><p>I pulled away and looked at him, fighting the tears of frustration that were tickling behind my lids. \u201cYou can\u2019t what?\u201d</p><p>A jarring knock at the door prevented him from finishing his sentence.</p><p>The door swung open and Javier stepped in. He eyed the two of us, crouched together on the floor, our hands entwined in the other\u2019s hair, our chests heaving and unseen hearts hurting. Breaking.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t what?</p><p>Do this?</p><p>Love me?</p><p>I didn\u2019t even care that Javier was watching us, waiting for us to say something, to explain ourselves. I cared about what Camden was going to say next.</p><p>\u201cWell, isn\u2019t this awkward,\u201d Javier said. Though his tone was light there was no mistaking the fire that was burning in his eyes. He looked at me like he was ready to slit my throat and be done with it. He didn\u2019t even give Camden a second look \u2013 this was all about me.</p><p>He finally tore his eyes away from us and over to the bed where Violetta was sleeping soundly. He made a tsk-ing noise and shook his head. \u201cAnd you were about to fuck each other in front of my sister, is that right?\u201d He looked back at me, chin down, lips pouting ever slightly. \u201cI never pegged you to be such a whore.\u201d He smiled as if forgetting his manners, adding, \u201cAngel.\u201d</p><p>It didn\u2019t sting. It didn\u2019t hurt me. I wouldn\u2019t let him hurt me anymore.</p><p>But Camden sprung up as if he had been waiting for this and launched himself at Javier, his fists flying. Javier was quick too, and managed to duck, though not without Camden clocking him on the side of the head with a powerful blow.</p><p>The two of them tumbled to the ground, crashing against one of the bedside tables. Violetta didn\u2019t stir, not even when I started yelling at them to stop it. I know I\u2019d said I wanted to see this fight happen, but not now, not like this. This wouldn\u2019t bode well for Camden and I, especially if Camden won again. Javier would never ever let him live that down.</p><p>Perhaps not even let him live.</p><p>Javier was fighting back, dirty, of course. His physical strength was no match for Camden\u2019s and he repeatedly went for Camden\u2019s injury on his shoulder, with every jab and hit he had. He was cruel and ruthless and got the job done. At one point Javier stuck his thumb hard into Camden\u2019s bullet wound until Camden released him, crying out in horror.</p><p>This was my chance.</p><p>I leaped onto Camden\u2019s back, wrapping my arms around his neck and good shoulder.</p><p>\u201cStop it!\u201d I screamed in his ear. \u201cThis is what he wants.\u201d</p><p>Violetta mumbled something at that, then adjusted herself on the bed and fell asleep again.</p><p>I looked up at Javier who was getting to his feet, his lip bloody again, his suit disheveled. He grinned, enjoying himself, and let out a wicked laugh. \u201cYou have no idea what I want.\u201d He wiped his fingers across his lips and raised his dark brows at the blood on it. \u201cHuh. Not even sure how you managed to do that again. You know, if you\u2019re not careful Camden, you\u2019re going to end up with nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd yet you still haven\u2019t killed me,\u201d Camden said with effort. I could feel his heart racing in his chest, the rage that wanted to keep flying out of him until Javier was a lifeless pulp.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say anything about killing you,\u201d Javier said. \u201cI just said you\u2019ll end up with nothing. And you will. You want to help Ellie get the things she wants, you have to start playing a lot nicer than you have been. A lot nicer.\u201d He sighed and smoothed his hair behind his ears. \u201cEllie, if you want to see your Gus again, you come with me. Right now.\u201d</p><p>He went for the door and I climbed off of Camden and said, \u201cNot without him. I\u2019m not doing this without Camden.\u201d</p><p>Javier looked to the ceiling and mouthed something to the heavens, like he was arguing in Spanish with God. He exhaled long and slow through his nose. \u201cFine, bring the ape with you, as long as he can keep himself under control. Other people might not be as forgiving as I am.\u201d</p><p>Camden stiffened under my fingers and I willed him to calm down, even though I had to bite my own tongue to keep from saying something. The penny-taste of blood filled my mouth but I only nodded and said, \u201cCome on, Camden. We need to think about the big picture.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe picture is bigger than you know,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>I was about to ask him what he meant when he brushed me aside and threw his shoulders back, walking up to Javier, looking large and in charge.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re ready,\u201d he said loudly, standing right behind him, his eyes bearing down. I watched their silent exchange for a moment, the complexity in their eyes as they matched against each other in a visual war. The snake and the bear, the man of stealth and lies, the man of soul and strength. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Both men who had a stake in my heart at some point in the game.</p><p>This ever-changing game.</p><p>Javier finally stepped back, flourishing the act with his arm. \u201cAfter you,\u201d he said, his words dripping with venom. He looked to me. \u201cCome on, angel.\u201d</p><p>I grabbed my purse and headed to the door. I was halfway out of it when Javier\u2019s hand slipped around my waist and he whispered, \u201cYou look beautiful.\u201d</p> <p>I twisted away from his touch and quickened my steps so I was walking beside Camden. He didn\u2019t look at me but his temples were twitching as he tried to keep his temper under control. I felt like we kept on taking one step forward together, two steps back, and Gus kept slipping away all the same.</p><p>The bar was dark but not dingy, small but not cramped. It looked like a good mix of locals and vacationing Mexicans who were staying at the hotel. Camden and I were the only gringos in the whole place but no one seemed to notice. They were all too busy laughing and drinking, having a good time.</p><p>In the corner of the bar, closest to an old pool table, was Dom. He was sitting with someone now and I could hear Javier mutter, \u201cFucking animal,\u201d under his breath. I turned to look at him, to gauge his reaction, but Javier pushed past me and went up the table with open arms.</p><p>\u201cEsteban, you bastard!\u201d Javier exclaimed, grinning from ear to ear.</p><p>The man, Esteban, got up and the two of them embraced. Once I got to the table, smiling politely at Dom, I got a better look at Esteban.</p> <p>He was around six feet, medium-build, light olive skin and bright hazel eyes, hair done up like a surfer, all shoulder-length straggles, dark brown with sun-bleached strands. He looked to be about our age, late twenties, and could have been a Matthew McConaughey\u2019s Doppelganger if it wasn\u2019t for the fact that he had a swath of lacerations on the left side of his face. It was weird to see someone so beautiful and ugly at the same time. He was scarred just like me, only his were visible for all the world to see.</p><p>And yet here he was, smiling and greeting Javier like old chums, not making any apologies for himself, for what had happened to him, for the scars he had to bear. He embraced it. Like, fuck it, this is me.</p><p>After the two embraced, Esteban sat back down and immediately looked to me. He didn\u2019t say anything though, just pressed his pretty lips together into a small smile. His eyes did most of the talking. He knew who I was. He eyed Dom and a similar look was exchanged.</p><p>Javier looked to Dom. It was odd to see him so genuinely happy to see someone. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me he was coming?\u201d</p><p>Dom smiled. \u201cI wanted to show you that I too have a few surprises up my sleeve.\u201d He nodded at Camden and I. \u201cPlease sit down, Ellie. And you must be Camden.\u201d</p><p>Introductions were quickly made by me since Javier wasn\u2019t stepping up to the plate.</p> <p>\u201cGot something on your lip there?\u201d Esteban pointed at Javier.</p><p>Javier dabbed his bruised lip, a spot of blood coming away. He smiled quickly. \u201cIt\u2019s a tough business.\u201d</p><p>Camden quietly snorted beside me but thankfully kept his mouth shut.</p><p>I leaned on the table, my hands clasped under my chin and eyed Esteban and Dom. \u201cBefore we start getting into the real reason we\u2019re all sitting here, Esteban, why don\u2019t you tell me how you come into all of this.\u201d</p><p>Dom let out an amused gasp and sat back in his chair. He watched Javier for his reaction, knowing he was going to be slighted from me taking the reins of this whole thing, of his cartel. But fuck it. This was my mission more than anything. And if I was going to risk our lives to get Gus, I had to know exactly who everyone was and how they were playing into it.</p><p>Esteban raised his brows and said, in near-perfect English, \u201cWell, Miss Watt. My brother used to work for Javi\u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe still does,\u201d Javier interjected.</p><p>Esteban gave him a look. \u201cYes. But I haven\u2019t heard from him in a while and I am sure you haven\u2019t either. Anyway, I joined in after Travis. I\u2019m part of the new and improved cartel. The younger one. The stronger one.\u201d He grinned. \u201cOf course, things don\u2019t always go as planned. I got into a, well, a scuffle down here with another cartel. I should say, the police that the cartel was paying off. Not the Zetas, the Gulf. But what does it matter what cartel it is, right? Alliances mean nothing these days. So in this scuffle, I had a load of shrapnel to my face and was presumed dead. I wasn\u2019t, hey. But let them think that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou let me think that,\u201d Javier said. \u201cYou let Alex think that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was for the best,\u201d Esteban said.</p><p>\u201cAlex is your brother?\u201d I asked him, remembering all too well the other henchman of Javier\u2019s.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI saw all the fine ladies he was pulling in with his new cars and suits and wanted in.\u201d He winked at me then waved over the waitress.</p><p>We all shut up while she came by and took our orders (more beer, naturally), then as soon as she was gone, I launched into more questions.</p><p>\u201cSo why are you here now?\u201d I asked him.</p><p>He gave Javier a look, as if saying ain\u2019t she the eager beaver. Then Esteban gazed me directly in the eye, unblinking, piercing. Suddenly, terribly serious. \u201cBecause Javier and Dom cannot do this on their own. You cannot do this on your own. Travis\u2019s compound is in the east of the Honduras. Right in the heart of the jungle. Not even accessible by road. They chopper in and out. We can\u2019t do that. We have to hike it and it takes several days. Then when you get whoever you\u2019ve come to get, it won\u2019t be so easy to leave.\u201d He took a swig of his beer. My limbs felt leaden at the news. I had imagined him being in a house similar to the one in Veracruz, not a fortress in the middle of a jungle, not some place we\u2019d have to hike to. \u201cSpeaking of, this man that you say Travis has, Gus? There\u2019s a woman too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, so I hear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill they be expecting Ellie?\u201d Javier asked.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI think so. But maybe not you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow could they not be expecting Javier?\u201d Camden asked suddenly. \u201cThey\u2019ve been chasing us all over.\u201d</p><p>Esteban gave a half-shrug. \u201cIt\u2019s just a hunch. Anyway, it doesn\u2019t matter who they expect because we will go there all the same and when we do we\u2019ll all be dead to them, equally.\u201d</p><p>I sighed and put my head into my hands. This was getting more and more impossible by the moment. I felt Camden\u2019s hand on my knee, giving it a squeeze, but even that didn\u2019t help.</p><p>\u201cNo one said this would be easy,\u201d Dom said gently.</p><p>Such concern from the cartel. How nice.</p><p>\u201cWhen do we go?\u201d I said, straightening up and running my hands down my face. \u201cWhat do we need to do?\u201d</p><p>Esteban eyed Javier, as if he was unsure of his place to speak now.</p><p>Javier took it and ran with it. He pushed his chair back and leaned into it, his legs splayed, his beer dangling from his fingers.</p><p>\u201cThis is what we\u2019re going to do,\u201d he said smoothly. \u201cThe five of us will head to Honduras. I\u2019m sending Violetta away in the morning. Dom, we\u2019ll need someone to take her to Puerto Vallarta. She can stay with her sisters or not but I want her out of the picture. Este, you gather what information you can. You\u2019re the tech expert here. The logistics of the operation have to be sound. I mean asshole tight, you understand? If we need more than us five, then you bring a few more in. Just remember, I want this as small as possible. The more people who know, the more we\u2019re at risk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan the five of us really get into Travis\u2019s place and get my mother and Gus out?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Javier smiled patronizingly. \u201cMy dear, I think you\u2019re underestimating me. You don\u2019t need to match his team to win. Besides, I don\u2019t plan on killing everyone there. I only plan on killing him and whoever else gets in my way. The others, they will surrender to me once he is gone. We need a small team, maybe six of us if we have to. With the best weapons. The best tech. The best ... depravity.\u201d He slammed back the rest of his beer and slammed it on the table. \u201cHave a little faith.\u201d</p><p>His words rumbled through me like a heavy bass chord.</p><p>Faith.</p><p>Another thing I\u2019d lost along the way.</p><p>CHAPTER SEVEN</p><p>We didn\u2019t stay at the bar too much longer. After we said goodbye to Dom and Esteban (who started insisting I call him Este), we went back to our rooms. I desperately wanted to follow Camden into his, but I said goodbye to both men at once and Camden went in his room first. Javier was further down, lingering at his door, watching me in silence. His face was in shadow but I could still feel his eyes, his hesitation, as if he wanted to say something to me.</p><p>There was no hesitation on my end. I gave him a hard look and went to my room. Violetta was in the washroom, the tap running.</p><p>\u201cEllie?\u201d she called out from behind the closed door.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here,\u201d I told her and climbed into my bed. A tank dress was no different than a nightgown and I wasn\u2019t chummy enough with her to sleep naked.</p><p>The bathroom door opened and she staggered out. From the weak light that lit her up from behind, I could see she looked pretty wrecked. Or wrecked but still pretty, as it seemed to be the case with her.</p><p>\u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d I asked. \u201cHow\u2019s your arm?\u201d</p><p>She gave me a sloppy smile and eased herself into bed. \u201cI feel kind of sick and I can\u2019t feel my arm. But I don\u2019t feel any pain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEllie,\u201d she said softly. \u201cWhat\u2019s going to happen to me?\u201d</p><p>I turned my head on the pillow and looked across at her. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>She sighed and looked up at the ceiling. I had an idea of what Javier\u2019s nose must have looked like before it was broken a million times. \u201cI have a bad feeling. I\u2019ve had it for a week. That I\u2019m going to die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to die, Violetta. Javier wouldn\u2019t let that happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know that\u2019s not true. Javi always acted like he cared more than he did. Even when I was younger, he would be nice to me if it got him something, maybe a treat from mom. Or he did it because it was expected. I don\u2019t know if he cares if I\u2019m alive or dead.\u201d</p><p>I licked my lips, thinking back to the conversation in the bar. \u201cI know he wants to keep you safe. He may have a funny way of showing things but he does care about you. He wouldn\u2019t have come this way if he didn\u2019t have to. Tomorrow he\u2019s going to send you away from all of this.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cLet me guess, to see my sisters?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to get mixed up in this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI already am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not too late to get out. And I, I will make sure you\u2019re taken care of.\u201d</p><p>She turned her head to look at me, her eyes glinting in the dark. \u201cYou\u2019re nothing like him, you know.\u201d</p><p>The back of my neck tingled. \u201cI\u2019m not?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head slowly. \u201cNo. I thought you would be. But you\u2019re not.\u201d</p><p>I could barely find my voice. \u201cI wasn\u2019t a good person. I was a con artist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. You left that out earlier when you told your little story, but I know. What difference is it what you were? You\u2019re not conning anyone now are you? You\u2019re risking your life to save somebody. You risked your life to save me and you don\u2019t even know me. You could have let me fall and ran on but you stopped and you helped me. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything more noble than that. You have more courage than any of those cartels do. They wouldn\u2019t even do that for each other. It\u2019s every man for himself. You\u2019re not like that.\u201d She paused. \u201cAnd neither is Camden.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She was at least right about him. But when you\u2019re told over and over again about how immoral you are, how bad, how wicked, how unlikeable, how terrible you are, it\u2019s hard to hear anyone say any different. I felt like a fraud being good just as I felt like a fraud being bad.</p><p>\u201cCamden is a good man,\u201d I whispered, a pit lodged in my throat. \u201cToo good for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you say he\u2019s not your man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. He\u2019s no one\u2019s.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf you say that then you don\u2019t see what I see.\u201d</p><p>I smiled weakly. \u201cWhat do you know? You\u2019re high on morphine.\u201d</p><p>She giggled. \u201cThis is true. But I know love when I see love. You never forget your first love.\u201d</p><p>Javier was my first love. That was always a hard pill to swallow. \u201cNo. I suppose you don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst love or not, it\u2019s what you have now that matters. And you have Camden. You should be with him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that simple.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThings are only complicated if you make them. Believe me, I know. I wanted everything at one point. Then I lost my parents, a sister, and in a way, I lost a brother. After Beatriz died, Javier changed. And then I realized I didn\u2019t need everything, I just needed people to love. That was it. Only people to love and to love me.\u201d</p><p>Tears welled up behind my eyes. I didn\u2019t really know Violetta. I didn\u2019t know exactly what she\u2019d gone through. Yet still, her words could have been my words.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad I met you,\u201d I told her, my voice choking up. \u201cReally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame here. Just ...\u201d she trailed off.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>Her features softened in the dark. \u201cBe careful. Javi may have loved you ... and maybe he still does. But don\u2019t think he wouldn\u2019t throw you under a bus in order to get what he wants.\u201d</p><p>And what if what he wants is still me? I thought. And what happens when he figures out he can\u2019t have it?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll remember that,\u201d I told her. We lapsed into silence, her breath becoming steady.</p><p>I fell asleep thinking about jungles and guns and death and blood. I dreamed about Camden, Gus, Violetta and I buried under a landslide, and Javier on the mountaintop, one foot on my mother\u2019s severed head.</p><p>I woke up soon after that and never got to sleep again.</p><p>By the time the sun rose in the air, blanketing the surroundings in warmth, bare, distant mountains looking remarkably clear against a blazing blue sky, I was already dressed and packed. Violetta woke up in pain, so I left her to visit Javier\u2019s room for more medicine. I knocked on the door and held my breath, hoping he wasn\u2019t going to give me too much trouble over this.</p><p>He answered it, the chain across the door, one golden eye peeking through.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p> <p>I rolled my eyes at his formality. \u201cCan I come in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, really?\u201d</p><p>I stuck my boot in between the door and the frame. \u201cYes. Now.\u201d</p><p>He grunted and closed the door, forcing my boot out of the way. Then I heard the chain slide across and he opened it.</p><p>He was only wearing a towel again.</p><p>Fuck my luck.</p><p>Do you just walk around naked all the time, I wanted to say. But I knew the answer was yes and his ego would blow up at the fact that I\u2019d noticed.</p><p>I didn\u2019t let my eyes stray south for a second longer and walked into the room, looking around.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s the morphine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little early to be getting high, Ellie,\u201d he said, his fingers toying with the edge of his towel as it snaked across his waist. \u201cHad I known you were into the poppies, I would have done away with all the cocaine.\u201d</p><p>I crossed my arms and looked at him dead on. \u201cIt\u2019s for your sister and you know it is. She\u2019s in pain and she needs it. Now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve really taken a shining to her, haven\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s nothing like you, maybe that\u2019s why.\u201d</p><p>He nodded and walked slowly, very slowly, across the room to the desk. \u201cShe\u2019s weak and foolish, that\u2019s her problem. Though perhaps that\u2019s why you like her. You can relate.\u201d</p><p>I breathed in sharply through my nose and willed my heart to calm down. \u201cJust give me the morphine.\u201d</p><p>He reached into a crumpled small paper bag and brought out the syringe and a vial. My eyes widened a bit at the sight.</p><p>\u201cGot enough there?\u201d I asked him snidely.</p><p>He pierced the bottle with the syringe and filled it a quarter of the way up. \u201cI told you that I\u2019d only get the best for her. The rest, well, the rest we might need.\u201d</p><p>He walked over to me, each step with purpose, each step closer to shaking loose his towel. He smiled, all white teeth, canines showing and proudly displayed the syringe and the medicine in his hands.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give you this if you do me a favor.\u201d</p><p>I did not like the sounds of that.</p><p>\u201cJavier, there isn\u2019t time to play games.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is always time to play a game, angel. You\u2019ve been playing them from the moment you were born.\u201d</p><p>He took a step forward again and I backed up until the back of my knees hit the edge of the bed.</p><p>\u201cEven your feelings for Camden are nothing more than a game to you,\u201d he went on. One step closer. \u201cYou want him because you can\u2019t have him. You can\u2019t have him because you disgust him. And once you do, if you get to him using those pretty eyes of yours and that tight-as-hell pussy, you won\u2019t even want him anymore. You\u2019ll toss him aside. Just like you did to me.\u201d</p><p>I had enough of this. I quickly reached for the syringe but he yanked it out of the way and grabbed my wrist, his fingers searing into me like hot knives into butter.</p><p>He jerked me closer to him until my chest was pressed against his, his erection hard against my thigh. \u201cNow about that favor.\u201d He stared at my lips, his eyes full of lust and madness and victory. \u201cKiss me.\u201d</p><p>Was he seriously this sick, to make me kiss him in exchange for the medicine for his own sister?</p><p>\u201cForget it,\u201d I told him. I\u2019d find another way to get it to her. I turned to walk away but he held me in place and brought his face to mine. A wash of softness came over his brow, his mouth turning down, his lids heavy. \u201cAm I that repulsive to you now?\u201d When I didn\u2019t answer, he whispered, \u201cYou know I\u2019m doing all of this for you, my angel. I wouldn\u2019t do this for anyone else, not ever.\u201d He cupped my face with his free hand. \u201cYou could still be the queen of everything.\u201d</p><p>A queen of everything but still a queen with nothing.</p><p>\u201cI have to go check on her,\u201d I said, closing my eyes, wanting to be free of him. I waited tensely, listening to my heart thumping in my ears, the shortness of his breath as he held me there.</p><p>Finally he released me and pressed the vial and syringe into my hand. \u201cTake this to her then. Make yourself feel better.\u201d</p><p>I turned around without looking at him, the medicine damp from the sweat of his hand, and got out of the room. The morning sun seemed glaring now after being with him.</p><p>I made it two steps out the door when the wall beside me exploded into a shower of cement and paint. I dropped flat to the hard ground on instinct, covering my head, looking around me wildly. Suddenly Javier\u2019s window exploded and I could feel bits of wayward glass raining down on me.</p><p>I reached into my boot and pulled out my gun, my eyes darting all over the parking lot. There was nothing unusual, just a few cars and Jose. But across the street was a long fence belonging to a house. If the shooters were hiding behind there, we were sitting ducks.</p><p>\u201cEllie?\u201d Javier called out from his room. My ears were ringing with the sound of the gunshots, my lungs seizing at the close call. The shots had stopped for now but they were just waiting for an easy target.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay!\u201d I shouted back.</p><p>Camden\u2019s door swung open and he suddenly burst out, running fast as hell, gun in his hand, over to a high van that was parked near the entrance and closest to the fence on the other side of the road. He flattened himself against the back of the van and his eyes darted over to me. If I ran, the gunmen would try shooting and reveal their location. I looked over at the door Camden had left open. Could I make it there before their bullets got me?</p><p>Only one way to find out. I nodded at Camden.</p><p>Then I got to my knees and sprinted. Shots fired out in my wake, some of them far above my head which showed that the shooters didn\u2019t have the best accuracy so far. I was just about to duck inside the door when Violetta came stumbling out of our door, looking panicked.</p><p>\u201cGet down!\u201d I screamed at her. I ditched Camden\u2019s room and ran for her instead. I tackled her to the ground just as the window to our room shattered with another blast of gunfire. Even though I smashed up my elbow in the fall and we partially landed on Violetta\u2019s arm, Camden took the opportunity to take out whoever was shooting at us. He popped off a few rounds, splintering the fence across the street, the noise punctuated by a few cries of agony and defeat.</p><p>Violetta moaned beneath my arms, her own pain taking over her. I rolled her over and peered at her face, the tears streaming down it. \u201cI\u2019ve got something for you, it will just take a few seconds, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho the fuck is shooting at us?\u201d she cried out.</p><p>I looked up at Camden who was peering around the van, being extra cautious. From behind us, I could hear another door open.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d It was Javier. His footsteps stopped right behind us.</p><p>I eased myself off of Violetta and Camden came trotting over and helped me get Violetta to her feet. \u201cWe\u2019re okay, thanks to Camden.\u201d I gave him a quick smile. \u201cCan\u2019t see things from far away, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got lucky,\u201d Camden said, but his tone and the darkness in his eyes said it was nothing as frivolous as luck.</p><p>\u201cWell let\u2019s not start thinking he saved the world yet,\u201d Javier said. \u201cWe don\u2019t even know if they\u2019re dead.\u201d He took his gun out from his waistband and snapped back the clip. \u201cBut if they aren\u2019t they will be.\u201d</p><p>He trotted across the parking lot, his shaggy hair blowing behind him, and crossed the street, gun held low. I looked over at the hotel lobby and saw a few people gathered, some on cell phones, perhaps to call the police.</p><p>I looked up at Camden. \u201cWe have to shoot her up and get her out of here.\u201d I held out her good arm and he grasped it around the forearm while I quickly found a vein near the crook of her elbow. \u201cThis will pinch. And then you\u2019ll be flying, okay sweetie?\u201d I tapped the vein and stuck the syringe in, injecting the morphine in one push. She immediately relaxed in my arms, but not too much. Javier had put enough in there to take away the pain but not as much as she had the night before.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you go wait in the car?\u201d I told her, smoothing back her hair.</p><p>\u201cCan I drive it?\u201d she asked lazily.</p><p>I smiled. \u201cNot yet. But you can listen to the radio if it will make you feel better.\u201d I put the car keys in her hands and sent her off.</p><p>I turned to Camden. \u201cI think we have five minutes tops before shit hits the fan.\u201d</p><p>He nodded at the broken windows and blasted walls. \u201cI think it\u2019s already hit the fan.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cTrue but\u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Javier\u2019s scream cut through us. We snapped our heads to look. He was running across the street toward us, screaming and waving his hands frantically. \u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>I looked to Violetta, where he was headed. She had just gotten in the car.</p><p>She adjusted her seat.</p> <p>She started the car.</p><p>Jose made a strange grinding sound.</p><p>My lungs, heart, soul collapsed.</p><p>And Jose exploded.</p><p>One minute I saw Violetta\u2019s dark hair through the back window, Javier running across the street for her, a look of absolute horror on his face, a look I\u2019d never seen before and a look I\u2019d never forget.</p> <p>The next minute, there was a fireball, hotter than hell, larger than life and I was flying backwards, blown into the wall by the fist of heat.</p><p>I slammed into the wall and fell to the ground, heat taking over my body, my brain humming with blood and echoes of the blast. I lay there for a few seconds, trying to figure out what had happened. Where was I? Why was the world on fire?</p><p>Violetta.</p><p>I lifted up my head and saw the flames that licked high into the sky, Jose a burning carcass of memories. Violetta. She\u2019d been inside.</p><p>I had given her the keys.</p><p>She was dead.</p> <p>Burning alive.</p><p>A messy, anguished sob came out of my mouth. Even though the heat was searing my eyeballs, I couldn\u2019t look away from the flaming wreckage, the cries around me muffled, like my ears were plugged with cotton balls.</p><p>I felt hands wrap around my shoulders and pull me up to my feet. A strong arm went around my waist and I was turned away from the inferno and brought into a room.</p><p>My hotel room. It seemed like a cave now with the fire raging outside. Violetta was dead. Jose was gone.</p><p>\u201cEllie?\u201d Camden said softly, running his hands down my face. \u201cFuck, you\u2019re hurt.\u201d</p><p>I looked up at him, seeing him but not seeing him. He gently touched my temple and I saw blood on his fingers. \u201cCome on, we\u2019ll get you cleaned up.\u201d</p><p>Cleaned up? Who cared about being cleaned up? What the fuck just happened?</p><p>\u201cVioletta!\u201d I cried out suddenly, tears rushing to my face. I tried to run back outside but he held me in place.</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said roughly. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing we can do for her.\u201d</p><p>I looked at him with wild eyes and he brought me closer to him. \u201cI gave her the keys.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t have known there was a bomb in the car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJavier!\u201d I cried out. \u201cJavier knew! He was running and yelling and ... oh my god, Camden, what happened to him?\u201d</p><p>His dark brows came together and he bit his lip, his eyes searching me. \u201cEllie ...\u201d</p><p>I shook my head and pushed him out of the way. \u201cNo!\u201d I ran out of the room and back to the scene of the crime.</p><p>People from the hotel were gathered around the blaze, some with fire extinguishers, trying to put it out with futile sprays of foam. I didn\u2019t see Javier anywhere.</p><p>I swallowed the bile that was coming up my throat. Had Javier been swallowed up by the same blast that was currently consuming his sister? Was he there now, a charred skeleton amid the flames?</p><p>I promptly leaned over and threw up on the ground.</p><p>Camden\u2019s hand was on my back in seconds. \u201cCome on, come back inside.\u201d</p><p>I made a pitiful noise, wanting nothing more than to scream, cry, run.</p><p>\u201cPlease, Ellie, you\u2019re hurt.\u201d I felt him reach for my head. I moved out of his grasp getting hit with dizziness instead. I staggered a bit then froze when I saw Dom coming out of the crowd of people, heading toward us, a gun noticeable in his waistband as the breeze lifted back his slick suit jacket.</p><p>We needed to run. But I couldn\u2019t even move.</p><p>Dom stopped right in front of us, a sympathetic smile on his lips. \u201cYou two need to come with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Camden asked, his voice strong and steady.</p><p>Dom glanced at the burning wreckage, at the people who were now stealing glances at us.</p><p>\u201cBecause we have to go,\u201d he said simply. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to be here when the police get here. And the men who did this? They\u2019re still out there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Javier?\u201d I asked him, not quite certain that he wasn\u2019t one of the men who had tried to take our heads off and blew up my beloved car and Javier\u2019s beloved sister. And possibly Javier.</p><p>He looked over my shoulder into the room and said, \u201cJust grab your stuff and go. I\u2019m parked around the corner.\u201d Then he took off toward the bar. I watched until he disappeared around the building.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d Camden asked. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to go with him. We can go out on our own. It could be a death trap in that car.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t even think. I didn\u2019t even care.</p><p>Camden sighed and brought me to him, wrapping his arms around me and holding me tight. I could feel his heart beating against mine. I closed my eyes, feeling waves of darkness trying to swallow me whole. This was all too much and my brain couldn\u2019t even take it in. It was spitting it all out, rejecting reality, leaving me with a numbness I welcomed too much.</p><p>\u201cYou tell me what to do,\u201d I whispered into his chest. \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t remember much after that, maybe it\u2019s because I had a concussion and pieces of Jose still in my hair or maybe because my head was protecting me from the brutality of the truth. It was all like a dream. Camden brought me inside and we gathered up the rest of my stuff, everything that had been in Jose. Then we hurried along the row of rooms toward the bar. I could hear the cries of people behind us, as if we were the bad guys and we were getting away. But no one came after us as we rounded the corner and saw a shiny black Escalade at the curbside, its engine running.</p><p>It was all a dream until I got into the car.</p><p>Este was sitting by the door in the back to make room for me.</p><p>And Javier was sitting in the front seat.</p><p>Alive.</p><p>My heart churned like a cement mixer, a million competing emotions running through me. Relief he was alive. And fear because he wasn\u2019t dead.</p><p>I climbed into the middle seat, still dazed but feeling everything sparking back to life, like I went from black and white back to Technicolor.</p><p>Javier didn\u2019t turn around to acknowledge me. In fact, as Camden closed the door and Dom drove the Escalade down the street, no one said anything. The five of us were silent though apologies were dancing on my tongue. I wanted to tell Javier I was sorry about Violetta. I wanted to tell him it was all my fault. I wanted to beg for forgiveness.</p><p>But I didn\u2019t. Because it wouldn\u2019t change anything. It wouldn\u2019t bring her back. It wouldn\u2019t make anyone feel better. Not even me.</p><p>Camden reached for my hand and held onto it tight. His skin was warm, firm and soft all at once. I raised my eyes to his. He was here with me, a simple fact in an unsimple world.</p><p>We stared at each other for a few beats, my thoughts lost in those baby blues, in the hardness that surrounded them, and the soulfulness deep inside. Violetta\u2019s words from last night swirled around in my head. Her wish for love, to love and to be loved.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t be sure I had the latter. I certainly didn\u2019t deserve it. But I had the former. I loved this man who was sitting next me, who had been by my side, on my side, from the beginning. I had to hold onto that. I had something that Violetta died without \u2013 knowing that someone completely owns your heart. Camden owned my heart and the blood it pumped through me. He owned every atom and inch of my body, every crevice and dark shadow of my soul. From now on, he would possess it freely, easily. I was his. And if I blew up the next day, if I met my death trying to get back Gus and my mother, at least then I could die knowing my heart was put to good use. It wasn\u2019t wasted. And if it wasn\u2019t wasted then perhaps I wasn\u2019t wasted either.</p><p>I squeezed his hand back, silent thanks for his comfort and devotion. Then I carefully leaned my head on his shoulder and tried to forget about the pain that the morning had brought me. The lives it had changed.</p><p>We sped south in a car full of love and death.</p><p>CHAPTER EIGHT</p><p>\u201cHold still,\u201d Camden instructed.</p><p>He had an alcohol soaked cloth poised at the corner of my head, ready to sting the shit out of me. The pain that came with healing.</p><p>We were in a gas station bathroom, the floor sticky with unknown fluids, the walls crawling with winged creepy crawlies that would occasionally make a go for the bare light bulb before falling to the floor. I was sitting up on the sink and Camden was trying to treat my wounds while he had the chance.</p><p>We had driven pretty much nonstop all the way from Aguascalientes until just outside of the border to Guatemala, 12 hours in one stretch. During the drive, Javier hadn\u2019t said a single word, only stared out the window as the landscape of his country rushed past us. Dom and Este did all the talking, telling us the plan for the next few days as we went into the jungle. Apparently we were meeting another \u201cfriend\u201d of theirs in Guatemala City who\u2019d be joining us.</p><p>No one talked about what happened to Violetta or who was shooting at us. I assumed it was Travis and I guess from their silence the assumption was right. There was nothing to say, I suppose, except that his people wanted us dead and they were a lot more clever than I had given them credit for.</p><p>\u201cOw,\u201d I moaned as Camden gently pressed the cloth to my head.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he said, eyes soft as he gazed at me.</p><p>I watched him as he did this, wincing through the pain. He dabbed it on my cheekbone where I had another large gash that hurt if I smiled. Luckily, there wasn\u2019t much to smile about.</p><p>\u201cHow are your eyes?\u201d I asked him.</p><p>He paused, cloth in hand, and peered at me inquisitively. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you see me?\u201d</p><p>He went back to stinging the wounds. \u201cI told you I can see you clearly from up close.\u201d</p><p>I swallowed hard and swung my legs up and down, suddenly very aware that as I sat on the edge of the sink, I was pretty much straddling him. \u201cDo you like what you see?\u201d I asked quietly. My words sat in a fine haze over the room, my chest constricting from the silence.</p><p>His mouth dropped open, lower lip full and inviting, his pink tongue moving in his mouth, trying to make words that would not come.</p><p>\u201cAm I still beautiful to you?\u201d I whispered, feeling my heart slowly leak open. I was raw and wounded and in his hands.</p><p>His face crumpled, such vulnerability in its strength. The cloth dropped out of his hands and into the sink and he sucked in his breath before saying, \u201cEllie Watt, you\u2019re more beautiful than you\u2019ve ever been.\u201d</p><p>And then his lips, his soft, full, warm lips were on mine, sending sparks up my face, to the back of my head, trailing down my back like brushes from angel wings. His mouth was greedy and mine wanted, needed, craved more. He made a fist in the back of my hair and I grabbed onto his, tugging it until he moaned, the intoxicating sound of his lust filling my mouth, my throat, my lungs. I couldn\u2019t get enough, I was afraid I\u2019d never get it again.</p><p>It was wrong, it was wrong, it was wrong to be doing this with him, in here, when the whole world was dying out there, but I didn\u2019t care. I loved him and I needed him more than I ever needed anyone. I loved him and love had to be good in this life full of bad. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He put his lips to my collarbone sucking and biting and making me forget everything, the worries coming off of me like the tank top I quickly pulled over my head and shed to the floor. He cupped my swollen breasts with his hands, his thumbs teasing my nipples until he pulled back the bra and exposed them to the humid air, pinching them with his teeth. I cried out from the pain, the beautiful pain that rocked through my body, making every centimeter of my skin feel absolutely alive. For the first time in a long time, I felt like I was living, breathing, present. Here.</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t stop,\u201d I begged him between groans. \u201cPlease don\u2019t stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaby, I\u2019m just getting started,\u201d he said, voice husky with unadulterated lust. He went for my neck, licking in long smooth strokes that set off nerves all the way down to my clit, racing across my body like shooting stars. My legs spread wider for him, wrapping around his waist, tugging him close to me, desperate for friction.</p><p>He pulled away and quickly pushed my legs together. With a hard tug he undid the zipper of my jeans and I quickly kicked off my hiking boots. He pulled down my jeans and underwear, the sink cold against my ass, as I reached for his belt, fumbling to let him loose, like if I didn\u2019t free his cock fast enough, I\u2019d lose the opportunity forever.</p> <p>When my legs were bare and wide for him, I brought him in closer with my calves, hooked securely around his back. The belt finally came free and his pants dropped to his ankles with a single snap of a button.</p><p>And here we were, naked from the waist down, his cock hard as concrete and silky soft against my opening, his hands gripping my shoulders as if I would try and escape. But there was no escape for me, I was in this deeply and I needed him to be in me just as deep. If he couldn\u2019t feel something for me in his heart the way that I did, then he could feel something in his balls. I would take what I could get, even here, in this dirty gas station bathroom, because I never wanted Camden more, never needed him more, than I did right there.</p><p>\u201cEllie,\u201d he whispered, pressing his hard ridge against me, rubbing ever so slightly. The pressure on my clit made me wetter than water. I felt myself spreading open, eager for him, feeling so fucking empty and hollow until I had him inside of me.</p><p>I grabbed his face and kissed him, my mouth wanting more than he could give me, my tongue coaxing his until they melted into each other, that insatiable thirst that was plaguing me once again, driving me to devour him, consume him.</p><p>He took my lip between his teeth and pulled back on in, biting down in sweet sinful pleasure.</p> <p>\u201cEllie,\u201d he whispered again and I reached down for his cock, stroking it smoothly, every hard, long inch of him. The illicit grunt that came out of his mouth, the way his eyes rolled back in his head, those gorgeous eyes of his, caused my hormones to flare up into overdrive.</p><p>\u201cJust fuck me,\u201d I told him, my mouth sucking on his soft earlobe. \u201cJust fucking love me.\u201d</p><p>He hesitated and pulled back, looking like I slapped him in the face.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d he whispered hoarsely.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d I said, one hand a fist around his cock, my other hand digging my nails into his back. I was wrapped up in layers and layers and he was at my core, at my middle. This was me and I was in his hands and he had me exposed to the bone. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>His eyes raged with lust, then he kissed me so hard, my head slammed back against the mirror on the wall. He took his cock out of my grip and pressed the wet, smooth tip against me. With a single thrust, he entered me, sharp and fast. His size, his wonderful fullness, had me gasping for air as pain rocketed through my limbs, my insides tensing until he pounded me again and again, until he became a part of me and I couldn\u2019t have imagined life without this, life without anyone else. This was the puzzle piece, the part that made my heart stop hurting, my soul stop bleeding. With each thrust of him up to the hilt he filled me with hope. He erased the death. He gave me life, if only for that moment, when we were joined as one, and I was a better version than the girl I was before.</p> <p>It didn\u2019t take me long to come, my fingers pressing hard into his ass as I almost slipped off the cold sink, my head still rocking against the mirror until I was afraid it would break. But it was only me breaking open from the inside, raw and vulnerable and ugly and beautiful all at once. He started moaning, his thrusts slowing down while my body spasmed me to new heights. And as I came, as the world was colors and I saw stars and felt unbreakable, unstoppable, the rush of emotions took over and buried me under them.</p><p>I cried out in pleasure and then I cried out in sorrow. I just plain fucking cried, grabbing him hard and sobbing into his neck, even as the last traces of him were milked into me.</p><p>He tried to regain control of his breath, our bodies sweating, rising and falling against each other, trying to make sense of the world and what had happened. \u201cHey,\u201d he said softly, voice aching with concern. He reached for my face and made me look at him through the tears. \u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>I closed my eyes and the tears spilled over, leaving hot tracks in their wake. I shook my head back and forth, fighting for air, my chest expanding but unable to take in a breath. I could only sob, my face scrunching up as every rotten part of me came out.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d he asked gently. \u201cEllie, please tell me.\u201d</p><p>I sniffed hard, my mouth wet with my sadness, the words so afraid to come out.</p><p>But they did.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Camden. I love you so damn, fucking much and it\u2019s so right and it\u2019s so wrong because people are dying, and we\u2019re almost dying and Gus is out there and my mother and we can\u2019t trust anybody and all I can think about is you. All I can think about is how much I love you and how badly I fucked everything up and I don\u2019t deserve you but I need you.\u201d I made a fist with my hands and pounded it against his chest, hard, my tears flowing. \u201cI fucking need you and I need you to forgive me. I need that more than anything in the world! I need you to make me good.\u201d</p> <p>He swallowed hard, letting me hit him, his fingers strong on my jaw. \u201cEllie. You are good. You don\u2019t need me for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am so sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry too,\u201d he said. \u201cI never wanted it to be this way.\u201d</p><p>To be this way.</p><p>To be this way.</p><p>My heart clenched painfully and I hunched over, fighting for breath.</p><p>\u201cWhat way?\u201d I choked out. \u201cWhat way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe way it is,\u201d he said, brows pinched together. \u201cThe way it will be.\u201d</p><p>There was a knock on the door, causing both of us to snap to attention.</p><p>\u201cWhat is going on in there?\u201d Dom\u2019s voice came through. \u201cCamden, Ellie, we have to go. Now.\u201d He pounded on the door again until Camden yelled, \u201cAll right, we\u2019ll be out in a minute!\u201d</p><p>He stepped away from me, quickly pulling up his pants and fixing his belt before handing me my hiking boots and slipping my jeans back up my legs. His hands lingered momentarily on the cherry blossom tattoo before sliding back up.</p><p>I pulled up the jeans and slipped my boots on before jumping down to the floor, my shoulder leaning against the weight of his body for balance. He hadn\u2019t really done the most thorough job of tending to my wounds, but at least all the action got the car parts and glass out of my hair which now littered the bowl of the sink. I clung onto that bit of humor because that\u2019s all I had. I had hoped, wanted, needed us to be closer, for the sex to bring us together, to let him feel that he had me, all of me, and whatever happened between Javier and I was gone. It was his seed inside me right now. He had me body and soul.</p><p>But then, he was looking at me like he was being torn in half.</p><p>And I felt like I was left with nothing.</p><p>\u201cYou ready?\u201d he asked.</p><p>I wiped underneath my eyes and asked, \u201cDo I look like a mess?\u201d</p><p>He smiled, his eyes sad. \u201cYou\u2019re allowed to look like a mess, Ellie.\u201d</p><p>I guess he was right about that. I brushed my hair behind my ears and shrugged.</p><p>\u201cThen a mess I shall be.\u201d</p><p>We left the dingy washroom and walked across to the car. It was night now, hot and dark with a sky filled with cicadas and stars. Dom and Este already appeared to be inside the Escalade and Javier was left leaning against his passenger-side door, puffing on a cigar, his eyes following our every move.</p><p>I stiffened for a moment, wondering what Javier would say or think. Then I realized it didn\u2019t really matter anymore. My heart broke for him, for the loss of his sister, but I refused to let it break because of Camden.</p><p>He watched us in the silence, still not having said a word to us since the explosion. Camden didn\u2019t even look at him, perhaps he couldn\u2019t. I thought maybe he would have looked smug about what had happened, about what we so obviously had done in that bathroom, but he didn\u2019t. He only kept his eyes forward and got in the car.</p><p>I paused by the door, watching Javier exhale a cloud of smoke.</p><p>He looked at me once, just briefly, and though I couldn\u2019t see clearly through the haze, I picked up on the pain in his eyes. Camden was right. I was mess.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I said, wiping my hands anxiously on my jeans. \u201cAbout Violetta.\u201d</p><p>He stared at me and it was almost as if I could see whatever sick ties he once had to me were snapping one by one. The freedom was exhilarating. The uncertainty was terrifying.</p><p>\u201cGet in,\u201d he said, his voice rough as sandpaper.</p><p>I nodded, taking what I could get, and got in the car after Camden.</p><p>We drove through the night and after we passed through the border into Guatemala, our passports all checked and cleared, I fell asleep. I didn\u2019t wake up until the dawn was breaking and the Escalade was pulling into the city.</p><p>We came to a stop outside of a small white house with a terracotta tiled roof and waited for a few moments.</p><p>\u201cAny way we can stretch our legs, maybe get a coffee?\u201d Camden asked.</p><p>Este was in the driver\u2019s seat now with Dom snoring beside me, completely out. He eyed Camden in the mirror. \u201cIn a bit. We don\u2019t want to stay a second longer in this city than we have to.\u201d</p><p>Camden nodded with a sigh and sat back in his seat. Javier unbuckled his seat belt and stepped out of the car, walking up to the front door of the house. Before he had a chance to knock he was met with an extremely buff man in a wife-beater with a shaved head and ripped camo pants. He was white, with piercing blue eyes I could see all the way from where I was.</p><p>\u201cWho is that?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cHis name is Derek,\u201d Este said. \u201cHe\u2019s American.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can see that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was in the Afhganistan war. Married a Mexican woman. She died on the streets, caught in the gunfire of two cartels. He decided to stay behind and clean shit up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d I said slowly.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s good at getting in and getting out,\u201d Este went on. \u201cHe\u2019s fearless and ruthless. Souless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike Javier,\u201d I found myself saying. My eyes darted to Este, catching my mistake but he only smiled.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s got training that none of us have. And as long as you pay him well, he\u2019s loyal to the bone. If anyone can get your people back, it\u2019s Derek.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Derek and Javier came over to the back of the Escalade, Derek with only a small backpack. Javier opened the trunk and Derek quickly slid inside.</p><p>I smiled at him but he didn\u2019t smile back. Instead, he nodded curtly and then lay down, still as death, staring up at the ceiling.</p><p>I exchanged a nervous look with Camden. Our little team was growing bigger, each new person adding an uncertainty that wasn\u2019t there before. But worrying wouldn\u2019t do me any good. This was out of my hands. If I wanted to get Gus and my mother back, we had to go through with it. I laid myself bare last night \u2013 no use being guarded now.</p><p>We drove for a bit until the city was far behind us along with its overgrown trees and layer of smog. Este finally stopped at a small diner where we all got coffees and churros to go. It was stinking hot out, waves of heat rising from the road, the sun bearing down relentlessly.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re closer to the equator now,\u201d Este had said, watching as I wiped the sweat off my brow as we stood around the car, waiting for Dom to get out of the restroom. \u201cIt will be cooler in the jungle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo how is this going to work exactly?\u201d Camden asked, shoving the last remaining bit of the churro in his mouth.</p><p>Este looked to Javier who was on his cell phone, talking to someone in Spanish. Javier ignored him and turned around, slowly walking to the other side of the car. Este shrugged at Camden. \u201cWell I have the coordinates on my iPad, picking up from Satellite feed, it will take us straight there.\u201d</p><p>\u201ciPad?\u201d Camden asked, almost laughing.</p><p>Este gave him a look. \u201cWhy mess with a good thing? You\u2019d be amazed at the apps that the cartels have floating among them. You can\u2019t buy them on iTunes but they can save your life. And your money. I\u2019ve made a few myself. The one we\u2019ll be using, we can almost watch our own selves going through the forest in real time.\u201d</p> <p>Este went on about the mission, how the six of us would go in until a certain point and then split up. There were the people who would need to go in silently, and the ones who would go in blazing. They weren\u2019t quite decided yet on who would go where. I guess that remained to be seen.</p><p>While he chatted to Camden some more, Derek listening and staying silent, I decided to go and look for Javier.</p><p>He had just hung up the phone and put it in his pocket, facing away from me. I walked over to him, carefully, like he could attack at any minute. He seemed wounded and like any animal, ready to defend himself against predators. In this case, the predator was me.</p><p>\u201cJavier,\u201d I said softly.</p><p>He turned slowly and I stopped where I was, dust flying up from my boots and settling in the air around us like spilled flour. His mouth was set in a hard line and his eyes were even harder like that, glinting like golden stones. He appraised me, taking me in, not sure what to do or say or feel. I could tell half of him wanted to hate me, hit me, make me bleed. And the other half, well that was the sadness I could see masked far beneath. I knew him well enough to know when he was burying shit deep inside.</p><p>I reached out for him, slowly putting my hand on his shoulder. He didn\u2019t flinch but he eyed my hand like I carried some disease. I left it there for a second, hoping the weight of it would translate the weight in my heart, before I took it away.</p> <p>I stuck both my hands in my back pockets and looked at the ground. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>He breathed in sharply through his nose, his eyes cutting into me with curiosity. \u201cAbout?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVioletta.\u201d Even saying her name hurt.</p><p>He looked away for a moment and tilted his head to the side. \u201cIt has happened. It is done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI gave her the car keys,\u201d I said, fighting the stiffness in my throat. The terrible guilt that festered inside me, the guilt that wouldn\u2019t go away.</p><p>He nodded once and quick. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t your fault. I didn\u2019t realize soon enough what was going on. I played it too safe.\u201d He exhaled and checked the time on his phone. \u201cNo point dwelling on it though. If she had left right away back in Mexico City, none of this would have happened. She chose to get involved. She made her choices when she friended the Zetas.\u201d</p><p>He was making it sound so simple. But, like Violetta said, maybe there was no point in making things complicated if they didn\u2019t need to be.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s dead,\u201d he said with finality. \u201cThat\u2019s the cost of doing business sometimes.\u201d</p> <p>And just like that, whatever vulnerability, whatever hurt and pain I thought I had seen beneath the surface, was all gone. Wiped clean. All that was left was Javier Bernal a drug lord with only one thing on his mind \u2013 his own rise to the top. He was steel and hard lines and ice in the middle of the tropics. He was the only thing that would never melt, no matter what pressure was applied to him. He was a human, a machine, a man who I knew had lost his soul forever. He lost it somewhere far away and it was no longer my job to get it back for him. Maybe it never was my job.</p><p>I swallowed hard and said, \u201cWell, just so you know. I liked her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that was your problem,\u201d he said, giving me a dry smile. \u201cIf you hadn\u2019t gotten close to her, you wouldn\u2019t care so much. Let that be a lesson to you, Ellie. Don\u2019t get close to the people you know will die. Don\u2019t get close to anyone. We\u2019ll all die at some point.\u201d</p><p>Dom appeared at the front of the car, slamming back a coffee and climbing into the driver\u2019s seat. He eyed us over his aviators. \u201cTime to go.\u201d</p><p>Javier left me standing there, slightly dumbfounded, going around to the passenger side of the car. I shook my head when Dom slammed his door shut and I got in the back.</p><p>It turns out we were close to the Honduran border, which proved to be an easy checkpoint. I don\u2019t know what the guards would have done if they had searched the car and found stacks of weapons in the back with Derek, but from the giant wad of cash I saw Dom hand them, I had a feeling it wouldn\u2019t have mattered. Money went further than honor here and we certainly paid our way.</p><p>Once in the country, it was another five hours of driving through piss-poor towns, crumbling roads and rampant wildlife like monkeys who liked to dart from the overhanging canopies, until we finally reached Catacamas for our last dinner in civilization. Of course knowing how wanted we all were, we sent Derek out to get questionable food from a street vendor and we all ate in the car, without the air conditioning on.</p><p>I hadn\u2019t had a chance to talk to Camden yet and every time we were alone for a few moments, he would suddenly busy himself with questions for Este. I don\u2019t know if he just wanted to be on top of everything and be a man with a plan or if he was avoiding me. Part of me was feeling ashamed for opening myself to him last night but the other part was glad I did it. It was out on the table. He knew how I felt and that\u2019s all I could do. I was a woman born of lies, but here I was being honest even when it hurt me the most.</p><p>When we were all done, Dom took us out of the city and toward a tiny village that consisted of a post office, a gas station and a feed store. It was sleepy, quaint, and the place we were to ditch the Escalade. He pulled the car into an empty and abandoned barn and turned off the engine.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re ready for this, yes?\u201d Este asked me as we climbed out of the car.</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cNo way in hell will I ever be ready for this.\u201d</p><p>We all gathered around the open trunk as Derek and Dom started distributing stuff. They handed me a backpack which I had already crammed with some of my belongings, another gun, a change of clothes. Then they handed out miniscule walkie talkies that resembled a Bluetooth earpiece to each of us and made sure that I was carrying the first aid kit.</p><p>Dom slapped the car affectionately and I felt a funny little pang in my gut for the loss of Jose. I know it was just a car and it was Violetta who died, but Jose had been with me for the last six years. He\u2019d almost become a friend when I didn\u2019t have any.</p><p>\u201cIf we see this car again,\u201d Dom said, \u201cyou\u2019ll know we\u2019ve done good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat said,\u201d Javier added, \u201cif you do get back here without anyone else, my advice is to take the car and go. It\u2019s every man for himself out there, I hope you know that. You don\u2019t win wars by saving each other. You only get killed that way.\u201d</p><p>Well that wasn\u2019t exactly the encouragement we needed before we started hiking off into the jungle on a rescue mission. I looked across at Camden, dust motes dancing in the barn light that shone between us. He looked right back. We were the only people here who would risk life and limb for each other.</p><p>I was forever on his team.</p><p>\u201cJavier has never been one for speeches,\u201d Este said, shaking his head in amusement. \u201cBut all I\u2019ll say is, we can get in and get out. We can make this happen. Travis Raines is ours. What he has is ours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean Gus,\u201d I spoke up quickly.</p><p>Javier grinned. \u201cGus, sure. And the cartel.\u201d</p><p>I frowned, feeling a rush of nerves down my back. \u201cYou said you were doing this for me.\u201d</p><p>He let out a laugh to which only Este joined in.</p><p>\u201cDom is doing this for you,\u201d Javier said, gesturing to him with his gun. \u201cAnd, if you\u2019re lucky, Camden is doing this for you. Derek just wants his paycheck, the gringo doesn\u2019t care who does what, fucks what, gets what. But me, Ellie, angel, dearest, I\u2019m going in and I\u2019m taking over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis wasn\u2019t supposed to be a coup,\u201d I said.</p><p>Suddenly Javier was in my face, the veins pulsing in his head, spittle flying out of his mouth as he screamed at me, \u201cAnd they weren\u2019t supposed to kill my sister!\u201d</p><p>Camden was at my side in a second, ready to push Javier back but the barn filled with the sound of three guns being drawn and I didn\u2019t have to look around to know that Dom, Este and Derek all had guns trained on Camden.</p><p>The madness in Javier\u2019s eyes was quickly reined in and he stepped back. He wiped his mouth and smiled. \u201cAs you can see, Travis has hit yet another nerve. You\u2019ll get your Gus back, your mother back, whatever you want and whatever is left is mine. And if you step in my way, I won\u2019t hesitate to kill you. Both of you.\u201d He turned around and clapped his hands together, the sound giving me a jolt. \u201cNow, let\u2019s head off into the jungle, shall we?\u201d</p><p>Camden and I stayed behind for a moment while they all walked out of the barn and into the last remaining sunlight. He grabbed my hand and squeezed it and I was warmed where my insides had turned cold.</p><p>\u201cJust focus on Gus,\u201d Camden said.</p><p>I nodded. Squeezed his hand back. And followed the drug lords out into the light.</p><p>CHAPTER NINE</p><p>The journey started off easy enough. The six of us, backpacks in tow, walked down lonely, dusty streets that wound their way through fallow fields and past shanty houses. Eventually the last signs of humanity gave way to the jungles of the Sierra de Agalta National Park, an imposing wall of vegetation and darkness.</p><p>We paused right before the foliage swallowed us, hesitating before the belly of the beast.</p><p>I looked up at the sky, now bruised purple from the twilight. \u201cAre you sure we shouldn\u2019t camp out here for now?\u201d I said, my arm sweeping out the valley below us. \u201cYou know, while there\u2019s still light and shit.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI never thought you\u2019d be afraid of a little jungle,\u201d Javier said, though his tone was flat. \u201cWe\u2019re moving through the night.\u201d He brought out a flashlight from his pocket and flicked it on. He looked at Este who had his iPad raised up to his eyes. \u201cHow\u2019s your battery on that thing?\u201d</p><p>Este smiled. \u201cIt\u2019ll last throughout the night until I can get the sun to charge it tomorrow. I have my compass just in case anything goes wrong. We\u2019re good.\u201d</p><p>Javier slid a formidable machete out of his backpack and toyed with his grip on the handle. \u201cVery well. I\u2019ll clear our path when needed. You just tell me where to go.\u201d</p><p>Este nodded. \u201cShouldn\u2019t be a problem at this level. Just head straight for a few kilometers. I\u2019ll correct us along the way.\u201d</p> <p>Oh, just for a few kilometers. I looked up at Camden. He was looking uneasy, his jaw tense, his lips rubbing against each other, calculating something. Possibly our demise.</p><p>Javier disappeared into the trees until I could only see his flashlight and the glow from Este\u2019s iPad. Dom followed behind them. I expected Derek to go next but he only nudged Camden with the butt of his rifle that he always had out, nodding ahead.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m covering you,\u201d he said, his voice raspy like he\u2019d blown out his vocal chords at some point in his life. His eyes were dead, emotionless, and even though I thought I\u2019d feel some sort of camaraderie for the man since he was American and young, there was nothing. This man felt nothing for anyone, especially not Camden and I. We weren\u2019t the ones paying him. If anything, he was here to watch us, to keep us in line.</p><p>Camden hesitated, wrestling with the silence, before he grunted and walked ahead of me, following Dom. I guess he didn\u2019t like the idea of having Derek behind us. It made us feel more like we were prisoners, not cohorts.</p><p>Even with flashlights in our hands, the jungle was a terrifying place. We were lucky that the trees weren\u2019t too close together and the ground underneath was dry, but the occasional root would still try and fuck you up, a branch sometimes came down too low and got you in the forehead. Not to mention the countless spiderwebs I could feel trailing past my arms. I wasn\u2019t a wuss over many things but it had me walking right up behind Camden, cowering behind his tall and wide frame to shield me from the insects that I could only imagine were in a jungle like this.</p> <p>We walked and walked and walked until I started feeling delirious from the dizzying darkness, that claustrophobia of never knowing what was out there. You could hear the occasional slice of Javier\u2019s machete as he cut through something and Dom and Este were talking in Spanish. We were all getting farther and farther apart, especially Camden and I as we grew tired, our legs slowing.</p><p>\u201cWant me to carry you?\u201d Camden asked me. Though the idea of me getting a piggyback ride made me smile, I told him I was okay. I was just getting sleepy, that was the problem. An energy drink would have gone a long way.</p><p>I decided to pester Derek with questions instead, to keep my mind engaged.</p><p>I looked behind him, seeing only his flashlight and asked, \u201cSo, Derek. Where did you grow up?\u201d</p><p>You know, like we were chatting at a caf\u00e9 or something.</p><p>He didn\u2019t say anything at first. I could only hear the crunch of dirt and leaves below our feet. Then he cleared his throat and in that raw voice of his, said, \u201cMinnesota. Small town.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou must have been a hockey fan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said with surprise. \u201cThough who isn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re built like you play hockey,\u201d I commented, hoping my compliments would get him to relax a little.</p><p>\u201cBuilt to fuck people up,\u201d he answered.</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s pretty much the same thing, isn\u2019t it?\u201d I made sure he could hear the smile in my voice. It didn\u2019t work.</p><p>\u201cHockey is child\u2019s play,\u201d he said sternly.</p><p>I made a small noise of agreement, not sure what else to say.</p><p>We trudged along in the dark, in the silence punctuated by wild animal calls. Shivers stroked along the ridges of my spine.</p> <p>Then, Derek said, \u201cTell me about Gus. The man you mentioned.\u201d</p><p>I wasn\u2019t sure why he needed the information. Maybe it would help him pick better tactics going in. Maybe he felt bad and was trying to make conversation. But I needed to talk about Gus. To talk about him was to keep him alive, keep him as my goal. The further we got into the depths of the night, the more the goal seemed to be pointless. I couldn\u2019t let that happen.</p><p>\u201cGus is like ... a father to me.\u201d The realization that my own father had died slammed into my gut, making my words that much more meaningful. With my own father dead, Gus really was the only family I had left. \u201cHe was friends with my parents for a long time, he\u2019d always been around. He was like ... one of the few constants in my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did he do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe worked for the LAPD as an officer. Retired early. Maybe he was discharged, he doesn\u2019t really talk about it. He started providing false identities to people who needed it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeople like you. Con artists.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. How did you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve read all your files.\u201d</p><p>I nearly stopped in my tracks and Derek\u2019s arm swung into my back. I stumbled but kept walking, flabbergasted and horrified.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve read our files?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven mine?\u201d Camden asked from in front of me.</p><p>\u201cEveryone\u2019s,\u201d Derek repeated. \u201cCartels are thorough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why do you want to know about Gus if you already know this stuff?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s good to hear it from you. I need to know how involved you are and what you are willing to do when things get bad.\u201d</p><p>My throat tickled.</p><p>He went on, \u201cWill you risk your life for Gus?\u201d</p><p>I hadn\u2019t seen Gus for years. But he\u2019d been there for me when no one else was. And he\u2019d come all the way with Camden to save me, to bring me home. He gave his life for mine by doing that. There\u2019s no way I wouldn\u2019t do the same for him.</p><p>\u201cThere are very few people in this world who will go out of their way to save someone else,\u201d I told him. \u201cGus was one of those people. Camden is the other. I\u2019d do anything for both of them.\u201d</p><p>I felt Camden hesitate as he walked, his head turning to look at me. I was grateful for the darkness, that he couldn\u2019t see my face or the heat on my cheeks. Still, after what I\u2019d said yesterday, this was nothing.</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d Derek said. \u201cAnd your mother? Who may or may not be considered a hostage at this point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you do anything for her? Would you risk your life to save hers?\u201d</p><p>I wish the first thought that entered my head was yes. I wish I didn\u2019t have to think about it, to weigh it, to wrestle with it. Because I honestly didn\u2019t know. Would I give up my mother to save Camden and Gus? Yes. I would. I was a horrible daughter, I know that, just to even think it, but it was the truth. Would I save my mother if it meant I\u2019d die in the process? That ... I didn\u2019t know. I just didn\u2019t.</p><p>I hated how that made me feel.</p><p>Like I had no humanity left. That I wasn\u2019t as selfless as I tried to be.</p><p>When it came to me or her, I had no idea how that would play out.</p><p>I swallowed the lump in my throat. \u201cI guess I\u2019ll have to find out.\u201d I licked my lips and felt the need to explain. \u201cMy mother and I weren\u2019t very close, she\u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cI read her files,\u201d Derek said. \u201cI know the story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d I said, wrapping hands around the straps on my backpack, trying to ease the pressure off my shoulders.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you need to know all of this again?\u201d Camden asked, a thread of tension in his voice.</p><p>\u201cBecause I never enter anything until I know everything about the people involved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you must know everything about Travis,\u201d I said as I nearly stumbled over a rock.</p><p>Camden\u2019s arm shot out and steadied me.</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d said Derek.</p><p>\u201cEnough to help Javier take over his cartel?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cI guess we\u2019ll have to find out,\u201d was his answer. \u201cJavier is all about expansion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard my name back there,\u201d Javier voice rang through the darkness, rattling me to the bone. \u201cHow about you three pick up the pace a little. Derek, I\u2019m not paying your gringo ass to have conversations and plod along like a bunch of burros. This is Mexico, not Afghanistan, you should know that.\u201d</p><p>Derek sucked in his breath sharply but said nothing. I could feel the tension rolling off of him like waves of heat at my back. Apparently Javier got under his skin as well.</p><p>Derek stuck the butt of his gun into my lower back, this time on purpose. \u201cBetter get a move on.\u201d</p><p>We marched on.</p><p>Much as you\u2019d imagine, the Honduran jungle is a brutal place to try and get a good night\u2019s rest. We stopped on a plateau of sorts where the trees opened up a bit and the ground was more level. None of us had packed for a camping session and Javier and his men were treating the outing like sleep was a luxury for the benefit of Camden and I. All we had were a few tarps that the men had laid out on the uneven ground and that was it.</p><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t we be worried about things coming to kill us in the night?\u201d I asked them as we stood around the makeshift sleeping area that was nestled between three trees. Their bark glistened eerily under the glow of my flashlight.</p><p>\u201cAre you talking about Travis or something else?\u201d Este asked as he settled onto the ground, his scarred face lit up by his ever-present iPad.</p><p>\u201cWell, now I\u2019m talking about both,\u201d I said.</p><p>He laughed. \u201cI\u2019ve been watching him through satellite from time to time. His men don\u2019t come out this far. In fact they rarely patrol the area outside of the compound but now, well, if he thinks you\u2019re coming, that might be a different case. Still, we\u2019re good. As long as we stay low, don\u2019t light any fires and refrain from shooting anything,\u201d he gave a pointed glance at Derek, \u201cwe should be bueno, hey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd aside from Travis?\u201d</p><p>Este exchanged a look with Dom, who tugged at his shirt collar. \u201cThere are a few poisonous snakes, spiders ... frogs,\u201d he said slowly. \u201cThe worst of all are the bullet ants \u2013 most powerful sting in the world. Rumor has it that Travis has been using them now as ways of torture. Seems acid no longer cuts it for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFigures,\u201d Javier muttered under his breath as he sat up against a tree. He gave Camden and I a funny look. \u201cWell are you two going to try and get some sleep or stand there like a bunch of monkeys?\u201d</p><p>Fuck you, I thought. But if I said it, I knew what he would say in response and I did not want to go there, not after what had happened between Camden and I.</p><p>God, what I would do to get him alone again. The things I wanted to say. Maybe without crying like a fool this time.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d Camden said, gently grabbing my wrist for a moment before walking over to the other tree, the one furthest from Javier. He sat down, his back to it, and motioned for me to come sit between his legs. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I could feel Javier\u2019s eyes on me as I walked across the tarp and sat down, Camden\u2019s knees on either side of me. He wrapped his arm around my chest and pulled me close to him, the small of my back pressed against his crotch, the back of my head against his chest, hot, sweaty, breathing steadily. All man, all this very protective man. The warmth and strength of his arms encasing made me feel like I was being wrapped in a cocoon, a security blanket for the night.</p><p>\u201cGood night,\u201d he whispered softly into my ear, his lips brushing against my lobe.</p><p>I squeezed his forearm in response, so grateful for him, so damn grateful.</p><p>\u201cSleep well, lovebirds,\u201d Javier said, his cynical voice echoing into the night.</p> <p>I woke up to my arm being tickled.</p><p>I opened my eyes and in the grey dimness of the morning light, saw a giant black spider crawling slowly up my arm. I immediately cried out and jumped back, brushing the spider off of me, feeling waves of revulsion and a million little spider legs cover me from head to toe, my body turning it into something more than it was. Like a panic attack, the feeling was impossible to stop and I shook my body vigorously, swatting at nothing.</p><p>It was only then that I realized I was completely alone.</p><p>The tarps were all gone. Everyone was gone.</p><p>Even Camden.</p> <p>Holy fuck.</p><p>The jungle started spinning around me and I saw nothing but madness in the never-ending trees, faces made out of foliage, darkness in the limbs.</p><p>What the hell happened?</p><p>\u201cCamden?\u201d I cried out. \u201cCamden!\u201d</p><p>No, no, no. He couldn\u2019t have left me alone.</p><p>I started running around where we had slept until I found my backpack, the contents strewn across the leaf-covered forest floor. Sweat poured down my face, stinging my eyes, as I knelt down and frantically sorted through everything. My other gun was still there, my fake IDs, my passports, everything I didn\u2019t want to leave behind in the Escalade. Whoever raided my stuff had left me everything. Why?</p> <p>I needed to think. I screamed for Camden again and again, then tried everyone else\u2019s names. I screamed until my throat was sore and I realized that I needed to shut up. If something had happened to everyone, if I was let go or missed for some reason, I was only making things worse, only calling attention to myself.</p><p>I branched out in a small radius from our sleeping area, going around the trees and then around the next ring of trees, always keeping my backpack, which I had placed in the middle of the trees, in my sight. Eventually, a yard or two out, I found the tarp. Shredded into bits. Blood on it.</p><p>Shit, oh fucking shit.</p><p>I dropped to my knees, feeling absolutely powerless. I was alone in the middle of the Honduran jungle, halfway between nowhere and Travis\u2019s compound. I had nobody. Something had happened to them and more than that, Camden, my beautiful Camden, was gone. The last thing I remembered was his arms around me as I fell asleep. How could I have gone from that to this?</p><p>I wanted to cry. I wanted to crawl up against the hollow of a tree and close my eyes and let the animals take me away into the night. After so much, after so long, I wanted to give up.</p><p>But Gus was still out there. My mother too. There were people facing a much worse fate than this. I was able. I was willing. I would get them.</p><p>I took in a deep breath and dropped the bloody tarp from my hands and walked over to my backpack. I took a swig of water from the Camelback that was inside, shoved a tasteless portion of an energy bar in my mouth, then put the pack on my shoulders. I brought out the compass that Este had given everyone and started walking in the direction that we were originally headed. I wasn\u2019t the best at reading trails but I would do the best I could, to find out where they went and if they were going to the place I both hoped and feared they were.</p><p>I made it about three minutes before I heard a bunch of macaw parrots squawk above me and fly across the canopy. Then the jungle went eerily silent.</p> <p>Soon, I was running before I even knew what was happening.</p><p>I kept going, leaping over tree roots, maneuvering around rocks, keeping my legs and arms pumping as fast as I could. Breathe in, breathe out, keep going.</p><p>I ran until I collided into what I thought was a tree.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t.</p><p>Hands dug into my upper arms.</p><p>I screamed.</p><p>\u201cEllie!\u201d Camden exclaimed.</p><p>I stopped trying to fight him, to get away and looked up at the man who held me there, in the middle of the forest floor. It was Camden. His head was bleeding from a gash in the middle of his forehead, running red into his eyes, but it was him.</p><p>\u201cOh thank god!\u201d I cried out and immediately wrapped my arms around his middle, holding him to me. \u201cCamden, Camden, what happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he said. I could feel him shake his head against me. He held me for a minute, our breath slowing down together until we were breathing as one. Then he pulled away, holding me at arm\u2019s length and peered at me. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine!\u201d I cried out. \u201cExcept for waking up alone and thinking you were dead! I found the tarp, it\u2019s all ripped and there\u2019s blood, Camden, oh what the fuck happened? Why was I left behind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he said, his forehead scrunching, which then brought out a wince of pain from him. \u201cI don\u2019t know what ... they came in the morning. Maybe an hour ago? It wasn\u2019t light out yet but birds, birds were singing. I heard someone yell something. You were sleeping ... I got up and I could see these men walking around but without my glasses and in the dark I couldn\u2019t make them out. Next thing I know I was hit over the head with something and dragged into the jungle. I wasn\u2019t unconscious but I couldn\u2019t do anything. I couldn\u2019t move. I don\u2019t know if I was drugged or what. Then, they started yelling at each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you recognize the voices?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think so. I thought I heard Derek. He was pleading something, arguing. In Spanish. Like he was begging for his life. Or my life. I don\u2019t know. Then they dropped me and I guess I passed out until I heard your voice.\u201d He put his hand to my cheek and rubbed his thumb along my cheekbone.</p><p>\u201cWhat do we do now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat else can we do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t even know where Gus is.\u201d</p><p>He stepped back and lightly touched his fingers to the gash on his forehead, wincing at the touch. He pulled his hand away and admired the shiny smear of blood. \u201cWe have the compasses that Este gave us. Last night, as we were falling asleep, as I pretended to be asleep, I heard Esteban tell Javier that it was less than a day\u2019s walk from where we camped. That it was roughly northeast where we needed to go and that we would know it once we started seeing signs warning about poachers. Apparently Travis\u2019s compound is in the middle of a reserve. Course you wouldn\u2019t know it because I assume he bribes the hell out of the government. Fucking fingers in every fucking pie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo we just go for it then?\u201d I asked.</p><p>He nodded sharply. \u201cI think we have to. I don\u2019t know which way we came in but I know which way we\u2019re going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if Javier ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs dead?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cWorse. If he\u2019s out there. If this is a set up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t put it past him, would you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said though it hurt to say it. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>His lips twitched up into a smile. \u201cGood.\u201d He brought his compass out. \u201cI don\u2019t have any guns. They took them.\u201d</p><p>I took mine out of my boot and then brought the extra one out of the backpack and handed it to him, placing its solid and deadly weight in his palm. \u201cNow we both have one.\u201d</p><p>His fingers curled over it and he slid back the clip to check it like an old pro. I had to admit, as wrong as it was, there was something so god damn sexy about seeing Camden handle a gun, the shiny metal against his big arms and wide chest, muscle against muscle. With the blood smeared on his face, dripping down onto the tats that teased at his neck, he was 100% man. I just wished he was 100% mine.</p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d he asked.</p><p>I adjusted my pack, brought out my compass and said, \u201clet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER TEN</p><p>Roughly northeast wasn\u2019t exactly the most detailed directions to go by. Our compasses worked fine but as Camden and I traversed the depths of the jungle, sticking to a straight line wasn\u2019t as easy as we had hoped. The elevation was proving to be more difficult the further along we went, mother nature putting rocky outcrops, fallen trees and ravines in our path. We were both tired, sweaty and irritable and I was letting my fear get the better of me. The fear of who might be lying out there in the dense foliage, watching me, springing a trap. The fear that Gus and my mother were already dead and that this was all for nothing. The fear that the man who was walking in front of me might keep walking one day and never look back.</p><p>\u201cSeen anything yet?\u201d he asked, glancing at me over his broad shoulders.</p><p>\u201cNo, nothing,\u201d I told him. The whole time I\u2019d been looking for some sort of sign that the men had come through here but my tracking skills weren\u2019t up to snuff in a place like this. It was too wild and unpredictable, much like the men we were looking for.</p><p>At that, thunder rumbled ominously. We both paused and looked up. Through the tall tops of the overgrown trees dark clouds had moved in, blocking the sun. It felt like we were being closed in. The air around us shifted and changed and when we started walking again it wasn\u2019t long until I was completely coated in a new layer of sweat.</p><p>\u201cDo you think this whole thing was a set up?\u201d Camden asked me after a few moments. He was breathing heavier now, the rising elevation and intense humidity breaking him down as well.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how it could be,\u201d I said honestly. My lungs were burning, my feet aching in my boots. I stopped wiping the sweat off my face a long time ago. \u201cWhat would be the point of bringing us out here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe we\u2019re supposed to be a diversion. Maybe Javier is setting you up to distract them while he swoops in and takes over. Maybe that\u2019s why you were left behind.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head, droplets of sweat flying. \u201cI don\u2019t think so. Why were you left?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a diversion too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut if we\u2019re a diversion, then it means we are being set up to fail. They\u2019d want Travis to take us ... worse, kill us. Javier wouldn\u2019t do that.\u201d</p><p>He stopped and turned to look at me. \u201cYou just said that you wouldn\u2019t put it past him to set you up.\u201d His voice was ragged and unmistakable anger burned deep in his eyes.</p><p>I threw up my hands and sighed. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know what to think. I ...\u201d I remembered what Violetta had said about Javier throwing me under a bus if he had to. I swallowed hard. \u201cI think he\u2019d use me, use us, to get what he wants. But I don\u2019t think he\u2019d ever put my life in danger.\u201d</p><p>He raised his brows then laughed wickedly, looking up at the sky. \u201cWow. You have got to be kidding me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I asked, my heart began to thud loudly in my ears.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Ellie, from the start he has been pulling all the puppet strings and you\u2019ve been pulled willingly. You say he wouldn\u2019t put you in any danger but he sent you to Travis\u2019s house to kill him. He made you cozy up to the sick bastard. If that\u2019s not putting you at risk, I don\u2019t know what is. I would never do that to you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAnd then he saved us. He also saved you again. On the roof. He didn\u2019t have to do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t have to save a human being\u2019s life? Who would?\u201d he scoffed.</p><p>\u201cWhy are we even arguing about this?\u201d I said. My pack was feeling too heavy so I put it on the ground. I hated fighting with him though I knew where it was all coming from. There was a lot of truth in Camden\u2019s words and still a lot of resentment. Toward me.</p><p>\u201cBecause ...\u201d He sighed and turned away. \u201cBecause I can\u2019t help it. I can\u2019t stop thinking about ... what we did.\u201d</p> <p>My lungs were definitely working overtime now, my heart feeling as if it were being squeezed by icy fingers. I didn\u2019t like where this was going. Why couldn\u2019t we get over this? Why couldn\u2019t my heart stay intact for a fucking minute?</p><p>\u201cWhat we did?\u201d I asked carefully. \u201cYou mean when I fucked you in the bathroom? Or was it what I said?\u201d</p><p>He gave me a dirty look. \u201cWas that what it was to you? Just a fuck?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my god,\u201d I exclaimed. \u201cWhat is wrong with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with me?\u201d he repeated. His smiled coldly. \u201cExcuse me if I have problems taking your words at face value.\u201d</p> <p>That fucking hurt. No, that fucking killed me, knife to heart.</p><p>Another hit of thunder slammed through the sky and in seconds the clouds broke open. Heavy rain pounded down on us, soaking us in seconds. The forest roared with the sound of raindrops hitting the leaves. Just perfect.</p><p>I didn\u2019t even know what to say to that. My mouth fumbled for words, the rain streaming down my face. If I started crying he wouldn\u2019t be able to tell the difference.</p><p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t you just forgive me?\u201d I pleaded. \u201cI\u2019m not lying, Camden. I\u2019m being more honest than I\u2019ve ever been.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow could you sleep with him so easily and then do the same to me?\u201d</p><p>I put my face in my hands, trying to contain myself. I took in a shaky breath and looked at him. He was barely visible through the sheets of rain.</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t take back what I did,\u201d I told him, my voice raw, threatening to crack. \u201cI have my reasons and you know what they are. I can only control what I do from now on in. I slept with you because I love you. I told you the truth in that bathroom. You can decide to forgive me or not, but it\u2019s not my problem anymore if you don\u2019t. I gave you my heart. You have it. You should know you have it. If you can\u2019t find it in yourself to give me another chance then that\u2019s your problem. Stop punishing me for the past when the only thing we have is right now!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not punishing you.\u201d</p><p>Oh, that did it. I stormed over to him, nearly slipping in the mud and shoved my hands against his wet chest, pushing him back a step. I was unable to contain the stream of words that had been dying to come out. \u201cNow you\u2019re the fucking liar here. You\u2019ve wanted me to suffer the minute you found out about Javier and I. And you\u2019ve been doing a bang-up fucking job about it. You think I don\u2019t hate myself already for what I\u2019ve done? Now I just hate myself even more because every time I look at you I see a man that once loved me, a man whose love I should have believed in, should have had faith in and I didn\u2019t. So I lost that love and I lost you all for nothing! All because I\u2019m a stupid, scared little girl with scars on her leg that never deserved anything good in her life and who believed it. Now for the first time, I think I might be better than I thought, better than I ever gave myself credit for and you\u2019re the one who won\u2019t let me believe it.\u201d I blinked hard, trying to control the tears. They stayed put but the pain in my chest was unbearable. \u201cYou told me I was good, Camden. I know you want to believe in me but you\u2019re stopping yourself. Why can\u2019t you just love me again?\u201d I grabbed his face with my hands, his skin slick from the rain that continued to fall steadily. \u201cYou own my heart. Please let me have yours.\u201d</p><p>He closed his eyes, his lashes dark and wet. He breathed hard, his mouth open. I kept my hands on his face, trying to hold onto him even though I felt him slipping away.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to love you, Ellie.\u201d</p><p>All air left me. I was nothing inside but bones and blood. I was hollow, scooped out, unlovable. Undeserving. I was dying in the jungle, holding on to the one with the knife.</p><p>A small sob escaped me. His eyes flew open, a blue ocean of pain. He swallowed hard and put his hand behind my head, staring at me with stark determination. \u201cI don\u2019t want to love you, Ellie, but I do love you. I can\u2019t stop myself. I\u2019ve been trying to since the moment I saw you with him. You broke me, you broke my fucking heart.\u201d He closed his eyes again and rested his forehead against mine, our noses pressed against each other. \u201cYou broke me into so many pieces that I didn\u2019t think I could find myself again. And I\u2019m so damn scared, I\u2019m scared just like you. You\u2019ve always been my love Ellie Watt, since the very beginning. Since the moment I saw your face, your beautiful young face on that hot dry day. You were water for my soul. You made me feel like I had another half, someone else who understood what it was like to be unwanted.\u201d</p><p>Oh Jesus. I was melting in his hands.</p> <p>He gazed at me, so close, rain drops hanging from his lashes. \u201cBut the pain ... oh please, I can\u2019t go through that again. I look at you and I see him and I just want to see you again. I want to know that this can work. I want you and I to go home and become a home. I just want my heart to be safe in your hands because yours is safe in mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re safe with me,\u201d I told him, my voice choking up. \u201cCamden, you\u2019re safe with me.\u201d</p><p>I kissed him, wet and slick and his fingers pressed harder into my face. I pulled back and whispered, \u201cPlease believe that you\u2019re safe with me.\u201d I stroked his lower lip with my finger. \u201cI gave you pain and I can take it away, if you let me. If you let yourself love me.\u201d</p><p>His eyes went soft and dreamy for a few moments before they flared with a wild hit of lust. The look made my blood hot. He placed his lips on mine, drawing out a deep hard kiss, pressing himself into me, his tongue warm and feverish against mine. He moaned, the vibrations sinking into my core, heat radiating between my legs. Inappropriate, once again so fucking inappropriate.</p><p>But fuck it.</p><p>And fuck him. Literally.</p><p>\u201cCamden,\u201d I murmured into him, wanting him right there in the rain, his body and soul and heart.</p><p>He went for my neck, his tongue swooping up just behind my ear, licking the rim then sliding back down my jawline. He grabbed my hair hard with both hands, tugging sharply, and looked me dead in the eyes. He was all fire and hard angles.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d he said, his voice gruff. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll have you. Keep you. Own you. You belong to me, only to me, from now on.\u201d</p><p>Feather-soft butterflies swarmed my heart, filling me with beauty and light and all that was good.</p><p>\u201cUntil the waves crash at our feet,\u201d I said softly as his full lips pressed at my cheek.</p><p>\u201cBeyond that,\u201d he whispered. \u201cBeyond the ocean and the world and the stars. You\u2019re mine beyond that, baby, and I\u2019m yours.\u201d His hands suddenly dropped to my jeans and he swiftly unzipped them, slipping one of his long, skilled fingers down past my hair until it found my clit, swollen and ready. Steady hands, indeed.</p><p>\u201cAnd now, I\u2019m going to make you mine. I\u2019m going to make you forget you\u2019ve ever been with anyone else. I will own you from the inside out, with every hard inch of me.\u201d</p><p>With his dirty mouth and his deft fingers, I nearly came right there. Camden wasn\u2019t messing around. And now I would have his body and his heart. I would have him, all of him, every corner of his beautiful soul, every part of his hard, strong frame.</p><p>He began swirling his fingers around, dipping down into me.</p><p>\u201cChrist, you want this,\u201d he murmured as his fingers pushed in, my wetness soaking him to his knuckles. I gasped at the intrusion, then grinded myself into him.</p><p>\u201cI always want this,\u201d I said, kissing him, the frenzy building up inside of me. \u201cI always want you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re getting me,\u201d he said. \u201cMy beautiful girl.\u201d</p><p>With his hand still down my pants, he took my arm in the other and led me backward until I was up against a tree. He carefully pulled down my jeans until they were at my ankles then slid his whole hand between my legs, rubbing me back and forth. I quickly pulled my soaking wet tank top and bra off and his mouth went for my breasts, licking, pinching, making my nipples throb, an exquisite pain. I cried out, rain water pouring into my open mouth.</p><p>\u201cTell me you love me again,\u201d he commanded, pressing me harder against the tree, the bark digging into my back.</p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d I whimpered as he pressed his finger to my wall, massaging in tight circles while his thumb did the same to my clit. I couldn\u2019t hold on anymore. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>I came fast and hard, every part of me throbbing, clenching, pulsing as his hand continued to push me over the edge. I surrendered to him, to the rain that continued to pound onto us. My cries carried out into the jungle. \u201cOh god, oh god. Fucking god.\u201d</p><p>He removed his hand, grinning at me while I tried to get my bearings. The world was still spinning and I was lost in my own delirious state, just pulses of pleasure that still fired through me. I barely felt it when he grabbed me by the waist and turned me around so that my hands were clamped on the tree. He put his arm around my stomach and pulled me back, making my back arch. Next thing I heard was his pants coming off. His tee-shirt went flying to the muddy earth beside me.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so fucking beautiful,\u201d he groaned and I knew he was stroking himself. I tried to turn around and only got a quick look at his hard tatted body, all firm lines and rigid angles, his magnificent cock in his hands, the rain streaming all over him. He was a wet god and I was about to get pounded.</p><p>He pushed me back around. \u201cGrab the tree. This could get messy.\u201d</p><p>I did as he asked while I heard him moan again. He pressed the tip of his dick to the small of my back then slid it down my ass crack, my skin extra slick from the rain. I couldn\u2019t hide the shivers that rolled through me and I arched myself more, pressing my ass into him.</p><p>\u201cSlowly,\u201d Camden grunted. He put a hand at my waist, holding me in place, and continued to draw himself up and down until my clit calmed down and I needed friction all over again. I wanted him inside me, filing me to the brim, buried to the root. I tried again to get him inside me but his hand was firm. \u201cSlowly,\u201d he repeated. \u201cI don\u2019t know if we\u2019ll get a chance to do this again.\u201d</p><p>I knew what he meant by that. Where we were. What we were about to do. It made our coupling that much more urgent, much more sweet, much more poignant. I couldn\u2019t die without having him inside me one more time, feeling him as part of me, knowing he did love me, lust for me, need me.</p><p>I heard him suck in his breath and exhaled shakily, trying to contain himself.</p><p>\u201cNow,\u201d he said with a grunt. He slammed his cock into me and I shuddered from the impact, crying out, my hands slipping as I tried to hold onto the tree. He started hammering into me fast and smooth, groaning, his breath rapid, his hands tight around my waist. He thrust out and in, all the way to the hilt, till I felt like he\u2019d taken over half my body. The pleasure pain was all encompassing, radiating from my core to my fingertips and toes and he kept pounding and pounding and pounding, his balls smacking against my ass, my breasts swaying from each hit. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Then I started slipping, my boots giving away beneath me, my hands too slippery to grip the tree.</p><p>\u201cCamden!\u201d I cried out.</p><p>He quickly grabbed me around my chest, keeping me upright. Then he pulled out for a moment and turned me around. While I leaned on him, he bent down and took my underwear, jeans and boots off until we were both stark naked, standing in the rain and looking at each other. He was so fucking gorgeous it almost brought tears to my eyes. I needed him back inside me. Immediately. In any way I could get him.</p><p>I dropped to my knees, sinking into the warm mud, not giving a shit if I got dirty and took his cock into my mouth. I ran my teeth lightly over the hardened ridge until he gasped then soothed it with my tongue. He moaned. \u201cFuck.\u201d And moaned again.</p> <p>I tightened my fist, taking him in as far as he could go, sliding him in and out until the grip he had on my hair became vice-like. \u201cNot yet, not yet,\u201d he gasped. I looked up at him standing tall over me, the rivulets of water running over his beautiful ink and sculpted muscles. His eyes were lid-heavy with lust.</p><p>\u201cGet on top of me,\u201d he said and before I could respond he was lying down on his back, right on the muddy earth, and pulling me down on top of me. \u201cRide me. Fuck me. Fuck me as if it were the last time.\u201d</p><p>I straddled him eagerly and he grabbed me by the waist, lifting me up before impaling me on his cock. I moaned from the tension then started to grind myself into him. His muddy hands gripped my waist and when I leaned forward, they squeezed my swollen breasts, thumbing my nipples. I didn\u2019t give a fuck if I was covered in mud from head to toe, if we were drowned, dirty rats. I was going to ride the hell out of him, right here on the forest floor.</p><p>He pumped me up and down on him until I leaned back, letting the rain cascade down my chest, and he worked on my clit again. I felt utterly primal, alive, loved. We were animals fucking, humans making love, two wounded, tortured people bringing each other to ecstasy beneath tropical skies. I rode him hard until we were both going over the edge. I came first, screaming gibberish, my body letting loose, my walls gripping and milking his cock as the spasms went through me, each one more powerful than the next. When it was time for him to come, I looked down, making sure I watched the pleasure on his face, the pleasure he was getting from me and only me. His eyes rolled back, his head pressed harder into the earth, mud smeared all over his beautiful body. He moaned, grunting, \u201cFuck, fuck, fuck\u201d over and over again, gasping for breath, his mouth open in surprise like he couldn\u2019t believe what was happening.</p><p>I knew how he felt. I couldn\u2019t really believe it either. I was so lucky to have this man. My heart couldn\u2019t have been more full. I couldn\u2019t have been more high.</p> <p>God, I don\u2019t think I could have loved him more.</p><p>When we both calmed down, I went to get off of him but he quickly grabbed me and brought me down to his chest. \u201cNo,\u201d he grunted into my ear. \u201cStay where I can see you. Where I can feel you.\u201d</p><p>I nodded and nuzzled my face into the crook of his neck. He smelled like musk and damp earth, fresh and manly. \u201cI love you,\u201d he whispered. \u201cI was never meant to love anyone else. No matter what. Ellie Watt, you own me. And I\u2019ll keep you safe.\u201d</p><p>My throat felt thick and I blinked back tears. Above us, the rain was tapering off a little. I ran my hands over his face, my finger over his perfectly straight nose, over his dark, arched eyebrows, over his square jaw, the spots on his cheeks where I knew his dimples appeared when he smiled. I owned him. And he would keep me safe.</p><p>I kissed him softly, sweetly then lay my head back on his chest. We lay like that for a while, until the rain stopped and we finally realized we were lying naked in the middle of the Honduras jungle. As much as I wanted to keep lying there, keep feeling his heart beat against mine, his strong arms around me, protecting me, loving me, there was reality to face. A job to be done. A mission we were both committed to. It was heart-wrenching when I finally got off of him and slipped my clothes back on. The moment would be forever committed to my memory, keeping me going when everything else got scary, dangerous, hopeless. I would return to that moment when it was just him and I and for a brief time, nothing in the world mattered. No one could hurt us. It was just love and it was all we needed.</p><p>When we were both dressed \u2013 and still partly splattered with mud \u2013 we resumed our duty. We brought out the compasses and started walking again, heading northeast. I felt like I left something behind on that forest floor. The us I hoped we could return to.</p> <p>CHAPTER ELEVEN</p><p>It was dusk when we saw the first lights in the jungle. At first I was certain that it was a pair of animal eyes, maybe a panther, watching our every move. But the eyes turned into several eyes and the forest began to open up and suddenly the lights belonged to a walled fence and a pathway and the roof of a sprawling mansion.</p><p>We had found it.</p><p>This was Travis\u2019s compound.</p><p>\u201cNow what?\u201d I asked Camden as we stopped a football field\u2019s length away, sticking close to the trees for cover. We couldn\u2019t really see anything because of the high stone wall that went on forever, hiding the mansion and who knows what else behind it.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t happen to have a pair of binoculars in there?\u201d he asked, gently taking the backpack off my shoulders and opening it. \u201cMaybe night vision goggles?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Javier had them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course he did,\u201d he said. He sighed and rubbed his hand on his face. He looked up at the trees. \u201cWell, we won\u2019t have any idea of what we\u2019re dealing with if we can\u2019t see it. You good at climbing trees?\u201d</p> <p>I smiled. \u201cWorld\u2019s best date palm climber right here.\u201d</p><p>A weird flash came across his face, as if something dawned on him. \u201cI had a dream about you and I last week. We were in high school and climbed to the top of one of your uncle\u2019s date palms. There was a fire coming across the valley.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid we get burned?\u201d I asked, reaching for his hand and pulling him toward me.</p><p>He smiled sadly. \u201cWe did. But at least we were together.\u201d He cupped my face in his hands and my eyes closed at his touch. \u201cMy Ellie. My beautiful girl. I will burn for you. I will die for you.\u201d</p><p>My heart skipped and burst, overflowing until my chest was radiating with heat, love, peace. I turned my face and kissed his palm. \u201cYou give me life, Camden. Death doesn\u2019t seem so scary after that.\u201d</p><p>He pulled me close and kissed my forehead. \u201cHow about we climb this tree, see if we can get a good look before it gets dark?\u201d</p><p>I squeezed his hand and looked up at the tree closest to us. Sure, on the date farm I had a ladder to help me but the way this tree\u2019s branches were spaced out it was like a ladder anyway.</p><p>Camden gave me a boost up to the lowest branches but after that it was easy to climb. The only problem was the ants I saw crawling on the trunk. I hoped they weren\u2019t the really poisonous ones that Dom had warned us about.</p><p>We paused about half way up, at a part where the branches separated a bit and we could see out.</p><p>Jesus.</p><p>Travis\u2019s compound was a lot bigger than I had thought \u2013 it was like a palace. On the other side of the wall there was the main building, the mansion that seemed to go on forever, wings and levels and sections. There was a courtyard in the front with fountains, a huge pool among landscaped gardens, as well as a few other houses that were scattered about. Golf carts littered the manicured lawns, lit pathways snaked their way through outdoor sculptures and statues. There was also a helicopter pad with a helicopter resting on it.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t really see that far,\u201d Camden said, squinting at the distance. \u201cWhat does it look like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt looks like he\u2019s trying to recreate Versailles,\u201d I said honestly. Off with her head.</p><p>\u201cWhat about people? Are there guards?\u201d</p><p>There had to be. I tried to take it all in, paying attention to the details. There was a man driving a golf cart down a path, heavily armed of course. It looked like two guards were stationed by the front door, talking to someone I didn\u2019t recognize.</p><p>\u201cThere are some,\u201d I told him, relaying what I saw.</p><p>\u201cCould be more, too. How about getting over the fence?\u201d</p><p>My eyes followed it, searching for an opening. \u201cIt\u2019s too tall to scale, I think. And I don\u2019t have my grappling hook. There are a bunch of trees in the left corner though ... if we kept walking straight we\u2019d hit them. I think we could maybe climb over the fence that way, so long as the branches can hold us up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d at least be able to go over,\u201d he said.</p><p>I eyed him fearfully. \u201cI can\u2019t do this alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cI promise. We\u2019ll do it together. We\u2019ll find a way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo when we get in, then what?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cGet Gus and your mother. They are there. We will find them. You can break in. I have faith in your B and E skills.\u201d He smiled for a second. How far away that seemed now, how insane I was to break into Camden\u2019s house and rob him. That seemed like a lifetime ago.</p><p>My cheeks flushed with embarrassment. \u201cI can get us in. Then I guess we case the joint and see who we can find.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish it\u2019s going to be that simple. The odds are against us, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think the odds have always been against us, Camden. Don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cYou\u2019re right about that. Okay. If that\u2019s the plan, then that\u2019s the plan. Let\u2019s go get Gus and your mother.\u201d</p><p>I nodded and was about to head back down the tree when I remembered something.</p><p>\u201cYou said something about a big picture the other day,\u201d I noted. \u201cWhat did you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen did I say that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the hotel room. You said the bigger picture is bigger than we know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know?\u201d</p><p>I worried about the look in Camden\u2019s eyes. His brow was pinched together, eyes sullen, almost sad. I shook my head.</p><p>\u201cBen,\u201d he said gently. \u201cI need my son.\u201d</p><p>A heavy brick was placed on my heart. Of course, Ben. His son. He\u2019d barely mentioned what happened to him with Sophia. It must have been killing him to not have him. I\u2019d been so wrapped up in Gus and my mother, in Javier and in Travis, that I\u2019d forgotten all about his little boy. Camden had been suffering in silence all this time, knowing we were being pulled one way when his son was the other.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll get him back,\u201d I told him.</p><p>He nodded grimly. \u201cI hope so. I can\u2019t ... I can\u2019t let him stay with her. Not after what happened. You don\u2019t know how hard it was for me to leave him.\u201d</p><p>I smiled sadly, feeling pinched with guilt. \u201cI can imagine. I\u2019m sorry you had to come for me.\u201d</p><p>His face fell. \u201cOh, Ellie. No.\u201d He reached over and kissed me. \u201cI don\u2019t regret coming to get you. I had to. I didn\u2019t have a choice. I was wanted ... I couldn\u2019t have gone to get Ben without being caught. I would have been put away. And then what would have happened? I never would have seen him again. Never would have seen you again. I had to come for you. And then, I promised myself that when I had you safe, we\u2019d come back for him.\u201d He swallowed hard, his blue eyes watering. \u201cWe are getting out of this alive. We are getting my son back. I don\u2019t care what it takes.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His pain was breaking my heart. \u201cI will help you do everything and anything. You\u2019ll get Ben. You\u2019ll be the father you weren\u2019t allowed to be before.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. I hope he believed me. Camden McQueen deserved to have all his wrongs righted.</p><p>He exhaled loudly, blinking hard, then said, \u201cCome on. We better hurry while we have some light left. We better stay quiet too, we don\u2019t know if they\u2019ve got people listening at the wall.\u201d</p><p>We went back down the tree and I could hear him sniffing. More of my heart fell to pieces. But I had to be strong for him. To do this job. And get him home.</p> <p>Once on the ground, we walked along as silently as we could, mindful of every single leaf we were treading on. I was actually glad that we still had the mud from our sexual romp all over us still, it darkened my white tank top and arms and made us blend in a bit more with the vegetation. We were a few coats shy of looking like we\u2019d rolled out of Apocalypse Now.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t long before we came to the group of trees that went dipping over the top of the wall. On closer inspection it looked like the branches were firm enough to support Camden\u2019s weight. I guess we had no choice but to find out.</p><p>I stopped and pointed up, motioning for us to climb. I quickly checked the gun in my boot and my knife in the other, making sure they were secure. I was nervous as hell. Like, heart-racing, lungs seizing, pins and needles shooting up and down my spine and massaging my head kind of nervous. Panic attack nervous.</p><p>Camden placed his hand on my shoulder and held it there until I felt like I could push through it and go on. There was no choice. We committed to being heroes \u2013 we couldn\u2019t back out because I felt like a coward at the last minute.</p><p>Heroes. I liked the sound of that.</p> <p>I gave him a smile that probably looked depressing as hell. Then, with another boost from him, I climbed up the tree until we were at the right set of branches. I lay down on it, straddling it with my arms and legs, and shimmied my way across the branch. It dipped a bit with my weight but not by much. I moved as slowly as possible, not wanting anyone to notice a tree with leaves shaking for no reason and hoped it would be passed off as an animal or something.</p><p>I looked down. I had cleared the wall but it was a fifteen foot drop to the ground, thankfully in an area behind a set of flowering bushes. I hoped my ankles would forgive me.</p><p>I glanced over my shoulder at Camden who was waiting at the end of the branch, barely visible against the tree. I nodded at him, then quickly swung under the branch and let go. I landed on the ground with a soft thud and then rolled once I realized my legs weren\u2019t reliable. I lay on my back and looked up at the tree, staying low and waiting until Camden had joined me.</p><p>I could barely see him go across the branch but I did see the branch start to sag dramatically under his weight. Fuck, him being 6\u20322\u2032\u2032 and all muscle, he had to be at least 60 pounds heavier than me. He paused, probably unsure of whether he should continue or not.</p><p>Suddenly a light lit up the wall in front of me and I could hear the whir of a golf cart\u2019s engine in the distance. I froze and prayed they wouldn\u2019t come any closer, that they wouldn\u2019t shine up in the tree. Camden stayed completely still. So did my heart.</p><p>After a few nerve-bursting moments, the light finally moved along the wall and the golf cart continued on its way. I slowly turned over and poked my head around the bushes. It looked like this was part of their nightly patrol.</p> <p>\u201cCamden, hurry,\u201d I whispered as softly as I could. He heard me. The branch started moving again, the leaves shaking. I winced.</p><p>Then the branch broke with the loudest snap.</p><p>I gasped as Camden and the branch came crashing down to the ground. I quickly scampered over to him and looked around in a panic, hoping no one heard anything. Camden got up, staying low and put out his hand to let me know he was okay. We stayed huddled next to each other, frozen in fear, waiting for time to pass, for our passage to go unnoticed.</p><p>When no lights came back on us and we didn\u2019t hear anyone approaching, we exhaled in unison. I patted him on the back, to let him know we were okay so far. He nodded to the row of hedges that lined the lit path nearby. If we stayed behind them, there was a chance we wouldn\u2019t be seen and it would lead us all the way to the back of the mansion.</p><p>We got down on our stomachs and started crawling on the stiff grass, sticking as close to the hedge as possible. I almost found it amusing that we were doing moves that belonged in a Mission Impossible movie but considering this was an actual life and death situation and Tom Cruise wasn\u2019t going to start sprinting out of the bushes to save us, it wasn\u2019t very funny. Maybe one day I\u2019d look back on the impossibility of this all, what we had to go through, the things we had to do. One day, if I was lucky.</p><p>We crawled until my limbs were thoroughly scratched up and I added grass stains to the things I was currently covered with, but we eventually came to the house. Camden stopped and I crawled up around the side of him. He brought his mouth to my ear and whispered. \u201cThere are lights on at the farthest end of the house and upstairs. There are no lights here and there\u2019s a door. Do you think you can tell if it\u2019s alarmed?\u201d</p><p>I nodded. I knew when security systems were up and running and with luck I could defeat them. That is if Travis had your regular home alarm system. If this place was wired like Fort Knox, I had no chance in hell. Only problem was, it would be noisy.</p><p>I whispered back. \u201cSmash and crash. I can use my gun. But if there\u2019s anyone around where the alarm panel is, they\u2019ll hear it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s hope it\u2019s not alarmed then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s hope there\u2019s no one on the other side of that door, period.\u201d</p><p>He quickly kissed me. \u201cIf anything goes wrong, you get out. You run like hell. Don\u2019t worry about me.\u201d</p><p>Like hell I would run away. But I nodded to placate him and took in a deep breath. We looked around to make sure the coast was clear and ran across the path for the door, flattening ourselves against the wall. We waited a few moments and then I quickly reached into my pocket where I had stuck with lock-picking tools from earlier. Same ones I used to break into Camden\u2019s house.</p><p>It didn\u2019t take me long to pick the lock. That was the easy part. The hard part was having the courage to open the door. Though Travis\u2019s house wouldn\u2019t have a system connected to the police in any way, it would be connected to some monitoring station in the house or even outside of it. If the door was alarmed, I had 30\u201360 seconds to find the alarm panel and smash it with the butt of my gun. If we were lucky, the beeps wouldn\u2019t be too loud and no one would hear me destroy the panel before it had a chance to signal that some had broken in.</p><p>If we were unlucky ... well ...</p><p>I readied myself, getting my head into game mode, finding the confidence I had somewhere inside me and opened the door.</p><p>I didn\u2019t realize I\u2019d been holding my breath until we were both inside. It was dark where we were, with tile floors. Maybe a laundry room. I heard the beeps being set off, sounding like sirens in the night even though in reality they weren\u2019t too loud. I followed the sounds, walking as quietly as possible with Camden right behind me then found the alarm in a closet. I took out my gun and with a quick jab smashed the panel, Camden\u2019s hands catching the falling plastic and glass before it clattered to the floor.</p><p>The alarm was disabled. Now we had to stand there and wait for our fate, for the guns that would be inevitably drawn on us if we\u2019d be heard. We listened, hearing only the crickets outside the door that was still open and the sound of each other breathing. It must have been the longest couple of minutes of my life and yet I was terrified to move, to open the door and explore the rest of the house. I felt safe in the darkness of that room with Camden at my side.</p><p>Finally his hand grasped mine. It was wet with sweat and somehow knowing he felt as scared as I did made me feel better, that I wasn\u2019t alone.</p><p>He brought out his cell phone from his pocket and shone it around us briefly. We were in fact in a large laundry room, two washers, two dryers and a linen closet where the alarm had been. He aimed the light at the closed door that led into the rest of the house and then put his phone away. I heard him reach into my backpack and withdraw his gun. I gripped mine tightly in my hands and he went for the door, opening it as slowly as possible.</p><p>We poked our heads out into a long hallway, the only illumination coming from a green-glass lamp on a table at the end of it. The walls were done up with stoic portraits of Mexican men, posing gallantly like royalty. I had to wonder if Travis actually built this place or if he just took it over from someone else in the cartel. The thought of him, his cold inhuman eyes, made me shiver but I had to let the feeling go. This was far from over.</p><p>I wondered where we could go next. Though there were a few doors and rooms coming off of the hallway, it wasn\u2019t exactly smart to start opening each one and asking if Gus was there. We\u2019d have to spy, observe, hunker down somewhere until we knew what was what and who was where.</p><p>I placed my hand on Camden\u2019s arm as a way of telling him to stay put then quickly crept back into the laundry room. I gently closed the door to the outside, closed the door to the linen closet, hiding the pieces of the broken panel underneath some towels, and then closed the laundry room door. If we were going to be spending a few hours in the house, then everything had to look exactly like it was. We had to go undetected.</p><p>If Camden was confused by my actions he didn\u2019t show it. Now we just had one thing to do and we had to do it right. We had to find a place to hide. Because the laundry room had access to the back, it would be a high traffic area. We had to find something that was more out of the beaten path.</p><p>I took Camden\u2019s free hand in mine and started leading him down the hall, away from the light at the end. He had said this end looked completely dark from the outside and we needed to be heading away from the people who lived here.</p><p>The second room down the hall was dark but there were large windows that had the outside lights streaming from in between the curtains, casting some illumination into the room. It was a library. Lots of leather couches, chairs, tables and bookcase after bookcase. In the beam of light I could see layers of dust on the tables and motes floating in the air \u2013 a room that was rarely used. It\u2019s not like Travis started a reading habit in his spare time. This place would have to do.</p><p>I brought Camden into the room and did a quick sweep of the area. Where to hide? We had to be close enough to the hall to hear people but we couldn\u2019t be visible. Taking a chance, he brought out his phone and flashed its weak glow around the room. Then he aimed it upward. There was a whole other level up there, a small balcony that wrapped around the room. A sturdy-looking ladder led up to the loft. We both eyed each other. If we lay low up top, just above the door, we wouldn\u2019t be seen and we could hear everything.</p><p>We quickly climbed up the ladder, wincing when it scuffed a bit against the hardwood floor from our movement and crept along the balcony until we were above the door. Like below, it was lined with more and more books.</p><p>I lay down on my stomach as flush against the bookcase as I could muster and Camden did the same, our heads facing each other. We both brought our guns out and laid them on the floor beside us. Another advantage we had \u2013 if someone did come in the room and discover us, we could pick them off easily. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I rested my chin on the floor and Camden did the same. I leaned forward and kissed him, then took his hand in mine. We stared at each other, eyes shining in the darkness, and waited. Waited for signs of life. We waited until we fell asleep, Travis\u2019s house lulling us into dreamland.</p><p>CHAPTER TWELVE</p><p>Scattered Spanish entered my dreams until my brain somehow figured out that this was reality and I needed to wake up. Camden\u2019s hand on my face helped too.</p><p>My eyes flew open and I immediately froze as I remembered where I was. I was lying down on my stomach on the loft of Travis\u2019s library. Camden was across from me, his head inches from mine, one hand stroking my face, the other on his gun. He implored me with eyes not to make a sound or panic. I swallowed hard, trying to still my heart, and listened.</p> <p>A bunch of men were yelling in Spanish to each other. It was coming from outside the room, most likely from outside the house. My suspicions were cleared up when I heard the front door slam and someone stomped inside.</p><p>\u201cIdiots,\u201d a man yelled angrily.</p><p>Travis.</p><p>I knew that voice too well. I had to fight against the urge to pick up my gun, leap off the balcony and hunt him down. It would be so simple. I\u2019d probably die in the process but for a split second I didn\u2019t care. I only wanted him dead. Then I realized how badly the revenge still ran through me, the pain his presence still brought me.</p><p>Knowing this, knowing everything about me, Camden brushed the hair off my face. And my thoughts went to him. How silly we both looked in the daylight, dried mud caked on in splotches all over ourselves.</p> <p>There was someone else walking out in the hall, the footsteps going past the library and stopping not too far away. Perhaps by the laundry room. I prayed they wouldn\u2019t need any towels.</p><p>\u201cIs everything all right, sir?\u201d the person asked in a near perfect American accent.</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not fine,\u201d Travis answered rather snidely. \u201cI don\u2019t understand how they haven\u2019t been found yet. When was the last time they were spotted?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAguascalientes,\u201d the man answered. \u201cStill nothing different. We are trying\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey should have died. They should have been in that car. I don\u2019t understand how something so god damn simple can go wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least they were heading north. Not coming here.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t give a shit if they were coming here or not. I want them fucking dead so I don\u2019t have to worry about them fucking things up again. They made me look like a damn idiot. The whole cartel, we looked like damn idiots. All of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t think they\u2019re coming here, then why don\u2019t you just ...\u201d</p><p>A pause. \u201cJust what? Kill her? What kind of barbarian do you think I am? She\u2019s my wife.\u201d</p><p>The word wife stabbed me. My eyes flew to Camden. He couldn\u2019t have been talking about my mother. Could he?</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mean any disrespect,\u201d the man said quickly. \u201cI just figured from the way you were ... talking ... the other night. From what she\u2019s gone through ... that it was on the agenda.\u201d</p><p>Travis chuckled maliciously. \u201cAgenda? There is no agenda. I will deal with Amelie when I am ready to deal with her. Until then, keep her down there.\u201d He grunted, his footsteps echoing down the hall. \u201cFix me an omelette, would you? It would be nice if someone here wasn\u2019t completely incompetent.\u201d</p><p>Amelie. My mother. A bunch of thoughts flew into my head. My mother was Travis\u2019s wife, even though that made no sense at all. I never saw a wedding ring on her finger and my father had died. But he had mentioned she was \u201cdown there\u201d which I had to assume meant someplace in the house like a basement. That at least gave us a direction to go in and I could try and make sense about all the other shit later.</p><p>Then there was the fact that he didn\u2019t once mention Gus.</p> <p>At least Este\u2019s hunch about Javier not being expected here was true. Then again, if he said the last place that we\u2019d been spotted was Aguascalientes, then whatever happened to Javier and the crew out there in the jungle wasn\u2019t orchestrated by Travis.</p><p>Which meant ... oh fuck.</p><p>My eyes widened and judging from the way that Camden narrowed his eyes into a steely gaze, he was realizing the same thing. Nothing had happened to Javier.</p><p>We were set up.</p><p>They had planned for us to come here.</p><p>And here is exactly where we were.</p><p>Motherfucker.</p><p>I was pretty sure my blood was boiling over. I could feel my veins pulsing at my temples, my face growing hot and red. I was ready to go fucking apeshit. I was ready to lose my fucking mind.</p><p>Camden let go of his gun and put his other hand to my face and held me firmly.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he whispered softly. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be okay.\u201d</p><p>I tried to shake my head but his grip increased.</p><p>\u201cEllie. It\u2019s going to be okay. We know your mother is here. We can get her out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were set up,\u201d I hissed harshly. \u201cAnd Gus?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll get him too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he\u2019s here, we\u2019ll find him. But we find her first. She can help us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey probably know we\u2019re in here.\u201d</p><p>He smiled, briefly, softly. \u201cThey probably do. But we don\u2019t know how this will play out. You want your mother and Gus. They want Travis dead. We might be able to have both those things and walk out of here alive. We at least have to try.\u201d</p><p>I understood what he was saying but it didn\u2019t stop the burning pain in my gut, that feeling of utter foolishness. I hated myself for not seeing what Javier had been doing. He was spiteful more than anything, spurned by my devotion to Camden, to the death of his sister, the death that I inadvertently caused. He was a loose cannon, mad for power, and I had told myself that when I least suspected him that\u2019s when he\u2019d pull the rug out from under me. And even though I told Camden I wouldn\u2019t put it past Javier to set me up, I still hadn\u2019t believed it. I thought he loved me enough to want what\u2019s best for me. To see me well. I believed in his love without remembering what kind of love it was.</p><p>Gus, my dear sweet Gus, had once told me to never mistake obsession for love. He was so right, time and time again.</p><p>Javier had set Camden and I up. To come here. Perhaps to walk free or perhaps to fail. He left me in that forest, using me as a pawn, walking blindly forward for Gus and my mother. He was both doing me a favor, leading me to what I wanted, and cementing my doom. Because whatever Javier was after, it wasn\u2019t my happiness. It was his. And at this point in our lives, what made us both happy was very far apart. I wanted family. I wanted love. I wanted Camden.</p><p>He wanted power. Just power and only that.</p><p>I closed my eyes, trying to escape the humiliation at how wrong I was about everything. I didn\u2019t handle being made a fool of very well. We listened awhile longer to the sounds of the mansion. It sounded like someone was at the other end of the house, perhaps the man in the kitchen, making the omelette. When those sounds quieted down, I could only assume that the breakfast was being delivered to Travis in some other room in the house.</p><p>As long as we didn\u2019t stumble across that room, this was our chance.</p><p>I nodded at Camden and we got up.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until we had carefully climbed down the ladder and onto the main floor of the library that I realized how badly I needed to pee. That was the thing about this that they don\u2019t show you in the movies - everyone has to pee at some point, no matter how inconvenient the circumstances.</p><p>I grabbed Camden\u2019s arm and whispered, \u201cWhat are the chances of me finding a bathroom nearby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you serious?\u201d</p><p>I nodded, eyes wide. \u201cI don\u2019t joke about peeing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo behind the couch,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe do it on a stack of first editions while you\u2019re at it.\u201d</p><p>I nearly smiled. Pissing on Travis\u2019s floor was a small bit of sweet revenge.</p><p>I went behind the couch which was right by the windows and did my business. When I was done I peeled back just the tiniest bit of curtain and peeked out. I could see the wide front steps leading out to the elaborate courtyard in the front, a row of golf carts across it. There were two men with rifles stationed at the foot of the stairs, looking alert, two men we\u2019d probably end up having to take out when it came time to get out of here.</p><p>I pulled up my pants and Camden supressed a smile as I stepped out from behind the couch.</p><p>\u201cSee anything?\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cJust the two men with rifles that I saw last night. I don\u2019t think this place is as heavily armed as I thought. Or I\u2019m terribly wrong.\u201d</p><p>He rubbed his lips together and breathed out sharply through his nose. \u201cI hate it when you\u2019re wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d I shook out my arms and legs, took my gun out of my boot and said, \u201cLet\u2019s go down and get my mother.\u201d</p><p>Of course, we didn\u2019t know where \u201cdown\u201d was. We slinked out into the hallway, making sure the coast was clear, and sidled our way down the walls, careful not to brush off any of the ugly paintings. We checked every room down at this end of the house and, with great trepidation, every door. There were bedrooms, studies, game rooms, all untouched and unused, but nothing that would lead to a basement.</p><p>We stopped at the end of the hall and I rubbed my palms against my jeans. There was only one way for us to go, in the direction of the kitchen and Travis. I looked to Camden who closed his eyes and took a calming breath before giving me a short nod.</p><p>We crept back down the hall, my pulse quickening once we passed the safety zone of the library and the laundry room. Everything beyond this was unknown and occupied. It was going to take either a lot of luck or a lot of bullets to get us through this.</p><p>And first, we had to cross through the foyer.</p><p>We stopped at the edge of the wall and I peered quickly around it. The foyer was all marble and gaudy accents, tile floors and hanging chandeliers with a giant winding staircase leading up to the second floor. I could see through the front stain glass windows the shadows of two guards outside, seemingly closer to the door than the pair I had just seen.</p><p>I held up four fingers to Camden, letting him know there were four of them in total now. Four of them, two of us and who knew how many others there were in different parts of the compound. The odds were continually stacked against us.</p><p>Lightly, silently, as if we were running on air, Camden and I scampered across the foyer before we were spotted by anyone and didn\u2019t even relax once we were safely behind the wall of the adjacent hallway. I could hear noises, clattering of pots and pans, coming from the room closest to us \u2013 the kitchen.</p><p>I motioned for Camden to stay still. I didn\u2019t know what I was doing now. The fear inside was struggling to take over, to become free. But I wouldn\u2019t let it. I would control my fear. I would use it in my favor, to work for me.</p><p>My fear was about to help me make some very hard decisions.</p><p>I crept silently over to the kitchen doorway, crouched low and poked my head around it. There was a man, his back to me thank god, putting away stuff in the fridge. I didn\u2019t know if he was the same man I heard speaking to Travis earlier, but it didn\u2019t matter. He had to be taken out if we were going to get out of here. The risk of him seeing us was far too great. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Unfortunately, I didn\u2019t have a silencer on my gun, so I couldn\u2019t shoot him even though I currently had a clear shot. I also didn\u2019t have any means of knocking the guy out without causing any racket. He wasn\u2019t as big as Camden but he was still bigger than me and would put up a fight. At the first sound of struggle, I knew Travis or the guards would come running.</p><p>So it had to be me.</p><p>I had to do this.</p><p>Very slowly, very carefully, I pulled the knife out from my boot. It felt cold and slippery in my sweating hands and I held onto it as tight as I could, channeling my fear through my hand.</p> <p>I stayed crouched, stayed low, and eased my way toward the man.</p><p>I got close.</p><p>Really close.</p><p>Hoped he couldn\u2019t hear how loud my heart was beating.</p><p>I straightened up.</p> <p>Knife out.</p><p>Hand shaking.</p><p>The man reached further into the fridge, grabbing something.</p><p>I was right behind him.</p><p>I raised my arms, one ready to put over his mouth, the other to draw the blade across his throat.</p><p>A tear leaked out of my eye.</p> <p>He suddenly stepped backward, into me, and turned around in surprise. Wide, dark eyes met mine.</p><p>He probably expected to see Travis.</p><p>Not me.</p><p>And before either of us could even react, Camden was sprinting across the kitchen.</p><p>Grabbing the knife out of my hand and shouldering me out of the way.</p><p>He put his hand over the man\u2019s mouth and pushed the man\u2019s head back into one of the shelves in the fridge.</p><p>Camden took the knife with one swift motion, slit the man\u2019s throat.</p><p>The man\u2019s eyes widened even more then froze, blood spilling out of him and down his white shirt. Camden held the man there until he was certain he was dead. Then he took the man in his arms and nodded to the pantry, trying to get me to open the door.</p> <p>I couldn\u2019t move. My body rocked with terrors while everything inside of me froze. Blood pooled toward my boots.</p><p>Camden managed to open the pantry and put the body inside, closing the door quietly behind him. Then he came over to the sink, took paper towels from the dispenser and quickly wiped up the blood at my feet. He shoved the reddened towels under the sink, closed the fridge door and grabbed my shoulders. I looked down at his hands, covered in blood, leaving bloody prints on me.</p><p>\u201cEllie,\u201d he whispered, shaking me. \u201cEllie. Look at me. Look at me.\u201d</p><p>I raised my head and looked at his eyes. They were wild, pupils completely dilated, but they were familiar. He was still my Camden.</p><p>Oh god, what had he done?</p><p>What had I been about to do?</p><p>I opened my mouth to speak but nothing came out.</p><p>\u201cEllie,\u201d he said again, his voice hoarser now. \u201cI couldn\u2019t let you do it, you\u2019d never forgive yourself. I\u2019d rather this be on my conscience than yours. I\u2019m getting my son back and I\u2019m going to do whatever I can to make that happen.\u201d He reached into his back pocket and pulled out another gun. \u201cI found this on him. Do you want it or should I?\u201d</p><p>I licked my lips and managed to say, \u201cYou have it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m keeping you safe,\u201d he said and quickly kissed my forehead. \u201cCome on.\u201d</p><p>He grabbed my hand and led me out of the kitchen back to the hallway.</p><p>As sick with shock and horror at what we had just done, I felt a twinge of relief deep inside. The man, who would have no doubt killed us, was dead. We didn\u2019t have to worry about him. And I now knew, I saw, that Camden was prepared to do absolutely anything to keep me alive and get back to his son. I could only hope that he\u2019d make peace with it one day, if we managed to get out of this on our own two feet. The human heart had the capacity to take on only so much and I knew Camden\u2019s heart was overburdened as it was.</p><p>We continued down the hall, pausing every few steps to listen. There was some shuffling from one of the rooms at the very end. The door was open and the room faced to the back where the morning sun was spilling into it. It seemed like a place that Travis would sit and have breakfast, perhaps a sunroom where he could sit and think about all the money he was making, drugs he was distributing, people he was killing.</p><p>I wondered if Camden was going to take me straight there. Take himself straight to Travis, kill him and have it all over with.</p><p>But someone else\u2019s voice came from that room, speaking in Spanish. Travis answered him, also in Spanish, albeit rusty. I couldn\u2019t really figure out what they were talking about, the news perhaps, some event in Honduras. Unfortunately, that made two of them in there. It wouldn\u2019t be so easy now. I doubted we could go in the room the way we were and take them out.</p><p>Camden paused then instead of continuing toward the voices, he carefully tried the handle on the first door to our left.</p><p>Locked.</p><p>And locked for a reason.</p><p>He looked to me questioningly. Could I do this?</p><p>I nodded and brought out the lock picker with fumbling fingers. I kept hearing Travis down the hall, knowing how close we were to him, how close we were to getting my mother out. Though it took longer than normal, I managed to pick the lock. We carefully pushed the door open and I held my breath waiting for it creak loudly. It didn\u2019t.</p><p>And there were a set of stairs leading down into the dark.</p><p>We had found it.</p><p>Camden motioned for me to go first, the stairs were lit by a bare bulb, and he ever-so-carefully closed the door behind us. We went down slowly, step by step, my legs feeling weak, my jaw clenched hard.</p><p>We had found it but I was afraid to see what it was.</p><p>I stepped off the last step, my boots on hard concrete. There was darkness all around us, the light from the stairs not reaching very far.</p><p>Suddenly a flashback came into my vision. Me, eleven years old, walking down the stairs to Travis\u2019s basement by accident, looking for money that wasn\u2019t there and only finding the chemicals that would change the course of my entire life.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t quite ironic but it was definitely something.</p><p>A moan came from the corner of the room and I realized that though we couldn\u2019t see what or who was down here, they could see us.</p><p>I squeezed my gun for assurance and then took a step forward.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d I whispered softly. \u201cMom?\u201d</p><p>The moan got louder. I walked toward it and then Camden quickly brought out his phone, shining the weak light straight ahead of us.</p><p>My chest was shredded by what I saw.</p><p>There was a cage in the corner of the room, a large cage, like one you\u2019d see when transporting animals to a zoo.</p><p>My mother was in the cage.</p><p>She was sitting half up, leaning against the bars, wearing what looked like the same dress I had seen her wear at Travis\u2019s party. Her hands were gathered behind her back. Duct tape around her mouth. Her eyes were crazed, filled with tears, pleading for us.</p><p>\u201cWe need light,\u201d Camden\u2019s voice came through, calm and steady. He got up quickly, shining his phone around and found another bare bulb hanging from the ceiling and pulled the string.</p><p>Everything lit up. I glanced around me quickly, taking in a very familiar sight. It was like the same basement he scarred me in but worse, much, much worse. It looked like a meth lab crossed with a mad scientist\u2019s lab. And very close to where my mother lay in her dirty cage were glass jar after glass jar of crawling black insects. Ants. Bullet ants. Este\u2019s assumption about Travis using them for torture wasn\u2019t just a silly hunch after all.</p><p>I looked back to my mom and immediately crouched down beside her, trying to ignore the welts she had all over her bare arms and legs. Insect bites.</p><p>\u201cMom,\u201d I said, my voice breaking. \u201cIt\u2019s me, Ellie. Your daughter. We\u2019re going to get out of here okay?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head back and forth, tears spilling down her cheeks, and I reached into the cage and pulled the duct tape off of her mouth in one go.</p><p>She winced from the pain and I whispered, \u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEllie,\u201d she cried softly and her voice reached down into my very soul. If I didn\u2019t hold it together I was going to lose it.</p><p>\u201cMom, it\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t get out of here,\u201d she cried.</p><p>\u201cYes, we will,\u201d I told her, my throat closing up. \u201cTogether. This is Camden. He\u2019s going to help us.\u201d I motioned behind me to Camden who was crouched down at my back. \u201cWhere is Gus?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGus?\u201d she asked. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>My veins had more ice than blood in them.</p><p>\u201cGus,\u201d I said again, fighting to keep my voice steady. \u201cHe was taken by Travis. You know Gus, Mom, you know Gus. He came all the way to Mexico with Camden, to get me. We have to get him, I owe him this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry sweetie,\u201d my mom said softly, shaking her head. \u201cGus isn\u2019t here.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER THIRTEEN</p><p>Her words settled over me like fine, cold dust.</p><p>Gus. Wasn\u2019t. Here.</p><p>\u201cBut Javier said ...\u201d I started. I didn\u2019t even bother finishing the sentence.</p><p>\u201cJavier lies,\u201d my mom said. \u201cHow do you think I ended up here with Travis?\u201d</p><p>I narrowed my eyes at her, the rage building up inside, threatening to spill out. \u201cBecause you\u2019re weak. And you\u2019re a fool. And so am I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEllie,\u201d Camden warned me.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I hissed at him. I was about to lose it. About to lose everything. I squeezed my gun so hard I could feel the ridges cutting into my palm. Javier had lied to me. He told me Gus was here. All along I was chasing after something that wasn\u2019t real. Where was Gus?</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I cried out. \u201cWhy did he lie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause,\u201d she said, her eyes avoiding mine, \u201che knew you\u2019d never come for me. But you\u2019d go for your father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy father?\u201d I asked while I heard Camden suck in his breath behind me. \u201cHe\u2019s dead. I know he\u2019s dead. Don\u2019t tell me Javier lied about that too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEllie, I think we should get her out of here first,\u201d Camden said quickly. \u201cI hear something upstairs.\u201d</p><p>I ignored him and my mom went on. \u201cThe father you know is dead, Ellie. I\u2019m sorry sweetie. He was ... Travis killed him. To take possession of me. We never knew what we were getting into when we came here. We only wanted ... revenge. For you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe father I know?\u201d I asked, suddenly recalling Javier wording things very similarly.</p><p>She gave me a sad smile. \u201cEllie, I\u2019m sorry. Gus is your real father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>What?</p><p>This was too much. My brain started to shut down on itself.</p><p>Gus. All this time. Gus. The man I was looking for, the man who was like a father to me more than my real father was in fact my real father. This shit couldn\u2019t even be digested. My mother had an affair with Gus. Who the fuck didn\u2019t she have an affair with?</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d Camden swore under his breath. \u201cI had a feeling.\u201d</p><p>I whipped my head to look at him. \u201cYou had a feeling and you didn\u2019t tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know for sure and I didn\u2019t know how,\u201d he said quickly. \u201cI knew you wanted to get him back badly enough as it was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Javier knew that too,\u201d my mother went on, trying to adjust herself. I was both so angry at her and her lies and hurting because she was hurt. \u201cHe knew you\u2019d come here for Gus if he told you that Travis had him.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBut why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo kill Travis.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head, trying to get some sense into it. \u201cStill?

You\u2019re just like him.\u201d Whether I meant Travis or Javier by that it didn\u2019t matter.</p><p>\u201cWe have to go, now,\u201d Camden said louder.</p><p>As if on cue, the building rumbled and shook slightly, the light bulb swaying.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell was that?\u201d I asked, automatically looking to my mom.</p><p>She looked bewildered. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJavier,\u201d Camden said.</p><p>My mother\u2019s mouth dropped open. \u201cJavier is here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe brought us here,\u201d I told her. \u201cHow else would have we found you? How else would he have insured that I would keep going after Gus?\u201d My voice cracked over his name.</p><p>\u201cHe ditched us in the jungle on the way here,\u201d Camden filled in. \u201cObviously knowing we would keep coming. I guess he was waiting for us to make the first move. Either he\u2019s gotten impatient or they somehow know we\u2019re down here with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, fuck this,\u201d I said and quickly took my lock-picking tools to the cage she was being kept in. Once I had gotten that open, I crawled in beside her and got her handcuffs off.</p><p>She rubbed her raw wrists and looked at me proudly. \u201cI taught you well. You always were the best at picking locks.\u201d</p> <p>My lip automatically curled. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be proud at me for being a con artist, for being like you. You should be proud that I\u2019m bothering to get you out of here after everything you\u2019ve done to me.\u201d I grabbed her by her arm and pulled her up and out of the cage, ignoring the look on her face, like I\u2019d slapped her. \u201cCan you walk?\u201d</p><p>She swallowed hard but nodded. \u201cYes. I\u2019ve only been in there for a few days. I ... I talked back to him the other night and ...\u201d</p><p>I raised my hand. \u201cI don\u2019t want to hear it.\u201d I looked at Camden. \u201cYou\u2019ll take care of her okay?\u201d Before he could answer, I snatched the other gun from his pocket and ran toward the stairs just as I heard gunfire breaking out upstairs.</p><p>\u201cEllie!\u201d Camden screamed at me, full-on horror.</p><p>But I kept running, gun in each hand, taking the stairs two by two to the top.</p><p>I was getting Gus back.</p><p>And I was going to make everyone pay.</p><p>I slammed the door open into the hall and was surprised to already see a guard running toward me. I quickly raised my gun and shot him in the head before he had a chance to aim at me. Then I kicked the door back shut, my gun already pointed straight forward and saw Dom at the opposite end of the hallway. I figured the guard was running toward someone.</p> <p>Dom froze where he was, his gun also drawn.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you fucking move!\u201d I screamed at him. \u201cDon\u2019t you fucking move.\u201d</p><p>To his credit, Dom stayed put. I had a feeling it\u2019s because he wasn\u2019t allowed to kill me. I was going to have to make that work in my favor.</p><p>I ran down the hall toward him but when I crossed the foyer I was met with glass breaking and bullets riddling the walls. I kept running, noticing there was fire coming up from behind where Dom was, filling the end of the hallway.</p><p>I stopped in front of him and immediately pistol whipped him across his nose. He cried out, grabbing his face and dropping his gun. I scooped it up, sticking it in my boots. Now I had three guns. I had a feeling I could never have enough.</p><p>More bullets and shots came from the foyer. I quickly grabbed Dom and swung him around the corner into the laundry room, shutting the door behind us. I slammed his head against the door, stuck the end of my gun against his temple, and yelled, \u201cTalk! Tell me every fucking thing you know or I will kill you.\u201d</p><p>He looked at me in utter fear, at my eyes which must have shown the rage that was flowing through me. What had Javier said earlier about depravity? Well he must have known I had that in spades, just waiting for the right moment for me to snap.</p><p>And I had snapped.</p><p>\u201cTalk!\u201d I screamed again, my spit flying into his bloody face.</p><p>\u201cYou were set up,\u201d he said, panicking. \u201cFrom the start.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou fuck! And you said you liked me.\u201d</p><p>He blinked several times. \u201cI do like you. But I love my family.\u201d</p><p>I pushed the gun harder into his head. \u201cWhat was the plan? Where is Gus?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were supposed to be a diversion. You\u2019d kill Travis and we\u2019d swoop in, secure the compound. I don\u2019t know where Gus is, I don\u2019t. Javier said he was being kept somewhere for future use. I don\u2019t know what that means. He\u2019s alive, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake me to Javier,\u201d I told him, pulling him off the door and jamming the gun into his lower back.</p><p>He looked over his shoulder. \u201cHe\u2019s in a firefight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said, \u201cDerek and Este are in a firefight. Javier is somewhere else, biding his time. Waiting for me. Take me to him. Now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, I have a wife and child,\u201d he pleaded.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t kill you if you do as I say,\u201d I told him, meaning it, too. I didn\u2019t want to kill Dom but I was realizing I was prepared to if absolutely necessary.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t but Javier will,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s your problem.\u201d</p><p>Another explosion rocked the house, this time from the opposite wing. We stumbled a bit and Dom went for his gun but I had my gun back on him in no time.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d I said. I nodded at the door I had broken into last night, the one leading to the backyard. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>I kicked open the door and hoped that Camden and my mother were somewhere safe. \u201cWho is setting off the explosions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDerek,\u201d he said. \u201cImprovised Explosive Devices.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he accidently kills Camden or my mother, everyone here dies, including you. Tell him to rein it in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t\u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re communicating to each other, do it now!\u201d</p><p>Dom sighed and pressed the Bluetooth device in his ear while I did a quick scan of the area. I could see the pool glistening in the distance, a single body floating in it. Several statues on the grounds were cracked or knocked over.</p><p>\u201cDerek,\u201d Dom said. \u201cStop the explosions and hold. Take out only Travis\u2019s men. If you see McQueen or any of the Watts, do not shoot, do not engage. We need them alive. Copy?\u201d</p><p>Dom nodded at whatever Derek said in his ear. \u201cOkay,\u201d he said to me. \u201cHe\u2019s been called off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucky you,\u201d I said. \u201cWhere\u2019s Javier?\u201d</p><p>His eyes darted to the pool house, a small cottage with a single darkened window that was open a crack. Just enough space for a gun to fit through. Of course.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not going to kill me, right?\u201d I asked Dom as I readied myself to run across the lawn.</p><p>\u201cJavier? No. We were ordered not to kill you or Camden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow nice. The bombs don\u2019t really help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t know where you were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, here I am.\u201d I looked around me then nodded at the cottage. \u201cI\u2019ll try and cover us.\u201d</p><p>We started running for it, both Dom and I running as fast as we could, knowing there was a lot of ground between the main house and the pool house. We were only a few yards away when bullets started whizzing past us.</p><p>I turned and looked up at the roof of the house to see a sniper up there, taking shots at us as we ran. I aimed both guns at the roof and fired.</p><p>My aim was terrible.</p><p>I didn\u2019t hit the sniper.</p><p>Instead, the sniper hit me.</p><p>My leg exploded in pain and I stumbled to the ground as the bullet seared through my calf. The cherry blossoms offered no defense.</p><p>I cried out, my gun falling away from my hands, and tried to crawl toward it. I barely managed to get it and quickly rolled on to my back aiming the gun at the roof when the sniper was hit before I could even pull the trigger. He stumbled backward and then slid off the room to his death on the hot patio below.</p><p>I turned around to look at Dom who had been brought down to the ground with me.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t moving.</p><p>A shadow appeared overhead. I looked up.</p><p>Javier was standing over me, blocking out the sun, a rifle in his hand.</p><p>\u201cIs Camden still alive?\u201d he asked me in a strangely hopeful voice, as if Camden mattered to him more at the moment than me.</p><p>I pointed my gun straight up at him, my hand shaking from the bursts of pain that rocked my body in pure agony.</p><p>\u201cYes. But you won\u2019t be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou going to pull the trigger, angel?\u201d he asked. \u201cAfter I just saved your life?\u201d</p><p>I grinded my teeth together in nauseating anger. \u201cYou lied to me. You lied to me.\u201d I tried in vain to keep my hand steady. \u201cYou lied about Gus.\u201d</p><p>He smiled, eyes glowing with madness. \u201cI did lie. You wouldn\u2019t have come here otherwise. You would have never fulfilled your destiny. To kill the man who ruined so many of our lives.\u201d</p><p>I was done. So fucking done.</p><p>\u201cTell me where Gus is or I\u2019ll blow your fucking brains out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have it in you, angel. You\u2019re too good for that now.\u201d</p><p>This was no longer a matter of good or bad.</p><p>This was all grey.</p><p>Hazy, fuzzy grey.</p><p>I squeezed the trigger.</p><p>The chamber clicked.</p><p>Loudly.</p><p>Empty.</p><p>And though Javier\u2019s face was shadowed from the sun, I saw something in his eyes that I had never seen before. Absolute disbelief. Absolute shock. Absolute ... fear.</p><p>And I felt relief that he was still standing there, alive. I did have it in me to kill him, that dark part of me that wanted him dead. But now I had nothing to regret.</p><p>I whimpered and rolled over, grasping my leg as another wave of pain rolled through while he stood there above me, in the middle of a firefight, absolutely dumbfounded by what had just happened.</p><p>Suddenly the ground around us erupted in another spray of bullets. I screamed and quickly rolled over, trying to get out of the way.</p><p>And Javier turned and ran back toward the pool house, toward safety, leaving me there on the grass, bleeding, while the bullets came closer.</p><p>Leaving me alone.</p><p>Leaving me to die.</p><p>I guess I had pulled the trigger first. The honeymoon really was over.</p><p>I rolled over onto my stomach, avoiding getting too close to Dom who lay dead beside me, and watched as he ran, wondering if there was a point in me crawling after him. I wondered how long I had before I died. I wondered if I\u2019d ever see Camden again. I wondered if my life made a difference to anyone out there.</p><p>I just wanted another chance at it.</p><p>Another chance to be me.</p><p>Scars and all.</p><p>And while I was lying on the grass, my leg bleeding out, soaking my jeans, I heard a few more pops of bullets go out.</p><p>Javier was running into the pool house when he was struck in the back. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I screamed bloody murder.</p><p>He fell down flat, legs sticking out of the door, motionless.</p><p>Javier.</p><p>Shot.</p> <p>Dead.</p><p>No.</p><p>No.</p><p>Not yet.</p><p>His legs twitched and he managed to pull himself into the pool house until I couldn\u2019t see him anymore.</p> <p>\u201cEllie Watt!\u201d a cold voice bellowed from across the lawn. I could barely tear my eyes away from where Javier had disappeared, fighting back a range of emotions I couldn\u2019t even pin down but I managed to turn my head. The voice had reached into me, holding me tight with an icy fist.</p><p>Travis was standing on the lawn where it met the edge of his patio, gun in hand.</p><p>In front of him was my mother and Camden on their knees with their hands behind their heads.</p><p>No.</p><p>Not this.</p><p>Not now.</p> <p>My heart couldn\u2019t take any more of this. Every part of me was shattered from leg to soul.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want from me?!\u201d I screamed at him. I grabbed my gun out of my boot and staggered to my feet, crying softly from the pain as I touched my right leg to the ground.</p><p>\u201cCome closer and we\u2019ll talk,\u201d Travis yelled back. \u201cYou might want to keep your gun down, though. You know you can\u2019t save both of them.\u201d</p><p>I sobbed in pain and anger and started limping toward him, practically dragging my bloodied leg behind me, gun at my side. Each step I took riddled with more pain, more sorrow, more hate toward this man who had taken everything away from me.</p><p>I wouldn\u2019t let him take Camden.</p><p>I wondered if he knew that would be my decision. He figured I came all this way for my mother when that wasn\u2019t the case at all. He was betting on me picking her, saving her.</p><p>I remembered when Derek had asked me what I would do if I had to save my mother, how I said I\u2019d have to let the situation dictate my choice.</p><p>I knew my choice back then and I knew it now.</p> <p>I stopped a few yards away and looked at Camden, at his beautiful soul in those blue eyes. We stared at each other locked, in our gaze, locked in love. He wouldn\u2019t want me to make this choice either. I could only hope he wouldn\u2019t make it for me.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t look as lovely as you did when you were Eleanor Willis,\u201d Travis said, smiling like the devil, his gun in the middle of the two of them but leaning more toward my mother.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t look so hot either,\u201d I retorted. His normally neat dark grey hair was messed up with pieces of plaster in it, his slick Italian suit covered in blood and tears, his terrible eyes red. \u201cYour age is showing.\u201d</p><p>He kept smiling and nodded at me. \u201cSorry about your leg. Hope it doesn\u2019t leave a scar.\u201d</p><p>I swallowed hard, overtaken by the anger and the pain and the determination to walk out of there with the love of my life. I chose love over everything.</p><p>Love over gold.</p><p>I raised my gun straight up in the air and pointed it at him. \u201cI hoped this doesn\u2019t either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou kill me, Ellie,\u201d he said quickly, a rare tremor coming through, \u201cyour mother dies.\u201d He trained the gun to the back of her head.</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t kill her,\u201d I said and though I wished it weren\u2019t true, I had to wish it was true. \u201cYou love her, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed. \u201cShe loved me enough to make up for it. You can\u2019t love in this business, Ellie. Sooner or later everyone dies.\u201d</p><p>Javier had said that to me. Now I didn\u2019t even know if he was alive or not.</p><p>\u201cThen why are we standing here like this,\u201d I said, hiding the weakness in my voice. \u201cDo you want me to come join you, is that it? Do you want me to be like my mother? The only reason she was with you is because she wanted to get revenge for what you did to me.\u201d I didn\u2019t even know if that was true but maybe it could knock his ego down a few.</p><p>He pressed his thin lips together and smiled. \u201cYou\u2019re here because I\u2019m humoring you. I\u2019ve got a sniper trained on your head right now. None of you are walking out of this alive. I just wanted you to see what love gets you in this world, in the real world. Death. You can escape love but you can\u2019t escape death. Not here. Not anywhere. And not right now.\u201d</p><p>This wouldn\u2019t be our fate.</p><p>\u201cAnd neither can you,\u201d I said, pulling the trigger.</p><p>It all happened so fast and so terrible.</p><p>The bullet went straight into Travis\u2019s forehead but not before he had the chance to pull the trigger on his own gun. My mother leaned to the side in anticipation and the bullet ended up striking her neck instead of her head. I immediately dropped to the ground as the sniper\u2019s bullets came out, Camden doing the same. I rolled over, getting as close to him as possible, not even feeling my leg anymore and aimed in the direction of the bullets.</p><p>There were two men on the roof now. One with the gun.</p><p>The other going behind him and snapping the man\u2019s neck with a quick twist of his hands.</p><p>The man fell down dead. The other man waved at us, just once, then started running down the roof until he was able to slip inside an open window on the second floor.</p><p>Derek.</p><p>\u201cEllie,\u201d Camden said, crawling to me, taking me into his arms. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head, words not coming, and immediately tried to get to my feet. I fell back down and then crawled over to my mother who was lying on the ground, making gurgling sounds from her throat.</p><p>\u201cMommy,\u201d I whimpered, trying to turn her over. Blood poured freely from the hole in the crook of her neck, soaking my hands. She was still breathing, weak and shallow. Her brown eyes blinked at the sun then slowly looked over at me, softening when she saw my face.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t stop the tears. I bawled, chest burning for air, and she reached for my hand and held it as strongly as she could. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I gasped. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEllie, sweetheart,\u201d she tried to say but could only cough.</p><p>\u201cI am so sorry,\u201d I cried again, shaking uncontrollably. \u201cI love you mommy, and I\u2019m sorry I\u2019m so sorry I did this.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head slightly. \u201cYou did nothing wrong,\u201d she croaked, her lips turning white. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. For everything I did to you.\u201d</p><p>Her lungs wheezed and she coughed again and I could feel Camden crouched beside me, a hand on my arm. He was going to tell me to go, that we had to leave but I couldn\u2019t leave her here, not dying like this.</p><p>She swallowed, a stream of blood coming out of the side of her mouth. \u201cI love you Ellie. Remember that.\u201d</p><p>In that moment I forgave her for everything. I only hoped she could forgive me. And that I could forgive myself.</p><p>And then, as I kissed her forehead, I heard her take in her last breath of air. My tears spilled onto her head and I slowly pulled away. She was lifeless, frozen, hopefully taken away somewhere where she could finally find happiness.</p><p>\u201cEllie,\u201d Camden said softly, sticking his shoulder under my arms and pulling me up to my feet. \u201cThe game is still in play and you\u2019re shot. We have to get out of here.\u201d</p><p>My heart was a stone, a brick, a mountain, weighing me to the ground. I looked at my mom, then over at the pool house, and I wondered how things went so wrong, so fast. They weren\u2019t the constants in my life and they weren\u2019t the good, but at least they weren\u2019t always the bad. Like me, they were grey and they shaded every step I\u2019d taken.</p><p>I moved like I was in a dream, the pain in my leg overshadowed by my sorrow. Camden helped me limp a few steps before he bent down and scooped me up into his arms, instructing me to put my hands around his neck. He ran forward but I stared backward until the bodies were further away.</p><p>\u201cYou two okay?\u201d Derek\u2019s voice broke through.</p><p>Camden stopped and I raised my head to look. Derek was standing at the corner of the house, a large gash across his face but otherwise all right. I wasn\u2019t sure if we could trust him but he did just take out the sniper for us. Then again, he was wearing a bulletproof vest.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s been shot,\u201d Camden said, his voice on the verge of panicking. \u201cIn her leg.\u201d</p><p>Derek gave it a quick glance and then looked at us gravely. In his vest, ammo and weapons, piercing blue eyes and shaved head, he looked like he was in his element. Nothing fazed him. This was routine.</p><p>\u201cI can help you,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you pay me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Camden exclaimed and his grip around me tightened.</p><p>Derek was motionless. \u201cI know where Gus is. I needed to know how much he meant to you, what you are willing to give, Ellie. I can take you to him. I can fix you. But you have to name your price.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFifty thousand,\u201d I said, knowing how much Javier had given Camden for me. I was sure, even in death, Javier wouldn\u2019t mind if it went to save my life. \u201cGive or take.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give you a break and let\u2019s call it thirty,\u201d Derek said. \u201cIt\u2019s still more than what Javier paid me to stick around and help take over this place.\u201d</p><p>The words were stuck in my throat but they managed to come out. \u201cHe\u2019s shot, you know. He\u2019s in the pool house.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI saw. I took out the original sniper as well. But whether he\u2019s alive or dead, he owns the Zetas now and they\u2019re coming. I did my job for him, now I want out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how are we getting out of here?\u201d Camden asked.</p><p>The tiniest hint of a smile appeared on Derek\u2019s lips. \u201cI learned to fly a few choppers in Afghany.\u201d</p><p>He jerked his head toward the landing pad.</p><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t we ... shouldn\u2019t we make sure Javier is okay,\u201d I said, knowing it wasn\u2019t the popular opinion.</p><p>Derek shook his head. \u201cWe don\u2019t have time. You have no idea what that man is capable of, do you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe knows,\u201d Camden said quickly. \u201cShe just has a big heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA big heart will get you killed. If Javier\u2019s alive, he\u2019s at the top of the food chain now. And we\u2019re all just chum.\u201d</p><p>I let that sink in and tried to forget the guilt. He had left me behind to die. I would have to try and do the same to him. And hope that if he did pull through, that he wouldn\u2019t come after me again.</p><p>Soon we were in the helicopter, Derek at the controls, Camden beside me in the back, ripping apart a first aid kit for pain medicine. I stared out the window as we rose from the ground and took off toward the horizon. We left my past, my broken, and sometimes beautiful, past behind me.</p><p>CHAPTER FOURTEEN</p><p>\u201cEllie, we\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>I moaned and opened my eyes and saw a repeating shadow crossing above my head. Chopper blades. I had that one sweet moment between sleep and waking when you think everything is fine.</p><p>Then I was slammed with unbearable pain. In my leg, where the bullet went in. And in my heart, where my mom and possibly Javier had died. Grief for people who perhaps didn\u2019t deserve grief but I was drowning in it all the same.</p><p>Camden was at my side, gently pressing his lips to my cheekbone.</p><p>I reached out and grabbed his strong face, needing to feel him, that he was here, alive. I had him. He had me.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we?\u201d I whispered, my voice dry.</p><p>He put his arm under my shoulder and gently lifted me up. He quickly unscrewed a bottle of water and poured some of it in my parched mouth. I was sitting in a field right beside the chopper. In the distance was the barn we had parked at and the black Escalade was coming out of it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s just Derek,\u201d Camden explained. \u201cWe\u2019re getting you to a doctor and then we\u2019re getting Gus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have to get Gus first,\u201d I said, grabbing his collar.</p><p>He gave me a steady gaze. \u201cNo, Ellie. Derek says Gus is safe. You can\u2019t save him if you\u2019re dead and I don\u2019t want you losing that pretty leg of yours either. It would be a shame to lose such art.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut who knows how much longer he\u2019ll be safe?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEllie,\u201d he said sadly. \u201cI couldn\u2019t save your mom, even though I tried. Travis found us before I could even get a few rounds off. But I can save you. I will save you. I promised I\u2019d keep you safe, even at the expense of Gus. You\u2019ve been shot. You\u2019re lucky to be alive and I\u2019ll do everything in me to keep you alive. No ifs, ands, or buts.\u201d</p><p>Derek pulled the car up to us and leaped out of the driver\u2019s seat, quickly ushering us into the back of the car.</p><p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t we take the helicopter?\u201d I asked as Camden lay me down in the back. My jeans had been torn off at the knees and mounds of bandages had been wrapped around my calf.</p><p>\u201cOut of gas,\u201d Derek said as he got back in the driver\u2019s seat. \u201cAnd the Zetas would be coming by copter anyway. This is safer.\u201d</p><p>He drove that Escalade like a rally driver, bounding us from rough road to rough road and after a few precarious turns on mountainsides, I wondered how much safer it could be.</p> <p>The pain was slowly growing worse too, to the point where I had a death grip on Camden\u2019s hand, body covered in sweat. It felt like my leg was on fire and stabbed with a million knives at the same time. It was all encompassing and all-consuming.</p><p>\u201cHow much longer?\u201d Camden asked Derek.</p><p>\u201cAn hour,\u201d Derek said. \u201cTops. I know a doctor right before the border into Guatemala.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHold on, baby,\u201d Camden said, squeezing my hand. \u201cI\u2019ve got you.\u201d</p><p>Even Camden couldn\u2019t save me from my agony. My eyes rolled back into my head and I tried to divert my attention from my leg. Questions. Painful questions. I had a lot of them. I had time to ask them.</p><p>\u201cDerek,\u201d I choked out. \u201cIf we\u2019re paying you for all this, questions are included right?\u201d</p> <p>Silence. Then, \u201cYes. What do you want to know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mother. The truth. What happened to her? How did she end up married to Travis?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe wasn\u2019t married. That\u2019s not how Javier put it.\u201d</p><p>Of course he knew.</p><p>He went on, \u201cJavier recruited your parents to work for him right after Travis went and switched sides. I heard from different sources that it was so Javier could have closer ties to you. I heard from Javier it\u2019s because they wanted revenge on Travis. They\u2019d stopped conning at this point and had their hands in a whole bunch of work from the cartels already, so it was not a big career change for them. Then one day they left and Javier tracked them down to Veracruz. To Travis. He was angry. That\u2019s where you came in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis angel of death,\u201d I muttered then groaned as another wave of pain went through me. \u201cWhy not kill them all with one stone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo his credit, Javier seemed shocked when he learned you were going to Travis\u2019s house back in Veracruz,\u201d Camden spoke up, surprising me. \u201cI don\u2019t think he meant for you to kill them all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does it matter?\u201d I snapped. \u201cI was being used, just like I was used here. Javier got his way, he got his wish. Even if he\u2019s dead, he\u2019s still won. My mother is dead. And so is Travis. And I killed them both.\u201d The tears teased me again, moisture swelling in my throat but I refused to give in. I grinded my teeth until my jaw was sore. \u201cI was the fool who did as he asked.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t say that,\u201d Camden said. \u201cYou didn\u2019t have a choice and you know it. You can grieve for your mother but I will not let you punish yourself for this. You don\u2019t deserve this burden. None of us deserve what went on in there.\u201d</p><p>The memory of the man dying by Camden\u2019s hands filled my head and I remembered I wasn\u2019t the only one who lost a piece of themselves back in the jungle.</p><p>\u201cThen why would my parents go to work for Travis? What happened then?\u201d I asked, wanting the distraction.</p><p>I saw Derek shrug. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>My mother had told me it was revenge. For me. I wanted to believe that now, though it didn\u2019t make things hurt any less.</p><p>\u201cAnd she never married Travis. Travis took her in because he was obsessed with her. Killed your father, kept her as his own. Kept her is the key word that was thrown around a lot. I can\u2019t say what went on. I don\u2019t know all the facts, I only know what I read and what I\u2019ve been told. I\u2019m guessing it was something like Stockholm syndrome. If they were ever officially married, I never heard about it. I just know it was a fucked-up, messy situation.\u201d</p><p>I had my fair share of that. I held Camden\u2019s hand tighter again and hoped that the Watt cycle of being sucked into co-dependent, obsessive and unhealthy relationships was finally over. As long as I had Camden, I had broken free of that. I wouldn\u2019t end up like her.</p><p>\u201cDid you know that Gus was my real father?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did,\u201d he answered simply. \u201cJavier was supposed to tell you, it was part of the plan. But he held off at the last minute. Maybe he was afraid that when the time came and you found out that he\u2019d tricked you after finding out the truth about Gus, you\u2019d come after him. I guess he was right about that, wasn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>Was he fucking ever.</p><p>\u201cSo what happens next?\u201d Camden asked. \u201cAfter we get Ellie fixed up and get Gus. What happens to us? And to you? How do we know you won\u2019t kill us or come after us?\u201d</p><p>Derek eyed him in the rear view mirror. \u201cBecause so far, that\u2019s not my job. And, believe it or not, it wouldn\u2019t become my job. I like you two. I fucking hate dealing with the cartels and yes I do it for a living but some jobs are better than others. I take what interests me and that\u2019s it. I want you to get to Gus and I want you to get home to California. Then I want to take a nice long week of drinking and fucking tourists on a beautiful beach.\u201d He paused and scrunched up his brows. \u201cI will say this to you, man. Camden. When we took off in the jungle that morning, I was certain we were only leaving Ellie behind. Javier wanted to take you with him. I told him not to, that it would slow down our operation. So he left you behind. He didn\u2019t want to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Camden scoffed. \u201cHe wanted to off me somewhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Derek told us. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t it. We all had specific instructions to keep both you and Ellie safe. But the emphasis was placed on you, Camden. You were the priority.\u201d</p><p>I coughed at the tickle in my throat and threw a bewildered look to Camden. \u201cWhat the hell does that mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no idea, honestly,\u201d Derek said. \u201cBut that\u2019s what we were told. There were too many other things to question than that.\u201d</p><p>Camden looked at me, lips pursed and I could tell he had no clue either.</p><p>The next couple of hours were a blur. Instead of some farmhouse like the one that Javier had taken Violetta to, Derek drove me to an honest-to-god medical clinic. It was after hours of course since gunshot wounds attracted at least some attention but the woman who ran the clinic was quick, silent and efficient. And by efficient, I mean she pumped me full of drugs until I couldn\u2019t tell what was up and what was down. Not quite morphine but something that made me stop wanting to chop off my leg.</p><p>She had no problems pulling out the bullet, least it didn\u2019t seem that way in my drugged up head and said I was lucky it didn\u2019t strike an artery. She gave Camden the medication, painkillers and antibiotics to fight infection, wrapped me up and I was somewhat good to go. Derek handed her a handsome wad of American bills for her effort.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Camden said as they put me back in the Escalade. \u201cNow we\u2019ve all been shot. You, me, Gus. Quite the team, right?\u201d</p><p>I jerked my head. \u201cWe\u2019ll be a team once we see him again. Derek, that\u2019s our next stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, m\u2019am,\u201d he said, seeming to lighten up a bit. \u201cBack to Mexico you go.\u201d</p><p>We drove through the night, passing through the Guatemalan and Mexican borders with ease. Now that my leg was fixed, we weren\u2019t attracting any suspicion. Just three gringos with Mexican plates. And even if they did search the car and found the guns and ammo we still had in here, Derek was ready to bribe them. Or take them out. Whichever came first.</p><p>Derek had told us that Javier kept Gus in the city of Oaxaca, a place we had already driven through on our way to Guatemala and Honduras. That fact made me rage inside, pushing away the euphoria that the drugs had laced my brain with. All this time I was wrong. All this time I was being led like a puppet on a barbed wire by Javier and Gus was alone somewhere, hurt, wondering if we\u2019d ever come for him. We had been so close, so damn close and I believed Javier. I fell for his lies time and time again.</p><p>At least I wouldn\u2019t fall for them anymore. My chest choked up with feelings of sorrow and fear. I didn\u2019t know if I could ever find peace knowing he was alive. I didn\u2019t know if I could ever be relieved knowing he was dead. There I was, still caught on the drifting cobwebs of the past.</p><p>It was the middle of the night when Derek pulled the Escalade into the suburbs of the city. Despite taking another dose of painkillers, I was wide awake, anxious to see Gus.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand why they even have Gus, though,\u201d I mused. \u201cLike, not that I wanted this to happen, obviously, but why didn\u2019t Javier just kill him? He must have told you why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Derek said. \u201cThough I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he had some affection for him. Maybe if you thought Gus was dead, you wouldn\u2019t go with Javier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, please,\u201d I said in disgust. \u201cLike I would have anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJavier is used to getting what he wants,\u201d he explained. \u201cI think in the end, he still wanted you.\u201d</p><p>Camden stiffened and I put my hand on his knee to comfort him. We road in silence for a few moments and I did my best not to dwell on Javier, how he could both still want me and be someone who would leave me behind to die.</p><p>How the hell did his love for me get so fucked-up?</p><p>\u201cAre you sure they\u2019ll let Gus go willingly,\u201d I asked Derek, shaking memories out of my head. \u201cI mean, you\u2019re not the one running this show.\u201d</p><p>He eyed me over his shoulder and gave me a handsome smirk. \u201cWho said anything about willingly? We\u2019re taking him whether they let us or not.\u201d</p><p>Oh great. Another one of these.</p><p>\u201cObviously you\u2019re staying in the car,\u201d Camden filled in beside me, stifling a yawn. \u201cYou\u2019re not going anywhere on that leg.\u201d</p><p>I cocked my head at him. \u201cOh really?\u201d</p><p>His eyes were serious in the darkness of the car. \u201cReally. Ellie. You need to stay safe. I\u2019ll get your father back.\u201d</p><p>Father.</p><p>My heart warmed.</p><p>And filled me with determination. I wasn\u2019t letting the men do this without me. Gus had come for me now I was going for him. After everything I\u2019d been through, I wasn\u2019t leaving without him, the only family I truly had left. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>We stopped on a quiet, wide road in the suburbs and Derek turned off the lights and the engine. He nodded at a house in the distance that had a few garbage cans knocked over in the front yard and a real estate sign. \u201cThat\u2019s the one. It\u2019s usually a stash house. Guess they\u2019re stashing people there now too.\u201d</p><p>He turned around in his seat and looked at Camden. \u201cWhat guns do you have?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone. I had to drop mine back at the compound.\u201d</p><p>Derek jerked his head to the back of the car. \u201cCome around back.\u201d</p> <p>Camden put his hand on my shoulder and applied light pressure. \u201cStay here, Ellie. Please.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t promise him anything. I just watched as he got out of the car and went to the back. The trunk opened and Derek started going through the guns that the team had left behind before we went traversing through the jungle. I watched them with curiosity as Derek handed Camden a shiny new 9mm and picked up a sawed-off shotgun for himself, his eyes glinting feverishly at the weapon in his hands. Derek was in his element once again. I only hoped it was enough to get Gus out of there in one piece.</p><p>Derek and Camden both shot me one last look before they closed the trunk.</p><p>\u201cBe right back,\u201d Derek said. Then they ran off toward the house, their feet quiet on the street.</p><p>I waited a few moments, watching them as they split up and disappeared around the back of the house. In my emotional, drug-infused state there was something supremely romantic about the sight of Camden running off with a gun to save my father.</p> <p>I still couldn\u2019t believe it. Gus was my father. I had to say it to myself again and again. It\u2019s not that it didn\u2019t feel true, it\u2019s just I had a hard time wrapping my head around what family meant.</p><p>Which, of course, is why I reached into the back and searched for a pistol until my hand closed around a .40 Glock. Gus and Camden were my family now and I had to protect them.</p><p>I opened the car door and climbed out, careful not to put any pressure on my bad leg, and limped swiftly and silently toward the house.</p><p>I turned at the neighbor\u2019s yard and hid behind one of the lemon trees, peering around the trunk at the stash house. The lights in the house were all off and I couldn\u2019t hear anything, not Camden or Derek, not Spanish. Just the sound of the breeze as it ruffled the leaves around me.</p><p>I took in a deep but shaky breath. The pain in my leg was starting to flare up again and I needed to push past it. I looked up at the second story of the house. Climbing was out of the question. Almost everything was out of the question.</p><p>That was until a light upstairs went on, streaming out the window between the cracks of a blackout curtain. In a stash house, its purpose wasn\u2019t to keep out the sun, but to keep eyes from looking in. That\u2019s where Gus had to be.</p> <p>Before I could even formulate a plan or try and figure out how far Camden and Derek had gotten, voices rang out into the humid night air.</p><p>Yelling.</p><p>Spanish and English.</p><p>Camden.</p><p>The curtain at the window moved.</p><p>Shots were fired, echoing down the street.</p><p>It was all happening so fast.</p><p>I jumped away from the tree, wincing at my leg, just as there was a terrific crash and a man fell from the window in a shower of glass and onto the lawn below, landing with a thud.</p> <p>Gus.</p><p>It was Gus.</p><p>I gasped, heart lodged at the back of my throat, and scampered over to him as quick as I could. Just before I reached him, I looked up at the window and saw a man with a gun pointed at him.</p><p>Not Camden. Not Derek.</p><p>And therefore he had to die.</p><p>I aimed just as the man spotted me and fired three times.</p><p>One of the bullets struck him in the chest, causing him to pitch back into the room.</p><p>I dropped to my good knee and rolled Gus over, holding my breath, holding onto every second that passed for fear of the next one.</p><p>He rolled onto his back. His eyes open. I hadn\u2019t seen those eyes in years.</p><p>He blinked once. Twice.</p><p>Looked at me, face scrunched up, all beard and grey hair and friendly eyes.</p><p>\u201cEllie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGus!\u201d I exclaimed.</p><p>He tried to sit up and then looked past me, his expression of terror. \u201cEllie!\u201d</p><p>I twisted at the waist, gun out and was about to shoot without even lining up.</p><p>I was lucky I didn\u2019t.</p><p>I would have shot Camden who was running up the side of the house toward me, weaponless.</p><p>He at least saw me and my gun clearly enough to drop to the ground and duck.</p><p>Leaving the man chasing him an easy target.</p><p>With Camden on the ground, I pulled the trigger and hit the man at the knees, bringing him down. He struggled, reaching for the gun that he dropped but I shot him in the head before he could even move.</p><p>I hated how easy this had become for me.</p><p>But then Camden lifted his head and gave me an incredulous look that said it all. That took my soul from black to grey.</p><p>\u201cI promised to keep you safe, too,\u201d I told him earnestly.</p><p>I turned back to Gus as Camden pulled me up to my feet. \u201cAre you hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m hurt,\u201d Gus said, grunting as Camden pulled him up next. \u201cBut I\u2019ll live.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Derek?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Camden shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t know. We have to go back to the car, now.\u201d</p><p>I looked back at the house and still heard yelling inside, the breaking of glass. There was still chaos. Still a fight and someone was losing.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t leave him behind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEllie,\u201d Camden said, sharp enough to make my head snap to him. \u201cWe have Gus. We have each other. We can\u2019t lose that. We have to go.\u201d</p><p>He was right. He was always right.</p><p>We took off running toward the Escalade, Camden supporting both me and Gus the best he could. Gus was bent over, the fall probably reopening the bullet wound in his stomach, wheezing for breath. It was so weird being with him now, knowing what he was to me. Did he know himself? I thought back to all our interactions over the years, the way he talked to me, kept in contact with me, watched over me. He must have known. All this time.</p><p>We got Gus in the back and I climbed in the front, just as Camden got behind the wheel and started to peel away. We drove past the house, an explosion now blasting open the front door in mess of flames, and it wasn\u2019t until we were zooming halfway down the street that Camden\u2019s eyes went to the rear view mirror.</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d he said.</p><p>As I turned to look, he popped the SUV in reverse and we started speeding backward toward a man running toward us, hell bent, Tom Cruise style.</p><p>Derek.</p><p>Camden screeched to a stop just before he collided into him and I leaned back to open the back door for him.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d he said as he jumped in beside Gus. His face was covered in a layer of soot, the gash on his face reopened and he smiled, widely, for the first time. \u201cThat was a rush.\u201d</p><p>Camden shook his head and pressed his foot to the pedal. We roared away from the fire and destruction and though Gus was hurt and I\u2019d been shot and Camden was missing his son, it felt good to have all three of them. They were my family. They were my home. And we were going to California.</p><p>CHAPTER FIFTEEN</p><p>We ended saying goodbye to Derek in Acapulco. Even though we felt a camaraderie with him after everything we went through, he still wanted his money. All the money we had was still in checks that we hadn\u2019t cashed yet, so we had to promise him an IOU through monthly PayPal installments. The funny part was that he trusted us to do so and I knew I would make good on my promise. Maybe I\u2019d picked a lot of locks in the last few days, but the scamming days were truly gone for me. I had the second chance I asked for.</p><p>After we dropped him off (and after he bought us all clean clothes from a local Wal-Mart), we continued on with the Escalade to Zihuatanejo, a beach town that Gus had always wanted to go to because Morgan Freeman ended up there at the end of The Shawshank Redemption. I\u2019d put fake plates on the Escalade back in Acapulco, knowing now that I could never ever be too careful again, though we planned to steal a new car once we were heading up to California. For now, we needed to catch our breaths and take stock in the fact that we were still alive.</p><p>The three of us were sitting on the patio of a restaurant that lined the silky sand beach, enjoying gigantic margaritas, when Camden got up to go to the washroom.</p><p>\u201cSo, Ellie,\u201d Gus said, sitting back in his chair with controlled movement. In the end, his gunshot wound was healing nicely. For whatever reason, Javier hadn\u2019t mistreated Gus. After he\u2019d been shot by Raul and after Camden came running for me, Javier took Gus immediately to a doctor who removed the bullet and stitched him up. Then Gus was knocked up full of roofies (Javier\u2019s drug of choice, it seemed) and the next thing he remembered was waking up in the stash house where he was guarded by three formidable men and two idiots (according to him). He wasn\u2019t allowed to leave the bedroom upstairs and was tethered to the first half of the room by a chain around his leg, thus not allowing him to reach the windows. He was permitted bathroom breaks though, he could watch TV and he ate whatever food the rest of his captors ate. He was more comfortable than I thought he would have been, certainly more than my mother was. If that was the way Javier treated the people he captured, he had shown he wasn\u2019t as much of an animal as Travis was.</p><p>Of course, he\u2019d shown he was an animal in so many other ways.</p><p>\u201cSo, Gus,\u201d I said, pulling my shades on to my head so I could look him in the eye, even though the sun was setting, causing the ocean to refract in beams of light.</p><p>He gave me a smile that could only be described as shy. And Gus was not a shy man. Suddenly I realized why Camden had excused himself with a knowing look on his face. Gus and I had not discussed what I learned yet. But I had a feeling it was about to come up.</p><p>It made me feel as awkward as a child. I rubbed my hands on my linen pants and smiled back.</p><p>He rubbed at his beard and said, \u201cI think you and I have something to ... talk about.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, waiting.</p><p>\u201cI know what your mother told you back at ... back where you saw her.\u201d</p><p>Oh god. Don\u2019t tell me he wasn\u2019t my father.</p><p>\u201cShe said that I\u2019m your dad,\u201d he went on. He picked up a chip from the tortilla basket and started spinning it around on the tablecloth. \u201cThat we had an affair before you were born.\u201d He looked up at me, his eyes sad.</p><p>Oh please no. Please don\u2019t take this away from me.</p><p>\u201cI loved your mother very much, Ellie,\u201d Gus said. \u201cI loved your father too. I never really understood how I could do that to my friend, but I did. And your mother stayed on my mind ever since. I was still allowed to see you from time to time. You remember me around. But I could never be your father. I hope I can be now.\u201d</p><p>I exhaled, smiling so wide that my face hurt. \u201cYou really are my father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was even a paternity test. Your father knew of course. He was a good man, Ellie, he really was. And I regret what I did but I don\u2019t regret the consequences.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sound a lot like Camden, there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCamden is a good man too. That boy, he\u2019s so in love with you that he can\u2019t even see straight. I can\u2019t even begin to tell you how hard he fought to get you back. He never gave up, even when he was knocked down. You were the most important thing in the world to him, you still are. I hope you can give your heart to him, I know how hard that is for you, to trust, to let go.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I gave him a reassuring smile, his words about Camden inflating me with joy. \u201cHe has my heart. He knows it. At least I hope he does. I\u2019ll keep giving it anyway. I love him.\u201d</p><p>I want to spend my whole life with him. I want to marry him, I thought. But of course I didn\u2019t say that.</p><p>He gave me a quick grin and stuffed a chip in his face, talking with his mouth full. \u201cGood. That\u2019s what I wanted to hear. The boy drove me nuts for most of the trip to be honest. He just wouldn\u2019t shut up about you. But he has moxie and I like that. You\u2019re both perfect for each other. And if he ever wants to become my son-in-law,\u201d he trailed off and looked over my shoulder. \u201cPerhaps I should shut my big mouth now.\u201d And in went another chip.</p><p>I turned in my seat to see Camden coming toward me. My god he was absolutely beautiful, knee-length cargo shorts, a wifebeater that showed off his muscles and colorful art, from wrist to collarbone. He still had a bandage over his gunshot wound on the shoulder and his face was marred by a few healing gashes but that only made him look more manly. That man would kill for me. He would die for me. And he would fuck me to death if I asked him.</p> <p>I was tempted. What a way to go.</p><p>He stopped above us and smiled, dimples and white teeth illuminating his face in the setting sun. \u201cI\u2019m not interrupting anything, am I?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head, eager for him to join us, especially after I knew that Gus approved of him. I mean, how couldn\u2019t he? This was a man I wanted to spend the rest of my life trying to make happy, trying to give him the life he deserved for the kind of good person he was.</p><p>Which is why I had to bring up a more serious topic, one we hadn\u2019t discussed yet.</p><p>\u201cSo, what\u2019s the plan after this,\u201d I broached slowly as Camden sat back down beside me. \u201cHow do we get back Ben?\u201d</p> <p>Camden straightened up at the mention of his son\u2019s name, his fingers gripping the end of the arm rests. He bit his lip, brows drawn together, and cast a furtive glance at Gus. Then he said, \u201cI don\u2019t know yet.\u201d</p><p>Gus tilted his head sympathetically. \u201cYou\u2019re still a wanted criminal in the USA. Maybe not as wanted as you were before. It\u2019s probably all blown over. But if you\u2019re ever caught by the police for something, you\u2019ll be in big shit. If you\u2019re ever recognized by anyone, you\u2019re in big shit. If Sophia ever sees you again ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in big shit,\u201d Camden filled in.</p><p>\u201cOr you\u2019re dead.\u201d Gus rested his elbows on the table and clasped his hands together. \u201cSo we have to do what we can to avoid that. You know this will be the hardest part, even harder than getting Ellie back. Sophia won\u2019t give you Ben. You\u2019ll never be able to get custody. You\u2019ll never be able to see him. You\u2019ll never get visitation rights. It\u2019s either you take him from her or leave him with her. There is no in between here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo grey,\u201d I whispered, a sinking feeling in my chest.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Gus said. \u201cNo grey. These aren\u2019t the choices you\u2019ll want to make but you\u2019ll have to make them. Can you go on your way and let Sophia have him?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo!\u201d Camden cried out, attracting a few looks from the patrons around us. He quickly shot them a sheepish look and then lowered his voice, shaking his head. \u201cNo. I can\u2019t. She wasn\u2019t a very good mother before. That\u2019s when all our problems started. When she was on drugs and never at home. Now I know she\u2019s involved with her brothers. She\u2019s part of that gang. Fuck, she used Ben, her son, our son, to lure me in, to get money, to hand me over to her brothers. They were going to kill me, in front of him if they could. It\u2019s made me sick every time I think about where he is right now, and what he\u2019s doing. I can\u2019t let him grow up in that life. I won\u2019t let that happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019ve made your choice,\u201d Gus told him solemnly. \u201cIf you can\u2019t let him stay with her, if you can\u2019t say goodbye to him, then you must take him. And we will help you. You can\u2019t do this on your own.\u201d</p><p>Camden put his head in his hands, his knee bouncing up and down.</p><p>\u201cBaby,\u201d I said softly, and put my hand on his jumping knee. \u201cYou\u2019re not doing this alone. Even if it seems impossible, even if it doesn\u2019t feel like a choice you want to make, you have to do this if you want him back. Ben deserves to be with you, Camden. Someone with a big heart, a father who will do anything for his child. That\u2019s what you are. You have that in you to give and Ben is a lucky boy that you\u2019re his dad. You\u2019re giving him the future he needs.\u201d</p><p>Camden turned his head to the side, glancing at me with damp eyes. \u201cAnd you\u2019re the future I need.\u201d</p><p>I leaned over and kissed him, sweetly, slowly, then blushed once Gus cleared his throat, reminding us he was there.</p><p>I pulled back, smiling to myself and had a good long sip of the margarita, gazing out at the ocean. I wondered if Camden still wanted to go to Gualala, that beach town he dreamed of, his personal paradise. I wondered if I was his future, if that\u2019s where we could build a home, build a life. Me, him and Ben. Gus too. And maybe, just maybe, a child of our own.</p><p>I was getting ahead of myself \u2013 wasn\u2019t I? \u2013 and Camden sighed, bringing my focus back to the problem at hand. If Ben was in our future, how did we get him?</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s just that kidnapping a child,\u201d Camden murmured, voice barely audible, \u201cI can\u2019t imagine how I\u2019d live with that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re doing it for the right reasons,\u201d I said. \u201cThat\u2019s how.\u201d</p><p>His knee started bouncing again. \u201cBut how do we pull it off without hurting Ben?\u201d</p><p>That was the problem. I licked the salt off my lips and sat back in my chair, thinking. \u201cBen knows you\u2019re his father. Right?\u201d He nodded. I went on, \u201cHe trusts you then. He\u2019s young. Kids are impressionable. I couldn\u2019t tell you the things that were probably done to me when I was young, the ways I was used for bait, to con people, to steal, and I don\u2019t even remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t be easy but Ellie\u2019s right,\u201d Gus said. \u201cObviously we don\u2019t want to make a scene or do anything that would endanger or mentally damage the boy. But I think if we take him, in the right way, and if you can find a way to face your guilt that I have no doubt you\u2019ll feel for some time, he can grow up with no damage. He\u2019ll be resilient. And he\u2019ll have the life he needs.\u201d</p><p>Camden looks up, face newly determined. \u201cSo when do we do this?\u201d</p><p>Gus scratched at his mustache. \u201cWe find Sophia. We stake out her place. We start planning our moves. The three of us, we can do this together. We can do it quickly. No fuss. In and out. It might take a few weeks for everything to roll into place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have a few weeks,\u201d Camden moaned.</p><p>\u201cCamden,\u201d Gus said sternly. \u201cYou have a few weeks. A few weeks is nothing compared to a lifetime of being together \u2013 or not being together. My god, you and Ellie are both as impatient as Chihuahuas. No wonder you belong together.\u201d</p><p>Camden and I exchanged a coy look. We did belong together. We all did.</p><p>Once dinner was over, we made our way back to the small hotel we were staying at, right on the beach. Gus retired to his room, said he wanted to continue watching this Telemundo show he got hooked on when he was being held hostage, and Camden grabbed my hand, leading me to the sand and crashing waves. The moon was in a perfect quarter, its reflection shining on the black-blue water.</p><p>He brought me to the ocean\u2019s edge and stood behind me, wrapping his warm arms around me.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d he whispered in my ear. \u201cEvery minute that goes by, you fill my heart. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do without you, Ellie. I\u2019ve been so close to losing you.\u201d</p><p>I gripped his hands over my stomach and leaned back into him, my head settling into the crook of his arms, and let that beautifully light feeling sink into me. \u201cI love you. You have me. I think, deep down, you always did, even when I didn\u2019t know it.\u201d</p><p>We stood like that for quite some time, our feet in the cool, soft sand, just watching the waves crash, the stars shining, the moon so far, so close, so constant. Every night it appeared, no matter where in the world we were, even hidden by clouds, it was still there.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re my moon,\u201d I said quietly.</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019re my earth.\u201d</p><p>He turned me around, ever so mindful of my leg, and kissed me deeply. It was a kiss that reached right into you, stirred you around until you were effervescent and sparkling and deliriously happy. It was soft, warm lips and silken, skilled tongue. It made you hungry and thirsty and longing for more, for it to go on forever, satisfying yet insatiable. It turned me on, flipped the switch, awakened the passion that wouldn\u2019t stop until we could fully devour each other. It was a kiss of the earth and the moon, all gravity and pull, a prelude to many forevers.</p><p>I don\u2019t know how long we made out like that, just feeding from the love and the lust that we could only consume from one another, me surrendering in his arms, his arms that kept me close and kept me safe. Finally he pulled away and rubbed his thumb over my lips.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d suggest sex on the beach,\u201d he said, his voice husky, my mouth feeling empty without his. \u201cBut I think the two of us deserve a bed for once.\u201d</p><p>That, and sex on the beach was highly overrated.</p><p>He bent down and picked me up in his arms. I let out a small laugh, wrapping my arms around his neck and burying my face below his ear. I breathed in his smell, absolutely intoxicating, and let him carry me all the way to our hotel room where he lay me down on the white, shabby-chic bedspread.</p><p>This was the first time we\u2019d really been alone, been intimate, since we left the compound. I had something to tell him, but I wasn\u2019t quite sure how to phrase it. I loved him beyond all doubt and I knew the man loved me. I knew we were the moon and the earth and each other\u2019s future, revolving and evolving. But I was still scared to tell him what I knew, tell him what I wanted.</p><p>He bent over me, hands at the drawstring on my pants, but I pushed him back, hand on his chest and said, \u201cI\u2019m always getting naked first. Drop your clothes.\u201d</p><p>Camden grinned wickedly and I bit my lip in anticipation, leaning back on my elbows to watch.</p><p>He took off his wifebeater first, the tats on his stomach and chest now on full display, then slowly started to unbutton his shorts.</p><p>\u201cAre you doing a striptease?\u201d I asked playfully.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m stripping and I\u2019m teasing,\u201d he answered as he very deliberately rolled the zipper down before looping his thumbs on the waistband and inching them off. Bit by bit, until the ink faded into the hard Vs of hip bones and I saw the hard, glistening tip of his erection appear, flush to his pelvis.</p><p>He let the shorts drop and he took my breath away.</p><p>\u201cDerek never got me any briefs,\u201d he explained, as if I cared that he was going commando. Fuck me, he was a man who would never stop giving me the chills. I\u2019d never seen a cock so large and beautiful as the one on Camden McQueen. My man. My moon. My everything.</p><p>He slowly walked toward the bed, growing larger as he came closer, so tall, so strong, so ready for me. His eyes held assurance and lust, drive and desire. He knew what he looked like, he knew what he was offering me, his perfect body and his perfect soul. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhen I saw you, I fell in love,\u201d he said to me as I lay back against the bed and he crawled on top of me on all fours. \u201cAnd you smiled because you knew.\u201d</p><p>I grinned lazily as he bent down and slowly kissed along my neck. \u201cQuoting Shakespeare, now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf only Juliet had been a scowly faced teenager,\u201d he murmured against my neck. \u201cBecause while I\u2019m pretty sure you knew I loved you, I don\u2019t think it made you smile.\u201d</p><p>I jerked my head away from him and held his face in my hands. \u201cCamden. You always made me smile, even when I didn\u2019t show it. You were my only friend and I was too young to know what your heart was worth.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd you know now.\u201d</p><p>I ran my hands through his thick hair. \u201cI knew then, now and always.\u201d I pulled his face to mine and kissed him softly before looking deep and hard into his eyes, trying to figure out how to say this. \u201cCamden ... I was on the pill until, well, until we left Veracruz. I\u2019ve only been with you since.\u201d</p><p>He frowned, a look of wonderment and fear in his eyes. \u201cAre you pregnant?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cNo. I don\u2019t think so. I\u2019m just ...\u201d I chewed on my lip. \u201cI\u2019m just thinking ... I don\u2019t want to go back on them.\u201d There. I said it. The weight of it all hung in the room.</p><p>He blinked, his dark brow still furrowed, and suddenly I was unbearably frightened that I had scared him off. My heart felt like lead.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I said quickly. \u201cI\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want a baby?\u201d he asked gently. His face was softening, his eyes searching mine, pulling truth from me.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mean right now,\u201d I managed to say. \u201cOr maybe I do. But yes. With you. I want a family of my own. To start new. To give us both what we never had.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Ellie,\u201d he whispered. His face crumpled slightly and he brought it to my neck. He whispered into my ear, \u201cOh, Ellie. I will give you that. It\u2019s all I\u2019ve ever wanted for us. It\u2019s all I\u2019ve ever wanted.\u201d</p><p>And suddenly I was all love.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I asked.</p> <p>He looked at me, glassy-eyed, and grinned so wide, so amazing. \u201cReally. A brother or sister for Ben.\u201d He swallowed loudly, taking a moment to contain himself. \u201cMy beautiful Ellie, I want this. I want this. We need this.\u201d</p><p>He reached down and slowly unbuttoned my blouse until my breasts were bare and spread before him - he wasn\u2019t the only one going commando. He trailed his fingers over my flesh, goosebumps rising in his wake, and tugged lightly at my nipple ring. I groaned and arched my back, offering myself to him, needing more.</p><p>But he wasn\u2019t in a hurry, not tonight. He slowly made his way from my breasts to my abdomen, kissing and licking over my stomach, concentrating his mouth there as if willing his seed to be planted. He finished untying my pants and cautiously pulled them off, taking it slow around my leg.</p><p>\u201cDoes this hurt?\u201d he whispered as he held my damaged leg in his hand, his eyes roaming all over my naked body.</p><p>I shook my head no. \u201cNot right now.\u201d</p><p>He peered at the bandages. \u201cOnce these come off, once it heals, I\u2019ll make you beautiful again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou already made me beautiful, Camden,\u201d I whispered. \u201cNow get your head between my legs.\u201d</p><p>His dimples appeared. \u201cAs you wish.\u201d</p> <p>He parted my legs and started moving his mouth up my inner thigh until he was teasing my lips. Once his tongue found my clit, needy and full, he spent no time getting me off. I grabbed his hair, yanking on it with each wave of orgasm as he moaned into me, the vibrations bringing me to new heights.</p><p>When I was coming back down, he looked up at me with his glistening mouth and a devious glint in his eyes. \u201cYou know that\u2019s not how we\u2019re supposed to make a baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen show me.\u201d</p><p>He came back on top of me and poised his stiff cock into me, entering slowly, very slowly.</p><p>Torturously slow.</p><p>\u201cCamden,\u201d I whispered, my body bucking for him. \u201cFaster.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in no rush,\u201d he purred. \u201cI want to live in every inch of you.\u201d</p><p>He pushed in and out, silky smooth with just enough friction. I watched him as his wide chest overpowered me, straining with each controlled movement. He looked up at the ceiling and groaned loudly as he pushed through, then looked down at me with heavy eyes, his mouth open in lust. His gaze undid me, so much passion and love, now more than ever.</p><p>He picked up the pace, wrapping one of his large hands around my waist while the other began stroking at my clit again. Each thrust became harder, deeper, until he was buried far inside of me. His breath hitched as he said, \u201cI want to put a baby in you. I want this. Oh, I want this.\u201d He moaned again and I joined in, my nerves white hot and begging for release. Blood was pooling deep in my core, the pressure building. This was love-making, baby-making, an act of creation and pure, raw, primal power.</p><p>We elapsed into a steady rhythm, the headboard slamming against the wall, the paintings rattling, sweat streaming off each other\u2019s bodies in the hot, tropical night. I was wet, so wet, and blossoming for him, driven by his mass, stretched by his fullness. I was fulfilled and yearning all at once, and I watched as his slick cock slid in and out of me, watched his whole body as he drove in deeper and deeper until I thought I was being staked to the bed.</p><p>\u201cOh fuck!\u201d I cried out, taken by surprise and coming fast and hard. I dug my nails into the back of his shoulders, my hips rocking in unison with his.</p><p>He came too, floored by his orgasm and I felt higher than the clouds as he poured his seed inside of me, my convulsions bringing it out of him and harboring it deep inside. He swore amidst his groans, his thrusts slowing down, until he lay down on top of me and kept himself inside me.</p><p>He brushed the hair off my face, gently running his fingers over my cheeks. He cleared his throat and smiled, sated, happy. \u201cYou know, if that didn\u2019t take, I am game for trying every day. Several times a day. On the hour.\u201d</p><p>I grinned and pressed him close to me. \u201cDon\u2019t think I won\u2019t hold you to that. I\u2019m addicted to you. I must have my fix.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs fix another term for cock?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is for yours. You should have a warning label on that thing.\u201d</p><p>He let out a small laugh, his lips tickling my collarbone. \u201cEh, it\u2019ll probably rub off anyway from all the use.\u201d</p><p>I sighed contently and wrapped my arms around him. He made beautiful sense out of all the ugly things I had done.</p><p>We fell asleep like that.</p><p>CHAPTER SIXTEEN</p><p>It was almost sad when we finally bid adios to Mexico. We ended up spending a few more days in the country, just lying on the beach and trying to get our lives back on track, to remember how to be real people in normal situations. The only problem was, the stint in Zihuatenejo was just a vacation, just a blip of normalcy before we had to delve back into things we didn\u2019t want to do.</p><p>None of us wanted to take Ben like that. If there was any other way, we would have taken it. But Gus was right \u2013 either Camden would never see his son again or this was his only choice. And in any other mother\u2019s arms, Camden would have probably let that happen.</p><p>Not with Sophia.</p><p>And it was she who was on our lips as we drove up the country and back into California. The border officials were a little suspicious of the three of us, but our passports all went through with flying colors and when they searched our vehicle \u2013 thoroughly, I might add \u2013 they didn\u2019t find anything. We had ditched every weapon from the car in a gully outside of Tijuana. We were clean.</p><p>\u201cSo where\u2019s the first stop for our new lives?\u201d I asked as we drove through San Diego. I felt so much safer being back in America, back on my home turf, but I wouldn\u2019t dare let myself relax. Not yet. \u201cDo we need to be close to Sophia?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need to find out if Sophia is still living where she was,\u201d Gus said from the front seat. \u201cWe can use my place as a home base. I have a friend with a house up the street from me who rents it out on a weekly basis.\u201d He looked over his shoulder at me. \u201cNot that I don\u2019t want you two in my house, but you know, just having the one bedroom and all it might be a little awkward.\u201d</p><p>And loud, I thought as I felt the heat creeping on my cheeks. Just the other night someone in an adjacent room complained about how loud our sex had been. Loud and frequent. Damn prudes.</p><p>Camden winked at me in the mirror and we drove on until we ended up at the beautiful enclave of Pismo Beach. After Gus set things up with his friend and the house, which was a bit too large for the two of us but at least it was available, Camden and I headed to Target to stock up on all things wonderful and American. We had to get through the tough part first but we were still at the start of our new lives together. I even paused at the baby section, picking up an adorable tiny tee-shirt that said The Cramps on it.</p><p>\u201cLook!\u201d I exclaimed, shoving it in Camden\u2019s face. \u201cYour favorite band.\u201d</p><p>He grinned and raised an eyebrow. \u201cWhat if she\u2019s a girl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike hell our daughter wouldn\u2019t be a fucking rocker chick.\u201d I threw it in the basket. \u201cI don\u2019t care if I\u2019m jinxing it, we\u2019re buying it.\u201d</p><p>He pushed the cart along gleefully and I was hit with a sudden wham of pain. Not for my leg, no that was much better. I remembered what happened the last time I thought I was pregnant, all those years ago with Javier. I jinxed it then.</p><p>Even saying his name in my head put shivers down my spine and caused me to look around uneasily. Even though I had gotten prematurely excited with him, it wasn\u2019t going to stop me from getting excited with Camden. Camden gave me hope and I was hopeful. He gave me strength and I was strong. We would be together. This all would work out. After everything we\u2019d been through, it had to.</p><p>\u201cYou okay, baby?\u201d he asked me, putting his arm around my waist.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good. Just ... wary, I guess.\u201d</p><p>He was being a bit on edge too, constantly worrying that someone was going to recognize him. Ever since we had come back into the country and had done a quick search of papers and the internet, the whole \u201cCamden McQueen is Wanted\u201d thing was pretty much gone. There were far worse people out there to report, including rumors of cartels coming across the borders and the Mexican Drug War flaring up on American soil, fighting for possession of local gangs and marijuana growers. It was only a matter of time before the war would come north, the papers would report, after a car exploded in San Diego the previous week. Funny how what we were experiencing south of the border was going on right here in our own backyards. Or at least the ghettos, as it seemed to be.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think that feeling will be going away anytime soon,\u201d he told me with a sigh. \u201cBut at least we\u2019re working on it, right?\u201d</p><p>I nodded and leaned into him and continued our shopping like any other twenty-something couple who was about to move in together for the first time would do.</p><p>When we got back to our furnished house \u2013 two stories overlooking the ocean AND it had a lap pool \u2013 Gus came over and we sat on the upper balcony with two of his computers and started mapping out the plan. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Our first step was to figure out where Sophia lived. The three of us would head into Silverlake and see if she was still at her old apartment. If she was, that made our plan a lot simpler. If she wasn\u2019t, well then we had some digging to do.</p><p>\u201cIf she\u2019s still in the LA area,\u201d Gus said, typing in his computer, \u201cwe could at least find out where she works. She was still working as an esthetician, hey Camden?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged with one shoulder. \u201cAs far as I know. She\u2019d definitely have to be working. I think that was part of the reason why they tried to get the money from me. She wouldn\u2019t have to work anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s if her brothers were even thinking of sharing the money with her,\u201d I pointed my pen at him as I jotted things down on my notepad. \u201cYou don\u2019t know how close she is with them, really, I mean how deep into the gang she goes. Is she just a pawn getting a small cut or does she have a larger stake in these things.\u201d</p> <p>He sighed and took off his glasses, rubbing the lens against his shoulder. He had found sexy nerd glasses at Target and had the prescription put into them in no time. He still looked hot as fuck to me \u2013 the glasses and tats were a delicious combination \u2013 but I did miss his eyes a bit.</p><p>\u201cI honestly have no idea anymore,\u201d he said dejectedly, slipping his glasses back on. \u201cYour guess is as good as mine.\u201d</p><p>I gave him a wistful look. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. We\u2019ll find her if we can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd we just did,\u201d Gus announced triumphantly, turning the screen of his laptop to us so we could see. There was a spa in Burbank that said Sophia Madano worked there as one of the skin techs.</p><p>Gus picked up his cell phone and handed it to me. \u201cWant to call and make an appointment? What\u2019s your name again?\u201d</p> <p>I took it from him and cleared my throat, not happy about being someone else again. \u201cI can be Elizabeth Waters.\u201d I dialed the number on the screen and waited for it to pick up. A woman with a thick Asian accent answered. I asked to make an appointment tomorrow, saying I had a woman give me a facial once, pretty, tiny with long brown hair.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Sophia,\u201d the woman on the phone said. \u201cTomorrow at two okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfect,\u201d I said, giving her my fake name. I hung up, my chest crawling with nerves already. I gave the phone back to Gus and wiggled my lips. \u201cI guess Elizabeth has a meeting with Sophia tomorrow. Hope she doesn\u2019t recognize me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRed wig, green contacts,\u201d Camden suggested. \u201cI doubt she would, she only saw you from afar.\u201d</p><p>I let out a shaky breath and folded my hands on the table. \u201cAll right. Then what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTalk to her, find out where she lives,\u201d Gus suggested.</p> <p>\u201cI might sound like a creeper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a con artist, Ellie,\u201d Gus said.</p><p>I frowned at that. \u201cWas.\u201d</p><p>He rolled his eyes and ran his fingers over the brackets that lined his mouth. \u201cRegardless of whether you were or still are, you know what you\u2019re doing. Have some confidence in yourself for fuck\u2019s sake and stop beating yourself up over this shit. You\u2019ve done all of this before. Act the part, gather the intel, report back to us. We\u2019ll tail her, scope out the scene. Then move on to the second part of the plan.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s too bad the first part of the plan relied entirely upon me. After everything I\u2019d gone through, it was odd that I was suddenly so afraid of having to go through with this, something that was quite simple. I guess after so many close calls and being placed in the line of fire, I was scared to death that something would go wrong again and everything I\u2019d gained would be taken away.</p><p>Later that evening we went for a drive, heading into LA and the area of Silverlake looking for Sophia\u2019s old place. The apartment was occupied and we spent a few hours outside of it, doing surveillance. Camden had a hunch that Sophia wasn\u2019t there anymore because the window shades were a different color and there was a doormat outside the door that wasn\u2019t there before. His suspicion was confirmed when someone stepped outside to have a cigarette: an elderly man, stooped over. Seconds later an old woman came out and yelled at him to come back inside. Definitely not Sophia.</p><p>The next morning I was frazzled, having tossed and turned all night. I wasn\u2019t even in the mood for morning sex. At first, anyway, but it\u2019s hard to say no to a cock belonging to 6\u20192\u201d of toned muscle. I honestly didn\u2019t know how I was going to pull this off with Sophia. I had no problems lying to her and pretending to be a redhead called Elizabeth but I knew I\u2019d have problems with trying not to shank her.</p><p>We had rented a car for the occasion, under my fake name so it was ironically legit, and I drove out toward Burbank with Gus and Camden in their rental car not too far behind. I had a Mini Cooper because that\u2019s just how I rolled while they opted for a Honda Civic, fast enough but nondescript. I pulled up the Mini Cooper in the parking lot of a strip mall with its shitty-looking Chinese buffet next to the \u201cspa\u201d and spent longer than I should have sitting there and trying to control my breathing. I eyed myself in the mirror. The red wig I had on was real hair and fit me like a glove, flowing nicely over my shoulders. It didn\u2019t look sex kitteny, it just looked normal, even up close. It was quite obvious I was wearing contacts though, but the natural green color worked well with my skin tone. I could pass for Elizabeth, I could pass for Elizabeth, I could pass for Elizabeth.</p> <p>I wasn\u2019t Ellie Watt.</p><p>I wouldn\u2019t kill Sophia.</p><p>I inhaled until my lungs felt like they were going to burst and got out of the car. I was wearing a black pantsuit, sleek and professional. I worked in accounting for an advertising firm. I had my fake business card in my Marc by Marc Jacobs bag we got from Nordstrom Rack. Elizabeth Waters. Single. Twenty-seven years old. Testing out a Mini because I want to buy one but now was afraid the red color clashed with my hair. Loves getting her pores cleaned.</p><p>I wouldn\u2019t kill Sophia.</p><p>I gathered my courage and walked over to the door and strolled inside like this was my weekly treat. The bell rang overhead and I was met with unflattering fluorescent lighting and a woman at the counter who was snapping gum. It was a busy place, with the manicures and pedicures at the front, Vietnamese women attacking feet and hands while chatting with each other. The rest of the treatments seemed to be in the back in dentist-like chairs.</p><p>\u201cCan I help you?\u201d the girl at the counter asked, her hair looking like it got dipped in Pepto Bismol.</p><p>I tried to keep my voice down, not wanting Sophia to hear me and see me before I saw her. \u201cI\u2019ve got a two pm appointment with Sophia.\u201d</p><p>The girl eyed the computer and nodded, snapping her gum again, before yelling \u201cSophia!\u201d Then she pointed at the end of the room. \u201cShe\u2019s right there.\u201d</p><p>I slowly turned and looked. Sophia was walking toward me, a completely blas\u00e9 look in her eyes. She looked tired but still pretty, a tiny woman with mad curves, her brown hair pulled back off her face so it showed off her aristocratic nose and red pouty lips. She barely smiled, barely acknowledged me.</p><p>Which was actually a good thing. But I was so close to grabbing her by the throat and asking if she knew who I was, if she knew what she\u2019d done, if she realized how fucking screwed she was going to get.</p><p>I didn\u2019t, though. I just gave her a smile and said, \u201cHi, I\u2019m Elizabeth,\u201d and extended my hand.</p><p>She looked at it, looked at me, gave me a nod and said, \u201cRight this way.\u201d</p><p>Bitch.</p><p>I followed her over to the station and she instructed me to take off my suit jacket and put my bag on the ground. I lay back in the chair and she asked me what I wanted.</p><p>Oh, I had so many answers to that.</p><p>None were appropriate.</p><p>I told her I wanted my pores squeaky clean and to look fresh. I had a date on the weekend. With a really hot guy.</p><p>With glasses, covered in tattoos, I thought, a real fucking work of art, a tortured soul with a heart of gold, who fucks like an animal and will love me till my dying day.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t help but smile at my thoughts, at the truth, and lo and behold, she smiled back.</p><p>\u201cHot guy?\u201d she asked. \u201cThat sounds nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I bet you have tons of hot guys,\u201d I said, my mouth snaking upward.</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d she asked and then quickly rubbed the tip of her nose, sniffing. I bet she didn\u2019t have a cold. \u201cNo, most of the guys I go out with aren\u2019t very hot.\u201d She laughed awkwardly.</p><p>No, most drug dealers aren\u2019t very hot, I thought.</p><p>\u201cMaybe it\u2019s the area,\u201d I tried, fishing for info. \u201cBurbank. Too many actors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no, I live in Pasadena,\u201d she said. \u201cToo many married men.\u201d</p><p>I smiled. \u201cWell that doesn\u2019t help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd they never leave their wives for me,\u201d she continued with a non-committal shrug.</p><p>I kept smiling, thinking she was kidding. But she wasn\u2019t.</p><p>I had to play it cool.</p><p>I swallowed down my rage and took a deep breath.</p><p>\u201cNervous?\u201d she asked me. She was more astute than I thought.</p><p>\u201cYeah, just thinking about the date,\u201d I said, covering up.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the guy\u2019s name?\u201d</p><p>Camden McQueen. Camden McQueen. Camden McQueen.</p><p>The words were dying to come out of my mouth, just to see the look on her face but I reeled them in and said, \u201cDerek.\u201d</p><p>Hey, why not.</p><p>\u201cHot name,\u201d she said, and then she turned her back to me and started making preparations.</p><p>The thing I learned about Sophia over the next hour was that she never once mentioned her son, even when I started babbling to her about being single and wanting children and how was I going to balance working at the advertising firm with a child. She didn\u2019t offer anything about Ben.</p><p>Not until the end.</p><p>She was slapping moisturizer on my face, hurrying because I could tell her next client had arrived and she said, \u201cWell I hope your date goes well this weekend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I told her, swinging my legs over the side.</p><p>She picked up my bag from the ground and got my jacket from the hook. As I slipped the jacket on over my blouse, she gave me a dry smile and said, \u201cListen, about the kid thing. Don\u2019t bother. They always seem like a good idea at the time but they\u2019ll fuck up your life.\u201d</p><p>I knew my jaw had dropped open. I couldn\u2019t help it.</p><p>She smiled coldly. \u201cI\u2019m serious. I wish someone had told me that back in the day. So enjoy your hot man. Just make sure you use a condom.\u201d</p><p>I closed my mouth and swallowed hard, feeling angry and flustered and shocked all at once.</p><p>She motioned for me to go to the counter and then waved over the next woman, someone who was obviously a regular. I moved over to the cashier in a daze.</p><p>Had she seriously just told me that?</p><p>That definitely didn\u2019t help sway my desire to shank her.</p><p>And it definitely made me more determined than ever to get Ben far, far away.</p><p>I paid for the treatment \u2013 leaving her a shitty tip that had the clerk eyeing me like I was nuts \u2013 and then high-tailed it out of there. I got in the Mini Cooper and drove home, my hands kneading the steering wheel through miles and miles of heavy traffic. I knew Camden and Gus were waiting nearby the salon to tail her when she went home for the evening. I quickly gave them a call, relaying the information that I picked up but left out that last part. Camden didn\u2019t need any more ammo, and if he did, well then I would give it to him. For now, he needed to keep his head clear and his emotions under control. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I got home, poured myself a glass of wine and waited for my men to get home. Then I poured myself another glass of wine and waited some more.</p><p>Here\u2019s the thing about being alone.</p><p>You\u2019re not.</p><p>You have your demons with you.</p> <p>Sitting in that house, the house that wasn\u2019t mine, with the furniture that wasn\u2019t mine, and the red wig splayed across the kitchen table, was the first time I\u2019d been alone in what felt like a long time. There was the time in the jungle before I found Camden, but that was no time to reflect or think.</p><p>Now I truly was alone.</p><p>And it was terrifying.</p><p>Not only being in a large and still unfamiliar house with unfamiliar sounds.</p><p>And not because I still had this undercurrent of paranoia at the back of my head, this feeling of dread that followed me around in this bright Californian sunshine.</p> <p>But because I was alone with my thoughts.</p><p>Alone with my guilt.</p><p>Alone with the knowledge of the things I\u2019d done.</p><p>The people I\u2019d killed.</p><p>So many sins.</p><p>I put my head on the table and cried. I cried for my mother, for the father I knew and lost, for Violetta, I even cried for Javier. I cried for the men I shot, in self-defense or self-preservation. I cried for the people I\u2019d stolen from, robbed, conned, lied to. I cried for everyone who ever had to meet me.</p> <p>Everyone except Travis.</p><p>For him I felt nothing at all, a stone where my heart should be.</p><p>I cried until Camden and Gus eventually came home and found me a blubbering, tear-streaked mess who\u2019d drunk an entire bottle of wine. Camden picked me up in his arms and brought me to bed where he stayed with me until morning.</p><p>Then the sun rose and his lips lightened my soul and his heart set me free.</p><p>And I was able to move on.</p><p>CHAPTER SEVENTEEN</p><p>While I was busy having my pity-party at home, Camden and Gus had stayed out until just after Sophia\u2019s work closed. She got into a Prelude, newer model, and drove on the 134 until she got to Pasadena, Camden and Gus following her the whole time, two cars behind. From the way Camden described it the next morning, it was like old times with him and Gus in the car, only they weren\u2019t chasing me this time.</p><p>They said that Sophia lived in a small bungalow on the edge of a golf course, a much easier location to get in and out of than an apartment building, which was good, but she had quite a few neighbors and they were close to her, which could pose a bit of a problem. Camden got choked up when he mentioned Ben. He didn\u2019t see him but he could see a few toys scattered in the front yard, solidifying his existence.</p> <p>As much as Camden wanted to swoop in there and get his son back, patience was an unfortunate virtue. Gus wanted us to hold off for a few days while they basically stalked Sophia to get an idea of where she went and at what times and who had Ben when she wasn\u2019t around. The tighter the operation was, the less traumatic it would be for Ben.</p><p>It was on day three of their surveillance that they discovered the neighbor across the street took Ben to her house every other day, while Sophia placed him in daycare during the remaining days. The neighbor was an older woman in her late fifties who didn\u2019t appear to have children herself but would take in a few other kids in the neighbourhood, maybe for some extra money. An easier target than a daycare.</p><p>When they got home that day and we were lying in bed, I could tell that Camden was beating himself up about it and what they had to do.</p><p>\u201cWould it make it easier if you knew that Sophia wasn\u2019t a good mother?\u201d I asked, probing him for a hint.</p><p>He shook his head and leaned back into the pillows \u201cNo. Not really. Because Ben is just a boy and a boy loves his mom. It doesn\u2019t matter how wicked the mother is, that\u2019s the only mother he knows. Ben will be crushed when we do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he\u2019ll eventually be crushed if you don\u2019t,\u201d I reminded him. \u201cAs will all of us.\u201d</p><p>I snuggled into him, kissing down his face, wanting to distract him. \u201cTell me about our dream life. Where we are. What we\u2019re doing. What you will be doing?\u201d</p><p>He smiled and sighed and held me close. He knew I was trying to take his mind off of things and he didn\u2019t care. \u201cWell, if we could I\u2019d still like to go to Gualala. Though in reality we\u2019d probably end up in Canada or something, because Sophia and her brothers will not take this lying down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a dream life, Camden. Gualala it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay then. Gualala. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019d be doing tattoos, maybe I\u2019d try my hand at painting or sculpture. I\u2019ve always loved carving things out of driftwood. I could have an art shop. We\u2019d have Ben and a boy or girl of our own, four years younger. Gus would be there too with some lady love of his.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what am I doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou?\u201d he eyed me appreciatively. \u201cYou\u2019d just stand around and look pretty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me blow jobs.\u201d</p><p>I punched him in the arm.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he laughed. \u201cI know you love the cock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell then, you tell me,\u201d he said, looking serious and wiping a strand of hair from my face. \u201cWhat do you want to be doing? If you could do anything.\u201d</p><p>The thing was, I\u2019d never really thought about that. I was always just trying to survive and keep going, from one place to the next. I never had goals. I never had dreams. Not really.</p><p>I thought back to something I did enjoy once. Something that had put a rift between Camden and I all those years ago.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019d be a photographer,\u201d I told him. He raised his brows and I continued, \u201cOf course you were always better at that than I was.\u201d He bit his lip sheepishly and I knew he remembered the photos he had taken of me back in art class, for a project he called \u201cJustification.\u201d It had humiliated me at the time, but now I realized that he was only telling the truth. And sometimes the truth fucking hurt.</p><p>\u201cI think you would be good at that,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have a way of seeing people.\u201d</p><p>I traced my fingers across his chest, making swirls and waves. \u201cI like the idea of giving hope. That you can capture the world in such a way that even the ugly things look beautiful.\u201d</p><p>The beauty in what was real.</p><p>He kissed my head and cleared his throat. \u201cNow. About that blow job?\u201d</p><p>I punched him again.</p><p>Then I gave him one.</p><p>Of course.</p><p>I woke up in the middle of the night with a light headache and my stomach grumbling. I hadn\u2019t really eaten anything for the last few days. I had been basically fasting when I was in the jungle, only eating when I had the chance and coasting by on adrenaline the rest of the time, so now that I was back in California and still a pile of nerves, my appetite was slow to come back.</p><p>But when it did come back, it was back with a vengeance. As I rolled out of bed, careful not to wake Camden who was snoring lightly, I put my hand to my rumbling stomach and had a silly yet hopeful thought that perhaps I was already pregnant and this was my body telling me so.</p><p>I grabbed my robe and slipped it on, a cool, ocean breeze coming in through the open windows smelling of night-blooming Jasmine, and made my way downstairs to the kitchen. I popped two pieces of toast in the toaster, poured myself a glass of water and opened the drawer where I had stashed a bottle of Ibuprofen earlier in the day.</p><p>I shook two orange pills into my hand and raised it up to my mouth.</p><p>My eyes went to the kitchen window.</p><p>There was a man in the reflection.</p><p>Grinning.</p><p>Behind me.</p><p>Javier.</p><p>I opened my mouth to scream but he was fast and he grabbed me around the waist with one arm, his hand going over my mouth with the other. I dropped the pills to the floor where they clattered, praying that Camden could hear that but I didn\u2019t think he could from where our bedroom was.</p><p>Javier pressed his hand hard into me and started bringing me backward, his hot breath at my neck. There was only one second where I felt a slice of relief that he was still alive. But that quickly vanished. Now I wanted him dead. I wanted Travis to have finished him off. I wanted my gun to have had one more bullet in it. Because, no matter what I thought of Javier before, I knew now that he was here for a terrible reason.</p><p>All bets were off.</p><p>No more promises.</p><p>I struggled, trying to kick out with my legs, to knock over a jar full of cooking spoons, hoping to cause more noise but it was impossible. Javier pulled me out of the kitchen, practically dragging me into the next room, the one-car garage we had.</p><p>Dark.</p><p>Small.</p><p>Practically soundproof.</p><p>Not good.</p><p>He managed to quietly close the door behind him, shutting us in the garage together, the smell of oil and dust assaulting me, as well as Javier\u2019s distinctive musk which made the whole thing that much more terrifying. I breathed hard against his hand and he leaned back against the door, his arm around my stomach and legs growing tighter and tighter.</p><p>\u201cShhh,\u201d he whispered in my ear, lips touching my lobe. \u201cShhhh, angel. Keep quiet. Calm down. I promise I won\u2019t hurt you.\u201d</p><p>That meant nothing anymore.</p><p>I could hear his lips against teeth, smiling. \u201cSo you think you could just leave me alone to die, yes?\u201d</p><p>You left me, you sick son of a bitch. I wished there was light in the garage so I could see the closest weapon but there was nothing. It was completely pitch black. Dark as sin. And the only sound was my heart pounding and Javier\u2019s breathing in my ear.</p><p>\u201cThis was after, of course, you pulled the trigger.\u201d He sucked in his breath. \u201cYou know, angel, that really hurt me. That really changed ... everything. You were the one person I thought wouldn\u2019t betray me. And yet you tried to kill me. How do you think that made me feel? I lost my sister. And then I lost you.\u201d</p><p>He suddenly took his hand away and put it at my neck, wrapping it around until I could feel the grooves he was creating. I gasped for air, to scream, but only pitiful sounds came out.</p><p>\u201cTo think I wasted ...\u201d I eked out, my face turning red, \u201ctears on you.\u201d</p><p>His grip tightened and he lifted me slightly off the ground, just for a moment, just to let me know he could hang me if he wanted. I couldn\u2019t speak anymore. I couldn\u2019t even get in one breath.</p><p>\u201cAnd to think I wasted tears on you,\u201d he snarled, suddenly malicious. He breathed sharply through his nose and I could tell he was pulling himself together. Trying to be calm. In control. Always in control. \u201cBut this is for the best. I can see that. We were never meant to be. You were never as strong as I thought you were. Such a shame though. You had such dirty wings. Such promise. Power makes the world go around, angel. It keeps you alive when you should be dead. Don\u2019t you want that immortality? Or are you so happy with a boring, ordinary life? With a boring, ordinary man?\u201d</p><p>I felt my heart slowing, the veins in my head about to burst. Then he slowly released his hand and gave me two seconds to wheeze and try and get the air back in before he covered up my mouth with his hand again. I fought against his palm but he held me hard while his other hand began to ease my robe aside.</p><p>I froze like a deer in headlights as his palm slid down my bare middle.</p><p>\u201cYou know I can give you what you need,\u201d he murmured. \u201cYou know I always have. I can make you come just by touching you, even now.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My eyes widened and his hand moved down between my legs, fingers going over my clit.</p><p>\u201cNot very wet,\u201d he remarked in a low, careful voice. \u201cYou must have missed me. Missed my touch.\u201d</p><p>And he knew all the right places to touch, the right places to tease. Still, I felt nothing in my heart. And my body, my body only wanted to run and flee. I wanted to tear off my skin and burn it. He felt like a monster, a wicked reptile of cold leathery scales, a creature from my darkest dreams. He would not win me over here.</p><p>Perhaps if I let him think he did ...</p> <p>I relaxed into his touch, hoping I could feed his delusion. Not too much that he\u2019d catch on. But just enough. I willed my breathing and my heart to slow and leaned slightly into him.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my angel,\u201d he said, and I could feel his erection growing against my ass. His hand loosened on my mouth and I took the opportunity. I bit down hard on his hand and he yelped, letting go of me. I went for the door but he was at my side knocking me hard to the ground, my head banging against the cold concrete. Everything began to spin, stars and streams went around my head, and I lost precious seconds trying to get up.</p><p>By the time I struggled to get to my feet, my bad leg collapsing under me, I heard the shake of metal, the rip of duct tape. I screamed for Camden before Javier grabbed me by the hair at the top of my head and yanked me toward him, spinning me around and slamming my head against the door, his fingers finding my mouth. He stuck the duct tape across my lips.</p><p>\u201cCamden can\u2019t hear you now,\u201d he whispered in the dark.</p><p>My heart sank at that. Had I been a fool to think that Javier was the only one in the house?</p> <p>The light in the garage went on. Javier had one hand against it, the other gripped around my elbow. I eyed the shelves in the garage, spying a hammer and went for it but he dived into me and I went flying into them. Just before they toppled onto me he yanked me backward and out of the way and stuck a handcuff around one wrist.</p><p>What are you going to do with me? I tried to say through the tape but it came out all garbled.</p><p>Javier smiled. He understood perfectly. And I was able to get my first good look at him. He looked almost the same, maybe in a more expensive suit, all black, his hair shorter and neatly trimmed, showing off the streaks of grey that were threaded through it, and he had a shiny new gold watch on his wrist. He reeked of power and deceit. Of confidence.</p><p>I could only guess as to what that meant.</p><p>\u201cOh, you poor thing?\u201d he said with mock sympathy. \u201cYou really think I came here for you?\u201d</p><p>Quick as a whip he spun me around and stuck the other cuff around the passenger door handle of the Mini Cooper. I collapsed against the door, slumping to the ground.</p> <p>He walked over to a camping cooler in the corner and pulled it out to me, scraping loudly on the cement. He took a seat on it like we were about to have a little chat and brought out a gun from his inner jacket pocket, looking it over in his hands. My eyes watched it fearfully. I was dumbstruck with complete and utter terror.</p><p>He looked up and frowned at me. \u201cI told you angel, I\u2019m not going to hurt you. I only came here to do a little business transaction.\u201d</p><p>I stiffened and he grinned at me.</p><p>\u201cOh don\u2019t worry,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not after your money. I\u2019ve never cared much for that. No, what I\u2019m after are men. Manpower. Power. Freedom. The chance to win.\u201d He sighed and looked around him with distaste. \u201cYou could have been living with me. You could have had it all. Instead you\u2019re in a shithole in America. Do you know where I am now? I have the most beautiful house you could ever imagine, with views as far as the eye can see. I have privilege now. More than that, I have ... prestige. What Violetta said about me having a cartel nobody cares about? Oh, I wish she could see me now. I took over for Travis. And more than that, I took over from the Morales. I am at the top. Where I always should have been.\u201d He leaned forward, elbows on knees and looked me dead in the eye, face completely serious. \u201cWhere you should have been. Angel. Where the fuck did we go wrong?\u201d</p><p>Where do I begin? But what was the point. You could tell Javier something a million times but unless he saw the reason, unless he believed it, it didn\u2019t matter. If he thought the sky was red instead of blue, it would be red. Everything I could throw in his face he would justify in some psychopathic way.</p><p>\u201cI really did love you,\u201d he said softly. Then he straightened up and his eyes were unreadable. Blank. \u201cBut there are some things in this world more important than love. Some things that last longer. Empires. You build something great, something large, something that gets people\u2019s attention and you\u2019re remembered forever. You love a girl, give her your heart, and you won\u2019t be remembered six years later. Love doesn\u2019t last. But empires do. They go on. And on. And on. Even if just in history books.\u201d</p><p>He got up and started deliberately pacing back and forth, toying with the gun. I had to wonder if Camden was okay. Because if he wasn\u2019t ... God help me.</p><p>\u201cLet me tell you a thing about cartels,\u201d he said with an air of superiority. \u201cIt\u2019s all about expansion. And you get to expand by thinking ahead. Mexico is bloody. Mexico is war. But I love it. So what do I do? I go across the border and find the itty-bitty American bloods and gangs and their pussy-whipped drug trades and grow-ops and I take over. I get here first, before the Baja Cartel. Before the Gulf. I expand. I get more drugs, more people, more money. I just had the tiny asshole opening of Mississippi before. Now I have Southern California. Or, at least I\u2019m trying. There\u2019s a rather large operation that needs, um, how do you say, lubrication? Though you never needed that with me, did you angel?\u201d He stopped right in front of me, his dark, greasy shoes spotless against the dirty concrete floor. \u201cLook at me when I\u2019m talking to you.\u201d</p> <p>I slowly raised my head, not because he told me to but because if he was going to do anything I wanted to see it.</p><p>His lips twisted into a sick smile. \u201cSo, I need the grease to get this deal going. Let\u2019s call it a peace offering. You see, the Madano brothers were really upset when Camden got away on them, so I figure if I brought him back and handed him over, well they\u2019d be more likely to do business with me.\u201d</p><p>My eyes widened, heart hammering with fear until the room started getting fuzzy.</p><p>\u201cI know you don\u2019t like that,\u201d he went on, \u201cand I\u2019m sorry. But I did tell you to never get close too close to anything. To anyone. I was just trying to spare your heart from the inevitable. I had my sights on Camden from the moment I saw him in Mexico. Once I found out the lengths you\u2019d go to save your Gus, it all ... fell into place. And I wouldn\u2019t be where I am right now if I didn\u2019t act on opportunity. I know you knew that once. How important opportunity was to life.\u201d</p><p>He watched me for a few moments but I gave him nothing but the horror that was surely on my face. He sighed and threw his arms up. \u201cAll right then. I guess we\u2019re done here.\u201d</p><p>He walked to me and put his hand on the side of my cheek and stared me right in the eye. \u201cTake care of yourself, Ellie.\u201d He kissed my forehead and started walking toward the door. Then he stopped and brought his fingers to his nose, sniffing them. \u201cSmells like you.\u201d He licked his tongue along his index finger. \u201cStill tastes like you, too.\u201d He smiled at me, pleased with himself. \u201cI\u2019ll make sure to show Camden, see if he agrees with me.\u201d</p><p>Fucking hell.</p><p>Fucking hell!</p><p>I started screaming, my cries muffled by the duct tape and tried to get my hand out of the handcuff. Javier walked to the door, tossing me one last look over his shoulder before he stepped out into the kitchen and disappeared. I stopped struggling and listened, heard Javier going up the stairs and then heard Camden yelling, just once, a swear, like \u201cYou fuck\u201d, something raw and primal, pure rage, and I could only imagine what Javier was telling him, that he did stuff to me.</p><p>Tears started flowing down my face, my heart being swallowed by my chest. I heard someone being dragged down the stairs, the low voices of Javier and someone else. Then the front door slammed. A car started down the street and then was gone.</p><p>My man was gone.</p><p>And I was alone.</p><p>I hadn\u2019t kept him safe.</p><p>I allowed myself to cry for Camden for one full minute, counting down from sixty through the tears, trying to keep breathing properly through my nose. When I hit zero, I got to my feet. I looked around the garage and began to think.</p><p>There was the hammer and tools that had been knocked over earlier, only a few feet from the farthest reach of my feet. Maybe I could either hammer off the door handle on the Cooper or hammer my handcuff. But getting to the hammer was a problem.</p><p>I took in a deep breath and a tried to wrap both hands around the door handle. I tried to pull the Mini Cooper toward the hammer and struggled stupidly. Of course I couldn\u2019t drag it on my own, it weighed like 2,000 lbs.</p><p>But if it were placed in neutral ...</p><p>I took off the robe and wrapped part of it around my free elbow. Then I took a step back as far as I could go, steadied my aim and brought my elbow down into the passenger window with one sharp jab. Glass shattered everywhere and I knew my arm was bleeding even with the thick robe\u2019s protection but at least the window was broken. I quickly used the robe to wipe away the rest of the glass fragments, then draped it over the edge of the door to protect myself when I reached over and popped the car into neutral. Then I wrapped my shoulder in the extra fabric and began to push the car forward, the pressure of my whole body on the door frame.</p><p>The Cooper slowly inched forward until the fender was pushing aside the fallen shelves. I was finally close enough. I stretched my bad leg out since it could reach the furthest and pulled the hammer toward me. I let out a giddy little cry once I was able to pick it up in my hands. I had a few jabs at the handcuff but kept missing and nearly getting my hand, so I went for the door handle instead. Turns out, BMW does not construct door handles to withstand blows from a hammer and after the tenth blow, the metal clanged loose to the ground and I was free.</p><p>Free.</p><p>With no fucking idea of what to do next.</p><p>Javier had Camden and was going to do an exchange with the Madano brothers. I had no idea what would happen to Camden after that. But I had a feeling I knew someone who would.</p><p>I quickly raced upstairs as fast as I could with my leg, threw on a pair of jeans, my special boots and a tight tee-shirt then pulled all the guns we had out of the closet. I stuck a revolver in my boots with my knife, then grabbed a pistol with a silencer and stuck that down the back of my jeans. I went downstairs and grabbed the note pad I\u2019d been writing in, ripping off the top sheet, the one with Sophia\u2019s address on it, then ripped out another and scribbled in giant letters a note for Gus, leaving it right on the kitchen table.</p><p>Go Get Ben! It said.</p><p>I didn\u2019t want Gus coming after us or involving himself. But with what I was about to do, Ben needed to be kept safe and I didn\u2019t have time to do it. I had to go after Camden. He may have been Javier\u2019s priority but he was also mine.</p><p>I only hoped it wasn\u2019t too late.</p><p>I scampered back into the garage, opened the garage door, and revved the battered Mini Cooper. I peeled backward out of the building and ripped down the street. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Heading to Pasadena.</p><p>CHAPTER EIGHTEEN</p><p>I pulled the car up to Sophia\u2019s house just before dawn was breaking, face raw and ragged from the wind that blasted through the broken window, my knuckles sore from the sweaty grip on the steering wheel. I prayed that Ben and her both knew how to sleep in because I wanted as little struggle as possible.</p><p>The fact that I was about to do this was nuts.</p> <p>But with Camden on the line, it didn\u2019t really matter. I would do what I had to do. Even the ugly things.</p><p>I eased out of the car and managed to sneak around to the back of the house, which faced onto the golf course, careful not to trip over Ben\u2019s wayward toy dump trucks and his sandbox. The back door was an easier lock to pick with less people to spot me. I got the door open in no time and slowly crept inside. The floor was cheap linoleum and silent underneath my feet. There were night lights lining the hallway which made it better for me, casting the area in a blue glow. I passed a laundry room and a playroom, and a room with the door open. That had to be Ben\u2019s. I swallowed my apprehension and kept going. The room next to that was a bathroom and then there was another room with the door open only a crack. Beyond that it was the living room and dining room and the foyer. I paused at the room with the door slightly ajar and debated how to do this.</p><p>There was no rule book.</p><p>No plan now.</p><p>I had to wing it and hope for the best.</p> <p>I carefully pushed the door open, crouching low to the ground, figuring mothers were probably light sleepers and crept inside. She was asleep in her bed and turned over just as I came inside. Faint light spilled in through the window, allowing me to make out everything in fuzzy detail.</p><p>There was a lamp by her bed. I went to it, bringing out my gun and pointing it at her.</p><p>I flicked on the light.</p><p>Waited for that agonizing half-second for her eyes to open.</p><p>They did. Forehead scrunched. Eyes blinking at the light and at me.</p><p>And then at the gun.</p> <p>Her mouth opened.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t!\u201d I hissed. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare scream.\u201d</p><p>I pulled back the hammer on the revolver. The sound that I meant business. Camden did it to me once. Scared the shit out of me.</p><p>Gotcha, he\u2019d said.</p><p>This time I got her.</p><p>I smiled as the realization came into her face, flooring her with bewilderment. \u201cYou were ... you had the facial. The redhead with the hot date.\u201d</p><p>My smile twitched. \u201cI was. I did. Two guesses to who my hot date was.\u201d I stared down the barrel of the gun at her. \u201cWhere is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d she asked innocently.</p> <p>\u201cYou know who. Camden. McQueen. Your ex-husband. Where. Is. He?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head and I suddenly jammed the gun toward her, the tip just inches from her face.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you play fucking stupid with me,\u201d I whispered harshly.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you whispering?\u201d she said, her voice growing louder. \u201cAfraid to wake up Ben? You don\u2019t want him to see this? Let him. Let him know how psychotic his daddy\u2019s new girlfriend is.\u201d</p><p>She leaned forward and spit in my face. Laughed. Enjoying herself. It was all a game.</p><p>I slowly wiped her mucous off my forehead.</p><p>She said, \u201cCunt,\u201d under her breath.</p><p>That didn\u2019t get to me. \u201cYou can call me all the names you want as long as you tell me where your brothers are taking Camden. Where are they meeting Javier?\u201d</p><p>She snorted and sat up, all attitude. \u201cI\u2019m not telling you.\u201d</p><p>I cocked my head in disbelief and tightened my grip on the gun. \u201cI don\u2019t think you have any idea of how serious this all is. I will make you tell me.\u201d</p><p>She gave me a blas\u00e9 look. \u201cLook, honey. I know all about you. You\u2019re some white trash southern scum chick who pulled a fast one when she shouldn\u2019t have and got mixed up with Camden. You\u2019re both the same. Good-looking, maybe a good fuck in bed, but absolutely inept when it comes to getting anything in life. You can want to find Camden all you want, but really, you\u2019re wasting your time. He\u2019s as good as dead, a good riddance, and you\u2019re not going to get a single thing out of me because you\u2019re not built for it. You\u2019re a scammer. A con artist. Look at your arms. You couldn\u2019t even put a dent in the wall, what the hell are you going to do to me? Shoot me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said through grinding teeth, feeling the rage build up.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what thought.\u201d</p><p>I brought my gun across her face in one quick, violent and terrible motion, the end of the pistol smashing into her nose. She cried out and I grabbed her by the jaw, bringing her bleeding face up to mine. \u201cI won\u2019t shoot you, not yet anyway. But I will break your nose and your cheekbones and your jaw and every little pretty part of you that can\u2019t get you a date with hot men. Let\u2019s see how they want you after this, huh?\u201d</p><p>Finally, I saw it. The fear in her eyes. She got it. She understood that there were some things out there far worse than death. For me, it was a life without Camden McQueen. For her, it was a life with reconstructive surgery.</p><p>I grabbed her by her arm and yanked her out of bed. Couldn\u2019t put a dent in the wall, huh? She was making me tempted to treat her face like the Cooper\u2019s window again but I didn\u2019t want to do anything I didn\u2019t have to.</p><p>I jabbed the gun into her side. \u201cYou\u2019re coming with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust take him,\u201d she cried out as I pulled her along.</p><p>\u201cTake him?\u201d I asked, pressing the gun into her harder, my fingers gripping her elbow like I was trying to snap it in half. \u201cTake who?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake Ben!\u201d she cried out angrily. \u201cIf that\u2019s what you want so bad, just take him and leave me the fuck alone.\u201d</p><p>My head shook ever so slightly, trying to comprehend this woman. \u201cOh. Believe me. We are taking him. The minute we step out this door, he will be gone. And you won\u2019t see him again. Not that you care. But until you tell me where Camden is, until you show me, I\u2019m going to take away all the other things you care about. I forgot to mention how nice your teeth are and how easy they would be to knock out. Think about that for a bit and then tell me where he is.\u201d</p><p>I brought her out into the hallway, back out the door I came in and around the house. The sky was now violet and grey, the rising sun hidden by the hills and smog. Everything around us was monochrome and I was on autopilot, letting instinct and drive dictate each movement.</p><p>I shoved her into the front seat, my gun trained on her as I ran around to the side and hopped in. I held the gun low and instructed her to drive.</p><p>\u201cTake me there,\u201d I told her. \u201cAnd if you try and fuck me over in any way, you\u2019ll pay for it. But if you do as I say and you get me to Camden, before it\u2019s too late, then you live and your pretty little face will remain intact. Except for maybe your nasal cavities. But your coke addiction and collapsed septum is your problem, not mine. Now, drive, bitch.\u201d</p><p>I forced her leg down, pedal to the floor, and we zipped off.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d I asked her.</p><p>\u201cTo the desert,\u201d she said, looking annoyed, like my questions were bothering her. Perhaps it was the gun or the threats or the fact that she was driving in her underwear.</p><p>\u201cWhere in the desert?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, I don\u2019t really know,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t ask.\u201d She gave me a sidelong look. \u201cI didn\u2019t care.\u201d</p><p>I jabbed my elbow in her face. She cried out, letting go of the steering wheel as the car wheeled into the opposite lane, the car slowing.</p><p>\u201cKeep driving!\u201d I screamed, bringing the car back into our lane again and then pressing her foot down with the hand holding the gun. \u201cAnd tell me where.\u201d</p><p>She sobbed, a few tears escaping. It tugged at me a bit, made me question what I was doing. Then I remembered who she was, what she knew, and who she was doing it for.</p><p>\u201cTell me,\u201d I repeated more slowly.</p><p>\u201cA place with planes. He said it was a place with planes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho said?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVincent. My brother. The one in charge.\u201d</p><p>I scrunched up my face. A place with planes?</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all he said?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said it was abandoned. And that it was easy to hide their men there. It\u2019s a set up.\u201d</p><p>Yeah of course it fucking was. But now Javier was on the other end of it.</p><p>\u201cWhere in the desert? What area?\u201d I asked.</p><p>She shook her head, trying to stop the bleeding and steer at the same time. \u201cThe place that has the milkshakes. Near ... Barstow.\u201d</p><p>That was either route 66 or highway 58.</p><p>\u201cTurn left onto 15 before San Bernardino,\u201d I told her. I think I had an idea where they were going. There was the Edwards Air Force Base out in the desert but that was highly secure and not a place any cartels would go near. Then, there was also an airplane boneyard on the side of the highway between Bakersfield and Barstow.</p><p>The place where old planes go to die.</p><p>Shit. This wasn\u2019t going to be easy.</p><p>But I had to try.</p><p>I nudged Sophia with my gun and nodded at the rising sun.</p><p>\u201cKeep driving.\u201d</p><p>The sun was a blinding fist in the sky by the time we passed Barstow and turned onto Highway 58 that would take us through to the airplane graveyard. Bleak, empty desert spread out for miles on all sides of us, ground the color of bleached bones. The Cooper sped along, the air that was blasting in through the broken window was still cool at this time of morning, though I knew it would start baking soon.</p><p>I made Sophia drive past the Edwards Air Force Base, the only real pocket of civilization, until we came to what always struck me as one of the eeriest sights in the desert. Off in the distant, shimmering like a ghostly mirage, was plane after plane after plane. Jumbo jets, 747s, commuter planes \u2013 every plane you could think of in the commercial aviation industry were all cluttered together like sardines. Part of the yard, which stretched on for miles, was organized, with jets lined up in rows and the other part of the yard was like a dump. The boneyard.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m guessing this is it,\u201d I said as we drove closer.</p><p>\u201cMy brothers can be dramatic,\u201d she explained. \u201cThis will make the world pay attention.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLooks like it,\u201d I muttered. Cartels, man, always trying to up each other. Well I guess the Mojave Desert was a good place for a shootout, especially when you had massive airplanes to hide behind.</p><p>I asked her to slow the car as we came to the road that led off toward the yard. Dust was flying up from it as the car went down it, approaching a low building at the front.</p><p>\u201cIf they\u2019re here, they won\u2019t be coming through this way,\u201d I said, turning to make sure we weren\u2019t going to crash into anyone before I ordered her to make a U-turn. \u201cI think the first part of the yard is just airplane storage. The boneyard stretches behind it.\u201d</p><p>I jerked my head to the desert and pressed the gun into her waist. \u201cTime to go off-roading.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere?\u201d she said.</p><p>I nodded. \u201cGo straight to that clump of Joshua trees out there. Watch out for tumbleweed.\u201d</p><p>She raised her brows and exhaled loudly but quickly turned the car off the road and straight into the desert. If we went straight we could go all the way around the boneyard and get in through the back. But the dust cloud that would follow us would be a dead giveaway that we were coming to spoil their party and alert both the cartels and the authorities who no doubt patrolled at least the airport storage area. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cPark it and get out,\u201d I told her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in my underwear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd your nose is broken. Does it look like I give a fuck?\u201d In my tired, delirious, adrenaline-ravaged state, I had no patience and no time to care. I wanted Camden back. He was the only thing on my mind, the only thing that put one foot in front of the other, the only thing that gave me strength to pull the trigger if I had to. \u201cNow get out.\u201d</p><p>She opened the door and looked at the hard earth of caked sand and rocks. \u201cI don\u2019t have shoes,\u201d she said pitifully. She eyed a beach bag I had in the backseat that had a towel and flip flops spilling out of it. \u201cCan I wear your flip flops? Otherwise it\u2019ll hurt too much to walk.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh for fuck\u2019s sake!\u201d I leaned in the back to grab the bag.</p><p>Big mistake.</p><p>Stupid, foolish, Ellie.</p><p>Sophia slammed her arm into my head and I dropped the gun in the backseat. I cried out and quickly grabbed the gun, twisting back in my seat to see her running off into the distance, a small cloud of dust trailing her. Hurts too much to walk, my ass.</p><p>I jumped out of the car, my gun trained on her as she went. But I couldn\u2019t just shoot her. I needed her. I quickly started booking it after her as fast as I could go. I pressed down on my shot leg, grunting through the pain until I didn\u2019t feel anything anymore. I would get her. I would do anything.</p> <p>Because she was barefoot and the terrain was anything but friendly, she was running slow enough that I was gaining on her. What a sight we would have been for any spectator to see; a girl in a tee-shirt and underwear running barefoot through the Mojave Desert followed by a limping chick with a revolver and a psychotic look on her face, dust rising up around us and floating to the blue sky.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t long before I had her.</p><p>I did a running tackle and brought her straight into the dirt, slamming her face into the ground. She cried out in pain but I did not give a shit anymore. She used the last bit of humanity I had left against me and now I had nothing.</p><p>I yanked her up off the ground, so fucking tempted to smash my gun into her temple and drag her to the boneyard. But somehow, I don\u2019t know how, I kept it all in and started marching her forward.</p><p>\u201cNice try,\u201d I said, my nails digging into her arm until she winced. I looked down at her bleeding feet. \u201cEven a pedicure won\u2019t fix that.\u201d</p><p>She whimpered and I paid no heed. We quickly scuffled ourselves along, trying to disturb as little sand as possible while still moving quickly. The sun hammered down on us, my eyes burning from the glare and dust, my throat raw and dry, but we soldiered on, step after step, until we reached the edge of the perimeter fence. We stopped and looked up. The barbed wire at the top was rusted to shit and tumbleweed blew past on the other side of the chain links, heading to a scrap pile of jet engine parts. They wouldn\u2019t have scaled it and from the looks of the condition of this part of the yard, there was probably an easier way in.</p> <p>I brought her around to the back and we walked down the fence, around Joshua trees, cacti and wild shrubs and heaps of scrap metal that didn\u2019t quite make it inside the bone yard. Finally we spotted an area where the chain links had been cut. Our ticket in. Maybe our only way out.</p><p>I took a deep breath and walked us through the opening.</p><p>We were inside.</p><p>It was fucking eerie.</p><p>Up close the planes looked like an armada of plane crashes. Some of them were charred, some were broken into bits. There were flotation devices scattered around, oxygen masks hanging off of shrubs. Many commercial jets were decapitated, their severed heads lying about, stripped inside of all furniture and instruments. Some planes looked like they were about to fly away and some just had the seats left. Broken wings were stacked in piles.</p><p>No wonder they picked this place. It scared the shit out of you just being there.</p><p>We walked carefully out into the middle, between the giant wheels of a jumbo jet\u2019s landing gear, standing up-right like a giant metal tree, and the severed tail end of a Cessna.</p><p>I stopped and pulled her back once we were in the open again. Planes surrounded us, each window an eye, watching our every move. I badly wanted to run and hide, to get out of harm\u2019s way. But if they didn\u2019t see me with Sophia, they wouldn\u2019t know how damn serious I was.</p> <p>\u201cHello?\u201d I called out, my voice bouncing back from the motionless aircraft. I cleared my throat and yelled, \u201cI have your sister. You know what I want.\u201d</p><p>I looked around in circles, searching every creepy corner of the boneyard, as far as I could see. They could be everywhere.</p><p>And nowhere.</p><p>I put the gun to Sophia\u2019s head. \u201cIf you\u2019re lying to me ...\u201d I ground out.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d she moaned, obviously in distress. Good. \u201cI told you the truth. They said planes. You brought me here.\u201d</p><p>Shit. Fuck. Shit.</p><p>Was I wrong about this place? Were they somewhere else entirely?</p><p>Was Camden already handed over?</p><p>Already dead?</p><p>I swallowed hard and rubbed my lips together. I couldn\u2019t lose it now. Not now. Not until I knew.</p><p>\u201cLook,\u201d Sophia whispered. I followed her gaze over to one of the airplanes.</p><p>There was a face at the window.</p><p>I let out a gasp and then started looking closer. There was someone crouched behind a lone passenger seat. There was another person behind a wing.</p><p>We weren\u2019t alone.</p><p>There was a shuffle by one of the decapitated plane heads and someone that could only be Vincent Madano came out, gun held lazily to his side. Like Javier, he was fond of slick suits and he looked like a complete Mafia stereotype, from the Roman nose to the jutting chin and greasy hair.</p><p>\u201cYou must be Ellie Watt,\u201d Vincent said as he stopped a few yards away, tumbleweeds rolling between us like we\u2019d been placed in a Western TV show set. \u201cNice to finally meet you. I\u2019ve heard many great things, all second-hand information, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Camden?\u201d I asked, my voice shaking against its will.</p><p>\u201cCamden McQueen,\u201d he said, his eyes darkening. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I expected to see him here, not you and not my sister.\u201d</p><p>I pressed the gun into her head. \u201cI don\u2019t want to kill her but I will if I have to.\u201d</p><p>He nodded as if he were impressed. \u201cI can see that. Hopefully you won\u2019t have to make such ... tough decisions.\u201d His eyes darted to the side. \u201cAnd there\u2019s the man of the hour.\u201d</p><p>I whipped my head to look. Camden was walking toward us, Javier behind him with the gun aimed at Camden\u2019s back. He was wearing a denim shirt, black shorts, hands raised above his head. I took in the details like I\u2019d never see him again. Because maybe I wouldn\u2019t.</p><p>We locked eyes and in his beautiful blues, he was telling me to stay calm. To stay focused. To not worry.</p><p>That made me worry.</p><p>Oh, god that made me worry.</p><p>Because Camden was the kind of person who would give his life for yours if it meant you getting out alive. And I didn\u2019t want that. I didn\u2019t want life if he wasn\u2019t in it. I wanted he and I, with the waves crashing at our feet.</p><p>\u201cHere he is,\u201d Javier announced, pushing Camden forward, just for fun it seemed. Camden stumbled but righted himself, dust and rocks scattering at his feet. The sun continued to sear us, making the whole scene jump in contrast. Surreal.</p><p>Yet, this was reality.</p><p>Harsh, cold truth.</p><p>He stopped a little ways away and looked over at Vincent. \u201cI brought him for you, the peace offering. Now I hope we can do business.\u201d</p><p>Vincent nodded and wiggled his hand. \u201cSend him over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I screamed, losing all control, like the devil was being ripped out of my throat. \u201cCamden stays there, no one fucking hurts him or I will kill Sophia!\u201d</p><p>Javier shrugged and pushed Camden forward until he was walking. \u201cI don\u2019t care if you kill Sophia.\u201d</p><p>Sophia stiffened against me, feeling the fear. I stared at him, pleading with his blank, reptilian eyes for an ounce of humanity, of love, of compassion toward me. \u201cPlease, Javier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? I don\u2019t.\u201d He motioned to Vincent. \u201cDoes he?\u201d</p><p>I looked to Vincent. He smiled sympathetically at me and tilted his head downward.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get over it,\u201d he said.</p><p>My world froze.</p><p>Sophia cried out in indignation, anger and betrayal spilling from her lips, and I was too dazed to even hold onto her. She ripped herself out of my grip and ran toward Vincent, fists in the air, screaming her head off, ready to pound on him.</p><p>He raised his gun and shot her in the chest.</p><p>She crumpled to the ground, dust flying around her.</p><p>My collateral was dead.</p><p>The planet slowed on its axis. Every second stretched longer.</p><p>I looked at Camden who had stopped in the middle of it all, hands still above his head, halfway in between Javier and Vincent. Camden looked back at me.</p><p>He smiled sadly.</p><p>\u201cTake care of Ben for me,\u201d he said.</p><p>I blinked, trying to understand the implications of what he was asking while my heart sunk as hard as rock, blasting through me until I knew it wasn\u2019t beating anymore.</p><p>\u201cCamden!\u201d I screamed, an out of body experience.</p><p>Vincent aimed the gun at him.</p><p>Pulled the trigger.</p><p>Shot Camden straight in the chest.</p><p>In the heart.</p><p>In his beautiful, lovely, endless heart.</p><p>He flew backward, all 6\u20192\u201d of him, tats and muscle and love.</p><p>Fell hard to the ground, making it rumble at my feet.</p><p>Motionless.</p><p>A bullet whizzed past my head and I had a split second to react. Not that I wanted to react, not that I was trying, not that I cared.</p><p>Because I was already dead. I died out there with Camden.</p><p>I didn\u2019t even care anymore.</p><p>But the body\u2019s will to survive is strong. Humanity\u2019s instinct to preserve itself lives on. I was acting without knowledge, without thought.</p><p>I ducked low to the ground and rolled until I was by the giant landing gear and then popped up behind it, using it as a shield.</p><p>I leaned against it, trying to find my heart but it was gone.</p><p>CHAPTER NINETEEN</p><p>I sobbed uncontrollably, once, twice, loud, my soul being seared open by the pain, the debilitating pain. I couldn\u2019t breathe. I couldn\u2019t see. I couldn\u2019t even be.</p><p>Camden.</p><p>My moon.</p><p>Shattered.</p><p>Lifeless on the floor of the Mojave Desert.</p><p>Another bullet rocketed off the landing gear making me snap to attention. To the reality that was going on. There was a firefight. I was in the middle of it.</p><p>I peered around the gear, my eyes straying to Camden who was still lying there on his back, head facing straight up. Vincent was shooting at me. Javier was retreating behind a wing and shooting at Vincent. Este was there, jumping off the top of a plane and onto one of Vincent\u2019s men. Guns were going off in all directions.</p><p>Vincent started running toward me and I fumbled for my gun, ready to finish off the man who had killed the love of my life.</p><p>But Javier popped up, aimed, fired, and shot Vincent in the side. He fell to the ground and Javier took off running behind the body of a 737.</p><p>I quickly got up and walked straight to Vincent. I turned him over with my boot so he was looking up at me, barely alive, and stepped on his chest.</p><p>I didn\u2019t even have words. I just pulled the trigger. Aimed at his head. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Done.</p><p>Then I looked around me. More fighting was going on behind the jetliners, giving me a moment of clarity. A moment of quiet. I may have still been an easy target, but I had to take it. I had to take this moment and make it mine.</p><p>I staggered over to Camden, my legs growing weaker and weaker with every step I took until I finally collapsed to my knees and crawled the rest of the way, dragging myself over the sand.</p><p>I grabbed for his hand, his still-warm hand, and held onto it as the tears unleashed. I sobbed, beside myself in the agony, in the grief, knowing I had to somehow pull through in life without him, to take care of Ben. But it shouldn\u2019t have been this way.</p> <p>The hero doesn\u2019t die.</p><p>And Camden McQueen was a hero unlike any other.</p><p>Selfless, brave, protective.</p><p>Good.</p><p>So fucking good.</p> <p>I moved another inch and tried to see through my tears to his flawless face, to take it in one last time. I placed my shaking hand to his lips.</p><p>He kissed it.</p><p>His eyes flew open and he looked at me.</p><p>I almost screamed. I jerked, startled, scared.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he said.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t even form words. My chest was about to explode from sheer and utter joy. How could this be?</p> <p>I looked down at his wound. He was shot, wasn\u2019t he? I put my hand there, feeling along the denim, expecting it to come away with blood. There was nothing. His chest was stiff, harder than normal. With my mouth agape, I unbuttoned the first few buttons of his shirt and saw the bulletproof vest underneath.</p><p>\u201cWhat the ...\u201d I was unable to finish the sentence.</p><p>I laughed, confused, elated and looked at him, my hands flying for his face. \u201cYou\u2019re not dead.\u201d</p><p>He smiled and kissed my palm. \u201cNo, thankfully. Feels like I got slammed with a brick though.\u201d He tried to sit up and looked around him. \u201cI think we need to get out of here.\u201d</p><p>I put my hand behind his back and helped him sit straight. \u201cI still don\u2019t understand. Why do you have a vest? Who gave you a bulletproof vest?\u201d</p><p>He cocked his head to the side, dust falling off his black hair. \u201cJavier.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head, unable to comprehend any of this.</p><p>He was alive!</p> <p>He was alive!</p><p>\u201cWhy would Javier give you a bulletproof vest?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI smooth-talked him.\u201d</p><p>I raised my brows and got to my feet, helping him up. \u201cHow the hell did you smooth-talk Javier?\u201d</p><p>He shook out his arms and ripped open the rest of shirt to get a better look at the vest. The crunched bullet fell to the ground. \u201cWell, I didn\u2019t know if it would work but I used you. I told him the truth, that you might be pregnant with my child, and that if he really, truly cared about you, he wouldn\u2019t take me away from you. So he had a change of heart and gave me the vest. He\u2019s wearing one too. He did when he got shot at Travis\u2019s as well. Playing dead worked well for him, so ... \u201d</p><p>\u201cA change of heart?\u201d I exclaimed. \u201cHe still handed you over to Vincent! What if Vincent shot you in the head?!\u201d</p><p>\u201cEllie, he doesn\u2019t have a very big heart.\u201d He gave me a pointed look. \u201cBut I\u2019m sure in his fucked-up mind, he was being noble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to fucking kill him,\u201d I sneered. I got my other gun out of my boot and started looking around wildly, wanting to find him and get rid of him for good. The firefight had stopped. There were no more sounds coming out from behind the planes. We were alone. Javier was gone. Escaped into the desert.</p><p>I didn\u2019t want to live in fear anymore.</p><p>\u201cI have to find him,\u201d I growled and started running toward the way we came in, my eyes searching high and low for him and only seeing other bodies instead. Camden ran after me, our footsteps echoing in the boneyard.</p><p>Suddenly Javier stepped out from behind a jet engine.</p><p>His hands above his head.</p><p>And Gus behind him, a gun in each hand, aimed at Javier\u2019s head.</p><p>Just like me.</p><p>Like father, like daughter.</p><p>I had no idea how he found us but I was sure as hell glad he did.</p><p>Javier, to his credit, did seem scared as he looked between the two of us, four guns trained on him. And this time, my hands were as steady as the rocks around us.</p><p>Still, Javier nodded at Camden and said, \u201cYou made it. That was lucky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up,\u201d I sneered. \u201cGive me a good reason why I shouldn\u2019t kill you for good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr why I shouldn\u2019t,\u201d Gus spoke up.</p><p>Javier eyed Camden, who only crossed his arms on his chest and shrugged. \u201cA fifth gun would be overkill,\u201d Camden remarked.</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of,\u201d I said, looking over Javier\u2019s shoulder at Gus, \u201cshoot for the head. He\u2019s wearing a vest.\u201d</p><p>Javier looked at me in shock.</p><p>I waved my guns at him and in the direction of the fence. \u201cWalk,\u201d I commanded. \u201cKeep your hands above your head.\u201d</p><p>I nodded for Gus to lower his weapons, to leave us alone. This was between Javier and I.</p><p>Javier slowly turned around, his brow furrowed in confusion and now I got to jab my gun into his back.</p><p>\u201cKeep going,\u201d I said. \u201cAll the way to the fence. Stay turned around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAngel,\u201d Javier said, fear breaking in his voice. \u201cI saved your Camden for you. I did it for you.\u201d</p><p>I walked over to him, until I was right behind him. I could hear Gus and Camden hovering nervously in the distance, but to their credit they didn\u2019t say anything and they stayed where they were.</p><p>\u201cI know you did,\u201d I told him, right into his ear, the back of his hair tickling my face. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what makes you and I so tragic. Don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAngel,\u201d he pleaded.</p><p>I pressed the gun into the back of his neck.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t ever call me angel again. Because I am not your angel. And my wings aren\u2019t dirty.\u201d</p><p>I pulled my mouth away from his ear. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t have your soul. But if it\u2019s out there, you might want to find it, before it\u2019s too late.\u201d</p><p>I quickly bent down and pulled the pair of handcuffs out of my boot, the same ones he\u2019d used on me last night. I flicked a cuff open, his eyes widening in surprise, his body shaking slightly.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get any wrong ideas,\u201d I said. \u201cThat kinky shit is over.\u201d</p><p>I snapped one cuff over his wrist and snapped the other to the chain-link fence, his hand held slightly above his head. He turned and stared at me absolutely flabbergasted.</p><p>I stepped back and grinned happily at him. \u201cI really hope you\u2019ve been bribing the DEA agents well, Javier Bernal. Because you are going to need a lot of help to get out of this one.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cYou can\u2019t leave me here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust be glad you\u2019re intact enough to leave behind,\u201d I said. \u201cPuta conya,\u201d I swore in Spanish, spitting at his feet.</p><p>Then I turned to look at Camden and Gus who were staring at me with a mix of awe and surprise. My men. My wonderful men. I blinked back a few tears, then walked over to them.</p><p>\u201cTime to get the hell out of here?\u201d I asked.</p><p>They nodded in unison. Camden grabbed my hand. And together we ran out through the hole in the fence and across the desert floor.</p><p>I didn\u2019t look back at Javier.</p><p>Gus had parked his car right where I had left the Mini.</p><p>\u201cHow did you find us?\u201d I asked, wiping the dust and sweat off my brow. In the distance I could hear helicopters, probably the DEA and the feds. They were going to have a field day once they got their hands on Javier. The leader of Los Zetas, caught right in their own backyard.</p><p>Gus looked at me like I was an idiot. \u201cTracking device. Haven\u2019t you learned anything, Ellie girl?\u201d</p><p>Camden\u2019s head snapped up. \u201cWhere\u2019s Ben?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s fine,\u201d Gus said. \u201cMy friend has him. You guys get in and follow me.\u201d He eyed the sky, hearing the choppers too. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to be quick about this.\u201d</p><p>Camden got behind the steering wheel and I climbed in the passenger side as Gus got into his car and roared out of the desert.</p><p>\u201cYou okay to drive?\u201d I asked him, knowing he could have a cracked rib even if the bullet didn\u2019t go through.</p><p>He gave me a cocky smile. \u201cBaby, I\u2019m Camden McQueen.\u201d</p><p>I grinned back. \u201cOkay, then let\u2019s make this fast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good at that,\u201d he said, winking at me as he floored the Coop forward, growling after Gus\u2019s trail. \u201cRemember? Best five minutes of your life?\u201d</p><p>I put my hand over his. \u201cLet\u2019s make it the best fifty years of my life. And then some.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be the best of everything.\u201d</p><p>Calexico\u2019s \u201cFortune Teller\u201d came on the radio, bringing back a million memories, all of them rising up with the sand around us, flying forever into the atmosphere. I looked though the sunroof up at the impossibly blue sky, the color of Camden\u2019s eyes, and smiled to myself.</p><p>He was alive.</p><p>I was alive.</p><p>We had our lives left to live.</p><p>New paths.</p><p>New journeys.</p><p>New hope.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go say hi to Ben,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>We left the desert behind us in a cloud of dust.</p><p>EPILOGUE</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a beautiful tattoo,\u201d the barista behind the counter said, looking down at the woman\u2019s leg.</p><p>The woman looked down at herself. She\u2019d taken to wearing shorter skirts lately, even though the wind off the Pacific was known to flip them up at a moment\u2019s notice and flash the world your underwear. The woman didn\u2019t care though. Her legs were now a work of art.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d the woman said with a gracious smile. She was a stunning woman in her early thirties, high cheekbones, dark brown eyes and long blonde hair that cascaded down her back. Her face was tanned from days spent outside, sunscreen no match for the Californian sun.</p><p>\u201cI love cherry blossoms,\u201d the barista commented, handing the woman her massive caf\u00e9 mocha. \u201cAnd I love that moon in the middle of it all.\u201d</p><p>The woman smiled to herself, not wanting to share the whole story with the barista. There wasn\u2019t many people she could tell the truth to, that the tattoo of the moon was not only for the man who inked it there but to cover up the scars of a bullet wound. The coast north of San Francisco wasn\u2019t exactly known for high crime, unless you counted Eureka, but no one ever counted that.</p><p>\u201cWhere did you get the tattoos done?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know a guy,\u201d she said slyly. \u201cHas a shop in Gualala. Only works part time though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love Gualala,\u201d the barista exclaimed. \u201cThey have an amazing barbeque joint there. Really quiet though. You live near there?\u201d</p><p>The woman nodded, eager to get away from the Chatty Kathy. \u201cI do. But I work up and down the coast. Makes driving down to Bodega Bay worth it just to get Starbucks.\u201d</p><p>She then thanked the barista and left before she had to start talking about her job. Not that she minded, but it always made her feel a bit edgy when people asked too many questions about her.</p><p>She got in her car, a sexy black 1973 Dodge Challenger that she drove way too fast up and down Highway 1, and looked over her shoulder to the back seat to make sure her photography equipment was still there. Satisfied, she gunned the car, taking it north. Today\u2019s photography session was a pretty simple one, engagement photos on the beach, a happy young couple in love. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The woman felt a bit sad at the fact that she never got to have engagement photos. But then again, no one could do a better job than she could. She would have never been satisfied with them, and besides there was no point in photos when her wedding had been such a simple one. Just her, her husband and her father on the beach at Gualala State Park.</p><p>And their son and dog of course, two unreliable ring bearers.</p><p>She flipped through the radio stations, pausing when she heard Guano Padano over the air and grinned to herself. The little-known Italian band was finally getting some airplay in the States. She rolled down her window and stuck her head out, smiling like a fool into the waning sun.</p><p>When she finally reached the house, the sun was close to setting. She had to hurry. She hated missing sunsets.</p> <p>She parked in the gravel driveway and grabbed her camera. She looked over the edge of the dunes in front of her house and saw two children chasing each other on the sand, a dog darting between them.</p><p>Gus was sitting down on a beach blanket, having a beer and trying to throw the ball for the dog. Sammy wasn\u2019t having any of it, preferring to run down the kids instead, barking and wagging her tail.</p><p>In front of them, out in the surf, stood her husband and his strong, solid silhouette, ankle deep in the waves, watching the sun begin its descent.</p><p>Her heart bloomed and she ran down the wooden steps to the beach, her feet running through the warm sand, one of her most favorite feelings in the world.</p><p>She waved at her father as she passed him and then prepared for the onslaught of the dog as Sammy jumped up at her. The woman raised her camera in the air, knowing the dog\u2019s tendency to slobber all over it and scratched her quickly behind the ears.</p> <p>\u201cHey mom!\u201d Ben yelled, a spritely eight-year-old with dark hair and a tall build. A short attention span too. He looked to Gus, \u201cGrandpa, throw me the ball.\u201d</p><p>Gus threw it underhead and Ben caught it, just as Violet came screeching toward the woman\u2019s legs.</p><p>\u201cMommy!\u201d Violet cried out, wrapping her tiny arms around her cherry blossom tattoo. \u201cYou almost missed sunset.\u201d She was four years old and into keeping track of routine. If the slightest thing was out of place, everyone would hear about it.</p><p>\u201cBut I didn\u2019t,\u201d the woman explained happily, crouching low. She smoothed the fine blonde hair off of Violet\u2019s head and peered at her. \u201cHow are you, baby? Almost bedtime soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Violet screeched.</p><p>The woman laughed, used to this. \u201cYes. Now go say hi to Grandpa. I\u2019m going to go take a few pictures and then we\u2019ll put you to bed and read you a story.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d the girl still said but she giggled and ran away to Gus, flopping onto the towel beside him.</p><p>The woman watched her go, then straightened up and looked to the ocean.</p><p>Camden was staring at her, a big smile on his face.</p><p>She grinned right back and trotted up to him.</p><p>\u201cHey sweetheart,\u201d he said to her, opening his arm for her. She snuggled right into it, not even feeling the sharp cold of the Pacific Ocean as it crashed around their feet, then raised her head for a kiss. Camden kissed her deep and long before pulling away.</p><p>He was all dimples and blue eyes. He still took her breath away.</p><p>\u201cHow was work?\u201d he asked, putting his arm around her waist and holding her close.</p><p>She rested her head on his shoulder. \u201cGood. Couple in love. You know how that goes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUh huh,\u201d he said. \u201cLots of blow jobs.\u201d</p><p>She laughed and elbowed him. She looked over her shoulder at Ben throwing the ball for the dog, at Violet chatting Gus\u2019s ear off. He was listening with utmost patience to whatever crazy story she was concocting next.</p><p>\u201cHow did dad\u2019s date go with the woman from the bar?\u201d</p><p>Camden grinned and looked at the sunset. \u201cHe won\u2019t tell me. Which I think means it went well. I decided not to push it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood plan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou going to take some photos?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She gripped her camera, about to raise it up and capture the last sliver of sun before it disappeared, then hesitated and decided against it.</p><p>\u201cNah,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll commit it to memory this time.\u201d</p><p>They watched as the sun sank into the sea, as the waves crashed around them.</p><p>He squeezed her tight. She kissed his hand.</p><p>\u201cYou happy?\u201d she asked him quietly.</p><p>\u201cI am. Are you happy, Ellie?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>She was happy. </p> </body></html>"]
