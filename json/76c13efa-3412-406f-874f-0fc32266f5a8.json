Wake now.</p><p>I don\u2019t want to see this, not again. It\u2019s not helping me deal. This thing is broken\u2014</p><p>Oh no. No.</p><p>I sit up, shuddering, shoving the dark mop of hair out of my face, and my fingers come away wet with sweat. With trembling hands, I yank the patch away from my skull. It hurts. But then, what doesn\u2019t? What the Unit Psych calls dream therapy, I call torture. Seems too cruel to do this to someone on purpose, and I know they\u2019re going to find a way to blame me for the tech malfunction. They always do. But it\u2019s not my fault they\u2019re using gear that should\u2019ve been decommed after the Axis Wars.</p> <p>That\u2019s what I want to believe. But it\u2019s getting harder. There comes a point when you want to accept culpability simply because you\u2019re the only common denominator. So yeah, maybe it\u2019s my fault. I push to my feet, off the sleep-mat, restless, haunted, although they proved a long time ago that it\u2019s all just electromagnetic energy, nothing spiritual. Nothing left of the soul, nothing left of him.</p><p>My AI asks, \u201cLights on, Sirantha Jax?\u201d</p><p>Such a polite Unit spy. The fragging thing reports everything I do, every time I roll over, probably every time I take a piss.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I tell it, and the soft yellow glow, simulated sunrise on the most hospitable of the tier worlds, fills my cell.</p><p>Oh, they wouldn\u2019t call it a cell. These are my quarters, provided gratis, while my Unit assesses the damage to my psyche, decides whether I\u2019m whole enough to run. But I\u2019m incarcerated, even if I\u2019m being watched by an AI instead of a hulking brute. There are prisons without bars and worlds without sunlight. I didn\u2019t know about either one until I joined the Corp.</p><p>I pace ten by ten, and when I reach the door, the AI inquires, \u201cShall I summon an escort for you, Sirantha Jax?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d Wheeling away, I head back to the sleep-mat and sit down, legs furled.</p><p>To the AI, I\u2019m sure it looks as though I\u2019m meditating. In fact, I\u2019m envisioning ways to execute something that is not, technically, alive. Perhaps the introduction of a virus into its system...I\u2019ll have to think about it some more.</p><p>An escort.</p><p>Clearly, I can\u2019t be trusted. If I were allowed to roam the station, I\u2019d jump the first freighter I found bound for the Outskirts. Desert. Frag my contract. And they can\u2019t let that happen, not until they determine whether the accident was, in fact, my fault. And they won\u2019t let me go until they know whether my mind is fried and I can\u2019t run anymore.</p><p>The first thing carries a prison sentence. I\u2019ll be shipped off to Whitefish before I hardly know the judgment\u2019s been handed down. It\u2019ll be some smug bastard who\u2019s never been off New Terra, hearing my case via uplink. I don\u2019t know if they\u2019ve gotten to that point yet, don\u2019t know if barristers are involved. I should be consulted for my defense if they make me stand civ trial, but since I am Corp, if it comes to that, they\u2019ll probably handle it internally, and in which case I\u2019ll end up spaced.</p><p>Yeah, I\u2019ve got the J-gene. And it\u2019s rare. But if it seems like it\u2019s my fault, that god-awful mess on Matins IV, they\u2019re going to make sure not a whisper of it gets out. Kai...he\u2019s dead already. So he isn\u2019t talking. This leaves me marching out an air lock to keep shit nice and quiet, keep the Corp squeaky clean.</p><p>Funny, the shiny adverts that get us to sign on the dotted line never show what bastards the COs are.</p><p>Thinking like that makes me sweat. Feel it running down the divots in my spine to pool in the small of my back, clammy beneath the air refreshers blowing down on me. Maybe it was my fault, but I don\u2019t want to die, even if I deserve to.</p> <p>And I could answer the second question right now. Not that anybody\u2019s asked me. I can jack in. I can jump.</p><p>I just don\u2019t want to anymore.</p><p>I\u2019m scared.</p><p>It\u2019s been a week since I heard another human voice. Not counting my AI\u2014I swear programmers code them to be annoying, pedantic little fucks. Oh sure, I could summon an escort to walk me around the promenade, but everyone on station knows what that means. I\u2019m not going to entertain the Corp bureaucrats for even a millisecond. Instead I\u2019m pacing and not sleeping except when I\u2019m forced to dream therapy by the Unit Psych, via sedation and veiled threats. Crying and eating choclaste, a synth-food with no sugar, no caffeine, and only burns your tongue slightly after you\u2019ve eaten it.</p><p>I don\u2019t need a mirror to know I\u2019m a wreck. Coarse black hair standing up in long scruffy ringlets, skin pallid from lack of sunlight, and let\u2019s not forget the circles beneath my eyes. I\u2019ve lost four kilos since I came on station, extracted from the wreckage on Matins IV. They didn\u2019t need to tell me Kai was dead; I was there.</p><p>And yet they did, with excruciating, patronizing precision. Fragging bastards.</p><p>Four different Psychs came to talk with me, that first day while I was lying helpless in the med bay. One of them wanted to know if I could describe the smell of burning human flesh. The Corp is full of those types, who in another time would\u2019ve been chopping up their neighbors and burying them beneath the porch. Now they receive specialized certifications and go to work inside our heads.</p><p>For a while, I pretend to meditate, giving the room-bot nothing to report. And as I\u2019m sitting there, mimicking serenity I don\u2019t feel, my door chime sounds. The AI informs me, \u201cYou have a visitor, Sirantha Jax. Allow entry?\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s either a Psych or a CO; nobody else has clearance. Mentally I shrug, and say aloud, \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>The AI objects: \u201cI am not programmed to evaluate the prudence of an action, Sirantha Jax. Allow entry?\u201d</p><p>I sigh. \u201cYeah. Allow entry.\u201d</p><p>At this point, anything is better than waiting. I don\u2019t get up as the door glides open, then I wish I had. Because it\u2019s nobody I expected, nobody I know. He\u2019s tall, seems taller because I\u2019m sitting down, and he has a rough-hewn, authoritative face, the look you see on men who are accustomed to getting their own way, always. Doesn\u2019t look as if he\u2019s ever cracked a smile, grave as well, the grave. But he\u2019s not a Psych, and he appears to be in civ clothing, so not a CO, either. Shit, he\u2019s probably a barrister, which means I\u2019m soon to be a whitefish, no daylight and no parole.</p><p>He looks me over, assessing my thin, foxy face and sharp chin. My nose is too long, and a fresh scar bisects my left cheek. I know he\u2019s registering the dark hair, light eyes combo that marks my distinctive heterozygous genotype, tied to the J-gene. Mine are icy gray, ringed in silver. Wolf eyes, Kai used to call them. Remembering that fills me with almost unbearable anguish, and the only reason I\u2019m not sniveling again, while stuffing another square of choclaste in my mouth is because this guy is watching me.</p><p>\u201cHave a seat,\u201d I say, and I\u2019m glad I sound calmer than I feel.</p><p>He\u2019s got the choice of dropping down onto my sleep-mat with me or sitting in the only chair, over by the desk. They didn\u2019t go overboard with furnishings and took away anything I could conceivably use to injure myself. I\u2019m surprised when he hitches up his meticulously tailored trousers and plops down next to me. I\u2019d have figured him for a chair man, all the way, which just goes to show you can\u2019t judge by appearances. Or rather, you shouldn\u2019t because you\u2019ll be wrong a lot.</p><p>Assuming the lotus position, he still doesn\u2019t say a word, and just as I\u2019m thinking this is getting weird, he cants his head toward his open palm. I lean over so I can read something that\u2019s inked onto his hand:</p><p>Say nothing for 60 seconds.</p><p>I raise my head, about to say, Are you shitting me? when his dark eyes catch mine, irresistible intensity. His look bores into me, and damned if I can say a word for that entire minute. It\u2019s like he\u2019s willing me to silence, a feat that others have attempted numerous times, and failed.</p><p>\u201cIf everything has gone well,\u201d he says at last, \u201cthen our people have sent your AI into its maintenance cycle. Still, our time is limited.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if everything hasn\u2019t gone well?\u201d That isn\u2019t what I want to ask. I want to know who the hell he is. Despite myself, I glance over the terminal, flashing blue, the color code of routine maintenance.</p><p>\u201cThen someone would already be here to arrest us.\u201d He flashes me a decidedly saturnine smile. Yeah, that word suits him.</p><p>Huh, wonder why I\u2019m not reassured.</p><p>CHAPTER 2</p><p>I\u2019m just staring at him, mouth half-open. As soon as I realize it, I find something to say, anything. \u201cWho the hell are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarch,\u201d he tells me.</p><p>\u201cThat a name or an order?\u201d The smart-ass answer comes naturally, even as I\u2019m trying to figure out his angle. What matters is why he\u2019s here, and I\u2019m not sure why I haven\u2019t queried him.</p><p>Maybe it\u2019s because I know it can mean nothing good, this illicit entry to my cell, and this is a way of postponing my all-but-inevitable hop from the frying pan to the fire. Such a quaint descriptive when we\u2019ve been cooking with molecular agitation for so long, but in my circumstance it\u2019s just too apropos.</p><p>Besides, he\u2019ll tell me anyway. His type always does. He has an agenda, and it doesn\u2019t matter a damn whether I\u2019m on board with it. Doubt anyone\u2019s ever told him no and made it stick.</p><p>\u201cTake your pick,\u201d he says, shrugging. \u201cWe need to get you out. You have three minutes to decide, Ms. Jax, and the clock is ticking. How tight is procedure here?\u201d</p><p>When the AI comes out of its maintenance subroutine to find (a) an unapproved visitor or (b) Sirantha Jax missing, Klaxons are going to make this place sound like a bunker in wartime. But I shrug. Honestly, I have no idea. Perlas Station isn\u2019t anywhere I\u2019ve set foot before, and it wasn\u2019t a conscious choice this time. This was simply the closest port from Matins IV, where the salvage crew found me, quite inconveniently, alive. I\u2019ve often wondered why they didn\u2019t just finish the job and let the accident go unexplained, a tragedy that the Corp could sweep beneath the metaphorical rug. Dead men tell no tales, and dead women tie up loose ends.</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you think I\u2019m going to leave with you?\u201d Even as I say it, I\u2019m thinking about it, and I\u2019m aware of the seconds winding down. I have to decide fast. If I don\u2019t leave, Newel, the Psych who asked me to describe burning human flesh, yes, that one...he\u2019s coming again today. He\u2019ll be overseeing my \u201ctreatment,\u201d now and forever.</p><p>Deep down I know it\u2019s move or die. Haven\u2019t I been imagining desertion the whole time I\u2019ve been locked up in here? Trying to figure out a way to escape? And now it\u2019s been handed to me, I\u2019m like a caged bird, afraid to venture beyond the bars, terrified of what lies beyond. That\u2019s new. I didn\u2019t used to feel like that, used to be the first to dive into free fall.</p><p>Maybe this is a trap. Maybe they want me to do this, and I\u2019ll be killed during my escape attempt. But at least this way, I have a chance. Here in this cell, I\u2019m a trapped rat, and given the choice, I\u2019ll always opt to go down fighting. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBecause you have to. They\u2019re not investigating anything, Ms. Jax. This isolation and the so-called dream therapy they\u2019re forcing you to undergo, it\u2019s not standard. They\u2019re trying to break you. They don\u2019t want to know what happened; they just want to make sure you\u2019re in no condition to talk about it. Ever. And when you crack beneath the stress, they\u2019ll write you off and bury you beneath piles of policy. Ninety seconds, Ms. Jax.\u201d</p><p>With an inward jolt, I realize he\u2019s right. Nothing they\u2019ve done to me is conducive to healing. That\u2019s not the goal at all. Most likely, I was supposed to fall apart by now. What jumper could live without her pilot and not go mad? Especially when forced to relive the event, over and over and\u2014</p><p>When I cracked, I wasn\u2019t going to be sent to Whitefish. Instead, I\u2019d wind up in the Corp asylum where they hide the broken ones. All of us snap, sooner or later\u2014you can\u2019t spend so much time jacked into grimspace without losing part of yourself. Jumpers know the risks and yet the drive toward exploration, the need to be the first to see a new rim world, make first planetfall with our pilots, these things fire us along an ultimately self-destructive course. We\u2019re a little crazy, the J-gene carriers, or we wouldn\u2019t be able to handle grimspace in the first place.</p><p>With that, I make my decision and push to my feet. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p> <p>There\u2019s nothing here I want. All my personal effects burned up on Matins IV, and so I\u2019m ready to follow this guy into the unknown, trusting wherever he\u2019s taking me is better than where I am. That\u2019s a hell of a hope to pin on a stranger.</p><p>I half expect him to want to talk some more or outline a plan, but he\u2019s on his feet as well, expedience ruling the day. That\u2019s a welcome change from the bureaucratic bullshit I\u2019ve dealt with for the last ten days. I doubt the COs wipe their asses without forms in triplicate.</p><p>\u201cNeed you out of the uniform,\u201d he tells me, so brisk that I don\u2019t think even for a moment he\u2019s angling to get a look at the body beneath. \u201cThey\u2019ll probably guess you\u2019re making for the docking bays, but it\u2019ll help if they can\u2019t get a vis-ID at a glance.\u201d</p><p>He intends me to strip, but I know it\u2019s not prurient interest. Even before, I wasn\u2019t anything special to look at: lean, strong, and energetic, a good partner in bed, but not because I was beautiful. I think that might be tied to the J-gene as well, the hunger for sensation. People don\u2019t understand my loss; the Psychs poke at it with morbid curiosity. Intellectually they know it\u2019s bad for a jumper when her pilot dies, but they don\u2019t understand the relationship.</p><p>Imagine for a moment\u2014lover and brother and guardian and partner and\u2014</p> <p>There are no words. Even if a jumper never sleeps with her pilot, there are still bonds that can\u2019t be articulated to the layman. He\u2019s the one who watches while you\u2019re lost in grimspace, the hands on the ship controls that interpret your signals as you cue the jumps. Every time you jack in, he\u2019s the reason you come out safe again. Perfect trust, perfect symbiosis; there comes a time when words aren\u2019t necessary anymore.</p><p>Well, I can\u2019t waste any more time on hesitation. March hands me a plain brown coverall, and I change quickly under his watchful eyes. My whole body\u2019s webbed with faint purple burn scars, souvenirs of the crash, so if he has any sense, he\u2019ll look away. But he doesn\u2019t. He just stares, eyes on mine. I don\u2019t trust him, and he doesn\u2019t seem to like me, so we make a perfect match. Dressed, I look like a san service worker.</p><p>He finishes the makeshift disguise with a bottle of Spray-bond, aerosol colorant used by part-timer punkers who want to be able to wash out their weekend revels and return to the office looking respectable. In my case, dark hair goes grungy gray, and suddenly I\u2019ve aged twenty-five years. It\u2019s not hard to alter how I move because I feel physically stiff from my incarceration. At a nod from him, I stuff the Corp gear down the recycler, and then he manually keys the door open.</p><p>\u201cUnauthorized exit from crew quarters!\u201d my AI sings out maybe thirty seconds later as alarms begin to sound. I feel faint satisfaction at having thwarted it, even as we move off. \u201cUnauthorized access to artificial intelligence Q-15. Recommend initiation of lockdown. Unauthorized personnel detected in detention level C.\u201d</p><p>In the distance I hear booted feet coming to investigate. Shit. We hasten down into the corridor, and I can\u2019t tell what time of day it is because the artificial lights never alter. Station life would drive me crazy. I need a natural cycle, which is why I often linger planetside after Kai and I\u2014flinch away from that thought, as I follow March at a dead run. God, I hope that\u2019s not a prophetic thought.</p><p>The Psychs don\u2019t realize the reason I\u2019m not completely nuts, since I\u2019ve been running a lot longer than most, is that my early life granted me the ability to compartmentalize. Just shut stuff off, lock it away. In a room inside my head part of me may, in fact, already be gibbering mad, but I don\u2019t let that one out to howl. Just like part of me mourns Kai, curled up in a corner, sobbing like a child. And the rest of me functions.</p> <p>Just like now. Can\u2019t help wondering what I\u2019ve gotten myself into, but then I\u2019ve never been one to wait around. And just what in the hell does he want with me\u2014if this isn\u2019t a Corp trap? I have a bad feeling and a stitch in my side, but March isn\u2019t breaking stride, and damned if I\u2019ll let him outrun me.</p><p>Right before the first checkpoint, a pair of Corp security drones stumbles on us, and he never slows, diving between their blue laser fire like this is all part of the job, coming up beneath in their blind spot. Brute force\u2014he crushes them together, smashing their sensors, so their feed to the security station goes black, then he slams them again in a spray of sparks. I hear the low whir of their tiny thrusters slowing, then they drop, heavy, inert. Maybe two corridors over I hear more booted feet. They\u2019re coming to investigate the outage of the two drones.</p><p>\u201cMove,\u201d he tells me fiercely as the second set of alarms kick in.</p><p>Orange alert? Holy shit.</p><p>That means they don\u2019t care if they take us alive.</p><p>Up till now, I had always thought of the Corp as a friendly Big Brother, hand out to help, interested in exploration, in science and discovery. And sure, they had a military arm, but that was for defense and protection, not for assault. Now I\u2019m wondering just what I don\u2019t know about the Corp, what else they do, quiet and smiling, while yokels lap up their adorable ad campaigns about little boys pointing at the heavens in awe as a shooting star carries the Corp logo overhead.</p><p>\u201cIf they\u2019ve gone into lockdown, we won\u2019t be able to use the doors,\u201d I pant, as he makes for the security station at a brisk walk, not unlike the pace one would use if a bit pressed for time for a moderately important business meeting. \u201cAre you crazy? We\u2019re going to have to fight our way through half the Corp\u2014\u201d</p><p>He ignores me and lays out the first guard with a hard hook before the poor bastard hardly registers we\u2019re there. Even with alarms sounding, you just don\u2019t expect a man in a suit to fight like a gladiator; you expect him to stride up, and say politely, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m quite turned about. Do you know where the lift is to the hydroponics gardens?\u201d The second man, March takes by the throat and stares into his eyes. I don\u2019t know what the frag that was about, but the man just crumples, lying up against the wall as if he\u2019s about to piss himself. And once more, March keys the door open, and he\u2019s hauling for the next point without looking back.</p> <p>We pass two more security doors exactly like that while Klaxons blare and more teams deploy. One hand on my cramping side, I can\u2019t help but think this is the crappiest rescue I\u2019ve ever seen and I want answers, not that I\u2019m a hundred percent sure I needed rescuing. Maybe that was lack of sleep and paranoia and the general creepiness of Psych Officer Newel. I may have just fragged up and made things way worse for myself, ruined my career and put my fate in the hands of a maniac.</p><p>As we hit the freighter bays, a gray squad opens fire. They aren\u2019t telling us to halt or to surrender. Mother Mary of Anabolic Grace, they really want to fry us. I dive in behind a ship and growl at March, \u201cYou owe me some serious answers if we get out of this alive.\u201d</p><p>He shoves me toward the boarding ramp of a cutter that\u2019s seen better days. From his manner and the way he\u2019s dressed, I expected a big hauler or a sporty little cruiser, something with a high price tag and a lot of amenities. Not this junk bucket that looks like it should\u2019ve been decommed before the Axis Wars. The gray squad closes on us with military precision, using cover and working the perimeter in a metric circle. Soon they\u2019ll be on us, boarding the ship. A laser blast sears the metal at my feet, and I fall back, farther up the ramp.</p><p>Talk about ass choices. I\u2019ve got this shit bucket and a nutcase or a bunch of gray men coming for me.</p><p>He reads my look and shrugs. \u201cHowever she looks, this ship is sound. Can you jump, Ms. Jax? Our lives depend on it.\u201d</p><p>Jump? But I don\u2019t have a pilot.</p><p>My look or my mind? Because he adds, \u201cYes, you do.\u201d</p><p>My throat tightens, and I feel a fist curling around my intestines. It\u2019s a cramp, rising nausea. It\u2019s being told you have to remarry before your husband\u2019s cold in the grave. Before I can say a word, he boards. No more conversation. It\u2019s up to me now. Stay or go. Reluctantly, I admire the fact that he doesn\u2019t bullshit, doesn\u2019t explain, doesn\u2019t persuade. Maybe he knows I can\u2019t resist a mystery or a challenge or both. Or maybe he just knows I\u2019m not looking to die today, because the gray men are almost on me.</p><p>I follow.</p><p>CHAPTER 3</p><p>The inside of the ship restores my faith in benevolent deities.</p><p>Controls are new, shiny, and everything\u2019s well maintained, clean, from the corridors to the cockpit. It\u2019s almost like they\u2019re using the exterior as camo, nothing to see here, just another struggling ship. And that\u2019s probably not too far from the truth.</p><p>It\u2019s an eight-seater, at least I see that many places where crew can strap in for a jump. Possibly she could carry more, but there\u2019d be no guarantee what would become of them while passing through grimspace. Generally, only refugees are desperate enough to take the risk. But there aren\u2019t six other people on board. In fact, I just see three, now gazing at me, although there may be more in medical or the holds.</p><p>\u201cI got her,\u201d March says, as the boarding ramp seals behind us. \u201cUse the override launch codes Mair gave us, and let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>I can hear the impact of gray-squad lasers striking the hull. Luckily, the Corp\u2019s response time isn\u2019t good here on Perlas; they\u2019ve grown complacent, unable to imagine anyone could challenge their authority or breach their security. Something tells me\u2014times they are a-changing.</p><p>The others busy themselves right away, as if there\u2019s no question he\u2019s in charge. While they\u2019re not talking to me, I study them one by one: an older man with the heavy musculature that signals an upbringing on a high-G world and another man of indeterminate years, slim and androgynous. The older man, silver hair, neat goatee, runs a device across my temple and smiles. \u201cPositive ID,\u201d he tells someone over a comm unit, and I\u2019m left staring at him in bewilderment. Last, there\u2019s a woman around my age, blond, butch. She regards me with open animosity, and for a moment, I can\u2019t breathe, just scorched by the look in her gray eyes, but then the look\u2019s broken like someone cutting a live wire. There\u2019s even a resultant explosion. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShit,\u201d she says, leaning down to punch some things into a terminal, pulling up maps and grids. Even I know that the blinking red square is not a good sign.</p><p>The older man takes off at a dead run in response, and March disappears through a sliding door. Not much for talking, that one. Yeah, okay, I understand\u2014action\u2019s imperative. But still, I\u2019ve been in solitary for over a week; I want to know something about the people taking me away. Is that too much to ask?</p><p>Shit, it is. Someone\u2019s finally thought to get the freighter bay turrets online, and the hull\u2019s now being hammered. We\u2019ve got to get out of here. Like, ten minutes ago.</p><p>Of them all, I have no idea who my pilot is supposed to be. That\u2019s not a good sign. A jumper is supposed to feel instant rapport\u2014how else can I trust him? The Corp offers hundreds of candidates up for evaluation. In its way, the relationship is more important than marriage, more lasting and more vital to my welfare. I had a husband once, but he couldn\u2019t handle coming second to Kai, and he left me, several spins before I actually noticed he was gone.</p> <p>I\u2019m not ready for a new pilot, not even one hundred percent sure I can do this. I mean, I\u2019m not fried. It\u2019s not that. There comes a point in every jumper\u2019s life where she knows she\u2019s at the limit\u2014next time she jacks into grimspace, she\u2019s not coming back. Navigating those beacons will be the last thing she does, but it\u2019s like being an addict to almost any chem. You know it\u2019s killing you slowly, but you can\u2019t quit, don\u2019t even want to, because the pleasure outweighs your fear of consequences.</p><p>And I guess most of us would rather go out in a blaze of glory, burned-out, than to be one of the saddest folks alive, someone who used to own grimspace and knows she can\u2019t anymore. Knows. I haven\u2019t hit that boundary yet myself, but I don\u2019t think I want to retire. I didn\u2019t become a jumper to die old and gray.</p><p>But there\u2019s a knot in my stomach, and I feel like I\u2019m waiting in a seedy hostel for a stranger, unfaithful, like all the years with Kai, first friends, then lovers\u2014so much more\u2014meant nothing. My palms feel damp, cold, and I wipe them on my thighs while the ship shakes. Before, it was all exhilaration, pitting myself against phenomenal odds and coming out with my mind intact, guiding my ship and crew safely to our destination. I\u2019m the reason we rule the star lanes, me. Sirantha Jax. Well, me, and folks like me, J-gene carriers. There\u2019s so few of us; we\u2019re treated like Corp royalty.</p><p>Until we burn out.</p><p>Until we kill our pilots and crew and have to run\u2014</p> <p>Enough.</p><p>\u201cWhere the frag is Jemus?\u201d March emerges in fatigues, a black shirt, and a combat jacket, which make him look bigger, meaner but compelling, a fact I resent because I hate how he superimposes himself over Kai\u2019s memory, just standing there. This gear suits him better than formality, strips away all pretense of civility and civilization. Kai was slim and boyish, no matter his age. He was, in fact, three years my senior when he died, but nobody would\u2019ve ever guessed. \u201cAnd why aren\u2019t you in the nav chair yet?\u201d To me.</p><p>\u201cBad news,\u201d The woman says, looking grim. \u201cThe turrets did some damage in the holds and the power coupling\u2014\u201d</p><p>March grits his teeth. \u201cIf something needs repair, get your ass down there and fix it. What the hell does that have to do with\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you shut your gob, you dickless wonder, I\u2019ll tell you what it has to do with Jemus.\u201d The ship rocks, and I grab on to the safety harnesses that hang like webbing from the cabin ceiling. \u201cWe\u2019re screwed, stranded, and no repairs are going to help.\u201d She brings up an image on-screen, clearly from medical, and even I can tell that the guy on the table isn\u2019t getting up. His head\u2019s, well, open.</p><p>Please don\u2019t tell me that was my pilot.</p> <p>\u201cWhy me?\u201d I say aloud.</p><p>\u201cWhat the frag was he doing in the holds?\u201d March growls, pacing like a caged animal. We\u2019re losing precious time; the ship\u2019s going to open up like an Old Terra tin can if we keep sitting here.</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t\u2014wouldn\u2019t\u2014fly without his lucky hat. One of the san bots took it to storage because he left it in the lounge the last time we played mah-jongg,\u201d the doc puts in quietly. I hadn\u2019t realized we were on a two-way feed, but it makes sense. He steps away from the body with a heavy sadness that makes me like him instinctively.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t there anything we can do?\u201d They all look at me as if surprised to learn I have a voice. \u201cGet weapons online, something.\u201d</p><p>The young man with the disquieting eyes tells me, \u201cAll that would accomplish is a wanton waste of life. I\u2019m Loras.\u201d</p><p>Seems like an odd time to be thinking of introductions, but what the hell. \u201cSirantha Jax.\u201d</p><p>To my surprise, the blond woman answers, although she doesn\u2019t say it\u2019s nice to meet me. \u201cDina, ship\u2019s mechanic, part-time gunner, engineer, whatever needs fixing.\u201d She indicates the vid display with a tilt of her head. \u201cThe doc is Saul. And now you know the names of all the people you\u2019ve killed. Maybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrag you,\u201d I tell her, without even asking what she means. Frag her for thinking she knows what happened on Matins IV. She wasn\u2019t there. I\u2019m the sole survivor, and even I\u2019m not altogether sure. My dreams tell different stories, day to day. I\u2019m not certain I can trust any of them.</p> <p>Dina adds to him, though she\u2019s still looking at me, \u201cAfter the Sargasso, I can\u2019t believe we have her on board. When you heard Svet died in the crash, you said\u2014\u201d</p><p>Shit. I\u2019ve run away with people with a grudge, and hell, maybe they have cause. I brace because this woman seems ready to gouge my eyes out.</p><p>\u201cDammit.\u201d The word sounds wrenched from March. Dina and I both turn, on the verge of going after each other, even with the ship about to come down around our ears. \u201cI can do it,\u201d he adds, in the tone of a man who has volunteered to be fed to the giant thing that lives in the volcano. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a pilot?\u201d Dina regards him with puzzlement and dawning hope.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t answer her, glaring at me like this is my fault. March\u2014whatever reason he took it up, whatever reason he stopped, he wasn\u2019t a pilot for the thrills, like Kai, no he\u2019s an older archetype, dating all the way back to the conqueror Cortez. It\u2019s not enough to discover new lands, but he has to see the natives bend at the knee, too.</p><p>The fact that I have to place my life in his hands makes me sick to my stomach. I\u2019d never have chosen him, not in a thousand years. There\u2019s too much dominance in him, too much that doesn\u2019t care what\u2019s damaged as long as he gets his way. And I think he knows my reaction by virtue of my expression or some alchemy that I haven\u2019t pinned down. He doesn\u2019t seem like a typical Psi, but he reads my thoughts too close for comfort.</p><p>\u201cGet your ass in the cockpit,\u201d he says. \u201cWe came a long fragging way, and we\u2019re not stopping here just because you aren\u2019t sure you like me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s the jumper who got you here?\u201d</p><p>Finally, it comes to me, the question that\u2019s been bugging me. Outside the ship he said, Can you jump? Our lives depend on it. Perlas is too deep for any ship to hit without jumping; there isn\u2019t a far cruiser outfitted that can haul the straight space between those two points. People have died trying. So why then does everything hang on me?</p><p>Another explosion; shit, we don\u2019t have time for this. The ship won\u2019t hold much longer. Dina hisses, and I wheel on her, instinctively bracing. She really wants to rush me now, I can tell, but instead she just exchanges a laden look with March, who nods. Giving permission?</p><p>\u201cIt was her last run,\u201d the other woman tells me in a voice sharp and hard as the surface of Ielos, a winter world on the rim.</p><p>Last run.</p><p>March knows the moment I parse that. Their jumper understood that it was suicide\u2014that she\u2019d never make it out of grimspace intact, not this time. Thus gambling their fate on getting me on board, getting me in the nav chair. When did I become someone worth dying for?</p><p>This changes everything. They sacrificed their jumper to get me out of here, so we\u2019re going. I\u2019ll jump. She died for me. Intellectually, I know someone on this crew put her down, like an Old Terra horse whose wind\u2019s been broken. Too great a heart, body can\u2019t contain it. It\u2019s a kindness most don\u2019t have the guts to perform.</p><p>\u201cWhat was her name?\u201d I need to know.</p><p>\u201cEdaine.\u201d It\u2019s the woman who answers me, once again.</p><p>I can see in her eyes that she\u2019s grieving. That\u2019s why she hates me. It isn\u2019t personal so much as the fact that Edaine died for me, and Dina wasn\u2019t ready to let her go. Whether they were lovers or the mechanic simply loved her, it\u2019s not my business. But I can respect loss. Understand it. This ship isn\u2019t ready for a new jumper any more than I\u2019m ready for a new pilot. Something flickers in my brain pan, part of my classical Old Terra education, long since discarded for the thrill of grimspace.</p><p>He must needs go that the devil drives.</p><p>Yeah, that. Sod what we want. We\u2019ve got to play the hand we\u2019re dealt. Not so long ago, I could call my soul my own. Clean. Contracted to the Corp, sure, but I didn\u2019t owe any karmic debts. But now I\u2019ve got Kai and the rest of the crew weighing on me. Plus seventy-five souls who relied on me to transport them safely to their destination, among them the beloved Miriam Jocasta, freely elected Conglomerate representative to all the tier worlds. Now add to that body count this unknown jumper, the pilot in Med Bay, and I\u2019m feeling like a brick. I don\u2019t say another word, just head for the cockpit.</p><p>It\u2019s time.</p><p>CHAPTER 4</p><p>Try to describe grimspace for us.</p><p>At parties, when everyone\u2019s knocked back a few, there\u2019s always someone who asks me to do that. They don\u2019t seem to understand, it\u2019s like trying to define red for a blind man. If you\u2019re not a jumper, then you\u2019re blind to the most extraordinary, primordial colors. And nothing I say will help you understand.</p><p>The name\u2019s misleading. Grimspace means inexorable, implacable. Not to be appeased. You see, grimspace will have its due from all who traverse it. But it\u2019s beautiful there, or we wouldn\u2019t be drawn back, time and again, driven on by a jones stronger than anything mankind could devise. Jumpers burn out smiling for a reason.</p><p>My pretty, poisonous mistress, I\u2019m coming back.</p><p>New ship. New pilot. Same old Sirantha Jax.</p><p>I settle into the nav chair and run my hands over the interface, checking the port to make sure it\u2019s clean. Knowing that my predecessor fried right where I\u2019m sitting, well, talk about cold chills. I focus on procedure, not the fact that the ship\u2019s being bombarded. I\u2019ve never jumped under these circumstances, but I can do this. I can. Just be cool, Jax.</p><p>It occurs to me as I\u2019m setting up, ready to jack into the nav system, that it\u2019s got to be terrifying for a pilot, working with a new jumper for the first time. And who knows how long it\u2019s been for March? Meanwhile we\u2019ve got people shooting, and I\u2019m supposed to be his eyes, and he acts as my hands. For the duration of a jump, we\u2019re literally twined together via wetware, and even if I knew how, I couldn\u2019t fly the ship while I\u2019m tracking grimspace, finding beacons the old ones left along the star lanes, so long ago that we\u2019ve given up trying to date it. In trying to figure out FTL travel, someone, a long fragging time ago, discovered a better way. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Grimspace.</p><p>And so, just as I have to trust him to make the right adjustments to the controls, safeguard my body while I\u2019m seeing nothing but a world so wide that I don\u2019t have words to encompass it, he has to trust that I\u2019m not going to steer him wrong. Oddly, even though I can do it, I have only a fundamental grasp of the principles.</p><p>Jump ships all carry a phase drive that accesses the secondary space that bends distance beneath, between, whatever, two points in straight space. To get from here to there, you jump into grimspace via the phase drive, then your navigator finds the beacon nearest your destination, and you make the jump back. The beacons are like doors, portals, something, a corridor back and forth, and the phase drive, well, that\u2019s the key.</p><p>Eons after discovering its existence, we\u2019re still exploring the Star Road. That was our specialty, Kai and me. Making long jumps to places no one\u2019s ever been. Tagging new beacons. Logging what\u2019s there and providing charts for the Corp, sometimes livable worlds, sometimes gas giants, sometimes asteroid belts where a planet might have been.</p> <p>I loved it. Loved him, after a while.</p><p>Lost him.</p><p>Oh God, Kai, I\u2019m sorry, baby. It\u2019s too soon.</p><p>March is looking at me. Waiting for me to jack in. But he doesn\u2019t say anything, nothing to ease the moment but nothing to make it harder, either. He doesn\u2019t bitch at me to hurry, even though I need to, or tell me that there are lives hanging on me. There are always lives hanging on me. Maybe that\u2019s why jumpers go crazy.</p><p>Control yourself, Jax; don\u2019t let nerves get you.</p> <p>He\u2019s not Kai, never will be, but I\u2019ve got to learn to do this with him. In a way, it\u2019s more intimate than fucking a stranger because he\u2019s going to be part of me for the duration of our flight. I don\u2019t want March inside of me.</p><p>Loras speaks over the comm, calm, measured. \u201cLaunch override codes input, bay doors opening in approximately ten seconds. You\u2019ll need to hold them, though. Corp security won\u2019t permit them to remain that way long.\u201d</p><p>I feel the swerve as the ship lifts, reluctantly admire the way March handles the controls. The weapons systems come online, and he fires, disabling the bay doors. They\u2019re standing wide now, and I can see through the forward screen that the gray men are fighting vacuum; nothing about this has gone according to Corp procedure. Gray men don\u2019t boast flexibility as one of their dominant traits. They expected to stop us in the bay; we weren\u2019t supposed to get this far. But we have. One thing about gray men...they just don\u2019t quit. They\u2019re going to hunt us to the end of the galaxy.</p><p>Cheerful fragging thought.</p><p>\u201cDina, take over guns. Return fire, keep them off us.\u201d</p><p>And in a graceful spin, we\u2019re out, weapons fire coming in hard on aft shields. They\u2019re scrambling ships, but it will take time to find a jumper fit to run, and we\u2019ve got one ready to go. Me. The stars swim around us, and part of me thrills to it, even as I suck in a breath, preparing myself for March. I\u2019m a virgin on her wedding night, arranged marriage, and I\u2019ve never even given him a closed-mouth kiss.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s our destination?\u201d I ask. \u201cLet me see the star charts.\u201d</p><p>That seems to reassure him because a good jumper always wants to see the locus of two points in straight space before she tries to translate it. And I\u2019m no exception. I study the maps for a minute, noting that we\u2019re making for a habitable rim world. Lachion. It\u2019s just an outpost, really, a place to refuel, buy supplies and a whore for the night.</p><p>Taking a deep breath, I plug in.</p><p>And the cockpit disappears.</p><p>Right now I\u2019m simply blind. He\u2019s giving instructions over the comm, and I hear the crew acknowledging orders. They\u2019ve strapped in and donned their helmets. Superstitious spacers say if you don\u2019t wear your headgear during a jump, there are demons waiting to suck the soul right out of your body. While that sounds a whole lot like Old Terra sailors who believed sea monsters would eat you if you sailed over the edge of the world, I do know it\u2019s a bad idea to run unprotected.</p><p>We haven\u2019t made the jump yet, and I can feel the phase drive powering up, the trembling hum of the seat beneath my fingertips. And then March plugs in beside me, and I can feel him in ways I never wanted to. There\u2019s no give to him, even here, but I sense a self-deprecating humor that I didn\u2019t expect, and it gentles him, making him easier to bear.</p><p>You ready? He doesn\u2019t need to say it any more than I need to vocalize my response. At this moment, we\u2019re beyond all that. We\u2019re pilot and jumper, and we\u2019re going forth together.</p><p>Now.</p> <p>The world opens up to me, an orchid unfurling at accelerated speed. I think of it as the primeval soup from whence all life originally came, a maelstrom of chaos and energy, sights the human mind isn\u2019t supposed to be able to parse, let alone convert into coherent images that can be used to navigate.</p><p>Because of the J-gene I can sense the beacons, feel them pulsing like sentient life, and perhaps they are, for all I know. Perhaps if we could find their frequency, we could converse with them and discover we\u2019ve long been diving down the gullets of cosmic dragons and shooting out their cloacae to somewhere else, and guess what, they aren\u2019t exactly happy about it. On second thought, some mysteries simply shouldn\u2019t be delved into.</p><p>He senses my directives in the same oblique manner in which I\u2019m conscious of his hands on the controls. I feel him making adjustments according to what I see, a symbiosis that\u2019s never seemed more miraculous than this moment. It\u2019s an eternity; it\u2019s a heartbeat, and grimspace gazes back at me, scintillant and impossibly alluring.</p><p>That\u2019s the bait in the trap, you want to stop focusing on yourself and you want to explore in ways that aren\u2019t corporeally possible. For the first time it occurs to me\u2014perhaps burnout isn\u2019t such a dreadful thing. Perhaps it\u2019s nothing to fear at all, simply another doorway opening.</p><p>No. That\u2019s March. Rare for a pilot to risk breaking a jumper\u2019s concentration, but I sense frissons of tension rippling through him, soul deep. That\u2019s how a navigator thinks, preparing herself for the last run. You\u2019re not there. You\u2019re not.</p><p>Instinctively, I reassure him. I don\u2019t know why he gives a shit. But it hurts him to think of leaving me here. I feel it, crashing over me in waves he can\u2019t quite subdue. Maybe it\u2019s transference. He\u2019s grieving, too...for Edaine, who was his friend, if not his jumper, for someone named Svet, and for another navigator whose name I don\u2019t know. I glimpsed his myriad losses before his walls came up, and I don\u2019t know when I ever saw someone so alone.</p><p>Before this moment, I never thought about what it\u2019s like for a pilot when his jumper leaves him behind. End of the flight, and she\u2019s still in the nav chair beside him, but she\u2019s gone. The spark, radiance, whatever made her unique. Gone. I know what it\u2019s like to be left behind. And that\u2019s rare for a jumper; we don\u2019t have long life expectancies.</p><p>Almost there.</p><p>Gravitational pull. My mind\u2019s wide-open, full of flares, sheer artistry that even the best pilot cannot comprehend. At its most basic level, the universe is beautiful. We\u2019re about to slingshot through our target beacon and back out to straight space.</p><p>I\u2019ve done it.</p><p>Distantly I know that the ship\u2019s trembling beneath me again, readying itself for the second jump. And then feel it, the instant before I go blind again. Leaving grimspace hurts. But then, what doesn\u2019t?</p><p>We should be just a short cruise away from Lachion. So many outposts spring up along the Star Road, and the only thing that comes close to the feeling after a solid run is free fall. For this moment, I don\u2019t even mind that March is here, sharing my pleasure, that I\u2019m making him feel good because I do. But he\u2019s not sampling that on purpose. As soon as he can, he unplugs, and I do the same. Even though I don\u2019t know him, not even sure if I like him, I already miss him. You don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to be alone until you\u2019ve had someone inside your head.</p><p>And that, you see, is why so many pilots and jumpers wind up sleeping together. It\u2019s too much on the senses\u2014that mutual stimulation needs an outlet, and there comes a point when nobody else will do. You want to share your body the way you\u2019ve shared your mind, so many times, and the sex is better, stronger, and so intense.</p><p>Some pairs do it while jacked in, not while jumping, of course, but in the cockpit, joined both ways, writhing together, ecstasy washing back and forth in a closed circuit, constantly driving things higher. It becomes its own addiction after a while, and I\u2019ve known pilots who simply can\u2019t perform unless they\u2019re with a jumper.</p><p>Anything else is just too vanilla.</p><p>CHAPTER 5</p><p>Like he knows what I\u2019m thinking, March flicks me a scathing look as he signals the crew it\u2019s safe to unstrap from the harnesses and remove helmets. While they report back, I decide that doing me, jacked in or otherwise, is the last thing on his mind. That\u2019s good; it\u2019s a complication I neither want nor need. I stretch, conscious of no more wear and tear than a residual headache, like a day-old hangover.</p><p>I\u2019ve had worse.</p><p>Leaning forward, I take a look at our updated position on the nav charts, and yeah, we came out right on target. Lachion\u2019s less than a two-hour cruise, and I settle back to watch. Don\u2019t know what I think I\u2019ll learn, but he\u2019s good at what he does; sure, capable hands manipulating the controls, attentive to various readings. Stuff I don\u2019t understand, to be honest. I\u2019m not a pilot, although I\u2019ve spent almost half my life on board ships.</p><p>\u201cGood jump,\u201d he says finally.</p><p>And it\u2019s a surprise to hear his voice, different, more forceful. Then I could sense his uncertainties and constant grief. Now he\u2019s all steel and implacable resolve again.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it was my fault,\u201d I blurt, before I\u2019ve formed the words inside my own head. But I need to say it. I need someone to believe me. Don\u2019t know whether March is that someone, but I need some of the weight off my soul.</p><p>He cuts me a sharp look, a full ten seconds away from the control panel. \u201cMatins IV?\u201d As if there\u2019s any doubt what I mean.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d I don\u2019t look at him. Instead I stare out into straight space, nothing too fascinating there for one accustomed to wildfire. But it\u2019s better than measuring his expression, doubting my own credibility.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t think so, either,\u201d he answers, neutral.</p><p>Something in his tone tells me he\u2019s speaking more for others than himself. Having seen inside him, I can say with authority\u2014March is a man, who, if asked to capture the legendary pink orangutan of New Inglaterra, would devise a foolproof plan to catch said beast and equip himself with all necessary accoutrements, and never mind the fact that he doesn\u2019t believe in the thing. So, no, he doesn\u2019t necessarily believe me. But that doesn\u2019t matter to him because he\u2019s been asked to deliver me, and I\u2019m starting to wonder why.</p><p>\u201cWhy me?\u201d I know I don\u2019t need to clarify.</p><p>One of the advantages to the pilot/jumper bond is that even when you jack out, you carry certain awareness with you, remembrance of how your partner\u2019s mind works. He\u2019ll know what I\u2019m asking although he could choose to be an ass and feign incomprehension. I respect the fact that he doesn\u2019t. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re pretty old,\u201d he tells me, not unkindly. I\u2019ll be thirty-three this year. \u201cAnd you\u2019ve logged over five hundred successful jumps and more new charts for the Corp than any navigator ever. There are people who would like to know the secret to your success, Ms. Jax. I represent those interested parties.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd they can\u2019t find out shit from me if the Corp cracks my brain like an egg and locks me up.\u201d</p><p>Okay, so...the Corp used me for fourteen years, knowing I would eventually burn out. And I said yes because I wanted adventure and excitement, wanted off New Terra. I wanted the universe; why should I settle for one boring man and a passel of kids? And now, someone wants to use me to find out why I haven\u2019t burned out yet. You know, I\u2019m a bit tired of being used. They\u2019re going to learn I\u2019m not the easy mark they anticipate.</p><p>March offers that saturnine smile again. \u201cJust so. We were sent to prevent that from occurring if at all possible.\u201d</p> <p>And he\u2019s telling me the truth, as far as it goes. There may be more to it, but he isn\u2019t actively lying. I\u2019d know if he was.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry about Edaine.\u201d</p><p>His smile falters. Dies. \u201cYes,\u201d he says, too quietly. \u201cMe, too.\u201d</p><p>Don\u2019t know why I said that. It wasn\u2019t my fault\u2014</p><p>Then it occurs to me I\u2019m singing that refrain a hell of a lot, lately. At what point do I accept some blame? No, I never asked her to make her last run with saving me as the objective; that was her choice. But if it weren\u2019t for me, maybe she would\u2019ve chosen retirement instead. I feel like I need to make her sacrifice worthwhile.</p> <p>\u201cOkay if I go talk to the crew?\u201d I really want out of the cockpit. This is more awkward than waking up next to someone whose name you don\u2019t remember.</p><p>He nods. And that\u2019s all. As I go down the corridor, I can\u2019t help but think he\u2019s almost as glad to see the back of me as I am to go. They\u2019re all chatting, still sitting in their safety seats, although not strapped in anymore. When I come into the central hub, though, conversation dies as if I\u2019ve lobbed a grenade. I drop down in one of the empty places and fold my ankle up on my knee. Wait.</p><p>It doesn\u2019t take too long. Most people can\u2019t stomach silence; it provides too much opportunity to think about things they prefer to avoid. It\u2019s the young man who speaks first, something that doesn\u2019t surprise me much.</p><p>\u201cIs it true you made the leap to Quaren when you were just nineteen?\u201d</p><p>Don\u2019t know if I should disillusion him. I didn\u2019t realize I\u2019d acquired a reputation. We just do what we do, you know? And seldom think about how the rest of the universe perceives us. \u201cIn fact, I was twenty-three. Was nineteen when I made my first jump, period.\u201d</p><p>I know my service record. Almost fourteen years, averaging forty-one jumps a year for a total of five hundred seventy-five successful runs, and of those, I charted eighty-eight new beacons for the Corp. Decorated twice for bravery beyond the call. And the average jumper burns out in less than ten. So I guess I can understand why someone is interested in finding out what makes me tick. Unlock my secrets, and maybe he could improve productivity for other jumpers. That\u2019d be a good thing, overall.</p> <p>However, the critter that winds up dissected for the greater good...well, I\u2019m guessing it probably doesn\u2019t feel too pleased about the contribution. So I\u2019d do well to be on my guard and remember that even the good guys probably don\u2019t have my best interests at heart. The only person I could\u2019ve trusted at my back, no exceptions, had his molecules dispersed with all due ceremony about fourteen days ago.</p><p>I fucking miss him.</p><p>\u201cThere are some things waiting for you in quarters,\u201d the doc, Saul, is saying. \u201cClothes. You can change and make use of the san facilities, if you want.\u201d He sounds strange, diffident, at odds with his stolid, steady appearance. \u201cDown the hall, second right. The door will recognize you.\u201d</p><p>His sincerity gets to me. It\u2019s easy to be tough when everyone around you is bristling with rancor and suspicion, but let someone show you some genuine kindness, and you find yourself on the verge of breaking down. So I just nod and follow his instructions. Can feel Dina\u2019s eyes boring into my back. That one would rather space me than deliver me safely to Lachion.</p><p>Walking away, I hear Dina logging her report: \u201cAft shields at thirty-five percent in sectors 12 and 18, damage to the holds, structural damage in\u2014\u201d But I tune her out. That stuff is her worry. As long as the ship\u2019s in one piece and will get us there, I don\u2019t much care.</p><p>My quarters are small, no more than a closet with a bunk built out from the wall, but as promised, I find a change of clothes and a san shower. Feels good to be clean, and when I dress, I notice that someone\u2019s been studying my file. Because this blue bodysuit is an exact replica of one I wore for a photo op with tall s-leather boots and tribal jewelry from one of the inhabited rim worlds, all handmade stuff, very rare. A gift when we made planetfall since a jumper is part navigator, part surveyor, and part diplomat. I\u2019ve made first contact with indigenous peoples no less than five times.</p><p>The outfit is smooth; it stretches at the neck enough to let you shimmy into it, then the fabric snaps back into place. It\u2019s some poly-silk blend that looks elegant but doesn\u2019t snag or tear and it\u2019s damn near fireproof. I wish I had my boots; they weren\u2019t just a fashion statement, as the toes were reinforced and a well-placed kick would break someone\u2019s kneecap.</p><p>As I\u2019m emerging from quarters, March\u2019s voice comes over the comm. \u201cApproaching Lachion, planetfall in half an hour. All crew to stations please.\u201d</p> <p>That seems an unnecessary formality, given the size of the crew, but I watch, hoping to learn something about my companions. And I do. From the central hub, Saul heads for medical, but I already knew he\u2019s the ship\u2019s doc. Dina told me she serves as mechanic, and that just leaves Loras. He takes position at the comm, so he must be the communications officer, and that usually includes systems work and encryption.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a savant,\u201d March says at my shoulder. \u201cHe hears a language once, intuitively understands its syntax and structures. Vocabulary takes another day or so.\u201d</p><p>I jump. \u201cGoing to put a bell on you,\u201d I mutter.</p><p>Is he reading my mind? Or following the trajectory of my gaze, deducing my thoughts via logic instead of Psi? I honestly have no idea, and I\u2019ve never encountered that before. Nothing in his mind gave me any clue. Unlike Kai, who was a chaotic whirl of impulses, half-formed ideas and inclinations, March was orderly, silent, contained. Even while we were jacked in, I received few things from him that he didn\u2019t specifically send.</p><p>Compartmentalized, I realize. Like me.</p><p>I glance at him.</p><p>And he smiles, cool and humorless. \u201cThey\u2019ll be waiting for you when we touch down,\u201d he says. \u201cTry not to offend anyone.\u201d</p><p>Smile sweetly back and reply, \u201cIsn\u2019t that your job, dickless wonder?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m pretty sure I hear Dina chuckle.</p><p>CHAPTER 6</p><p>The sky looks like a boiled potato.</p><p>An ugly gray-white, overcast, beyond the hangar it\u2019s sputtering snow, and March didn\u2019t see fit to advise me of the season or provide a winter coat. So I\u2019m shivering, arms wrapped around myself. Hard to look imposing while your teeth chatter.</p><p>Don\u2019t know what I expected, some kind of diplomatic delegation or another sort of welcoming party? What\u2019s waiting for us looks more like a dysfunctional family. There\u2019s a tan, leathery man chewing on an unlit cigarillo, yeah, I know\u2014those have been outlawed on civilized worlds for a long time. He\u2019s wearing an old-fashioned gun belt, retrofitted, wherein he\u2019s carrying the tools of his trade. I hope those are spanners.</p><p>They don\u2019t even manufacture live rounds anymore, do they?</p><p>And then there\u2019s the old woman with a pouf of silver hair, cosmetics caked into the creases of her face. She looks like a stereotypical holo-representation of a madame; I half expect her \u201cgirls\u201d to pour out of a nearby ship and cluster around her, giggling. But nope, that leaves the third member of the quartet waiting for me, a short, slight fellow with a receding hairline and a rabbity face, very little chin. The last person appears to be a surprisingly young woman, although I\u2019ve learned not to accept things at face value. But she\u2019s slim\u2014smooth skin, dark hair...and she has pale green eyes.</p><p>My gaze sharpens. There\u2019s a J-gene carrier, unregistered, out here in the back of beyond? The Corp should have signed her up, begun her training, and had her making jumps by now. Well, if not currently, then within a year or two. I put her age around eighteen, but I might be wrong.</p><p>Well, if I\u2019m holding out for a polite introduction from my new crewmates, I\u2019ll wait forever. They\u2019ve arrayed themselves at my back, silent. I sense amusement from March; he enjoys seeing me at a disadvantage, I think. I don\u2019t know why, as he\u2019s certainly seen me that way a lot. From the first moment he entered my cell and caught me on the verge of tears, he\u2019s seen more of that than probably any other living soul. It occurs to me that, for the sake of symmetry, I should probably kill him.</p><p>March cuts me a sharp look. Okay, what the hell\u2014</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Sirantha Jax,\u201d I say aloud.</p><p>\u201cYes, we know.\u201d Really don\u2019t like the way the old woman smiles; there\u2019s a spidery quality to her from her wrinkle-web face to the strands of hair slithering from her bouffant bun. \u201cYour reputation precedes you.\u201d</p><p>By dumb luck, I retain my polite smile because there\u2019s definite nastiness to her tone. I\u2019m trying to decide how to respond to that, remembering that March told me not to offend anyone, when I feel something drop around my shoulders. Glancing back, I see that it\u2019s Saul, the ship\u2019s doc. At least he\u2019s on my side. He\u2019s given me his overcoat; the length is about right, but it would wrap around me twice with fabric to spare. Still, I appreciate the gesture, and I shrug into it fully, nice heavy s-wool.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I murmur, and he steps back, leaving me to deal with these strangers. Oddly, just by virtue of the coat, I feel more armored, more equipped to do so. \u201cMarch didn\u2019t have time to brief me.\u201d</p><p>And the bastard elbows me in the back because he knows I\u2019m bullshitting. Guess it entertained him to throw me in headfirst and watch whether I\u2019d sink or swim. I\u2019m starting to wonder how bad it would\u2019ve been, lounging around a Corp asylum for the rest of my days under heavy sedation.</p><p>The leathery man chuckles. \u201cThat\u2019s March for ya. I\u2019m Jor Dahlgren. Good to finally meet you.\u201d As if we\u2019ve been planning this rendezvous for a while. I must admit, it\u2019s more than a little unnerving to have people making those kinds of pronouncements. His handshake grinds my knuckles together, but I don\u2019t wince when I pull my hand back. \u201cThis is my mother, Mair Dahlgren, and my daughter, Keri.\u201d The girl inclines her head to me like royalty, and the crone\u2019s smile widens, revealing yellow teeth.</p><p>\u201cThe pleasure\u2019s mine.\u201d</p><p>Holy shit, they really are a dysfunctional family. A family had the power to dispatch someone to Perlas Station, send my AI into maintenance, and manually unlock my cell door? If so, what\u2019re they doing on a backward rock like Lachion? Damn, it\u2019s cold here. The wind\u2019s slicing right through the overcoat down to the slinky s-silk bodysuit. I may look good, but I\u2019m going to poke No-chin\u2019s eye out if he gets any closer. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jor doesn\u2019t introduce the little guy, so I turn to him, and he\u2019s bright enough to take the cue. \u201cI\u2019m Carl Zelaco, their financial advisor.\u201d</p><p>Of course you are. With that face, you couldn\u2019t have been anything else.</p><p>\u201cA pleasure,\u201d I repeat. And March snort-snickers. \u201cI\u2019m sure we have much to say to one another,\u201d I continue, though I\u2019m actually not. \u201cPerhaps we should adjourn inside and talk matters over?\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t actually see anything here but this godforsaken hangar. The sky is wide-open, no sign of civilization, but surely there\u2019s something. Or maybe there isn\u2019t, which is the whole point. As I ponder that, the scar beneath my rib cage chooses that moment to itch, and I can\u2019t scratch it. Loras seems to be staring at something nobody else sees, but then, March did say he was a savant. So who knows what that\u2019s about?</p> <p>\u201cAn eminently agreeable suggestion,\u201d No-chin Carl says. \u201cStep this way, we have a rover waiting to convey us to the compound.\u201d</p><p>Compound? Hate the way my gaze goes to March, for reassurance or clarification, regardless, nothing that I want to ask of him. But I\u2019ve already done it because he\u2019s nodding at me, just as he nodded at Dina on board the ship. There\u2019s a five-year-old inside me who wants to kick his shins.</p><p>Insufferably, he smiles.</p><p>With an inward sigh, I turn to follow the leather-tan man. This rover\u2019s new, shiny, with plating that makes me worry about the wildlife. \u201cAre we likely to be attacked?\u201d Even the tire rims are spiked, as if to slam another land vehicle. I\u2019m trying to remember what I\u2019ve heard about Lachion, but this is the last place any jumper would linger. There\u2019s nothing to discover or report, just some mudsiders playing\u2014</p><p>Wild West, Old Terra style. Ah, shit.</p> <p>\u201cOh, I do hope so,\u201d says Mair.</p><p>\u201cProbably not,\u201d the accountant answers. \u201cWe\u2019re pretty far from\u2014\u201d He grunts as Jor slugs him in the gut, but I guess he\u2019s used to that because he doesn\u2019t double up or fall over, although he cradles his stomach as he walks. Huh, he\u2019s tougher than he looks.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be entirely safe with us,\u201d Keri tells me, smiling prettily, and I have to wonder why her sweetness scares me most of all.</p><p>Dahlgren\u2019s got his entourage, and I\u2019ve got mine, I think with some amusement, although Dina would happily shove a shiv between my shoulder blades and twist. I\u2019m less sure of Loras, and Saul, well, he seems to admire me. Or perhaps he just possesses that old world courtesy bred into some men as a relic from a patronymic culture. Whatever the reason, I\u2019m wearing his coat, and he\u2019s shivering, so I count that a win.</p><p>That just leaves March. Obnoxious, odious\u2014</p><p>\u201cObstreperous,\u201d he suggests, sotto voce.</p> <p>I nod, then jerk my head in his direction. His smile becomes a smirk. Oh shit, he\u2019s Psi. He is. There\u2019s no getting away from him, even when we\u2019re not jacked in. But what the hell, I\u2019ve never heard of a Psi pilot. They\u2019re rarer than jumpers and almost always scooped up in early childhood, whisked away to Psi-Corp to learn how to filter out thought-noise. Historically, Psi-sensitives bounced in and out of mental asylums until they killed themselves. Until people figured out they were not, in fact, insane, and they really were hearing voices. Thoughts. Whatever.</p><p>So add one unregistered jumper, one freelance Psi, and me, and you get\u2014</p><p>\u201c\u2014your ass in the rover,\u201d March says.</p><p>The dysfunctional family sits, regarding me expectantly. Behind me, I sense Dina stirring. I don\u2019t need to be Psi to know she\u2019s looking at March, asking with a look, Can I kill her now, boss? And the bitch of it, I can\u2019t even entertain myself plotting long, intricate revenges because he might hear me. And laugh, knowing I can\u2019t carry out any of my threats. Oh, but his day is coming. I swear.</p><p>For now, I get my ass in the rover.</p><p>CHAPTER 7</p><p>We\u2019re making good time to the middle of nowhere, and I still don\u2019t have a clue where we\u2019re going or why.</p><p>Let me just say, that\u2019s getting old. I\u2019m starting to think I was better off in my cell. March offers me a tight smile, as if he isn\u2019t sure he disagrees. But before I can go all prima donna and start demanding answers, shit gets interesting.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got Gunnars coming up fast,\u201d Keri says, as if she\u2019s offering us tea and biscuits, and Jor swears as he swerves hard left, narrowly avoiding a collision with something that looks even sturdier than the rover.</p><p>\u201cThose bastards,\u201d Mair growls. \u201cThey must have us tapped. No other way they could\u2019ve known we\u2019d be traveling this route. Nobody comes this way anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnless there\u2019s a spy giving reports.\u201d No-chin Carl makes this observation, seeming unaware that as the only non\u2013family member in the vehicle, he\u2019s most likely casting aspersions on himself unless one of March\u2019s crew did it\u2014</p><p>This is making my head hurt. I feel like I\u2019m one big crackling box of crazy, and suddenly, I wonder if this is Unit Psych stuff, if I\u2019m delusional and already locked up in the Corp asylum, medicated within an inch of my life. Certainly I feel paranoid\u2014the world I used to live in doesn\u2019t make sense anymore. But lunatics don\u2019t wonder if they\u2019re mad, do they? Isn\u2019t it always the rest of the world that\u2019s off its nut?</p><p>Jor shakes his head. \u201cDoesn\u2019t matter. I\u2019ll kill her myself before letting the Gunnars get their hands on her.\u201d</p><p>Kill...who? Me? Frag that. What the hell have I gotten myself into?</p><p>\u201cNobody said anything about that.\u201d It\u2019s Saul, speaking quietly but firmly, from all the way in the back. \u201cThat\u2019s not part of the plan.\u201d</p><p>But before anyone can respond, the rover rocks, and I close my eyes, not wanting to see how the countryside slings back and forth as the back tires fight for traction with the Gunnar vehicle slamming us repeatedly in the side. The reinforced doors seem to be holding, but March is really being battered around. I spare a glare for the careful way he\u2019s shielding Keri with his upper body, and then I\u2019m smashed face-first into the front seat. When I right myself, hands braced, my nose smarts, eyes are watering, and I feel a trickle of hot blood running over my upper lip.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s bleeding,\u201d Keri says, and I don\u2019t understand the rising note of hysteria in her voice.</p><p>Hate driving. Hate it. I\u2019m remembering more than I want to about physics: drag and inertia and the momentum of, say, the human body when jettisoned from a moving vehicle.</p><p>\u201cOpen the roof,\u201d Jor barks to his mother, who starts manipulating levers, then the panels part overhead, which seems highly ill-advised, given that there are people trying to kill us, for reasons incomprehensible to me.</p><p>\u201cGet those bastards, Ma.\u201d</p><p>The old woman looks insane as she pushes to her knees. Her white hair streaming in the wind, she activates another series of controls, and I hear the sound of weapons being readied. She\u2019s laughing as she fires, and I have the answer to my question; they do still manufacture live rounds, at least on Lachion. I hear metal hit metal, like a mudsider cannon from some old war holo, and a chunk of their side armor panel blows wide, striking the plain in a cloud of dust.</p><p>So fragging cold, the wind\u2019s drilling through me. I hear Loras chanting something low and eerie, like an alien prayer, and the Gunnars retaliate, launch a small round device from side turrets. I don\u2019t know what to expect here on Lachion, but it strikes the windscreen and detonates in a low hum that appears to play hell with the rover\u2019s engines.</p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s not good,\u201d No-chin Carl says, ever helpful.</p><p>The rover sputters, turbines dying. Our velocity decreases, then we\u2019re hit hard. I feel their grapplers lock down, and they pull back, towing us to a halt.</p><p>\u201cAnything I fire\u2019s going to hit us, too. The rover can\u2019t take any more damage and still carry us out of here.\u201d Mair snarls a word that I didn\u2019t think old ladies knew. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to defend,\u201d she continues. \u201cIf they want us, make them work for it.\u201d</p><p>Jor simply nods and metal shutters come down over all the windows and I see reinforced steel plating shoot up, covering the doors. The only opening\u2019s the roof, and I don\u2019t completely understand why they\u2019re not sealing that, too.</p><p>\u201cAir,\u201d March tells me quietly. \u201cThe rover doesn\u2019t have life support. There are too many of us in here. If we did that, all the Gunnars need to do is wait. We pass out; they cut their way in. Take you, kill the rest of us.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s a bad solution, actually. March narrows his eyes, and I offer him a very sweet smile. Okay, not Saul. I like Saul. I can\u2019t see anything, but I hear the sound of feet tramping over the rocky ground. There\u2019s at least six of them, presumably combat trained. I hear the thunk of climbing feet.</p><p>March pushes Keri toward the back, and Saul makes room between himself and Loras. Somehow, that pisses me off as much as anything that\u2019s happened. \u201cShe\u2019s bleeding,\u201d the girl repeats, looking between Saul and Loras as if expecting them to do something. \u201cFor Mary\u2019s sake, keep her out of the wind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope you can fight,\u201d Dina calls from the back. \u201cSeeing as they\u2019re going to hit you first.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s right. I\u2019m in the second row of seats, right below the gap.</p><p>\u201cYou better,\u201d I tell her. \u201cBecause I\u2019m between you and what\u2019s coming. When I die, guess who\u2019s next, bitch?\u201d</p><p>Mair laughs; it\u2019s an ugly, grating sound, and I\u2019m not glad I caused it. When she regards me with an approving eye, that\u2019s somehow worse. Wordlessly, she hands me a weapon, seeming to assume I\u2019ll know how to use it. I turn it over in my hands. I was expecting something more Wild West out of these crazy mudsiders, but this is a standard shockstick\u2014basic principle, hit the bad guy as hard as you can while simultaneously administering a powerful charge that will short his brain pan.</p><p>Only one person climbing\u2014why would that be? I heard others approaching...that doesn\u2019t make sense. Send one at a time to a small opening that\u2019s easy to defend? My internal alarms are all going off even before\u2014</p><p>There\u2019s a low whine as the Gunnar lobs something down between the open panel, and just an instant before it detonates, I hear Keri screaming. Instinctively I put my face beneath Saul\u2019s heavy overcoat, as I identify...gas grenade. Shit, I didn\u2019t even know they made these anymore. Frag this, my eyes stream with tears as I pull myself out of the rover. They don\u2019t want me dead; I know that.</p><p>That\u2019s the one thing I\u2019m sure of, these Gunnars, they\u2019re not going to kill me, whatever they do to the rest of this motley bunch. I land hard on the hood of the rover, roll off onto the dirt, and the thud takes the wind right out of me. I can still hear Keri moaning, and Mair curses with a fluency that I\u2019ve only heard in starports on the rim.</p><p>Jor is ominously silent, and the rest of the crew scrambles out after me. Except for March. He\u2019s shepherding the girl with an excessive tenderness that makes me want to bury my foot in his balls. Was I ever like her? I don\u2019t think so. Life...never gave me a chance to be soft. And maybe, if I\u2019m honest, I\u2019m a little jealous\u2014not of March, he\u2019s an asshole, but because nobody ever tried to take care of me like that. Not even Kai. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Outside the vehicle, Carl talks quietly with the Gunnars, smiling. I realize he wasn\u2019t being stupid earlier; he was boasting. He\u2019s wearing a rebreather and a mildly apologetic expression.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry for the inconvenience,\u201d he tells me, as if my luggage has been misplaced on an interstellar voyage. \u201cThe Gunnars pay substantially better, and I think, given all the statistical data, you\u2019ll agree with my assessment. It\u2019s the best possible outcome for you to sign on with them.\u201d</p><p>Doing what?</p><p>It seems as if there isn\u2019t going to be fight. The gas has thoroughly demoralized the Dahlgrens\u2014but I don\u2019t know; I feel like busting some heads on principle. I\u2019m bloody tired of being dragged around, here to there, without a word of explanation. And it\u2019s been like that a long damn time, nothing\u2019s been right since Kai died, and I am sick of it.</p> <p>Mair chooses that moment to stagger from the vehicle; she stumbles, falls, eyes livid with grief. But as she pushes herself upright, more will than strength, she growls to Carl, \u201cBetter to die on your feet than live on your knees. You spineless sack of shit.\u201d</p><p>I somehow know that Jor\u2019s not coming out of the rover under his own power. Maybe the gas affected him different than the rest of us. But whatever, why ever, he\u2019s gone, and Keri weeps against March\u2019s shoulder. Mair, with her wild eyes, looks like the living embodiment of the old Furies, come to reap a man\u2019s soul. I\u2019m a little afraid of her, and everyone falls back, as she surges toward the Gunnars. For a moment, I think she\u2019ll rend them limb from limb single-handedly.</p><p>Carl glances to me in appeal, as if I have some power in this insane tableau. Then I realize I do.</p><p>\u201cFrag you.\u201d I answer his look in Keri\u2019s time-for-tea tone.</p><p>And it takes him a moment to process the disparity of the words from the sweetness in my voice. The Gunnars look like killers, all of them. Big men, hard-eyed, well geared, and ready to throw down. That\u2019s fine.</p> <p>So am I.</p><p>I\u2019m Sirantha Jax, and I have had enough.</p><p>CHAPTER 8</p><p>\u201cJax,\u201d March hisses. \u201cLoras can\u2019t fight, Saul won\u2019t. Are you crazy?\u201d</p><p>That leaves me, Mair, Dina, and March, if he\u2019ll weigh in. Keri is a nonfactor, as she\u2019s still sniveling.</p><p>So yeah, I guess I am. After all this time, you would think I\u2019d have earned a better death, but at least I\u2019m going out swinging. I test the weight of the shockstick in my hand, and the Gunnars share a look among themselves, like some hive-mind critter, before they burst out laughing. I\u2019m pretty sure these assholes are related, too. What is it with this fragging backwater planet?</p> <p>\u201cOh, Ms. Jax, do be reasonable\u2014\u201d Carl says, as I sprint for him, duck a half-assed grab from one of his goons, open-hand-smash the bridge of No-chin\u2019s nose, then come down hard on the backswing upside meatwad\u2019s head. Yeah, asshole, that\u2019s how it\u2019s done. I smell the faint scent of sizzling skin as he crumples, the shockstick throwing blue sparks. Its live hum in my hands proves to the other five that I\u2019m dead serious, and suddenly they realize they\u2019ve got a fight on their hands.</p><p>It\u2019s a mistake people have made before. Because I\u2019m small, they assume I\u2019m also spineless, that I won\u2019t have the guts to back up the shit I talk. Carl shrieks like a woman, his nose spurting like I\u2019ve cut his jugular or something.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s bleeding.\u201d Keri moans. \u201cMother Mary of Anabolic Grace, what have you done?\u201d</p><p>Everyone sort of freezes and shares a look of unilateral horror. And I don\u2019t understand. It\u2019s just a damned bloody nose. I\u2019ve got one, too. What\u2019s the big deal? But I use the time to make myself scarce, as his men rally, swinging slow because they\u2019re so big. They connect, and I\u2019m going down, not in a good way. I don\u2019t have the strength to go one-on-one with any of these guys, but I\u2019m betting my brain against theirs. These nulls don\u2019t know how to fight women; it\u2019s a different game, believe me.</p><p>As I dive between the legs of a big Gunnar, I see Mair wind up and slam her shockstick hard as she can between the V of another guy\u2019s thighs. Falling, he makes a noise that I can\u2019t say I\u2019ve heard a human utter before, sort of like I imagine a puppy would sound being put through a juicer. He curls up on his side, covering those extra-crispy genitals with his palm, then she\u2019s after No-chin Carl. Guess a broken nose isn\u2019t satisfactory recompense for her loss. I wouldn\u2019t want to be in his shoes\u2014that\u2019s for damn sure. And huh...for some reason the remaining Gunnars don\u2019t want to mess with Mair\u2014they leave Carl to take his thrashing\u2014and that has them hounding me. I evade a clumsy grab with a feint left, then I sprint for the rover.</p><p>Just like that, we\u2019ve got a fair fight on our hands.</p><p>I\u2019m not sure they want me alive anymore, but that\u2019s all right because they\u2019ve got to catch me first. I use the rover, rounding it, then doubling back. If they think I\u2019m going to stand still and take my beating, they\u2019re the crazy ones. It\u2019s a childish tactic, but it buys me some time as March shakes his head, glares at me, and throws a sloppy roundhouse. He gets stomach-slugged twice in rapid succession and doesn\u2019t even stumble. Making a second lap, I decide he\u2019s one tough son of a bitch and make a mental note never to gut-punch him. I\u2019ll go for the eyes instead.</p><p>Midfight, March glares at me, and for that sin, takes a solid uppercut to the jaw. I laugh out loud, starting to enjoy this. Shit, the two behemoths have figured out my little game, and this time, they anticipated my turn. My timing\u2019s off, but I dive between them, roll, and come up behind Saul, who regards me pleadingly. Don\u2019t know what he\u2019s asking, no breath to inquire because I\u2019ve still got them on me and no way to shake them.</p> <p>March can hold his own, but I have to deal with this somehow\u2014</p><p>But not alone. Leaping from atop the rover, Dina drops down on one of the flagella tailing me. She isn\u2019t a huge woman but she\u2019s muscular, and seventy kilos, landing hard, will flatten even a big guy if he\u2019s not braced. Her shockstick hums as she clubs him efficiently, although one hit really would\u2019ve done it. Still, I can\u2019t help admire her artistry; he\u2019s going to have quite a nice pattern in minor burns, assuming he\u2019s not brain damaged by the time she\u2019s done.</p><p>I turn just in time to see March land the telling blow. The other guy\u2019s head snaps round, flecks of blood and spit spewing from his open, rubber-lipped mouth. They did it the old-fashioned way: no shocksticks, no finesse, just slug it out until someone falls over. In a one-on-one fight, I\u2019m guessing that\u2019s rarely March. And probably because he\u2019s bleeding from a split lip and has what looks to be a nice shiner swelling on his left eye, March sinks his boot into the guy\u2019s ribs, hard enough that even I wince.</p><p>That leaves just one standing, against all of us, so I figure it\u2019s safe for me to stop running. He seems to realize that around the same time, nearly collides with me, then raises his hands, palms up, in a symbol of peaceable intentions.</p><p>\u201cTruce?\u201d he asks, and I realize it\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve heard one of them speak. \u201cThe Gunnar clan would like to step back from this particular investment. It seemed like a good opportunity but the start-up costs\u201d\u2014he gestures at the fallen\u2014\u201care prohibitive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey killed my boy.\u201d Mair finally rises, stiff and weary, from the broken body of her former financial advisor. Although I\u2019m not a medical officer, I\u2019m pretty sure Carl\u2019s not getting up. Ever. \u201cI want them all executed, March. Here. Now. Every last one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe gas is nontoxic!\u201d The Gunnar defends himself, sounding desperate. \u201cHe must\u2019ve experienced an allergic reaction. Swear it\u2019s nonlethal, the rest of you are fine.\u201d</p><p>The doc hovers nearby, not quite wringing his hands in dismay, but it\u2019s close. I wonder if March surrounds himself with pacifists and untried boys for a reason. Make himself look better by comparison, maybe? I smirk as he narrows his eyes on me. God help me, but I love the fact that I can taunt him silently, even with this shit going on.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I say softly to Dina, while the rest wait to hear what March is going to say. I know he\u2019s thinking things over, weighing factors of which I, in my almighty ignorance, am unaware.</p><p>She shrugs. \u201cYou got balls, bitch, even if you\u2019re dumber than a bag of hammers. We\u2019ll be lucky if we don\u2019t die today.\u201d</p><p>Have to laugh at that, and damn me if I\u2019m not starting to like her, even if she hates my guts. I\u2019m glad she\u2019s on my side. Sort of.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Saul speaks into the silence. He\u2019s been circling among the bodies or soon-to-be-bodies, administering treatment. \u201cCarl Zelaco betrayed an honorable contract with clan Dahlgren for the hope of financial gain. While clan Gunnar pursued this investment\u201d\u2014he glances at me as if I\u2019m a walking, talking stock certificate\u2014\u201cwith regrettable vehemence, they intended no harm to clan Dahlgren, save financial embarrassment. A life for a life; it is fair frontier justice.\u201d</p><p>March surprises me by nodding\u2014I guess Saul functions as his conscience. God knows I didn\u2019t sense anything like one while we were jacked in together. Mair hisses, and I half expect her to fly at Saul. I even step in front of him, although honestly I don\u2019t want to take this old woman on. She is fragging scary. But then Keri surprises me with a firmness I hadn\u2019t expected of her:</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s right,\u201d she states. \u201cLet\u2019s go. We still have business to discuss.\u201d Right now, there\u2019s a resemblance to Jor in the set of her mouth, and her red-rimmed eyes shine with a hard light, although that may be the way the setting sun reflects in her pupils.</p><p>\u201cI will not forget you,\u201d the Gunnar clansman says. And yeah, he\u2019s looking at me.</p><p>I give him my best grin. \u201cNobody ever does.\u201d</p><p>All this time, Loras has been staring up at the sky, as if he lives in a world the rest of us simply cannot perceive. He\u2019s dreamy-vague, golden curls and sapphire eyes, a fey, graven look that gives his features an inexplicable purity. Now that I study him closer, I realize he\u2019s not young so much as ageless, his face untouched by time or worry. There\u2019s a certain kind of madness in his face, as if he cannot care for anything enough to be moved by it, and I have to look away. But he draws my eyes back as he speaks.</p><p>\u201cWe should go,\u201d he says quietly, expressionlessly. Studying the angle of the sun. \u201cIf we hope to reach the compound by nightfall. They\u2019re coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d For once, March seems to speak for all of us.</p><p>CHAPTER 9</p><p>\u201cThey who?\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s like the tenth time I\u2019ve asked, but no one\u2019s answering me. Instead they\u2019re rushing to and fro trying to get all the wounded loaded into the Gunnar Landcruiser. The dead have already been dumped unceremoniously into the cargo space in back, and it shakes me down to my bones, the way Keri accepts that.</p><p>If she knows she can\u2019t afford to indulge in grief, moan and whimper and sob on March\u2019s shoulder, it can only be because she knows something really bad is coming, something that will require all of us, functioning at our peak, to survive it. My breath puffs out smoky like a devil\u2019s sigh, and I\u2019m shivering all over. Their silence is frightening me more than anything I\u2019ve ever known. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve done everything we can here,\u201d March says finally. \u201cAll aboard, we\u2019ve got to make tracks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll never stay ahead of them,\u201d Keri answers in a monotone. \u201cThere isn\u2019t a land vehicle fast enough, and they can pry off armored plating\u2014\u201d</p><p>I realize it\u2019s not resolve buoying her up. She\u2019s numb with despair, and I know this is my fault even if I don\u2019t understand what\u2019s happening entirely. But the others are too accustomed to listening to March to heed the girl\u2019s objections. One by one, they climb inside, and the Gunnar takes his place at the wheel. It\u2019s close, not meant to carry this many, and so I wind up on someone\u2019s lap. Not surprisingly, March holds Keri, carefully although not possessively. I\u2019m figuring out she\u2019s like a little sister to him. Maybe if I had a brother, he\u2019d treat me like that, too.</p><p>I glance down at Dina, who rolls her eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re so not my type,\u201d she tells me, although she does wind her arms about my waist, probably to keep me from hitting my head. \u201cScrawny little bitch.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDahlgren compound is closest,\u201d the Gunnar murmurs, presumably laying in the course as his fingers fly across the consoles. \u201cWe\u2019ll make for it and pray.\u201d</p><p>Loras pauses in his low chanting. \u201cAlready on it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould someone please tell me what\u2019s coming?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou called them,\u201d Keri tells me, pale green eyes eerie in the half-light. \u201cWith the blood. They live in the caves and only come above to feed, they\u2019ll descend in hordes...\u201d</p><p>Before I can erupt and start pulling her hair out in sheer frustration, Saul elaborates. \u201cThey\u2019re a native Lachion life-form, one of the few things that seems to have thrived here\u2014\u201d He gestures, and glancing between the miniscule gap in the plated panels at the barren plain, I can see why survival might be difficult. \u201cLargely because the creatures eat anything that moves...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOr doesn\u2019t move,\u201d Mair adds, cheerful as a death\u2019s-head.</p><p>Saul continues as if he hasn\u2019t been interrupted, as if he\u2019s giving a lecture, and we ought to have holo-recorders fixed on him, lest we forget something important later. \u201cIn some regards they are akin to Nyctosaurus gracilis, from the Upper Cretaceous of western Kansas. That was part of Old Terra,\u201d he adds, seeming to notice that some of his audience look blank.</p><p>\u201cThere used to be great herds on Lachion,\u201d the old woman tells me. \u201cBison. We cloned and raised \u2019em here. We didn\u2019t know about the Teras then. Didn\u2019t know why nobody had developed this world. It seemed like hard work but doable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you can\u2019t see them coming,\u201d Keri says in a reed-thin voice. I see March rubbing her back, his expression as soft as I\u2019ve seen it. \u201cJust hear their wings.\u201d</p><p>Now I\u2019ve got this image of these flying things, mouths full of jagged teeth to rend, talons to pry the metal off the Landcruiser, and leathery wings that carry them faster than anything can move on the ground. Plus, you can\u2019t see them coming. And this is better than my cell, better than Psych Officer Newel? Maybe. Despite myself I shudder, but Dina doesn\u2019t stroke my back comfortingly.</p><p>Instead she says, \u201cAnd you called them down on us, dumb-ass.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEr, yes.\u201d The doc looks discomfited. \u201cThe Teras are natural hunters, and they\u2019ve evolved a very complex camouflage mechanism that approximates invisibility. True invisibility is impossible, naturally, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuiet.\u201d March holds up a hand, and everyone in the vehicle stops breathing. Or damn near. Over the rumble of the Landcruiser, I\u2019m pretty sure I can make out the faint sound of wings. To make that kind of noise, there must be\u2014\u201cHundreds,\u201d he says, after a moment. \u201cAnd closing fast. Will this heap go any faster?\u201d</p><p>The Gunnar shakes his head. \u201cGot her wide-open right now. I\u2019ve got their heat signatures on-screen, and I figure our paths are going to intersect a good ten minutes before we reach the compound.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll be on us in less than four minutes,\u201d Loras informs us. Nobody asks him how he knows that or how he was able to sense the Teras stirring in the first place. I\u2019m sick of asking questions everyone else already knows the answers to.</p><p>\u201cPowering up the shock fields.\u201d March flips a few switches, and I can hear a new hum in addition to the engines and the ominous rush of wings growing ever closer. Through the seams between panels I can see that the light is going, and I wish that didn\u2019t fill me with such inexorable dread.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019ll deter them a little while.\u201d The Gunnar\u2019s knuckles gleam white where he\u2019s gripping the steering console a little too tightly.</p><p>His brothers are starting to come around, some of them. The one Mair whacked in the jimmy asks, \u201cWhat the hell are we doing with Dahlgrens, bro?\u201d Then pauses, registering the sound: \u201cMother Mary of Anabolic Grace, we got Teras incoming?\u201d He levels angry blue eyes on me. \u201cYou\u2019re a hex, lady, dark luck, powerful bad juju, ken?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly to people who try to kidnap me,\u201d I tell him sweetly, and March snorts, so I feel obliged to add, \u201cOr rescue me...\u201d And then Dina makes a pfft sound. \u201cOr who travel with me...\u201d My gaze sweeps around the darkened interior, trying to find an ally, but nobody will hold my eyes more than two seconds, it seems. \u201cFine, frag you all, I\u2019m dark juju, bad luck, and you\u2019re all doomed.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019re bad luck,\u201d Saul says, touching my shoulder lightly. \u201cI think you\u2019re the best hope we\u2019ve had since the Corp bought out and shut down Clericon Stellar twenty turns ago.\u201d</p><p>Before I can ask what the hell he means, something thumps hard against the roof, slinging the Landcruiser sideways. I almost hear something, just above the range of human hearing, but Loras flinches, trembling visibly, and I can see a thin trickle of blood seeping from his nostrils. Something...sonic about these Teras, and poor Loras with his hypersenses, their screams hurt him? Well frag me, that\u2019s...really...not good.</p><p>The shock fields hiss as bodies hit them, and I smell the obscene odor of frying meat. But each time the power surges, the engines splutter, and the Gunnar finally says, \u201cTurn \u2019em off, March. We\u2019re going to stall out. There\u2019s just too many of them, and they\u2019re overloading the systems.\u201d</p><p>Mair says softly, in praise, \u201cYou bought us some time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be enough.\u201d Keri lifts her head from his shoulder long enough to deliver this vote of confidence. \u201cMarch never lets us down.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s always the first time, I think sourly, and am rewarded with a glare.</p><p>\u201cHard part\u2019s going to be getting from the Landcruiser into the compound,\u201d the Gunnar says, fighting with the steering column now. I can tell that only his raw physical strength is keeping the \u2019cruiser from being towed off course. But he\u2019s tiring; I can tell that, too. \u201cUnless you\u2019ve remodeled according to my recommendations since the last time I was there.\u201d</p><p>Mair\u2019s expression seems to indicate she didn\u2019t want to take advice from a Gunnar, a fact that we\u2019re all going to regret before much longer. But I\u2019m distracted by the way Loras covers his ears, shaking uncontrollably. Once I\u2019d have thought he was weak, terrified, maybe having a seizure, but now I know it\u2019s agony, pure and simple. He isn\u2019t human. I\u2019m suddenly positive of it. He\u2019s more than a savant, and people are treating him like he\u2019s furniture, subhuman, not worthy of their regard. Even the doc, who by certain sworn oaths, should give a shit, doesn\u2019t seem to.</p><p>Kneeing Dina in the chest, I crawl over the seat, pushing my way back between Gunnar brothers until I reach Loras. He regards me, eyes wide and blank, tuned to the frequency that seems to be liquefying his brain. It\u2019s not just their screams of pain; he can hear everything, their calls to one another, their rage. Hunger. What it must be like, experiencing that, I cannot begin to imagine, but it makes him like me, alien in his way.</p><p>And for that I want to help him.</p><p>CHAPTER 10</p><p>\u201cWhat can I do?\u201d</p><p>Loras doesn\u2019t seem to see me, let alone hear the question, so I take his hand in mine, and it\u2019s cold, frighteningly so. If someone doesn\u2019t do something, he\u2019s going to die. Too many fragging people have bought it because of me. I\u2019ll be damned if it\u2019s going to happen again.</p><p>Think, Jax.</p><p>For a minute, nothing comes, then\u2014okay, maybe it\u2019s a stupid idea, but it\u2019s the only one I\u2019ve got. If one sound is killing him, maybe another pitch can cancel it out; I just have to find the right one. Watching his face, I start singing, running the scale in \u201cahs,\u201d and everyone else turns to look at me as if I\u2019m insane. Maybe I am.</p><p>But when I hit an F toward the lower end of my range, Loras responds. His fingers wrap around mine, and he nods. He still can\u2019t speak, no more than he could articulate his distress when the Teras came, but that\u2019s helping, so I sing it louder. Though I have decent pitch, I\u2019m not trained, so my lungs are starting to burn from holding the note.</p><p>March raises a brow at me. \u201cWhat the frag are you doing?\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t pause to answer, but Dina figures it out. \u201cSaving a life, you brainless hump.\u201d With that, she adds her voice to mine, finding the note after a few false starts.</p><p>And then one by one, the rest of the vehicle joins in. The Gunnars are all tone-deaf and just succeed in making racket, but Mair and Keri hit the right one on the first try. March is the last, and I think it\u2019s more aggravation that it was my idea than lack of desire to help Loras. I honestly think they just didn\u2019t notice. I don\u2019t know why that should be, why they pay so little attention to him, but I\u2019m going to find out.</p><p>\u201cLights of the compound ahead,\u201d the Gunnar says. \u201cWe can\u2019t stay in the vehicle; they\u2019ll pull it apart. Do you at least have shock fields installed?\u2019</p><p>\u201cThe entire perimeter can be electrified, plus all building exteriors,\u201d Mair answers. \u201cWe have that capability remotely, and the fields extend twenty meters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you can turn it on after we make it inside the fences?\u201d</p><p>The old woman nods.</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019d be better if you had an outbuilding big enough to drive the Landcruiser inside, like I advised you, so we wouldn\u2019t need to run...but that\u2019ll do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were getting around to it,\u201d Mair says tightly.</p><p>\u201cThat wouldn\u2019t help with so many of them on us.\u201d March sounds grim. \u201cThey\u2019d just hold on, then we\u2019d have them chewing us up inside when we tried to disembark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnce we\u2019re safely parked, we could fire up the shock fields on the Landcruiser without worrying about stalling,\u201d the Gunnar points out, and I\u2019m surprised to see March concede with a nod.</p><p>\u201cIf they damage the \u2019cruiser, with too many panels gone, the fields won\u2019t work. Necessary connections ripped out.\u201d And the Gunnar nods at March\u2019s words.</p><p>Holding the note almost distracts me from what\u2019s going on outside the vehicle. I can feel it rocking, and the metal plates scream as the Teras pry at them. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever been this scared in my life, and I\u2019m starting to feel faint from the tiny, rare gulps of air I\u2019m permitting myself to keep Loras among the living. Keri hasn\u2019t faltered; neither has Dina, and I spare a smile for both of them. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d he whispers. \u201cI owe you my life.\u201d His fingers squeeze mine. \u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d he adds, louder. Stronger. \u201cI\u2019ve constructed the sound barrier myself now, using your voices, and I\u2019m holding it inside my head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo here\u2019s the plan,\u201d the Gunnar says. \u201cWe drive inside the first set of fences. When I park, I fire up the shock fields. Mair activates the compound defense grid. Some of them are going to avoid the shock fields, that\u2019s a given. We\u2019re just going to have to run like hell toward the nearest outbuilding and pray.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Mair shakes her head. \u201cYou know they won\u2019t return to the caves until they\u2019ve fed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what do you suggest?\u201d March sounds as if he\u2019s at the end of his patience.</p> <p>Mair closes her eyes for a moment, and when she opens them, it\u2019s like she\u2019s another woman entirely. \u201cA sacrifice.\u201d</p><p>And no matter who asks her, that\u2019s all she\u2019ll say.</p><p>One of the back panels finally rips away and I have the sense of things swarming, although I can\u2019t see them, and my flesh crawls. I hear the sound of something swiping, reaching, and No-Chin\u2019s corpse seems to fly back as if animated, and then I can hear the grotesque sound of bones snapping, the wet sound of the Teras devouring their prize. The wind howls through the open Landcruiser, so cold, so dark now, and an endless night full of slavering fiends.</p><p>I don\u2019t realize I\u2019m trembling until Loras cups his other hand over mine. \u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d he whispers. \u201cI am your shinai now. I will not let anything happen to you.\u201d</p><p>My what?</p> <p>Before I can ask, the side panel gives, and the Gunnar who told me I\u2019m bad luck, well, he goes screaming, arms flailing, face contorted. I\u2019ll never forget the way he looked as the Teras pulled him out. Perhaps I am dark luck after all.</p><p>\u201cComing into the compound,\u201d the Gunnar says, toneless. Hell of a way to watch your brother die. \u201cCruiser\u2019s too damaged for shock fields to fire. Whatever you have in mind, clan Dahlgren, do it now, or none of us are going to make it out of this alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClan Dahlgren sacrifices to ensure its own perpetuity.\u201d I\u2019m not altogether sure what she means until she bounds out of the Landcruiser, no longer old in her deportment, and somehow, she\u2019s sprinting with preternatural speed. I can smell the copper where she\u2019s cut herself, and it\u2019s an irresistible lure. Clan leader, warrior, whatever else she is, Mair isn\u2019t merely an old woman. I\u2019ve never known anyone who could move like that. I want to ask, but now isn\u2019t the time.</p><p>I sense the Teras wheeling away from the vehicle and giving chase to living, bleeding prey. Keri screams, \u201cGrandmother!\u201d and March has to carry her away, as the rest of us make use of the time she\u2019s bought us so dearly. It\u2019s the bravest and most terrible thing I\u2019ve ever seen.</p><p>We run, heads down, conscious that the Teras could return at any time. Loras still has me by the hand, and he yanks the door wide, pushing me inside before entering himself. I don\u2019t understand his new care for my safety, then I\u2019m awed, humbled, to hear the live hum of the compound defense grid activating. She\u2019s out there with them, being torn to pieces, and dying, she saved us all.</p><p>Tears stand in my eyes, and Keri\u2019s still screaming, fighting March with fists and feet, but he just holds her, gentle but implacable, refusing to let her go back out. She\u2019s lost everyone today\u2014her father, her grandmother. And a lot of it is my fault. I\u2019ll be lucky if she doesn\u2019t try to kill me at some point. I no longer find Keri\u2019s histrionics ridiculous. Whatever her eccentricities, Mair was a woman worth mourning.</p> <p>Dropping to my knees, I take stock with a glance. Of his clan, only the Gunnar chief made the run. They were all big men. Slow. Our crew seems to be present, although the doc\u2019s blood-spattered and collapses against the wall as if he may never move again. We\u2019re in a storage building. I see crates stacked up against the wall, tools. Dina looks angry, which is pretty much on par. Even though I don\u2019t know shit about Lachion, I know it\u2019s not safe to go back out there. There\u2019s no guarantee all the Teras were outside the perimeter when the defense grid came up. We need to hole up and let them fry, trying to return to the caves.</p><p>I hope there\u2019s some food in here. Fragging starving. It seems like forever since I stuffed that square of choclaste into my face, and before that, I hadn\u2019t eaten all day.</p><p>Maybe that\u2019s an irreverent thought, I don\u2019t know. But it\u2019s how I function. The part of me that feels unworthy, wounded, totally shaken by everything that\u2019s happened, I shuffle her to the back because she\u2019s not helping me deal. And the Sirantha who steps up, well, she\u2019s a pragmatist.</p><p>And she\u2019s hungry.</p><p>CHAPTER 11</p><p>Also, I need to pee.</p><p>But I can\u2019t see anything like san facilities in this corrugated steel box. Dina has already started to rummage through the crates, looking for anything useful. The main house, with all associated amenities, is probably deeper inside the compound, but I don\u2019t think any of us want to go back out there until the drones have a chance to scout around and see what might be lurking in the dark.</p><p>Loras has settled down beside me, almost as if he\u2019s awaiting my orders, and March still holds Keri, who appears to have collapsed entirely. Rest is probably the best thing for her right now, but her breath still hitches as children\u2019s do when they\u2019ve cried themselves to sleep. Leaning against the wall, I watch Dina rooting around, tossing out items that may be useful. So far, she\u2019s found blankets, torch-tubes, and what looks like emergency rations.</p> <p>I snag one, tear the foil open, and yep, it\u2019s the olive green paste that tastes like nothing you\u2019d ever voluntarily eat, and yet simultaneously contains a whole day\u2019s worth of necessary nutrients. Why the hell can\u2019t they manufacture these in choclaste? Making a face, I hand one to Loras, who accepts it and downs his without shuddering. March is watching me, so I pass a pack to him as well. Even if I don\u2019t like him, I\u2019m not going to starve him while he can\u2019t get his own. He\u2019s still got Keri as deadweight.</p><p>Dina grabs a couple more and hands them out to the Gunnar and Doc, who opens his eyes reluctantly. Everyone eats in silence. It\u2019s hard to know what the hell to say after a day like we\u2019ve had. The Gunnar just sits like a small mountain, probably thinking about his brothers.</p><p>But then I remember I had a couple questions that just won\u2019t keep and glance at March again. Seems like he\u2019d know. \u201cHow did Mair\u2014\u201d</p><p>He pitches his voice low. \u201cShe was a first-rank chi-master, one of the last.\u201d</p><p>I blink at that. \u201cNo shit?\u201d</p><p>March gives me a withering look. But I didn\u2019t even know they existed. All I\u2019ve ever heard is stories\u2014Old Terra monks, who could adjust their breathing, stop their hearts. The greatest of them could completely control their chi, resulting in superhuman feats. Like the burst of speed Mair summoned when we needed it most.</p><p>\u201cDid she have a student?\u201d I ask. And his gaze goes to the girl sleeping in his arms. Well, of course. Everything comes back to Keri.</p><p>I sigh. What can I possibly offer to counterbalance her loss? Why did she think I\u2019m worth it? Hell, I don\u2019t even think so, and I\u2019m generally the biggest proponent for the survival of Sirantha Jax.</p><p>Nothing I can do about it, though, and so I turn to Loras. He\u2019s been watching me almost in the same manner that he scanned the sky for things the rest of us couldn\u2019t see. It\u2019s a little unnerving, to tell the truth.</p><p>\u201cSo tell me about this shinai thing.\u201d</p><p>And March laughs quietly. \u201cThat\u2019s right. He\u2019s yours now. You don\u2019t know how long I\u2019ve waited for this day.\u201d</p><p>Call me cynical, but anything that makes March so happy cannot be good for me.</p><p>\u201cI am now your shinai,\u201d Loras tells me, but there\u2019s sharpness to his tone. \u201cThis means I will put your welfare ahead of my own and follow all your directives, except ones wherein you ask me to do harm. That, I cannot do, even for you.\u201d</p><p>What the frag...?</p><p>\u201cSounds an awful lot like slavery,\u201d I say.</p><p>Loras studies me for a moment as if he isn\u2019t sure if I\u2019m messing with him or not. \u201cThat is what shinai means in La\u2019hengrin,\u201d he answers at last. And yeah, there\u2019s a definite edge in his voice.</p><p>\u201cHow can she be so traveled and yet so ignorant?\u201d Dina asks of nobody in particular, but I\u2019m too busy glaring at March to respond to the insult.</p><p>\u201cYou have to be out of your mind if you think I\u2019m going to put up with keeping someone enslaved.\u201d Mary, I want to break his neck. I can\u2019t believe I\u2019ve jumped, even once, with someone so monstrous. I need to scrub my mind clean with a wire brush, everywhere he touched it. Bastard. \u201cNo,\u201d I tell Loras, shaking my head. \u201cIf there\u2019s a ceremony or something, let\u2019s do it because\u2014\u201d</p><p>His blue eyes burn as he claps his palm over my mouth. \u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d he begs, although his gaze says something else entirely. \u201cYou cannot deny me, or I will die. The La\u2019heng cannot exist outside the protection of another species. It is part of the legacy your people left us.\u201d</p><p>Godammit, before I can help myself, I glance to March for confirmation. I fragging hate that I keep doing that. But he\u2019s nodding. \u201cDid you really think I run a slave ship, Jax?\u201d Even though he doesn\u2019t say another word, I sense his disappointment. And maybe I have let him down. Because even though there\u2019s no liking between us, maybe there was a nascent respect.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re serious.\u201d Dumb-ass thing to say\u2014of course he\u2019s serious, and suddenly I do feel ignorant. I have no idea who the La\u2019heng are or why they need to be...shinai. Even mentally I shy away from the real word\u2014slave.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he answers quietly. \u201cWhen humanity first visited La\u2019heng, we did not greet them warmly. We killed all of their delegations, rebuffed all attempts to establish contact. They correctly adjudged us a hostile alien race and took steps to civilize us.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t know how long ago this was, don\u2019t know anything about this\u2014I have lived in an oddly insular world, made up of Kai and my CO, who directed me where to jump and to whom I reported when I felt like taking a holiday. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>Hate that I\u2019m making him talk about it when it clearly bothers him. Deep down, I know I\u2019m going to hear a tale of conquest and subjugation, and that it\u2019s another thing I can feel guilty for, although it\u2019s racial, not personal.</p><p>\u201cThey seeded our atmosphere with a chemical that dampened our ability to fight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRC-12,\u201d the doc puts in. \u201cIt\u2019s generally only used to sedate violent criminals. It had never been used on a global scale before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey took La\u2019heng bloodlessly,\u201d Loras goes on, monotone. \u201cAnd fed us more drugs to keep us compliant. They didn\u2019t take into account our physiology. We adapt quickly, integrate changes. The RC-12 produced a new generation of La\u2019heng young incapable of fighting, even to defend their own lives. We\u2019re helpless.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I\u2019m starting to understand, and my stomach rolls over, full of that disgusting paste and burning shame. \u201cSo it was decided you each needed a...protector?\u201d I can\u2019t make myself say \u201cmaster,\u201d but that\u2019s what it means. What we\u2019ve done.</p><p>Loras nods. \u201cAt birth, we\u2019re bonded to someone, who ostensibly will safeguard us and treat us well. Since many of us have a flair for languages, we are sought after on board ships.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t stay with your protectors for life?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGenerally,\u201d he says. \u201cBut we can be inherited, like property. And if someone saves our lives, outside the family line to which we\u2019re bound, then shinai transfers to that new person, a sort of life link, I suppose.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI got him from my great-uncle,\u201d March says then. \u201cBut he\u2019s yours now.\u201d</p><p>Mother Mary of Anabolic Grace.</p><p>\u201cAnd if I refuse\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll die. It was decided that a quick death is preferable for any La\u2019heng unfortunate enough to find himself without protection due to what might befall him thereafter.\u201d Loras regards me, mouth compressed.</p><p>Which explains why they were all studiously ignoring his distress. It doesn\u2019t make it more acceptable, but they all knew what might happen if they intervened. And March, who should\u2019ve been looking out for him, probably couldn\u2019t tell what was going on, all the way in front.</p> <p>I exhale in a tired rush. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about that. I\u2019ll try to be a good...whatever. I\u2019ll watch your back and let you do as you please, okay? Can we think of it as friendship more than obligation?\u201d</p><p>Loras stares at me for a long moment. \u201cCould you think of one to whom you are wholly subservient as a friend?\u201d</p><p>Guess not. I\u2019m suddenly exhausted and still need to pee.</p><p>CHAPTER 12</p><p>\u201cDo it outside,\u201d March dares me. Mocking. I\u2019d almost forgotten he could do that. \u201cGo see if it\u2019s safe for the rest of us.\u201d</p><p>And for Mary\u2019s sake, that\u2019s the last straw. I just nod and make for the door. If that\u2019s what he thinks I\u2019m good for, live bait, the doll you dangle into the cage to see if the monster\u2019s sleeping, then fragging fine. I don\u2019t see what happens thereafter, but he catches me just before I go out, spinning me back to face him. Keri\u2019s curled up on her side, where he presumably dumped her as he came scrambling after me.</p> <p>\u201cAre you crazy?\u201d he demands.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d I hold his look, and I\u2019m just too tired to try to hide anything from him, not that I could entirely. He gets it all, one way or another, then with a muffled oath, he pulls me into his arms, gentle as he was with Keri.</p><p>My whole world\u2019s upside down as he runs his hands over my back. March is just never, ever nice to me. I don\u2019t have any idea how long it\u2019s been since he found me on Perlas Station, but it seems like eternity. I can\u2019t remember not hating March at this point; it\u2019s the one truth to which I cling.</p><p>\u201cLet me go before I cut your nuts off,\u201d I tell him, then wonder why I sound like that. Soft. Broken. A not-Jax voice.</p><p>\u201cWill you just shag her already?\u201d Dina throws a torch-tube at March, hitting him in the side of the head with a satisfying thunk. The light comes on as it lands at his feet.</p><p>I think I love that woman. Because he breaks away to glare at her, and I step back. \u201cI was just trying to keep her from killing herself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure you were.\u201d Now the doc\u2019s giving him hell. \u201cAnd that\u2019s why you were finger-checking her scapula and vertebrae so carefully for possible injuries, too.\u201d</p><p>Can\u2019t help but snicker.</p> <p>\u201cI hate you all,\u201d March growls. His expression adds, What\u2019d I do to deserve this?</p><p>It seems like Dina registers that because she answers the implicit question. \u201cDuh. You hired us out of Gehenna. That\u2019s where all the assholes hang out. You were there, weren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe makes a strong case,\u201d I admit.</p><p>Oddly enough, I feel better, less alone. I still need to pee, but I\u2019m not willing to feed myself to the Teras to do so. We\u2019re all surprised to hear the Gunnar finally speak up; he\u2019s been quiet so long.</p><p>\u201cWe need to recall the drones, get a look at their security cams,\u201d he says. \u201cIf it seems clear, we can make a run for the house. Alternative is to play it safe, stay here until daybreak. It might be a long night, but at least we\u2019ll get where we\u2019re going.\u201d</p><p>At that, March nods and snags Keri\u2019s bag, rummages until he finds a remote. \u201cThink this is it, let\u2019s have a look at what\u2019s out there.\u201d</p><p>He inputs a few commands, and about five minutes later, there\u2019s a metallic clang as the drones try to proceed through the closed door. Bright, they aren\u2019t. We open it just enough for them to pass through, then close it. Bolt it again.</p><p>Everyone watches as the Gunnar reviews the footage, grainy, low-tech stuff. But nothing seems to be moving out there.</p><p>\u201cYou think they\u2019re all dead?\u201d Loras asks.</p><p>I can see why that\u2019d be a particular concern for him, seeing as he can\u2019t fight, at all. Not even monsters. He\u2019s reliant on me now for his protection. And if that\u2019s not the shittiest twist of fate ever, I don\u2019t know what is.</p><p>\u201cHard telling. If they\u2019ve all fed...\u201d The Gunnar pauses, and I know he\u2019s thinking about his brothers, taken within the compound proper. \u201cThen they might be nesting.\u201d</p><p>March folds his arms. \u201cIt\u2019s choosing time. I\u2019ll have to take Keri. I don\u2019t think she\u2019s going to wake up for a while, and even if she does, she won\u2019t be fit to run.\u201d</p><p>Saul clears his throat. \u201cEspecially given the fact that I sedated her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe should wait,\u201d I say quietly. \u201cIt\u2019s stupid to go when we\u2019re safe enough here. We have blood all over us, so if there are any in the compound, they\u2019ll catch the scent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDaylight won\u2019t help us survive them,\u201d Loras observes. \u201cIt\u2019ll just give us longer to feel afraid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll be wanting to return to the caves by then.\u201d For once, March seems to be agreeing with me. \u201cWe have a better shot of everyone making it if we do wait.\u201d</p><p>The solution\u2019s simple, and I have to wonder why I didn\u2019t think of it before. \u201cGot an idea. Saul, can I have your shirt?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not being a perv; he\u2019s just got the most blood on his clothing. After a few seconds\u2019 hesitation, he pulls it over his head, and I toss him back his coat. They watch as I tie the sleeves around the first drone and push it outside. And the Gunnar nods like it\u2019s a sound notion\u2014</p><p>But holy shit, I hear wings, and Loras trembles, hands over his ears, since they must be screaming right outside the door. One of them slams hard against the reinforced metal, and I swallow, hoping they can\u2019t smell us through the building, that their claws aren\u2019t strong enough to get through these walls. I hear the sound of the drone being smashed to bits.</p><p>Oh, Mother Mary, no, please don\u2019t let me have fucked this up.</p><p>I don\u2019t notice I\u2019m rocking back and forth on my heels until March puts a hand on my shoulder to steady me. \u201cIt was a good idea,\u201d he tells me softly. \u201cWe\u2019d have died trying to get to the main house. We\u2019re safe in here. And this way, nobody secretly feels we\u2019re being too cautious.\u201d A little louder, he adds, \u201cGoing to call the Dahlgren First and have him spread word that there are Teras inside the perimeter.\u201d Shortly thereafter, he gets on the radio and does so.</p><p>Throat thick, I nod. I\u2019ve just realized that if I\u2019d gone outside to pee, well, what happened to the drone, that\u2019d be me right now. He really did save my life. Oh shit. I have a smart-ass comment about being his shinai on the tip of my tongue when, for probably the first time in my life, I hold it. Not because March deserves something more sincere, although he does, but because what\u2019s been done to the La\u2019heng just isn\u2019t something I should joke about. And at least I\u2019ve caught myself before I can be an insensitive asshole.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I answer. I\u2019m not just saying that because he complimented me. And by the shine of his dark eyes, he knows that.</p><p>He just shrugs, but it feels like an apology, as if he knows he pushed too far. It\u2019ll do. Dina\u2019s watching us, and she just rolls her eyes, smirking. \u201cLet\u2019s get some bio in place if we\u2019re staying the night,\u201d is all she says.</p><p>All she really wants is two empty buckets, and we argue a little bit. I finally say, \u201cOkay, you must get off on guys watching you piss, then. I\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t realize.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBitch.\u201d But she\u2019s smiling as she helps me rig a primitive setup of blankets on wire fastened to the shelving on either side.</p><p>I\u2019m the first to test out the ladies\u2019 bucket and man, I think I have a peegasm when I finally let go, groaning. The guys are all smirking when I come out. I know they heard me, but whatever, dammit. Can we try to be a little bit grown-up? Please?</p><p>March seems to think about that, then shakes his head. But he grins at me. He\u2019s removed his jacket, tucked it underneath Keri\u2019s head. I dislike seeing the gentle side of him; makes him harder to hate, and I\u2019ve been doing that so well. Doing my best to ignore both him and Loras, who I swear is trying to piss me off with his attentive-slave impression, I walk past and drop down beside the Gunnar, who looks as sad as a human can without actually weeping.</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s your name?\u201d I mean obviously it\u2019s something Gunnar, but surely they don\u2019t just number the big lugs.</p><p>\u201cLex,\u201d he answers tiredly. \u201cAlexander.\u201d His gaze goes to Keri, and I wonder what\u2019s on his mind. \u201cI\u2019m going to have to marry her,\u201d he adds, when he sees me looking. He sounds about as pleased about that as I\u2019d be to hook up with March.</p><p>Really starting to like that glare, by the way.</p><p>\u201cHow come?\u201d I think he needs to talk more than I want to know. And that\u2019s fine.</p><p>\u201cClan competition is fierce here,\u201d he tells me. \u201cAs I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve figured out. We have to race for new technology, resources. Everything. There\u2019s a very definite hierarchy, and we two have been at each other for the top spot for years now. That\u2019s why we went after you so hard. Couldn\u2019t let Dahlgren get the edge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow the hell do I qualify as either?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCommerce,\u201d he tells me. \u201cRight now, the only source of trained jumpers is via the Corp. They control all trade, more or less, although they would deny that\u2019s their intent with their refusal to permit unaffiliated academies. Imagine the money that could be made if someone successfully created an alternative.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou not only want to try and figure out what makes me tick, you also want me to train jumpers for you.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ve put the pieces together now. My disgrace on Matins IV probably seemed like a hell of an opportunity. How often does a jumper wind up like that? Ordinarily they\u2019d have no hope of turning one of us; part of our indoctrination is a \u201cCorp for life\u201d mentality. That\u2019s what No-chin meant when he said the Gunnars would pay more, and it\u2019d be better for all concerned if I signed with them. Teaching...never even thought of that. Obviously, the Corp has instructors, former jumpers, who choose retirement over burnout, and they impart what we need to know about grimspace. We make our first practice jumps with them, all jacked into a test ship that simulates what we\u2019ll one day do all by ourselves. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He nods. \u201cWe could create new trade routes. Establish a free market, and it would help a lot of outposts, not having to pay Corp tariffs for their supplies. But Mother Mary, in one day, such losses...\u201d Lex closes his eyes. \u201cThe only hope either clan has now is consolidation. We become Gunnar-Dahlgren, marry up, and combine our ranks, or we get wiped by the other clans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen shell freezesh over,\u201d Keri says, slurred, sedated.</p><p>\u201cWell, put on your overcoat, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>Hard to say who looks more shocked to hear that coming from March.</p> <p>CHAPTER 13</p><p>The inevitable argument\u2019s postponed when Keri passes out again.</p><p>March pulls her up against him, a wise idea\u2014sharing body heat since this shed lacks climate control. But everyone\u2019s regarding him speculatively, wondering what he has in mind. Being March, in the face of such avid curiosity, he leans his head back against the wall, closes his eyes, and goes to sleep. Just like that.</p><p>Hits me then\u2014that\u2019s a soldier\u2019s skill, being able to turn off and on. It\u2019s an invaluable talent, one that allows them to stand watch easier...but it takes years in the field to develop it, usually on rough assignments. I frown as I study him, trying to put the pieces together. He\u2019s clearly a merc, and I\u2019m willing to bet if I got a glimpse of his bare chest, he\u2019d have some battle scars to show. Not that I want to see March without a shirt, Mary forefend. But how does a Psi-sensitive stay hidden for so long? And he\u2019s clearly got some ability to control it, or he would be nuts by now.</p><p>There\u2019s something about that bugging me, some thought I had that would help me figure him out, but right now I\u2019m just too tired to get a fix on it. As I\u2019m sitting there, rubbing my hands over my arms absently, Loras brings me one of the spare blankets. I wish it was a genuine kindness, but I can tell by his expression it\u2019s part of the whole shinai thing. No wonder March was so glad to have it end\u2014being served by someone who resents it with every fiber of his being, well, it kind of sucks. I mean, not the help. I\u2019m glad of the blanket, and I wrap up in it with a murmured, \u201cThanks.\u201d</p> <p>But just the fact Loras feels like he has to wait on me. I hate that.</p><p>It\u2019s cold enough in here that I can see my own breath. With all the other stuff going on, I hadn\u2019t noticed...but I gave Doc back his coat when I fed his shirt to the Teras, and I\u2019m freezing. Loras stands for a moment, staring down at me. He\u2019s wearing a simple pair of trousers and pullover, so I don\u2019t know how his teeth aren\u2019t chattering.</p><p>Glance across the room and find Dina looking extremely pissed off, since she\u2019s sandwiched between Doc and Gunnar. \u201cSay \u2018cream filling,\u2019 and I kill you. Seriously.\u201d</p><p>I muffle a laugh, but I manage not to say it. Somehow.</p><p>\u201cYou want me to...?\u201d Loras gestures at the others, huddled up.</p><p>And I hate even more that he feels like he needs to ask permission. Mother Mary, it\u2019s common sense. I scowl up at him. I am not personally to blame for what my race did to his, however long ago.</p> <p>\u201cOkay, you have to follow my directives, right?\u201d At his nod, I continue, \u201cThen you\u2019re forbidden to do anything but what you want. And if you\u2019d like to come down here so we can both get warm, do that. If not, do what the hell ever. Because I\u2019m tired, and I am sick of this shit.\u201d</p><p>At this, March\u2019s eyes snap open, and now he looks extremely pissed. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I never thought of that.\u201d</p><p>Bastard was faking, so he wouldn\u2019t have to answer questions. He gives me a grin and closes his eyes again, while Loras stands there, looking dumbfounded. \u201cIt would be very foolish for both of us to be cold,\u201d he says finally, and drops down beside me.</p><p>I get the feeling this is the first time anyone\u2019s said that to him. Hope it\u2019s easier on him, and me, too, for that matter. I\u2019m not cut out to go around giving orders about every little thing. Too much of that, and I\u2019d be killing him instead of watching his back.</p><p>\u201cGood call.\u201d</p><p>He settles in beside me, shoulder to shoulder, and we wrap up in a second blanket. Takes a little while, but I can feel myself warming up, and as my body temperature rises, I get sleepy. Gonna close my eyes for a minute...</p><p>Next thing I know, I\u2019m feeling so good, not exactly sure where I am, and it doesn\u2019t matter because I\u2019m toasty warm, lying in someone\u2019s arms. I nuzzle my nose against his throat, stretching luxuriously. I want to make love, soft and slow. My half-awake brain tells me it must be Kai, because he\u2019s the only one I ever slept with like this, and then the other half rouses and points out that\u2019s impossible.</p><p>My eyes snap open.</p> <p>A torch-tube glows in the middle of the room, providing a little light. Enough to see that March\u2019s face is right above mine, and he knows. The floor can open up to admit me now, thanks. At some point, he must\u2019ve given Keri to Loras and come to huddle with me himself, though damned if I know why.</p><p>\u201cYou were whimpering in your sleep,\u201d he whispers. \u201cAnd jabbing with your elbow. Almost broke his nose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you thought you could fix it?\u201d I pitch my voice low because the others are all still sleeping, but I\u2019m angry over his presumption, angry that I slept better in his arms than I have since Kai died.</p><p>He shrugs. \u201cIf nothing else, I\u2019m too big for you to hurt me.\u201d At my look, he adds, \u201cOkay, too big for you to hurt accidentally.\u201d</p><p>And he doesn\u2019t need to say that I settled down as soon as he pulled me close. I know I did; I can almost remember the dreams that made me restless, and I can almost see his resigned expression as he pulled me against his chest, wrapped his arms about me, can almost hear my own small sound as I relaxed like it\u2019s somewhere I\u2019m supposed to be. I really am insane. I remember Dina mentioning that he lost someone in the crash, and I want to know more. Does he blame me? Should he?</p><p>I don\u2019t even know the answer to that.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you hate me so much?\u201d For a moment, I can\u2019t believe I asked. It\u2019s got to be the false intimacy, sound of other people breathing, lying in his arms in the dark.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t...hate you.\u201d His voice sounds gruff.</p><p>I gaze up at his face, trying to read his expression, defeated by shadows\u2019 fall. \u201cDislike me profoundly and intensely, before we ever met.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, I\u2019m not having this conversation right now. Go to sleep, Jax.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo to hell, March.\u201d But I\u2019m smiling as I say it.</p><p>As I doze off again, I\u2019m pretty sure he says, \u201cBeen there, done that, and I\u2019m keeping a spot warm for you, babe.\u201d</p><p>The next time I wake up, it\u2019s to hear:</p><p>\u201cNo. How can you ask me to do this, March? It\u2019s monstrous and barbaric.\u201d</p><p>Great. I guess they\u2019re making wedding plans. My eyelids feel like they\u2019ve got paste under them, and I am, mercifully, by myself. Maybe I dreamed that whole weird interlude during the night. Please let me have dreamed it.</p><p>Because I don\u2019t want to carry the awareness that I fit nicely against March\u2019s chest and that his heartbeat is a comforting way to fall asleep. I especially don\u2019t want to remember rubbing my face against his throat and liking it. I think I need to kill him. For a moment, I try to imagine a giant rock landing on him, but I can\u2019t\u2014</p><p>Mother Mary, I am deranged. Because I can\u2019t bring myself to picture any real harm coming to him. In fact, it alarms me to think of losing him. When nothing else makes sense, he\u2019s rock solid. Inexplicably, I feel like I can count on him.</p><p>I\u2019m defanged where he\u2019s concerned. Or something. It hurts when I press, a wound I didn\u2019t even know I had. I don\u2019t want to rely on him in any capacity. Mary knows, I\u2019ve learned the hard way that nothing lasts forever.</p><p>\u201cIf you would stop thinking like a stupid kid for a minute,\u201d the Gunnar says, \u201cyou\u2019d realize this is the only way to save both our clans.\u201d</p><p>Oh smooth, Lex. That\u2019s the way to get the girl.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a stupid kid...I just hate you! Which seems to be the best proof of my intellect that I could offer.\u201d</p><p>Wonder if that\u2019s how March and I sound. If so, that\u2019d be why people think we want to shag each other. And maybe they\u2019re not entirely wrong, since I can\u2019t deny he has a certain raw charisma. Regardless, I\u2019m now convinced that Keri\u2019s going to wind up a Gunnar. It\u2019s a foregone conclusion.</p><p>I climb out of my warm nest and start folding up the blankets. Someone\u2019s already been outside to empty the buckets, so I guess that means it\u2019s safe. Everyone seems to be here. Dina, Doc, and Loras are sucking on packets of paste, looking no more pleased than I\u2019d be if I were eating one. All three are riveted on the funny little love triangle, funny because I don\u2019t think March realized until now that all his protectiveness had created one gi-enormous crush.</p><p>Which makes me wonder how he missed it, being Psi and all. He can\u2019t seem to help rummaging around my head like it\u2019s a jumble sale, but he has no clue what\u2019s going on with Keri? Interesting.</p><p>Case in point, he turns to glare at me.</p><p>CHAPTER 14</p><p>It\u2019s sputtering snow when we finally emerge from the storage shed, from what felt like an endless night, into a white-gray morning. There\u2019s a lesson in that, I think. No matter how interminable something feels, there is always, always an ending. Sometimes that\u2019s good, and sometimes it\u2019s bad; sometimes it\u2019s a matter of indifference, and sometimes it\u2019s heartbreaking, and your life is never the same thereafter.</p><p>March surprises me by holding up a hand as the others set off. I wait without protest, but not because of what happened last night. That\u2019s not it. Is it? He goes back into the building and brings me a blanket, wraps me up in it poncho style. I give him a half smile, not understanding the shift.</p><p>But I murmur, \u201cThank you,\u201d and we go along behind the others, him matching his strides to my shorter ones. The silence is oddly companionable.</p><p>Fried and fallen Teras bodies lie strewn all along the perimeter. They died in the night, trying to return to the caves, and in death they lose their camouflage. Dark and ugly, like something from a child\u2019s stories\u2014it is difficult to believe something like this evolved naturally. The stench is dreadful, and more than once I swallow down bile that wants to become vomit, but I don\u2019t have anything to upchuck. The paste metabolizes quickly so your body receives the nutrients right away. And I chose not to eat it this morning; I\u2019m hoping there will be something better at the main house.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t been fair to you,\u201d he says, so quietly I almost don\u2019t catch it.</p><p>But he said it. I know he did. I actually stop walking. Pause and gape up at him. \u201cYou\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou heard me.\u201d March scowls down at me, and I know he doesn\u2019t like saying it any more than I would. \u201cI\u2019m going to do better.\u201d</p><p>Our eyes meet, and I notice for the first time that his eyes aren\u2019t simply dark; they possess gold flecks as well, an amber ring around the iris. He also has the most ridiculous lashes I\u2019ve ever seen on a man, a sharp contrast to his hard-hewn face. He\u2019s almost too rough-featured in fact, unless you focus on those long lashes. After that look, mustering a smart-ass response takes some doing. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWell, it\u2019d be hard for you to do worse. Come on.\u201d</p><p>We start walking, and I increase my pace to catch up with the others. I don\u2019t want Dina thinking I want private time with March. Mary forefend.</p><p>I don\u2019t know what I expected, not like I had a chance to look around last night. But the compound seems to be a series of outbuildings along a path that leads up to the main house, a structure of old-fashioned stonework. The whole enclave is surrounded by intricate wire-and-steel fencing, crackling an electrical warning as we pass by.</p><p>As we near the main house, clansmen whose names I don\u2019t know come to meet us. They live in what I take to be apartments or longhouses nearby. Keri greets them and invites them inside. The rest of us trail in her wake, and I gaze around, surprised at the elegance of her home.</p> <p>Floors are marble, walls are paneled, and if it\u2019s not real marble, real wood, then they still paid a fortune for such high-quality synth. It even rings true when I rap my knuckles on it in passing. They have Giovanni paintings and sculptures from the Sheng Dynasty, just before Taiwan was reclaimed by China, or so my spotty recollection of Old Terra history suggests. It\u2019s a gorgeous place, and I feel bad just walking on this rug. My shoes sink six centimeters, and who knows what\u2019s on them?</p><p>We proceed to a meeting hall that looks almost like a senate chamber. Keri proceeds to the podium, where a Speaker would ordinarily stand, and she does so with a dignity I wouldn\u2019t have expected. Once there, she advises her clansmen of the bad tidings with solemn poise, and in turn, they report some losses in the night. One day, she will be a woman of great strength, I think. Depressing to contemplate, when she reaches her prime, I will be quite old if I even survive that long.</p><p>\u201cLeadership is what separates a principal clan from a weak one,\u201d she tells her people, once the initial shuffling has ceased. \u201cAnd they will not yet listen to my voice on the Clan Council. Alone, I cannot hope to hold the position of strength we have enjoyed. So it is with a heavy heart that I propose consolidation. In making a marital merger with clan Gunnar, we double our holdings, double our population, and double our resources. Hereafter, the clan lines will be joined and known as Gunnar-Dahlgren. I put the proposition to a vote, as it affects the way you live, as much as me.\u201d</p><p>The rumble of voices greets her pronouncement, and I watch from my vantage near the back. I don\u2019t know how this impacts me, but I feel a peculiar tension, studying her face. Glancing at the Gunnar, I see his investment in the proceedings. Both clans have lost so much. From what I can gather, they are taking a vote. A black bead means no, a white one means yes, and they pass around a silver dish. It is a remarkably elegant system for its simplicity. Finally, a dark-haired man stands, having counted the tokens, spokesman by some tacit understanding or perhaps tradition.</p><p>\u201cRydal.\u201d Keri recognizes him with a nod.</p> <p>\u201cThe vote is tallied in favor of consolidation,\u201d he says with sad gravity. \u201cWe judge it preferable to a hostile takeover.\u201d</p><p>Although I am not sure, I guess that would involve wholesale slaughter of the clan and seizing all assets and territories. March catches my eye and nods. I feel like I\u2019ve just seen the world change in some fashion this morning, and I don\u2019t understand the sensation. Lachion has never influenced the larger universe so far as I\u2019m aware; these are mudsider politics, nothing that will make a difference.</p><p>Keri inclines her head, then fixes a pale green gaze on the Gunnar. \u201cHave your First speak to mine; we have contracts to negotiate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy First died out on the Nejanna Plain,\u201d he tells her flatly. \u201cIt will take time to decide who should fill the breach.\u201d</p><p>You can almost see the sparks crackling between them, and I decide they\u2019re going to be bitching at each other longer than I really want to listen. Seems like I\u2019m not the only one who feels that way because the Dahlgren clansmen trickle out in twos and threes, and even Doc shifts his weight on the balls of his feet.</p><p>I clear my throat. \u201cBreakfast?\u201d</p> <p>Even though I direct the question to nobody in particular, Loras pushes away from the wall and beckons me. I fall in step beside him as he says, \u201cI\u2019ll show you to the dining hall. There\u2019s usually something laid out for another hour or so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCommunal meals?\u201d I can\u2019t imagine the workload that must mean for the cooks. Unless...\u201cDo they have food processors?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe lesser clans, no. Some are astonishingly low-tech, but this one has done well. There are even bots in charge of cleaning and maintenance here.\u201d</p><p>That remark reminds me of my cell AI, and my mouth tightens. \u201cFantastic. Can we expect...Oh, that smells good.\u201d</p><p>Something sweet and smooth is brewing. I know the scent, I\u2019ve had it once before\u2014it\u2019s a hot drink that goes into your veins like pure chem, leaves you bouncing until you crash. I seem to remember it\u2019s highly addictive. There\u2019s also the aroma of honeyed pastries, fried s-meat, and some kind of fruit, a sharp, succulent tang. We come into a large open room with a couple of bots circulating, ostensibly keeping track of the food laid out on a long table. It\u2019s a well-lit space with windows on three walls, arrayed with round tables.</p><p>I make myself a sandwich out of the meat and the sweetbread while Loras looks on in horrified astonishment. \u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019re supposed to...\u201d</p><p>Shrugging, I say, \u201cIt gets the job done,\u201d and take an enormous bite.</p><p>Actually it\u2019s better than I expected, this blend of sweet and savory. He sighs and fastidiously selects some fruit. We\u2019ve almost finished by the time the crew catches up with us. I\u2019m drinking a cup of the dark, pungent stuff that will probably make me jittery; the taste is a little difficult to pin down, but it seems to have a trace of choclaste.</p> <p>I don\u2019t know what happens next.</p><p>But as March drops down in the chair opposite me with a smile, I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019m not going to like it.</p><p>CHAPTER 15</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re serious,\u201d I say, after hearing what they have in mind.</p><p>March nods. \u201cThat\u2019s the plan.\u201d</p><p>Doc looks faintly apologetic, as if he suspected what my reaction would be. And if he supposed I\u2019d be horrified at the thought of a ten-planet tour, all in different quadrants, without scheduled R&amp;R, well, he\u2019d be right. That doesn\u2019t even factor in the expectation of recruiting unregistered J-gene carriers for our as-yet-fictitious academy. And what about the gray men hunting me? The minute I\u2019m ret-scanned in any Corp way station, they\u2019re going to dispatch the nearest unit.</p><p>With some effort, I manage to make myself sound reasonable and not just start ranting, my first impulse. \u201cLook, first, you\u2019re talking about a really long haul. I\u2019ve always had plenty of rest between jumps, and we don\u2019t know what our timetable will be. I have no idea what this could do to me.\u201d</p><p>Dina leans forward, elbows on the table. \u201cIt kills you.\u201d</p><p>Something in her gray eyes tells me she\u2019s talking about Edaine. And I won\u2019t go there with her right now, though I know I\u2019m not the reason the other jumper pushed herself so hard. She might\u2019ve made her last flight as a sacrifice for me, but I didn\u2019t cause her total burnout. That decision was hers, and I\u2019m just a convenient source of expiation.</p><p>\u201cEverybody dies,\u201d I answer. \u201cIt\u2019s just a matter of when and whether you do anything worthwhile beforehand.\u201d But I don\u2019t take it any further, and as far as I\u2019m concerned, that\u2019s a concession. Instead, I ask, \u201cWhat am I supposed to say anyway? \u2018Come join our renegade training facility. No, we don\u2019t have anything built yet, but they\u2019re working on that while I find the founding class.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cI expect you\u2019ll refine the verbiage,\u201d Loras puts in. \u201cThat\u2019s part of your skill set, isn\u2019t it? It\u2019s why you were so good at making first contact.\u201d</p><p>And damn him, he\u2019s right. I do have a knack for swinging luck my way. Always have had\u2014it\u2019s one reason I live through things that destroy everyone around me.</p><p>\u201cThe gray men\u2014\u201d I start to object, but March shakes his head.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t be traveling first-class anymore, Jax. No more clean Corp stations.\u201d</p><p>Takes me a minute, but I get it. We\u2019ll be avoiding regulated routes, slinging out through the beacon nearest our objective, then scrambling signal so they can\u2019t tell where we\u2019ve gone. There are a pretty low number of potential destinations at each point, so they may locate us via legwork, but that will slow them down some.</p><p>By keeping on the move, we stay one jump ahead of them. Literally. That means I won\u2019t have long to convince the unregistered resources to join up. It sounds crazy; the Corp is just so big. How can we imagine, even for a moment, that we might muster the resources to challenge its monopoly? Grimspace belongs to the Corp; it\u2019s an undisputed reality and has been, longer than I\u2019ve been alive.</p><p>I realize I don\u2019t even know the details of how Clericon Stellar went down. They were a start-up like we hope to be, and they failed. If we\u2019re going to do this, I need to find out why. Information may be our only hope. There might even be other renegade jumpers, although I\u2019ve heard nothing. Stands to reason the Corp wouldn\u2019t want that getting out. In fact, I bet I\u2019ve been listed as officially flatline by now, so maybe they\u2019ve called off the gray squads and are pursuing me through unofficial means.</p><p>As my training informed me, Corp intelligence tracks our jumps into grimspace and there are pinch-faced men that go over flickering screens, trying to make the numbers match up. Of course, in revealing this, they were reassuring us that we wouldn\u2019t get lost. But now it makes me wonder how many unsanctioned jumpers their data miners tallied and what happened to those people if they got caught.</p><p>Deep down I don\u2019t need to be told; I know. And unless I want it to happen to me, I\u2019ve got to make this work. It\u2019s a different life. No more am I Sirantha Jax, Corp superstar. Now I\u2019m just Jax, and I need to prove myself all over again. Well, that\u2019s fine. I\u2019ve survived worse.</p><p>I don\u2019t let myself think about Kai.</p><p>Glancing up from my silver mug, I find them all staring at me. \u201cOkay.\u201d I glance at Doc. \u201cWhat\u2019s the first planet on the list? And how did you find these sources? The Corp has tons of people constantly looking for the same thing. There aren\u2019t enough J-gene carriers to replenish the pool, based on burnout rate. In about ten turns, there aren\u2019t going to be enough trained jumpers left to meet demand.\u201d</p><p>Saul pulls a silk screen datapad from his pants pocket and slides it across the table toward me. I hit the lower left corner to increase resolution so I can read, and first it\u2019s just a list of names: Marakeq, Gestalt, Freeley, Darengo, Collins, Sureport, Venetia, Lark, Belsev, Quietus. But after a moment, it sinks in.</p><p>\u201cThese are all either nonhuman or class-P worlds.\u201d</p><p>The Corp doesn\u2019t interfere on class-P worlds, where native technology falls somewhere between Bronze Age and pre-Industrial. Once we make first contact, we log our findings, then categorize the planet as primitive. In most cases, we could determine that much from orbit, but the Corp likes to know the exact level of development: what sort of tools, customs, whatever we can learn in a single visit. After that, interstellar trade and travel remains restricted until such time as the citizens develop sufficient technology to come looking for us on their own. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Furthermore, those five class-P worlds? They\u2019re the ones where I made first contact, but I can\u2019t imagine myself going back to claim sons and daughters, taking them away to the sky. How in the hell can I rationalize that? Culture shock might kill them, let alone grimspace.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you grasp the scope of what Mair wanted to do,\u201d March says then.</p><p>\u201cSo tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe aren\u2019t interested in spiriting away a couple adventurous souls here and there,\u201d Saul explains. \u201cWe\u2019re looking to relocate whole villages\u2014we\u2019ll cull them from remote areas where their disappearance simply goes unsolved. Certain anomalies in Old Terra history make me believe this may have occurred before. Ever heard of Roanoke?\u201d I shake my head and he adds, \u201cNo matter. You needn\u2019t examine all the evidence as I have. But this is why Gunnar-Dahlgren needs to be fixed to support a surge in population. We\u2019re not simply starting an academy, although that\u2019s part of it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA colony of jumpers.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s a mammoth undertaking. I don\u2019t ask if they have transport ships. Surely they must have passenger freighters somewhere on this rock, if they\u2019re serious. I don\u2019t know how I feel about that. Part of me thinks any breeding experiment is doomed to failure, and Mary knows we\u2019ve seen bad results from this kind of thing, time and again. Purpose becomes twisted, and even a scientist with the best intentions, like Doc, gets swept up in the trappings of godhood. People shouldn\u2019t be pushed to mate to produce a certain type of child; I feel strongly about that.</p><p>\u201cNobody will be forced to do anything,\u201d March says with a disgusted sigh. \u201cDoc\u2019s isolated something that the Corp never saw. He\u2019s been going through medical records for years.\u201d Which doesn\u2019t quite explain how he found it, but maybe he\u2019s simply smarter than the average Corp scientist. Given that they\u2019re mostly bureaucrats these days, that hypothesis doesn\u2019t stretch my imagination much. \u201cSo there\u2019s another factor that determines how long someone can handle grimspace, and it\u2019s tied to the genotype.\u201d</p><p>He pauses, and we stare at each other. I feel as if he\u2019s willing me to make a mental leap, like he\u2019ll be disappointed in me if I can\u2019t put it together on my own. Then it dawns on me, a feeling of astonishment and awe\u2014sunrise on Ielos. I sat in the thermal rooms with Kai once, watching slow red-orange break of light refracted over the glaciers. That\u2019s how I feel now.</p><p>\u201cNot a bloodline,\u201d I say slowly. \u201cYou\u2019re looking to engineer a new species. You want human recruits from class-P worlds with strong J-gene strains. Alien DNA provides for longevity\u2014compensates for burnout.\u201d</p> <p>March watches me, probably tracking my mental processes. He knows when I work it out. I dub that unknown factor the L-gene, whatever allows inhuman navigators to withstand grimspace better than we do. A number of alien races can sense the beacons, but many despise us for our conquistador attitude, and the rest consider us food.</p><p>I say it aloud for the benefit of the others. \u201cYou\u2019re going to make something new from mingling alien and human DNA. I\u2019m right, aren\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>Dina crams the last of a sweetbread into her mouth and says through the crumbs, \u201cHey, you\u2019re not as dumb as you look after all.\u201d</p><p>Maybe I really was better off in my cell.</p><p>CHAPTER 16</p><p>So we\u2019re going to Marakeq.</p> <p>I wish I could say I enjoyed my time on Lachion, but with Lex and Keri growling like a pair of Anduvian ice otters in mating season, the rest of us just lay low. Barely, I manage to restrain a wince when I see that they\u2019re hauling crates of the nutri-paste, presumably to replenish our stores.</p><p>Great. We\u2019ll survive any emergency. We\u2019ll just wish we hadn\u2019t.</p><p>The morning of our departure, I run into Keri outside the training facility. I\u2019ve spent a lot of time in there because it gets the blood pumping, and pure physical exertion means I don\u2019t have to think. Something in her face tells me I\u2019m not going to like what\u2019s coming, and I brace myself instinctively. It\u2019s a wonder she hasn\u2019t confronted me before now; I feel responsible for a lot of her problems.</p><p>She doesn\u2019t say hello, merely looking me up and down with an air of indefinable scorn. I know what she sees, a woman past her prime with burn scars raying out from the edges of my workout gear, but I don\u2019t shift beneath the weight of her eyes. I just wait.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like you,\u201d she says at last. \u201cBut you\u2019re necessary to bring my grandmother\u2019s vision to fruition. Make no mistake, that\u2019s the only reason you\u2019re alive.\u201d</p><p>A bitchy reply springs to my tongue, but I swallow it down. I started trouble on this planet without knowing the rules. If I\u2019d made a habit of being that careless on other worlds, I\u2019d have died long before now, and this time, her family paid the price for my unsteady impulses. So I owe her, and she\u2019s entitled to hate me as much as she wants. Right now, I\u2019m none too fond of myself, either. I have to look at myself in the mirror, knowing I lived where eighty-two died, one of whom was the man I loved. Not to mention the loss of Miriam Jocasta, a diplomat of incredible eloquence and grace; she had been instrumental in achieving peace during the Axis Wars. The woman was an icon, and I killed her. Maybe. From the line of their questioning, the Psychs had certainly been inclined to think so, at any rate.</p><p>Frag, I wish I could remember.</p><p>\u201cYou want to go a few rounds with me?\u201d I blot away the sweat and head back to the training mat without waiting for an answer.</p> <p>Since she was Mair\u2019s pupil, she\u2019ll probably kick my ass ten ways from sunrise, given she\u2019s younger and faster and probably stronger, too. I\u2019ll take whatever she dishes out, but I won\u2019t hand it to her on a plate. She\u2019ll enjoy my beating more if she works for it.</p><p>Her smile seems tight somehow, wicked with anticipation. \u201cGladly. And should there ever come a day when I need you no longer, I\u2019ll see you dead.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s no more talk after that. She positions herself in a half crouch that I\u2019ve never seen before. No big surprise\u2014my combat training was purely perfunctory, augmented by a propensity for starting trouble in spaceport bars. Mary, she\u2019s fast. She\u2019s clocked me between the eyes with the heel of her hand before I hardly register the movement, and while I\u2019m reeling, she sweeps my legs out from under me.</p><p>I land hard on my back, exhaling with a huff, but I roll before she can smash her foot into my stomach. With a mental shrug, I grab her ankle and yank, thinking we\u2019ll take this fight to the ground, but she executes a neat maneuver that breaks my hold. The girl is good. After that, I submit to my beating; my fighting is clumsy as hell compared to hers. Sweat pours off me in rivers by the time she seems satisfied, maybe an hour later. I\u2019m aching in places where I didn\u2019t even know I had muscles, and there\u2019s a deep bruise forming where she kicked me in the hip.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019d wanted to, you could have taken those Gunnars by yourself.\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head. How I hate the fact that her perfect cheeks are simply flushed with a rosy glow. \u201cI\u2019d have needed Grandmother\u2019s help, but it was the height of stupidity to fight in the open. There\u2019s a reason we use ammunition that disables vehicles instead of causing bodily harm. There\u2019s a reason we fight our battles inside, safely in the confines of the clan arena.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know,\u201d I say, humbled. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about your father. And your grandmother. As for seeing me dead, well. Give it time. This ten-jump journey might do the trick.\u201d</p><p>She seems torn between pleasure in that prospect and chagrin. Finally, she responds, \u201cI hope not, for we\u2019ll still need you to head up our training academy when the program progresses to that point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEssentially then, you came to tell me that you are resigned to working with me to honor your grandmother\u2019s wishes.\u201d</p><p>For a moment, there is something regal in her young face, the set of her shoulders. I can imagine condemned princesses facing down their executioners with the same blend of fatality and poise. Maybe I don\u2019t entirely like Keri, but I respect her now.</p><p>And I think she knows that because a smile flickers at the edges of her mouth like a corrupt holo-file. \u201cKicking your ass was a nice bonus, though. I have too much business here to accompany you, but I wish you luck. Not that I think you\u2019ll need it with March heading the expedition.\u201d</p><p>Maybe she doesn\u2019t intend it so, but that feels like a barb, so I answer, \u201cYeah. At least you\u2019ll have Lex with you to get things done.\u201d</p><p>Her sharp inhalation sounds like a hiss. Yeah, I know. I\u2019m lucky she doesn\u2019t punch me in the face again. I probably deserve another black eye, but I\u2019ve never been good at the antiquated doctrine of turning the other cheek. Why give them the chance to hit you a second time? I say knock them out the first time they swing, a combative philosophy that probably explains my current situation.</p><p>But she surprises me by laughing. \u201cMuch as I hate the bastard, he does have a certain personal force.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a mountain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas his own gravity,\u201d Keri quips, and I realize we\u2019re smiling at each other.</p><p>Life goes on whether we want it to or not. And laughter is a constant.</p><p>\u201cGood luck rebuilding things,\u201d I tell her. \u201cGoing to clean up, then go get a good seat in the rover. I want to see what it\u2019s like all the way in back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish...\u201d She seems hesitant, and I pause, letting her assemble what she wants to say. \u201cThat is, Grandmother had all these ideas, tactics you were supposed to use, approaches for the different worlds. She\u2019d done extensive research on culture, traditions, both primitive and alien...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why she wanted to meet with me,\u201d I guess aloud. \u201cTo go over this stuff before we set out.\u201d</p><p>Keri nods. \u201cBut most of it was inside her head. Not long ago, she started to get suspicious of standard datapads and sys-terminals. She said the Corp could probably mine what you stored somehow or what you were searching for.\u201d</p><p>Once I\u2019d have dismissed that as the paranoid delusion of an old woman who\u2019d missed a few too many antiaging treatments. Now I consider the prospect for a moment before allowing, \u201cIt\u2019s possible. Do you have any of her research, at least? The info she unearthed regarding our target ten would save me retracing her steps.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give you her PA. Anything she stored would be in there. She wouldn\u2019t use standard datapads or sys-terms any longer. Just a moment.\u201d</p><p>Maybe five minutes later, Keri returns with a smooth silver sphere. I\u2019ve seen these before, although I\u2019ve never even held one. They\u2019re ridiculously expensive, closed to any other system, and require three levels of encryption confirmation before they will relinquish their data.</p><p>\u201cI hope you have her codes. Don\u2019t know anybody who can hack one of these.\u201d</p><p>She leans in and whispers.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d Nodding, I commit that to memory and pocket the device.</p><p>With a wave, I head off to the san-shower in my lodgings, which are substantially nicer than anywhere else I\u2019ve stayed. There\u2019s a sterile quality to any Corp quarters, regardless of locale, like they don\u2019t want you to feel at home. It\u2019s practical, choosing furnishings that are easy to clean and maintain with the constant rotation of crewmen in and out. But the end result remains unchanged; people don\u2019t want to stay. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My in-room wardrober contained only basic patterns, but I still prefer having my own clothes\u2014items in fabric, color, and style that I\u2019ve chosen myself. It\u2019s hard to be confident and in control when you\u2019re wearing what someone else selected. Makes you feel like a child, even if nobody ever picked out your clothes when you were a kid.</p><p>Casually, I rake my new things into a bag Dina donated. Yeah, I know; I expected the thing to blow up, but so far it hasn\u2019t, and there doesn\u2019t seem to be anything wrong with it, either. So I sling it over my shoulder and head for the rover. I\u2019m not going to check on anyone else. When I woke up in Med Bay, after Kai died, I promised myself I wouldn\u2019t let anyone get that close again.</p><p>Guess I\u2019m early because nobody\u2019s around yet. So I tap the door once, and the panel slides open, allowing me to grab a seat in back. If anyone shoots at us on this run, always a possibility here, I don\u2019t want to be under the gun hatch again. It\u2019s fragging cold, and I wrap up in my double-breasted s-wool overcoat to wait.</p><p>My patience doesn\u2019t last long, though, and I remember the PA in my pocket. I fish it out and thumb it on. It hums as it powers up, and a tiny little keypad ejects from the front, inexplicably reminding me of teeth. I\u2019m nervous as I enter the codes Keri gave me. For all I know these things detonate if keyed wrong, and my fingers feel big and clumsy. But no boom when I\u2019m done, just the sound of security disengaging as the thing clicks open, revealing a touch pad and a small data screen.</p> <p>The instant I touch the pressure point, though, a smooth, asexual voice speaks. \u201cWelcome, Mair Dahlgren. It has been seventeen days since your last entry.\u201d</p><p>Is this thing an AI or just part of the data entry software? Can it feel loneliness if neglected? I pause for a moment, then answer, \u201cThis isn\u2019t Mair. She died almost a week ago, and her granddaughter gave me this unit to assist in carrying out her final wishes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am sorry,\u201d says the little machine in a tone that approximates sincerity. \u201cPlease provide proof of identity with thumbprint and voice sample. Speak your name clearly, and I will update my records to reflect transference in ownership.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSirantha Jax.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a pause, then a ray of thin yellow light emits from the data screen, sweeps the upper arc of my face, and I realize I\u2019ve been ret-scanned. My heart thumps, thinking that the data will be beamed to the Corp along with my last-known location, and all this will have been for nothing. I\u2019ll wind up in the asylum after all, beneath Newel\u2019s tender care. Oh Mary\u2014</p> <p>\u201cCongratulations.\u201d The unit smoothly interrupts the near panic of my thoughts. \u201cYou are confirmed as new owner of PA-245. In the event you should misplace or forget your codes, depress the emergency access button on the bottom of the device, and I will offer you the choice of retinal scan, voice confirmation, or thumbprint to reset your security access.\u201d</p><p>Right, it\u2019s a closed system.</p><p>\u201cWhat if I want to change Mair\u2019s old codes?\u201d Keri knows them after all, and I don\u2019t trust people instinctively. This gadget is mine now, and I want whatever data I impart to remain confidential.</p><p>\u201cDo you?\u201d it asks.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Let\u2019s get that done.\u201d</p><p>Such an advanced interface. This can\u2019t be a simple software package. It\u2019s capable of reasoned interaction. Most programs would\u2019ve simply recited the instructions for doing so.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m bringing up input parameters on-screen. Please key the new codes, then confirm with reentry.\u201d</p><p>Wow. Maybe I\u2019m giving the thing too much credit, but it seems to understand why I wouldn\u2019t want to speak the code aloud, although voice recognition is clearly contained within its field of expertise. As I choose my three codes, then tap them in, twice, I wonder about its limits.</p><p>\u201cAre you an AI?\u201d</p><p>Is that a rude question?</p><p>\u201cNew codes confirmed,\u201d it advises me. And then, almost kindly: \u201cI am Artificial Intelligence 245, personal assistance and data management, fully equipped with the Helpful Administrator personality chip. Do you require further aid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Show me what Mair dug up on Marakeq. Please.\u201d I feel dumb adding the last word, but I can\u2019t help myself. There\u2019s something...different about this little machine.</p><p>And as the others start to arrive, I settle back to read.</p><p>CHAPTER 17</p> <p>Here I am in the cockpit with March again.</p><p>I\u2019ve hardly seen him in the last week. I get the feeling he\u2019s been avoiding me, but I\u2019m not sure why. The way I figure, I\u2019m the one who should be embarrassed, but I refuse to let it bother me. I didn\u2019t start my life over just to turn into something I\u2019m not. As I\u2019ve never cared what anyone thought of me, I\u2019m certainly not starting with March.</p><p>He watches me settled into the nav chair beside him. We\u2019re cruising, already a good distance from Lachion. I took my time making my way up here; in fact I made him summon me, something I can tell pissed him off. I check the port, even though I know it\u2019s clean. Stalling, because I have a fist squeezing my intestines, sweat popping out on my upper lip, and a snail of discomfort crawling down my spine. It doesn\u2019t get easier; we just don\u2019t have people shooting to distract me.</p><p>Kai started every flight perfectly. He\u2019d lean over, a lock of ash blond hair flopping into his eyes, and he\u2019d give me the tender, sheepish smile I came to love. Saying, \u201cFor luck,\u201d he would brush his lips against mine. But I never felt like I needed luck with Kai. He was my luck. We were golden; nothing could touch us. I wish I could remember what the frag happened on Matins IV, whether I killed him\u2014</p><p>\u201cSteady,\u201d March says, resting a hand on my forearm.</p><p>I recoil reflexively. The warmth of his touch lingers, but I don\u2019t want him to comfort me, if that\u2019s his intent. He has no right, and he shouldn\u2019t know the things he does. I didn\u2019t confide in him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I bite out.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s gone,\u201d he growls. \u201cNot coming back, Jax. And I\u2019m all you\u2019ve got.\u201d</p><p>His words make me gulp twice in sharp succession, suddenly light-headed. Much as I don\u2019t like March, I respect him\u2014or I did. For a long moment, I gaze at him, jaw clenched. You think I don\u2019t know that? You think I\u2019m ever able to forget that? Heat suffuses my cheeks, and I feel myself trembling on the verge of something extreme, like I might cry. Or kill him.</p><p>I know which I prefer.</p><p>\u201cTell the crew to strap in,\u201d I say, my eyes on his. \u201cYou speak to me like that again, I jump us all the way past the Polaris system. And if you don\u2019t think I\u2019ll flatline everyone on board, take another look at the wreckage of the Sargasso from Matins IV.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou talk tough, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what?\u201d I\u2019m out of the nav chair and in his face. \u201cTake a closer \u2018look,\u2019 asshole. Am. I. Bluffing?\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t want to. But I know the moment he does because his face goes queer and ashen. \u201cYou\u2019re saying you did that on purpose...?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head savagely and drop back into my seat. \u201cBut this time, I\u2019ve got nothing left to lose except my life. You keep pushing me, and I\u2019m not going to give a shit about that, either. I don\u2019t care if you think it\u2019s pathetic that I\u201d\u2014my voice breaks, but I\u2019m not going to let these tears fall in front of March\u2014\u201cmiss him. Keep your opinions to yourself, understood?\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t add: You\u2019re not even worthy to say his name. But it\u2019s there between us. He knows. To my surprise, he\u2019s the first to break eye contact.</p><p>\u201cJust do your job,\u201d he mutters. \u201cSometime today would be good.\u201d</p><p>Without another word, I take a look at the star charts. Marakeq would take months to reach if we didn\u2019t have a jumper on board, so it\u2019s not as far as it could be. The information I salvaged from Mair\u2019s research advises me that it\u2019s primarily a swamp world with isolated pockets of civilization, and the dominant life-form appears to be amphibian intelligence. We\u2019re further handicapped by the fact that the planet is both class P and nonhuman. Nothing like setting the bar high, right?</p><p>As I plug in, I hear March telling the crew to prepare for jump. I\u2019m blind again, waiting for him. Hating him. Then I\u2019m crowded full of him as the phase drive starts powering up. Before his walls come up, separating us as efficiently as a room partition, something I never had with Kai, I glimpse something.</p><p>Something I\u2019m not supposed to see. And it changes everything.</p><p>But I don\u2019t have time to reflect; the ship trembles beneath me, and I need to focus on getting us to the beacon intact. So I push the new awareness to the back of my mind and ready myself for grimspace. Oh, it feels good, a rush I almost forget each time I leave it behind. But Mary, the colors\u2014I\u2019m aware of the cadence, the cosmic tides, and the sequence of vibrations that tell me inarguably: That way. And March responds to my directives as an extension of me. His hands are mine, sure and confident, guiding us through the primordial soup. Even as I hate him, I wish I could show him what it\u2019s like\u2014</p><p>You already are.</p><p>I\u2019m not sure what that means, and I want to challenge the barriers he\u2019s put up to find out, but I can\u2019t divert myself from navigation. If I let my concentration slip, there\u2019s no telling where we\u2019ll end up. So I keep monitoring the wildfire outside the ship; everything seems so small, and our hull looks like it should ignite plowing through the ether, but the colors don\u2019t touch us.</p><p>Now and then I see shimmers, reflections of others, maybe traveling parallel, maybe time trails. Grimspace ghosts. Sometimes I wonder if I\u2019ll ever see shadows of myself, the echo left by my own passage on another vessel. That\u2019s a paradox the Corp didn\u2019t encourage us to contemplate, and right now, I understand why.</p><p>We\u2019re here.</p><p>I sense his assent, and the ship shudders, making the jump back to straight space. I don\u2019t need to see the astrogation charts to know we hit the mark, but before I can savor the pleasure of a solid run, the phase drive whines in powering down. I\u2019ve heard that sound before, and its feedback screams inside my skull. Hope to Mary we don\u2019t need to leave in a hurry. The frog-folk aren\u2019t likely to give us any trouble in orbit, but if gray men or others track us down, it could get real messy without a phase drive.</p><p>Sighing, I tug the plug out of my wrist, and there\u2019s a moment of vertigo as I accustom myself to seeing with my eyes again. Everything flickers before coming into focus, and sometimes I wonder whether I\u2019m real at all, maybe I\u2019m a program someone\u2019s coding for an interactive holo. The absurdity of the thought makes me smile\u2014who the hell would want to pretend to be me?</p><p>March taps the comm panel. \u201cDina, I need you to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlready on it,\u201d comes her waspish reply. \u201cWhat am I, stupid? That\u2019s a rhetorical question by the way. I\u2019ll let you know when I figure out what\u2019s wrong.\u201d</p><p>Unlike last time, I don\u2019t head out of the cockpit right away. Instead, I shift in my seat, watching him fiddle with the controls. I know he doesn\u2019t need to be so proactive, adjusting this and that once he\u2019s input our cruising course. All he needs to do for the next several hours is monitor our progress. I smile as I realize that means he\u2019s nervous. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI know what you did,\u201d I tell him. \u201cAnd why.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo idea what you\u2019re on about, why don\u2019t you be a good girl and get me a drink?\u201d</p><p>Oh, he\u2019s trying to distract me now by pissing me off again, but it won\u2019t work. \u201cYou can\u2019t bullshit me, March. I saw.\u201d</p><p>He turns his head to face me then, and I see a surprisingly vulnerable slant to his mouth. \u201cYou were upset,\u201d he mutters. \u201cI just didn\u2019t want you killing us.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo you made yourself a target. Better that I\u2019m mad at you, hating you, than hurting, is that it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly,\u201d he answers, too quietly.</p><p>Perversely I feel like that\u2019s just about the sweetest thing anyone\u2019s ever done for me, and yeah, I know how that sounds. But I\u2019m...not right. I wasn\u2019t, before Kai, and now, even less so. But regardless, it touches me that he chose to piss me off.</p><p>Exhaling, I say, \u201cDon\u2019t do that again, March. Please. I appreciate the concern, I do, but...I\u2019ll never get over it if I don\u2019t deal with it. And if I\u2019m going to hate you, I want it to be real, not over mind games. I know you\u2019re good at them, better than me, but I really don\u2019t want to play.\u201d</p><p>He narrows his dark eyes on me. \u201cI\u2019ll do whatever\u2019s necessary to protect this ship and my crew. I\u2019m not making you any promises, Jax. I\u2019m still not convinced you aren\u2019t a liability, not convinced we shouldn\u2019t have waited for someone more stable, even if that meant it took substantially longer.\u201d</p> <p>That hurts, and it\u2019s meant to, but I don\u2019t flinch. Because even though he\u2019s doing his damnedest to play the hard-ass, make me think he doesn\u2019t give a shit about me, I know that\u2019s wrong. I saw. I felt. Just enough to make me wonder what else was there, before he slammed the door so hard it convinced me he has something to hide.</p><p>And I\u2019m going to find out what.</p><p>CHAPTER 18</p><p>As usual, we\u2019re in the middle of an argument.</p><p>However, I am just an observer in this particular squabble, sitting in the hub with my ankle propped on my knee. Dina beetles her brows, and she\u2019s up in March\u2019s face, doing everything but shaking a fist. I don\u2019t think she\u2019d bother, though. If she intended to hit him, she wouldn\u2019t give warning; she\u2019d let her knuckles do the talking. In the time we\u2019ve traveled together, I\u2019ve learned some respect for the woman.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m telling you, we need to take the ship down,\u201d Dina says heatedly. \u201cIf you four launch in the pod, then I\u2019m fragged if they track us down before you get back. And what if I need to do some work outside the ship? You going to leave me up here doing the walk without backup? Plus, I can\u2019t shut down certain systems while in synchronous orbit. They\u2019ll find it easier to locate us.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe has a point.\u201d Everyone glances at Doc, who shrugs. \u201cI understand you\u2019re worried about the ship being damaged on the planet, but if something happens up here, we\u2019re no better off, and we\u2019ll have lost Dina.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd nobody wants that.\u201d I don\u2019t mean to sound quite so acerbic, but Dina just grins. To her, that probably felt like an endearment, and I can\u2019t help grinning back.</p><p>Dina backs off, now that she has popular support. \u201cTake us down then. Find a landing spot, ideally a clearing with some cover.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything else, your majesty?\u201d March sketches a bow that would do credit to someone meeting real royalty.</p><p>\u201cFrag you,\u201d she returns without heat. \u201cMy family was deposed fifteen years ago.\u201d</p><p>My brows arch as March returns to the cockpit, but Dina\u2019s already turning away to get back to work on the phase drive. That leaves me glancing at Doc for clarification, and he shakes his head before heading to medical. Finally, I turn to Loras, who sighs.</p><p>\u201cI believe Dina comes from the Imperial family on Tarnus, or rather, what used to be the Imperial family. There was a populist movement on her world, perhaps twenty turns ago, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt ended in a bloody coup?\u201d I guess.</p> <p>Not that I don\u2019t want to hear the two-hour lecture that Loras would have volunteered on Tarnian history, but well, I don\u2019t know shit about the universe, and I don\u2019t want to know. The only thing I\u2019m good at is grimspace, and it\u2019ll eventually kill me.</p><p>\u201cThat is an oversimplification,\u201d Loras observes with a sliver of disapproval, \u201cbut essentially correct. I believe Dina had been exiled in disfavor for...consorting with her handmaidens and taking an unseemly interest in alien technology, so she was not in the capital at the time.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t resist the urge to tease him. \u201cConsorting, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust you to fixate on the prurient and miss the trauma she survived.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrauma?\u201d Even as I repeat the word, I know I\u2019ve been a moron.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s the only survivor from the royal family, and they only permitted her off planet for two reasons: her predilection for her own sex and her promise she will never return.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer promise?\u201d That doesn\u2019t seem like much of a warranty, even relying on some antiquated code of honor, not that I think Dina would abide by such a thing. I\u2019m parroting shit like I\u2019m brainless, but I guess I just never imagined there was anything more to her than met the eye.</p><p>\u201cIf she sets foot on the surface of Tarnus, the chip in her head will discharge,\u201d he tells me dispassionately. \u201cAny attempt to remove it will also result in detonation. They made sure she will keep her word.\u201d</p><p>And though I\u2019ve heard some horrific things in my day, I can\u2019t help but shudder. Instinctively I know that the implant contains some ritualistic element, probably designed to shame her. I can\u2019t quite reconcile this with the tough ship\u2019s mechanic, but I know he\u2019s telling me the truth, or...most of it.</p><p>\u201cWhat aren\u2019t you saying?\u201d</p><p>Loras shakes his head with a faint half smile. \u201cThere\u2019s a lesson in that, Jax. Nobody here is what he or she seems.\u201d</p><p>Before I can ask, the ship bucks, and March\u2019s voice sounds over the comm: \u201cEveryone strap in, it\u2019s going to get a little rough.\u201d</p><p>For once I do exactly what he says without finding him to argue about it. A few minutes later I\u2019m glad I did because the ship\u2019s shaking, and I can feel us wallowing back and forth as we enter the atmosphere. Loras murmurs that we\u2019re hitting thermal pockets, and I can\u2019t tell from his expression how bad that is. March is probably struggling to keep the nose up, increase drag, trying not to liquefy our hull.</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t use autopilot much, does he?\u201d</p><p>Loras glances up from the console and seems to decide it\u2019s time he strapped in as well. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he answers. \u201cWe haven\u2019t flown with him any more than you have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>I feel like a shit for forgetting the poor bastard who died on Perlas Station. Before we can say anything more, we pitch sharply, and only the harness keeps me from being flung against the far wall. As it is, I\u2019m going to have an impressive web of bruises all over my throat and shoulders. I feel my stomach surge into my throat because this reminds me of\u2014</p><p>No. Oh no. This is like dream therapy, all over again.</p><p>My fault...why did they think it might be my fault? I got us to Matins IV, didn\u2019t I? I didn\u2019t hurt Kai. I wouldn\u2019t have. But what...? I can\u2019t remember; there\u2019s a red haze around everything. It hurts, and I feel like\u2014</p><p>We hit hard, and I feel the ship careening. Screaming metal, something tears loose. When there\u2019s a hangar or a port, you can expect a certain amount of help\u2014a computer beaming ideal trajectory, cooperative deployment of thrusters. Here, it\u2019s just March and his best judgment. I\u2019m holding a scream inside my head, and my throat seems swollen shut. I see nothing but the dark, spreading across my field of vision like a plague.</p><p>She\u2019s screaming. I hear screaming. I\u2019m pinned. Both my arms feel like they\u2019ve been torn off, but I can hear her screaming. I have to help her, Mary give me strength, help me move this. Hurts. I\u2019ll crawl. No. No. Too late\u2014I can smell the\u2014</p><p>There\u2019s no burning meat, Jax. You\u2019re safe. Everyone\u2019s all right.</p><p>This is the first time I\u2019ve heard him when we weren\u2019t jacked in. But suddenly my head\u2019s full of him, and I don\u2019t know where I am. But I can feel my arms, and I\u2019m whole, just like he\u2019s promising. I become aware of someone crying\u2014rough wracking sobs.</p><p>Oh Mary, it\u2019s me.</p><p>It\u2019s going to be a while before I can speak, and I don\u2019t even want to think of opening my eyes because the crew is probably watching me with the horrified fascination usually reserved for the interstellar freak show. But I sense the negative even before I process his response. They\u2019re checking out the Folly. We took some damage coming in.</p><p>Considering my meltdown, that seems like quite the understatement. Now I can feel his hands on my back, stroking, soothing. Guess he was right; I\u2019m nowhere near stable and probably a liability to the mission. Shit, I can\u2019t even handle a rough landing.</p><p>You\u2019re one of the strongest people I\u2019ve ever met. That shocks me out of my self-pity. I wonder why he\u2019s saying that, and as if I\u2019d asked the question, he goes on: I could hear you screaming all the way up in the cockpit. And the second I touched you...Jax, I saw it all.</p><p>Shit. I did that? Gave him the charnel house from Matins IV to bear along with everything else? Mother Mary, is there no limit to the pain I\u2019ll inflict?</p><p>He gives me a little shake, and I open my eyes. We\u2019re still in the hub, but he\u2019s got me on his lap by the console. There\u2019s nobody else around right now, as he said. I\u2019m starting to realize that March\u2019s word is gold. He might be a lot of things, but the man doesn\u2019t lie as far as I can tell.</p><p>\u201cWas I screaming?\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t remember. My throat isn\u2019t sore, although the rest of me is.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Doc says from the doorway. \u201cAt least not so the rest of us could hear.\u201d I register March\u2019s surprise, but Saul continues, regarding us with an inscrutable expression. \u201cHe came from the cockpit at a dead run, yanked you up out of your seat. What happened, Jax?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPsychotic break.\u201d I feel like I\u2019m signing away my personal liberty by admitting as much, like maybe the Corp had a point in keeping me confined.</p><p>But Doc just nods, looking thoughtful. \u201cLet\u2019s get you to medical.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s only then I realize that I\u2019m still sitting on March\u2019s lap, and his arms fall away from me with the slow, swimming reluctance of a mudsider learning to move in zero G. And I say quietly in the confines of my own head: Thank you. Not expecting to be heard. To my surprise, as I fold to my feet to follow Saul, I receive a very soft response that maybe I am not meant to hear.</p><p>I will always come for you, Jax.</p><p>CHAPTER 19</p><p>Ten minutes pass in silence.</p><p>Doc\u2019s bedside manner is a little disturbing, but then he\u2019s a geneticist more than an actual physician. I need to remember that. Finally, he concludes his battery of tests and regards me with an expression I can only describe as bemused. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou have some unusual activity in the temporal lobe, both within the amygdala and the auditory cortex.

I have some...bad memories.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I expect you would,\u201d he returns mildly. To my surprise he doesn\u2019t display the same kind of morbid curiosity as the Unit Psych. \u201cSeems a hard landing acts as a trigger. Do you know of any other events that might set off a similar reaction?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cThought I was anesthetized to it, after they made me revisit it so often on Perlas.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey did what?\u201d</p><p>Frowning, I explain what my confinement was like, and by the time I\u2019m finished, well, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen Doc look so outraged. He asks me a series of questions regarding the frequency and timing of my treatments. \u201cBarbarians,\u201d he mutters. \u201cWish I\u2019d known this earlier. It explains a few things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>He pauses. \u201cI can\u2019t be sure without further testing, and I\u2019m not certain I want to subject you to it, but...Jax, I think they may have used subliminal suggestion in your dream therapy to guarantee your eventual breakdown.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn case the Psychs and solitary weren\u2019t enough?\u201d The bitterness in my own voice surprises me, and what\u2019s more astounding, I don\u2019t doubt it\u2019s possible. But there\u2019s a more pressing question on my mind now.</p> <p>Doc regards me solemnly. \u201cI think it\u2019s critical we figure out what happened on Matins IV. They think you know something\u2014and perhaps you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t they just kill me?\u201d It\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve asked that aloud.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, my dear. But I suspect it\u2019s vital we discover that as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you don\u2019t think I\u2019m crazy...or dangerous?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo more than anyone else,\u201d he answers kindly, \u201cunder the right circumstances.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t know why, but that placates my fear better than anything else he could have said. Humans are capable of horrific acts, but the aftermath of Matins IV left me feeling like I deserve a special spot among monsters. And I don\u2019t even know why. Examined intellectually, the feeling doesn\u2019t make sense. I know we made the jump; we arrived intact and something...happened as Kai tried to put us down on planet. I just can\u2019t remember what. But how could that be my fault?</p> <p>My gaze wanders around the sterile medical exam room, white and gleaming synth. Saul\u2019s instruments align with mathematical precision, revealing a great deal about his character. I hop down from the table and decline his offer of a sedative.</p><p>\u201cNo thanks. It won\u2019t accomplish anything if I sack out in quarters. Once I start asking to forget, well...\u201d I smile wryly. \u201cI might as well have stayed on Perlas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t imagine you ever take the easy road,\u201d he observes, putting away the scanner he used to check my amygdala, whatever that is. \u201cThat\u2019s what March can\u2019t resist, you know. That grit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe acts like he can hardly stand me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are reasons.\u201d Before I can frame the question, Doc shakes his head. \u201cOh no, I\u2019ve said too much already. Get out of my med bay, you\u2019re fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not. But I think maybe...I will be.\u201d</p><p>Saul gives me a knowing half smile as I turn down the hall, heading back to the hub. I can hear Dina swearing from somewhere else within the ship, and Loras seems to be analyzing a status report at the comm terminal. Well, things can\u2019t be too bad if we\u2019ve got systems online, right? He ignores me, a fact I find comforting. It\u2019d be so much worse if he behaved solicitously.</p><p>I still feel somewhat shaken, but I\u2019ve got a little distance from it. Time to compartmentalize, push it back and pretend the woman who broke down belongs to someone else, another Jax. So I square my shoulders and go in search of March.</p> <p>When I find him, he\u2019s in the cockpit, but what bothers me is...he\u2019s doing nothing. Just slumped in the pilot\u2019s chair, gazing at a panel whose numbers mean nothing to me. A cold chill crawls down my spine as I realize I\u2019ve never seen that look in his eyes: a veritable wasteland, bleak and grim. In anyone else I\u2019d call the expression despair, but I can\u2019t reconcile that to what I know of him.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d intended to demand to know our plan of action, status of repairs, how long we might be grounded, and when we\u2019re heading out to meet the natives. But his eyes knock all that right off my agenda. Now I just need to know why he looks like this.</p><p>\u201cBetter question is what\u2019s right? It\u2019d take less time to answer.\u201d He manages a shadow of his usual saturnine smile, but I\u2019m not buying it.</p><p>\u201cSeriously, don\u2019t bullshit me.\u201d</p><p>Sighing, he sits forward in the pilot chair, tapping a figure on the display panel with an index finger. \u201cThat\u2019s population. Something bad happened here, Jax. There\u2019s nothing left alive above five kilos.\u201d</p><p>For a minute I can\u2019t even process that. The amphibians we came to visit beneath Corp radar, the genetics we intended to tap...gone? Figuring out what happened, that will be work for anthropologists down the line.</p><p>\u201cHow is that even possible?\u201d I can\u2019t begin to guess.</p><p>March shakes his head. \u201cI don\u2019t fragging know. The Mareq were tribal, barely even aware that there were other settlements within reasonable walking distance: different traditions, different dialects. Don\u2019t know how a plague could spread, given they had almost no contact with each other. And they were a peaceful race, as far as our records indicate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think someone did this on purpose.\u201d It\u2019s not a question, and I know damn well that\u2019s what put this look in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cNothing else makes sense,\u201d he says, too quietly.</p><p>I think about that for a moment, and I\u2019m surprised to see my hand hovering a few millimeters from his shoulder. Is that what I want? To comfort March? Perhaps I give myself too much credit, believing I might have the power.</p><p>It\u2019s been over a standard month since I touched anyone else of my own volition. The last time, I was with Kai, preparing for our jump to Matins IV. Hovering there, my fingers look thin and spidery, blue veins too prominent across the back, a map of bad choices. Maybe those arteries writhe with some poison that contaminates everything I touch. So I drop my hand, and for once he doesn\u2019t notice, still staring at the panel.</p><p>There\u2019s something I have to ask, and a few months back, the question would never have occurred to me. But now I\u2019m born again in speculation and paranoia. My skin crawls with it, and my mind fosters suspicion like a beloved child.</p><p>\u201cDid Zelaco have access to Mair\u2019s research?\u201d</p><p>March\u2019s head jerks up. \u201cPossibly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s assume he did,\u201d I say, carefully neutral. \u201cWould it be within his character to provide some intelligence to the Corp for the right price?\u201d</p><p>He sucks in a slow breath, both hands fisting on his knees. \u201cAbsolutely. He wouldn\u2019t have revealed our base of operations; he wouldn\u2019t have risked them striking at Lachion while he was on planet. But if he calculated our risk of failure greater than our chance at success, he certainly would\u2019ve padded his take by selling you to the Gunnars and added another slice by offering what he knew of our agenda to the Corp.\u201d</p><p>I feel numb.</p><p>\u201cSo we\u2019re looking at ten dead worlds, potentially. If you can\u2019t cull the competition, destroy their resources. March, what if they took samples? What if they know about Doc\u2019s cross-germination idea?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoubt Zelaco knew the science of it. Doc\u2019s been very tight with that.\u201d But he doesn\u2019t sound hopeful.</p><p>In fact, he looks almost totally defeated, and I realize he\u2019s paying me a compliment, letting me see him like this. Maybe it\u2019s quid pro quo. He\u2019s seen me at my worst, so he can offer it back. Whatever the reason, I won\u2019t snipe at him, not now.</p><p>\u201cAre we still going to look around on planet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMight as well,\u201d he answers. \u201cDina\u2019s going to be a couple of days getting us flightworthy. We took some hull damage coming in, and the phase drive\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBroke down conveniently,\u201d I finish. \u201cZelaco, or more to the point, someone he hired had access to the Folly while we were en route to the compound?\u201d When he nods, I add, \u201cAt this point, I think we can assume there are gray men headed for our location.\u201d</p><p>March offers a tight smile. \u201cThere\u2019s a bright spot, at least.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr it\u2019s possible we\u2019re sharing a paranoid delusion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOccam\u2019s razor,\u201d he murmurs, shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust someone who lived a long time ago and died in obscurity. We need to move unless we want to become anecdotal footnotes ourselves.\u201d</p><p>Reality as I know it is no more because I\u2019m in complete agreement with March.</p><p>CHAPTER 20</p><p>It\u2019s hard to imagine this planet holding the key to anything.</p><p>Through the view screen, I see the soil bubbling with algae as the rain pours down. Everything is green, but it\u2019s unwholesome, dripping and dank. The atmosphere is borderline breathable, but we need filters to scrub out chemicals that might burn our lungs. I make no protest when Saul plugs my nostrils; that\u2019s not the way I want to die.</p><p>Most of the time, I imagine myself passing while I\u2019m jacked in, taking my last look at grimspace. Sometimes, mainly when I\u2019m drunk, I see myself as an old woman, keeling over while eating smooth sweet slices of kavi and ogling handsome waiters. That death wouldn\u2019t be hard to arrange, particularly on Venice Minor. In fact, I could probably pay someone to see to it.</p><p>\u201cYou think about that too much,\u201d March tells me, as we\u2019re checking our gear.</p><p>\u201cEveryone needs a hobby.\u201d</p><p>With a look he informs me that I\u2019m unspeakably macabre, but I just shrug. Ship sensors indicate there\u2019s a settlement about four kilometers away, so we\u2019re going for a hike. The Folly doesn\u2019t have anything like a land vehicle, just the shuttle, which won\u2019t clear the jammed bay doors, courtesy of our crash landing. We could sit around waiting for Dina to get that fixed, but neither March nor I qualify as patient. Besides, we\u2019ve already ascertained there\u2019s nothing big left out there.</p><p>What could possibly go wrong?</p><p>Loras takes one look outside and declines to set foot on planet; he doesn\u2019t bother with an excuse while Doc states gravely that if there are no living Mareq, he will only get in the way. Dina presents the best case for staying behind, as the ship needs repairs.</p><p>For a moment, I feel as if they\u2019re throwing us together on purpose, as we\u2019ll probably spend the night at the settlement. Even if there\u2019s nothing dangerous left mudside, we could still fall down a hole or get sucked into the swamp. Whatever March says, I\u2019m not walking back in the dark.</p><p>But I don\u2019t notice any significant glances, no conspiratorial grins, so I don\u2019t think it\u2019s matchmaking. Seems more like they just don\u2019t want to wander around this shit hole, and as I step off the loading ramp, I can\u2019t blame them. I sink two centimeters into the mud, and the stink of putrid vegetation almost overwhelms me, even through the filters. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOur own slice of heaven, huh, Jax?\u201d</p><p>As the rain plasters my hair to my head, I sigh and shoulder my pack. \u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>Guess this might have been paradise for the amphibians. Part of me aches, like this is my fault, like I\u2019m the butterfly whose wings create hurricanes. I try to push it back. But it\u2019s hard to escape the feeling that my life has become a curse, a thread that ought to have been snipped at Matins IV, and that I\u2019m only going to keep causing pain until I have the good sense to die. But even if that\u2019s the case, I\u2019m just not selfless enough to fix it.</p><p>He fiddles with a handheld nav device, getting a fix on our location as opposed to the settlement. I\u2019m almost surprised not to be chided for my thoughts, but then he can\u2019t live inside my head, can he? I suppose I\u2019ve gotten used to the idea that he might, that he\u2019s privy to everything about me.</p> <p>Realizing he doesn\u2019t and he isn\u2019t, now...I feel lonely.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go. Sooner we get moving, sooner we get there. See if we can make sense of what happened here.\u201d</p><p>Nodding, I fall in behind March, not because I acknowledge his authority in any fashion but because if by some chance we were wrong, and there\u2019s something big and ugly left in these wetlands, I really prefer it eats him first. Give me a chance to run.</p><p>\u201cNice,\u201d he says, sparing a glance over his shoulder. \u201cReally nice.\u201d</p><p>Oh sure, that he hears.</p> <p>For the first time it occurs to me, as we\u2019re walking, maybe it\u2019s not entirely March. Maybe it\u2019s something I\u2019m doing, something I didn\u2019t even know I could do. I think back over the times where he\u2019s tuned to my frequency, and it\u2019s often when I was thinking something I knew would needle him. This last time, I heard him back, without effort, without equipment. What that means, exactly, I have no idea.</p><p>\u201cIt means our theta waves are compatible,\u201d he answers, surprising me. \u201cIt\u2019s almost always a one-way feed. I get impressions from other people, what kind and how deep depends on how disciplined their minds are and how much I want to know. Used to be uncontrollable, couldn\u2019t shut it off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMair. She wouldn\u2019t teach me the higher forms, but she saw what a mess I was and taught me how to quiet my mind. Shut out the noise through meditation.\u201d</p><p>Well, that explains a hell of a lot. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>His next words come out strained. \u201cBefore she took me in hand, I wasn\u2019t even human, Jax. You have no idea how many people I\u2019ve ended. Broke minds to set an example, for the hell of it, or just because I needed a quiet kill. I spent years on Nicuan, feeding their endless wars. By the time I stole a ship because they shorted my pay, there was nothing left. Mair rebuilt me, brick by brick.\u201d</p> <p>A chill shivers through me, more than the icy rain coursing down my neck. I\u2019ve seen echoes of that darkness in his eyes sometimes, a soulless echo he keeps in check. Am I safe out here with him?</p><p>\u201cWho else have I taken from you?\u201d I probably wouldn\u2019t have the nerve to ask if I could see his face. But looking at his broad back in the battered flight jacket, I can just manage it. \u201cI know about Edaine. And Mair. I didn\u2019t realize she was your mentor...that only makes it worse. But there\u2019s someone else, isn\u2019t there?\u201d</p><p>And it\u2019s part of what he\u2019s been trying to hide from me, each time we jack in. Part of the reason he wants to hate me. I know her name. Svet. Dina said it weeks ago. But who was she to him?</p><p>I hold my breath as we walk, ducking beneath low-hanging vines and ferny fronds that clutch at my clothes as we pass by. The sounds seem louder around us, insects buzzing and chirping, a small symphony fusing with the slurp of ooze around our shoes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not having this conversation with you, Jax. Not now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Second time he\u2019s given me that answer, almost verbatim.</p><p>At that, he turns to face me. \u201cBecause we\u2019re in the middle of nowhere,\u201d he tells me deliberately. \u201cThere\u2019s nobody to see, nothing to stop me but my conscience. And I\u2019ve only recently decided you don\u2019t deserve killing.\u201d</p><p>My breath rushes out of me in a sound that can\u2019t rightly be called a sigh. It\u2019s more of a whimper, and I\u2019m embarrassed because I sound like a wounded animal. I don\u2019t know what I thought...that his animosity had become at least partially feigned? That I\u2019d proven myself somehow. I guess I thought because he spirited me away from the brain butchers on Perlas that I could, to some degree, count on him for protection.</p> <p>But as it turns out, March is the chief advocate of wanting me dead.</p><p>And what better way to accomplish that than to lead me, trusting as a sacrificial goat, out into the wilderness? No wonder nobody volunteered to come with us. Was there ever anything on this planet? And why wouldn\u2019t he have detected the anomaly in life signs from orbit? I remember Keri giving me the PA; she knew the codes. Maybe she planted all the data about Marakeq. Maybe they realize I don\u2019t know anything, nothing but grimspace, and I\u2019ve been played.</p><p>Maybe March doesn\u2019t give a shit about the grand scheme. I give him points for the thespian performance in the cockpit. I bought into it with all my credits. Believed he was suffering over the fate of these poor bog-runners. I\u2019m so stupid. I should have known there was a reason for his sudden shift, why he came running to help me.</p><p>His assurance, I\u2019ll always come for you, Jax, takes on sinister tones.</p><p>There probably isn\u2019t a grand scheme any longer, and all their hope of an academy died with Mair. Maybe this is their way of righting the wrong on Matins IV. I thought it myself; I shouldn\u2019t have survived where so many other, worthier people died.</p><p>Wonder how far we are from the ship and whether they\u2019d act against me if I came back alone. Do they know? I can\u2019t believe Doc and Loras do. Saul has been the essence of kindness from the beginning, and Loras, oh shit, Loras will die without me. Those two can\u2019t possibly be involved.</p><p>Does he plan to return without me? Report a tragic accident and move out? The Corp would probably stop hunting them with confirmation of my death. Neat and tidy, isn\u2019t it, March? And then you can wait for someone stable, just like you said.</p><p>Clean slate.</p><p>My face feels like it\u2019s blazing with heat, and I see clearly for the first time, every detail down to the rain trickling down his brown face. I back up a pace, then two, fumbling in my pack for anything like a weapon. Come up empty-handed. I\u2019m not scared so much as angry, mostly at myself for being so fragging gullible, and if he takes a single step toward me, I\u2019m going to kill him with my bare hands or die trying.</p><p>I know which I prefer.</p><p>CHAPTER 21</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t be serious.\u201d</p><p>But he doesn\u2019t make a move, so I think he knows perfectly well that the time for bullshit is done. He fooled me once, shame on him, but I\u2019m not falling for it again. Instead, I\u2019m gauging the distance, trying to calculate an approach where I can prevail against his sheer physical strength.</p><p>I have to be honest with myself, though. The odds don\u2019t look good. I probably have a better shot running away from him, and I possess too much self-preservation to cavil. Survival is survival, and he\u2019s just said he wants me dead. So I feint left and dive right, but before I can tumble past him and hit the ground running, he catches me around the waist, easily, as if I were a recalcitrant child trying to avoid chores.</p><p>\u201cJax.\u201d He pitches his voice soft, soothing. \u201cYou\u2019re losing it again. Maybe not a full break, but you\u2019re not rational. If I intended to hurt you, why announce it?\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t respond except to struggle with fists and feet, my heart pounding in my chest fit to explode. It\u2019s something else now, and I\u2019m trapped. He\u2019s a wall as I pummel him, managing to do nothing but bounce off him like he\u2019s the ultimate immovable object. And he doesn\u2019t react except to leave his arm around my waist, keeping me from falling, even when I collapse.</p><p>Because he\u2019s right\u2014I\u2019m fragging insane. I hate feeling like this. For the first time since I left Perlas, the tears come, and I can\u2019t stop them, sobbing as the rains wash over us, heavier now. As if from beneath a blanket, I hear the rumble of thunder in the distance.</p><p>Afterward, the only reason I can look him in the eyes is because he doesn\u2019t comfort me. He doesn\u2019t murmur soft words or stroke my back; he just keeps me upright, out of the mud, and the moment it seems like I can stand on my own, he lets me go.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d I say, low. \u201cDon\u2019t know if it was the crash or something the Corp did to me afterward, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up and let\u2019s go,\u201d he says brusquely.</p><p>For some reason, that makes me smile, but he doesn\u2019t wait around for my reaction. I\u2019m left staring at his back as he heads down what passes for a trail, a clearish patch between the trunks of bloated trees. Oddly, I feel lighter. I have no idea what my Unit Psychs did to me, but I think my head\u2019s a minefield strewn with triggers, and maybe if I survive each explosion, what emerges from the wreckage will be me, really, truly me.</p><p>At that he spins, spearing me with a look. There\u2019s such heat in his eyes, never seen this expression, not from anyone. It\u2019s not desire, but something deeper, darker. Instinctively I fall back a step.</p><p>\u201cNot \u2018if,\u2019\u201d he growls. \u201cI\u2019m tired of catching glimpses where you\u2019re thinking about dying. Yeah, before we met, I wanted you dead, not because I felt sure you were to blame for Matins IV. Because you walked away. But get it through your head, Jax. I will never let anything happen to you, not now. You\u2019re one of mine, whether I like it or not.\u201d</p><p>My legs won\u2019t hold me. Or maybe my feet are simply swept out from under me by the wash running between gnarled roots. I wind up on my knees in the mud, face upturned, not to him, but for the rain, almost praying to be made clean. The fabric of our coveralls is supposed to be waterproof, but nothing can withstand the saturation found on Marakeq in monsoon season. We\u2019re both soaked through, and I feel as though I\u2019ll never be warm again.</p><p>\u201cMarch, please,\u201d I whisper, beneath the sound of the water. I don\u2019t know whether he can even hear me. \u201cYou have to tell me.\u201d</p><p>I gaze up at him, touching him only with my eyes. And I recognize when he accepts the inevitability of this exchange. For the first time I grasp that bending doesn\u2019t necessarily mean weakness. Defiance doesn\u2019t always equate to strength. And before he replies, I know he\u2019s not going to deny me a third time before sundown.</p><p>Raindrops spatter his hard face like tears, and when he reaches for me, I let him draw me up. We stand joined only by our twined fingers, as he answers in a broken voice, a not-March voice, \u201cAll right. All right, Jax. You win.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to win. I just need to understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow much do you remember about the flight before the crash?\u201d His hands tighten on mine, hurting me, but I know he\u2019s not even aware of it.</p><p>I swallow hard around a lump in my throat. \u201cIt was uneventful.\u201d This part is rote; I\u2019ve repeated it so often: to the Psychs, to my CO, in the silence of my own head. \u201cWe were just coming off R&amp;R, so I was well rested. Kai and I intended\u201d\u2014small inner flinch at speaking of him in past tense, yes, he\u2019s really gone\u2014\u201cto pick a mechanic and a medic from the pool and do a routine exploratory. But somebody got sick, a jumper who was supposed to make a passenger run. There were all kinds of diplomats and dignitaries waiting for the jump-flight off station to Matins IV. My CO asked if I\u2019d mind filling in, more R&amp;R to follow, since he knew passenger flights weren\u2019t my favorite.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAsked or ordered?\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cSame thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what went wrong?\u201d</p><p>He squeezes so hard that I have to pull away, rubbing my fingers to bring back the circulation. Soon I may have bruises, purple fingerprints where he ground skin against bone. There used to be flesh, muscle, but I\u2019ve withered like the crone dolls children make from the husks of sere, out-of-season fruit.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Hurts to say that for what seems like the millionth time. \u201cSafety check went fine, the flight itself...nothing out of the ordinary when you consider we had seventy-five souls on board and only eight crew, most of whom weren\u2019t accustomed to serving on passenger flights.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a big ship then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn X-class professional transport vessel. Kai had only piloted one like that maybe two or three times in his life, apart from academy sims.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he was certified, competent to handle it?\u201d When I nod without hesitation, since Kai was the best damn pilot I ever knew, he asks, \u201cWhat about you?\u201d</p><p>I give him a half smile. \u201cSize doesn\u2019t matter much to a navigator. Interface is everything.\u201d</p> <p>Not until afterward do I realize how suggestive that sounds. To his credit, March stays focused, although I wonder where he\u2019s headed with this. Probably he could\u2019ve accessed my Psych reports to find all this out.</p><p>\u201cSo you made the jump, then it was a straight cruise to Matins IV...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. There was a conference, something to do with...I can\u2019t remember, actually. But I\u2019m sure it\u2019s public record.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me the rest, Jax.\u201d Maybe he doesn\u2019t realize how demanding he sounds.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all. In my head it\u2019s like there\u2019s this big red hole. I remember making our final approach, Kai kissing me for luck and me...\u201d I suck in a sharp breath. Oh Mary, can I truly say this out loud? Yes, I can\u2014quid pro quo. \u201cTeasing him. As he started making adjustments to the controls, being extra careful because it was a strange ship, bigger than he was used to, I asked, \u2018Are you afraid of falling, baby?\u2019\u201d My voice breaks, and I feel tears welling up, salty heat that doesn\u2019t matter in the rain. \u201cAnd he answered, \u2018No, I\u2019m afraid of landing.\u2019 H-he laughed. I smiled. I don\u2019t remember anything after that, March. On Mary\u2019s Sacred Shroud, I don\u2019t. Next thing I know I\u2019m on the ground, pinned. People are...are...\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh,\u201d he whispers without touching me, which is good, because I\u2019d break. \u201cI know all that. Stop now. Stop.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYour turn.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not an idiot. I already know that someone important to him died in the crash. Question is, who? The body count from Matins IV stands at eighty-two, and that planet should have been my grave. I\u2019ll spend the rest of my life carrying scars from wounds that ought to have killed me.</p><p>Should be dead twice over. The facilities on planet weren\u2019t sufficient to handle burns like mine, so they jumped me to Perlas. I\u2019m told I lay there for twelve hours, listening first to screams, then to silence, before the salvage crew arrived. The landing authority figured there was no hurry...nobody could\u2019ve survived.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you, Jax.\u201d He offers a smile laced with wry humor. \u201cOn Mary\u2019s Sacred Shroud, I will. But right now we need to move.\u201d</p><p>I follow the trajectory of his gaze downward and see that we\u2019re sinking into the ultrasoft Mareq soil. Vines stir around us in a way that I can\u2019t help but find disturbing, like the planet\u2019s alive, tentacles of a beast about to feast.</p><p>Shit.</p><p>March pulls me out of the mud with a hard tug, then we sprint deeper into the trees. Hope to Mary he knows where he\u2019s going.</p><p>\u201cMe, too,\u201d he mutters.</p> <p>Huh, wonder why I\u2019m not reassured?</p><p>CHAPTER 22</p><p>We stumble on the settlement by chance.</p><p>My legs ache because we had to run in long, bounding strides to keep from sinking, slip-sliding along in the driving rain. I feel the sting of it on my skin long after the downpour finally abates. And my fingers feel cramped because he never let go of me; I understand why. Getting lost here would be a death sentence.</p><p>The community looks about as I expected.</p><p>But the mud mounds are the best biotecture I\u2019ve ever seen; class P or not, this civilization clearly understood the value of a harmonious habitat. We walk through the deserted arcology and see no signs of struggle, no damage to external environs. Though I don\u2019t know what\u2019s on March\u2019s mind, I\u2019m wondering what the hell happened here.</p><p>If we go inside one of the structures, we\u2019ll need to do it on hands and knees. The openings are more suitable for children, and I recall from my reading that the Mareq seldom reach more than 92cm at full maturity. A chill rushes over me as I realize we may be the only sentient creatures left on planet. I\u2019ve visited dead worlds before, logged the existence of ancient ruins, but that doesn\u2019t possess the same immediacy as knowing you\u2019ve glimpsed the death of a thriving culture.</p><p>As we explore, the sky overhead darkens to slate, and the gauzy star that functions as this world\u2019s sun slips below the horizon. Apparently this is the closest thing to true night Marakeq possesses, a dreamtime twilight where the trees take on fantastic shapes.</p><p>\u201cI thought this run would tell us something,\u201d he says finally. \u201cWhat type of weapon was used, where they went...\u201d Sighing, March taps the communicator to get in touch with the Folly.</p><p>\u201cEverything all right?\u201d Doc\u2019s voice sounds reassuring, even from four klicks out.</p><p>\u201cYes and no,\u201d he answers. \u201cWe got nothing, but we\u2019re safe enough. Going to spend the night and head back to the ship in the morning. March out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s find a place to pitch camp,\u201d I say, tilting my head toward one of the larger structures. \u201cIn there might be good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think? If it was a disease that took them\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are all the bodies?\u201d I shake my head. \u201cPlus a disease that\u2019s fatal to the Mareq probably wouldn\u2019t even translate to our systems. We\u2019re fundamentally different; they\u2019re not even warm-blooded.\u201d</p><p>As we\u2019re crawling inside the mound I indicated, something about what I just said resonates. I stop just inside the low arch, and March butts me with his head. \u201cGet moving, Jax. It\u2019s fragging cold, and it\u2019s starting to rain again.\u201d</p><p>But I\u2019m waiting for my eyes to acclimate to the dim interior. Hoping I\u2019m right. And yeah, there are small bulges all over the earthen floor.</p><p>I laugh softly, delightedly. \u201cThey\u2019re not gone. You said yourself, it\u2019s cold, March. They\u2019re in the ground. Sleeping until it gets warm again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd their heat signatures have equalized to the earth around them. Shit, you\u2019re right. We were sharing a paranoid delusion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPartly at least, and I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever been so happy to be wrong.\u201d I\u2019m beaming at him over my shoulder.</p><p>He smiles back, a real one, not the parody that twists his mouth and never reaches his eyes. \u201cMe, either.\u201d</p><p>Backing out, we make a quick visual inspection inside all the buildings and find most of them are occupied, their residents asleep for the winter. When we find an empty edifice, probably a meeting place, not a home, that\u2019s where we make our last stop, hands and knees muddy beyond belief from all the crawling. Inside the hut, it\u2019s surprisingly inviting, cozy, the sloping walls covered in soft moss.</p><p>\u201cSo what do we do? There\u2019s no guarantee we can wake them, and I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s a good idea, even if we can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst thing we do is warm up,\u201d he answers, digging through his pack. \u201cOr we\u2019re going to die of exposure. Get your blanket, your lips are blue, Jax.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s no way he could tell that. Too dim in here, everything is gray. But I do as I\u2019m told, fish out my supposedly weatherproof bedroll and wrap up. Sometimes it\u2019s stupid to argue. But why am I not surprised to learn that dinner will be squeezed out of a packet? I sigh and suck it down.</p><p>Later, I feel substantially warmer, and I\u2019ve nourished my body, if not satisfied it. March sits across from me, leaning against the wall. His eyes are closed, but he\u2019s not asleep. He might as well hold up a sign that says: I don\u2019t want to talk.</p><p>So I shut my eyes as well, and I\u2019m nearly dozing when he murmurs, \u201cI hate how well you understand me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not exactly inscrutable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe rest of the universe doesn\u2019t agree with you, Jax.\u201d</p><p>At that I grin and open my eyes. \u201cRight, sorry. You\u2019re the soul of masculine mystique. Better?\u201d</p><p>A pale flicker tells me he\u2019s probably smiling. \u201cNot what I meant, but I\u2019ll take it. Have you seen the ship\u2019s official manifest?\u201d</p><p>Talk about non sequiturs.</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cWhy would I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s registered as a privately owned vessel out of Gehenna, full designation\u2014Svetlana\u2019s Folly.\u201d</p><p>Now it makes sense; he\u2019s just no better at segues than I am. \u201cWho was that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy half sister.\u201d He sighs. \u201cLong story, all that matters is...she was among your crew on the Sargasso.\u201d</p><p>I want to show sympathy, but that\u2019ll earn me a rebuff quicker than anything I could say. So I just ask, \u201cShe joined the Corp?\u201d</p><p>I sense more than see his nod. \u201cShe was tired of living hand to mouth. Said I\u2019d one day grasp the value of working for the establishment. I didn\u2019t want her to go, but she wasn\u2019t somebody who listened to advice. When I could finally afford my own ship, I named it to poke at her that I\u2019d made good, right? Without selling my soul to the corporation. We were supposed to meet up after she made the Matins run. Said she had something important to tell me and wouldn\u2019t trust open comm channels.\u201d</p><p>I flinch. March, I\u2019m so sorry. But I don\u2019t say it aloud, and I don\u2019t even know what I\u2019m sorry for, really. Being alive? I don\u2019t recall what happened; I truly don\u2019t. Clearly, the Corp intended it to become my fault; they shaped my treatments so I wouldn\u2019t be mentally competent to deny charges laid against me. Whatever else, that\u2019s one reason they didn\u2019t kill me. A living cat\u2019s-paw serves a number of purposes, PR and otherwise. They probably hoped to get me to the point that I would confess, sobbing and broken. Apologize in tears to the bereaved families; you can\u2019t buy press like that.</p><p>\u201cI understand,\u201d I manage through an aching throat.</p><p>And I do. Much as I\u2019d like to, I can\u2019t blame him for feeling I\u2019m tainted by what happened on Matins IV. I can\u2019t blame him for seeing in me a living reminder of his sister\u2019s death. He probably wishes she was sitting here instead, and no, I can\u2019t blame him for that, either. I wish she was, too. Instead of family, now all he has is a ship bearing a name that probably hurts each time he hears it.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he says quietly. \u201cYou don\u2019t. If I hate you for what happened to Svet, then I\u2019m no better than the Corp, practicing prejudice because it\u2019s convenient. And I\u2019ve spent my whole life fighting against what they represent. I wanted you to be the cocky, care-for-nothing nav-star we saw on the holo. That woman, I could\u2019ve despised. But...you\u2019re not. Maybe you were, I don\u2019t know. But that\u2019s not the woman I see now.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Through the damp fabric of my coverall, bundled in my blanket, I feel naked. Raw. He sees more than I want, more than I can bear. It\u2019s like standing before him on Perlas all over again while he stares at my scars, pitiless and unmoved.</p><p>\u201cWhat now?\u201d My voice sounds husky, and I don\u2019t even know what I\u2019m asking.</p><p>His shoulders surge in what I take to be a shrug. \u201cWe head back to the Folly tomorrow. It\u2019d be wrong to disrupt their life cycle for our agenda. There are nine other planets, so we hope for better luck.\u201d</p><p>See, this is where March differs from the Corp. Both agree the Mareq should be left alone. The Corp, however, take that stance because they believe the Mareq don\u2019t possess anything that would benefit them. Thanks to Saul\u2019s research, March knows better; he just won\u2019t exploit them. I understand why the others look to him\u2014and what I thought before, Doc serving as his conscience, that\u2019s wrong. Because that\u2019s woven so thoroughly throughout his being, it doesn\u2019t register as a separate impulse.</p> <p>\u201cI liked it better when you sat around thinking about huge rocks falling on me,\u201d he mutters. \u201cDon\u2019t romanticize me, Jax.\u201d</p><p>I sputter a laugh. \u201cAre you kidding? Have you seen yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSays the woman who looks like that.\u201d</p><p>I can only imagine the mud-encrusted, matted-hair picture I present. Well, that comment silences me since he\u2019s right, but I smile as I dig the toe of my boot back and forth, making patterns in the soft earth. Then I freeze as I uncover something shimmering-translucent. I don\u2019t think he can see it from across the way, so I lean forward, raking more top soil away to see.</p><p>\u201cMarch,\u201d I whisper reverently. \u201cBe careful in here. We\u2019re in the nursery.\u201d</p> <p>At that, he knee-walks over to examine my find, and I\u2019m surprised to see his face light with a smile. \u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>On my knees in a mud mound with thousands of little Mareq sleeping beneath us, I feel the most astonishing tranquility. We\u2019re surrounded by life, by perpetuity. They have language, customs, and these bog-runners will never have to worry about grimspace or the Corp. Who\u2019s to say they\u2019re not better off?</p><p>\u201cWishing you were Mareq?\u201d he asks, then emits a throaty sound that mimics their speech better than I would\u2019ve credited. He continues to croak, teasing me.</p><p>I don\u2019t mind. The air\u2019s clear between us, at least. Clean slate. But it\u2019s hard to say who looks more astounded when the egg I uncovered trembles and splits to birth a slimy, big-eyed Mareq that latches on to the back of March\u2019s hand.</p><p>Poetic justice.</p><p>Managing not to laugh, I ask, \u201cSo I\u2019ve been meaning to inquire...how d\u2019you feel about fatherhood?\u201d</p> <p>CHAPTER 23</p><p>Doc\u2019s amusement is contagious.</p><p>He\u2019s tapping away at a terminal, educating the new father on nurturing his young. I can\u2019t help but snicker at the picture March presents. Because he couldn\u2019t transport the little guy back to the ship in the cold, he tucked it into his shirt, where it promptly attached to his chest.</p><p>Dina has propped herself against the wall just outside medical, so she can mock him conveniently. \u201cTell me you did this on purpose. This is how we\u2019re getting our DNA sample, yes? Because nobody\u2019s dumb enough wind up like this accidentally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m that dumb.\u201d March glares at her.</p><p>She smirks. \u201cI always secretly suspected.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeave him alone. You weren\u2019t there, were you?\u201d So I\u2019m siding with March? That\u2019s got to be a first.</p><p>\u201cTell me you\u2019ve figured out a fix,\u201d he begs Saul. \u201cCome on, it\u2019s...licking me.\u201d</p> <p>Doc seems fascinated by what he\u2019s reading. \u201cWell...yes. That\u2019s how it survives the first standard month. Apparently the parent that awakened the offspring expels protein-rich mucus through its pores, which the progeny ingests until it is old enough to digest more complex organisms like vegetable matter and insects.\u201d</p><p>Dina\u2019s smirk becomes a grin. \u201cThis just gets better and better. You two smell utterly foul by the way. Just saying.\u201d</p><p>He looks at the small lump beneath his shirt. \u201cYou\u2019re kidding, right?\u201d</p><p>The little Mareq makes a weak sound, and I wince. \u201cWe have to find something it can eat, or we might as well have left it to die in the cold.\u201d</p><p>March sighs, still looking down. \u201cWhy the hell did you wake up early, huh?\u201d</p><p>Loras sits at the other terminal, skimming the minute data files. At that he glances up and says, \u201cApparently it\u2019s your fault. Well, you and Jax together. According to Canton Farr\u2014he\u2019s a Fugitive xenobiologist who studied the Mareq covertly\u2014for a birth, two conditions must be met. First, it is uncovered by the parent that will rear it, and second, that parent declaims what Farr calls the \u2018Coming-Forth\u2019 song.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is your fault,\u201d March says, glaring at me. \u201cYou dug it up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but who sang the Coming-Forth song? That\u2019ll teach you to tease me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPointless bickering!\u201d Doc shakes his head, glancing between us. \u201cI\u2019ll do a biomolecular analysis and synthesize something. March, you\u2019ll want to depilate your chest before applying the nutri-gel first time, and you\u2019ll need to leave it on constantly for the first month, unless you\u2019re bathing. Then someone else will take over, but we\u2019ll want to avoid switching hosts as much as possible. The little one chose you, after all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re shitting me!\u201d March makes two fists, but who\u2019s he going to hit? I\u2019ve never seen him look like this. \u201cI have to keep this thing on me for a month? Can\u2019t you rig something up? A surrogate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are the surrogate,\u201d Loras points out.</p><p>\u201cAs far as I know, no one\u2019s ever raised a Mareq outside its own habitat,\u201d Doc answers, his tone remarkably gentle. \u201cIt\u2019s vital we stick as close as we can to what we know of their natural life cycle.\u201d With that, Saul gets busy, trying to generate something the baby can digest.</p><p>With its protuberant eyes, yellow translucent skin, suction toes, and scrawny useless limbs, it\u2019s actually so repulsive it\u2019s almost cute. Then again, it\u2019s not attached to my chest. The creature is no more than an oblong blob beneath March\u2019s shirt, barely seeming to breathe. I don\u2019t know how the oxygen-rich environment is going to affect its development or what other chemicals it needs to thrive.</p><p>\u201cWe should analyze the atmosphere here and the contents of the soil. Maybe take some of that mud with us for when it\u2019s older?\u201d</p><p>Dina smirks at me now. \u201cYou\u2019re nesting. I mean you finally shagged, right? You two went out into the wild alone and came back with a baby. Should\u2019ve figured your children would be ugly but daaaaamn...\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo fix something,\u201d March bites out.</p><p>To my surprise, she does, but not quietly. \u201cI get this ship flightready in less than forty-eight hours, and I\u2019m begrudged a little amusement? When the revolution comes, I will destroy you all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe revolution came,\u201d Loras calls after her. \u201cYou lost.\u201d</p><p>Her response echoes back: \u201cKiss Jax\u2019s ass.\u201d</p><p>And I laugh softly.</p><p>\u201cBody temperature\u2019s a little on the high side since we\u2019re warm-blooded, but its life signs are good. Just need a little more of this amino acid...\u201d Doc mutters. \u201cHm, try this? Theoretically, it\u2019s a close enough match, and if the little fellow doesn\u2019t eat soon...\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy chest hair,\u201d he protests, as Saul comes for him with a glove full of goo.</p><p>\u201cGood point.\u201d Without so much as a \u201cplease\u201d or \u201cyou look lovely tonight,\u201d Saul yanks my coverall open to the waist and slathers the stuff on my sternum. \u201cPass the baby, let\u2019s see how I did. March, go depilate yourself.\u201d</p><p>He heads for quarters, muttering, \u201cThis has to be a bad dream.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need to know more.\u201d Loras glances up from his research, uninterested in the spectacle. \u201cWe might be able to stumble through the first month, but we\u2019ve no idea where to go from there, nothing about their skill development. The undisputed Mareq expert is Canton Farr, but he published his last article more than two turns ago.\u201d</p><p>Oh Mary, it\u2019s slimy, licking me with its slithery pink tongue. Probably going to be a wonder at catching bugs, later. The nutri-gel is sticky, but its heartbeat grows stronger, steadier, thumping against my chest. The toes feel really bizarre against my skin. But there\u2019s a certain pride in what I\u2019m doing, even if it\u2019s beyond disgusting.</p><p>\u201cLast-known location?\u201d Doc asks, still monitoring me and baby-it.</p><p>Loras shakes his head. \u201cDoesn\u2019t say, but we don\u2019t have the range to search the full archives anyway, not to mention it would give away our position if we tried. I\u2019m thinking we need to bounce a message to Keri and see if she can find out for us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo that,\u201d March says from the doorway. \u201cEncrypt the relay if you can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cConsider it done.\u201d Loras waves and heads for his station.</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019re we naming him?\u201d I grin at March, who\u2019s staring like he\u2019s been hit with a shockstick.</p><p>His mouth opens, but all that comes out is, \u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>Belatedly I notice his eyes aren\u2019t on mine, and I glance down. Shit, I\u2019m standing around bare-breasted, nursing like some class-P village woman, my scars shiny with slime. Rest of me is covered in dried mud, and my hair looks like it belongs to a New Terran dirt-dauber priestess, so yeah, I\u2019ve never looked better. But frag him, what do I care? I\u2019m doing a good thing here.</p><p>Doc seems oblivious, so I glare at March. He\u2019s clean, the bastard. \u201cHey, I took your turn while you were making yourself silky-smooth. You could say thanks.\u201d</p><p>He clears his throat. \u201cThanks, Jax.\u201d</p><p>But I don\u2019t recognize that tone. Shrugging, I say, \u201cI\u2019m dying for a shower. Doc, you wanna grease March up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep,\u201d March mutters. \u201cThat\u2019s shooting right to the top of the list of questions I never want to hear again.\u201d</p><p>The baby doesn\u2019t want to let go of me, and in the end, I have to gently peel its little toes away one by one. However, once it tastes the gel on March\u2019s skin, it seems content to latch on. I think it\u2019s the food source; thing isn\u2019t old enough to form emotional attachments, if the Mareq even do that as we know it. We really need to find this \u201cexpert\u201d Loras was talking about.</p><p>What was his name? Canton Farr.</p><p>I don\u2019t stay to listen to March\u2019s whimpering, miserable moans, and I\u2019m proud of myself because I don\u2019t collapse laughing until I\u2019m safely in quarters. But as I straighten I get a look at myself in the mirror above my bed. Mother Mary of Anabolic Grace, it\u2019s worse than I thought. I squeeze my eyes shut and fumble to the san-shower because I don\u2019t want to see that filthy hag again.</p><p>Maybe an hour later, and yes, I took that long, my door chime sounds. Quickly, I scramble into the loose ki-pants and cami that serve as my pajamas and answer it. I\u2019m surprised to find March standing there. The baby\u2019s well fed, it seems, and making odd little whirring sounds that I interpret as contentment. Think this is the first time he\u2019s sought me out since Perlas, where he had no choice. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His gaze drops to the sliver of skin where my trousers and shirt don\u2019t quite meet, and I become aware of my hip bone riding above the fabric.

Didn\u2019t mean it when he muttered we should leave it. Through our interference, the little guy was born out of season, and none of the mature Mareq will stir until it warms up. Far too late\u2014and March would never hurt something that couldn\u2019t fend for itself, not even with neglect.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve never needed me for that,\u201d I say softly. \u201cAnd you never will.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s smiling as I close the door in his face.</p><p>CHAPTER 24</p><p>We\u2019re two standard days out of Marakeq, cruising straight space, when Keri\u2019s reply reaches us.</p> <p>Stupid to jump until we know where we\u2019re going, since by some miracle the gray men haven\u2019t descended on us yet. Maybe Zelaco didn\u2019t make contact with the Corp after all. Maybe that was just March and me relaxing with a round of worst-case scenario. That\u2019d be a nice fragging change.</p><p>Evidently her encryption ware isn\u2019t compatible with ours because the message plays in skips and hisses: \u201c...wish I knew what the...but anyway...Lex...exploded.

Everyone\u2019s oddly subdued, and for once, I know why. Doc mumbles and heads off to medical, probably to record his will or something.</p><p>\u201cSo how bad is this guy, really?\u201d I ask Dina, who sighs.</p><p>\u201cPut it this way,\u201d she answers. \u201cHe calls that shit hole on the Outskirts his kingdom. Seriously. Do you need to hear more?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLong haul in straight space,\u201d March says, sounding thoughtful.</p><p>I sigh. \u201cNo shit. Why don\u2019t we just let Doc do his best and get on with our mission? We need more samples, don\u2019t we? This training academy isn\u2019t going to build itself.\u201d</p><p>For once Dina agrees with me. \u201cSounds good. Let\u2019s give Hon a wide berth and say a Hail Mary for baby-it.\u201d</p><p>Wearing his \u201ccaptain\u201d expression, March says, \u201cLook, it\u2019s my fault this thing hatched early. I can\u2019t in good conscience proceed without doing everything possible to ensure it thrives. Let\u2019s ask Doc what he thinks.\u201d</p><p>Loras studies March with an impassive mien. If this comes to a vote, I suspect he\u2019ll be the tiebreaker. Then he beeps Doc in medical to ask, \u201cIf we choose not to seek out the Mareq expert, what are the chances we can successfully raise the hatchling to an age where you can obtain viable amounts of genetic material for your research?\u201d</p><p>Even through the screen, Doc seems startled. \u201cI thought this was decided. Very well, let me run the numbers.\u201d He taps some figures into his handheld and sighs. \u201cHighly probable we\u2019ll kill it within the first month without expert guidance. If it lives that long, I can take some decent samples, but for the sake of my research, I prefer we take the route that benefits the specimen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI say we go, too,\u201d March puts in. \u201cYou and Dina vote against?\u201d</p><p>I glance at her. Doc\u2019s detachment has made me twitchy. How ironic that Doc is arguing for the benefit of the creature, though not for purely humanitarian reasons. On the whole, this side junket seems like a waste of time.</p> <p>With an apologetic look at March\u2019s chest, I mutter, \u201cYeah. Let\u2019s keep working toward the original goal.\u201d</p><p>Dina nods. So yep, it\u2019s up to Loras now. Everyone turns toward him to see which way he\u2019ll swing.</p><p>\u201cWe should go,\u201d he says at last. \u201cNobody will die if we push back our schedule, but the little one might if we fail to learn how to care for him properly. And I won\u2019t be party to devaluing his existence because he\u2019s nonhuman.\u201d</p><p>Ouch. That cuts deep on so many levels. As a humanoid alien, Loras would know all about being made to feel lesser.</p><p>Though nobody else would notice, I see the way March relaxes. His shoulders lose a tension I hadn\u2019t registered consciously until it dissipates. This meant a lot to him, and I need to find out why.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He makes some effort to shake it off, apparently registering my concern.</p><p>In two days, he seems to have gotten used to having baby-Z attached to his chest. I\u2019m not sure what Z stands for, but the name stuck. I\u2019ve caught March whispering a few times, trying to mimic the only recorded example of Mareq speech among Farr\u2019s work. And, of course, I\u2019ve played surrogate twice more while March was in the san-shower. Nobody else will touch the thing, not even Doc. He said he\u2019d done enough, between the food source and the patch on its skin that provides other necessary chemicals not naturally present in our environment.</p><p>\u201cIf we\u2019re going,\u201d I say, \u201clet\u2019s combine what we know about the place.\u201d I wrack my brain for a moment. \u201cIt was built as a supply station before certain beacons were discovered. Since then, trade routes changed.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t want them thinking I\u2019m ignorant; I know why Hon-Durren rules that corner of space. Nobody else wants it. But still, the man isn\u2019t someone you cross lightly. He styles himself a raider, though nobody knows how many ships comprise his \u201carmada,\u201d because he tends to kill people who come calling, bad for us and worse for Canton Farr.</p><p>\u201cFarr might be all right.\u201d March answers me without seeming to realize I haven\u2019t spoken. For the first time I wonder if the others know. Obviously Mair did, but what about the crew? \u201cHe\u2019s a Fugitive, after all, and if he was in deep shit after pirate-publishing his work on a Corp-restricted world, where better to hide out?\u201d</p><p>Dina nods. \u201cAnd Hon-Durren hates few things more than authority.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m familiar with the Fugitives as well, scientists who flout Corp regulations regarding restricted worlds. Every now and then, they orchestrate an impassioned protest, shouting that the Corp has no right to limit knowledge. Though I used to see them as a fringe faction, rabble-rousers and dissidents, I don\u2019t disagree with their ideas anymore.</p><p>And technically, we\u2019re worse than Fugitives, who are so careful when they study on class-P worlds. Under no circumstances would one of their scientists reveal himself; in fact, a few have died of some simple illness rather than compromise an alien culture. As for us, we\u2019re more like Freak Show Talent Scouts, although I don\u2019t know of any that have kidnapped a Mareq hatchling. Maybe we\u2019re just in a class by ourselves.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d March says then. \u201cTime to jump, Jax.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s still going to be thirteen days in straight space, even from the nearest beacon,\u201d I tell his back, and he waves in acknowledgment over his shoulder.</p><p>As we settle in the cockpit, he gets on the comm. \u201cHead to the hub and strap in, people. We\u2019re going to pay an old friend a visit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAcknowledged,\u201d Loras returns.</p><p>I pause in checking the port to slide him a glance. Looks like the nav chair escaped damage in the crash, but Dina probably already inspected it. She really is good at her job.</p><p>\u201cYou know him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLong time ago,\u201d he mutters.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all you\u2019re going to tell me?\u201d I gaze at him, incredulous.</p><p>He nods. \u201cRight now. We have work to do.\u201d</p><p>Sighing, I realize I can\u2019t argue that. The sooner we leave this system, the better. We\u2019ve probably been here too long already.</p><p>The comm crackles, and Dina announces, \u201cWe\u2019re ready.\u201d</p><p>March taps a few panels, and I feel the comforting throb of the phase drive powering up. The whine that accompanied its use last time translates to low purr instead, so I know we\u2019re good. \u201cLet me see the locus of a long haul between our current position and Hon-Durren\u2019s Kingdom,\u201d I tell the nav computer.</p><p>\u201cNo match,\u201d it answers, sounding almost smug.</p><p>Fragging AIs.</p><p>March thinks a moment, then suggests, \u201cTry DuPont Station.\u201d</p><p>Shit, nobody\u2019s used that name in...well, forever, but...of course, that\u2019s where we find the file. According to official record, DuPont Station is derelict, but anyone taking these maps verbatim would receive a rude awakening. I study the coordinates and realize I\u2019ve made this run before, maybe five turns back, although my final destination differed.</p><p>\u201cHate the Outskirts, but at least there\u2019s minimal Corp presence.\u201d If there\u2019s a place where lawlessness is the rule, rather than the exception, then we\u2019re headed right for it.</p><p>March grins at me. \u201cTruer words were never spoken, Jax.\u201d</p><p>Not until after I plug in do I realize I don\u2019t feel the same nausea and dread as the first two jumps. Whatever else he is, he\u2019s my pilot now. And part of me feels like I\u2019ve made the adjustment too fast, as if I\u2019m betraying Kai in some fashion.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s gone,\u201d March reminds me gently. \u201cAnd I\u2019m all you\u2019ve got.\u201d</p><p>Hearing those words doesn\u2019t hurt as much this time. I know I\u2019m never going to kiss Kai for luck again, never going to wake in his arms, never going to see him smile, never hear his laughter ring out. He\u2019s gone, and I\u2019m alive, whether I want to be or not. Only the ache remains.</p><p>When March jacks in beside me, he doesn\u2019t bring up the mental partition. He\u2019s still compartmentalized, just like me, but he\u2019s not hiding anymore. Among other things, he lets me see that he needs me to see this thing through. I wonder if he\u2019d let me rummage through his mind, as he seems to do with me or whether he\u2019d slap my metaphysical hands.</p><p>Then I register his unmistakable amusement as the seat vibrates beneath me. Make yourself at home, Jax.</p><p>I\u2019m starting to do just that as the trembling increases, and I decide that the way we\u2019re rocking isn\u2019t right. That slinging side-to-side motion almost feels like we\u2019ve been hit\u2014and then I hear Dina shouting via comm: \u201cMake the Mary-sucking leap already! Since when does the Corp hire bounty hunters...?\u201d</p><p>With a flick of his palm, March shuts Dina up, and the world explodes in color, scintillating, dazzling patterns that form and fold in on themselves. My whole body aches because this is homecoming, and I\u2019ll never belong anywhere more than I do here. Grimspace steals my soul a sliver at a time, and I love it too much to mind. Each time I leave, I forget a little of the majesty, or I wouldn\u2019t survive the loss.</p><p>I can\u2019t worry about the ship that fired on us as we made the leap, can\u2019t let myself wonder whether they had a jumper on board and if they\u2019re giving chase. It takes every ounce of concentration to make the mental translation from straight space, then feel my mind\u2019s eye spinning like an old world compass.</p><p>But this is different, different than flying with Kai, different than the first two jumps with March. Because I can feel what it\u2019s like inside his skin, each breath he takes and how his heart beats. I feel the steady pulse of baby-Z against his chest, the faint stickiness of the nutri-gel that March no longer notices. And I\u2019m aware of his hands on the controls as I never have been. I could almost fly the ship if I had to, because we\u2019re not him and me, we\u2019re...we, then I sense his astonishment, sharing my mind\u2019s eye as we gaze outward to grimspace. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Maybe I gave him some sense of it before, but this time, he sees completely, and I know he does: the glory, the colors, and the almost-manifest monsters that writhe along the hull. The Folly plows through liquid fire; the world without is a conflagration of possibility, ideas and dreams barely conceived and waiting to be given form.</p><p>But March and yes, it\u2019s the March-me spinning my mind\u2019s eye away from the beacon. He\u2019s doing it, and I didn\u2019t even know this was possible. He\u2019s trying to show me\u2014</p><p>Shit. There\u2019s a ship coming up fast behind us. I don\u2019t know whether they stayed with us through the jump or whether we\u2019ve stumbled into a time trail. Regardless, I don\u2019t want it following us into straight space, because it doesn\u2019t seem friendly, and I sense accord from March. We\u2019ve got to get rid of them and fast, before I exhaust my mental energy. We both know some ships make the jump, and for some reason, never come out again, but the March part of me loves a challenge.</p><p>Come on, assholes, let\u2019s play.</p> <p>CHAPTER 25</p><p>I know what we\u2019re going to do before he does it.</p><p>The spin feels ugly, graceless, and my stomach hurtles into my throat, bounces back as we whip the way we came. Suddenly we\u2019re coming at them hard-forward, and they have to choose, collision or roll. What happens when two ships crash here?</p><p>I\u2019m pretty sure I know why we\u2019ve never heard of it happening; no one lives to tell the tale. I taste March\u2019s satisfaction, the pumping adrenaline. Mary, he lives for this, and with his\u2014our?\u2014pleasure pounding through me, I\u2019m not even afraid as the other ship slings sideways out of our path. This is glorious, exhilarating, and I sense his agreement.</p><p>Then we make the loop again, going nowhere, over the top, back the way we came, again and again, until I feel dizzy. He\u2019s actually doing it, though I\u2019ve never seen anyone create grimspace ghosts on purpose. Now there are so many copies of Svetlana\u2019s Folly that even I have a hard time telling which vessel\u2019s ours.</p> <p>This is the longest I\u2019ve ever been jacked into grimspace, and I feel my body shuddering, although I feel strangely detached from its meat. The vista in my mind\u2019s eye expands until I can see farther than I ever have. What would be the horizon beckons, if this place possessed such a thing. It\u2019s not a door but something else and\u2014</p><p>No. Jax, no. Find the beacon.</p><p>But it\u2019s not that easy. For the first time during a jump I\u2019m aware of fierce physical pain, and the outward tug grows stronger. I\u2019m not sure I can resist it, and what\u2019s more, I don\u2019t want to; I want to see. I want to know. I\u2019ve spent my whole life preparing for this final journey, and maybe through the door-that-isn\u2019t-a-door lie the people I\u2019ve lost. Maybe Kai\u2019s waiting for me with a kiss and a smile.</p><p>Don\u2019t you dare leave me, Jax. Don\u2019t you dare.</p><p>And then I feel stronger somehow. March wraps himself around me in ways I didn\u2019t know were possible. Everything I am is filled with him. Every cold and shadowed place, he kindles with light, warmth, clutching me tighter, until he\u2019s all I know, and I can\u2019t hear the siren song anymore.</p><p>Stay with me. Stay.</p> <p>The pain returns as I try to focus, seeking the signal that\u2019s always helped me orient in the past, but it feels thready and weak, diluted by my weariness and whatever\u2019s gone wrong inside my flesh.</p><p>I think, here.</p><p>March responds with sure hands, knowing we have to get me out of here, or I\u2019m going to be lost. As the ship shudders, making the leap back, I\u2019m not sure where the frag we are, certainly a first. And my sole satisfaction is that the bounty hunters who hounded us here don\u2019t seem to know which Folly to follow as our ghosts split in different directions like the scattering of a school of fish.</p><p>My hands shake as I unplug, and when I try to open my eyes, it feels like the light is made of knives, stabbing straight in my skull. I touch my face. Find it wet. And my fingers smell of copper. Never known a run this bad.</p><p>\u201cJax...\u201d His voice sounds rough, raw. \u201cYou\u2019re close, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t ask what he means. But for a moment, I can\u2019t speak, can\u2019t do anything but try to stop the steady stream of blood trickling out my nose. Then I hear him moving beside me, and soon there\u2019s a cloth in my hands. I wish I could see his face, but I can\u2019t bear the brightness in my eyes. At this moment I\u2019m beyond empty, remembering the delicious pull and the way he wrapped around me. Now, I have neither; I\u2019m just Jax, alone inside my head in a way I never have been, and it isn\u2019t halfway to enough.</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d I answer finally, and then try to drive some of the despair out of my tone. \u201cYou said it yourself, I\u2019m pretty old. Had a good run.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit. I just got used to you.\u201d</p> <p>I want him to lift me up out of this seat, hold me in his lap like he did after the crash. But he\u2019s already nursing one helpless infant, so I stand up blind, finding the open doorway with my fingertips. Before heading for my quarters, I offer a bittersweet smile.</p><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t you figured that out yet, March? Sometimes bad things happen for no reason, and there\u2019s nothing you can do about it. How close did I come anyway?\u201d</p><p>His muttered curse tells me he hasn\u2019t even thought to find out where we are. \u201cNot the best jump,\u201d he says, after a moment. \u201cBut not terrible. We\u2019re about three weeks out.\u201d</p><p>Eight days then. I added eight days to our trip, but that\u2019s what it has to be, because I don\u2019t have another jump in me, not for a long fragging time, maybe never. I\u2019ll have to assess what I\u2019ve got left after I rest. The way that I feel, it\u2019s just impossible to tell.</p><p>\u201cDo we have the supplies to cover the longer haul?\u201d</p><p>He sighs, and I hear him tapping away. And then: \u201cYeah, but after day seventeen we\u2019re going to be left eating nothing but paste. Hey,\u201d he calls after me. \u201cHave Doc check you out!\u201d</p><p>I dismiss that idea with a flick of my fingertips, but as I\u2019m coming out of the cockpit, I collide hard with someone. I feel hands on my upper arms to steady me, but the faint floral scent surprises me; I didn\u2019t realize Dina ever smelled so feminine. \u201cAsshole,\u201d she gripes. \u201cWatch where you\u2019re\u2014oh shit, Jax. Are you...What happened?\u201d</p><p>I just shake my head and brush by because I don\u2019t want to talk to her about it. March can tell her anything she needs to know, or anything he feels like she does. Right now, I just want to be left alone.</p><p>\u201cNo visitors, no exceptions,\u201d I tell the room-bot.</p><p>\u201cAcknowledged,\u201d it chirps.</p><p>I don\u2019t clean up. Though I\u2019m probably a mess with all the dried blood, I just don\u2019t care, need to crash out on my bunk and close my eyes. Darkness falls fast\u2014this sleep feels heavy and inevitable as my own death.</p><p>Yes, I must be dying because I hear Kai\u2019s voice...</p><p>\u201cGround control, this is the Sargasso. I\u2019d like you to double-check the suggested trajectory and coordinates. Our readings don\u2019t agree. That\u2019s going to put us on the ground about one hundred klicks from the landing site and\u2014\u201d</p><p>A hiss from the comm system, then an irritated male voice says, \u201cThe information you received is correct, Sargasso. Follow procedure. Control out.\u201d</p><p>We exchange a look, frowning. Although we\u2019re not jacked in anymore, we share the feeling that something\u2019s wrong. I\u2019ve had that sense since we left Soltai Station, and now that we\u2019re making our approach to Matins IV, the bad mojo doubles. Waiting for clearance in this giant bolt bucket, so different from the fast, elegant ships we usually take out with a minimal four-man crew, we do our own math and come up with coordinates that differ dramatically from what the Corp landing authority has provided.</p><p>When I nod in encouragement, Kai presses the call button again. \u201cGround control, this trajectory is not going to create sufficient drag for a vessel of this size. What you\u2019ve given us is a crash waiting to happen.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a long, ominous silence, then: \u201cSargasso, you have seventy-five VIPs on board. Are you refusing to comply?\u201d</p><p>Kai looks deeply troubled now, torn between the need to obey the Corp and the fact we\u2019re both certain they\u2019re on the verge of doing something terrible, either from incompetence or some agenda we can\u2019t begin to guess.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he says slowly, \u201cbut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is your third denial of an approved flight plan. We have no choice but to categorize this as a mutiny attempt and respond accordingly.\u201d</p><p>And then they aren\u2019t talking to us anymore. There\u2019s only silence, which is worse.</p><p>\u201cGoing to autopilot,\u201d the computer announces with seeming delight. \u201cOverride codes accepted. Trajectory and coordinates received.\u201d</p><p>Oh no. No.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t survive a hit like this\u2014there\u2019s no way\u2014\u201d I\u2019m scrambling at the terminal now, trying to restore control on our end.</p><p>\u201cSiri, what the fuck\u2019re they doing...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWish I knew, baby.\u201d</p><p>Dream-Jax hasn\u2019t registered the full implication yet, but the rest of me knows what\u2019s coming. I want to scream, but this is scripted, so I just watch in puzzlement, part of me still not wanting to believe that the Corp, our benevolent big brother, will let us come to harm, or worse, cause us harm. Kai, he\u2019s terrified, reaching for me as the planet rushes up to meet us. All around me the world dies.</p><p>I wake screaming so my throat is raw, and there\u2019s someone pounding on my door, shouting, \u201cJax! Jax! Captain\u2019s override, dammit, let me in!\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s all coming back to me. Unit Psych Newel whispering through my dream therapy, \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t accept the Corp flight plan, would you, Jax? You used your own calculations. Just say it. Say it, Jax, and this will all be over. Say it, and I\u2019ll make everything all right.\u201d</p><p>Unlike so many other induced nightmares, this one carries a ring of truth. I know what they did to me, now\u2014I just don\u2019t know why. As I\u2019m lying there, bathed in icy sweat, I hear March swearing, muffled murmurs of conversation:</p><p>\u201c...been almost three days,\u201d Dina\u2019s voice. \u201cI thought she was dead.\u201d She doesn\u2019t sound heartbroken that I\u2019m not, actually.</p><p>\u201cOpen up, right now,\u201d March growls, \u201cor I get the cutting torch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo visitors,\u201d the room-bot tells him sweetly. \u201cNo exceptions.\u201d</p><p>If I didn\u2019t feel like such a pile of shit, I\u2019d find that funny as hell.</p><p>CHAPTER 26</p><p>So I\u2019m up on Doc\u2019s exam table once again.</p><p>I\u2019m starving, but he won\u2019t let me eat until he\u2019s finished with his tests. Not sure what the deal is, I feel fine. What I really want is a big bowl of pasta and a san-shower, not necessarily in that order. But he insists he needs to check me out because it\u2019s not normal for someone to sleep for three days without any sign of dehydration.</p><p>I try to tell him it\u2019s happened before, anytime I have a bad run\u2014my body shuts down like that\u2014but he\u2019s not listening. Instead, he\u2019s frowning over images of my brain. \u201cThat\u2019s impossible,\u201d he mutters. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sighing, I ask, \u201cCan I go? Please?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHm? Yes, go ahead. Get something to eat, and drink plenty of fluids.\u201d</p><p>I take his advice, after cleaning up a bit. The san-shower makes me feel almost human, and a change of clothing always helps. Today, I feel stronger than I have in months, so I dress accordingly: black bodysuit, black boots, and a touch of perfume. As always, my wild hair is hopeless, so I simply scrape it back.</p><p>Then I head to the galley, where I intend to eat a big plate of pasta, New Venice style, which means lots of s-cheese and red pepper. I find Loras there, picking at his fruit. Looks like something\u2019s bothering him.</p> <p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d I ask the question as I key my request and the kitchen-mate hums as it gets to work.</p><p>\u201cI should not burden you with it,\u201d he says, after a long moment.</p><p>But that\u2019s a roundabout way of saying yes, so I spin to look at him. \u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head. \u201cYou\u2019ve been ill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust exhausted, but I\u2019m all right now, so talk to me.\u201d The kitchen-mate beeps, letting me know my food\u2019s ready, and the doors slide back to reveal a steaming bowl, which I handle carefully as I join Loras at his table.</p> <p>He watches me with unmistakable intensity, and just as the silence begins to feel uncomfortable, he sighs, and says, \u201cYou haven\u2019t thought about me at all, have you?\u201d To be honest, I haven\u2019t. I\u2019m not even sure what he\u2019s getting at. \u201cMarch told us, Jax. Everyone knows you\u2019re getting close to burnout, and if you keep jumping...\u201d</p><p>It takes me a minute but I make the connection. \u201cOh shit.\u201d</p><p>His mouth twists. \u201cYes, precisely. Is there any chance March was wrong? That you can make the rest of these jumps?\u201d</p><p>I wish I knew. Somehow I thought it\u2019d be clear, that I\u2019d be able to pinpoint how many jumps remain to me. I always thought jumpers chose to go out in style instead of the sad impotence of retirement. Now I\u2019m seeing that simply isn\u2019t so.</p><p>Because even now that I\u2019m rested, I don\u2019t know how much I have left in reserve. My next jump could be my last, or I might make twenty more. I\u2019m just not sure, but I am positive I\u2019m not as strong as I used to be. The cruelly candid Jax forces me to acknowledge that March is the majority of the reason I made it last time.</p><p>With a soft sigh, I shake my head. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo you have any near relatives?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust my parents, but I haven\u2019t spoken to them in years.\u201d It\u2019s one thing to feel resigned to my own death, quite another to know I\u2019m condemning someone else. \u201cI could look into adopting March, though.\u201d As the words leave my mouth, I know I\u2019ve only made things worse.</p><p>He stands, slamming his chair back, and I register the glitter in his eyes as anger. \u201cThis is just a big joke to you. I wish you\u2019d let me take my chances on Lachion.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s nothing I can say to that, and so I watch him go. Now I\u2019m the one picking at my food, though I was starving a few minutes before. Knowing I need the energy, I force myself to eat.</p><p>\u201cYou just never stop making friends, do you?\u201d Dina saunters to the kitchen-mate and makes herself a hot drink.</p><p>Guess she ran into Loras.</p><p>\u201cYeah. If it wasn\u2019t for you, I\u2019d be the biggest asshole on this ship.\u201d</p><p>But she just grins as she joins me without waiting for an invitation. \u201cSo you\u2019re really dying or what?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot if I can figure out a way around it.\u201d Saying it aloud cements my resolve. \u201cIt\u2019d be different if it was just me, but it isn\u2019t. I\u2019d forgotten that.\u201d</p><p>Dina takes a sip from the gleaming silver mug. \u201cIf you were married or life-bonded, your partner would serve as next of kin.\u201d</p><p>I raise a brow. \u201cIs that a proposal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMary forefend. I was just giving you the big picture.\u201d</p><p>As I shove a bunch of noodles in my mouth, something\u2019s nagging at me. I chew slowly, thinking it over. \u201cTechnically, I think I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarried.\u201d</p><p>She pauses, mug in midair. \u201cYou heartless slut. Making illegitimate lizard-babies with March and leading him on. He\u2019s going to be devastated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s more of a frog-baby actually.\u201d But I wave away her bullshit, convinced I\u2019m on to something. \u201cSeriously, listen. I got married about ten turns ago. He was Corp, permanently assigned to Soltai Station, which was my home base also, but the way I traveled with Kai, well, it was more than Simon could stand. We separated, Mary, I don\u2019t even remember when. But I don\u2019t think we ever dissolved the marriage legally. He said something about wanting to keep the higher bennies, and I didn\u2019t mind. Kai wasn\u2019t the marrying kind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got higher bennies for being married?\u201d Of all things to focus on...but she looks pissed off.</p><p>\u201cMore R&amp;R, family days, that kind of thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about life-mates? Do they get equal treatment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I say in exasperation. \u201cWhat the hell do you care how the Corp handles same-sex benefits? Are you looking to sign on?\u201d</p><p>She sighs, conceding the point. \u201cFine. So you think your estranged husband could save Loras? Is that it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure, but...is there something that states Loras must be in physical proximity of his protector at all times?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot that I know of, but I\u2019m not an expert on shinai-disposition by any means. So you\u2019re thinking\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf something happens to me, Simon nominally becomes Loras\u2019s protector but would remain unaware of his existence. Until Loras receives his first order from Simon, which will never come, my last order should be binding.\u201d</p><p>Dina smiles slowly. \u201cThat\u2019s remarkably clever. Since you told him he\u2019s forbidden to do anything but what he wants, if he doesn\u2019t want to go looking for Simon\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen he stays on the Folly and does whatever he pleases. In theory that cycle could continue, as long as Loras lives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith us, he doesn\u2019t need to worry about actual physical protection,\u201d she concludes. \u201cThat\u2019s a tidy solution. Obviously, the shinai-bond isn\u2019t supposed to function like that, so you\u2019ll need to check with Loras to ensure it will suffice, but otherwise, I think you may have found a loophole.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you do me a favor and talk to Loras about it? He\u2019s pretty pissed at me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>I feel a little lighter. Even if something horrible happens to me soon, and it most likely will, maybe I won\u2019t drag Loras down with me. It\u2019s been years since I spoke with Simon, but I wouldn\u2019t send Loras to him, even if we were on friendly terms. To the best of my recollection, he\u2019s a serious, dutiful man, who lives for rules, regulations, and order. I don\u2019t know what I was thinking when I married him except that he had a nice ass and gorgeous eyes.</p><p>\u201cDina...\u201d I pause, wondering at the wisdom of bringing this up. But she probably still thinks that Edaine knew she was going to die. \u201cIf it means anything, Edaine didn\u2019t make the choice to leave you. She didn\u2019t know it was her last flight until she jacked in.\u201d</p><p>Her face pales, gray eyes livid. \u201cHow do you know that? How can you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t tell with any precision, Dina. It\u2019s a myth, put out by the Corp so jumpers won\u2019t be afraid. They started telling us that to keep their shuttles running and their shipments on time. So we go on believing we\u2019ll know our last flight before we get to it, believing we\u2019ll have a choice between burnout and retirement. But that\u2019s just not the case. Maybe some jumpers figure it out, after a terrible run like I just had. Then they have the choice of never jacking in again, but I don\u2019t. Not unless we want to spend our lives on Hon-Durren\u2019s Kingdom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll this time,\u201d she says, studying her hands, \u201cI thought she just didn\u2019t have the balls to say good-bye. I thought she was trying to be brave, keeping it to herself. After everything, all we were to each other\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that\u2019s not the case. She must have felt terrible regret when she realized she\u2019d never see you again.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes shine too bright, and I make an abortive move to comfort her, at which she jackknifes to her feet. \u201cTouch me, and I kill you.\u201d And she bolts from the galley, leaving me to deal with her dirty mug.</p><p>Sighing, I finish my pasta.</p><p>CHAPTER 27</p><p>We\u2019re sick of the ship and sick of each other.</p><p>A three-week haul is just too long at close quarters. Nobody\u2019s mood improves when the kitchen-mate runs dry, and we\u2019re left sucking supper out of a packet. At first, Doc tries to keep everyone polite and social, but after the millionth game of mah-jongg, I\u2019m done. I\u2019ve spent the last four days in my quarters, reading Mair\u2019s files on the other nine planets. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll live to see them, but it can\u2019t hurt to be prepared. And PA-245 is better company than most of my shipmates.</p><p>But I don\u2019t know whether to be worried or relieved when March broadcasts on the comm, \u201cWe have visual on Hon-Durren\u2019s Kingdom, docking in less than an hour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf they don\u2019t shoot us down first,\u201d I mutter.</p><p>\u201cAre you presently in physical danger?\u201d the little machine inquires.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure. Hard to know what to expect of Hon-Durren, he embellishes his own legend so much.\u201d Don\u2019t ask me why I\u2019m answering; we\u2019ve been having conversations like this for the last four days. \u201cListen, I\u2019ve got to go, 245.\u201d</p><p>I close the sphere with this weird feeling of regret. Know that sounds stupid and maybe a bit nuts, but I like my PA. And that\u2019s not typical for me. I despise most AIs, who seem to be coded to maximize the annoyance they can cause.</p><p>Since I\u2019m not sure what the near future holds, I don a gauzy red shirt, yes, the color of blood and mourning\u2014both seem apropos under the circumstances\u2014and a pair of s-leather trousers. You never know what climate control will be like on these old stations, so I add a matching black jacket and stuff the PA into my pocket on impulse.</p><p>Then I tug on my boots. The wardrober on Lachion got them just right, so there\u2019s room for me to conceal a blade there, if only I had one. That might just get us in trouble, though. Do wish I had some jewelry, since throwbacks like Hon-Durren respect lavish ornamentation. As I don\u2019t, I improvise with perfume.</p><p>To my surprise, the ship\u2019s already empty when I emerge from quarters. At first, I\u2019m more than a little pissed, but that\u2019s the nav-star coming out. I\u2019m not a celebrity, not even in an artificial, Corp-crafted world, and since this isn\u2019t a jump, they\u2019re capable of handling the situation. Now I have some distance from the old Jax, I can admit March was right. Thought I was special because I possessed some pull in the Corp, because I tagged some new beacons, encountered a few new races, and didn\u2019t die of stupidity.</p><p>But when you come right down to it, that\u2019s a shitty reason for thinking you\u2019re somebody. The J-gene isn\u2019t something I accomplished on my own. It was a genetic lottery, which I won, then spent almost fifteen turns acting like it was entitlement. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>No wonder most of them hated me when I first came on board. In retrospect, I don\u2019t see much I like, either. And it finally occurs to me...maybe they didn\u2019t disembark so much as were taken, in which case, they may be relying on me for help.</p><p>Shit. Subtlety is not my strength, and I can almost hear March chuckling over the understatement. So what am I supposed to do?</p><p>Thinking about it yields no ready solution, but I\u2019d rather die than sit another minute on this ship. So that decides it. I press the panel, and the boarding ramp lowers with a whir that sounds louder in the empty bay. As I step off, I realize I don\u2019t have a remote keyed to the ship, so I\u2019m stuck here until I find the others.</p><p>It\u2019s cold, as docks tend to be, just a few meters of metal separating space and me. Definitely not a high-tech place. I see no bots performing maintenance, though there are a couple other ships nearby, and all of them look worse than the Folly. There\u2019s only one door, so I head toward it. Perhaps I should be nervous; the place seems to be deserted\u2014</p> <p>An antiquated speaker crackles, and a deep male voice asks, \u201cWho\u2019re you then, pretty?\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s been a long damn time since I heard anything like that. Even before Matins IV, I was never apt to win any beauty pageants. And I guess my unseen interrogator\u2019s waiting for a response, but I don\u2019t see how I\u2019m supposed to reply.</p><p>Then I hear March in the background, muffled but distinct: \u201cShe\u2019s with us.\u201d</p><p>The leprous metal door clangs open, and I\u2019m permitted to enter Hon-Durren\u2019s Kingdom. The view is decidedly industrial, derelict mining trolls and scavenged parts spread like mechanical intestines along the walls. I proceed with caution and come down a long, dim corridor into a larger space.</p><p>Wish I\u2019d seen the place before we docked; now I\u2019m wondering about the design of the station itself. Three more corridors adjoin from here, north, east, and west. I think this must\u2019ve been the docking authority, where spacers paid for their bay and use of other facilities. Now it\u2019s just empty but for a couple of closed-up windows that seem to bear out my theory.</p> <p>\u201cCome west, Jax.\u201d That\u2019s Doc, being helpful.</p><p>If it were anyone else, I\u2019d probably turn east, but I trust Saul as much as I trust anyone. And then I start to hear voices, so I follow the hallway until I emerge in what has to be Hon\u2019s \u201cthrone room,\u201d hung with war trophies and contraband weapons. My shipmates stand in a semicircle, as if awaiting judgment. In the far corner, there are tables and benches occupied by a scruffy lot of the usual suspects, but the larger space remains devoted to an elevated pilot\u2019s chair, festooned with coiled wire and chains.</p><p>Mother Mary of Anabolic Grace, is that him?</p><p>If people are talking to me, I don\u2019t hear it, just gazing at the man sprawled on the makeshift dais. Damn, he\u2019s...delicious: at least two meters tall, muscular, skin so dark it almost gleams blue, and long, wild braids trinketed with platinum and diamond glints. Just looking at him, I want to say he deserves every bit of his roguish reputation.</p><p>And please, can I be plunder?</p><p>Probably accustomed to this reaction, Hon gives me a slow grin, revealing white teeth, except for the front two, which appear to be solid gold. His voice is low and rich, lightly accented with a Darengo drawl unless I miss my guess. \u201cSeem you keepin\u2019 better company, March. Maybe I don\u2019t kill you after all.\u201d</p> <p>At this point I notice the tension in this tableau. \u201cWas that an option? If I get a vote, I\u2019m going to say you don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJax...\u201d March casts me a dark look. Maybe he thinks I\u2019m going to frag things up, but it doesn\u2019t look like I can make it worse. He cups a hand protectively over baby-Z, and I wonder if that topic\u2019s been bridged yet.</p><p>\u201cYou got some stones, bwoy, askin\u2019 me for a favor.\u201d</p><p>Oh, that\u2019s interesting. March never did tell me what history he had with Hon. Looks like I\u2019m about to find out, and as I\u2019m waiting, it occurs to me that the other three are pretty quiet. Especially Dina\u2014if she\u2019s locked down her mouth, then we\u2019re in serious shit, aren\u2019t we?</p><p>Beside me, March nods almost imperceptibly. \u201cI know we didn\u2019t part on the best terms after the Nicuan conflict,\u201d he says, \u201cbut this is actually a humanitarian mission.\u201d</p><p>What a great laugh, deep, ringing, and infectious. I fight an answering chuckle even though I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on. \u201cNot on the best terms\u2014you funny, March. First you stole my woman, then my ship, left me to die on that Mary-forsaken rock. But you make me curious, so I\u2019ll give you a minute before I kill you. Tell me your story.\u201d</p><p>March seems stuck, though. His body language tells me he\u2019s at a loss, so I step into the breach. If there\u2019s one thing I know how to do, it\u2019s run my mouth.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I missed the introductions.\u201d I step forward and offer my best smile. \u201cBut I\u2019m Sirantha Jax. And we\u2019ve come looking for Canton Farr. Do you know him?\u201d</p> <p>He\u2019s already nodding. \u201cMy library man, yah. What you want him for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDuring our travels, we found this little guy.\u201d</p><p>Against March\u2019s muted protest, I give Hon a glimpse of the docile amphibian curled against his chest. Z raises his head and peers around with protuberant eyes. Yeah, he\u2019s definitely grown a bit, and he\u2019s taking an interest in his environment.</p><p>\u201cGrrrr-upp,\u201d Z says, from deep in his throat.</p><p>We\u2019ve managed to surprise the big man. \u201cWhat the hell is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a hatchling,\u201d Doc volunteers. \u201cAnd Canton Farr is an expert on the Mareq. So if we have any hope of raising this fellow, it\u2019s imperative we confer with him.\u201d</p><p>Folding his arms, Hon studies the lot of us, as if wondering whether this is the whole story. Of course it isn\u2019t, but I know they don\u2019t want me blabbing anything else. \u201cWell, I make no cred killin\u2019 babies,\u201d he says finally. \u201cBut I give you access to Farr, you gift me someting back, yah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you have in mind?\u201d March asks, closing his shirt over baby-Z, who doesn\u2019t go quietly, and his burgeoning paternal instinct strikes me as pretty damn funny.</p><p>Hon glances between Dina and me. I suppose we do make a nice visual contrast\u2014I\u2019m dark where she\u2019s fair, and she\u2019s thick where I\u2019m thin. \u201cOh...I think we can work something out.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m afraid to look at Dina.</p><p>CHAPTER 28</p><p>Instead of executing the lot of us, Hon throws a party.</p><p>I think it\u2019s a display of power more than true hospitality. Everything in his demeanor says\u2014You are subject to my will, and I choose to be merciful, remember this. Or maybe he\u2019ll just seize any excuse to celebrate. He really is a throwback, albeit an utterly delicious one.</p><p>No chance to talk to anyone else, as the throne room comes alive with lights and music, a thrumming bass-heavy beat that sounds tribal, and as the rovers get to their feet to form a stomping, spinning circle of dancers, I notice almost no women, and his interest in Dina and me becomes less flattering and more alarming.</p><p>But I can\u2019t worry about that right now. They\u2019re laying the tables with fresh food, and it smells fantastic. My mouth waters at the prospect of eating something that doesn\u2019t need to be sucked out of a packet. They offer fresh fruit and vegetables, so there must be a hydroponics garden somewhere on station. Next they serve meat in sauce, which means it\u2019s likely synth-protein in disguise. For the perfect finish, add steaming baskets of bread with peppered oil for dipping. And let\u2019s not forget the sweet, cold Parnassian red.</p><p>Yeah, I\u2019m going to be here awhile.</p><p>I lose sight of how many times my cup\u2019s refilled, but it doesn\u2019t seem to matter. Everything loses its immediacy, gaining a pleasant veil, where the most important thing I need to do is shrug out of my jacket and join the dancers. Someone takes me by the waist, and I stomp along with him, trying to mimic the side-winding circle we seem to be making. I should really be wearing a big bell skirt for this, more dramatic in the spins.</p><p>After a while, I lose track of how many men catch me and spin me toward them. But I definitely notice when Hon steps in. Not seeing him would be like missing a solar eclipse. For a few moments, we simply dance, and I hear Dina saying, from somewhere, \u201cIf she wants to shag him, let her. I don\u2019t want to die for saying no, although if I was going to try a man, it\u2019d be him.\u201d</p><p>Then he leads me from the revelry, past the pilot\u2019s chair toward a sunken area filled with padded couches. He indicates I should sit, and I do, feeling the music pulsing through the soles of my boots. As he drops down beside me, the lights flicker over his skin, painting him in silver streaks and giving his strong features an almost demonic cast. But there\u2019s fascination in his darkly glittering eyes; he\u2019s everything a civilized woman isn\u2019t supposed to want. He might treat her like an empress or a whore as the mood strikes him, but she\u2019d never possess the faintest doubt that he owned her, body and soul.</p><p>\u201cWhere you get such fine scars, lovely?\u201d His voice rumbles like a purr near my ear, and I glance down in confusion, before realizing the diaphanous fabric of my blouse reveals the old burns along my arms and shoulders.</p><p>\u201cCrash landing.\u201d That seems like an oversimplification, but I retain just enough presence of mind to be wary.</p><p>\u201cMusta been a bad one,\u201d he comments, touching my shoulder lightly. It takes a moment, but I realize he\u2019s tracing the pattern through my shirt with a fingertip.</p><p>I nod. \u201cThey don\u2019t come any worse.\u201d</p><p>He regards me a moment, seeming thoughtful. \u201cI think I know who you are now.\u201d</p><p>Shit. Be cool, Jax.</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour bad crash was the Sargasso, yah?\u201d Hon doesn\u2019t wait for an answer. \u201cSo you must be March\u2019s jumper.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s no point in lying; that will just piss him off because he\u2019s already sure. \u201cI\u2019m not on good terms with the Corp anymore, though.\u201d Like that needs to be said.</p><p>He laughs. \u201cWe\u2019re both kill on sight, I think.\u201d</p><p>I think I just increased my value to him, although I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s because I have a Corp bounty on my head or because I can jump. Maybe it\u2019s a combination of the two. So what now? I can\u2019t afford to make him mad, and the wine\u2019s starting to wear off.</p><p>\u201cYeah, although I\u2019m sure they\u2019ve listed me as officially flatline. The bounty hunters they\u2019re sending after me are strictly on the slide.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo tell me, Sirantha Jax, are bad things chasin\u2019 you here?\u201d</p><p>I jerk my eyes back to his face, but he doesn\u2019t seem angry. In fact, if anything, he looks amused. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Think we lost them in grimspace, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, pretty. I\u2019ll fix it.\u201d</p><p>Well, I don\u2019t have the slightest doubt of that, but I\u2019m not sure his solution will benefit us. I\u2019m frankly astonished that we didn\u2019t get blasted before docking, and I have to wonder what March said that garnered safe temporary passage. Knowing March, it may have been something like: Don\u2019t you want to see my face when you kill me? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAre all the station\u2019s external weapons functional?\u201d Hopefully he won\u2019t take that as me probing for information that could be used against him.</p><p>Hon gives me an indulgent smile, leaning closer. Damn, he smells good, a spicy, smoky scent that renders him narcotic. \u201cDon\u2019t fret \u2019 bout that. Nobody gets in I don\u2019t want here, true. Now I\u2019m gone ask you, what you know \u2019 bout my business outside?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing, really.\u201d And that\u2019s the truth; most of what I\u2019ve heard is speculation. Because who the hell ever gets to meet Hon? If they did, this place would be overrun with women wanting to play pirates with him.</p><p>\u201cMe, I got a fleet of ships, and we appropriate goods from the Corp shippin\u2019 lanes, keep what we need and sell the rest in the Outskirts.\u201d He seems to study me as if waiting for me to ask an obvious question.</p> <p>So I consider for a moment. \u201cThat means you have jumpers. From where?\u201d</p><p>In fact, this gets me thinking about Edaine. Where did March find her? The Corp led us to believe we were the only source of trained jumpers. Of course they also had me thinking my shit didn\u2019t stink, so maybe I should stop believing anything I learned from them. It might make adjustment to the real world easier.</p><p>Hon grins, his gold front teeth gleaming. \u201cThe Corp\u2019s very wasteful. Hide jumpers away, don\u2019t even try to fix them. I smuggle them out, two or three at a time.\u201d</p><p>He must be talking about the broken ones, who suffer bad jumps and can\u2019t quite rebound. They wind up nervous, twitching, and heavily medicated in station asylums. And there are others, who possess the J-gene and begin training but lack the mental strength to handle grimspace. They\u2019re the saddest of all. But I gather he\u2019s making use of these lost souls somehow.</p><p>\u201cHow can you repair them?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy biomechanic. Not much personality after he\u2019s through, but my jumpers get the job done.\u201d</p><p>Part of me feels repulsed. Clearly he\u2019s talking about a mechanical integration that robs them of their humanity, but then again, what sort of life did they have, sedated in the asylums? Is being made useful any worse than remaining lost to horrors nobody else can see? I don\u2019t feel qualified to judge.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s...enterprising,\u201d I say at last.</p><p>His arm drifts around me, his large hand lighting on my far shoulder. \u201cBut you don\u2019t wanna talk \u2019 bout that right now.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d have to be an idiot not to know where this is heading, but I\u2019m not sure how I should react. How long since Kai died? How soon is too soon? But Hon is gorgeous, and if I can procure safe passage with a few nights of sex, why wouldn\u2019t I?</p><p>\u201cWhat then?\u201d I let myself lean against him, surprised by his heat and solidity.</p> <p>\u201cMe, I think you don\u2019t wanna talk at all.\u201d He runs his hand beneath the weight of my hair, long fingers flexing into my neck, and it feels good.</p><p>I find myself tilting my head, though he\u2019s applying minimal pressure, and I think that\u2019s the point. Another exercise of power\u2014I\u2019m supposed to offer my mouth. Wonder if he likes to play master/slave girl in the bedroom. That\u2019s not my thing; I don\u2019t enjoy submission, but maybe I\u2019ll give it a try, this once.</p><p>Still, I can\u2019t bring myself to close the few centimeters between our lips. It\u2019s just not my style, and I enjoy being chased, like it when a man makes an effort. That says I\u2019m worth the trouble to pursue, although it\u2019s been a long time. First, I was Simon\u2019s wife, then Kai\u2019s woman, although my toes curl, remembering the way Kai used to tantalize me.</p><p>Hon gives a low, husky laugh, as if he realizes I\u2019m not going to prove an easy conquest. It\u2019ll take more than his proximity and the brush of his fingertips on the nape of my neck. And then he whispers, \u201cOh, I am gone enjoy you, pretty.\u201d</p><p>The flickering lights and the throbbing music only add to the surreal quality of the moment, as he leans close. So close, I smell the wine on his breath. I can almost taste his kiss, and while I\u2019m not advancing, I don\u2019t pull back, either.</p><p>I\u2019m actually going to do it.</p><p>From a million miles away, I hear someone clearing his throat. \u201cJax. You\u2019re needed on the Folly. It\u2019s urgent.\u201d</p><p>Feeling giddy, I turn to see March behind us, and he doesn\u2019t look happy.</p> <p>CHAPTER 29</p><p>So far, I don\u2019t see any urgency.</p><p>Doc has brought Canton Farr back to the ship to show him the formula he used in synthesizing the nutri-gel March has been smearing on his chest for almost a month. I guess Dina and Loras are still on station, enjoying the party. Farr is a thin man with nervous hands, the sort who spills things compulsively, then makes the mess exponentially worse with his apologetic daubing. It\u2019s almost impossible to imagine him living rough for years, as he reputedly did during his covert study on Mareq.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you did this,\u201d Farr\u2019s saying, not for the first time I imagine. \u201cStole one of the hatchlings. It\u2019s abominable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d prefer we left it to die?\u201d March snaps.</p><p>Fortunately, Doc remembers we need this man\u2019s help, and adds in appeasement, \u201cYes, a regrettable necessity, to be sure, but think of the opportunities for study. You\u2019ll have a chance to verify all your observations at close range, won\u2019t you? I think it should be safe to take samples.\u201d</p><p>I still don\u2019t see why I\u2019m needed here.</p><p>Farr brightens. \u201cWell, that\u2019s certainly true. You seem to have gotten him\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a him?\u201d Doc wants to know.</p><p>The scientist nods. \u201c...past the initial hurdle, which means you\u2019re going to see an increase in activity. Typically the offspring stays close to its parent, participating in\u2014\u201d</p><p>March seizes my arm then, hauling me out of medical and down toward the hub, but he doesn\u2019t stop there, towing me toward the dormitory section like a derelict craft. I scowl up at him, yank out of his grasp, and stand there rubbing my biceps.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to talk to you privately,\u201d he bites out.</p><p>Around this point, I notice he\u2019s seething. Furious, in fact, although he\u2019s done a fair job of reining it back up until now. The door slides shut behind us; this is the first time I\u2019ve seen his quarters, but they\u2019re standard, devoid of personal effects.</p><p>I fold my arms. \u201cSo talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you nuts, Jax? Don\u2019t mess with someone like Hon.\u201d</p><p>Ha, I certainly never imagined he\u2019d care about my virtue. I wave a hand dismissively. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019m not stringing him along. It won\u2019t be a hardship to keep him warm while we\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>He just gapes at me, like it\u2019s impossible for him to imagine someone sleeping with me. I know I don\u2019t look as good as I did before the crash, but I\u2019m a rocket in bed. Maybe Hon knows that, so he\u2019s not put off the by the scars.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t be serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d I ask, incredulous.</p><p>\u201cSleeping with Hon.\u201d His tone suggests I\u2019d be whoring myself out.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I start ticking off reasons to do so on my fingers. \u201cHe\u2019s gorgeous, he smells good, it\u2019s been a long time since I had sex, and he might kill us if we piss him off.\u201d Yeah, the last reason does sound like pandering, but still, if I want to, and it keeps Hon happy, what\u2019s the big deal? \u201cGive me one good reason why I shouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>I can actually see his jaw working, like he\u2019s struggling with something, then he growls, \u201cHow about this?\u201d</p><p>And then he\u2019s in my space, body pressed up against mine. He\u2019s hard against me, and he cups my cheek in his palm as he lowers his head to claim my mouth with his. Oh Mary, I\u2019d never have guessed March could kiss like this, deep and devouring. I kiss him back, arms up around his neck, biting gently at his lips. He tastes like sweet wine and promises, and his tongue strokes mine in possession, telling me wordlessly why he doesn\u2019t want me keeping Hon warm.</p><p>I feel his hands on my hips, tugging me closer. He breaks the kiss, leaning his forehead against mine, and I know he can feel how my heart gallops, hear my hitching breath. He probably senses more than that, come to it, my first soft pulses of arousal.</p><p>His voice sounds soft now, teasing. \u201cHow about it, Jax? Is that a good reason?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d I whisper.</p><p>\u201cMaybe? Maybe, she says.\u201d But when I tip my head back, I see that he\u2019s smiling. \u201cIt\u2019s been a while for both of us. I don\u2019t see any reason for that to continue.\u201d</p><p>My words come out husky. Unsteady. \u201cI\u2019d just be using you for sex.\u201d</p><p>His eyes have the power to stop me in my tracks. I\u2019ve been fighting this for weeks now, refusing to admit it even to myself. How much he draws me.</p><p>He gives me a slow smile. \u201cI can live with that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would I pick you over Hon, though?\u201d Oh, I\u2019m a bitch for teasing him.</p><p>And it is a tease, because I\u2019ve been noticing the breadth of his shoulders and the round curve of his ass for weeks now. But I can tell he doesn\u2019t mind by the way he moves me against him, slow drugging circles, hip to hip.</p><p>\u201cRemember who you\u2019re dealing with, Jax. I know all kinds of things about what you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is probably a bad idea.\u201d Last-ditch effort to turn things aside, even though I don\u2019t want to, and March knows it.</p><p>He had me as soon as he cupped my hips in his hands and moved me on him, just so. If I\u2019m completely honest with myself, he had me weeks ago, when he promised he\u2019d always come for me. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m ready for this, but damn, do I want him.</p><p>\u201cMmhm.\u201d He finds my ear, licks a trail down to the lobe, then bites. \u201cSo tell me no, Jax.\u201d</p><p>Oh Mary, that\u2019s good.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I breathe.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re saying no?\u201d Now he\u2019s incredulous.</p><p>I give him a slow smile. \u201cI\u2019m refusing to say no.\u201d</p><p>Then we\u2019re a blur of questing hands. I want him naked, right now, although the desire to bare my scarred, skinny self is considerably less. He shakes his head in peeling my trousers down, and I don\u2019t need to ask to know that\u2019s meant as reassurance. I\u2019d almost forgotten the perfection of sexing your pilot. He\u2019s beautiful: brown skin, broad chest, and a tight, etched stomach.</p><p>March pushes me back onto his bunk and I run my palms up his chest. I feel the residue from the nutri-gel, and that makes me smile, although it melts into a moan. He\u2019s not gentle; he wasn\u2019t kidding when he says he knows what I want. I feel his teeth next, almost enough to hurt, and the gush of response makes me draw my knees up, making room for him between them.</p><p>\u201cLike that?\u201d he whispers into my skin. \u201cLike that, Jax?\u201d As he trails his fingers down my belly, teasing me because he knows how much I want him to go lower.</p><p>\u201cLike that. But more.\u201d I buck my hips, and he relents, dipping his fingers into me with a long, languid motion.</p><p>Oh Mary, the way he touches me\u2014it\u2019s like he knows exactly how\u2014but then he does, doesn\u2019t he? I whimper and arch, twisting beneath an intensity I\u2019ve never known. He strokes me, his lips roving until I can\u2019t stand any more. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cToo much?\u201d The bastard, he\u2019s taunting me.</p><p>\u201cOn your back,\u201d I manage to order.</p><p>It\u2019s his turn. Maybe I don\u2019t know his hot spots automatically, but I\u2019ll figure it out. With a smirk, March rolls over and I run my hands over his body, caressing here and there. Gauging his reaction. Grinning wickedly, I settle astride, my thighs framing his. He shudders beneath me when he feels my slick skin. My weight amplifies the sensation, and I seesaw on him, watching his face.</p><p>\u201cJax...\u201d Now he\u2019s the one gasping, although it feels fragging amazing to me, too, as I run my hands up his chest. I see the scars I speculated about so long ago, long and livid. Yeah, he\u2019s seen combat. The one above his hip looks like they almost got him. That gives me a twinge that I don\u2019t like.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m just using you for sex,\u201d I remind him, husky and low.</p><p>\u201cSo use me.\u201d His abdominal muscles ripple and go tight as he struggles to hold himself still. \u201cUse me, Jax.\u201d</p><p>I need no further invitation. Taking him in my palm, I give him a squeeze, which elicits a groan, then I simply hold him steady and sink down. His hands come to my hips, guiding me.</p><p>Oh Mary, that\u2019s so good.</p><p>March doesn\u2019t need to be told how I want to ride him. We fill the room with liquid sounds and our labored breathing. Sometimes he moans; sometimes I do. I love the feel of his hands roving my body, demanding and possessive, pulling me down.</p> <p>I feel the pressure building as I move on him, sweet, delicious heat, then he flicks his fingers down there again. My whole body locks. He rolls with me then, pushing my legs up.</p><p>\u201cMy turn,\u201d he whispers.</p><p>And I don\u2019t have the energy to resist as he takes me his way, rotating his hips in slow, steady thrusts. I\u2019m so relaxed that at first I don\u2019t register the tingles surging through me. Again? Really?</p><p>Then I hear March inside my head, just as he\u2019s inside my body. Again, Jax. I\u2019m using you for sex.</p><p>Right now, I feel like that\u2019s about the best news I\u2019ve ever heard.</p><p>CHAPTER 30</p> <p>I sneak out like I\u2019m leaving the scene of a crime.</p><p>As I dart into my quarters, part of me feels that I am, actually. I know it doesn\u2019t mean anything, and it doesn\u2019t touch what I felt for Kai. Because I\u2019m alive, and I\u2019m a biological organism, I know I need to be touched, but that awareness doesn\u2019t assuage my guilt. In some ways I think it would\u2019ve been better if I\u2019d picked Hon for some throwaway sex because I wouldn\u2019t have to see him on a daily basis hereafter.</p><p>In fact, I\u2019m not entirely sure why March cared whether I slept with Hon. Maybe it\u2019s a man thing, which is stupid. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m untouched. Between my marriage breaking down and falling in love with Kai, I did my share of fucking around.</p><p>But there was no premeditation with Kai; one night we were drinking and dancing, right after we tagged the beacon nearest the Belsev system\u2014and he asked me how come we\u2019d never slept together. He knew most jumpers and pilots do test the waters at least once, so he was wondering if I didn\u2019t find him attractive. That certainly wasn\u2019t the case; he was adorable, blond boyish good looks.</p><p>I didn\u2019t have an answer, so after some more drinking, we wound up naked. And it was fantastic. He was fun in bed, playful, but his best quality had to be how he listened. When he propped his chin on his hand and gazed at you with those liquid green eyes, you knew you were the only person in his world right then.</p><p>God, I miss him.</p><p>He certainly wasn\u2019t your typical man. Sometimes I\u2019d try to make him jealous, point out someone I thought was delicious, and he\u2019d give me a deceptively mild smile. \u201cGo ahead,\u201d he\u2019d say. \u201cTry someone else if you want. But he won\u2019t be me.\u201d</p><p>No, baby. He\u2019ll never be you.</p> <p>First time we talked about commitment, he said, \u201cI don\u2019t believe in that, Siri. People stay true as long as they want to, regardless of spoken promises or legally imposed obligations. But we\u2019re good together, and I want to be with you as long as you want me back.\u201d</p><p>I meant to clean up, but instead I drop down on my bunk, startled by the yearning that overtakes me. Who knew sex would make me feel so fragging lonely? There\u2019s a dull throb inside me, the ache of long-unused muscles, and I press my knees together, trying to forget what I\u2019ve just done.</p><p>If I let myself, I could cry, but I\u2019ve done far too much of that in the last few weeks. Instead, I measure my breathing until the urge subsides; and then I do take that shower, washing away the evidence. Maybe this is no revelation, but it feels like one to me; good sex just isn\u2019t enough. I won\u2019t do that again for a while.</p><p>I dress in somber clothing that covers me neck to ankle, permitting no glimpse of skin. Now I\u2019m not sure what to do; I don\u2019t want to sleep with Hon anymore, but I imagine he\u2019s not a man who handles rejection well, not that he receives much of it. Still, I\u2019m not accomplishing anything cowering in my quarters, so I head out.</p><p>Although I know it\u2019s beyond idiotic, I can\u2019t help skulking, peeking around doorways, then making a dash for the engine room, where I find a spare remote. I pocket that. I\u2019d like to avoid March for the next five to ten turns. Failing that, a day or two will suffice. I retrace my steps, and I\u2019m surprised to find the door out of the docking bay opens for me automatically. I guess it\u2019s been coded to recognize me, a measure I didn\u2019t expect so quickly, and it makes me wonder what Hon\u2019s planning.</p><p>To my surprise, the party seems to be over. I would have guessed such things went on all night; shows what I know. There\u2019s just a few scruffy spacers left playing Charm, and they peer at me over their cards.</p><p>\u201cLooking for the boss?\u201d One of them smirks at me.</p><p>Might as well get it over with, right? So I nod. \u201cKnow where he is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, he took the blond girl upstairs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe one who arrived with us?\u201d I try to conceal my astonishment. There\u2019s a development I never saw coming, but then again, something about Hon...damn. Though I\u2019ve made up my mind to stay off men, literally and figuratively, I\u2019m still tempted, remember his smoky-spicy scent.</p><p>He nods. \u201cYou want us to deal you in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat depends. You playing by Venice Minor rules?\u201d</p><p>Dumb question, I know. Men rarely play Charm by Venice Minor rules unless they\u2019re competing against women. There\u2019s just no motivation to seeing each other naked, except in specialized circles. But I don\u2019t have any creds to wager. I bet my accounts have been frozen, and trying to access them would send up a red flag.</p><p>The men exchange a look and start laughing, then the spokesman answers, \u201cWell, we weren\u2019t...\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cI\u2019d rather look around. Will restricted areas be inaccessible or clearly marked?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you won\u2019t be able to go anywhere you\u2019re not supposed to be. Be careful, though, we don\u2019t use the third deck, so no telling what\u2019s up there.\u201d</p><p>Nodding, I follow the corridor leading in the opposite direction. His mention of a third deck gives me a sense of the station\u2019s design, however, and I envision the slow revolution of each tier, creating gravity that keeps my feet on the floor. To my surprise, a large space past the throne room appears to be a library. Hon even possesses some ancient ink-and-paper books, though those are housed within a protective case.</p><p>\u201cFind what you\u2019re looking for?\u201d I spin to see Dina standing in the doorway. She doesn\u2019t look like she\u2019s been ravished, though.</p><p>I spare a moment to give thanks that she didn\u2019t see me slipping out of March\u2019s room. Mary knows, I\u2019d never live that down. \u201cI don\u2019t know what that\u2019d be.\u201d</p><p>She offers a faint smile. \u201cNobody ever does until it\u2019s gone, then they realize they had it all along.\u201d</p><p>Depressing but insightful.</p><p>\u201cThe rovers told me you went upstairs with Hon.\u201d A nice, noncommittal statement, and yeah, okay, I\u2019m dying to know but I won\u2019t ask. That would be rude. Wouldn\u2019t it?</p><p>At that she laughs. \u201cYeah, there\u2019s a bazaar on the second deck. I\u2019ll be heading back later with some trade goods so we can restock the kitchen-mate. The \u2018kingdom\u2019 runs primarily on barter.\u201d She lifts a brow. \u201cYou didn\u2019t think\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not,\u201d I say quickly. \u201cBut...well, he does smell good...\u201d</p><p>Dina rolls her eyes. \u201cMale pheromones don\u2019t work on me. Now if he sprayed himself with bitch-in-heat, he might get somewhere.\u201d</p><p>Pheromones? Was that the smoky-spicy scent? Here I thought it was Hon himself who put me in the mood...and then I wound up on top of March\u2014ah, shit. I want to cringe, but I refuse to give Dina any ammunition. Since I told her about Edaine, there\u2019s been a sense of amnesty between us, but I won\u2019t tempt her to break the cease-fire.</p><p>\u201cRight. Guess I\u2019ll go check out the bazaar. Which way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFollow the hall left, first right, down at the end is the lift. It\u2019s a bit temperamental, though.\u201d As I head out, she adds, \u201cBe careful, Jax. Hon\u2019s being too cooperative, and men like him aren\u2019t prone to forgiveness. I feel like we\u2019re sitting in the eye of the storm.\u201d</p><p>I flash a half smile over my shoulder. \u201cHow\u2019s that different from any other day?\u201d Then it occurs to me, she may be able to answer the question that\u2019s been bugging me since we docked, so I turn around. \u201cWhat\u2019s the deal with March and Hon anyway?\u201d</p><p>She shrugs. \u201cI\u2019ve been part of his crew maybe five turns now. He hired us out of Gehenna, right out from under another captain.\u201d</p><p>When she says \u201cus,\u201d she must be talking about Edaine and the other pilot, which means March stopped flying quite some time ago. I wonder why that is, not that I\u2019ll inquire, seeing as I\u2019ll be avoiding him for the next month or so, at least. Now that I glimpse the big picture, Dina\u2019s been through a hell of a lot.</p><p>\u201cMade a better offer?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cWe thought so, a cut of every job, not just flat wages. Anyway, maybe Loras knows; he\u2019s been with him the longest. Or you could try asking March.\u201d</p><p>I snort. \u201cYeah...\u2019 Cause he\u2019s so forthcoming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsk Hon. I bet he\u2019d tell you.\u201d Dina smirks, sauntering down the hall toward me.</p><p>\u201cI think you may be right. And that worries me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe being right or Hon being willing to answer your questions?\u201d</p><p>Pausing, I try to put my finger on what\u2019s bothering me. \u201cBoth?\u201d I flinch when she slams her fist into my shoulder, playfully. This woman could kick my ass one-handed. \u201cNo...Hon, I think. His attitude strikes me as wrong somehow. You\u2019re right; he\u2019s too accommodating.\u201d</p><p>She sighs, plainly agreeing with me. And that\u2019s a first. \u201cWell, you know what they say, sweetness. When you get a bad feeling, collect your creds and jump.\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cYeah, we need to get out of here as soon as possible.\u201d</p><p>But as Hon comes down the hall toward me, smiling like he\u2019s won a raffle, I think that may prove easier said than done. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>CHAPTER 31</p><p>I am toured out.</p><p>Hon has shown me around, although I haven\u2019t seen his suite, and I thought that would be our first stop. Maybe I just overestimated his interest? Mary knows, it\u2019s not like I\u2019m irresistible, but the juxtaposition bothers me. He\u2019s gone from amorous, aspiring lover to gracious guide in three hours, and that\u2019s just...not right.</p><p>Anyway, the back portions of the first two decks are allotted to housing, but I have no idea what an apartment here looks like. So I\u2019ve duly admired the hydroponics garden, his extensive library, which he\u2019s had Canton Farr cataloging for the last two turns, and of course, the oddly intriguing bazaar, where permanent residents trade among themselves. Raiders have to do something when they\u2019re not raiding.</p> <p>I particularly like the artists\u2019 section of the promenade. It\u2019s a touch of elegance I hadn\u2019t expected in such a place, but I suppose it\u2019s human nature to want to adorn one\u2019s living space, and when you\u2019re isolated, your best recourse is to tap your own creativity. So I commend the bold paintings and metal sculptures and various oddments.</p><p>There\u2019s even a dark-skinned woman, shaven completely bald, demonstrating the ancient art of the glass-dancer. Her movements flow smooth as the delicate treasures she creates from base chemicals, a sensual symbiosis of form and function. As I watch her, I think this ritual surely harks back to our Lady of Anabolic Grace, whose very name symbolizes the sanctity of change.</p><p>\u201cWho is she?\u201d I ask, admiring her.</p><p>\u201cA priestess,\u201d Hon tells me, and leads me on.</p><p>Somehow I\u2019m not surprised, and I cast a look over my shoulder. The artist dances, oblivious to onlookers, and I know I have never passed closer to Mary\u2019s grace than this moment. Of course there are more mundane vendors, selling refurbished droids, PAs, used clothing, footwear, hacking codes, weapons, oh, yeah, lots of those. There\u2019s a whole aisle of stalls devoted to them: shocksticks, blades, sappers, you name it, you can find it here, but the trick is finding something the seller wants in exchange because in Hon-Durren\u2019s Kingdom, they don\u2019t deal in creds. If this lay beneath an open sky, it would remind me of the starport market at Gehenna.</p> <p>We stop last at the food stalls, just a couple really, people offering fresh fruit and vegetables, bread and wine. I don\u2019t know what they want in exchange, but when Hon stops by, they offer food and libation freely. Well, he is the king, after all.</p><p>I take a sip, more Parnassian red. Good stuff, but I don\u2019t let it go to my head this time. He still smells wonderful, but now that I know it\u2019s a chemical effect, I find him easier to resist. Plus, I\u2019ve gotten laid recently, which doesn\u2019t hurt.</p><p>\u201cSo what happened between you and March anyway?\u201d Dina said he\u2019ll answer me. Maybe he will.</p><p>He shrugs. \u201cA woman, years ago, she chose him over me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy in Mary\u2019s name would she do that?\u201d I blurt the question before I stop to think about it, but fortunately he\u2019s flattered, giving me the wide, white smile that shines with gold. I mean, comparing the two, there\u2019s no contest, because Hon is gorgeous.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t know, don\u2019t care. That was a long time ago.\u201d Now why doesn\u2019t that ring true? Dina\u2019s right, men like Hon don\u2019t forgive and forget. \u201cLet me show you this, Sirantha Jax...\u201d</p> <p>I follow him, still thinking about why. And then I know. Makes me grin, imagining him using his gifts that way: My great passions? Why, Somalan ale, antique beaded tapestries, and white-maned Old Terran ponies. Yours, too? How astonishing! It\u2019s like we\u2019re soul mates...</p><p>March, you\u2019re such a bastard.</p><p>But I\u2019m smiling as I continue Hon\u2019s infinite tour.</p><p>They\u2019ve actually created a stable society, although they\u2019re short on women. If they got an influx from a failing colony somewhere, they\u2019d soon start filling up all the empty places on station. I wonder what kind of future Hon sees for his people, and yes, although we mock him quietly for his ego, he\u2019s carved out a small place in the universe that\u2019s unquestionably his own, not an easy undertaking. And it doesn\u2019t lessen the achievement that his fief is rusted, badly in need of repair, and smells of hydraulic fluid.</p><p>\u201cWhat you think?\u201d</p><p>And I\u2019m able to say truthfully, \u201cIt\u2019s a remarkable accomplishment.\u201d But to test my theory regarding his strange shift, I add, \u201cWell, I appreciate your time, but I\u2019d better get back to the ship.\u201d</p><p>He nods, his dark eyes inscrutable, and that\u2019s when I\u2019m sure something\u2019s wrong. Because he hasn\u2019t asked me what emergency demanded my attention earlier. I feel the weight of his gaze as I make my way to the lift, trying not to break into a dead run while he watches me. I\u2019ve never been very good at cat and mouse.</p><p>As soon as I\u2019m out of sight, I sprint, and by the time I reach the docking bay, I have to press my hand against my side to try to soothe the stitch. I don\u2019t need to locate the remote, though. The boarding ramp descends as I approach the Folly.</p> <p>Great, someone\u2019s been watching for me.</p><p>I\u2019d lay odds as to whom, but I don\u2019t have the creds to back up my guess, so I simply dash up the loading ramp, make a hard right, and continue into the hub, where I startle the shit out of everyone but March. His dark eyes look like I\u2019ve stolen something from him by creeping out as if he\u2019s my dirty little secret, but I can\u2019t worry about that now.</p><p>\u201cDina, did you get the supplies yet?\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head. \u201cStill assembling stuff to trade for the base organic to power the kitchen-mate. It\u2019s hard knowing what they\u2019re going to want. They don\u2019t seem to lack for anything, which is interesting, given their isolation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHon said they make trade runs to other outposts in the Outskirts, in addition to hijacking Corp freighters.\u201d How that information helps us, I don\u2019t know.</p><p>\u201cWe have enough nutri-paste to make it to Gehenna,\u201d Loras offers. \u201cWe can restock there if we must.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, that\u2019s a bright side.</p><p>At least Loras isn\u2019t mad at me anymore. We\u2019re back to the lukewarm efficiency he offers me and everyone else. I wish I had a clue what makes him tick, but there\u2019s no time for that, either.</p><p>\u201cWherever we go, we need to get out of here. Like ten minutes ago.\u201d</p><p>March finally speaks. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Jax?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m going to sound like I\u2019m crazy.</p><p>\u201cI...don\u2019t know,\u201d I mutter finally. \u201cSomething.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you think that?\u201d There\u2019s no hint of the lover who held my hips and kissed me like he\u2019d never tasted anything better in his life. I\u2019m grateful for his discretion; I truly am. He must\u2019ve written it off, as I have, as an interlude that should never be repeated. So I guess the awkwardness I feared will never emerge since we\u2019re pretending it didn\u2019t happen.</p><p>\u201cWell. Hon\u2019s being too cooperative...it\u2019s like he\u2019s stalling us.\u201d</p><p>March raises a brow. \u201cAnything else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell. He doesn\u2019t want to sleep with me anymore.\u201d</p><p>Dina can\u2019t be expected to pass up an opening like that, and of course, she doesn\u2019t. \u201cI\u2019d think you would be used to that by now, Jax.\u201d</p><p>They think I don\u2019t notice when March and Saul trade looks. I know what they\u2019re thinking\u2014this is more manifestation of my paranoia. I\u2019m flipping out here, just like I did when I thought March intended to kill me on Marakeq. And it\u2019s hard to believe they\u2019re entirely wrong. Maybe I have no intuition anymore; maybe I am just crazy.</p><p>Maybe I belong in that cell where they had me on Perlas.</p><p>Once, that would\u2019ve drawn a look from March, maybe a whisper in my head, but there\u2019s only silence now, and that\u2019s exactly what I want. Right?</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s pretty thin evidence,\u201d Doc says gently. \u201cPerhaps you need some rest. Regardless, we can\u2019t leave right this minute. We need some supplies, and we still need to figure out what kind of gift we\u2019re going to offer Hon. He\u2019s shown remarkable forbearance in permitting us to consult freely with Canton.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s just it, exactly. Why would he do that? He hates March; I deduced that much before I knew why. If he\u2019s being kind to us, then he\u2019s fattening us for the kill. But they don\u2019t seem to see it, except possibly Dina, who\u2019s lost so much that she probably feels a certain amount of fatal acceptance about such things.</p><p>I don\u2019t need rest. Mary forefend, it took us three weeks to get here. All I did was rest. But I realize there\u2019s no way I\u2019m going to convince them, maybe not until it\u2019s too late. Anyhow, I may have screwed us all\u2014Farr emerges from medical, crooning to baby-Z in low croaks. Shit, I didn\u2019t know he was still on board.</p><p>It feels like every muscle in my body locks with tension, waiting for him to announce his intention to rush to Hon and confide my suspicions. Then again, he\u2019s not a stupid man, and if he says that, we won\u2019t let him leave. My own thoughts make me dizzy, the way they loop, and I almost decide Doc\u2019s right. I\u2019m incapable of thinking in a straightforward fashion anymore. There are too many monsters in my head.</p><p>Into the silence, Farr says, \u201cYou\u2019re right, and you\u2019ve got to take me with you. I\u2019ve been trapped for two turns, and I had all but resigned myself to the fact that I would die here. I didn\u2019t think anyone would come looking for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want to go with us?\u201d March asks, sounding cautious.</p><p>\u201cPlease. Hon will extend docking privileges to anyone who isn\u2019t Corp, but leaving...that\u2019s the thing. I\u2019m surprised he hasn\u2019t filled your ear with talk of eugenesis.\u201d Farr shakes his head and strokes baby-Z through the sling he\u2019s designed for carrying him. \u201cGive him time. He\u2019s especially pleased that you brought a couple of new women.\u201d</p><p>Dina arches a brow. \u201cWhy does that matter, apart from the obvious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNew breeding stock,\u201d Farr says softly. \u201cThey\u2019re doing something dreadful up on third deck. I\u2019ve only been there once, Hon doesn\u2019t know I know. I stole the access codes...\u201d The scholar shudders. \u201cYou\u2019d have to see it, and I\u2019m sure it\u2019s worse now.\u201d</p><p>Our chances of getting off this station without a fight just decreased exponentially.</p><p>CHAPTER 32</p><p>\u201cNo. Absolutely not.\u201d I shake my head for emphasis. We need to leave now, not go sneaking around the third floor. \u201cI\u2019m not going.\u201d</p><p>March shrugs. \u201cThen I\u2019ll go alone.\u201d</p><p>For this \u201creconnaissance\u201d mission\u2014although the chances he\u2019ll do no more than fact-find are slim\u2014the choices are an alien who can\u2019t fight, a geneticist who won\u2019t fight, a scholar who would piss his pants in a fight, and Dina, who\u2019s in charge of acquiring supplies. I\u2019m not sure whether she\u2019s planning to trade or steal them now, and I figure that\u2019s up to her. If she can swing it, though, I\u2019d prefer she rips Hon off.</p><p>And me. The others have decided to pretend he never came up with this mad notion, but I just can\u2019t. I follow him to the ramp leading down to the docking bay. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhy are you so determined to go? It doesn\u2019t even make sense.\u201d</p><p>He pauses then, but doesn\u2019t meet my eyes, hands clenching into fists. \u201cCall it atonement, but I can\u2019t walk away from people who need my help. I can\u2019t risk letting the monster loose again, so I have to be better, stronger, more...everything than anyone else. See, I don\u2019t get to be a callous son of bitch because I perfected it. I don\u2019t ask you to understand or to risk your life over this, so stay here. It\u2019s fine. If I\u2019m not back in two hours, get the fuck off station. The AI can handle it.\u201d</p><p>Though it\u2019s a bad idea on a thousand levels, I want to touch him. Brush the dark hair out of his eyes and lean my forehead against his chin. We\u2019re both so fucking broken that I understand our strange attraction, a push-pull magnetism born of similar scars.</p><p>It\u2019s a foregone conclusion that I wind up heading back with March. I can\u2019t let him die alone, the unsung hero. I don\u2019t know what he thinks he can do up there, but I\u2019ve got his back regardless.</p> <p>I can\u2019t help wondering about the broken jumpers Hon admitted to kidnapping. Who else has he taken and why? I feel the pinch of an awakening conscience. Sometimes it\u2019s a pain in the ass traveling with a bona fide hero, not that I\u2019d have thought to use that sobriquet on March a short time ago. But it applies.</p><p>I wonder if he\u2019s going to bring up the way I left and brace myself for awkwardness. He\u2019s quiet as we make our way back on station. Wish Canton Farr had been able to tell us more about security, but he spent most of his time in the library, trying to look harmless. So most likely, they\u2019re tracking our movements via that door. But there\u2019s nothing we can do; it\u2019s the only way into Hon\u2019s Kingdom.</p><p>\u201cHe told me enough about his operations that I don\u2019t think he intends to let me leave,\u201d I volunteer.</p><p>\u201cJust figuring that out, Jax?\u201d His tone sounds like nothing, though, no mockery, no teasing, and there\u2019s an astonishing coldness in his neutrality. \u201cI told you not to mess with him. I\u2019ve known the man a long time.\u201d</p><p>My mouth quirks in what can\u2019t rightly be called a smile. \u201cI never claimed my brain is my strong point, apart from the J-gene.\u201d</p> <p>I offer the opening, so I expect a standard March slam, but instead he falls silent. We pass through the throne room, eerily empty, even though I know it\u2019s the middle of the sleep cycle. I feel like a little kid sneaking to the kitchen after hours to pinch some cookies, but we\u2019ll get a lot worse than a warm bum if we\u2019re caught.</p><p>As we reach the library, he says, \u201cGo on. Test the codes Farr gave us and see if you can use them to access complete schematics for the station.\u201d</p><p>When I do, the archives immediately unlock and the sys-term says, \u201cWelcome back, Canton Farr.\u201d</p><p>It takes a moment, but I\u2019m able to find the original layout and design. Without looking at March, I activate PA-245 and invite it to translate the data to its data banks via scan. The slim beam flickers over the screen as I pull each one up. I also snitch info about DuPont Station\u2019s initial weapon systems to give us an idea what might be shooting at us when we make a run for it.</p><p>\u201cCompile the separate images into a single three-dimensional map, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCertainly, Sirantha Jax.\u201d</p> <p>That tears it. We have to take Farr with us, as it\u2019s inevitable this terminal will show what records he accessed recently. A man like Hon will place only one interpretation on such research\u2014the correct one\u2014and take steps accordingly.</p><p>PA-245 presents me a nice map of the facility, and I study it for a moment. March seems uncharacteristically passive, or maybe he\u2019s just distracted. Eventually, he comes over, peering at the clamshell terminal before saying, \u201cThe lift isn\u2019t the only way up there. We should access the maintenance shafts via the ventilation ducts.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d like to protest. Crawling about in dark, dusty ducts isn\u2019t something I want to do, but going straight to the third deck in plain sight seems too foolhardy, even for me. There\u2019s direct access to the maintenance tunnels, of course, but we don\u2019t have door codes. We\u2019re not authorized repair personnel. If we knew where they lived, March might be able to get the codes as he\u2019d done on Perlas, but that just increases our risk of discovery for no guaranteed gain.</p><p>Sighing, I nod and indicate a spot on the display. \u201cWe can access it through a panel here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go. With luck, Dina will have supplies on board by the time we finish up.\u201d</p><p>I follow him, and we retrace our steps, where I half expect to find Hon sprawled on his barbwire throne. But the room\u2019s still empty, and March leads the way over to the far wall, behind the table where the rovers were playing Charm, and drops to one knee. He tinkers with the catch, and it snaps open.</p><p>\u201cLadies first,\u201d he tells me, polite as a banker.</p><p>Yeah, sleeping with him was definitely a mistake. I miss him giving me shit, even the way we bickered. Now there\u2019s just this silence in which everything dies. But I know what\u2019s expected of me, so I crawl into the vent, where it is, not surprisingly, dark and dusty. My PA gives off a faint glow, enough for me to read the map and orient myself. Thank Mary, it\u2019s not dark enough to trigger a flashback.</p> <p>\u201cI guess we might as well get going. We have a lot of crawling to do before we reach the maintenance shafts.\u201d</p><p>That turns out to be an understatement. My knees are sore and my shoulders aching by the time we reach the hatch where we\u2019ll emerge in the tunnels. The station\u2019s riddled with them like honeycomb, permitting repairs to otherwise-impossible-to-reach pylons. I wonder how long it\u2019s been since anyone ran a safety check, though.</p><p>We\u2019re making for a ladder that will take us to the third deck maintenance tunnels. From there we\u2019ll backtrack to the vents and come out...who knows where? Or what we\u2019ll find. This time, March takes the lead, scanning side to side like he thinks there might be mines. Can he find or disarm them if there are?</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he answers without looking at me. \u201cStay behind me, at least three meters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really think they\u2019d do that? Don\u2019t repairmen come in here?\u201d</p><p>He spares me a single glance. \u201cI think we\u2019re somewhere we\u2019re not supposed to be, Jax. There may be security measures in place that we\u2019re supposed to know how to circumvent. And I prefer to be a bit careful. Now get behind me.\u201d</p><p>Bitching beneath my breath, I fall in, six paces back like a good, submissive Somalan wife. Part of me thinks he\u2019s enjoying this, and I feel cheated. I composed a speech mentally, dammit. I was going to tell him it was fantastic, but that it couldn\u2019t be repeated. March couldn\u2019t make it clearer that he doesn\u2019t want to talk about it, though. Shit, maybe if I brought it up, he\u2019d read me my own speech. I scowl at his back, disgruntled.</p><p>March kneels then, running his fingertips over the welded metal seam between wall and floor, then higher. A red light higher up the wall flares in the gloom, then winks out. I tense, waiting for something worse, but March rises and wipes his hands on his thighs.</p><p>\u201cA series of pressure plates all the way down,\u201d he says. \u201cIf they\u2019re triggered without someone inputting the disarming sequence...\u201d Well, he doesn\u2019t really need to articulate it. \u201cInteresting thing is, I don\u2019t think Hon installed them. This technology is older than that, more integral to the station.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t imagine how long it took to build this place; it\u2019s a relic, older than any other outpost in the Outskirts. But I\u2019m not sure what this information means. \u201cThis was a Corp station, wasn\u2019t it? Before they decommed it and removed the last personnel when the star routes changed.\u201d</p><p>March nods, and I think I see the flicker of a smile, although it\u2019s pretty dim. \u201cSo what does that mean, Jax?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh no.\u201d I shake my head. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to get me to entertain you with another conspiracy rant. Don\u2019t think I didn\u2019t see how you and Doc looked at each other over my head on the Folly. Fragging patronizing, the lot of you, and I turned out to be right, even if I sounded crazy! You owe me an apology.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d he says quietly. \u201cBut you\u2019re not getting it right at this moment. Let\u2019s go play hero.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t we play master and slave girl instead?\u201d It\u2019s a joke, but I flinch as the words come out. Mary, do I have a big mouth.</p><p>I can feel the heat of his eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t think so. Come on.\u201d</p><p>As I start up the ladder behind him, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever felt like such an asshole.</p><p>CHAPTER 33</p><p>I know something\u2019s wrong the minute we crawl out of the vent.</p><p>The rest of the station looks like a pawnshop off Gehenna\u2019s pusher promenade, but the third deck, which everyone but Farr has been so careful to tell us isn\u2019t in use, well, it\u2019s like the disparity between the outside of the Folly and the gleaming well-kept interior. This level shines. Everything looks brand-new; it\u2019s a secure lab, and we\u2019ve emerged in the middle of a hallway.</p><p>It\u2019s almost too bright after the gloom in the ducts. I\u2019ve probably got something weird growing in my lungs now from breathing that air, some parasite that will eventually kill me, but what the hell, it was for a good cause, right? I wish I believed that.</p><p>Really, I\u2019m testing March with these thoughts now and then. Waiting for his sarcasm, waiting for him to bitch at me and tell me I\u2019m depressing. Something. Anything. But either he\u2019s not listening, or I just don\u2019t have the power to provoke him anymore. Why the hell does that bother me?</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re fragging nuts, Jax.\u201d He gives me a ghost of a smile as he says it. \u201cI thought you wanted me to stay out of your head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince when does what I want matter? If the universe gave a shit about that, I\u2019d be sitting in a caf\u00e9 on Venice Minor, sucking on some choclaste nosh and admiring the working boys.\u201d</p><p>I take a minute to imagine that. Mmm. Given the choice, I prefer the slim, pretty ones, golden skinned, without a lot of body hair.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re truly an enlightened soul, aren\u2019t you?\u201d March shakes his head, setting off toward a set of double doors at the end of the hall. The red lights that encircle it serve as an effective warning as far as I\u2019m concerned, but March won\u2019t be deterred. \u201cCome on.\u201d</p><p>Neither of us doubts Very Bad Things lie beyond this door, but there\u2019s a meter of solid titanium between us and...whatever. Mind, I\u2019d be happy to turn around right now, but I know March. We\u2019re not leaving until he\u2019s seen this thing through.</p><p>\u201cWhenever I follow you, we wind up in trouble,\u201d I point out.</p><p>\u201cHow is that different from what happens when you lead?\u201d</p><p>I sigh. \u201cAll right, genius, how do we get in? There are no guards for you to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me handle that.\u201d He withdraws a slim rectangle from his pocket, and I recognize it as a codebreaker, definitely black-market ware.</p><p>Slender silver filaments snake out from the device, gliding beneath the edges of the keypad to connect. I expect more animation, but it goes to work silently, and as it runs through numeric possibilities, the lights snap off around the door one by one. When all ten bulbs go dim, the door swishes open, leaving us looking into yet another hallway. I don\u2019t bother checking my PA; the map of the third deck is outdated, more than the other levels. According to those records, we\u2019re standing in an infirmary. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThis is really dumb,\u201d I mutter, as March sets off.</p><p>Presently we come to another security door, where he repeats the procedure. \u201cI hope there aren\u2019t many more of these. This thing only has one charge left.\u201d</p><p>That much I knew. Like most black-market wares, codebreakers are crafted with a finite number of uses, then they break down to base chemicals, leaving no hint as to their purpose. Maybe a really good chemist, analyzing the residue, would be able to posit a guess, but there\u2019s still no proof, and for most criminals, that\u2019s the important thing. For obvious reasons, possession of them is outlawed on every Corp world, and as far as I know, they can only be purchased on Gehenna.</p><p>We hurry onward, trying to be quiet, although skulking in a bright corridor with no cover looks even sillier than it sounds. As we pause at the next\u2014and hopefully last\u2014set of doors, I say, \u201cOne of these days you\u2019re going to stop surprising me.\u201d</p> <p>He gives me a saturnine smile. \u201cAnd when that day comes, Jax, I\u2019ll miss you.\u201d</p><p>Bastard. But I don\u2019t mean it. Very few people can keep up with me verbally, and I wouldn\u2019t trade March for someone nice. Well, I don\u2019t mean that like it sounds. March is a good man, just not a nice one. Does that even make sense?</p><p>While I\u2019m pondering, he gets to work, and the door whispers open. Even before I step around the corner to see, my skin prickles with wrongness. Yes, this is the place Farr warned us about, where they\u2019re doing dreadful things. I step into the room without waiting for March, scarcely able to take it in.</p><p>At first glance it looks like a med ward or possibly a morgue, so many rows of bodies, lying pale and quiet. The only sound besides our breathing comes from the low hum of the machines keeping them alive. And that\u2019s not even the worst part.</p><p>\u201cMother Mary,\u201d March breathes, coming to stand beside me. \u201cThey\u2019re\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHelping populate the station,\u201d a voice says from behind us. \u201cWe\u2019re growing only girl children right now. There are so many men waiting.\u201d</p><p>Shit. We\u2019ve been had.</p><p>I turn to find Farr leveling a disruptor on us. Either one of us makes a sudden move, our molecules are going to find themselves painfully rearranged. And that\u2019s really not good for breathing and circulation.</p><p>\u201cCanton,\u201d I drawl. \u201cWhat an unexpected pleasure. Decided you don\u2019t want a ride off station anymore?\u201d</p><p>As if he ever did. The last piece of the puzzle falls into place. Hon doesn\u2019t possess the scientific expertise to execute this plan by himself. My stomach roils, seeing how they\u2019re using these poor women as nothing but wombs. I\u2019m afraid to speculate just how insemination takes place.</p><p>\u201cYes, I was rather proud of that performance. I had to think fast. But why would I? I can\u2019t study in the field anymore...my lungs were damaged on Marakeq, and I have a sweet setup here. Hon trusts me to take care of business, I\u2019m his right-hand man.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhere did you find all these women?\u201d March asks. His hands furl into fists at his sides, and it doesn\u2019t take a specialist to read his body language.</p><p>\u201cMed wards mostly, sometimes Psych. You\u2019d be surprised how many throwaways there are, forgotten by friends and family.\u201d Farr shakes his head in what appears to be sincere regret, and I have to conclude he\u2019s just about the craziest bastard I ever met. He thinks it\u2019s too bad these poor women wound up like that but doesn\u2019t see anything wrong with this? \u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d he adds, seeming to misread my look. \u201cWe test for genetic anomalies, and I\u2019m keeping careful record so we don\u2019t wind up inbreeding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank Mary for that,\u201d I mumble, but Farr is immune to sarcasm. \u201cYou\u2019re behind the biomechanical work on Hon\u2019s jumpers, too, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>He smiles, like we\u2019re having a friendly conversation, and if it weren\u2019t for the weapon in his hands, I might even believe it. \u201cYes, they\u2019re kept in a separate area, as it\u2019s a different project. Our goal is complete self-sufficiency, a settlement free of Corp influence, free from artificial cred-based commerce.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happens if one of these women wakes up?\u201d March edges closer to the scientist by millimeters.</p><p>\u201cOh, they never do,\u201d Farr answers, and I can picture him smiling as he slides the spike behind their eyes, crooning, This is for the best. \u201cAnd no one ever leaves Hon-Durren\u2019s Kingdom. Afraid there\u2019s no place for you here, March. Hon simply doesn\u2019t like you. We\u2019re keeping the women. Jax, after reviewing your Corp record, I don\u2019t trust you to be docile on your own, and you appear resistant to mental conditioning. The blonde\u2019s a mechanic, yes? We can use her expertise. The other two from your crew can join the rovers. I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll all adapt...and if necessary, I can assist with that.\u201d</p><p>Shit, why didn\u2019t I see it sooner? He\u2019s just like the Unit Psych, Newel.</p><p>After a brief pause, as if thinking things over, March asks, low, \u201cWill you take care of baby-Z for me, at least?\u201d</p> <p>No. Oh no. I find myself begging silently, Don\u2019t you dare leave me, March. Don\u2019t you dare. But there\u2019s nothing but my own thoughts, nothing to indicate he heard me.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Farr says kindly. \u201cI have him right here in fact.\u201d With his free hand he opens up his shirt and Z pokes his head out the top.</p><p>\u201cGrrr-upp.\u201d For some reason, Z only chats if he can see someone to talk to. With his head covered up, he seems to assume nobody\u2019s around.</p><p>Fantastic. Now we\u2019re crippled because we need to be careful with the baby. Just when I don\u2019t think the situation can get any worse, March dives for the scientist\u2019s legs. Farr\u2019s faster than I\u2019d have guessed, though, and he fires\u2014blinding flash, so I hit the deck instinctively.</p><p>When my pupils adapt, I see March crumpled at Farr\u2019s feet.</p><p>CHAPTER 34</p><p>I\u2019ve only got one shot at this.</p><p>As Farr levels the disruptor on me, a smug smile building, he says, \u201cYou want to join your lover, Jax? Just how deep does that devotion go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrag you. Where\u2019s Hon? Does he know you\u2019re doing this?\u201d</p><p>His look shifts from self-satisfied to irritated. \u201cLike I told you, he trusts me to take care of business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bet he\u2019s going to be pissed that you robbed him of the opportunity to take March one-on-one. How\u2019s he supposed to command respect from the rovers if he lets a weakling like you do his dirty work?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m flat on the floor, gazing up at him. If looks could kill, he\u2019d be a sizzling pile of meat, but sadly, he just stands there. I can\u2019t look at March again; his left arm\u2019s a mangled, bloody mass of displaced molecules. And he\u2019s so still. Mary help me, I truly am poison. Part of me wonders whether Simon\u2019s still alive, and if so, how he\u2019s escaped the violent death that comes to all men who sleep with me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a weakling,\u201d he responds tightly.</p><p>Good, I\u2019m making him mad. That increases the probability he\u2019ll get careless. I\u2019m neither brave nor heroic, but I\u2019m not dying here. If I can get that disruptor out of his hands, I\u2019ll kick his ass, but I can\u2019t underestimate him. He may be slight, but he\u2019s fast, or he wouldn\u2019t have been able to drop March. And he\u2019s going to die for that, swear to Mary.</p><p>As I\u2019m trying to decide on the best strategy, I see movement, a shadow thrown by someone coming down the hall. Farr notices my shift of focus, but he thinks he\u2019s too smart to fall for that. \u201cOh, there\u2019s someone behind me, is that it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually there is,\u201d Loras says, stepping into view.</p><p>The scientist spins, and I launch myself at his ankles and yank. He tumbles back, hits hard, and the disruptor goes flying. I don\u2019t know what the hell Loras is doing here, but both Farr and I scramble for the weapon. Since he\u2019s about a meter behind me, he gets a kick across the chin as I roll and come up with it in both hands.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s not be hasty,\u201d Farr says, placating. He tries to smile, and his teeth show smears of blood.</p><p>But all I can see is March lying behind him. I fire in reply, a chest shot, and then I stand for a moment just listening to him scream. His heart pulses sickly trying to pump for a few beats before it bursts, spattering blood all over the white lab floor. Loras looks like he\u2019s going to heave.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn right,\u201d I snap. \u201cIt\u2019s us or them. Remind me to ask you later what you\u2019re doing here. For now, we\u2019ve got to get the frag out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about them?\u201d He nods toward the pale, gravid row of women, bound to machines that do their living for them. \u201cWhat about their young? What will life be like, born to serve the raiders?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, but I draw the line at killing unborn babies. We can\u2019t save the world,\u201d I tell him wearily. \u201cAll we can do is save ourselves. Now let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>As we start toward the door, March groans.</p><p>\u201cHe isn\u2019t dead.\u201d Loras draws up short. \u201cHelp me, Jax. We can\u2019t leave him.\u201d</p><p>I pause, weighing our options. When I hesitate too long, Loras adds, \u201cJax!\u201d like I\u2019ve let him down somehow.</p><p>\u201cShit. Okay. Okay. I\u2019ve got his left side.\u201d</p><p>My whole body cringes as the malformed meat that used to be March\u2019s left arm drops round my shoulder. He\u2019s so heavy. Between Loras and me, I don\u2019t know how the hell we can manage this. Not with all those raiders gunning for us.</p><p>But we have to try.</p><p>\u201cI came up the lift,\u201d Loras says. \u201cBest we go back that way. I don\u2019t think we can manage all the crawling.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s quite an understatement. This way, we increase our risk of discovery, but it can\u2019t be helped. We limp along like that old joke, retarded man winning the three-legged race. Loras seems to know when the patrols pass, so we pause around corners and wait, clamping a hand over March\u2019s mouth when he moans. Give us away.</p><p>My heart sounds like a tribal drum in my ears as we finally hit the lift and\u2014</p><p>\u201cWait, how the hell did you get the codes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told the guard that Farr wanted me for a special procedure,\u201d he answers quietly. \u201cI knew something was wrong when he left. If he truly wanted to accompany us, he should\u2019ve stayed aboard, fingers crossed for your quick return.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit, that\u2019s clever,\u201d I say admiringly, as we step out onto the first deck. Now we just need to get to the docking bay. But here\u2019s the guard who let Loras go up, likely thinking he\u2019d never come down again.</p><p>No hesitation\u2014I fire, another chest shot, but I\u2019m not fast enough to keep him from sounding the alarm before he starts screaming. More blood sprays out, a crimson fan over the guard station. I feel Loras looking at me with abject horror, but we need to keep moving. As the rovers respond to the alert, we\u2019re going to face more and more security. Time\u2019s the enemy now, along with about two hundred raiders who love nothing better than a fight.</p><p>Just need to clear the corridors, the throne room, and the last stretch to the hangar. Come on, March, we need you awake. As we take off at gimp speed, my shoulders burn beneath his weight, so I give him a little shake, hoping pain may do the trick. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShit,\u201d March growls, finally stumbling with some volition. He takes a little of his weight off us. \u201cWhere\u2019s baby-Z?\u201d</p><p>Mary forgive me. I think I killed him. Inexplicably that hurts worse than anything that\u2019s happened so far. I feel the hot burn behind my eyes. Forget Farr, I\u2019m the monster. But I wasn\u2019t thinking of anything but seeing him die.</p><p>\u201cNo time for that, stay with us. We\u2019re almost to the Folly. Just a little farther.\u201d</p><p>We\u2019re stumbling now, even with March half-conscious. Past the throne room, we can do this. We\u2019re almost there. But neither I nor Loras is particularly strong. Loras is smart, and I\u2019m fast, but that\u2019s not helping us now. What I wouldn\u2019t give for Doc\u2019s burly back. He could probably heft March over his shoulder and go at a dead run. I hear booted feet behind us, and the Klaxons blaring remind me of Perlas Station.</p> <p>Of course they do, this is a former Corp installation.</p><p>And they\u2019re going into lockdown.</p><p>No. Oh no.</p><p>I start to run, seeing the doors in the room that used to be the docking authority closing slowly. We need more speed, and it\u2019s all I can do not to shake free of them, sprint for all I\u2019m worth. They\u2019re dragging me down, and right now I don\u2019t care whether they live or die. I\u2019m not a fragging hero...I didn\u2019t ask for this, dammit, I shouldn\u2019t have to choose.</p><p>\u201cCome on, you bastards.\u201d I\u2019m sobbing as I try to pull March along, and we make it, bent double, beneath the first set of doors.</p> <p>But I don\u2019t see how we can make the second set across the room. Still, I\u2019m not giving up. I dig my fingers into his mangled forearm and rouse a scream of rage, of pain, but it doesn\u2019t have the desired result. Instead of goading him to speed, his knees buckle, and we all go down just before the second door.</p><p>I slither beneath on my belly; there\u2019s less than a meter of space now. In that moment I\u2019m sure I\u2019m the only one who\u2019s going to make it back to the Folly, but then I see Loras shoving March toward me. There\u2019s a terrible acceptance in his eyes as I reach for March and haul him forward.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Loras whispers, as March\u2019s boot clears the gap. \u201cYou gave me the power to choose.\u201d</p><p>The door clangs shut.</p><p>I feel tears streaming down my face, hot as blood. Part of me wants to stand here screaming, shoot the door with my disruptor, but I don\u2019t know what it does to metal, if anything, and I can\u2019t bring myself to waste the chance he\u2019s bought us. I refuse to listen to him die.</p><p>\u201cWake up!\u201d I slap March as hard as I can, and he groans, trying to push upright. The bastard seems surprised when his left arm won\u2019t hold his weight. \u201cGet your ass up. I am not leaving you, not after all this. Come on.\u201d</p> <p>He doesn\u2019t even seem to know who the hell I am, but I get him on his feet. Just this last corridor now, and I don\u2019t know how the hell we\u2019re going to get through the docking bay doors. I doubt they\u2019ll open for us anymore, but\u2014</p><p>There\u2019s a smoking hole where the door used to be, Dina standing there with a smile. \u201cYou two done sight\u2014oh shit, is March...\u201d She trails off, because obviously he\u2019s not, and the turrets in the docking bay are coming alive. \u201cWhere\u2019s Loras?\u201d</p><p>I just shake my head, and she gets under his right side. \u201cHead down now, it\u2019s going to be a shitty run.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 35</p><p>March is never going to be able to fly.</p><p>Doc\u2019s sedated him since the shock might kill him, and he\u2019s tending to the arm as best he can, but we need a real medical facility for proper treatment. He\u2019ll wrap it, get him started on a full series of preventives, and that\u2019s about all we can do. Saul will need to keep an eye on him, though, so that just leaves Dina and me.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d she says grimly. \u201cOne of us needs to man the guns, the other needs to get us out of here. I\u2019m usually in the pit, you ever pilot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell no. But I\u2019ve never been on guns before, either, so get back there. Cripple every ship in this docking bay, then blow the doors wide open. These aren\u2019t the only ships on station, but maybe it\u2019ll slow them down some.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, boss.\u201d She sprints for the gun pit, and the funny thing is, she didn\u2019t sound mocking when she said it.</p><p>I get my ass to the cockpit, and as I strap into the pilot\u2019s chair, I can\u2019t help thinking how wrong it feels. I\u2019ve never sat over here on the left side, but I think I remember enough of that last time with March. Maybe I can figure this out.</p><p>I tap a series of panels from memory and feel vaguely surprised as the Folly powers up. It\u2019s not that I know what I\u2019m doing, quite the contrary. I\u2019m just seeing in my mind\u2019s eye how March does this. So far so good, the panels and switches seem oddly familiar. I remember how I thought, I could almost fly this ship myself, during our last jump. I need to stop doing that, because such mental boasts have an uncomfortable way of coming back to bite me in the ass.</p><p>This must be vertical movement...so this one is horizontal.</p><p>As I skate my fingers across the second bar, the vessel jerks hard and slings sideways, careening us into the far wall. Shit, this thing is really sensitive. I try to turn it, and it spins back, and soon we\u2019re just spinning wildly in the hangar, slamming into the ships Dina is supposed to be shooting. The Folly takes damage as we\u2019re whirling; I hear the steady barrage of hits along the hull.</p><p>\u201cHold this thing steady, dammit. I got no shot,\u201d she growls at me over the comm.</p><p>So I stop touching the controls for a minute, and I hear the roar of our turrets firing on the docked ships. Muted explosions tell me she\u2019s getting the job done. Now I just need to turn so we can get out of here.</p><p>We spin three times before I finally steady the Folly long enough for Dina to blow the bay doors, then we\u2019re out, although it\u2019s not in a graceful swoop like March executes. Instead, I bang around the exit, wincing at the painful sound of metal scraping along metal, but then we depart Hon-Durren\u2019s Kingdom. Finally.</p><p>With incalculable losses.</p><p>The comm crackles, and Dina\u2019s voice comes across with a mocking lilt: \u201cJax, as a pilot, you\u2019re a great jumper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah.\u201d I flick the switch on her. \u201cComputer, autopilot on, set course for Gehenna, maximum cruising speed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAcknowledged,\u201d the computer tells me cheerfully. \u201cAt our current speed, we will make port in approximately thirty-six standard hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlert me if there\u2019s any sign of pursuit or other problems,\u201d I say tiredly, unbuckling from the pilot\u2019s chair.</p><p>\u201cAcknowledged.\u201d</p><p>I hope I never have to do this again. March usually stays up here awhile to monitor our course, but I need to check on how he\u2019s doing, talk to Doc, then get this blood off me. Rolling my shoulders, I head for medical. Not until this moment did I realize just how sore I am, but I feel like I\u2019ve been beaten.</p><p>When I peek around the door frame, I see that Doc has sprayed March\u2019s arm in some liquid skin to keep out bacteria. I\u2019ve never seen anyone shot by a disruptor before. They never perfected molecular transportation, but naturally, the Corp capitalized on the failed prototypes, turning them into a weapon that turns flesh inside out. Whoever invented that weapon was a sick son of a bitch.</p><p>Of course, I\u2019ve killed with it twice, so what does that make me?</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s he doing?\u201d</p><p>Doc looks up from the life-sign readings with a creased brow. \u201cHe\u2019s strong, sound constitution, so that\u2019ll help. The fact that you got him back alive is pretty impressive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was Loras, not me. He deserves all the credit.\u201d For a moment I think I might break down, tears simmering in my eyes. Sometimes you find your heroes in the unlikeliest places. Wish I\u2019d known him better. Wish\u2014</p><p>So many things.</p><p>Doc regards me as if he knows there\u2019s something I\u2019m not saying. \u201cMarch is in a lot of pain, though. Kindest thing we can do is keep him sedated until we reach Gehenna. I have some contacts at a clinic near the starport. They\u2019ll help us out without asking any inconvenient questions.\u201d</p><p>That hurts, too. If I\u2019d done something differently...After a moment, I lock everything down, push it back into the compartment where wounded Jax lives. I\u2019m the pragmatic Jax. \u201cYou can keep him nourished and hydrated?\u201d</p><p>Saul sighs. \u201cThat\u2019s about all I can do with a wound like this, but yes, I can. What happened, Jax?\u201d</p><p>I turn to see Dina standing in the doorway, waiting to hear the answer. Her eyes as she gazes down at March, so pale and still, almost like he\u2019s already dead, well, it\u2019s the look of someone who thought she\u2019d lost everything, only to find more could still be taken from her. And I feel like I\u2019m the harbinger of it all, although I didn\u2019t even want to go up to the lab. That was all March. But it doesn\u2019t seem to matter anymore. I was there, wasn\u2019t I? And everything I touch goes bad\u2014just like that dead Gunnar said.</p><p>Taking a deep breath, I tell them. I don\u2019t spare a single detail, and I certainly don\u2019t paint myself in a better light. It doesn\u2019t matter if they hate me, couldn\u2019t be worse than how I hate myself.</p><p>But when Dina says softly, \u201cIt wasn\u2019t your fault, Jax,\u201d I almost fall down.</p><p>In fact, I have to sit down on one of the stools up against the wall, regarding her with incredulity. \u201cYou can\u2019t stand me. How can you say that?\u201d</p><p>She shrugs. \u201cYes, you\u2019re a bitch for even thinking about leaving March behind, but you didn\u2019t, did you? It\u2019s not your fault he got shot. And it\u2019s not your fault that Farr was a crazy fuck. And it\u2019s not your fault that March wanted to go see if anyone up there needed help. That\u2019s just...March. And it definitely wasn\u2019t your fault that Loras didn\u2019t make it. He made a choice, Jax. And you gave him that power. I think when it came down to it, he wanted to die a free man, he wanted it to mean something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou spoke to him about my shinai-solution, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>She nods. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t have worked. He was touched you cared enough to put that much thought into it, though. And when he decided to go after you two, Doc and I respected his choice.\u201d</p><p>Even though we knew something could go wrong. Though I hear the unspoken words, they don\u2019t help much.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s right, you know.\u201d Saul turns from his examination of March\u2019s vital signs long enough to give me a solemn nod.</p><p>\u201cAnd nobody who wasn\u2019t there can say for sure whether they\u2019d have been thinking about what was under Farr\u2019s shirt,\u201d Dina continues, like she\u2019s determined to make me feel better. \u201cIf it was me, seeing my friend on the floor, I\u2019d want the blood of the bastard who killed him, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is a tragedy that we lost Loras and baby-Z,\u201d Doc adds. \u201cFortunately, I have ten good DNA samples, so it\u2019s not a complete loss as far as the project is concerned. I took them when I was sure he was strong enough to bear it, shortly before we reached Hon-Durren\u2019s Kingdom.\u201d</p><p>The project.</p><p>Sometimes I think Doc\u2019s as crazy as Canton Farr. Maybe all scientists are. They don\u2019t care who has to die for them to test a theory. They lose sight of the important things; they spend so much time looking at cells that they forget those units are the building blocks of sentient beings who have thoughts and hopes, dreams and feelings. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Examining the cost objectively, I\u2019m not sure I believe in this project anymore. With the bodies piling up in our wake\u2014Jor, Mair, so many Gunnars, Loras, baby-Z\u2014I don\u2019t think I can justify continuing this course. I can\u2019t imagine that it\u2019s worth it.</p><p>So what if the Corp continues to dominate jump-travel, so what if they own all interstellar commerce and travel? They always have\u2014status quo.</p><p>But before I can tell them that I\u2019m out, I don\u2019t want to do this anymore, the computer advises us, \u201cI have detected two ships on intersect course, Sirantha Jax. Since they have powered up their weapon systems, I believe their intentions may be hostile.\u201d</p><p>And maybe I\u2019m bad juju, dark luck.</p> <p>CHAPTER 36</p><p>Dina scrambles for the gun pit.</p><p>I figure if March were awake, he\u2019d be in the cockpit, so that\u2019s where I head, even though I know perfectly well we\u2019re better off on autopilot. At least the computer will continue to move us in the direction of Gehenna. Based on my performance getting us off station, the same cannot be said of me.</p><p>Regardless, as a good proxy, I take my place in the pilot\u2019s chair, even though I\u2019ve got no clue what I\u2019m supposed to do. I peer at various screens and panels until I get visual on the two ships. At this distance I can\u2019t tell where they hail from, but I\u2019m willing to bet they\u2019ve been sent from the kingdom formerly known as DuPont Station.</p><p>\u201cCan you take evasive action?\u201d I ask the computer.</p> <p>\u201cThe autopilot is programmed with the standard S-68 dodge and 410 spiral. Please state your preference.\u201d</p><p>Shit, I have no damn idea.</p><p>I tap the comm, hoping she won\u2019t laugh at me. \u201cDina, what\u2019s the difference between the S-68 dodge and a 410 spiral?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>I get the feeling that encapsulates her knowledge on the subject. \u201cNever mind. All weapons online?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAffirmative,\u201d she comes back. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be in range soon. Get the shields up if you haven\u2019t already.\u201d</p> <p>Double shit.</p><p>\u201cComputer, enable S-68 dodge with autocorrection based on trajectory of incoming enemy fire,\u201d I say, hoping that\u2019s possible.</p><p>Hoping it makes sense and the computer won\u2019t argue with me or call me an idiot. I certainly feel like one.</p><p>\u201cAcknowledged. At current cruising speed, the pursuing vessels will overtake us in approximately five minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShields online, extra power to aft section.\u201d That\u2019s where Doc and March are, and I don\u2019t want a hull breach back there.</p><p>The computer objects, \u201cInsufficient energy, Sirantha Jax.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReroute power from secondary systems. I want stronger shields aft,\u201d I insist.</p><p>Maybe that\u2019s not the right thing to do, but I\u2019m not trained for this. I\u2019m not a pilot and certainly not one seasoned in space combat. Apart from the time I\u2019ve been on the Folly, I\u2019ve never had ship guns fired at me. I was Corp, for frag\u2019s sake\u2014people rolled out the red carpet for Kai and me. How am I supposed to know this shit?</p> <p>And the computer starts beeping and humming, hopefully doing as I ask. Don\u2019t know what I\u2019ll do if it doesn\u2019t because I\u2019m not March. I can\u2019t program this by hand. I just hope my best is good enough up here.</p><p>After a moment, it announces, \u201cAll shields online, aft operating at one hundred thirty-five percent. Is that satisfactory?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s really all I can do. So I cross my fingers and wait.</p><p>I feel the ship shudder as we take the first hit, but the shields seem to hold. And then the Folly begins what could only be standard dodge pattern S-68. Maybe the other pilots aren\u2019t academy trained so they won\u2019t recognize it. It\u2019s oddly silent, except for the odd jolt where they score a hit.</p><p>The comm crackles: \u201cWhat the hell are you doing up there, Jax? We\u2019re slinging around like an old woman dancing drunk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s called evasive action,\u201d I grumble. \u201cJust shut up and shoot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will if I can keep from puking.\u201d</p><p>But I see on-screen that she\u2019s got one of them. I hear nothing, but the ship crumbles into nothingness. It should be more dramatic, perhaps, but these are sleek, fast, one-man ships. Nothing else could\u2019ve caught us, and they don\u2019t quite have the durability they need to take us on. Maybe they thought two-on-one odds would do it, but they didn\u2019t take a close look at the way the Folly is outfitted, heavy shields, hard-core guns.</p><p>And then I feel another hard lurch, just before something explodes somewhere starboard. \u201cImminent engine failure,\u201d the computer tells me helpfully. \u201cImmediate maintenance required. Danger. Primary systems compromised. Immediate\u2014\u201d</p><p>I launch myself out of the pilot\u2019s chair. Shit. This pilot\u2019s smarter; he\u2019s not attempting to take us out by himself, just trying to cripple us. Leave us dead in space so that a larger vessel can catch up, then tow us wherever they want us.</p><p>There\u2019s no way I can repair those engines so let\u2019s hope I can figure out the guns. I don\u2019t know how to transfer controls to the cockpit, so I sprint for the gun pit, where Dina\u2019s already unbuckling. \u201cGet your ass in there and take him out,\u201d she tells me, running for the engine room.</p><p>The ship shudders again, and now the whole area is lit with flashing red light, as if the blaring noise wasn\u2019t enough to alert us to the fact we\u2019re in trouble. I look at the panel in panic, trying to figure out\u2014</p><p>Think I get it.</p><p>Inside the pit, I seem to spin as I tap the scope, and damn, Dina\u2019s right, this drunken lurch called dodge S-68 that we\u2019re running makes it hard as hell to target. But I mash the button, launching a volley toward the lighter ship. It swoops around us with a grace I can\u2019t help but envy with the autopilot driving and me on guns. If we make it out of this alive, it\u2019ll be a miracle.</p><p>I learn to spin the scope counter to our evasive maneuverings, and I can\u2019t help but shout when I hit the other ship. Just a glancing shot, didn\u2019t do any real damage, but it means I\u2019m getting the hang of this. Maybe I can take him out before he destroys our engines completely.</p><p>Two hands on the controls, spin and target, then let it go. Yes! I can see he\u2019s crippled now, having trouble. There\u2019s a distinct dip when he turns portside, so I focus there, continuing to fire. I\u2019m almost surprised when the other vessel seems to crumple, then there\u2019s a silent array of sparks. Now he\u2019s nothing but salvage.</p><p>I\u2019m surprised to find I\u2019m covered in a fine layer of sweat as I pull myself out of the gun pit. I already hurt from lugging March, and now every muscle throbs as if I\u2019ve taken these guys on in actual physical combat. No wonder Dina\u2019s so strong; she fragging has to be.</p><p>I stagger out to the hub and don\u2019t see anyone. Eventually, I locate Doc in the cockpit, as he took over giving the computer orders when I hit the turrets. We find Dina in the engine room, using mechanic\u2019s tools and voodoo magic to keep us moving.</p><p>\u201cHow bad is it?\u201d I ask, shoving the frizzy hair out of my eyes.</p><p>\u201cBad enough. This is just a workaround; we\u2019re not even running on main engines, and with what I had to do, the kitchen-mate isn\u2019t going to work, among other things. Enjoy your paste until we get to Gehenna.\u201d</p><p>If we get to Gehenna.</p><p>I\u2019m so fragging tired, I feel like I could sleep for a week. One thing\u2019s for sure, though, I need to learn some shit. Because this boast of not knowing anything but grimspace isn\u2019t a good thing, and it just may get me killed, sooner rather than later. It\u2019s not enough to be a good navigator; I\u2019m not a Corp celebrity anymore. I live in the real world now, like it or not, and that means expanding my repertoire.</p><p>I need to learn to pilot in case this happens again. I need to learn guns. I need to learn emergency maintenance. I need to learn\u2014</p><p>Shit. I\u2019m too tired to finish the list. But it\u2019s really long. Maybe it\u2019s to my credit that I\u2019ve realized as much.</p><p>\u201cIs March all right?\u201d I roll my shoulders. Think I pulled something.</p><p>Doc nods. \u201cI strapped him down before I went to the cockpit, but I should probably go check on him. I\u2019ll let you know if there\u2019s any change.\u201d</p><p>The old Jax would\u2019ve taken his word for that, but instead I follow him to medical because I want to see with my own eyes. March has taken on greater significance than I can parse at the moment. He\u2019s like the last hope I have, the last chance to prove I\u2019m not a living, breathing curse.</p><p>He\u2019s quiet and still, so fragging pale. It hurts me to see him like this, and for a moment my eyes sting because I can\u2019t make myself believe he\u2019ll ever wake up. I\u2019m glad I don\u2019t have to see the mangled meat of his left arm. Doc\u2019s got that wrapped, and a steady burst of painkillers keeping March quiet. His vitals do look good, though, from what I know of such things.</p><p>I forget Saul\u2019s standing there, as I step closer to the table. It seems wrong to leave him strapped, so I start unbuckling him. When I\u2019m done, I adjust the thin synth blanket, tucking it neatly around his waist. What I wouldn\u2019t give to have him wake up and tell me what a waste of space I am, chew me out over everything that\u2019s gone wrong.</p><p>But he\u2019s so fragging far away\u2014I can\u2019t feel him anymore. Can\u2019t help but press my palm to his cheek, feel the too-cool skin, and trace the line of his cheekbone. I\u2019ve lost so many people. Some I left on purpose and never looked back. Some were taken from me, and I never said good-bye.</p><p>March...he was supposed to be different, irascible but indestructible. As it turns out, he\u2019s flesh and blood like any other man. I drop my hand, nod at Doc, and leave Med Bay without speaking. I\u2019m so tired, all the way down to the bone. The old Jax would\u2019ve headed to quarters to shower and crash. She would\u2019ve figured she\u2019d done enough.</p><p>So I head for the engine room to begin my crash course in starship repair.</p><p>CHAPTER 37</p><p>We limp into port at Gehenna, not quite trailing smoke, but it\u2019s close.</p><p>Dina must\u2019ve used every trick in the book to keep the Folly running. We all know we can\u2019t afford another battle or another delay. It may have already been too long for March. I won\u2019t speak that fear aloud, though. I put my faith in primitive gods right now, where you can keep the bad magic at bay by refusing to acknowledge it.</p><p>They say you never forget your first glimpse of Gehenna. Over the tall buildings the sky swirls with orange and red, true titian, a feature of the unique atmosphere. Of course that same air would kill human beings; hence they built the entire city inside a dome. Eternal sunset, that\u2019s why the place is so wild. You know the feeling you get, just before full dark? Sundown makes you feel like the world burgeons with possibility, and that\u2019s Gehenna for you.</p><p>Like any other romantic notion, it\u2019s based on bullshit, of course. Gehenna isn\u2019t the land of eternal sunset and infinite potential. The gas in the atmosphere just makes it impossible to see the sun.</p><p>The whole place is a rich man\u2019s experiment, really. If Venice Minor is famed for luxury and natural beauty, then Gehenna is pure man-made vice. At the open markets near the space port, you can buy anything from exotic weapons to designer drugs to trained slaves. Twinkling marquee advertisements beg for our money and our time. This club boasts \u201cthe most beautiful girls in the galaxy\u201d and that one promises \u201cthe biggest jackpot ever, you\u2019ll break the bank,\u201d the one where a pair of enormous luminous dice seem to roll themselves, again and again. It\u2019s almost hypnotic. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I\u2019m positive my landing skills aren\u2019t up to this challenge. Getting into the port authority requires traversing a complex series of locks; it\u2019s a measure that ensures the air inside the dome\u2019s not compromised. So when the docking agent contacts us, asking for our itinerary, I answer, \u201cOur pilot is incapacitated, and we\u2019re coming in on auto. Can you transmit vectors?\u201d</p><p>She sounds irritated that I\u2019ve disrupted procedure. \u201cSvetlana\u2019s Folly, is this trip business or pleasure?\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t know which this qualifies as, so I reply, \u201cI repeat, our pilot is injured and in need of medical attention. This is an unscheduled stop.\u201d</p><p>That seems to appease her. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to hear that. We can bring you in safely if you accept the override.\u201d</p> <p>Oh Mary, I get a cold chill, just thinking of turning control of the Folly over to strangers. For a moment I flash on Matins IV, but then I give myself a mental shake. This isn\u2019t a Corp outpost. It\u2019s a private playground, a smuggler\u2019s paradise. That\u2019s why it was built in the Outskirts, and as far as I know, nobody here is trying to kill us.</p><p>Give them time.</p><p>So I tap the panel to accept the override, and they bring us through the landing sequence, smooth as s-silk. There\u2019s no way I could have managed all these turns, the precise stops and starts while we proceed through the locks to the hangar. Maybe our computer could\u2019ve handled it; I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m glad we don\u2019t have to find out.</p><p>As we come down the boarding ramp, an official waits for us. \u201cYou said you have injured on board?\u201d She\u2019s also outfitted in full hazard gear. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I need to check him to ensure you aren\u2019t carrying a contagious sickness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo right ahead,\u201d Doc says, stepping back from the sled.</p> <p>The dockmistress, or whatever the hell she is, runs a scan on March, head to toe, then nods, seeming satisfied. She pulls off her helmet, and I\u2019m surprised to find she\u2019s quite young. \u201cNote to log, merely an injury to an extremity, nothing infectious. Do you need transport?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be perfect if you can arrange it,\u201d I say.</p><p>I\u2019ve only been here once before. Kai and I rented a sporty little two-seater, but that\u2019s not going to get the job done. And in fact, he handled the details, so I wouldn\u2019t even know where to start.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see to it,\u201d the official says. \u201cI\u2019ll provide documentation for those traveling to the clinic with the patient. Here.\u201d She hands us an orange card. \u201cBut I do need someone to stay and fill out forms regarding your stay and, of course, pay the docking fee.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m about to volunteer when Dina says, \u201cI\u2019ll do it.\u201d At my look, she shrugs. \u201cI hate hospitals. No offense, Doc.\u201d But I can read the look she gives our helpful docking agent. \u201cAfterward, I\u2019ll hit the market and see about parts for real repairs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go then.\u201d Saul tows the emergency sled behind him easily, which is impressive, considering the thrusters that lift it don\u2019t do anything for propulsion.</p> <p>As promised, we find a skywagon with an orange cross on the side waiting for us in front of the docking authority, and it\u2019s large enough to slide the sled in back. Doc gets in the front with the driver, giving directions, and I climb up with March. With a smooth swoop, we\u2019re off. Gehenna whirls around me, an impossibly bright collage of color.</p><p>I rest my hand on March\u2019s chest, feeling the slow, steady thump of his heart. The last two days I\u2019ve found it impossible to sleep, and I\u2019m somewhere past exhausted. Maybe I doze off sitting beside him, because it feels to me like we just got moving, then we stop. Someone opens up the rear doors.</p><p>I recognize Doc hauling on the sled, so I hop down. Guess he\u2019s already paid the driver, so we make our way into the clinic, a posh-looking place done in ultrachrome and diamante with a marquee that proclaims, \u201cWe build a better you\u201d and a second sign that says \u201cWhere the stars come when they fall.\u201d I\u2019m not sure what that means, but I follow Doc, hoping he knows where he\u2019s going.</p><p>\u201cSaul Solaith!\u201d calls an extremely affable voice. It turns out to be attached to a slim silver-haired man around Doc\u2019s age. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me you were coming? I\u2019d have booked the twins and a suite at the Capital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpontaneous stop,\u201d Doc answers. \u201cI\u2019ve got a friend here in desperate need of your expertise, Ordo. Do you have an op-room free?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, yes, of course. And if I didn\u2019t, I\u2019d put someone out for you.\u201d</p><p>The two men walk away, leaving me standing in the foyer with the potted plants and an impressive view through the skylight. I drop down into a padded orange chair. Overhead I can see an ad satellite orbiting the salmon sky, but I can\u2019t make out its slogan. Somehow it seems important, like it\u2019s a special message just for me, so I continue to gaze straight up, waiting for the moment when it turns so I can read it.</p><p>Working girls prefer Sapphire.</p> <p>I don\u2019t know what that means, either, but over the next several hours, it works on me. The words must be a message written in code, and if I can just unravel their hidden significance, then March will be all right. But I can\u2019t work it out, and as I feel myself drifting off, I realize I\u2019ve let him down.</p><p>Don\u2019t know how long I was out, but Doc wakes me with a gentle hand on my shoulder. \u201cHe\u2019s awake, Jax. You want to see him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, please.\u201d I yawn as I push to my feet, scouring the sleep from my eyes with my knuckles. \u201cDid you...that is\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe couldn\u2019t save the arm,\u201d he says gravely. \u201cI had to choose between an organic and a prosthetic replacement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t want a\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. It\u2019s going to take some time for him to build strength in the new arm, and it looks a bit different. But with physical therapy and exercise, he should eventually return to normal. Come then, this way.\u201d</p><p>He leads me through a warren of hallways and opens the door to a recovery room. With luxurious draperies, mosaic tile floor, and commodious bed with multiple settings, this space looks every bit as lush as the rest of the clinic; Doc wasn\u2019t kidding when he said he had connections here.</p><p>March sits propped up, his shoulder wrapped decorously in liquid skin. The new arm looks strange and pale, not to mention slim, almost delicate in comparison with his right. Every now and then he flexes the fingers of his left hand, probably testing to be sure they really work. I can\u2019t blame him.</p><p>\u201cMarch,\u201d I say softly, and he looks up as if he hadn\u2019t heard us enter.</p><p>Lost in thought, I suppose. I would be, too. Doubtless he has a lot to think about. Neither one of us says a word in protest when Doc backs out of the room and closes the door behind him.</p><p>\u201cI understand I have you to thank.\u201d He beckons me with his right hand, and I approach the bed, feeling oddly tentative.</p><p>Shaking my head, I sit down, careful not to jostle him. \u201cWhat did Doc tell you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot much. And that worries me.\u201d His impossibly dark eyes search mine.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t me,\u201d I say then. \u201cIt was Loras. And he didn\u2019t...he didn\u2019t make it.\u201d</p><p>I expect him to light into me, tear me a new one over everything that\u2019s gone wrong, but instead his long lashes sweep down. His mouth compresses into a white line, and I see his throat working. I don\u2019t understand what\u2019s happening any more than I understood the slogan Working girls prefer Sapphire. March reaches blindly for my hand, and I curl my fingers through his. Waiting.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he whispers. \u201cYou were right. There was nothing we could do up there, and Loras shouldn\u2019t have died just so I could find that out.\u201d</p><p>Tears burn behind my eyes, and he\u2019s hurting me with his grip on my fingers. But I don\u2019t pull back. \u201cMaybe you can\u2019t save the world, but you\u2019ll never stop trying. It\u2019s the best thing about you.\u201d</p><p>He opens his eyes then, and they\u2019re so dark I can\u2019t see his pupils. I hope it\u2019s the drugs talking as he bites out, \u201cSave the world? I can\u2019t even save the people I care about. It\u2019s just fucking hopeless.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ve never seen him like this, and I don\u2019t know what to say. Reassurance isn\u2019t my style in the first place, and to make it worse, I don\u2019t disagree with him. He\u2019s tapped into my worldview, but I don\u2019t like seeing it on him.</p><p>But in the end, the only answer he needs right now is the warmth of my hand wrapped around his as he fades out.</p><p>CHAPTER 38</p><p>I give them three weeks.</p><p>See, it never seems like the right time to say it, from the moment I made up my mind. First Hon\u2019s scout ships came tearing after us, then we had to get to Gehenna, March needed medical attention. Then I would\u2019ve felt like a shit to walk into the recovery room, ask how he\u2019s doing, then tell him I\u2019m leaving. Not that it\u2019s going to be any easier now, but at least I won\u2019t feel like I\u2019m kicking the man while he\u2019s down.</p><p>So I bide my time, helping Dina with ship repairs when she\u2019s not seeing the docking agent, whose name is Clary. Doc seems to be taking advantage of the unscheduled R&amp;R as well, raising hell with his old friend Ordo Carvati. But I\u2019m glad when the clinic gives March a clean bill of health because it means I can finally get it out in the open. Stop pretending I\u2019m in this for the long haul.</p><p>You\u2019d think that wouldn\u2019t help me any, but I\u2019ve learned March\u2019s partition trick. I know he\u2019s wondering why he can\u2019t read me anymore, but I\u2019ve been careful not to give any sign of what I\u2019m thinking. I didn\u2019t want to piss him off while he was recuperating.</p><p>Saying farewell aboard the Folly would prove impossible, so I\u2019ve arranged to meet him for dinner at Molino\u2019s, got a nice little table in the atrium. I\u2019m early. The ship\u2019s come to feel like home over the past months, but it\u2019s time to go.</p><p>I just want to step out into the throng and disappear. Live the rest of my life quietly. I\u2019m tired of being pushed and pulled without my volition. I want to make my own choices from here on out, not do what someone else tells me. I don\u2019t give a shit about the greater good or changing the universe. A training academy isn\u2019t worth dying for. Shit, it\u2019s not even my dream. At this point, I don\u2019t know what that would be.</p><p>Yeah, I know it means I\u2019ll never see grimspace again, never feel the exhilaration that follows a good jump. But I guess I\u2019m one of the rare ones after all. I can let it go.</p><p>Before he comes into sight, I know he\u2019s arrived. Don\u2019t ask me how; it\u2019s some March-sense I wish I didn\u2019t possess, perhaps a remnant of jumping with a Psi pilot. I wish I\u2019d learned more about him, but it\u2019s too late now. I\u2019ve already removed my things from the Folly; they\u2019re in the bag Dina gave me, stowed beneath the table. He strides between the tables, strong and vibrant, a little incongruous among the lattices and hanging vines. This part of the restaurant is meant to evoke a tropical garden, but thankfully they omitted the insects.</p><p>\u201cDoc said you wanted me to meet you here,\u201d he says, but there\u2019s a question in his voice, echoed in his dark eyes. March rests his palm on the back of the chair but doesn\u2019t sit, as if he suspects this is just a stop on the way to somewhere else. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThey have great stuffed peppers,\u201d I say, and that seems to startle him.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll bite.\u201d He drops down in the chair opposite me. \u201cWhat\u2019s up, Jax?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDinner?\u201d Maybe he\u2019ll take the news better with a full stomach. Regardless, it can\u2019t hurt, and I really do like their stuffed peppers.</p><p>So we eat, but I sense the currents stirring beneath our casual conversation. When the waiters clear our plates and we\u2019re left with just our wine to finish, I wrap both my hands around the glass because I feel the need to hold on to something. This is harder than I thought it would be.</p> <p>\u201cYou want to tell me what\u2019s going on now?\u201d He sits back in his chair, propping his ankle on his knee.</p><p>I take a deep breath. \u201cIt\u2019s time for us to part ways. I\u2019ve been doing a lot of thinking since we left the station, and I just don\u2019t feel this is worth it.\u201d</p><p>March starts to smile like he\u2019s waiting for the punch line. \u201cNo, seriously.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s when I drop the mental walls he taught me how to build, and now I can feel his presence more than I ever could before. Perhaps it\u2019s a result of his absence; perhaps I\u2019m simply developing a little of my own latent sensitivity.</p><p>\u201cSeriously.\u201d</p> <p>He shakes his head, seeming unable to believe what he\u2019s seen inside my head. \u201cYou can\u2019t go...we saved you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you did,\u201d I say gently. \u201cAnd I saved you, too. I\u2019ll always be grateful to you for getting me off Perlas, but this isn\u2019t how I want to live. You don\u2019t own me.\u201d</p><p>I can tell he\u2019s getting angry. \u201cWhat the hell do you think you\u2019re going to do, Jax? You have no creds and no training.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoc paid me the wages I should have earned during the time I\u2019ve been with you. He said he didn\u2019t think I should be stuck on the Folly, unable to enjoy myself.\u201d I\u2019m trying not to argue with him because it\u2019s not open for debate. My mind is made up.</p><p>\u201cYou think that\u2019s going to last forever? What the frag do you think you can do here? Wait tables?\u201d He gestures at the handsome young man, who takes one look at March\u2019s face and heads the other way. \u201cYou\u2019d kick someone in the head the first time he complained about the food.\u201d</p><p>I smile because he\u2019s right about that, but I\u2019ve done some digging while we\u2019ve been here. \u201cI can probably get work at one of the fetish clubs. Gehenna caters to different tastes, you know.\u201d Scars, piercing, and body art are popular with a certain clientele.</p> <p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s what you want to devote your life to?\u201d He sits forward then, elbows on the table, and his eyes sear me. \u201cLetting freaks stare at you until you\u2019re so old they don\u2019t want to anymore?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but it\u2019ll put food on the table until I decide what I do want. Too many people have died, and I don\u2019t intend to be one of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNobody ever accomplished anything this big if people weren\u2019t willing to die for it. Maybe I won\u2019t see Mair\u2019s vision come to fruition, but we\u2019ll lay the groundwork so that others can come behind us and finish our work. One thing\u2019s for sure, though, I won\u2019t allow them to have died in vain because I\u2019m afraid to see it through. You\u2019re a fucking coward, Jax, and you\u2019re running because you\u2019re scared you found something worth dying for, something more important than you.\u201d</p><p>I grit my teeth. \u201cYou know what I see? Someone afraid of finding something worth living for. Everyone you love dies, so you decided it\u2019s better to be a doomed hero, and you don\u2019t care who you drag down with you. Do you really believe in this cause, heart and soul, or is it just that there\u2019s nothing else for you? You\u2019re a pilot who doesn\u2019t want to fly because his ship\u2019s a monument to his dead sister, and you have the nerve to bitch at me? Get your own life in order before you come at me like you have all the answers.\u201d</p><p>As soon as the words leave my mouth, I\u2019m sorry. I see him flinch although nobody else would have known they\u2019d drawn blood. He shoves his chair back so hard that the scraping sound momentarily silences the low hum of conversation nearby.</p><p>\u201cPart of that may be true,\u201d he growls. \u201cBut I don\u2019t use people, and I don\u2019t fuck my friends over. I get it, Jax, and I\u2019ll tell Doc and Dina you took the opportunity to jump ship as soon as we arrived somewhere you\u2019d rather be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarch...\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t turn, so I watch until his angry strides carry him out of sight. I don\u2019t have a chance to tell him it wasn\u2019t like that; I didn\u2019t lie to them, pretending to believe in what they were doing until I saw my chance to get away here. The cost just got too high, that\u2019s all. I didn\u2019t want it to end like this, but maybe I always knew we\u2019d never wind up friends. Though I didn\u2019t always agree with him or even like him sometimes, March is a rock, and you don\u2019t run across those too often.</p> <p>And losing him hurts more than I thought it would because I\u2019ve come to count on him. If nothing else, though, I believed in March, and maybe deep down I hoped he\u2019d see my point of view. If he hadn\u2019t reacted like that, I might have asked him to stay. I hadn\u2019t made up my mind, but his response decided matters for me. I finish my wine coolly, pretending the looks people keep sliding my way don\u2019t bother me.</p><p>Like none of you ever argued about anything. Or maybe you never cared enough.</p><p>It occurs to me then, he probably came down so hard on me because I hurt him. Maybe it felt personal, like a betrayal. And that pains me, but there\u2019s nothing I can do about it because it doesn\u2019t change my mind. I want a life, not sacrifice.</p><p>The waiter comes toward me like a child afraid of being slapped, so I muster up a smile and settle the bill. I collect my bag and leave with my head high. It\u2019s time to put all this behind me. I need to find work and a place to live. This is my new life, exactly what I wanted, and if I have a pain in my chest that won\u2019t go away, then I\u2019ll push it back.</p><p>That survival trick, you see? I\u2019ve taken the old Jax and boxed her up. It\u2019s time to move on to the next Jax incarnation, but at this moment, even I can\u2019t see what kind of person she\u2019ll be, what she\u2019ll do for a living, or whom she\u2019ll love.</p><p>My future seems misty, shrouded just like Gehenna\u2019s sun, and maybe that\u2019s the way it\u2019s supposed to be.</p><p>CHAPTER 39</p><p>Have you ever watched a child learning to walk?</p><p>Before this week, I never had, but there\u2019s a certain grace to it. Well, if not grace, then tenacity. Fall down nine times\u2014get up ten. And the tenth time you get where you\u2019re going, you don\u2019t stop, not for obstacles, not for other people telling you to stop. You don\u2019t listen to anything but that inner voice until you arrive where you want to be.</p><p>When do we lose that? Of course, maybe that inner voice needs some refinement because it apparently also tells us to eat what comes out of our noses, and that it\u2019s funny to hit people in the head, but I think maybe it carries a true message, too, something we shouldn\u2019t lose. I learned that working with children this week, not school-aged ones with the start of civilization impressed upon them. No, these are hardly more than babies, just learning to walk, little schooners of self.</p><p>It\u2019s strange how it worked out. I went to Hidden Rue, expecting to take my place on the stage. By all accounts it\u2019s a hard-core fetish club, where my scars might be an asset, but the old woman who owned the place took one look at me, and said, \u201cYou\u2019re too old, too scrawny, and your burns aren\u2019t interesting enough. What else can you do?\u201d</p><p>For a moment, March\u2019s mocking words came back to me, and I almost said, \u201cNot a damn thing.\u201d</p><p>Instead I did what I do best, spun a nice line of bullshit, the result of which is me, helping to watch the dancers\u2019 babies. Hidden Rue is a decent place to work. Domina, the owner, takes good care of her girls. Furthermore, she looks like she probably danced here in her day since she\u2019s tattooed, rit-scarred, and probably pierced in places I don\u2019t want to know about. They say an interesting life leaves its mark on your face, and if that\u2019s true, she\u2019s got one hell of a story. She\u2019s the one who told me that Sapphire is a line of cosmetics favored by strippers and joy girls.</p><p>The women have to stick together here because patrons tend to be rougher than what you get in a regular bar, guys who wish they\u2019d inflicted those scars, those wounds. Or it\u2019s the other side of the spectrum, timid little submissives who imagine each dancer as their own personal princess of pain. Occasionally we get others, too, mainly aliens who don\u2019t seem to realize the club\u2019s skewed west of the human norm.</p><p>I don\u2019t work the floor, though, so my contact with the public is minimal. Instead, I spend my evenings trying to entertain fractious toddlers who want their mothers, wail for no reason, and upchuck whenever it\u2019s likely to do the most harm. I\u2019ve been hired to assist a woman named Adele, who glows with serenity like nobody I\u2019ve ever known. She\u2019s short and round, skin the color of choclaste, so of course I like her on sight. She wears her hair in loose graying curls and might be anywhere between fifty and a hundred, though her smooth skin makes the latter unlikely.</p><p>We see a steady stream of dancers in costume in the cr\u00e8che during the course of a night. They want a quick cuddle between sets, but it usually leaves the little one crying. Still, I think it\u2019s nice of Domina to offer child care, although she does take a small cut from the dancers who use the service. That seems fair enough, no reason she should pay us entirely out of her own pocket. The babies I\u2019m less sure about, although ironically my time with baby-Z has prepared me somewhat.</p><p>Adele even comments, \u201cI can tell you\u2019ve done this before. What happened to your little one, honey?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe died.\u201d I feel suffused with guilt all over again.</p><p>If they knew what happened, they wouldn\u2019t let me work here.</p><p>She accepts that with a shake of her head and says nothing more. Instead, there\u2019s a spill to clean up, and Mattin has hit Lleela in the head again. There\u2019s justice to dispense, and tears to dry; we\u2019re constantly moving until we get them to sleep one by one. This is my fifth evening on the job, and I go home bone-tired, but it\u2019s not a bad feeling. Instead, there\u2019s satisfaction in it, like I\u2019m living a good life if not a large one.</p><p>It\u2019s penance. There\u2019s a reason I ended up here. I didn\u2019t do right by baby-Z, so I\u2019ll make it up as best I can. It\u2019s not what I\u2019d choose to do, but I don\u2019t even know what that would be. The most important thing is that I\u2019m accomplishing it by myself.</p><p>In the mornings, I like to shop. So first thing, I get up and head over to the market. Sometimes I look at the diaphanous veils and the belly jewels laid out, then at the next stall over I find totemic carvings and blessed kirpan waiting for those who believe in luck and talismans against evil. I linger over pottery and paintings. It seems as though I\u2019ve never had a place of my own to decorate. In my parents\u2019 house, I had a room, of course, but I was never permitted to change it or make it mine. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As I turn to leave the market, an old woman catches me by the arm. \u201cYour shadow troubles you.\u201d</p><p>I expect to find a fortune-teller soliciting me, reading cards or bones or peering into a cup to glimpse my future in sodden leaves. But this woman is simply garbed in black; she might be a cook or a housekeeper, certainly someone\u2019s grandmother, for her back is bent and her face withered.</p><p>\u201cMy shadow\u2019s fine,\u201d I reply with a frown.</p><p>\u201cShe is not,\u201d the stranger insists. \u201cShe has gone away and dreams another dream. You shift what lives inside your skin until she does not know you. And without her, I do not know how you will face this destiny hanging on you. So many ghosts walk behind you, so many ghosts...\u201d She shakes her head and sighs. \u201cI will light a candle for you at Mary\u2019s shrine.\u201d</p> <p>At that she releases my arm, and I expect her to ask me to pay for her blessing or insight, but she merely wraps her black shawl around her head and hurries on, as if she\u2019s tarried too long. I leave the market and head for home, feeling distinctly unsettled. Adele rented me a room in her building; the word \u201cgarret\u201d seems to apply. My flat used to be storage space before someone took the bright idea to replace half the walls with beveled glastique. Consequently, my ceilings slant beneath the line of the roof.</p><p>She told me it used to be an artist\u2019s studio; nobody\u2019s ever actually lived up here before. But I don\u2019t mind, the open vista and the altitude make me feel like I\u2019m flying, which might make a mudsider uneasy, but I\u2019ve spent so much of my life on ships, this place feels perfect. It feels like home.</p><p>When she brings a bowl of soup up for my lunch, I just have to ask, \u201cWhy are you being so nice to me?\u201d</p><p>She gives me a Madonna\u2019s smile. \u201cMary teaches us that\u2019s how you change the world, one soul at a time, one kindness at a time. That\u2019s the only way it\u2019ll ever take root.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t they kill her for that doctrine?\u201d I ask, taking the dish from her.</p> <p>Adele shakes her head. \u201cNo, that was her son. They knew better than to martyr her. It was meant as an object lesson from the authorities, but it didn\u2019t shut her mouth. She went on to live a good life.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ve never been religious, never thought much on the oaths I swear, but I pause in spooning up a bite of soup. \u201cThat\u2019s why she\u2019s revered? For living a good life?\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t mean to minimize its importance, but I can tell my tone struck a chord because she drops down on the battered old sofa that came with my apartment. \u201cIsn\u2019t that more than it sounds like, Sirantha? It\u2019s easy to do right when everything goes right. But let everything go wrong, and see how difficult it becomes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s certainly true.\u201d</p><p>When she calls me Sirantha, I think of my mother although I haven\u2019t seen her in fifteen years. I don\u2019t even know if she\u2019s still alive, but I don\u2019t harbor any illusions she\u2019d be glad to see me. I made my bed when I ran away from boarding school and signed a contract with the Corp, when I decided not to be the pretty soulless accessory they were grooming me to be. And maybe I still don\u2019t know who I am, but it\u2019s not what they wanted. And that\u2019s enough, for now.</p><p>For some reason, I can\u2019t bring myself to tell Adele I don\u2019t have any faith. Mary is an idea, someone who lived long ago maybe, but she\u2019s nothing I believe in. I\u2019ve never seen any sign of divinity or everlasting grace, except perhaps a whisper in the movements of that glass-dancer.</p> <p>Hard as it may be to swallow, I think this shot\u2019s all we get. Science has proved there\u2019s nothing to the talk of ghosts and spirits, no proof anything like the soul exists. And to my mind that\u2019s an argument against the existence of an omniscient force. I think people believe whatever makes living easiest, and who am I to deny someone comfort?</p><p>So I just shut up and eat my soup.</p><p>CHAPTER 40</p><p>I haven\u2019t been sleeping well.</p><p>It\u2019s been six weeks, and I can\u2019t get the old woman\u2019s words out of my head. Sometimes I catch myself looking over my shoulder for my shadow, and I never find one. I tell myself it\u2019s part of living on Gehenna, where there\u2019s no direct sunlight. Most citizens take regular UV treatments to make up for the deficiency.</p><p>But that\u2019s not the reason I wake up dripping sweat, hands fisted in my bedcovers. Where I sleep would give anyone else vertigo, mattress flush against the glastique wall. That\u2019s not my problem, either. First thing I do is roll over and look out over the city, see how the \u2019 scrapers strive toward the unassailable sky. The skycabs and private hovercars swoop with silent grace, and I lie there listening to my heartbeat.</p><p>On another world, it would be dawn now, and I wake from the same dream, night after night, exactly this way. I run my palm over my biceps and feel the skin marred by scars, further roughed by goose bumps. I don\u2019t know what to do.</p><p>He\u2019s the last person I want to see when I close my eyes, and yet he\u2019s there, always the same. Since I\u2019m a new Jax, building a new life, I try not to let myself think about March, but he comes to me in dreams. I see him sitting on the edge of his bunk, elbows on his knees, head sunk into his hands. That\u2019s all, really, but it doesn\u2019t begin to encapsulate his solitude and despair. It\u2019s like he\u2019s one of the ghosts the old woman claimed she saw following me.</p> <p>I hate how much I miss him. There\u2019s a hollow where he used to be, and it echoes with self-imposed loss. This is the life I chose, first decision I\u2019ve made since I was seventeen and ran away from finishing school, so I need to make the best of it.</p><p>I want to be happy, but my heart won\u2019t let me. In crowds I see his face. When I close my eyes, I see his face. And in dreams\u2014</p><p>With a muffled groan, I crawl off my mat and collect my bath basket. I don\u2019t have a san-shower in my garret, so I go down and borrow from Adele. She lives just below me, and most mornings we breakfast together as well. Usually it\u2019s darjing tea and toast with good marmalade.</p><p>She\u2019s coded the door to recognize me, so I don\u2019t wake her slipping in to take my shower. This morning I manage to get cleaned up and make the tea before she stirs. Scratching at her sleep-rumpled hair, she sits down at the small metal table that looks as if she salvaged it from a rubbish pile. Perhaps she did. But it\u2019s meticulously clean, if dinged and dented.</p><p>Adele takes one look at me, and says, \u201cYou dreamed of him again, hm?\u201d</p><p>I give a curt nod in reply, wrapping my fingers around my mug for warmth I can\u2019t seem to generate on my own. It\u2019s like I sweat away my heat in fitful sleep, then for the rest of the day I walk around with a chill I can\u2019t dispel. Doubtless the old woman from the bazaar would say it\u2019s something to do with my missing shadow.</p><p>She can tell I don\u2019t want to talk about it, though, so she falls quiet, and we eat listening to the bittersweet melody of the music she calls folkazz. Before work, we go to the piazza and listen to them play, old-fashioned instruments with reeds and strings. I like it, but there\u2019s a certain melancholy in their faces that says they know they belong to a lost era. Their music makes me think again of the ghosts that follow me.</p><p>Tonight, the children are especially querulous. If Gehenna experienced weather, I would say there\u2019s a storm coming. Perhaps there is, a dry lightning tempest somewhere beyond the safety of the dome. Mattin will not climb off my lap, even to hit Lleela in the head, and that little girl has attached herself to Adele\u2019s leg; she will not dislodge herself for toys or treats. The others seem less affected, but they do quarrel more over small infractions of rights or personal dignity. And none of them will sleep.</p><p>So we get no peace until the last of the dancers collects her offspring, then we walk home together through the titian-tinged streets. Though the hour is late, Gehenna looks exactly the same, like a whore who paints her face night after night and holds secret the ravages of time. I decline Adele\u2019s offer to come in and trudge up another flight to my flat. There\u2019s a lift in this building, but she tells me it hasn\u2019t worked in years.</p><p>Even before I let myself in, I smell the scent of a man\u2019s passage, but I don\u2019t expect to find him standing in my flat. I know how it must look to him: poor, eccentric, squalid. But it\u2019s mine. His back is turned to me, and he seems to be admiring the view. It\u2019s strange to see him amid my eclectic furnishings, my sleep-mat, the battered sofa, a softly glowing lamp with a fringed shade. But he spins as he senses my presence, even though I don\u2019t speak.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a while,\u201d Doc says, folding his hands behind him. \u201cHello, Sirantha.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you would have gone by now.\u201d</p><p>Long before now, actually.</p><p>\u201cOh, we tried.\u201d And there\u2019s certain heaviness to his tone that unnerves me. \u201cWe were so lucky to find Edaine. She failed basic academy training, but not through incompetence. One of her instructors took a fancy to her and gave her low marks when she refused to sleep with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I imagine that\u2019s pretty rare. Would you like something to drink?\u201d I keep my words neutral.</p><p>\u201cNo thank you. I won\u2019t stay long.\u201d He studies me for a moment, as if seeking something in my eyes or expression.</p><p>\u201cHow did you find me?\u201d I thought I had well and truly disappeared.</p><p>That bothers me. If he found me, then the Corp could as well, not to mention bounty hunters. Gray men don\u2019t always work as a unit. Sometimes they dispatch a solo quietly to neutralize targets on worlds they don\u2019t control. It\u2019s not unreasonable to posit one such might be searching for me here, even now, and I can\u2019t be on my guard all the time. To make it worse, my presence might pose a danger to the children and to Adele. That I cannot permit.</p><p>\u201cMy old friend Ordo has excellent connections,\u201d he answers.</p><p>I suspect that\u2019s an understatement. Ordo Carvati can accomplish anything he wants in Gehenna. He\u2019s from one of the First families, and he\u2019s old money. It\u2019s to Doc\u2019s credit that he doesn\u2019t flaunt his friendship with such a man.</p><p>\u201cBut he can\u2019t find you another jumper?\u201d</p><p>He hasn\u2019t moved from the center of the room, and none of his body language tells me this is a friendly visit. In fact, I would say he doesn\u2019t want to be here at all. That tells me a great deal about his state of mind.</p><p>At that he smiles, although there\u2019s a sad slant to it. \u201cHe cannot make miracles. I know what March has said about you. And I\u2019ve listened to Dina\u2019s thoughts as well.\u201d By his careful phrasing I can well imagine the way the other two cursed me. He takes a step forward, and the glow from my fringed lamp finally touches his face. \u201cTwo days ago Dina had a shunt installed. Ordo wouldn\u2019t do it, so she went to a black-market surgeon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA shunt?\u201d I repeat blankly. \u201cWhy?\u201d But even as I ask, I find myself fingering the jack hidden in my wrist.</p><p>\u201cShe says there\u2019s no one else,\u201d he answers.</p><p>Now I understand the heaviness in his voice. \u201cThat\u2019s crazy. She isn\u2019t trained.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t even imagine what grimspace would do to someone untrained, someone who doesn\u2019t possess the J-gene. Don\u2019t know whether it will kill her, drive her mad, or if all of them will be lost. I could find out, research the early days when they first discovered the Star Road, but something tells me knowing won\u2019t make it easier to bear. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Doc shrugs. \u201cShe seems to think determination and mental strength should make up for that. They don\u2019t know I\u2019m here. March was supposed to ask you back, perhaps two weeks ago. He said you refused.\u201d</p><p>That hurts. As long as I had known him, March never lied. And yet he\u2019s learned how in order to avoid seeing me.</p><p>\u201cHe never came,\u201d I say quietly.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to believe what the others said, Sirantha. Now that you know, I can\u2019t imagine you\u2019ll let her do it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d My heart sinks as I say it. But like Gehenna itself, these past weeks have been nothing but an illusion. I can\u2019t hide here. I can\u2019t live a quiet, simple life. \u201cOf course I won\u2019t. Just let me get my things.\u201d</p><p>Dina has lost so much. She imagines there\u2019s no reason not to take the risk. She might even see it as a way to get back to Edaine. The people we love and lose never return to us, though, no matter how many shades we chase. And March...March would do anything to keep his word to Mair, no matter what the cost.</p><p>As I brush by him, Doc touches my shoulder. \u201cYou may not want to admit it, but you are a vital piece of the puzzle. No one has been the same since you went away.\u201d</p><p>I know there are probably other difficulties, mounting docking fee costs. Obstacles I haven\u2019t even considered. As in my dream, March sits on the edge of his bunk, night after night, trying to find a way to succeed, trying to find a way out.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want to admit it,\u201d I tell him, weary beyond belief. \u201cBut I\u2019ve spent my whole life doing as I\u2019m told. This was the first time I ever did what I wanted. But it turns out I\u2019m not allowed, so I\u2019ll live and die on someone else\u2019s agenda. Burn out jumping, no matter what I want.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh...\u201d His expression tells me he hates putting me in this position but not enough to leave. And it\u2019s probably best that I go. It would kill me if anything happened to Adele because of me. \u201cIf it makes any difference, I don\u2019t think you can burn out.\u201d</p><p>I pause in stuffing my belongings into my bag. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to say anything until I was sure. But I\u2019ve compared your before and after images to other case studies, quite extensively over the past weeks.\u201d He shakes his head. \u201cSorry, I am getting ahead of myself. In your first scan, I detected brain lesions consistent with AGSS. That test indicated burnout was inevitable and quite soon. Your next jump should have been your last. Instead, you came out, slept for three days, and when I took the next reading, all lesions had disappeared. Your brain looks as if you never jumped in your life, a student straight out of the academy.\u201d</p><p>The duffel slips from my hand. \u201cHow is that even possible?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Doc shakes his head. \u201cIt\u2019s something to do with the L-gene I isolated, but that\u2019s...not a human trait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re saying I\u2019m\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m saying you apparently don\u2019t need to worry about burnout.\u201d</p><p>I feel numb as we head out of my glastique flat, like I don\u2019t know what\u2019s true anymore. Doc takes my bag from my nerveless fingers, and I tuck my favorite lamp beneath my arm. Although it\u2019s late, I tap on Adele\u2019s door, declining its offer to let me in.</p><p>She answers soon after, groggy but not alarmed, and her eyes go immediately to the man behind me. I glance at him, and it\u2019s like he\u2019s been hit by lightning. They simply stare at one another until I feel superfluous and clear my throat.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m leaving,\u201d I say without explanation or apology. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I can\u2019t stay until you find a replacement for me at Hidden Rue.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes are so gentle. \u201cIt\u2019s all right, child. I knew your fate didn\u2019t rest with me. Call it a fuel stop for the soul, hm?\u201d</p><p>Yes, that\u2019s exactly what it was. I hug her, then murmur, \u201cThis is my friend, Saul Solaith. Most people just call him Doc, though.\u201d To him, I add, \u201cThis is Adele.\u201d</p><p>She smiles with unearthly sweetness. \u201cI\u2019ll be seeing you again, I think.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t know whether she\u2019s talking to him or me. It doesn\u2019t matter, really. We go then, down many flights of stairs and into Gehenna night, which looks the same as Gehenna dawn or Gehenna dusk. I think maybe I\u2019m ready to go. Doc doesn\u2019t speak during our return to the spaceport.</p> <p>As I walk up the ramp to the Folly, I glance back once and see my shadow.</p><p>CHAPTER 41</p><p>I\u2019m unpacking when the door to my quarters slides open.</p><p>They\u2019ve erased all trace of my presence here; the room-bot doesn\u2019t even recognize me any longer. So I have no personal control over my environment at the moment although I have propped my fringed lamp up at the end of my bunk. Without turning, I know that it\u2019s March standing behind me.</p><p>\u201cYou were going to let Dina die before asking me for help?\u201d Attack is the best alternative here. \u201cAnd then you lied about it? Asshole.\u201d</p><p>I face him then, but it\u2019s a casual movement, born of stowing my now-empty bag into the bottom of the storage closet where I\u2019ve hung my clothes. Though I manage not to react, I\u2019m shaken by how haggard he looks. He\u2019s visibly thinner, lean jaw unshaven, and there\u2019s a terrible darkness in his eyes that has nothing to do with their hue.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he says with a flicker of his old bite. \u201cAnd that\u2019s so much worse than abandoning people who depend on you.\u201d</p><p>You know, I\u2019ve never been in this position before. Never had to remember who I used to be and try to become that woman again. Who was I before I walked away? I remember it hurt me to say farewell to this man. I bled when he left me sitting in Molino\u2019s, his accusations etched in acid, eating at me from the inside out. And now those feelings return as I wriggle back into her soul.</p><p>My soul. A thing I didn\u2019t believe in until I spent time with Adele. Oh Mary, I\u2019m so broken. Never realized how fragmented I\u2019ve become until this moment. I\u2019m a mirror where someone sunk his fist, a thousand tiny images refracted from that fissure, and none of them complete.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t make you understand then,\u201d I say softly. \u201cAnd I can\u2019t now. I hoped you could find someone else. I don\u2019t see myself as irreplaceable.\u201d</p><p>He steps fully into my room, and the door swishes shut behind him. \u201cYou think jumpers grow on trees? Why do you think we settled for you in the first place?\u201d</p><p>That sends a stab of fresh pain through me, but I don\u2019t let it show. Maybe he can feel it. I don\u2019t know anymore. \u201cI thought it was tied to Doc\u2019s research.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust you to be literal.\u201d March glances around my quarters, which seem smaller with him standing there. He flexes the fingers of his left hand; that\u2019s a new nervous habit. \u201cYeah, it had to be you. But if you\u2019re just going to run away again\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019ll see it through.\u201d Like I have a choice. I\u2019m bound here, and I don\u2019t know why I didn\u2019t see it sooner. \u201cMarch, I\u2019m sorry for what I said about your sister.\u201d</p><p>His intake of breath sounds so loud. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t why I stopped piloting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I was mad, so I put two and two together to make twelve.\u201d Hesitate for a moment, then add, \u201cAnd I wanted to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did.\u201d</p><p>The words lie between us like a gauntlet. I don\u2019t know what he means, so I choose the coward\u2019s course. Apropos, I think. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>He shrugs. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing new.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think it didn\u2019t cut me every time you thought of him?\u201d His jaw clenches. \u201cYou think I didn\u2019t bleed when you left my bed to scrub away my touch and deify his memory? You think it didn\u2019t hurt when you left me? Jax, you\u2019ve been slicing me to bits for months, and there\u2019s damn near nothing left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarch...\u201d But he\u2019s not interested in whatever I might say.</p><p>He shakes his head. \u201cI\u2019m not letting you do that to me anymore. It\u2019s going to be different this time.\u201d</p><p>I know what\u2019s coming, and I\u2019m not going to let him say it, not when I\u2019m just starting to figure things out. \u201cI didn\u2019t think about him when I went away.\u201d I step closer and his whole body tenses, although whether in anticipation of pain or pleasure, I couldn\u2019t say. \u201cI dreamed of you.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t believe I told him that. But the moment thrums with such stark honesty that I can\u2019t offer him less. I never knew I had the power to hurt him, only that he possessed the power to hurt me.</p><p>His ridiculously long-lashed eyes search mine, as if for some sign I\u2019m going to turn this into a cruel joke, but I hold his look, letting him see the truth. Funny how I can tell when he\u2019s reading me now; it\u2019s a little prickle on the back of my neck.</p><p>\u201cYou mean it,\u201d he says, after a moment.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d That same candor compels me to add, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have done anything about it, though. I wouldn\u2019t have come back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d He smiles then. \u201cWe\u2019re great ones for burning bridges, you and I. Slamming doors hard enough that we\u2019re not tempted to knock on them again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds about right.\u201d</p><p>March touches my hair, tentative, as if he thinks one wrong move will frighten me away. I close my eyes and draw a deep breath at the feel of his fingers on the nape of my neck. When I don\u2019t recoil, he pulls me close, and I wrap my arms around his waist, running my hands up his back. He\u2019s so thin I can count his ribs with my fingertips.</p><p>Oh Mary, I missed this. He feels...right, just as he did on Lachion. I remember how he drove away the bad dreams, even then. I remember how his arms always felt like they could protect me from anything, but maybe I was afraid because I never accept that from anyone. I never admit I might need it.</p><p>\u201cTell me this isn\u2019t what you were running from.\u201d Lacing our fingers together, he flattens my palm over his heart. \u201cI can\u2019t compete with a ghost, though. I won\u2019t even try. So if you want me to let go, just say so and\u2014\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cI don\u2019t know, it may have been part of it, but I...laid him to rest somewhere on Gehenna.\u201d</p><p>March tips my face up, studying my features intently for a moment, then he swings me up in his arms, and I realize I haven\u2019t even asked about his recovery. He must be all right, though, because he carries me over to the bunk and settles with me in his lap. I feel him running his hands up and down my back, stroking my thick, coarse hair. I expect...more I suppose, but he doesn\u2019t even kiss me.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he says, shaking his head. \u201cThat was too soon, and I paid for it. Probably should\u2019ve just let you sleep with Hon. I just\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t stand to see someone else touching your woman?\u201d</p><p>He exhales into my hair, and I shift enough to glimpse his sheepish expression. \u201cI know. Big clich\u00e9, right?\u201d</p><p>I find myself reassuring him. \u201cA certain amount of territoriality between mates is natural. I know we\u2019re supposed to be enlightened, but some things just don\u2019t breed out.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His smile widens into a grin, and it\u2019s only then that I grasp what I\u2019ve said. But I don\u2019t try to take it back. When March tilts his head against mine, my mind swims for a moment, then I\u2019m full of him. He shows me everything, a barrage of impressions, and I understand why I can\u2019t resist him. He\u2019s exactly like me: compartmentalized, broken, a jumbled mass of jagged edges he conceals beneath biting wit and confidence.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t imagine what it\u2019s like. Hearing secret thoughts, then listening to lies spoken with a smile. It kills the soul, Jax. I was a monster when I met Mair. She turned me into a decent human being and taught me to control it.\u201d He hesitates, shuddering, and I reach up to stroke his cheek. I know he\u2019s not going to be in a confessional mood forever. \u201cBut after our first jump, I\u2019d find myself in your head without any clue how I got there. It scared the shit out of me. I\u2019d stopped piloting because Mair said there were risks associated with a Psi-sensitive using wetware.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess it would. I thought you just were doing it to piss me off.\u201d I smile up at him to take the sting out of my words, but I have to wonder what risks Mair was talking about. Wonder if she left anything in my PA. \u201cDo the others know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! They wouldn\u2019t understand. They\u2019d be afraid of me, afraid of what I know. Jax...\u201d His tone turns wondering. \u201cDo you have any idea what a miracle you are? What you say is exactly what I see in your head. No disparity, no dirty secrets. Even when you detested me, you made no bones about it.\u201d</p> <p>I grin at him. \u201cYou like a little honest hatred, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess I do. Spices things up.\u201d He pulls me closer, resting his chin on my head, and I listen to his heart.</p><p>Hard to say who\u2019s most surprised when the door slides back. Shit, I forgot it will open for anyone right now. Guess it\u2019s a good thing we\u2019re just curled on my bunk together. Doc still looks astonished, though.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to say that we\u2019re clear for departure.\u201d He clears his throat. \u201cAnytime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t kill each other,\u201d I say with a grin. \u201cWe\u2019ll head to the cockpit shortly.\u201d</p> <p>Right now, March looks more at peace than I\u2019ve ever seen him, and it\u2019s a little hard to reconcile that serenity as being related to me. I shake things up, create chaos and agitate for change, but I\u2019ve never been accused of being restful.</p><p>He cups my cheek in his palm, and murmurs to Doc, \u201cFive minutes. Now get out.\u201d</p><p>I truly hope we\u2019re going to make good use of that time.</p><p>CHAPTER 42</p><p>We\u2019re not going where I thought we were.</p><p>As March and I emerge from quarters, we find Doc and Dina waiting for us in the hub. To my surprise, neither looks like they want to kill me, although Saul\u2019s expression gives me pause. He sighs and powers up the comm station. I avoid touching it whenever possible because Loras is supposed to be sitting there.</p> <p>\u201cI think you\u2019d better take a look at this.\u201d</p><p>When I lean forward, I see an old holo-newsfeed, dated almost two months back. A dark-haired woman with a small mouth and a perfect coif smiles without showing teeth. This is notable only because she manages to speak without showing them, either. I think she mistakes this facial immobility for a proper \u201cgrave business\u201d expression.</p><p>\u201cCitizens of the Conglomerate, we urge you to be on your guard. Although we\u2019ve tried to contain this matter internally, we of Farwan Corporation cannot in good conscience\u201d\u2014I snort at that\u2014\u201ccontinue our search without revealing the inherent danger we all face. This woman, Sirantha Jax...\u201d</p><p>Here, an unflattering picture of me flashes in the upper right-hand corner of the screen. \u201cA former employee has escaped from our secure facility on Perlas Station, where she was awaiting trial for her involvement in the death of eighty-two souls aboard the Sargasso. We do not know the names or identities of her accomplices, but we speculate they may be the terrorists responsible for the strike against the conference on Matins IV. Their reign of terror continues unabated. Our operatives tracked them to DuPont Station, where for reasons known only to themselves, they\u2014\u201d</p><p>My breath hisses out of me in a rush. \u201cWe didn\u2019t blow the station!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, we most certainly did not,\u201d Doc agrees with a sigh. \u201cBut so far as the rest of the Conglomerate is concerned, we did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would they do that?\u201d My knees feel shaky as I keep seeing the explosion, time and again. \u201cAnd how did they even know we were there?\u201d</p><p>Dina finally speaks but she sounds matter-of-fact. \u201cMy guess is, Hon contacted them, intending to cut a deal. Maybe he was tired of playing mad scientist with Farr and wanted recognition from the Conglomerate. Maybe he was tired of worrying about them showing up to evict him if he ever became a threat instead of an annoyance. But he wouldn\u2019t have been able to negotiate without you, Jax.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t want to kill us, just stall us until they arrived,\u201d March agrees.</p><p>I feel his hand light in the small of my back, a proprietary gesture. The other two make note of it, but they don\u2019t comment, which had to cost Dina. She even smiles at me. Just what the hell is going on?</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know exactly what transpired,\u201d Doc says, \u201cbut they\u2019ve clearly pinned the blame on us. And that\u2019s not the worst of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s more?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndirectly.\u201d He picks up the device he was showing Dina when we emerged from quarters and starts indicating readings that don\u2019t mean anything to me. \u201cThe problem is, they\u2019ve closed the doors to us that we need most.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need me for this,\u201d March interjects. \u201cI\u2019m getting us off this rock while you bring her up to speed.\u201d</p><p>I guess he already knows this stuff. And yeah, maybe I\u2019m a little disappointed when he walks off without looking back, but I redirect my attention without being obvious. I already knew March is practical. He\u2019s never going to sit at my feet and write me poems, which is good because I hate poetry, except dirty ones that rhyme.</p><p>\u201cAnyway,\u201d Doc says pointedly, and I roll my eyes. Sometimes he reminds me of my professors. \u201cI\u2019ve been studying your scans, comparing them with the sample I took from the Mareq.\u201d I flinch, but he seems not to notice. \u201cYour DNA isn\u2019t entirely...human. I alluded to it back at your flat, but the truth is, in all my case studies, I\u2019ve never seen the L-gene append to the J-gene, as it has in you. I was hoping to achieve that through years of engineering, but it appears that our work has been done for us, either by nature or design.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re saying\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t even know how this is possible.\u201d He bites the words off. \u201cWhat we need to do is retrace your steps, dig into your early life and try to discover how this happened, so we can duplicate it. That may be the best shortcut available; otherwise, we\u2019ll spend months gathering samples before I can even begin work.\u201d</p><p>The Folly trembles, powering up, and Dina pushes away from the console. I think she doesn\u2019t want to look at it anymore, and I can\u2019t blame her.</p><p>\u201cBy making us infamous, they\u2019ve shut the door on us,\u201d she mutters. \u201cWe can\u2019t use official ports, and you grew up on New Terra, right? That\u2019s where we need to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe three of you can go. They said they don\u2019t know who my accomplices are. I can wait on the Folly. Maybe you can find something out.\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head. \u201cThat\u2019s bullshit, Jax. We registered on Perlas. They know the name of the ship, and they have our sequence codes. How else did they send this?\u201d</p><p>Saul fires up the terminal again, saying only, \u201cWhat I showed you before, that was just the attachment. This is the message.\u201d</p><p>A man with sea-blue eyes and elegant, chiseled features comes on-screen. I drop down hard in Loras\u2019s chair because I recognize him. For several moments I see his lips moving but no sound registers, and Dina touches my shoulder.</p><p>\u201cYou all right?\u201d At my mute nod, she says to Doc, \u201cI think you better replay it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSirantha, this message has been bounced off all public relays. I implore you, surrender now. Turn yourself in at the nearest Corp outpost, and we will tend to your treatment. You\u2019re confused, unwell, and perhaps do not realize that your actions are wrong.\u201d</p><p>Shit.</p><p>Simon always was a persuasive bastard. On-screen, he\u2019s the image of a concerned husband. I haven\u2019t seen him in years, but now they\u2019ve got him acting as the face of Farwan, hoping to entice me back? They must really think I am crazy. I don\u2019t understand why they\u2019ve painted me as an interstellar terrorist, though. Is it spin, covering up their negligence on Matins IV, or are they using me to hide something else entirely? Whichever the case, I suspect they\u2019re widening the net.</p><p>\u201cThe only place we\u2019re safe is in here in the Outskirts.\u201d Both Dina and Doc nod, waiting to see where I\u2019m going by stating the obvious, I guess. \u201cBut you think something in my past could provide answers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s our best hope,\u201d Saul replies, stroking his goatee with two fingers. \u201cAlso the most dangerous course for obvious reasons.\u201d</p><p>I glance at Dina, but she picks today to begin keeping her mouth shut. \u201cThen that\u2019s where we need to go.\u201d</p><p>Can\u2019t imagine what my parents are going to say after all this time. Assuming we can find a place to dock. After all, New Terra is a Conglomerate world, firmly in the clutches of Farwan Corporation. It\u2019s going to take all our combined ingenuity to keep from winding up in a cell.</p><p>The ship lifts, a subtle jolt. We steady ourselves on the console as March guides us through the locks that will liberate us from Gehenna. Now that I\u2019ve tried flying this damn thing, I can\u2019t help but feel impressed. Consider how rusty he must\u2019ve been on Perlas, and yet he\u2019s taking us out of the atmosphere so smoothly we can scarcely register the shifts in altitude. He\u2019s really, really good.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I say to Dina.</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t see a scar on her wrist or even a bandage. The surgeon must have been first-rate. Rare in a black-market doctor.</p><p>\u201cLeaving.\u201d</p><p>She cocks a brow at me. \u201cI don\u2019t blame you for wanting some leave, Jax. It\u2019s been a pretty fragged-up run, hasn\u2019t it? And we could scarcely have found a safer port.\u201d</p><p>I narrow my eyes at Saul. \u201cYou lied to me.\u201d</p><p>He turns, offering me a layered smile. \u201cDina never doubted you were coming back. So I had to make that happen, didn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>They never told her I left for good?</p><p>Doc\u2019s ice blue eyes tell me things I never knew about him: He\u2019ll lie, cheat, or steal to unearth this truth. On the surface, he\u2019s the model of chivalry, courtesy, and kindness, a gentleman scholar. But he analyzed the situation and told me exactly what would get me back on board. And here I am.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Dina glances between us, interested but wary. And so I fill her in. By the time I\u2019ve finished, she can\u2019t get her breath for laughing. \u201cJust how stupid do you think I am? If you took off, we\u2019d stay till we found someone. Like hell do I see myself as a jumper; I had fun with Clary. Wouldn\u2019t have minded hanging around another couple of weeks, but Saul said you were ready to get back to it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Beneath his intellectual exterior lies a ruthless bastard. And this is the first time I\u2019ve seen it. I experience a frisson of unease, as if I\u2019ve been sailing along a smooth sea, unaware of dangers that lurk unseen.</p><p>Between March and Doc, I have been handled.</p><p>CHAPTER 43</p><p>We bitch at each other throughout the entire jump.</p> <p>I\u2019ve never done that before, didn\u2019t even know it was possible. We\u2019re lucky we didn\u2019t wind up past the Polaris system, halfway to Old Terra. I unplug and bounce out of the nav chair, glaring at March, hands on hips.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe I bought into this again. You and Doc, you two would say anything to keep me here. What about the stuff you said in my quarters? Was that bullshit, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he answers, setting our cruise course for New Terra. \u201cHe said he\u2019d figure something out, but I have never lied to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you have lackeys do that for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you looking for a reason to fight with me?\u201d He unstraps and pushes to his feet. \u201cI can\u2019t fake anything with you. I had no fragging clue how he meant to get you back here. And when you said that about Dina dying, I almost said, \u2018Huh?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo why didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted to find out what he told you.\u201d March cups my shoulders gently. \u201cLook at me and swear you honestly don\u2019t believe I thought you were never coming back.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s true, he looks like shit, but I don\u2019t want to be persuaded. I want to argue. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Both my hands curl into fists at my sides. \u201cI\u2019m tired of having nobody I can trust. Tired of people keeping secrets from me, tired of not being sure whether I\u2019m even working for the good guys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJax, I can\u2019t promise we\u2019re squeaky clean, but look at the opposition. They killed eighty-two people on the Sargasso for unknown reasons. They blew up DuPont Station with two hundred souls living there, not counting the unborn.\u201d He breathes like merely thinking of it hurts him. \u201cBut I\u2019m solid, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess so,\u201d I mutter.</p><p>When he pulls me toward him, I lean my head against his chest, wondering if I can truly trust him. Wondering whether I can trust my own judgment. I\u2019ve known from the beginning they intend to use me, and March is bound by so many debts and promises, none of them to me.</p> <p>His hands play over my back. \u201cI know you\u2019re mad. Did you yell at Doc?\u201d Feeling sheepish, I shake my head. \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid to provoke him,\u201d I confess, low. \u201cI don\u2019t know him like I thought I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re afraid to provoke Saul,\u201d he repeats, looking incredulous. \u201cWho\u2019s a pacifist. So you take it out on me.\u201d March shakes his head. \u201cYou\u2019re one of a kind, Jax. We\u2019ve got eight hours before New Terra. Come on.\u201d</p><p>Put that way, I know it doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense. I think about it, trying to quantify the feeling, but I can\u2019t. Maybe I\u2019m mixing Doc up with the Unit Psychs or even Canton Farr. Do I really think he\u2019s capable of greater malice? I don\u2019t fucking know. At best he believes the end justifies the means, and I can\u2019t sort it out. So when March reaches for me, I take his hand and let him lead me to his quarters.</p><p>As he guides me to the bed, I whisper, \u201cI thought you said it was too soon.\u201d</p><p>He kisses my forehead. \u201cNot for this. I\u2019m tired, but I want you with me.\u201d In an economy of movement he drops onto the mattress, then rolls to his side, back to the wall. \u201cUnless you have somewhere else you\u2019d rather be.\u201d There\u2019s a certain vulnerability in his voice, and maybe I play on that while I gaze around his cabin, pretending to take in the bunk built out from the wall, the closet adjacent to the san facilities, and the personal sys-term on the opposite wall. \u201cJax?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I can clear my schedule for you.\u201d</p><p>The bunk feels firm beneath my knees; it doesn\u2019t give as I slide down onto my side, facing him. One thing\u2019s sure; whoever designed the Folly didn\u2019t anticipate the crew sharing their sleep space, which seems a little shortsighted. Only centimeters separate us, then he drapes an arm over my waist, pulling me closer.</p> <p>\u201cLights off.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d know him in the dark. He always smells of citrus and a darker woodsy scent, like standing in a cedar forest at midnight. His heat washes over me, chin to shins, and my toes curl.</p><p>\u201cDo you ever think about him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHim who?\u201d March sounds drowsy. He runs a hand over my head, knotting his fingers in the coarse curls. But gently, like I have silken princess hair.</p><p>\u201cBaby-Z.\u201d</p><p>We\u2019ve never really talked about that night. It\u2019s about time we did if we intend to move on from it.</p><p>He stirs then, pushing up on one elbow. \u201cYou feel guilty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d That seems inadequate, but I don\u2019t have words to translate that moment where we knelt, mutually awed by the small miracle unfolding at our feet to how I felt when I realized I had splattered a helpless, living creature along with Canton Farr.</p><p>I don\u2019t know anything about what his life might\u2019ve been like, or how his parents may have felt when they awoke to find one of their young missing with no explanation. I don\u2019t even have the framework to grieve properly.</p><p>I squirm, sick with remembrance of my casual brutality. Beneath the guilt, I suffer the certainty I wouldn\u2019t have shot so fast if it had been a human child in Farr\u2019s arms. Deep down I\u2019m another thoughtless bigot who believes in human skin privilege. My life is worth more because I have a particular biochemistry? The realization repulses me.</p><p>And it devalues the heroism of someone who gave his life for me.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t absolve you,\u201d he says quietly. \u201cAll I know is, if it had been you on the ground, I\u2019d have done the same thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou feel this way a lot? Like nothing you do could be enough to make up for it.\u201d</p><p>In the half-light, his eyes go strange and distant, fringed in those impossible lashes. \u201cYou get used to it. And occasionally you run across something you can do to try to brighten up the dark places.\u201d</p><p>March doesn\u2019t say it, but I know that\u2019s why he feels like he needs to try twice as hard as anyone else. If he lets down his guard, he might go skidding down that slippery slope again. And maybe I won\u2019t recognize what comes out the other side.</p><p>\u201cThus you play the hero.\u201d</p><p>With a nod, he brushes his lips against my ear. Sparks just shimmer down my spine. This man\u2019s pure narcotic, delicious and addictive. Don\u2019t know how I thought I could walk away from him for good.</p><p>\u201cJax, I can\u2019t think about what I\u2019d do if something happened to you, if it had been you on that floor.\u201d His mouth compresses into a thin white line, and a shudder runs through him. \u201cYou just don\u2019t know...the things I\u2019ve done. What I\u2019m capable of. I hope you never do.\u201d</p><p>When he gets like this, he scares me a little. I run my fingers along his jaw, feeling the tension thrumming through him. That would be why he still keeps certain things partitioned when we\u2019re jacked in. I hope he trusts me enough to let me in, someday.</p><p>\u201cLet it go,\u201d I say quietly.</p><p>And realize the suggestion applies to me as well, but it\u2019s easier said than done. I can\u2019t just write off the guilt or stop wishing things were different. Neither can he. March acknowledges the rightness of my thought with a half smile.</p><p>Mary, I\u2019ve never had this kind of connection with anyone. How does he bear being part of me? Sometimes I can\u2019t stand myself.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry about baby-Z...he\u2019s just one more weight on me. If we hadn\u2019t gone to Marekeq, he\u2019d have hatched by now. Be living out his normal span. Instead, he\u2019s just a bunch of samples in Doc\u2019s database.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. But a hundred turns from now, baby-Z will be remembered. He\u2019s making a contribution. Maybe that will help, someday, when the academy is more than a dream.\u201d</p><p>I exhale against his throat in a long sigh and close my eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t imagine that would console his parents much. I wish we could tell them. Somehow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe we can. Somehow. Get some sleep, Jax. We can\u2019t fix anything right now.\u201d</p><p>March makes a good point. And I\u2019m flat busted, so I take his good advice.</p><p>Don\u2019t know how much later it is when I stir, finding myself wrapped tight in someone\u2019s arms. March. I\u2019m on the Folly again. It all comes back to me although I\u2019m not mad anymore. How can I be when I wanted this, deep down? I couldn\u2019t sleep for dreaming of him. To reassure myself that I\u2019m awake, I run my hand across his waist, finding the gap between shirt and slacks. I delight in dragging my nails lightly over his lower back and feeling him shiver. Goose bumps spring up wherever I touch.</p><p>His eyes open to slits, dark choclaste, golden caramel flecks. \u201cWhat\u2019re you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStroking you.\u201d I pillow my cheek on my forearm and continue inscribing patterns on his spine.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a pet,\u201d he murmurs. \u201cAnd you\u2019re making it hard to sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I?\u201d I smile and hook my thigh over his. The way I figure, it\u2019s time. Life-affirming ritual, seal unspoken promises to each other, and a lot of other psychobabble that boils down to wanting sex.</p><p>And I do. But it\u2019s more than that, this time. I needed the time away to reflect and heal, but I needed to come back, too, even if I would never have done it on my own.</p><p>\u201cYou know you are.\u201d</p><p>He skates his palm from its innocuous resting place between my shoulder blades to curl around my hip. The heat feels good, but it pales in comparison to the tingles that sparkle through me when March slides his hand lower, cupping my thigh. Deftly, he searches out nerves on my inner thigh, caressing through the thin fabric of my trousers. I squirm against him a little, not an intentional tease; I just can\u2019t help it.</p><p>Then he looks into my eyes. I register the silent question and nod, but as he tilts his head against mine, I realize I haven\u2019t said yes to what I intended. Thought he was going to strip me naked, but instead he comes inside me another way. My head\u2019s full of him, awash in sensual images I only half process as they amplify my arousal. My breasts ache, as if he\u2019s sucking them, and I feel hot, damp, between my thighs, so ready. He hasn\u2019t even touched me.</p><p>\u201cMarch...\u201d At that he shifts his head away, leaving me lonely and shuddering. \u201cWh-what did you do to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could bring you off that way,\u201d he whispers. \u201cJust me, inside your head.\u201d</p><p>Instinctively I know that\u2019s not an idle boast. He left me so close, panting on the precipice, and if he moves, I might lose it, grinding myself against him like I\u2019m in heat. The very idea wrenches a moan out of me.</p><p>\u201cHave you done that often?\u201d I\u2019m surprised at my tone.</p><p>Oh Mary, I hate the thought of him making anyone else feel this way.</p><p>But he shakes his head, a faint smile pulling at his mouth. \u201cTwo things make this possible. Our theta waves are compatible, and you\u2019re wide-open to me. Even untutored minds have basic shields that prevent such intrusion, Jax; it\u2019s a fundamental human trait. With other people, I skim the surface and only see their superficial thoughts. I\u2019ve never been...part of anyone before.\u201d He cups my cheek in his palm, long fingers stroking my temple. \u201cThat\u2019s what I want without you running away afterward. I want to fall asleep and know there\u2019s no place you\u2019d rather be.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I tremble, afraid to envision it. Though I know some pilots and jumpers do it jacked in, I always dismissed it as a kink. March doesn\u2019t need wetware, though. I find myself unable to resist the mental images, our bodies straining as he saturates my senses completely, no sense of self, drowning in mutual pleasure.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>I seek his mouth in the artificial darkness, finding it first with my fingertips. His lips part, a flicker of heat as he licks my skin. And I replace my hand with my lips, starving for him. This time I\u2019m the aggressor, nuzzling the tenderness of his mouth to taste him, explore the texture of a rough velvet tongue, the smooth bone of his teeth. His whiskers scrape my skin, contrasting to the softness of our mouths. I want to crawl inside him, devour him.</p><p>Can\u2019t remember feeling this way before.</p> <p>With a muffled groan, he rolls me beneath him, and I know a moment of pure euphoria. He can\u2019t resist, no matter what he said about it being too soon. I want everything he described, everything\u2014</p><p>Shakes.</p><p>So hard we tumble from the bunk and hit the floor, hard. March is good, but we\u2019re not even having sex yet, so I don\u2019t think I can claim the earth moved. Of all the Mary-sucking luck. I can\u2019t get my breath for a variety of reasons. He landed on top of me, and...I think he broke my rib.</p><p>\u201cShit, you okay?\u201d he asks, crawling off me.</p><p>The ship\u2019s alarm sounds on cue.</p> <p>CHAPTER 44</p><p>Lucky we aren\u2019t scrambling to get dressed as we stumble into the corridor.</p><p>The Folly listing like this can mean only one thing, and we take another hit as the four of us intersect in the hub. The bombardment continues. I smell something burning, and Dina looks...panicked. Never seen that expression before, so whatever\u2019s gone wrong, she can\u2019t fix it.</p><p>Shit.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got a breach,\u201d she says, breathless. \u201cCruised too close to New Terra, and now their Satellite Defense Installation is all over us. No surprise, we\u2019re on the shit list. Only thing we can do now is try to sneak into the atmosphere with the shuttle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t someone wake me before we got in range?\u201d March growls. \u201cI didn\u2019t plan on coming up to the front door and knocking!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t tell us to, you brainless hump.\u201d Dina glares at us both. \u201cBesides, you\u2019re the one who left it on autopilot to go roll around with Jax.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe only rolling came when we fell off the bed.\u201d That\u2019s probably an unnecessary correction, but trivia keeps me calm.</p><p>\u201cThere is no time for this,\u201d Doc says. \u201cI suggest we get to the shuttle immediately.\u201d</p><p>To think I could still be on Gehenna, wiping baby spit off my shoulder. I spare a thought for Adele and Domina, Mattin and Lleela, and for my lovely glastique flat. I want to go back; it\u2019s home. I want to make love with March there, so it feels like we\u2019re flying.</p><p>First we have to live through this, however.</p><p>Doc\u2019s logic can\u2019t be argued, so March answers, \u201cGet anything you need from quarters, only necessities, and meet back in two minutes. The shuttle\u2019s leaving in three. Move, people.\u201d</p><p>We spring into motion. In my case I\u2019m heading to quarters to grab a change of clothes and my PA. I just unpacked, dammit. It\u2019s hard to tell what I\u2019ve got, but I cram it all in the bag and move down the hall at a dead run. When I reach the hold, I see Dina waiting. She\u2019s got the doors open, and I regard the boxy little vessel dubiously.</p><p>\u201cHow the hell is this thing going to get us to the surface under fire?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt won\u2019t be fired on,\u201d she assures me. \u201cI can trick out the energy readings so our signal will be lost amid the big boom the Folly\u2019s going to make. Just got to time it right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you say so.\u201d I climb aboard and buckle myself into the second row of seats.</p><p>She follows, but she gets in front, choosing the copilot\u2019s chair. Better to make the techno-mojo, I suppose. My hands feel like I\u2019ve been squeezing squid, and my stomach keeps trying to push out my throat. If I hate terrestrial driving, then I hate shoe boxes like this ten times more. A kid on a scooter could take us out, let alone the kind of damage those SDIs are dealing.</p><p>March and Doc arrive simultaneously, although the geneticist frets as he clambers in beside me. \u201cI hope I retrieved all my data. Got the Mareq samples...but I\u2019ve discovered some unexpected links since I\u2019ve been studying your most recent scans\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up and strap in.\u201d Nice to know March doesn\u2019t reserve his charm for me alone.</p><p>\u201cYes, of course.\u201d Doc piles his things at his feet and complies as the larger ship feels like it\u2019s shaking to pieces around us.</p><p>\u201cLife support\u2019s online. We\u2019ve got maybe two hours before the air starts to go bad,\u201d Dina tells us, as if we didn\u2019t have enough to worry about.</p><p>\u201cGet the loading doors open, Dina. We\u2019re going for a ride.\u201d I\u2019m disgusted to detect a note of pure exhilaration in March\u2019s voice.</p><p>Swear to Mary, he thrives on adversity, and if that\u2019s the case, no wonder he wants me around. Where I used to be charmed, everything I touched turned to gold; since Matins IV, it\u2019s like I stepped through a witching mirror to the other side. But hey, at least March enjoys my jinx, right?</p><p>\u201cSure thing, boss.\u201d</p><p>As the doors swing open, I decide there\u2019s nothing scarier than seeing space with just a few centimeters of poly-metal alloy between you and horrible asphyxiation. However, there\u2019s a bright side. If we wind up out there, we\u2019ll only have about ten seconds to feel sorry for ourselves.</p><p>\u201cI give the poor girl thirty seconds,\u201d Dina says, hushed, like someone\u2019s dying.</p><p>At first I think she\u2019s talking about me, but then we almost seem to drift off the Folly. March uses power sparingly, and I glimpse the first hint of what Dina meant. With hull splintered, huge hunks of metal adrift, she looks like she\u2019s about to break in two. Yet the SDI fires with the relentless precision of a machine-driven attack.</p><p>I can\u2019t watch, so I squeeze my eyes shut. It feels like we\u2019re moving too slow; any minute the SDI could figure out that we\u2019re not wreckage. But maybe that\u2019s the key here, just as it is in nature. In my survival training, we learned never to run from a predator; it just makes it think you\u2019re something that should be chased.</p><p>At least my ribs stopped hurting\u2014nothing like adrenaline to cure what ails you.</p><p>\u201cNow,\u201d Dina orders. \u201cShe\u2019s going to pieces. Head for the surface!\u201d</p><p>In such a small craft I feel the speed especially in my stomach, and I become aware of Doc, gray-faced and sweating beside me. He lied to me, so why I should I care if he looks worse than I feel? But we\u2019re a team, whether I like it or not. Wordlessly I offer my hand, and he squeezes it as if he wants to make blood shoot out my fingertips.</p><p>We come screaming into the atmosphere like an angry comet. Did we leave a trail? Is anyone coming behind us going to be able to tell what happened? Any minute I expect the shuttle to shake apart, but March manages amid cursing that does Mair proud.</p><p>Dina monitors panels and sensors, muttering suggestions. \u201cEase up, dammit. You\u2019re going to burn out the stabilizers, and I don\u2019t think we want to test impact resistance in this thing.\u201d</p><p>He spares her a look. Not just a look, the look. \u201cYou want to fly this?\u201d</p><p>Huh, I\u2019m not the only one who gets that.</p><p>\u201cNo, but just remember\u2014\u201d</p><p>Oh, that noise can\u2019t be good.</p><p>\u201cTold you to ease up.\u201d She sounds so smug, considering that the shuttle wobbles like it wants to start spinning and not stop until we collide, hard, with the ground.</p><p>Although I\u2019m not an expert, I tend to prefer that doesn\u2019t happen. They bicker back and forth while Doc crushes the shit out of my hand. Maybe I believe too much in March, but I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to crash. Sure enough, even with the unsteady shimmy, side-to-side stir-fry action, he manages to slow the shuttle, skimming over the ground as he looks for a place to land.</p><p>March puts us down just before the stabilizers crackle for the last time. Doc staggers out as soon as the doors open, falls onto his hands and knees. I turn away so I don\u2019t have to see him getting sick. My stomach still feels shaky, and that\u2019s not helping. I step away, and then scrape a palm over my face. Time to take stock.</p><p>We\u2019re in the middle of a field.</p><p>If Old Terra is a ghetto world, an urban sprawl stripped of natural resources, then New Terra is its farm colony. Cities here are few and far between. I lived in New Boston, where my parents styled themselves \u201csociety,\u201d but this infinite expanse of golden grain boasts no landmarks. Overhead, the sky looms heavy and gray, indifferent, but the wind smells of damp earth and growing things, an echo of my childhood clear as a phantom with twin plaits and a handful of sweets.</p><p>\u201cSo where are we?\u201d Dina asks. To my vast exasperation, they all regard me with expectant expressions, even March, like I should be able to pinpoint our location via some native global positioning system.</p><p>\u201cNew Terra.\u201d</p><p>Doc straightens, wiping his mouth with the back of his hand. \u201cI believe she meant more specifically, Sirantha.\u201d</p><p>No shit? The man really has a penchant for stating the obvious. That\u2019s the trouble with geniuses; most of them seem to lack anything like a sense of humor, so they\u2019re forever \u201cclarifying\u201d for other people when they were, in fact, being smart-asses.</p><p>\u201cYou know it\u2019s been like sixteen years since I\u2019ve been here, right? And I wasn\u2019t a world traveler before I signed with the Corp, not that there\u2019s too much to see.\u201d I wave a hand at the vegetation, which, thanks to the wind, seems to wave back. \u201cBut it\u2019s definitely a Conglomerate world. The Corp has their home office here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d March says, \u201csince we can\u2019t fly the shuttle, we need to get some distance from it. I don\u2019t think we want to be found here if someone comes looking.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s the first sensible thing I\u2019ve heard. We have gray men and bounty hunters looking for us. Neither will stop until they bring us in, the former for order and honor, the latter for the payday. Now that we\u2019re stranded in enemy territory, shit\u2019s only going to get harder. March glances at me, smiling. He really does love this.</p><p>Dina shrugs. \u201cIf we\u2019re going, let\u2019s go. We\u2019re burning daylight.\u201d</p><p>I sling my bag over my shoulder while Doc fidgets with various bits of gear. What he took to be essential seems like a lot more than what the rest of us grabbed.</p><p>My stomach growls. Can\u2019t remember when I ate last. Jump-travel has a way of lagging the shit out of your biosystems. \u201cDid anyone think to snag some rations?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a week\u2019s worth of paste.\u201d March doesn\u2019t look delighted by the prospect, though, and he\u2019s the survival specialist.</p><p>\u201cPerfect,\u201d Saul says, all loaded up. Good thing he\u2019s strong; he\u2019ll need to be. \u201cIt could always be worse, hm?\u201d he adds, sounding determinedly cheerful.</p><p>Nobody responds to that, but before we walk ten meters, it starts to rain.</p><p>CHAPTER 45 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>March is the only one who brought bivouac.</p><p>Like I said, he\u2019s the survival expert. Doc packed all his lab gear, various scanners and samplers, other stuff I don\u2019t know the names for, while Dina brought her tools. As for me, I grabbed my favorite shoes and clean underwear. What can I say, some of my mother\u2019s lessons stuck, although I refuse to put my hair up, and I haven\u2019t worn a dress in almost twenty years.</p><p>If she had her way, I\u2019d have a vanilla husband and a dignified career as an art dealer, selling to the cultured at an exorbitant price. Instead, I\u2019m plodding through a field, lost, while my belly chews through my backbone. For a fleeting moment I wonder what the life I left behind would\u2019ve been like. Just as quickly I dismiss the curiosity; I\u2019d have choked to death in their world.</p><p>We walk until true sunset. I pause, gazing up at the streaked sky, tear trails of scarlet blurred over cobalt. Damn, haven\u2019t seen one of those since we left Lachion, though I\u2019m not sure how long ago that was. I wonder how Keri is faring among the clans, whether she\u2019s married the Gunnar yet. Nobody says much as we set camp near a scrubby copse of trees that exist only to demarcate one field from another.</p> <p>The rain subsides into a miserable mist, drizzling down through our clothes until we\u2019re all irascible. Dinner takes all of thirty seconds, but my mood improves marginally when I see Doc and Dina wrap up in rain slickers and bed down on the wet ground. Seems like I may end up the same way since all I have is clean underwear, but then I see March beckoning me from the mouth of his sleep cylinder. This thing only holds one person, but I manage to wriggle in beside him. He fastens the end up, and we elbow each other more than once in getting settled.</p><p>As he pulls me close, I hear Dina grumble, \u201cShit, I\u2019d sleep with him to get out of this weather.\u201d</p><p>Into the silence, Doc stage-whispers, \u201cSo would I.\u201d</p><p>I break down as March calls back, \u201cNo thanks, I\u2019m good.\u201d</p><p>Guess I am crazy because even though I have no earthly reason to believe things are going to work out, right now I\u2019m happy. Maybe I\u2019m like March, and I thrive under less than-ideal circumstances. What a fragging understatement.</p> <p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t make me listen to you shagging,\u201d Dina cracks. I hear Doc laughing, like this is an adult sleepover. \u201cThe rain\u2019s bad enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just jealous you didn\u2019t get me while you had the chance,\u201d I shoot back, before March shushes me with a kiss.</p><p>But there\u2019s no room for anything else, even if we were so inclined, and I\u2019m not. Though I\u2019m fine with the other two knowing about March and me in the abstract, I don\u2019t get into V&amp;E. My kinks are pretty tame, come to that. His body heat warms me, and I fall asleep listening to him breathe.</p><p>In the morning, it\u2019s more paste and some bitching for breakfast. No surprise that I bear the brunt of it because I just thought to check my PA. As it turns out, 245 does, in fact, possess a navigation system, even if I don\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cGreetings, Sirantha Jax. It has been six days since your last entry.\u201d Do I detect a trace of censure in 245\u2019s synthesized tone? I\u2019m telling you, this little gadget is not like other AIs.</p><p>\u201cSorry about that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAre you still having the dreams? Would you like to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr, no. Let\u2019s not talk about that.\u201d My cheeks burn as I try to shut the machine up. Yeah, I talked to 245 when I was on Gehenna. I cringe, remembering the way I rambled about March. \u201cCan you figure out where we are? I saw that you have\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat world is this, Sirantha Jax? I possess the ability to calculate geographic location based on latitude and longitude, but I need to assimilate certain local parameters to ensure accurate computation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNew Terra.\u201d I give the same answer as yesterday, but it offers significantly different results this time.</p><p>\u201cAccording to my best estimate,\u201d 245 says modestly, \u201cthe nearest settlement lies eighteen kilometers north-northwest. Unless I have erred, this would be Maha City.\u201d</p><p>Shit.</p><p>I can see in their faces, they have no idea what that means. But we\u2019re halfway across the continent from New Boston. \u201cThanks, 245. See you later.\u201d With that, I snap the sphere shut, only to notice the way the others are staring at me. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s your best friend, huh?\u201d Dina smirks at me.</p> <p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s you, sweetness.\u201d</p><p>I make like I\u2019m going to hug her, and she shuts up real quick. She even backs away like I\u2019m dangerous, deranged, or diseased. Doc glances up from organizing his gear to offer a half smile. He\u2019s been too quiet.</p><p>\u201cNot a bad hike.\u201d March tips his head back, assessing the clouds.</p><p>I could tell him it\u2019s not going to rain. Today, the sun beats down on us from a pure blue sky, drying up the muddy patches. Even the grain glitters in the distance, throwing golden sparks row to row with each ripple of the wind. But it is going to get hot.</p><p>Sighing, I say, \u201cLet\u2019s see how far we get then.\u201d</p><p>Nightfall finds me exhausted and bitchy, although the other three hold up better. March wants to press on. Doc and Dina don\u2019t seem to care, irritatingly solid, both of them, so I drag my feet and mumble. I feel sweaty and wilted; my scalp itches, and every exposed inch of skin has been stung or bitten by something. We\u2019ve passed several farms and outbuildings, but we agree that it\u2019s a bad idea to linger where strangers must be scarce. So I suck it up and keep going, but I draw the line when I overhear the whispered conversation taking place as the first city lights come into view.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s got to,\u201d Dina murmurs, low. \u201cYou know she\u2019s the one they\u2019re looking for, and with all that hair\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about my hair?\u201d I stop in alarm, gathering the wild mass in both hands.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know that it matters,\u201d Doc says with a strange, tight smile.</p><p>My eyes go to March, who produces a wicked-looking knife. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Jax.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! Come on, I can...\u201d But I come up with nothing, so I bend my head dumbly, the sacrificial goat.</p><p>I\u2019m not brave. As March starts hacking, my vision blurs, and I can\u2019t help but sniffle. I don\u2019t remember the last time I had my hair cut; it\u2019s my trademark. Maybe it\u2019s frizzy, unruly, wild as an Anduvian ice otter, but it\u2019s me\u2014</p><p>And that is exactly why it has to be shorn.</p><p>But he\u2019s not content just to slice it short. I start when I feel the blade scraping across my skull. \u201cWhat the frag\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll help you pass for a boy,\u201d Dina explains. She takes a closer look then and gives me a roguish grin. \u201cOr a really cute butch. Rawr. Er, anyway, try to keep your head down until we can do something about those eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with my eyes?!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re memorable,\u201d March says, wiping the blade on his thigh.</p><p>Sweet, but it doesn\u2019t make me feel one bit better about being bald. The wind feels too cold against my naked scalp, and I run my fingers over the rough shave with a pained little whimper. I think I might cry.</p><p>\u201cFor Mary\u2019s sake,\u201d Dina grumbles, \u201cit\u2019s just hair. It\u2019ll grow back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant me to shave yours?\u201d I growl at her.</p><p>She shrugs. \u201cIf it\u2019ll shut you up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet us give them a moment.\u201d Doc guides her away, probably whispering that she needs sensitivity training.</p><p>March bends his head to mine, kissing me in a delicate brush of warmth. \u201cYou\u2019re gorgeous. All that hair hiding such beautiful bones, I can\u2019t believe it.\u201d</p><p>Though I know he\u2019s bullshitting me, trying to smooth me past the desire to throw a fit, it helps. \u201cYou\u2019re so full of it.\u201d</p><p>March shakes his head, solemn as a barrister. \u201cNo, really. You might even look better this way.\u201d I narrow my eyes on him, knotting my fist in his shirt. \u201cToo much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, yeah.\u201d</p><p>After lacing our fingers together, he leads me toward the others. Maha City twinkles against the dark, glints of scarlet and silver snaking together as if to form a cogent image. We\u2019re just not high enough to appreciate the art.</p><p>\u201cSo who are you, Jax?\u201d I see him smiling, teeth gleaming in the moonlight. Oh, he\u2019s teasing me, but his comeuppance is nigh. \u201cMy little brother?\u201d</p><p>I shrug, studiedly casual. \u201cThat\u2019s not what you need to worry about.\u201d</p><p>His thumb slides over my index finger in a soft, proprietary caress. \u201cAnd what would that be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeing the guy who wants to shag your own little brother.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve gotten the last word with March.</p><p>CHAPTER 46</p><p>Our credits are running low.</p><p>I made enough to get by on Gehenna, but Outskirts currency possesses no exchange value on Conglomerate worlds. Keri could wire us funds, as Lachion is nominally a Corp world, but it would link her to us, and that\u2019s something we need to avoid, considering our infamy. If anyone suspected them of bankrolling our activities, that would be the end. So I\u2019m not sure how we\u2019re going to pay for somewhere to stay, or how we\u2019re supposed to make our way all the way to New Boston.</p><p>Worry nags me like a frigid wife. We can\u2019t take public transport because I can\u2019t use official stations. It would be disastrous if I tried to travel using my own identity, and it would take both creds and connections to acquire a good forgery. And we don\u2019t know anyone except my parents, and it\u2019s not like I can ask them for help. If they\u2019re alive, they\u2019re mortified at how low I\u2019ve sunk and are telling everyone they aren\u2019t related to me. I don\u2019t realize I\u2019m scowling until March smooths the lines from between my brows.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll figure something out,\u201d he assures me softly.</p><p>Maha City spins out in concentric rings. At the center lies the posh upscale area, including the business district, the metropolitan museum, and the municipal center. I gleaned that much from looking at the map 245 showed me, but what I didn\u2019t realize is that the farther you go from the city center, the worse it gets.</p><p>We pass through shantytown first, hovels scraped together from spare parts and scrap metal. A dog sits in the road, gazing at us with uncanny eyes. Its lips curl back from its muzzle, and it growls deep in its throat as we pass by. The only vehicles seem derelict, rusted, and we find a family asleep when we peer inside.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather camp than look for a room here.\u201d Dina speaks for all of us, for once.</p><p>\u201cI thought the Corp promised prosperity for everyone.\u201d The skin on the back of my neck prickles, as if we\u2019re being watched. As we continue deeper into the city, I feel glad that from my silhouette and shaven head, I look like a boy although that wouldn\u2019t discourage the determined.</p><p>\u201cOnly in advertisements,\u201d March murmurs.</p><p>A yawn that crackles my jaw overtakes me, the sort that leaves your eyes watering, but we can\u2019t rest until we find a safe place. Dying in our sleep won\u2019t solve anything in the long run, even if a nihilist would argue it\u2019s coming down the pike at some point anyway, so we might as well embrace it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The moon hangs over us, bloated, gibbous, and yellow\u2014its beams look tainted as they slide over the corrugated shelters in rivers of oily light. We trudge along until the streets start getting brighter, and we\u2019re greeted with a collage of low-slung buildings, flophouses and speakeasies. Distant, mellifluous notes slink toward us in the dark like melancholy whores.</p><p>No structure stands over two stories tall, as if they squat here in fear of giants that tear such hubris down, but an acrid smell hangs heavy in the air, declaring the machinery functional. We\u2019re unlikely to do better at this time of night. So we turn at random into a white building with a sign that proclaims with laconic largesse: rooms.</p><p>We transact business with a greasy man wearing a shirt stained with a week\u2019s worth of dinners and armpit sweat. Hair bristles from his face in a porcine fashion, and his grunts as we pay for our rooms reinforce that impression. He handles our rental through a metal grill, densely woven, only a slot large enough to slide a credit stick through at the bottom.</p><p>\u201cTwelve, fourteen, and sixteen, down toward the end. There\u2019s a communal san-shower, last door.\u201d He manages to speak without moving his mouth, without making eye contact. Just as well because I\u2019m not supposed look at people until I get some tinted lenses.</p> <p>This isn\u2019t the sort of place where they ask for names or identification, and I\u2019m glad to go. The office smells of rancid meat and human sweat, loneliness and despair. Back outside, we follow the broken walk, counting the prefab housing units until we find ours. These rooms don\u2019t have palm locks because that would require configuration technology. He\u2019s given us three digits that open the metal tumbler latching the door, and there\u2019s no telling how many others know it.</p><p>\u201cBe careful,\u201d I tell Dina and Doc, as they go on to their rooms.</p><p>She laughs. \u201cAnything that comes in on me tonight better be prepared to die.\u201d</p><p>March pauses at the door, spinning the numerals until I hear a snick. The room revealed barely qualifies for the name, squeaking in by virtue of its four walls and ceiling. No windows, no san facilities, no furniture, there\u2019s just the ragged sleep-mat that appears to be affixed to the floor.</p><p>I flash him a wry smile. \u201cNo wonder I like you. Since you take me to such nice places, and you do hair, too.\u201d</p> <p>He has the grace to show chagrin as he runs a hand over my bare scalp. \u201cI really am sorry, Jax. But it was for the best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. You want the shower?\u201d</p><p>Shaking his head, he drops his bag, then kisses the tip of my nose. \u201cYou take the first one. It\u2019s only fair, considering what I\u2019ve put you through. I might sack out, though, if you take more than five minutes.\u201d He gives me a sleepy smile.</p><p>There\u2019s the fist again, squeezing at my heart. Shit, I don\u2019t want to feel like this, but sometimes, sometimes the man can be so sweet. It\u2019s getting harder to remember what an asshole he can be. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t wait to be clean, so I head for the san-shower. It\u2019s black in here, stale, sour air that smells as if it blows upward from sinister, sulfuric places in the earth. I bump the door shut behind me with my hip, and I\u2019m immediately sorry.</p><p>\u201cLights on.\u201d</p> <p>Standing here in the dark convinces me the facilities must be manual, so I fumble around, hearing my own breathing. My heart resounds in my ears as I find the switch. Sudden illumination. I swallow a shriek as a swarm of chittering insects scuttle across the floor and out of sight. Being dirty seems much less objectionable, but I refuse to concede defeat. So I close my eyes and scrub up, amazed at how fast it goes without hair to wash.</p><p>I dress quickly, watching my feet for the return of those creepy things. Crunchy bugs make the inside of my stomach shudder. Shouldering my bag, I step out onto the walk, flick the switch, then shut the door behind me.</p><p>My heart gives a wild thump as Doc steps out of the shadows. Right, he\u2019s in room 16, the last before the shower. But I thought I heard the murmur of him talking to someone, although I don\u2019t see anyone else around.</p><p>\u201cYou scared me.\u201d</p><p>Mary, he looks so strange in this light, something about the way the moon shines his eyes, almost blind but feral. I feel the same unease as I did aboard the Folly, after I discovered his deception.</p><p>\u201cDid I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I back up a step, wrestling with an irrational instinct telling me to run.</p><p>\u201cIntuition is an interesting thing,\u201d he says. \u201cSometimes it gives us cues that cannot be explained by logic. Don\u2019t you find that to be the case, Sirantha?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDoc wouldn\u2019t have lied to me.\u201d I take another step back, finding myself flush against the building. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t. Who are you?\u201d</p><p>In a movement so fast I can\u2019t track it, the creature whips an arm around my throat. \u201cExcellent. I\u2019m tired of this skin.\u201d His flesh seems to liquefy, then it sloughs away to reveal a bony carapace with black holes where the eyes should be. The creature\u2019s body elongates, no longer short and stocky. \u201cSo cramped and limiting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a Slider,\u201d I breathe.</p><p>I\u2019ve heard of them, so dubbed because they can slide into someone else\u2019s life seamlessly. They\u2019re the best bounty hunters in the known universe, native to Ithiss-Tor, but who expects ever to meet one? They\u2019re rare like chi-masters and glass-dancers. I should feel flattered that the Corp set one on me. Instead, my stomach knots, and my palms start to sweat.</p><p>\u201cAn unflattering designation.\u201d Its mandible flexes, a sign of displeasure, undoubtedly. \u201cYou were so cooperative, coming to New Terra with me like this.\u201d</p><p>Shit.</p><p>\u201cM-maybe we could cut a deal\u2014\u201d I try to stall, find out what it wants most. Maybe someone will come out and surprise it. If I scream, will it kill me? Am I worth more dead or alive? I fragging wish I knew.</p><p>\u201cHow much do you care for them?\u201d it whispers. \u201cIf you refuse to accompany me to the rendezvous point, my associates will descend on this place and kill everyone for the inconvenience. But if you cooperate, I will let them go. There is no bounty on them, and I care nothing for this \u2018project,\u2019 although the doctor\u2019s research is...interesting. However, I have not been hired to safeguard Farwan\u2019s interests, only to retrieve you.\u201d</p><p>I feel its claw tracing a caress across my throat.</p><p>CHAPTER 47</p><p>My bag slips from my fingers.</p><p>When they discover it, they\u2019ll know something is wrong. Whether that will help me in any fashion, I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s clear that I have to go with him, however. I have a better chance of survival if I cooperate. Maybe I can escape from the Corp facility. Maybe I can escape en route, but if I struggle or scream, this Slider will slit my throat. I could rouse the others, but I\u2019d be dead before they could help me. Backed by a long, proud history of not-dying, I know when someone\u2019s serious.</p><p>Beyond all that, I won\u2019t let him miss the rendezvous. I won\u2019t permit these bastards to descend on Dina and March. I think this is the only semiselfless thing I\u2019ve ever done in my life.</p><p>\u201cTime is money, Sirantha.\u201d The talon on my jugular depresses, and I swallow, feeling my pulse pound like I\u2019m prey.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>Can\u2019t wonder what happened to Doc.</p><p>\u201cA wise choice.\u201d It snaps something around my wrist. \u201cIf you move more than two hundred meters from the control device on my belt, the slave bracelet will detonate. I have never taken a target foolish enough to test it, but I understand it does significant structural damage to the human form. Let us depart. I am sure you are no more eager to linger in my company than I am to have you.\u201d</p><p>The broken walk leads us away from rented rooms and silent sleepers. I follow him, docile as a pet. That scrapes against the grain. Now that his claw\u2019s off my throat, I picture myself killing him, removing the belt and taking it with me until I can get the bracelet off, but...that doesn\u2019t solve my immediate problem, even if I could get the best of him, which I doubt, unless I strike while he\u2019s asleep. Regardless, I still have to protect Dina and March, and I can\u2019t see any way to do that except by going to the Slider ship.</p><p>March. What if he thinks I ran again? I know I don\u2019t have a rep for being reliable, not like him. Former acquaintances would say, \u201cSirantha Jax values her own ass above all others.\u201d But I didn\u2019t leave you because I wanted to, baby. Not this time.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I mutter. \u201cI don\u2019t imagine you\u2019re any worse than the Corp.\u201d</p><p>The thing makes a curious sound in its throat. \u201cYou are a strange woman.\u201d I can identify the tone as amusement, so that noise must have been laughter.</p><p>\u201cNot the first time I\u2019ve heard that.\u201d Maybe I should be terrified, but so far as I understand, Sliders are pragmatic. If I don\u2019t give it any trouble, it\u2019s going to turn me over to the Corp in one piece. Of course what comes afterward will probably make me wish I was dead. \u201cSo what should I call you?\u201d</p><p>Beside me, its movements strike me as distinctively mantislike. \u201cWhy must you call me anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a person,\u201d I say, trying to sound reasonable as every moment moves us farther away. \u201cSo am I. There\u2019s no reason we shouldn\u2019t keep this civil.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are not a person, you are my captured quarry. But you may call me Velith if it pleases you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you.\u201d I\u2019m determined to be polite. Maybe if I\u2019m nice enough, I can make it feel guilty about turning me over to the Corp. And maybe Mother Mary will descend from heaven to deliver me. If I\u2019m going to hang my fate on an impossible hook, then I may as well dream big. \u201cSo what\u2019s it like on Ithiss-Tor? I\u2019ve never been. Your people don\u2019t encourage tourism.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I suppose they do not,\u201d he agrees, but his pitch disturbs me. I hear dual harmonics that make me feel as though I am listening to more than one entity. \u201cAs for the homeworld, I have not returned in many years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you believe our relationship is such that I shall confide in you, Sirantha Jax, you are much mistaken. Now keep silent.\u201d</p><p>Velith picks a careful path back toward the shantytown. Appears we\u2019re not going deeper into Maha City, which make sense. Nobody notes the comings and goings out here. If nothing else, there\u2019s a certain freedom in abject poverty, I suppose. When we reach a truly impressive junkyard, he pauses and activates one of the devices I didn\u2019t recognize. It glows gold, and then there\u2019s an answering hum from a ship well concealed among the derelicts.</p><p>\u201cSeems your associates are punctual,\u201d I observe unnecessarily.</p><p>\u201cIt is one of their few redeeming qualities.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat good, huh? I can\u2019t wait to meet them. Bet you\u2019re a bundle of charm in comparison, the \u2018face\u2019 man of the organization.\u201d</p><p>He\u2014she?\u2014makes the odd choking noise again. \u201cYou are not what I expected, based on the holo-footage and the dossier Farwan provided.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not really the blow-up-a-space-station type. More likely to kill a carafe of Parnassian red and flash my tits. Or...I used to be. Not much of that, lately.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI recommend you keep your chest covered on board. My associates are more likely to take it as an invitation to dine than as a mating overture.\u201d</p><p>Shit.</p><p>\u201cYou mean they aren\u2019t more\u2014\u201d I break off before I can piss Velith off by calling his race Sliders again. Trouble is, I can\u2019t recall the respectful term. Theirs is an obscure world, seldom studied in our exoanthropology courses, not that I ever took such a thing.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he says dryly, as if I\u2019m an idiot for envisioning a crew comprised of Sliders. \u201cBut you will see for yourself, soon enough.\u201d</p> <p>As if on cue, the doors flip up with a soft hiss of decompression. Slim and sleek, shining with ultrachrome, the ship appears to be a Silverfish, good for them, bad for me, as it\u2019s the fastest transplanetary vessel available today. Once I climb aboard I\u2019ll be delivered to Corp headquarters in Ankaraj in less than two hours.</p><p>Velith curls his hand around my unshackled wrist, and I\u2019m surprised to find that his palm feels leathery but not unpleasant. The chitin of his face gives me the crawlies since I can\u2019t stand insects with a hard carapace, the way they crunch when you step on them...Oh Mary. A shudder runs through me.</p><p>He glances back, seeming to misinterpret my reaction. \u201cYou have nothing to fear from me, Sirantha. You have comported yourself as a model captive, and I will deliver you to your destination unharmed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not you I\u2019m worried about,\u201d I answer truthfully, as we board via three small steps that flip down from the low-slung craft.</p><p>\u201cThat is...most unusual.\u201d</p> <p>I think I\u2019ve managed to surprise him. Looking like that, no doubt he\u2019s used to people pissing themselves once he sheds his human skin. I wonder if he can smell the acrid tang of terror, whether our emotions manifest to him in the olfactory spectrum. If so, it probably tells him something about his prisoner\u2019s intended course of action, and I would do well to remember that. A jump in my adrenaline levels might communicate itself to him in some fashion, warning him I\u2019m about to try something.</p><p>Sighing, because I truly needed something else to worry about, I take stock of my surroundings. The interior of a Silverfish is cramped, not intended for extended use. I count ten seats and five of them are filled.</p><p>\u201cMother Mary,\u201d I breathe. \u201cYour crew is made up of\u2014\u201d Velith claps a claw across my mouth as a growl goes up from the fanged collective. It occurs to me that they would find the term derogatory.</p><p>Glad he didn\u2019t let me say it.</p><p>\u201cYes. As you noted earlier, I am the charming one. So I suggest we get under way before you precipitate a problem.\u201d</p><p>One of them squeezes my arm as I walk by; it\u2019s not a warning or a cruelty so much as...well, testing my flesh for texture, I suppose. To them, I must look like dinner on the heel. No wonder Velith told me to keep myself covered, although breasts wouldn\u2019t be as tasty as they look, all glands and fat.</p> <p>Velith hisses and chitters, gesturing with both claws and mandible. What I take to be an argument ensues; maybe his crew wants to eat my extremities before delivering me? If I arrive alive but truncated, that would still fulfill the terms of their contract. Finally, one of the Morgut straightens its lower limbs and skitters upright. I find the movement both horrifying and hypnotic. This is a creature, who by all evolutionary standards, should not exist, and it\u2019s heading for the cockpit.</p><p>How the hell am I going to get out of this?</p><p>\u201cJust a misunderstanding,\u201d Velith assures me, as he sinks into a seat with the mantis motion that seems comforting compared to the appalling otherness I discern among the Morgut. That\u2019s human slang: We named them so for their insatiable appetite...more gut than anything else. They are the stuff of terror vids and bedtime stories told each other by children in hushed, gleeful whispers.</p><p>He pats the space next to him, surreal but cordial. \u201cMake yourself comfortable, Sirantha. This will all be over shortly.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, that\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m afraid of.</p><p>CHAPTER 48</p><p>I manage to sit beside Velith quietly for all of ten minutes.</p><p>The inside of the vessel carries a strange sweet-and-sour tang. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s an odor given off by the Morgut or a food source concealed somewhere. It\u2019s all I can do to keep from staring over my shoulder at them, but I don\u2019t want to show interest, either.</p> <p>As a species, they\u2019re intelligent but savage, seldom seen on human worlds, primarily because they view us as a delicacy. Gehenna is the most liberal of ports, but after constant incident reports, they became the last non-Conglomerate world to restrict Morgut travel. Here on New Terra, they used to require a permit and a trainer sworn to control them and assume liability for their damages. That sums Farwan Corporation up right there. They don\u2019t care about loss of life, just property damage.</p><p>\u201cHow come they don\u2019t eat you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t need to turn his head to glance at me. The disconcerting placement of his eyes permits him to study me at his leisure. I\u2019m almost accustomed to the insectile quality of his mannerisms, but I can\u2019t figure out how he manages to speak universal. Maybe he has a vocalizer implanted; that would seem to make sense.</p><p>\u201cThe Morgut\u2019ll eat anything. How can you work with them safely?\u201d</p><p>His mandible twitches. \u201cMy body chemistry renders me poisonous to them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. That\u2019s convenient. I guess they make incredible enforcers. Strike terror into the hearts of hardened criminals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He inclines his head. \u201cThough it is occasionally difficult to persuade them that our bounties would not be better served with a sweet glaze and mixed fruit.\u201d</p><p>I grin a bit. \u201cWas that a joke?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to know, were you the ones who chased us into grimspace?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour pilot is good,\u201d Velith says. \u201cThe ghosts were clever and made tracking you exceedingly difficult.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t suppose\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Go to sleep, Sirantha.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should have known you weren\u2019t Doc,\u201d I mutter. \u201cHe never calls me Sirantha. And he doesn\u2019t need me to hold his hand during a landing, and he doesn\u2019t suffer from motion sickness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did not interpret him well? I adjudged him a scholarly individual, a beta male, who would behave with some timidity in certain situations.\u201d He reacts like a vid-actor being advised his performance was over the top.</p><p>\u201cYou did all right faking the science stuff, although it helps that none of us have a clue what he\u2019s talking about half the time, but for personality, no. Not even close.\u201d I sigh, tallying up all the inconsistencies. \u201cWhere is he, by the way?\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t want to believe he\u2019s dead. Nutty as it might sound, I sort of like this Slider. I don\u2019t doubt he\u2019d kill if it were necessary, but I\u2019m beginning to get a sense of his intellect. He prefers to think his way around problems.</p><p>Velith lifts one jointed shoulder in a fair approximation of a shrug. \u201cI left him in a storage locker. I would surmise he has gotten out by now in some fashion.\u201d</p><p>No wonder he pushed to get us off Gehenna as soon as possible. Some of the tension eases out of my shoulders, but then I realize I have something else to worry about. \u201cThat stuff you said about the lesions...did you make that up?\u201d</p><p>He hesitates. \u201cI...examined all the data and Dr. Solaith\u2019s notes, but I am not a scientist, and I needed you to jump to New Terra. The Morgut could not pass on Gehenna for obvious reasons, and I feared I would require their assistance to subdue you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy in the hell would you think that?\u201d I put my hand to my head, meaning to mess with my hair as I tend to do when I\u2019m nervous, but I find nothing but rough skin. Fragging bastard, no wonder he said it didn\u2019t matter if I shaved my head, and now I\u2019m bald for nothing.</p><p>\u201cYou are a cunning and dangerous woman, Sirantha, wanted on every Conglomerate world for mass murder and wanton acts of terrorism.\u201d</p><p>Shit. From his point of view, he\u2019s the good guy, and it\u2019s astonishing he has been this polite to me. How ironic; it speaks well of him. I wish I had 245 with me; she could probably figure something out. But she\u2019s in the bag I dropped outside the san-shower.</p><p>Has March found it yet? Do they know I\u2019m missing?</p><p>Desperation laces my voice. I\u2019ve got less than an hour to think my way out of this. \u201cDid it ever occur to you to that the Corp is guilty of disseminating false information? I\u2019m the only survivor from the Sargasso but I didn\u2019t do that. The landing authority used override codes on our vessel and supplied incorrect coordinates, the wrong trajectory. They fragging engineered that crash.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvery convict claims he is innocent.\u201d</p><p>I nod. Every scum-sucking lowlife he\u2019s captured has probably begged and pleaded, professing his innocence. I\u2019m just one more in a long line; tough shit for me that in my case it\u2019s actually true. For the first time in my life, I can\u2019t see a way out.</p><p>He\u2019ll deliver me to the Corp, where they\u2019ll turn me over to Unit Psych Newel, who will work on me until I\u2019m broken, until I confess to anything they want: Matins IV and DuPont Station, who knows what else. After all this, forget Whitefish, they\u2019re going to execute me. And the Corp comes off squeaky clean.</p><p>I can\u2019t fucking stand it. And then I realize there\u2019s another way. It goes against all my instincts, but my back\u2019s to the wall, and I will not let them win. There\u2019s one last act of defiance I can offer.</p><p>\u201cAt the hostel, would you have killed me if I screamed?\u201d My voice sounds hoarse, urgent, and he turns his head then.</p><p>His mandibles flex as if he finds the question impolite. \u201cYes. Then your associates would have rushed to your aid too late; mine would have descended on the place like locusts. A messy situation, best avoided.\u201d</p><p>Then I accomplished what I intended, saved Dina and March. Huh, so this is what altruism feels like. It chafes a bit. But I can\u2019t let myself think about March, or I won\u2019t have the strength to continue. I force the words out before I think better of them.</p><p>\u201cPlease...if you\u2019d have done it then, do me this kindness. Do it now. Feed me to the Morgut afterward, I don\u2019t care. Just don\u2019t turn me over to the Corp alive.\u201d</p><p>Velith clicks his claws together, a sound I interpret as exasperation. \u201cI am not a murderer, Sirantha. I kill when I am presented with no viable alternative.\u201d</p><p>Wouldn\u2019t you know it? A bounty hunter with a conscience. That\u2019s it then. I\u2019m out of ideas. Then my eyes light on the bracelet he slapped on my wrist. When we get off the ship, I can try to run, hope to reach two hundred meters out before I\u2019m caught. Don\u2019t know whether I\u2019m fast enough to manage it. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m brave enough to do that to myself on purpose.</p><p>But if I run, I might incite their predatory instincts. The Morgut might eviscerate me. And as far as I\u2019m concerned, that\u2019s preferable to returning to a cell, going back to Psych Officer Newel. There comes a time when speculation ceases to matter and all planning comes down to instinct. Thinking has never been my strong suit anyhow. I just need to\u2014 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Grab Velith\u2019s arm and slash his claws across my forearm. He scrambles out of his seat like he thinks he\u2019s under attack; I\u2019m finally showing my true colors, the crazed killer the Corp has painted me. But by the time he figures it out, it\u2019s too late. I work my thumb feverishly over the vein just beneath my elbow, and the blood really starts to flow.</p><p>It drips down my forearm and over my fingertips, crimson drops spattering the ki-pants I put on after my shower, intending to curl up next to March. The blood looks dark and obscene against the pale fabric, living art.</p><p>\u201cWhat is the matter with you?\u201d I can tell by his tone that he doesn\u2019t understand. Not surprising, this isn\u2019t something a sane person would do.</p><p>His long, thin body blocks the path to the cockpit, as if I would try to take over the ship. That\u2019s fine; it even works in my favor, as I\u2019m heading the other way. Bracing my palms on the back of the seat, I bounce over, then it\u2019s clear to where the four Morgut sit, conversing in a low chitter.</p> <p>Deliberately I draw my arm back and fan it across their faces. All four of them draw back as if struck; and then, as one, forked tongues flick out to sample my flavor. Watching their faces, seeing how the slit-pupil eyes dilate with a different sort of lust, I feel like I could puke, but instead, I murmur, \u201cGood? Want more?\u201d</p><p>And all hell breaks loose.</p><p>CHAPTER 49</p><p>I expect to die.</p><p>When the first Morgut launches itself at me, I don\u2019t even flinch. The others follow in a fury, but I simply squeeze my eyes shut and stand my ground. But instead of going down beneath a wave of rending limbs, Velith shoves me behind him. I have no idea what\u2019s going on in his head, but he pushes me back so hard that I overbalance, slamming my head against the seat.</p> <p>My vision fills with little flecks of light as I hit the floor. I hear grunts, sounds of scuffling, and weapon fire as if through a tunnel. Feel something hot and viscous spattering my face. I could crawl under the seats. Wait. Instead I push to my hands and knees, dizzy and nauseous. I don\u2019t know how much blood I\u2019ve lost.</p><p>When I force my eyes open, the ridge along my brow throbs; maybe I hit my face on something on the way down. The carnage astonishes me. Of the five, only Velith\u2019s left standing, but he looks really fragged up. Two of the Morgut bodies are still convulsing, pestilent ooze boiling out of their wounds.</p><p>\u201cWhy? Why did you do that?\u201d We voice the question in unison, although we\u2019re asking vastly different things.</p><p>\u201cAll I wanted was to die,\u201d I whisper. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you let me? You still get paid.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s bleeding in four places that I can see, a thin, delicate stream. Thought his blood would look different, but Vel is more like me than the Morgut. He\u2019s not a monster.</p><p>His claws click together, and it makes me feel his agitation. \u201cI captured you alive, Sirantha. Never has a target been slain while in my charge, and no one is going to sully my impeccable record, not you, not them. Now sit down and shut up before I am tempted to see how much damage you can survive.\u201d</p> <p>The Silverfish slows. Even though it\u2019s a graceful descent, I feel the lessening altitude in my belly and in the way my knees bend slightly as if gravity asserts more influence closer to the ground. Don\u2019t know whether we\u2019ve reached Corp headquarters or if the pilot heard the commotion, but I\u2019m betting on the latter.</p><p>A low, unpleasant noise comes over the comm system, and Velith cocks his head, listening. \u201cNo. Nicht. Do not come back here. Everything is fine. Keep going.\u201d Then he lapses into the chittering I find unintelligible.</p><p>But whatever he\u2019s saying doesn\u2019t appear persuasive, and the Morgut pilot puts us down so deftly I barely feel the touchdown. Whatever else may be said of them, they know their way around a ship. I hear the door to the cockpit unseal with a soft whoosh, but Velith greets him with a shot to the head, and his brains spray out bile green against the bulwark, more modern art.</p><p>He seems to read my reaction and lifts a shoulder in that endearing almost shrug. \u201cI never liked him.\u201d</p><p>That strikes me as absurdly amusing, but I manage to contain my laughter, knowing it will come out sounding like hysteria. \u201cWhy did you kill him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey were clutchmates. He would have attacked us if I had not reacted thus, and I am in no condition to engage in unnecessary violent confrontation.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cYou\u2019re crazier than they say I am. You should\u2019ve let them kill me. What\u2019s waiting for me at Corp headquarters is so much worse.\u201d</p><p>With that I turn and head for the door. I\u2019m not afraid of him anymore. My peaceable surrender has accomplished something that I don\u2019t quite comprehend, but it seems he feels honor bound to protect me until we reach our destination. I can use that to my advantage. As he pointed out, he isn\u2019t in top shape right now. Neither am I, so we\u2019d be two cripples mixing it up with our crutches, so to speak.</p> <p>Hope neither one of us is that dumb.</p><p>I hit the button that unseals the outer doors, and the stairs lower with the smooth sound of well-maintained machinery. A gust of frosty air sends a chill straight through me, and when I peer out, I see that we\u2019re in the middle of nowhere. Big surprise. But instead of a field full of golden grain, we\u2019ve landed in smooth, white tundra, mountains in the distance, also white-capped. I\u2019m fragging hungry, so they remind me of choclaste cakes with cream sauce on top. The sky looks as if it may snow, and the light diffused through the clouds appears touched with gold.</p><p>We can\u2019t be more than a half hour from headquarters by Silverfish flight, but as previously noted, these ships are insanely fast. I have no way of calculating the distance from here to Ankaraj, although the Corp is probably tracking our flight in some fashion.</p><p>Sure enough, the comm crackles to life in the cockpit. \u201cSpiral, this is control. Do you need assistance? We show you stalled in the Teresengi Basin.\u201d</p><p>Velith bounds for the cockpit, leaping with unsettling grace over the corpses that litter the aisle. Being battle-sore hasn\u2019t decreased his agility. Tapping the panel, he replies, \u201cYes, but I would also appreciate some information. Why does my target claim that Farwan Corporation is responsible for the crash on Matins IV? Why does the target prefer to provoke a pack of Morgut to being extradited into your custody?\u201d</p><p>His questions meet with an uncomfortable silence.</p><p>Shit.</p><p>Now I\u2019m the one running for the cockpit. I struggle to turn off the feed, but he holds me away, waiting for the answer. My heart starts to pound because I know...I know we\u2019re in danger. They\u2019re not going to send aid now; they\u2019re going to send aerial assault. I know how they think. I know about their damage control. When he started asking the wrong questions, he ceased to factor for them.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s insane,\u201d the controller finally responds. \u201cShe would say anything. Just sit tight, and help will arrive shortly. We have a unit en route.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on.\u201d I tug at his arm. \u201cWe have to get out of here. Right now. We cannot be on this ship when they get here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey claim you are mentally unbalanced, Sirantha.\u201d I wish I could read his expression, but I\u2019m incapable of distinguishing anything but the twitch of his mandible and the clicking of his claws, and maybe I interpret those incorrectly as well. \u201cYour behavior suggests paranoia, at best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou half believe me.\u201d I grab him by the collar. Mary, he looks strange, still wearing Doc\u2019s clothes that are too big and too short, so badly shredded by Morgut fangs. \u201cOr you wouldn\u2019t have mentioned it. I\u2019ve raised some doubt in you. Give me this much. Come off the ship with me. Over there...\u201d I\u2019m pulling him now, and I\u2019m surprised to feel him follow. With my free hand, I point to a dark jumble of rock in the distance. \u201cTo wait. If they really intend to rescue us, there will be a search party and we\u2019ll go to meet them peacefully. I won\u2019t give you any more trouble, and you can forget you ever saw me. But if I\u2019m right...then we don\u2019t die when they blow the Spiral all to hell and claim it crashed. Velith, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well,\u201d he says finally. \u201cA test. But we will need some supplies if we are to wait with any degree of comfort.\u201d</p><p>He packs with an economy of motion that March would envy and hands me the bag to carry. That\u2019s when I notice his shoulder, half-torn from the socket, and I wonder how he can bear it. Before we step out onto the crisp snow, covered with an icy crust that professes we\u2019re the first to have stepped foot here in a long time, we wrap up in blankets. The outcropping sits a little farther out than it seems, but we make the trek just as I glimpse the white trail in the sky that means something\u2019s headed our way.</p><p>I know he wants the ship to land, but it won\u2019t. So I crouch down, flattening myself against the dark stone. Make sure the gray blanket wraps around my head, which feels like it\u2019s covered in hoarfrost. Velith hesitates, then mimics me.</p><p>\u201cYou have succeeded in making me uneasy,\u201d he whispers.</p><p>I don\u2019t reply to that. There\u2019s no need. As soon as he asked those questions, he turned himself into a security risk and a liability. Why would they pay him when they can just kill us both? But then I know how they think, and I got him to listen, praise Mary.</p><p>The Corp vessel overhead spots the Silverfish, and instead of lessening altitude to land and offer assistance, I see the blue-white flare of guns overhead. Beside me, the bounty hunter watches, barely breathing, as the Spiral goes up in flame. We hold very still as the ship seems to skim the area overhead, then wheels off, returning to headquarters to report us as loose ends tied up.</p><p>Without a word, he reaches over and inputs a code on my bracelet. It drops off my wrist and onto the snow. For a moment longer we watch the Spiral smolder.</p><p>\u201cSo how does it feel to be dead?\u201d I offer him a bittersweet smile, hating what I\u2019ve done to him, what I\u2019ve taught him.</p><p>Sometimes there\u2019s nothing worse than the truth.</p><p>CHAPTER 50</p><p>\u201cCold,\u201d he says, after a moment\u2019s reflection.</p><p>Taking in the vast expanse of snowy landscape, I can\u2019t help but agree. In slippers and pajamas, even wrapped in a blanket, I\u2019m not going to last long out here. There are no settlements within visual range, but maybe Vel brought something useful from the ship.</p><p>I dig into the bag and glance over at him. \u201cYou already knew, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Not waiting for his answer, I don the thin, insulated suit, right over the top of my clothing. My teeth chatter as I stuff the blanket into the bag, but oh Mary, it feels good once I get the gear fastened up. I\u2019m covered from head to toe, just an eye slit providing perfunctory visibility. He dresses more slowly, seeming to consider my question.</p><p>\u201cYou were...persuasive in your paranoia,\u201d he answers finally. \u201cAnd I preferred not to perish of exposure, if you were right. A good bounty hunter always has a plan B.\u201d</p><p>I continue prowling through the bag. \u201cWhat else did you bring?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing that will keep us alive indefinitely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re one of the good guys now,\u201d I tell him, stepping away from the shelter of the rocks. \u201cAlthough I don\u2019t suppose that helps much.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNot especially, no.\u201d His wry tone amuses me because it contains a thread of self-deprecation, as if he knows he brought this upon himself.</p><p>Yeah, well, anyone could tell him, trouble starts with listening to Sirantha Jax.</p><p>\u201cSo what now?\u201d</p><p>Velith gazes up without speaking. I tip my head back and discover that the sky has gained the heavy opacity of impending snow. Just what we need.</p> <p>\u201cShelter. Beyond that, I need some time to process events.\u201d</p><p>I can understand that, but if ever I\u2019ve been told politely to shut the frag up, it\u2019s right now. So we start walking\u2014far as I can tell, we seem to be making for the mountains. Out here I feel impossibly small and inconsequential because everything else is so huge. From the towering mountains to the wide-open sky, the elements seem actively hostile, like even the wind wants its pound of flesh.</p><p>It rushes against us, making progress difficult, until all I can hear is my own breathing and the crunch of our dogged tread on virgin snow. My lashes ice up, making me conscious of the exposed flesh around my eyes. They feel frozen, as if I can\u2019t move them side to side. I don\u2019t notice when it starts to snow, not until it becomes heavier, stinging my skin.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t want to whine, even inside my own head, but I\u2019m so fragging hungry that Velith is starting to look good. Not to mention the fact that I\u2019m cold, exhausted, and my raw forearm throbs in a painful counterrhythm. Most of all, I\u2019m worried about March. The way he looked when I came back...and now I\u2019m gone again.</p> <p>\u201cAlmost there.\u201d</p><p>There turns out to be a shallow cave, reached only after fifty meters of slippery, heart-stopping ascent. But, Mary, it feels good to get out of the wind. Crouching, he leads me all the way to the back where the stone slopes to meet the floor. It smells stale and a little funky, as if some animal might occasionally den in here. Not bad enough to drive me back out into the storm, though.</p><p>The sky has turned to slate, and the wind howls, white with blowing snow. I let myself slide down and watch him pull out various items. As he does, I realize he packed this stuff when we were evacuating the Folly. And these aren\u2019t Doc\u2019s devices at all.</p><p>\u201cDo you really have the Mareq samples?\u201d Suddenly that seems of paramount importance; otherwise, we\u2019ve wasted all this fragging time and accomplished nothing.</p><p>\u201cI do actually,\u201d he answers absently, his attention on what he is assembling from a battery, a coil of wires, and four metal plates. \u201cI could tell they were valuable from reading Dr. Solaith\u2019s notes.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m astonished to see a sweet red glow rise from the cube he put together. \u201cA chemical heater?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAmong other things. Do not touch it, it warms all sides equally.\u201d He tosses me a metal cup. \u201cFill this with snow, and we can make soup.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo paste?\u201d I\u2019m so glad to hear that, I could hug him, but instead I make my way back to the mouth of the cave, pack the mug full, and return to the copper-tinged shadows.</p><p>\u201cCannot abide it. I keep powdered rations in my emergency kit. If there is no water nearby for hydration, then I am in a world of trouble, regardless.\u201d</p><p>A world of trouble, that sounds about right.</p><p>\u201cSo how bad off are we?\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t answer for a moment. As I watch him slitting envelopes and tipping the contents into a metal cylinder, it occurs to me that he no longer sends a shock through me. The bounty hunter responsible for my capture, a Slider no less, is now making me dinner. When he seems content, he sets the tube on the heater, then turns his head toward me, his faceted eyes glittering in the ginger glow. I can only see a little through the protective weather gear.</p><p>\u201cI have been in worse spots, Sirantha. The storm will work to our advantage, covering our tracks if they should send anyone to double-check our demise. When the foul weather passes, I will beam a distress signal to the Guild. Someone should arrive within a standard day or two, depending on whether there are other operatives on world. Our supplies are adequate to that end.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuild? You\u2019re calling in more bounty hunters?\u201d For a moment, I feel nothing but pure strangling panic.</p> <p>Velith touches my shoulder. \u201cRelax. You are now deceased. As such, your bounty will be removed from the active rosters. And so far as my colleagues are concerned, you are my apprentice. The pretense will suffice for our purposes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBounty hunters take apprentices?\u201d That\u2019s a new one on me.</p><p>\u201cAthnid encourages it. When a bounty hunter begins to think of retirement, the Guild asks that he find an apt pupil to carry on his art. Other collectives possess much less in the way of tradition, nicety, and honor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere the Morgut your apprentices?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey were meat. Muscle. Hired because I believed I might require assistance with you. I did not anticipate you would surrender to protect your comrades.\u201d His tone sounds odd somehow.</p><p>I have to grin. \u201cDon\u2019t believe everything you see on the vids. Most of it is bullshit or Corp propaganda or both. How\u2019s your shoulder?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt hurts.\u201d</p><p>That has to be an understatement, and I\u2019m suddenly glad I haven\u2019t bitched about my arm or my sore eye. Warm enough now, I push my hood back but can\u2019t restrain a wince when the cool air rushes over my scalp. That\u2019s going to take a lot of getting used to. About a meter away, Velith judges the soup done and pours some into the same mug I filled with snow.</p><p>\u201cCareful, it is hot.\u201d</p><p>So I just hold it for a while, feeling the heat through the insulated fabric. When I take a sip, I find it bland but not bad, a legume and broth staple that will sustain us well enough. If I believed in Mary, I would send up a prayer right about now, but maybe Adele is doing that for me.</p><p>\u201cThank you. I guess I was pretty lucky to wind up with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne could not make the same argument in reverse,\u201d he returns wryly, pushing back his hood to eat.</p><p>And I almost drop my empty cup. \u201cVel, what...why...\u201d</p><p>He turns guileless green eyes on me. \u201cI thought you would find it comforting to see a familiar face.\u201d Not just any face. Kai\u2019s face. \u201cI found his image in your dossier. On a more mundane note, the generation of such tissue provides greater insulation in inclement weather.\u201d</p><p>Does he know what Kai was to me? What kind of reaction is he trying to provoke? I feel my fingers trembling so I clench them together. Kai\u2019s slender, lanky build suits Velith\u2019s natural form better than Doc\u2019s stocky musculature. Probably feels less cramped, too, but that\u2019s like a distant intellectual thought running down a different pipeline. I can\u2019t shut off my visceral response to seeing him again.</p><p>Though I know it\u2019s not him, even though I know that, I want to brush his hair back off his forehead. I want to touch the line of his cheek as I have so often. It\u2019s almost more than I can manage not to burst into tears or throw myself into his arms.</p><p>Kai, baby...</p><p>If he wasn\u2019t gazing at me with Kai\u2019s eyes, his sweet half smile as he sips his soup, I\u2019d be asking about the functioning physiology, how the transformation takes place. I didn\u2019t see it happen beneath his weather gear, but I can\u2019t think of anything but\u2014</p><p>Oh Mary, I could have him back.</p><p>CHAPTER 51</p><p>I back off that thought so fast my head spins.</p><p>That\u2019s the insidious whisper of a psychotic break. This isn\u2019t Kai, and I\u2019ll never see him again\u2014cold, hard fact. Velith is a mimic, albeit one I like well enough, but if I accept him as my dead lover, then I\u2019m lost, and I\u2019ll never find my way back.</p><p>Reality is March out there grieving. Reality is how he watches me when he doesn\u2019t think I\u2019m paying attention. Reality is the way he always keeps his promises. Reality is...him loving me although he\u2019s seen every scar, every fault, inside and out, magnified a thousand times. Reality is him saying to himself: I want her, no matter what. She\u2019s mine.</p><p>I\u2019ve got to get back to him.</p><p>\u201cCan you change it up a bit?\u201d My voice sounds hoarse. \u201cEye color, nose, mouth, something? I can\u2019t look at you like that.\u201d</p><p>He looks perplexed. I can interpret his expressions when he\u2019s wearing human skin, no problem. Perhaps in time I\u2019ll learn all the Slider variations. I guess he thought he was giving me a present. Maybe one day I\u2019ll be ready for that, but not now. It\u2019s too soon.</p><p>\u201cAs you wish.\u201d His eyes darken to hazel and his nose seems to flesh out further. Now he\u2019s nobody I know, and I feel the tension ease out of my shoulders. \u201cWill you tell me about the project, Sirantha?\u201d</p><p>Making myself as comfortable as possible on the stone floor, I start from the beginning. He interjects with occasional questions, incisive, intelligent ones, and sometimes I don\u2019t even know the answers. I think he\u2019d work really well with Doc; they possess similar mind-sets.</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s where we are,\u201d I conclude.</p><p>A little depressing to realize we\u2019ve made no more progress than that toward realizing Mair\u2019s dream of a rival academy. But it makes me smile to see him tapping his fingertips against the rock wall as he processes the information. I\u2019d be hearing thoughtful clicking right about now if he were wearing his native form.</p><p>\u201cOnce you remembered what occurred on Matins IV, you should have begun investigating why,\u201d he advises me eventually. \u201cWhat did Farwan Corporation stand to gain by crashing the Sargasso? They would scarcely have chosen such a course if it had not presented the greatest value.\u201d</p><p>Why? It never occurred to me that there must be a reason. To my mind, they\u2019re just bastards, that\u2019s all, but now that Velith\u2019s got me thinking, which I\u2019ve stated isn\u2019t my strong suit, I decide he\u2019s right.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I say aloud. \u201cThere were delegates, dignitaries, representatives from all Conglomerate worlds heading to Matins IV for a conference. No one ever told me what would be discussed there, at least not that I recall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I will find out, as it is highly probable that the purpose of that conference impacts Farwan\u2019s decision to terminate those on board.\u201d</p><p>Nodding, I shift my weight onto my hip and thigh, curling sideways against the slant. \u201cI should\u2019ve done that, but I guess I just wanted to start over. Strike back at the Corp by founding a new academy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA worthy goal, but you cannot escape your past, Sirantha, particularly when they engage me to hunt you.\u201d He sounds amused.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, rub it in.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m surprised when he slides over and offers me his good shoulder instead of the wall, but even though I know what lurks beneath the skin, I\u2019m too tired to care. In fact, at this point I consider his true nature an advantage because I don\u2019t imagine he has any interest in me.</p><p>\u201cYou sure this is all right? You\u2019re pretty beat up.\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t answer\u2014I guess it ranks as a stupid question. So I put my head down and close my eyes.</p><p>The emergency rations ran out yesterday, and we\u2019ve been reduced to drinking melted snow. And san facilities, well, you try pissing outside when it\u2019s snowing. The only thing to do is talk. Velith wants to know all about me. Wish I knew why. But he\u2019s a good listener. I tell him all about Kai and March, more than I should have, probably. Maybe it seems like I\u2019ve said too much, but there isn\u2019t much else to do, and it keeps my mind off the others. Stops me wondering whether they\u2019re all right. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I know how I\u2019d feel if March disappeared on me. I\u2019d want to kill someone. Shit, when Farr shot him on DuPont Station, I couldn\u2019t control myself, couldn\u2019t even think. I never felt that kind of rage before in my life. When I lost Kai there was too much physical pain, confusion, and disorientation, further exacerbated by the Unit Psychs and dream therapy.</p><p>Please make March stronger than me. Adele, light a candle for us on Mary\u2019s shrine. We need all the help we can get.</p><p>At first, I wonder if it\u2019s safe to beam out a message, but Vel assures me he is using a frequency unique to the Guild. So I try to simmer down, but the time passes so slowly. I get him to talk on the second day, learn why he became a bounty hunter. \u201cIt is not an entertaining a story,\u201d he says, as if that\u2019s going to blunt my curiosity.</p><p>\u201cTell me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFemales on Ithiss-Tor\u201d\u2014I remember that\u2019s his homeworld\u2014\u201care dominant. They take lead roles in government and in family hierarchy. Additionally, they are not always...gentle with their mates, a regrettable trait remaindered from more primitive times. Rather than remain on planet, I confined a visiting human and took his place on an outbound ship. I met my mentor, Trapper Harley\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, you knew him? How old are you?\u201d There\u2019s no twitching mandible this time but I can tell by his drawn brows that I\u2019ve been rude. \u201cEr, sorry. Go on.\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t, though. I\u2019ve pissed him off, so that\u2019s pretty much all the conversation until I doze off propped up against the rock wall. By the third day, I start wondering whether anyone is listening. Cheerful thought. Not only are we in danger of starving, the risk of freezing rears its head again.</p><p>As the ginger glow from the depleted chemical heater fades on the fourth day, leaving us in darkness, his comm unit finally crackles to life. It\u2019s a live feed, too, means our savior is on planet, not bouncing a delayed message on a relay.</p><p>\u201cThis is Sheppard. In a spot of trouble, are you?\u201d A crisply accented voice comes across, but I can\u2019t get a look at its owner, the way Vel tilts the vid screen.</p> <p>\u201cTo say the least,\u201d Velith returns. \u201cWe need a pickup in the Teresengi Basin. I will pay standard rates, plus hazard bonus.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a long pause, then: \u201cShit, that\u2019s a proper mess. Double hazard pay for even thinking of having a go at it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat mess?\u201d he asks, as I consider trying to yank the comm unit away from him.</p><p>The other bounty hunter sounds incredulous. \u201cWhere\u2019ve you fragging been the last three days? Living in a cave?\u201d</p><p>Can\u2019t help but snicker as Vel answers, \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Well then. Farwan shot down some poxy terrorist. In retaliation, her people set bombs all over Ankaraj headquarters, demanding the head of the bloke that gave the order. They\u2019re holed up with hostages, and the Corp\u2019s shut down all air traffic within two hundred kilometers of the city, so I\u2019m going to have a bitch of a time getting to you.\u201d</p> <p>March. I feel as though someone punched me in the chest. He believes I\u2019m dead, or he wouldn\u2019t be doing this. It\u2019s vengeance now\u2014he doesn\u2019t see a way for us to win. In his own eyes, he failed me, failed Mair, so this is the only thing left.</p><p>Even though he told me his gift kills the soul, though I glimpsed the darkness in him, because he always tried so hard to do the right thing, I didn\u2019t realize the truth, the scope. I rise to my knees, gazing into darkness. He would kill the world for me.</p><p>I have to save him.</p><p>Mair gave him back his soul. I can\u2019t be the reason he loses it entirely. I won\u2019t be.</p><p>\u201cTriple hazard pay,\u201d Vel offers. \u201cPerhaps you can arrange land transport just before you reach the no-fly zone.\u201d</p><p>Our potential rescuer sighs. \u201cGreed\u2019s going to be the end of me, but done deal. I\u2019ll make the arrangements.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou would never abandon a Guilder in trouble.\u201d Velith sounds a great deal more confident than I am of that, but credits always make a good case.</p><p>\u201cRight. Send coordinates then. I\u2019m on the way.\u201d</p> <p>I make sure the feed\u2019s dead before I say, \u201cYou sure you can cover that? Won\u2019t your accounts have been frozen when the Corp reported you flatline?\u201d</p><p>He pauses in packing up the remaining gear, what\u2019s still usable anyway. \u201cPerhaps. But I do not keep my assets wholly within Conglomerate banks. I will have access to funds from investments on Venice Minor and Gehenna. Guild barristers will straighten out legal issues arising from any dispute of my existence.\u201d</p><p>Now that would be handy. \u201cI\u2019m starting to wish I\u2019d become a bounty hunter.\u201d</p><p>With a neat tug, Velith ties up the bag. \u201cIf you had, think of all the fun I would be missing right now.\u201d</p><p>I take my figurative hat off to the master of deadpan, just hope it\u2019s not symbolic.</p><p>CHAPTER 52</p><p>Longest wait of my life.</p><p>But eventually, Sheppard comes through. He\u2019s a lean man with deep-set eyes and a weathered face. We find him waiting for us at the base of the mountain in a trawler, big-ass hunk of all-terrain machinery. I have no idea how he got ahold of it, but I don\u2019t care. Vel and I slip-slide our way down to meet him and pile inside. Mary, it\u2019s so warm in here. Settling in back, I pull down my hood and start peeling out of the insulated gear.</p><p>Almost forgot I\u2019m still in pajamas. Haven\u2019t bathed in days, not since the hostel in Maha City. It highlights how bad off I am when I feel nostalgic about that shitty san-shower with all the scurrying bugs. Miracle my arm isn\u2019t infected...Vel won\u2019t let me look at his shoulder, largely because that would mean shedding the human skin keeping him warm. We take off in a rumble of treads rolling over the snow.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Sheppard says by way of greeting. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to make for\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnkaraj. Please. Drop me as close as you can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour boy\u2019s a bit mad, eh?\u201d he says to Velith, ignoring me.</p><p>Boy. Shit, I forgot about my head. \u201cI mean it.\u201d</p><p>Vel glances up from whatever he\u2019s doing. As soon as we got in, he jacked into the portal sys-term, sending spiders out to retrieve data at a speed I can\u2019t even track. Watching his eyes scan back and forth as he reads makes me feel a little queasy. And then he compiles the info, his fingers deftly copying to a spike.</p><p>\u201cAnkaraj,\u201d he affirms. \u201cTake us straight to headquarters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re both barking mad. The city\u2019s in lockdown, they\u2019ll never let us in.\u201d But a look from Vel seems to change his mind. I wonder how he\u2019d react if he discerned what lurks beneath the unremarkable exterior, Guilder or not. \u201cRight, Ankaraj it is then. We\u2019re not too far off, though you wouldn\u2019t have made it on foot.\u201d</p><p>Glancing out at the stark black and white of the landscape, capped by a hopeless gray sky, I can only agree. We plow onward, and I find myself bouncing one leg until Vel reaches over to still me without looking up from the screen. \u201cWe\u2019ve got them,\u201d he tells me, powering the sys-term down.</p><p>Before I can ask what he means, the sun breaks from behind the clouds, reflecting too bright off the ultrachrome-and-glastique horror that is Ankaraj. Active defense towers, uniformed guards monitoring the expressway into the city. I see two squads of gray men trying to subdue the panic of a populace unused to open warfare. I can almost hear them crying out, \u201cBut we\u2019re too civilized for such things, aren\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>March, what have you done?</p><p>\u201cI hope you two have got some idea as to how...\u201d Sheppard starts to say, as the trawler reaches the checkpoint. \u201cOh, hello, Officer. It\u2019s imperative that we\u2014\u201d</p><p>At that I sit forward enough that the guard can get a good look at my face. \u201cI\u2019m Sirantha Jax. And it is imperative that I reach my people. I can stop this.\u201d</p><p>Poor bastard. He thinks I\u2019m crazy at first, but then he glances between my bruised face and the ugly picture they have splashed all over the holo-feed. \u201cBut...you\u2019re dead.\u201d</p><p>If it weren\u2019t so fucking urgent, I\u2019d laugh. \u201cNot so much. Let us in.\u201d</p><p>That galvanizes him into action, and I hear his voice reverberate over the city comm. \u201cArmed escort immediately. Clear the roads. First priority.\u201d</p><p>Sheppard keeps stealing glances at me when he thinks I\u2019m not looking. \u201cYou...you\u2019re...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat poxy terrorist. Don\u2019t worry, my reputation\u2019s somewhat exaggerated.\u201d</p><p>He sighs. \u201cRight. And you\u2019re his take, yeah?\u201d</p><p>Velith shakes his head, looking thoughtful. \u201cQuite the contrary. You will soon see, along with everyone else.\u201d</p><p>I hope that means he\u2019s got a plan. Surreal. I feel as though we\u2019re leading a parade, so many armored vehicles behind us, and people following on foot, since the checkpoint seems to have been abandoned. As I wanted, Sheppard takes us straight there.</p><p>\u201cOne favor,\u201d I say to our driver. \u201cBounce a message to this private sequence for me. Say, \u2018I\u2019m sorry.\u2019 It doesn\u2019t need to be encrypted.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s all I can do, an acknowledgment of my failure\u2014my only consolation is that Keri hasn\u2019t been drawn into this mess with us. At least, they\u2019ve got distance from it. Maybe they can start over, someday. Then I climb down without waiting for them to finish transacting Guild business.</p><p>A hush falls over the crowd assembled outside the squat, sprawling building that serves as the Corp home office. This is where I came to sign my contract, so long ago. I realize they\u2019re looking at me, and I can only imagine the picture I present: bald, barefoot, coming into the cold wearing only bloodstained pajamas. I know I\u2019m gaunt, my nipples making sharp points through my thin cami, but I don\u2019t let myself shiver.</p><p>No weakness. Hold your head high.</p><p>People part when I pass as if I am the Holy Mother come to bless them or the Dark Lady come to reap their souls. To their minds, I\u2019ve risen from the dead, which is as close to miraculous as most people ever get. Or perhaps it has something to do with the gray men closing on me. Velith holds up a hand, stepping between them and me.</p><p>\u201cYou shall not touch her.\u201d His voice carries that terrible dual euphonic tone, and they fall back, cowed.</p><p>There\u2019s something uncanny about Velith, but since he\u2019s on my side, I don\u2019t delve into it. \u201cThat\u2019s best. I\u2019ll stop this if you let me go.\u201d</p><p>The squad leader glances at his men, then he says, \u201cStand down.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ve never seen that happen before. He knows there\u2019s no way I\u2019m getting out of here alive. Already knew that, though. They\u2019re letting me in because that\u2019s exactly where they want me, and I can help inside, but getting out again, that\u2019s another story. Once March releases the hostages and reveals the location of the explosives, we\u2019re done. I know that; I just don\u2019t care.</p><p>\u201cWhere are they?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cThird floor, communications center.\u201d</p><p>We pass into the neutral light of the building, although the floor feels no warmer against the soles of my feet. The foyer is deserted. I presume they\u2019ve long since evacuated all inessential personnel, other than the hostages. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I pause and glance at Velith; he has so much more to lose. He could\u2019ve walked away, played it safe. I don\u2019t understand him at all. \u201cWhy are you doing this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps I have always wanted to play the hero, Sirantha.\u201d That\u2019s not an answer, but I let it be, as we proceed through silent halls.</p><p>So ironic. I ran so long and fought so hard to escape the Corp. And now here I am, returning all but naked and unarmed. It doesn\u2019t matter anymore. All I know is that I can\u2019t let it end like this, where March becomes a conscienceless butcher because of me, even if they are Corp automatons and wage slaves. He\u2019s better than this. Better than me. And I\u2019d die for him. That\u2019s why I\u2019m here. Nothing else makes a bit of difference; I\u2019m here to share his fate.</p><p>Finally found something more important than me, baby.</p> <p>My throat burns. There\u2019s nobody anywhere in the building, but on the third floor, we run into two MPs dragging a struggling man in a suit toward what I presume to be the comm center. I guess they finally decided to give up the button man. The Corp certainly doesn\u2019t hold human life sacred, after all.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re dead,\u201d he shouts. \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to be dead. Mother Mary of Anabolic Grace, what will it take to kill you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeople keep saying that.\u201d But then I take a closer look at him, straining against his captors. \u201cSimon?\u201d</p><p>Vel frowns, glancing between us. \u201cYou know this man, Sirantha?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot well enough to have foreseen this, but technically he\u2019s my husband.\u201d</p> <p>I disregard whatever Simon\u2019s screaming as they tow him toward the doors. Had no idea he\u2019d climbed so high on the Corp ladder that he\u2019d be placed for involvement in something like this. Then again, he always was ambitious. I think he chased me because he thought it would help his career, being married to a nav-star. Too bad I came equipped with a mind of my own and no compunctions about telling him that he couldn\u2019t get me off with a handbook.</p><p>\u201cSave the reunion,\u201d the guard says, clapping a hand over Simon\u2019s mouth. \u201cLet\u2019s take this inside before that crazy bastard in there starts making people explode.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you, nobody gets in but the one responsible for her death.\u201d Every muscle tenses at hearing March on the speakers. Mary, I\u2019ve never heard him sound like that. Cold. Determined. Hopeless. He\u2019s likely monitoring the building from inside. \u201cKeep fucking with me, and this whole place goes up. We planted enough charges to take out this whole quadrant, and I\u2019m tired of waiting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust, please, let us in,\u201d the guard begs, sounding like he wishes he was in another line of work. \u201cWe brought him for you, didn\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a long, tense silence, and I\u2019m almost afraid he\u2019s going to snap before we get inside. But then the lock clicks, and the doors swing open. I don\u2019t wait; I can\u2019t. My feet pound the floor as I break into a run. But I draw up as I realize sudden movement is a really bad idea.</p><p>The room smells of stale sweat and terror, faint acrid reek of urine. People lie facedown on the floor. I recognize Dina and March, note a couple strangers with disruptors, hired guns most likely. Oh Mary, look at what I\u2019ve done to him. He carries hell in his eyes, the set of his mouth. He regards me with a blank, dead stare.</p> <p>\u201cYou fragging twats,\u201d he says, a low, hoarse voice. \u201cYou\u2019d try anything. Trying to fool me with a dupe? Get that bitch out of here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarch, it\u2019s me, baby. I\u2019m here. I will always come for you.\u201d</p><p>I move toward him, knowing he might shoot me in the chest. I can feel that he\u2019s gone away somewhere inside his head, a fire-washed wasteland where nothing matters, and the burning never stops. I know the place all too well.</p><p>I\u2019ll wind up there myself if anything happens to this man.</p><p>CHAPTER 53</p><p>I keep walking.</p><p>\u201cDina, you dumb bitch. Why\u2019d you let him talk you into this?\u201d That earns me a sharp glance. I sense it more than see it. Less than two meters to him now. I see his fingers trembling on the weapon. \u201cRemember when I sat on your lap in the rover? I expected you to grab my ass, but you never did. Guess I\u2019m really not your type.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d she breathes. \u201cMarch, it\u2019s Jax. It\u2019s really her.\u201d</p> <p>He comes roaring into me then, although he doesn\u2019t move, not gentle exploration, more of an invasion. I feel everything inside him\u2014the despair of my own death washes over me, and I stop. My chest feels tight; it\u2019s almost impossible to breathe.</p><p>Then I don\u2019t see anything at all because he crushes me in his arms. My ribs contract as he squeezes me, trying to make me part of him. The hired gunmen are screaming at the guards, and Simon adds to the clamor, but I can\u2019t make out what they\u2019re saying over the roaring in my head. Distantly, I\u2019m aware of a woman sobbing, hoarse and desperate in the cadence of her weeping.</p><p>\u201cI wanted him to die,\u201d March whispers. \u201cI wanted the whole world to die. Jax, Jax...\u201d His fingers tremble as they brush across my scalp, down over my temples to my jaw. He touches my bruised eye with such reverence that I might be a holy artifact.</p><p>I don\u2019t know what might have happened then, but everyone in the room freezes as the forty vid screens around the room light up, and Velith steps away from a sys-terminal, looking pleased. The first thing that pops up is a document. It\u2019s a meeting agenda with the heading: Matins IV\u2014a Conglomerate summit to vote upon deregulation.</p><p>Deregulation...</p><p>A chill washes over me. But that\u2019s not all. Up on-screen, we see footage from the crash, smoldering wreckage, and I suddenly know what Vel\u2019s doing. Mary, he\u2019s fragging brilliant. This is what he was splicing in the trawler, but I\u2019m still surprised when the display patches to the grainy record taken from his cranial cam. Didn\u2019t even know he had one, but I guess it eliminates any question of how a capture went down. I see myself pinned, his claw on my throat, hear myself surrender to save the others.</p><p>Then we bounce to the Silverfish, where I say, fuzzy but audible, \u201cDid it ever occur to you to that the Corp is guilty of disseminating false information? I\u2019m the only survivor from the Sargasso, but I didn\u2019t do that. The landing authority used override codes on our vessel and supplied incorrect coordinates, the wrong trajectory. They fragging engineered that crash.\u201d</p><p>And now everyone watching this feed, not sure how many that is, knows it, too. But he\u2019s still not done. Vel shows the world the way I provoked the Morgut, feeding them my blood like a moron, and we hear his voice on the comm. \u201cWhy does my target claim that Farwan Corporation is responsible for the crash on Matins IV? Why does the target prefer to provoke a pack of Morgut to being extradited into your custody?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s insane,\u201d comes the soon-to-be-infamous response. \u201cShe would say anything. Just sit tight, and help will arrive shortly. We have a unit en route.\u201d</p><p>The last scene shows us crouched behind the rocks, as the Corp ship blows the Spiral all to hell; and then it starts to play all over again. Outside, I hear the crowd roaring, the impact of something exploding against glastique. Farwan Corporation murdered the last hero the whole galaxy recognizes, Miriam Jocasta, because they were afraid of the vote. Afraid the Conglomerate would vote to deregulate jump-travel and permit freely established academies.</p><p>Security\u2019s going to have a hell of a time containing the riots\u2014if they even bother. The public never likes being duped. Hostages clamber unsteadily to their feet because even the hired gunmen look stunned and numb. Nobody stops them.</p><p>\u201cIt is finished,\u201d Vel tells the guards. \u201cI bounced that feed to every Conglomerate world, and it is only a matter of time before they arrive demanding justice for their murdered representatives. Once exposed, a secret loses all its power.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s right. Although it may flail around like an enormous decapitated beast, doing collateral damage, Farwan\u2019s days are numbered. They failed to break me before March got me off station, and now it\u2019s too late. They should\u2019ve killed me instead of trying to turn me into their sacrificial goat. I\u2019ve said that all along.</p><p>I can\u2019t even begin to imagine the economic ripples this is going to have. I foresee world after world seceding from the Conglomerate until it ultimately dissolves. And who can prosecute a company so large, it essentially became a galactic government? But perhaps a strong leader can hold it together. They\u2019ll have to create a tribunal, so much ground-breaking here. It\u2019s a new universe, or will be, once the shock waves cease.</p><p>The security officers exchange a long look, then pull the patches from their uniforms. Silently, they drop their weapons and nobody stops them when they leave the room. I guess they\u2019re unemployed now. A lot of folks will be before this thing is done. Hard times are coming, but I think perhaps it\u2019s a good thing. Change is good, chaos can be beneficial, and this will open a lot of doors. Maybe ours won\u2019t be the only start-up academy; maybe we\u2019ll have competition. And that\u2019s exactly as it should be.</p><p>\u201cI was only following orders,\u201d Simon whimpers. \u201cThey told me to select someone expendable, and you\u2019ve been jumping a long time. Statistically speaking, you should have burned out long since. Sirantha, please...\u201d</p><p>Deliberately I turn my back on him, content to let the incipient tribunal deal with him and all the rest of his ilk. I hear the sound of one of his former employees shutting him up. It\u2019s distinctive, the repetitive thud of a fist hitting a face. The room empties, some hostages looking broken, others disbelieving. I can relate; rather suddenly, the face of the universe has changed.</p><p>March pulls me back into his arms then. He let me turn when the screens came to life, but now he\u2019s compulsive, running his hands over my back, my shoulders, my hips. He holds me as if it hurts him to breathe, and he can\u2019t seem to find his voice.</p><p>Dina comes up behind us, and I\u2019m surprised to feel her arms encircle both of us. \u201cYou stupid bitch,\u201d she mutters. \u201cI don\u2019t need you dying for me. I need you to stick around because...you\u2019re my best friend.\u201d She squeezes us with her corded arms, then steps back, clearing her throat. \u201cWe got a message from Doc, by the way. He\u2019s all right, just stuck on Gehenna. Said he had some news for you, but he didn\u2019t say what.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bounce a message to him later,\u201d I answer.</p><p>But I think I already know, something about the L-gene appending to the J-gene. Maybe he knows why since he\u2019s had nothing but time since we left and access to the excellent Carvati research facilities.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d she adds to the hired guns. I hear explosions in the distance, shattering glastique. \u201cLet\u2019s loot this place before the angry mob gets inside.\u201d</p><p>Then it\u2019s just the two of us. I meant to thank Vel, but he\u2019s gone, and I didn\u2019t see him leave. Maybe for him it was as simple as getting to the truth. Maybe we didn\u2019t bond like I thought we did, but I can\u2019t think about that right now. I\u2019ll locate him later if he wants to be found.</p><p>It\u2019s time to say the words. Wherever he is, Kai knows my feelings now don\u2019t lessen anything we shared. March is such an odd dichotomy of buried cruelty and brutality, overlaid by the kindness and compassion that Mair taught him. He\u2019d kill the world for me, so it\u2019s my place to make sure he never has to. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Yeah, they proved there\u2019s nothing spiritual, no such thing as a soul, but I\u2019m not sure I can wholly put my faith in science anymore.
