When Salvatore got out of the tunnel, he was going to track down Jagr and cut out his heart for sticking him with the annoying Levet. Damned vampire.</p><p>\u201cYou will not be doing anything unless you get up and move,\u201d the gargoyle warned. \u201cShake your tail, King of Slugs.\u201d</p><p>Ignoring the grinding pain in his joints, Salvatore rose to his feet and smoothed back his shoulder-length raven hair. He didn\u2019t bother knocking the dirt from his silk suit. It was going in the nearest fire.</p><p>Along with gargoyle.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn some nasty tunnel.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA brilliant deduction. What would I do without you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, Cujo, all I know is that one minute we were in a cabin with an extremely dead Duncan, and the next I was being dropped on my head by a gorgeous but tr\u00e8s ill-mannered woman.\u201d Bizarrely, the gargoyle rubbed his butt rather than his head. Of course, his skull was far too thick to harm. \u201cThat female is fortunate that I did not turn her into a beaver.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt had to have been a spell. Was the woman a witch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNon. A demon, but...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is a mongrel.\u201d</p><p>Salvatore shrugged. It was common among the demon world to interbreed.</p><p>\u201cNot unusual.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHer power is.\u201d</p><p>Salvatore frowned. He might want to choke the gargoyle, but the tiny demon possessed the ability to sense magic that Salvatore couldn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cWhat power?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJinn.\u201d</p><p>A chill inched down Salvatore\u2019s spine and he cast a swift glance up and down the tunnel. In the distance he could sense the approach of his curs and a vampire. The cavalry rushing to the rescue. His attention, however, was focused on searching for any hint of the jinn.</p><p>A pureblooded jinn was a cruel, unpredictable creature who could manipulate nature. They could call lightning, turn wind into a lethal force, and lay flat an entire city with an earthquake. They could also disappear into a wisp of smoke. Thankfully, they rarely took an interest in the world and preferred to remain isolated.</p><p>Half-breeds...</p><p>He shuddered. They might not possess the power of a full-fledged jinn, but their inability to control their volatile energy made them even more dangerous.</p><p>\u201cJinn have been forbidden to breed with other demons.\u201d</p><p>Levet snorted. \u201cThere are many things forbidden in this world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Commission must be told,\u201d Salvatore muttered, referring to the cryptic Oracles who were the ultimate leaders of the demon world. He reached into his pocket, coming up empty. \u201cCristo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy cell phone is gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d Levet threw his hands in the air. \u201cWe will send a memo. For now we need to get out of here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRelax, gargoyle. Help is on the way.\u201d</p><p>With a frown, Levet sniffed the air. \u201cYour curs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd a leech.\u201d</p><p>Levet sniffed again. \u201cTane.\u201d</p><p>Expecting Jagr, Salvatore\u2019s brows snapped together. One vampire was as bad as another, but Tane\u2019s reputation for killing first and asking questions later didn\u2019t exactly warm the cockles of a Were\u2019s heart.</p><p>Whatever the hell a cockle was.</p><p>\u201cThe Charon?\u201d he demanded. Charons were assassins who hunted down rogue vampires. God only knew what they did to lesser demons. And in a vampire\u2019s mind, every demon was lesser.</p><p>\u201cAn arrogant, condescending donkey,\u201d Levet muttered.</p><p>Salvatore rolled his eyes. \u201cJackass, you idiot, not donkey.\u201d</p><p>Levet waved a dismissive hand. \u201cIt is my theory that the taller the demon, the larger his conceit and the smaller his...\u201d</p><p>\u201cContinue, gargoyle,\u201d a cold voice cut through the dark, abruptly lowering the temperature in the tunnel. \u201cI find your theory fascinating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEek.\u201d</p><p>With a flutter of his wings, Levet dashed behind Salvatore. As if he was stupid enough to think Salvatore would keep him from certain death.</p><p>\u201cDio, get away from me, you pest,\u201d Salvatore growled, swiping a hand at the gargoyle even as his gaze was warily focused on the vampire rounding the corner of the tunnel.</p><p>He was worth focusing on.</p><p>Although not as large as many of his brothers, the vampire was dangerously muscular, with the golden skin of his Polynesian ancestors, thick black hair shaved on the sides, and a long Mohawk that fell past his shoulders. His face was that of a predator, lean and hard with faintly slanted honey eyes. At the moment he was wearing nothing more than a pair of khaki shorts, obviously not sharing Salvatore\u2019s own fondness for designer clothes.</p><p>Of course, the big dagger he was holding in his hands made sure that no one was going to question his taste in fashion.</p><p>Not if they wanted to live.</p><p>There was the sound of footsteps and four of his curs came into sight, the largest of them rushing forward to drop to his knees and press his bald head to the ground in front of Salvatore\u2019s feet.</p><p>\u201cSire, are you harmed?\u201d Hess demanded.</p><p>\u201cOnly my pride.\u201d Salvatore returned his attention to the vampire as Hess rose to his feet and towered at his side. \u201cI remember nothing after entering the cabin and finding Duncan dead. No, wait. There was a voice, then...\u201d He shook his head in aggravation as his memory went blank. \u201cDamn. Did you follow us?\u201d</p><p>Tane absently stroked the hilt of his dagger. \u201cWhen we found the cabin empty, Jagr assumed you were in trouble. Since your clueless crew seemed incapable of forming a singular coherent thought, I agreed to come in search of you.\u201d</p><p>Not surprising. Unlike purebloods who were born from full Weres, the curs were humans who had been bitten and transformed into werewolves. Hess and the other curs were excellent killers. Which was why he kept them as guards. Using their brains, however...well, he did the thinking for them. It solved any number of problems.</p><p>\u201cSo what happened to our captors?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been gaining on you over the past half hour.\u201d Tane shrugged. \u201cThey obviously preferred escape over keeping their hostages.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never caught sight of them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. A cur escaped through a side tunnel a mile back, and the demon simply disappeared.\u201d Frustration flashed through the honey eyes. Salvatore could sympathize. He was anxious for a bit of blood and violence himself. \u201cThere\u2019re only a handful of demons capable of vanishing into thin air.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe gargoyle thinks it\u2019s a jinn mongrel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, the gargoyle has a name.\u201d Stepping from behind Salvatore, Levet planted his hands on his hips. \u201cAnd I do not think, I know.\u201d</p><p>Tane narrowed his eyes. \u201cHow can you be certain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had a slight misunderstanding with a jinn a few centuries ago. He zapped off one of my wings. It took years to grow back.\u201d</p><p>Tane was supremely unimpressed. \u201cAnd that\u2019s somehow relevant?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBefore the demon dropped me and did her disappearing act, she left a little present.\u201d Turning around, Levet revealed the perfectly shaped handprint that had been branded onto his butt. Salvtore\u2019s laughter echoed through the tunnel, and the gargoyle turned to stab him with a wounded glare. \u201cIt is not amusing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat still doesn\u2019t prove it was a jinn,\u201d Tane pointed out, his own lips twitching with amusement.</p><p>\u201cBeing struck by lightning is not a sensation you easily forget.\u201d</p><p>Tane instinctively glanced over his shoulder. No demon in his right mind wanted to cross paths with a jinn.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know it isn\u2019t a full jinn?\u201d</p><p>Levet grimaced. \u201cI am still alive.\u201d</p><p>The vampire turned to Salvatore. \u201cThe Commission must be warned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is Were business. It\u2019s your duty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t lose the trail of the cur,\u201d Salvatore smoothly pointed out. Ah. There was nothing better than getting the upper hand with a leech. \u201cHe\u2019s proven a danger to more than just Weres. I\u2019m sure the Commission would agree that my duty is to put an end to the traitors.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A blast of frigid air filled the tunnel. Salvatore smiled, releasing his own energy to counter the chill with a prickling heat.</p><p>The curs stirred uneasily, reacting to the power play between two dangerous predators. Salvatore never allowed his gaze to stray from Tane. Few Weres could best a vampire, but Salvatore wasn\u2019t just a Were. He was king. He wasn\u2019t going to back down from any demon.</p><p>At last, Tane snapped his fangs in Salvatore\u2019s direction and stepped back. Salvatore could only assume that the vampire had been ordered to keep the bloodshed to a minimum.</p> <p>\u201cThis will not be forgotten, dog,\u201d Tane warned, turning on his heel and silently disappearing down the tunnel.</p><p>\u201cGood riddance, leech.\u201d</p><p>Waiting long enough to make sure the vampire didn\u2019t have a change of heart and return to rip out his throat, Salvatore turned back to his waiting curs to discover them battling back their urge to shift.</p><p>He grimaced. As a pureblood, he had the ability to control his shifts unless it was a full moon. Curs, on the other hand, were at the mercy of their emotions.</p><p>With a shudder, Hess at last gained control and sucked in a deep breath.</p> <p>\u201cNow what?\u201d</p><p>Salvatore didn\u2019t hesitate. \u201cWe follow the cur.\u201d</p><p>Hess clenched his meaty hands at his side. \u201cIt\u2019s too dangerous. The jinn...\u201d His words broke off in a squeal as Salvatore\u2019s power once again reached out, striking the cur like the lash of a whip.</p><p>\u201cHess, on how many occasions have I told you that if I want your opinion I\u2019ll ask for it?\u201d Salvatore drawled.</p><p>The cur lowered his head. \u201cForgive me, sire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe cringing cretin is not entirely wrong.\u201d Levet waddled forward, his long tail twitching. \u201cIt had to have been the demon who killed Duncan and knocked both of us out.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo one is asking you to join us, gargoyle,\u201d Salvatore snapped.</p><p>\u201cSacre bleu. I am not going to be left alone in these tunnels.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen chase after the vampire.\u201d</p><p>The damned gargoyle refused to budge, a sly amusement entering the gray eyes.</p><p>\u201cDarcy would not be pleased if something was to happen to me. And if Darcy is not happy, then Styx is not happy.\u201d</p><p>Salvatore snapped his teeth. Darcy was one of the female purebloods he\u2019d been searching for over the past thirty years, and while he didn\u2019t have the least fear of her, she\u2019d recently mated with the King of Vampires.</p><p>Styx he did fear.</p><p>Hey, he wasn\u2019t stupid.</p> <p>Muttering a curse, Salvatore led the way down the tunnel, his already pissy mood plunging to foul.</p><p>\u201cGet in my way and I\u2019ll chop you up and feed you to the vultures. Understood, gargoyle?\u201d</p><p>He sensed his curs falling into step behind him, with Levet bringing up the rear.</p><p>\u201cMangy dogs can smooch my posterior,\u201d the gargoyle muttered.</p><p>\u201cA jinn is not the only creature capable of ripping off a wing,\u201d Salvatore warned.</p><p>A blessed silence filled the dark tunnel, and at last able to concentrate on the faint trail of cur, Salvatore quickened his pace.</p><p>It was moments like this that he regretted leaving Italy.</p><p>In his elegant lair near Rome, no one dared treat him as anything other than Master of the Universe. His word was law, and his underlings scrambled to do his bidding. Best of all, there were no filthy vampires or stunted gargoyles.</p><p>Unfortunately, he\u2019d had no choice in the matter.</p><p>The Weres were becoming extinct. Pureblooded females could no longer control their shifts during pregnancy, and more often than not lost their babies before they could be born. Even the bite of Weres was losing its potency. A new cur had not been created in years.</p><p>Salvatore had to act, and after years of research, his very expensive scientists had at last managed to alter the DNA of four female pureblood babies so they could not shift.</p><p>They were a miracle. Born to save the Weres.</p><p>Until they had been stolen from the nursery.</p><p>He growled low in his throat, his anger still a potent force even after thirty years. He had wasted far too much time searching through Europe before he at last traveled to America and managed to stumble across two of the female Weres. Unfortunately Darcy was in the hands of Styx, while Regan had proven to be infertile.</p><p>During his trip to Hannibal, however, he\u2019d managed to discover that the babies had at some point been in the hands of Caine, a cur with a death wish who\u2019d convinced himself that he would be capable of using the blood of the females to turn common curs into Weres. Moron.</p><p>Salvatore had been in a cabin to meet with one of Caine\u2019s pack who\u2019d promised to reveal the traitor\u2019s location, when he and Levet had been knocked unconscious and kidnapped.</p><p>It had to have been Caine who attacked him.</p><p>Now the bastard was leaving a trail straight to his lair.</p><p>A smile curved Salvatore\u2019s lips. He intended to savor ripping out the traitor\u2019s throat.</p><p>A near half hour passed as Salvatore weaved his way through the winding tunnel, his steps slowing as he tilted back his head to sniff the air.</p><p>The scent of cur was still strong, but he was beginning to pick up the distant scent of other curs, and...pureblood.</p><p>Female pureblood.</p><p>Coming to a sharp halt, Salvatore savored the rich vanilla aroma that filled his senses.</p><p>He loved the smell of women. Hell, he loved women.</p><p>But this was different.</p><p>It was intoxicating.</p><p>\u201cCristo,\u201d he breathed, his blood racing, an odd tightness coiling through his body, slowly draining his strength.</p><p>Almost as if...</p><p>No. It wasn\u2019t possible.</p><p>There hadn\u2019t been a true Were mating for centuries.</p><p>\u201cCurs,\u201d Levet said, moving to his side. \u201cAnd a female pureblood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSi,\u201d Salvatore muttered, distracted.</p><p>\u201cYou think it\u2019s a trap?\u201d</p><p>Salvatore swallowed a grim laugh. Hell, he hoped it was a trap. The alternative was enough to send any intelligent Were howling into the night.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s only one way to find out.\u201d</p><p>He moved forward, sensing the end of the tunnel just yards in front of him.</p><p>\u201cSalvatore?\u201d Levet tugged on his pants.</p><p>Salvatore shook him off. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou smell funny. Mon Dieu, are you...\u201d</p><p>With blinding speed, Salvatore grasped the gargoyle by one stunted horn and yanked him off his feet to glare into his ugly face. Until that moment, he hadn\u2019t noticed the musky scent that clung to his skin.</p><p>Merda.</p><p>\u201cOne more word and you lose that tongue,\u201d he snarled.</p><p>\u201cBut...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo not screw with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do not intend to screw with anyone.\u201d The gargoyle curled his lips in a mocking smile. \u201cI am not the one in heat.\u201d</p><p>Hess appeared beside Salvatore, halting his urge to rip off the gargoyle\u2019s head.</p><p>A pity.</p><p>\u201cSire?\u201d the cur demanded, his thick brow furrowed.</p><p>\u201cTake Max and the other curs and keep guard on the rear. I don\u2019t want anyone sneaking up on us,\u201d he commanded.</p><p>It was unlikely the cur would recognize Salvatore\u2019s disturbing reaction to the female\u2019s scent. Hess hadn\u2019t even been transformed when the last mating had happened. Not to mention the fact that he was as thick as a stump. But Levet was certainly annoying enough to let the cat out of the bag.</p><p>Waiting for the curs to grudgingly shift back, he gave the gargoyle a shake before dropping him onto the ground.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2014not another word.\u201d</p><p>Regaining his balance, Levet glanced upward, his wings fluttering and his tail twitching.</p><p>\u201cUm. Actually, I have two words,\u201d he muttered. Then, without warning, he was charging forward, ramming directly into Salvatore and sending him flying backwards. \u201cCAVE-IN!!!\u201d</p><p>Momentarily stunned, Salvatore watched in horror as the low ceiling abruptly gave way, sending an avalanche of dirt and stone into the tunnel.</p><p>Because of Levet\u2019s swift action, he had avoided the worst of the landslide, but rising to his feet he was in no mood for gratitude. Hard to believe this hideous day had just gotten worse.</p><p>Moving to the wall of debris that blocked the tunnel, he sent out his sense to find his curs.</p><p>\u201cHess?\u201d he shouted.</p><p>Levet coughed at the cloud of dust that filled the air. \u201cAre they...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re injured, but alive,\u201d Salvatore said, able to pick up the heartbeats of his pack, although they were currently unconscious. \u201cCan we dig our way through to them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would take hours, and we risk bringing even more down on our heads.\u201d</p><p>Of course. Why the hell would it be easy?</p><p>\u201cDamn.\u201d</p><p>The gargoyle shook the dirt off his wings. \u201cThe tunnel is clear behind them. Once they recover they should be able to find a way out.\u201d</p><p>He was right. Hess might have a brain the size of a walnut, but he was as tenacious as a pit bull. Once he realized he wouldn\u2019t be able to reach Salvatore, he would lead the others back to the cabin and return overland to dig them out.</p><p>Unfortunately, it would take hours.</p><p>Turning, he glanced toward the stone wall that marked the end of the tunnel. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Whatever exit the cur had used to get out of the tunnel was now buried beneath the rubble.</p><p>\u201cWhich is more than I can say for us,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cBah.\u201d With a flagrant disregard to the thin sliver of ceiling that hadn\u2019t yet fallen on their heads, Levet gingerly climbed up the side of the tunnel. \u201cI am a gargoyle.\u201d</p> <p>Salvatore sucked in a sharp breath. A ton of rock and dirt falling on his head wouldn\u2019t kill him.</p><p>Being buried alive with Levet? That would be the end.</p><p>If he had to rip out his own heart with his bare hands.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m painfully aware of who and what you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can smell the night.\u201d Levet paused and glanced over his shoulder. \u201cAre you coming, or what?\u201d</p> <p>With no other legitimate options, Salvatore awkwardly scrambled behind the gargoyle, his pride as tattered as his Italian leather shoes.</p><p>\u201cDamn lump of stone,\u201d he breathed. \u201cJagr should rot in hell for sticking me with you.\u201d</p><p>Nearly flicking Salvatore\u2019s nose with the tip of his tail, Levet continued upward, sniffing the air. He paused as he reached the edge of the ceiling, his hands testing the seemingly smooth rock until he abruptly shoved upward, revealing the cleverly hidden door.</p><p>Levet disappeared through the narrow opening and Salvatore was swift to follow, grasping the edge of the hole and pulling himself out of the tunnel.</p><p>He crawled through the dew-dampened grass, heading away from the opening before at last rising to his feet and sucking in the fresh air.</p><p>Weres weren\u2019t like most demons who enjoyed being hidden in damp, moldy caves and tunnels for centuries on end. A Were needed open space to run and hunt.</p> <p>With a shudder, Salvatore glanced around the thick trees that surrounded him, his senses reaching out to make certain there was no immediate threat.</p><p>\u201cTa-da.\u201d With a flutter of his wings, Levet landed directly in front of Salvatore, his expression smug. \u201cShove it up your ear, oh ye of little faith. Hey...where are you going?\u201d</p><p>Brushing past the annoying pest, Salvatore was weaving his way through the trees.</p><p>\u201cTo kill me a cur.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, we can\u2019t go alone,\u201d Levet protested, his tiny legs pumping to keep pace. \u201cBesides, it is almost dawn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just want to find his lair before he manages to cover his trail. I\u2019m not losing him again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that is all? You promise you will not do anything stupid until we have front up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBack up, you fool.\u201d The sweet scent of vanilla invaded Salvatore\u2019s senses, clouding his mind and stealing his waning strength. \u201cNow be quiet.\u201d</p> <p>At a glance, Harley was the spitting image of a Barbie doll.</p><p>She stood barely over five feet, her body was slender, her heart-shaped face was delicately carved with large hazel eyes that were thickly lashed, and her golden blond hair that tumbled past her shoulders gave her the image of a fragile angel. She also looked far younger than her thirty years.</p><p>Anyone, however, stupid enough to dismiss her as harmless usually ended up injured.</p><p>Or dead.</p><p>She was not only a full-blooded Were, but she took her training in combat skills to a level that Navy SEALS would envy.</p><p>She was working out in the full-scale gym when Caine returned to the vast colonial home. She continued lifting the weights that would crush most men as she absently listened to his bitter tirade about the ineptitude of his cur pack and the injustice of a world that contained Salvatore Giuliani, the King of Weres.</p><p>At last, Harley moved to take a swig of bottled water and wiped the sweat coating her face. She glanced toward Caine, who leaned negligently against the far wall, his jeans and muscle shirt filthy, his short blond hair tousled. Not that his bedraggled appearance dimmed his surfer good looks. Even beneath the fluorescent lights that made everyone appear like death warmed over, his tanned skin glowed with a rich bronze and his blue eyes shimmered like the finest sapphires.</p><p>He was gorgeous. And he knew it.</p><p>Barf.</p><p>Harley\u2019s lips twisted. Her relationship with Caine was complicated.</p><p>The cur had been her guardian since she was a baby, but while he\u2019d protected her and kept her in considerable luxury, she\u2019d never truly trusted him.</p><p>And the feeling was entirely mutual.</p><p>Caine allowed her to roam the house and the surrounding lands with seeming freedom, but she knew she was under constant surveillance. And God knew, she was never allowed to travel away from the estate without two or three of Caine\u2019s pet curs. Caine claimed he was concerned for her safety, but Harley wasn\u2019t stupid. She knew his motives were far more selfish.</p><p>It might have been tempting to escape her golden cage, save for the knowledge that a lone wolf, even a pureblood, rarely survived. Weres were by nature predators, and there were any number of demons that would be eager to rid the world of a Were if they could catch one without a pack\u2019s protection.</p><p>Besides, there was always the fear that the King of Weres was out there somewhere, anxious to kill her as he had her three sisters. Caine might be determined to use her for his own purpose, but at least that purpose meant he had to keep her alive.</p><p>Tossing aside the towel, Harley sent her companion a mocking smile.</p><p>\u201cLet me see if I have this straight. You went to Hannibal because Sadie created some mysterious mess that you had to clean up after, and while you were there, you brilliantly decided to kidnap the King of Weres, only to drop him like a hot potato when you were nearly caught by a vampire and pack of curs?\u201d</p><p>Caine pushed away from the wall and prowled forward, his gaze skimming over her tight spandex shorts and sports bra. The cur was nothing if not predictable. He\u2019d been trying to seduce her for years.</p><p>\u201cYou have it in a perfect little nutshell, sweet Harley.\u201d He halted directly before her, toying with her ponytail that had fallen over her shoulder. \u201cDo you want a reward?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd your pet jinn?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSlipped from her leash. She\u2019ll be back.\u201d His smile was taunting. \u201cLike you, she has nowhere else to go.\u201d</p><p>Harley jerked from his touch. Bastard.</p><p>\u201cSo now you\u2019ve lost half your pack and your demon, and you\u2019ve left behind a trail that will lead the pissed off King of Weres and his angry posse directly to this lair.\u201d</p><p>Caine shrugged. \u201cI\u2019ll call for one of the local witches. My trail will be long gone by the time the almighty Salvatore manages to get out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet out of where?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI collapsed the tunnel on top of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod. Are you even barely sane?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnce they manage to heal enough to dig out of the rubble, they\u2019ll discover the entrance has been completely blocked. They will have no choice but to turn back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re pretty damned cocky for a cur who has just pissed off your royal master.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a master,\u201d Caine snarled, revealing a glimpse of resentment at being a lowly cur instead of a full Were, before he smoothed out his expression. \u201cAnd besides, the prophecies have spoken. I\u2019m destined to transform the curs into purebloods. Nothing can happen to me.\u201d</p><p>Harley snorted. Caine wasn\u2019t a complete loon. He managed to control his large pack that he had spread throughout the Midwest with an iron hand. He was a Harvard trained scientist who made a fortune with his black market drugs. He regularly kicked her ass at Scrabble.</p><p>But at some point in his very long life, he claimed he\u2019d been visited by an ancient pureblood who had given him a vision. Harley didn\u2019t pretend to understand it. Something about seeing his blood run pure.</p><p>Being a scientist, he naturally assumed this miracle would be performed in a lab, which was why he kept Harley as his permanent houseguest. He thought by studying her blood he could find the answers he sought. Moronic, of course. Visions were the stuff of mist and magic, not glass beakers and microscopes.</p><p>\u201cLook, if you want to get yourself killed because of your delusions of grandeur, I don\u2019t give a shit.\u201d She narrowed her eyes. \u201cBut I\u2019m not going to be happy if you put me in the firing line.\u201d</p><p>Caine stepped forward, reaching to trail his fingers over her shoulder. His touch was warm, experienced. She shook him off.</p><p>A woman would have to be dead not to find Caine attractive, but Harley needed more than simple lust. She needed...hell, she didn\u2019t know what she needed, only that she hadn\u2019t yet found it.</p><p>Besides, her skin was suddenly feeling hypersensitive. As if it had been rubbed raw by sandpaper.</p><p>\u201cWould I ever put you in danger, sweet Harley?\u201d Caine goaded.</p><p>\u201cIn a heartbeat, if it meant saving your own hide.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarsh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps.\u201d His gaze dipped downward, studying her sports bra. \u201cI need a shower. Why don\u2019t you join me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn your dreams.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvery night. Do you want to know what we\u2019re doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather yank out your tongue and eat it for dinner.\u201d</p><p>With a laugh, he snapped his teeth near her nose. \u201cNaughty Were. You know how it makes me hard when you threaten violence.\u201d</p><p>Spinning on her heel, Harley headed for the door. \u201cYou\u2019d better make that a cold shower or you won\u2019t have to worry about Salvatore Giuliani slicing off your balls. I\u2019ll already have them dangling from my rear view mirror.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She tuned out Caine\u2019s low laugh as she headed toward the front of the house.</p><p>It was late and she was tired, but she ignored the carved wooden staircase that led to the bedrooms as she entered the paneled foyer.</p><p>What the hell was wrong with her?</p> <p>She felt restless and on edge. As if there was a looming thunderstorm and she was about to be struck by lightning.</p><p>Telling herself it was nothing more than frustration with Caine and the mysterious games that were being played around her, she yanked open the door and stepped outside.</p><p>What she needed was a walk.</p><p>And if that didn\u2019t work, then there was always cheesecake in the fridge.</p><p>There was nothing in the world that couldn\u2019t be cured by cheesecake.</p> <p>Chapter Two</p><p>Salvatore crouched in the bushes and studied the large home that was stuck in the middle of nowhere.</p><p>Like most colonial homes, it had a lot of bricks and fluted columns, with a double row of tall windows that would give a vampire nightmares. There was a large front terrace with a sweeping drive that was lined by oak trees, and a covered pool behind the four-car garage.</p><p>A nice crib for a mere cur, but Salvatore\u2019s interest wasn\u2019t in architecture.</p><p>Instead, he tested the late spring air, futilely attempting to ignore the pervasive scent of vanilla that seeped through his body like the finest aphrodisiac, and concentrated on the bastard who had dared to try to kidnap him.</p><p>He might have escaped, but he wasn\u2019t the forgive-and-forget type.</p> <p>\u201cThe cur\u2019s inside,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cHoly cow.\u201d Levet flapped his wings, standing on tiptoe to glance over the bush. \u201cDo you pay all your curs like AIG executives or do the lunatic fringe receive special bonuses?\u201d</p><p>Salvatore\u2019s retort died on his lips as the door was suddenly pushed open and a female pureblood stepped into the night.</p><p>She was stunningly familiar. As one of quadruplets, she possessed her sisters\u2019 pale blond hair and slender body. A body that was deliciously revealed by her stretchy shorts and tiny bit of spandex that passed as a top. He would also bet his Rolex her eyes were a perfect emerald.</p><p>But that\u2019s where the similarity ended.</p><p>Both her sisters, Darcy and Regan, possessed the electric energy of all Weres. But this woman. Cristo, he could feel her vibrant power charging the air a half mile away.</p><p>His wolf stirred beneath his skin, straining to be closer to the female that called to him at his most primitive level.</p><p>\u201cSalvatore?\u201d Levet snapped his fingers in front of Salvatore\u2019s eyes. \u201cHelllooo. Anyone home?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t bother me, gargoyle,\u201d Salvatore growled.</p><p>\u201cYou promised you would find the cur\u2019s lair and then we would wait for...\u201d The three-foot pest sucked in a sharp breath as he at last caught sight of the woman strolling toward a marble fountain. \u201cOh. Darcy\u2019s sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSalvatore, you are not going to do something stupid, are you?\u201d Levet stomped his foot as Salvatore rose and stepped around the bush. \u201cMon Dieu. Why do I even ask? Of course you are going to do something stupid. And who do you suppose is the one who is going to get hurt? Moi. That is who.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReturn to the bushes,\u201d Salvatore snapped, his attention never wavering from the woman who had suddenly stiffened and turned in his direction.</p><p>\u201cDo you never watch horror films, stupide?\u201d Levet squeaked. \u201cIt is always the one who stays behind who Jason or Freddie or Michael Myers chops in half.\u201d</p><p>Salvatore made a Herculean effort to ignore his companion as he slid forward. The female had sensed his presence and was preparing to bolt.</p><p>That was unacceptable.</p><p>And not just because he\u2019d been searching for her for the past thirty years.</p><p>Hell, that was at the very bottom of the list.</p><p>Way below getting her naked and into the nearest bed.</p><p>She took a wary step back as Salvatore neared, and he forced himself to come to a halt, raising a hand in a gesture of peace.</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes narrowed (not emerald, but instead a stunning hazel with flecks of gold), and her expression hardened, but there was no fear. His fascination ratcheted up another notch.</p><p>There was nothing sexier than a woman who knew she could take care of herself.</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d she demanded, her low, husky voice brushing over him like a physical caress.</p><p>\u201cSalvatore Giuliani.\u201d</p><p>Recognition flashed through her eyes. Unfortunately, it wasn\u2019t the good kind of recognition. Not like finding the perfect silk tie to match his new Armani suit. More like a woman who turned over a rock and didn\u2019t like what crawled out.</p><p>\u201cGod,\u201d she breathed. \u201cCaine is an idiot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarley.\u201d</p><p>He stretched out his hand. \u201cCome to me, Harley.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I should believe you, why?\u201d</p><p>Salvatore frowned. She wasn\u2019t acting like a Were who\u2019d been kidnapped and held captive by a deranged cur.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here to rescue you.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, her hair shimmering with pale beauty even in the darkness.</p><p>\u201cHip-frigging-hooray for you. Who said I wanted to be rescued?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t being held against your will?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one holds me against my will.\u201d She flicked a dismissive gaze over his less than pristine suit. \u201cEspecially not a man.\u201d</p><p>Salvatore growled low in his throat. He didn\u2019t get dismissive glances from women. Women drooled and panted and sometimes fainted when he entered a room.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d he rasped. \u201cYou\u2019re coming with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery smooth, Romeo.\u201d Levet moved to stand at his side. \u201cIt\u2019s no wonder the Weres are nearly extinct.\u201d</p><p>Salvatore glared at the gargoyle. It didn\u2019t improve his mood to know the miniature demon was right. He could seduce a woman with a mere glance, so why was he barely restraining his urge to snap and snarl?</p><p>Because the female was his, a voice whispered in the back of his mind. And she was damned well going to admit it.</p><p>\u201cLevet,\u201d he warned as the demon waddled forward.</p><p>\u201cShh. Allow the master to work.\u201d With a flick of his tail, Levet halted directly in front of Harley, and performed an awkward bow. \u201cPlease forgive my oafish companion, beautiful Harley. He is never troubled by the need to display good manners.\u201d He heaved a dramatic sigh. \u201cRoyalty, you cannot live with them, cannot slice off their heads. Well, not without a great deal of stupid fuss.\u201d The delicate wings fluttered. \u201cWhat Salvatore intended to say was that we would be deeply honored to have your company so we can converse with you over a lovely meal.\u201d He licked his lips. \u201cPerhaps a roasted ox. Or two.\u201d</p><p>A reluctant smile curved Harley\u2019s lips and Salvatore swallowed a sigh. Men wanted to drown the gargoyle on sight, women inevitably found him charming. It was as unfathomable as black holes.</p><p>\u201cI like you,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cBut of course you do, ma belle. I am quite irresistible to the opposite sex. It is a blessing...and a curse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnough.\u201d Salvatore scowled. \u201cI have been searching for you for a long time, Harley. You\u2019re not going to escape me now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah?\u201d A slow, taunting smile curved her lips. \u201cThen come and get me.\u201d</p><p>She whirled on her heel and with startling speed, was headed toward the side of the house.</p><p>In less than a heartbeat, Salvatore was giving chase, his brain shutting down as his predatory nature took over.</p><p>He didn\u2019t know what he intended to do when he caught her. Bite her, bed her, or toss her over his shoulder and lock her in his lair. But it was going to be deeply satisfying.</p><p>\u201cSalvatore...\u201d Levet called, his voice nothing but a distant annoyance.</p><p>His only thought was catching the slender form that was rounding the corner of the house.</p><p>Had he been in his right mind, he would never have given chase. Madre del dio, it had trap written all over it. As it was, his only thought was sweet vanilla and warm woman.</p><p>Cutting the corner around the house, he had a nanosecond to realize that Harley had come to a halt and was standing with a smug grin on her lips. Then the earth beneath his feet began to shift and he was falling through empty air.</p><p>\u201cSucker,\u201d the woman called, adding insult to injury as Salvatore hit the paved floor and the top of the silver cage slammed shut above him.</p><p>Harley\u2019s heart was thundering in her chest as she paused at the entrance to the basement.</p><p>A part of her was damned proud of herself.</p><p>After years of having Salvatore Giuliani\u2019s name used as her personal boogeyman, she hadn\u2019t panicked when he\u2019d suddenly appeared. In fact, she\u2019d coolly stood her ground, and even lured the mighty King of Weres into her trap.</p><p>Piece of cake.</p><p>Harley blew out a sigh and wiped the sweat from her brow.</p><p>Liar, liar.</p><p>Her seeming composure had been nothing more than shock and temporary insanity.</p><p>The shock had been a result of the realization that the powerful Were who wanted her dead had finally tracked her down, and was standing just a few feet away. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The insanity was the raw, undeniable reaction to Salvatore\u2019s presence.</p><p>Frigging hell.</p><p>Caine had warned her that Salvatore was a powerful beast. Werewolves didn\u2019t have hereditary royalty. They fought and schemed and bullied their way to the top. Like Top Model, only with a lot more blood and less boobs.</p> <p>What Caine hadn\u2019t mentioned was that Salvatore was drop-dead, mouthwateringly gorgeous.</p><p>A shudder shook her at the thought of his lean, darkly handsome face and eyes like liquid gold. His features were pure Latin, with a long aquiline nose and full lips. His hair was a rich wave of raven satin that flowed just past his shoulders. And his body...yum. Even beneath the filthy suit, she could tell it was lean and hard in all the right places.</p><p>Still, she\u2019d seen handsome men before.</p><p>Caine was no slouch in the looks department.</p><p>So why hadn\u2019t any of them made her blood sizzle and her palms sweat?</p> <p>It was like he possessed some sort of electric charge that was the precise current to push her buttons.</p><p>All her buttons.</p><p>She knocked her head against the wall, telling herself to stop being an idiot.</p><p>So, Salvatore had an animal magnetism. No doubt being the king gave him an extra umph or something. That didn\u2019t mean she was about to forget the fact that the bastard had killed her sisters.</p><p>Or that he\u2019d been hunting her for years.</p><p>Damn his black soul.</p> <p>She wished he\u2019d never shown up, she told herself sternly. But now that she had him caged, she wanted answers.</p><p>Hiding her unease behind a mocking smile, Harley pushed open the door and stepped inside.</p><p>The basement was divided in half, one side being a high-tech lab where Caine practiced his scientific voodoo, and this side being an equally high-tech prison. Usually the three silver cages were used for curs who were stupid enough to piss off Caine, but over the past months Caine had installed the triggered traps in the yard to discourage intruders.</p><p>Her mouth went dry as she spotted Salvatore standing in the middle of the closest silver cage.</p><p>If he was dangerous before, now he was nothing less than feral.</p><p>The golden eyes glowed with a tangible heat, his lips curled to reveal the white teeth that could grow to lethal fangs in the blink of an eye.</p><p>\u201cLet me out of here,\u201d he demanded, his voice thick.</p><p>Harley forced her reluctant feet forward, refusing to be unnerved by the choking power that filled the room. God Almighty, she\u2019d never felt anything like it.</p> <p>\u201cBut I just went to so much effort to get you in there,\u201d she taunted. \u201cWell, maybe it wasn\u2019t so much effort. Like all men, you see a woman and assume you naturally have the upper hand.\u201d</p><p>Salvatore stilled, his fury morphing into something far more dangerous. With a slow glide, his gaze seared over her body, taking his sweet time in memorizing her every curve before lifting back to her face.</p><p>\u201cLet me guess, you\u2019re a woman who likes to be on top?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome in here and I can show you the benefits of being on the bottom.\u201d</p><p>A disturbing shiver raced through her body. \u201cBeing royalty really has gone to your head if you think a lame-ass line like that would ever work on a woman with half a brain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen there must be thousands of women with half a brain,\u201d he drawled.</p><p>\u201cThe plastic blow-up kinds don\u2019t count.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCara, I could make you roll over and beg.\u201d</p><p>Harley tilted her chin. Damn, what was it about this Were?</p><p>She should be getting a gun and shooting him in the head, not imagining his precise technique of getting her to roll over and beg.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather do the gargoyle.\u201d</p><p>Salvatore tilted back his head and delicately sniffed the air. He chuckled.</p><p>\u201cLiar.\u201d</p><p>Shit. Harley abruptly turned on her heel and studied the numerous torture devises hung on the cement wall.</p><p>\u201cYou said you\u2019ve been searching for me,\u201d she rasped.</p><p>\u201cSi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re a very special Were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpecial?\u201d Her sharp bark of laughter echoed eerily through the room. \u201cDon\u2019t you mean defective?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re perfect,\u201d he smoothly countered, his voice brushing over her skin like warm velvet. \u201cJust as you were intended to be.\u201d</p><p>She abruptly turned back to stab him with a furious scowl. \u201cAs my sisters were before you killed them?\u201d</p><p>Salvatore flinched, feeling as if he\u2019d just taken a punch to the gut.</p><p>He\u2019d been accused of a number of despicable things, many of them true. But this...</p><p>\u201cDio,\u201d Salvatore breathed. \u201cWhat the hell are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you think I didn\u2019t know you hunted down my sisters and murdered them in cold blood?\u201d</p><p>Salvatore\u2019s lips curled in a humorless smile, his shock being replaced by a grim comprehension. He\u2019d wondered why Harley was treating him as the enemy rather than being desperate to flee Caine\u2019s clutches.</p><p>\u201cClever bastard,\u201d he muttered, stepping close enough to the silver bars to feel the painful prickles crawling over his skin. Weres were deathly allergic to silver. In fact, it was one of the few things that could actually kill a pureblood. Silver through the heart, or decapitation. \u201cI\u2019ll admit there have been any number of occasions Darcy and Regan have inspired thoughts of homicide, but I\u2019ve risked my life to protect them, even after they were stupid enough to choose vampires to act as their guardians. The only danger to your sisters is Caine.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes narrowed. \u201cYou\u2019re lying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t believe me, then let me go and I\u2019ll take you to them. Darcy is in Chicago with Styx and Regan was headed there to join her, the last I heard. I\u2019m certain by now Jagr\u2019s hot on her trail. Besotted idiot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, right.\u201d She folded her arms over her chest, but Salvatore didn\u2019t miss the uncertainty that flashed through her eyes. Her faith in Caine wasn\u2019t absolute. \u201cI suppose you also have a bridge you\u2019re trying to unload? I\u2019m not buying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no reason to lie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you frigging kidding me?\u201d She deliberately glanced over her shoulder at the splendid collection of whips, daggers, swords, and even a good old-fashioned mace. \u201cYou have every reason to lie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUse your brains, Harley. If I wanted you dead, we wouldn\u2019t be having this conversation.\u201d</p><p>Her lips tightened in annoyance. She couldn\u2019t deny the truth. If he\u2019d attacked to kill, she wouldn\u2019t be standing there.</p><p>\u201cYou murdered my sisters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy the hell would I murder pureblooded females I invested millions of dollars and decades of my life to produce?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you didn\u2019t want the Weres to know their king had failed in his Frankenstein experiments. You had to get rid of the evidence.\u201d</p><p>Salvatore had intended to kill Caine before ever arriving at the estate. Now he intended to kill him slowly.</p><p>With as much pain as inhumanly possible.</p><p>\u201cMy only failure was allowing you to be stolen from the nursery. You...\u201d His gaze skimmed over her beautiful, heart-shaped face, his body humming with a constant awareness. \u201cAre flawless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit.\u201d Her expression hardened. \u201cI can\u2019t shift.\u201d</p><p>Her smoldering frustration filled the air. Ah. Now at least now he understood a portion of her thorny personality.</p><p>\u201cIs that why you overcompensate? Because you can\u2019t shift?\u201d</p><p>Lifting her hand, she flipped him off. \u201cOvercompensate this.\u201d</p><p>Salvatore chuckled. It was insanity. He\u2019d allowed his hormones to overcome his common sense, and now he was locked in the cage of his archenemy with no immediate hope of escape. He should be infuriated. He should be using his powers to attempt to bend the female to his will.</p><p>Instead, he was hot and bothered and barely able to think of anything beyond this female who was swiftly becoming an obsession.</p><p>\u201cTo keep you from shifting was precisely the reason for my Frankenstein experiments, as you call them. Female Weres have lost their ability to suppress their shifts during the full moon. It has made it nearly impossible for pregnant Weres to carry their young to full term.\u201d He caught and held her gaze. \u201cWe are vanishing, Harley, and you hold the hope for our future.\u201d</p><p>She licked her lips, caught between the urge to tell him to go to hell and a grudging need to know more.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re saying you cooked me and my sisters up in your lab to save the Were species?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were genetically altered, si.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd my sisters? Are they out producing the children you\u2019re so desperate to have?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRegan was unfortunately barren, although it hardly matters since she was busy falling in love with a leech the last time I saw her. And Darcy...\u201d Salvatore grimaced. \u201cShe was a disappointment as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe had the same pathetic taste for the living challenged.\u201d</p><p>Her brows lifted. \u201cI assume you mean a vampire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot just any vampire.\u201d There was an edge to his voice. That happened a lot when the walking dead entered the conversation. \u201cShe mated with the Anasso, King of Vampires.

I suspect Caine knows where she is.\u201d</p><p>She halted unconsciously close to the cage, her eyes troubled as she shook her head.</p><p>\u201cNo. I don\u2019t believe you.\u201d</p><p>Salvatore was a Were who firmly believed in grasping opportunity. Especially when that opportunity included a gorgeous female who set his blood on fire.</p> <p>\u201cThen believe this.\u201d He reached through the bars, grabbing the straps of her sports bra and yanking her close enough to kiss her. A groan rumbled deep in his throat. She tasted of exotic spices and danger. He shivered as wild lightning streaked through him. \u201cYou\u2019re mine,\u201d he whispered against her lips.</p><p>For a breathless minute she softened against him, seemingly as indifferent as Salvatore to the painful silver between them. Then with a muttered curse, she pulled away, her eyes dark with alarm.</p><p>\u201cCaine\u2019s right. You\u2019re a lunatic.\u201d</p><p>With a glare that would have seared the skin off a lesser man, Harley stormed from the room and slammed the door behind her.</p><p>Lunatic.</p><p>Salvatore shoved his fingers through his hair.</p> <p>He couldn\u2019t agree more.</p><p>Harley reached the top of the stairs when Caine appeared in the hallway, a pair of faded denims riding low on his hips, his hair still damp from the shower.</p><p>\u201cI heard the alarm.\u201d His eyes darted to the door she\u2019d just closed behind her. \u201cWhat the hell is going on?\u201d</p><p>Harley blocked the door, her emotions in an unpleasant jumble. And all because of that stupid Were.</p><p>Wasn\u2019t it bad enough that he\u2019d managed to make her question everything that Caine had ever told her? Not that she had ever been fully on board with Caine\u2019s smooth stories. They had changed too often over the years to be completely believable.</p><p>But to use his kingly mojo or whatever it was to make her melt beneath his kiss.</p><p>It was despicable.</p><p>She lifted a hand and pressed it to her lips. They still tingled with pleasure. And they weren\u2019t the only thing tingling.</p> <p>It had to be that damned musky smell of his. It was some sort of Were aphrodisiac or something.</p><p>Stirring up her anger to cover the craving that still prickled through her body, Harley pointed a finger in Caine\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cI warned you that your delusions of grandeur were going to get you killed,\u201d she snarled. \u201cSalvatore has dropped in for a visit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d Caine\u2019s face paled. \u201cDid you get him? Is he caged?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you mean did I save your ass from certain death? Yes, I did.\u201d</p><p>Caine glanced toward the closed door to the basement, his brow furrowed.</p><p>\u201cI need to make a phone call.\u201d</p><p>A phone call? Harley narrowed her gaze. The cur was acting strangely, even for Caine.</p><p>\u201cFine. I\u2019ll keep an eye on the prisoner.\u201d</p><p>Like a striking snake, Caine reached out to grab her arm. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>His smile was strained. \u201cYou think I would risk you being in the same room as a rabid Were who has sworn to kill you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s locked in a silver cage. For the moment he\u2019s helpless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA pureblood is never helpless.\u201d</p><p>Harley studied the too-handsome face. Caine didn\u2019t want her near Salvatore. The question was, why?</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re afraid he might escape, that\u2019s all the more reason I should keep watch on him.\u201d</p><p>The blue eyes glowed in the dim light of the hall. \u201cI have curs to take care of guard duty. You have better things to do with your time.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cNot really. Besides, I want to talk with the Were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTalk to him about what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes it matter?\u201d</p><p>His fingers tightened on her arm. \u201cOf course it does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you exposed to the filth he\u2019s bound to spew.\u201d</p><p>Harley snorted. Like most nonhumans, Caine managed to adopt the social norms that flowed and changed with the passage of time, but every so often he showed his age. The older demons were even worse.</p><p>\u201cSpew?\u201d</p><p>The glow in his eyes shimmered with blue fire, revealing he was hanging onto his wolf by a thread. Curs were always at the mercy of their emotions.</p><p>\u201cSalvatore is notorious for fabricating lies that hide his evil nature. The Weres would never have allowed him to stay in power otherwise.\u201d</p><p>She yanked her arm out of his grasp. \u201cDo you mean lies like the fact that two of my sisters are alive and well, and currently living in Chicago?\u201d</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>Harley watched the anger ripple over Caine\u2019s face before he clenched his jaw and studied her with a wary gaze.</p><p>\u201cYou already spoke to Salvatore?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a brief discussion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat else did he say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe mentioned that far from wanting me and my sisters dead, he has been trying to save us.\u201d She deliberately paused. \u201cFrom you.\u201d</p><p>His false laughter echoed through the hallway. \u201cThat bastard. He would say anything to save his worthless hide. You weren\u2019t stupid enough to believe his lies, were you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not.\u201d Harley smiled, able to lie with the best of them.</p><p>At the moment, she didn\u2019t know what she believed.</p><p>She didn\u2019t trust Caine. And she sure as hell didn\u2019t trust Salvatore.</p><p>All she knew for certain was that she wanted answers.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He brushed the back of his hands down her cheek, allowing his fingers to linger on the curve of her neck. \u201cHe\u2019s dangerous, Harley. You need to stay away from him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he\u2019s so dangerous, why don\u2019t you just kill him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd have every Were in the world wanting to nail my ass to the wall?\u201d he smoothly demanded. \u201cNo, thank you.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, right. She narrowed her gaze.</p><p>\u201cHolding him captive isn\u2019t going to make the Weres any happier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho will know that I\u2019m holding him?\u201d His hand deliberately encircled her throat. \u201cHe was alone, wasn\u2019t he? I assume you would have mentioned if he had his pack of curs with him.\u201d</p><p>Harley abruptly recalled the tiny gargoyle. After capturing Salvatore, he\u2019d slipped her mind.</p><p>She knocked Caine\u2019s hand from her throat. \u201cYeah, completely alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere you go then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe vampire chasing you will suspect you\u2019re involved in Salvatore\u2019s disappearance.\u201d</p><p>She could sense him scrambling for a suitable lie. \u201cNot if I force the dog to call his pack and assure them that he\u2019s fine and on my trail. By the time they figure it out, we\u2019ll be long gone.\u201d</p><p>She snorted at his ridiculous boast. Caine might be a bad-assed cur, but he was a pale imitation of Salvatore Giuliani.</p><p>\u201cYou think you can force the King of Weres to do anything?\u201d</p><p>Without warning he moved forward, his pride clearly pricked by her patent disbelief. He crowded her against the wall and lowered his head until he was speaking directly against her mouth.</p><p>\u201cNever underestimate my powers of persuasion.\u201d</p><p>She lifted her hands and pressed them against his bare chest. \u201cIf you want to keep those lips, then you\u2019d best remove them.\u201d</p><p>He stepped back with a mocking smile. \u201cSomeday, sweet Harley.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you have a phone call to make?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want your promise you\u2019ll stay out of the basement.\u201d</p><p>She met his gaze squarely. There was something going on, and she suspected she was involved, whether she wanted to be or not. She intended to discover what the hell it was.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour promise.\u201d</p><p>She brushed her fingers over her chest. \u201cCross my heart and hope to die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe careful of your words.\u201d His low voice was thick with warning. \u201cDeath can lurk in the most unexpected places.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes narrowed. \u201cThat sounded very much like a threat, Caine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore of a friendly warning, pet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t call me that.\u201d</p><p>He patted her cheek, his smile insulting as he turned to make his way down the hall.</p><p>\u201cBehave yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCreep,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>Waiting until she heard Caine climbing the staircase to his study on the second floor, Harley turned to shove open the door behind her.</p><p>She didn\u2019t give a damn about her promise.</p><p>If Salvatore had answers, she wanted them.</p><p>Salvatore was seated on the cement floor in the middle of the cell, as far from the silver bars as possible.</p><p>Not that it truly mattered.</p><p>The silver was a bother, but the true danger was the debilitating weakness caused by Harley.</p><p>Cristo. He understood the scientific logistics of a Were mating. Although the attraction was mutual, it was always the female who had the final choice of whether or not to accept the bond. The male\u2019s power was restrained to prevent him from taking the female by force. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Of course, when the powers returned after the mating was complete, it was rumored they were even more potent. He became the perfect weapon to protect his family.</p><p>It all made perfect sense.</p><p>And it was a royal pain in the ass.</p> <p>Why him? And why Harley? And why now?</p><p>The matings had faded away, along with the Weres\u2019 ability to control their shifts during the full moon. No doubt a biological necessity for females to mate with as many men as possible, in the hopes of obtaining a viable pregnancy.</p><p>Salvatore groaned as the scent of vanilla flooded the air, warning of Harley\u2019s imminent return.</p><p>His brain might not comprehend the inconvenient mating, but his body was fully on board with the program.</p><p>Just having her in the same room was enough to make him hard and aching.</p> <p>Rising to his feet, he watched as Harley slipped into the room and closed the door, leaning against it with a resentful expression.</p><p>A slow smile curved Salvatore\u2019s lips. Harley might consider him the enemy, but she was as helpless as he was to deny the smoldering attraction that crackled between them.</p><p>Her awareness filled the air like the finest perfume.</p><p>\u201cI knew you\u2019d be back,\u201d he drawled.</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d She rolled her eyes. \u201cBecause you\u2019re so frigging irresistible?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am to you.\u201d His smile widened as her fists clenched and she looked like she was considering punching him in the nose. Dangerous women turned him on. \u201cBesides, you have questions that only I can answer.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDid you ever consider the possibility I came back to kill you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo arrogant.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t want me if I were a doormat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you, period.\u201d</p><p>Salvatore arched a brow at her blatant lie. \u201cYou\u2019ve never been around another pureblood, have you?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes narrowed. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause if you had, you would know I can smell your physical response.\u201d He breathed in deeply, his body tingling in response. \u201cIt fills the air.\u201d</p> <p>An astonishing blush touched her cheeks before she was roughly pushing away from the door and pacing toward the cage.</p><p>\u201cWhy doesn\u2019t Caine just kill you?\u201d</p><p>He paused, struck by her pertinent question. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought the King of Weres knew everything?\u201d</p><p>He cast a disgusted glance toward the locked door of his cage.</p><p>\u201cObviously not.\u201d</p><p>She unconsciously rubbed her arms, as if trying to rid herself of the tangible electricity that pulsed between. His lips twisted.</p><p>Ah, if only it were that simple.</p><p>\u201cYou said that my sisters and I were stolen from a nursery?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cSi.\u201d Salvatore grimaced. Far too late he realized he\u2019d been played the fool. \u201cAt first I assumed it was traditional baby snatchers who were out to make a quick buck on the black market. Now I suspect it\u2019s a calculated plot intended to destroy the Weres.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you think Caine\u2019s involved?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWithout a doubt.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, as if not particularly surprised by Caine\u2019s treachery.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened in Hannibal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShort or long version?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShort.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter years of searching, I tracked your sister Regan to a psychotic imp named Culligan who\u2019d been torturing her for the past thirty years.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cNot surprisingly, she went a bit homicidal when I released her, and she tracked Culligan to Hannibal where Caine\u2019s minions first tried to capture her, and then tried to kill her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich minions?\u201d</p><p>She was testing him. Whether it was to discover if Caine was lying or he was, it was impossible to say.</p><p>\u201cSadie was the leader. Regan killed her. Then there was Duncan, who intended to lead me to this lair.\u201d His jaw tightened. \u201cUnfortunately, Caine and his pet jinn got there first.\u201d</p><p>Her lips parted, no doubt with yet another question, then there was the sound of a click and abruptly she was spinning on her heel and rushing back to the door.</p><p>She grasped the door handle and futilely attempted to pull it open.</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>Salvatore was on instant alert. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Before his companion could answer, the sound of Caine\u2019s voice echoed through a speaker set in the corner of the ceiling.</p><p>\u201cI did warn you, sweet Harley,\u201d the cur mocked. \u201cI wanted to keep you out of this, but you wouldn\u2019t listen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo...\u201d She pounded her fists against the steel door. \u201cCaine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarley, what the hell is going on?\u201d Salvatore demanded.</p><p>\u201cDamn you.\u201d She pointed a finger toward Salvatore. \u201cThis is all your fault.\u201d</p><p>Salvatore snorted. His fault? He was locked in a damned silver cage in the middle of nowhere, and it was his fault?</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until he caught the first whiff of gas that he at last understood Harley\u2019s outrage.</p><p>Something was being pumped into the basement.</p><p>Something powerful enough to make his knees buckle and the world go black.</p><p>Although the large wooden cabin was less than fifty miles north of St. Louis, it would have taken more than a GPS to find the house.</p><p>Not only was there acres of thick trees and a high fence that protected the estate, there was also a spell of Concealment that had been woven by the local coven of witches. If that wasn\u2019t enough, there were large lethal wolves that prowled the outer perimeter and ate anyone who accidentally stumbled too close.</p><p>Caine had deliberately chosen this cabin to hide his unconscious prisoners. Beyond being close enough to his previous lair not to have to worry about Salvatore waking up prematurely, it was his most heavily guarded compound.</p><p>He could no longer trust Harley, or what she had told him.</p><p>If someone had been with Salvatore, then he wanted to make damned certain they couldn\u2019t follow.</p><p>No one, absolutely no one, could sneak up on him here.</p><p>Of course, he would feel a great deal happier if he weren\u2019t currently standing in the cramped tunnels that ran beneath the estate. He was tired, stressed on an epic scale, and in no humor to meet with the ancient Were who stood in the depths of the shadows, his eyes glowing an eerie crimson and his body wrapped in a heavy cape.</p><p>Christ, the man was nasty. Caine shivered, for the first time realizing that rather than the usual heat that radiated from Weres, the air was filled with an unpleasant chill.</p><p>Like his companion was a damned corpse.</p><p>Or a bloodsucker.</p><p>Clearing the fear from his throat, Caine tilted his chin. The Were had demanded this meeting the moment Caine had revealed that he had captured Salvatore. He had no idea how the Were had arrived so swiftly, and in truth, he didn\u2019t want to know. But since his arrival, the arrogant dog had done nothing but complain and criticize.</p><p>Typical.</p><p>The bastard was never satisfied with Caine\u2019s efforts.</p><p>Which was precisely why Caine tried to limit the number of reunions to one or two a decade.</p><p>\u201cI told you I would take care of Salvatore and I did,\u201d he said, tired of being a whipping boy for the Weres.</p><p>\u201cYou also promised you would make sure that he didn\u2019t find the female Weres until I was prepared to act,\u201d his companion taunted, his voice oddly hoarse, as always.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t my fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt never is.\u201d</p><p>Caine\u2019s skin prickled as he battled against his snarling wolf. When he was tense, it was always more difficult to control his shifts.</p><p>\u201cIf you think you can do better, then you take him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not time yet, you fool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTime for what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDestiny to be fulfilled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, screw it. I\u2019ve waited thirty years for this supposed destiny to happen,\u201d Caine snapped. \u201cI\u2019m getting tired of empty promises.\u201d</p><p>The Were released a warning growl. \u201cAre you questioning my authority?\u201d</p><p>Caine bit back his angry words, realizing he had gone too far. Swallowing his pride, he knelt in a gesture of submission.</p><p>For now, he needed the disturbing Were.</p><p>But someday...</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemember this, cur, if something happens to Salvatore before my plans are complete, I\u2019ll skin you alive and feed you to the vultures.\u201d</p><p>There was a blast of cold air and a hair-raising scent of evil, then the Were seemed to simply melt into shadows.</p><p>Caine counted to one hundred, then added another fifty just in case.</p><p>Once he was certain he was alone, he turned his head to spit in the dirt.</p><p>\u201cSomeday, I\u2019m going to kill that bastard.\u201d</p><p>Harley woke to a pounding head, a dry mouth, and her body wrapped firmly in the arms of a warm, delicious Were.</p><p>For a demented moment, she snuggled closer, lured by the heat and rich male musk that would entice any poor woman into helpless stupidity.</p><p>It was only when Salvatore\u2019s hands slid down to cup her ass and he pressed her against his hardening erection that she painfully came to her senses.</p><p>Was she completely mental?</p><p>With a shove that sent Salvatore flying onto his back, she scrambled to her feet and glared down at his smug smile. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDo you always grope unconscious women?\u201d</p><p>He folded his hands over his stomach and crossed his legs at the ankle. He should have looked ridiculous lying on the cement floor, with his raven hair tousled and his expensive suit wrinkled. But he didn\u2019t.</p><p>He looked...edible.</p> <p>The bronzed, stunningly beautiful features. The full, sensual lips. The whiskey-gold eyes.</p><p>A delectable male, from the top of his raven hair to the tips of his Italian leather shoes.</p><p>\u201cOnly those who crawl all over me in their sleep,\u201d he said. \u201cIf anyone was violated, it was me.\u201d</p><p>The worst part was that Harley couldn\u2019t be certain she hadn\u2019t been violating him.

His power swirled through the small space with crushing force.</p><p>\u201cDo you know where we are?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>She turned and glanced around the six-by-six cage made of silver bars that was set in the middle of a barren cellar. There was nothing to identify the cramped prison beyond a narrow door and bare lightbulb in the center of the ceiling. There were no windows, no furniture, not even a blanket, but the muted scent of wooden logs gave away their location.</p> <p>\u201cIn Caine\u2019s cabin near St. Louis.\u201d</p><p>Salvatore closed his eyes, testing the air. \u201cIt\u2019s dusk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have a point?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLevet becomes a statue during the day.\u201d His eyes opened, a hint of frustration shimmering in the golden depths. \u201cHe should be waking any moment to follow our trail.\u201d</p><p>Harley shook her head, Salvatore\u2019s frustration echoing deep inside her.

Why? Are you interested in joining the bimbo brigade?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy only interest is in knowing whether or not you share his bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s none of your damned business.\u201d</p><p>His lips twisted, an odd yearning flaring through his eyes. \u201cAh, if only that were true.\u201d</p><p>A melting heat threatened to weaken her knees and Harley gave a sharp shake of her head.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t going to be distracted.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what your damage is, but in case you\u2019ve failed to notice, we\u2019re in a little bit of trouble here. Can you focus on something other than trying to get into my pants?\u201d</p><p>His lips curled. \u201cI can multitask.\u201d</p><p>No crap.</p><p>\u201cFan-frigging-tastic,\u201d she groused. \u201cThen get us out of here.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Four</p><p>Salvatore glanced toward the locked door of the cell, folding his arms across his chest.</p><p>\u201cAnd just how do you expect me to perform that particular miracle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you were some sort of uberking,\u201d she taunted. \u201cDon\u2019t you have any special powers?\u201d</p><p>Salvatore smiled, unruffled by her sharp tone. She could snap and snarl all she wanted, but she couldn\u2019t conceal the scent of her arousal.</p><p>And when he\u2019d awakened to discover her snuggled in his arms...</p><p>Dio, it had almost made this whole kidnapping thing worthwhile.</p><p>Almost.</p><p>\u201cNone that involve B and E,\u201d he admitted.</p><p>Her gaze narrowed. \u201cB and E implies entering. We want to exit.\u201d</p><p>He folded his arms over his chest. \u201cWhat about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou obviously know Caine...\u201d His jaw tightened as a flare of savage possession speared through him. \u201cIntimately. You better than anyone should be familiar with the weaknesses in his security.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know nothing about Caine.\u201d Her lips curled in a sneer, but Salvatore didn\u2019t miss the bitterness that edged her voice. \u201cHe\u2019s done nothing but lie to me since I was a baby.\u201d</p><p>He was petty enough to be pleased at the thought of poisoning any relationship between Harley and the damnable cur, but within that perfectly logical reaction was an unexpected stab of regret. The woman was clearly distressed by the realization that her life had been a lie.</p><p>Risking life and limb, Salvatore grasped her hand, half-expecting to be tossed across the cell. She stiffened, but she surprisingly didn\u2019t go homicidal on him. A step in the right direction, he told himself, savoring the feel of her warm skin that eased the sense of weakness that plagued him.</p><p>Cristo, he needed to mate her.</p><p>The sooner the better.</p><p>\u201cHe told you that I murdered your sisters?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cAnd that I was next on your list to die.\u201d Her expression assured him that she was grimly clinging to her suspicion he intended to harm her. \u201cHe swore he was the only one who could protect me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA clever means to keep you in his power.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBastard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he ever reveal why he was so anxious to keep you so close?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s been using my blood in his experiments to change curs into full Weres.\u201d</p><p>Salvatore shook his head in disgust. The conceited fool. The Weres\u2019 power was a mystical force, not a scientific one. A clever man might be capable of making small alterations, as he had done, but what made purebloods immortal was pure magic.</p><p>\u201cHe can\u2019t seriously believe in such nonsense?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, he believes.\u201d Her fingers unconsciously tightened around his. \u201cAllegedly some ancient werewolf came to him and revealed a vision that his blood would run pure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAncient werewolf?\u201d Salvatore frowned. A Were had given Caine the crackpot vision? It made no sense. \u201cAre you certain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what he said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlood runs pure. What the hell does that mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, it was his vision, not mine.\u201d</p><p>Salvatore muttered a curse. He felt like he was trying to put together a puzzle with half the pieces missing.</p><p>He hated puzzles.</p><p>\u201cDid he ever say how he managed to get his hands on you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Her eyes narrowed in suspicion. \u201cI suppose if you\u2019re telling the truth, and I\u2019m not entirely on board with that theory, then he must have stolen my sisters and I from your nursery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was humans that broke into the nursery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCaine could have hired them.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cHe\u2019s never been anxious to put his own neck on the line. Not if he can convince some other schmuck to do the dirty work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t sound very convinced.\u201d</p><p>Because he wasn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something I\u2019m missing,\u201d he muttered, his gaze lowering to her slender fingers clasped in his hand. Absently he brushed his thumb over her knuckles, relishing her silken skin.</p><p>He\u2019d give his favorite Porsche to discover if she was so soft and smooth all over.</p><p>Easily picking up the heat stirring in the air, Harley yanked her hand free and glared at him with an impatience that didn\u2019t entirely mask her flare of awareness.</p><p>\u201cYeah, you\u2019re missing a way out of here. Can you please concentrate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you always so bossy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you expect me to kneel and kiss your feet?\u201d</p><p>He chuckled softly, stepping close enough to wrap his arms around her waist and brush his lips lightly over her mouth.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome to kneel, but I have something better for you to kiss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop that,\u201d she muttered, shivering as his lips skated over her jaw and down the curve of her neck. Her fingers grabbed the lapels of his jacket. \u201cDammit, Salvatore, we\u2019re being watched.\u201d</p><p>Lifting his head, Salvatore glanced toward the tiny hole drilled above the door. He sent out a flare of power, smiling as he heard the small pop, and a whiff of smoke floated through the air.</p><p>\u201cNot anymore.\u201d Mission accomplished, he returned his attention to more important matters. Nibbling the tender skin at the base of her throat, he shuddered at the need that blazed through him. \u201cThat scent is driving me mad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you...\u201d Whatever she had to say was forgotten as Salvatore bit the tender spot where her neck and shoulder met, allowing his fangs to grow long enough so she could feel his mark. She shuddered, her vanilla scent flooding the room. \u201cGod.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou even taste good,\u201d Salvatore muttered.</p><p>Her fingers clutched his jacket, and her head tilted back to allow him full access to her satin skin. Salvatore didn\u2019t hesitate.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t become king by being slow to grasp opportunity.</p> <p>Tightening his grip until she was pressed against his thickening arousal, Salvatore nuzzled a path down the line of sports bra, slowing his pace as he reached the soft swell of her breasts.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you do to the camera?\u201d she husked, as if attempting to devise some means of distracting him.</p><p>Good luck with that.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t that he lied when he said he could multitask. The responsibilities that lay heavy on his shoulders meant he could never put aside his duties. Not even when he was enjoying a bit of extracurricular activity.</p><p>In this moment, however, the world and his duties could go to hell in a handbasket.</p> <p>No doubt because this wasn\u2019t extracurricular.</p><p>This was the main event.</p><p>The life-altering woman he hadn\u2019t even known was waiting out there for him.</p><p>\u201cI can disrupt small electrical devises,\u201d he said, his lips moving over her silken skin.</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d Her tone was disgruntled, but her fingers had moved to shove into his hair, her heart thumping so loudly he could have heard it even without his inhuman abilities. \u201cYou can zap a toaster, but you can\u2019t get us out of this cell. A fat lot of help you are.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled, his fingers skimming up her back. \u201cI have other skills.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUnless it\u2019s picking a lock, I don\u2019t want to know about them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you do.\u201d</p><p>She made an explosive sound of pleasure as he licked the tip of her nipple through the stretchy material.</p><p>\u201cDammit, Caine\u2019s going to come down here as soon as he realizes the camera isn\u2019t working.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He nipped the tight bud, growling in pleasure as she quivered in eager response. \u201cI\u2019ve wanted to have a little chat with him for a very long time.\u201d</p><p>Without warning she shoved him away, her face flushed as she wrapped her arms protectively around her waist.</p><p>\u201cI doubt he\u2019ll be in a chatty mood,\u201d she rasped.</p><p>Salvatore\u2019s lips twisted. Under normal circumstances, no Were would have been capable of escaping his grasp. Being king did have its benefits. This whole premating thing sucked.</p> <p>Well, the loss of his power sucked.</p><p>The rest...</p><p>It was definitely growing on him.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d He sucked in a deep breath, attempting to halt any more growing. Time for his own attempt at distraction. \u201cWhat of the jinn?\u201d</p><p>Genuine surprise flashed through her eyes. \u201cHow did you...\u201d She shook her head. \u201cNo, never mind. What about her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s her connection to Caine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not really sure.\u201d The hazel gaze briefly shifted toward the door before returning to Salvatore. A sure indication that Caine had kept his illegal demon under tight wraps. \u201cHe claims that he rescued her from a mage who\u2019d held her captive for centuries. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s true or not since she always stayed in one of the out-buildings. I only saw her on occasion, and she usually was at a distance.\u201d</p><p>Salvatore absently nodded. \u201cHe must have some means of keeping her hidden or the Oracles would already have hunted her down.\u201d</p><p>Harley\u2019s brows snapped together. \u201cWhat\u2019s your interest in her?\u201d</p><p>A slow, wicked smile curved his lips. \u201cJealous, Harley?\u201d</p><p>She turned her head, refusing to meet his teasing gaze. \u201cFor God\u2019s sake, get over yourself.\u201d</p><p>His smile remained. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. My interest is pure self-preservation. Curs I can handle. I\u2019d rather not provoke a jinn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re so dangerous?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeadly.\u201d</p><p>She turned back, her expression worried. \u201cCaine said she disappeared in the tunnels. The last I knew, she hadn\u2019t returned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I suppose we\u2019ll have to hope for the best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, \u2019cause that\u2019s really worked well so far,\u201d she taunted.</p><p>\u201cYou know, cara, when we get out of here, we\u2019re going to have to work on that attitude of yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf we get out of here, you\u2019re not going to have to worry about my attitude. I\u2019ll be long gone.\u201d</p><p>His gaze slid down her slender body. \u201cYou can run, but you\u2019ll never be able to hide from me.\u201d He lifted his head to meet the stunning hazel gaze. \u201cNot ever.\u201d</p><p>Her jaw tightened. \u201cI\u2019ve done a pretty good job until now.\u201d</p><p>Salvatore stiffened. The silver that surrounded him had nearly disguised the prickles of warning that crawled over his skin.</p><p>Without thought, he swept Harley behind him and turned toward the door.</p><p>\u201cStay behind me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSexist pig.\u201d She punched him square in the back, nearly sending him to his knees. Cristo. \u201cI don\u2019t need a man to protect me.\u201d</p><p>He spun on his heel to meet her belligerent scowl. \u201cThis has nothing to do with protecting. I don\u2019t want you accidentally stepping between me and Caine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? What are you going to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUberking stuff.\u201d Unable to help himself, he caught her face in his hands and roughly kissed her. \u201cDon\u2019t move.\u201d</p><p>He turned back, sighing as he sensed Harley shift so she could see the door. She might be willing to concede his first shot at Caine, but there was no way in hell she was going to hide behind him.</p><p>Harley wasn\u2019t the cowering sort.</p><p>A beat passed before the door was shoved open and Caine entered the room. Salvatore\u2019s wolf stirred, instinctively reacting to having a male so close to his mate.</p><p>It was his purely human side, however, that was provoked by the man\u2019s smooth blond beauty and smug expression.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t sure what he\u2019d expected when he finally encountered the cur who had been a pain in his royal butt, but it wasn\u2019t this slender man dressed in faded jeans and a black muscle shirt, who looked like he should be on the beaches of California instead of leading a cur revolt.</p><p>He wanted to smash that too-handsome face.</p><p>Or maybe he would just rip off his head and be done with it.</p><p>The head ripping off became much more likely as the bastard studied Harley as if she were his favorite bone.</p><p>\u201cHarley, my love, you\u2019ve been a very bad girl,\u201d Caine taunted.</p><p>\u201cScrew you,\u201d Harley muttered.</p><p>The blue eyes glowed with a hunger that set Salvatore\u2019s nerves on edge.</p><p>\u201cLater, pet,\u201d the cur drawled. \u201cAnd only if you behave.\u201d</p><p>Salvatore stepped close enough to the bars to feel the burn of silver.</p><p>\u201cCareful, cur,\u201d he warned, his voice thick with warning.</p><p>Stupidly confident that Salvatore was contained in his cell, Caine folded his arms over his chest.</p><p>\u201cWell, well,\u201d he sneered. \u201cIf it isn\u2019t the glorious King of Weres.\u201d</p><p>Salvatore glanced toward Harley. \u201cI like glorious better than uber.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes. \u201cI\u2019ll make a note of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, you\u2019re not so glorious right now,\u201d Caine snapped, obviously not pleased at having his moment of gloating interrupted. \u201cI\u2019ve seen better looking Ipar demons.\u201d</p><p>With insulting slowness, Salvatore returned his attention to the cur.</p><p>\u201cEasy to be brave when you have me locked in a cage. It would be a lot more impressive if you let me out and faced me like a man.\u201d</p><p>Caine laughed. \u201cDo I look like a putz?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou look like a cur with a death wish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust the opposite. I intend to become immortal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHard to become immortal after I\u2019ve chopped your head off and fed it to the rats.\u201d Salvatore paused, narrowing his gaze. \u201cStill, just out of morbid curiosity, how do you intend to acquire this immortality?\u201d</p><p>Caine shrugged. \u201cYou aren\u2019t the only one with skill in the laboratory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSkill and blind hope are two different things. There\u2019s nothing in a test tube that can change you into a Were.\u201d</p><p>Caine tilted his chin, the glow of a true zealot shimmering in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cObviously, there is. I saw it in a vision.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid this vision happen to occur while you were indulging in some pharmaceutical pleasures?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t a joke,\u201d Caine growled.</p><p>\u201cGood. I\u2019m not laughing. Where did this vision come from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone of your damned business, Giuliani.\u201d</p><p>Enough. Salvatore wasn\u2019t a patient werewolf under the best of circumstances, and at the moment he was sore, filthy, and trapped in a silver cage. His patience was nonexistent.</p><p>Without warning his power lashed out, ramming Caine into the wall and holding him there with an invisible but very tangible force.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Your Majesty, cur,\u201d he corrected, his voice edged with ice.</p><p>Caine struggled, but even with Salvatore weakened, the cur was no match for him.</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d</p><p>Salvatore smiled with cruel satisfaction. \u201cHow did you get the vision?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt was a Were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to have to be more specific.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Caine struggled to breathe, his perfect features twisted in a grimace of pain. \u201cDammit, he didn\u2019t give me a name.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDescribe him.\u201d</p><p>The cur tilted back his head, the veins of his neck popping out as Salvatore\u2019s power squeezed his body with brutal force.</p><p>\u201cShort,\u201d he gritted. \u201cBrown hair, English accent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re keeping something from me.\u201d Salvatore cursed the silver bars that prevented him from getting his hands on the cur. The long-distance torture was taking its toll. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>Caine\u2019s eyes flashed as he struggled to shift. An impossible task so long as Salvatore held him in his control.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m going to kill you,\u201d the cur hissed.</p><p>Salvatore tightened his grip. \u201cWrong answer.\u201d</p><p>The cur\u2019s labored breathing echoed through the room as he glared at Salvatore with sheer hatred.</p><p>Far preferable to the smug grin.</p><p>\u201cHis eyes were red even when he was in human form,\u201d he at last ground out.</p><p>Pure shock gripped Salvatore. Merda.</p> <p>It couldn\u2019t be.</p><p>He had killed the bastard nearly a century ago.</p><p>Still, the description was unmistakable.</p><p>\u201cBriggs,\u201d he breathed.</p><p>Harley moved to his side. \u201cDo you know him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cObviously not as well as I thought I did.\u201d</p><p>Across the room, Caine snarled in pain. \u201cRelease me.\u201d</p><p>Salvatore gritted his teeth, cursing his weakened state. His hold on the cur was hanging by a thread.</p> <p>With the last of his strength, he focused on Caine.</p><p>\u201cNot until you\u2019ve offered me a quid pro quo. Get the keys and unlock this cell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRot in hell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t make me ask you again,\u201d Salvatore gritted, but the power behind his words faltered, and with a low growl Caine lurched forward, breaking the invisible bonds that held him.</p><p>\u201cBastard,\u201d the cur breathed, reaching behind his back to pull out a handgun he had tucked in the waistband of his jeans.</p><p>Salvatore didn\u2019t even try to regain command of the infuriated Caine. Instead, he instinctively turned to wrap Harley in his arms, driving her to the ground and covering her with his body.</p><p>Chapter Five</p><p>It happened so fast, it was little more than a blur to Harley.</p><p>One minute she was standing beside Salvatore, and the next she was flat on her back with the damned Were perched on top of her.</p><p>She flinched as the sound of a gun firing echoed painfully through the small room, the bullets flying harmlessly overhead, striking the cement wall and filling the air with the bitter scent of gunpowder.</p><p>The shooting came to a halt and Harley heard the slam of the door as Caine beat a hasty retreat.</p><p>They lay motionless; the rapid beat of their hearts the only sound to break the heavy silence.</p><p>Slowly the stench of gunpowder was replaced by Salvatore\u2019s rich musk that seemed to seep into Harley\u2019s skin, branding her with an awareness that was as unwelcomed as the realization of just how perfect his heavy body felt pressed so intimately against hers.</p><p>Damned Were.</p><p>He had to be doing some sort of mystical werewolf shit on her.</p><p>She refused to believe that his savage magnetism could be anything but a trick.</p><p>As if deliberately mocking her desperate theory, Salvatore shifted to settle his hips between her spread legs, his head lowering until his face was pressed against the curve of her neck and the raven hair fell about her like a curtain of warm satin.</p><p>A treacherous heat swirled through the pit of her stomach and Harley planted her hands against his chest.</p><p>A distraction.</p><p>That\u2019s what she needed.</p><p>And pronto.</p><p>\u201cWell, that worked out well,\u201d she muttered, her heart slamming against her chest when his lips lightly touched the base of her throat.</p><p>\u201cCould be worse,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cGet off me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d His lips continued to nibble, sending jolts of electric pleasure through her. \u201cWe\u2019re obviously stuck in here for the time being. We might as well make the best of a bad situation.\u201d</p><p>Oh...God. She squeezed her eyes shut, battling the fierce tug of attraction that flared between them.</p><p>Distraction, distraction, distraction...</p><p>\u201cDid you turn Caine into a cur?\u201d she husked.</p><p>He stilled, as if caught off guard by her question. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen how did you control him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the king. All curs belong to me.\u201d</p><p>Harley snorted. Pure arrogance, in all its glory.</p><p>\u201cAnd the Weres?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d He nipped the lobe of her ear. \u201cYou\u2019re mine, cara. From the top of your golden head to the tips of your tiny toes, and every delectable curve in between.\u201d</p><p>Harley felt a flutter of unease as she recalled how Salvatore had held Caine captive.</p><p>\u201cNo frigging way,\u201d she rasped.</p><p>He laughed softly, his breath brushing against her skin, making it prickle with excitement.</p><p>\u201cIn every way.\u201d He pulled back to regard her with an unnerving intensity. \u201cAnd just a word of warning, Harley, I don\u2019t share.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth went dry even as she was shaking her head in denial.</p><p>\u201cGod, I thought Caine was off his nut.\u201d</p><p>The golden gaze skimmed down to her mouth. \u201cI make no guarantee of my sanity, but I do promise that my claim to you is very real.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSalvatore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like the sound of my name on your lips,\u201d he muttered, abruptly lowering his head as if unable to resist temptation. \u201cAnd the taste,\u201d he whispered against her mouth. \u201cI especially like the taste.\u201d</p><p>It was the biting need clutching her body that at last pushed her unease to sheer panic.</p><p>Without giving herself time to think, she shoved her hands against his chest, sending him flying off her and onto his back on the cement floor.</p><p>\u201cWhat part of \u2018get off me\u2019 did you not understand?\u201d she rasped, scrambling to her feet to glare down at his amused expression. \u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d</p><p>With a liquid grace he was on his feet, his raven hair tumbling about his lean face and the golden eyes glowing with anticipation.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a predator.\u201d</p><p>Like that was some sort of secret?</p><p>The man reeked of danger.</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd there\u2019s nothing I enjoy more than the chase.\u201d He smiled, his teeth startling white against his bronzed skin. \u201cWell...almost nothing. I have a feeling that on this occasion, the capture is going to be even more satisfying.\u201d</p><p>Prey? Her eyes narrowed. \u201cYou\u2019re an idiot if you think I\u2019m some sort of helpless female that\u2019s yours for the taking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t want you if you were helpless. At least not unless you were in the mood to be at my mercy.\u201d He reached to stroke a brazen finger down the low scoop of her sports bra. \u201cYou might enjoy a night in my handcuffs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d She slapped his finger away. \u201cAbout as much as I would enjoy having my eyes gouged out.\u201d</p><p>His smile widened. \u201cI\u2019m going to enjoy teaching you just how many pleasures are waiting for us.\u201d</p><p>With short, jerky steps, she moved to glare at the door across the room.</p><p>\u201cFor God\u2019s sake, now is not the time or place for this.\u201d</p><p>He moved to stand directly behind her, the heat of his body searing her back.</p><p>\u201cThen when is the time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow does never sound to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnbearable,\u201d he breathed into her ear.</p><p>Harley wrapped her arms around her waist. It was either that, or wrapping them around the edible Were. Damn him to hell.</p><p>\u201cCan you control Caine even at a distance?\u201d she demanded roughly.</p><p>There was a taut silence, then with a faint sigh Salvatore moved to stand at her side, his profile hard.</p><p>\u201cNot with you...\u201d He sharply cut off his words, sliding a covert glance in her direction. \u201cNot at the moment. The silver disrupts my powers.\u201d</p><p>She frowned, wondering what he was hiding from her.</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t be stupid enough to get that close again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll be back.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes. \u201cSo now you\u2019re clairvoyant?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need for clairvoyance. Caine\u2019s kept me alive for a reason. Eventually that reason will force him to return.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t help if he\u2019s not already in your power. He\u2019ll just tranq you or fill the basement with gas like he did before.\u201d</p><p>He grasped her shoulders, turning her to meet the power of his golden gaze.</p><p>\u201cHarley, one way or another, I promise you that we\u2019re going to get out of here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re never wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cArrogant.\u201d</p><p>He flashed that devastatingly sexy smile. \u201cConfident.\u201d</p><p>The fact that she couldn\u2019t simply laugh at his egotistical boasts pissed her off. The conceited beast would get them out just to prove her wrong. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She pulled from his grip and eyed him with suspicion.</p><p>\u201cYou know the Were who\u2019s helping Caine?\u201d</p><p>His smile faded, his expression suddenly grim and forbidding.</p> <p>\u201cSi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m assuming from your tone that the two of you aren\u2019t BFFs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was my greatest competition toward claiming the throne.\u201d</p><p>Harley lifted her brows. \u201cIs there really a throne?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d He seemed startled she would even ask. \u201cIt\u2019s a massive wooden chair with a lot of gilt and velvet cushions. It\u2019s also bespelled so that only the true king can sit on it. It helps clear up any doubt as to the next heir.\u201d</p> <p>She grimaced. No doubt there was also a big, gaudy crown with a lot of flashy jewels.</p><p>\u201cAnd your contender\u2019s ass wasn\u2019t royal enough to fit?\u201d</p><p>A feral smile curled his lips. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t in the mood to try after I ripped out his throat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice.\u201d Harley tossed her head, hoping he didn\u2019t notice her tiny shiver of alarm. Salvatore Giuliani would make a very bad enemy. Something to remember. \u201cIt\u2019s no wonder he\u2019s chummy with Caine. They both hate your guts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, it\u2019s more than a wonder. It\u2019s nothing less than a miracle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecause, after I ripped out Briggs\u2019s throat, I cut off his head, carved out his heart, and burned his carcass.\u201d The golden eyes flashed. \u201cHe should be dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she breathed unsteadily. \u201cYou\u2019d think.\u201d</p><p>Salvatore watched Harley grimace, belatedly realizing that it might not be the best strategy to reveal just how brutal he could be when the occasion demanded. Not if he was to convince her that her only hope of safety was in his hands.</p><p>Then he shrugged. Unless Caine developed the ability to think with his brain instead of his ego, Salvatore was going to have to kill him. And anyone else who threatened Harley.</p><p>Perhaps it was best she knew the truth from the start.</p><p>As if coming to the same conclusion, Harley breathed in a deep breath and met his gaze squarely.</p><p>Brave and tough.</p><p>Just his kind of woman.</p> <p>\u201cHave you considered the possibility that maybe the Were who\u2019s tag teaming with Caine isn\u2019t Briggs?\u201d</p><p>Ah, if only it were that simple.</p><p>\u201cNo, the description fits too perfectly.\u201d Salvatore shook his head in disgust. \u201cCristo. I should have known his death could not be so simple.\u201d</p><p>Her sharp bark of laughter echoed through the cell. \u201cYou did everything but eat his carcass for dinner. That isn\u2019t simple by anyone\u2019s standard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot for most Weres, but I already suspected that he was dabbling in magic.\u201d</p><p>She took a sharp step backwards, her expression oddly wary. \u201cWeres can do magic?\u201d</p><p>His smiled with rueful amusement. If he could do magic, he wouldn\u2019t be stuck in this damned cell.</p><p>\u201cThey aren\u2019t born with the ability to perform magic like a witch, but any creature\u2014\u201d He broke off as he realized he wasn\u2019t being entirely honest. \u201cWell, any creature besides a vampire can be imbued with magic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cImbued? I don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are ancient demons who can share their powers with others.\u201d</p><p>She considered a moment, her expression dubious. \u201cI haven\u2019t met many ancient demons, but they\u2019ve never struck me as the sort to share anything, let alone their power.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery perceptive, cara,\u201d he said. \u201cOnly the very stupid or the very desperate would agree to become a vessel for borrowed magic. The cost is far too high for whatever reward you hope to gain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the cost?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour life, if you\u2019re lucky.\u201d</p><p>She hesitated before asking the obvious question. \u201cAnd if you\u2019re not lucky?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour soul.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn.\u201d The hazel eyes were troubled as she glanced toward the door, perhaps realizing for the first time just how truly perilous their situation was. \u201cWhy would this Briggs be willing to give up his soul?\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t a tough question to answer. Like Caine, Briggs had always been an egotistical jackass who assumed he was a God-given gift to Weres.</p><p>The mere thought he wasn\u2019t going to be top dog (quite literally), was enough to send him over the edge.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s nearly a century older than myself, and until my birth he was considered the leading candidate to become the next King of Weres.\u201d</p><p>Harley caught on quickly. \u201cAnd you stole his thunder?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat can I say?\u201d He smiled with a faux modesty. \u201cIt was known since I was in the cradle that I was destined for greatness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re impossible,\u201d she muttered. \u201cWhat makes you suspect this Briggs is borrowing some demon\u2019s power?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBesides the fact he came back to life?\u201d</p><p>She waved aside his logic. \u201cYou said you already suspected he was dabbling in magic before his creepy resurrection. Why?\u201d</p><p>Damn, the woman didn\u2019t miss a thing.</p><p>\u201cOnce a Were reaches puberty and begins to shift, his power is more or less set. It\u2019s possible to learn fighting skills or to become more cunning, but the level of power doesn\u2019t change.\u201d</p><p>She considered for a moment, then she gave an abrupt nod. \u201cOkay, that makes sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter it became obvious that I would outrank Briggs, he disappeared from Rome for several years, and when he returned I began to sense he had gained strength that he shouldn\u2019t have possessed.\u201d Salvatore shuddered. \u201cAnd, of course, there were his eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis eyes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey stayed crimson even in his human form.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat he\u2019s more wolf than human. He maintains his intelligence and cunning, but any human morals and ethics have been replaced by sheer animal instinct.\u201d Salvatore\u2019s smile was sour. \u201cNot that he had many morals to begin with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he has black magic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSi.\u201d Salvatore\u2019s jaw tightened. \u201cHe will kill without mercy or remorse.\u201d</p><p>There was a sharp flare of alarm in her eyes. For all her bravery, Harley had the sense to be frightened when she should be.</p><p>Thank God. He had enough soldiers willing to throw their lives away.</p><p>\u201cDid you ever confront him about his power boost?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was not my place so long as the previous king still sat on the throne.\u201d</p><p>She snorted. \u201cI find it hard to believe there was ever a time you didn\u2019t assume you were the boss.\u201d</p><p>Salvatore ground his teeth, recalling those long, dark centuries as the previous king retreated from his duties, leaving his subjects in disarray and vulnerable to attack. It was then that the Weres had begun to falter, and even with all his power, Salvatore had yet to halt the slow decline.</p><p>A knowledge that gnawed at him with remorseless need to alter the grinding wheels of fate.</p><p>And one he rarely shared with anyone.</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI can be diplomatic when the occasion demands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d she drawled in blatant disbelief. \u201cSo what happened?\u201d</p><p>He sucked in a deep breath, crushing his ancient fury before it could cloud his concentration.</p><p>He would dwell on Briggs and his past mistakes later.</p><p>There were enough problems just a tad more urgent at the moment.</p><p>\u201cI tried to keep an eye on Briggs, but then the king died and before I could voice my suspicions, Briggs attacked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cObviously, you won.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did, but it was much more difficult than it should have been.\u201d His tone was flat, his words not revealing the grisly battle that had taken him nearly a month to recover from. \u201cOne mistake and I would have been the one in the grave.\u201d</p><p>Something flashed through the hazel eyes.</p><p>Horror? Dismay?</p><p>Disappointment that Briggs had screwed up the chance to chop off his head?</p><p>\u201cNow he\u2019s back,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cSo it would seem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd with a grudge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, with a plan,\u201d he softly corrected.</p><p>The grudge was a given. Briggs had wanted him dead since the day he was born. The very fact that he hadn\u2019t ambushed Salvatore before he realized the bastard was lurking around hinted that he had some plot beyond murder.</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of plan?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cThat, cara, I don\u2019t yet know.\u201d</p><p>She stabbed him with a frustrated glare. \u201cWell, thanks a butt-load for dragging me into the middle of your feud.\u201d</p><p>Salvatore moved to capture her face between his hands. There was no way he was going to be the villain of the piece.</p><p>\u201cAh, no, I won\u2019t take the entire blame. Caine was the one to drag you and your sisters away from the safety of my lair.\u201d</p><p>Her chin tilted to that stubborn angle he was beginning to recognize.</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah? If you hadn\u2019t been messing with our DNA, then he never would have taken us.\u201d</p><p>Salvatore studied her breathtaking beauty with a brooding gaze. \u201cI wonder.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure I want to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf Briggs is responsible for Caine\u2019s mystical visions, then he\u2019s no doubt the one who convinced the gullible cur to steal you from my nursery,\u201d he said slowly, speaking his vague suspicions out loud.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJust another question with no answer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d</p><p>Salvatore stilled as a familiar scent of granite whispered through the air.</p><p>\u201cDamn.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe cavalry,\u201d he muttered with a grimace. \u201cUnfortunately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy unfortunately?\u201d</p><p>Salvatore turned his head to watch the drain cover in the middle of the cement floor shoot upward, followed by a small gray form pushing out of the hole.</p><p>\u201cBecause the only thing worse than being stuck in this cell is being rescued by that.\u201d</p><p>Once clear of the drain, Levet gave himself a shake like a wet dog to regain his usual lumpy shape, a smirk curling his lips as he met Salvatore\u2019s resigned frown.</p><p>\u201cOh, Wilma, I\u2019m home.\u201d</p> <p>Chapter Six</p><p>Obviously less conflicted about their rescue, no doubt because she had yet to spend any quality time with the annoying pest, Harley hurried toward the edge of the cell, kneeling beside the silver bars.</p><p>\u201cLevet,\u201d she breathed, her voice softening in a way that made Salvatore grit his teeth. How the hell had he become the bad guy, while the stunted gargoyle was treated like a long lost friend? \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>Levet waddled forward, careful to keep a distance from the bars. Even gargoyles were allergic to silver.</p><p>\u201cMa belle, you did not believe I would abandon you to a pack of mangy dogs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you follow us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFah.\u201d He waved a clawed hand. \u201cAs if I could be outwitted by a mere witch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop preening and get us the hell out of here,\u201d Salvatore growled.</p> <p>\u201cI see that you are in your usual charming mood,\u201d Levet sniffed, carefully reaching through the bars to pat Harley\u2019s hand. \u201cI do not envy you, poor Harley, for being trapped with this foul beast.\u201d</p><p>She shot Salvatore a taunting glance. \u201cYou have no idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLevet, do you remember that conversation we had about your wings and whether or not they remain attached to your body?\u201d Salvatore said, his soft tone making the gargoyle take a hasty step backwards.</p><p>\u201cBully.\u201d His tail twitched. \u201cIf it were not for your lovely companion, I would leave you here to rot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust hurry, gargoyle.\u201d</p><p>Moving to the door of the cell, Levet studied the lock, his heavy brow lowering.</p><p>\u201cUh-oh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe lock has been spelled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought that no witch could outwit you?\u201d</p><p>Levet managed to look offended. \u201cI can blast through it, but you are always so testy when I blow things up.\u201d</p><p>Salvatore muttered a curse. \u201cPerfect.\u201d</p><p>Levet tilted back his head and tested the air. \u201cThere are six curs in the house and three more outside.\u201d He stabbed Salvatore with a questioning glance. \u201cCan you overpower them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome king you are...\u201d Levet bit off his words, his gaze sliding toward Harley as he belatedly recalled the reason for Salvatore\u2019s lack of power. \u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrecisely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Harley frowned. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>Salvatore ignored his companion as he concentrated on the small gargoyle.</p><p>\u201cCan you reach Styx?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNon, we are too far away. I attempted both Tane and Jagr, but I could not locate either of them. I could perhaps reach your curs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I won\u2019t have them rushing here on a suicide mission,\u201d Salvatore said without hesitation.</p><p>\u201cOh, but it is fine for me to risk my neck?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d</p><p>Levet sent him a raspberry, but before Salvatore could reach through the bars and rip out the gargoyle\u2019s tongue, Harley straightened and sent him an impatient glare.</p><p>\u201cCan we just concentrate on getting out of here?\u201d she snapped. \u201cCaine might be a lowly cur, but eventually he\u2019s going to smell a gargoyle in his basement.\u201d</p><p>Salvatore swallowed a sigh of resignation. If it was ever discovered he\u2019d been rescued by a pint-sized gargoyle, he\u2019d never live it down.</p><p>\u201cCan you blast a hole big enough for us to get through?\u201d he grudgingly demanded.</p><p>Levet glanced toward the thick ceiling. \u201cNot without the possibility of the house falling on our heads.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot up,\u201d Salvatore corrected. \u201cDown.\u201d</p><p>Levet paused, sniffing the air. \u201cA tunnel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore than one.\u201d Salvatore shifted his gaze to Harley. \u201cDo you know where they lead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cI was never allowed in them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have to risk it,\u201d he said, knowing even as the words left his mouth he was going to regret this. The gargoyle was a walking disaster. \u201cLevet?\u201d</p><p>The tiny demon lifted his hands. \u201cStand back.\u201d</p><p>Wrapping his arms around Harley, he hauled her to the back of the cell, doing his best to protect her from the silver bars, as well as the coming explosion.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she muttered. \u201cThe silver...\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust me, the silver is the least of our worries,\u201d he said, tucking her head in the hollow of his shoulder.</p><p>He had a clarifying instant to recognize just how perfectly she fit against him before the shocking concussion hit, the air filling with a deadly bombardment of silver shards as Levet burst open the cell. Hastily spinning, Salvatore used his back as a shield, grinding his teeth as tiny slivers of silver lodged in his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cHoly shit,\u201d Harley breathed.</p><p>\u201cHold on,\u201d Salvatore growled, already knowing what was coming next.</p><p>There was another explosion, this one sending powdered cement rather than the deadly silver pelting against him, thank God, and tightening his arms around Harley, he braced himself as the floor beneath them disappeared and they tumbled into the tunnel below.</p><p>The jarring impact of the landing wrenched Harley from his arms, and cursing the pain of the silver digging into his flesh, Salvatore crawled forward, using his hands to search for his mate through the thick cloud of dust.</p><p>\u201cHarley.\u201d His hands found her sprawled on the hard dirt. \u201cAre you hurt?\u201d</p><p>She coughed, sitting up to brush the dirt from her face.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d The dust began to clear and she glanced up at the gaping hole above. \u201cLevet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am here, ma belle.\u201d With a delicate flap of his wings, Levet stepped off the edge of the hole and floated down, landing beside Harley with a small bow. \u201cYour magnificent knight in shining armor in all his glory.\u201d</p><p>Salvatore rose to his feet, inwardly contemplating the pleasure of roasting the gargoyle over an open fire. The damned demon didn\u2019t have a speck of dust on him, while the rescue had left Salvatore covered in a new layer of filth, his back aching from the fall, and a half dozen silver splinters in his shoulder that were already aching.</p><p>\u201cYour glorified head is going to be displayed on Caine\u2019s trophy mantel if you don\u2019t get a move on it,\u201d he rasped.</p><p>Levet snorted, assisting Harley to her feet. \u201cAs if I fear a flea-bitten cur.\u201d</p><p>Striding forward, Salvatore knocked away Levet\u2019s hand and pulled Harley close. His logical mind understood he was being ridiculous. His instincts, however, couldn\u2019t bear for any man to be near this woman.</p><p>\u201cCaine\u2019s working with a powerful Were who has tapped into black magic,\u201d he snapped.</p><p>Levet\u2019s eyes widened in alarm. \u201cSacre bleu. What are you waiting for?\u201d</p><p>Salvatore shook his head as the demon scurried down the dark tunnel, his tail twitching in agitation. He turned to regard his companion with a somber expression. Who knew what was waiting for them?</p><p>\u201cStay close,\u201d he warned softly.</p><p>Her eyes flared in the darkness. \u201cAs if I have a choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never did,\u201d he said, leaning forward to steal a short, possessive kiss.</p><p>Then, grabbing Harley\u2019s hand, he tugged her to him as they strode after the retreating gargoyle.</p><p>Salvatore kept their pace slow but steady as they wound their way through the dark tunnel. He wasn\u2019t running headlong from one enemy, only to blunder blindly into the clutches of another.</p><p>Not that his reasonable caution was appreciated by his companions.</p><p>At his side, Levet muttered French curses and behind him, Harley kept herself occupied by comparing him to several body parts of animals, none of them complimentary.</p><p>What was the point in being king if he couldn\u2019t have a little respect?</p><p>Gritting his teeth, Salvatore attempted to ignore the silver that remained imbedded in his flesh, making it impossible for him to shift into wolf form. His wounds wouldn\u2019t heal so long as the silver remained.</p><p>And worse, it was another drain on his fading strength. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The very thing he didn\u2019t need.</p><p>He intended to make Caine and Briggs pay for every moment of this misery.</p><p>In blood.</p><p>Levet broke off his inventive curses, glancing over his shoulder. \u201cThe curs have entered the tunnel.\u201d</p> <p>Salvatore\u2019s pace never faltered. \u201cThey won\u2019t be the only ones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Harley demanded.</p><p>\u201cIf Caine has any sense at all, he\u2019ll have sent a few curs overhead to try and cut us off at the exit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you have effectively trapped us down here?\u201d she accused, her angry tone unable to hide the fear he could sense in the air.</p><p>\u201cOf course not,\u201d he smoothly lied, coming to a halt. The mark of any great leader was convincing others you knew what you were doing, even if you didn\u2019t have a clue. Besides, he didn\u2019t want to listen to any more bitching. \u201cLevet, can you cut off our pursuers?\u201d</p> <p>The gargoyle sniffed. \u201cMy talents are boundless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you do it without bringing the entire tunnel down on our heads?\u201d</p><p>He lifted his tiny hands toward the ceiling. \u201cWe shall see.\u201d</p><p>Not entirely reassured, Salvatore grabbed Harley\u2019s arm and pulled her farther down the tunnel.</p><p>\u201cYou might want to give him some room,\u201d he muttered. Then, as a pulsing shaft of light speared through the darkness, he abruptly turned his head. \u201cAnd hide your eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot again,\u201d she muttered, the words barely leaving her lips when the explosion sent them both tumbling backwards.</p> <p>Rolling on top of Harley, Salvatore protected her from the flying debris, relieved that they were the usual rocks and clumps of dirt to be found in a tunnel. He wasn\u2019t in the mood for any surprises.</p><p>\u201cTa-da,\u201d Levet chirped, his wings flapping with pride as Salvatore rose to his feet and pulled Harley upright. They all silently studied the seemingly solid wall of dirt that now blocked the tunnel behind them. Then, just when Salvatore hoped that something had actually gone right, Levet glanced toward the low ceiling. \u201cOops.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOops?\u201d Salvatore growled.</p><p>\u201cMaybe we should hurry.\u201d</p><p>Salvatore heaved a resigned sigh. \u201cDamn.\u201d</p><p>As one, they turned to sprint forward, no longer concerned about what might lie ahead, just as dirt began showering down on their heads.</p><p>The dash to stay ahead of the cave-in lasted nearly two miles, but at last the ceiling once again became stable, and better still, the tunnel widened and branched into two separate passageways.</p><p>Salvatore came to a halt, waiting for Levet to skid to a stop at his side. Despite his perfect vision in the dark, this cramped and dank place was more suited to a gargoyle than a Were.</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you sense?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>Levet sniffed the air and pointed his hand to the right. \u201cThis tunnel has an opening thirty or forty feet past the curve.\u201d There was more sniffing. He pointed to the left. \u201cThat one...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Salvatore prompted.</p><p>\u201cIt continues on, but I cannot tell more than that. It has not been used for several years.\u201d</p><p>Salvatore hesitated only a moment before coming to his decision.</p><p>\u201cCan you get past any curs who will be waiting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you are attempting to insult me...\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you do it?\u201d</p><p>Before Levet could answer, Harley grabbed his arm and jerked him around to meet her scowl.</p><p>\u201cJust hold on. What are you planning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have to split up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSplit up? Are you kidding?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf Levet can get past the guards, he can contact Styx and let him know we\u2019re in trouble.\u201d</p><p>She blinked in surprise and Salvatore smiled wryly. Hell, she couldn\u2019t be any more shocked than he was. Before this moment, he would have laughed at the suggestion he would deliberately seek out the leeches for help. So far as he was concerned, the only good vamp was one who stayed in his grave, where he belonged.</p><p>Unfortunately, the suspicion that Briggs was still alive changed everything. Lunatic curs he could handle. A Were siphoning black magic meant that he had to swallow his considerable pride.</p><p>The vampires were the only ones he could trust to keep Harley safe.</p><p>\u201cThe vampire?\u201d she muttered.</p><p>Salvatore grimaced. \u201cAs much as it pains me to admit it, we\u2019re going to need his help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to use the vampires to kill Briggs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor now, all I want is to get away from Caine and his goons,\u201d he hedged.</p><p>She tried to hide her shiver. \u201cThen shouldn\u2019t we be trying to get out of these tunnels?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t doubt we could fight our way past the curs, but they\u2019ll be right on our tails. I prefer to slip away unnoticed.\u201d</p><p>Her scowled remained. \u201cWhat of Levet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe curs have no interest in a gargoyle, and once he comes out the curs will be expecting us to be behind him. Hopefully, it will take some time for them to figure out we aren\u2019t with him.\u201d</p><p>She gnawed her bottom lip, trying to find the flaws in his logic.</p><p>\u201cHave you considered the possibility that the tunnel might be a dead end?\u201d she at last demanded. \u201cWe\u2019ll be trapped.\u201d</p><p>Salvatore slowly smiled. \u201cTrust me.\u201d</p><p>She snorted. \u201cNot in a million years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d He grabbed Harley\u2019s chilled hand and glanced toward the silent demon at his side. \u201cGo, Levet.\u201d</p><p>Tossing his hands in the air, the tiny demon stomped his way down the dark tunnel.</p><p>\u201cGo, Levet. Come, Levet. Sit, Levet,\u201d he muttered, making sure his voice carried back to Salvatore. \u201cYou do know I am not the dog around here?\u201d</p><p>With a roll of his eyes, Salvatore tugged Harley in the opposite direction.</p><p>\u201cCristo. I hope one of the damned curs eats him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t very grateful,\u201d she predictably protested. The damned gargoyle possessed an unfathomable appeal to the fairer sex. Color him baffled. \u201cHe did rescue us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will give you anything you desire if you keep that our little secret.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cIs the big bad wolf embarrassed to be saved by the itty bitty gargoyle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat itty bitty gargoyle could drive a perfectly reasonable demon over the edge,\u201d he grumbled.</p><p>Thankfully, Harley was smart enough to let the conversation drop.</p><p>\u201cAlways presuming we live long enough to get out of these tunnels, what do you intend to do?\u201d Harley demanded.</p><p>Salvatore slowed his pace as the passageway narrowed, batting aside the thick cobwebs.</p><p>\u201cFirst I intend to get you somewhere safe,\u201d he said, too distracted to consider his words. Stupid mistake. \u201cThen I\u2019ll deal with Briggs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. So you intend to unload me on the vampires so the manly man can take care of business without having to tend to the helpless womenfolk?\u201d</p><p>He winched at the sugary sweetness that dripped from her voice.</p><p>\u201cBriggs isn\u2019t your battle to fight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can do anything you want to Briggs, but I can keep myself safe, thank you very much,\u201d she snapped. \u201cYou aren\u2019t my mother.\u201d</p><p>Salvatore was at least smart enough not to press the issue. She would be going to Chicago with Styx. End of story. But there was no need to argue before he could manage to contact the vampire.</p><p>\u201cBe thankful I\u2019m not your mother,\u201d he instead distracted her. \u201cSophia wouldn\u2019t have been pleased at being locked in a cell. There\u2019s no telling what carnage she would have caused.\u201d</p><p>Harley stumbled, her breath suddenly ragged. \u201cShe\u2019s...alive?\u201d</p><p>Something dangerous, almost tender, stirred in the depths of Salvatore\u2019s heart.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s very much alive,\u201d he said gently. \u201cShe\u2019s been searching for you and your sisters, just as I have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo she\u2019s near?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe last I heard she was in Kansas City.\u201d</p><p>Harley abruptly shook her head, obviously disturbed by the realization.</p><p>\u201cGod.\u201d</p><p>Salvatore kept his gaze trained on the tunnel that was slowly heading upward, sensing his companion would be horrified if she knew the vulnerability etched on her beautiful face.</p><p>\u201cHarley.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you imagining Sophia as some kind of June Cleaver,\u201d he cautioned, not wanting her to think a reunion with Sophia was going to be some fantasy lovefest.</p><p>The tough female Were didn\u2019t have a motherly bone in her body.</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>He sighed at her confusion. He forgot she was only thirty years old.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just say she isn\u2019t the maternal type.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about my father?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne of several donors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDonors?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSperm donors.\u201d</p><p>She sucked in a sharp breath. \u201cOf course. I was brewed in your lab,\u201d she muttered. Then without warning, she yanked her hand from his grip. \u201cHoly shit.\u201d</p><p>Salvatore turned his head to meet her horrified gaze. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t one of the donors, were you?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His sudden laughter echoed through the darkness. \u201cNo, cara, I don\u2019t have a God complex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, right.\u201d</p><p>His gaze skimmed deliberately down her slender form, allowing his searing awareness to heat the air around them.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t create you to be my daughter, Harley. I created you to be my queen.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Seven</p><p>Harley was thankful that Salvatore\u2019s outrageous claim managed to distract her from the knee-weakening relief that there was no possibility he might be her father.</p><p>Talk about ick factor.</p><p>\u201cQueen?\u201d she asked. Okay, it was more a squeak, much to her embarrassment.</p> <p>Salvatore flashed a smile. \u201cIt\u2019s your fate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIgnoring your destiny won\u2019t alter it.\u201d</p><p>She should have punched the annoying bastard.

And even if she did, she would make damned sure that it didn\u2019t include becoming a part of this Were\u2019s harem.</p><p>Queen or no queen.</p><p>But oddly, it wasn\u2019t fury that raced through her. It was...excitement.</p> <p>\u201cJust shut up,\u201d she hissed.</p><p>She ignored his speculative gaze as the tunnel split in two, and they halted to study the less than appetizing options.</p><p>So far beneath the ground it was nearly impossible to determine which direction they were headed. Especially for Weres, who depended heavily on their sense of smell.</p><p>Salvatore hesitated a long moment, clearly no more confident than she was in knowing the best means of escape. Then, with a shrug, he took off down the left passageway.</p><p>\u201cThis way.\u201d</p><p>With little choice, Harley followed in his wake. As soon as they were safely away from Caine, she would decide when and where to ditch the arrogant King of Weres.</p><p>For now, she was willing to allow him to keep her from being put back in that damned cell.</p><p>\u201cIf you get us lost down here, I\u2019m not going to be happy,\u201d she warned.</p> <p>\u201cAnd that would be a change?\u201d</p><p>Ridiculously, his sardonic tone made her smile. \u201cSmart ass.\u201d</p><p>Silence descended as they continued to wind their way through the twists and turns of the narrow passageway, Salvatore\u2019s steps slowing the farther they traveled.</p><p>She frowned as she studied the broad width of his shoulders that seemed to droop with weariness, and the blood that stained the back of his once elegant jacket.</p><p>When had he been injured? And why weren\u2019t the wounds healing?</p><p>If they were truly deep, then he only had to shift. Once he was in wolf form he could repair even a grievous injury.</p><p>Her brooding thoughts were interrupted as they were forced to bend beneath a particularly low section of the tunnel, the distinct sound of a click echoing through the thick, silent air.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that?\u201d she breathed, already knowing it couldn\u2019t be good.</p><p>Whirling around, Salvatore grabbed her arm and thrust her ahead of him.</p><p>\u201cRun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d she demanded, taking off with as much speed as possible in the cramped tunnel.</p><p>\u201cA trap,\u201d Salvatore rasped.</p><p>On cue, there was the sound of grinding metal, then dust began to filter from the sides of the passageway. Expecting yet another ceiling to fall on her head, or the floor to open up and swallow her, Harley was unpleasantly surprised when silver darts began shooting from hidden slots in the walls.</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d</p><p>She crouched low and charged through the dark, hissing as one of the darts sliced through the back of her arm. Two more darts yanked through her ponytail, and one passed close enough to her ear that she heard it whistle.</p><p>She lost track of time, focused on dodging the barrage of silver that continued to shoot from the dirt walls.</p><p>Not a bad thing to focus on, considering the dart she barely avoided before it slammed into her temple.</p><p>It was not until the pelting projectiles had slowed to an occasional unpleasant surprise that Harley at last realized that Salvatore had fallen several steps behind, his beautiful face covered in a sheen of sweat, his hair plastered to his head.</p><p>She stumbled to a halt, an odd alarm clenching her heart.</p><p>\u201cSalvatore?\u201d</p><p>He stabbed her with an annoyed glare, his eyes glowing with a golden light.</p><p>\u201cJust keep running.\u201d</p><p>A stray dart shot between them and Harley heaved a resigned sigh. She couldn\u2019t just leave him. Not when he was obviously injured.</p><p>Why she couldn\u2019t was not something she intended to mull over.</p><p>\u201cCrap.\u201d Moving to his side, she draped one of his arms around her shoulders and grabbed him around the waist, taking as much weight as he would allow as they continued down the tunnel. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen Levet broke into the cell, it sent a shower of silver in my shoulder,\u201d he grudgingly confessed. \u201cIt\u2019s draining my strength.\u201d</p><p>That would certainly explain his inability to shift, and his weakness. Still, she couldn\u2019t shake off the sensation that he wasn\u2019t being entirely honest.</p><p>\u201cWe have to find some place to rest,\u201d she said, her own legs beginning to feel the strain as the tunnel dipped and curved, leading to seeming nowhere.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He sucked in a shaky breath. \u201cThis tunnel isn\u2019t safe.\u201d</p><p>She sighed, pretending she didn\u2019t notice his musky male scent and the heat of his hard body that was sending tiny flutters through the pit of her stomach.</p><p>\u201cAre you always so stubborn?\u201d</p><p>He managed a crooked, knee-weakening smile. \u201cI\u2019m charmingly determined.\u201d</p><p>Charmingly determined? He was frigging beautiful was what he was.</p><p>Even covered in filth, with his suit in tatters and his hair tangled, he was drop-dead, mind-numbingly beautiful.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a pain in the ass,\u201d she muttered, more annoyed by her potent awareness of this Were than his teasing.</p><p>\u201cAs long as it\u2019s your ass...\u201d His drawling words trailed away, his golden eyes narrowed. \u201cWait.\u201d</p><p>She frowned, grudgingly coming to a halt. \u201cI thought you wanted to keep moving?\u201d</p><p>He reached out a slender hand to press it against the side of the tunnel.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a way out just behind this wall.\u201d</p><p>Harley squashed the distraction of Salvatore\u2019s presence and concentrated on the wall, feeling the echo just beyond the dirt.</p><p>\u201cI feel it.\u201d She opened her eyes. \u201cCan we get through?\u201d</p><p>Salvatore straightened, pulling away from her. \u201cThere\u2019s only one way to find out.\u201d</p><p>Before she could point out they were currently absent a pick and shovel, Salvatore whirled in a movement too fast for human sight and kicked his foot against the hard dirt. Harley winched as his foot punched a large hole through the wall, revealing there was indeed an opening on the other side.</p><p>Damn. He could knock off a man\u2019s head with that kick.</p><p>Or the head of a mouthy female.</p><p>Dismissing the unpleasant possibility, Harley moved forward, tugging at the clumps of crumbling dirt to enlarge the hole. She had barely started when Salvatore was at her side, his breath rasping as he shoved at a particularly stubborn rock.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be Superman,\u201d she said tartly. \u201cI can do this.\u201d</p><p>His brief smile was strained. \u201cThe sooner we get out of here, the sooner we can find someplace safe to hide.\u201d</p><p>Harley grimaced, feeling as if she had been dipped, dredged, and battered in grime.</p><p>\u201cThis someplace better have a shower.\u201d</p><p>Salvatore grunted, managing to shove aside the rock. Then, without hesitation, he pressed himself through the narrow opening. Harley rolled her eyes as she hurried behind him. Clearly it didn\u2019t occur to him to allow her to take lead, despite the fact he looked close to total collapse.</p><p>Typical.</p><p>He\u2019d rather fall flat on his face than admit he needed a woman\u2019s help.</p><p>She had always suspected that testosterone sucked any common sense from the male brain.</p><p>Entering the cramped chamber carved in the dirt, Harley paused to take in her surroundings. Not an overwhelming task. There was nothing more than a pile of stones in one corner, and across the room, an opening that revealed some roughly carved stairs.</p><p>She had, however, heard Caine speak of his various spiderweb of tunnels, and she knew there was more here than met the eye.</p><p>\u201cThe stairs,\u201d Salvatore muttered, heading toward the opening.</p><p>\u201cHold on.\u201d</p><p>His expression tightened with a weary impatience. \u201cHarley.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCaine always keeps stashes hidden, in case of a hasty exit,\u201d she said, moving to the loosely piled stones. Her kick held considerably less impact that Salvatore\u2019s, but it was enough to send the rocks flying to reveal a pile of objects that had been hidden beneath them. \u201cSee?\u201d</p><p>Moving to her side, Salvatore reached to pluck the two loaded handguns off the ground, surprisingly shoving one into her hand before tucking the other into his waistband at his lower back.</p><p>The large ivory-handled dagger disappeared into a holster beneath his tattered pant leg, but he appeared far more interested in the tiny silver medallions that were half-buried beneath the dirt.</p><p>Most people would dismiss them as pieces of junk. A stupid mistake. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI recognize these,\u201d he said, gathering the medallions in his hand, a smile of satisfaction curving his lips.</p><p>Harley shrugged. \u201cAmulets.\u201d</p><p>He tilted one of the amulets to display the odd symbol etched into the thin metal.</p> <p>\u201cCaine\u2019s cur pack used these to hide from me while they were in Hannibal.\u201d</p><p>Abruptly, Harley realized that Salvatore\u2019s scent had disappeared.

Instead, he headed directly north, toward the far more distant Chicago and the damned leeches.</p><p>Harley\u2019s expression was puzzled as they ran past the fields and dark farmhouses, but for once she kept her opinion of his leadership abilities to herself. Or perhaps she simply concluded that Caine was more likely to start his search on the roads leading south.</p><p>In either case, Salvatore was relieved not to have to fight with the female. In his current state, he wasn\u2019t at all certain he could win.</p><p>Devoting the majority of his attention to making sure that nothing leaped at them from the cornfields and thick patches of trees, Salvatore wearily tripped over a fallen log that was hidden by the thick weeds.</p><p>\u201cEnough,\u201d Harley snapped, an odd anger in her voice as he smoothly regained his balance and turned to meet her glittering gaze. \u201cWe have to find someplace to rest.\u201d</p><p>He regarded her in a thoughtful silence. Was she concerned for him?</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a town just beyond the hill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA town?\u201d Her brow furrowed. \u201cI\u2019m not sure that\u2019s a good idea. Caine could have spies anywhere, and we don\u2019t exactly blend in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we\u2019ll be careful not to be seen.\u201d Taking her hand, he pulled her through the field and up the gentle swell that overlooked the small town. \u201cThere.\u201d</p><p>He could feel Harley\u2019s tension increasing as they neared the outskirts of the sleeping town, reaching a near panicked level as they traveled through the handful of blocks that made up the business district. Salvatore kept a firm grip on her hand as he headed straight toward the L-shaped motel that promised cable TV and Internet access.</p><p>He was too close to the promise of a hot bath and clean sheets to risk having to spend the rest of the night chasing his high-strung companion.</p><p>Carefully testing the air, Salvatore rounded the back of the motel, halting at the door nearest the end of the building. There were only a few guests occupying the various rooms, and all of them were human.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t check into a motel like this,\u201d Harley hissed, tugging her hand free to indicate his filthy, unkempt appearance. \u201cThey\u2019ll call the police.\u201d</p><p>Salvatore smiled, moving forward to turn the knob, easily breaking the lock and shoving open the door.</p><p>\u201cI have my own check-in system.\u201d</p><p>Not nearly as impressed by his ability to find them shelter as she should have been, Harley stepped through the door and flipped on the light. Following behind her, Salvatore grimaced.</p><p>Okay, maybe he couldn\u2019t expect her to be excessively impressed.</p><p>Perhaps not even slightly.</p><p>The room was larger than those in newer hotels, with a bed on one side and a pair of chairs and small table set beneath the window on the other. But the cheap furnishings had long ago given up the battle against shabbiness, and the turquoise paint was peeling off the wall. And the carpet...</p><p>Salvatore shuddered.</p><p>He moved across the room to peer into the bathroom, prepared for the chipped shower and vanity in a nasty shade of salamander.</p><p>Moving to his side, Harley wrapped her arm around her waist, her expression tense.</p><p>\u201cWhat if the manager rents out this room?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHighly doubtful at this hour, even if there was anyone desperate enough to stop here.\u201d He slid a challenging glance in her direction. \u201cDo you want a shower or not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what are you going to be doing?\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cMaking myself useful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cForget it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake your shower, cara,\u201d he murmured, stealing a swift kiss before pressing her into the bathroom. \u201cI\u2019m in no condition to scrub your back. At least not with the attention to detail that I prefer.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes narrowed, her expression defiant. \u201cI\u2019m locking the door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI insist, and keep that gun where you can use it,\u201d he murmured, pulling the door shut and waiting for her muttered curse and the lock to be slammed into place before turning to head out of the motel room and into the night.</p><p>A weary smile curved his lips as he moved silently through the shadows, heading toward the stores that had closed hours before.</p><p>He was on the run from a Were who should have died centuries ago, he had no idea what had happened to his servants, he had no money, no cell phone, and the silver digging into his shoulder felt like ragged shards of lava, but there was no mistaking the raw, primitive satisfaction that burned through his blood.</p><p>Finding Harley completed him.</p><p>It was that simple and yet, that insanely complex.</p><p>And it was nothing less than a miracle.</p><p>Halting at the back of a dress shop, Salvatore easily dealt with the cheap lock, using his powers to turn off the alarm system. Collecting a few plastic bags, he moved through the darkness to fill them with a change of clothing for Harley and himself, as well as a nightgown that Harley would no doubt insist upon wearing.</p><p>He hesitated a moment over the delicate lingerie, ruefully choosing a sports bra and matching undies rather than the silky thongs. Harley would choke him in his sleep with the thong if he brought it back to the motel.</p><p>Perhaps someday...</p><p>He paused long enough to empty out the cash register, making a mental note to reimburse the owner. Not that he particularly cared about a human\u2019s business. But if Darcy discovered he\u2019d stolen from the shop, she would pester him for weeks about his corrupted karma. And unfortunately, he might need the tenderhearted Were to convince Harley that he wasn\u2019t some rabid monster who was plotting to kill her.</p><p>Leaving the dress shop, Salvatore made a stop at the small deli to scoop up several packaged sandwiches and bags of chips before making a final sweep of the neighborhood and returning to the motel room.</p><p>Careful to close the door and slide the bolt, Salvatore turned and...</p><p>\u201cDio,\u201d he breathed, staring at Harley as she stood in the middle of the hotel room.</p><p>Her wet hair hung loosely around her shoulders, the amulet dangled on a thin strip of material she\u2019d ripped from a washcloth and tied around her neck, she wore nothing more than a towel she\u2019d wrapped around her still damp body, and the gun was held in one hand with a casual expertise.</p><p>She should have looked ridiculous.</p><p>Instead, Salvatore felt as if he\u2019d just been kicked in the gut as he met the hazel eyes that flashed with a smoldering fury.</p><p>She was sexy, and dangerous as hell.</p><p>\u201cWhere have you been?\u201d she demanded, her hand tightening on the gun. As if she was considering the pleasure of shooting him.</p><p>He reached down to grasp the bags and piled them onto the bed, clever enough to hide his smile of satisfaction at her annoyance.</p><p>\u201cWe needed supplies,\u201d he smoothly explained.</p><p>\u201cAnd what if you\u2019d stumbled across one of Caine\u2019s pack? Or that Briggs?\u201d</p><p>He turned to meet her scowl. \u201cWere you worried for me, Harley?\u201d</p><p>She stiffened, not about to admit the truth.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re in no condition to be out running around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, you do care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou might have led them here.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t followed.\u201d</p><p>Prowling forward, Salvatore stripped off his tattered jacket and shirt, tossing them on the floor.</p><p>Harley instinctively stepped back, although she couldn\u2019t hide the manner in which her gaze lingered on his bare chest.</p> <p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need you to dig out the silver in my shoulder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith what?\u201d She shook her head as Salvatore reached down to pull the dagger from the sheath at his ankle. \u201cNo. No way.\u201d</p><p>Salvatore plucked the gun from her hand, tossing it on the bed before pressing the hilt of the dagger into her unwilling fingers.</p><p>\u201cIt has to be done, Harley. I can\u2019t reach them.\u201d</p> <p>She clenched her jaw, trapped between her desire to condemn him to hell and the knowledge that his injuries wouldn\u2019t heal until the silver was gone.</p><p>\u201cDamn.\u201d She pointed toward the chair by the small table. \u201cSit down.\u201d</p><p>Taking his seat, Salvatore waited until Harley was standing rigidly behind him, reaching over his shoulder to grasp her hand and press it to his lips.</p><p>\u201cJust the silver, cara.\u201d</p><p>She predictably yanked her hand from his touch, but Salvatore didn\u2019t miss the care she took not to jostle his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cIf I decide to kill you, it won\u2019t be with a knife in the back,\u201d she muttered. \u201cHold still.\u201d</p> <p>Bracing his hands against his knees, Salvatore closed his eyes and concentrated on his breathing. Unlike vamps, he didn\u2019t have the ability to go into a healing trance to avoid his injuries. Until he could shift, he had to grin and bear it.</p><p>Well, not grin.</p><p>It was more of a groan-really-loud and bear it.</p><p>Bowing his head, Salvatore clenched his teeth, trying to remember he was a macho king, while Harley sliced through his flesh, searching for the silver shards that had burrowed deep beneath the skin.</p><p>Harley cursed beneath her breath as she struggled with a particularly defiant shard.</p><p>\u201cAm I hurting you?\u201d she rasped.</p><p>\u201cHarley, you\u2019re cutting into my shoulder with a rather large knife,\u201d he pointed out softly.</p><p>There was another searing jolt of pain, then blessed relief as the last of the debilitating silver was removed and his natural powers kicked into gear.</p> <p>\u201cI think that\u2019s it,\u201d she muttered, giving a tiny squeak of alarm as Salvatore surged from the chair and with a burst of energy, shifted into his wolf form.</p><p>At any other time, Salvatore would have taken smug pleasure in Harley\u2019s gaze that clung to his large body with unconscious appreciation, perhaps even have done a bit of showing off to prove the strength of his body and the beauty of his thick raven fur.</p><p>Now, he sprawled on the carpet and shuddered as he struggled to heal his wounds, feeling as weak as a pup despite the mystical forces that flowed through his blood.</p><p>Any preening would have to wait.</p><p>A damned shame.</p><p>It was one of his finer talents.</p><p>His shoulder cramped as the torn muscles and punctured skin knit back together, the burned flesh being restored, although it remained tender. Tired, hungry, and weakened by the mating bond, it would take some time for him to fully recover.</p><p>Allowing himself only a brief moment to savor the primitive pleasure of embracing his wolf, Salvatore grudgingly shifted back to human, indifferent to his lack of clothing as he shakily rose to his feet.</p><p>A Were was rarely modest.</p><p>He did pause to scoop the amulet off the carpet. He didn\u2019t know enough about magic to know how close he had to keep the thing to hide his scent, but he wasn\u2019t willing to take any chances.</p><p>\u201cCristo. I need a shower,\u201d he muttered, crossing toward the bathroom. \u201cThere\u2019s food and clothes for you in the bags.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going to be okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not getting rid of me that easy.\u201d He glanced over his shoulder and pointed toward the bags on the bed. \u201cEat.\u201d</p><p>She stuck out her tongue. \u201cYes, sire. At once, sire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd behave yourself.\u201d</p><p>Leaving the door to the bathroom open, Salvatore stepped into the shower, sighing in relief as the hot water poured over his body. He was less pleased by the cheap motel soap and shampoo, but at least it managed to scrub away the grime, and wrapping a towel around his waist, he ripped a strip off a washcloth to tie the amulet around his neck.</p><p>He shoved the wet hair from his face and returned to the main room, a small smile curving his lips as he discovered Harley had pulled on the flannel nightgown that fell past her knees.</p><p>No doubt she assumed the repulsive garment would stifle his rampant desire. Instead, Salvatore found himself pondering the various methods of stripping it off.</p><p>He could do it slow, tugging the ugly fabric upward to reveal the body beneath, inch by glorious inch. He could do it quick, ripping open the gown with a sharp jerk. He could do it using nothing more than his teeth.</p><p>Pacing the floor with short, jerky steps, Harley watched as he moved toward the bed, her expression oddly wary.</p><p>\u201cNow what?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cNow I eat and we get some rest,\u201d Salvatore said, casually tugging off the towel and reaching in one of the bags for a pair of black satin boxers.</p><p>With a choked sound, Harley turned abruptly to stare at the wall, her back rigid.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t you call someone to come and pick us up?\u201d she gritted. \u201cThis isn\u2019t the most secure location.\u201d</p><p>Pulling on the boxers, Salvatore settled on the bed, leaning against the headboard as he took three of the roast beef sandwiches and wolfed them down.</p><p>Literally.</p><p>\u201cI intend to be on the move before anyone could reach us. Is there a problem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want a list?\u201d There was a pause, then squaring her shoulders, Harley turned to scowl at him. \u201cTell me why you don\u2019t want to call your pack. The truth.\u201d</p><p>Salvatore stiffened in surprise. He hadn\u2019t expected her to be able to read him with such ease.</p><p>It was...unnerving.</p><p>He wiped his hands and piled the empty wrappers on the nightstand.</p><p>\u201cI have no proof, but I suspect that Briggs is capable of controlling the minds of both Weres and curs, if only for a short amount of time,\u201d he confessed.</p><p>Her brows lifted. \u201cDid he control your mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but before I battled him, I was attacked by Weres who had always been unquestionably loyal to me.\u201d His hands clenched in ancient anger. \u201cI was forced to kill more than one of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe they just weren\u2019t as loyal as you thought they were.\u201d</p><p>Salvatore shrugged. He wished she was right. It was easier to accept he\u2019d killed traitors rather than faithful companions who\u2019d been under the compulsion of Briggs.</p><p>Unfortunately, he knew his servants too well.</p><p>They would carve out their own hearts before betraying him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to take any chances.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you are taking a chance,\u201d she pointed out. \u201cFor all you know, my mind might be under the control of Briggs.\u201d</p><p>Salvatore snorted. \u201cYou\u2019re too bloody stubborn to be controlled by anyone. Besides, I\u2019ve been with you for hours. I doubt Briggs\u2019s power lasts more than a few minutes.\u201d</p><p>She considered his words, absently nibbling on her thumbnail.</p><p>\u201cI suppose it would explain Caine\u2019s ridiculous belief he had some sort of vision,\u201d she conceded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d say his outsized ego has as much to do with his visions as Briggs\u2019s,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>She ignored his sour opinion of the cur. \u201cIt seems risky to expose vampires to a magic-mad Were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe vamps are impervious to mind control. Unfortunately, it\u2019s too close to dawn for them to travel. We\u2019ll have to wait until tomorrow night to meet up with them.\u201d He patted the mattress. \u201cFor now we rest.\u201d</p><p>She licked her lips, abruptly appearing more disturbed by joining him on the bed than his confession that Briggs could control minds.</p><p>\u201cFine. You rest and I\u2019ll keep watch,\u201d she croaked.</p><p>\u201cI already did a sweep. No one knows that we\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t be sure...\u201d She sucked in a startled breath as Salvatore slid off the bed, and with fluid speed, had moved to snatch her off her feet. \u201cDammit, put me down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith pleasure.\u201d</p><p>With two long strides he was tossing her onto the bed and swiftly covering her with his body. A violent pleasure surged through him at the feel of her slender curves that fit perfectly against him.</p><p>Dio.</p><p>He didn\u2019t know if it was the mating bond that made him react with such raw, biting hunger to this particular female, or if it was simply a normal reaction between a man and woman, and in truth, he didn\u2019t care.</p><p>He wanted her.</p><p>Now.</p><p>Salvatore watched the hazel eyes darken as Harley reacted to the prickling heat that filled the air, able to hear the sudden leap of her heart.</p><p>\u201cGet off me,\u201d she gritted, clearly not as pleased as Salvatore by their explosive response to one another.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re staying in this bed, Harley,\u201d he warned. \u201cIt\u2019s up to you whether we sleep, or enjoy a more pleasurable pastime.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Eight</p><p>Harley wrenched her gaze from the molten gold of his eyes, feeling as if she were slowly melting beneath the potent heat of his desire.</p><p>What the hell was wrong with her?</p> <p>She was in a cheap motel, on the run because she\u2019d been stupid enough to allow her curiosity to overcome her common sense, and in bed with a king she had been taught to fear and loathe for the past thirty years.</p><p>She should be kicking some serious Were butt, not battling the urge to sink her hands in that thick raven hair so she could tug his head down and kiss him senseless.</p><p>Of course, in her defense, the man was obscenely beautiful.</p><p>Not only his lean, savagely handsome face, but his body that more than lived up to its promise once the ragged clothing had been removed.</p><p>His bronzed skin was smooth and stretched tautly over the lean, sculpted muscles that rippled with a fascinating ease. His chest was broad and tapered to a slender waist, his arms were toned without unnecessary bulk, and his hands were perfectly formed, with slender fingers that were currently stroking her shoulders with a tender touch that sent streaks of heat to all her most intimate places.</p> <p>Yummy goodness from the top to bottom, and every place in between.</p><p>Damn him.</p><p>\u201cYou deliberately picked a room with only one bed, didn\u2019t you?\u201d she accused, her voice embarrassingly husky.</p><p>\u201cI chose the room farthest from the office and out of sight of the road.\u201d A slow, wicked smile curved his lips. \u201cThe fact that it only has one bed is a bonus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBonus for you, maybe.\u201d</p><p>He lowered his head to nuzzle a spot just behind her ear, making Harley\u2019s heart stutter in shock. When had that particular spot become so sensitive?</p> <p>\u201cI could make sure it\u2019s a bonus for you as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so full of yourself...\u201d Her taunting words were completely ruined as his seeking lips found another point of weakness at the base of her throat. \u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, indeed,\u201d he growled, nipping her collarbone. \u201cDo you taste so sweet all over?\u201d</p><p>His exotic, musky scent invaded her senses, seeping into her skin like the finest aphrodisiac. The distracting smell clouded her mind, which was the only explanation for why her hands lifted to stroke down the magnificent length of his back.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing to me?\u201d she muttered.</p><p>His soft laugh brushed over her cheek as he reached down to grasp the hem of her nightgown, and with one smooth motion had it tugged over her head and tossed across the room.</p><p>\u201cDo you want a detailed explanation or will a brief overview do?\u201d he demanded, arching back to run a searing gaze over her body, now covered in nothing more than a pair of white panties.</p><p>Harley shivered, the golden gaze a near tangible force as it lingered on her oddly heavy breasts.</p> <p>\u201cYou know what I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, I don\u2019t have a clue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re using some sort of power to...\u201d</p><p>He shifted, settling between her legs that had instinctively widened. Lowering his head, the raven hair brushed against the puckered tips of her nipples.</p><p>\u201cTo what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo seduce me.\u201d</p><p>His tongue flicked over her nipple, the rough stroke wrenching a moan from her throat.</p><p>\u201cPower?\u201d</p><p>She dug her nails into the smooth skin of his lower back. \u201cDon\u2019t laugh at me.\u201d</p><p>He continued to tease her nipple, his hardening erection pressing with flawless precision against her feminine core. Oh...God. It felt good. Insanely good.</p><p>\u201cLaughing is not what I want to be doing with you,\u201d he said, kissing a path between her breasts.</p><p>\u201cGiuliani.\u201d</p><p>With a low groan, Salvatore surged upward to claim her lips in an openmouthed kiss that was hard with unrestrained hunger. Need blazed through her like wildfire, searing away any hope of resistance.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what power you\u2019re talking about, cara, unless it\u2019s the potent appeal of my manly charm,\u201d he husked against her lips. \u201cWhich I\u2019ve been told is irresistible.\u201d</p><p>Her hips arched upward in blatant invitation. \u201cI don\u2019t believe you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I can\u2019t want you. I don\u2019t even know you.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled, scorching a path of kisses down her throat. \u201cWe have all of eternity to become better acquainted.\u201d</p><p>She retained enough sense to shy from his possessive tone. The only thing in her life she was certain of was the fact she was tired of being manipulated by others.</p><p>From now on, she intended to be in charge of her own life.</p><p>\u201cNot likely,\u201d she warned, scraping her nails up his back. She reveled in his violent shudder of pleasure. \u201cAnd if you think this means I\u2019m ever becoming your stupid queen, then you can just think again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCristo, Harley,\u201d he breathed. \u201cCan\u2019t I even kiss you without you arguing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just don\u2019t want you thinking...\u201d</p><p>His hands skimmed over her body, his mouth planting restless kisses between her breasts and down the quivering plane of her stomach.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not thinking, cara,\u201d he rasped. \u201cAnd that is supposed to be the point. Let yourself go.\u201d</p><p>Harley nearly came off the bed when his tongue dipped into her belly button, a shocking bolt of pleasure aiming straight between her legs.</p><p>Lord. Salvatore\u2019s lovemaking was as intense and ruthless as his personality.</p><p>She felt like she was being battered with sensations. The relentless exploration of his hands, the thrilling expertise of his lips, the hard thrust of his erection.</p><p>It was like being tossed into the middle of a maelstrom with no idea of how she got there.</p><p>\u201cYou mean you want me to give myself to you?\u201d she managed to demand.</p><p>He lifted his head to regard her with open amusement. \u201cHow delightfully Victorian. If you prefer, I can give myself to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Way past the point of no return, Harley decided the only thing left was to take charge of the situation. Running her hands up the curve of his back, she plunged her fingers into his hair, and with one smooth motion she was flipping Salvatore onto his back and straddling his waist. She smiled smugly as she gazed down at his startled expression. \u201cThen you won\u2019t mind if I\u2019m on top.\u201d</p><p>Hell, no, Salvatore didn\u2019t mind.</p><p>What werewolf didn\u2019t like a woman who knew what she wanted\u2014and was daring enough to take it?</p><p>Especially if that taking included his body, which was primed and ready to please this female.</p><p>Of course, he would prefer if she wasn\u2019t glaring down at him as if she was debating between kissing him senseless or breaking his jaw.</p><p>Spread across the lumpy mattress, Salvatore allowed his hands to skim up her bare thighs, his gaze drinking in the sight of her delicate face framed by the fall of golden hair, the shimmering hazel eyes. His heart thundered in his chest as his gaze lowered to linger on the perfect breasts tipped with rosy nipples before lowering to the slender curve of her waist.</p><p>The male in him reacted with predictable desire to her naked beauty, but the stirring of his wolf was unexpected. He\u2019d never experienced having his animal so close to the surface during sex, and he was caught off guard by the violent excitement that pulsed through his blood.</p><p>She sucked in a sharp breath as his eyes glowed with the inner fire of his beast, filling the room with a golden light. But it wasn\u2019t fear that rippled over her features. It was the same raw need that clawed at him.</p><p>\u201cYou wanted to be on top, cara,\u201d he said thickly, his hands lifting to cup her breasts, his thumbs strumming her hardened nipples. \u201cShouldn\u2019t you be taking advantage of me?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes narrowed at his blatant challenge, her hands tightening in his hair as she leaned down to kiss him with a rough passion that made his wolf growl in pleasure. She tasted of vanilla and woman, magic and power all wrapped in sweet temptation.</p><p>Salvatore\u2019s hips lifted off the bed, rubbing his aching cock against her. Even through the satin he felt scalded by her heat.</p><p>Dio. He needed to be in her.</p><p>He needed to mark her with his passion, with his scent, with his very essence.</p><p>As if sensing his possessive animal instinct, Harley sharply nipped his bottom lip.</p><p>\u201cThis means nothing, Giuliani,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>His hands followed the curve of her waist, ripping off her satin panties.</p><p>\u201cWhatever lets you sleep at night, cara.\u201d</p><p>\u201cArrogant bastard.\u201d</p><p>Salvatore sucked in a sharp breath as Harley planted a path of wet, demanding kisses over his chest, her hips rocking against his erection. Arrogant? In this moment he would have happily gone down on his knees to beg Harley to put him out of his misery.</p><p>\u201cHarley.\u201d</p><p>His plea was cut short as she wiggled down his body, the tormenting kisses heading ever lower.</p><p>Gritting his teeth, Salvatore shifted his hands to clutch the blanket beneath him. It was that, or toss her back onto the mattress and take her with a furious hunger.</p><p>Unaware of how close he was to the edge, or perhaps simply enjoying her power over him, Harley continued to drive him mad, her lips sending tiny shock waves through his body. Then without warning, her seeking mouth closed over the tip of his cock, the moist heat branding him through the satin of his boxers. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCristo.\u201d He reached to grasp her arms, hauling her up his body to claim her lips with a force just short of pain. \u201cI throw in the towel, cara,\u201d he growled, his accent thick. \u201cI can bear no more.\u201d</p><p>She deliberately rolled her hips, her smile smug. \u201cShouldn\u2019t a king be able...\u201d Her eyes widened with shock as Salvatore reached to jerk down his boxers, and with one smooth motion was lifting his hips to pierce her damp heat. \u201cOh, God.\u201d</p><p>Smoothing his hands up her back, Salvatore sucked the tip of her breast between his lips, relishing her low moan of pleasure. She fit as tight as a glove around him, making him tremble with the effort to wait until she was accustomed to his penetration.</p> <p>\u201cSo good,\u201d he rasped. \u201cRide me, Harley.\u201d</p><p>Planting her hands on his chest, she lifted her hips, drawing him out to the very tip before slowly sinking back down, burying him deep inside her. Salvatore muttered a curse, his hands gripping her hips as he waged war against his looming orgasm.</p><p>Dammit. He was famed for his stamina. He could satisfy a woman for hours before claiming his own release. But never before had sex called to both the man and beast inside him.</p><p>Sweat gathered on his brow as he concentrated on the mesmerizing beauty of her face. For once her features were unguarded, flushed with passion, and her eyes dilated as she quickened her pace.</p><p>His hips lifted to meet her downward strokes, his growl of satisfaction filling the air as her fingernails bit into his chest, drawing blood.</p> <p>The air was scented with her arousal, her slender body bowing above him as she tipped back her head and lost herself in the pleasure.</p><p>\u201cSalvatore,\u201d she cried softly, a frantic edge in her voice as her climax neared.</p><p>\u201cCara,\u201d he whispered. \u201cLet go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...\u201d She moaned in relief as Salvatore tightened his grip on her hips, pumping deep into her with a relentless tempo. \u201cMore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs much as you desire, Harley,\u201d he swore, his hand cupping the back of her head and tugging her down so he could kiss her with savage pleasure.</p><p>Their tongues tangled, their bodies moving together with a growing desperation. Then, just when Salvatore feared he was going to explode, he felt Harley stiffen, her cry of completion muffled against his lips.</p> <p>Salvatore sank his fingers in her satin hair as her climax clutched at his cock, his hips slamming upward as he unleashed his passion in a flurry of unrestrained hunger.</p><p>His wolf howled in satisfaction as his orgasm burst through him, the shock waves of pleasure radiating through his entire body.</p><p>His.</p><p>His woman. His mate.</p><p>The other half of himself.</p><p>Salvatore jerked awake, muttering a curse as he realized just how deeply he\u2019d slept.</p><p>Not entirely unexpected. He\u2019d been forced to burn through his energy at a dangerous pace while he was injured. His body demanded the time necessary to recover. Even if it left him vulnerable.</p><p>Instinctively his arms reached across the bed for Harley. It was one thing to risk his own neck, and quite another to risk his mate.</p> <p>His eyes snapped open as his seeking hands found nothing but rumpled sheets.</p><p>\u201cHarley?\u201d he muttered, his sluggish mind belatedly recalling her smell was masked by the amulet. Dio. Leaping from the bed, he tugged on jeans and a white T-shirt as he noted the khaki shorts and shirt he\u2019d stolen for Harley were missing. \u201cStubborn, ill-mannered brat,\u201d he muttered, slipping on the running shoes and shoving his hands through his tangled hair. \u201cWhen I get my hands on her, I\u2019ll...\u201d Salvatore stiffened as the scent of cur tainted the air. \u201cShit.\u201d</p><p>Gathering the gun and dagger left on the nightstand, Salvatore cautiously slid from the room, avoiding the late afternoon shadows as he inched around the hotel to study the nearly empty parking lot.</p><p>Two men stood near the trash dumpster. One was a tall, gaunt human with thinning black hair and a narrow, impressively ugly face. The other was a young cur with clipped brown hair and the muscular body of a weight lifter.</p><p>\u201cA blonde, you said?\u201d the human was saying, a cunning light in his pale eyes.</p><p>The cur gave an impatient nod. \u201cTraveling with a dark-haired man.\u201d</p><p>Obviously angling for a bribe, the man cleared his throat. \u201cThat\u2019s not much to go on.\u201d</p><p>The cur bunched his muscles, predictably oblivious to the hints. Curs didn\u2019t do subtle.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t jerk me around,\u201d he warned. \u201cHow many strangers do you get in this hillbilly hellhole?\u201d</p><p>Stiffening, the man tossed two garbage bags into the Dumpster and headed for the motel.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should just be moving along.\u201d</p><p>With a low growl, the cur had moved to block the man\u2019s path, his hand shooting out to grab his shirt and lift him a few inches off the ground.</p><p>\u201cAnd maybe you should answer my question before I rip out your throat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus Christ, what the hell\u2019s up with your eyes?\u201d</p><p>Muttering a curse, Salvatore was crossing the parking lot. What was wrong with the stupid cur?</p><p>The first rule in the demon world was to always avoid the attention of mortals. Those who flaunted that particular law would soon find themselves dead. Or worse, hauled before the Oracles. The ruling Commission could devise punishments that would make death seem like a holiday.</p><p>Flowing forward with blinding speed, Salvatore clubbed the cur on the back of the head, calmly stepping over his unconscious form as it tumbled to the cement.</p><p>\u201cForgive me for intruding, but you looked like you could use some help,\u201d he drawled.</p><p>The human licked his lips, his eyes wide and hands shaking. \u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe man who apparently just saved you from having your throat ripped out.\u201d</p><p>With a shudder the man glanced down at the unconscious cur. \u201cThere\u2019s something not right with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrugs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never heard of a drug turning a man\u2019s eyes red before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA new designer drug from St. Louis,\u201d Salvatore smoothly lied.</p><p>The man frowned, but accepted Salvatore\u2019s ridiculous claim. \u201cYou know him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy partner and I have been tracking him since he escaped from the authorities two days ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a cop?\u201d</p><p>\u201cClose enough.\u201d</p><p>Proving he wasn\u2019t a full-fledged idiot, the human ran a suspicious gaze over Salvatore\u2019s hard features and lethal golden eyes. Not even casual clothes could hide his feral nature.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s your badge?\u201d</p><p>Salvatore shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m not here to interfere in your business, I\u2019m just looking for my partner. The blonde this man was asking about.\u201d</p><p>The man took a wary step backwards. \u201cThe blonde?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Have you seen her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to get involved...\u201d</p><p>Reaching into his pocket, Salvatore pulled out the roll of money he\u2019d stolen the night before.</p><p>\u201cI can make it worth your while.\u201d He peeled off a few bills, tossing them at the man\u2019s feet. \u201cWhere did she go?\u201d</p><p>Careful to keep an eye on Salvatore, the human bent down to snatch the money and shove it into his pocket.</p><p>\u201cI saw a blonde running up Main Street.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn foot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long ago?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot more than fifteen minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was alone?\u201d</p><p>The man straightened, shoving the money in his pocket. \u201cAs far as I could tell.\u201d</p><p>With a dip of his head, Salvatore headed toward the street. \u201cGrazie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, what about this guy on the ground?\u201d</p><p>Salvatore\u2019s pace never slowed. \u201cNot my problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t just leave him here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, I can, although I will offer you a word of warning.\u201d Reaching the stone wall that marked the edge of the parking lot, Salvatore easily vaulted over it to land on the sidewalk. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to be nearby when he wakes up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey...\u201d</p><p>The human continued to yell meaningless words, but Salvatore was already jogging down the street, forced to keep his pace frustratingly slow to peer in the passing shops.</p><p>Cristo. He\u2019d been an idiot to let Harley keep the amulet. It was practically an invitation for the headstrong Were to bolt, knowing he couldn\u2019t track her scent. Of course, on the upside, no one else could track her either, he reminded himself. And considering the number of enemies on his trail, that made the amulet a treasure beyond price.</p><p>No, if he had a brain in his head he would have let her keep the amulet and instead tied her to the bed.</p><p>Salvatore shuddered. Even after hours of sating his rampant desire, his blood still heated and his body hardened at the mere thought of the aggravating woman.</p><p>Not surprising.</p><p>He\u2019d enjoyed talented lovers over the years, but what happened between him and Harley hadn\u2019t been just sex.</p><p>It had been a stunning explosion of sensations that had bound him irrevocably to his mate. And he didn\u2019t even have the sense to regret the realization that his life was forever altered.</p><p>In fact, his only regret was that Harley was obviously not ready to accept their mating. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Reaching the edge of the town, Salvatore took a moment to consider his options. There was always the possibility that Harley had decided to return to Caine. She had to know the cur would be willing to forgive her anything if she agreed to stay with him. There was also the possibility that she\u2019d stolen a car and was even now speeding ever farther away.</p><p>His instinct, however, told him that she was still near.</p><p>Entering the woods that sprawled north of the town, Salvatore cautiously threaded his way through the thick undergrowth. In the distance he could hear the call of birds and the rustle of small game, but a heavy silence cloaked around him. Not unusual. Animals could sense his predatory nature. It was, instead, the prickle of energy that warned a Were was near.</p> <p>\u201cHarley?\u201d</p><p>Alarm trickled down his spine as the scent of rotting meat filled the air. Whoever was out there, it wasn\u2019t Harley.</p><p>Swiftly tugging off his clothes, Salvatore prepared to shift. Under normal circumstances there wasn\u2019t a Were born who could challenge him. Unfortunately, his unclaimed mating bond made him vulnerable.</p><p>Calling his power, Salvatore hesitated as a cold chill blasted from a small clearing just ahead of him and the shimmering outline of a man began to form. His hands clenched as he recognized the short Were with unkempt brown hair and crimson eyes.</p><p>He was paler than he recalled, his face thinner, and his eyes an even deeper red. But there was no mistaking the cruel features and whiff of madness that clung to him.</p> <p>\u201cBriggs,\u201d he hissed.</p><p>\u201cAh, Salvatore Giuliani,\u201d the man sneered, his English accent as pronounced as it had been centuries ago. Briggs had always been too arrogant to try to blend in with the crowd. Which explained the long black cloak he had wrapped around his slender body. Or maybe his taste in fashion was just that revolting. \u201cYou cannot know how long I have waited for this moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI presume you\u2019ve been waiting since I kicked your ass, tossed you in a fire, and spread your ashes on a dung heap,\u201d Salvatore sneered.</p><p>The crimson eyes flashed, the chill spreading to bite into Salvatore\u2019s skin. Dio. What had Briggs done to himself?</p><p>\u201cSo proud of yourself, and yet here I am.\u201d</p><p>Salvatore narrowed his gaze. He didn\u2019t know jack-crap about magic, but he was certain a Were couldn\u2019t suck enough power from his host to pop from one place to another. Briggs had to be projecting his appearance.</p> <p>Not that it made him any less dangerous.</p><p>Or less crazy.</p><p>\u201cBut not in all your glory,\u201d Salvatore taunted, vividly recalling that Briggs\u2019s weakness had always been his inability to control his temper. \u201cAfraid to face me like a true Were, magic-sucker?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd why should I bother when I have slaves to collect the trash?\u201d</p><p>Briggs lifted his arm and Salvatore staggered backwards as the Were sent a crushing command toward the distant curs. The years obviously hadn\u2019t taught the Were any restraint. He\u2019d always been a big fan of overkill.</p><p>Shaking off the pinpricks of pain, Salvatore studied his age-old enemy. It wouldn\u2019t take long for the curs to arrive. Before then, he needed to know how Briggs was still alive and what the hell he was plotting.</p><p>\u201cSurely you can\u2019t be idiotic enough to believe your curs can capture me?\u201d</p><p>Briggs smirked, confident he had Salvatore cornered. \u201cThey are remarkably inept, but they serve their purpose on most occasions.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot this occasion.\u201d Salvatore shrugged, deliberately nonchalant. \u201cUnless you have a few hundred hidden among the trees.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs always, you have sadly underestimated me, Salvatore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Briggs, as always, you\u2019ve overestimated yourself.\u201d Indifferent to the fact that he was stark naked, Salvatore folded his arms over his chest and peered down his nose at the smaller Were. Briggs hated to be reminded of his small stature. \u201cYou would think dying once would have taught you that you will never be as good as me. I\u2019m the king, and you\u2019re a tainted has-been who has to use black magic because he isn\u2019t Were enough to beat me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKing?\u201d Briggs curled his lips. \u201cYou\u2019re a pathetic upstart who stole what was rightfully mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf it was rightfully yours, I would never be allowed to sit on the throne. You were found unworthy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBastard.\u201d Briggs lifted his arm and Salvatore felt icy bands of power wrap around him, driving him to his knees. \u201cI will make you pay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMagic,\u201d Salvatore snarled, nearly gagging at the stench of rotting meat. A Were\u2019s strength was a warm, earthy force that had nothing in common with the twisted perversion of black magic. \u201cYou\u2019re pathetic.\u201d</p><p>Briggs moved toward him, his cloak rippling around him, though the leaves beneath his feet made no sound.</p><p>Freak.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not the one on my knees.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything you took from me.\u201d</p><p>Salvatore spit at the heavy boots that halted mere feet away. \u201cThe Weres will never accept a walking corpse who stinks of treachery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey will have no choice.\u201d</p><p>Salvatore\u2019s sharp laugh echoed through the trees. \u201cWeres always have a choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can give them what you cannot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>The Were smirked. \u201cA future.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuture? What the hell is that supposed to mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChildren.\u201d</p><p>Salvatore sucked in a stunned breath. No. This lunatic couldn\u2019t possibly have found the cure to heal the Weres. Fate might be cruel, but it couldn\u2019t be completely without mercy.</p><p>Briggs was an unstable, power-hungry despot who would lead the Were to certain destruction.</p><p>\u201cYou think you can produce children with magic?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cI would not be the first Were leader willing to seek help for our people through...unconventional means.\u201d A taunting smile curved his lips. \u201cHow do you think I was first introduced to the power?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou lie.\u201d</p><p>Briggs reached out to run a finger down Salvatore\u2019s cheek, his touch leaving a trail of frigid pain.</p><p>\u201cI was taken into the king\u2019s confidence when it was obvious I was to be his heir.\u201d His eyes flashed with pure hate. \u201cBefore you were born.\u201d</p><p>Salvatore gritted his teeth, trying to ignore the unease that stirred in the pit of his stomach.</p><p>The previous king had been a reclusive, sometimes volatile beast who too often disappeared for years on end. He\u2019d become even more secretive after Salvatore had come into his powers, rarely mingling among his pack.</p><p>But there hadn\u2019t been any hint he was brewing up evil in his lair.</p><p>That seemed like something Salvatore would have noticed.</p><p>\u201cIf that was true, then he would have shared the same information with me,\u201d he rasped.</p><p>\u201cHe was warned not to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWarned? By who?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy the ancient spirits.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCristo.\u201d Salvatore jerked from Briggs\u2019s painful touch. \u201cYou\u2019re completely nuts.\u201d</p><p>Fury tightened the gaunt face. \u201cDo not dare to mock me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re to be the great Messiah, then where are your creations?\u201d</p><p>With an effort, Briggs regained command of his temper, smoothing his hands down the ridiculous cloak.</p><p>\u201cAll in good time.\u201d</p><p>There was no mistaking the Were\u2019s smug confidence, and Salvatore was hit by a sudden suspicion.</p><p>\u201cGod, you can\u2019t believe you will change your pathetic curs into purebloods?\u201d He shook his head. \u201cI would expect such stupidity from Caine. But you, Briggs? How disappointing.\u201d</p><p>Briggs\u2019s expression was condescending, reminding Salvatore how much pleasure it had been to cut out his heart.</p><p>\u201cI merely offered the cur the opportunity to glimpse into his future. What he claims to have seen is no concern of mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf it isn\u2019t the curs, then where are your supposed children?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey will come when the time is right,\u201d Briggs assured him. \u201cYou interfered too soon.\u201d</p><p>Interfered? As much as Salvatore wanted to take credit for disrupting Briggs\u2019s nefarious plans, he hadn\u2019t done anything more than stumble across Caine. And...Harley.</p><p>A sudden, blinding rage rushed through Salvatore as he struggled against the icy bonds that held him.</p><p>\u201cYou son of a bitch,\u201d he ground out. \u201cYou will never have Harley, or her sisters. Never.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarley?\u201d Briggs appeared genuinely puzzled. \u201cAh, Caine\u2019s bitch.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cShe\u2019ll no doubt warm my bed, as will all the female purebloods.\u201d</p><p>Salvatore\u2019s rage faltered, his brow furrowed. \u201cYou can\u2019t fool me, Briggs. You\u2019re responsible for stealing the baby Weres from my nursery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, I did. And they have proven to be the perfect distraction.\u201d He chuckled. \u201cEven better than I could ever have dreamed possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou had four pureblooded babies snatched for a distraction?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew how desperately you were pinning your hopes on them and that you would sacrifice anything to retrieve them, even leaving your stronghold in Rome,\u201d Briggs drawled, his flagrant conceit etched on his face. \u201cThey were mere pawns in your ultimate destruction.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Son of a bitch.</p><p>Salvatore shook his head in self-disgust.</p><p>Of all the reasons he\u2019d imagined for the theft of the babies over the past thirty years, he\u2019d never even considered the possibility it had been a plot personally directed at him.</p> <p>\u201cYou deliberately led me here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs I said, it is not yet time to reveal my grand scheme,\u201d Briggs said, leaning down to better enjoy Salvatore\u2019s frustration. \u201cBut be assured...\u201d He bit off his words as his eyes widened in an unexpected horror. He leaned even closer, sniffing Salvatore\u2019s skin. \u201cWhat is that?\u201d</p><p>A savage smile curved Salvatore\u2019s mouth. \u201cThe mating bond.\u201d</p> <p>Briggs straightened, his pale face becoming downright pasty.</p><p>\u201cNo. It cannot be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cObviously, it can.\u201d</p><p>Caught in their battle of wills, neither men noticed they were no longer alone. Not until there was the distinct sound of a gun being cocked.</p><p>\u201cCheckmate this.\u201d</p><p>Salvatore\u2019s blood ran cold as he caught sight of Harley standing directly behind Briggs, her handgun pointed to the back of the Were\u2019s head.</p> <p>\u201cHarley, no!\u201d</p><p>Chapter Nine</p><p>Harley was already squeezing the trigger when Salvatore cried out. With deadly accuracy the bullet smashed into the back of the Were\u2019s head, the force of the blow sending him tumbling forward.</p><p>She instinctively kept the gun pointed at the stranger, her gut clenching as she watched the gaping hole in his skull swiftly knitting back together.</p><p>Where was the blood? The gore?</p><p>Not even the most powerful Were could be shot point-blank and not take a few minutes to recover.</p><p>Well, that was the common assumption.</p><p>A pity no one had told the scary Were who was already shimmering with power as he shifted.</p> <p>Harley\u2019s breath disappeared as the lethal animal with russet fur and large razor-sharp teeth turned to regard her with fierce crimson eyes.</p><p>Holy shit.</p><p>Harley never realized that blood could actually curdle.</p><p>Accustomed to curs, she was unprepared for the sheer size and terrifying power of a pureblood. The air thickened, choking her with the heavy sense of danger. Her skin prickled. And her muscles clenched.</p><p>Her gut impulse was to flee from the terrifying predator, but Harley possessed enough sense to freeze.</p><p>The fastest way to death was to give the big sceevy Were something to chase.</p><p>Instead, she steadied her arm and prepared to shoot the beast. It hadn\u2019t done much the first time. Okay, it had done something. It\u2019d pissed him off. But unable to shift herself, she didn\u2019t have much choice.</p><p>The Were lowered his head, preparing to attack, but before Harley could get off a shot, a furious howl split the air.</p><p>Stunned, Harley stumbled backwards, watching as Salvatore crouched on the ground, his body thickening and his face elongating as a thick raven-black fur rippled over his skin. In the blink of an eye, he was transformed into a huge werewolf.</p><p>God, he was beautiful, she acknowledged, her heart squeezing with an odd fear as he crashed into the unknown Were with a violent force.</p><p>Rolling across the clearing, the two purebloods ripped at one another with long claws, their jaws snapping. Harley lowered her gun, unable to risk taking a shot as the vicious battle continued.</p><p>The scent of blood filled the air, making Harley\u2019s stomach clench with dread. Salvatore was the larger, more aggressive Were, but the stranger appeared freakishly immune to his savage wounds.</p><p>It had to be Briggs, she told herself. Nothing but black magic could allow the lesser Were to survive Salvatore\u2019s brutal fury.</p><p>The realization, however, did nothing to reassure Harley.</p><p>How was Salvatore supposed to defeat a zombie Were with evil powers?</p><p>A pained yelp echoed through the trees as Salvatore at last rolled on top of the squirming Were, latching his teeth deep into his opponent\u2019s throat. The fight should have been at an end, but proving his unnatural powers, Briggs continued to claw at Salvatore\u2019s back, leaving deep scratches that oozed an alarming amount of blood.</p><p>Salvatore couldn\u2019t bleed to death, but he would quickly weaken if he wasn\u2019t allowed to heal.</p><p>Dammit.</p><p>Harley found herself moving forward, tired of watching from the sidelines.</p><p>She didn\u2019t have a clue what would hurt the Were, but she was willing to try anything. Starting with unloading a bunch of bullets straight into his head.</p><p>Circling wide enough to avoid distracting Salvatore, Harley waited until she had a clear shot at the Were\u2019s head before lifting her arm and aiming the gun.</p><p>Almost as if sensing her presence, Briggs shifted his crimson gaze to regard her with a malevolent warning.</p><p>God. Her throat tightened with an icy dread, but her arm never wavered. The thing was an abomination. The thought of it creeping around the world would give any sane demon nightmares.</p><p>Perhaps reading the determination etched on her face, the Were snarled with fury and Harley was hit with a blast of frigid air. Reeling backwards, she could only watch in horror as the thing disappeared with a loud pop.</p><p>Harley ended up flat on her back, more stunned by the Were\u2019s vanishing act than by the magical blow. She sucked a breath into her aching lungs, staring at the dappled sun that peeked through the heavy canopy of leaves overhead. Then without warning, her view was blocked by Salvatore\u2019s lean, darkly beautiful face.</p><p>\u201cHarley?\u201d He\u2019d changed back to human form, but the golden eyes continued to glow with power.</p><p>Sitting up, Harley pushed the hair out of her face and studied the hard naked body crouched beside her. It was worth studying at any time, but for the moment Harley\u2019s only interest was in the deep wounds that marred his bronzed flesh.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re injured,\u201d she breathed.</p><p>\u201cNothing that won\u2019t heal,\u201d he assured her, his expression concerned. \u201cWhat about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>To prove her point, Harley forced herself to her feet, knocking the dirt off her khaki shorts as Salvatore moved to pull on his jeans and T-shirt. His movements were stiff, but it was obvious he would recover, and Harley found her rush of adrenaline fading, leaving behind a vague unease.</p><p>When she had awoken earlier in the day to discover herself wrapped tightly in Salvatore\u2019s arms, she couldn\u2019t deny she\u2019d panicked.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t shock at having so thoroughly enjoyed their night of passion. The man was a flat-out no-holds-barred expert in bed. Even now her body tingled in all the right places at the memory of his skillful touch.</p><p>No, it had been the realization that she had so easily forgotten that Salvatore was still little more than a stranger. A stranger that until a day ago she\u2019d believed was her mortal enemy.</p><p>For all she knew, he was playing an elaborate game that was going to end with her dead. She\u2019d be a fool to trust him because he happened to be good in the sack.</p><p>Besides, for the first time in her life she was...free.</p><p>There was no Caine with his dire warnings of what would happen to her if she dared to leave his protection. No curs to constantly monitor her every movement.</p><p>And with the amulet, not even Salvatore would be able to track her.</p><p>So she\u2019d taken off.</p><p>Or at least, she\u2019d tried to take off.</p><p>Stupidly, she hadn\u2019t been able to shake the persistent uncertainty that plagued her as she had headed off to discover her long overdue destiny.</p><p>Salvatore claimed that her sisters, and even her mother, were alive. It could be a lie, of course. In fact, it probably was. Still, could she just walk away if there was the smallest chance of being reunited with the family she\u2019d thought she\u2019d lost forever?</p><p>Walking alone through the trees, she\u2019d at last accepted that she would never be satisfied until she discovered the truth of her sisters. Her destiny had waited for thirty years. It could hold off a few more days.</p><p>So she\u2019d turned around.</p><p>Watching the annoyingly beautiful man tie his shoes and collect his gun and dagger, Harley ignored the treacherous leap of her heart.</p><p>She was here to find her sisters.</p><p>That was the reason she\u2019d returned.</p><p>The only reason.</p><p>It had absolutely, positively nothing to do with Salvatore Giuliani, King of Weres.</p><p>Busy reminding herself of that very pertinent fact, Harley was caught off guard when Salvatore whirled toward the trees behind him.</p><p>\u201cCurs,\u201d he hissed.</p><p>Belatedly catching the unmistakable smell, Harley tightened her grip on the gun. Dammit. The pack was already circling them.</p><p>They\u2019d been so occupied with the near-death fight with the zombie Were that they hadn\u2019t even noticed the approaching trouble.</p><p>\u201cJust frigging perfect,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>Salvatore cupped her chin in his hand, his expression fierce.</p><p>\u201cRun.\u201d</p><p>She narrowed her eyes. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me what to do.\u201d</p><p>He growled in frustration. \u201cVery soon we\u2019re going to have a long conversation about the proper way of following orders.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny conversation about following orders is going to be very short and will probably involve bloodshed.\u201d</p><p>The golden light of his eyes flared, but before he could argue, two curs crashed into the clearing. Turning, Salvatore moved to stand directly before them, arrogantly confident despite the fact the two had already shifted into werewolves that were as large as ponies, and powerful enough to fill the air with a prickling heat. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sensing another cur approaching behind them, Harley silently slid behind a tree, her gaze still trained on Salvatore as he held out a hand toward the curs. Even from a distance she could feel a painful pressure filling the clearing.</p><p>She didn\u2019t have a clue what he was doing, but she suspected the curs weren\u2019t going to be happy.</p><p>She was right.</p> <p>With agonized whines the animals fell to the ground, their fur-covered bodies writhing. Still Salvatore continued to hold out his hand, his powerful compulsion hammering into the hapless curs.</p><p>Harley winced at the sound of bones popping. Somehow Salvatore was forcing the curs back to human form.</p><p>A painful process, if their howls were anything to go by.</p><p>Fascinated by the macabre spectacle, Harley nearly missed when the cur behind her began to move forward. Pressing herself to the tree, she shook her head in disgust as she recognized the man who was trying to sneak up behind Salvatore.</p><p>A red-headed, fiery-tempered cur, Frankie always had more brawn than brain.</p> <p>And thankfully, that included ramming headlong into a battle without making sure he wasn\u2019t about to be out-flanked.</p><p>Following silently in his wake, Harley pressed her gun to the back of his head.</p><p>\u201cHello, Frankie,\u201d she murmured. \u201cMiss me?\u201d</p><p>With a foul curse, Frankie whirled around, murder in his eyes. \u201cBitch.\u201d</p><p>Before he could guess her intent, Harley hit the idiot on his hard head with the butt of her gun, the force sending him sprawling onto the ground, knocked out cold.</p><p>\u201cYou have no idea.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDone playing?\u201d Salvatore asked, a faint smile curving his lips.</p><p>Harley shrugged. \u201cWhat now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow we leave.\u201d</p><p>She waved her gun toward the unconscious curs. \u201cWhat about the Three Stooges?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019ll be in the mood to follow us. At least not for a few hours.\u201d He moved to grab her hand, tugging her through the trees.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you do to them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a little reminder that I\u2019m their king.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLittle?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re still alive, aren\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>Harley grimaced. \u201cI thought you didn\u2019t have a God complex?\u201d</p><p>He chuckled, lifting her hand to brush his lips over her knuckles.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like to lose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll keep that in mind.\u201d She pulled her hand from his grip, unable to concentrate when he was touching her. Or at least, she couldn\u2019t concentrate on what she needed to concentrate on. Ripping off Salvatore\u2019s clothes and taking the gorgeous Were in the bushes wasn\u2019t going to help them escape. \u201cSo I assume that was the infamous Briggs?\u201d</p><p>Salvatore\u2019s smile widened, as if he could read her mind.</p><p>Jackass.</p><p>\u201cA projection of him.\u201d</p><p>Harley had heard of the trick, but she\u2019d never encountered anyone with the magical power to perform it.</p><p>\u201cHe wasn\u2019t really there?\u201d</p><p>Salvatore knocked aside a dead tree leaning across the path, leading her down a steep hill covered with leaves and loose stones. Absolutely perfect for sliding down and breaking her fool neck.</p><p>\u201cA portion of his essence was bound in the spell, but his physical form wasn\u2019t present.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe felt solid enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSi. It\u2019s the risky part of such a spell. Although he\u2019s far away, he can allow his spirit to become a solid force. It gives him the ability to travel at will, but it also makes him vulnerable to attack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen he was injured?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis physical body carries the wounds he suffered in spirit form.\u201d</p><p>Satisfaction flared through her heart. She hated to waste a perfectly good bullet.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad.\u201d</p><p>Salvatore\u2019s soft chuckle brushed over her skin. \u201cMy sentiments exactly.\u201d Pausing, the Were sniffed the air. Then seeming to come to a decision, he continued down the hill. \u201cThis way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe river?\u201d she muttered.</p><p>\u201cCurs hate water.\u201d</p><p>Harley licked her suddenly dry lips. \u201cSo do Weres.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich means the last thing they\u2019ll expect is for us to travel by boat,\u201d Salvatore pointed out, stepping through the last of the trees.</p><p>Harley\u2019s steps faltered as she realized that Salvatore had led them directly to a small wooden dock where a shiny new speedboat was moored.</p><p>Damn.</p><p>Like any sane Were, she hated the water.</p><p>No, it was more than just hate.</p><p>She was terrified of water.</p><p>There was no rhyme or reason to her fear. It wasn\u2019t as if she could drown. And as far as she knew, she\u2019d never had a childhood trauma that included water.</p><p>She only knew that the only good water was the kind that came out of a showerhead and then disappeared down a drain.</p><p>\u201cYou also claimed that they wouldn\u2019t be able to find us if we were wearing the amulets,\u201d she accused, biting her bottom lip as Salvatore nimbly leapt into the boat, and with a tiny surge of his power, had the motor running.</p><p>He glanced back to watch her far more cautious approach, his golden eyes sparkling with rueful amusement.</p><p>\u201cWhy did I know you would throw that in my face?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to be in the middle of a raging river when that demented Briggs attacks again?\u201d</p><p>He paused, easily sensing her tension. \u201cYou\u2019re scared of the water.\u201d</p><p>Grudgingly she moved down the dock, climbing into the boat with an awkward stiffness.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not scared. I\u2019m...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNaturally cautious.\u201d The boat rocked and Harley hastily dropped onto the padded seat next to Salvatore. \u201cHave you even driven a boat before?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged, reaching over to untie the line. \u201cHow hard can it be?\u201d</p><p>Harley popped to her feet, her heart stuck in her throat. \u201cNo way.\u201d</p><p>Salvatore pushed her firmly back into her seat, then before she could protest, he was pulling away from the dock and gunning the boat through the water.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Harley,\u201d he said over the roar of the motor. \u201cI\u2019m not going to turn us over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCapsize,\u201d she gritted. \u201cIt\u2019s called capsize.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cFine. I won\u2019t capsize us.\u201d</p><p>The river was high and choppy, lashing at the boat as if determined to smash it to tiny bits. Harley\u2019s stomach threatened to revolt, and she grimly latched her attention onto Salvatore\u2019s finely chiseled profile.</p><p>In the late afternoon sunlight his skin glowed with a rich bronze, his raven hair whipping in the wind. He looked hard and dangerous and ruthlessly male.</p><p>\u201cAnd what if Briggs makes a surprise visit?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>He flashed a teasing grin. \u201cThen capsizing will be the least of our concerns.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot helping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCara, I don\u2019t know how Briggs managed to find me, but I\u2019m certain it will take him time to heal. This is our best chance to get to Styx.\u201d</p><p>She clutched the edges of her seat. \u201cI should never have come back.\u201d</p><p>Salvatore kept his gaze trained on the gigantic barge that was headed in their direction, but Harley didn\u2019t miss the sudden tightening of his hands on the wheel.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome back?\u201d She shrugged. \u201cDoes it matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot nearly so much as why you left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t I leave? You\u2019re being hunted by a demented, magically enhanced Were and a large number of pissed off curs,\u201d she smoothly lied. No need explaining her fascination with him was what truly scared the heck out of her. His arrogance had already reached epic status. \u201cOnly a lunatic would hang around you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s the reason you left, then you wouldn\u2019t have snuck away while I slept.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI snuck away because I knew you would try to stop me. I didn\u2019t want to argue.\u201d</p><p>He snorted. \u201cSince when?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should just concentrate on driving.\u201d</p><p>Caine paced the small clearing, halting before the three curs who knelt in the dirt.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t surprised he was too late.</p><p>In fact, after he\u2019d realized Giuliani and Harley had found the amulets he\u2019d hidden in the tunnels, he was shocked the fools had stumbled across them at all.</p><p>Unlike his soldiers, Caine hadn\u2019t run blindly after prey he couldn\u2019t track. Instead, he had called for the witch who had made the amulets, knowing she could cast a spell to reveal their location.</p><p>At least their general location.</p><p>Magic was never an exact science.</p><p>Which was why he preferred not to depend on it.</p><p>\u201cForgive us, master, the Were overwhelmed us,\u201d Tio, the cur nearest to him, muttered, his face pressed to the ground. \u201cWe failed you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis power,\u201d a second cur, Drew, muttered. \u201cShit. I never felt anything like it.\u201d</p><p>Caine\u2019s jaw clenched. He didn\u2019t like to be reminded of Giuliani\u2019s power. Or how easily he could enforce his will on curs.</p><p>\u201cJust tell me what happened, you idiots.\u201d</p><p>In unison the three soldiers climbed to their feet, the two naked curs still trembling from Giuliani\u2019s attack while Frankie was nursing a wound to his head that was swiftly healing. Harley\u2019s work, no doubt. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Tio, his dark hair matted with sweat, answered. \u201cWe were searching for the prisoners as you commanded, and...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what the hell happened. One minute we were near the highway, and the next thing I knew we were here.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDid Giuliani call you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d The cur shook his head in confusion. \u201cHe was busy fighting with another Were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarley?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Some pureblood with red eyes,\u201d Frankie said. \u201cChrist, he gave me the willies.\u201d</p><p>Briggs. Caine clenched his hands at his sides. Damn the Were. He\u2019d gone to great lengths to keep his pack from coming in contact with the magic-wielding pureblood. Caine might be able to convince the curs he\u2019d been granted a mystical vision of the future; after all, they wanted to believe he possessed the power to offer them the chance to become purebloods. But they\u2019d be far less eager to follow him if they suspected his vision had forced him into a partnership with a traitorous Were who had sold his soul for power.</p> <p>Even curs had standards.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarley snuck up behind him and shot him in the head.\u201d Drew said.</p><p>\u201cStupid woman,\u201d Caine muttered, his heart freezing at the danger the female had put herself in. Dammit, he needed her. Or at least, he needed her blood. \u201cIs she trying to get herself killed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t matter,\u201d Frankie said. \u201cGiuliani shifted and attacked the other Were like a madman. I thought for sure he\u2019d kill him, but then the stranger just disappeared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFreakiest thing I ever saw.\u201d Tio\u2019s eyes were wide. \u201cAnd that\u2019s saying something.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDid Giuliani manage to injure the Were before he disappeared?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMauled the hell out of him,\u201d Drew said.</p><p>A chill bloomed in Caine\u2019s heart. Briggs had always been smugly confident that his power was greater than the King of Weres. Christ, he boasted of it with nauseating frequency.</p><p>What if he was wrong?</p><p>\u201cDamn.\u201d</p><p>With a frown of suspicion, Frankie moved forward. \u201cYou don\u2019t seem surprised that there\u2019s a Were out there who can simply disappear.\u201d</p><p>With a vicious backhand, Caine sent the cur flying backwards, blood dripping from his mouth.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should concentrate on finding the prisoners you allowed to escape before I have your pelt made into seat covers.\u201d</p> <p>Effectively reminded of who was boss, the three curs scrambled to obey his command.</p><p>\u201cYes, master.\u201d</p><p>Waiting until the curs had disappeared through the trees, Caine turned his attention to the blond-haired woman with plump cheeks and a lush body.</p><p>\u201cVikki.\u201d</p><p>Dressed in tight denim shorts and a tiny tank top that barely covered her generous breasts, she sashayed across the uneven ground to press against him.</p><p>\u201cYou need me, lover?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can sense them?\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes to concentrate on the spell she\u2019d cast before leaving his lair.</p><p>\u201cDistantly.\u201d She pointed her hand toward the river. \u201cThat way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo with the curs and keep me informed of their location.\u201d</p><p>Opening her eyes, she pouted at his sharp command. \u201cI want to stay with you.\u201d</p><p>He yanked from her clinging touch. \u201cI\u2019m not in the mood for games.\u201d</p><p>Fury raced through her pale eyes as she gave a toss of her curly hair and turned to join the curs.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t try to capture them. I just want to know where they are.\u201d</p><p>Without turning, she lifted her hand to flip him off. \u201cWhatever.\u201d</p><p>There was a faint rustle of brush before Andre appeared at Caine\u2019s side. The muscular cur with long brown hair and black eyes was Caine\u2019s second in command, and one of the few people that Caine actually trusted.</p><p>\u201cHow do you intend to overpower two full-blooded Weres who will be expecting you to attack?\u201d Andre asked.</p><p>\u201cA worry for later.\u201d</p><p>Caine bent down, studying the damage caused by the fierce battle between the two powerful Weres. Claw marks gouged the ground, splashes of blood and chunks of fur spread over the broken branches. He touched a tuft of pale fur, knowing it didn\u2019t belong to Giuliani.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA warning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>Caine straightened, his jaw clenched. \u201cA soldier only becomes a hero if he picks the winning side.\u201d</p><p>Salvatore had always been a predator. Wherever he went, whatever he did, he was the biggest, baddest creature around. And that\u2019s exactly how he liked it.</p><p>Suddenly becoming the prey...</p><p>It sucked.</p><p>Silently cursing Briggs and Caine and the persistent curs who he could sense in the distance, Salvatore angled toward the Illinois side of the river.</p><p>Sitting with white-knuckled tension at his side, Harley shot him a wary frown.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it? Is there something wrong with the boat?\u201d</p><p>He slowed as they neared the bank, grimacing at the thick tangle of mud and weeds that lined the river. Thank God his Armanis were safely tucked in his St. Louis lair.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not going to sink, cara.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why are you stopping?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe curs are back on our trail.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged, obviously having sensed already that they were being hunted.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re still miles behind us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs they have been for the last two hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo...\u201d The magnificent hazel eyes widened. \u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d Salvatore allowed the boat to idle as they drifted into the muddy shallows at the edge of the river. \u201cThey\u2019ve found a means to track us.\u201d</p><p>Harley considered a long moment. \u201cIt has to be the witch who made the amulets.\u201d She at last concluded. \u201cShe\u2019s the only one who could cast a spell to discover our location.\u201d</p><p>Salvatore reached to grasp a low-hanging branch, bringing the boat to a halt. Actually, the witch was preferable to the thought that Briggs had recovered swiftly enough to send the curs after them. His own body had healed, but his strength was ebbing toward low.</p><p>He was hoping to put off round two until he could recharge his mojo.</p><p>\u201cAll the witch can sense is the amulets?\u201d he asked, a plan already forming in his mind.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes Caine have any hunters?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly Duncan.\u201d</p><p>Salvatore\u2019s lips twisted. It was Duncan he\u2019d been scheduled to meet in Hannibal. The same cur he\u2019d found murdered on the floor of the cabin just minutes before Caine had attacked him.</p><p>\u201cThen Caine was an idiot to kill him.\u201d</p><p>She narrowed her eyes. \u201cSo you say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarley...\u201d He swallowed his protest. Only time would ease the suspicions that had been drilled into her. \u201cSomeday you\u2019ll trust me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t trust anyone.\u201d</p><p>He held out his hand. \u201cGive me your amulet.\u201d</p><p>She readily untied the amulet and placed it in his outstretched palm. Salvatore hid a satisfied smile as he yanked his own amulet from his neck. Harley might not realize it, but on some level she did trust him.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she demanded as he threw both amulets on the floor of the boat and then vaulted over the side to land in the waist-deep water.</p><p>\u201cIf the witch wants to chase the amulets, the least we can do is keep her entertained.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t we just toss the amulets overboard and keep going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey realize by now we\u2019re following the river north,\u201d he said, waiting for her to clamor out of the boat and stand at his side. Reaching forward, he thrust the throttle in gear, shoving the boat away from the bank and toward the middle of the river. \u201cIf they have any intelligence at all they\u2019ll have sent a few curs ahead to ambush us.\u201d</p><p>Harley watched the boat zip away, her color slowly returning. Obviously the muddy water and slimy moss that slithered around her body was preferable to continuing their boat ride.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll eventually stumble across our scent,\u201d she pointed out.</p><p>Salvatore\u2019s expression hardened. He would do whatever necessary to protect Harley, but this division between Weres and curs had to end.</p><p>Damn Caine.</p><p>Briggs was deliberately using him to weaken Salvatore\u2019s power base.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s hope for their sake that they don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Ten</p><p>Harley climbed the bank, relieved to discover that the Illinois side of the Mississippi River was a flat expanse of recently plowed fields, rather than the rolling bluffs she was accustomed to. She wasn\u2019t a wuss. She could run for hours without breaking a sweat. Hell, she could do it carrying a few hundred pounds on her back.</p><p>But at the moment her cheap canvas shoes were covered in slimy mud and her wet underwear was crawling into places it shouldn\u2019t be. The last thing she wanted was to slog up and down endless hills.</p><p>Besides, she didn\u2019t have to be a psychic to sense that Salvatore wasn\u2019t running on a full tank. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Big surprise there.</p><p>He\u2019d been caged, pelted with silver shrapnel, attacked by a zombie Were, and forced to discipline the curs chasing after them.</p><p>She doubted any other Were would still be on his feet, let alone be fully alert and on guard as he led them northward, choosing a path far enough from the riverbank to avoid the tangled overgrowth, and yet far enough from the farmhouses that dotted the patchwork of fields to avoid being easily spotted by a curious human.</p> <p>They walked for nearly half an hour, the distant scurrying of animals and whisper of leaves rustling in the wind the only sounds to break the silence. Harley sucked in a deep breath, appreciating the firm ground beneath her. Despite her nasty shoes and unruly underwear, she\u2019d rather hike for hours than spend another minute in the damned water. That\u2019s why she had feet, not fins.</p><p>Of course, she\u2019d always wanted to try flying. Now that looked like a fine way to travel.</p><p>Private jet, sipping champagne, and relaxing in plush seats, a yummy steward who specialized in introducing a woman into the mile high club.</p><p>Her heart skipped a beat as her fantasy of the blond Nordic steward morphed into a dark-haired, golden-eyed Were with a touch that could make a female howl in pleasure.</p><p>She sucked her thoughts away from the inevitable flashback. She didn\u2019t need a slow motion replay of Salvatore lying beneath her, his eyes glowing with a searing pleasure and his bronzed skin covered in a sheen of sweat.</p> <p>Sex, even fantastic oh-my-God-don\u2019t-ever-stop sex, was a complication she didn\u2019t need right now.</p><p>Returning her attention to their surroundings, Harley caught sight of the glint of steel beams of a large bridge spanning the river just visible over the top of the trees.</p><p>A bridge meant a town, thank God.</p><p>She\u2019d kill for dry clothes and something to eat.</p><p>A very large something to eat.</p><p>A side of beef sounded just about perfect.</p> <p>Her mouth watered, but her visions of a medium rare sirloin were shattered by the sound of an approaching car. Expecting Salvatore to ease back into the shadows of the trees, Harley lifted her brows as he instead crossed his arms and waited for the elegant black Mercedes to come to a halt in the middle of the dirt road.</p><p>\u201cNow what?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>Salvatore sniffed the air. \u201cImp. The scent is familiar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA friend of yours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI make it a rule to spend as little time in the company of imps as possible.\u201d A smile touched Salvatore\u2019s sensuous lips as the door of the car opened, and a tall woman with perfect curves and a stunning mane of shimmering red hair stepped out. \u201cOf course, there\u2019s an exception to every rule.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCreep,\u201d Harley muttered, astonished by the pang of envy.</p><p>Okay, the woman was drop-dead gorgeous with her pale skin and slanted emerald eyes. But what woman with a brain larger than a pea drove around country back roads in a skimpy black gown that barely covered the essentials and three-inch heels?</p><p>Slut shoes out here? Really?</p> <p>Harley had never fantasized about becoming one of those upmarket women who bartered beauty for wealth. She liked women who kicked ass.</p><p>Give her Lara Croft over Cinderella any day.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, cara,\u201d Salvatore drawled. \u201cI have quite unexpectedly become addicted to one particular female. There\u2019s not another who could possibly tempt me.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, right.</p><p>She rolled her eyes. No man acquired Salvatore\u2019s talent in bed by reading how-to books.</p><p>\u201cDoes that bullshit work on your harem?\u201d she mocked.</p><p>He managed to look surprised. \u201cI\u2019ll let you know if I ever acquire one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe King of Weres without a harem? I don\u2019t believe it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeing king isn\u2019t just a figurehead position, Harley.\u201d His shoulders lifted in a restless motion, as if in response to the heavy burdens he carried, his expression suddenly bleak. \u201cThe entire Were race is depending on me to save them from extinction. That doesn\u2019t leave a lot of time for collecting women.\u201d</p><p>Sashaying\u2014yes, she actually sashayed\u2014around the front of the car, the imp tossed her long mane of crimson hair, the scent of plums filling the air.</p><p>\u201cYour Majesty?\u201d She dipped her head in an oddly formal manner. \u201cI am Tonya, sister to Troy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCristo.\u201d</p><p>Tonya chuckled at Salvatore\u2019s horror. \u201cI take it that you remember my twin brother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s difficult to forget.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s his gift.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot the word I had in mind.\u201d The golden eyes narrowed to dangerous slits. \u201cHow did you recognize me?\u201d</p><p>Tonya pointed a finger in Harley\u2019s direction. \u201cI recognized her. She\u2019s the spitting image of her sister.\u201d</p><p>Harley forgot her unreasonable dislike for the imp. \u201cYou know my sisters?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI worked in Chicago until last month, when I transferred to Viper\u2019s club here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cViper opened a club in this backwoods?\u201d Salvatore glanced around the quiet farmlands. \u201cIt hardly seems a mecca for demons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have a specialty coffee shop that caters to humans, and a connected building for our more exotic clientele.\u201d The imp sent Salvatore a smoldering smile. Bitch. \u201cYou offer the right scratch for someone\u2019s itch and they\u2019ll drive miles to find you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd your job entails roaming the back roads for potential customers?\u201d Harley snapped.</p><p>Tonya ran a deliberate hand down the curve of her hip, her eyes holding the knowledge that there wasn\u2019t a woman alive who wasn\u2019t jealous of her outrageous beauty.</p><p>\u201cThe only thing that would bring me to the back roads is a command from Santiago. Oh, and the promise of some lovely cha-ching, of course.\u201d The imp actually purred at the mention of money. \u201cThere\u2019s a cash reward for whoever finds you first.\u201d</p><p>A perilous heat blasted through the air as Salvatore grabbed the imp\u2019s arm.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s offering this reward?\u201d</p><p>The imp had enough sense to step back in alarm. \u201cThe Anasso. He sent out a BOLO for the King of Weres and his mate\u2019s sister after he received some sort of mental text from a gargoyle. Since it was still daylight, Santiago sent out his nonflammable servants to keep watch.\u201d</p><p>Harley licked her lips, bombarded by a muddle of emotions. A growing confidence that her sisters were indeed alive. A relief that Levet had seemingly made it out of the tunnels. And a vague impulse to take off running and never look back.</p><p>Her life had always been predictable. Caine might move them from lair to lair, and the curs guarding her had changed throughout the years, but her days were pretty much the same no matter where they were.</p><p>Now...not so much.</p><p>Amazingly, being thrown into the middle of an adventure wasn\u2019t quite the exciting buzz she\u2019d always assumed it would be.</p><p>Salvatore waved a hand toward the waiting car. \u201cTake us to Santiago.\u201d</p><p>Tonya pouted. \u201cWhat about my reward?\u201d</p><p>A dangerous smile curved Salvatore\u2019s lips. \u201cI won\u2019t leave you tied to a tree for the hungry pack of curs chasing us. Good enough?\u201d</p><p>\u201cParty pooper.\u201d Turning on her heels, an impressive feat considering the rutted dirt road, she returned to the car. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>Harley lifted her brows as Salvatore led her toward the car. \u201cCharming as always.\u201d</p><p>A smile filled with wicked promise shimmered in his eyes. \u201cI need a good woman to teach me manners.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t look at me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I intend to do more than look.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWatch it, Salvatore, or I\u2019ll kick your royal ass.\u201d</p><p>He reached to pull open the door to the backseat, whispering in her ear as she bent to climb inside.</p><p>\u201cPromises, promises.\u201d</p><p>Heat swirled in the pit of her stomach, making her stumble and sprawl awkwardly across the leather seat.</p><p>Damned Were.</p><p>Straightening, she glared as Salvatore slid smoothly beside her, but his attention was on the imp as she turned a wide circle through the field before bouncing them back onto the road.</p><p>\u201cDo you have any werewolves as customers?\u201d</p><p>Tonya glanced in the rearview mirror. \u201cThose of the furry persuasion tend to avoid vampire establishments. A pity.\u201d Her voice lowered to a husky invitation. \u201cThey always make the best strippers.\u201d</p><p>Salvatore slid a glance in Harley\u2019s direction. \u201cStripping is not all we do well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmen,\u201d Tonya breathed.</p><p>Harley could have added a few amens of her own, but instead she gritted her teeth. The imp and her femme fatale act was wearing on her nerves.</p><p>\u201cAre you done?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot nearly...\u201d Salvatore began, only to grunt in surprise when she nailed him in the ribs with her elbow. \u201cAh, I\u2019m done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood choice,\u201d Harley muttered.</p><p>His smile widened. \u201cAt least for now.\u201d He returned his attention to the imp. \u201cWe need food. Any drive-thru will do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can prepare you a meal at the club.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI prefer my dinner hex-free.\u201d</p><p>Harley frowned in confusion. \u201cI thought purebloods were immune to hexes. It was one of the numerous things Caine used to bitch about.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cTonya is not just another imp if she\u2019s related to Troy.

Only the customers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe drive-thru,\u201d Salvatore commanded.</p> <p>Tonya shrugged. \u201cSuit yourself.\u201d</p><p>Harley settled back in the leather seat. \u201cHe always does.\u201d</p><p>Briggs was wrenched violently from his healing sleep.</p><p>He groaned, the pain of his wounds thundering through his stiff body.</p><p>Damn Salvatore. The bastard was going to pay for every second of his suffering.</p> <p>With interest.</p><p>For a moment he savored the image of Salvatore on his knees before him, his pride crushed as he begged for mercy. Then the lovely fantasy was interrupted by the savage pull of his master.</p><p>Shuddering at the sensation of an icy hand clutching his heart, Briggs tumbled off the narrow cot that was set in the back of a bleak cave.</p><p>He paused long enough to throw cold water on his face from a ceramic pitcher and pull a clean cloak from the carved chest set next to the bed before leaving the cave to enter the tunnel that led through the vast catacombs.</p><p>Briggs didn\u2019t know who had originally burrowed beneath the graveyard that was attached to the abandoned Victorian church outside of Chicago. Or even who had kept the ancient catacombs maintained during the years. He had been led here only a few weeks ago by the ruthless call of his master.</p><p>Until that moment, his contact with the demon lord had been through the former Were king\u2019s amber pendant that Briggs had stolen after it became obvious Salvatore Giuliani was destined to become the heir. Or the painful process of the demon speaking directly into his mind.</p> <p>Something that always left him regretting his blood oath to the bastard.</p><p>Then, without warning, the demon lord had commanded that Briggs leave behind his very comfortable lair in Kansas City to squat in the barren caves like a forgotten hermit. Even worse, the inner chamber that had once been an altar to the dark lord allowed the barriers between dimensions to thin. Briggs had traded his morals for power long ago, but even he had to shudder at the throat-clogging evil that crawled through the air.</p><p>He moved through the tunnels that headed ever lower, struck as always, by the smoothly polished stones beneath his feet that were unmarred by so much as a speck of dust or stray cobweb.</p><p>Not even vermin would dare disturb the malevolent shadows.</p><p>Bypassing the caves that had once been prisons for immortals, with their silver chains and walls lined with lead, Briggs entered the inner chamber, his nose curling at the lingering stench of human blood.</p><p>More than one sacrifice had been made in front of the forgotten altar in the middle of the floor.</p><p>And very soon there would be one more. Although this one wouldn\u2019t include worthless humans.</p><p>The knowledge was almost enough to compensate for the wounds that were taking far too long to heal.</p> <p>Almost.</p><p>Gritting his teeth, Briggs forced himself to kneel before the altar, flinching as the gold brazier flared to life next to him and a frigid blast filled the chamber. Above the altar, the air began to shimmer with a warped rip in the fabric that held the worlds apart, the odor of rotting flesh spilling into the cavern.</p><p>\u201cMaster,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have need of me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have proven to be a sad disappointment, Briggs, just as your father before you,\u201d the hollow voice echoed through the cavern, biting into Briggs\u2019s flesh.</p><p>Father. Briggs curled his lips.</p><p>Among purebloods, the pack superseded any family connection. Cubs were kept in the same lair and fiercely protected by all the adults. The concept of two parents and siblings was a human tradition.</p><p>Briggs, however, had barely been out of puberty when the king had taken him aside to claim him as his son and heir.</p><p>At the time he\u2019d been busting with pride. He\u2019d suspected even as a cub that he was destined for greatness.</p><p>It was only after the birth of Salvatore and his father\u2019s growing madness that he realized he would have to take matters into his own hands.</p><p>Even if it meant bartering his soul.</p><p>\u201cI have done all you requested.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd did I request that you interfere with Giuliani?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wanted him close at hand, as the time of your return draws near. I merely sought to prevent his escape.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiar.\u201d The icy power washed over Briggs, bringing with it the sensation of being flayed. \u201cIt was your over-weening pride that led to your attack, even after I specifically commanded that you keep your presence hidden. You were famished for the opportunity to prove your worth against the King of Weres.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCaine had already revealed my miraculous return from the dead.\u201d He readily dumped the blame on his pet cur. Shit was intended to roll downhill. \u201cGiuliani needs to be contained before he can start sticking his nose where it doesn\u2019t belong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will decide what needs to be done. And the first order of business is reminding you that your continued existence is entirely at my mercy. And in this moment, I am not feeling particularly merciful.\u201d</p><p>Briggs didn\u2019t have to fake his shudder of agony. \u201cForgive me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI forgive nothing,\u201d the voice hissed. \u201cI have waited for centuries to be released from this hellhole. I will destroy you before I allow you to threaten my destiny.\u201d</p><p>It was a threat that Briggs accepted as gospel. Unlike his dear departed father, he\u2019d never been stupid enough to assume he was anything but expendable to this powerful demon lord.</p><p>\u201cYes, master.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will stay away from Giuliani until I give you the order to bring him to me. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s a mistake to...\u201d</p><p>His words cut off as the chamber shook, the shower of stones from the ceiling pelting him on the head.</p><p>\u201cYou dare question me?\u201d</p><p>Briggs swallowed the bile that rose in his throat. He\u2019d died once. It was an experience he didn\u2019t intend to repeat.</p><p>On the other hand, he wasn\u2019t about to allow Salvatore to steal his glory when he was so close to success.</p><p>\u201cPlease. You must allow me to speak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMust?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Giuliani,\u201d Briggs rasped, his head pressed to the cold stone floor as the crippling pain threatened to consume him. \u201cHe\u2019s a danger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat danger?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s begun the mating ritual.\u201d</p><p>The frigid pressure abruptly disappeared, as if Briggs had managed to truly shock the demon lord.</p><p>A relief to be rid of the pain, but not particularly reassuring.</p><p>Briggs had bet everything on the mysterious demon lord who promised him the throne that had been stolen by Salvatore. The damned creature should already have sensed trouble.</p><p>\u201cImpossible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cImpossible or not, he\u2019s returning power to the Weres.\u201d</p><p>The town proved to be typical for the Midwest.</p><p>Settled on the Mississippi River, it was a combination of small businesses, fast-food restaurants, and chain stores along Broadway Street, while the traditional main drag was lined with historic homes that were battling the passage of time with varying degrees of success.</p><p>After swinging through Arby\u2019s to buy enough roast beef sandwiches and fried mozzarella sticks to feed a football team plus the cheerleading squad\u2014even supposing cheerleaders would come within a mile of a fried mozzarella stick\u2014Tonya drove them to the waterfront, stopping the Mercedes behind a small brick building with a green awning painted with the words TEAS AND CAKES.</p><p>Harley briefly caught a glimpse of small tables with frilly doilies and a front counter with a glass case of pastries. There was a mass of humans stuffed into the small space, with a line out the front door, their expressions tense as they waited to feed their unwitting addiction.</p><p>A powerful hex, indeed.</p><p>With a grimace, Harley followed Tonya into the attached warehouse that looked in dire need of some kindling and a match to put it out of its misery. There was a faint tingle as they entered the back door, and Harley\u2019s eyes widened as she took in the vast lobby decorated in a neoclassical style, with inlaid wood floors and pale green walls with silver engravings. The ceiling was painted with Apollo on his chariot dashing through the clouds, and the handful of chairs were hand-carved.</p><p>All extremely elegant and amazingly tasteful.</p><p>Belatedly, she realized the warehouse had been wrapped in an enchantment that magically projected an image of shabby abandonment. No doubt it also held an aversion spell that would keep humans from entering.</p><p>From the lobby, she and Salvatore had been led to private apartments on the second floor of the warehouse. There were a few raised brows when she\u2019d insisted on separate rooms, but in a thankfully short amount of time she was locked in a bathroom with a lot of black marble and gilt to shower away the hardened mud.</p><p>Returning to the attached bedroom, she found a pair of jeans and a turquoise tank top waiting for her on the black-and-gold comforter spread over the jumbo-sized bed. There was also a new set of panties and matching bra, as well as a pair of running shoes.</p><p>Yow, vampire hospitality was obviously full service. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The only question was what they charged for that service.</p><p>Once dressed, she pulled her damp hair into a ponytail and headed back toward the lobby. She hesitated at the bottom of the sweeping staircase, surprised to discover several large demons entering through a side door and heading directly toward the back of the lobby.</p><p>She instinctively shifted so she was hidden behind the elegantly carved banister, keeping a careful eye on the dangerous crowd.</p> <p>Night had obviously fallen since several of the demons possessed the unearthly beauty of vampires, and at least one was an Ichari demon, a species that remained immobile during the day.</p><p>The others...</p><p>She didn\u2019t have a clue. There were some with horns, some with extra appendages, some with wings and razor-sharp teeth. The only thing they had in common was the unmistakable aura of being predators.</p><p>Not really in the mood to rub elbows with the motley crew, Harley headed in the opposite direction, opening a door set in an alcove to discover what appeared to be a private office.</p><p>Crossing the slate gray carpet, she avoided the heavy walnut desk and wooden shelves that held the sort of high-tech surveillance equipment that would make the CIA salivate. Instead she concentrated on the French Impressionist paintings that were hung on the paneled walls and carefully preserved behind glass cases.</p> <p>Good Lord. They were breathtaking, but surely they should have been in a museum?</p><p>\u201cSo the rumors are true.\u201d</p><p>Harley slowly turned, not surprised to discover the exquisitely handsome vampire with long raven hair and distinctly Spanish features leaning against the doorjamb, studying her with a faint smile. She\u2019d already sensed his approach.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid to ask,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be.\u201d Pushing from the door, he slowly moved to stand directly before her. Dressed in a black silk suit and charcoal tie, he filled the room with his cold power. \u201cYou are as beautiful as your sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know my sister?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI am Santiago, and it is my honor to call Darcy my queen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cQueen.\u201d She gave a shake of her head. \u201cUnbelievable.\u201d</p><p>The vampire lifted his brows. \u201cIt troubles you that she is mated to a vampire?\u201d</p><p>Harley\u2019s lips twisted. She wouldn\u2019t have been troubled to discover her sisters were mated to tree frogs.</p><p>\u201cNo. I was told that my sisters were murdered. I\u2019m still wrapping my head around the fact they\u2019re alive and kicking.\u201d</p><p>There was a hint of rueful humor in the dark eyes. \u201cDarcy is very much alive and quite happy to do whatever kicking necessary to keep Styx in line.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd she\u2019s happy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d His gaze deliberately lowered to appreciate the curves revealed by the tank top. \u201cVampires possess an extensive knowledge of how to please a woman.\u201d</p> <p>Oh, she didn\u2019t doubt that for a moment.</p><p>Everything about the beautiful demons screamed pleasure.</p><p>A pity her taste ran to aggravating, arrogant, outrageously sexy Weres.</p><p>\u201cExtensive, eh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExtensive and...\u201d His smile revealed a flash of pearly white fangs. \u201cCreative.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd oh-so-dead if you take one step closer, Santiago,\u201d Salvatore drawled, stepping into the room and allowing his heat to blast through the air.</p><p>Harley wisely stepped away from the vampire as she turned to appreciate the sight of Salvatore freshly showered and wearing a pair of silky black pants and a sheer white shirt that had been left open to reveal his smooth, bronzed chest.</p><p>If there was going to be a fight, she didn\u2019t intend to be in the middle of it.</p><p>Santiago offered a mocking bow. \u201cGiuliani.\u201d</p><p>Strolling forward, Salvatore deliberately halted at her side, his hand possessively cupping the back of her neck. The male equivalent of \u201cShe\u2019s mine, back off.\u201d</p><p>Harley might have been furious if he wasn\u2019t looking so frigging gorgeous, with his hair pulled back with a gold clasp, emphasizing the stark beauty of his face.</p><p>And that scent...</p><p>Warm with a smoky musk that was driving her insane.</p><p>Easily sensing her jolt of awareness, Salvatore rubbed his thumb along the side of her neck, his gaze remaining on the vampire.</p><p>\u201cHave you contacted Styx?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI informed him that Tonya discovered you and the lovely Harley, and that you were on your way to the club,\u201d Santiago said. \u201cHe\u2019ll be heading here now that sun has set.\u201d</p><p>Harley frowned. \u201cWhy is he coming here? I thought you were going to Chicago?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot without back up.\u201d Salvatore grimaced. \u201cI assume he\u2019s bringing the crow pack with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCrow pack?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis Ravens,\u201d Santiago hissed, the dark eyes cold with disapproval. \u201cThey are the Anasso\u2019s personal guard and worthy of proper respect.\u201d</p><p>Salvatore shrugged. \u201cHow long will it take them to arrive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFour, perhaps five hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your security?\u201d</p><p>The vampire waved a hand toward the shelves of equipment. \u201cBeyond the enchantments placed on the building, I have everything wired and fully monitored. There are also four guards on duty at all times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo werewolves?\u201d</p><p>Santiago\u2019s lips curled. \u201cI don\u2019t trust dogs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe feeling is entirely mutual, leech.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot to mention the fact they shed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter than being a walking corpse.\u201d</p><p>Danger prickled in the air and Harley took a sharp step away from both males, her hands planted on her hips.</p><p>\u201cEither the testosterone level in this room is taken down a notch or I\u2019m going to show you both what bad things happen when estrogen is let off the leash.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Eleven</p><p>Salvatore\u2019s lips twitched as he met Harley\u2019s warning gaze, his blood stirring. Damn, but she was hot.</p><p>\u201cI heard female Weres were more dangerous than the males,\u201d Santiago murmured.</p><p>Salvatore nodded. \u201cYou should be near one during the full moon.\u201d</p><p>The hazel eyes glowed with a rising fury. \u201cDo you two want some privacy so you can enjoy your budding bromance?\u201d</p><p>Santiago chuckled, heading toward the door. \u201cI need to check on the staff before the doors open. So long as you stay in the building, you should be safe. There is food in the kitchen and drinks at the bar. The entertainment starts in an hour.\u201d</p><p>The vampire disappeared, closing the door behind him.</p><p>\u201cEntertainment?\u201d Harley asked, her eyes abruptly widening as Salvatore roughly backed her against the wall and pressed his body against her. \u201cWhat the hell?\u201d</p><p>Grasping her hands, Salvatore held them over her head, his erection cradled against her stomach.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so damned sexy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that gives you the right to jump me like a...\u201d</p><p>\u201cA dog in heat?\u201d he finished for her, burying his face in the curve of her neck.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am a dog in heat.\u201d</p><p>She shivered, the scent of her arousal spicing the air. \u201cYou\u2019re also a king. Shouldn\u2019t you at least make an effort to be civilized?\u201d</p><p>He chuckled, his lips exploring the line of her shoulder. She smelled of soap and woman and smoldering desire.</p><p>\u201cYou still have your clothes on, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>She stirred beneath him, her heat wrapping around him. \u201cSalvatore, I\u2019m not going to have sex with you in a room where anyone might walk in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen come to my room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way.\u201d</p><p>His lips followed the plunging line of her tank top, lingering on the gentle swell of her breast.</p><p>\u201cYour room then.\u201d</p><p>She tried to swallow her groan of pleasure. \u201cNo...way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, there are ways,\u201d he promised in low, rough tones. \u201cAn endless number of ways. We\u2019ve already proven that with stunning results. All we need is a place.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head in denial, but her nipples hardened with unspoken invitation.</p><p>\u201cGet over yourself, Giuliani.\u201d</p><p>Pulling back, he studied her with a brooding gaze. He could hear the rapid beat of her heart, the rasp of her breath.</p><p>\u201cHarley, your senses are as sensitive as mine. This mutual desire is one thing we can never hide from one another.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWanting and doing are two completely different things.\u201d</p><p>He pressed his erection against the curve of her stomach. \u201cI\u2019m painfully aware of the distinction, cara.\u201d</p><p>For a blissful moment, Harley softened against him, her eyes fluttering shut as the persistent need pulsed between them. Unfortunately, he didn\u2019t have time to get her naked before she was roughly shoving him away, crossing the room to stand near the door.</p><p>\u201cTell me what the zombie Were said to you,\u201d she demanded.</p><p>Salvatore groaned, turning to lean against the wall as his body screamed with frustration.</p><p>\u201cZombie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cZombie. Freak.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cTaxidermist wet dream.\u201d</p><p>With a grudging effort, Salvatore wrenched his thoughts away from seducing his mate and dredged up his encounter with Briggs. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Better than a cold shower.</p><p>\u201cNothing that made any sense,\u201d he rasped.</p><p>\u201cFlaming psychopaths rarely make sense.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTrue enough.\u201d</p><p>She tilted her head to the side, all too easily sensing the gnawing unease that plagued him.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something bothering you. What is it?\u201d</p><p>Salvatore stiffened, battling the instinct to retreat from her probing. Harley wasn\u2019t a casual lay to be ignored unless she was in his bed. She was the woman destined to rule at his side.</p><p>\u201cHe claims that he possesses the power to restore children to the Were.\u201d</p> <p>There was a startled silence as Harley absorbed the significance of his words.</p><p>\u201cEasy to claim,\u201d she at last said. \u201cDoes he have any proof?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is all to be revealed when the timing is right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like a bunch of mumbo jumbo crap to me. Remarkably like the bull that Caine is always spouting.\u201d</p><p>Salvatore toyed absently with his heavy signet ring, an unpleasant knot in the pit of his stomach.</p><p>\u201cThey do drink from the same glass of Kool-Aid.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo why are you letting him get under your skin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUntil I know the source of his power, I can\u2019t fathom what he\u2019s capable of. There\u2019s no doubt he\u2019s convinced himself that he\u2019s the true King of Weres.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he was the true king, wouldn\u2019t he be sitting on the throne?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I always believed.\u201d</p><p>With a scowl, she crossed the carpet to stand directly before him, as if afraid he might be oblivious to her annoyance unless they were nose to nose.</p><p>\u201cAre you listening to yourself? You\u2019re letting that rotting POS screw with your head.\u201d</p><p>Salvatore arched a brow, startled by her fierce reaction. Was it because she was terrified of Briggs? Or was it more personal?</p><p>Cristo, he wanted it to be personal.</p> <p>Intimately, deeply personal.</p><p>Naked wouldn\u2019t hurt, either.</p><p>Unable to resist temptation, he reached to grab her hand. The mating had stolen a measure of his strength, but touching her offered something just as important.</p><p>Peace.</p><p>An all too rare sensation in his life.</p><p>\u201cHe has raised questions that need to be answered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat questions?\u201d</p><p>Salvatore led Harley to the wide leather sofa set across the room from the desk. Settling on the cushions, he tugged her down beside him.</p><p>A part of him was restless, in need of being on the hunt for Briggs and the bastard who was pumping him full of black magic. It was a part easily overwhelmed by his savage need to protect this woman.</p><p>Until he knew that Harley was safely in the hands of Styx and his Ravens, he wasn\u2019t about to leave her side.</p><p>\u201cWhether or not the previous king was involved with the same demon who is controlling Briggs.\u201d</p><p>She shifted uneasily, but didn\u2019t pull away. Progress.</p><p>\u201cIs that what the Were told you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you believe him?\u201d</p><p>Salvatore grimaced. \u201cI don\u2019t want to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut?\u201d</p><p>He lifted his free hand to rub the muscles of his aching neck. \u201cBut I can\u2019t ignore the memory of Mackenzie\u2019s peculiar behavior the last century of his life.\u201d</p><p>She flashed a dry smile. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have to be more specific. I assumed being peculiar was a prerequisite of kinghood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery amusing.\u201d</p><p>Her smile faded. \u201cDid you suspect anything at the time?\u201d</p><p>Did he?</p><p>Salvatore didn\u2019t have a ready answer.</p><p>In many ways, the past had been lost in shadows. After becoming king he had too many troubles to look back. The future consumed his every thought.</p><p>Now it was difficult to dredge up the memories without shading them with his growing suspicions.</p><p>\u201cHe was secretive. Short-tempered. Dangerously unstable,\u201d he admitted, recalling his resentment as Mackenzie increasingly ignored his duties to the Weres and remained alone in his lair. \u201cI thought he was battling the Telos.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>He considered his words. \u201cLike all immortals, Weres are vulnerable to the punishment of time,\u201d he at last said. \u201cEndless days that become decades and centuries and millennia. Despair can be as destructive as any illness.\u201d</p><p>The hazel eyes darkened, perhaps for the first time comprehending that immortality had a cost.</p><p>\u201cWhat happens?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s different for each individual.\u201d He stroked his thumb over her knuckles, comforted by the feel of her satin skin. It was said that Weres who found a true mate never endured the Telos. \u201cMost complain of a numbing apathy or a lurking darkness they can\u2019t escape. Eventually they call on the Vekpos, a mystical fire that will consume a pureblood from the inside out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYikes.\u201d Harley grimaced. \u201cWe can\u2019t do it by accident, can we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. A Were must be in the throes of the Telos for the power to emerge, and it\u2019s a very rare occurrence. Most Weres are too violent not to die in battle long before the threat of ennui can consume them.\u201d</p><p>She choked back a laugh. \u201cFantastic. I\u2019m completely reassured.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou asked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe previous king had this...\u201d She stumbled over the unfamiliar word. \u201cTelos?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, turning to absently study the pastel paintings hung on the wall.</p><p>\u201cThat was my assumption. And when his ashes were discovered in his lair, it simply confirmed my theory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds fairly cut-and-dry,\u201d she pointed out. \u201cJust because Briggs made some wild accusations doesn\u2019t make them true.\u201d</p><p>Intellectually, Salvatore agreed.</p><p>Briggs had been an accomplished liar long before he\u2019d ever traded his soul for power. Hell, he\u2019d nearly convinced the Roman werewolf pack to return to the ancient tradition of sacrificing humans to appease the Were gods before Salvatore had stepped in and halted the nonsense.</p><p>His instinct, however, refused to dismiss the wild claim.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t afford to overlook any possibility.</p><p>God knew his blind assumptions had already led to near disaster.</p><p>\u201cNo, but even at the time I knew that the Telos didn\u2019t completely explain Mackenzie\u2019s furtive habits,\u201d his voice thickened with self-disgust. Maybe if he hadn\u2019t ignored the vague doubts about Mackenzie all those centuries ago, he could have stopped Briggs before he managed to acquire his black powers. Then he gave a shake of his head. There was no going back, only forward. \u201cThose who are committed to death devote their last years performing small rituals to easing the grief of those they\u2019ll leave behind.\u201d</p><p>She squeezed his hand, as if sensing his inner torment. \u201cWhat sort of rituals?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey give away their belongings, they travel to visit the burial grounds of their ancestors, they surround themselves with the pack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrim, but understandable, I suppose.\u201d She wrinkled her nose. \u201cWhat did Mackenzie do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe hid in his lair, refusing my pleas to return to his throne, even as the Were packs fractured and turned on each other.\u201d</p><p>She considered his explanation a long moment, then astonishingly, cut straight to the heart of the matter.</p><p>\u201cDid the Weres begin losing their powers beneath the previous king?\u201d</p><p>Salvatore surged to his feet, hating the knowledge that he was stumbling through the dark, constantly one step behind.</p><p>Dio. The fate of the Weres depended on him.</p><p>If he failed, they all failed.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to pinpoint an exact moment or even decade, but it was whispered that the decline started shortly after Mackenzie\u2019s reign began.\u201d His wolf prowled just below his skin, needing a tangible enemy to rip into shreds. \u201cMaybe he sensed the encroaching weakness and turned to desperate measures.\u201d</p><p>Harley crossed to his side, her brow furrowed. \u201cOr maybe he used the black magic to become king, and that started the troubles.\u201d</p><p>Salvatore gritted his teeth, wanting to deny that any king would be willing to put his own ambitions ahead of the good of his people, but the lies wouldn\u2019t pass his lips.</p><p>Magic couldn\u2019t force the throne to accept a Were as king, but a corrupt Were could certainly use it to clear the field of contenders.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s possible that Mackenzie used black magic to dispose of the true heirs ahead of him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d Her eyes widened, as she was struck by a sudden thought. \u201cIf he sold his soul to the devil, why wasn\u2019t he offered the Lazarus treatment that Briggs got?\u201d</p><p>Salvatore shrugged. \u201cMaybe Briggs made a pact with the same devil to make certain Mackenzie couldn\u2019t rise again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHonor among thieves, and all that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBriggs is desperate for the throne.\u201d</p><p>Harley shuddered, wrapping her arms around her waist. Salvatore didn\u2019t blame her. Briggs was shudder-worthy.</p><p>\u201cSo how does Caine fit into all this?\u201d</p><p>Salvatore felt another pang of self-disgust. He\u2019d been following Brigg\u2019s false trails for years. Like a particularly stupid hound hunting the chickens and allowing the fox to escape his notice. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cA distraction,\u201d he gritted.</p><p>She snorted. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t much of a distraction considering he spent most of his time cowering in his various lairs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, you and your sisters were the true distractions,\u201d he corrected. \u201cBriggs knew that I would follow your trail anywhere in the world, and that I wouldn\u2019t rest until I\u2019d found you.\u201d He scanned her beautiful face, his heart whispering it was worth every sacrifice to have at last discovered his mate, while his sense of duty rebelled at having endangered his people. \u201cBy dividing the four of you into different locations and constantly keeping on the move, he did a bang-up job of making sure I wasted my time chasing my own tail.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDistract you from what?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>His lips twisted as Harley once again pounced on the most significant point.</p><p>He would be a fool to ever try to deceive this woman.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he admitted.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you suspect?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI think I was lured from Italy to America for a very specific purpose.\u201d He lifted a hand as her lips parted with the inevitable question. \u201cAnd before you ask, I don\u2019t have a clue what the purpose might be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInconvenient.\u201d</p><p>His humorless laugh echoed through the room at her stunning understatement.</p><p>\u201cA little more than inconvenient.\u201d He shook his head, resuming his impatient pacing. Tonight he felt every one of his numerous years. \u201cCristo, for all I know, I\u2019m completely wrong about everything. In the past I\u2019ve blamed the troubles of the Weres on the gods, on the changing societies, and even on the vampires. Perhaps I\u2019m seeking another evil force to accuse so I don\u2019t have to admit that my people are destined for extinction.\u201d</p><p>Silence filled the room, the distant din of Santiago\u2019s unruly guests thankfully muffled by the heavy door.</p><p>At last Salvatore halted his pacing. He could sense Harley standing just behind him. She hadn\u2019t tried to slip away while he was distracted. And so far she hadn\u2019t stuck anything in the middle of his back.</p> <p>Which meant she was thinking.</p><p>A dangerous activity.</p><p>Turning, he met her guarded gaze.</p><p>\u201cHarley?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf there\u2019s even a possibility you might be right, then shouldn\u2019t you be returning to Italy?\u201d</p><p>He was caught off guard by her abrupt words. \u201cTrying to get rid of me, cara?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be Ken Jennings to figure out that if the bad guy wants you here, you should be there.\u201d</p><p>Was she concerned for his safety?</p> <p>Dio, the sky was surely about to fall.</p><p>Salvatore prowled forward, his blood heating as she instinctively backed away. He maneuvered her until her ass was pressed against the edge of the desk, caging her legs between his thighs.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll eventually return to my lair in Rome,\u201d he promised her, satisfaction gripping his heart at the thought of Harley in his classically elegant home. She would add a golden warmth that was badly needed amongst the acres of marble and gilt. \u201cBut not until I\u2019ve dealt with Briggs and whatever demon is pulling his strings.\u201d</p><p>Her hands landed against his chest. \u201cVery macho.\u201d</p><p>He claimed her lips in a kiss of sheer possession. \u201cI can be a lot more macho, if only you\u2019d let me,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cStop that.\u201d She arched back to stab him with a worried gaze. \u201cI\u2019m being serious. You\u2019re the king\u2014you should act like one.\u201d</p><p>His gaze lowered to appreciate the tight stretch of her tank top. \u201cI\u2019m trying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSalvatore.\u201d</p><p>With a sigh, he lifted his gaze. \u201cWhat kingly act do you want from me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me what would happen if Briggs manages to kill you and take the Were throne?\u201d</p><p>His jaw clenched. \u201cNot going to happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnless you\u2019ve been covering up a special ability to read the future, you can\u2019t know that.\u201d Her expression was stern, unflinching. \u201cIs your pride worth risking the future of your people?\u201d</p><p>Salvatore met her unwavering gaze. He was a dominant. An alpha who didn\u2019t accept having his decisions questioned.</p><p>He\u2019d taught more than one Were that painful lesson.</p><p>But oddly, he didn\u2019t feel the familiar urge to snarl. Harley wasn\u2019t his subordinate. The wolf in him had accepted her as a mate. She was his partner, not one of his pack.</p><p>\u201cHarley, Briggs is too dangerous to ignore.\u201d His hands stroked up her bare arms to grasp her shoulders. \u201cI can\u2019t return to Italy until he\u2019s destroyed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have royal ass-kickers to take care of your killing for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny number, but none who would be immune to Briggs\u2019s ability to control their minds.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t dismiss his logic, but that didn\u2019t stop her from finding a new argument.</p><p>Women were women, regardless of their species.</p><p>\u201cSupposing you do manage to kill him...\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuch faith.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you intend to keep him dead?\u201d</p><p>Salvatore didn\u2019t have an answer.</p><p>And at the moment, he had far more important matters on his mind.</p><p>Framing her face in his hands, he lowered his head to brush searing kisses over her cheek.</p><p>\u201cA worry for tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twelve</p><p>Harley forgot how to breathe as Salvatore found her lips in a slow, drugging kiss.</p><p>No big surprise.</p><p>His touch was magic.</p><p>With a soft groan, his tongue teased her lips wider, his fingers stroking down her throat. It was Harley\u2019s turn to groan. He tasted of whiskey and wolf and wild power. A combination that ignited something untamed deep inside her soul.</p><p>A compelling, ruthless heat flowed through her blood, making her hands slip beneath the edge of his open shirt to find the satin steel of his chest.</p><p>Okay, she might be responsible for her hands doing the full-body search, but he was certainly responsible for shutting down her higher brain functions. If she\u2019d been thinking clearly, she would have shoved him across the room, not discovered the intimate terrain of his upper body.</p><p>His hands shifted to cup her aching breasts, his thumbs circling the rigid thrust of her nipples until she was squirming against him.</p><p>\u201cHarley...\u201d</p><p>His husky words were cut short as Salvatore abruptly lifted his head and glanced toward the door. Harley felt a prickle of energy and the heavy bolt slid shut just as she caught Santiago\u2019s approaching scent.</p><p>\u201cGo away,\u201d Salvatore barked, his muscles coiled and prepared for action.</p><p>There was a soft chuckle as Santiago halted near the door, but the vamp was smart enough not to try and enter the room.</p><p>Thank God.</p><p>\u201cThe entertainment is about to begin,\u201d he said, his voice deliciously cool and filled with invitation. \u201cI\u2019m certain Harley would enjoy our modest show.\u201d</p><p>A golden glow illuminated Salvatore\u2019s eyes, his rich, musky scent filling the room.</p><p>\u201cSantiago, \u2018go away\u2019 is a fairly simple command to understand. Of course, I could come out there and explain it to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI prefer you send Harley out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA leech with a death wish,\u201d Salvatore growled. \u201cMy favorite kind.\u201d</p><p>Harley heaved the universal sigh of a woman dealing with two stupid men.</p><p>\u201cIs this really necessary?\u201d</p><p>Salvatore flashed a wickedly infectious grin. \u201cNo, but it\u2019s always fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarley, if you are able to slip from your furry leash, feel free to join me. Drinks...\u201d Santiago deliberately paused. \u201cAnd whatever else you might desire, are on the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll keep your offer in mind, Santiago,\u201d Harley said, her gaze warning Salvatore to keep his mouth shut. She wasn\u2019t in the mood for a pissing match. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy pleasure.\u201d</p><p>Salvatore\u2019s tension eased as Santiago\u2019s scent faded. \u201cI hate vamps. Now...\u201d His fingers lightly traced the line of her tank top, the heat of his fingers singeing her skin with pleasure. \u201cWhere were we?\u201d</p><p>One step away from complete insanity, Harley abruptly realized.</p><p>Shoving her hands against his chest, Harley edged enough space to slip away from the desk and Salvatore\u2019s oh-my-God touch.</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s the entertainment that he\u2019s talking about?\u201d</p><p>Salvatore squeezed his eyes shut, as if in great pain. Then, sucking in a deep breath, he turned to lean against the desk, his arms folded over his chest.</p><p>\u201cHave you ever been to a demon nightclub?\u201d</p><p>She snorted at the ridiculous question. \u201cAre you kidding? Caine never let me go anywhere I might be seen by a Were. He told me it was for my safety. Jackass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I would suggest that your introduction to demon society wait.\u201d His brooding gaze slid down her body, not bothering to hide his hunger. \u201cViper\u2019s establishments are always over the top.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me guess\u2014you have your own entertainment in mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow that you mention it...\u201d</p><p>The golden eyes flared and the power of his desire smacked into her, nearly sending her to her knees. Holy crap. Her stomach clenched as the vivid image of Salvatore bending her over the desk and roughly taking her from behind seared through her mind. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She rushed toward the door. \u201cI want a drink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I get a veto?\u201d Salvatore muttered, then as Harley threw the bolt and yanked open the door, he hurried to her side, taking her arm in a possessive grip. \u201cDamn. Wait for me.\u201d</p><p>She shivered as he led her across the lobby, his mesmerizing, musky scent seeping into her skin as if attempting to brand her.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need for you to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust me, there\u2019s every need,\u201d he said in dark tones, his brows lifting as she unconsciously rubbed her prickling arms. \u201cIs something wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you put on cologne?\u201d</p><p>An oddly rueful smile curved his lips. \u201cDolce &amp; Gabbana.

Their faces were sculpted masterpieces of high cheekbones, hawkish noses, and noble brows. As she neared, she realized that they had a heavy band of kohl tattooed into their skin to emphasize their almond black eyes, and a hint of color on their full lips.</p> <p>As if their stunning beauty needed any artificial assistance.</p><p>They were mouthwatering enough in their teeny tiny loincloths that revealed the sort of bodies that must have made Cleopatra howl in appreciation.</p><p>As they neared, the two silently pulled open the heavy doors, their gazes lingering on Harley with silent invitations of sultry pleasure.</p><p>Salvatore swept her past the demons as if they were invisible, his profile hard as they started down the wide stone steps that led deep beneath the building.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure about this?\u201d he demanded, his hand tightening on her arm as the air thickened with the scent and sounds of the gathered crowd.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve lived with a pack of curs for thirty years. There\u2019s nothing that can shock me.\u201d Her unfounded bravado lasted until they reached the bottom of the steps and Salvatore shoved open yet another door, this one of steel, and the full force of the gathered demons hit her. \u201cOkay. I might have spoken a little hastily.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to leave?\u201d</p><p>Harley barely heard his question, her attention focused on the scene spread below her.</p> <p>In contrast to the airy elegance above, the vast room was circular and made of black marble that terraced downward. On each tier were a series of steel tables and stools that were bolted to the marble, and a series of staircases that led to the huge metal cage set in the lowest level of the chamber.</p><p>Overhead, heavy chandeliers spilled pools of light on the crowd of guests, battling back the shadows that twined along the edges, hiding those guests who preferred to remain concealed.</p><p>It looked more like Thunderdome than a nightclub.</p><p>Salvatore bent to speak directly in her ear, the clamor of the crowd nearly deafening.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to leave?\u201d</p><p>Her mouth was dry as her gaze skimmed over the demons of varying species. The only thing they had in common was the tangible sense of violence that crackled around them.</p><p>She briefly hesitated, torn between good old-fashioned common sense, and the desire to flirt with danger.</p><p>She\u2019d always wanted to discover the world outside Caine\u2019s lair, hadn\u2019t she? Well, here it was. In all its glory.</p><p>Or rather, its lack of glory.</p><p>\u201cNot on your life,\u201d she said, tilting her chin with a display of courage she was far from feeling.</p><p>\u201cIt just might be,\u201d Salvatore muttered, glaring at two hulking trolls who were eyeing Harley as if she were a tasty appetizer.</p><p>With a lift of his slender hand, a beautiful female imp with pale red hair and ivory curves on full display in a tiny spandex dress rushed to do his bidding. And if her smile was anything to go by, she was hoping his bidding included taking off that scrap of spandex.</p><p>Harley gritted her teeth, but Salvatore seemed oblivious to the woman\u2019s blatant invitation.</p><p>\u201cA booth,\u201d he commanded. \u201cAs far from the arena as possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d With a venomous glance toward Harley, the imp wound her way past the tables on the top tier, leading them to a shadowed alcove that held a small booth. Harley slid onto a steel bench seat and Salvatore settled opposite her, his gaze sweeping the crowd rather than focusing on the imp who had practically thrust her breasts beneath his nose. \u201cA drink, lover?\u201d</p><p>Harley cleared her throat. \u201cA Bloody Mary,\u201d she ordered, her tone warning that her drink wasn\u2019t going to be the only bloody thing if the bitch didn\u2019t back off.</p><p>As if sensing the sudden tension in the air, Salvatore studied her flushed face with a smug smile.</p><p>\u201cHennessy,\u201d he absently ordered.</p><p>With a flounce, the imp turned and stormed through the crowed, presumably headed to the bar for their drinks. Avidly aware of Salvatore\u2019s unwavering gaze, Harley settled back in her seat.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t Hennessy a little snobbish for a joint like this?\u201d</p><p>He reached to stroke his finger over the back of her hand that was lying on the table.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I say? I\u2019m a Were of discerning taste.\u201d</p><p>Her clever comeback died on her lips as spotlights abruptly flared across the ceiling and the milling crowd erupted into noisy cheers.</p><p>Glancing upward, Harley watched as four small golden cages were lowered from the hidden traps in the ceiling. They halted several feet over the large cage on the floor, dangling in the spotlights.</p><p>\u201cHoly crap,\u201d she breathed, allowing her gaze to shift from one cage to another. \u201cAre those imps?\u201d</p><p>Salvatore grimaced. \u201cThey\u2019re part of the show.\u201d</p><p>That wasn\u2019t reassuring considering the four imps, two male and two female, were completely naked except for the heavy steel collars around their necks.</p><p>\u201cJust what is this show?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe demon version of The Dating Game.\u201d</p><p>Harley shook her head. She was addicted to the Game Show Network, and she hadn\u2019t seen any show with naked imps hanging in cages.</p><p>\u201cSomehow I don\u2019t think the human version is even in the same universe. I assume there are a few rules?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRudimentary ones. You pay an exorbitant amount of money for the privilege of joining a dozen other demons in the pit.\u201d He pointed toward the huge cage on the floor that could accommodate an indoor soccer league. \u201cThe last demon standing is rewarded with a key.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKey?\u201d</p><p>His hand lifted toward the cages, each with a large lock that held the doors shut.</p><p>\u201cOnce the winner makes his or her choice, the next batch is herded into the pit for their chance at a key.\u201d</p><p>Outrage flowed through Harley like molten lava. For all of Caine\u2019s faults, he\u2019d always made certain that the males in his pack understood the penalty of rape.</p><p>Death.</p><p>Slow, tortuous, painful death.</p><p>\u201cThose are sex slaves?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Salvatore squeezed her fingers, anxious to keep her from doing something stupid. \u201cI\u2019ll admit that I wouldn\u2019t shed a tear if someone managed to plant a stake in Viper\u2019s unbeating heart, but he would never allow slaves in his club.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d</p><p>He leaned close and spoke low enough that not even the most talented demon could overhear him.</p><p>\u201cViper was held as a slave for centuries. He would slaughter anyone involved in the trade.\u201d</p><p>His reassurances were backed up by the sight of the imps, who happily leaned against the bars of their cages to provoke the crowd below into a near frenzy.</p><p>\u201cAnd you?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He chuckled as he lifted her hand to his lips, his tongue tracing the line of her knuckles.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need such crude methods. My charm is enough to enslave others.\u201d</p><p>She might debate his charm, but his touch was enough to make a woman beg for more.</p><p>\u201cAnd you call Caine delusional,\u201d she said, her words sounding lame as heat curled through the pit of her stomach.</p><p>Thankfully the imp chose that moment to return with their drinks, her barely covered boobs distracting Salvatore enough for Harley to jerk her hand free.</p><p>Not that it did a damned bit of good.</p><p>The excitement bubbled through her blood like the finest champagne, her skin crawling with a prickling awareness. She shifted uneasily in her seat, suddenly damp and aching.</p><p>What the hell?</p><p>Waving away the persistent imp, Salvatore shot Harley a knowing smile, easily sensing her stirring hunger.</p><p>\u201cYou should at least enjoy the warm-up act.\u201d</p><p>Before she could ask, she caught sight of the naked men covered in nothing more than elaborate tattoos styled into Chinese symbols. They appeared to be human males\u2014except no human was so perfectly ripped no matter how often they worked out, and their skin didn\u2019t glow with an oddly metallic shimmer\u2014as they weaved a sensuous path through the tables.</p><p>\u201cFrigging hell.\u201d Harley drained her Bloody Mary as one of the demons halted in front of their table, performing an erotic dance that had to be illegal in some states. Unable to tear her gaze from the alien beauty of the aquiline features and black, slanted eyes, she struggled to breathe. \u201cWhat are they?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNozama demons,\u201d Salvatore said. \u201cIn their culture, the women are the warriors while the males are judged on their sexual prowess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow that is a fine culture,\u201d she approved in husky tones, clutching the edge of the table to keep her hands from straying where they didn\u2019t belong.</p><p>Salvatore growled low in his throat, sending the demon scurrying to the next table.</p><p>\u201cFemale warriors are respected in Were society, and our sexual prowess is renown throughout the demon world,\u201d he informed her, reaching to take her hand in a possessive grip.</p><p>\u201cAlmost as renowned as your arrogance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur arrogance,\u201d he corrected, leaning far enough across the table that his warm breath brushed her cheek. \u201cYou\u2019re a pureblood, Harley. It is past time you returned to your pack.\u201d</p><p>A sharp ache tugged at her heart. An unpleasant reminder of the loneliness that had plagued her all her life.</p><p>As a Were, she instinctively craved the connection to a pack. Not only for protection, but for the companionship that was as important to purebloods as food and sex.</p><p>There had always been a very large part of herself missing.</p><p>Still, she wasn\u2019t prepared to make commitments to anyone. Not Salvatore. Not her sisters.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll decide if or when I return to a pack,\u201d she warned.</p><p>Lifting her arm, Salvatore nuzzled the pulse hammering in her inner wrist.</p><p>\u201cI could make the decision an easy one if you would let me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot everyone is ruled by their hormones.\u201d</p><p>The golden eyes flashed with heat. \u201cAh, if only that were true.\u201d</p><p>Harley\u2019s lips parted as a blast of lust slammed into her.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t the persistent tug that was always present when Salvatore was near. Or the intense hunger that his kisses so easily roused.</p><p>This was a jarring, overwhelming need that felt unpleasantly like drowning.</p><p>\u201cGiuliani?\u201d she rasped.</p><p>\u201cRelax, cara.\u201d He gently massaged her hand.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe dancers release a pheromone. It helps encourage more participants to ante up for a turn in the pit.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCrap.\u201d She shifted on the hard bench, her skin coated in perspiration. \u201cI\u2019m about ready to ante up myself.\u201d</p><p>Without warning, Salvatore surged to his feet, pulling her off the bench and against his hard body.</p><p>\u201cNo need to fight, cara,\u201d he husked. \u201cUnless that turns you on.\u201d</p><p>In this moment, everything was turning Harley on.</p><p>The feel of Salvatore\u2019s hard body, his frigging delicious musky scent, the pulse of his outrageous power...</p><p>Without warning, a hand descended on her shoulder, yanking her around to discover a large Pecoste demon leering at her with yellow eyes, his tusks dripping with venom.</p><p>Salvatore instantly bared his teeth, his eyes blazing with the eerie glow of a werewolf a breath away from shifting.</p><p>\u201cRemove your hand before I...\u201d</p><p>Harley didn\u2019t wait for the two males to enjoy banging on their chests and blowing a lot of hot air.</p><p>With one smooth motion, she kicked the Pecoste demon in the knee, waiting for him to instinctively bend over before she connected her fist with his chin. The demon flew backwards, landing on a table two tiers down. There was a snarl of anger from the demons below and a savage brawl broke out, but Harley didn\u2019t wait to appreciate her handiwork.</p><p>Instead she wiped her hands on her jeans and met Salvatore\u2019s amused gaze.</p><p>\u201cWhen I need rescuing, I\u2019ll let you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll keep that in mind.\u201d</p><p>The scuffle had been fun, but the aching lust was still curling through her body. God Almighty. If she didn\u2019t have relief soon, she might just explode.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen enough,\u201d she muttered, heading for the exit as she wiped the sweat from her brow.</p><p>Not surprisingly Salvatore was swiftly at her side. \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy room.\u201d</p><p>They waded through the crowd in silence, at last reaching the door and climbing the stairs. With every step, the clinging pheromones lessened, easing the choking desire, but Harley\u2019s pace never slowed. The artificial lust might be dismissed by a change of location, but the restless hunger that continued to plague her would not be so easily banished.</p><p>She didn\u2019t know what the future held, but she knew that Salvatore wouldn\u2019t wait much longer to go after Briggs. The next few hours might be their last together.</p><p>Bypassing the lobby, Harley headed straight for her room on the upper floor, pulling her key card from her pocket and throwing open the door. Then, before she could remind herself of all the reasons why this was such a bad idea, she grabbed Salvatore\u2019s arm and tugged him into the room, slamming the door behind him.</p><p>Salvatore lifted his brows in wary surprise. \u201cHarley?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t this what you wanted?\u201d she demanded, pushing him against the wall and running her hands over the hard planes of his chest.</p><p>Without warning, Salvatore grasped her wrists, halting her impatient caresses.</p><p>\u201cWait, cara.\u201d</p><p>Her gut twisted with frustration. \u201cAre you kidding me?\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed. \u201cI won\u2019t be accused of taking advantage of you while you\u2019re under the influence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d She leaned forward, licking a line from his sternum to the hollow of his neck. \u201cThen I\u2019ll take advantage of you.\u201d</p><p>He shuddered, his heat flaring through the room with the force of a nuclear blast.</p><p>\u201cWorks for me,\u201d he rasped, loosening her wrists so he could pull out the scrunchie holding her hair, ramming his fingers through the thick strands. Harley wasted no time as she grasped the silk of his shirt and ripped it off him. Salvatore laughed with smug pleasure. \u201cDio. Remind me to triple my clothing allowance.\u201d</p><p>Harley tilted back her head to meet the golden gaze half-shielded beneath his thick lashes.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be making plans that include me, Giuliani. This is...\u201d</p><p>\u201cExtraordinary,\u201d he interrupted, his hands grasping her hips and jerking her against his rigid cock.</p><p>\u201cA temporary madness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll agree to the madness part.\u201d He grabbed the bottom of her tank top, pulled it over her head, and tossed it to the floor. Her bra was next, leaving her breasts bare for his intimate exploration. \u201cMind-blowing, heart-stopping madness.\u201d</p><p>She groaned as his thumbs found her hardened nipples, his head lowering to capture her lips in a kiss that demanded utter surrender.</p><p>He tasted of aged cognac, his tongue tangling with hers as his fingers tugged at the tips of her breasts, sending jolts of raw pleasure to the pit of her stomach. Harley widened her lips beneath his savage demand, her hands fumbling with the leather belt.</p><p>A wildfire was racing through her, and she was eager to be consumed by the flames.</p><p>Having dealt with the belt buckle, Harley tugged open the button of his slacks and slid down the zipper, her heart slamming against her chest as her fingers circled his heavy arousal.</p><p>Salvatore muttered a low curse, his hips surging forward as a sheen of sweat coated his beautiful face.</p><p>\u201cCareful, cara,\u201d he gritted. \u201cI\u2019m trying to remember to be gentle.\u201d</p><p>In answer, Harley balanced on her tiptoes, biting the side of his neck with enough force to draw blood.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not afraid of the big bad wolf.\u201d</p><p>With a muted roar, Salvatore was spinning to the side, slamming her into the wall as he dropped to his knees in front of her.</p><p>\u201cYou should be,\u201d he warned, his hands ripping off her jeans, and the tiny triangle of lace beneath.</p><p>\u201cSalvatore...\u201d</p><p>Her breath stuck in her throat as his lips trailed a searing path up the inside of her thighs, while his hands firmly tugged her legs farther apart.</p><p>Her fingers dug into his hair, a shudder of sheer delight shaking through her.</p><p>\u201cOh...Lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too late for prayers,\u201d he muttered, giving her legs one last tug so he could find the damp heat he was searching for.</p><p>Harley swallowed her scream, her body quivering with erotic approval. She liked having Salvatore on his knees, making love to her with his tongue and teeth.</p><p>Her eyes slid closed, her hands stroking through his hair as a sweet tension coiled deep in her womb. She briefly remembered that there had been some insane reason that she wanted to avoid Salvatore\u2019s magical touch, but in this moment, she didn\u2019t give a crap.</p><p>Over and over his tongue teased her clitoris, occasionally thrusting into her opening with a skill that had her charging full steam toward her climax.</p><p>Measuring her quickening pants, Salvatore abruptly straightened, kicking off his shoes and slacks to stand before her in his full glory.</p><p>And he was glorious.</p><p>His lean, perfect features. His luminous golden eyes. His chiseled, bronzed body. His cock, fully erect and eager to please.</p><p>Allowing her a few moments to appreciate the sight of his naked body, Salvatore grasped her by the waist and turned her away from him.</p><p>\u201cPut your hands on the wall and keep your arms stiff,\u201d he rasped in her ear, tugging her leg up and over his thigh, leaving her feeling oddly vulnerable. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Caught off guard, Harley glanced over her shoulder in confusion, her heart jerking at the stark beauty of his bronzed face.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust me,\u201d he said, his hand gripping her inner thigh at the same moment his erection nudged at her slit from behind.</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Her head fell back against his shoulder, her neck boneless with blistering pleasure as he surged inside her. He was large and angled to thrust deep, each driving plunge hovering between intense bliss and pain.</p><p>Leaning heavily against the wall to support her weak knees, Harley groaned as his fingers slid between her folds, stroking through her damp heat in pace with the fierce, relentless pump of his hips.</p><p>Somewhere in the dark, a pack of curs was searching for them, Briggs was plotting his evil, and the King of Vampires was rushing in their direction. But the dangers held no meaning for Harley as her body tightened with a near unbearable excitement.</p><p>With a growl that was more animal than human, Salvatore buried his face in the curve of her neck, his mouth nuzzling her sensitive skin.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re mine,\u201d he said, his low words seeming to brand themselves on her soul. \u201cFor now and all eternity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Harley.\u201d He thrust deeper, possessing her with every stroke. \u201cThere\u2019s no going back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDammit, Salvatore...\u201d</p><p>Her words were cut short as Salvatore sank his teeth into the base of her neck.

She might be willing to use her magical abilities to impress him, but not if it meant bringing any danger to herself.</p><p>Without Caine driving them on, they\u2019d quite likely dillydally long enough to make certain that Salvatore managed to escape.</p><p>At the moment, however, Caine was too distracted to launch an all-out offensive against the King of Weres.</p><p>He needed time to sort through the doubts that were beginning to plague him.</p><p>Predictably, what he needed and what he got were two very different things.</p> <p>Skimming down the graveled back roads that wound through recently plowed fields, Caine slammed on the brakes as the familiar scent of rotting flesh assaulted him.</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d</p><p>Andre shoved his dark hair from his face, his nose wrinkled with disgust.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCompany,\u201d Caine muttered, wishing he had the balls to ignore the unmistakable summons. Of course, if he ignored the summons there was a good chance he wouldn\u2019t have any balls to worry about.</p><p>\u201cCompany?\u201d Andre shuddered. \u201cIt smells like he needs to lay down so someone can finish burying him.\u201d</p><p>Caine shoved the stick shift into park. \u201cStay here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You...\u201d</p><p>Caine\u2019s hand shot out to grab his companion by the throat. \u201cStay. Here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot it,\u201d the cur rasped. \u201cStay here.\u201d</p><p>Ignoring the bile that rose in his throat, Caine headed for the small cluster of trees. This was what he\u2019d signed up for, wasn\u2019t it? A little tit for a little tat.</p><p>He just wanted to get his damned tit so he could be done with the nasty tat.</p><p>There was an odd shimmer among the shadows, then the outline of Briggs appeared, his crimson eyes glowing like the pits of hell. Obediently, Caine fell to his knees.</p><p>\u201cMaster.\u201d</p><p>A blast of cold swirled through the air, crawling over Caine\u2019s skin.</p><p>\u201cScurrying back to your lair like the spineless coward you are, eh, Caine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have my pack searching for Salvatore. It\u2019s only a matter of time before they capture him.\u201d The lies tripped easily off Caine\u2019s tongue, his head lowered to hide his wary expression. \u201cI need to make sure I have a cell prepared that can hold him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need. Our plans have changed.\u201d</p><p>Caine stiffened. A change in plan usually meant the first plan had gone to hell. Not what he wanted to hear.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCongratulations, cur,\u201d Briggs hissed. \u201cYour day of glory is at hand. Soon you will be transformed, as you always dreamed.\u201d</p><p>Caine slowly lifted his head, suspicious. Briggs had always been far too vague on how this transformation was supposed to take place.</p><p>\u201cHow? Harley has escaped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cForget the bitch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...\u201d</p><p>The crimson eyes flared with lethal anger. \u201cI must have Salvatore.\u201d</p><p>Caine swallowed his demand to know the hows, whens, and wheres of the mystical transformation that had been promised to him for years.</p><p>His personal vision had revealed his blood running over barren stone, shimmering with the power only true Weres possessed, but interpreting such a vision was always difficult.</p><p>\u201cMy pack is on his trail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSalvatore will destroy your pathetic excuse for a pack without breaking a sweat.\u201d</p><p>Caine ground his teeth. \u201cI\u2019m aware of Salvatore\u2019s superior strength.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you will pull back your servants and allow me to deal with the bastard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeal with him, or kill him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019ll kill him in due time.\u201d The Were\u2019s voice was thick with anticipation. \u201cFirst, I have need of him alive.\u201d</p><p>The memory of the violent battlefield he\u2019d left behind spoiled Caine\u2019s pleasure at savoring Salvatore\u2019s impending downfall. Briggs might boast about his plans for the King of Weres, but Caine was no longer willing to believe that Briggs was invincible.</p><p>\u201cYou intend to capture him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy yourself?\u201d</p><p>An icy power slammed into Caine\u2019s chest, stopping his heart.</p><p>\u201cSurely you don\u2019t doubt my ability to do so?\u201d</p><p>Caine\u2019s hands dug into the dirt, the pain radiating from his chest through his body in sharp bursts.</p><p>\u201cI would never be so foolish,\u201d he groaned.</p><p>\u201cI wonder.\u201d The repulsive smell nearly choked Caine as Briggs moved closer. \u201cCould it be that your loyalty is wavering, Caine?\u201d</p><p>Caine pressed his head to the ground. Damn. He\u2019d gone too far. Briggs wouldn\u2019t tolerate having his superiority over Salvatore questioned. Certainly not by a mere cur.</p><p>Time for damage control.</p><p>\u201cNo, master, but Salvatore has often joined powers with the vampires. He will be next to impossible to capture if he is protected by the bloodsuckers.\u201d</p><p>Briggs snorted, not so easily deceived. \u201cThen it\u2019s fortunate I have no need to capture Salvatore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou believe he\u2019ll turn himself over to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s exactly what I believe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to admit that would be my last guess.\u201d Caine was careful to speak into the mud. Briggs was still too close for his peace of mind. \u201cSalvatore might be arrogant, but he isn\u2019t suicidal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but he\u2019s desperate to kill me. Once I offer him the opportunity, he\u2019ll be more than eager to join me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll sense it\u2019s a trap.\u201d</p><p>Briggs laughed. A hollow, sinister sound that made the distant coyotes howl in alarm.</p><p>Gallows humor. Had to love it.</p><p>\u201cAnd yet, he\u2019ll still come. Salvatore is nothing if not predictable.\u201d</p><p>Warily, Caine lifted his head, meeting the crimson gaze. \u201cI assume I have some role in all of this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are a pack of curs camped near your lair, believing you still hold Salvatore.\u201d</p><p>Caine shrugged. He\u2019d received a call from his pack the minute the curs had surrounded his house.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re being watched.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you to bring them to me here.\u201d</p><p>As the words left Briggs\u2019s lips, an image of barren caves below an abandoned Victorian church seared through Caine\u2019s mind. Not just figuratively seared, but actually and painfully seared. Like a map had been branded into his brain tissue.</p><p>Holy hell. Hadn\u2019t the bastard heard of GPS?</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I want Salvatore to suffer before he dies,\u201d Briggs said, his hatred for the King of Weres pulsing in the air. \u201cThere are few things that give me more pleasure than the thought of watching Salvatore\u2019s anguish as he\u2019s forced to kill one of his loyal servants.\u201d</p><p>Caine hid his shudder. He\u2019d always considered himself a badass who ruled his pack with an iron fist, but Briggs made him seem like a freaking pansy in comparison.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I can just imagine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, but you won\u2019t have to imagine,\u201d Briggs taunted. \u201cYou\u2019ll be at my side.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Rising to his feet, Caine covertly stepped back from the biting cold that surrounded Briggs.</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019ll be given the secret to unlocking the Were\u2019s blood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Caine. Soon you\u2019ll be given the reward you so richly deserve,\u201d Briggs crooned, the crimson eyes mocking. \u201cDon\u2019t fail me.\u201d</p> <p>There was a loud pop, and the Were disappeared.</p><p>Caine didn\u2019t hesitate. Spinning on his heel, he darted back to the Jeep. No way he was waiting around for an encore performance.</p><p>Glad he\u2019d taken the doors out of his vehicle, Caine vaulted into his seat and rammed the Jeep into drive.</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d</p><p>Andre gripped the dashboard as Caine thundered over a wooden bridge without slowing.</p> <p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>Caine shivered, the nasty cold still clinging to his skin.</p><p>\u201cSoon you\u2019ll be given the reward you so richly deserve...\u201d</p><p>He should be delirious. He should be tap dancing on top of the freaking world.</p><p>Instead he wished that Briggs had taken his damned visions to some other gullible cur.</p><p>\u201cWhat I am is screwed,\u201d he muttered.</p> <p>Andre narrowed his dark gaze. \u201cDo I need to scout a new lair? The Bahamas? Australia? The Antarctic?\u201d</p><p>Caine had to admit it was tempting.</p><p>He could keep driving and start over far, far away from the feuding Weres. To hell with becoming a pureblood.</p><p>Then he gave a shake of his head. \u201cIt\u2019s too late to run,\u201d he grimly admitted. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing left but to hope we can survive this fucking train crash.\u201d</p><p>Salvatore paced the floor of Harley\u2019s bedroom, the disposable cell phone that Santiago had left for him pressed to his ear. Listening to Hess\u2019s recorded voice echo in his ear, he halted to gaze down at the black-and-gold bed that was still rumpled and warm from his last bout of mind-blowing sex with Harley.</p><p>Cristo, the woman was teaching him a whole new meaning of paradise.</p><p>It was more than the raw, feral pleasure that exploded between them. More than the sense of destiny that hummed through his veins. More than the relentless ache to keep his mate near.</p><p>It was the simple, uncomplicated pleasure of a man who had just made love to the woman who filled his heart with joy.</p> <p>The scent of rich vanilla teased at his nose. Salvatore turned to watch as Harley strolled from the attached bathroom, a white towel wrapped around her slender body, her damp hair clinging to her bare shoulders.</p><p>He snapped shut the phone and tossed it on the bed, hiding a smile as Harley allowed her gaze to covertly slide over his naked form before jerking back to his face.</p><p>\u201cSomething wrong?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve tried to contact Hess, but I go straight to voice-mail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think something\u2019s happened to him?\u201d</p><p>Salvatore shrugged, not bothering to hide his frustration. He was the perfect example of a control freak. Delegating gave him a rash, and asking others for help, especially the brigade of the living dead, was worse than chewing on silver.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s impossible to know, and until Briggs is dead, along with his ability to control the minds of curs, I can\u2019t take the risk of tracking him down. I must depend on Styx to send out a search party.\u201d</p><p>Attempting to appear nonchalant, Harley moved to the bed, burrowing beneath the comforter to hide her delectable body.</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of Styx, what do you plan to do once he arrives with his Ravens?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>As always, Salvatore was fascinated by Harley\u2019s odd combination of fierce, brazen desire and blushing female reserve.</p><p>Lured like a moth to the flame, he crossed to perch on the edge of the mattress, his fingers toying with a wet strand of hair that draped over her shoulder. Instantly his frustration eased.</p><p>\u201cI intend to travel with them back to Chicago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there a reason for your curiosity?\u201d He leaned forward to plant a kiss just below her ear. \u201cDo you have plans for me, cara?\u201d</p><p>She stiffened, the scent of her arousal perfuming the air.</p><p>\u201cSeveral.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeveral?\u201d His tongue traced the line of her collarbone. \u201cI like the sound of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost of them include a muzzle and a silver leash.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKinky.\u201d</p><p>She pressed her hands against his shoulders, pushing him back with a chiding expression.</p><p>\u201cDoes anything deflate that oversized ego of yours?\u201d</p><p>He grabbed her hand to pull it to his mouth, nibbling on the pad of her thumb.</p><p>\u201cNot when I have you in my bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSalvatore...\u201d Her words broke off as she frowned with a sudden distraction, turning her head to sniff at her outstretched arm. \u201cGood God.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just took a shower.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should have waited for me,\u201d he teased, keeping a cautious watch on the glitter in her hazel eyes. Harley didn\u2019t have to be able to shift to be dangerous. \u201cI would have scrubbed your back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI scrubbed my own back, so the question is...\u201d Her eyes narrowed. \u201cWhy do I still smell like you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d Salvatore breathed, forgetting the danger as a primitive, wholly uncivilized surge of satisfaction raced through him.</p><p>His mating musk had been in full bloom during their rousing bout of sex. She would carry his mark for days.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you ever heard the saying, \u2018That what you don\u2019t know can\u2019t hurt you\u2019?\u201d he asked, his smile wry.</p><p>She jerked her hand from his grasp. \u201cYou\u2019re hiding something from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. If you want the truth I\u2019ll give it to you, but...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you tell me I can\u2019t handle the truth, I swear I\u2019ll rip your tongue out.\u201d</p><p>Salvatore studied her in silence. The pale, perfect features. The clear hazel eyes. The full, lush lips.</p><p>A face that was forever engraved on his heart.</p><p>To tell or not to tell?</p><p>He hadn\u2019t intended to reveal the mating. Not until he was done killing Briggs and putting the curs back in their place so he had time to concentrate on a full-scale charm offensive.</p><p>For all his outrageous arrogance, he wasn\u2019t stupid enough to pretend that Harley was ready and eager to be his mate. Hell, she was still trying to decide whether he was friend or enemy.</p><p>He didn\u2019t want to scare her off before he could do some serious wooing.</p><p>Then again, he was beginning to understand this female.</p><p>She would badger and pester and be as annoying as possible until she was satisfied he\u2019d revealed what she wanted to know.</p><p>\u201cVery well, but don\u2019t say I didn\u2019t warn you.\u201d</p><p>Her jaw tightened with impatience. \u201cGiuliani.\u201d</p><p>He caught and held her gaze. \u201cYou carry my scent because you\u2019re my mate.\u201d</p><p>Her face paled, her eyes wide with a stunned disbelief. Salvatore swallowed a sigh. Well, he hadn\u2019t expected high-fives and backflips. Still, it would be nice if she didn\u2019t look as if she\u2019d just been told she had the ebola virus.</p><p>\u201cMate?\u201d She shook her head. \u201cNo freaking way.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged, disguising his disappointment with indifference.</p><p>\u201cYou asked.\u201d</p><p>She scooted to press her back against the headboard, bending her knees and wrapping her arms around them in an unconsciously defensive position.</p><p>\u201cI may have been raised by a pack of curs instead of your precious purebloods, but even I know that true matings disappeared centuries ago,\u201d she charged. \u201cCaine always claimed that they were nothing more than a myth to begin with.\u201d</p><p>Salvatore\u2019s temper flared. Until the mating bond was complete, even the mention of another male was enough to stir his Neanderthal urges.</p><p>\u201cWhat would a cur know of our history?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo he lied when he said that Weres no longer mated?\u201d</p><p>With an effort, he reined in his overly possessive wolf. \u201cIt\u2019s true that matings were thought to have faded, along with many other Were abilities.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen obviously you\u2019ve made a mistake.\u201d She licked her lips, her voice vibrating with unsettled nerves. \u201cWe can\u2019t be mated.\u201d</p><p>He smiled wryly. She\u2019d helped him escape from Caine with unwavering courage. She\u2019d faced a demented Briggs without flinching. But the mere mention of being his mate tweaked her out.</p><p>Should he be offended or pleased he could inspire such a violent reaction?</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say we were mated,\u201d he corrected, deliberately stroking his fingers up her bare arm. She shivered beneath his touch, her sweet vanilla scent mixing with his musk in a combination that set his blood on fire. \u201cI said you were my mate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this some sort of trick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore like the irony of fate.\u201d</p><p>Not amused, she glared at him. \u201cWould you just tell me what\u2019s going on? Why do you think I\u2019m your mate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen a male pureblood discovers his true mate, he produces a very specific musk to mark her.\u201d</p><p>There was a short, dangerous pause. \u201cMark her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a warning to other males to back off.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou covered me in your scent to scare off other men?\u201d</p><p>He skimmed his fingers back down to her wrist, unable to pretend even a token of regret.

Salvatore was instantly erect and ready to please.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re certain?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo long as you don\u2019t complete the mating bond or haul me back to your bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt just disappears?\u201d</p><p>His gaze drifted down to the pulse hammering at the base of her throat.</p><p>\u201cSi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m no longer your mate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will always be my mate, cara.\u201d He bent forward, his lips touching that fluttering pulse with a stark yearning. \u201cFor all eternity. Nothing can change that.\u201d</p> <p>Chapter Fourteen</p><p>For a crazed, breathless moment Harley melted beneath Salvatore\u2019s experienced touch. She was beyond denying that she wanted this Were with a hunger that was on the wrong side of obsessive. Even after three first-rate, heart-stopping orgasms, her body was ready to go for number four.</p><p>Her mind, however, was in stunned mode.</p><p>God Almighty.</p><p>Was Salvatore completely nuts?</p><p>The mere thought she could be his mate took insanity to a whole new level. Not only were true matings nothing more than an urban legend, but they barely knew one another.</p><p>No, that wasn\u2019t entirely true. A liquid ache between her legs reminded her that they knew each other intimately. But mind-blowing sex didn\u2019t equal soul mates.</p><p>So why wasn\u2019t she laughing it off as a bad joke? Or sympathizing with his obvious descent into raving lunacy?</p> <p>This thundering panic implied an emotional reaction she wasn\u2019t prepared to admit.</p><p>Not even to herself.</p><p>With a sharp motion, she pushed off the bed, keeping the damp towel wrapped around her shivering body. In silence she paced from one end of the black-and-gold room to the other, intensely aware of Salvatore\u2019s searing gaze following her every move.</p><p>At last he rose to his feet and crossed to stand directly in her path, his body gloriously naked and his expression somber.</p><p>\u201cHarley?\u201d</p><p>She jerked up her head to meet his brooding gaze. \u201cYou can\u2019t just assume I\u2019m your mate because I smell like you,\u201d she abruptly informed him. \u201cI mean, the past few days have been crazy. This could all be nothing more than stress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMale Weres produce musk only when in the presence of their mates,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s more than just the change in my scent. I knew you were my mate the moment we met.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d He grabbed her hand and pressed it to his chest, directly over the steady beat of his heart. \u201cYou\u2019re stealing my powers. Along with most of my sanity.\u201d</p><p>She eyed him warily, wondering if this was all some bizarre joke.</p><p>\u201cI believe the sanity thing, but I don\u2019t know what the hell you\u2019re babbling about with your powers. Even if I wanted to, I wouldn\u2019t know how to steal them.\u201d</p><p>A wry smile curved his lips, but the golden eyes remained watchful, closely monitoring her reaction.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to do anything but be yourself, cara. It\u2019s the nature of the mating bond to weaken the male.\u201d</p><p>Harley abruptly recalled Salvatore\u2019s unexpected bouts of weakness during their flight from Caine. And his obvious weariness after being attacked by Briggs.</p><p>At the time, she\u2019d put it down to the endless battles and the silver that had been lodged in his shoulder...</p><p>Now her heart slowly squeezed at the realization that if Salvatore was actually telling the truth, she\u2019d been responsible for the chinks in his considerable armor. For God\u2019s sake, she could have gotten him killed without even knowing it.</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of stupid tradition is that?\u201d she muttered sourly. \u201cHaven\u2019t the Weres heard of the Darwin theory? Males should get stronger, not weaker, when they have a mate.\u201d</p><p>A dangerous smile curved his lips as his hands grabbed the top edge of her towel and yanked her against him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s to keep him from taking his mate by force,\u201d he growled, his eyes darkening with a slumberous invitation. \u201cThe female must be willing or the bond can\u2019t be completed.\u201d</p><p>She studied his lean, beautiful face, searching for some sign of resentment. Surely he had to be pissed at having his powers hijacked?</p><p>If he was, he hid it well. At the moment there was nothing but a blazing hunger that smacked into her with delicious force.</p><p>Suddenly she was acutely aware of his fingers that curled beneath the towel and branded the upper curve of her breasts. The hard, ruthless lines of his bronzed body. His intoxicating musk that seeped through her skin and flowed through her blood.</p><p>With an effort, Harley held onto a thin strand of sanity.</p><p>Dammit, Salvatore was being stalked by a crazed psychopathic Were and a pack of crazed curs with regicide on their minds. He should be concentrating on staying alive.</p><p>\u201cAnd once she agrees to the mating, his strength returns?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>He lowered his head to trail his lips over her temple, the satin curtain of his hair brushing her cheek.</p><p>\u201cIt returns even greater than before.\u201d His mouth traced the line of her brow. \u201cThere\u2019s also a legend that ancient mated pairs were once capable of sharing their powers, so they were all but invincible.\u201d</p><p>The heat shimmered through her body, the potent force weakening her knees. Instinctively she grabbed for his shoulders, her nails digging into his rigid muscles. He growled in approval.</p><p>Dammit, he wasn\u2019t going to distract her.</p><p>This was too important.</p><p>\u201cSo how does the female complete this mating bond?\u201d</p><p>He teased at the corner of her mouth. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>She pulled back to glare at him. \u201cHow can you not know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a ritual the female performs. She doesn\u2019t dance around a bonfire or sacrifice small animals.\u201d His lips curled in a smile filled with wicked promise. \u201cOf course, if you wanted to dance around the bonfire naked...\u201d</p><p>\u201cSalvatore.\u201d</p><p>He heaved a sigh, his hands shifting to frame her face, his gaze stabbing deep into her wide eyes.</p><p>\u201cEither the female accepts the male, or she rejects him. It\u2019s as mystical and unexplainable as falling in love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if she doesn\u2019t accept him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen he\u2019ll devote the rest of eternity to changing her mind.\u201d With a powerful motion, Salvatore swept her off her feet and headed to the bed. Harley\u2019s stomach clenched at the focused intent engraved on his face. \u201cLike this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d she breathed, her voice already thick with a pulsing need. \u201cYour powers...\u201d</p><p>The golden glow of his eyes spilled through the room. \u201cAre ready and willing to please you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious, Salvatore. You can\u2019t go against Briggs while you\u2019re weakened,\u201d she protested, her breath tangling in her lungs as she landed spread-eagle on the mattress, Salvatore covering her with his heavily aroused body.</p><p>\u201cHarley, the last thing I want to think about right now is Briggs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis conversation isn\u2019t over...\u201d</p><p>He slid into her with one smooth thrust, and not only was the conversation over, but so was all rational thought.</p><p>Wrapping her legs around his hips, Harley closed her eyes in exquisite pleasure, settling for communicating in a more primitive language.</p><p>Harley hadn\u2019t intended to fall asleep. One minute she\u2019d been floating on a cloud of postcoital bliss and the next she\u2019d been snuggling into Salvatore\u2019s arms and drifting into unconsciousness.</p><p>She didn\u2019t know how long she\u2019d been out when she was awakened by Salvatore whispering in her ear.</p><p>\u201cHarley.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmmmm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarley, I need you get out of bed and dressed as quickly as you can.\u201d</p><p>It was the tension vibrating in his voice that had Harley\u2019s eyes snapping open with sudden alarm.</p><p>\u201cAre the vampires here?\u201d</p><p>Salvatore eased from the bed and tugged on a pair of jeans. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Harley shook off her lingering glow and crawled out of bed to pull on her own clothes, shoving her fingers through her hair before fastening it back with a scrunchie. No one wanted to face trouble naked.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>Salvatore absently slipped on a black satin shirt, leaving it open as he sat on the edge of the bed and shoved his feet into a pair of black biker boots. A far cry from his tailored Gucci suit, but still sexy as hell.</p><p>Lifting his head, he revealed a grim expression. \u201cBriggs.\u201d</p><p>Harley\u2019s blood ran cold. \u201cHe\u2019s here?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOutside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d</p><p>Standing, Salvatore crossed the room to grab her by the shoulders.</p> <p>\u201cFind Santiago and stay with him,\u201d he commanded. \u201cStyx should be here within the hour.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth dropped open with disbelief. Did he really think she was going to be treated like some swooning female who had to be protected by her big strong male?</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCara, don\u2019t argue with me,\u201d he growled. \u201cNot now.\u201d</p><p>She stubbornly held her ground. \u201cYou\u2019re not facing that lunatic by yourself.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine as long as I know you\u2019re safe. Do this for me.\u201d His jaw tightened, his eyes dark with concern. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSalvatore...\u201d</p><p>Putting an end to the argument, Salvatore wrapped an arm around her waist and tossed her over his shoulder. Then striding across the floor, he yanked open the door and set her down in the hallway.</p><p>\u201cGo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDammit.\u201d The door was shut in her face, followed by the distinct sound of the bolt being thrown.</p><p>She stood for a minute, weighing the pleasure of kicking down the door and teaching the damned Were a badly needed lesson in pushing her around against accepting that she was wasting time.</p> <p>Salvatore was just idiotic enough to face Briggs on his own, regardless of the fact that he wasn\u2019t firing on all cylinders.</p><p>So freaking, typically male.</p><p>Turning on her heel, Harley headed down the stairs and back across the wide lobby. It was late, but she could still hear the muted roars from the nightclub below. Obviously blood and sex were a big draw in the ol\u2019 demon world.</p><p>She was nearing the stairs leading back down to the pit when a female form detached from a shadowed alcove, and the scent of plums swirled through the air.</p><p>Tonya, the royal imp.</p><p>Or more likely, the royal slut, Harley cattily decided, her gaze skimming over the red microdress that had been lacquered on the lush body, and the heavy layer of makeup on the pale, perfect face.</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be wandering around on your own, sweet thing,\u201d the imp drawled. \u201cThere are all sorts of beasties roaming around who don\u2019t mind if a woman goes furry once a month.\u201d</p><p>Not bothering to react to the insult or correct the assumption, Harley stabbed the imp with an impatient glare.</p> <p>\u201cI need Santiago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe King of Weres isn\u2019t enough for you?\u201d</p><p>Harley stepped until they were nose to nose. \u201cDon\u2019t. Screw. With. Me. Where is he?\u201d</p><p>The woman swallowed, her eyes suddenly wide. \u201cHis office.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou see, that wasn\u2019t so hard.\u201d</p><p>With a pat on the imp\u2019s cheek, Harley headed for the back of the lobby, not missing a step as the angry woman called out behind her.</p><p>\u201cBitch.\u201d</p><p>Reaching the office, Harley shoved open the door and stepped over the threshold, indifferent to the dangers of intruding on a vampire without invitation.</p><p>\u201cI need your help.\u201d</p><p>Seated behind his desk, Santiago gave a lift of his brows before slowly rising to his feet.</p><p>\u201cOf course. I am at your service.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSalvatore is going outside to meet with Briggs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBriggs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA psychotic zombie pureblood who\u2019s filled with black magic and sporting a nasty temper.\u201d Her voice was clipped with impatience. \u201cHe\u2019s convinced himself that he should be sitting on the Were throne.\u201d</p><p>With fluid, almost dizzying speed, Santiago was moving toward a far wall, pressing his fingers to the frame of one of the paintings. With a small swoosh the wall slid inward, revealing a hidden tunnel.</p><p>\u201cWait here,\u201d the vamp commanded, disappearing into the dark.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d Harley threw her hands in the air as the demon ignored her, continuing on to his bat cave and leaving her to twiddle her damn thumbs. \u201cGod. Men are so freaking annoying.\u201d</p><p>She glared at the opening, but she wasn\u2019t stupid enough to follow. Entering the private lair of a vampire was a death sentence. Pure and simple.</p><p>Instead she anxiously paced the floor, cursing the dampening spell that made it impossible for her to sense whether Salvatore had already left the building.</p><p>How had Briggs managed to find them? And how had he broken through the enchantment to contact Salvatore without alerting Santiago?</p><p>Still pacing the floor, her stomach clenched with a fear that sparked her temper.</p><p>She curled her hands to fists. Why did she even care what happened to the arrogant King of Weres? Just a week ago he\u2019d been the boogeyman that Caine used to keep her prisoner. Okay, she didn\u2019t think he was out to kill her anymore. And he most certainly was the kind of take-no-prisoner lover, one that any woman would have to be an idiot to kick out of bed.</p><p>But he wasn\u2019t supposed to be anything more than a means to getting to her sisters, right? Ships passing in the night...yadda yadda.</p><p>Dammit.</p><p>She was counting to one hundred and if Santiago wasn\u2019t back, she was going to look for Salvatore without him.</p><p>She reached twenty when Santiago made a silent reappearance, his long hair tied into a braid, carrying a leather satchel.</p><p>A vampire ready for action.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re leaving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeaving?\u201d She frowned at his abrupt command. \u201cNo frigging way.\u201d</p><p>His long strides never broke as he crossed to grasp her arm and steer her toward the door.</p><p>\u201cStyx and his Ravens are fifty miles north of town. We\u2019re driving to meet him.\u201d</p><p>She dug in her heels. Not just a figment of speech. She might be tiny, but she was all Were.</p><p>An irate female Were with combat training.</p><p>One of the most dangerous creatures in the world.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not going anywhere until we\u2019ve stopped Briggs from slaughtering Salvatore,\u201d she hissed.</p><p>Coming to a grudging halt, Santiago met her angry glare with an unyielding expression.</p><p>\u201cMy orders are to keep you safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t give a crap what your orders are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarley, you are currently my guest, but if you insist on putting yourself in danger, then I\u2019ll make you my prisoner.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t miss the silken warning in his dark voice.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter to you that Salvatore is in danger?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot in the least.\u201d</p><p>Harley clenched her hands, knowing she couldn\u2019t force the vampire to help Salvatore fight Briggs.</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t care about Salvatore\u2019s safety, then why are you so determined to protect me?\u201d she snapped.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re mate-sister to my Anasso. He was very clear in his command to bring you to him without delay.\u201d</p><p>Perfect.</p><p>The nightclub was overflowing with powerful demons and not a cursed one would lift a finger to help her without the say-so of this vamp.</p><p>\u201cMate-sister or not, he\u2019s not my king. I\u2019ll decide when I leave.\u201d She stepped forward, her temper reaching a critical level. Something or someone was about to get broken. \u201cGet out of my way.\u201d</p><p>Santiago reached behind his back, pulling a gun from his waistband.</p><p>\u201cI am sorry, Harley.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare,\u201d she muttered, shoving him in the chest and making a wild dash toward the door.</p><p>He wouldn\u2019t actually shoot her.</p><p>The thought flashed through her mind at the precise moment she felt a sharp pain in her butt, and the world went black.</p><p>Leaving the warehouse, Salvatore followed the sense of Briggs to the small park that had been built near the river. It was late enough to be empty of humans, and the few dew fairies who lingered preferred to dance in the tiny tendrils of fog that lay like a shroud on top of the water.</p><p>Prepared for a trap, Salvatore moved past the picnic tables set in concrete slabs and the neatly trimmed bushes, at last coming to a halt as a shimmer broke the air in front of the stone fountain.</p><p>He resisted the urge to sweep the area with his senses. For now he had to trust that Harley wasn\u2019t going to do something stupid. He couldn\u2019t afford to be distracted.</p><p>There was a change in air pressure, then with a pop, the familiar form of Briggs was visible in the darkness.</p><p>Salvatore gagged at the stench of rotting meat that filled the frigid air.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re looking a little ragged, mio amico,\u201d he muttered, his gaze skimming over the haggard face and the too-thin body bent beneath the heavy cloak. Even in projection form, the pureblood looked like hell. \u201cAnd you smell even worse. How long has it been since you got laid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA few of us have priorities that don\u2019t involve whores,\u201d the crimson eyes flashed. \u201cOf course, once I\u2019ve taken the throne, I\u2019ll have plenty of time to screw your mate. How poetic if she\u2019s the first female to birth my litter.\u201d</p><p>Salvatore\u2019s wolf crawled beneath his skin, a brutal fury pumping through his blood.</p><p>\u201cYou try to bed Harley and she\u2019ll rip your black heart out,\u201d he rasped.</p><p>\u201cBefore I\u2019m done with her, she\u2019ll be begging to be in my bed. And if not...\u201d The hollow chuckle sent a chill of revulsion down Salvatore\u2019s spine. \u201cI don\u2019t mind taking my women by force. A struggle always adds a nice spice to sex.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Salvatore\u2019s heat blasted through the park, his power a tangible force.</p><p>\u201cBeing one of the walking dead has obviously putrefied your brain. You will never sit on my throne, and you will never have Harley. The only thing in your future is a long overdue grave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuch brave talk,\u201d Briggs rasped.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not the one cowering behind illusions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe thankful you haven\u2019t yet faced me in the flesh. You would be dead.\u201d A sneer curled the pureblood\u2019s mouth. \u201cJust like the worthless king before you.\u201d</p><p>Salvatore stiffened.</p><p>Dio. His suspicions had been right.</p><p>\u201cYou killed Mackenzie?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAre you just now figuring that out?\u201d Briggs mocked. \u201cGod, how could fate ever have thought you worthy of being king?\u201d</p><p>Salvatore ignored the insult, his thoughts churning. He was playing a deadly game without knowing the rules or the ultimate goals.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you kill him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he was no longer of use to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd no longer any use to your master?\u201d Salvatore challenged, sensing the power behind Briggs was the true danger. \u201cHave you considered what will happen to you once you\u2019ve served your purpose?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI already know my destiny.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSitting on a throne that doesn\u2019t belong to you? You\u2019re a fool, Briggs. You\u2019ll be betrayed, just like Mackenzie.\u201d</p><p>The chill thickened and with a lift of his hands, Briggs struck out, slamming his power into Salvatore.</p><p>\u201cYou know nothing.\u201d</p><p>Salvatore reeled from the blow, but he ignored the broken ribs and squared his shoulders. He\u2019d touched a nerve. Briggs could brag and boast all he wanted, but underneath he feared that he was just more useless fodder.</p><p>\u201cI know that a demon doesn\u2019t share his power without expecting something in return,\u201d he ruthlessly pressed. \u201cAnd that the true cost is always shrouded in lies until it\u2019s too late.\u201d</p><p>A tick jerked beneath one sunken eye, but Briggs smiled with that smug superiority that always set Salvatore\u2019s teeth on edge.</p><p>There was room for only one arrogant bastard in the pack.</p><p>And he was it.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me you\u2019re concerned for me, Giuliani,\u201d Briggs scoffed. \u201cI\u2019m touched.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m concerned that your damned greed has condemned the Weres to extinction.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the one destroying the Weres. It\u2019s my fate to be their savior.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery noble, but evil can\u2019t create, it can only destroy.\u201d</p><p>That disturbing laugh once again echoed through the empty park, sending the handful of dew fairies fleeing in horror. Salvatore wished he could join them.</p><p>There was something just...wrong about Briggs.</p><p>Beyond the cold, beyond the hideous smell, beyond the black magic was a sense of twisted perversion.</p><p>As if the grave still claimed his soul.</p><p>\u201cDid you read that in a fortune cookie?\u201d Briggs taunted.</p><p>Salvatore shuddered, wondering if there was anything of the Were left inside the decaying shell.</p><p>\u201cHave you ever considered that our troubles began with Mackenzie?\u201d He forced himself to meet the disturbing crimson gaze. \u201cHis treachery condemned us and your megalomania has only fueled our downfall. You\u2019re like rot that has to be cut away before it can spread further.\u201d He didn\u2019t bother to hide his grimace. \u201cDio, you even smell like rot.\u201d</p><p>The frigid power once again flared out, driving Salvatore to his knees. Grimly, he straightened. Another rib was cracked and his lung was punctured, but he\u2019d rather be skinned alive than be on his knees before this abomination.</p><p>\u201cBastard,\u201d Briggs hissed. \u201cThe only rot among the Weres comes from your tainted blood. Mackenzie should have killed you the moment your claim to the throne was sensed.\u201d</p><p>Salvatore narrowed his gaze. It was obvious that the mysterious demon had plotted first with Mackenzie and then Briggs to keep Salvatore off the throne. But why? Was there something about him that threatened the creature?</p><p>\u201cIs that what your puppet master desires?\u201d he demanded. \u201cMy death?\u201d</p><p>Briggs snorted. \u201cWho doesn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>Good point. Salvatore had never bothered to win friends and influence people. He didn\u2019t doubt there was a long line of demons who wanted his head on a platter. But this was more than just the regular run-of-the-mill death wish. This was an attack on the entire Were nation.</p><p>\u201cWhat does my death give him?\u201d Salvatore stepped closer to Briggs, one arm wrapped around his injured chest. \u201cAnd why use you as a flunky, instead of killing me himself? Is he scared of me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cScared?\u201d Briggs made a dismissive motion, but Salvatore sensed the dark thread of doubt that flowed through the Were. Something Salvatore intended to use to his advantage. At least he intended to use it once he could find the damned coward. \u201cYou\u2019re nothing more than a mistake that will soon be corrected.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmpty promises,\u201d he taunted. \u201cThat\u2019s all you can offer.\u201d</p><p>The Were snarled. \u201cI\u2019m happy to make it a reality.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs you wish. You can find me here.\u201d</p><p>Salvatore swayed as Briggs roughly shoved the image of barren caves directly into his mind. He\u2019d heard of the trick, but he hadn\u2019t realized it burned like a bitch.</p><p>\u201cCristo. You could have just given me the directions,\u201d he growled.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t want you to get lost.\u201d The demented Were smiled, clearly pleased with his cheesy parlor trick. \u201cThis way you have no excuse not to join me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo excuse beyond the fact that it\u2019s an obvious trap,\u201d Salvatore drawled. \u201cWhen we meet, it will be at a location of my choosing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not making the rules, Giuliani. I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you forgotten who is the King of Weres?\u201d</p><p>Briggs took a threatening step forward before making a visible effort to control his temper.</p><p>\u201cYou will join me, or each passing day I will kill one of your curs,\u201d he warned, his lips curling in a malevolent satisfaction at Salvatore\u2019s growl of shock. \u201cAh, yes. Did I forget to mention that I\u2019ve arranged for your bodyguards to join me?\u201d</p><p>Alarm mixed with impotent fury as Salvatore recalled his futile attempts to reach Hess. Dammit. He\u2019d stayed away from his curs to keep them safe.</p><p>\u201cHarm them and I swear I will rip you into so many tiny pieces not even your fairy godfather will be able to put you back together again,\u201d he threatened, his voice thick with the hatred that poured like acid through his veins.</p><p>Briggs backed away, his expression hardening as he realized he\u2019d revealed his instinctive fear.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tarry, Giuliani,\u201d he snapped. \u201cOur reunion is long overdue.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Fifteen</p><p>Harley wasn\u2019t entirely surprised when she opened her eyes to discover she was laying in an ivory-and-gold bedroom the size of most apartments. No, scratch that. The size of most family homes with attached garages.</p><p>Scooting off the bed drenched in gold satin, she rubbed her butt that was still sore and headed directly to the tray of food that had been left beside a massive fireplace. She didn\u2019t hesitate as she demolished the barbeque chicken, the mound of French fries, and coleslaw. She could smell the combination of vampire and Were without even a hint of bloodshed, which meant she could only be in one place.</p><p>The Chicago mansion of the Anasso.</p><p>The food had to be safe.</p><p>Eager to replenish her strength, Harley polished off the entire plate, ignoring the fine bottle of wine and instead downed the pitcher of water.</p><p>Only then did she take time to actually study her surroundings.</p><p>Holy crap.</p><p>Had there been a fire sale at Big Lots on marble? And crystal chandeliers? And Louis XIV furniture?</p><p>Or had her sister been punk\u2019d by the guys from Queer Eye for the Straight Guy?</p><p>She was counting the number of sickeningly sweet cupids painted on the vaulted ceiling when she sensed the approach of a vampire. Turning, she squared her shoulders and prepared to meet her brother-in-law.</p><p>Or at least, that was the plan.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t sure anyone could be prepared for the six-foot-six Aztec warrior with hair braided down his back, dressed in black leather and motorcycle boots.

She\u2019d been knocked out for hours and hauled miles from Salvatore\u2019s trail.</p><p>Someone was going to pay.</p><p>\u201cA dart in the butt?\u201d she gritted. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>The King of Vampires was trained well enough to hide his amusement and instead managed to look just plain arrogant.</p><p>\u201cYou left Santiago little choice.\u201d Was this his lame-ass stab at making amends? \u201cHe did insist that I offer his apologies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that makes it all better.\u201d She tilted back her head to meet his piercing gaze. \u201cI suppose you must be Styx?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs my sister lurking nearby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is downstairs, anxiously waiting for an opportunity to speak with you.\u201d With unnerving speed he was standing directly in front of her, his nose flaring as if he were testing her scent. \u201cI asked if I could have a few minutes alone with you first.\u201d</p> <p>Harley stepped back, her hackles stirring at his sudden intrusion into her personal space.</p><p>\u201cWatch it, vampire. You might be some sort of relation in our twisted family tree, but that doesn\u2019t mean I won\u2019t kick your ass.\u201d</p><p>He folded his arms over his massive chest, not particularly terrified by her threat.</p><p>\u201cI only want to ask a few questions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat questions?\u201d</p> <p>He grimaced, looking oddly uncomfortable. \u201cThere is no delicate means of approaching this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve already had me drugged and kidnapped,\u201d she dryly pointed out. \u201cThere\u2019s no need to pretend good manners at this late stage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well. Why do you carry Salvatore\u2019s scent?\u201d</p><p>She choked at the blunt question. Surely there had to be some etiquette against random sniffing?</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t imagine how that\u2019s any of your business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not trying to intrude into your privacy, Harley.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo?\u201d Her humorless laugh echoed through the cavernous room that had grown cold with the vampire\u2019s pulsing power. \u201cGod only knows what you would ask if you were trying to intrude. What does it matter to you what I smell like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it has been countless centuries since a werewolf has mated.\u201d He towered over her; big, dark, and deadly. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to forgive me if I wonder if this is a miracle or a hoax.\u201d</p><p>Her brows snapped together. \u201cWhy would I try to hoax you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot you,\u201d he gently corrected. \u201cMy suspicion is that someone or something is attempting to deceive Salvatore.\u201d</p><p>She froze, an unpleasant fear settling in the pit of her stomach.</p><p>When Salvatore had alleged she was his mate, she had been shocked out of her mind. After all, great sex was one thing, but an eternal commitment was a little more than she wanted hanging over her head.</p><p>So why did the thought that Salvatore\u2019s bond might be no more than a scam on the King of Weres make her blood run cold?</p><p>Gritting her teeth, Harley pretended that an empty ache hadn\u2019t bloomed in the center of her heart, and concentrated on the only thing that was important.</p> <p>Saving Salvatore from his own stupidity.</p><p>\u201cBriggs,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>Styx nodded. \u201cSantiago mentioned the Were. Tell me what you know of him.\u201d</p><p>Harley ignored her instinctive bristling at his sharp command and revealed the bits and scraps she\u2019d picked up of the perverted pureblood.</p><p>Styx listened in silence, his expression settling into grim lines that oddly reminded her of Salvatore.</p><p>Or perhaps not so oddly.</p><p>They were both leaders who carried the weight of their people on their shoulders.</p><p>The heavy sense of responsibility left its mark.</p><p>\u201cOnly a demon lord should have the power to resurrect a dead Were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDemon lord?\u201d She grimaced. \u201cI\u2019m afraid to ask.\u201d</p><p>Without warning, the ancient vampire turned to pace across the marble floor, his movements surprisingly fluid for such a large beast.</p><p>\u201cThey are disciples of the dark prince, although few have shown an interest in this world since humans began to crawl from their caves.\u201d His lips curled with disdain. Obviously the vampire wasn\u2019t a big fan of demon lords. \u201cAnd the few who continued to dabble among us lesser creatures were blocked entirely when the Phoenix was called into the Chalice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPhoenix? Chalice?\u201d She shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t have a clue what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Phoenix is the essence of a goddess who was brought into this world over three hundred years ago by a coven of witches.\u201d His eyes flashed with a terrifying emotion. \u201cHer presence blocks the dark prince and his minions from entering this dimension.\u201d</p><p>Harley took a wary step to the side as his pacing brought him within striking distance.</p><p>\u201cThat seems like a good thing. What am I missing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe essence is held in a human female who becomes the Chalice of the goddess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA human?\u201d She blinked in confusion. \u201cAren\u2019t they a little fragile for such a task?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe human is protected by the goddess.\u201d His humorless smile revealed a set of kickass fangs. \u201cAlthough the same coven who conjured the goddess weren\u2019t content. They decided they needed a guardian who would never fail the Chalice, so they bound a vampire to her soul.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d She grimaced. \u201cI assume the vampire didn\u2019t jump to the head of the line to volunteer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at the time, although he\u2019s become reconciled to his position now that Abby is the new Chalice.\u201d Styx\u2019s expression eased. \u201cThey\u2019ve recently mated.\u201d</p><p>Harley didn\u2019t fully understand the whole goddess and Chalice thing, but she did grasp the most pertinent fact.</p><p>\u201cIf Abby\u2019s carrying this Goddess, then Briggs can\u2019t be hooked up with a demon lord, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never underestimate a determined demon lord. They have the means to use others to accomplish their goals, and are always swift to take advantage of any weakness.\u201d Styx came to an abrupt halt, the cool brush of his power making her shiver. \u201cI need to speak with Abby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think she\u2019s falling down on the job?\u201d</p><p>He laughed with genuine amusement. \u201cEven if I did, I wouldn\u2019t be stupid enough to point it out. Abby has the power to toast demons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiterally toast them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiterally.\u201d</p><p>Harley made a mental note to avoid the woman.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you want to speak with her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope she can convince me that my fears are a figment of my imagination.\u201d</p><p>Harley\u2019s heart plummeted and her mouth went dry at the dark edge of concern in his voice. What the hell would scare the King of Vampires?</p><p>\u201cAre demon lords so dangerous?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are many who believe they are our ultimate creators. Which means they could also be our ultimate destroyers.\u201d</p><p>Without thought, Harley was charging to the door. Crap. Crap. Crap. This was so much worse than a demented Were who refused to stay dead.</p><p>\u201cI have to warn Salvatore.\u201d</p><p>She heard the tiny tinkle of the bronzed medallions threaded through Styx\u2019s braid, but she couldn\u2019t track his movement until he was standing directly in front of her, blocking her path to the door.</p><p>\u201cHold on, Harley.\u201d He grabbed her arms as she attempted to dart around him. \u201cThis is nothing more than idle speculation. Jumping to conclusions is worse than doing nothing.\u201d</p><p>She struggled to free herself from his grasp, her temper exploding.</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t be waffling if it was one of your precious vampires in danger,\u201d she gritted. \u201cYou would be charging to the rescue.\u201d</p><p>A raven brow flicked upward. \u201cI am not a vampire who waffles. I am attempting to discover who or what is threatening Salvatore, and if it poses a danger to other demons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. You do whatever it is you have to do and I\u2019ll be on my merry way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere do you intend to go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes it matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it does.\u201d He flashed a hint of fang. More out of annoyance than intimidation. Or at least, Harley hoped so. \u201cSalvatore demanded my promise that I would keep you safe. I intend to honor my vow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not his call. Or yours.\u201d She jutted her chin. She\u2019d allowed fear to keep her prisoner for thirty years. She was done hiding from the world. Even if that world was terrifyingly dangerous. \u201cNo man\u2019s going to tell me what I can or can\u2019t do. Not anymore.\u201d</p><p>His expression tightened, but before he could say anything truly stupid, the door to the bedroom was thrown open and a slender replica of herself walked in.</p><p>No, not a precise replica, Harley realized, her gaze skimming over the blond hair that was cut short and spiky and the delicate face that was just a trace more heart-shaped, with eyes that were more green than hazel.</p><p>Still, the resemblance was stunning.</p><p>Harley watched her sister approach, her stomach twisting with an odd combination of emotions.</p><p>What the hell was she supposed to feel?</p><p>Joy? Disbelief? Regret?</p><p>A raging identity crisis?</p><p>With a shake of her head, she decided that she would figure out what to feel later. For now all that mattered was getting out of the marble mausoleum and finding Salvatore.</p><p>Clearly unafraid of the towering predator who could easily rip out her throat or simply squash her with one of his massive fists, Darcy crossed to stab her mate with a stern gaze.</p><p>\u201cStyx, I wish to speak with my sister.\u201d</p><p>He dipped his head in instant agreement. \u201cVery well, my love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlone.\u201d</p><p>The vampire\u2019s starkly beautiful features tightened, but astonishingly, he headed obediently toward the door. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll be downstairs.

I should have known he\u2019d try to bully you.\u201d She rolled her eyes. \u201cVampires.\u201d</p><p>Harley\u2019s wariness eased at her sister\u2019s teasing. Attired in a faded pair of jeans and casual white shirt, with her sweet smile, she didn\u2019t look like the Queen of Vampires.</p><p>Actually she looked like a high school cheerleader who should be working on her algebra and dating the quarterback.</p> <p>\u201cTrust me, Weres aren\u2019t any different,\u201d Harley countered.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. It\u2019s men in general.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll that testosterone putrefies their brains.\u201d</p><p>They shared the universal sigh of female resignation at the follies of men.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Darcy.\u201d Her sister squeezed her fingers. \u201cAnd you\u2019re a most honored guest in my home, sister.\u201d</p><p>Harley pulled her hand free, bothered by the strange sense of connection flowing through her blood at Darcy\u2019s touch.</p><p>As delighted as she was to meet her sister, she wasn\u2019t ready to lower her guard. Darcy was, after all, bound to the vampires. Her loyalty would be to her mate and his people.</p><p>\u201cGuest or prisoner?\u201d she demanded.</p> <p>\u201cNever a prisoner, Harley. I promise.\u201d</p><p>Unnerved to be staring into a face so remarkably similar to her own, Harley paced toward the tall arched windows. Night had recently fallen, bathing the rolling parkland that surrounded the mansion in velvet shadows, but in the distance Harley could see the Chicago skyline strikingly outlined in lights.</p><p>At any other time she might have appreciated the beautiful view. She rarely had had the opportunity to spend time in a large, vibrant city that offered endless entertainment. But not tonight.</p><p>There was a disturbing emptiness in the center of her being that was making her twitchy as hell. She needed to be out of the elegant mansion and on the hunt.</p><p>Now.</p><p>\u201cIs our other sister here as well?\u201d she demanded, as much to know how many others might try to stand in her path as in genuine curiosity.</p><p>Later she would appreciate the sisters she thought she\u2019d lost.</p><p>\u201cNo, Regan left earlier today.\u201d Darcy heaved a loud sigh. \u201cLike you, she seemed to believe I was secretly plotting to hold her against her will. I really am a nice person. I only want to get to know my sisters.\u201d</p><p>Harley turned with a frown. \u201cI thought she was in love or mated to a vampire or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll be mated once she stops running from fate. Poor Jagr.\u201d The green eyes narrowed as Darcy studied her with unnerving intensity. \u201cAnd speaking of matings...\u201d</p><p>Harley shifted, feeling like a dork as a heat flooded her cheeks.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t grown up with sisters or best friends. She hadn\u2019t gone to sleepovers where she could giggle and talk about boys.</p><p>Her private feelings had always been that. Private.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t ready to discuss whatever was happening between her and Salvatore.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not mated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but Salvatore has marked you.\u201d Darcy\u2019s gaze never wavered. \u201cYou know how amazing this is, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not something I\u2019ve given a lot of thought to. We\u2019ve been a little busy,\u201d Harley pointed out dryly.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Darcy flashed her sweet smile. \u201cLevet did say you were escaping from the curs who were holding you captive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLevet.\u201d Harley happily latched onto the opportunity to deflect her sister\u2019s attention. \u201cGood God, I forgot about the poor thing. Is he here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, and to be honest I\u2019m worried about him.\u201d There was no mistaking Darcy\u2019s genuine concern. \u201cHe contacted Shay when he first escaped the tunnels, but we haven\u2019t heard from him since. It\u2019s not like him to just disappear.\u201d</p><p>Harley grimaced, a sudden stab of guilt piercing her heart. They should never have allowed the poor little gargoyle to go off alone.</p><p>\u201cHe might have been captured by Caine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould the curs hurt him?\u201d</p><p>Despite his reputation, Caine wasn\u2019t completely amoral. But nothing was allowed to threaten his precious dreams of immortality.</p><p>\u201cCaine\u2019s more likely to hold him captive if he thinks the gargoyle could bring him leverage against Salvatore or the vampires.\u201d</p><p>They exchanged rueful glances, both knowing Salvatore or the vamps wouldn\u2019t lift a finger to save the miniature demon.</p><p>\u201cAnd if there is no leverage?\u201d Darcy demanded.</p><p>\u201cThen all bets are off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCrap.\u201d Darcy wrapped her arms around her waist. \u201cI\u2019m not going to be happy if Levet is hurt.\u201d</p><p>Oddly, Harley realized she, too, was worried about the gargoyle. He didn\u2019t deserve to be caught in nasty Were politics.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do what I can to discover what\u2019s happened to him,\u201d she promised.</p><p>Darcy bit her lower lip, looking far from reassured.</p><p>\u201cHarley, I understand if you want revenge after being held prisoner by Caine for so long, but I can\u2019t bear the thought of you putting yourself in danger. If you\u2019ll wait, I\u2019m certain we can figure out a suitable punishment together.\u201d</p><p>Punishment? Harley\u2019s brows snapped together. As if she\u2019d waste a minute plotting revenge on the curs.</p><p>\u201cThanks, but I don\u2019t give a crap about Caine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why are you so anxious to leave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause Salvatore\u2019s an idiot and the vampires are jackasses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Darcy said slowly. \u201cI don\u2019t disagree, but maybe you could be more specific. Why is Salvatore an idiot?\u201d</p><p>Harley\u2019s lips twisted in a humorless smile.</p><p>Oh, let her count the ways.</p><p>She chose the most pressing stupidity.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s out there trying to stop some mutant freak who might or might not be a puppet of a demon lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the vampires?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey won\u2019t do a damned thing to stop his suicide mission.\u201d</p><p>Darcy was smart enough not to pretend that Styx possessed any warm and fussy feelings for Salvatore. Or that the vamps would charge to the rescue.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you intend to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFind Salvatore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s as far as my plan goes.\u201d</p><p>Darcy grasped Harley\u2019s hands and regarded her with a somber expression.</p><p>\u201cHarley, will you trust me?\u201d</p><p>Harley stiffened. \u201cI\u2019ve heard those words before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you?\u201d Darcy squeezed her fingers. \u201cPlease?\u201d</p><p>There was a short, uncomfortable silence before Harley heaved a noisy sigh.</p><p>\u201cDammit, I\u2019m going to regret this.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Sixteen</p><p>If Caine\u2019s nerves hadn\u2019t been scraped raw, he might have found humor in the journey through the dark, narrow tunnel that burrowed deep beneath the abandoned graveyard.</p><p>It was straight out of a B horror flick.</p><p>A brewing storm. Creepy caves. Monsters lurking in the dark.</p><p>All he needed was a half-dressed woman screaming at the top of her lungs and a stoner friend wandering off to get chopped in half.</p><p>As it was, he didn\u2019t find anything remotely funny about leading the four furious curs through the echoing darkness, his skin crawling at the evil that pulsed through the labyrinth of caverns.</p><p>He suddenly realized he knew exactly how a condemned man felt walking to the execution chamber.</p><p>Clenching his jaw, he held the gun he\u2019d loaded with silver bullets and glanced over his shoulder at the curs who grudgingly followed behind him.</p><p>It hadn\u2019t been a difficult task to capture Salvatore\u2019s faithful servants. Or even to keep them suitably leashed once his own curs had clamped heavy silver collars around their necks. For the moment they were so weak they could barely put one foot in front of another.</p><p>But it had taken a whole new level of stupidity to leave Andre to guard the Jeep parked behind the abandoned church and enter the caves.</p><p>A damned shame that running away like a freaking puss was no longer an option. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSalvatore\u2019s going to skin you alive and feed your entrails to the vultures,\u201d the tall, bald-headed cur growled as he stumbled behind Caine.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the fourth time you\u2019ve used that same threat, moron,\u201d Salvatore snapped. \u201cIf you can\u2019t think of a new one, then keep your trap shut.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a threat, it\u2019s a promise.\u201d</p> <p>Caine tightened his grip on the gun, sick to death of Salvatore Giuliani.</p><p>\u201cAre you so certain?\u201d he sneered. \u201cIt seems to me that your precious king saved his own hide and left you swinging in the breeze.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know Salvatore had plenty of time and opportunity to warn you that he\u2019d escaped and was having a fine time with his current bitch.\u201d</p><p>The blond-haired cur who Caine suspected had a smidgen more intelligence than the others, snapped his teeth in fury.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re wasting your time, traitor. Our loyalty to the king will never waver.\u201d</p><p>Caine snorted. Okay, the cur was just as brainless as the others.</p><p>\u201cDepressingly predictable,\u201d he muttered. \u201cI\u2019m sick of curs who are content to be the butt-monkeys of the Weres. Just because you were made, and not born a werewolf, doesn\u2019t make you any less worthy. It\u2019s your precious Salvatore that has weakened and controlled you to make sure he always has a ready supply of willing slaves. Christ, he\u2019s brought us to the point of extinction to keep control. Don\u2019t you care that your brothers are dying?\u201d</p><p>The bald-headed cur clenched his beefy hands, but the silver poisoning his body made it impossible for him to do more than glare at Caine.</p><p>\u201cThat recruitment shit didn\u2019t work on me when the Civil War broke out, and it sure as hell isn\u2019t going to work now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut all Salvatore has to do is arrive in America and snap his fingers, and you go running like an eager puppy?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s my king.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBig yip.\u201d Caine resisted the urge to knock the idiot upside the head. \u201cAnd what does he do for you beyond keeping you on his leash? If you had any pride you would be seeking a means of throwing off the yoke of tyranny. The curs are destined to regain the powers that have been denied them for too long.\u201d</p><p>The heat of the angry curs blasted through the narrow tunnel, searing away the tainted chill.</p><p>\u201cA revolution you intend to lead?\u201d the blond cur mocked.</p><p>Caine shrugged. \u201cSomeone had to be the Chosen One. It\u2019s my fate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you want me to trade being a servant to the true King of Weres to become a slave for a batshit crazy cur?\u201d the larger servant rasped. \u201cNo thanks.\u201d</p><p>Caine considered the pleasure of popping a few silver bullets in the cur\u2019s ass, but the sudden stench of rotting flesh was an unpleasant distraction.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t that he hadn\u2019t known Briggs would be waiting for him.</p> <p>It was the one thing he\u2019d been absolutely certain of.</p><p>But that didn\u2019t keep his heart from dropping to the region of his shriveled gonads.</p><p>As if to mock his sense of impending doom, they stepped out of the tunnel into a large cavern that held three giant cages around a jagged pit in the center of the stone floor. Three torches were set in brackets on the wall, flooding the space with an eerie flicker of orange light, and revealing an even eerier sight of Briggs standing across the chamber.</p><p>\u201cSalvatore\u2019s pets were always annoyingly faithful,\u201d he drawled as his crimson gaze flicked over the shackled curs. \u201cWhich, of course, makes them such a joy to kill.\u201d</p><p>Caine reluctantly shoved his gun in the waistband of his jeans, able to taste the potent fear of his prisoners. He didn\u2019t blame them. The sight and smell of Briggs was enough to send the bravest cur screaming in horror.</p><p>\u201cMaster.\u201d Caine bowed, shivering as the icy power curled around him. \u201cI have brought the curs as you requested.\u201d</p><p>Wrapped in his clich\u00e9d black cloak and looking like he\u2019d just crawled from his grave, Briggs waved a dismissive hand toward the nearest cage.</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m capable of seeing what you have done. Lock them away.\u201d</p><p>Taking more time than necessary, Caine wrestled the weakened curs into one of the cages and slammed shut the door, hearing the lock slide closed. Then with a sick sensation in the pit of his stomach, he fell to his knees in a gesture of humility the pureblood demanded.</p><p>\u201cWhat else would you have of me, master?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have performed your last duty, Caine. Rise to your feet.\u201d</p><p>Slowly straightening, Caine stiffened as the power in the cavern thickened, the prickling ice biting into his skin with cruel force.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>Briggs laughed. \u201cIt\u2019s time for your reward.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere?\u201d A flare of panic threatened to shut down what little brain function was still chugging away. With a grim effort, Caine squashed his fear and forced his leaden feet to inch away from the silver cages toward the opening of the tunnel. \u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t. And you never have,\u201d Briggs taunted, flowing to block Caine\u2019s exit. The crimson eyes shimmered with malevolent light, the gaunt face twisted with perverted amusement. \u201cWhat a gullible fool you\u2019ve been. I didn\u2019t have to do anything more than mutter a bunch of gibberish and call it a prophecy for you to sacrifice everything and everyone for a chance at glory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe vision.\u201d Caine shook his head, refusing to believe it had all been a lie. It wasn\u2019t possible. Not when he had physically felt his blood being altered as it spilled out of his body. He had even smelled his scent changing, becoming Were. It had been a tangible glimpse into the future. \u201cIt\u2019s my destiny. That can\u2019t be a lie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoor Caine.\u201d Briggs raised his hand, lashing Caine with his frigid power. \u201cWhat a disappointment this must be. To have believed that you were the great cur Messiah, and now to discover you are nothing more than a pawn in a Were power struggle.\u201d</p><p>Caine stumbled to the side, distantly aware of the edge of the gaping pit that loomed dangerously close to his feet.</p><p>\u201cDamn you.\u201d</p><p>A sneer curled Briggs\u2019s lips. \u201cAt least you can take comfort in knowing that your efforts have led Salvatore straight to his death. Doesn\u2019t that warm your heart? I know it makes me all giddy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sick bastard.\u201d Caine fell to his knees, his lungs barely capable of drawing in air as the agonizing pain seared through his body, turning his blood to ice. Somewhere deep in his heart, the hope that his growing suspicions about Briggs were wrong died a slow, relentless death. He\u2019d been played like a violin by the pureblood. And now he was going to pay the ultimate price for his stupidity. How fitting. \u201cI hope Salvatore sends you straight back to the hell you climbed out of.\u201d</p><p>Infuriated by the mere mention of the King of Weres, Briggs sent another bolt of power that slammed into Caine with the force of a speeding semi-truck.</p><p>\u201cThe only thing Salvatore\u2019s going to do is die,\u201d he rasped. \u201cJust like you.\u201d</p><p>The torturous pain dug deeper, shredding through him with unnerving ease. Instinctively, Caine tried to shift, but Briggs\u2019s power had taken command of him, refusing to allow his wolf to answer his call.</p><p>Laying his hands flat against the stone floor, Caine lowered his head and sucked in short, agonizing gasps of air. So this was it. He\u2019d bet it all and lost.</p><p>Pathetic.</p><p>But a part of his pride wasn\u2019t completely defeated.</p><p>He might never become the pureblooded Were he\u2019d been promised, but he\u2019d be damned if he was going to let the bastard have the satisfaction of killing him.</p><p>He\u2019d do the nasty deed himself.</p><p>\u201cScrew off, you Salvatore wannabe.\u201d</p><p>With the last of his strength, Caine shoved against the stone floor, pushing himself to the side until he reached the edge of the pit.</p><p>Belatedly realizing his prey was attempting to elude his punishment, Briggs flowed forward, his hands outstretched.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Caine managed a ragged smile. \u201cSee you in hell.\u201d</p><p>One more shove and he was toppling over the edge and into the waiting abyss, the weightless sense of falling not nearly as terrifying as it should have been.</p><p>\u201cStupid prick,\u201d Briggs shouted from above him, his face twisted with fury. \u201cThere\u2019s nowhere you can hide from me.\u201d</p><p>The threat would have been a whole lot scarier if Caine hadn\u2019t been plunging through the darkness at a speed that threatened a crushing, if not outright lethal, landing. Always supposing the pit ever came to an end.</p><p>Perhaps Briggs had a straight connection to hell.</p><p>It would explain so much.</p><p>Expecting flames and brimstone and imps with pitchforks, Caine plummeted for what seemed to be an eternity. But it wasn\u2019t the devil who met him at the bottom of the pit.</p><p>Instead it was stark, unyielding stone.</p><p>A blinding agony blasted through his body as his bones snapped and his insides turned to jelly. For a split second he had time to actually look death in the face, then a blessed darkness rose up to consume him.</p><p>Thank the gods.</p><p>The formal salon of Styx\u2019s mansion was just as flamboyantly beautiful as the upper rooms. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>With delicate furnishings that might very well have come from Versailles, and a Persian carpet that had obviously been woven to perfectly match the gold-and-ivory d\u00e9cor, there was a definite museum vibe to the place.</p><p>Across the room the crimson curtains were pulled aside to reveal the towering windows that stretched the length of one wall, overlooking a sunken garden bathed in moonlight. A lovely view, no doubt, but Harley barely noticed. Hell, if she didn\u2019t notice the massive vampire dressed in leather who leaned against the marble fireplace, or her twin sister she\u2019d thought dead for the past thirty years, a view wasn\u2019t going to capture her attention. No matter how magnificent.</p><p>Pacing from one end of the long room to the other, Harley at last came to a halt at the sound of the front doorbell. Darcy tossed her a reassuring smile as she headed into the foyer. Harley caught the unmistakable scent of vampire and...human?</p> <p>Somehow she thought a goddess would have her own unique scent.</p><p>Her confusion only deepened as Darcy returned with the two strangers.</p><p>Dante was easily recognizable as a vampire. Pale perfect features. Long black hair pulled into a tail at his nape. Silver eyes that flashed with a bad-boy glint. Yummy body dressed in white satin shirt and black Chinos.</p><p>But who would ever guess the tiny honey-haired woman with astonishing blue eyes and impish grin was a powerful goddess?</p><p>She waited in silence as Darcy urged Abby toward her while Dante sauntered toward the waiting Styx.</p> <p>\u201cHarley, this is Abby.\u201d Darcy performed the introductions with a broad smile. \u201cAbby, my sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the Chalice?\u201d Harley demanded before she could halt the words.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d With a grimace, Abby ran a hand down her casual sundress. \u201cI\u2019m always such a disappointment. You\u2019d think that if I have to be a goddess, I would at least get a crown and scepter.\u201d</p><p>Belatedly realizing just how rude she must sound, Harley blushed, but thankfully Darcy was swift to take charge of the awkward conversation.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what a queen\u2019s supposed to have, although mine must still be in the mail,\u201d she teased, obviously a BFF with the goddess. \u201cYou should have a halo or a glowy gown.\u201d</p><p>Abby laughed. \u201cInstead I have split ends and PMS.\u201d</p> <p>Darcy nodded her head in sympathetic understanding. \u201cThank you for coming. I hope my mate wasn\u2019t too overbearing in his invitation?\u201d</p><p>Abby glanced toward the two men who were strolling in their direction.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m accustomed to vampires. If they aren\u2019t being overbearing, then I know something\u2019s truly wrong. Unfortunately, I\u2019m not sure how much help I can be. This whole goddess gig is still new to me, and I spend most of my time just trying to avoid causing mass chaos.\u201d</p><p>The two vampires moved to stand at the side of their mates, each wrapping a possessive arm around the women they so clearly adored.</p><p>Harley pretended she didn\u2019t notice that she was standing by herself. Or that her heart was clenching with something perilously close to envy.</p><p>She didn\u2019t need a man standing at her side, bristling and flashing fang if anyone came too close. She could take care of herself, thank you very much.</p><p>\u201cYou have no sense of a disturbance?\u201d Styx asked, his alarming gaze trained on Abby. \u201cA demon lord would not be able to entirely disguise his powers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe problem is that I\u2019m not really sure what a disturbance would feel like,\u201d Abby ruefully confessed. \u201cA pity that becoming the Chalice didn\u2019t come with a user\u2019s manual.\u201d</p> <p>Dante tugged her protectively close. \u201cWe all know you are doing your best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you noticed anything out of the ordinary?\u201d Styx pressed, impervious to his fellow vampire\u2019s growing annoyance.</p><p>One arrogant king was obviously just like another.</p><p>Whether they were vamp or Were.</p><p>Abby shrugged, her expression troubled. \u201cIt\u2019s not out of the ordinary, but I do sense something I can only describe as...evil. I\u2019ve felt it ever since I became the Chalice, so to be honest, I\u2019ve learned to ignore it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you sense which direction it comes from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can do better than that. I can tell you exactly where it comes from.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe caves where we fought the dark prince.\u201d</p><p>Harley took an instinctive step backwards as the two vamps stiffened in shock. She didn\u2019t know anything about the caves or dark prince, but it clearly struck a nerve.</p><p>\u201cBloody hell,\u201d Dante muttered.</p><p>Abby shivered, nestling closer to her mate. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019ve always dismissed the creepy sensations. I assumed it was some sort of residual nastiness from the mages.\u201d</p><p>Styx narrowed his eyes. \u201cThe mages.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re dead,\u201d Dante said, his voice flat and cold.</p><p>Definitely a story there.</p><p>\u201cUnless they had a backup team,\u201d Abby pointed out.</p><p>The suggestion was enough to make Dante\u2019s fangs lengthen and his silver eyes flash with an eagerness to kill.</p><p>\u201cYou think someone else is trying to open the portal between dimensions?\u201d he demanded of his king.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s possible, although I think it more likely that a demon lord managed to discover an anchor in this world before the portal was closed,\u201d Styx said grimly.</p><p>A chill shot down Harley\u2019s spine. Holy crap. That couldn\u2019t be good.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s an anchor?\u201d Harley asked.</p><p>\u201cA lesser creature who accepts a portion of the demon lord\u2019s power. If the bond is strong enough it would allow the demon to continue to touch this world even after the goddess was summoned, although not directly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe King of Weres,\u201d Harley breathed.</p><p>Darcy regarded her in startled disbelief. \u201cSalvatore?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, the one before him. Mackenzie.\u201d Wrapping her arms around her waist, Harley returned to her pacing, attempting to remember precisely what Salvatore had said about the previous king. \u201cSalvatore suspected that something was wrong with him before he died. But why would a demon lord give a Were power? What\u2019s in it for him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe demon lord is capable of controlling his anchor and forcing him to do his bidding, but more importantly, he can siphon the life force of his victim,\u201d Styx answered.</p><p>Harley came to an abrupt halt. \u201cLife force?\u201d</p><p>Styx shrugged. \u201cChi...soul...whatever you want to call it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd it gives him power?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Darcy moved to grab her hand, her eyes dark with concern. \u201cWhat are you thinking, Harley?\u201d</p><p>An awful, horrible dread curled through the pit of her belly. She met Styx\u2019s searching gaze.</p><p>\u201cCaine always said that Salvatore\u2019s strength came from his position as king. Is that true?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSalvatore is the strongest of the Weres or he would never have been able to claim the throne, but he is able to call on his pack when necessary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, he\u2019s connected to them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course...\u201d Styx bit off his words, his features bleak. \u201cDamn. The bastard has been draining the Weres. That\u2019s why they\u2019ve lost their ancient magic.\u201d</p><p>Dante nodded. \u201cIt would explain a great deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut the previous king is dead, and I can\u2019t believe Salvatore is willing to deal with a demon lord,\u201d Darcy pointed out.</p><p>\u201cHe would never put his people at risk,\u201d Harley snapped, unconsciously rushing to Salvatore\u2019s defense. \u201cIt\u2019s Briggs who has the black magic.\u201d</p><p>Darcy gave her fingers a squeeze, but surprisingly it was Styx who offered reassurance.</p><p>\u201cNo one would suspect Salvatore of sharing power with a demon lord.\u201d His lips twisted in a humorless smile. \u201cHell, he\u2019s far too arrogant to share power with anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich must make him a pain in the ass if there\u2019s a demon lord lurking out there,\u201d Dante said. \u201cNot only does his position as king prevent the bastard from drawing energy from the Were packs, but he has enough innate strength to threaten to bring back the ancient powers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would certainly be a reason for someone to want Salvatore dead,\u201d Styx agreed.</p><p>Dante snorted. \u201cJust one of many.\u201d</p><p>Harley sent him a warning glare. \u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>The vampire lifted his hands in a gesture of peace, his earrings glinting in the light of the Venetian chandeliers. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one gets to kill him but me,\u201d she informed her companions, pulling away from Darcy as she was struck by the sudden, vicious sensation that Salvatore was in trouble. God. It might be ridiculous, but she could physically feel his pain. \u201cAs soon as I track him down. So if you\u2019ll excuse me. I really have to go.\u201d</p><p>She was headed toward the door when Styx moved to stand directly in her path.</p><p>\u201cWait, Harley.\u201d</p><p>With no choice, she came to a halt. She might like to think of herself as a badass, but she wasn\u2019t suicidal enough to try to wrestle her way past the most dangerous demon in all the world.</p><p>\u201cPlease, I\u2019ve wasted too much time already,\u201d she whispered. The need to get to Salvatore was becoming downright unbearable. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhen I spoke with Salvatore, he said that the Were pursuing the two of you was a projection.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s any less dangerous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but it does mean that his physical body has to be somewhere. My bet would be that he\u2019s remaining close to the protection of his master.\u201d</p> <p>She frowned, attempting to follow his logic. \u201cThe caves?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s strange,\u201d Abby muttered. \u201cWhy would this demon lord choose the same place to hide as the dark prince?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose it\u2019s possible that a portion of the dark magic lingers and attracts evil. Or maybe the mages chose the location because the barrier between dimensions is thinner there. We shall soon discover.\u201d Styx grasped her shoulders. \u201cWill you join us, Harley?\u201d</p><p>Chapter Seventeen</p> <p>Salvatore had to force himself to enter the labyrinth beneath the abandoned graveyard.</p><p>Dio, he was sick to freaking death of dark, dank tunnels. Once he killed Briggs he intended to spend the next century running beneath open skies.</p><p>Of course, such a cold, miserable setting seemed appropriate for the treacherous pureblood. He was a maggot who deserved to decay alone in the gloomy depths.</p><p>The long tunnel at last spilled into a barren cavern. Salvatore came to a halt, catching the unmistakable stench of rotting flesh.</p><p>His nemesis had to be near.</p><p>\u201c\u2018Welcome to my parlor, said the spider to the fly...\u2019\u201d he muttered as he glanced around the empty cavern with the walls that had been smoothed and polished over the years.</p> <p>\u201cAn apt anthology,\u201d Briggs taunted from the shadows.</p><p>Salvatore grimaced, waiting for the spooky music to be cued. That was all that was lacking to complete the hokey atmosphere.</p><p>\u201cI love what you\u2019ve done with your crib,\u201d he drawled, folding his arms over his chest. \u201cWhat do you call this? Post-Neanderthal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt serves my current purpose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what purpose would that be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo watch you die.\u201d</p><p>Salvatore shook his head. He\u2019d spent too long being jerked around by enemies who manipulated him from the shadows. This ended now.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe you.\u201d</p> <p>The chill in the air thickened. \u201cYou don\u2019t think I intend to kill you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think there has to be a hell of a lot more to it than just my death. You would never have gone to the trouble of kidnapping Harley and her sisters, or using Caine to keep me distracted if you were going to kill me.\u201d Salvatore shrugged. \u201cAt least not if you are as powerful as you claim to be. You could have struck me dead in Rome after your miraculous rising from the grave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s been so much fun watching you chase your tail,\u201d Briggs mocked, still keeping himself hidden behind his black magic.</p><p>\u201cNo doubt priceless entertainment,\u201d Salvatore said dryly, \u201cbut hardly worth wasting decades when you could have been sitting on the throne.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy motives are none of your concern.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut they weren\u2019t your motives, were they, Briggs? You\u2019re nothing more than a toady dancing to someone else\u2019s tune.\u201d</p><p>Through the darkness, Salvatore heard the rasp of Briggs\u2019s infuriated breath.</p><p>\u201cTut, tut, Salvatore,\u201d he said, his voice tight. \u201cBe careful you don\u2019t annoy me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr what? You\u2019ll talk me to death?\u201d Salvatore sneered. \u201cToo late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want more action? Very well. Your wish is my command.\u201d</p><p>Salvatore lowered his arms, bracing for the attack. He had churned over the endless reasons he might have been lured to these caves since Briggs had demanded he come here. He hadn\u2019t come to a logical conclusion\u2014surprise, surprise\u2014but he was certain as hell that it wasn\u2019t going to be good for his health.</p><p>Still waiting for an unseen blow, Salvatore was caught off guard when there was an odd shimmer in the center of the room, and then the darkness seemed to part, like curtains being pulled back to reveal a stage.</p><p>With a frown, he watched as Briggs came into view. It wasn\u2019t the projection of his physical body that Salvatore was expecting. This was more of a...window. A glimpse of Briggs as he stood somewhere else.</p><p>Somewhere in the caves, Salvatore decided. Although that didn\u2019t precisely narrow down the possibilities. Even his limited ability to sense dark, creepy places could tell that the spiderweb of tunnels and caves were extensive.</p><p>Then Briggs gave a wave of his hand, and the vision widened to reveal that he was standing in a cave similar to the one to where Salvatore lingered. All bare rock and medieval torches. But that wasn\u2019t what captured Salvatore\u2019s attention.</p><p>No, it was the sight of the familiar Were who was kneeling at Briggs\u2019s feet, his blond head bowed, his slender body wrapped in heavy silver chains.</p><p>Max.</p><p>Salvatore clenched his hands in impotent fury. He\u2019d been prepared from the moment he caught the scent of his servants outside the graveyard to have them used against him. But that didn\u2019t make the sight of Max being tortured any easier.</p><p>\u201cYou spineless coward,\u201d Salvatore hissed. \u201cIf you want to fight, then face me like a man.\u201d</p><p>Briggs laughed as he casually reached down to backhand the cur, snapping back his head and sending a spray of blood flying through the air.</p><p>\u201cMy house, my rules.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want from me?\u201d</p><p>The crimson eyes flashed with the sort of impressive fury that took centuries to nurture.</p><p>\u201cI want you to suffer before you die,\u201d he hissed, grabbing Max by the hair and viciously shaking him. \u201cI want you to watch as I torture your servants. I want you to know that once I take your throne, I\u2019ll destroy everything you loved or cared for in your life.\u201d</p><p>The king in him demanded that he try to negotiate with the Were. It might piss him off to admit that Briggs held the upper hand, but for the moment it was the unfortunate truth.</p><p>The wolf in him, however, snapped.</p><p>A member of his pack was under attack, and it was his place as alpha to protect him.</p><p>\u201cNo, you bastard. I\u2019m done with your games,\u201d he gritted, heading across the cavern to the tunnel on the other side. \u201cYou can\u2019t hide from me any longer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStay where you are or I\u2019ll kill him, Salvatore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot if I rip out your heart first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSalvatore. Come back. Salvatore.\u201d</p><p>Ignoring the furious commands, Salvatore charged through the darkness, his skin prickling and the glow of his eyes bathing the stone walls in shades of gold.</p><p>His wolf clawed to get out, eager for the taste of blood in his mouth and the feel of flesh tearing beneath his claws. His animal half was ready and eager to wreak havoc among his enemies.</p><p>Following the twisting tunnels ever deeper into the earth, Salvatore savagely beat back his beast.</p><p>Soon enough he would rip Briggs into tiny shreds and feed him to the rats. For now he had to keep his priorities straight.</p><p>Rescue his curs.</p><p>Discover who was behind the nefarious plot.</p><p>Mutilate and destroy Briggs.</p><p>In that order.</p><p>Passing through empty caverns, some obviously having been used as living spaces in the past and others as grim prisons, he ignored the strange energy in the air that muted his senses. He might not be able to follow Briggs\u2019s scent, but the spineless worm couldn\u2019t hide the nasty iciness that clung to him like a shroud.</p><p>Following the growing chill in the air, Salvatore at last came close enough to the bastard to smell the stench of rotting flesh.</p><p>He slowed, entering the large cavern with a stone altar and burning brazier set in the middle of the floor.</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re here,\u201d he growled, checking the nooks and crannies that were shrouded in heavy darkness. The chill was thick enough to give him frostbite. \u201cBriggs? I can smell your cowardice.\u201d</p><p>Briggs\u2019s laugh echoed through the cavern. \u201cAlways so full of yourself, Salvatore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen come out of the shadows and let\u2019s put an end to this.\u201d The words had barely left Salvatore\u2019s lips when there was the sound of shuffling feet and Hess made an appearance from behind a stalagmite\u2014or was it stalactite?\u2014whatever. The important thing was the rigid expression on his servant\u2019s face, and the blank emptiness in his eyes as he charged directly toward Salvatore. \u201cShit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t blame me if you don\u2019t like the game,\u201d Briggs countered in sly tones, taking obvious enjoyment in watching Salvatore scramble to avoid Hess\u2019s attack.</p><p>Muttering beneath his breath, Salvatore crouched and watched as Hess abruptly shifted into his wolf form.</p><p>Cristo. This was exactly what he hoped to avoid. His soldier was completely under the thrall of Briggs, helpless to do anything but what the damned bastard commanded.</p><p>With a fluid movement, he jerked free the knife he\u2019d tucked into his ankle holster before heading for these caves. It was silver, but it would do less damage than the silver bullets he\u2019d loaded in his handgun.</p><p>Or at least that was the plan.</p><p>Balanced on the balls of his feet, Salvatore was prepared when Hess jumped forward, his massive jaws snapping at his head. Jerking back to avoid the fangs that could easily rip out his throat, Salvatore brought the knife upward, slicing a thin wound through the cur\u2019s upper chest. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He wanted to stop Hess with as little damage as possible.</p><p>Of course, what he wanted and what he got was rarely the same.</p><p>With the scratch of claws on stone, Hess scrambled to turn and squatted down as he prepared to pounce. The acrid scent of burned flesh filled the air, but Salvatore only had to glance at Hess with his eyes flashing crimson and his lips curled back in a snarl to know it was going to take more than a scratch to end this battle.</p> <p>He clenched his teeth and prepared for another assault. He didn\u2019t have to wait long.</p><p>Familiar enough with his finest soldier\u2019s tactics, Salvatore was prepared when he feinted a strike high and then darted low to attempt to circle round and hamstring him. He swiftly turned and slashed with the knife, catching Hess on the muzzle.</p><p>The cur whined as the silver bit deep into his flesh, the blood flowing, his flesh burned by the silver. Shaking his head in a pained motion, Hess appeared briefly defeated, then with a sudden leap he hit Salvatore directly in the chest, knocking him to the ground.</p><p>Salvatore managed to yank his head to the side, avoiding the snapping teeth, but it left him vulnerable and he howled in pain as Hess sank his fangs into his shoulder. The cur tore a chunk of flesh from him before Salvatore managed to get a grip on the cur\u2019s thick coat, and with a savage thrust tossed him against the wall.</p><p>There was a nasty crunch as Hess hit his head against the unrelenting stone, falling boneless to the ground.</p> <p>\u201cAh. What a beautiful sight,\u201d Briggs hissed as Salvatore lay flat on his back, the wound in his shoulder deep enough to take an effort to heal. \u201cThe mighty King of Weres wallowing in the dirt. Exactly where he belongs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cScrew you,\u201d Salvatore muttered, swallowing his whimper of pain as he forced himself to his feet.</p><p>Instinctively his gaze went to the cur lying broken and bleeding on the hard stone. Hess. He lived, but he was seriously injured. Just another motivation to hunt down Briggs and make him pay for ever crawling out of his revolting grave.</p><p>Moving across the cavern, Salvatore hissed in frustration. His head ached from where it had bounced off the ground and his shoulder continued to leak blood as the flesh struggled to knit back together. The uncompleted mating bond was making it difficult to repair his injuries, but he wasn\u2019t going to wait.</p><p>Briggs had to be close.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t have held Hess in thrall unless he was.</p> <p>Which meant that this time, he wasn\u2019t going to escape.</p><p>Trusting his instincts, he clutched the knife tight in his hand and circled the edge of the cavern.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no one left to hide behind,\u201d he taunted, using the increasing cold to lead him toward a connected cave.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t fear you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou always were an idiot,\u201d Salvatore muttered, his skin prickling as a foul clamminess washed over him. God Almighty. Briggs was just...wrong. \u201cCome out, come out, wherever you are.\u201d He abruptly halted, the overwhelming stench of rotting flesh breaking through the spell that had been muting it. \u201cBingo.\u201d</p><p>There was a cold rush of air and instinctively Salvatore ducked, growling as the sword whistled less than an inch above his head.</p><p>He\u2019d been expecting magic, not mundane weapons.</p><p>And nearly got his head chopped off.</p> <p>With a furious howl, Salvatore shifted.</p><p>Heat and magic poured through his body, altering and changing him from the inside out. His bones popped, his muscles thickened, and his skin shivered as his heavy pelt flowed over his body. A combination of pain and bliss exploded through him at the transformation.</p><p>It was a sensation that Weres craved like a drug.</p><p>The prickles in the air warned that Briggs was shifting as well, and Salvatore was prepared when the pureblood charged, knocking him to the ground. Turning his head, he sank his fangs into the wolf\u2019s front leg and was rewarded by a shrill yip.</p><p>His satisfaction vanished as the Were\u2019s blood, tainted with decay, spilled into his mouth. Dio. He tasted as bad as he smelled.</p><p>And that was saying something.</p><p>Releasing his grip, Salvatore gained his feet in time to dodge the teeth snapping at his throat. He growled, the days of frustrated fury searing through him as he coiled his muscles and attacked.</p><p>The cold that shrouded Briggs bit into Salvatore like tiny ice daggers, but he ignored the stinging pain, far more concerned with the savage swipe of the Were\u2019s massive claws and the fangs that were desperate to rip out his throat.</p><p>He was beyond battle tactics and campaign strategies.</p><p>This was going to be raw power against whatever vile magic Briggs could conjure.</p><p>Salvatore barreled straight into his opponent, sending them both rolling over the hard ground. He accidently hit the lump already forming on the back of his skull, and stabbed a sharp rock into his hind leg as they skidded across the empty cave, but his teeth managed to slice a deep gash in Briggs\u2019s chest before the Were blasted Salvatore with an invisible flare of magic.</p><p>Salvatore flew through the air, smacking into the wall with enough force to rattle his teeth. He was back on his feet in a heartbeat and charging across the floor of the cave without feeling his injuries. He\u2019d waited for this moment for days.</p><p>Hell, he\u2019d waited for years, although he hadn\u2019t known it was Briggs he was hunting. Nothing was going to stop him now.</p><p>Briggs darted to the side, no doubt trying to summon another burst of magic, but Salvatore again slammed into his wolf form. Screw this magic shit. He rolled Briggs closer to the opening of the cave, using his heavier body to firmly trap the Were beneath him. Then, before Briggs could guess his intention, Salvatore shifted back to human form, grabbing the knife he\u2019d dropped earlier and plunging the silver blade into Briggs\u2019s chest.</p><p>It was a risk.</p><p>Salvatore didn\u2019t have a clue if he could kill the already dead Were. But he intended to give it his best shot.</p><p>He twisted the knife deeper, searching for a heart and listening with grim pleasure as Briggs\u2019s breath became a rattle. The pureblood\u2019s lips pulled back in a snarl, clearly in pain, if not actually dying.</p><p>The silver burned through Briggs\u2019s flesh, at last forcing him to shift back to his gaunt, fragile human body.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d The crimson gaze shifted over Salvatore\u2019s shoulder, as if searching for someone. \u201cMaster.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to wait so your big bad master can come save you?\u201d Salvatore sneered. \u201cOr do you prefer the whole resurrection process?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll never allow you to harm me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m willing to test that theory.\u201d</p><p>Yanking out the dagger, Salvatore was on the point of driving it back into the narrow chest that was already bleeding in a strange, sluggish way when there was the sound of a low hiss from behind him.</p><p>Salvatore jerked around, prepared for whatever was coming.</p><p>Except...nothing was coming.</p><p>At least nothing he could see or touch.</p><p>Was he jumping at shadows?</p><p>The thought had barely passed through his mind when a strange mist swirled around his head, and the sound of a bell echoed through his brain.</p><p>That was the last thing he remembered.</p><p>Salvatore discovered coming back to his senses was a slow, unpleasant process.</p><p>His head was groggy, his mouth as dry as the Sahara, and his entire body blazed with an agony that was explained once he opened his eyes to find he was currently stretched out on the stone altar, and held in place with a thick silver chain that wrapped around his body from his neck to his ankles.</p><p>Lifting his aching head a few inches off the hard stone, he took inventory of his situation, his breath hissing through his teeth as he noticed his own silver dagger stuck into his upper thigh. WTF? The chain was frying his skin with such intensity he hadn\u2019t even noticed the damned dagger in his leg.</p><p>His brows snapped together as he watched the steady trickle of his blood flow into a tiny trough that had been carved along the edge of the altar. Pooling at the bottom of the table, the blood slowly dribbled into the brazier below his feet, the blazing fire hissing with each drip.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d he muttered, his gaze searching the seemingly empty cavern.</p><p>He didn\u2019t know how long he\u2019d been out, or where Briggs had disappeared to, or how he\u2019d been carted back to this cave and trussed up like a sacrificial lamb.</p><p>All he knew was that he was in a boatload of trouble.</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately, my servant is correct,\u201d an unfamiliar voice filled the cavern, powerful and yet oddly muffled, as if it were speaking through water. \u201cAs much as I have enjoyed watching you teach Briggs a lesson in humility, I still have need of him.\u201d</p><p>Genuine, undiluted alarm clenched Salvatore\u2019s stomach.</p><p>Whoever had hog-tied him wasn\u2019t any normal demon. The magic that hummed in the air was enough to make his hair stand on end.</p><p>\u201cAnd you are?\u201d he gritted, refusing to give into the urge to panic.</p><p>\u201cNilapalsara.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry. Doesn\u2019t ring a bell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s an ancient and revered name, although in this world I was worshipped as Balam,\u201d the stranger smoothly answered, indifferent to Salvatore\u2019s taunting.</p><p>His heart slammed against his aching ribs, his hands clenching at his sides.</p><p>\u201cDemon lord.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou seem surprised.\u201d</p><p>Surprised? Not the word he was looking for.</p><p>\u201cYou were banned from this world.\u201d</p> <p>Painful prickles raced over his skin. \u201cThe goddess certainly did her best to be rid of me. Thankfully, I possessed a deep and intimate connection to this dimension.\u201d</p><p>Salvatore grimaced. \u201cMackenzie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you trick him into accepting your bond?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was no trick.\u201d There was the faintest hint of superiority in the voice, as if the demon lord wasn\u2019t entirely above petty emotions. \u201cThe pureblood sought me out when it became obvious that he wasn\u2019t the next in line for the throne.\u201d</p> <p>Salvatore desperately wanted to deny the claim. The mere thought that a Were would sacrifice his people for his own gain went against everything purebloods held sacred. But he\u2019d already accepted the previous king\u2019s treachery.</p><p>What was the point in playing dumb?</p><p>\u201cYou gave him the power to kill the legitimate heirs?\u201d he instead said.</p><p>\u201cI like to encourage ambition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlind greed is not the same as ambition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps not to you, but they both suit my purpose.\u201d</p> <p>It was that mysterious purpose that was bothering Salvatore. Demon lords didn\u2019t grant favors out of the kindness of their black hearts. Ignoring the ravaging pain and the sickening hiss of his life blood dripping into the flames, he struggled to think clearly.</p><p>\u201cMackenzie was given the black magic necessary to steal the throne; what did you get out of the deal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe allowed me access to this world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere had to be more...\u201d Salvatore ground his teeth as realization abruptly hit. Dio. How the hell had he been so dense? \u201cYou used Mackenzie to drain the souls of all Weres. You\u2019re responsible for the loss of our powers.\u201d</p><p>The demon lord\u2019s laughter echoed through the cavern. The sound was perhaps the creepiest thing Salvatore had ever heard.</p><p>\u201cVery good, Giuliani. It took Mackenzie centuries to at last realize I was able to call on his connection to the packs.\u201d</p><p>Salvatore bit back his smart-ass comment as Balam\u2019s words sank through the fuzziness in his brain.</p><p>He\u2019d never been close to Mackenzie, and after it was known that he was to be the next king, the older Were had become downright surly toward him. But there had been something different about him in the last few years of his life.</p> <p>He was still secretive and bad-tempered and prone to treat Salvatore as the enemy, but looking back, Salvatore was beginning to suspect that Mackenzie had come to regret his choices.</p><p>Could he actually have been loyal in the end?</p><p>\u201cAnd when he discovered you were draining the Weres, he tried to cut off your supply,\u201d he accused.</p><p>The air thickened with a tangible anger. \u201cHis last futile act as king.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI assume Briggs murdered him before he could break your bond?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuch delicious irony. Mackenzie was horrified when it was discovered his son was not to be the next in line for the throne, and he was the one to bring Briggs to me for the power to defeat you.\u201d</p><p>Salvatore made a startled sound. Weres were more animal than human when it came to family. The entire pack raised the cubs, and bloodlines had no substantial meaning. Each pureblood was expected to prove themselves, not rely on their parents or grandparents to give them worth.</p><p>\u201cHe brought Briggs to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and in the end Briggs used the power to kill his own father.\u201d</p><p>He growled deep in his throat. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t so lucky against me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I will admit, I underestimated your power.\u201d</p><p>Salvatore was certain that the demon lord didn\u2019t intend to make that mistake again.</p><p>\u201cI would be a lot more flattered if you hadn\u2019t planned for Briggs to kill me and take my throne,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cIt was nothing personal. You were an obstacle that needed to be disposed of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing personal?\u201d Salvatore snorted. \u201cI happen to take attempted murder very personally, but maybe that\u2019s just me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd yet, here you are.\u201d</p><p>Something in the dark voice set off yet another rash of alarms in Salvatore. Astonishing he could feel anything beyond the scorching agony of the silver chains and his strength that was fading with every drip of blood.</p><p>\u201cYes, here I am,\u201d he rasped. \u201cOdd. After Briggs\u2019s abysmal failure to rid the world of my presence, I would have thought you would have sent a new assassin. Briggs isn\u2019t the only one who would be happy to see me dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy power in this world was limited when the goddess was summoned, and nearly destroyed when Mackenzie died, leaving me without the ability to call upon the Weres\u2019 energy.\u201d The demon lord surprisingly answered. No doubt he enjoyed revealing his clever scheme. \u201cTo bring Briggs back from the grave took years to accomplish, and drained me of what few powers I had left.\u201d</p><p>Salvatore grimaced. He at least knew why it had taken so long for Briggs to pull his Lazareth act, but it wasn\u2019t particularly reassuring to think he\u2019d been so easily bested by an impotent demon lord.</p><p>\u201cObviously not all your powers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, yes, a little gift from the mages who once worshipped the dark prince in these caves.\u201d</p><p>Salvatore swallowed a soft moan, his thoughts threatening to scramble at the relentless pain. He knew something about mages and caves, didn\u2019t he? Something about Dante\u2019s mate becoming the Chalice.</p><p>\u201cThe vampires killed the mages,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cTrue, they failed in their efforts to kill the goddess and return their master, but their devoted sacrifices over the past decades have thinned the barrier between dimensions. When I recovered enough to once again touch this world, I realized that you might be far more valuable alive than dead.\u201d</p><p>Somehow, Salvatore wasn\u2019t remotely reassured.</p><p>There were all sorts of nasty things worse than death.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you send Briggs to raid my nursery?\u201d he demanded, as much to head off the looming panic as to hear the answer to the question that had been nagging at him for the past thirty years.</p><p>\u201cI simply requested that he find the means to lure you closer, while keeping you too distracted to realize you were on our leash.\u201d</p><p>Salvatore gritted his teeth.</p><p>Cristo, he\u2019d been such an imbecile.</p><p>He had wasted years chasing shadows. If only he hadn\u2019t allowed himself to be sidetracked by the missing babies, he might...</p><p>Salvatore abruptly cut short the mental flagellation.</p><p>Even if he hadn\u2019t allowed Briggs to lead him around like a docile sheep, he would never have figured out what was slowly killing the Weres.</p><p>Who the hell would suspect a demon lord? They were supposed to be nothing more than a myth.</p><p>\u201cTaking thirty years to lure me into a trap is a little extreme,\u201d he muttered, his pride as damaged as his body. \u201cAll he had to do was let me know the babies were here, and I would have happily rushed to my own doom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had planned to await this moment until I was once again at full strength.\u201d The flames again flared with annoyance. \u201cUnfortunately, my perfectly devised plan has been threatened by Briggs\u2019s obsessive hatred toward you, and your own annoying interference.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInterference?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t be allowed to mate and bring back the ancient magic,\u201d the dark voice hissed.</p><p>Ah. So he wasn\u2019t going insane.</p><p>The powers were truly returning.</p><p>Salvatore briefly closed his eyes, allowing the wondrous thought of Harley to fill his mind. Instantly the scent of vanilla washed over him, her warmth battling back the ruthless pain as if she were near. Impossible, of course. Still, it was a comfort he readily clung to.</p><p>\u201cSo now you have me here,\u201d he husked. \u201cWhat do you want from me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour blood.\u201d</p><p>Not a big surprise. He glanced down at the dagger stuck in his thigh, draining him like a butchered pig. He had already assumed it was his blood or soul that the demon lord desired.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps I\u2019m not inclined to share.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI fear that\u2019s not going to be an option.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI at least deserve to know what you intend to do with it.\u201d</p><p>The air thickened until Salvatore could barely breathe. \u201cDeserve?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI assume I won\u2019t be around to appreciate the sacrifice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, that much is guaranteed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what\u2019s the harm in sharing?\u201d</p><p>There was a long pause, as if Balam was momentarily distracted, then his low chuckle swirled through the cave. Salvatore shuddered in revulsion.</p><p>\u201cVery well,\u201d the demon lord agreed. \u201cI intend to use your blood to create a portal and enter your world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not use Briggs\u2019s? He would no doubt be thrilled to donate to the cause.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis blood will never possess the potency of yours. A knowledge that has plagued him for centuries.\u201d</p><p>Balam sounded as if he enjoyed Briggs\u2019s frustration at his potency shortfall. So much for honor among thieves. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBut he\u2019s good enough to be your stooge?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor now.

Not for Briggs\u2019s inevitable death at the hands of the demon lord. Good riddance. But the threat that his Weres might become mere fodder for the demon lord was enough to make him howl in anguish.</p><p>He had to find some means of stopping his blood from draining into the brazier.

She obviously needs to learn what happens to naughty Weres who intrude where they don\u2019t belong.\u201d</p><p>Harley.</p><p>How had she followed him? And more importantly, why?</p><p>Dio. He was going to kill Styx for letting her put herself in danger.</p><p>Indifferent to the excruciating pain, he jerked against the binding chains, desperate to get to his mate.</p><p>\u201cYou bastard.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cForgive me, did you desire a tearful good-bye with your beloved?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to kill you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Giuliani, what you\u2019re going to do is set me free.\u201d</p><p>Tilting back his head, Salvatore screamed in terrified fury.</p><p>\u201cHarley.\u201d</p><p>Harley\u2019s nerves were near the breaking point by the time they pulled to a halt at the long forgotten church.</p><p>It could have been the result of being squashed into the Hummer with several very large, very lethal vampires, a full-fledged goddess, and her twin sister. Or even the lightning speed with which they had made the trip.</p><p>But Harley was honest enough to admit that her stomach-clenching stress was entirely due to Salvatore Giuliani.</p> <p>She could feel him, deep inside.</p><p>Like a nagging awareness that refused to leave her in peace.</p><p>Snarling with impatience by the time the vampires had thoroughly scouted the area and at last allowed her to enter the caves, her temper wasn\u2019t improved when she realized there was something suppressing her ability to follow Salvatore\u2019s scent.</p><p>Dammit.</p><p>When she wanted to be alone, she couldn\u2019t get rid of Salvatore.</p><p>Now it seemed as if the entire world was determined to put obstacles in her path.</p><p>Prowling through the upper caverns, Harley waited for Dante to return from his search and rescue mission. As much as it might irritate her, she had been forced to give her word to Styx that she wouldn\u2019t take off on her own.</p><p>On the point of telling Styx he could take her promise and shove it up his ass, her restless pacing was brought to an abrupt halt as Dante silently slid from one of the numerous tunnels and crossed toward Styx and the rest of the motley crew. Harley remained standing several feet away as the sensation of Salvatore continued to pull at her.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d Styx demanded, appearing even more ferocious with the large sword he clutched in his hand. Talk about overkill.</p><p>Dante shook his head, frustration etched on his too-beautiful face.</p><p>\u201cIt will be impossible to track him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can find him,\u201d Harley said, squaring her shoulders as all eyes turned in her direction.</p><p>Darcy lifted her brows in surprise. \u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...feel him.\u201d</p><p>Styx scowled. \u201cThis could be a trick.\u201d</p><p>Harley wasn\u2019t stupid. She\u2019d already considered the possibility that someone or something was messing with her. And a part of her wasn\u2019t entirely adverse to the thought that this was a devious spell. Otherwise she\u2019d have to accept that she had a connection to Salvatore that went way beyond a casual lover.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d she muttered, wrapping her arms around her waist as a cold chill raced over her. Damn, it felt as if the temperature had dropped by a dozen degrees. \u201cI have to do this.\u201d</p><p>Styx shifted his attention to the goddess at his side. \u201cAbby, do you sense anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvil.\u201d Abby shuddered, her face paling to an unhealthy shade of gray. \u201cGod, it\u2019s so thick I can almost taste it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake her home, Dante,\u201d Styx growled.</p><p>Abby jutted her chin. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Dante ran a frustrated hand through his hair. \u201cAbby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is my duty.\u201d Abby pointed a warning finger in her mate\u2019s face. \u201cYou know it.\u201d</p><p>Dante threw his hands in the air. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean I have to like it.\u201d</p><p>Oddly fascinated by the sight of the mighty vampires bending to the will of the tiny woman, Harley was caught off guard by the faint scent that briefly stirred the air.</p><p>Somehow sensing Harley\u2019s sudden surprise, Darcy took a step in her direction.</p><p>\u201cHarley, what is it? Salvatore?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s here.\u201d Harley breathed deeply, shaking her head when the scent evaporated as swiftly as it had appeared. \u201cBut I sense another presence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe demon lord?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s familiar.\u201d Harley deliberately paused. \u201cLike you.\u201d</p><p>Darcy\u2019s eyes widened at the implication another sister might be near.</p><p>\u201cOh, my God. Are you certain?\u201d</p><p>Harley shrugged. The scent had been so fleeting it was impossible to be absolutely certain.</p><p>Moving toward the nearest tunnel, she attempted to determine where the smell had come from when she was struck by a sharp wave of panic.</p><p>She faltered, glancing around in confusion.</p><p>She would swear that Salvatore was attempting to warn her. But of what?</p><p>There was a baffled moment as she simply stood at the mouth of the nearest tunnel, wondering what the hell was going on. Then, as she once again shivered at the thickening chill in the air, realization belatedly hit.</p><p>Briggs.</p><p>Turning her head, she sent her sister a frantic gaze. \u201cRun!\u201d</p><p>Chapter Eighteen</p><p>Harley was remarkably unfazed as the flash of magic exploded through the cavern and the ceiling promptly collapsed. Of course, she\u2019d endured a number of explosions and cave-ins over the past few days. Maybe she was becoming immune to disasters.</p><p>Sending up a quick prayer that the others had managed to escape, she darted into the tunnel and ran from the choking cloud of dust and debris. Only when she was certain that she was beyond the collapsing ceiling did she slow her pace and pay attention to the confusing warren of caves and passageways.</p><p>The burning need to find Salvatore continued to plague her, but she wasn\u2019t stupid enough to rush blindly through the dark. Briggs was somewhere crawling through the shadows, not to mention a demon lord, and who knew what other nasties.</p><p>Contrary to popular opinion, she didn\u2019t need anyone telling her to be careful.</p><p>Pulling the silver knife from the holster her sister had fitted around her ankle before leaving Chicago, Harley allowed the sense of Salvatore that echoed in her blood to lead her through the cold, oddly barren passageways.</p><p>She felt like a damned homing pigeon, she ruefully acknowledged, wondering if Salvatore was deliberately doing something to afflict her with this overwhelming need to find him. That suspicion was certainly preferable to the thought that this growingly desperate urge was coming from her.</p><p>Coming to a halt as the tunnel branched into three separate directions, she hesitated as she caught the faint whiff of cur. It was muted, but unmistakable.</p><p>Alarm raced through her.</p><p>She wanted to believe that the curs were Salvatore\u2019s servants who were here to rescue him, but that would be way too convenient for her current streak of luck. Besides, Salvatore had been adamant in not allowing his pack near. Not when they could be used as a weapon against him.</p><p>Which could only mean that they were either strange curs, or ones under the control of Briggs. And yet another danger to have to worry about.</p><p>Perfect.</p><p>Gripping the knife tightly enough to make her knuckles crack, Harley swallowed her reluctance and forced her feet forward. She wasn\u2019t opposed to killing a few curs who got in her way, but she suspected that Salvatore would blame himself if anything happened to them.</p><p>And that bothered her, why?</p><p>Harley gave a shake of her head. She might as well accept she was currently out of her mind. It would be easier than trying to make sense of her recurring bouts of crazy.</p><p>Prepared for an ambush, Harley cautiously followed the sharp curve in the tunnel, halting in surprise when an oversized, bald-headed cur staggered toward her.</p><p>Her first thought was that he was stark naked, as if he\u2019d recently shifted. Her second thought was that he was taking up way too much space for one man. His shoulders almost brushed each side of the passageway. And if his head hadn\u2019t been bowed and covered by his hands, she suspected it would have been in danger of bumping the ceiling.</p><p>Warily, she watched as he weaved and stumbled toward her, muttering beneath his breath.</p><p>Okaaaay. If this was an ambush, it was the strangest one she\u2019d ever heard of. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The cur had nearly reached her when he belatedly realized he was no longer alone. Jerking his head up, his eyes flashed crimson and his lips curled back in a snarl.</p><p>\u201cJust hold on, Rambo,\u201d Harley held up her hands in a nonthreatening motion. Well, nonthreatening if you didn\u2019t count the big knife. \u201cI don\u2019t want to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>The cur tilted back his face to sniff the air, and Harley realized that he was bleeding from a wound on the temple and that the left side of his face was a painful shade of black and blue. He looked like he\u2019d just come out the loser of a Bully Beatdown.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re not Darcy,\u201d he at last growled.</p><p>\u201cNo shit, Sherlock,\u201d she muttered, not entirely reassured by the knowledge he was familiar with her twin.</p><p>Would she be able to tell if he was under the influence of Briggs?</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d the cur demanded.</p><p>\u201cDarcy\u2019s sister, Harley. And you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHess.\u201d He sucked in a deep breath, coming back from the edge of shifting. Not that he was any less dangerous. \u201cWhy do you smell like Salvatore?\u201d</p><p>Hess. The name clicked into place.</p><p>Salvatore\u2019s most trusted soldier.</p><p>She could see why. He was a freaking mountain of muscle.</p><p>\u201cThe idiot seems to think I\u2019m his mate,\u201d she said.</p><p>His brow furrowed, as if stumped by her explanation. \u201cWeres can\u2019t mate.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, well, that\u2019s something you need to take up with your king.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSalvatore.\u201d Instantly distracted, the cur slammed his fist against the stone wall, his expression twisted with regret. \u201cShit.\u201d</p><p>Harley instinctively stepped back. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI attacked him. Christ, I knew he was my master and I still tried to kill him.\u201d He stepped toward her, his expression wild. \u201cI couldn\u2019t help it. I swear to you, I couldn\u2019t help it.\u201d</p><p>Anger exploded through Harley. Damn Briggs. He had to know that forcing Salvatore to hurt his own pack was the worst torture that Salvatore could endure.</p><p>\u201cSave your pity party for later. I need to find your master,\u201d she snapped, sensing that Hess was in need of a strong leader, not a shoulder to cry on. A good thing. She wasn\u2019t a touchy-feely kind of gal. \u201cWhere did you see him last?\u201d</p><p>As hoped, Hess was jolted out of his shame and squared his shoulders in determination.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure,\u201d he admitted, the muscles of his jaw knotted as he struggled to control his emotions. \u201cHe knocked me out during our fight and when I woke up, he was gone, so I took off. I wasn\u2019t going to risk being used against him again.\u201d</p> <p>Which explained the bruises and his stumbling.</p><p>\u201cHow did you get here in the first place?\u201d</p><p>He growled, his eyes flashing red. \u201cCaine.\u201d</p><p>Stupidly, Harley was caught off guard. It wasn\u2019t that she thought Caine was above using and abusing his fellow curs. He was so lost in his delusions of grandeur that he was willing to sacrifice anyone and anything to make his vision come true. But he usually preferred to leave the grunt work to others.</p><p>Precious Caine didn\u2019t like to get his hands dirty.</p><p>\u201cSomeday soon I\u2019m going to rip out his treacherous heart,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>\u201cNot if I find him first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid Caine kidnap anyone but you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree others.\u201d</p><p>Harley grimaced. \u201cWhere are they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe cur had us in silver cages before the whacko Were came to take me away.\u201d He waved a hesitant hand to the left. \u201cThat way...I think.\u201d</p><p>Harley didn\u2019t fault him for being confused. The place was like an endless maze of barren stone.</p><p>\u201cGo find them and get them out of here,\u201d she commanded.</p><p>Hess instantly bristled. \u201cNo, if you are the mate of Salvatore, he\u2019d kill me if I let something happen to you.\u201d</p><p>Harley swallowed the urge to tell him exactly what he could do with his macho bullshit. It didn\u2019t matter that she could kick this cur\u2019s ass with one hand tied behind her back. Just because she had a uterus rather than a cock meant he had to protect her.</p><p>Instead, she simply outwitted him.</p><p>Not a particularly difficult task.</p><p>\u201cDo you truly think you would be of any use to me if Briggs decides to take control of you again?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>Hess scowled. \u201cHe won\u2019t...\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, we\u2019re wasting time,\u201d she interrupted, her tone warning he was taking his life in his hands to argue with her. \u201cYou know that it isn\u2019t safe for you to be around Briggs.\u201d</p><p>Hess folded his hands over his massive chest. \u201cHow do you know he can\u2019t control you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy connection to Salvatore protects me,\u201d she blatantly lied. She wouldn\u2019t let herself consider the possibility. \u201cGo rescue the others.\u201d</p><p>There was a brittle silence, then with a foul curse, Hess swept past her, headed for the entrance of the tunnel.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to be pissed if you get yourself killed and I\u2019m blamed,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>Harley rolled her eyes. \u201cI\u2019ll keep that in mind.\u201d</p><p>Waiting until she was alone in the tunnel, Harley sucked in a deep breath and continued her nerve-wracking journey. She hated feeling as if she were buried alive in this endless web of caverns. The vamps could have the dark and dank, as far as she was concerned. She wanted the open sky overhead, and a fresh breeze filling her lungs.</p><p>Ignoring the growing chill that prickled over her skin, Harley headed deeper and deeper into the darkness, losing track of time and direction as a creeping sense of claustrophobia threatened to choke her.</p><p>She concentrated on keeping her heartbeat steady and one foot moving in front of the other, her years of training at last coming in handy as she flowed silently through the empty tunnels.</p><p>On the point of turning back and trying another path, Harley caught the unmistakable scent of smoke. It wasn\u2019t exactly proof positive that Salvatore was near, but it was the first indication she wasn\u2019t completely alone in the barren hellhole.</p><p>Following the smoke, Harley slowly entered the large cavern, her heart coming to a complete and perfect halt at the sight of Salvatore laid out on a stone altar, his blood dripping into a blazing brazier.</p><p>A savage, astonishingly protective fury ripped through her. Christ, his body was being destroyed by the heavy silver chains wrapped around him, and his beautiful face...it was dangerously pale from the rapid loss of blood. Dammit. She wanted to rip off Briggs\u2019s head. She wanted to feed his putrid heart to the rats. She wanted...</p><p>Her heart twisted.</p><p>She wanted to snatch Salvatore off the ghastly altar and take him far away from this cavern.</p><p>Checking the impulse to rush across the seemingly empty cave, Harley forced herself to pause and use her brains. Hey, there was a first time for everything.</p><p>Spreading out her senses, she searched for any hint of danger. It should have been simple. Beyond the altar and brazier the vast space appeared to be empty. But she knew from bitter experience that Briggs had the ability to pop in and out without warning.</p><p>When there was no smell of rotting meat and the air remained chilly, but not icy, she took a cautious step forward. She had taken her second step when Salvatore\u2019s head abruptly snapped in her direction, his eyes widening with unexpected panic.</p><p>\u201cHarley, no,\u201d he growled.</p><p>\u201cListen to him, Were,\u201d an ominous voice rasped through the air. \u201cA step closer and I\u2019ll kill him.\u201d</p><p>Harley sucked in a sharp breath, belatedly catching sight of the shadow that hovered above Salvatore.</p><p>She knew instinctively that the...thing wasn\u2019t Briggs using his hocus-pocus. The thick power that suddenly pulsed through the air had nothing to do with Were, and everything to do with pure, undiluted evil.</p><p>This had to be the demon lord that Styx feared.</p><p>Or at least a portion of his essence.</p><p>She briefly stumbled, her mouth dry with sheer terror. Deep in her heart, she understood she was in way over her head. What the hell did she know about battling a demon lord? Or a zombie Were, for that matter.</p><p>Then gritting her teeth, she ignored her perfectly reasonable fear and instead concentrated on the scent of Salvatore that at last broke through the dampening spell.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to kill him anyway,\u201d she accused, continuing forward.</p><p>\u201cTrue, but you can save your own life,\u201d the voice promised. \u201cJust turn and walk away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDio, Harley, do as he says,\u201d Salvatore rasped, struggling against the silver chains. \u201cGet out of here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen to your mate, female,\u201d the demon lord warned.</p><p>\u201cGo to hell,\u201d she muttered, her gut clenching as Salvatore abruptly screamed in agony, his body contorting as if it were being tortured by an unseen enemy. \u201cShit. Just hang on, Salvatore. Do you hear me?\u201d</p><p>Despite his obvious pain, Salvatore\u2019s golden gaze never wavered from her.</p><p>\u201cPlease, go. I can\u2019t bear...\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up, Your Majesty. I\u2019m not leaving.\u201d</p><p>Unable to halt her by punishing Salvatore, the demon lord turned his attention in Harley\u2019s direction. She was mere steps from the altar when a bolt of energy smashed into her with enough force to send her to her knees. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Salvatore cried out. \u201cHarley.\u201d</p><p>She pushed herself upright, jerking as another bolt slammed into her. Pain exploded through her body, but she refused to go down. Just a few more steps. And then...</p><p>Then what?</p> <p>She didn\u2019t have a clue what she was going to do when she actually reached Salvatore, she only knew that she had to get to him.</p><p>Jagged shards of agony burrowed into her bones, making her movements awkward, and black spots danced before her eyes, nearly blinding her. Distantly she could hear Salvatore\u2019s ragged breaths and the low moans that were coming from her own throat, but she refused to focus on anything but putting one foot in front of another.</p><p>Demon lord or not, she was too damned stubborn to concede defeat.</p><p>There was blood dripping from a dozen small wounds, and Harley suspected that more than one bone was cracked by the time she at last reached the altar.</p><p>Once there, she realized that Salvatore looked even worse than she felt.</p> <p>The dark hair was matted with blood, and his face was an alarming shade of gray. And his poor body...</p><p>She shuddered at the charred flesh, unable to imagine the agony he must be enduring.</p><p>Instinctively she reached to offer comfort, her hand lightly touching his shoulder.</p><p>Her fingers had barely brushed his skin when the black shadow that had wrapped around her gave a bloodcurdling scream. Harley leaned protectively over Salvatore, convinced that her eardrums were about to shatter.</p><p>What the hell was the matter with the thing?</p><p>Trying to prepare for whatever the demon lord intended to throw at them, Harley barely noticed the tingling sensation beneath her palm. Why would she? She tingled whenever she touched Salvatore.</p> <p>But as the tingling became more pronounced and a strange heat raced up her arm and through her body, Harley pulled back to meet Salvatore\u2019s startled gaze.</p><p>The shadow that had been tormenting her had seemingly vanished, although Harley didn\u2019t believe for a moment that it had truly disappeared. No doubt it was revving up for something even more horrible. But for the moment, she couldn\u2019t concentrate on anything except the warm awareness that flooded through her.</p><p>Good...God.</p><p>Her wolf impatiently prowled beneath her skin, growling with a need she didn\u2019t understand. It was as if her beast were anxiously searching for something just out of reach.</p><p>Shivering, she met Salvatore\u2019s glowing golden gaze. She could sense the power of his wolf reaching out to her, brushing over her skin and cloaking her in his familiar heat. But more than that, she could feel him flowing through her fingertips and into her bloodstream.</p><p>Like warm honey, the feeling of Salvatore poured through her, marking her in the most intimate way possible. Harley made a sound of shock, but deep inside, her wolf howled in satisfaction, the restless ache that had plagued her being replaced by a stunning sense of...rightness.</p><p>She was whole.</p><p>Complete.</p> <p>The thought had barely passed through her aching brain when she realized there was more than just the essence of Salvatore racing through her blood. There was his power. More power than she\u2019d ever dreamed possible.</p><p>Charging full throttle through her body, it washed away her weariness and healed her wounds at record speed.</p><p>With a moan, she leaned against the altar, struggling to remain upright as her bones mended and her flesh knit back together at an insane rate. Holy crap. The patching up hurt nearly as much as the initial injury.</p><p>At last the deluge of power settled to something bearable, and sucking in a steadying breath, Harley straightened enough to stab Salvatore with a suspicious frown.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell just happened?\u201d</p><p>Salvatore smiled with smug satisfaction. \u201cExactly what you think happened.\u201d</p><p>The mating.</p><p>It was complete.</p><p>\u201cOh, shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo late for regrets, cara.\u201d</p><p>She bit back the urge to tell him that this mating didn\u2019t change a thing between them. Although Salvatore had done his own share of healing, the silver chains continued to burn his flesh and sap his energy.</p><p>\u201cIt might be too late, period, if we don\u2019t get out of here,\u201d she muttered, her attention shifting to the large silver lock that held the chains in place.</p><p>For all the power that tingled through her, she didn\u2019t think she could free him with her bare hands.</p><p>As if reading her mind, Salvatore jerked his head toward the shadows behind the altar.</p><p>\u201cSee if you can find Briggs\u2019s stash of weapons. He\u2019s always had an obsession with big swords. No doubt to compensate for what he lacked in other areas.\u201d</p><p>Harley shook her head. They didn\u2019t have time for her to go on a treasure hunt. Already the black mist was beginning to form over the flames of the brazier. She had to get Salvatore loose, and she had to do it now.</p><p>\u201cI have a better idea,\u201d she muttered, bending down to lift a heavy rock from the base of the altar.</p><p>Holding the rock in one hand, she grabbed the lock, hissing as it instantly blistered her skin.</p><p>Salvatore struggled against the chains, his face tight with frustration.</p><p>\u201cMerda, you\u2019ll hurt yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTurn your head away.\u201d</p><p>It was the only warning she gave him before she set the lock against the stone altar and lifted the rock to smash the stupid thing over and over. Sparks flew and the sharp sound echoed through the cavern, but with stoic persistence, Harley at last beat the lock to a mangled bit of metal that fell away from the chains with a reluctant clunk.</p><p>With a harsh growl, Salvatore shoved the loosened chains off him and leaped from the altar. Then, yanking the knife out of his upper thigh, he glanced at the smashed lock at his feet.</p><p>\u201cRemind me not to piss you off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo late,\u201d she muttered, anxious to get the hell out of the caves. She had reached the end of her tolerance for dark, cramped places and vicious enemies who enjoyed causing pain. \u201cI think that blob of a demon lord is trying to make an encore performance.\u201d</p><p>With a nod, Salvatore clutched the knife and began to head back toward the opening of the cavern.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get the hell out of here.\u201d</p><p>On creepy cue, the blob shifted away from the brazier and headed directly toward them.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d the demon lord hissed. \u201cWe have not yet finished our business, Giuliani.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, we\u2019re finished,\u201d Salvatore growled, shoving Harley behind him as the mist swooped downward and attacked.</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d Harley flinched as the pain smacked into her with the force of a freight train. \u201cHow are we supposed to fight this stupid thing?\u201d</p><p>Salvatore shoved the knife into the heart of the mist, making it shudder and pull back, but only for a moment. Before they could run, it was returning for another attack.</p><p>\u201cHe was taking his power from my blood,\u201d Salvatore gritted.</p><p>Blood? Harley glanced back at the altar, realizing that the blood Salvatore had lost was pooled in a small cavity at the end of the altar and continued a steady drip into the flames.</p><p>She didn\u2019t know jack squat about demon lords, but she had to try something.</p><p>\u201cKeep him busy,\u201d she ordered Salvatore, making a dash toward the brazier.</p><p>Slashing at the mist with his knife, Salvatore snarled when the flames shot directly toward her.</p><p>\u201cHarley.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust me.\u201d</p><p>She tried again to approach the brazier, only to be driven back by the fierce heat. Dammit. There had to be a way.</p><p>Turning her attention from the blazing fire, she instead approached the altar. If it was Salvatore\u2019s blood that gave the demon lord his power, then she had to get rid of it.</p><p>Easier said than done.</p><p>She might still be buzzing from the mating with Salvatore, but the altar was massive. It would be nothing less than a miracle to move it by herself.</p><p>She was considering how best to tackle the daunting task when the feel of Salvatore\u2019s pain echoed deep inside her. A glance over her shoulder revealed the black mist had nearly engulfed him.</p><p>As if he sensed her hesitation, he sent her an impatient frown.</p><p>\u201cHarley.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m working on it,\u201d she said, putting her shoulder against the altar and shoving with all her might.</p><p>\u201cWork faster.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you think this mating thing gives you the right to nag at me, then you better think again.\u201d</p><p>Her muscles burned, her legs shaking with the effort to shift the stupid lump of stone. She gained a smidge. Then a half an inch, but she could still hear the relentless drops of blood hitting the flames.</p><p>She gritted her teeth. Her muscles were on fire and her shoulder popped out of joint, but she refused to concede defeat.</p><p>Dammit, this had to work.</p><p>Focused on the altar, Harley barely heard Salvatore when he shouted in warning.</p><p>\u201cLook out.\u201d</p><p>She grunted as the pain slammed into the back of her head, digging through her skull with nauseating force. Her knees went weak and knowing she was losing the battle, she glanced over her shoulders, relieved to discover that Salvatore was already headed in her direction.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to have to do it together,\u201d she gritted.</p><p>Something hot and dangerous flashed in the golden eyes. Something that would have sent Harley fleeing in terror if she hadn\u2019t been distracted by her pesky fear of imminent death. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSi.

There was a shrill scream of fury that filled the cavern, and the pain in Harley\u2019s brain became crippling.</p><p>The demon lord was clearly displeased with their efforts.</p> <p>Which meant it had to be hurting the bastard.</p><p>\u201cMore,\u201d she managed to gasp, sensing they had only moments before the demon lord could gather enough strength to crush them like bugs.</p><p>Salvatore grunted as he placed his hands against the altar and pushed with all he was worth. Which happened to be a great deal. His muscles bulged and the veins of his neck popped out as he added his strength to hers.</p><p>The unnerving screeching continued, and the pain filtered from Harley\u2019s brain down her spine, threatening to drain the last of her strength. But with Salvatore at her side, they managed to keep the pressure on the altar, and with a deafening crack the bottom at last broke free of the stone floor.</p><p>Breathing heavily, Harley watched as the massive stone slowly toppled over, breaking into a dozen pieces. For a moment, Salvatore stood at her side, then with a low curse he turned and kicked the brazier.</p> <p>The flames sputtered, the hot coals spreading across the floor like glowing gems. Immediately the ravaging pain disappeared and with a gasp, Harley sank to her knees.</p><p>\u201cIs it gone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t intend to stick around to find out.\u201d Reaching down, Salvatore scooped her off the ground and headed for the entrance to the cavern. \u201cTime to go.\u201d</p><p>On the point of commanding that he put her down, Harley stiffened as a deep boom echoed through the air and dust trickled down from the ceiling.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t I think that\u2019s a good thing?\u201d she muttered.</p><p>\u201cCristo.\u201d Tucking her against his chest, Salvatore sprinted through the tunnels. \u201cI\u2019m growing tired of having caves falling on my head.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo shit,\u201d she muttered, feeling the tremors that preceded a full-scale collapse. \u201cNext time you piss off a demon lord, could you make sure he has a lair on the Riviera?\u201d</p><p>His laughter echoed off the crumbling walls of the tunnel. \u201cI\u2019ll see what I can do.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Nineteen</p><p>Caine didn\u2019t know how much time had passed when he returned to the land of the living.</p><p>It had to be long enough for the worst of his injuries to have healed, although he wasn\u2019t ready to do any backflips. He was still weak, and his muscles groaned in protest when he forced himself to his feet.</p><p>Glancing up, he studied the tiny opening of the pit far above his head. One thing was for certain. There was no way to get out the way he came in. He was a cur, not a damned bat.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s right about one thing. I am a stupid prick,\u201d he muttered, recalling Briggs\u2019s mocking words as he\u2019d plummeted through the air. \u201cStupid and oh-so-dead. Why did I ever believe that bastard?\u201d He turned his attention to his stark surroundings. \u201cBecause I wanted to believe. I was convinced I was so freaking special. What a joke.\u201d</p><p>With a shake of his head, Caine headed toward the nearest tunnel. He could wallow in self-pity and walk at the same time. God only knew how long it was going to take to find a way out of the hellhole.</p> <p>He traveled through the low tunnels, occasionally slogging through water that tumbled from God only knew where, and more than once he was forced to bend over nearly in half to keep from banging his head.</p><p>All and all, a perfectly miserable journey.</p><p>Over an hour passed before Caine at last caught the scent of something besides damp rocks. Coming to a halt, he peered through the crack in the tunnel wall that revealed a small cave on the other side.</p><p>\u201cHello? Who\u2019s there?\u201d He sucked in a deep breath, testing the air. There it was again. The faint scent of...Were? \u201cHarley?\u201d There was a rustle of sound and he caught the glimpse of a shadow dart past the narrow crack. \u201cShit.\u201d</p><p>Unable to bust his way through the thick wall, Caine splashed down the tunnel, hoping to find an opening into the cave. The smell wasn\u2019t exactly Harley\u2019s, but it was close enough that the Were had to be her relation.</p><p>Why the pureblood would be down here defied his imagination, but the mere hope she might lead him out of the nightmare maze was enough to make him ignore the danger of decapitation from the low ceiling as he dashed recklessly through the dark.</p><p>The scent deepened, the hint of lavender tugging at his senses, leading him down a side tunnel. He didn\u2019t have a clue where he was going, but suddenly finding the Were had become the most important task in his life.</p><p>His pace instinctively slowed as the tunnel ended at the opening to a large cavern.</p><p>Unlike the rest of the lower chambers, he sensed that someone regularly spent time in this area. His gaze scanned the shadows, taking in the shallow stream of water that had cut a groove in the smooth floor, and the stones that had been chiseled to resemble chairs.</p><p>No bat did that bit of sculpting.</p><p>Caine stepped into the cave, already sensing the Were hidden behind one of the larger stalagmites.</p><p>\u201cYou might as well come out,\u201d he commanded.</p><p>There was a tense pause, then with a slow movement, the diminutive pureblood stepped into view.</p><p>The hint of familiarity in her scent had already prepared Caine for the female\u2019s striking resemblance to Harley.</p><p>Her hair was a paler shade, closer to silver than blond, and pulled into a braid that fell to her waist. Her skin was a perfect alabaster, smooth and silken. Her eyes were also lighter, green the color of spring grass and flecked with gold.</p><p>Her face, however, was shaped exactly like Harley\u2019s, and beneath the frayed jeans and sweatshirt her body was slender, but hard with well-honed muscles.</p><p>She had to be one of the four pureblooded females.</p><p>The one that Briggs had taken after they were nearly discovered in Chicago.</p><p>The Were had told him he\u2019d sent her to a cur pack in Indiana. He should have known it was a lie.</p><p>Nothing else that had come out of the bastard\u2019s mouth had been true.</p><p>Staring at him with wide eyes, she tilted her head to the side, as if listening to a voice only she could hear.</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be down here.\u201d</p><p>He took a step forward. \u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNobody.\u201d She warily shifted backwards. \u201cI\u2019m nobody.\u201d</p><p>Holding up his hands in a gesture of peace, Caine took another step forward.</p><p>\u201cEasy, love,\u201d he soothed. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have one.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. Was she jerking his chain? Or was she just flat-ass crazy?</p><p>\u201cEveryone has a name.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged at his disbelieving expression. \u201cI\u2019m still waiting to discover what it\u2019s going to be.\u201d She stilled, abruptly glancing toward the ceiling. \u201cI have to go.\u201d</p><p>With the quicksilver grace of a fairy, the female spun on her heel and darted toward a narrow opening on the far side of the cavern.</p><p>\u201cHold on.\u201d She ignored his command. Of course. Being stubborn had to be coded into the sisters\u2019 DNA. Without so much as a backwards glance, she disappeared from sight. \u201cFreaking hell.\u201d</p><p>Caine was in swift pursuit, ignoring the very real possibility that this was another trap devised by Briggs.</p><p>He had to find the female.</p><p>He didn\u2019t know why. He only knew that it wasn\u2019t an option to allow her to escape.</p><p>Turning sideways to squeeze through the narrow opening, Caine entered the small cave. It was no larger than most bedrooms, with a narrow cot next to one wall and a battered dresser beneath a broken mirror next to another wall.</p><p>His brows snapped together at the realization that the stark, desolate cell must be where the beautiful woman was kept. An unexpected and unstoppable fury exploded through him.</p><p>Completely irrational considering he had more or less held Harley hostage.</p><p>Still, after the past few days, he wasn\u2019t in the mood to be rational.</p><p>Intent on the silver-haired Were, it wasn\u2019t until she\u2019d bent to light a candle that he was aware of the odd shimmers in the air.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell...\u201d</p><p>His hair threatened to stand on end as his gaze slid over the foreign glyphs that covered the stone walls. In the flickering candlelight they glowed in a strangely hypnotic manner.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t be here,\u201d the woman whispered, wrapping her arms around herself as she sank to her knees beside the cot.</p><p>\u201cI hate to argue with a beautiful woman, but obviously I can,\u201d he absently muttered, moving toward the nearest wall. \u201cWhat is this place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a secret.\u201d</p><p>He halted just inches from the wall, studying the designs. \u201cDid you do these?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>A peculiar sensation inched down Caine\u2019s spine as he realized that the glyphs weren\u2019t carved onto the walls as he first assumed, but instead floated just above the rough surface, occasionally shifting and changing color with a dizzying speed.</p><p>These weren\u2019t random works of art created by a bored pureblood.</p><p>This was...power.</p><p>Turning, he moved back to tower over her kneeling form. \u201cWhat are they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPain, joy...death.\u201d She shook her head, fear rippling over her delicate face. \u201cYou have to go. He\u2019ll be mad if he finds you here.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Caine hadn\u2019t been feared among curs far and wide for no good reason. He could be cold, cunning, and calculating. He could also be brutal when the occasion demanded.</p><p>But something pierced his heart as he gazed down at the fragile woman. Something rare and perilous.</p><p>Without thought, he was kneeling in front of her, reaching to grab her chilled fingers.</p> <p>\u201cWho?\u201d he rasped. \u201cWho will be mad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll kill you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you a prisoner?\u201d he demanded. She ducked her head, and he hooked a thumb beneath her chin, forcing her to meet his searching gaze. \u201cLook at me. Are you being held here against your will?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t let me out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me who it is.\u201d</p> <p>A shadow crossed her face. \u201cI\u2019m not allowed to say his name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it Briggs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe dead Were? No.\u201d A small smile touched her lips. \u201cHe\u2019s frightened of me.\u201d</p><p>Caine couldn\u2019t hide his surprise. Briggs was the sort of nightmarish creature that would terrify any demon. Why would he be frightened of this tiny Were?</p><p>\u201cFrightened?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cHe shouldn\u2019t have asked if he didn\u2019t want to know.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cKnow what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis future.\u201d She pointed toward one of the swirling glyphs. \u201cThere.\u201d</p><p>Caine frowned in confusion. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>The pale green eyes stabbed him with an unnervingly piercing gaze. As if she could see into his very soul.</p><p>\u201cDeath.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChrist.\u201d</p><p>Caine jerked in shock. Dammit. For decades he allowed himself to be blinded by a vision that his rational brain told him was impossible. Not only would it take nothing less than a miracle to turn him from a cur into a pureblood, but Briggs\u2019s claim that his black magic gave him the power to reveal the future was beyond crazy.</p><p>After all, most of the known prophets were under the control of the Oracles, and they possessed only random flashes of the future. Enough to grasp an overall image of various possibilities or pivotal events, but not a detailed revelation for an individual.</p> <p>And now, when he\u2019d at last accepted that he\u2019d been a total putz to fall for Briggs\u2019s scheme, he was confronted by the most extraordinary of all creatures.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a seer,\u201d he breathed.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t see. I dream.\u201d She glanced toward the shimmering glyphs. \u201cI dream and they appear.\u201d</p><p>Gently he shifted his hand, cupping her cheek. \u201cDid you dream of me?\u201d</p><p>The green eyes were abruptly veiled with a disturbing white as she gazed blindly at the wall over his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cYour blood will run pure.\u201d</p><p>Caine didn\u2019t feel elation at the soft words. In fact, the chill that had been snaking up and down his spine now spread to lodge deep in his gut.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re certain?\u201d</p><p>She placed her hand flat on the stone floor, her eyes still clouded. \u201cHere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour blood. So much blood,\u201d she husked, shuddering. \u201cIt\u2019s everywhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d Surging to his feet, he yanked her upright, his instincts on full alert. \u201cWe have to get out of here.\u201d</p><p>With a blink, her eyes cleared, revealing a poignant sadness that shook him to the very core.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll never let me go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t intend to ask his permission,\u201d Caine growled, tugging her toward the crack that led to the outer cavern. There had to be a way out of the damned caves. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>He only made it a few steps before she dug in her heels. Literally.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>She was tiny, but she possessed all the strength of a pureblood. Snarling in frustration, Caine turned to glare at her.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t or won\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t,\u201d she said, her expression composed. \u201cI\u2019m tied to these caves until he\u2019s banished.\u201d</p><p>Well, of course she was. Hell would freeze over before luck was on his side.</p><p>\u201cSo who are you?\u201d he demanded in frustration. \u201cCassandra or Repunzel?\u201d</p><p>Seemingly indifferent to the danger that pulsed in the air, the female Were flashed a smile that arrowed straight to his heart. Damn the female. What was she doing to him?</p><p>He was a man who appreciated a beautiful female. Especially when there was a bed so conveniently nearby. But he wasn\u2019t the sort of sucker who allowed a woman to bewitch and bedazzle him.</p><p>With a shake of his head, he squashed the irrational thoughts. He\u2019d puzzle out his idiotic behavior later.</p><p>Like when death wasn\u2019t actually looming.</p><p>\u201cCassandra.\u201d She said the name like she was testing it on her tongue. Her green eyes glowed with a sudden pleasure. \u201cYes, I like that name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, you\u2019re Cassandra.\u201d He cupped her face in his hands and pretended he wasn\u2019t completely charmed. \u201cWhat mysterious man keeps you here?\u201d</p><p>Her brief happiness faded as swiftly as it had arrived. \u201cDemon lord.\u201d</p><p>Caine dropped his hands, a bolt of fear nearly paralyzing him before he gained control of his rattled nerves.</p><p>No. Demon lords had been banished centuries ago. Someone had to be screwing with the poor female\u2019s brain.</p><p>\u201cImpossible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing is impossible,\u201d she softly countered. \u201cAlthough some things are more probable.\u201d</p><p>He narrowed his eyes. \u201cJust how long have you been down here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn eternity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou...\u201d His words were bit off as a chilling scream ripped through the caves, followed by a violent earthquake that sent Caine sprawling on the hard floor. Pressing a hand to the lump on the back of his head, he regained his feet and glanced warily at the ceiling. It was nothing less than a miracle that they hadn\u2019t been buried beneath an avalanche of rock. \u201cWhat the hell was that?\u201d</p><p>Standing in the middle of the cave as if nothing out of the ordinary had occurred, the pureblood pointed a finger toward the swirling glyphs.</p><p>\u201cCrossroads.\u201d</p><p>Caine\u2019s sharp laugh echoed through the suddenly still air. The woman might be beautiful and fascinating, but she was as crazy as a loon.</p><p>\u201cIs it in the prophet handbook that seers have to mutter complete crap?\u201d</p><p>She blinked. \u201cThere\u2019s a handbook?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChrist.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cWhat do you mean by crossroads?\u201d</p><p>She again pointed at the designs that had started to pulse and churn with a nauseating tempo.</p><p>\u201cLeave now and you have a chance of altering your future.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if I stay?\u201d</p><p>She met his gaze squarely \u201cYou die.\u201d</p><p>Even expecting the prophecy of doom, her simple words hit Caine like a punch to the gut.</p><p>You die...</p><p>For the past thirty years he\u2019d believed that immortality was in his grasp. Hell, he\u2019d become downright cocky, taking insane risks.</p><p>Like trying to kidnap the King of Weres.</p><p>Now he smiled wryly as his mortality smacked him directly in the face. Obviously he should have been paying more attention to his rotten karma, rather than placing all his bets on a vision he\u2019d completely misread.</p><p>\u201cOf course I die,\u201d he muttered. \u201cAnd what happens to you?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cFate.\u201d</p><p>Caine\u2019s brows snapped together. The thought of his imminent death pissed him off. The thought that this woman might be harmed...</p><p>Unacceptable.</p><p>\u201cWell, screw fate,\u201d he growled, kicking off his running shoes.</p><p>Her green eyes widened with something that might have been female appreciation as he stripped off his T-shirt.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>He tugged off his jeans, tossing them aside. \u201cI\u2019m done trying to make an impossible dream come true.\u201d</p><p>Perhaps sensing his reckless determination to go down in a blaze of glory, Cassandra moved to frame his face in her hands, her expression troubled.</p><p>\u201cI told you, nothing is impossible.\u201d</p><p>Her touch sent a shocking blast of awareness through Caine, nearly sending him to his knees. Christ, it was like being struck by lightning.</p><p>A damned shame he could sense something very large and dangerous charging through the tunnels toward them.</p><p>A gruesome death might be worth a night with this woman.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you\u2019re right, Cassandra, my love.\u201d He savored the beauty of her delicate features, lingering on the vulnerable curve of her mouth. \u201cAfter all, you\u2019re about to witness a miracle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat miracle?\u201d</p><p>Bending down, he kissed her with a fierce regret.</p><p>\u201cFor once in my miserable life, I\u2019m going down a hero.\u201d</p><p>He stole one last kiss, then, with a defiant howl, Caine shifted and prepared to meet death.</p><p>When Harley opened her eyes, she was briefly bewildered by the cupid-painted ceiling above her.</p><p>Lying on the oversized bed with silk sheets and a fluffy comforter that was perfect to burrow beneath, she battled through the fog still clinging to her brain.</p><p>She remembered being in the caves. Kind of tough to forget. It wasn\u2019t every day a woman had to fight a demon lord. Not even in her crazy world. And then there had been a mad dash through the caves, barely staying ahead of the thunderous cave-in. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>After that...</p><p>She had a vague memory of stumbling over Darcy and the vampires in the upper chambers. They had swiftly bundled Harley and Salvatore in a Hummer and headed back to Chicago. And then there was nothing.</p><p>She had no recollection of arriving at the mansion on the outskirts of Chicago. Or being tucked in bed.</p> <p>And she most certainly didn\u2019t remember being stripped naked.</p><p>The last of the fog was seared away as Harley became aware of the warm body laying next to her. With a jerk, she rolled to the side, not at all surprised to discover Salvatore.</p><p>Even without the heat brushing over her bare skin, she would have known he was near. The essence of him was branded deep inside her.</p><p>Unnerved by the sensation, Harley allowed her gaze to drift over the finely chiseled face, a familiar need stirring as she took in the thin aquiline nose and full sensuous lips. With his raven hair spilled across the pillow and richly bronzed skin glowing in late afternoon sunlight, he might have looked ridiculously pretty if not for the savage power that hummed just below his sophistication.</p><p>Intent on her survey, it took Harley a moment to notice the amused gold shimmering beneath his lowered lashes.</p> <p>Her heart did an alarming flop and she instinctively tensed, preparing to scramble out of the bed.</p><p>As quick as she was, however, Salvatore was quicker.</p><p>Wrapping his arms around her, he hauled her against his equally naked body, a wicked smile curving his lips.</p><p>\u201cBuon pomeriggio, cara.\u201d</p><p>She sucked in a sharp breath as an urgent desire charged through her. Her brain might be freaking out at the thought of being eternally bonded to Salvatore, but her body didn\u2019t give a crap.</p><p>He was near. He was naked.</p> <p>He was freaking gorgeous.</p><p>Enough said.</p><p>Doing her best to ignore the treacherous excitement spreading through her body, Harley planted her hands against his chest.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing in my bed?\u201d</p><p>He arched a teasing brow. \u201cHow do you know this isn\u2019t my bed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDammit. Why are we in any bed together?\u201d</p><p>His hands slid down to her lower back, pressing her close enough to feel his stirring erection.</p><p>\u201cWhere else would your mate sleep?\u201d</p> <p>Mate. Panic sliced through her and she struggled to put a bit of space, and hopefully a measure of sanity, between them.</p><p>\u201cJust hold on, Giuliani.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying, but you keep squirming.\u201d His warm breath teased over her cheek, sending bolts of pleasure through her body. \u201cNot that I find it entirely unpleasant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSalvatore.\u201d</p><p>He nuzzled a path of kisses along the line of her jaw. \u201cYes, cara?\u201d</p><p>She desperately tried to hold onto her train of thought. Not easy when her body was melting in anticipation.</p><p>\u201cThis whole mating thing is simple biology,\u201d she warned. \u201cYou understand that, right?\u201d</p><p>He chuckled, his hands running a path from her hips to the curve of her breasts.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing simple about biology, cara. It\u2019s complex and magical and far too often inconvenient as hell.\u201d</p><p>She forgot how to breathe as his thumbs lazily teased her nipples to hard, aching peaks.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll second the inconvenient-as-hell part,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>\u201cAnd the magical part?\u201d he whispered, bending his head to tug one nipple between his lips.</p><p>The groan of bliss escaped before she could swallow it. \u201cI\u2019m trying to have a conversation with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m listening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you be listening when you\u2019re groping me?\u201d</p><p>He gently used his teeth to send shock waves of pleasure through her breast to the pit of her stomach.</p><p>\u201cI told you. I can multitask.\u201d</p><p>No crap. He was the freaking master of multitasking. In fact, if he multitasked any better, she would be singing \u201cAfternoon Delight\u201d and seeing fireworks.</p><p>With a sudden shove, Harley rolled Salvatore onto his back, straddling his waist as she grimly reminded herself that they needed to get a few things straight.</p><p>She might have become his mate.</p><p>But that didn\u2019t make her his \u201clittle woman.\u201d</p><p>She pressed her hands to his shoulders, glaring at his amused expression.</p><p>\u201cPay attention.\u201d</p><p>The golden eyes glowed with a tangible heat, his hands skimming over the curve of her hips.</p><p>\u201cYou have my full and eager attention.\u201d He shifted his hips until his erection pressed against her backside. \u201cPainfully eager.\u201d</p><p>Harley clenched her jaw. Holy crap. He wasn\u2019t the only one eager.</p><p>\u201cWe need to discuss our...\u201d She struggled for the right word.</p><p>\u201cMating?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRelationship,\u201d she snapped. \u201cOr more specifically, our lack of a relationship.\u201d</p><p>His fingers tightened on her hips. \u201cNothing seems to be lacking to me,\u201d he husked. \u201cIn fact, I couldn\u2019t be more pleased.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust listen,\u201d she commanded. \u201cThis whole mating doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m going to become your plaything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course it does.\u201d He flashed a decidedly wolfish smile. \u201cAnd for the next few centuries, I intend to keep you barefoot and pregnant while you tend to my every need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah?\u201d She leaned down until they were nose to nose. \u201cI\u2019ll see you in hell first.\u201d</p><p>His hand tangled in her hair, keeping her from pulling back.</p><p>\u201cHarley, the mating just happened. We have an eternity to figure out the relationship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter my first litter or two? Isn\u2019t that what you want from a female?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMadre del dio...\u201d Unprepared for her accusation, his grip faltered and she pulled back to study his guarded expression.</p><p>\u201cDarcy thought it was only fair to warn me that your sole interest in finding us was because of the babies we can produce for you.\u201d</p><p>Harley watched the irritation ripple over his beautiful face, knowing she was being a fraud.</p><p>Not that she was interested in becoming a mindless broodmare for this Were. No way. But she did understand his frantic need for pureblooded children, and his willingness to do whatever necessary to have them.</p><p>He was king, and his first duty would always be to his people.</p><p>That was what she admired most about him.</p><p>No. She was merely using the convenient excuse to put a barrier between them.</p><p>\u201cRemind me to properly thank her later,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cDo you deny it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI deny nothing, cara,\u201d he grudgingly confessed. \u201cMy intention was to create pureblooded females who could carry a litter to full term. But everything has changed now that you\u2019re my mate.\u201d His expression softened with a tenderness that smashed directly into her heart. \u201cMy personal miracle.\u201d</p><p>Harley stiffened, the unexplainable panic once again looming.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say stuff like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat you\u2019re a miracle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s freaking me out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarley.\u201d Reaching up, he grasped her face between his hands. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>Well, that was the question, wasn\u2019t it?</p><p>She licked her dry lips, trying to put her vague fears into words.</p><p>\u201cFor the past thirty years you\u2019ve been the monster in the closet that gave me nightmares.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMerda.\u201d The golden eyes flashed with outrage. \u201cYou think I\u2019m a monster?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not. My point is that Caine made me believe his lies. He controlled and manipulated me, and I was too stupid to realize it.\u201d</p><p>His expression remained grim. \u201cNot stupid. You were young and vulnerable, and the bastard took advantage of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI let him take advantage of me.\u201d She unconsciously squared her shoulders. \u201cThat\u2019s never going to happen again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t trust me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI barely know you.\u201d She rolled her eyes as a smirk curved his lips. \u201cSex doesn\u2019t equate to knowing someone.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty</p><p>Salvatore was careful to keep his possessive instincts hidden behind his taunting smile.</p><p>This woman was his mate.</p><p>And nothing, not even Harley herself, was going to keep him from claiming her.</p><p>But he hadn\u2019t been born yesterday.</p><p>Or even a century ago.</p><p>He might not fully understand Harley\u2019s hovering panic, but he did know that a display of blatant machismo would push her over the edge.</p><p>It was a moment for finesse, not force.</p><p>\u201cYou know me.\u201d He placed his hand just above her breast, savoring the jump of her heart at his intimate touch. \u201cHere.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes darkened with awareness of the bond forged between them, but she stubbornly shook her head.</p><p>\u201cThis is happening way too fast.\u201d</p><p>Salvatore allowed his gaze to dip to the perfect curve of her breasts. There was no point in arguing. Not when she was obviously in the mood to assert her independence.</p><p>Eventually she\u2019d learn to accept their bond.</p><p>And until then, he had a perfect means of passing the time.</p><p>\u201cVery well, cara. I can do slow,\u201d he promised, his hands moving to cup her breasts. He growled deep in his throat as her nipples tightened into tiny nubs and the air was scented with her arousal. \u201cAs slow as you want.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her eyes darkened with ready passion, but her expression remained leery, no doubt sensing she was being deliberately distracted.</p><p>\u201cSalvatore...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarley, we just escaped from a demon lord,\u201d he protested, his fingers lightly circling her nipples. \u201cSurely we deserve a few hours before we go searching for more trouble.\u201d</p> <p>She shivered, her back arching beneath his caresses. \u201cI don\u2019t have to search for trouble when you\u2019re around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo cruel,\u201d he teased, lifting his head to replace his fingers with his lips.</p><p>\u201cYou think you\u2019re so damned irresistible,\u201d she complained, even as her fingers threaded through his hair and she guided his mouth to her other breast.</p><p>He gently nipped her creamy skin. \u201cI\u2019m more interested in whether you think I\u2019m irresistible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re...\u201d She groaned as his tongue flicked over the tip of her nipple. \u201cPassable, I suppose.\u201d</p> <p>His wolf stirred at the direct challenge. Without warning, he flipped her onto her back and covered her with his larger body, pressing her into the mattress.</p><p>\u201cPassable?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy turn on top.\u201d</p><p>She was insanely beautiful with her golden hair spread across the pillows and her cheeks flushed, but it was the sensual anticipation that glittered in her eyes that made his muscles clench in painful need.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get used to it,\u201d she husked.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d Her lips parted to argue, but her words faltered as Salvatore sank his cock deep into her wet heat, her low moan of pleasure filling the air. \u201cThere\u2019s an endless number of possibilities,\u201d he whispered, \u201cand positions.\u201d</p><p>She sank her nails deep into his back, drawing blood as he slowly pulled back and then thrust forward.

There wasn\u2019t a force in heaven or earth that could make him stop. Not when her slick heat was clamped around his erection, her hips rising to meet his thrusts with the hungry demand of a female Were.</p><p>Muttering soft words of encouragement, Salvatore shifted to bury his face in the curve of her neck, the mating bond roaring through him. The sense of Harley was not just physical, but branded on his every emotion.</p><p>She was a part of him.</p><p>For all eternity.</p> <p>Feeling the gathering power of his orgasm, Salvatore grasped the tender flesh of her neck between his teeth, gripping her hips as he drove into her with rapid strokes.</p><p>His entire body tightened with a fierce joy.</p><p>Si. This was what sex between mates was supposed to be.</p><p>Intense, thrilling, and wild.</p><p>With a sharp cry, Harley reached her climax, raking her nails down his back as she convulsed around him.</p><p>The sensation was enough to catapult him over the edge, and tilting back his head, Salvatore roared in pleasure, allowing his seed to pour deep inside her.</p><p>For a breathless moment, he remained poised above her, then with a shuddering sigh he collapsed beside her, gathering her tight in his arms.</p><p>\u201cAdmit it,\u201d he murmured, tenderly tucking a damp curl behind her ear.</p><p>\u201cAdmit what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou find me irresistible.\u201d</p><p>She snorted, shifting so she could meet his teasing gaze. \u201cI find cheesecake irresistible, but that doesn\u2019t make it good for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCheesecake.\u201d He studied her with a wicked smile. \u201cHmmm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you looking at me like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was just imagining how delicious cheesecake would taste served on this decadent skin.\u201d His fingers traced a path up the curve of her back. \u201cWhat else do you find irresistible?\u201d</p><p>She smiled with faux sweetness. \u201cA loaded Smith and Wesson .357.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSexy.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened, then without warning, her choked laugh echoed through the vast room.</p><p>\u201cFor God\u2019s sake, is there anything you don\u2019t think is sexy?\u201d</p><p>A poignant, entirely unreasonable warmth filled his heart at the genuine amusement shimmering in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cNot when you\u2019re near,\u201d he husked.</p><p>\u201cSo predictably male.\u201d</p><p>He pressed her closer, his cock already stirring with a ready passion.</p><p>\u201cA wolf is never predictable...\u201d His words broke off as a cold, sweeping power filled the air.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Harley demanded.</p><p>\u201cThe leeches are stirring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that a problem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to speak with Styx.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. His conversation with the Anasso was not something he intended to share.</p><p>At least not with Harley.</p><p>\u201cUnfinished business.\u201d</p><p>Her brows drew together in suspicion. \u201cCould you be a little more vague?\u201d</p><p>He brushed a light kiss over her lips.

It sounded like paradise.</p><p>A pity he had a few loose ends to tie up.</p><p>Which meant he had to leave Harley behind. At least for a few days.</p><p>He intended to make certain she would be safe until his return.</p><p>\u201cHarley, you know what I\u2019m asking,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have an answer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you intend to remain here with your sister?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps for a few days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then?\u201d</p><p>Her expression hardened, her hands moving to press against his chest.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my business.\u201d</p><p>Content with the knowledge that she was willing to remain with the vamps for at least a few days, Salvatore smiled. It shouldn\u2019t take more than a day or two to finish his business, and then he could concentrate on his obstinate mate.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need to jut that chin at me.\u201d He kissed the chin in question and then the tip of her nose. \u201cI have no intention of locking you in my lair. At least not in the foreseeable future.\u201d</p><p>She frowned in confusion. \u201cYou\u2019re just going to let me go?\u201d</p><p>Let her go? When hell froze over.</p><p>He merely smiled. \u201cYou\u2019re not my prisoner.\u201d</p><p>Far from stupid, she narrowed her eyes in suspicion. \u201cThis is some sort of trick, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo trick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t bother you that your mate isn\u2019t going to be with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs I said, we\u2019ll figure this out in time.\u201d Sliding out of bed, Salvatore scooped Harley into his arms and headed for the attached bathroom. \u201cFor now, I need a shower.\u201d</p><p>She widened her eyes as he crossed the marble floor and entered the shower that could fit an entire army regiment.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>Setting her on her feet, Salvatore savored the scent of her sharp excitement that perfumed the air.</p><p>She could snap and snarl and pretend she wasn\u2019t destined to spend the rest of her life with him, but this...</p><p>This she could never hide.</p><p>Turning on the hot water to spill over them, he skimmed his lips over her cheek, his hands cupping the perfect curve of her breasts.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t expect me to scrub my own back, woman,\u201d he teased. \u201cThat\u2019s what a mate is for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCreep,\u201d she whispered, a smile curving her lips as she plunged her fingers in his hair and kissed him with a hunger that had him pushing her against the ivory ceramic tiles and spreading her legs.</p><p>\u201cAnd this...\u201d With a slow, steady thrust, his cock was deep inside her. \u201cIs what I\u2019m for.\u201d</p><p>She groaned, wrapping her legs around his waist.</p><p>\u201cNot bad, Giuliani,\u201d she whispered. \u201cNot bad at all.\u201d</p><p>An hour later, Harley was settled on the bed wrapped in a terrycloth robe, aimlessly flipping the channels on the plasma TV that had appeared, with a push of a button, from behind a sliding panel.</p><p>Her skin was pruny from the hour she\u2019d spent in the shower with Salvatore, and her body deliciously sated, but she felt oddly restless as she shifted on the silken sheets and adjusted the pile of pillows behind her.</p><p>It would be simple enough to blame her fidgets on the chases, cave-ins, and numerous near-death experiences she\u2019d endured over the past few days. What woman wouldn\u2019t be twitchy?</p><p>Or even the fact that she was in an unfamiliar house, surrounded by dangerous demons who could call themselves family, but still were little more than strangers.</p><p>She knew, however, those weren\u2019t the true reasons she couldn\u2019t relax.</p><p>No.</p><p>Her inability to relax was directly due to Salvatore. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Or more precisely, the absence of Salvatore.</p><p>Damn the man.</p><p>After their prolonged, and deliciously erotic shower, Salvatore had dressed in one of the numerous designer suits that had been left in the walk-in closet, and pulled back his hair with a leather cord. Then with a lingering kiss, he\u2019d taken off in search of Styx, leaving her to enjoy a quiet evening alone.</p> <p>Exactly what she wanted.</p><p>So why did the humongous bed feel empty and the night stretch before her with a tedious boredom?</p><p>She clenched her teeth, jabbing her finger on the channel button of the remote control as she scrolled past infomercials, reruns of Green Acres, and a number of movies that involved an abundance of naked bodies and juvenile humor. There were a thousand channels. One of them had to have something worth watching.</p><p>She had just started on her third run through the channels when a light tap on the door offered a welcomed distraction.</p><p>Tossing aside the remote, she sucked in a deep breath, recognizing the scent of her sister.</p> <p>\u201cDarcy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI come bearing gifts,\u201d she called through the thick wood of the door. \u201cCan I join you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Harley slid off the bed, her eyes widening in surprise as Darcy wheeled in a small cart that was overflowing with stacks of movies, bowls of popcorn, and large ceramic mugs. \u201cHow did you know...Salvatore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe mentioned you wanted popcorn and a movie. I thought we could watch together if you don\u2019t mind.\u201d Darcy flashed a charming smile, looking decidedly impish in her casual shorts and skimpy top, her blond hair spiked. \u201cI brought everything from Die Hard to You\u2019ve Got Mail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefinitely Die Hard,\u201d Harley said before she could halt the revealing words. Hoping to cover her ridiculous aversion to romance, she bent to peer into the ceramic cups. \u201cHot chocolate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy weakness.\u201d Darcy perched on the edge of the bed as she waved a hand toward a delicately scrolled armoire. \u201cThere\u2019s whiskey in the cabinet if you want it with a kick.\u201d</p> <p>Harley grimaced, joining her sister on the bed. \u201cI prefer to keep my wits intact when Salvatore is around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d Darcy tilted her head, studying her with an unnervingly perceptive gaze. \u201cVery wise.\u201d</p><p>Harley ran a self-conscious hand through her still damp curls.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you looking at me like that?\u201d</p><p>Darcy grimaced. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. Nothing is a secret in the demon world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat secret?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve completed the mating bond.\u201d</p><p>Harley pressed her hands to her face. Was that a blush heating her skin? Frigging hell. She was an idiot.</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, you\u2019re Queen of the Weres. Congratulations.\u201d</p><p>Disbelief jolted through her. Queen of Weres. She\u2019d been so rattled by the shock of being mated to Salvatore that the rest of the baggage he brought with him had skimmed right over her head.</p><p>Until now.</p><p>She groaned, flopping back on the mattress.</p><p>\u201cOh, my God,\u201d she moaned. \u201cWhat the hell have I gotten myself into?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarley?\u201d Darcy\u2019s worried face abruptly hovered over her. \u201cForgive me. I have a habit of putting my foot in my mouth.\u201d</p><p>Harley heaved a sigh that came from the tips of her toes. \u201cIt\u2019s not you, Darcy. It\u2019s Salvatore Giuliani.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTypical.\u201d Darcy scooted back so Harley could push herself up on her elbows. \u201cDo you want to tell me what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll of this,\u201d Harley muttered.</p><p>\u201cCould you be a little more specific?\u201d</p><p>Harley shivered, briefly closing her eyes. Even from a distance, she could sense Salvatore. He was in a room directly below her, pacing the floor with a barely controlled impatience that she felt as vividly as if it were her own emotion.</p><p>She lifted her head to meet Darcy\u2019s gaze. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I want to be a mate, let alone the freaking Queen of Weres.\u201d</p><p>Darcy\u2019s lips twisted at her plaintive, yes, maybe even childish, tone.</p><p>\u201cGet in line,\u201d she said bluntly.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI seem to have this conversation a lot over the past few days,\u201d she said with a rueful shake of her head. \u201cHarley, you aren\u2019t the first woman to be...\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnhinged?\u201d she helpfully supplied.</p><p>Darcy chuckled. \u201cOkay, unhinged, by the thought of being irrevocably bound to a male. Especially if that male happens to be an arrogant, overbearing, far-too-fond-of-giving-orders demon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn case you haven\u2019t noticed, Styx tends to take arrogance to an epic level. He\u2019s quite convinced that he\u2019s been put on this earth to take command of everyone and everything. Including me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you run?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d</p><p>Harley jerked in astonishment. Not even the most cynical demon could fail to appreciate the devotion between Darcy and her vampire.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>Darcy wrinkled her nose, clearly recalling one of those memories that you could only laugh about later.</p><p>\u201cStyx and I had our own share of troubles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cObviously you came back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause distance doesn\u2019t change anything.\u201d Darcy shrugged. \u201cMy bond to Styx isn\u2019t just an ancient demon rite or sappy exchange of vows. He\u2019s a part of me.\u201d She pressed a hand to her heart. \u201cWherever I am.\u201d</p><p>The words did precisely nothing to reassure Harley.</p><p>\u201cSo you just gave up and let Styx take over your life?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>Darcy\u2019s eyes widened before she fell backwards on the bed, her laughter bouncing off the vaulted ceiling and echoing through the priceless chandeliers.</p><p>\u201cOnly in his dreams,\u201d she at last managed to gasp, sitting up to wipe the tears from her face. \u201cActually, if you asked Styx he would tell you that I\u2019ve completely taken over his life, and that he\u2019s not even allowed to step out of the house without asking my permission.\u201d</p><p>Harley frowned. The big, scary King of Vampires asking permission?</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe truth is that we have both learned to compromise,\u201d she said. \u201cStyx has grudgingly accepted that I\u2019m capable of making my own decisions, and I\u2019ve grudgingly accepted that his position as Anasso means that he has to put himself in danger far too often.\u201d She reached to grasp Harley\u2019s hand. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean that we don\u2019t still have our moments, but we\u2019ve learned we can discuss the situation and find a solution we can both live with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCompromise? Salvatore? Yeah, right.\u201d Harley snorted at the mere suggestion. Salvatore would learn to compromise when pigs learned to fly. \u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust me, Harley. He will learn to compromise because he won\u2019t have a choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou obviously don\u2019t know the pain-in-the-ass Were as well as you think you do.\u201d</p><p>Darcy leaned forward, her expression oddly serious.</p><p>\u201cI know that a male demon might be obsessed with his need to protect his mate, but he\u2019s equally obsessed with his need to make her happy.\u201d She caught and held Harley\u2019s gaze. \u201cThe moment that Styx senses his overprotective habits are suffocating me, he has no choice but to back off.\u201d</p><p>There was no doubting the sincerity in Darcy\u2019s voice. She truly believed a demon like Salvatore could be tamed.</p><p>Not that Harley actually wanted to tame Salvatore.</p><p>No. Of course not.</p><p>She wanted...</p><p>What?</p><p>A frightening ache unfurled in the center of her heart. An ache that was directly connected to Salvatore Giuliani.</p><p>Dammit.</p><p>He made her crazy with the thought of being mated. And at the same time, he made her crazy with the thought of ever leaving him.</p><p>In other words, he flat-out made her crazy.</p><p>Shifting uneasily, Harley turned her attention to the stack of movies on the tray.</p><p>\u201cActually, I just want to forget Salvatore and our...mating for the next couple of hours.\u201d</p><p>Darcy looked as if she wanted to press the benefits of being mated to an uberalpha demon with a throne, but easily recognizing the stubborn expression on Harley\u2019s face, she heaved a rueful sigh.</p><p>\u201cThat should be simple enough.\u201d She grabbed one of the mugs of hot chocolate.</p><p>Simple?</p><p>Harley lifted her brows, sensing she was missing something.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you say that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I spoke with Salvatore a short time ago, he mentioned he was leaving tonight and might be gone several days. We\u2019ll have plenty of time to get to know one another without being bothered by the King of Weres.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeaving?\u201d</p><p>A sharp alarm had Harley off the bed and storming toward the door.</p><p>Salvatore hadn\u2019t said a word to her about a road trip.</p><p>So either he was making plans for her without asking her opinion.</p><p>Or he intended to leave her behind.</p><p>Either way, he was going to get his assed kicked.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-One</p><p>Salvatore didn\u2019t need anyone to tell him that he was an idiot. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>What male, especially a male werewolf, would willingly leave the warm, welcoming arms of his mate?</p><p>Unfortunately, he was also a king, which meant he couldn\u2019t avoid his responsibilities. No matter what the temptation.</p><p>Reminding himself that the sooner he was done with his business the sooner he could return to Harley, Salvatore forced his reluctant feet to carry him down to the kitchen to briefly speak with Darcy, and then to the back of the mansion where he found Styx.</p><p>Entering the long narrow room, he lifted his brows in amused appreciation.</p> <p>Like the rest of the house, the room was drenched with a profusion of ivory and gilt, with massive chandeliers that hung from a cavernous ceiling. But instead of delicate furnishings and expensive carpeting, the walls were lined with glass cases that held rows of weapons. Guns, swords, crossbows, maces, daggers...the only thing missing was a rocket launcher, and Salvatore wouldn\u2019t have been surprised if there was one or two tucked inside the wooden cabinets at the back of the room.</p><p>The floor was an expensive parquet affair, patterned in a sunburst, but there were also a half dozen workout mats tossed across the glossy wood, with casual indifference to the beauty of the craftsmanship.</p><p>Salvatore had his own armory and Olympic-sized gym in his Roman lair. What demon didn\u2019t? But the contrast between the frilly French d\u00e9cor and the brutal arsenal was absurd enough to bring a smile to his lips.</p><p>He took another step forward, his gaze catching sight of Styx in a far corner.</p><p>The ancient vampire was wearing nothing more than a loose pair of yoga pants, with his long hair pulled back in a braid as he whirled a massive sword through the air. His movements were fluid and perfectly measured, the mark of a true swordsman.</p> <p>A predator.</p><p>Salvatore\u2019s wolf stirred in instinctive response.</p><p>Weeks ago, he and Styx had pitted their strengths against each other.</p><p>Styx had won that battle, arrogant bloodsucker, but Salvatore knew that things would be different now. With the demon lord dead and the power of his mating with Harley pulsing through his blood, he would prove a far greater match for the ancient vampire.</p><p>As if sensing Salvatore\u2019s thoughts, Styx turned to regard his guest with a piercing gaze, the sword held loosely in his hand. Then, with a faint smile, he reached to pluck a matching sword from the glass case on the wall and casually tossed it in Salvatore\u2019s direction.</p><p>Snatching the ornately carved hilt, Salvatore strolled forward, a growl of anticipation rumbling in his chest.</p> <p>\u201cPreparing for an invasion, Styx?\u201d he drawled, gesturing toward the vast array of weapons.</p><p>\u201cA good king is always prepared.\u201d A taunting smile curled his lips. \u201cBesides, I never know when I might be challenged by an arrogant Were who doesn\u2019t know his place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy place?\u201d Salvatore paused to strip off the elegant Gucci jacket and white silk shirt. Then, kicking off the shoes, he lifted the sword in a silent invitation. \u201cDo I have to teach you my place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are welcomed to try.\u201d</p><p>Sweeping his sword upward, Styx attacked.</p><p>Salvatore was prepared, and with a swift motion he met the brutal flurry of strikes. His true strength was in his wolf, but he possessed enough power and skill with the sword to hold his own, even managing to get in a few blows.</p><p>Easily sensing Salvatore\u2019s increased ability since their last confrontation, Styx flashed his fangs in a lethal smile, slicing his sword through the air with a ferocious speed. Salvatore grunted as his muscles absorbed the merciless impact of the attack, flowing in a seamless dance from one side to another.</p><p>They sparred in silence, retreating and advancing to the sharp crash of colliding steel and a shower of sparks.</p> <p>Astonishingly, Salvatore found himself enjoying the mock skirmish. As King of Weres, it was difficult to find a partner who could match his strength, let alone his expertise. It was stimulating to fight a worthy adversary.</p><p>Even if that adversary was a leech.</p><p>Shoving aside his fear at Harley\u2019s refusal to acknowledge their mating bond and the nagging certainty that Briggs was still out there somewhere, Salvatore lost himself in the pure pleasure of pitting himself against the immense vampire.</p><p>A mixture of sweat and blood from shallow wounds coated their skin before both of them stepped apart in mutual agreement.</p><p>With a feral smile, Styx set aside his sword and moved through an open door at the back of the room. He disappeared for only a moment before he returned with two damp towels, tossing one in Salvatore\u2019s direction.</p><p>Salvatore put the sword on a nearby stand to be cleaned and oiled. Then he gratefully scrubbed away the sweat and blood. Whatever Hollywood director had decided that werewolves were savage, uncivilized beasts had never actually met a pureblood. No creature with such an acute sense of smell could be anything but fastidious.</p><p>Of course, not all Weres were blessed with his exquisite taste in fashion.</p><p>Styx leaned casually against a glass case, the wounds marring his broad chest rapidly healing.</p><p>\u201cThe mating with Harley has increased your strength.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt has.\u201d Salvatore smiled wryly, realizing that the vampire hadn\u2019t just been casually sparring. He was the Anasso and he would make it his priority to know the precise amount of power the King of Weres could call on. No one, after all, could call him stupid. \u201cAlong with the death of the demon lord.\u201d</p><p>Styx narrowed his eyes, his expression hard with frustration.</p><p>\u201cHow the bloody hell could he have remained hidden from us all these years?\u201d</p><p>Salvatore understood the vampire\u2019s anger. The demon lord had managed to deceive them all.</p><p>\u201cBecause he truly wasn\u2019t in this world.\u201d Salvatore shrugged. \u201cWithout Mackenzie and then Briggs, the bastard would never have been able to injure the Weres.\u201d</p><p>Styx grimaced. \u201cThey willingly allowed themselves to be anchors?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSi. Worthless cowards.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately, there are always those willing to sell their souls for power. You are certain the demon lord is dead?\u201d</p><p>Salvatore took a moment to consider his answer.</p><p>During the confusion of the battle with the demon lord, followed by his hasty flight with Harley from the collapsing caves, he\u2019d been too distracted to consider precisely what had happened to Balam.</p><p>All he knew was that the ravaging pain was gone, and that the bastard had at least been severely wounded. They never would have managed to escape if he hadn\u2019t been.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until he\u2019d awaken a few hours ago that he\u2019d realized just how dramatically the world had altered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure anything can kill a demon lord, but I know his connection to this world has been severed.\u201d His lips curled in a smile of satisfaction. \u201cAlready I can feel the strength of my packs beginning to increase.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can sense it as well.\u201d Styx regarded him with a steady gaze. \u201cSoon the formidable powers of the Weres will no longer be just an ancient memory.\u201d</p><p>Salvatore didn\u2019t miss the hint of warning, and his chin tilted in defiance.</p><p>The Weres had spent too long in the shadow of the vamps. He intended to make sure they were given the respect they so richly deserved.</p><p>\u201cWe will rule as we were intended to,\u201d he said without apology.</p><p>Their gazes clashed in a silent battle of wills, then a slow smile curved Styx\u2019s lips.</p><p>Like all demons, he respected power.</p><p>\u201cIt should be interesting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you intend to remain in America?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnce I\u2019ve concluded my business, I will need to return to my neglected duties as king. It\u2019s been too long since I\u2019ve visited my packs.\u201d Salvatore grimaced, considering the number of months it would take to complete his task before he could return to his lair in Rome. Not that he had a choice. His connection to his packs was something that had to be cherished and nurtured. And the only means to do that was by spending time among them. \u201cI hope Harley enjoys traveling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is prepared to take her position as queen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s...\u201d Salvatore reached for his shirt, yanking it on, although he left it hanging open. There were still a few slashes on his chest healing, and he wasn\u2019t about to risk staining the fine silk of his shirt. \u201cAdjusting.\u201d</p><p>Styx\u2019s laugh echoed through the room, and moving to the back cabinet, he poured them both a healthy shot of whiskey, returning to press one glass into Salvatore\u2019s willing hand.</p><p>\u201cHave patience, amigo. Female purebloods might be stubborn beyond reason, but they are well worth the trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to convince me of my mate\u2019s worth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, it was more an offer of sympathy. Your life will never be the same.\u201d</p><p>Salvatore snorted. As if he needed a reminder. Already his gut was tied in knots as he struggled between the instinct to return upstairs and force Harley to accept her place as his queen, and his duty to hunt down and destroy the remaining danger to his Weres.</p><p>He\u2019d been mated...what? A handful of days?</p><p>Cristo.</p><p>\u201cFor once we\u2019re in perfect agreement.\u201d Raising his glass in a mocking toast, Salvatore downed the whiskey in one swallow. \u201cSalute.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Styx drained his own glass, and his eyes narrowed. \u201cThere is something troubling you.\u201d</p><p>Salvatore snorted, setting aside the empty glass. \u201cI thought Viper was the one famed for reading the souls of others?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt does not take a special talent to sense your distraction. Is it Harley?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOnly in part,\u201d Salvatore confessed. \u201cI need you to continue protecting her for the next few days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. She is a welcomed part of my clan...\u201d Styx deliberately paused, a wicked glint in his eyes. \u201cBrother.\u201d</p><p>Salvatore shivered, not yet prepared to consider the repercussions of being so intimately connected to a damned leech.</p><p>\u201cMerda,\u201d he growled. \u201cDon\u2019t remind me.\u201d</p><p>Styx chuckled, thoroughly enjoying Salvatore\u2019s suffering.</p> <p>\u201cI assume your request has something to do with the unfinished business you mentioned earlier?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy curs were in the caves,\u201d he said, his jaw tightening at the memory of Max being tortured and Hess under the compulsion of Briggs. The son of a bitch was going to pay, and pay dearly. \u201cI have to make sure they managed to escape the collapse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could send my Ravens.\u201d</p><p>Salvatore blinked in surprise, acutely aware of the honor that Styx had just bestowed.</p><p>The Ravens were personal bodyguards to the Anasso, and the finest trained assassins ever to walk the earth. Styx didn\u2019t loan them out like they were Netflix.</p><p>\u201cGrazie.\u201d He dipped his head in gratitude. \u201cBut they need my presence. Briggs did more than torture them. He invaded their minds. Only I can heal them.\u201d</p> <p>Styx nodded. Salvatore\u2019s ability to share healing powers with his Weres and curs was no secret.</p><p>\u201cAnd once you\u2019ve rescued your curs?\u201d</p><p>Hot fury poured through his blood like lava. \u201cI intend to hunt down and kill Briggs as slowly, and with as much pain, as possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re certain he survived?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCertain?\u201d Salvatore shrugged. \u201cNo. But my instinct tells me he\u2019s like a roach that refuses to die. Until I\u2019ve seen his rotting corpse, I\u2019m going to assume he\u2019s out there somewhere plotting more trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou intend to face him alone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one\u2019s allowed the pleasure of killing him but me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not disputing your right, but your reasoning.\u201d Styx held his gaze. \u201cI, better than most, understand your desire for vengeance, but you cannot allow it to blind you. You have too much to lose to take unnecessary risks.\u201d</p> <p>Hell, yeah, he had everything to lose.</p><p>A beautiful mate who filled his heart with joy, even when she was driving him nuts.</p><p>The opportunity to return the Weres to their former glory.</p><p>A new Lamborghini waiting for him in St. Louis.</p><p>But that didn\u2019t mean he could ignore his duty.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no risk. Without being able to call on his master\u2019s powers, Briggs will be helpless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA cornered demon is the most dangerous creature on earth. And you cannot be certain that he has not prepared for such a turn of fate. He could have any number of nasty surprises waiting for you.\u201d</p><p>Salvatore\u2019s lips twisted. \u201cBriggs is too arrogant to have considered the possibility that I might defeat the demon lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou defeated the demon lord?\u201d a female voice drawled with dangerous composure from behind Salvatore. \u201cWhat a selective memory you have, Your Majesty.\u201d</p><p>Salvatore heaved a sigh as he turned to meet the furious gaze of his mate.</p><p>\u201cCristo.\u201d</p><p>A tight smile curved Harley\u2019s lips as Salvatore slowly turned, his beautiful face carefully composed to hide his guilt.</p><p>Oh, he was so busted.</p><p>But rather than gloating at having caught his lord and master off guard, Harley felt her mouth go dry and a blaze of heat explode through her body.</p><p>Holy...crap.</p><p>Standing in front of a half-naked Aztec warrior and a delectable Roman god, there was enough yummy eye candy to make any woman\u2019s brain turn to mush. Especially when it was obvious the two had just finished a sparring match that had left Salvatore\u2019s raven hair clinging to the damp skin of his face, and his eyes glowing with a fierce golden light.</p><p>A dangerous warrior who would never be fully tamed.</p><p>Perhaps sensing her lack of a functioning brain, Styx moved smoothly forward.</p><p>\u201cHarley. I am delighted to see you have fully recovered. I trust you have everything you need?\u201d</p><p>He reached to take her hand, only to come to a sharp halt when Salvatore\u2019s low growl rumbled through the air.</p><p>\u201cStyx.\u201d</p><p>Styx held his hands up in a gesture of peace. \u201cEasy, wolf.\u201d</p><p>Harley rolled her eyes. \u201cThank you, Styx. Unlike some, I appreciate your very generous hospitality.\u201d</p><p>The vampire\u2019s lips twitched. \u201cYou are welcomed to remain as long as you wish. Darcy is delighted to have you near.\u201d</p><p>Harley turned to stab her mate with a warning glare. \u201cRight now my plans seem to be up in the air.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d Styx reached to pull on a loose black robe. \u201cIf you will forgive me, I have someplace I need to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere do you need to be?\u201d Salvatore demanded.</p><p>Styx flashed a meaningful gaze at Harley\u2019s grim expression.</p><p>\u201cAnywhere but here.\u201d</p><p>The King of Weres snorted. \u201cTraitor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSelf-preservation, amigo.\u201d</p><p>A thick silence descended as the vampire left the room. Caught between the urge to slug Salvatore and push him to the floor and tear off his clothes, Harley instead wandered the short distance to stroke her fingers over the hilt of the heavy sword propped on a stand.</p><p>She was supposed to be annoyed with the Were, not yearning to run her tongue over the exposed muscles of his chest.</p><p>\u201cBeen playing?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cStyx was in need of a sparring partner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I bet.\u201d</p><p>Salvatore moved to stand at her side, his fingers tucking a stray curl behind her ear.</p><p>\u201cI thought you intended to spend the evening watching movies?\u201d</p><p>She jerked from his gentle touch. He wasn\u2019t going to distract her with sex.</p><p>A shame.</p><p>\u201cAnd to make sure I did, you sent Darcy to keep me distracted,\u201d she accused in a tight voice.</p><p>\u201cI sent her to keep you company,\u201d he smoothly countered. \u201cAs Styx said, Darcy is happy to have you as her guest, and I assumed you would enjoy spending time getting to know your sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wanted me too busy to notice when you slipped away like a Slugaugh demon.\u201d</p><p>He folded his arms over his chest, studying her with a brooding gaze.</p><p>\u201cYou were the one, cara, to make it clear that our mating was nothing more than biology,\u201d he reminded her. \u201cWhat does it matter if I intend to leave or not?\u201d</p><p>She clenched her jaw. She wasn\u2019t going to be deterred by logic or reason. She didn\u2019t have to make sense. If she wanted to be pissed off, then she was going to be pissed off.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going after Briggs, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy first priority is to make sure that my curs are safe. Briggs was holding them captive in the caves.\u201d</p><p>Crap. A pang of guilt twisted her heart. Of course he was worried about his pack. She should have told him that she\u2019d seen the curs the minute they had gotten free of the caves. Unfortunately, she hadn\u2019t been thinking clearly on the trip back to Chicago.</p><p>One side effect of battling a demon lord.</p><p>She reached to place a comforting hand on his forearm. \u201cI ran across Hess when I was searching for you. He was...\u201d She abruptly halted, considering her words. Salvatore didn\u2019t need to be reminded that he\u2019d been forced to beat the poor cur to a bloody pulp. \u201cDisoriented, but I\u2019m sure he managed to get the others free and lead them out of the caves.\u201d</p><p>His lips twisted with rueful amusement at her unusual attempt at tact.</p><p>\u201cEven if they weren\u2019t caught in the collapse, they will need to be near me.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t argue with that. Salvatore could help heal both the physical and mental wounds the curs had suffered.</p><p>Luckily, there were any number of other things to argue about.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t answer my question. Are you going after Briggs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my duty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis has nothing to do with duty,\u201d she gritted. \u201cYou want revenge.\u201d</p><p>A muscle twitched in his jaw. \u201cI might have more than one motive, but the bottom line is that I can\u2019t allow the bastard to escape.\u201d The golden eyes glowed, his voice roughening with fury. \u201cHe nearly destroyed the Weres once. He won\u2019t get a second chance.\u201d</p><p>She understood his desire for revenge. She really and truly did. But that didn\u2019t mean she was going to let him stumble into a potential trap. Not when he was blinded by anger.</p><p>\u201cWhat could he do without the demon lord to give him magic?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo doubt he\u2019s already attempting to discover a way to reopen the portal.\u201d</p><p>Her brows jerked together at the mere thought. \u201cGood God. Is that possible?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t intend to find out.\u201d</p><p>Her lips tightened. \u201cSo your plan is to charge off like the Lone Ranger to capture the bad guy?\u201d</p><p>A hint of amusement sparkled in his eyes. \u201cLone Ranger?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo you prefer Batman?

No, it was the melting tenderness of his touch that was doing all sorts of dangerous things to her heart.</p> <p>\u201cFine.\u201d She was forced to halt and clear the huskiness from her voice. Just like a starry-eyed romantic. Damn.

She didn\u2019t want to dissect her violent reaction to the thought of Salvatore leaving her behind.</p><p>All that mattered was that she kept him from doing something stupid.</p><p>\u201cMy explanation is that you\u2019re not going alone, and that\u2019s final.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHardly a reasonable argument,\u201d he countered.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d Her chin tilted. \u201cEither I\u2019m worthy of being your queen or not. If you insist on going after Briggs, then we\u2019ll go together.\u201d</p><p>He stilled, as if caught off guard by her words.

And that might have been his fate if he hadn\u2019t seen the strange mist headed directly for Cassandra.</p><p>Instinct had taken over, and with a howl of fury, he had leaped directly into the path of the advancing fog. He didn\u2019t care what the hell the thing was, it wasn\u2019t going to touch the female pureblood.</p><p>And that\u2019s when things got fuzzy.</p><p>Groaning, he forced his eyes open, wishing he hadn\u2019t when the flickering candlelight sent a stab of pain through him.</p><p>\u201cAm I dead?\u201d he croaked.</p><p>There was a sweet scent of lavender and then Cassandra\u2019s face appeared above him, her hair tangled around her face.</p><p>\u201cNot now.\u201d</p><p>Caine\u2019s heart forgot to beat at her somber words. \u201cIs that a joke?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChrist.\u201d</p><p>He shivered, trying to laugh off her impossible claim. He was a cur, not a pureblooded demon. When he died, that was it. Sayonara, baby. End of story.</p><p>A part of him, however, wasn\u2019t in the mood to laugh.</p><p>Something had happened to him.</p><p>Something vast and earth-shattering.</p><p>He could feel it to his very bones.</p><p>\u201cNow I really know what it feels like to be \u2018death warmed over,\u2019\u201d he wryly muttered, laying his hands flat on the hard stone to push himself to a sitting position.</p><p>His head spun with a sickening dizziness, nearly sending him tumbling back into oblivion. With the speed of a pureblood, Cassandra had her arm around his shoulders, holding him steady.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure you should move,\u201d she chastised, her lips brushing his ear, sending an electric shock of awareness through him that proved that despite his recent introduction to death, everything was still functioning as it should.</p><p>\u201cThere are a lot of things I shouldn\u2019t do, but I never let that stop me. As I have so painfully proven,\u201d he muttered. Then his eyes widened as he caught sight of where he\u2019d just been laying. \u201cOh...shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlood,\u201d Cassandra whispered.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I noticed.\u201d</p><p>He swallowed the urge to vomit at the sight of the thick red stains that spread across the floor and splashed obscenely up the wall.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t that he was squeamish. Hell, he\u2019d slaughtered a pack of hellhounds who had attacked one of witches with his bare hands. But it didn\u2019t take a doctor to realize that no creature could lose that amount of blood and survive.</p><p>\u201cI told you to leave,\u201d Cassandra murmured.</p><p>\u201cNo one likes a know-it-all,\u201d he retorted, grateful to turn his attention to her pale, beautiful face. \u201cWas it the demon lord who attacked?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCharming guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot particularly.\u201d</p><p>He smiled, ridiculously fascinated by her habit of taking his words quite literally.</p><p>\u201cI have a vague memory of a dark shadow entering the cave, heading directly toward you.\u201d He shook his head, hoping to clear the remaining cobwebs. \u201cThen the world exploded.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think the demon was injured. He tried...\u201d</p><p>Caine frowned as her voice faded and her eyes clouded with a painful memory.</p><p>\u201cCassandra? Cassie?\u201d He turned to grasp her shoulders and tugged her against his chest, relieved to discover his strength returning. Laying his cheek on top of her head, he sucked in her delicate scent of lavender, feeling it flow through him with a healing calm. \u201cHey, it\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>She burrowed against his chest, shivering. \u201cHe tried to use me to keep his essence anchored to this world, but you attacked him and he had no choice but to leave.\u201d</p><p>Caine ran a soothing hand down her back, caught off guard by his fierce urge to protect this female.</p><p>She was a Were, for God\u2019s sake. A pureblood.</p><p>Way above a worthless cur like him, even presuming Salvatore hadn\u2019t put out a death warrant on him.</p><p>With a shake of his head, Caine thrust aside his inane thoughts. The only thing that mattered was getting out of the hellhole.</p><p>\u201cSo he\u2019s gone?\u201d he demanded. \u201cReally, truly, never coming back gone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re not hurt?\u201d</p><p>She pulled back, and before Caine could guess what she intended to do, she lifted her shirt to study the flat plane of her stomach.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>Caine choked back a groan at his instant, painful reaction to the sight of her smooth alabaster skin and the lower curve of her bare breasts. God, if he could just get that slender body beneath him...</p><p>His erotic fantasy was brought to a rude end as his gaze caught sight of the small tattoo that marred the skin just beneath her belly button.</p><p>He leaned forward, studying the crimson hieroglyphic that flickered with the same unsettling shimmer as the designs on the wall.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d he demanded, cautiously brushing a finger over the tattoo. His muscles clenched in alarm at the unpleasant chill that clung to the mark.</p><p>Whatever it was, it couldn\u2019t be good.</p><p>Her grimace confirmed his suspicion. \u201cThe mark of the demon lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBastard. What does it do?\u201d</p><p>She turned her head, as if attempting to hide her expression.</p><p>\u201cHe used it to keep me bound to these caves.\u201d</p><p>There was something more.</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt allows me to...\u201d</p><p>He captured her chin between his thumb and finger and turned her back to meet his searching gaze.</p><p>\u201cYou can tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard to explain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can touch the other side.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe other side?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHeaven, hell, another dimension...\u201d She shrugged. \u201cWhatever you want to call it.\u201d</p><p>Unease snaked down Caine\u2019s spine, and with an abrupt movement, he was on his feet.</p><p>Dammit. He had to get them out of there. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He didn\u2019t know who Cassandra was connected to, but he did know it couldn\u2019t have her.</p><p>She belonged to him.</p><p>Period.</p> <p>\u201cAre you stuck down here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, that spell has been broken.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you can leave the caves?\u201d</p><p>She rose gracefully to her feet, her gaze deliberately shifting to the narrow opening of the cave.</p><p>\u201cIf we can find a way to dig ourselves out.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDig?\u201d He froze, praying she wasn\u2019t implying what he thought she was implying. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe tunnels have all collapsed.\u201d</p><p>Well, hell.

Nah.</p><p>\u201cBriggs deceived me for the past thirty years,\u201d he bit out. \u201cI\u2019m not going to be a putz again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeceived you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe made me believe in a vision...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat came true,\u201d she softly interrupted.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve told you...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care what the hell you told me,\u201d he retorted, his nerves wound so tight he felt as if he might shatter. \u201cA cur doesn\u2019t die and come back from the dead as a pureblood.\u201d His breath hissed through his teeth as he was struck by a hideous thought. \u201cOh, my God, I haven\u2019t turned into a zombie like Briggs, have I?\u201d</p><p>She studied him intently, sniffing the air as if testing for the stench of zombie.</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re very much alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen how?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt has to have something to do with your battle with the demon lord.\u201d Her brows puckered as she considered the various possibilities. \u201cHe\u2019s been draining the ancient magic of the Weres for centuries. A portion of his essence must have been left in you.\u201d</p><p>Caine shook his head.</p><p>Not in disagreement\u2014hell, it was as good a theory as any\u2014but in sheer bafflement.</p><p>Good God, was it possible?</p><p>Had he somehow been transformed into a pureblood?</p><p>And if he had...then why?</p><p>Muttering a savage curse, Caine paced the narrow floor, trying to wrap his brain around the staggering implications of his transformation.</p><p>He might have what he always desired, but it wasn\u2019t the glorious revolution that he had dreamed it would be.</p><p>Actually, he felt more alone and uncertain than he had since giving up his human life to become a cur.</p><p>\u201cDamn.\u201d He shoved a hand through his hair, longing to fill his lungs with fresh air. A long run beneath the moonlight was just what he needed to clear the fog from his brain. \u201cThis was not how it was supposed to be. I thought the vision meant I was destined to be the savior of the curs.\u201d</p><p>Her smile dimmed, a haunting pain darkening her eyes. \u201cVisions are rarely what you believe them to be. They\u2019re deceptive and dangerous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI try to warn people, but they never listen.\u201d She shivered, wrapping her arms around her too-slender waist. \u201cThey always want to know.\u201d</p><p>Caine wrenched himself from his dark thoughts, belatedly noting Cassandra\u2019s stark pallor and the bruises beneath her eyes.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t the only one who\u2019d had a nasty day.</p><p>Gently he cupped her face in his hands, acutely aware of the fine shiver that shook her body.</p><p>\u201cWhat people?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBriggs would bring some to the church or cemetery above us and demand I share the visions. Others would pay him to come and visit his \u2018seer\u2019 in person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod.\u201d Caine thought back to when he\u2019d supposedly been \u201cblessed\u201d with his vision. For the most part, the night remained lost in fog, no doubt Briggs\u2019s doing, but he did have a clear memory of being in a vast, empty room. \u201cI was blindfolded, but Briggs must have brought me to the church.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre the visions still with you?\u201d</p><p>She bit her bottom lip, her expression troubled. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Caine grimaced, knowing she should be troubled.</p><p>For all his frantic need to be out of the caves with the wind on his face, he was beginning to realize the dangers of plucking Cassandra from the depths of obscurity.</p><p>A true seer was...</p><p>Fucking priceless.</p><p>Entire demon nations would go to war for the opportunity to gain control of her visions. Others would go to any lengths to kill her and bring an end to her ability to see into the future. After all, when you were plotting evil deeds, you didn\u2019t want to have to worry they might show up, shining like a beacon, on some female\u2019s wall.</p><p>And of course, there was no telling what the Commission would do to her.</p><p>The mystical Oracles who ruled the demon world might decide she was beneath their notice, or they might make her disappear. Cassandra wouldn\u2019t be the first demon with rare powers to be isolated from civilization for the safety of all.</p><p>And no one would dare try to save her from their prison.</p><p>At least no one with even a pea-size brain.</p><p>\u201cDamn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want a list?\u201d he muttered, moving the short space to take her chilled hand in his own. He would worry about keeping Cassandra safe once they managed to escape from their current disaster. \u201cCome on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow that, pet, is one hell of a question.\u201d</p><p>With Viper\u2019s extensive automobile collection at his disposal, Salvatore decided on the sleek red-and-black Alfa Romeo. It would have made more sense to take a Hummer or Land Rover, but Salvatore enjoyed tweaking the nose of the vamps. He didn\u2019t doubt that Viper would be pacing the floor until Salvatore returned his precious baby to his underground garage.</p><p>Plus, he couldn\u2019t deny the satisfaction of roaring through the Chicago streets in the elegantly engineered machine. He was a Were who enjoyed the finer things in life.</p><p>No, not just the finer things.</p><p>The very finest.</p><p>His gaze slid to Harley\u2019s profile as she watched the passing scenery flow from Midwest suburbia to clusters of warehouses, and then finally, flat farmland.</p><p>Smug pleasure settled in his heart.</p><p>His protective instincts might howl at the thought of deliberately taking his mate into danger, but a greater part of him understood that this was how it was meant to be. As mates, the two of them were stronger together than apart.</p><p>Besides, she had made an irrefutable point.</p><p>The Queen of Weres was not an empty title.</p><p>Harley would be judged as much on her strength and ability to protect the packs as her skill in leadership. The Weres respected power, and there would be no sympathy for her inability to shift, or the years she\u2019d been held captive by Caine.</p><p>She would have to earn their loyalty.</p><p>Not that he doubted for a minute that she would.</p><p>There was a ruthless strength in Harley that was hidden beneath her fragile beauty. Dio, she\u2019d faced a demon lord, hadn\u2019t she? Something that would have sent any other creature screaming in fear. She would rise to whatever challenge she might face.</p><p>Not to mention the fact that she was as stubborn as a mule.</p><p>Reluctantly easing off the accelerator, Salvatore slowed the car from light speed to a mere crawl, and forced his attention to their surroundings as he exited off the highway and onto the dirt road that had once led the faithful to the forgotten church. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>In a wash of moonlight, the overgrown cemetery slumbered, seemingly undisturbed for decades. His gaze traveled over the wrought-iron gate that hung open, no longer bothering to protect the bodies that had long ago turned to dust. Behind the fence, the broken marble statues and crumbling mausoleums peeped through the weeds, as if refusing to concede total defeat.</p><p>Just beyond the graveyard loomed the abandoned church, the once grand structure now an empty shell of stone and decaying wood.</p><p>He halted the car behind a patch of trees. The entire neighborhood was vacant, but humans were always straying where they didn\u2019t belong. The sight of the expensive car in the middle of nowhere would stir the kind of attention he hoped to avoid.</p> <p>At his side, Harley shook her head in wry resignation. \u201cIt looks like an abandoned set for a Rob Zombie horror flick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBriggs never did have any taste.\u201d Salvatore shook his head in disgust. \u201cHe\u2019s the sort who gives werewolves a bad name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a matter of taste that gives werewolves a bad name,\u201d Harley said, shoving open her door and climbing out of the car.</p><p>With a chuckle, Salvatore joined her at the side of the road.</p><p>\u201cTrue,\u201d he agreed. \u201cMaybe I should hire a good PR firm.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, right.\u201d She rolled her eyes. \u201cYou love knowing that the demon world quakes in fear when a werewolf enters their territory.\u201d</p><p>Salvatore couldn\u2019t argue. Being the biggest, baddest, predator in the room had its benefits.</p><p>\u201cIt does tend to avoid confusion,\u201d he said smugly.</p><p>\u201cEveryone knows you\u2019re the king, and everyone must bow before you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood God,\u201d she muttered, flicking her gaze over his expensive suit and Italian loafers. Hunting or not, he liked to look good. \u201cYou were arrogant before you came into your full powers. Now you\u2019re going to be impossible.\u201d</p> <p>He bent his head to capture her lips in a swift, possessive kiss.</p><p>\u201cNot when I have a beautiful queen who is always eager to keep me humble,\u201d he husked against her mouth.</p><p>She reached up to tangle her fingers in his hair and returned his kiss with enough heat to start a nuclear reaction.</p><p>\u201cI suppose that\u2019s true enough,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Salvatore briefly considered the logistics of removing her jeans and stretchy shirt to get her naked before reluctantly pulling back.</p><p>Dio. He couldn\u2019t allow himself to be distracted from their urgent business. Not with his curs missing and Briggs still a threat.</p><p>They would have an eternity to enjoy making love beneath the moon.</p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d he demanded, his voice thick with frustration.</p> <p>She nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll go right, you circle left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarley...\u201d</p><p>Her eyes flashed with warning. \u201cDon\u2019t start.\u201d</p><p>He swallowed the lecture that trembled on his lips and instead tugged on the end of her ponytail.</p><p>\u201cBe careful.\u201d</p><p>She smiled, reaching behind her back to pull out two Glocks loaded with silver bullets.</p><p>\u201cAlways.\u201d</p><p>With a silent grace, she disappeared into the bushes that surrounded the graveyard, and Salvatore turned to head toward the church. Again Salvatore felt that surge of pride.</p><p>His mate.</p><p>Strong, beautiful, fearless.</p><p>Perfect.</p><p>Then, with a shake of his head, he concentrated on the scents and sounds that filled the night.</p><p>He took a quick pass through the church, then concentrated on the circle of trees that surrounded the yard.</p><p>Hundreds of scents clung to the thick bushes, but Salvatore easily shifted through them, dismissing all but those that held the familiar musk of Were and cur.</p><p>Finding nothing among the trees, he headed toward the graveyard and the entrance to the caves. More than once he caught the scent of Hess and Briggs, but the trails were too old to have been made after the collapse of the caves.</p><p>Cristo, were they trapped in the tunnels?</p><p>The thought was enough to make his blood run cold.</p><p>The curs had been tortured, mind-raped, and abandoned by Briggs. Being trapped in the caves might be enough to send them over the edge.</p><p>The last thing he wanted was to have to put them down like savage dogs.</p><p>Ruthlessly, he crushed the thought.</p><p>He was going to find his soldiers, and then he was going to kill Briggs.</p><p>He wouldn\u2019t accept any other outcome.</p><p>Weaving through the long forgotten graves, Salvatore joined Harley as she stood beside a marble mausoleum at the very back of the property. He frowned at her distracted expression.</p><p>\u201cDid you find something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought I caught Caine\u2019s scent, but it...\u201d She broke off her words with a shake of her head.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt couldn\u2019t have been him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was the scent of a pureblood.\u201d</p><p>Salvatore lifted his brows, instantly aware of the significance in her words.</p><p>Caine had been so confident that he was to become a Were. Could he possibly have seen the future?</p><p>Could the vision have been real?</p><p>\u201cMerda,\u201d he breathed, dismissing the unpleasant image. The dark lord had massacred anyone claiming to be clairvoyant a millennium ago. There were occasional prophets and those who were sensitive to premonitions, but there weren\u2019t any true seers left in the world. \u201cIt can\u2019t be.\u201d</p><p>Harley shrugged. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot tonight,\u201d Salvatore readily agreed. \u201cBut eventually I intend to track down the cur and repay him for all those years he held you captive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would say he\u2019s already been punished. He thought he was destined to be a great Messiah, and instead he\u2019s lost everything.\u201d</p><p>Salvatore\u2019s lips twisted. Caine had been a willing partner in Briggs\u2019s near destruction of the Weres. Not to mention, he had dared to treat Harley as a pawn in his self-serving games.</p><p>\u201cI prefer a more tangible method of punishment,\u201d he growled.</p><p>She grimaced, knowing better than to try to change his mind. There were some things that couldn\u2019t be compromised.</p><p>\u201cDid you find any hint of Briggs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing fresh.\u201d He glanced toward the silent fields beyond the graveyard. \u201cIf he came out of the tunnels, then it wasn\u2019t here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere has to be more than one way out. We need to widen our search.\u201d</p><p>That had been Salvatore\u2019s thought as well.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll go together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGiuliani.\u201d She narrowed her eyes. \u201cIf you wanted a female who likes being treated as if she needs a big, strong male to protect her, then you shouldn\u2019t have chosen me.\u201d</p><p>Salvatore heaved a sigh. Then, bravely ignoring the handguns that could cause a number of nasty injuries, he brushed his thumb along the line of her stubborn jaw.</p><p>\u201cThere will never be a moment when I won\u2019t need to protect you, cara. I can\u2019t change that.\u201d</p><p>She stepped back, her expression grim. \u201cMy entire life was controlled by Caine. I won\u2019t be leashed again.\u201d</p><p>Her voice was flat, emotionless, but Salvatore knew that she meant every word.</p><p>\u201cAnd I thought battling a demon lord was going to be difficult,\u201d he muttered. \u201cI\u2019ll meet you back here in an hour.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Three</p><p>Aware of the urgency that beat through Salvatore\u2019s blood, Harley moved swiftly past the broken fence of the graveyard and into the cornfield beyond. She should be annoyed. It was difficult enough to deal with her own jumbled mess of emotions without adding a direct, wireless connection to Salvatore\u2019s. Tonight, however, her only thought was making sure that the stubborn Were didn\u2019t end up dead.</p><p>And that meant finding Briggs before the freak-of-nature could regain his strength.</p><p>Crisscrossing the field to make sure she didn\u2019t overlook any hint of Briggs or the curs, Harley was headed toward the adjoining field when a low whistle cut through the air.</p><p>Salvatore.</p><p>With a smooth turn, she was running toward the narrow dirt road on the far side of the field, crouched low to the ground, her guns held ready. She sensed Salvatore\u2019s flare of fury and she intended to be prepared.</p><p>For anything.</p><p>Salvatore was in a deep culvert by the road, staring at a heavy rock that had been pushed aside to reveal a large hole in the ground. Obviously an opening to the caves below the surface.</p><p>She scrambled down the side of the culvert, catching the unmistakable stench of rotting meat. Briggs had come out of the hole.</p><p>\u201cYou got him,\u201d she said, her satisfaction cut short at the unmistakable smell of cur blood. \u201cShit.\u201d</p><p>Salvatore\u2019s face was set in bleak lines as he followed the scent down the culvert and then up to the road. Harley stayed close to his side, keeping watch on their surroundings so Salvatore could concentrate on the trail.</p><p>Her gaze scanned the seemingly empty fields and clusters of trees that could hide any number of nasty creatures. Her senses told her that there was nothing near, but her finger remained on the trigger.</p><p>She\u2019d had a stomach full of unwelcomed surprises over the past few days. She\u2019d be damned if it was happening again. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Perhaps a mile down the road, Salvatore bent and touched the ground, his brows drawn in a frustrated frown.</p><p>\u201cThey took off in a vehicle,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cCan you follow it?\u201d</p> <p>He tilted back his head, dragging in a deep breath. \u201cOn foot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what are we waiting for?\u201d</p><p>Straightening, he considered her for a long minute, clearly wanting to demand that she return to the safety of Styx\u2019s mansion. Then, proving he wasn\u2019t completely without a functioning brain, he heaved a deep sigh and pulled his cell phone from the inner pocket of his jacket.</p><p>\u201cAs amusing as it would be to leave Viper\u2019s car for the nearest chop shop, I might have need of the leeches before this is done,\u201d he said, punching in a series of numbers and holding the phone to his ear.</p><p>He exchanged a few abrupt words with Viper and then slipping the phone back in his pocket, he grabbed her arm and urged her into a steady jog down the dark road.</p> <p>\u201cDo you consider vampires your enemy?\u201d she demanded, slipping the guns back into the holsters that hung at her lower back before easily falling into step beside him.</p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd now?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t immediately answer, and Harley was startled by the vague sense of foreboding she could sense deep in his heart.</p><p>\u201cNow, I\u2019m beginning to suspect that we must negotiate a truce,\u201d he grudgingly admitted. \u201cTimes are changing and we must change with them or perish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you mean technology?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s a part of it.\u201d He grimaced. \u201cThe humans\u2019 ability to detect our presence increases with every passing year, as does their ability to harm us. It\u2019s foolish to assume our natural superiority will protect us.\u201d</p><p>Harley lifted her brows. Few demons were willing to admit that lowly humans might pose a threat, despite growing proof of the danger.</p><p>\u201cAnd the other part?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure I should share.\u201d He shook his head, his expression hard. \u201cYou might think I\u2019ve lost my mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI assumed that you\u2019d lost your mind the minute you crashed into Caine\u2019s basement,\u201d she assured him.</p><p>He chuckled, the golden eyes glowing in the darkness. \u201cGrazie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s bothering you, Giuliani?\u201d She held up a warning hand as his lips parted to blather some useless denial. \u201cAnd don\u2019t tell me it\u2019s nothing. I can sense it.\u201d</p><p>His lips twisted. \u201cThis mating is going to take some getting used to.\u201d</p> <p>She snorted. \u201cYa think?\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed. \u201cHarley...\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust tell me what\u2019s bothering you,\u201d she interrupted.</p><p>His jaw tightened, his gaze returning to the road and the faint tire tracks that were still visible.</p><p>\u201cThe ancient magic is returning. I can feel it flowing through my blood.\u201d</p><p>Harley slowly nodded. She\u2019d felt the potent magic stirring since they\u2019d escaped from the caves.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd it\u2019s whispering to me of danger.\u201d</p><p>A chill inched down her spine. \u201cThe demon lord?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>She studied his grim expression. What could be worse than a demon lord?</p><p>\u201cSalvatore?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, cara. It\u2019s as if...\u201d He shook his head in frustration. \u201cThe world is holding its breath, waiting for something that will change us all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re scared?\u201d she breathed.</p><p>\u201cCautious,\u201d he said softly. \u201cIt seems wise to consolidate my power base.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe vampires?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor a start.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Weres and the vamps working together.\u201d Her voice held an edge of teasing. It had never been a secret that the two species had often attempted to exterminate the other. \u201cThe demon world is going to think that hell has frozen over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you you\u2019d think I\u2019d gone mad.\u201d He glanced in her direction, his brows pulling together as she stumbled to a sudden halt. Turning, he cupped her chin and lifted her face to study her troubled expression in the moonlight. \u201cHarley?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just remembered there was an elderly witch who Caine hired to create hexes of protection for his labs. She spoke of warning signs. At the time...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou thought she was nuts?\u201d he asked wryly.</p><p>Harley grimaced. \u201cMaybe a little.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did she say?\u201d</p><p>Harley had to strain to recall the old woman\u2019s ramblings. She\u2019d always liked Anastasia, but the witch had often creeped her out with her dire omens.</p><p>\u201cShe claimed that a new Oracle had been discovered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSi. Anna Randal, an Elemental. She\u2019s mated to a vampire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe seemed to think that was some sort of portent of coming upheaval.\u201d</p><p>He slowly nodded. \u201cThere is an old legend that a new Oracle is only discovered during times when the need is the greatest. Vague mumbo jumbo, like all prophecies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe also said...\u201d Harley\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe said that the wind spoke of ancient powers returning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Weres?\u201d</p><p>Harley shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>He narrowed his gaze. \u201cDo you think she was a seer?\u201d</p><p>Harley laughed. She might have been sheltered from the world, but everyone knew that seers were extinct.</p><p>Like dragons and leprechauns.</p><p>Well, everyone but Caine, who\u2019d been stupid enough to believe in visions.</p><p>\u201cNo, she didn\u2019t claim to read the future, only the various omens and signs that she could see around her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid she say anything else?\u201d</p><p>Harley searched her mind. \u201cMost of it was gibberish, but I remember she said something about the rise of Gemini.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe astrological sign?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I assumed, but she didn\u2019t really make much sense.\u201d</p><p>Salvatore lifted his head, his brooding gaze turned toward the moon as he considered her revelation. Watching the spring breeze ruffle the raven hair that framed the proud lines on his face, Harley\u2019s heart forgot to beat.</p><p>He was so stunningly beautiful.</p><p>So magnificently powerful.</p><p>So...</p><p>Hers.</p><p>Utterly and completely hers.</p><p>Harley jerked in surprise at the raw, primitive sense of possession that blasted through her.</p><p>Where the hell did that come from?</p><p>Thankfully unaware of her cavewoman impulse to drag him off and give him a reason to howl at the moon, Salvatore heaved a resigned sigh and resumed following Briggs\u2019s trail.</p><p>\u201cObviously, the sooner we\u2019re done with Briggs and back to the safety of our lair, the better.\u201d</p><p>Disgruntled by her savage awareness of Salvatore, Harley kept a determined space between them as they ran through the darkness.</p><p>\u201cOur lair?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I look like a fool?\u201d He flashed a wry grin. \u201cYou would have castrated me if I\u2019d said my lair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she grudgingly conceded. \u201cValid point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m learning.\u201d</p><p>For a time they moved through the darkness in silence, Harley absently noting that the tidy fields were being left behind and replaced by a tangle of underbrush and trees. Hard to believe that the road could lead to someplace even more isolated than the abandoned church and graveyard.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never been to Italy,\u201d she abruptly muttered.</p><p>Salvatore\u2019s lips twitched, although he was careful to keep his attention to their surroundings.</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019ll like the palazzo,\u201d he said, his voice carefully bland. \u201cIt\u2019s old, but it\u2019s been magnificently restored.\u201d</p><p>Palazzo?</p><p>As in palace?</p><p>Oh, that was just fan-freaking-tastic.</p><p>\u201cIs it huge?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFairly huge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith marble?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSi, there\u2019s marble.\u201d He sent her an amused glance. \u201cDo you have an irrational dislike of marble?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but I have a very rational dislike of becoming a joke among the Weres.\u201d</p><p>The smile disappeared as his expression hardened with a haughty outrage.</p><p>\u201cI assure you, cara, no one will ever dare laugh at you,\u201d he said with the absolute confidence that his word was law.</p><p>And why not?</p><p>His word was law.</p><p>She shook her head, thinking back to her unconventional childhood. Caine had certainly never prepared her to become a sophisticated lady. Hell, she was more comfortable at a firing range than a ballroom.</p><p>\u201cMaybe not to my face, but I\u2019m going to look like an idiot in some fancy palace.\u201d She pointed a finger in his direction. \u201cAnd don\u2019t think for a minute you\u2019re getting me into a slinky dress and high heels.\u201d</p><p>His husky chuckle brushed over her skin. \u201cI\u2019d rather get you out of a slinky dress. Although you can leave on the high heels.\u201d</p><p>The image of her standing naked in front of Salvatore with a pair of crimson high heels sent a hot flash searing through her body.</p><p>Good...God. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI mean it, Salvatore,\u201d she managed to croak.</p><p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t,\u201d he countered with annoying calm. \u201cYou\u2019re just trying to find another reason to convince yourself you shouldn\u2019t be my queen, and I won\u2019t play. I don\u2019t care if you run through the palazzo stark naked or wearing Prada.\u201d</p><p>Her lips parted, and then snapped closed, as she accepted that he was right.</p> <p>Salvatore was her mate.</p><p>She could feel it to the very marrow of her bones.</p><p>And her instinctive need to rebel against his claim on her was becoming downright childish.</p><p>Not that she intended to become his doormat, she wryly acknowledged.</p><p>Not all the ancient powers combined could perform that impossible task.</p> <p>But it was time to be done with fighting the knowledge that her destiny was forever, irrevocably connected to Salvatore Giuliani.</p><p>\u201cYou think you\u2019re so damned smart, don\u2019t you?\u201d she muttered dryly.</p><p>A muscle twitched in his jaw. \u201cIf I were smart then Briggs would never have crawled from his grave, and we would be spending the night having hot, sweaty sex beneath the moon.\u201d</p><p>Sensing his annoyance was directed at himself, Harley reached out to touch the rigid muscles of his arm.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll find him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSi.\u201d</p> <p>They once again fell silent, their pace slowing as the stench of Briggs became more pronounced. Instinctively, Harley reached behind her back to pull the guns out of the holsters.</p><p>The tangle of brush and trees had thickened until it was impossible to see beyond a few feet from the road, and while her senses told her there was nothing but the usual wildlife scurrying through the shadows, she wasn\u2019t going to take any chances.</p><p>Rounding the curve in the road, they both halted at the sight of the small cabin that looked in dire need of a match and some kindling.</p><p>Tilting precariously to one side, the paint had long ago peeled from the wood planks and the small front porch sagged with weariness. If there had ever been shutters, they had long ago disappeared, along with several wooden shingles from the roof, and at least one window.</p><p>Of course, the cabin looked almost habitable when compared to the shed with a rusty tin roof, built behind it.</p><p>Cue banjo music.</p><p>Harley resisted the urge to roll her eyes. At least it wasn\u2019t another cave.</p><p>Breathing in deeply, she closed her eyes and sorted through the barrage of near overwhelming scents that filled the air.</p> <p>It was easy to pick out Briggs\u2019s odor that wafted from the cabin. Rotting meat was pretty tough to miss.</p><p>Not that he could have hidden his presence, even if he could disguise his god-awful stench. The frigid chill in the air would always give him away.</p><p>Taking in another breath, she ignored the vile presence of Briggs and concentrated on the scent of curs. It was no surprise to find their scent laced with a combination of fear and frustration. Even for curs, who always lived on the edge, they\u2019d been put through hell over the past few days. It was a surprise, however, to realize their scent came from the shed, rather than the cabin.</p><p>Why wasn\u2019t Briggs using them as a shield? More important, why would he leave them where they could so easily be rescued?</p><p>There was only one explanation.</p><p>A trap.</p><p>Salvatore moved to whisper directly in her ear. \u201cThe curs are in the shed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI smell them.\u201d She turned to meet the golden gaze that glowed with a savage anticipation. \u201cYou know he\u2019s expecting you? This is a trap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBene.\u201d</p><p>She clenched her teeth, torn between the urge to shake some sense into him and knocking him over the head with the butt of her gun.</p><p>Unfortunately, neither of them would keep him from waltzing straight into Briggs\u2019s ambush.</p><p>\u201cSalvatore, if you get yourself killed, I\u2019m never going to forgive you,\u201d she hissed.</p><p>With a feral smile he bent down to claim her lips in a kiss she felt to the tips of her toes.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re never getting rid of me,\u201d he whispered against her mouth.</p><p>Arching against his hard body, Harley momentarily allowed herself to savor the feel and scent of him. Then with a sigh, she reluctantly stepped back.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the plan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou release the curs and get them out of here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhile you battle Briggs by yourself?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cIt has always been inevitable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not...\u201d</p><p>\u201cSi, it is.\u201d He framed her face in his hands. \u201cI have to do this, Harley. And I need to know that Hess and the others are far enough away that Briggs can\u2019t gain control of them.\u201d</p><p>She wanted to argue. It was insanity for Salvatore to confront Briggs alone. The Were was not only Hannibal-Lecter-nuts, but he was already dead. How the hell did you kill a zombie?</p><p>But in the end she bit back her words.</p><p>This wasn\u2019t just Salvatore\u2019s macho need to prove his superiority over the other male.</p><p>Briggs hadn\u2019t just been an enemy to Salvatore. He had violated the entire Were nation with his bargain with the demon lord. And he\u2019d come far too close to destroying them all.</p><p>As king, it was Salvatore\u2019s duty to make sure the traitor suffered the ultimate punishment.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>He brushed one last kiss over her lips. \u201cTake the curs back to the church. I\u2019ll join you there once I\u2019m certain Briggs is dead.\u201d</p><p>Salvatore barely waited for Harley to disappear into the shadows before efficiently stripping off his expensive suit. He had every confidence in her ability to free the curs and lead them to safety.</p><p>Even if she did want to give him a black eye.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t the first, and it certainly wouldn\u2019t be the last time he annoyed her.</p><p>The gods willing.</p><p>His smile faded as he shifted into wolf form and silently padded toward the cabin.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t going to underestimate Briggs. The Were was a flaming nutcase, but he had to know he was no match for Salvatore without his demon lord to hide behind. Which meant he must be confident that whatever trap he had set was capable of destroying Salvatore.</p><p>Circling the cabin, Salvatore allowed his superior animal senses to search the area for any hint of danger.</p><p>Predictably, the presence of werewolves had frightened off the local wildlife, and the nearest human was miles away, but there were a few lesser demons in the vicinity. A pack of hellhounds sniffing through the underbrush. A tree sprite dancing through the branches. A distant hag.</p><p>Nothing that could offer a threat.</p><p>Which meant that Briggs\u2019s trap must be magical.</p><p>Naturalmente. The worthless hound wouldn\u2019t recognize a code of honor if it bit him on the ass.</p><p>Accepting there was nothing physical to battle, Salvatore shifted back to human, moving through the overgrown backyard to peer through a window.</p><p>He could see a small kitchen with a worn linoleum floor and cabinets that had once been painted a hideous yellow. The appliances had been removed or stolen, leaving behind broken pipes and exposed wires.</p><p>Salvatore grimaced. Even without Briggs, the place was a deathtrap. He could only hope that the electricity had been turned off.</p><p>As if on cue, a bloom of candlelight filled the front room beyond the kitchen, revealing a battered sofa and matching chair that was the only furniture. Although it would be generous to label the rotting pieces of junk as furniture. More a post-apocalyptic nightmare.</p><p>His eyes narrowed as the shadowed outline of a cloaked figure was suddenly visible. Briggs. How convenient. Just the sleazeball he\u2019d been looking for.</p><p>Climbing the back steps, Salvatore kicked in the door and rapidly crossed through the empty kitchen. If there was a trap, then so be it. Tiptoeing through the place wasn\u2019t going to help.</p><p>He made it into the front room, headed straight for Briggs, when the expected snare was at last tripped.</p><p>A cold breeze prickled over his naked body, then invisible bonds wrapped around him, slamming him into the wall with enough force to shake chunks of plaster from the ceiling.</p><p>Salvatore grunted in pain, but he didn\u2019t panic.</p><p>Briggs might be able to conjure a portion of his black magic, but his strength had to be failing with the death of the demon lord, while Salvatore\u2019s power had never been greater.</p><p>Proving his point, Briggs pushed back the hood of his cloak, revealing his face that was barely more than a skull, with drooping bits of gray flesh and a set of crimson eyes that glittered with a rabid hatred. Cristo. Salvatore had stumbled across genuine zombies who looked better than this Were.</p><p>And the stench...Salvatore shuddered in disgust.</p><p>\u201cYou just never learn, do you, Salvatore?\u201d Briggs taunted, strolling to stand directly before Salvatore.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a matter of learning.\u201d Ignoring the pain, Salvatore managed a smile. \u201cI simply don\u2019t fear you.\u201d</p><p>Fury flashed over the Were\u2019s emaciated face before he managed to regain his smug composure.</p><p>\u201cI knew that arrogance would be your downfall.\u201d</p><p>Salvatore shrugged. \u201cIt might be eventually, but not tonight.\u201d</p><p>Briggs halted directly in front of him. \u201cWe\u2019ll see about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do, Briggs? Your master is gone, and without his powers you don\u2019t have a chance in hell of beating me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The Were laughed, waving a hand toward Salvatore\u2019s body pinned to the wall.</p><p>\u201cObviously I\u2019m not without resources.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t hold me here indefinitely. So, unless you have another demon lord tucked in the cellar, you\u2019re screwed.\u201d His eyes narrowed. \u201cI do have one question.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou want to know why,\u201d Briggs mocked.</p><p>\u201cNo, I know why. You\u2019re an amoral, spineless son of a bitch who would willingly destroy your own people rather than accept the fact that you weren\u2019t worthy of being their leader.\u201d</p><p>An icy burst of pain exploded through him, reminding Salvatore that while Briggs might look like a corpse, he wasn\u2019t in his grave.</p><p>Not yet.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m more worthy than you\u2019ll ever be,\u201d the pureblood hissed.</p> <p>Salvatore\u2019s humorless laugh echoed through the empty shell of a cabin.</p><p>\u201cNot even in your sick and twisted brain can you still believe your own lies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWithout you...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWithout me the Weres would have become extinct. I\u2019m not only their chosen king, but their savior,\u201d Salvatore deliberately prodded. \u201cMy name will become legend among the purebloods.\u201d</p><p>Briggs\u2019s composure cracked, his eyes flashing with an insane fury. Reaching up, he smacked Salvatore across the face with enough force to split his lip.</p><p>\u201cBloody bastard.\u201d</p> <p>Salvatore calmly turned to spit the blood from his mouth. \u201cWhat I want to know is, was it worth it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWorth what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas it worth sacrificing your pack, your loyalty, your sense of honor for a futile attempt to sit on a throne never intended for you?\u201d</p><p>There was another blast of icy pain, and Briggs\u2019s face twisted with insane hatred.</p><p>\u201cIt will be worth every sacrifice once you\u2019re dead.\u201d</p><p>Salvatore\u2019s muscles clenched at the arctic assault, but through the pain he sensed Briggs\u2019s magic beginning to falter. The bonds holding him against the wall were deteriorating, and the chill biting into his flesh lessening.</p><p>Thankfully, the bastard was too distracted by his own anger to realize the danger.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a shame really,\u201d Salvatore drawled, quite happy to stir the bastard\u2019s temper. \u201cThe Weres\u2019 ancient powers are on the cusp of returning, and you won\u2019t be around to appreciate our glory.\u201d</p> <p>The stark truth of his words was the last nudge needed to send the maniac over the edge.</p><p>\u201cEnough,\u201d Briggs roared, throwing off his cloak to reveal his skeleton body. \u201cHell\u2019s waiting for you, Giuliani. Give my regards to Mackenzie.\u201d</p><p>Salvatore braced himself as Briggs shifted, the sound of his low growls and popping bones unnaturally loud in the isolated cabin. The candlelight flickered as his face elongated, his fangs lengthening to deadly daggers and his eyes flashing with crimson fire.</p><p>Crazy or not, he was still a lethal predator.</p><p>Which he was swift to prove as he launched his attack, using Salvatore\u2019s immobility to strike straight at his throat.</p><p>Dio.</p><p>Straining against the invisible bonds, Salvatore barely managed to avoid the death blow, instead taking the violent impact on his shoulder. He felt his collarbone snap and the fangs rip deep into his flesh, but he survived.</p><p>This time.</p><p>Hot blood gushed from his wounds and the clinging magic made every movement a lesson in torture, but gritting his teeth, he managed to force himself from the wall and confront the Were as he once again pounced.</p><p>Plowing directly into Salvatore\u2019s chest, Briggs\u2019s attack sent them both rolling across the uneven wooden floor, his fangs once again biting deep into Salvatore\u2019s shoulder. Agonizing pain jolted through him, but Salvatore barely noticed. He was intent on forcing his awkward body to obey his commands.</p><p>With a merciless growl, Briggs scrambled to regain his balance, his fangs dripping blood, and his eyes smoldering with a deadly promise.</p><p>Sucking in a deep breath, Salvatore prepared to shift. It was much easier to call on the power of his pack in werewolf form. Not to mention the fact that he was more than ready to rip out Briggs\u2019s throat.</p><p>Reaching for his beast, he abruptly growled in disbelief, stunned to discover that his powers lurked just out of reach. His wolf snarled, but remained frustratingly leashed by Briggs\u2019s magic, as if trapped behind an invisible barrier.</p><p>Just as his connection to his pack was cut off.</p><p>His gut twisted with dread as he shoved against the unseen wall, searching for a means to break through.</p><p>Dio.</p><p>Briggs\u2019s spell had not only affected his muscles, but it had stolen his wolf.</p><p>Ignoring the urge to howl in frustration, Salvatore instead forcibly calmed his racing heart and stopped his futile struggles against the black magic. His wolf was currently impotent, but as his mind cleared, he realized there was something else inside him...</p><p>An unwavering power that had nothing to do with his position as king. Or even his strength as an alpha werewolf. This force came directly from his heart, and had everything to do with Harley.</p><p>The sound of Briggs\u2019s claws scraping against the wooden planks was the only warning as the Were charged forward, his fangs snapping just over Salvatore\u2019s head as he called on Harley\u2019s powers and managed to throw himself to the side.</p><p>He rolled toward the sagging sofa, cursing as he heard Briggs\u2019s howl of rage echoing through the cabin. The bastard wasn\u2019t going to be satisfied until he\u2019d ripped out Salvatore\u2019s heart, and Salvatore couldn\u2019t depend on dumb luck to keep him alive.</p><p>Time to do something.</p><p>A pity he didn\u2019t know what the hell that was.</p><p>Harley had been horrified when she\u2019d entered the shed.</p><p>Predictably, the four curs were chained to the walls with silver shackles, the stench of burning flesh enough to turn her stomach, but it was the sight of their ragged appearance and the wretched defeat etched on their filthy faces that made her heart twist in fury toward Briggs.</p><p>They had quite literally been broken by the evil Were.</p><p>Damn the bastard.</p><p>She hoped Salvatore ripped out the pureblood\u2019s heart, chopped it into pieces, and fed it to the rats. Then raised him from the dead and did it all over again.</p><p>Her grim mood didn\u2019t improve once she had the curs released and was leading them through the tangle of trees in a straight path back to the church.</p><p>She\u2019d expected to have a brawl on her hands when she told the curs that they were leaving without Salvatore. Actually, she expected a mutiny, even after telling them that their king had ordered them to go with her.</p><p>It was disturbing to have them follow behind her with mute obedience, their heads hanging and their spirit lost.</p><p>Once in the empty church, she\u2019d settled them on a rickety pew, her heart twisting as they huddled together, needing the physical contact to ease their fear. A part of her felt a befuddled need to do something to comfort them. She was supposed to be their queen, after all. It seemed like it should be her duty.</p><p>Unfortunately, she didn\u2019t have a clue what to do.</p><p>She didn\u2019t think a pat on the head and a \u201cthere, there\u201d was going to help.</p><p>Another part of her, however, was consumed with her relentless awareness of Salvatore.</p><p>Since their mating, the sense of him always hummed through her. More like a background noise than an intrusion. Now she found herself restlessly pacing the empty vestibule, the feel of Salvatore so acute it was almost painful.</p><p>Unwittingly rubbing the spot just over her heart, Harley walked to stare out a broken stained glass window. Something was wrong.</p><p>And it terrified her.</p><p>Turning back, she caught sight of the large bald-headed cur regarding her with a melancholy expression.</p><p>With a lift of her hand, she gestured for him to join her. \u201cHess.\u201d</p><p>Despite his bulky muscles, the cur moved with a fluid grace as he crossed to kneel at her feet, his head bowed.</p><p>\u201cYour Majesty.\u201d</p><p>Harley reached out and hastily urged him back to his feet, disturbed by the cur\u2019s groveling. Respect was all fine and dandy, but she was never going to get used to very large predators bowing and scraping.</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t do that,\u201d she muttered. \u201cMy name is Harley.\u201d</p><p>He grudgingly nodded his head, not pleased by her refusal to follow tradition. A cur of the old school, obviously.</p><p>Bleck.</p><p>\u201cIf that is your wish.\u201d</p><p>She frowned at the sight of violent bruises and raw burns that marred his bare chest.</p><p>\u201cAre you hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing that won\u2019t heal.\u201d</p><p>His dull, lifeless tone warned Harley that the worst of his wounds weren\u2019t physical.</p><p>He needed Salvatore.</p><p>Hell, they all needed Salvatore. Herself included.</p><p>\u201cTell me what happened,\u201d she demanded. \u201cHow did Briggs get you to the shed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was leading the others from the caves as you commanded when Briggs found us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPredictable. He has a talent for always being at the wrong place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe...\u201d Hess licked his lips, his expression haunted. \u201cHe said he needed to make sure Salvatore would follow him.\u201d</p><p>Well, at least now she knew why the curs had been left in the shed. They had been expendable once Salvatore arrived. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou were bait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d His glance briefly shifted to the other curs still huddled together on the pew. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t fight him. He gets in our brain and makes us do things.\u201d</p><p>She reached out to touch him, surprised to discover she could sense the mass of anger and confusion that tormented the cur.</p> <p>\u201cNo one blames you, Hess,\u201d she said softly. \u201cThere was nothing you could do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI blame me,\u201d he growled, his hands clenching. \u201cI have failed my master over and over. I\u2019m not worthy to be his servant.\u201d</p><p>Harley frowned, her sympathy being replaced with frustration. Okay, Hess and the other curs had been through hell. She got it. But right now Salvatore needed them to be strong.</p><p>And that\u2019s what they were going to be.</p><p>Without giving herself time to think, she reached up and slapped the cur with enough force to snap back his head.</p> <p>\u201cStop that.\u201d</p><p>Hess growled deep in his throat, the dull shame in his eyes being replaced by a spark of anger.</p><p>Thank God.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhether it\u2019s the truth or not, Salvatore needs his warriors, not a bunch of self-pitying whiners,\u201d she snapped.</p><p>He flinched at her brutal accusation, a meaty hand lifting to rub over his bald head.</p> <p>\u201cYou said Salvatore had ordered us to leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen obviously he understands that we are useless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s concerned about Briggs taking control of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause we were weak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor God\u2019s sake. That\u2019s enough.\u201d She stepped until they were a mere inch apart. The cur might be twice her height and three times her weight, but she was a pureblood and her strength would always be superior. \u201cSalvatore needs us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat can we do?\u201d Hess demanded. \u201cIf we get close to Briggs, he will just use us against Salvatore.\u201d</p><p>Hardly a newsflash. She\u2019d already realized the danger of allowing the curs near the cabin. Which was the only reason they weren\u2019t charging to the rescue. But she wasn\u2019t prepared to sit around doing nothing.</p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have to be near. Salvatore\u2019s the king. Can\u2019t he use you as a boost to his powers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. But...\u201d</p><p>Harley\u2019s heart faltered at the sudden scowl that marred Hess\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cBut what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t feel him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean he\u2019s not calling on your powers, or you can\u2019t feel him at all?\u201d</p><p>His hand shifted to press against his chest. \u201cI can\u2019t feel him at all. There\u2019s something blocking our bond.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMagic?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt has to be.\u201d</p><p>Damn Briggs. He obviously still had enough black magic to interfere in Salvatore\u2019s connection to his pack.</p><p>\u201cWhy do I still sense him?\u201d</p><p>Hess shrugged. \u201cIt must be the mating bond.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA fat lot of good that\u2019s going to do,\u201d she muttered, then her eyes widened. \u201cWait. Can Salvatore use it to gain strength?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly from you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d Harley returned to pacing, the ball of fear in the pit of her stomach becoming unbearable. \u201cThis is bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally bad,\u201d Hess agreed, his voice grim.</p><p>\u201cThere has to be something.\u201d Her steps slowed as she was struck by a sudden realization. \u201cWait. I\u2019m the queen.\u201d</p><p>Hess regarded her warily, as if wondering if she was laying some sort of trap.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I should be able to do the whole...\u201d She waved her hands. \u201cSucking power thing, shouldn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>He stiffened, his obsession with formality offended by her casual manner.</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t make fun of our bond with Salvatore,\u201d he rasped, his unwavering loyalty to the King of Weres shining in his eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s an ancient tradition.\u201d</p><p>She bit back the urge to tell the cur that the feudal days were long gone and the serfs had been freed.</p><p>She was slowly beginning to accept that the rituals and customs that were so important among the werewolves weren\u2019t just an antiquated means of keeping the curs enslaved, as Caine had always claimed. They were a tangible expression of the intimate bonds that held a pack together.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, but can we worry about political correctness later, Hess?\u201d She reached to lay her hand on his stiff arm. \u201cI need to know if I can be a...\u201d She searched for the proper word. \u201cA conduit to share your powers with Salvatore.\u201d</p><p>Hess gave a helpless lift of his hands. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>She made a sound of impatience, her fingers digging into his arm.</p><p>\u201cThen help me try,\u201d she charged. \u201cI don\u2019t even know where to begin. How does Salvatore do it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe just...\u201d Hess halted, clearly at a loss. \u201cDoes it.\u201d</p><p>Does it?</p><p>Well, that helped a butt-load.</p><p>Biting her bottom lip, Harley tried to ignore the gnawing sense that Salvatore was in danger. Instead, she concentrated on the vague tingle of distress that she was certain was coming from Hess.</p><p>She didn\u2019t know how she could feel it, but she did know that she hadn\u2019t noticed it until she had actually touched the cur.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I want everyone in a circle,\u201d she said, ignoring the frowns of the curs as she urged them into the center of the vestibule. \u201cNow take the hand of the person on each side of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you think I\u2019m going to sing \u201cKumbaya,\u201d then you\u2019re out of your mind,\u201d the blond-headed cur muttered.</p><p>\u201cShut up.\u201d She glanced around the circle, grabbing the female cur\u2019s hand on one side, and Hess\u2019s on the other. \u201cIf you want to help Salvatore, then I need you to concentrate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cConcentrate on what?\u201d Hess demanded.</p><p>Wondering how the hell she\u2019d gotten in so far over her head, Harley closed her eyes and filled her mind with the image of Salvatore.</p><p>\u201cMe,\u201d she muttered. \u201cConcentrate on me.\u201d</p><p>Laying facedown on the ground, Salvatore planted his hands on the floor and willed his stiff limbs to cooperate. Dio. He could already hear Briggs digging his claws into the floorboards as he prepared for another attack.</p><p>Now was the time for the grand heroics he had planned.</p><p>If only he could get to his feet.</p><p>He turned his head, preparing to push himself upright, when a glint of silver caught his eye. Pausing, he pressed his head back to the filthy floor, peering under the sofa.</p><p>Of course.</p><p>Briggs\u2019s stash of weapons.</p><p>He never left home without them.</p><p>Now, the question was whether he could battle through the black magic still clinging to his body and find the strength to get his hands on the weapons before Briggs killed him.</p><p>Blood dripped from his shredded shoulder and he had at least a half dozen broken bones, but he managed to get to his knees. He would crawl if he had to.</p><p>Intent on reaching the sofa, it took Salvatore a moment to notice the stench of Briggs was being replaced by a hint of musk and pure, rich earth.</p><p>The scent of pack.</p><p>Fear jolted through him. Merda. His curs couldn\u2019t be stupid enough to risk coming to the cabin. Not when they had to know that they would be used as weapons against him.</p><p>It took a long moment to realize the scent was coming from him. And that it was strong enough to have made Briggs hesitate in wary confusion.</p><p>Painfully rising to his feet, Salvatore felt an unexpected heat flow through his blood, searing away the vile magic and healing his body. He shuddered as sensation returned to his deadened body, deepening his connection to his mate.</p><p>Harley.</p><p>This had to be her doing.</p><p>Somehow she had tapped into the power of the pack and allowed it to flow through their mating bond.</p><p>Clever woman.</p><p>Perhaps sensing his prey was no longer helpless, and worse, about to kick his ass, Briggs threw back his head and howled with a fury that shook the rafters. Then, bunching his muscles, he launched his massive body through the air.</p><p>Salvatore was already moving.</p><p>No longer hampered by the black magic, he swiftly grabbed the nearby sofa and smashed it into Briggs, sending him flying into the far wall.</p><p>There was a sharp yelp as the Were hit with enough force to crack the wall, but Salvatore\u2019s attention was on the pile of swords and silver daggers that had been hidden beneath the nasty sofa. Reaching down, he snatched a long sword from the pile, and whirling toward the center of the room, he spread his legs and balanced himself on the balls of his feet.</p><p>He would be stronger and faster if he shifted, but removing the bastard\u2019s head would be easier with a sword than with his fangs, if not quite as satisfying. He no longer wanted to drag out the death of the traitor with a slow, painful torture.</p><p>He wanted the world rid of Briggs.</p><p>Now.</p><p>Prepared for the next attack, Salvatore watched Briggs regain his footing, his crimson eyes flashing with hatred, and his fur bristled with a battle lust. The Were was crazed, with a combination of pain and frustration, and obviously incapable of rational thought.</p><p>Otherwise he would have fled the cabin and prayed he could find a deep dark cave to hide in. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Crouching low, Briggs pulled his lips back to reveal his fangs that dripped with Salvatore\u2019s blood. Then, remaining low to the ground, he charged, his jaws snapping open as he prepared to hamstring Salvatore.</p><p>Salvatore didn\u2019t hesitate.</p><p>The sword flashed downward in a smooth arc, slicing deep into the werewolf\u2019s shoulder. It wasn\u2019t a killing blow, but the blade cut through muscle and tendons, crippling the Were. Briggs snarled, but he was too far gone to give a crap that he was badly wounded.</p> <p>Sinking his fangs into the back of Salvatore\u2019s leg, he tried to yank Salvatore to the ground, snarling in frustration as his wounded leg buckled, refusing to give him leverage.</p><p>Salvatore grimaced in pain, using the hilt of the sword to smash into Briggs\u2019s muzzle, ripping his fangs from Salvatore\u2019s thigh and breaking the pureblood\u2019s jaw in the process.</p><p>\u201cIt appears that my reunion with Mackenzie will have to be postponed,\u201d he taunted, his sword already swinging toward the Were\u2019s throat. \u201cBut I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll be happy to welcome you back.\u201d</p><p>With a belated attempt at self-preservation, Briggs scrambled backwards, the putrid scent of rotting flesh thick in the air. Gagging at the stench, Salvatore never allowed his stroke to falter, putting his full strength behind the blow.</p><p>Cristo. Enough was enough.</p> <p>With deadly accuracy, the sword hit the Were directly on the neck, the impact jolting through Salvatore\u2019s body even as the blade slid through the flesh and bone.</p><p>There was no sound as Briggs\u2019s head toppled from his body, his crimson eyes still filled with his twisted loathing. Grimacing, Salvatore swiftly cut out the bastard\u2019s heart and backed away as a sluggish trickle of blood oozed from the life-ending wounds.</p><p>Merda. Briggs\u2019s carcass smelled even worse dead.</p><p>Salvatore would have bet good money that wasn\u2019t possible.</p><p>And more disturbing, there was a nasty tingle of black magic that was beginning to swirl through the air.</p><p>Holding the sword as if it could keep back the unpleasant chill filling the cabin, Salvatore unconsciously shook his head in denial.</p> <p>No. He couldn\u2019t rise from the dead again.</p><p>Not without the powers of his demon lord.</p><p>Logically accepting that the nightmare was at an end, however, didn\u2019t keep Salvatore from continuing to back away as he waited for Briggs\u2019s body to return to its human form.</p><p>He\u2019d been played and manipulated like a mindless putz for centuries.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t taking anything for granted.</p><p>The sound of Salvatore\u2019s breathing was the only sound to break the thick silence. Then, at last, a faint shimmer covered the mutilated corpse.</p><p>Expecting the transformation back to human form, Salvatore hissed in shock as the head and body began to darken and then disintegrate, as if it were turning to ash before his eyes.</p><p>Dio. The bastard was...dissolving.</p> <p>Salvatore resisted the perfectly sensible urge to flee in horror. He could only assume that this was a consequence of the spell that had brought Briggs back to life. After all, he\u2019d been nothing more than a pile of ash after Salvatore had been done with him the first time. It was, perhaps, only to be expected that he would return to his original form once he was no longer a puppet of the demon lord.</p><p>Salvatore had never been particularly squeamish, but he found his stomach heaving as the last of Briggs vanished into a pile on the floorboards.</p><p>It was a suitable end to the traitor, but still unnerving as hell.</p><p>At last accepting that there wasn\u2019t going to be another Lazareth act, Salvatore tossed aside his sword and crossed the barren room to grab the candle set in the windowsill.</p><p>Then with a brief prayer, he tossed the candle to the center of the room and walked out the front door.</p><p>He\u2019d barely reached the edge of the tree line when the cabin was consumed in flames.</p><p>The end of his past.</p><p>And the beginning of his future.</p><p>A smile of anticipation curved his lips.</p><p>Epilogue</p><p>It was approaching midnight when Harley wandered through the hallways of Styx\u2019s Chicago mansion.</p><p>It had been over a week since she and Salvatore had escaped from the demon lord, but this was the first time she had ventured out of the massive guest rooms.</p><p>A smile of pure satisfaction curved her lips.</p><p>Actually, she\u2019d barely been out of bed for the past week.</p><p>Why should she have?</p><p>She had everything she needed.</p><p>A gorgeous, totally edible mate who devoted himself utterly to keeping her satisfied. A hot tub to soak away the sore muscles after marathon bouts of sex. Fabulous food delivered to the door by a discreet vampire.</p><p>Nothing less than nirvana.</p><p>Tonight, however, was a full moon and Salvatore had taken off at sunset for a wild run through the surrounding countryside. He\u2019d urged her to join him. Even if she didn\u2019t shift, she could feel the tug of the moon and the desire to be out in the night, running free, but she had firmly declined.</p><p>As much as she\u2019d enjoyed the past few days, she knew that they were stolen moments that were swiftly coming to an end.</p><p>Salvatore was the King of Weres, and while he\u2019d spent a portion of each day speaking with various pack leaders on the phone or by computer, she understood that he couldn\u2019t remain in virtual isolation.</p><p>And she had her own duties, she reminded herself with a faint grimace.</p><p>Somehow during her efforts to link her powers with the curs to help Salvatore defeat Briggs, she\u2019d bonded the poor schmucks to her. A stroke of luck since the whole bonding thing managed to heal their broken spirits, but a bit unnerving since they had decided they were now her personal guards, and refused to leave the mansion without her.</p><p>At some point she had to decide what the heck to do with them.</p><p>First, however, she wanted to spend some time with her sister.</p><p>So, giving Salvatore a lingering kiss, she\u2019d sent him on his furry way and pulled on a pair of jeans and tank top to go in search of Darcy.</p><p>A half hour later, she managed to stumble across her in a peach-and-ivory room that had been converted to a private theater, with a huge plasma TV and several over-stuffed couches. Darcy was curled on the center sofa, a tray beside her that held a large bowl of popcorn and a large thermos.</p><p>Sensing her arrival, Darcy pressed a button on the remote to pause the movie and gestured for Harley to join her.</p><p>Walking across the ivory carpet, Harley settled on the couch, tucking her feet beneath her in a mirror image of her sister.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not interrupting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood grief, no. I hoped you would join me tonight.\u201d Darcy reached for the thermos. \u201cSalvatore has been entirely too selfish with your time.\u201d</p><p>Harley laughed, a delicious heat racing through her blood at the memory of Salvatore\u2019s insatiable hunger.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not entirely to blame.\u201d</p><p>Darcy flashed a wicked smile. \u201cGood for you. Hot chocolate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds perfect.\u201d Allowing her sister to press the large mug into her hand, Harley glanced toward the TV, her brows raising as she realized what her sister was watching. \u201cTerminator? I would have guessed you were more a Singin\u2019 in the Rain fan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding me?\u201d Darcy waggled her brows. \u201cA chance to see Arnold naked? Priceless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d Harley held up her mug in a toast to man candy everywhere. \u201cTo a naked Arnold.\u201d</p><p>Darcy touched her mug to Harley\u2019s. \u201cHere, here.\u201d</p><p>Sipping the creamy chocolate, Harley settled into the soft cushions.</p><p>\u201cI assumed Styx would be with you.\u201d</p><p>Darcy grimaced. \u201cHe\u2019s busy on his throne.\u201d</p><p>Harley gave a choked laugh. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s having an official powwow with Dante and Viper. I think even Cezar stopped by.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrouble?\u201d</p><p>Darcy\u2019s smile faded, concern darkening her eyes. \u201cLevet is still missing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...I thought he\u2019d been captured by Caine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparently not. Your curs said that they found no trace of him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn.\u201d Harley frowned in dismay. She\u2019d only known the tiny creature a short time, but she\u2019d become attached to him. \u201cHe helped to save me and Salvatore from Caine\u2019s cell. I hope he\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo do I. He acts tough, but he\u2019s not as indestructible as he wants others to believe.\u201d</p><p>Harley reached to grab her sister\u2019s hand, offering what comfort she could.</p><p>\u201cI have to admit I\u2019m surprised that Styx and the other vampires would be bothered by Levet\u2019s disappearance. I had a fairly strong feeling they found him annoying.\u201d</p><p>Darcy squeezed her fingers, her smile wry. \u201cStyx knows how much Levet means to me, but the vampires are far more concerned with the disappearance of Tane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTane?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYet another vampire.\u201d</p><p>Harley had a vague memory of Salvatore mentioning the vampire, but nothing more.</p><p>\u201cWhat does he have to do with Levet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLevet said he was following Tane\u2019s trail the last time we heard from him.\u201d</p><p>Okay, that didn\u2019t sound good.</p><p>Still, it wasn\u2019t like a babe lost in the woods.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s not many things that can hurt a vamp,\u201d she pointed out. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cEspecially not Tane,\u201d Darcy readily agreed. \u201cHe\u2019s a Charon.\u201d</p><p>Charon? Somehow Harley didn\u2019t think he was a ferryman.</p><p>\u201cIs that some sort of ubervamp?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI suppose you could call him that. They\u2019re trained assassins who hunt down vampires who have gone rogue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYikes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, my thought exactly.\u201d</p><p>Harley sipped her hot chocolate, wondering what would induce a vampire to choose such a dangerous position. It certainly wouldn\u2019t make him popular among the clans.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not much of a surprise he would vanish. He has to have a lot of enemies.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cActually, he wasn\u2019t on the job, so to speak,\u201d Darcy confessed. \u201cHe was with Salvatore when they discovered the presence of a jinn. He followed her trail while Salvatore continued his pursuit of Caine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Setting aside her mug, Harley rose to her feet, a scowl marring her brow. She\u2019d forgotten that Caine\u2019s demon had disappeared during his disastrous journey to Hannibal. Now she felt a pang of fear for the poor creature. \u201cWhy would he care about a jinn?\u201d</p><p>Darcy tilted her head to the side, clearly puzzled by her sister\u2019s concern.</p><p>\u201cFrom what I understand, it\u2019s the fact that she\u2019s a half-breed that has everyone all wound up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTheir powers are supposedly unstable.\u201d</p> <p>Salvatore had mentioned his fear of the jinn, but it hadn\u2019t occurred to her that the vampires would be hunting her down as if she were an animal.</p><p>The thought made her heart twist in sympathy.</p><p>Despite the fact that Caine had always kept the jinn at a distance, Harley had always felt an unspoken bond with the beautiful creature.</p><p>They both had their reasons for hiding from the world.</p><p>\u201cWhat will they do to her if they find her?\u201d</p><p>With an abrupt motion, Darcy set aside her mug and rose to her feet, crossing to grab Harley\u2019s hands.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Harley, I never even thought about that. Was she a friend of yours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot exactly a friend. Caine kept her isolated from the rest of us,\u201d Harley corrected. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think she would be a threat to anyone. She always seemed so...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrightened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrightened of Caine?\u201d</p><p>Harley shook her head. The few occasions she\u2019d seen the jinn in the company of Caine, she hadn\u2019t picked up any vibes that the pretty demon was scared of Caine. But there had been something that haunted her eyes.</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so.\u201d Harley shrugged. \u201cHe kept her locked in a private lair, but she wasn\u2019t his prisoner. At least no more than I was.\u201d</p><p>Anger rippled over Darcy\u2019s face at the mention of Caine\u2019s role in protecting the bastard who had stolen them from the nursery. Not to mention putting her sister Regan through hell. Then, with a shake of her head, she returned her attention to the missing jinn.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe left more than once and returned of her own free will.\u201d</p><p>Darcy sucked in a startled breath, her eyes wide. \u201cThen she might be trying to get back to Caine?\u201d</p><p>Harley chewed her bottom lip, debating whether to tell a lie. She didn\u2019t want to be responsible for the death of the poor jinn.</p><p>Then again, she was fairly certain that Darcy would sense any attempt at deception.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s possible,\u201d she grudgingly admitted. \u201cI think he has a way of keeping her hidden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to tell Styx.\u201d With a brief kiss on Harley\u2019s cheek, Darcy was headed for the door. \u201cHe\u2019ll want to track down Caine and find out if he\u2019s seen the jinn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDarcy, wait.\u201d Harley called.</p><p>Her sister halted in the doorway. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you ask them not to kill her until they find out for sure whether or not she\u2019s dangerous?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Darcy paused, a slow smile curving her lips. \u201cHarley?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf they manage to find Caine, do you want him brought back to you? Styx would be happy to tie him up with a bow if you want.\u201d</p><p>Harley rolled her eyes. \u201cOnly if Salvatore doesn\u2019t find him first. I\u2019m assuming he already has his pack out looking for Caine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, you know me so well, il mia amore.\u201d The dark, richly masculine voice filled the room as Salvatore pushed open a French door behind her and stepped in from the garden.</p><p>\u201cI think that\u2019s my cue to make myself scarce.\u201d With a wink toward Harley, Darcy had disappeared down the hallway.</p><p>Harley barely noticed her departure.</p><p>Who could blame her?</p><p>What female on the face of the earth wouldn\u2019t be entranced by Salvatore prowling toward her wearing nothing more than a pair of faded jeans he\u2019d obviously just pulled on after shifting?</p><p>She breathed in his rich, musky scent, allowing her gaze to savor the magnificent sight of his smooth bronzed skin stretched over chiseled muscles, and the spill of raven hair that framed his lean, starkly beautiful face.</p><p>A sexy, dangerous predator that made her heart skip and her blood heat.</p><p>Easily sensing her appreciation for his raw masculinity, Salvatore wrapped her in his arms and studied her upturned face with a promising glow in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI like the way your sister thinks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s kind of obvious.\u201d She wiggled against the hard thrust of his arousal. \u201cBehave yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying.\u201d He buried his face in the curve of her neck. \u201cMmmm. Sweet vanilla.\u201d</p><p>Harley\u2019s eyes fluttered closed as a heady rush of pleasure exploded through her, the feel of his teeth nipping at her vulnerable throat nearly sending her over the edge. But with effort, she forced herself to arch away from his exquisite nibbles.</p><p>Salvatore was way too talented in distracting her.</p><p>\u201cSo, do you have a hit squad out for Caine?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>His eyes narrowed. \u201cWould it bother you if I did?\u201d</p><p>Would it?</p><p>\u201cI...don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Salvatore scowled, not pleased by her hedging. \u201cThe bastard nearly helped to destroy the Weres, not to mention holding you hostage for the past thirty years.\u201d</p><p>Harley grimaced. Hell, she wanted revenge as much as the next person. She\u2019d been used and manipulated and terrified by the damned cur.</p><p>But that was all in the past.</p><p>Nothing mattered now but the future.</p><p>Her future with Salvatore.</p><p>\u201cI could care less about Caine, but he does have a large number of curs who are loyal to him.\u201d She framed his face in her hands. \u201cIt\u2019s time for peace, Your Majesty.\u201d</p><p>He heaved a rueful sigh. \u201cThere\u2019s no hit squad. I\u2019ve simply made it clear that I would be pleased with anyone who could give me information on the cur\u2019s current location.\u201d</p><p>She snorted, well aware that any pureblood who managed to get their hands on Caine was going to make his life pure misery.</p><p>\u201cYou make it sound so very civilized.\u201d</p><p>He arched a raven brow. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t be implying that I\u2019m a savage, would you?\u201d</p><p>Her thumb brushed the sensuous curve of his lower lip. \u201cWhen you want to be.\u201d</p><p>The gold of his eyes flooded the room as he studied her with smug pleasure.</p><p>\u201cYou can be something of a savage yourself, cara.\u201d</p><p>She chuckled. It was true. With Salvatore\u2019s urging, she\u2019d become downright aggressive in bed.</p><p>With stunning results.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t heard you complaining,\u201d she murmured, draping her arms around his neck.</p><p>\u201cNever.\u201d His eyes darkened with a tender emotion he kept hidden from all but her. \u201cYou are perfect in every way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m your mate. You have to say that.\u201d</p><p>His hands skimmed up her back, pulling her close as he gazed deep in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cNot just my mate,\u201d he husked. \u201cWhat we have between us is more than biology or ancient powers, Harley. I adore you. I crave you. And most of all, I love you.\u201d</p><p>Her heart clenched with a joy she\u2019d never dreamed possible. \u201cForever?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeyond eternity.\u201d He bent to brush a gentle kiss over her lips.</p><p>Her knees threatened to buckle. Damn him. He knew how emotional she became when he was all sentimental.</p><p>\u201cI love you, too, Salvatore Giuliani,\u201d she husked, her voice thick with tears.</p><p>With a last lingering kiss, Salvatore pulled back, a teasing smile on his lips.</p><p>\u201cNaturally.\u201d</p><p>She punched his arm, but secretly she couldn\u2019t deny a flare of relief. It was going to take time for her to become comfortable with the mushy stuff.</p><p>\u201cYour modesty overwhelms me.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled, his eyes flashing with wicked amusement. \u201cI have a better way to overwhelm you.\u201d</p><p>Amen to that.</p><p>She shivered, but once again she resisted the urge to give into temptation.</p><p>\u201cDo you intend to wait here until Caine is discovered?\u201d</p><p>His smile faded. \u201cI know you wish to spend time with your sister, cara, but the packs are anxious to meet their new queen. We must begin our grand tour soon.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Harley wrinkled her nose. \u201cGrand tour?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur mating has brought back traditions nearly forgotten by the purebloods.\u201d He kissed the tip of her nose. \u201cIn the ancient days, the King of Weres would perform the Sylnivia when he became mated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd just what does this...Sylnivia entail?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing too outlandish.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cWe will travel to meet our various packs and receive the blessing of our people.\u201d He paused, the smile slowly returning to his mouth. \u201cIt\u2019s supposed to ensure our fertility.\u201d</p><p>Harley abruptly cleared her throat.</p><p>She wouldn\u2019t get a more perfect segue.</p><p>\u201cActually\u2014\u201d She licked her suddenly dry lips. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to be needing help in the fertility department.\u201d</p><p>Salvatore froze, his hands gripping her with a sudden tension. \u201cHarley?\u201d</p><p>She shifted, feeling awkward beneath the searing intensity of his gaze.</p><p>\u201cWhen I woke up this morning, I felt weird.\u201d She unconsciously pressed a hand to her stomach. \u201cAt first I assumed it had something to do with our bond. It\u2019s been...a little erratic.\u201d</p><p>Looking decidedly shell-shocked, Salvatore obediently nodded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still struggling with my powers,\u201d he muttered absently.</p><p>Harley smiled. That was the understatement of the century. Over the past week, Salvatore had accidentally shorted out the electricity, yanked the bathroom door off its hinges, drained Harley of her power one minute, and the next filled her with such energy she was nearly bouncing off the walls.</p><p>Which, of course, explained why she had first dismissed the bundle of warmth her wolf sensed in her womb.</p><p>As the day passed, however, she could no longer ignore the truth.</p><p>It was the spark of life.</p><p>Actually, her werewolf was whispering that it was several sparks of life.</p><p>Barely more than a few days old, but already growing strong.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019ve noticed,\u201d she teased.</p><p>\u201cHarley.\u201d He stopped, clearly struggling to breathe. \u201cAre you saying...?\u201d</p><p>She went on tiptoe to press her lips to his. \u201cYou\u2019re going to become a proud papa, Salvatore Giuliani.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPapa.\u201d For a crazed moment he swayed as if he might pass out. Then without warning, he sank to his knees, pressing his face to her flat abdomen. \u201cI knew you were my savior, cara, but now you have given hope to the entire race of werewolves.\u201d Tilting back his head, he gazed at her with such profound respect that Harley had to fight back the urge to weep. \u201cYou are a miracle.\u201d</p> <p>She gently threaded her fingers through his raven hair. \u201cI think you might have had a little something to do with this particular miracle.\u201d</p><p>His fingers brushed over her stomach, treating her as if she were as fragile as spun glass, even as his face darkened with sudden concern.</p><p>\u201cHow are you feeling? Are you sick? We have to get you to a doctor...\u201d</p><p>\u201cSalvatore, I\u2019m fine,\u201d she interrupted, belatedly realizing that her mate\u2019s protective instincts were about to kick into hyperdrive. Frigging hell. She would be smothered if she didn\u2019t nip a few of them in the bud. Firmly she tugged him to his feet and laid her head on his chest, taking comfort in the steady beat of his heart. \u201cObviously we\u2019ll have to find a doctor who will help me through the pregnancy, but I\u2019m not the first woman to have babies. It\u2019s all perfectly natural.\u201d</p><p>He pulled back to glare at her casual tone. \u201cI don\u2019t care about other women, only you. We\u2019ll travel straight to our lair in Italy tomorrow. I have a number of doctors at my disposal, as well as a full staff of servants to make sure you have nothing to worry about but taking care of yourself.\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cBut what about the Sylnivia?\u201d</p><p>He blinked, looking at her as if she\u2019d lost her mind. \u201cNaturally, it will have to be postponed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no \u2018naturally\u2019 about it.\u201d She caught and held his gaze, her expression warning. \u201cI told you I feel fine, Salvatore, and if you try to treat me like a mindless child who can\u2019t decide what\u2019s best for herself, you\u2019re not going to like the consequences.\u201d</p><p>His lips parted, then snapped shut as he studied her stubborn expression. Finally he heaved a sigh of resignation and pressed her head back to his chest.</p><p>\u201cI will try to be reasonable,\u201d he grudgingly promised. \u201cBut it\u2019s not going to be easy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd our grand tour?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cWe will decide on the Sylnivia after you\u2019ve seen a doctor.\u201d</p><p>She knew it was as good as she was going to get. \u201cFine. We can no doubt find a competent doctor here in Chicago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll speak to the local pack master.\u201d There was a pause as Salvatore ran his hand gently over her hair. \u201cHarley?\u201d</p><p>She tilted back her head to meet his wary gaze. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you...\u201d</p><p>She frowned as his words faltered, his expression oddly uncertain. It wasn\u2019t like her arrogant mate to be anything but supremely self-confident.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you happy?\u201d</p><p>She frowned at the ridiculous question. Her heart felt as if it might burst with joy.</p><p>\u201cOf course I\u2019m happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot so long ago you accused me of wanting you only for the babies you could give me,\u201d he softly reminded her, his gaze watchful. \u201cI don\u2019t want you thinking I...\u201d</p><p>Harley grabbed his face and yanked it down so she could halt his words with a kiss that was filled with all the love and wonder that flowed through her heart.</p><p>\u201cSalvatore, I said a lot of stupid things over the past few days,\u201d she murmured against his lips. \u201cI was scared and stubborn...\u201d</p><p>\u201cInsanely stubborn,\u201d he clarified.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t push your luck, wolfman.\u201d She nipped his bottom lip, chuckling at his low growl of approval. \u201cI was an idiot, but now I can\u2019t imagine anything I want more than to have you as a mate, and our home filled with children.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d His tension eased from his body, although his expression remained wary. \u201cJust how many children are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCristo.\u201d He blinked, clearly stunned, then with a loud crack of laughter, he wrapped her in his arms and twirled her around the room. \u201cYou\u2019re the most amazing woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmazing or not, I\u2019m going to be sick if you don\u2019t put me down,\u201d she teased.</p><p>Instantly she was back on her feet, Salvatore\u2019s fingers threading through her hair as he kissed her with exquisite tenderness.</p><p>\u201cYou do know what this means, don\u2019t you, cara?\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to have to learn how to change diapers?\u201d</p><p>He pulled back, the golden eyes flashing with wicked amusement.</p><p>\u201cSi. And also how to appreciate the rare moments when I have my mate\u2019s undivided attention.\u201d His fingers traced a path of fire down her back. \u201cThey will soon be few and far between.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmmm. Did you have something in mind?\u201d</p><p>His eyes were lit with a golden hunger that sent a shiver of anticipation down her spine.</p><p>\u201cWe could always return to our rooms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I was just getting ready to watch the movie,\u201d she said, her expression one of faux innocence.</p><p>He glanced toward the screen, his brows lifting in surprise.</p><p>\u201cTerminator?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello. Arnold naked.\u201d She gave a startled squeak as Salvatore scooped her off her feet and firmly headed toward the door. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have something better for you to look at.\u201d</p><p>She wrapped her arms around his neck. \u201cAre you certain?\u201d</p><p>He smiled with smug assurance. \u201cNothing but the best for the Queen of Weres.\u201d</p><p>And it was... </p> </body></html>"]
