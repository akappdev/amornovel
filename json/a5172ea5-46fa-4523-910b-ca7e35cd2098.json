The young girl held an envelope of thick, heavy paper.</p><p>\u201cThis came for you.\u201d</p> <p>A sudden pain pierced Charlotte\u2019s chest, as if something vital had broken inside her. She felt cold and jittery. It was bad news. If it were good news, she would\u2019ve gotten a scryer call. She felt the urge to squeeze and crumple her blond hair in her fingers. She hadn\u2019t done that since she was a child.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she made herself say.</p><p>The maid lingered, concern stamped on her face. \u201cCan I get you anything, my lady?\u201d</p><p>Charlotte shook her head.</p><p>Laisa studied her for a long moment, reluctantly crossed the balcony to the door, and went inside.</p> <p>The envelope lay in front of Charlotte. She forced herself to raise her cup of tea to her lips. The rim of the cup shuddered. Her fingers were shaking.</p><p>She focused on that rim, calling on years of practicing control over her emotions. Calm and collected, that was the mantra of the healer. An effective healer is neither callous, nor tenderhearted, her memory whispered in her mind. She doesn\u2019t permit herself to succumb to passion or despair, and she never allows her craft to be compromised by her emotions.</p><p>She had lived by this creed for twenty years. It never failed her.</p><p>Calm above all things.</p><p>Calm.</p><p>Charlotte took a deep breath, counting each rise and fall of her chest. One, two, three, four . . . ten. The cup in her hands was motionless. Charlotte drank from it, set it down, and tore the envelope open. Her fingertips had gone numb. The ornate seal of the Adrianglian Academy of Physicians marked the top of the paper. We regret to inform you . . .</p> <p>Charlotte forced herself to read it, every last word, then stared past the white stone rail of the balcony at the garden below. Down there, a sand-colored brick path ran to the distant trees. Short silvery grass trailed the path on both sides, flanked by a row of low emerald hedges, beyond which flowers bloomed: roses in a dozen shades, their heavy blossoms perfect; constellation shrubs with bunches of star-shaped flowers in crimson, pink, and white; yellow knight spears, their delicate flowerets shaped like tiny bells . . .</p><p>She would not be blooming. She would not bear fruit. The last door had slammed in her face. Charlotte hugged herself. She was barren.</p><p>The word pressed on her, like a crushing physical weight, a heavy anchor around her neck. She would never feel a life grow inside her. She would never pass on her gift or see the shadow of her features in her baby\u2019s face. The treatments and magic of the best healers in Adrianglia had failed. The irony was so thick, she laughed, a bitter brittle sound.</p><p>In the country of Adrianglia, two things mattered most: one\u2019s name and one\u2019s magic. Her family was neither old nor wealthy, and her name was ordinary. Her magic was anything but. At four years old she had healed an injured kitten, and her life took a sharp turn in an unexpected direction.</p><p>Medical talents were rare and highly prized by the realm, so rare that when she was seven, Adrianglia came for her. Her parents explained the situation: she would leave them to study at the Ganer College of Medicinal Arts. Adrianglia would house her, teach her, nurture her magic, and in return upon completion of her education, Charlotte would give the realm ten years of civil service. At the end of that decade, she would be granted a noble title, making her one of the coveted elite, and a small estate. Her parents, in turn, would receive a lump sum of money to soothe their grief at losing a child. Even at that age, she realized she had been sold. Three months later, she left for the College and never returned.</p><p>At ten she was a child wonder; at fourteen, a rising star; and at seventeen, when her service officially began, Charlotte was the best the College had to offer. They called her the Healer and guarded her like a treasure. In anticipation of assuming her title, she had received instruction from the best tutors. Lady Augustine, whose bloodline stretched back through centuries all the way to the Old Continent, had personally overseen her education, ensuring that Charlotte entered Adrianglian society as if she had always belonged within it. Her poise was flawless, her taste refined, her behavior exemplary. By the time she emerged from the College, now Charlotte de Ney, Baroness of Ney and the owner of a small estate, she had healed thousands.</p><p>But she could never heal herself.</p><p>Neither could anyone else. After eighteen months of treatments, experts, and magic, she held the final verdict in her hand. She was barren.</p> <p>Barren. Like a desert. Like a wasteland.</p><p>Why her? Why couldn\u2019t she have a baby? She\u2019d healed countless children, pulling them from the brink of death and returning them to their parents, but the little nursery she had set up next to their bedroom would remain empty. Hadn\u2019t she earned this little bit of happiness? What had she done that was so horrible that she couldn\u2019t have a baby?</p><p>A sob broke from her. Charlotte caught herself and rose. No hysterics. Elvei would have to be told. He would be crushed. Children meant so much to her husband.</p><p>She took the stairs down to the path leading to the northern patio. The old house sprawled in the garden like a lazy white beast, a seemingly random three-story-high collection of rooms, patios, balconies, and stone stairways. The northern patio was on the opposite side of the manor, and she required a few minutes to compose herself. Her husband would need her support. Poor Elvei.</p><p>She had just been settling into her new life when Elvei Leremine came to her with a proposal. She was twenty-eight at the time, barely a year out of the College, and lonely. The life of a Healer didn\u2019t leave much time for romantic pursuits. The idea of being married and sharing her life with another human being suddenly seemed so appealing. Baron Leremine was considerate, gracious, and attractive. He wanted a family, and so did she. When a year had passed with no children, she underwent an examination, taking the first step on the grueling eighteen-month journey.</p><p>She wanted a baby. She would surround her child with love and warmth, and her son or daughter would never have to worry about being ripped out of her arms because even if her talent passed to her baby, she would go to the College with them. Charlotte stopped for a moment and squeezed her eyes shut. There would be no baby.</p><p>A week ago, the months of treatments, tests, and waiting had caught up with her. She felt alone, desperate, and terrified of the future, just as she had when she was seven years old and walking through the massive stone gates of the Ganer College for the first time. And so she sought out the same person who had comforted her then, the woman who became her mother after her natural parents surrendered her. She had gone back to Ganer College to speak with Lady Augustine.</p><p>They had walked through the gardens together, just like she was doing now, drifting along the curved stone paths, the College\u2019s forbidding stone walls behind them. Lady Augustine hadn\u2019t changed much. Dark-haired, graceful, her face classically beautiful, she didn\u2019t walk, she glided. Her demeanor was still regal, her features were elegant, and her magic, which could soothe the most violent psychotic in a breath, still as potent as ever.</p><p>\u201cDo you think this is a punishment?\u201d Charlotte had asked.</p><p>The Lady arched her eyebrows. \u201cPunishment? For what?\u201d</p><p>Charlotte clenched her jaw.</p><p>\u201cYou can tell me anything,\u201d Lady Augustine murmured. \u201cI won\u2019t betray your confidence, sweetheart. You know this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI carry something dark in me. Something vicious. Sometimes I feel an edge of it, looking through my eyes from inside me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou feel the urge?\u201d the older woman said.</p><p>Charlotte nodded. The urge was a constant specter hanging over every healer. They could knit together devastating wounds and purge diseases, but they could also harm. Using the destructive side of their magic was forbidden. \u201cDo no harm\u201d was the opening statement of the healer\u2019s oath. It was the first words of the first lesson she had received, and over the years she had heard it said countless times. Harming was seductive. Those who tried it became addicted and lost themselves to it.</p><p>\u201cIs it growing stronger?\u201d Lady Augustine asked.</p><p>Charlotte nodded.</p><p>\u201cPardon you for being human.\u201d</p><p>What? Charlotte glanced at the older woman.</p><p>A mournful smile curved Lady Augustine\u2019s lips. \u201cMy dear, do you think you\u2019re the first to have these thoughts? Our talents provide us with the means both to heal and to harm. It\u2019s in our nature to do both, yet we\u2019re asked to shut half of ourselves off and heal for years and years. This creates an imbalance. Do you think I haven\u2019t imagined what I could do if I unleashed my power? I could walk into a roomful of diplomats and plunge the country into war. I could incite riots. I could drive people to murder.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte stared at her. Of all people, her adoptive mother was the last person she would imagine having those thoughts.</p><p>\u201cWhat you feel is normal. It\u2019s not a cause for punishment. You\u2019re under a lot of stress, and your body and mind are on the defensive. You put yourself under so much pressure, and that makes you vulnerable. You want to lash out, but Charlotte, you must keep your magic under control.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if I stumble?\u201d Charlotte asked.</p><p>\u201cThere is no such thing as stumbling. You are a healer or you\u2019re an abomination.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte winced.</p><p>\u201cI have faith in you. You know what the consequences are.\u201d</p><p>She knew. Every healer knew about the consequences. Those who harmed turned into plaguebringers, slaves to their own magic, existing only to deliver death and disease. Centuries ago on the Old Continent, an attempt was made to use the plaguebringers as a weapon during a war. Two of the healers had walked out onto the battlefield and let themselves go. Neither army survived, and the plague they unleashed raged for months and smothered entire kingdoms.</p><p>Lady Augustine sighed. \u201cThe realm takes us from our families so young because they seek to indoctrinate us. Even with this careful upbringing, they ask for only ten years of service because what we do wears us out. We give so much of ourselves. We\u2019re the last hope of so many people, and we\u2019re exposed to horrible things: wounds of violence, dying children, families torn by grief. It\u2019s a heavy burden to bear, and it has an effect on you, on me, on all of us. To feel the destructive urges is natural, Charlotte. But acting on them will make you a murderer. Perhaps not right away. Perhaps you can even control it for a time, but in the end, the magic will consume you, and you will walk through the land spreading death. There are no exceptions to this rule. Do not become an abomination, Charlotte.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d She would contain the darkness. She had to\u2014she simply had no choice.</p><p>They walked in silence for a few moments.</p><p>\u201cLet us imagine the worst,\u201d Lady Augustine said. \u201cYou\u2019re infertile.\u201d</p> <p>Charlotte\u2019s heart had skipped a beat. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean you have to be childless. There are hundreds of children waiting to be loved. You can\u2019t give birth, Charlotte. That\u2019s only a small part of being a parent. You can still be a mother and know all the joys and tortures of raising a child. We get too hung up on bloodlines and family names and our own stupid notions of aristocracy. If someone dropped a basket with a baby on your doorstep, would you really hesitate to pick it up because the baby wasn\u2019t of your blood? It\u2019s a baby, a tiny life just waiting to be nurtured. Think on it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have to. I would take the baby,\u201d Charlotte said. She would take it and love it. Whether she carried it to term didn\u2019t matter.</p><p>\u201cOf course you would. You are my daughter in everything but blood, and I know you. I think you\u2019ll make an excellent mother.\u201d</p><p>Tears warmed the back of her eyes. Charlotte kept them in check. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat does your husband think of all of this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChildren are very important to him. His inheritance depends on producing an heir.\u201d</p><p>The older woman rolled her eyes. \u201cConditional succession? Oh, the joys of having a noble bloodline and a little bit of money. Is this some new development? I don\u2019t recall this being a condition of your marital contract.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte sighed. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he mention at any point before your wedding that he required an heir?\u201d</p><p>Charlotte shook her head.</p> <p>Lady Augustine\u2019s face iced over. \u201cI do not appreciate being lied to. When did you find out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen we realized there was a problem with conception.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis was a conversation the two of you should\u2019ve had before either of you signed your name to the contract. Not only that, but it should\u2019ve been formally disclosed.\u201d She looked into the distance, the way she did when she was trying to recall things. \u201cHow could I have been so wrong? He seemed like such a solid match, a temperate man. Unlikely to cause any problems.\u201d</p><p>A temperate man? \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCharlotte, you need someone steady, someone dependable, who will treat you with consideration. You\u2019ve done over a decade\u2019s worth of healing, and your magic is starved and tired of doing the same thing over and over. It doesn\u2019t take much to upset this apple cart. That\u2019s why I remained here.\u201d Lady Augustine indicated the garden with an elegant sweep of her hand. \u201cSerenity, beauty, and a low likelihood of psychological or physical trauma. That\u2019s why after a bloody war, some veterans become monks.\u201d</p><p>So what, she was somehow too fragile to live her life outside of College walls? Charlotte gritted her teeth. \u201cPerhaps Elvei didn\u2019t know about the conditions for succession.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh no, he knew. We grow up knowing, Charlotte. He deliberately hid it because I would\u2019ve never given my consent to your wedding.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte raised her head. \u201cIf he made that a requirement of the marriage contract, I wouldn\u2019t have married him. I didn\u2019t want to enter into a contract to produce a baby. I wanted a marriage, and I think he did, too.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe wanted children with a healing talent,\u201d the older woman said.</p><p>Charlotte stopped.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, sweetheart,\u201d Lady Augustine said. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have said that. It was coarse of me. I\u2019m so furious, and it\u2019s clouding my judgment. It\u2019s my fault. This was exactly the sort of thing I was trying to avoid, and I\u2019ve failed you. I\u2019m so, so sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a child,\u201d Charlotte said. \u201cI\u2019m almost thirty, and I\u2019m responsible for my marriage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re educated, but Ganer College hasn\u2019t prepared you for the realities of the world outside these walls. It doesn\u2019t matter how old you are, you don\u2019t have the experience of interacting with people outside a controlled environment. You\u2019ve never been betrayed, hurt, or tricked. You\u2019ve never suffered humiliation. I look into people\u2019s souls every day, and what I see there fills me with joy, but also with dread. I wanted so much to spare you.\u201d</p><p>She was talking as if the end of her marriage was a foregone conclusion. \u201cMy marriage isn\u2019t over, and Elvei isn\u2019t some sort of callous villain. So he didn\u2019t tell me about his succession. It\u2019s a rather regrettable oversight, but we will deal with it. I understand that love doesn\u2019t happen overnight, but I think he cares for me, and I care for him, deeply. We\u2019ve lived together for almost three years. We wake up in the same bed. He told me he loved me when I began the fertility treatments.\u201d</p><p>Lady Augustine studied her. \u201cPerhaps you\u2019re right, and he simply loves you. If he truly cares for you, he\u2019ll deal with it.\u201d</p><p>They took another step. The mix of worry and anxiety roiled inside Charlotte. Heat rose behind her eyes, and she clamped her hand over her mouth.</p><p>Lady Augustine opened her arms.</p><p>Charlotte\u2019s last defenses snapped. She stepped into the welcoming embrace and cried.</p><p>\u201cMy sweetheart, my precious one. It will be all right,\u201d Lady Augustine soothed, holding her. \u201cIt will be all right. Let it all out.\u201d</p><p>But it wasn\u2019t all right, and now Charlotte had to tell Elvei about it.</p><p>What they said about coming to love a person you live with was true: she had come to love him. He was always kind to her, and she could use some of that kindness now. She felt weak and helpless. So helpless.</p><p>The path brought her to the northern patio. Her husband sat in a chair, drinking his morning tea and peering over papers. Of average height and muscular build, Elvei was handsome in that particular aristocratic blueblood way: precise features, carved with a perfection that seemed a touch distant, square jaw, narrow nose, blue eyes, brown hair with a hint of red. When she woke up next to him, with the morning light playing on his face, she often thought he was beautiful.</p><p>Charlotte came up the steps. Elvei rose and held out a chair for her. She sat and passed him the letter.</p><p>He read it, impassive, his pleasant face calm. She had expected more of a reaction.</p><p>\u201cThis is unfortunate,\u201d Elvei said.</p><p>That\u2019s it? Unfortunate? Her instincts told her something was seriously wrong with that placid expression on his face.</p><p>\u201cI truly care for you,\u201d Elvei said. \u201cVery deeply.\u201d He reached over the table and took her hand in his. \u201cBeing married to you is effortless, Charlotte. I have nothing but admiration for what you do and who you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said. The logical part of her knew she had nothing to do with her infertility. She didn\u2019t cause it, and she had done everything in her power to fix it. She wanted a baby as much as Elvei. But she felt guilty all the same.</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t be.\u201d He leaned back. \u201cIt\u2019s not your fault or mine. It\u2019s just an accident of fate.\u201d</p><p>He was so calm, almost cavalier about it. It would\u2019ve been better if he cursed or threw something. He sat still in his chair, but every word he said was a small step back, increasing the distance between them. \u201cWe can adopt,\u201d she said, hopeful.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you could.\u201d</p><p>Alarm blared in her head. \u201cYou said \u2018you.\u2019 Not \u2018we.\u2019\u201d</p><p>He pushed a piece of paper across the table to her. \u201cI thought that things might turn out this way, so I took the liberty of preparing this.\u201d</p><p>She glanced at the paper. \u201cAnnulment?\u201d Her composure shattered. He might as well have stabbed her. \u201cAfter two and a half years, you want to annul our marriage? Are you out of your mind?\u201d</p><p>Elvei grimaced. \u201cWe\u2019ve been over this before: I have three years from the beginning of marriage to produce an heir. My brother is engaged, Charlotte. I told you about that two months ago. He\u2019ll have three years to produce a child. If I divorce you and remarry, I\u2019ll have six months before becoming ineligible to inherit. You can\u2019t make a baby in six months. I need an annulment, so my three years can restart, or Kalin will get there before me. He still might, all things considered, as marriage takes time . . .\u201d</p><p>This wasn\u2019t happening. \u201cSo you\u2019re just going to pretend that everything we shared in these years doesn\u2019t exist and discard me? Like trash?\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cI told you, I have a great deal of admiration for you. But the purpose of this marriage was to have a family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are a family. You and I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not the kind of family I require. I can\u2019t lose the manor, Charlotte.\u201d</p><p>She was cold and hot at the same time, all hurt and anger iced over by shock. \u201cIs it money? You do realize that I can make us as much money as we need.\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cYou\u2019re so flawless most of the time that occasionally I forget you\u2019re not a blueblood by birth. No, of course, it\u2019s not the money. Whoever owns the manor rules the family. It\u2019s my inheritance; I was born first, I studied most of my life to take care of our family interests, and I won\u2019t let it slip away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just a bloody house!\u201d Her voice snapped.</p><p>Elvei\u2019s composure melted, the polite veneer sliding off him. His voice rose. \u201cIt\u2019s my childhood home. My family goes back sixteen generations. Do you expect me to just let my idiot brother get it while you and I pretend to play house here, in this decrepit ruin? No, thanks. I have higher ambitions in life.\u201d</p><p>The words burned. \u201cIs that what we were doing?\u201d she asked quietly. \u201cWhen you and I made love in our bedroom, we were playing house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be melodramatic. We both enjoyed it, but now we\u2019re done.\u201d</p><p>The outrage swelled in her, mixing with hurt. Last night he\u2019d kissed her before they fell asleep next to each other. This was the man she woke up to every morning? \u201cElvei, you realize, you\u2019re telling me that I have no value to you except as a broodmare?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t make me the villain in this.\u201d Elvei leaned back. \u201cI\u2019ve gone with you to all the tests and treatments. I listened patiently while you got excited over this specialist and that, I sat in the waiting rooms, and I gave it as much time as I could. There are no more treatments left. I just want to have a child, like any normal healthy adult.\u201d</p><p>Every time she thought she had reached the limit of hurt, he twisted the knife a little more, digging deeper and deeper inside her, cutting at a raw wound.</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019m abnormal?\u201d</p> <p>He spread his arms. \u201cCan you conceive? No. You are defective, Charlotte.\u201d</p><p>Defective. He actually called her defective. The pain inside her began to smolder with rage. \u201cI\u2019m curious, what\u2019s the next word you\u2019ll reach for? How cruel will you be, Elvei?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou cost me two and a half years.\u201d</p><p>Two and a half years of disappointment, of painful procedures and shattered hopes, of feeling like she was crippled, but no, it was all about him. She would never have a child of her own, but he only saw himself as the injured party. She should\u2019ve seen this in him. She should\u2019ve known. How could she have been so stupid? \u201cYou\u2019re a terrible human being.\u201d</p><p>He surged to his feet and leaned over the table. \u201cHad I married someone else, I would\u2019ve inherited by now. I tried to end this with as much civility as possible, but you\u2019ve decided to cause a scene. I need an heir, Charlotte, and you can\u2019t give me one. What\u2019s so complicated about this? I\u2019m done letting you waste my time.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou told me you loved me.\u201d She still remembered how his face had looked when he said it.</p><p>\u201cYou needed encouragement to begin the therapy. Dear gods, Charlotte, are you really that naive or are you just stupid?\u201d</p><p>The words slapped her. The darkness inside her shivered, stretching, getting ready to escape. She clenched herself around it, trying to hold it back.</p><p>\u201cLet me spell it out: I married you because of your healing, which you could pass on to our children, and your poise. You are attractive and educated, and I knew that you would never embarrass me in public. Other than that, there wasn\u2019t much to recommend you.\u201d</p><p>The air turned thick and scalding like boiling glue. She couldn\u2019t breathe.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been a blueblood for less than three years. My family came to this continent on the Second Fleet, and they were already titled.\u201d</p> <p>The darkness writhed inside her, begging to be released.</p><p>\u201cMy father is an earl; my mother was a baroness prior to their union. Your father is a cook and your mother is a waitress. In what world could you possibly think that you were in any way equal to me? I granted you a favor. I flattered you by my proposal, Charlotte, and you fell short. Accept it with dignity. I believe an apology is in order.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d pushed the blade so far into the wound that he reached the darkness she hid deep inside. Her defenses burst. The darkness slithered out, coating her skin from the inside out. \u201cYou\u2019re right. You will sit down now and apologize to me.\u201d Menace suffused her voice.</p><p>He stared at her. \u201cYou\u2019re hardly in a position to give me orders.\u201d</p><p>Her magic slid out of her and wrapped over her arms, curving around her body in rivulets of black backlit with deep, intense red. She had never seen it red before. The pale gold of healing, yes, hundreds of times. But this dark, furious black and red? No. So this is what the magic of an abomination looks like.</p><p>\u201cI can blight your entire family, you moron. I am the Healer. Pick a plague, and your sixteen generations will end right now.\u201d</p><p>Elvei\u2019s mouth gaped. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>The magic lashed out from her like a striking serpent and bit him. Elvei jerked, his face puzzled. She felt her magic sting him, cutting at the lining of his throat, and a rush of unexpected pleasure flooded her. Oh gods. Fear shot through Charlotte. She jerked the dark current back, pulling her power into herself. She\u2019d let it have just a merest taste, a tiny bite, but it wanted more, and she had to strain to keep it contained.</p> <p>Elvei coughed, harder and harder, clamping his hand over his mouth. Blood dripped from between his fingers, staining his skin with bright, hot scarlet.</p><p>He started to rise but froze halfway.</p><p>She realized she hated him, and hurting him made her happy. Power coursed through her, grim but exhilarating. Her magic begged for more.</p><p>No. She couldn\u2019t let it.</p><p>\u201cSit.\u201d</p><p>He dropped into the chair.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have your annulment,\u201d she said. \u201cHowever, you have lived here all this time, and since you don\u2019t wish to be treated as my husband, I will treat you as my boarder. You\u2019ll reimburse me for rent, food, clothing, gifts, and the services of my staff. You came into this sham marriage with nothing, and you will leave with nothing.\u201d</p><p>It was a small price to pay, but she couldn\u2019t just let him walk away free and clear. Her anger wouldn\u2019t let her. She had to have a nominal compensation. If she didn\u2019t, her magic would exact its own price.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have that kind of money,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not interested in your financial troubles,\u201d she said. \u201cI financially supported you all these years, and you don\u2019t get to take advantage of me. I\u2019ll have my lawyer draft an invoice, and you will pay it in full, or I will force you to make a much more public apology.\u201d</p><p>All blood left his face. \u201cYou\u2019ll have your money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSend it to the Dawn Mother charity.\u201d The money would go to heal children. Some good would come from this nightmare.</p><p>Her magic begged to have another tiny nip of him. Charlotte clenched her power in her fist and kept it contained. \u201cApologize to me for being a heartless bastard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI apologize,\u201d he said, his voice wooden.</p><p>Charlotte concentrated. Magic coated her arm, the radiant golden hue of healing. \u201cGive me your hand.\u201d</p><p>He stretched his hand over the table. His fingers trembled. She locked her fingers on his wrist, fighting revulsion. They had awakened in the same bed this morning. She\u2019d lain there, thinking that he was handsome and that she would\u2019ve liked to have his children, while he must\u2019ve been going over the conditions of annulment in his head. The document had been drafted by a lawyer, which took time. Elvei must\u2019ve begun the preparations for this moment days ago. Her mind struggled to accept that he could be that cold.</p><p>She forced the thoughts away and concentrated on repairing the lacerations in the lining of his throat that she\u2019d made. A moment, and his internal wounds closed. She released him and wiped her hand on the tablecloth.</p><p>\u201cYou may go. Your things will be sent to you when the charity informs me that your payment has been received.\u201d</p><p>He jumped to his feet and ran out. She sat there, alone, on the patio of a house that no longer felt like home and wondered what she would do next. The dark current of power coiled and twisted around her. She felt its hunger, beckoning her. It wanted to be fed.</p><p>Finally, all the endless lessons and instructions made sense. Her teachers had said that using the healing gift to harm was addicting, but they neglected to mention why. Hurting her ex-husband had brought her pleasure. She wanted to do it again.</p><p>Do not become an abomination, Charlotte.</p><p>There were no exceptions to the rule. The dark magic would resurface, and the joy it brought would consume her. She\u2019d follow its dark lure into the unthinking abyss where only the next moment of pain-induced euphoria would matter. She was a ticking bomb. She had to contain her powers at any cost.</p><p>Charlotte slumped against the chair. She had few options. She could go back to Ganer College and hide away from the world. No, returning to the College where everyone knew her and about her marriage was out of the question. Their pity would drive her over the edge.</p><p>She could remain in the manor and live in seclusion and hope that isolation would reduce the temptation to use the dark side of her magic, but she didn\u2019t want to be Charlotte de Ney either. Lady de Ney was a stupid, naive girl who was blinded by a handsome face and the promise of a happy tomorrow. She had thought that after the years of training and service, she deserved to be loved for who she was, as if love was some sort of a right. If she stayed here, she would have to face her neighbors and friends, and explain why her marriage had been annulled. No, that wouldn\u2019t be a good idea either, especially since Elvei would be moving in the same circles, hunting for a new wife.</p><p>At the memory of Elvei, the magic surged inside her. Charlotte hugged herself. Injuring him felt so good. She could imagine making him sick. Maybe just a little bit. Nothing drastic. She knew where he\u2019d lived before their marriage. He still owned that house and would likely return there. And if he married, she might make his happy blushing bride just a little less vivacious. The thought of it would gnaw at her until it consumed her, then she would do it. It was wrong and evil. She knew it, but she was so worn down and her emotional wounds were too raw. She wasn\u2019t sure how long she could hold out. She had to disappear someplace away from bluebloods, Adrianglia, and Elvei.</p><p>Her memory served up a half-forgotten incident from many years ago when she had been called to heal a group of soldiers. She recalled feeling a strong magic boundary, an invisible wall that seemed to sever their world, and watching the soldiers come through it, one by one, their faces twisted by pain. She spoke to one of them while sealing his wounds. He told her they belonged to the Mirror, a secret counterespionage agency. They had been traveling outside their world, the man had said, in a place where magic was weak. He called it the Edge. The man had been delirious, and she would\u2019ve dismissed him if she hadn\u2019t sensed the invisible wall rising like a barrier of pressurized magic.</p><p>In this Edge, a place of weak magic, the pull of the darkness might be weaker too, so even if it managed to get the upper hand, she would do less harm.</p><p>The real question was, could she find it?</p><p>\u00c9L\u00c9ONORE Drayton leaned back in her rocking chair and sipped the iced tea from a tall glass shaped like the center of a daffodil. The spring sun warmed the porch. \u00c9l\u00e9onore smiled, cozy in all of the layers of her torn clothes. She had been feeling every single one of her 109 years lately, and the heat felt so nice. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Beyond the lawn, a road ran into the distance, and on the other side, the Edge woods rose, dense, nourished by magic. The air smelled of fresh leaves and spring flowers.</p><p>Next to her, Melanie Dove, herself no spring chicken, raised her glass to the light and squinted at it. The sun caught a thin gold thread spiraling inside the glass walls. \u201cNice glasses. They from the Weird?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMhhm. Keeps the tea cold with magic.\u201d The glasses worked even here, in the Edge, where the magic wasn\u2019t as strong. It didn\u2019t keep the ice from melting indefinitely as the note with it promised, but it lasted a good five to six hours, and, really, who couldn\u2019t drink a glass of tea in five hours?</p> <p>\u201cThe grandkids got it for you?\u201d</p><p>\u00c9l\u00e9onore nodded. The glasses came by a special courier, straight from Adrianglia in a box with Earl Camarine\u2019s seal on it, the latest in the stream of presents. Rose, the oldest of her grandchildren, had picked them out and written a nice note.</p><p>\u201cWhen are you going to move there?\u201d</p><p>\u00c9l\u00e9onore raised her eyebrows. \u201cTrying to get rid of me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d The other witch shook her gray head. \u201cYour granddaughter married a loaded blueblood noble, your grandsons have been after you for months to move, but you sit here like a chicken on a compost heap. In your place, I\u2019d be gone.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey have their own lives, I have mine. What am I going to do there? The boys are in school all day. George is thirteen, Jack\u2019s eleven, and Rose has her own marriage to worry about. I don\u2019t even have a place of my own there. Here I have two houses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEarl Camarine will buy you a house. He lives in a castle, woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never taken anyone\u2019s charity, and I\u2019m not about to start now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, in your place, I would go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re not in my place, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u00c9l\u00e9onore smiled into her tea. They had been friends for fifty years, and for the entire half century, Melanie had been telling anyone and everyone what they should have done with their lives. Age only made her more blunt, and she hadn\u2019t been all that subtle to begin with.</p> <p>Truth was, she missed them. Rose, George, and Jack, she missed her grandbabies so badly, her chest ached sometimes at the memories. But she didn\u2019t belong in the Weird, \u00c9l\u00e9onore reflected. She\u2019d gone to visit and would likely go again, but it didn\u2019t feel like home. The magic was stronger, and she\u2019d probably live longer, but here in the Edge, in a space between the Weird with all its magic and the Broken with none of it, was her true place. She was a Drayton and an Edger, through and through. She understood this small town; she knew all of her neighbors, their kids, and their grandkids. And she had power, too. A certain respect. When she threatened to curse someone, people stood up and listened. In the Weird, she\u2019d just be a stone around Rose\u2019s neck.</p><p>It is inevitable, she reassured herself. Children leave the nest. Everything is as it should be.</p><p>A truck rumbled past the yard, Sandra Wicks at the wheel, her bleached-blond hair a teased mess.</p><p>\u201cHussy,\u201d Melanie said under her breath.</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>Sandra waved at them through the window. Both witches smiled and waved back.</p><p>\u201cSo did you hear about her \u2018friend\u2019 near Macon?\u201d \u00c9l\u00e9onore asked.</p><p>\u201cMhm. The moment her husband leaves, she hightails it through the boundary into the Broken. It\u2019s a wonder her magic still works, as much time as she spends there. Someone ought to clue Michael in.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cStay out of it,\u201d \u00c9l\u00e9onore told her. \u201cIt\u2019s none of your business.\u201d</p><p>Melanie grimaced. \u201cWhen I was her age . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you were her age, they thought wearing a camisole instead of a corset was risqu\u00e9.\u201d</p><p>Melanie pursed her lips. \u201cI\u2019ll have you know, I wore a slip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, aren\u2019t you a rebel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was made of rayon, too.\u201d</p><p>A woman stumbled around the bend of the road. She walked unsteadily, swaying as she put one foot in front of the other, her blond hair rolled up on her head, her face smudged with dirt.</p><p>\u201cWho the hell is that?\u201d Melanie set her glass down.</p><p>Between the two of them, they knew the entire population of East Laporte, and \u00c9l\u00e9onore was dead sure she\u2019d never seen this woman before. Woolen clothes, Weird cut. Anybody from the Broken would be in jeans or khakis, shoes with heels or sneakers. She wore boots, and she was walking funny.</p><p>The woman swayed and fell down on the side of road.</p><p>\u00c9l\u00e9onore rose.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d Melanie hissed. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what she is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHalf-dead, that\u2019s what she is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a bad feeling about this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have a bad feeling about everything.\u201d</p><p>\u00c9l\u00e9onore stepped off her porch and hurried down the road.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be the death of me,\u201d Melanie muttered, and followed her. The woman slowly turned and sat up. She was tall, but thin, not naturally either. Starved, \u00c9l\u00e9onore realized. Not a teenager, a woman, around thirty or so. Still a girl by \u00c9l\u00e9onore\u2019s standards.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right, dear?\u201d \u00c9l\u00e9onore called.</p><p>The woman looked at her. Yes, definitely from the Weird and from means, too: the face was pretty and unlined, no doubt well taken care of at some point, but now haggard, sharpened by the lack of food, and stained with dirt.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been shot,\u201d she said, her voice quiet.</p><p>Mon Dieu. \u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight thigh. It\u2019s a flesh wound. Please.\u201d The woman looked at her, and \u00c9l\u00e9onore read desperation in her gray eyes. \u201cI just want some water.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u00c9l\u00e9onore, don\u2019t you dare take her into your house.\u201d</p><p>Rose was many miles away, and this girl in the dirt didn\u2019t look anything like her, but somehow there were shadows of her granddaughter in the stranger\u2019s face. \u00c9l\u00e9onore grasped the girl\u2019s hands. \u201cTry to get up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis will end in tears,\u201d Melanie grabbed the girl\u2019s other arm. \u201cCome on. Lean on me.\u201d</p><p>The woman pushed herself upright and gasped, a small, painful sound. For a tall girl, she weighed near nothing. They got her up the steps, one tiny step at a time, inside, and onto the spare bed. \u00c9l\u00e9onore pulled her woolen trousers aside. A small red bullet wound gaped in her thigh.</p><p>\u201cMelanie, get the first-aid kit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am, I am.\u201d The witch went into the kitchen</p><p>\u201cIs the bullet out?\u201d \u00c9l\u00e9onore asked.</p><p>The girl nodded.</p><p>\u201cHow did you get shot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was a boy . . .\u201d Her voice was weak. \u201cWith a broken arm. I tried to heal the break, and his father shot me.\u201d Surprise and outrage vibrated in her voice.</p><p>Healing magic was really rare, almost unheard of. \u00c9l\u00e9onore frowned. What in the world was she doing here in the Edge?</p><p>Melanie popped in the doorway with a first-aid kit. \u201cIf you can heal, why don\u2019t you fix the hole in your leg?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t heal myself,\u201d the girl told her.</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re lying,\u201d Melanie said, passing the kit over.</p><p>The girl raised her hand. Her fingers brushed Melanie\u2019s age-stained arm. A faint stream of golden sparks flared from her fingers, sinking into Melanie\u2019s skin. The dark liver spots melted.</p><p>\u00c9l\u00e9onore gasped. Melanie stood frozen.</p><p>The girl smiled, a sad, sagging curving of lips. \u201cCan I please have some water?\u201d</p><p>Her leg was still bleeding.</p><p>\u201cGet her some water, Melanie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat am I, a servant?\u201d Melanie went into the kitchen.</p><p>\u00c9l\u00e9onore unscrewed a bottle of rubbing alcohol, poured some on the gauze from the kit, and pressed it to the wound. The girl jerked.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re from the Weird, aren\u2019t you? What are you doing here in the Edge?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had to leave,\u201d the girl said. \u201cI had a horse and money. Somebody stole it. I tried to earn more, but nobody will let me heal them. I tried to help this man\u2019s child, and he shot me. He shot me! What kind of insane place is this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the Edge for you.\u201d \u00c9l\u00e9onore squeezed some Neosporin from a tube onto the wound. \u201cWe don\u2019t take kindly to outsiders.\u201d</p><p>Melanie reappeared with a cup. The girl drank in big, thirsty swallows. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho shot you?\u201d Melanie asked. \u201cWhat did he look like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTall man, red hair . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cFace like a weasel?\u201d Melanie asked.</p><p>\u201cMore like a stoat,\u201d the girl offered, her voice weak.</p><p>\u201cMarvin,\u201d \u00c9l\u00e9onore and Melanie said in one voice.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s our resident paranoid nut,\u201d \u00c9l\u00e9onore continued. \u201cThe man can\u2019t sit still in church because he\u2019s scanning the ceiling for black helicopters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s a helicopter?\u201d the girl asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a big metal contraption with a propeller on top. The police in the Broken use them to fly around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the Broken?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, boy.\u201d Melanie sighed.</p><p>\u201cThe place you came from is called the Weird,\u201d \u00c9l\u00e9onore said. \u201cYou passed through the boundary to get here, a magic barrier, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, now you\u2019re in the Edge, between the worlds. On the other side of the Edge, there is another magic barrier, and past it there is another place, just like the Weird, except that world has no magic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s called the Broken,\u201d Melanie said. \u201cIf you go there, it strips the magic off of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, it has no magic?\u201d the woman asked.</p><p>\u00c9l\u00e9onore continued working on the wound. The bullet had entered the thickness of the girl\u2019s outer thigh and exited two inches later. Barely more than a graze. Marvin couldn\u2019t hit a herd of elephants if they were coming straight at him. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCharlotte.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sleep now, Charlotte. Don\u2019t worry. You\u2019re safe. You can stay here until you feel better. Nobody will shoot you here, and we\u2019ll have plenty of times to talk about the Broken and helicopters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Charlotte whispered.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome, dear.\u201d</p><p>The girl closed her eyes. Her breathing evened out. \u00c9l\u00e9onore finished dressing the wound.</p><p>\u201cFound yourself another bird with a broken wing,\u201d Melanie said. \u201cAnd you wonder where George gets it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook at her. How can I turn her away?\u201d</p><p>Her friend shook her head. \u201cOh, \u00c9l\u00e9onore. I hope you know what you\u2019re doing.\u201d</p> <p>IT was the evening of the next day. \u00c9l\u00e9onore sat on the porch of her house, drinking iced tea from the Weird glass and watching the Edge swallows glide back and forth, snacking on mosquitoes.</p><p>The screen door swung open behind her. Charlotte stepped out onto the porch, wrapped in the blanket. Her hair was a mess, and her face was still pale, but her eyes were clear.</p><p>\u201cFeeling better?\u201d \u00c9l\u00e9onore asked.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome sit by me.\u201d</p><p>The girl lowered herself in the chair carefully. That wound must\u2019ve still hurt.</p> <p>\u201cHow\u2019s that leg?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just a graze,\u201d the girl said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I went all to pieces. It was shock and dehydration more than anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d \u00c9l\u00e9onore pushed the platter of cookies toward her. \u201cYou look like it\u2019s been a while since you ate.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte took a cookie. \u201cThank you for helping me. I don\u2019t know how to repay you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t mention it,\u201d \u00c9l\u00e9onore said. \u201cWhere are you from? In the Weird, I mean. What country?\u201d</p><p>Charlotte paused for a second. \u201cAdrianglia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy granddaughter married a man from Adrianglia,\u201d \u00c9l\u00e9onore told her. \u201cEarl Camarine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Marshall of the Southern Provinces,\u201d Charlotte said.</p> <p>Maybe she knew Rose. \u201cExactly. Do you know him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never met him,\u201d Charlotte said. \u201cI do know the family by reputation.\u201d</p><p>She looked at the woods. Exhaustion showed on her face in a weary, slack mouth and dark circles under the sad eyes. There was clearly a \u201cpast\u201d there, \u00c9l\u00e9onore reflected. The girl didn\u2019t seem like an escaped criminal. More like she was a victim, running from something, alone but determined. She\u2019d seen that precise look on her granddaughter\u2019s face when Rose ran out of money or the boys came up with some unexpected emergency. It was a \u201cLife kicked me again, but I\u2019ll make it work\u201d look.</p><p>\u201cSo where are you headed?\u201d \u00c9l\u00e9onore asked.</p><p>\u201cNowhere in particular,\u201d Charlotte said.</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re in no shape to go anywhere.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte opened her mouth.</p><p>\u201cNo shape,\u201d \u00c9l\u00e9onore said. \u201cMy granddaughter left a house behind. I meant to rent it out but never found anyone trustworthy enough not to destroy the place. It\u2019s full of cobwebs now, but if you\u2019re not scared of soapy water and a broom, you should be able to put it back together. You can stay there for a while. And if you want to practice healing, we can do that, too. You just need a proper introduction to people. Things are done a certain way here.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte was looking at her, her eyes wide, looking stunned. \u201cWhy? You don\u2019t even know me. I could be a criminal.\u201d</p><p>\u00c9l\u00e9onore sipped her tea. \u201cWhen Earl Camarine first showed up in the Edge, I wasn\u2019t happy with his arrival. My granddaughter is special, Charlotte. All grandmothers think their grandchildren are special, but Rose truly is. She is kind, smart, and determined. She practiced for years and taught herself to flash white, just like the best of the bluebloods. And she is beautiful. Her mother died, and her father . . .\u201d</p><p>\u00c9l\u00e9onore grimaced.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t make good choices during my life. I didn\u2019t marry wisely, and I\u2019ve managed to raise a son who ran out on his own children. John left Rose and her two brothers without a dollar to their name. At eighteen, Rose was a mother to two toddlers. She was stuck here in the Edge, working a dreadful job in the Broken and trying to raise her brothers. I wanted so many wonderful things for her, and instead I watched her wither slowly, and there wasn\u2019t a thing I could do about it. And then Declan Camarine came, and he promised her everything: that he would love her, and care for her, and take care of George and Jack. I warned her it was too good to be true, but she went with him anyway. Turned out that I was wrong. She lives like a princess now. Her husband loves her. They are talking about children, when the boys get older.\u201d</p><p>A brief flash of pain reflected on Charlotte\u2019s face. So that was it. She was running from a broken marriage or a dead child. You poor girl.</p><p>\u00c9l\u00e9onore smiled. \u201cMy granddaughter is happy, Charlotte. She has everything I ever wanted for her. When she first left, I worried about her fitting in with the bluebloods, but her mother-in-law stepped right in and took her under her wing. I\u2019m no duchess, but now I have an opportunity to do the same. I want to pay Providence back for the blessings of our family. We Draytons are many things: pirates, witches, rogues . . . but nobody ever accused us of being ungrateful. A family has to have standards. Even in the Edge. You\u2019re welcome to stay as long as you need.\u201d</p><p>ONE</p><p>THREE YEARS LATER</p><p>RICHARD Mar ran through the woods. The wound in his side wept dark blood, almost black. A bad sign. His liver was likely lacerated. Congratulations, he told himself. You\u2019ve finally managed to get yourself killed and by an amateur, no less. Your family would be so proud if they knew.</p><p>In his defense, it hadn\u2019t occurred to him that a man would conceive, conspire, and execute a plan that involved having his own sister raped by a scumbag just to lay a trap for him. Despite everything Richard had seen, that depth of human depravity had eluded him thus far. He\u2019d thanked Jackal Tuline for correcting that oversight by separating his head from his body. Unfortunately Tuline had six accomplices, and while overall they demonstrated a remarkable lack of proper training, one of them had managed to run him through.</p><p>Tree trunks flashed by him, the huge Adrianglian pines straight like masts. His breath came in ragged, painful gasps. Hot pain chewed on his side, biting at the wound with every step.</p><p>A distant howl rolled through the forest. The slavers had hounds, and he was leaving a bloody trail. He was in quite a jam, and he saw no way out of it.</p><p>The trees swayed around him, turning fuzzy, then coming back into focus. His vision was failing. Richard shook himself and pushed forward. He had to get to the boundary. Beyond the boundary lay the Edge. With the Weird\u2019s woods stretching for many miles in every direction, the Edge was his only chance. Not that the Edgers would help him out of the goodness of their hearts. He had been born in the Edge and knew better than most that in the space between the worlds, it was every man for himself. But the Edgers, a paranoid and suspicious lot, owned guns and had itchy trigger fingers. They would see a group of armed slavers ride through their land and shoot at them as a matter of principle.</p><p>Dizziness seized him, tossing him against a tree trunk. Richard grabbed the fragrant bark to steady himself, his fingers sticking to the sap, and willed the trees to stop spinning. Come on, get a grip. This is no way to die. At least he could go out in a flash of glory instead of bleeding out under some pine.</p><p>The forest melted into a gray, rain-drenched swamp. Richard smelled the pungent aroma of the Mire\u2019s herbs mixing with the stench of stagnant water. He\u2019d know this scent anywhere\u2014he\u2019d grown up cloaked in it. He ran across the sluice of muddy soil to the clearing buttressed by the cypresses. Wide holes gaped in the ground like dark mouths. He checked the first one and saw the body of a child, a pale, thin form, floating facedown in two feet of brown water . . .</p><p>Richard shook his head, flinging the memory away. The woods reappeared. He was hallucinating. Splendid. He pushed from the trunk and kept moving.</p><p>In the distance, another dog howl rolled, more to the west. They must\u2019ve broken into two groups. They were a cowardly lot, but they had a lot of practice chasing runaway slaves and were distressingly good at it.</p><p>The brush ended abruptly. He saw the ravine, but too late. The carpet of needles shifted under his feet, the edge of the hill collapsed, and Richard rolled down the slope and crashed into a tree. His ribs crunched, and the pain clawed at his side.</p><p>The swamp mud squelched under his feet. A man rushed him, weaving between the holes, sword in hand, mouth gaping wide in a scream, his wet hair plastered to his skull by the rain. Richard slashed. The body fell apart before him. Another slaver charged from the left. A second sweep of Richard\u2019s sword, and the slaver\u2019s head rolled off his shoulders and tumbled into the nearest hole. Red blood gushed from the stump of the neck and splashed onto the sludge . . .</p><p>Reality slammed into Richard in a rush of agony. He gritted his teeth, rolled to all fours, clumsy like a baby learning how to walk, and forced himself upright. A familiar dull pressure pushed at his skin and insides. He took a step forward, and the wall of magic ground against his senses. The boundary. He couldn\u2019t see it or smell it, but it pushed on him, as if an invisible hand pressed against his insides. He\u2019d reached the Edge. Finally.</p><p>A big furry body sailed over the edge of the ravine. Richard spun about, unsheathing his sword. The sun caught the long, slender blade. The wolfripper dog landed on the slope and sprinted forward, 170 pounds of muscle sheathed in short, dense black fur. Richard leaned forward, closing his left hand on the small ultrasonic emitter in the sword\u2019s pommel. A gift from his brother. Kaldar had bought or probably stolen the gadget on one of his excursions to the Broken, and it worked in the Weird. The slavers\u2019 dogs hated it, and Richard used it often. He\u2019d never been much for killing dogs. They only did what their masters told them to do. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Three people cleared the top of the ravine. Two men, one thin to the point of being scrawny, the other wearing leathers and holding a dog leash, and a woman, tall, muscular, and with hard eyes. The slaver scouts. Hello there.</p><p>The dog was almost to him, running fast on massive paws, rugged, big-boned, bred to kill a pack of wolves and get home in one piece. Fifty feet. Thirty.</p><p>Richard squeezed the emitter. The sound, too high for human ears, lanced at the dog\u2019s sensitive eardrums.</p> <p>The beast halted.</p><p>\u201cGet \u2019im!\u201d the slaver with the leash yelled. \u201cGet! Get!\u201d</p><p>The wolfripper bared big teeth.</p><p>Richard squeezed the emitter again, holding the switch for a few painful seconds.</p><p>The dog whined and trotted over to the side, circling behind him.</p> <p>The scrawny slaver on the right of the dog handler swore and pulled a gun from his waistband. Slavers were opportunistic thugs\u2014most of them had barely enough magic to be born in the Weird or the Edge but not enough to succeed at life. They evened the odds with cruelty and Broken contraband weapons, counting on the element of surprise.</p><p>The slaver pointed the gun at Richard. He was young, blond, and the way he held the weapon, sideways, made Richard\u2019s head hurt.</p><p>\u201cWe need him alive, you moron,\u201d the dog handler said.</p><p>\u201cDude, fuck that.\u201d The black barrel stared in Richard\u2019s face. \u201cI\u2019ll take him out right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he an apprentice?\u201d Richard asked, bracing himself.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d The woman stared at him.</p> <p>\u201cIs he a scumbag in training?\u201d Richard glanced at the gunman. \u201cAt least have the decency to hold the gun properly, you fool. If you don\u2019t know how, pass it to someone who does. I\u2019m not going to suffer being shot at by anything less than a full-fledged lowlife.\u201d</p><p>The shooter sputtered. \u201cScrew you.\u201d</p><p>The gun barked, the sound booming through the woods.</p><p>Richard flashed, panning his magic in a defensive screen. Translucent white magic pulsed, forming a half sphere in front of him for a second, just long enough to knock the bullet aside. Even at full health, he couldn\u2019t maintain the shield for longer than a moment, but with the right timing, it was enough. He used to flash blue, but being in the Weird had improved his magical strength.</p><p>The slaver spat another curse and fired, squeezing the trigger in a rapid rhythm. Boom, boom, boom.</p><p>Richard flashed, matching the cadence of shots a moment before they rang out. The white screen pulsed, deflecting the projectiles.</p><p>Boom, boom, boom.</p><p>A sharp yelp cut through the shots. The gun clicked. The man was out of ammunition.</p> <p>Richard turned. The dog had fallen. The idiot had shot their own dog. That\u2019s what happened when the destructive potential of a man\u2019s weapons exceeded his intelligence.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell did you do that for?\u201d The dog handler stared at the dog panting in pain on the grass. \u201cYou\u2019re taking the heat for this one. There\u2019s no way the fine\u2019s coming out of my pocket.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn it.\u201d The gunman shoved the gun back into his belt.</p><p>\u201cCould\u2019ve told you that,\u201d the woman said. She was the tallest of the three and had the rawboned build of an experienced fighter. \u201cBullets aren\u2019t going to hurt a blueblood.\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t a blueblood. Far from it. Richard pondered the three slavers. \u201cSo far you\u2019ve shot your own dog and wasted twelve bullets. Any other attempts to dazzle me with your superior fighting skills?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have to go down there and get him,\u201d the woman said.</p><p>The two slavers looked at him. Neither moved.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d the dog handler said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a bad idea,\u201d the thug with the gun added.</p><p>\u201cOh, you whiny bitches.\u201d The woman shook her head. \u201cLook at him, he\u2019s fifteen years older than you and barely standing. He\u2019ll probably bleed out before I get down there.\u201d</p><p>Richard let himself sway. It wasn\u2019t exactly difficult in his current condition. He needed all three of them within striking distance because the trees were threatening to melt again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going down there,\u201d the woman said. \u201cAnd just so you know, whatever bonus I get, I\u2019m not sharing.\u201d</p><p>She started down the slope. The thug with the gun spat to the side and followed her. The dog handler looked at Richard for a long moment and descended after them.</p><p>The woman pulled a lean, long sword from her sheath. The dog handler brandished an axe with a short handle. The third slaver pulled out a baton.</p><p>Richard fought to stay upright. A drop of blood dripped down from the saturated fabric of his doublet and fell onto the pine needles. Another . . .</p><p>The woman struck. She was tall and fast, with sure footing and a good reach. In the split second between reading the intent in her eyes and her body processing it, Richard released his magic. It stretched in a thin lethal line over his blade, coating its edge. He stepped forward, avoiding her lunge, and cut in a savage overhand stroke across her arm. The flash-coated sword sliced through human sinew and bone like sharp scissors through tissue paper. The severed limb fell to the ground.</p><p>Before she managed to produce a scream, Richard buried his blade in the chest of the dog handler, piercing the heart, freed it with a tug, turned, and struck backward, sliding his blade along his side into the third slaver\u2019s groin.</p><p>The woman finally screamed. He beheaded her with one sharp stroke, spun, and finished the scrawny slaver with a single vicious cut to the throat.</p><p>Three bodies fell to the ground.</p><p>Richard\u2019s head swam. His legs gave out. He dropped to one knee, thrusting the sword into the ground and holding on to it like a crutch. What should\u2019ve taken three cuts had required five. \u201cSimply embarrassing,\u201d he whispered. Two red drops splashed onto the green leaves\u2014his blood. The brush around him was stained with it\u2014some of it his, some of it from the slavers.</p><p>The dog whined next to him. Richard focused and saw two brown eyes looking at him with a silent canine plea.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, boy. I can\u2019t help you.\u201d</p><p>Richard forced himself up and staggered forward, to the boundary.</p><p>The magic enveloped him, crushing, squeezing, as if the air itself had grown heavy and viscous. His body screamed in protest, feeling a part of its magic being stripped away. The Edge was his limit. He\u2019d tried to enter the Broken once and nearly died. The very magic that made him good with his sword kept him anchored. It felt like he was dying now, but he would survive. He just had to keep going. One foot in front of the other.</p><p>A step.</p><p>Another step.</p><p>The magic licked his skin with a serrated tongue, and the pressure vanished. He was through.</p><p>The forest swayed around him, the trees sliding to the side. Richard stumbled forward. Cold slid along his skin. His leg muscles trembled, struggling to support his weight. Cotton clogged his ears, followed by a deep, overpowering nausea. He crashed, half-blind, through the brush.</p><p>The swamp clearing stretched before him. The slavers lay dead, delivered by his blade to the afterlife. He dashed from hole to hole. Dead children looked back at him with opaque eyes.</p><p>\u201cSophie! Sophie!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere!\u201d His niece\u2019s voice sounded so weak.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you?\u201d Holes filled with children slumped in the muddy water. He checked each one, sprinting back and forth in panic. A corpse. Another corpse. She was here, somewhere. He had to find her.</p><p>The world turned black. He ripped through the darkness by sheer will and saw the edge of a dirt road running through the woods, little more than two tire tracks with a strip of grass growing between them. He wasn\u2019t sure if it was real or a remnant of some memory.</p><p>The blackness smothered him.</p><p>Richard clenched his teeth and crawled toward the road. This was not the end. He wouldn\u2019t be dying now. He had things to do.</p><p>The rain-drenched clearing with its cypresses swam into his view.</p><p>\u201cHelp me!\u201d Sophie called.</p><p>He stumbled over the bodies of slavers, tracking her voice.</p><p>\u201cHelp me!\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m trying, he wanted to tell her. I\u2019m trying, sweetheart. Hold on. Wait for me.</p><p>The darkness stomped on the back of his head. The world vanished.</p><p>CHARLOTTE surveyed the groceries laid out on the island of her kitchen. Almost done. Only the big log of ground beef was left. She sliced it with a knife into five equal portions\u2014each one would be enough for a dinner for one with leftovers for lunch\u2014and began wrapping them in plastic.</p><p>The first time she\u2019d hired an Edger to bring her groceries from the Broken, the woman had delivered a big pack of ground beef. Charlotte had frozen the whole thing as it was, in the wrapper. Unfortunately, it turned out that once you defrosted the beef in the microwave, it wasn\u2019t safe to refreeze it again. She ended up throwing half of the meat out. Lesson learned.</p><p>Cooking was just one of the things she had to learn in the Edge. At Ganer College, staff prepared her meals, and at her estate, she had employed a cook. Charlotte sighed at the memory. She\u2019d never truly appreciated Colin until she had to fend for herself in the kitchen. \u00c9l\u00e9onore had given her a cookbook, and if Charlotte followed the recipes exactly, the result was passable, occasionally even tasty. Decades spent learning to mix medicines ensured that she had good technique and paid attention, but if she didn\u2019t have the exact ingredients on hand, trying to substitute things ended in complete disaster. A few weeks ago she watched \u00c9l\u00e9onore make banana bread. It was all \u201ca handful of flour\u201d and \u201ca dash of cinnamon\u201d and \u201cadd mashed bananas until it looks right.\u201d Charlotte had dutifully written everything down, and when she\u2019d tried to re-create the recipe, she ended up with a salty loaf-shaped rock.</p><p>She\u2019d learned other lessons as well. Being humble. Living a simpler life. The dark magic inside her had long fallen dormant, and that was just the way she liked it.</p><p>Bright sunlight spilled through the open window, drawing warm rectangles on the kitchen floor. The day was beautiful. The air smelled of spring and honeysuckle. When she finished, she would go outside and read on her porch swing. And have a nice glass of iced tea. Mmm, tea would hit the spot. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCharlotte? Are you in there?\u201d A familiar voice called from the front porch. \u00c9l\u00e9onore.</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d Charlotte smiled, wrapping the last chunk of ground beef in plastic.</p><p>\u00c9l\u00e9onore swept into the kitchen. She looked to be around sixty, but she\u2019d let it slip last year that a 112th birthday wasn\u2019t such a bad thing for a woman to endure. Her clothes were an artful mess of tattered and shredded layers, all perfectly clean and smelling faintly of lavender. Her hair was teased into a fluffy gray mess and liberally decorated with charms, twigs, and dry herbs. In the middle of her hair nest sat a small cuckoo clock.</p> <p>\u00c9l\u00e9onore worried her. In the three years Charlotte had known her, the older woman\u2019s physical condition had steadily slid downhill. Her bones were getting thinner, and she was losing muscle. She\u2019d slipped on an iced-over path four months ago and broken her hip. Charlotte healed it, but her talent had its limits. She could only heal up to the existing potential of the body. In children, that potential was high, and she could even regenerate severed digits. But \u00c9l\u00e9onore\u2019s body was tired. Her bones were brittle, and coaxing them into regrowth proved difficult.</p><p>Old age was the one disease for which there was no cure. In the Edge, as in the Weird, people fueled their life spans with magic, but eventually even magic gave out.</p><p>The cuckoo clock sagged.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s about to fall,\u201d Charlotte said.</p><p>\u00c9l\u00e9onore sighed and pulled the clock out of her hair. \u201cIt just doesn\u2019t want to stay in there, does it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHave you tried pins?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve tried everything.\u201d \u00c9l\u00e9onore surveyed the island filled with meat and vegetables, all in perfectly sized portions, wrapped in plastic or placed into the Ziploc bags. \u201cYou obsess, my dear.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte laughed. \u201cI like having an organized freezer.\u201d</p><p>\u00c9l\u00e9onore opened the freezer and blinked.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Charlotte leaned back, trying to figure out what the hedge witch was looking at. Her freezer wasn\u2019t really gapeworthy. It had four wire shelves, each with a neat label written in permanent marker on a piece of white tape: beef, pork and chicken, seafood, and vegetables.</p><p>\u00c9l\u00e9onore tapped the nearest label with her finger. \u201cThere is no hope for you.\u201d She sank and landed on a stool. \u201cCharlotte, do you ever make a mess just for the fun of it?\u201d</p> <p>Charlotte shook her head, hiding a smile. \u201cI like structure. It keeps me grounded.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you were any more grounded, you\u2019d sprout roots.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte laughed. It was true.</p><p>\u201cYou and Rose would get along,\u201d \u00c9l\u00e9onore said. \u201cShe was the same way. Everything had to be just so.\u201d</p><p>Rose was a constant presence in most of their conversations. Charlotte hid a smile. Being a substitute Rose didn\u2019t bother her at all. She long ago realized that for \u00c9l\u00e9onore there was no higher praise, and she took it as a compliment.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve come for a favor,\u201d \u00c9l\u00e9onore announced. \u201cBecause I\u2019m selfish that way.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte raised her eyebrows. \u201cWhat may I do for you, your witchiness?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow are you with handling teenage acne?\u201d \u00c9l\u00e9onore asked.</p> <p>\u201cAcne is a side effect of the body\u2019s normal processes.\u201d Charlotte began stacking her bags into the freezer in neat little towers. \u201cI can treat it, and it will disappear for a while, but eventually it will come back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long is a while?\u201d</p><p>Charlotte skewed her mouth. \u201cSix to eight weeks, give or take.\u201d</p><p>\u00c9l\u00e9onore raised her hand. \u201cSold. A friend of mine, Sunny Rooney, has two granddaughters. Nice girls. Daisy is twenty-three and Tulip is sixteen. The parents have been out of the picture for a while\u2014their mother died a while back, and their dad passed away six months ago. Daisy has a decent job in the Broken, so Tulip lives with her. She\u2019ll be starting a new school in the Broken this fall, except her face is all messed up, and Daisy says it\u2019s causing her a lot of stress. They tried creams and washes, but it won\u2019t go away. They\u2019re in the front yard now, hoping you might take a look. I\u2019ll take care of their bill. I know you just worked on Glen\u2019s stomach problems two days ago, and I do hate to ask, but you\u2019re their last hope.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d heard that one before. Charlotte sat the last bag into the freezer, washed her hands, and wiped them on the towel. \u201cLet\u2019s see what we have.\u201d</p><p>THE two girls stood at the edge of the lawn. Short and about sixty pounds overweight, Daisy had a round face, big brown eyes, and a nervous smile. Tulip was her polar opposite. Thin almost to the point of being underdeveloped for her age, she stood half-hiding behind her sister. Her skinny jeans sagged on her. Her tank top, designed to be formfitting, shifted with the wind. She had caked makeup on her face, and the thick pale paste made her skin appear bloodless. If not for the same chocolate hair and big eyes, Charlotte would\u2019ve never guessed they were related.</p><p>Neither of the young women made any effort to approach. A ring of small plain stones, each sitting a few feet apart from each other, circled the house, and both Daisy and Tulip kept well away from it. The stones didn\u2019t affect \u00c9l\u00e9onore\u2014she had put them there in the first place.</p><p>\u201cYou left them outside of the ward stones?\u201d Charlotte murmured.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s your house,\u201d \u00c9l\u00e9onore murmured back.</p><p>Charlotte walked down the path and picked up the nearest stone. Magic nipped at her. A small rock the size of her fist, the ward stone was rooted to the ground. Together, the stones formed a magic barrier that guarded the house better than any fence. The Edge wasn\u2019t the safest of places. The Weird had sheriffs, the Broken had cops, but in the Edge, wards and guns were people\u2019s only defense.</p><p>\u201cCome on in,\u201d Charlotte invited.</p><p>The women hurried to the house, and she dropped the rock back in its place.</p><p>\u201cHi!\u201d Daisy offered her a hand, and Charlotte shook it. \u201cIt\u2019s so nice to meet you. Say hi, Tulip.\u201d</p><p>Tulip promptly hid behind her sister.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Charlotte told her. \u201cI need you to wash your face. The bathroom is straight through there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome, I\u2019ll take you,\u201d \u00c9l\u00e9onore offered.</p><p>She smiled, and Tulip followed her up the porch steps and right into the house.</p><p>\u201cThank you so much for seeing us,\u201d Daisy said.</p><p>\u201cNo problem,\u201d Charlotte said.</p><p>\u201cGod, this is awkward. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d Daisy shifted from foot to foot. \u201cIt\u2019s just that we tried all the creams and prescriptions, and they\u2019re saying laser treatment is the only option. I\u2019m a CPA. I make okay money but not that kind of money, you know?\u201d She laughed nervously.</p><p>And that\u2019s what always got her, Charlotte reflected. That uncomfortable pleading look in the eyes. People looked at you like you were the answer to all their prayers. She wanted to help\u2014she always wanted to help\u2014but there were limits to what magic could do.</p><p>Daisy offered an awkward smile. \u201cMrs. Drayton said you might be tired. Thank you for seeing us anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a problem.\u201d Charlotte smiled. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we go into the kitchen?\u201d</p><p>In the kitchen, they sat at the island, and she poured two glasses of iced tea. Daisy perched on the edge of her chair, looking like she wanted to bolt.</p><p>\u201cThis used to be Rose\u2019s house,\u201d Daisy said. \u201cMy best friend\u2019s sister went to high school with her. I saw her flash at the Graduation Fair. It was crazy. Pure white. Nobody from the Edge ever flashes white. Do you flash?\u201d</p><p>In the Edge, most people had a magic talent. Some were useful, some not, but every magic user could flash with practice and proper training. Flash was a pure stream of magic. It looked like a ribbon of light, or sometimes, a whip of lightning. The brighter and paler the flash, the stronger the magic. The strongest flash, pure white, could cut through a body like a cleaver through a stick of warm butter. It was a lethal weapon, and Charlotte had seen the wounds it left, in great detail.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t flash,\u201d Charlotte said. She\u2019d never learned to do it because there was no need. \u201cThat\u2019s not my talent.\u201d</p><p>Daisy sighed. \u201cOf course. I\u2019m sorry. I shouldn\u2019t have mentioned Rose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind at all,\u201d Charlotte said. \u201c\u00c9l\u00e9onore talks about her and the boys all the time.\u201d</p><p>Daisy fidgeted in her seat. \u201cSo how do you know Mrs. Drayton? You\u2019re friends, I take it?\u201d</p><p>\u00c9l\u00e9onore was more than a friend. The older woman was her chosen family. \u201cWhen I first came to the Edge, I came out more to the west, near Ricket. I\u2019d walked away from my horse for a minute to relieve myself, and someone stole it and all of my money. \u201c</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the Edge for you.\u201d Daisy sighed.</p><p>\u201cThe plan was to find work, but nobody would let me heal them. I walked from settlement to settlement, trying to find a place to fit in, and when I came to East Laporte, I was starving. No money, no place to stay, my clothes were torn up and filthy. I was at the end of my rope. \u00c9l\u00e9onore found me on the side of the road and took me in. She made me welcome and got me my first clients. She\u2019d go with me to all of my appointments and chat people up while I worked. I owe her everything.\u201d</p><p>There was more to it than simple gratitude. \u00c9l\u00e9onore missed her grandchildren terribly. The older woman had such a strong urge, almost a need, to take care of someone, Charlotte reflected, just as she herself felt the same urge to cure an illness or fix a broken limb. They were kindred spirits.</p><p>\u00c9l\u00e9onore emerged from the bathroom, leading Tulip by the hand. The girl\u2019s face was a sea of hard red bumps buried under the skin. Cystic acne. The precursors to scarring were already there.</p><p>\u201cSit,\u201d Charlotte invited.</p><p>Tulip obediently sat on the stool. \u00c9l\u00e9onore put a small mirror on the island. \u201cJust in case.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLook at your sister for me, okay?\u201d Charlotte slid her fingertips over the hard bumps on Tulip\u2019s left cheek. Magic coated her hand, a steady stream of glowing golden sparks.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s pretty,\u201d Tulip whispered.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWill it hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it won\u2019t hurt at all. Now look straight ahead for me. Just like that.\u201d</p><p>The sparks penetrated the skin, finding the tiny infected hair follicles. The magic pulled on Charlotte. It was a curious feeling, as if some of her vitality were being sucked away, converted into the healing current. Not painful, but alarming and uncomfortable unless you were used to it. Charlotte closed her eyes. For a moment all she saw was darkness, then her magic made the connection and the cross section of Tulip\u2019s skin appeared before her. She saw the pores, the hair shafts, the ruptured follicle walls spilling infected fluids into the dermis, contaminating the nearby follicles, and the severely inflamed sebaceous glands.</p><p>Charlotte pushed slightly, testing the flesh. Her magic saturated the tissues of the cheek completely. She opened her eyes. The inner workings of Tulip\u2019s face remained before her, almost as if she were looking through two different sets of eyes at the same time, choosing what she wanted to focus on next.</p><p>Charlotte numbed the nerve endings reaching into Tulip\u2019s skin. \u201cLook straight ahead for me.\u201d</p> <p>The flesh of Tulip\u2019s check contracted. The pus spilled out of a dozen tiny lesions.</p><p>Tulip blinked, surprised. \u201cIt didn\u2019t hurt.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte tore open an alcohol wipe, plucked it out, and swiped it across the cheek. \u201cSee? I told you.\u201d</p><p>She concentrated on restoring the injured tissue, purging the infection. The bumps on Tulip\u2019s face shivered and began to melt, dissolving into healthy, pink skin.</p><p>Daisy gasped.</p><p>The last of the acne vanished. Charlotte let the current of her magic die, picked up the mirror, and held it up to Tulip.</p> <p>\u201cOh my God!\u201d The girl touched her clear left cheek. \u201cOh my God, it\u2019s gone!\u201d</p><p>This was why she did it, Charlotte reflected, brushing Tulip\u2019s hair from her face. The spontaneous simple relief when the disease was gone. It made everything worth it.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not gone forever,\u201d Charlotte warned. \u201cIt will probably be back in six to eight weeks. Let\u2019s do the right cheek now. We don\u2019t want you to be lopsided\u2014\u201d</p><p>A vehicle screeched to a stop in front of the house.</p><p>\u201cWho in the world could that be?\u201d \u00c9l\u00e9onore rose of her chair.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s see.\u201d Charlotte strode to the screen door and out onto the porch.</p><p>At the edge of the lawn, Kenny Jo Ogletree jumped out of a beat-up Chevy truck. Sixteen, broad-shouldered but still lanky, Kenny had been one of her first patients. He\u2019d climbed a pine to chainsaw a branch off so it wouldn\u2019t crash on his mother\u2019s house, and fell. Two broken legs and bruised ribs from the chain saw\u2019s dropping on top of him. Could\u2019ve been worse.</p><p>Kenny\u2019s face was pale. She looked into his eyes and saw fear.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Charlotte called out.</p><p>He ran to the truck back and dropped the tailgate. \u201cI found him on the side of Corker\u2019s road.\u201d</p><p>A man lay in the truck bed. His skin was alabaster white against the dark leather of his clothes. Blood pooled around him in a viscous puddle.</p><p>Charlotte dashed down the path, past the ward stone, and into the truck. Her magic swirled from her hands, into the body, and back into her hands. The interior of the body flashed before her. Anterior abdominal stab wound, laceration to the right hepatic lobe, severe loss of blood, hemorrhagic shock. He was dying.</p><p>Charlotte leaned over the body, pouring her magic out. It wound about her, binding her and the dying man in a glowing whirlwind of sparks. Her reserves began to drain, as if the magic funneled her very life force out. She directed the current deep into the liver. It flowed through the portal vein branching like a red coral inside the fragile organ tissues. The golden sparks lit the blood vessels from within. She began regenerating the walls, sinking bursts of magic into the liver lobe to mend the damage.</p><p>His temperature and blood pressure dropped again.</p><p>She pushed more magic into the injured tissues, trying to pull the body out of shock. It fought her, but she anchored it to life with her magic and refused to let go. He would stay with her. He wasn\u2019t going anywhere. Death wanted him, but Charlotte had claimed him, and he was hers. She couldn\u2019t create new life, but she could fight for the existing one with everything she had. Death would just have to do without.</p><p>His heart fluttered like an injured bird. He was in danger of cardiac arrest. She wrapped her magic around his heart, cradling it with one loop of the current while feverishly mending the tears in his flesh with the other. Each heartbeat resonated through her.</p><p>Pulse.</p><p>Stay with me.</p><p>Pulse.</p><p>Stay with me, stranger.</p><p>The lesions in the liver closed. The blood pressure stabilized. Finally. Charlotte knitted together the injured muscle and accelerated blood production.</p><p>I have you. You won\u2019t die today.</p><p>The man\u2019s breathing steadied. She encouraged circulation and held him, watching the internal temperature creep up. She was burning through what meager fat reserves he had to generate blood cells. There wasn\u2019t much\u2014he was practically all muscle and skin.</p><p>The internal temperature approached normal levels. The heart pulsed, strong and steady.</p><p>She held on to him for a little while longer just to make sure he was past the danger point. He had a powerful, healthy body. He would recover.</p><p>Charlotte disengaged, slowly, a little at a time, and sat back. Her head swam. Blood stained her hands. Her nose itched, and she rubbed the back of her wrist against it, dazed and disconnected from reality.</p><p>The man lay next to her, his pulse even. She gulped the air. She was out of breath as if she had run some sort of crazy sprint. The familiar post-healing fatigue anchored her in place. Her muscles ached. The weariness would let go in a minute. During her time at the College, a difficult emergency healing like this was usually followed by a daylong bed rest for the healer, but she was no longer healing someone every day. She wasn\u2019t near her limit.</p><p>She\u2019d beaten Death again. The relief flooded her. That\u2019s one life that didn\u2019t have to end. One man who would survive to see his family. She had made it happen, and seeing his chest rise in an even rhythm made her deeply happy.</p><p>His hair was very dark, a glossy, almost bluish black. It fanned around his head, framing his face. He was no longer pale. He probably never was as pale as she perceived. Years of practice attuned her senses to react to specific signs of distress in her patients, and sometimes her magic distorted her vision to produce the diagnosis faster. The man\u2019s skin had a pronounced bronze tint, both from a naturally darker tone and sun exposure. His face was precisely sculpted, with a square jaw, a strong chin, and a nose that must\u2019ve been perfectly shaped at some point but now was too wide at the bridge, the result of an old injury, most likely. Short, dark stubble dusted his jawline. His mouth was neither too wide nor too narrow, his lips soft, his forehead high. His body was in superb shape, but the gathering of faint laugh lines at the corners of his eyes betrayed his age. He was at least as old as she, probably a few years older, mid to late thirties. His skin and clothes were stained with mud and blood, his hair was a mess, and yet there was something undeniably elegant about him.</p><p>What a handsome man.</p><p>The man\u2019s eyelashes trembled. Charlotte leaned over, alarm pulsing through her. Her magic sparked. He should\u2019ve been out. His body needed every resource to heal.</p><p>The man opened his eyes. He looked at her, their faces mere inches apart. His eyes were dark and intelligent, and that intelligence changed his entire face, catapulting him from handsome to irresistible. \u201cSophie,\u201d he said.</p><p>He was delirious. \u201cIt\u2019s over now,\u201d she told him. \u201cRest.\u201d</p><p>His eyes focused on her. \u201cBeautiful,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>She blinked.</p><p>\u201cI know that voice.\u201d \u00c9l\u00e9onore climbed into the truck. \u201cRichard! Mon dieu, que s\u2019est-il pass\u00e9?\u201d</p><p>Richard tried to rise. His pulse sped up to dangerous levels.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Charlotte struggled to hold him down. He strained under her. He was strong like a horse. Her magic still spiraled around him, wrapping him in a cocoon of sparks, straining to heal the damage as he moved. Without knowing it, he was leaning on her healing power like a crutch. \u201cI have to put him under. He can\u2019t move, or he\u2019ll rip everything open.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho did this to you?\u201d \u00c9l\u00e9onore asked. \u201cRichard?\u201d</p><p>Richard pushed against Charlotte, lifting her deadweight. She felt the newly mended tissue tearing. His hold on her magic faltered. She felt him slip.</p><p>Richard\u2019s eyes closed, and he crashed back into the truck bed. Charlotte leaned over him. Out cold.</p><p>\u00c9l\u00e9onore turned to the boy. \u201cKenny, help us get him into the house.\u201d</p><p>Kenny grunted. Magic snapped, accreting around him. He reached over, picked Richard up like a toddler, and carried him inside. Charlotte dropped the ward stone back in place, and the four of them followed him.</p><p>\u201cWhere to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuest bedroom on the right.\u201d Charlotte pushed the door open.</p><p>Kenny deposited Richard on the spare bed and turned around. \u201cI\u2019ve got to get to mom\u2019s house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, sweetheart.\u201d \u00c9l\u00e9onore said. \u201cSay hello to your mother for me.\u201d</p><p>Kenny nodded and went out.</p><p>Charlotte knelt by the bed. Richard\u2019s pulse was still even. Good. \u201cHow do you know him?\u201d</p><p>\u00c9l\u00e9onore sighed. \u201cI\u2019ve met him before. His first cousin married my grandson-in-law\u2019s adopted cousin. We\u2019re family.\u201d</p><p>Family, right. \u201cIs he a blueblood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. He lives in the Weird now, but he\u2019s an Edger like us, from the Mire. When I first saw him, I thought the same thing\u2014some sort of noble house. But no, he\u2019s an Edger.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWho is Sophie?\u201d A wife? Perhaps, a sister?</p><p>\u00c9l\u00e9onore shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t know, dear. But whoever she is, she must be very important to him. I can tell you that Richard is a skilled swordsman. He was teaching my grandsons how to fight the last time I was in the Weird. Whoever ran him through is likely dead.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte let her magic slide over Richard\u2019s body. A skilled swordsman. She could believe that\u2014his spare body was strong but supple, honed by constant exercise. His blood pressure was still too low. In time, his body would replenish the blood he lost, but it would take a while, and she didn\u2019t want to gamble.</p> <p>He had called her beautiful.</p><p>She knew she was a reasonably attractive woman, and he had been delirious, so it shouldn\u2019t have mattered, but for some reason it did. She had stayed away from romantic relationships in the Edge\u2014one Elvei was enough\u2014and she had almost forgotten she was a woman. A single word from a complete stranger touched off something feminine inside her. She felt unreasonably pleased when she remembered his saying it, as if he\u2019d given her a gift she really wanted but didn\u2019t expect. He would never know it, but she was grateful for it.</p><p>Charlotte rose and got her cell phone.</p><p>\u201cWho are you calling?\u201d \u00c9l\u00e9onore asked.</p><p>\u201cLuke. Richard will need a blood transfusion, the sooner the better.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShould we leave?\u201d Daisy asked.</p><p>\u00c9l\u00e9onore held her finger to her lips.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d Luke answered.</p><p>She put him on speaker. Holding the phone to her ear was really awkward. \u201cIt\u2019s Charlotte. I need A+.\u201d It had taken her a few weeks to learn the Broken\u2019s medical terminology, but with the help of books, she had eventually prevailed. She\u2019d identified Richard\u2019s blood type when her magic slid through his veins.</p><p>The EMT fell silent. \u201cI can get you two bags. Five hundred.\u201d</p><p>Two pints. It would have to do. \u201cI\u2019ll take it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMeet me at the end of the road in twenty.\u201d Luke hung up.</p><p>\u201cFive hundred dollars?\u201d Daisy\u2019s eyes were the size of saucers.</p><p>\u201cHighway robbery,\u201d \u00c9l\u00e9onore said.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s the only source of blood for Edgers, unless we do a person-to-person transfusion.\u201d Charlotte shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s just money.\u201d She could always make more.</p><p>\u201cDo you want us to leave?\u201d Daisy asked again.</p><p>\u201cI have to meet him and get the blood, but if you don\u2019t mind waiting, I can work on Tulip when I come back.\u201d She was tired, but she couldn\u2019t very well send Tulip out with one cheek clear and the other pockmarked with acne.</p><p>Daisy pursed her lips. Tulip pulled on her sleeve. The older sister sighed. \u201cWe\u2019ll wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease make yourself welcome,\u201d Charlotte said. \u201cThere is tea and snacks in the fridge. I\u2019ll be back in half an hour or so.\u201d</p> <p>The girls went into the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cThank you for doing this for him,\u201d \u00c9l\u00e9onore said.</p><p>\u201cIt will help him heal. Like you said, he\u2019s family.\u201d Charlotte smiled and pulled a medical dictionary off the shelf. In the hollowed-out space inside lay her cash reserve. She plucked the stack of twenties and counted out five hundred. \u201cWill you keep an eye on him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. Charlotte, take a gun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just down the road.\u201d</p><p>\u00c9l\u00e9onore shook her head. \u201cYou never know. I don\u2019t have a good feeling about this. Take a gun just in case.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte took a rifle from the wall, chambered a round, and hugged \u00c9l\u00e9onore.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte went outside, crossed the lawn, and got into the truck. The truck had belonged to Rose, and she had finally learned to drive it last year. It lacked the elegance of the Adrianglian phaetons, but beggars couldn\u2019t be choosers.</p><p>She turned the key. The engine started. There was something about Richard\u2019s face that called to her. She wasn\u2019t sure if it was the handsome masculine lines or the fiery intensity in his eyes. Or maybe it was because he thought she was beautiful. Whatever it was, she had become invested in his survival. She wanted to see him open his eyes again and hear him speak. Most of all, she wanted him to safely recover.</p><p>Five hundred was a small price to pay for that.</p><p>TWO</p><p>\u00c9L\u00c9ONORE checked Richard\u2019s pulse. It was even. Charlotte was a miracle worker, and the poor girl had no idea. Most people in her place would be rolling around in money. None was more desperate than a mother with a sick child or a husband with a dying wife. They\u2019d give you their last dollar. But Charlotte healed them all for a pittance and acted like she was nothing special.</p><p>They had done something to her in the Weird. She was like a bird who\u2019d had her wings broken once, and wasn\u2019t willing to take the risk and try flying again. She fought against wealth and recognition on purpose, as if she was hiding. She never said from who or why. \u00c9l\u00e9onore sighed. Well, she, for one, was content to let her have a safe corner of the Edge to hide in.</p><p>A knock made her turn. Daisy and Tulip stood in the doorway.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a call from work,\u201d Daisy said. \u201cThey want me to come in. Is it okay if I bring Tulip by tonight instead? Do you think Charlotte would mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think she would. Go on. Work\u2019s more important.\u201d \u00c9l\u00e9onore smiled.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Daisy said.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Tulip echoed.</p><p>She was such a sweet, shy girl. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. Charlotte will clear your face right up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo we need you to move the stones?\u201d Daisy asked.</p><p>That\u2019s what living in the Broken does to you, \u00c9l\u00e9onore thought. Daisy had no clue how basic magic worked and wanted nothing to do with it. \u201cNo, the stones only prevent someone from coming in. Once you\u2019re in, you can move them or just step over them to go out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you!\u201d Daisy said again. The girls went out. \u00c9l\u00e9onore heard the screen door slam shut.</p><p>She checked the time. Charlotte had been gone for twenty minutes. She couldn\u2019t cross the boundary into the Broken. Her magic was too strong, so she would likely just wait at the end of the road, before the boundary, until Luke came through and delivered the blood.</p><p>A hint of anxiety squirmed through her, an unpleasant premonition that left unease in its wake. She couldn\u2019t tell if it was her magic warning her or if she\u2019d become paranoid in her old age. It was terrible to get old. But then the alternative wasn\u2019t much better. Besides, Charlotte would sit in the truck with the doors locked. She had a rifle, what little good it would do her. Not that the girl wouldn\u2019t defend herself, but she didn\u2019t have that steel-hard core \u00c9l\u00e9onore\u2019s granddaughter did. Rose\u2019s resolve carried her through life\u2019s rough waters. Charlotte had weathered some storms, but she lacked that primal viciousness of a born Edger. That\u2019s what made her so special, and that\u2019s why she liked her so much, \u00c9l\u00e9onore reflected. She too hadn\u2019t been born in East Laporte. Charlotte\u2019s presence reminded her of a different time and a gentler place.</p><p>\u00c9l\u00e9onore brushed Richard\u2019s hair from his face. \u201cWho is Sophie, Richard?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer. It could\u2019ve been anyone, a wife, a lover, a sister. \u00c9l\u00e9onore knew very little about him. She\u2019d only met him once, but he\u2019d made an impression. It was the way he carried himself with quiet dignity. His brother was all flash, charm, and jokes, but Richard had that sardonic, sharp wit. He didn\u2019t speak much, but occasionally he said clever things with a completely straight face . . .</p><p>\u201cMrs. Drayton!\u201d The scream rang out, high-pitched and vibrating with sheer terror. Tulip.</p><p>\u00c9l\u00e9onore ran to the door. Tulip stood at the wards, her face skewed by fear into a distorted mask. \u201cMrs. Drayton! They have Daisy!\u201d</p><p>\u00c9l\u00e9onore hurried across the lawn. Move faster, legs. \u201cWho? Who has Daisy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMen.\u201d Tulip waved her arms. \u201cWith guns and horses.\u201d</p><p>A long, ululating howl rolled through the Edge. The tiny hairs on the back of \u00c9l\u00e9onore\u2019s neck stood up. She grabbed a stone and pulled Tulip into the protective circle. \u201cInside, now!\u201d</p><p>Tulip ran for the door. \u00c9l\u00e9onore replaced the stone and hurried after her, across the grass, onto the porch steps.</p><p>The sound of hoofbeats made her spin. A rider came down the road. His head was shaved. He wore black leather, and as he rode, the sun glinted off the long chain shackles hanging from his saddle.</p><p>Slavers.</p><p>The realization lashed her like a whip. \u00c9l\u00e9onore dashed across the porch into the house, shut the door, and locked it.</p><p>Tulips stared at her with huge eyes. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShhh!\u201d \u00c9l\u00e9onore moved to the window and peeked through the gap in the curtain. The rider paused by the house, turned his horse, and tried to ride up to the porch. The ward stones shivered. The horse backed away, nearly throwing its rider. He glared at the house, stuck his fingers in his mouth, and whistled.</p><p>More riders followed, joining the first. They wore dark clothes, and their faces were grim. Some bore tattoos, some were painted up, some wore human bones in their hair. Half a dozen wolfripper dogs, big, savage-looking creatures, flanked the horses. A man on the left, scarred, with the face of a bruiser and long blond hair pulled back into a braid rode up and dumped a body onto the ground. Daisy. Mon dieu. She was pale as a sheet.</p><p>The men surrounded the lawn. One, two, three . . . Sixteen that she could see.</p><p>\u00c9l\u00e9onore\u2019s heart sank. There would be no mercy.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cWe were walking down the road to the car. Daisy was looking in her purse for the keys. That blond guy rode out and kicked her. He just kicked her right in the face!\u201d Tulip\u2019s voice squeaked. \u201cShe fell and yelled at me to run, so I ran\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The scarred blond man pulled Daisy forward.</p><p>\u201cHush now,\u201d \u00c9l\u00e9onore whispered.</p><p>\u201cDo it,\u201d he barked.</p> <p>Daisy reached for the nearest stone with a shaking hand. Her cheek was bleeding. She touched the stone and tried to lift it. Magic pulsed. Daisy yelped, jerking her hand back. The slaver sank a kick into her stomach. Daisy screamed and curled into a ball. Tulip cried out, and \u00c9l\u00e9onore clamped her hand over the girl\u2019s mouth.</p><p>The leader\u2019s voice carried over, harsh and grating. \u201cWe don\u2019t want you. We don\u2019t care about you. We want the man you\u2019re hiding inside. Daisy here says she can\u2019t open the ward, and given as she tried, I\u2019m inclined to believe her. It\u2019s up to you, then. Give me what I want, and I\u2019ll go away. It\u2019s that simple.\u201d</p><p>Sixteen men. Far too many. One or two, even four, she could deal with. She\u2019d let them in and curse them, but sixteen was just too many. Thoughts skittered around in \u00c9l\u00e9onore\u2019s head. She had to get help.</p><p>\u201cDo you have a phone?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Tulip pulled a cell phone out of her pocket.</p> <p>\u201cCall Charlotte,\u201d \u00c9l\u00e9onore whispered. \u201cTwo-two-seven twenty-one thirty.\u201d</p><p>Tulips dialed the number with shaking fingers and thrust the phone at her.</p><p>\u201cThis is Charlotte,\u201d Charlotte said, her voice calm.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you?\u201d \u00c9l\u00e9onore whispered.</p><p>\u201cAt the end of the road. Luke was running late, and I just got the blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t come back to the house!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy? \u00c9l\u00e9onore, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need you to go down to the Rooneys\u2019. Take the second fork left, then go to the end of the road. Tell Malcolm Rooney there are slavers at our house. There are sixteen of them, and they want Richard. Tell him he owes me, and that he\u2019s got a pretty daughter and he doesn\u2019t want them showing up at his house next. If he knows what\u2019s good for him, he\u2019ll get the militia together and run them out of the Edge. Go, Charlotte. Go now.\u201d</p><p>The phone beeped, and she thrust it back at Tulip.</p><p>\u201cAll you have to do is walk down and move one of these ward stones.\u201d The slaver called out. \u00c9l\u00e9onore looked through the gap. He had pulled a knife out. The large curved blade caught the sunlight. \u201cYou know how this goes,\u201d he called out. \u201cI\u2019m a peaceful man. Don\u2019t make me do this.\u201d</p><p>CHARLOTTE took a turn at breakneck speed. Slavers? It made no sense. Slavery had been outlawed in both Adrianglia and the Broken for centuries. But the fear in \u00c9l\u00e9onore\u2019s voice was vivid and real.</p><p>She had to get to the Rooneys\u2019. East Laporte had no police force, but when something threatened the entire town, the Edgers sometimes came together into a militia to meet it.</p><p>Trees flashed by her. Come on, she willed. Go faster, truck. Go faster.</p><p>\u201cLISTEN to me.\u201d \u00c9l\u00e9onore grasped Tulip\u2019s bony shoulders. \u201cThey will hurt Daisy now. There\u2019s nothing we can do about it. The ward keeps me from using magic on them, and if we try to shoot them, they\u2019ll kill her.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s my sister!\u201d Tulip whispered back. \u201cIf we give the guy to them\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll murder us all. They\u2019re lying, dear heart. They\u2019re lying, bad, awful bastards. We have to wait until help comes.\u201d \u00c9l\u00e9onore hugged her, wrapping her arms around the girl\u2019s bony shoulders. \u201cNo matter what you hear, no matter what you see, you can\u2019t go out there. We have to wait it out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHold her,\u201d the slaver said.</p><p>Daisy whimpered.</p><p>\u00c9l\u00e9onore clamped Tulip to her. \u201cDon\u2019t listen. Cover your ears.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLast chance. Move the stone, and everyone walks away from this.\u201d</p><p>\u00c9l\u00e9onore held her breath.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d the slaver said.</p><p>Daisy shrieked, a high-pitched sound suffused with pain.</p><p>\u00c9l\u00e9onore chanced a look at the window. The blond slaver was holding something pale and bloody between his index finger and his thumb. Daisy writhed in the hands of two other men.</p><p>\u201cThat was an ear,\u201d the slaver announced. \u201cNext we\u2019ll do fingers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWE have to go.\u201d Charlotte stared at Malcolm Rooney, towering over her by eight inches.</p><p>Around them, the Rooney house was a flurry of activity: short, plump Helen Rooney dialed one number after the other on her cell, going down the list of contacts, while their two teenage sons stockpiled weapons on the porch. As soon as she\u2019d arrived, their oldest son and daughter had left to carry the message down to the neighbors, and now armed men milled about at the house.</p><p>\u201cNow you listen to me,\u201d the big man leaned closer. \u201cThey\u2019re safe behind the wards, and \u00c9l\u00e9onore is a tough old lady. She can handle herself. Sixteen men is a lot of firepower. We sure as hell aren\u2019t going to ride out there unprepared, or we might as well just slit our own throats and be done with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re alone in the house!\u201d She saw a dozen men ready to go.</p><p>\u201cIt will be fine,\u201d Malcolm said.</p><p>She looked into his eyes and knew arguing was useless. He would do this at his own pace or not at all.</p><p>\u201cAnother hour, and we\u2019ll be good to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn hour?\u201d He was out of his mind. You could get the entire town up and moving in thirty minutes.</p><p>\u201cIt will be fine,\u201d Helen Rooney said, the phone still to her ear. \u201cIt just takes time to get everyone together, that\u2019s all. Everything will be okay.\u201d</p><p>The sickening, nagging feeling in the pit of Charlotte\u2019s stomach said otherwise.</p><p>Malcolm pulled a shotgun off the wall. \u201cYou\u2019re lucky East Laporte is a different place now than it was six years ago. Back then, you would\u2019ve gotten no help, but now people will come together.\u201d</p><p>He turned his massive back to her. She realized what was happening: the Edgers were delaying on purpose. Nobody wanted to confront sixteen armed men, so they were dragging their feet, hoping things would resolve themselves.</p><p>Charlotte took a deep breath and let go of her persona as an unassuming Edge healer. She raised her head, sinking the icy, unmistakable tone of command into her words. \u201cMr. Rooney.\u201d</p><p>He turned, surprise stamped on his face. He had expected the Charlotte who lived down the road. Instead, he got Baroness Charlotte de Ney, the Healer of Ganer. She stood before him, the full power of her magic in her eyes, her power radiating from her. The house was suddenly silent.</p><p>\u201cYour wife is developing osteoporosis, you have an enlarged prostate, and your youngest son doesn\u2019t have ADHD, as your wife told me; he has hyperthyroidism. If you want any of these problems to be treated in the future, you will stop patting my shoulder and telling me not to worry my pretty little head about it. You will get this mob together now and follow me out there, or so help me gods, I will make your life hell. You think those aches and pains you feel now are bad. After I get through with you, you will be a broken man. Move.\u201d</p><p>TULIP went rigid in her arms. \u201cDon\u2019t look,\u201d \u00c9l\u00e9onore whispered.</p><p>Daisy flailed, throwing all of her weight. \u201cNo! No, no, no . . .\u201d</p><p>The slavers dragged her to the ground and pinned her hand to the edge of the sidewalk.</p><p>Knife flashed. Daisy screamed, a wordless, sharp shriek of pain.</p><p>\u201cLeft pinkie,\u201d the slaver announced. \u201cYou planning on getting married? Because I\u2019m about to take the ring finger.\u201d</p><p>Tulip jerked, trying to get out of \u00c9l\u00e9onore\u2019s arms.</p><p>\u201cStop!\u201d \u00c9l\u00e9onore tried to hold on, but the girl bucked like a wild beast, suddenly too strong to hold. \u00c9l\u00e9onore gripped her, holding on, Tulip\u2019s panicked kicking pushing them against a window.</p><p>A shot rang out. Glass shattered and something bit \u00c9l\u00e9onore in the shoulder, right into the bone. Her fingers slipped, suddenly weak. Tulip shoved her back and scrambled toward the door.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d \u00c9l\u00e9onore screamed.</p><p>Tulip burst out of the door and onto the lawn.</p><p>\u00c9l\u00e9onore jerked the door open. \u201cStop, Tulip!\u201d</p><p>A hot, piercing pain struck \u00c9l\u00e9onore in the chest, pitching her back. She lost her balance and fell onto the porch, half-hidden by the wooden rail. Suddenly it was so hard to breathe. The air turned bitter. They had shot her, she realized. She began pulling power to herself. The magic came slow, like cold molasses.</p><p>At the ward stones, Tulip turned and was looking at her with wide, panicked eyes.</p><p>\u201cTulip, is it?\u201d the scarred slaver said. \u201cDon\u2019t look at her. Look here. Is this your friend? Sister maybe, no? Sister, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou open the ward, and they will kill you,\u201d \u00c9l\u00e9onore called.</p><p>\u201cI give you my word,\u201d the slaver said. \u201cNobody will kill you.\u201d</p><p>The magic kept winding around her. Not enough. Not nearly enough. She was too old, she realized. Too old and too weak. She\u2019d outlived her power. \u201cDon\u2019t do it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to go home, Tulip?\u201d the slaver asked.</p><p>\u00c9l\u00e9onore tried to rise, but her legs wouldn\u2019t hold her.</p><p>\u201cMove the ward stone, and it will be all over,\u201d the slaver said. \u201cYou and your sister can go home. I\u2019ll even give you her parts back. See?\u201d He held out a bloody stump of a finger.</p><p>Tulip cringed.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t!\u201d \u00c9l\u00e9onore called out. Her voice was going hoarse. Blood stained the porch boards, and she realized it was hers.</p><p>\u201cI said to shoot her,\u201d the slaver said. \u201cDo I have to finish her myself?\u201d</p><p>Bullets whistled around \u00c9l\u00e9onore, biting into the wooden rail around the porch.</p><p>\u201cStop!\u201d Tulip cried out.</p><p>The blond slaver raised his hand. The shots died.</p><p>\u201cSee? I\u2019ll stop for you. I can be reasonable. You don\u2019t listen to her,\u201d the slaver said. \u201cShe\u2019s old and selfish. You have to do what is good for you and your sister. Move the stone, we\u2019ll get our guy, and we go our separate ways. Otherwise, I\u2019ll have to cut off something else. Maybe your sister\u2019s lips or her nose. She\u2019d be disfigured for life.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Tulip stood, frozen.</p><p>\u201cHold her down,\u201d the slaver said.</p><p>They flipped Daisy over on her back.

The circle of protective magic broke.</p><p>Oh, you foolish child. You foolish, foolish child . . .</p><p>The large thug next to the scarred man stepped over the useless stone and backhanded Tulip out of the way. She fell on the grass.</p><p>A gun barked twice. \u00c9l\u00e9onore jerked and saw the scarred slaver raise a smoking gun. The back of Daisy\u2019s head was a bloody mess. She wasn\u2019t moving.</p> <p>Tulip screamed, a high-pitched desperate shriek.</p><p>She had to save her. \u00c9l\u00e9onore gritted her teeth. She was old, but she was still a hedge witch.</p><p>The larger slaver moved on to Tulip.</p><p>\u00c9l\u00e9onore hurried, pulling magic to her in a desperate rush.</p><p>\u201cLeave it,\u201d the leader said.</p><p>I\u2019m so sorry, Rose. I\u2019m so sorry. I just wish we could\u2019ve visited one last time.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s free merchandise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you seen her face? You\u2019ve got to think before you act, Kosom. Who\u2019s gonna buy her with that face? You can fuck her once, if you put a sheet over her head, but nobody\u2019s going to purchase that. The buyers don\u2019t want ugly women. You have got to develop some business sense. Go kill the old lady on the porch and drag the Hunter out of this damned house.\u201d</p><p>Tulip sat up, her eyes wide.</p><p>The last strand of magic wound itself about \u00c9l\u00e9onore. It was all she could hold.</p><p>The big thug pointed his gun at Tulip\u2019s face.</p><p>\u00c9l\u00e9onore let go. The magic shot across the lawn, sticking to the thug with the gun and splashing to the other three men near him, surrounding them like a swarm of dark bats.</p><p>\u201cRun!\u201d \u00c9l\u00e9onore screamed. \u201cRun, Tulip!\u201d</p><p>Tulip scrambled backward, rolled to her feet, and dashed across the road into the woods.</p> <p>The four thugs fell, contorted by spasms, but the leader and more than two-thirds of the slavers remained standing. Her magic had fallen too short.</p><p>The leader with the pale hair ran up onto the porch. \u201cYou old whore.\u201d</p><p>She got away. At least the child got away.</p><p>The slaver pulled a gun from a holster. \u201cYou fucking bitch.\u201d</p><p>\u00c9l\u00e9onore glared at him. She would die here, on this porch, but she would take him with her. \u00c9l\u00e9onore spat blood from her mouth and spoke the words, binding the last of her power into them, drawing on the very magic that anchored her to life. There was no cure from a death curse. \u201cI curse you. You won\u2019t see the sunset . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck you.\u201d He raised his gun. The black barrel stared at her.</p><p>In her mind she was hugging the boys, George on her right and Jack on her left. Flowers bloomed all around them, and Rose was waving at her from across a sunlit garden. \u201c. . . And you\u2019ll suffer before you die.\u201d</p><p>The last words left her mouth, taking her life with it. The world vanished.</p><p>CHARLOTTE checked the dashboard clock. Fifteen minutes past noon. She had been gone for close to an hour. The makeshift militia left the Rooneys\u2019 ten minutes after she made her stand. Three trucks filled with armed people traveled in front of her, and on the sides, half a dozen Edgers rode on horses.</p><p>It was taking too long. Please, Dawn Mother. Please don\u2019t let it be too late.</p><p>The leading truck sped up. So did the next two. She frowned.</p><p>In the truck bed in front of her people were looking up and to the right. Charlotte bent forward, trying to get a better view through the windshield.</p><p>A column of black greasy smoke rose above the treetops.</p><p>Oh no.</p><p>She laid on her horn.</p><p>The trucks hurried up the road. Charlotte clenched the wheel. Come on. Come on!</p><p>The trees parted.</p><p>A torrent of fire devoured the house. Orange-and-red flames billowed out of the roof, blackened support beams thrusting out like bones of a skeleton. Fire filled the doorway, boiling within the house, winding about the porch posts, and belching smoke. The orange flames surged through the windows, licking the siding.</p><p>Charlotte jerked the truck into park, shoved the door open, and ran across the lawn. The heat slammed into her, pushing her back, and she jerked her hand up, trying to shield her eyes from the worst of it. Ash swirled around her.</p><p>Corpses sprawled on the grass, four armed men, their bodies contorted, their faces grotesque masks. Her skin crawled. Suddenly, she was both hot and cold.</p><p>A high-pitched mewling sound made her turn. At the edge of the lawn, Daisy\u2019s body lay on her stomach. A wet red hole gaped in her head. Tulip slumped by the body.</p><p>Charlotte\u2019s magic burst out of her, sliding over the girls, checking . . . Tulip was unhurt. Minor bruising on the face but no major injuries. Daisy was dead. Irreparably, irreversibly dead. Not a hint of life remained.</p><p>Cold shot through her. She wasn\u2019t fast enough. They called her for help, and she wasn\u2019t fast enough.</p><p>Tulip sat on the grass next to her sister, her hands bloody, her face smeared with tears and dirt, and wailed. Her pain stabbed at Charlotte, hot and acute, overwhelming. There was nothing she could do to help it. All her magic and all her power was useless.</p><p>Helen Rooney dropped on the ground by Tulip, trying to hug her, but Tulip pushed free and kept crying. The black-and-gray ash rained on her face. She wailed and wailed, as if she was trying to expel her heart and all of the ache in it out of her body with her voice.</p><p>\u201cWhere is \u00c9l\u00e9onore, sweetie?\u201d Helen asked.</p><p>Tulip pointed at the fire.</p><p>Charlotte turned to the house. A charred figure lay on the porch, little more than a scorched husk.</p><p>Charlotte\u2019s world screeched to a halt.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t bring herself to move. She just stared at the broken, burned body. \u00c9l\u00e9onore . . . \u00c9l\u00e9onore was dead. How could this be? Her mind refused to accept it. \u00c9l\u00e9onore was alive and vibrant less than an hour ago. She was alive, she was talking and walking, and now she was dead, and Daisy was dead with her.</p><p>\u00c9l\u00e9onore would never smile again. She would never catch the cuckoo clock as it fell out of her hair. No more stories about Rose and the boys. No more of anything.</p><p>\u201cWhat about the man?\u201d Helen asked.</p><p>\u201cThey took him,\u201d Tulip sobbed.</p><p>Helen leaned toward her, murmuring something. Malcolm bent over them.</p><p>I need to move, flashed in Charlotte\u2019s head. She needed to do something, say something, but she just couldn\u2019t. She just stood there, locked into a painful haze.</p><p>Malcolm Rooney walked across the lawn to her. She saw his lips move, but no sound came.</p><p>The roof beams crashed down with a loud crack and tumbled in an explosion of sparks. Charlotte jerked. Her hearing returned, and she heard Malcolm\u2019s deep voice: \u201c. . . slavers.\u201d He shook several pairs of shackles at her. \u201cFound this on the bodies. Haven\u2019t seen their kind in ten years. Must\u2019ve hit quick. Looks like they popped Daisy in the head, shot \u00c9l\u00e9onore, took your fellow, and set the house on fire. Tulip hid in the woods and watched the whole thing, poor kid. The house was gone in minutes. It\u2019s an old building. Went up like kindling. They\u2019re on horses, looks like a dozen, maybe more, besides those.\u201d Malcolm nodded at the bodies. \u201cThat\u2019s \u00c9l\u00e9onore\u2019s work. They call it the Broken Stick curse, because it locks them into weird shapes like that. The old lady had a lot of power in her.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth finally managed to make a word. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what slavers do. They raid towns like ours, steal kids and pretty women, and take them off to the Weird to sell as slaves there. This Richard fellow must\u2019ve pissed them off somehow.\u201d</p><p>Richard . . . The slavers had taken him. Her mind started up slowly, as if rusted. She was too late for \u00c9l\u00e9onore and Daisy, but there was still a life they could save. \u201cWe have to go after them.\u201d</p><p>Malcolm shook his head. \u201cSlavers are a nasty lot. They got what they wanted, and they\u2019re gone. This Richard, he\u2019s no kin to me. Hell, he didn\u2019t even grow up around here. He stirred them slavers up like a hornets\u2019 nest, and they chased him here, but now they\u2019re gone, and this thing\u2019s done with. Take a long, hard look at what he brought down on you. I say good riddance.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him, shocked. He would not do anything. He had already made up his mind\u2014she saw the decision in his eyes. Malcolm Rooney, the big, strong bull of a man, was afraid. He would walk away.</p><p>\u201cThose bastards shattered four lives. \u00c9l\u00e9onore took me in. She made me welcome, she gave me a second chance at life, and they murdered her and burned her body and her house.\u201d Her voice rose. \u201cThey killed Daisy, who was barely twenty, and her fifteen-year-old sister watched her die. And you\u2019re just going to let it go?\u201d</p><p>Malcolm clamped his mouth shut.</p><p>Charlotte looked past him at the Edgers. Guilt and sadness stamped their faces. Not a single one would meet her eyes.</p><p>Dear gods. The tiny hairs on the back of her neck stood on their ends. They agreed with Malcolm. They would all just walk away and pretend that this horror never happened. She had known that in the Edge every man was out for himself, but this? This seemed inhuman.</p><p>\u201c\u00c9l\u00e9onore lived here all her life.\u201d She pointed to the charred corpse. \u201cHer body is still smoldering over there. Don\u2019t you understand? If we don\u2019t stop them, they\u2019ll do this again. Look at Tulip. Look at her!\u201d</p><p>People looked at their feet, at the grass, anywhere but at her or the child crying her heart out.</p><p>\u201cChasing them will only get more people killed, and none of us have children or relatives to spare,\u201d Malcolm said quietly. \u201cWe\u2019ll find a place for Tulip. Hell, looks like Helen won\u2019t let go of her, so I guess she\u2019ll be coming home with us. You ought to come on down, too.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte looked at him because looking at Daisy\u2019s and \u00c9l\u00e9onore\u2019s bodies hurt. Grief filled her to the brim, bitter and overwhelming. She was choking on it. Oh gods, Rose and the boys would eventually need to know. What would she even tell them? I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t get there in time? I\u2019m sorry I went on with my life as if it didn\u2019t matter and let those bastards spread their misery? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe can fix a bedroom for you,\u201d Malcolm said gently. \u201cThe more the merrier, they say. It will be okay, Charlotte. It will all work out. You\u2019ve done helped many people here. We\u2019ll find you a new place to live, don\u2019t you worry about that. What do you say?\u201d</p><p>The pain, sadness, shock, and guilt churned inside her. She couldn\u2019t contain it. She had to do something.</p><p>The slavers thought they could stomp out people, and they would keep going, killing, burning, and hurting children. They would crush other lives just as they had crushed her little comfortable world. Even now they rode away, unpunished, carrying off the man she had healed, and she didn\u2019t even know why any of this had happened. They would hurt him, torture him, and likely kill him.</p> <p>Somebody had to make a stand. If none of the Edgers would step up, she would have to be that somebody. There was nobody else.</p><p>Charlotte reached deep inside herself, into the darkness, carefully hidden and locked away, and found a single crimson spark. She forged a tentative connection. Need flooded her, the magic so hungry, so desperate to break out, and feed, and kill. Fear shot through her. She almost recoiled. If she let it loose, there would be no turning back. She\u2019d worked so hard to bind this part of herself. She had almost succeeded.</p><p>Charlotte looked at Tulip\u2019s face, at the wet streaks of tears stained with ash.</p><p>\u201cTulip!\u201d</p><p>The girl looked up.</p> <p>Charlotte held on to the spark. \u201cI can\u2019t bring Daisy back to life, sweetheart. But I can make sure that they don\u2019t hurt another girl the way they hurt you. I\u2019ll make them pay. I promise you, they won\u2019t take anyone else\u2019s sister away.\u201d</p><p>Tulip\u2019s face quivered, and she sobbed.</p><p>\u201cCharlotte?\u201d Malcolm asked.</p><p>Charlotte took a deep breath and blew on the spark.</p><p>\u201cAre you listening to me?\u201d</p><p>The crimson and darkness exploded inside her, twisting into a hungry, furious inferno.</p> <p>She looked at him, and her face must\u2019ve been terrible, because Malcolm Rooney took a step back. Charlotte turned and strode across the grass to her truck.</p><p>\u201cIf you go, you\u2019re going alone!\u201d Malcolm yelled.</p><p>She kept walking, her magic raging inside her.</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t bring \u00c9l\u00e9onore back! They\u2019ll just murder you. Charlotte? Charlotte!\u201d</p><p>She got into her truck and started the engine. The fire inside her burst out, winding about her in tendrils of deep, angry red.</p><p>These bastards would never hurt anyone again. She would make sure of it.</p><p>THREE</p><p>WHEN a man found himself in difficult circumstances, it always paid to assess the situation. Especially if he woke up and found he couldn\u2019t move.</p> <p>Richard opened his eyes.</p><p>Let\u2019s see. First, he was in a cage, a fact made painfully apparent by the pattern of steel bars imposed on the riders, silhouetted against an old forest. Second, his hands were tied behind his back. Third, a heavy chain shackled his legs to the steel ring in the bottom of the cage. Fourth, a thicker chain secured the cage to the cart, making several loops, as if the weight of the cage wedged into the cart\u2019s hold wasn\u2019t enough to hold it in place. Ergo, he was captured by the slavers, and they were afraid that he would sprout wings and take off with the three-hundred-pound cage around him.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t remember how he got into the cage. At some point he must\u2019ve been beaten\u2014his face ached and was likely bruised. He tasted mud on his lips, probably from someone\u2019s boot. Also, judging from a less than pleasant odor, someone had taken the time to urinate on his chest. Slavers, a charming breed, always happy to treat their guests to their fabled hospitality.</p><p>The wound in his side didn\u2019t hurt at all, and despite all of his expectations, he was still alive.</p><p>How in the world was he still breathing? He had taken enough wounds to recognize the stab to his liver was life-threatening even if he had been magically transported to a surgeon\u2019s table the moment after he had received it. Instead, he\u2019d made it fatal by running for hours.</p><p>He recalled falling by some road. There was something in between that and the cage, something murky. For some reason, he had a feeling it involved \u00c9l\u00e9onore, Rose\u2019s grandmother, whom he\u2019d met once. Another memory surfaced, a woman with gray eyes and blond hair. Her face was a blur, but he remembered her eyes under the sweep of dark blond eyebrows, intense and beautiful\u2014his foggy memory made them luminescent\u2014and the concern he read in their depth arrested him. Nobody had looked at him like that for years. It was such a beautiful memory that he was half-sure it was a product of his hallucinating brain yearning for something radiant in his grim, blood-drenched life.</p><p>Except that someone had healed him because his injury was gone. Stab wounds didn\u2019t just vanish on their own. It gave his muddy recollection of the woman with gray eyes some credence, but healing magic was exceedingly rare and highly prized. Finding someone in the Edge with it was extremely unlikely. The Edge was the hellish place you went when neither the Weird nor the Broken would have you. A healer with talent like that would\u2019ve been treasured in the Weird.</p><p>This was getting him nowhere. He had no plausible explanation why he was alive, so he\u2019d have to set it aside for the time being. His more immediate problem was the cage and a crew of slavers guarding it.</p><p>There was no way to tell how long he\u2019d been unconscious, but it was unlikely he\u2019d been out for too long. They were traveling through the Weird\u2019s woods, and the magic flowed full force. The forest crowded them in, the massive tree trunks, fed by magic and nourished by rich Adrianglian soil, rose to improbable heights. Against that backdrop, the riders on the barely visible trail seemed insignificant and small. The horses moved at a slow walk, hampered by the wagon carrying him.</p><p>Richard cataloged the familiar faces. A few were new, but he knew about half of them, prime examples of scum floating in the gutter of humanity. His memory served up their names, their brief biographies, and their weaknesses. He\u2019d studied them the way others studied books. Some came from families, some were born psychotic, and others were just greedy and stupid. Most carried rifles and blades, their gear worn and none too clean. He didn\u2019t see any wolf-dogs and didn\u2019t hear any either. Where had all of the hounds gone?</p><p>CHARLOTTE stepped out of the truck. Ahead, the overgrown dirt road ended, turning into a forest path. The boundary loomed before her. She felt it in the very marrow of her bones, a strange disturbing pressure that threatened to squeeze the breath out of her.</p><p>The slavers had passed through it. The brush still bowed, disturbed by the riders. She saw the traces of hoofprints on the ground and the twin grooves of wide wheels. They had a cart, and not magic-powered like the modern phaetons, but an old-fashioned, horse-drawn cart, the kind country people still used in the provinces. The trail led through the boundary, so she would have to pass this way, too. The last time she had crossed it, the feeling of her magic being peeled away nearly made her turn back.</p><p>Charlotte took a deep breath and stepped into the boundary. The magic clutched her, squeezing at her organs as if trying to wring the lifeblood from them. The pressure pushed her, propelling her forward. Each step was a conscious effort. Sweat broke on her forehead. Another step. Another. The pressure crushed her. Charlotte hunched over. She would crawl if she had to.</p><p>Another step.</p><p>Suddenly, the grinding burden vanished. Magic flooded her, rejuvenating her body. It was an absurd sensation, but she felt herself opening up like a flower greeting the morning sun. If she\u2019d had wings, they would\u2019ve unfurled. She inhaled slowly. There it was, the familiar potent power she was so used to wielding. During her years in the Edge, living with half magic, she had forgotten how wonderful it felt.</p><p>She had never understood why \u00c9l\u00e9onore didn\u2019t move to the Weird . . .</p><p>\u00c9l\u00e9onore.</p><p>She had to keep moving. She was at least half an hour behind the slavers, probably more. The old Adrianglian forest stretched before her. The forest path forked ahead. Which way, right or left?</p><p>Charlotte knelt to the ground, trying to follow the hoofprints. A carpet of old pine needles blanketed the floor of the woods and the path, obscuring the trail. She had learned some tracking when she was a girl from an old veteran scout living at Ganer College because she thought it was interesting. But those lessons were long ago, and she had never taken them very seriously.</p><p>A high-pitched, labored whine came from under the brush on her left. She turned. Two brown canine eyes looked at her from a large black muzzle.</p><p>Charlotte froze.</p><p>The dog dipped its big head and let out another thin whine. She smelled blood. It lashed her healer instinct like a whip. The dark magic raging inside her vanished, as if snuffed out.</p><p>\u201cEasy now.\u201d Charlotte crouched and moved toward the dog. \u201cEasy.\u201d</p><p>It lay on its side, panting.</p><p>She reached for it.</p><p>The dog\u2019s lips trembled, betraying a flash of fangs.</p><p>Charlotte stopped moving, her hand outstretched. \u201cIf you bite me, I won\u2019t help you.\u201d The dog couldn\u2019t understand her, but it could understand the tone of her voice.</p><p>Slowly she reached forward. The dog opened its mouth. Jaws snapped but fell short of her fingers. It was too weak.</p><p>\u201cIf you were healthy, you\u2019d tear my hand off, huh?\u201d</p><p>Charlotte touched the fur, sending a current of golden sparks through the furry body. Male, low blood pressure. A bullet wound passing through the abdomen. Someone had shot the dog.</p><p>\u201cThis world is full of terrible people,\u201d she told him, and began to repair the damage. The bullet had entered the chest, cut through the left lung, and tore out of the dog\u2019s side. Judging by the state of the wound and blood loss, it had happened about five to six hours ago.</p><p>Charlotte knitted the injured tissues, rebuilding the lung.</p><p>The dog leaned over and licked her hand, a quick, short lick, as if embarrassed by his own weakness.</p><p>\u201cChange your mind since it doesn\u2019t hurt as much anymore?\u201d She sealed the wound and petted his withers. Her hand slid against a spiked collar. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t be a slaver dog, would you?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The dog rose. He was a massive beast\u2014if they both stood upright, he could put his paws on her shoulders.</p><p>Charlotte got up. \u201cWhere are your owners?\u201d</p><p>The dog looked at her, sniffed the air, and turned to the right.</p> <p>She had nothing better to go on.</p><p>\u201cRight it is,\u201d Charlotte said, and followed the dog down the path.</p><p>THE wagon rolled over a root, creaking.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s far enough,\u201d a grating voice called out. Voshak Corwen, a seasoned slaver with over a dozen raids under his belt. Hardly a surprise, Richard reflected. This was the man Tuline had promised to betray. They must\u2019ve agreed to set that little trap together, and when Richard had cut his way through Tuline\u2019s crew, Voshak took his men and went after him.</p><p>\u201cWe make camp here,\u201d Voshak said.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re only two hours from the boundary,\u201d a tall, redheaded man called out. Richard didn\u2019t recognize him. Must be a new hire. The slavers needed to replenish their herd regularly\u2014he kept thinning it out.</p><p>Voshak rode into view. Of average height, he was built with a gristle-and-tendon kind of strength: lean, with high endurance. He wasn\u2019t the fastest or the strongest, but he would go the distance. A network of scars sliced his face. No doubt he had some romantic story about how he got them instead of admitting that a stablehand had raked his face with a pitchfork during a failed slave raid.</p><p>Voshak\u2019s hair, a pale blond braid, which he bleached, was his trademark. It made him memorable. That\u2019s how the slavers operated. They adopted costumes and personas, trying to make themselves larger-than-life and hoping to inspire fear. They counted on that fear. One could fight a man, but nobody could fight a nightmare.</p><p>Voshak focused on the redhead. \u201cMilhem, did I make you my second?\u201d</p><p>Milhem looked down.</p><p>Ceyren, Voshak\u2019s second, was likely dead; otherwise, he would be here pulling Milhem off his horse and beating him to a bloody pulp. Interesting.</p> <p>\u201cThen don\u2019t open your trap,\u201d Voshak said. \u201cIf I want your opinion, I\u2019ll beat it out of you.\u201d He surveyed the riders. \u201cIf any of you morons are worried, nobody\u2019s following us. These are Edgers. They look out for number one, and none of them want to catch a bullet. It\u2019s been twenty hours since we last slept, and I\u2019m tired. Now make the damn camp.\u201d He turned to an older, one-eyed slaver. \u201cCrow, you\u2019re my second now. See they get it done.\u201d</p><p>Crow, a broad-shouldered, weather-beaten bastard, roared, \u201cGet a move on!\u201d</p><p>Reasonable choice for a second, Richard reflected. Crow was older, had experience, and he worked hard to inspire fear. If his eye patch and height didn\u2019t do it, the heavy black leather and ponytail of jet-black hair decorated with finger bones would.</p><p>Voshak turned his horse. His gaze paused on Richard. \u201cAwake, my gentle maid? You\u2019ve got something right here.\u201d The slaver touched the left corner of his mouth. \u201cWhat is that? . . . Oh, that\u2019s shit from the bottom of my boot.\u201d</p><p>Laughter rang out.</p><p>Richard smiled, baring his teeth. \u201cAlways brightening the day with your humor, Leftie.\u201d</p><p>A muscle jerked in Voshak\u2019s face. He clenched his reins. \u201cYou sit in your cage, Hunter. When we get where we\u2019re going, you\u2019ll sing like a bird when I start cutting through your joints.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was that? I didn\u2019t quite hear.\u201d Richard leaned forward, focusing on Voshak. A hint of fear shivered in the slaver\u2019s eyes, and Richard drank it in. \u201cCome closer to the cage, Voshak. Don\u2019t cower like a little boy hiding from your daddy and his belt.\u201d</p> <p>Voshak dug his spurs into his horse\u2019s flanks. The animal jumped, and he rode off. Coward. Most of them were cowards, cruel and vicious. Brave men didn\u2019t kidnap children in the middle of the night and sell them to perverts to earn their drinking money.</p><p>The riders dismounted. Two secured the horses, keeping well away from his cage. Others began pulling tents from the saddlebags, olive and gray, with a red logo spelling out COLEMAN sewn on one side. The tents must\u2019ve come from the Broken. A few slavers piled together some branches. A dark-haired man soaked them in fluid from a flask, struck a match, and dropped it on the fuel. Fire flared up like an orange mushroom. He shied back, rubbing his face.</p><p>\u201cYou got any eyebrows left, Pavel?\u201d Crow called.</p><p>Pavel spat into the fire. \u201cIt\u2019s burning, ain\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>A slaver stopped by the cage. He was thin, with dirty brown hair and pale eyes. He climbed onto the wagon, opened a small door near the top of the cage, barely large enough to pass a bowl through, and dipped a ladle with a long handle into a bucket.</p><p>Richard waited. His mouth was so dry, he could almost taste the water.</p><p>The slaver passed the ladle through the window. \u201cWhy Leftie?\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s what his father used to call him before he beat him in his drunken rages,\u201d Richard said. \u201cHis right testicle never dropped.\u201d</p><p>The slaver held the ladle closer. Richard drank, three deep delicious gulps, then the man retracted the ladle and latched the window shut.</p><p>The slavers began to settle down. A pot was set over the fire; a couple of rabbits had been dressed and chopped into it. Voshak came to sit by the flames, facing the cage. He bent to poke at the coals, and Richard pondered the top of the man\u2019s blond head. The human skull was such a fragile thing. If only his hands weren\u2019t tied.</p><p>He had to survive and bide his time. The slavers were taking him to the Market, he was sure of it. Left to his own devices, Voshak would\u2019ve strung him up on the first tree he saw. Richard grinned. And after his neck snapped, Voshak would probably stab his corpse a few times, drown it, then set it on fire. Just in case.</p><p>Someone near the top of the slaver food chain must\u2019ve recognized that the rank-and-file slaver crews feared the Hunter. They wanted to boost morale by making a production out of killing him. Richard might have worked for a year to get to the Market, but he had no intention of arriving there on their terms. An opportunity would present itself. He just had to recognize it and make the best of it.</p><p>If he failed now, Sophie would take his place. The thought filled Richard with dread.</p><p>Revenge was an infectious disease. For a time it gave you the strength to go on, but it devoured you from the inside like a cancer, and when your target was finally destroyed, all that remained was a hollow shell of your former self. Then the target\u2019s relatives began their own hunt, and the cycle continued. He\u2019d learned that lesson at seventeen, when a feuding family\u2019s bullet exploded in his father\u2019s skull, spraying bloody mist all over the market stall. What he had lost was irreplaceable. No amount of death would bring his father back to life. Back then, Richard was already a warrior, a killer, and he continued to kill, but never out of revenge. He severed lives so the family would be safe, and the new generations would never feel the pain of having their parents ripped out of their lives. He fought to keep the rest of them safe.</p><p>He failed.</p><p>Richard\u2019s memory resurrected Sophie the way she used to be\u2014a funny, beautiful, fearless child. The muddy swamp flashed before Richard. When he had finally found Sophie in one of the holes, she was standing on the body of a slaver she had killed. As he pulled her out, her eyes burned with a fear and hate that had no place on the face of a twelve-year-old child. She had survived the slavers, but she would never be the same.</p><p>He\u2019d hoped the years would cure it, but time only nurtured it. He watched, powerless, as that fear and hate germinated into self-loathing. When she came to him asking to be taught to work with the blade, he viewed it as a diversion. Sophie had never taken her lessons seriously before, neither from her own father nor from her sister. He thought she would get bored. He had no idea.</p><p>Her self-hate grew and matured into steely determination. He saw it in Sophie\u2019s face every morning when she picked up her sword to meet him in practice. He was running out of things to teach her. One day, she would decide she was good enough, take her blade, and go hunting instead. He wouldn\u2019t be able to stop her, so he had chosen to beat her to the punch. What he was doing wasn\u2019t revenge, but justice. The world had failed Sophie by allowing slavers to exist. He had failed her by letting her suffer at their hands. He hoped to restore her faith in both.</p><p>A woman walked out of the forest. She was tall, about five-foot-eight, and pale. Mud splattered her faded jeans. Her lavender T-shirt had a scoop neckline and was smudged with something dark, dirt or possibly soot. Her blond hair rested on top of her head in a loose knot. Her mouth was full, her eyes were wide and round, and the line of her jaw was soft and feminine. She was beautiful, refined, but iced over by a lack of emotion and an eerie, unnatural calm.</p><p>Their stares connected. Every cell in his body went on alert. He couldn\u2019t see her eye color from this distance, but he was sure her eyes were gray.</p><p>She was real.</p><p>His stomach tightened in alarm. What are you doing here? Run. Run before they see you.</p><p>The conversation died. The slavers stared.</p><p>Crow picked up his rifle and rolled into a crouch.</p><p>\u201cNow that\u2019s what I call free merchandise,\u201d Voshak murmured from his perch on a fallen log.</p><p>\u201cThere are no towns around here,\u201d Crow said quietly. \u201cWhere did she come from? I say shoot her now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your hurry?\u201d Voshak leaned forward. \u201cNo gun, no knife. If she could flash, she would\u2019ve hit us by now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like it,\u201d Crow said. \u201cShe might be with him.\u201d</p><p>Voshak glanced at the cage. Richard turned to look him in the eye, and the slaver captain shrugged.</p><p>\u201cHunter is the Weird\u2019s animal. She\u2019s wearing jeans. And if she\u2019s with him, then he\u2019ll enjoy watching me fuck her brains out.\u201d Voshak raised his voice. \u201cHey, sweetheart! Are you lost?\u201d</p><p>The woman didn\u2019t answer. She was still looking at him, and her eyes told Richard she wasn\u2019t lost. No, she was exactly where she wanted to be. She had some sort of plan. How did she get here?</p><p>\u201cWhere are you from?\u201d Voshak asked. \u201cTalk to me. Are your folks worried about you?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The woman said nothing.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s mute,\u201d someone offered.</p><p>\u201cA pretty woman who doesn\u2019t talk.

Not enough magic to go either way. Eventually, the boundary spits them out, but they\u2019re not quite right after that. The lights are on, but nobody\u2019s driving. They just wander around until they starve to death.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cToo much magic.\u201d Pavel waved his hand around his ear. \u201cFries their brains right up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t\u2014\u201d Crow began.</p><p>\u201cYes, we know. You don\u2019t like it.\u201d Voshak grimaced and turned it into a smile. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, sweetheart,\u201d the slaver captain called out. \u201cWe\u2019ll take good care of you. You come sit by me.\u201d He petted the log next to him.</p><p>The woman didn\u2019t move.</p><p>\u201cCome on.\u201d Voshak winked at her. \u201cIt\u2019s all right.\u201d</p><p>The woman approached, moving with innate grace.</p> <p>Richard watched her. She glanced at him briefly as she took her seat, and he saw a smart, agile mind behind her eyes. No, she wasn\u2019t fried. Not at all. But Voshak was right. She had no weapons. Even if she was a flasher, the slavers were too spread out. Someone would shoot her before she got them all. He had to get out of this cursed cage.</p><p>\u201cPass me that puppy chain,\u201d Voshak said.</p><p>Pavel passed the twelve-foot chain to him. The slavers used them as human tie outs\u2014just enough length to let slaves shuffle off to the bushes to relieve themselves. Voshak smiled and locked one iron cuff on the woman\u2019s ankle, above her shoe. He locked the other on his own ankle. \u201cThere we go. Just like marriage.\u201d</p><p>The woman gave no indication she understood what had just happened.</p><p>Voshak leaned closer to her and brushed a small tendril of hair from the back of her long, graceful neck. \u201cThat\u2019s a good girl.\u201d</p><p>Richard wished for a sword, a knife, a nail. Anything he could stretch his flash on. He\u2019d slice through the bars with the first cut and sever Voshak\u2019s fingers from the rest of him with the second. Watching him touch her was like seeing filth smeared on her skin.</p><p>Voshak let go of her neck. \u201cIf only you were fifteen years younger. You\u2019d be worth double.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019d make her what, like ten?\u201d a young man asked from the right.</p> <p>\u201cMore like fifteen,\u201d Voshak said. \u201cShe\u2019s fared well, but you\u2019ve got to look closely. See, no baby fat left. No wrinkles yet, and her lips are still full, but the face doesn\u2019t have that fresh look. Buyers like them young. She\u2019s thirty, if she\u2019s a day. She\u2019ll still be worth a good chunk of change, but in our trade a woman past twenty-five is past her prime. And some of those bitches look like hags by thirty. It all depends on how gently they were used.\u201d</p><p>The woman sat still, her gaze fixed on the flames.</p><p>Voshak leaned over and checked her face.</p><p>\u201cTold you,\u201d Pavel said. \u201cNobody\u2019s home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not a bad thing,\u201d Voshak said.</p><p>Richard locked his teeth. It had taken incredible courage to walk into the camp like this, to surrender herself into their physical custody. She had to know what they would do to her. He\u2019d seen the aftermath of what happened to pretty women in slaver camps. They would pass her around and rape her, and he wouldn\u2019t be able to stop them. He would have to watch, helpless. He had seen worse things, but never from inside a cage with his hands tied.</p><p>He wanted to scream and throw himself against the bars, but he couldn\u2019t even move.</p><p>She had to have some sort of a plan. Please, whoever you are above, let her have a plan. Perhaps she planned to wait until they went to sleep and bury a knife in Voshak\u2019s throat. She couldn\u2019t hope to survive after that. Was this a suicide mission?</p><p>Voshak half turned to him and ran his hand down the woman\u2019s back. \u201cFriend of yours, Hunter?\u201d</p><p>Rage boiled inside him. Richard pictured cutting Voshak into pieces. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bet you don\u2019t have any friends, Hunter. Did we kill them all, or are you just an asshole?\u201d</p><p>Magic brushed against him, a subtle, delicate current. Richard forced himself to sit completely still. The magic touched him again, nipping gently on his body, draining him. He focused and felt other currents sliding to wind around the slavers. He followed their source back to the woman. Their stares connected.</p><p>Her face was so placid, but her eyes burned. The woman looked away. The magic current slid away from him to find another victim.</p><p>His magic sensitivity was off the charts\u2014one of the benefits of being born into an old Edger family\u2014but he had no idea what she was planning. Whatever it was, she could use a distraction, and he was the man for the job.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s talk about your friends,\u201d he said, leaning back as casually as his restraints would allow. \u201cJeremy Legs. Chad Gully. Black Nil. Isabel Savage. The Striker Brothers. Angelo Cross. Germaine Coutard. Carmen Sharp. Tempest Wolf. Julius Maganti.\u201d</p><p>Voshak\u2019s face skewed with rage.</p><p>The mysterious magic currents weaved back and forth among the slavers. Anger and fear stamped their faces, but he couldn\u2019t see any adverse effects. The brush of the current that had slid by him was too light to cause any real harm. Maybe she needed more time.</p><p>Richard kept going, hammering each name in.</p><p>\u201cAmbrose Club. Orville Fang. Raoul Baudet. My personal favorite, Jackal Tuline. Where are your friends, Voshak? Or rather, I meant to say \u2018your cronies,\u2019 since a lowlife like you doesn\u2019t have friends. My mistake.\u201d</p><p>The woman stared into the flames. Perhaps her magic wasn\u2019t working.</p><p>Inwardly, Richard swore. He took a risk and provoked the slavers. They glared at him like a pack of mongrel dogs. If he kept aggravating them, he\u2019d be in real danger of getting shot. He had to get out of this damn cage before they killed him and her, and he didn\u2019t have any idea how to do it.</p><p>Richard feigned indifference and shrugged. \u201cDo you want me to keep going? Would you like to know what each of them looked like when they died?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell did we do to you?\u201d Voshak snarled. \u201cDid we rape your wife, did we take your children, what? What the hell is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou trade in human lives, which makes you an aberration. Your kind shouldn\u2019t exist. You\u2019re a wrong, and I decided to correct it. Or perhaps I\u2019m just bored, and you\u2019re stupid and easy to kill.\u201d</p><p>Voshak swore.</p><p>The magic was getting thicker. She was still working on it, whatever it was. He needed to create some strife. As long as they fought among themselves, they wouldn\u2019t pay attention to other, subtler changes. He picked a familiar face. Daryl Long, bad-tempered, neurotic, and jumpy. Perfect.</p><p>\u201cDaryl?\u201d</p><p>The dark-haired, lanky slaver startled.</p><p>\u201cTwo weeks ago, I killed your brother.\u201d</p><p>Daryl recoiled.</p><p>\u201cEvery time I end one of you, I hope for some backbone, but your brother didn\u2019t die like a man. Before I cut his head off, he offered to set you up for me if I let him go. I killed him anyway because there was nothing I needed from him. You see, I know everything already, Daryl. I know about the old man. I know about the barn. I know what the two of you did to him before you slit his throat, and I know why you had to set the fire to the place.\u201d</p><p>Daryl\u2019s meager control snapped. He lunged at the cage. \u201cI\u2019ll kill you. I\u2019ll fucking kill you!\u201d</p><p>Crow swung the butt of his rifle and slammed it into Daryl\u2019s face. The blow knocked him backward. The slaver crashed to the ground, blood drenching his face.</p><p>\u201cNobody touches that bastard!\u201d Voshak thundered. \u201cThe orders are he goes to the Market, and we\u2019ll deliver him there even if I have to blow your brains out.\u201d</p><p>Nobody said anything.</p><p>\u201cWe got him.\u201d Voshak pointed to the cage. \u201cHe\u2019s chained up! All he can do is talk. Let him yap. You touch him, I kill you. Anybody have anything to add?\u201d</p><p>On the left, Pavel, the one who\u2019d started the fire, coughed.</p><p>Voshak spun to him.</p><p>The man next to Pavel coughed, too.</p><p>Pavel coughed again, harder.</p><p>\u201cDo the two of you think this is funny\u2014\u201d The end of the word dissolved into a wet hack. Voshak strained. \u201cWhat the hell?\u201d</p><p>Across the clearing, another slaver coughed, then another and another.</p><p>\u201cAll of you, stop it,\u201d Voshak barked. \u201cI said stop!\u201d</p><p>The coughs died.</p><p>Pavel strained, obviously trying to contain his hacking.</p><p>Voshak pointed his finger at him. \u201cDon\u2019t you do it.\u201d</p><p>Pavel clenched up, gagged, holding it in . . . The cough exploded out of him in a gush of red. Blood burst from his nose and the corners of his mouth. The slaver dropped to all fours, retching. A clump of something wet, soft, and bloody fell out of his mouth.</p><p>Voshak grabbed his gun.</p><p>Across from Pavel, at the other side of the fire, another man collapsed, coughing and bleeding. People gripped their weapons, looking around.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is going on?\u201d Voshak roared. His voice caught, he sneezed and stared at his hand, covered with red mist and tiny chunks of flesh.</p><p>The slavers fell, as if cut down at once by an invisible sickle. Voshak spun, looking left, right, his eyes wild.</p><p>\u201cThe woman,\u201d Crow croaked, dropping to his knees. \u201cThe woman!\u201d</p><p>Voshak whirled to her. She still sat on the log.</p><p>\u201cYou bitch!\u201d The blond slaver lunged at her and fell back, staggering under another fit of coughing.</p><p>Crow struggled upright, raising his rifle.</p><p>A familiar wolfripper hound burst from the bushes and rammed Crow. A rifle shot popped, going wide into the sky. The dog bit into the slaver. Crow screamed once, writhing on the ground, and fell silent. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A stream of translucent darkness flickering with red sparks spiraled around the woman. An identical stream twisted in the opposite direction, winding about her body. She turned slowly to look at Voshak, hacking his lungs out on the ground.</p><p>Richard saw her eyes, and her gaze chilled him all the way to the bone. Power luminesced within her irises.</p><p>The woman rose. The dark streams of her magic widened and collided. The sparks flashed with deep crimson. The streams split into dozens of small tendrils and shot out like striking snakes, biting into the slaver captain.</p> <p>Voshak screamed. His knees gave, and he crumpled to the ground.</p><p>\u201cHelp me!\u201d</p><p>The bodies didn\u2019t move.</p><p>Voshak tried to roll to his feet, but his legs refused to support his weight, and he crashed down, coughing blood. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t answer.</p> <p>Voshak cried out. Tremors wracked his body.</p><p>\u201cDo you want money? I have money!\u201d</p><p>The woman said nothing.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it? What do you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou killed Daisy,\u201d she said. Her hoarse voice trembled with barely contained anger. \u201cYou murdered \u00c9l\u00e9onore.\u201d</p><p>So his memory of Rose\u2019s grandmother wasn\u2019t a dream or hallucination. Regret washed over Richard. Indirectly or not, he\u2019d caused another casualty. The boys would be heartbroken.</p> <p>He put it away, in the same place he put his guilt for the other things he had done.</p><p>Voshak squirmed on the ground. \u201cI hate you. I fucking hate you. I\u2019d do it again. I should\u2019ve killed that skinny bitch, too.\u201d</p><p>A tendril of dark magic streaked from her, stinging the slaver captain. He shuddered, gurgling.</p><p>\u201c\u00c9l\u00e9onore was like a mother to me. You cut a hole in my life. You murdered a young woman. She had her whole life ahead of her. You just ended it, and now her sister will have to live with her death,\u201d the woman said, her face iced over. \u201cI want you to understand how much suffering you\u2019ve caused. I want you to hurt before you die.\u201d</p><p>Voshak flailed, as if she had whipped him.</p><p>She watched, her pain plain on her face. Richard wondered why she didn\u2019t prolong the torture for the rest of the slavers. Considering the circumstances, instant death was a mercy.</p><p>Voshak drew one last shuddering breath and lay still. The odor of putrescence flooded the clearing. Nausea choked Richard. Voshak\u2019s body began to decompose.</p><p>The dark currents of magic shrunk, once mighty dragons, and now just pet snakes, sliding over the woman\u2019s skin.</p> <p>She stepped forward. The chain from the shackle around her ankle pulled at Voshak\u2019s leg. The slaver\u2019s bones fell apart, rotting flesh rolling off them, and suddenly she wasn\u2019t chained to anyone. She walked toward him, picking her way among the bodies, beautiful and terrifying, like an angel of death.</p><p>She reached his cage.</p><p>They looked at each other through the bars.</p><p>Her eyes were just as he remembered: luminescent with power and heartbreakingly beautiful, but this time he saw no concern in their depths. His cage had changed owners. Whether it was for the better remained to be seen.</p><p>Richard weighed his options. One of three things would happen: she could kill him; she could walk away, letting him die slowly; or she could let him out. If he had any hope of getting out of this mess alive, he had to talk her down. He had to survive and finish what he started.</p><p>The dark currents of her magic licked the bars of the cage, sparking with red on the metal. Richard braced himself. He could tell by her eyes that whether he left this cage a free man or died of starvation and thirst inside it depended on what he\u2019d say next.</p><p>THEY were dead. All of them. It had felt so unbelievably good to experience their dying. The darkness sang inside her, triumphant, while the rest of her trembled, repulsed and terrified. She was painfully aware of the corpses littering the clearing behind her.</p><p>It had taken all of her will to sit quietly and siphon off their life force, weakening their bodies and building up her own reserves. She\u2019d thought it was the only way to kill them all at once and quickly. Finally, she had infected them and used their own magic to feed the disease within them. They felt nothing until the magically accelerated disease finally bloomed and severed their lives in a few painful instants. They didn\u2019t deserve mercy, but she didn\u2019t want their suffering as much as she wanted their lives. They couldn\u2019t be allowed to continue, and so she ended them fast.</p><p>All except their leader. Something had compelled her to kill him slowly. She\u2019d monitored his body, as it surrendered to the disease, and the feeling of intense satiation that came over her as he lay there dying terrified Charlotte to the very core of her being. She had to cut it short and kill him before she began to revel in his pain.</p><p>The magic pulled on her even now, whispering into her mind, begging her to continue. She locked the magic in the cage of her will, forcing it to subside. She had broken her oath as a healer, but she wasn\u2019t a mindless abomination. Not yet. She could still hold it in check.</p><p>Richard leaned closer to the bars of the cage, his long, dark hair falling over his face. She almost took a step back.</p><p>His color was good, Charlotte noted. Stable vital signs. His body was strong and fit but still, he was recovering with surprising speed. His face was muddy and bruised, and the stench of old urine rose from his clothes. The thugs had tried to batter and debase him, but it made no difference. He refused to notice it, the way most people made a conscious decision to ignore light rain when they were in a hurry. He wasn\u2019t humiliated. He wasn\u2019t cowed or beaten down. A calculating mind looked at her through his eyes. He was like an old wolf on a chain, lethal, cunning, restrained for the time being but biding his time. Danger rolled off him. In her years as a healer, Charlotte had treated many threatening people: soldiers, agents, spies. Her instincts warned her to stay away from him.</p><p>Richard opened his mouth.</p><p>Her pulse spiked in alarm.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re real,\u201d he said.</p><p>What? \u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I woke up in the cage, I thought I dreamt you.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t sure what to make of it. \u201cYou were delirious when we met.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you heal me?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>She forced herself to sit down on a pile of bags on the ground. The slaver dog trotted over and lay by her feet between her and the cage. Richard raised his eyebrows.</p><p>\u201c\u00c9l\u00e9onore is dead,\u201d she said. \u201cThey killed her, and they killed a young woman, Daisy. Then they set my house on fire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said.</p><p>There was an unexpected sincerity in his voice.</p><p>\u201cYou brought this nightmare on me,\u201d she said.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI did. It wasn\u2019t my intention, but the responsibility is mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to know why. Why did they do this to us?\u201d</p><p>Richard shifted in the cage. His hands were tied behind his back. It must hurt, Charlotte realized.</p><p>\u201cThese men are slavers. They raid the isolated settlements in the Weird and the Edge and sometimes even in the Broken. They kidnap men and women, and deliver them to the coast to the secret meeting points, where ships pick them up. From there, the captives are taken to the Market, a hidden auction house where they are sold off to the highest bidder. Slavery has been outlawed for three hundred years, but they prosper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow? If slavery is illegal . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe border barons always need fodder for construction and armies. Mine owners use slave labor. The magic users who tangle with outlawed applications of magic theory buy subjects for their experiments. And others, well, when you see a rich man with a young, beautiful woman on his arm, would it occur to you to ask if she was free?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s barbaric.\u201d</p><p>Richard\u2019s eyes turned hard. \u201cYou would be surprised how many \u2018servants\u2019 come from the Market.\u201d</p><p>He was right. It would never have occurred to her to ask anyone if their attendants were slaves. She simply assumed they weren\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cThe slavers feed their own legends,\u201d he said. \u201cThey dress in black, they arm themselves with wolfripper dogs, they ride dark horses. They appear from nowhere in the middle of the night, reap their human harvest, burn the settlements to the ground, and vanish like ghosts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike a night terror,\u201d she said. Bastards.</p><p>Richard nodded. \u201cThey want to be the stuff of nightmares because fighting one\u2019s fear is always harder than fighting another man. They see themselves as outside the law, as wolves who prey on sheep. Most of them didn\u2019t amount to much, and they cling to their illusions of grandeur both because they have nothing else and because they find cruelty empowering. So if you wish an honest answer, here it is. They killed \u00c9l\u00e9onore and Daisy, and burned your house because that\u2019s what they do. It wasn\u2019t personal or planned. They didn\u2019t give it a second thought. They simply did it because that\u2019s the way they do business. Other people\u2019s lives matter to them not at all. They\u2019re slavers.\u201d</p><p>His words only fueled her rage. \u201cAnd you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hunt the slavers. I\u2019ve killed dozens over the past months. They think themselves wolves, so they call me Hunter. They\u2019re not fond of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can see that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI made a mistake, and they finally caught me. They were taking me to the Market for a public execution.\u201d</p><p>That explained things. The slavers had beaten him not to hurt him\u2014he was unconscious\u2014but to make him less frightening. They were terrified of him. If they were the night terrors, he was their legendary killer, and when you kill a legend, you must make it as public as possible, or it might not take.</p><p>\u201cAre there more of them?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cMany more.\u201d Richard grimaced. \u201cNo matter how many I kill, there are always more.\u201d</p><p>Many more. That meant many more dead Daisies and \u00c9l\u00e9onores, many more Tulips, weeping over bodies. Many people like her, left with a gaping hole ripped in their lives, not sure how to pick up the pieces and move on. Her magic seethed within her. Her body was nearing exhaustion, but she wanted to scream in outrage. Why did this go on? Who allowed this to keep happening? Did they think nobody could stop them? Because she could, and she had, and she would do it again. It wasn\u2019t finished. She wasn\u2019t finished. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cTell me more,\u201d Charlotte said.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cNot through the bars of the cage.\u201d</p><p>She leaned back. \u201cI\u2019m not sure it\u2019s a good idea to let you out. I don\u2019t know what you might do.\u201d</p> <p>His eyes met hers. \u201cMy lady, I assure you, I\u2019m not a danger to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSays the Hunter of wolves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou view me as dangerous, but you allow a slaver dog with bloody teeth to lay by your feet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve known the dog longer than you.\u201d</p><p>He grinned at her. \u201c\u2018Can two people ever truly know each other through the bars of the human cage?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Charlotte blinked. He\u2019d quoted the Prisoner\u2019s Ballad, a work that was considered to be one of the pinnacles of Adrianglian literature. She was sitting on some dirty bags in the middle of a clearing filled with corpses, and a man who, by his own admission, was a serial killer just quoted a philosophical masterpiece to her. This had to be some sort of surreal absurd dream.</p><p>\u201cI can simply walk away and leave you in the cage,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you will,\u201d Richard said.</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you so sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou healed me,\u201d he said. \u201cI remember your eyes. You wouldn\u2019t sentence a man to slow death.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d called her bluff. Leaving him to starve to death was beyond her now, no matter how dangerous he was. \u201cIf I open this cage, you\u2019ll answer my questions.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAs honestly as is in my power.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBefore I let you out, typhus, malaria, red death, Ebola, tuberculosis . . . Do you have any preference? I have others, as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d Richard asked.</p><p>\u201cI carry dormant samples of them within my body. To cure a disease, you must first understand it, and sometimes a deliberate infection is necessary for vaccination. If you attempt to attack me, I will end you, Richard. Look around you if you have any doubts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll strive to keep it from slipping my mind.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte rose. The white-haired slaver was the leader. He would likely have the key. She crouched by his body\u2014it smelled awful\u2014and searched his clothes, briskly turning out his pockets. Money, bullets . . . \u201cNo key.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, but we don\u2019t have to have one,\u201d Richard said. \u201cI only need a knife and free hands.\u201d</p><p>She pulled a blade from the sheath on the slaver\u2019s waist, reached between the bars, and sawed through the tough cord binding his wrists. The rope snapped. He rolled his shoulders and held out his hand.</p> <p>She might regret this, but she couldn\u2019t just leave him in the cage. Charlotte put the blade into his hand. Richard flipped it. She felt magic flow toward the blade. It drained from his body onto the metal, stretching in a thin glowing line of pale white along the edge.</p><p>Richard sliced at the chain wrapped around his feet.</p><p>The metal fell apart.</p><p>She\u2019d seen concentrated flash sever a body before but never metal. Not like this.</p><p>He struck at the chain securing the cage\u2019s door, and it crashed to the ground. Richard pushed the door open, slid out, and swayed, catching himself on the wagon. She hadn\u2019t realized how tall he was, almost six inches taller than she. Charlotte waited for him to sit down, but he remained standing. It was an obvious strain.</p><p>Then the light dawned on her. She sat back on the bags, and Richard sank to the ground as well, leaning against the wagon wheel. Ridiculous. Richard might not have been a blueblood, but he behaved like one, and the ingrained manners of the Weird wouldn\u2019t permit him to take a seat if she was standing.</p><p>\u201cYou had questions?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cTell me about your involvement with the slavers,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cAre you familiar with the Marshall of the Southern provinces?\u201d Richard asked.</p><p>\u201cEarl Declan Camarine? Rose\u2019s husband,\u201d Charlotte said. \u201c\u00c9l\u00e9onore spoke of him quite often. I never met him in person, but I do know of the family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Office of the Marshall of the Southern Provinces has fought slavery for years,\u201d Richard said. \u201cUnsuccessfully. The slavers have an elaborate organization, and the slaver crews like this one are just the lowest rung of it. The slavers employ shippers, accountants, brokers, and guards. The list goes on. In the last decade, the Marshall of the Southern Provinces has led several operations against the slavers and failed. Somehow, they knew exactly when and where he would strike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone is protecting them,\u201d Charlotte guessed.</p><p>\u201cSomeone highly placed and well connected, with access to the inner workings of the Ministry of State. A little over a year ago, Declan invited me in for a conversation. Declan needed someone on the outside, a man who could act without the constraints of his office. He asked me if I would be that man, and I agreed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Richard paused. His eyes grew darker. \u201cMy family is from the Edge. I have my own motivations to want the slavers dead. Suffice it to say that my reasons are highly compelling.\u201d</p><p>There was trauma there, she could sense it. Some great injustice had been done to Richard. She wanted to know what drove him, but his eyes told her that was the one question he wouldn\u2019t answer. And Sophie, whoever she was, had to be a part of it.</p><p>\u201cI spent eight months collecting information and gathering people I could trust and another four pursuing the slavers. I studied them, then I killed them. I slaughtered them in the open against overwhelming odds. I killed them in their sleep. I destroyed their camps. Four slaver captains are dead by my hand. It made no difference. They simply recruit more thugs. I knew I had to climb up their food chain and sever the head of the organization. And for that, I needed to find their Market, where the kidnapped are sold. During my latest raid, I obtained a map. It\u2019s the record of where the slaver ships are landing, but the map is in code, and I couldn\u2019t break the cipher. I needed the key.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that how you ended up in the cage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bargained with a man and fell into a trap,\u201d Richard said. \u201cIt was a miscalculation, and I won\u2019t repeat it. They chased me, and I ran. I knew the Edge was my best chance. Unfortunately, I was too delirious to know where I was going or to deliver a warning when I got there.\u201d</p><p>He leaned forward and bowed his head. It was a bow that would\u2019ve been a credit to any blueblood lord. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I brought this on you. I will make them pay. It\u2019s all I can offer you.\u201d</p><p>He was about to end this conversation and leave, taking her chance to matter with him. No. No, she wouldn\u2019t stand for it. The wounds inside her were too raw, the memory of the fire too fresh. \u201cNot all,\u201d Charlotte said. \u201cI\u2019m coming with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s out of the question,\u201d he said.</p><p>She gathered herself and looked down on him with all of the haughtiness her upbringing could provide. \u201cYou mistake me, my lord. I\u2019m not asking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy apologies. In that case, I should advise you that I don\u2019t respond favorably to threats.\u201d</p><p>The dog raised his head and bared his teeth.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not my enemy,\u201d Charlotte said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to kill you, Richard. I want to end this.\u201d She pointed to the cage behind him.</p><p>He sighed, and for the first time, she saw the signs of weariness in his face.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps, I should explain further. I mentioned that I needed a cipher key.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJackal Tuline, one of the slaver undercaptains, had a sister. A month ago, she was serving drinks at a tavern. Voshak bashed her over the head with a bottle and forced himself on her in full view of a dozen witnesses. He flattened her nose and dislocated her jaw. I\u2019ve seen her personally, and the woman is almost unrecognizable. The experience left her deeply damaged, and her face is the least of her injuries.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte glanced at the decomposing corpse. He wouldn\u2019t force himself on anyone again. That knowledge filled her with a frightening, savage joy.</p><p>\u201cThe word on the street said Tuline wanted revenge but was too afraid to take Voshak on directly. I approached him and offered him a chance to get even. We bargained.\u201d</p><p>His voice dripped with derision, as if he were describing swimming through sewage.</p><p>\u201cWe came to an agreement. He would sell me the cipher, and I would see to Voshak\u2019s death. When I met Tuline in the woods to deliver the payment, six of his men ambushed me.\u201d Richard smiled. It was a hard, humorless grin. \u201cTuline took a few moments to astonish me with his cleverness. He had deliberately engineered the rape of his own sister.\u201d Richard paused. \u201cHe thought this plan up, talked it over with Voshak, then he did it. All to draw me out. The level of depravity is mind-boggling.\u201d</p><p>It made her want to retch. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI left him in two pieces.\u201d Richard leaned forward. \u201cWhen Declan came to me with this proposal, he told me that this mission would consume me\u2014and it has. He chose me for many reasons, in large part because I have nothing to lose. My family doesn\u2019t need me now. My wife left me. I\u2019m childless.\u201d</p><p>An old pain stirred in her. She was childless, too. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>He paused, momentarily off-balance. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>An awkward silence stretched between them.</p><p>Richard cleared his throat. \u201cI chose this road deliberately, and when I started, I thought I was worldly. I wasn\u2019t. I\u2019ve seen atrocities along the way that would horrify most people, and I committed some because I had to be as ruthless as my enemy. There is no room for mercy or compassion in this quest, and there is no turning back. It changes you, and should I survive, I\u2019m not certain that I\u2019ll be capable of normal life. Make no mistake, my lady. I\u2019m a monster. Don\u2019t follow me. It\u2019s a one-way trip. Sane, kind people aren\u2019t meant to take it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about mass murderers?\u201d she asked. \u201cWhat\u2019s the policy for us?\u201d</p><p>Richard shook his head. \u201cGo home, my lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy home is burned to the ground.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThese people are ruthless, cruel thugs. Think of what you must become to hunt them.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t understand. \u201cLook around you,\u201d she said softly. \u201cI came to the Edge to hide from my magic. I ran because I have an obligation as a healer to contain it and prevent it from hurting anyone. I needed to be someplace where my power was weakened and nobody knew me. Someone had injured me, and I wasn\u2019t sure I could hold my emotions in check and not seek revenge. I came to the Edge alone, and I had nearly starved to death when \u00c9l\u00e9onore found me. She saved me, Richard. I rebuilt my life. I was content and this\u201d\u2014she indicated the corpses with the sweep of her hand\u2014\u201chad fallen dormant. And then they killed her, and they killed Daisy.\u201d</p><p>Her voice snapped, and she swallowed. \u201cShe was only twenty-three, Richard. Twenty-three. She had barely started her life, and they crushed her and ripped out her sister\u2019s heart. Every time I close my eyes, I see Tulip wailing over her sister\u2019s body. I can\u2019t undo it. I can\u2019t just let it go.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou have to try,\u201d he said. \u201cVengeance will eat you alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not about vengeance.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cIt\u2019s about stopping them. You\u2019re trying to warn me about the road, but I\u2019m already walking it. Have you heard of the Healer\u2019s oath?\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2018I swear to hold the human body sacred,\u2019\u201d he quoted. \u201c\u2018I will apply all my effort, all my magic, and all my knowledge of procedure and remedy to preserve life, to treat malady, to ease suffering. I swear to knowingly do no harm through the use of my magic or craft. I will prescribe no remedy when none is needed. I will not seek to improve on Nature\u2019s design for the sake of vanity, knowledge, or human passion.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne of my relatives was a certified Physician,\u201d Richard said.</p> <p>\u201cThere is more,\u201d she said. \u201c\u2018Should I break this vow through my ignorance, I will surrender myself to the mercy of my peers. I will accept their judgment and my dishonor, and should they convict me, I will cease to practice medicine. Should I break this vow by deliberate action, I will know that I have betrayed myself. I will have drowned my teachers in guilt and cast doubt and suspicion upon my students. Let my name be a bitter taste on the lips of those who knew me, let my countenance be that of dishonor, let me fade into nothingness and be forgotten, save as an example of failure and weakness, for I would become an abomination in the eyes of the world.\u2019\u201d</p><p>He waited.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a certified healer from the Ganer College. Today I killed human beings through the use of my magic. I did it willingly.\u201d The words tasted foul on her tongue. \u201cMy life is over. Do you understand? I sacrificed everything I was so I could do this because it\u2019s my responsibility as a peer of the realm and a human being to destroy this human cancer before it hurts anyone else.\u201d</p><p>She pointed to the dead bodies. They lay there, silent and accusing, evidence of her fall from grace.</p><p>Charlotte turned to Richard. \u201cI own the consequences of my deeds. I have nothing to lose. I need your knowledge and expertise, but I\u2019ll keep going, with you or without, and I won\u2019t stop until the slave trade is broken. You can benefit from this alliance, as can I. Think what an asset I can be. Don\u2019t let my sacrifice be wasted.\u201d</p><p>RICHARD leaned back. She was looking at him, waiting for an answer.</p> <p>He had done his best to persuade her to leave, but everything about her, from the coldness in her eyes to her wary posture, convinced him she would not. He had no idea who she was. He only knew that they had the same purpose.</p><p>She was beautiful and radiant. He remembered the concern in her eyes. The same concern drove her now, pushing her toward acts of violence. On the surface, he\u2019d be a fool to turn her down. She was driven by tragedy, just like him, and she would be incorruptible, just like him. He needed a blade to kill, but she could kill dozens at once empty-handed. She was Death, and she had just asked to be his ally.</p><p>Walking next to him would break her. He\u2019d fought so hard to spare Sophie from this grisly soul-eating burden. He couldn\u2019t bring himself to say yes to this woman.</p><p>\u201cHow often can you do this?\u201d He pointed at the corpses, delaying his need to answer.</p><p>She frowned. \u201cThe process is complicated. When I healed you, I used the reserves of my own body to speed your regeneration. When I injure, the method is similar. It takes very little magic to introduce a pathogen to the body, but to make it kill with unnatural quickness requires a lot of power and control. To kill this many, I infected them all, then siphoned off the natural life force of their bodies until I was overflowing with it. There is a high degree of risk: had I poured too much of myself into the process, I would\u2019ve died, but I am very angry, and I\u2019ve never killed with my magic before, so I took the chance. Given ample rest and the right circumstances, I can do this again tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you risk it without rest?\u201d Richard asked.</p><p>\u201cIf the incentive was high enough,\u201d she said.</p><p>So she valued her goal higher than her life. He would have to take that into account. She was likely to overextend herself on her own.</p> <p>\u201cWhat about doing this on a smaller, individual scale?\u201d</p><p>The woman shrugged. \u201cInfecting a single target is much easier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you still capable of healing?\u201d</p><p>She reached over and drew her hand across his cheek, letting the tiny golden sparks penetrate his skin. The ache in his face dissolved.</p><p>\u201cDoes the bruise still hurt?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d It was in his best interests to keep his mouth shut, but he couldn\u2019t help himself. \u201cWhat you do . . . it\u2019s a gift. Reconsider.\u201d</p><p>Bitterness dripped from her voice. \u201cToo late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you able to control your magic? Can you rein it in?\u201d Richard had to account for all possible contingencies.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat I do requires a very deliberate intent and concentration. I won\u2019t be infecting you in my sleep because I had a nightmare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have any family? Anyone who could be used to compel you to do something against your will?\u201d Anyone he could use to talk her out of this madness.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have any enemies?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Elvei Leremine, my ex-husband. He\u2019s terrified of me and will take every opportunity to obtain revenge. Also, by using my art and magic to murder, I\u2019ve broken the healer\u2019s oath. If I\u2019m discovered by the realm, Adrianglia will execute me. If you don\u2019t want this to happen, the use of my magic must be more covert.\u201d</p><p>He was running out of questions.</p><p>\u201cThere is one more thing you should be aware of,\u201d she said. \u201cI can\u2019t heal myself. If I\u2019m injured, I\u2019ll have to recover by normal means unless we can find another healer.\u201d</p><p>She had committed herself to it. She would embark on this path with or without him, but her chances of survival were much higher if he took her with him. She had great power, but she was vulnerable. This time she got lucky. If he abandoned her now, eventually she would walk into the wrong camp. It would take just one man to shoot her dead or knock her unconscious. She had saved him twice, once from the wound and the second time from the cage. No matter how much he didn\u2019t want to witness her transformation into someone like him, he owed it to her to safeguard her.</p><p>Richard held out his hand. \u201cLast chance to turn back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She put her hand into his.</p><p>\u201cThese are my terms. You will accept my authority. If I say to wait in a certain place, you will wait. If I say to kill someone, you will kill them. You understand that your life is secondary to our cause. If your compassion jeopardizes our mission, I may not be in a position to be merciful. If you choose to hinder me, I\u2019ll cut you down.\u201d</p><p>He waited, hoping he\u2019d scared her off.</p><p>Her face showed no hesitation. \u201cAgreed.\u201d</p><p>They shook.</p><p>\u201cMy name is Richard Mar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCharlotte de Ney,\u201d she said with a sigh.</p><p>A noble title. She had mentioned she had one, but even if she didn\u2019t, he would have known simply by the way she held herself. Blood itself, noble or no, didn\u2019t confer any special benefits. He was living proof of that\u2014an Edger mongrel, yet he could and had passed for a blueblood many times. But he had years of education, and he recognized in Charlotte the grace and poise that training imparts.</p><p>Propriety dictated that he should let go of her hand. He did, although he didn\u2019t want to.</p><p>\u201cWe start with the bodies,\u201d Richard said. \u201cVoshak should carry a copy of the cipher. One more thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d She raised her eyebrows.</p><p>\u201cThe dog.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t possibly mean to take him with us.\u201d</p><p>She raised her eyebrows at him.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a wolfripper. Born and bred to hunt wolves, and since he was owned by the slavers, he was trained to hunt men. You\u2019re looking at 170 pounds of cunning and vicious predator.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so glad you think he\u2019s smart.\u201d Charlotte smiled at the dog. \u201cThe dog stays, Richard.\u201d</p><p>He sighed.</p><p>Charlotte pushed herself up from the pile of bags. He read exhaustion in the slump of her shoulders. Her magic had come at a cost. He decided not to argue.</p><p>\u201cAs you wish.\u201d Richard handed her his knife. \u201cWe have some corpses to strip. It\u2019s easier to cut pockets than rummage through them. We may have to ride hard once we find what we\u2019re looking for. Can you do it?\u201d</p><p>Charlotte raised her head, her gaze regal and proud. \u201cOf course I can.\u201d</p><p>FOUR</p><p>JEANS definitely had their advantages, Charlotte decided. For one, they provided a nice protection for one\u2019s thighs when in a saddle. Unfortunately, they did nothing for the ache in her core muscles. It had been two and a half years since she had last ridden a horse, and although her posture and balance were still good, after eight hours, her inner hip muscles and her butt had turned into painful mush. The reality of expending so much magic so quickly had crashed into her a while ago. Her head felt fuzzy. Her eyes wanted to close. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAlmost there,\u201d Richard murmured.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. Please don\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><p>Considering that he was near death less than twenty-four hours ago, of the two of them she was in much better shape.</p> <p>They rode side by side on the Salino-Kelena Adrianglian highway. Around them tall oaks dripped long beards of moss. The day had long since burned down to night, and the moon shone from the sky, drenching the road in silver light. Darkness hid between the tree trunks. Strange noises came from within the woods: a deep guttural grunting, followed by the distant snarls of a predator, the high-pitched squeaking of some rodent, and the eerie hooting of the great twilight owls trying to flush out their prey. Somewhere between the shrubs, the dog glided, silent despite his bulk.</p><p>They had searched Voshak\u2019s bags and found the cipher and another map, hidden in the false bottom of his canteen. Richard translated it while she chose the best horses and searched for useful weapons. The map indicated a pickup point just north of Kelena, a large harbor city. The map gave a specific date and time, eleven o\u2019clock, evening, the day after next. The moment they had finished gathering supplies and Richard finished stuffing some of the more outlandish pieces of leather into their saddlebags, they had ridden out.</p><p>Richard slowed his horse.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy wound is aching,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Her magic told her that his wound was no worse than it had been hours ago. He was giving her an opportunity to rest, and she was too tired and too grateful to fight him on it. Still, she had to. \u201cI appreciate it, but please don\u2019t make allowances for my sake. I\u2019ll manage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re only a few miles away,\u201d he said. \u201cHave you ever been to Kelena?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is a noisy, garish hive of a city. We\u2019ll be walking into the Cauldron, one of the most dangerous neighborhoods in Adrianglia. They call it the Cauldron because that\u2019s where the worst humanity has to offer is thrown together and allowed to boil until the scum floats to the top.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte laughed softly. She hadn\u2019t thought she would ever laugh again after what she had done, but her body had passed the point of pain, and she felt weightless and disconnected. \u201cYou\u2019ve missed your calling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a complete failure as a poet,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I was fourteen, I wrote a long ballad about the bleakness of my life and the heaviness of the burden that was being me. My brother stole it and read it out loud at a family gathering. That was the first and the last time I managed to make the entire family laugh.\u201d</p> <p>The laugher kept coming. She heard the hysterical tone in her own voice but couldn\u2019t stop it.</p><p>Richard halted his horse and dismounted.</p><p>The back of her eyes grew hot. She had to get ahold of herself.</p><p>Richard took her reins and led their horses off the road. She slid out of her saddle, her body whining in protest. Her limbs were shaking. A big poplar loomed in front of her. Charlotte circled it and sat on the ground, wrapping her arms around her legs and gathering herself into a ball the way she used to do when she was a homesick little girl.</p><p>It was all over. If you were more grounded, you\u2019d sprout roots, Charlotte. She wasn\u2019t grounded anymore. All of her trials, all of her self-imposed exile, all of it had been for nothing. She murdered people. She held their lives in her hands and snuffed them out. It brought her joy. And \u00c9l\u00e9onore was dead, and there wasn\u2019t a damn thing Charlotte could do about it. \u00c9l\u00e9onore was gone, and she must\u2019ve suffered before she died. I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m so sorry.</p><p>Charlotte bit her lower lip, trying to hold back the flood.</p><p>Oh Dawn Mother. How did it all go so wrong? Please, she prayed silently, please, please make this all into a nightmare. Please let me wake. I just want to wake up. Please . . . She would have given anything to turn back the last twenty-four hours. Anything to keep \u00c9l\u00e9onore and Daisy from dying. Anything to shield Tulip. Poor Tulip. She was all alone now. The slavers wrecked her life. One moment she had a sister and a future, and the next she had nothing, only grief.</p><p>The warmth behind her eyes turned into tears. They rolled, wetting her cheeks. Her chest hurt. She sobbed. Suddenly, she couldn\u2019t hold it any longer. The tears tore out of her.</p> <p>A dark shadow emerged from the bushes. The dog lowered himself on the ground by her feet and licked her ankle. She slumped over her bent knees and cried like a child.</p><p>Please. Please let me wake up.</p><p>She cried and cried, praying in her head even though she knew nobody heard her. It was godsdamned unfair. Why? Why did they have to die? She\u2019d killed the bastards who killed them, but it didn\u2019t make things right. It was just a circle of pain and death, and she was trapped in it, angry, grieving, and helpless.</p><p>The sobs turned into dry heaves. There was no balm, no poultice, no pills she could create to make things better. Dead would remain dead. Nothing could take back their suffering or hers.</p><p>Finally, even her dry heaves died. Exhaustion smothered her.</p><p>She felt alone. So utterly, completely alone. She raised her head, straightening, and realized that fabric was touching her shoulders. Richard had draped his cloak over her. She hadn\u2019t even noticed.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d She pulled the cloak tighter around herself. It was a kind gesture, completely at odds with his confession of being a killer and the air of danger that still emanated from him.</p><p>He was sitting next to her, leaning against the rough bark, his profile etched against the moonlit sky. Had she met him under different circumstances, she might have felt fear at his proximity. Now she was too numb and too beat-up emotionally to muster any anxiety.</p><p>\u201cI suppose you\u2019re regretting bringing me along,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve regretted it from the moment I decided to do it.\u201d</p><p>Her pride was stung. \u201cI won\u2019t be a burden.\u201d</p><p>He turned to her, dark eyes filled with concern. \u201cI never viewed you as a burden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why?\u201d</p><p>He looked up to the moon. \u201cIn this life, some of us are killers, born with a predatory instinct. I\u2019m one, but you\u2019re not.\u201d</p><p>He must\u2019ve forgotten she had just murdered a dozen men. \u201cWhy? Is it because I\u2019m a woman?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s nothing so obvious as gender. My aunt was the best killer I\u2019ve met. For whatever reason, some of us are born to kill, and others, men and women both, are born to nurture. Your instincts drive you to help others. My instincts drive me to end lives.\u201d</p><p>She sniffed. \u201cYou don\u2019t know me.\u201d</p><p>Richard smiled. Despite the dirt, he really was a strikingly handsome man. Arrogant, predatory, but handsome.</p><p>\u201cThose of us who are killers learn to recognize others of our kind. We know rivals because they pose danger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I don\u2019t?\u201d Charlotte asked quietly.</p><p>He smiled again, and this time his face was almost mournful. \u201cEven the most peaceful and kind person will become dangerous if backed into a corner. I don\u2019t question your power, but you don\u2019t have the innate aggression or the predatory drive of a natural-born killer. I\u2019ve been one all of my life, and what I\u2019ve done and seen during these past months haunts me. I know what lies ahead. I know it will be very difficult for you. You think now that you\u2019re dealing with grief and purging it from yourself, but it\u2019s only the first taste of what\u2019s to come. Are you sure you don\u2019t want to return? I would consider it an honor to escort you to the Edge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think the Edgers wouldn\u2019t take you back?\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cThey would, but I can\u2019t go back to East Laporte. When the slavers surrounded the house, \u00c9l\u00e9onore called me. I drove to our neighbors to ask for help. They gathered about twenty people together, all carrying guns, then they stood around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNobody wanted to fight,\u201d Richard said. \u201cThey probably delayed until the slavers were gone. Typical.\u201d</p><p>She turned to him. \u201cYes. \u00c9l\u00e9onore lived among them all of her life. She helped many of them, and they just abandoned her and left her to die. And when I asked them for help to go after those bastards, not one of them would meet my eyes. I can\u2019t go back there. I\u2019ve made my decision. I don\u2019t know what your motivations are, but mine are just as valid. Please respect my need for justice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy apologies,\u201d he said. \u201cI won\u2019t mention it again.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte wiped her face with her sleeve and rose. Richard got up.</p><p>She held out his cloak. \u201cThank you for your cloak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy pleasure.\u201d</p><p>Richard held her horse\u2019s reins while she put her foot in the stirrup and mounted. He handed them to her, got into his saddle, and they rode out.</p><p>Half an hour later, the forest parted. Charlotte halted her horse. A wide field of waist-tall grass spread in front of her, rolling into the distance, where a nacre sea lapped at the shore under a bottomless dark sky. To the left, bathed in the salt water of the ocean, rose impossibly tall towers. Built of pale gray stone, they were triangular in shape, smoothly curved at the corners. A turquoise metal wave tipped each tower, sending rivulets of metal down the pale stone sides, like climbing plants that had sprouted a network of thin roots. The moonlight played on the metal, and its gleam matched the reflections on the placid ocean. The towers stood in a perfect semicircle, enclosing most of the city, like wave breakers.</p><p>\u201cKelena\u2019s Teeth,\u201d Richard said. \u201cDuring hurricanes the towers send out a magic barrier, shielding the city from the storms and the worst of the surge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt looks as if the city is halfway in the water.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout a third. There are canals running all through the city, so when the tide rises, the water simply passes through Kelena into the salt marshes. All that grass is deceptive. That\u2019s not solid ground under it, it\u2019s marsh flats with a thin layer of water over mud. An ideal home for horned turtles. They grow to five feet wide and can snap a human femur in half with their jaws. Fortunately, they are slow and rarely venture on the road. Shall we?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Charlotte nodded and they trotted down the highway toward the city. She could see between the towers now, and from her vantage point in the saddle, the interior of the city looked like a mess of roofs, balconies, and bright, frayed banners. A human hive, just as Richard had described it: messy, chaotic, filled with strangers. A vague anxiety rose in her. From here, the city appeared too large, too full of people. While at the College, she had dreamt of traveling, but once she left it, the marriage and the house had taken precedence.</p><p>Now she was riding toward this teeming city through the night, accompanied by a man born between the worlds who cut steel with his sword and had flawless manners. It felt surreal.</p><p>\u201cMy brother says the Broken has a city in this exact same spot. According to him, its citizens have an unhealthy fascination with pirates,\u201d Richard said.</p> <p>She found his voice strangely reassuring. \u201cThe same brother who stole your ballad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSadly, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does he do?\u201d she asked to keep the conversation going.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s an agent of the Mirror.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte turned to him. \u201cHe is a spy?\u201d The Mirror was Adrianglia\u2019s intelligence and espionage agency, the realm\u2019s main weapon in its cold war with the neighboring Dukedom of Louisiana. It operated in the shadows, and the exploits of its agents were legendary.</p> <p>Richard grimaced. \u201cHe steals anything that\u2019s not nailed down, cons people into going along with his improbable schemes, and possesses a unique talent that lets him win when he gambles. It was the Mirror or a prison cell.\u201d</p><p>His distaste had a false, put-upon quality about it. \u201cYou\u2019re proud of him,\u201d she said.</p><p>A narrow smile lit Richard\u2019s face. \u201cExtremely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never been to the Broken,\u201d she told him. \u201cI tried, but my magic was too strong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither have I,\u201d he said. \u201cI also tried to cross and nearly died. The Edge is my limit. I would love to see the Broken.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would, too.\u201d</p> <p>The Broken\u2019s gadgets fascinated her. Some, like microwave ovens, had their equivalent in the Weird, but others, like plastic wrap and cell phones, were completely new to her. When she had received de Ney manor, she had climbed into the attic. It was filled with strange things from the previous owners\u2019 travels, and she loved to sort through their abandoned treasures. Each item was a little discovery, wrapped in echoes of adventure. She felt the exact same way about the swap meets she\u2019d gone to in the Edge. She rarely bought things, but accompanying \u00c9l\u00e9onore on one of her treasure hunts was an experience in itself. \u00c9l\u00e9onore would find some strange gadget from the Broken, and her face would light up.</p><p>Grief stabbed her. Charlotte stared ahead at the city. She would make them stop. They would regret the day they ever came to East Laporte.</p><p>\u201cDo we have a plan?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cThe slaver ship docks tomorrow night,\u201d Richard said. \u201cThey will expect a crew of at least ten men and a group of slaves, usually twelve to fifteen, typically adolescents and young adults. If they don\u2019t see that on the shore, the ship may not dock. It\u2019s imperative we get on that ship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it goes to the slave market?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. The slavers are run by a board of trustees, like a business. The individual slaver captains don\u2019t know who the trustees are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou seem very sure of that,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cOnce you hang a man over an open fire, he usually answers your questions honestly,\u201d Richard said. \u201cThe slavers don\u2019t know the identity of the trustees, but they do know that once the slaves board the ships, they are taken to an island. There are sixty-seven islands along the Adrianglian coast. The slaves are sold at the market, and the sales are recorded and presided over by a bookkeeper. He\u2019s directly accountable to the trustees. He will know their identities and faces.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo where are we going to get a crew of slaves and slavers?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to bargain with Jason Parris,\u201d Richard said.</p><p>\u201cWho is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe most vicious crime lord in the Cauldron.\u201d</p><p>The anxiety she\u2019d been feeling since coming into view of Kelena returned full force. \u201cAh,\u201d Charlotte said, forcing her voice to sound light. \u201cI\u2019m so relieved. I thought we would be doing something dangerous.\u201d</p><p>RICHARD strode down the wooden boardwalk along the Cauldron\u2019s Sharkmonger Canal, aware of Charlotte walking next to him and the dog trotting a few yards behind. To the right, two-story buildings rose in a continuous wall, built of anything from stone to discarded lumber, each story with its own faded, weather-beaten awning. The awnings hung over the boardwalk, shielding it from the rain and sun. It was late evening, and the numerous colored lanterns hanging from chains and ropes seemed almost to create more shadows than they banished.</p><p>Beyond the buildings, even higher structures stretched upward, making the canal resemble a river running along the bottom of a deep, man-made canyon. The water, the color of milk tea, was completely opaque. Small docks punctuated the canal here and there, marked with bright orange-and-green sail-like banners that stretched all the way from the top story to the ground.</p><p>The air smelled of bitter salt, seaweeds, smoke, and a confusing, slightly nauseating amalgam of odors particular to the Cauldron: incense; cooked meat; alcohol fumes; the distinct reek of sumah, an illegal narcotic; and the ever-present stench of fish guts.</p><p>They passed a small square dock. A body floated facedown, bumping against the wooden supports. Next to him, Charlotte stopped for a short moment and then kept walking.</p><p>She had probably never been to a place like this before, but if she had, he wouldn\u2019t know. She obviously didn\u2019t belong here, in the vicious human gutter. In her place, Cerise, his cousin, would\u2019ve put her hand on her sword and stalked like a predator in unfamiliar territory. Rose, Declan\u2019s wife, would\u2019ve been wary, alarmed, at the very least cautious. Charlotte floated. The way she held herself with assurance and slight indifference, as if she were strolling through a garden listening to the slightly boring droning of a friend, made it impossible to question her right to be here. She made herself belong, and when she saw a bloated corpse in the water, she\u2019d merely paused for a moment, as if it were an odd flower, and resumed walking.</p><p>Her training was so strong that even here her poise was flawless. Charlotte must\u2019ve had a mentor, someone with an ancient bloodline and an instinctual understanding of etiquette. He recognized it because despite being a poor Edge rat, his own education had come from such a man. His mentor was his granduncle, an exile from the Dukedom of Louisiana, and he was sure that if Vernard were still alive, he would\u2019ve offered Charlotte nothing but praise.</p><p>Who could\u2019ve hurt her so much that she had abandoned everything and fled to the Edge?</p><p>DAWN Mother, there was a dead person floating in the water.</p><p>Ice rolled down Charlotte\u2019s spine, an alarming mix of revulsion, fear, and anxiety. The sight of a single corpse after she had created so many shouldn\u2019t have been so unsettling, but somehow this lone bloated body, discarded like garbage and ignored by everyone, nearly made her gag.</p><p>\u201cTell me about this crime lord,\u201d Charlotte said, hoping for a distraction before her stomach rebelled and emptied itself on the boardwalk.</p><p>\u201cJason Parris was born in the Broken, in a small mountain town,\u201d Richard said. \u201cHis family was poor, so after he finished high school, he joined the Marine Corps. It\u2019s one of the elite branches of the Broken military. He survived a war in a foreign country and decided to leave after his four-year term of service was completed. When he returned home, he couldn\u2019t hold a job. He worked for a series of businesses doing manual labor and was either fired or quit\u2014he didn\u2019t last long at any of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Wouldn\u2019t being in the military teach him discipline?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, he has discipline.\u201d Richard shrugged. \u201cHe also has very definite ideas about who is and isn\u2019t worthy of his loyalty. He listened to his sergeants and officers because they had done what he did and he was smart enough to recognize that they were trying to keep him alive. In his mind, they had earned the right to give him orders. His civilian employers weren\u2019t worthy of the same respect. They understandably took a rather dim view of his attitude. Jason found himself often unemployed. He was used to having his own money, and suddenly he had to depend on relatives for a roof over his head. It made him angry. One night, in a bar fight, that anger boiled over, and he severely injured a man. A relative took him to the Edge to keep him out of jail. He was just coming to terms with the idea that magic existed when slavers raided the Edge settlement. Jason was fit and healthy, prime merchandise from their point of view. They overpowered him. He proved to be a difficult captive and attacked them every chance he got. Voshak tried his best to break him but couldn\u2019t. Jason went through the Market and was sold to a garnet mine. A month later, I raided that mine and found him in a hole in the ground. It was my second raid, and knowing what I know now, I would\u2019ve had doubts about pulling him out of that hole.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t want to go home?\u201d</p><p>Richard grimaced. \u201cNo. He asked for directions to the nearest city instead. I dropped him off at Kelena. He started calling himself Jason Parris and said that this city would become known as his island. An allusion, if you will, to the place where he first received his military training. Now, a year later, he owns everything you can currently see. The old crime lords that ran the Cauldron had established certain boundaries. They had families and business interests, and were unwilling to risk them. Parris had nothing. He tore through them and took over all of their territory. He kills whoever whenever however he feels necessary, without reservation or remorse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would anyone follow him?\u201d Sooner or later, someone like that would turn on his own people.</p><p>Richard shook his head. \u201cJason isn\u2019t a psychopath. He\u2019s vicious, but he kills selectively, with a strategy in mind. His people fear him, yet they also know that as long as they comply with his demands, they will be safe and rewarded. He respects strength. He can be charming, but no matter what he says or how he greets us, don\u2019t trust him or his second, Miko. In fact, don\u2019t trust anyone in that building. Jason is the drive and the muscle, but Miko is his mind, and that mind dreams up plans with high body counts.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Richard stopped, and Charlotte paused next to him. The continuous wall of buildings here was particularly ramshackle, the awning pale and weather-bleached from a once deep rust to a pale, sad orange. Loose lumber had been nailed to the wall in every direction.</p><p>\u201cWhy did we stop?\u201d Charlotte murmured.</p><p>\u201cThere are sentries watching us,\u201d he said. \u201cAcross the street on the roof, one on the right in the boat, and there is one directly above us on the balcony, listening to everything we say. They will report to Jason, and we\u2019ll wait here and see if he decides to see us.\u201d</p> <p>She leaned closer to him. \u201cAnd if he doesn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll knock,\u201d Richard said.</p><p>The wall of the house behind them slid open. An old woman emerged, wearing a shapeless red dress and a red scarf on her hair. She waved at them with a wrinkled brown hand and disappeared inside, into the gloom.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been invited.\u201d Richard smiled.</p><p>\u201cIndeed.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFollow me, please.\u201d</p><p>He strode through the narrow hallway. The dog trotted in after him. She was last through the door, in command of Rear Ward, or whatever the proper military term was. Charlotte followed the dog up a short flight of narrow dark stairs, into a hallway, and through another doorway. A spacious room stretched before them, illuminated by the familiar Weird-style lanterns. Shaped like bunches of delicate glowing flowers, the lanterns cascaded from the hooks between the windows near the tall ceiling. An expensive rug stretched across the polished wooden floor to the stone fireplace. In the center, a tea table waited, surrounded by soft chairs upholstered in light leather.</p><p>A man sprawled in the largest chair. His broad shoulders stretched the fabric of his gray shirt. His chest was broad, and his arms, revealed by the short sleeves of his tunic, bulged with muscle. He had to be over six feet tall, and his huge frame dwarfed the chair. His head had been shaved in a series of meticulously spaced strips of various widths that ran from his forehead to the nape of his neck; the effect was alternating stripes of glossy hair and smooth, shaved, light brown scalp.</p><p>His features would\u2019ve been handsome in a masculine, square-jawed, leader-of-the-pack way, but a scar covered most of the left side of his face. A burn, Charlotte diagnosed. Not by direct application\u2014either from steam, or more likely, flash-magic heat. Deeper lines crisscrossed the scar. Probably from a grate of some sort that had covered the heat source. So this was Jason Parris. She had expected someone older, but he appeared to be in his mid-twenties.</p><p>The man\u2019s eyes, startling green against his darker skin, surveyed Richard and paused on her. Intelligent eyes. He radiated power and menace, and when she met his stare, his eyebrows crept up a hair. Perhaps he had expected her to flinch.</p><p>A girl stood next to him, as lean and slight as he was bulky. She looked too young to be here, seventeen, perhaps eighteen. Her face was smooth and a shade darker than his. Her hair hung over her face in stiff, straight locks, the result of some sort of hair product. She wore close-fitting jeans and a gray sweatshirt with HARVARD printed on it in red letters. It had to have come from the Broken.</p> <p>\u201cThe Hunter,\u201d Jason said. His voice was deep and resonant, and he spoke in an unhurried manner. \u201cI feel honored. Do you feel honored, Miko?\u201d</p><p>Miko said nothing.</p><p>\u201cSee, she feels honored.\u201d Jason spread his massive arms. His voice had a slight mocking quality to it. \u201cYou smell like piss and you look even worse.\u201d</p><p>Jason\u2019s stare slid over to her. His light eyes widened. \u201cRichard, you have a girl. And you got a dog together. Where are you registered? I will buy you a toaster.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe dog is hers,\u201d Richard said.</p><p>The wolfripper showed Jason his big teeth.</p><p>\u201cSo, what can we do for the mighty Hunter?\u201d</p><p>Richard reached into his bag.</p> <p>Miko leaned forward, focused.</p><p>A man stepped from the doorway, a crossbow in his hands.</p><p>Richard extracted Voshak\u2019s bleached-blond braid from the bag and tossed it to the crime lord. Parris snatched it from the air and looked at the blond strands. \u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout ten hours ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnybody left from his crew?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Parris glanced at the crossbowman and tossed the braid into the air. A bolt whistled and bit into the opposite wall, pinning the braid securely in place.</p><p>The crime lord turned to Richard. \u201cYou bring me such fine gifts, Hunter. What do you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is a slave ship docking north of the city at eleven tonight. They expect a crew of slaves and slavers to board it,\u201d Richard said.</p><p>Parris leaned forward, his eyes suddenly predatory. \u201cThey will take them to the Market.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. One small problem: the slaver crew is dead, and they\u2019d failed to capture any slaves. If someone was in charge of a rough crew, that someone could take their place.\u201d</p><p>The crime lord smiled. It was a chilling smile. \u201cIf only we knew a man with such a crew.\u201d</p><p>Richard shrugged. \u201cHe might be a valuable man to know. He would become quite wealthy, but more importantly, he would be the man who sacked the Market.\u201d</p><p>Parris raised one eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cThe security on the island is geared toward dealing with runaway slaves and irate customers. They won\u2019t expect an assault from a couple of dozen armed fighters. It\u2019s an opportunity for money from the slave trade, wealth from the buyer\u2019s agents, and a chance for revenge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRisky,\u201d Parris said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know how well the place is guarded. I was half-dead when they dragged me through it, but I remember guards.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2018No guts, no glory,\u2019\u201d Richard quoted.</p><p>Risky was an understatement, Charlotte reflected. This plan Richard had hatched made a hardened criminal pause, yet he didn\u2019t even mention it to her beforehand. Unquestionable obedience was one thing, not being used to her full potential was another. She would have to point this out to him when they were alone.</p><p>\u201cWhat share do you want?\u201d Parris asked.</p><p>\u201cNone. I want the bookkeeper, and I want him alive.\u201d</p><p>The crime lord pondered it. She could sense Parris\u2019s hesitation. They needed to offer him something to tip the scales in their favor. What could they possibly propose to him? What would a crime lord be interested in? Money, of course, but even if she could get access to her finances, she doubted money alone would make him risk his life and his people.</p><p>Her gaze paused on his face. The scar stood out against his skin like a brand. It must\u2019ve made it difficult to look in the mirror every morning.</p><p>\u201cHow did you get your scar?\u201d Charlotte asked.</p><p>Parris turned to her. \u201cA gift from Voshak. I\u2019d broken out of the cargo hold. The plan was to take a swim, but the plan failed, and Voshak had his boys hold me against the ship\u2019s heating unit. Tried to teach me a lesson.\u201d He flashed his teeth at her. \u201cI\u2019m a hard learner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you like me to remove it?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Parris raised his eyebrows. \u201cYou can do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d The skin was the easiest of all body tissues to heal.</p><p>Parris pondered the idea for a moment. \u201cThanks, but I think I\u2019ll keep it. It\u2019s part of me now.\u201d</p><p>Miko leaned over to him and whispered something, her face urgent.</p><p>Jason frowned. \u201cYes, but you\u2019d have to make it look old.\u201d</p><p>Miko whispered again.</p><p>Parris considered it. \u201cIf she heals me and I get all profits from sacking the Market, you have a deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBefore she does anything, she needs rest and food,\u201d Richard said.</p><p>They were talking about her as if she weren\u2019t even in the room.</p><p>Parris stared at him. \u201cDo I look like a Holiday Inn to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEight hours of uninterrupted rest behind a solid door, a fresh change of clothes, food, and clean water to wash up,\u201d Richard said. \u201cThose are our conditions.\u201d</p><p>Parris sighed. \u201cFine. But if my face isn\u2019t fixed by noon, you\u2019ll be resting six feet under for a lot longer than eight hours.\u201d</p><p>CHARLOTTE followed Richard and a woman armed with a sword up the stairs. They walked into another narrow hallway, and the woman stopped by a door and swung it open. Richard stepped inside, and Charlotte and the dog followed him into a small suite. Perfectly clean, with pale, almost golden wooden paneling on the walls and large windows framed by green curtains, the room could\u2019ve belonged to any of the nicer hotels. A large bed dominated the floor, its linens and bedspread an inviting light yellow. Two stacks of clothes lay on the bed. To the right, another door opened to a small bathroom.</p><p>A single bed in a single room. Jason was assuming they were a couple.</p><p>The dog flopped on the rug and sniffed at the floor. Richard shut the door, locked it, and lowered a heavy wooden bar in place, securing the door as if it were an entrance to an old castle.</p><p>His skin had turned sallow. Grime stained his face. An abominable stench rose from his clothes. He had to be squeezing the last drops of energy from his exhausted body to remain upright.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind waiting for the bathroom,\u201d she said.</p><p>He bowed his head slightly. \u201cNeither do I.\u201d</p><p>She crossed her arms.</p><p>\u201cYou agreed to follow my orders,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThe order of our bathing has nothing to do with our mission.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCharlotte,\u201d he said, his voice tired. \u201cI\u2019m not going to shower before you.\u201d</p><p>The sound of her name coming from him startled her. Something about the way he said it touched off the same feminine flutter she had felt when he called her beautiful. It was the strangest feeling, a mix of anxiety, surprise, and pleasure, soaked in excitement. But nothing about this made sense. She was covered in blood and dirt. Not only that, he had recently watched her kill people, then go through their pockets. Romance had to be the last thing on his mind and should have been the last on hers.</p><p>\u201cRichard,\u201d she said, her voice firm. \u201cYou smell awful. Please have mercy on my nose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou deserve the first turn at the bathroom. Offering to fix his face was a stroke of genius.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThank you, but I\u2019m perfectly happy waiting.\u201d</p><p>Richard stared at her.

In broad strokes. While I don\u2019t have your expertise in dealing with the criminal underground, I\u2019m a woman of reasonable intelligence, and I react badly when surprised. I understand that you\u2019re used to being the lone swordsman, but I promise you that I can be an asset at the planning stage and can assist you better if I know where you\u2019re going. Use me as your, what\u2019s the Broken expression? Sounding door?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSounding board,\u201d he said, his voice dry.</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d</p><p>Richard\u2019s face had a most curious expression. Two parts exasperation, one part shock, and three parts politeness so ingrained in him that it was keeping the rest of his emotions in check. \u201cWill there be anything else, my lady?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. It would bring me great pleasure if, when both of us are present during a conversation, you could occasionally acknowledge my presence and allow me to speak for myself instead of referring to me in the third person.\u201d</p><p>Richard locked his jaw. She waited patiently to see if he would explode.</p> <p>\u201cThe next time we have to talk to a violent psychopath, I\u2019ll strive to keep that in mind,\u201d he said.</p><p>The next time you don\u2019t, I won\u2019t stand there quietly. \u201cThank you for indulging me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy pleasure.\u201d</p><p>He bowed his head, managing to put enough exasperation into that bow to fuel a small ship for a voyage across the ocean. Very well. She curtsied. The effort of bending her legs nearly took her off her feet.</p><p>They straightened.</p><p>\u201cWe still have the question of the bathroom,\u201d she said.</p> <p>He reached into his pocket and pulled out a silver doubloon. \u201cHeads or tails.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHeads.\u201d She took the coin from his palm. \u201cAnd I will do the tossing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t trust me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou told me not to trust anyone. Besides, I\u2019m not the one with a brother who magically wins bets.\u201d</p><p>She flipped the coin and slapped it onto the back of her wrist.</p><p>\u201cTails.\u201d Richard smiled. \u201cI win. The bathroom is all yours, my lady.\u201d</p><p>Accusing him of cheating wasn\u2019t just illogical, it was silly. Charlotte took her stack of clothes and walked into the bathroom. The dog followed her.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said firmly, and shut the door. A disappointed whine answered her.</p> <p>Inside an Adrianglian-style drencher shower waited for her: a wide showerhead positioned directly above, over her head. Charlotte turned the handle and warm water cascaded down in a welcome waterfall. Charlotte stripped and stepped under the flow.</p><p>The water splashed over her in a cleansing stream. Her legs buckled a little. Her muscles ached all over, and the shower did nothing to wash the encroaching drowsiness from her. Charlotte washed her hair with detached thoroughness. It felt like someone else was driving her body. If she didn\u2019t hurry, she would collapse before she reached the bed. She washed all the dirt off, wrapped a towel over her hair, dried herself with the larger towel, and picked up the first garment from the stack of clothes.</p><p>RICHARD heard a muffled word from the bathroom. His body was giving out from fatigue, and the bathroom door was relatively thick, but he was absolutely sure that Charlotte de Ney had just called someone a prick.</p><p>Considering her latest stand, he shouldn\u2019t really be surprised. Their partnership was less than a day old, and he had already received a dressing-down. Your own damn fault, he congratulated himself. You took her with you.</p><p>The dog rose from his spot by the bathroom door, trotted over, and flopped by him with all the grace of a sack of potatoes. Big shaggy paws rose in the air, and he was presented with a canine chest.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>The dog looked at him. Fine. Richard reached over and rubbed the fur. He couldn\u2019t possibly smell any worse. The wolfripper dogs weren\u2019t trained to kill humans, only to find them and keep them put. The slavers didn\u2019t wish to unduly damage their merchandise. Aside from their size and their teeth, the wolfrippers were just dogs, and this shaggy idiot seemed starved for affection.</p><p>Richard scratched the dog\u2019s belly. He wasn\u2019t sure why he hadn\u2019t thought to tell her what he was planning. It was simply force of habit. He had been on his own for too long. Being chewed out for it, like he was a child who had committed a lapse in manners, however, wasn\u2019t in his plans. She would have to get over it. Nor would he be obeying her orders. In fact, he would address it the moment she came out of the bathroom, to prevent future misunderstandings.</p><p>The door opened slowly.</p><p>\u201cIt appears our host has a sense of humor,\u201d Charlotte said, and stepped out.</p><p>Her hair fell down over her back in a combed wet wave. She wore a flowing robe of pale pink that ended a few inches above her knees. The robe was completely, decadently sheer. He could see every curve of her body, from the elegant neck to the swell of her breasts, barely obscured by the folds of the fabric, to the supple bend of her waist and widening of her hips . . .</p><p>He was staring. All of his years as an adult male had vanished, wiped away as if they never existed, and he was a teenage boy again, awkward and dumbstruck. He gaped at her, unable to glance away, unable to make a sound, unable to do anything but stare.</p><p>He wanted her. She was an erotic dream.</p><p>This wasn\u2019t real, he decided. He was still in a cage or lying by the road dying, and his feverish brain had conjured up a beautiful fantasy to taunt him one last time before he passed on into the afterlife.</p><p>A pale pink blush spread over Charlotte\u2019s cheeks.</p><p>Look away, you fool.</p><p>Richard closed his mouth and forced himself to turn to the bed and pick up his own stack of clothes. \u201cIt appears you\u2019re right. Jason does have a sense of humor. Let\u2019s hope I don\u2019t come out in a leather loincloth.\u201d</p><p>He headed to the bathroom, forcing himself to look anywhere but at Charlotte as she crossed the room and climbed under the covers.</p><p>In the shower, he leaned against the wall, bracing himself with both arms, and let the water splash onto the back of his head and over his back, massaging his tired muscles. Richard closed his eyes and saw Charlotte in his mind. Get a grip. You\u2019re the man she sprung from a cage, covered in filth, piss, and blood. She took pity on him and healed him. She had no idea that it was more kindness than he had seen from a woman in years. For her it was merely common charity.</p><p>She was a beautiful, refined woman. A man would have to be dead not to respond to her. He had come so close to death, and now his body was rejoicing in the fact he\u2019d survived. Acting on it was out of the question. She trusted him, and he wouldn\u2019t break that trust. Even if she opened that door, which she would not, Charlotte had just suffered an emotional catastrophe. Only a lowlife would take advantage of that, and he wouldn\u2019t be the mistake she regretted first thing in the morning.</p><p>Richard shut his mind off, soaped up the sponge, and scrubbed himself until he could detect no odors other then the crisp, spicy scent of soap. The shower was almost more effort than he could take. As he stood under the water, he briefly considered simply sitting down on the floor and not getting up. But he was pretty sure she would come looking for him, and being found naked slumped on the shower floor would be truly disastrous.</p><p>Jason had left that outfit on purpose. The man was smart and perceptive. He would\u2019ve read their body language, deduced that they were traveling together but weren\u2019t intimate, and taken this opportunity to taunt him. If Richard was keeping score, this one would go to Jason Parris, but he wasn\u2019t interested in side battles.</p><p>His clothes turned out to be plain Weird attire: simple dark gray underwear, a tunic, and brown cotton pants. It would do until he could acquire new ones. He exited the bathroom. Charlotte lay on her side, hidden under a sheet. Her eyes were half-closed, and he wasn\u2019t sure if she was asleep or watching him through the curtain of her soft eyelashes.</p><p>Richard took his sword from where he\u2019d left it, by the door, and sank down against the door, crossing his legs, his blade resting against his shoulder. Generations of his ancestors had slept just like this, and some of them had woken up with their blades in their attackers. If Jason had a moment of insanity and decided to disrupt their rest, he would join them.</p><p>\u201cRichard,\u201d Charlotte said.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you worried we may not survive the night?\u201d</p><p>There was no point in lying. \u201cI prefer to be cautious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you like a blanket and a pillow?\u201d</p><p>He would\u2019ve liked to join her in bed. And what would you do if you did? You\u2019re so tired, you can\u2019t see straight. \u201cNo, thank you. I\u2019m used to sleeping like this. It gives me comfort.\u201d</p><p>She stirred on the bed. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor guarding the door, and for taking me with you.\u201d</p><p>There were many questions he wanted to ask her. He wanted to know where she was from, why she had run away to the Edge, and how her ex-husband had hurt her, but the fatigue smothered him. Richard closed his eyes and surrendered to sleep.</p><p>FIVE</p><p>WHEN Charlotte awoke, sunlight was spilling through the windows into the room, the delicate and pale radiance of the late morning coloring the light yellow bedding a faint peach.</p><p>Richard stood by the door, with his bare back to her. He\u2019d changed into dark trousers and was holding a white shirt. Muscle corded his back, hard and powerful, bulging under bronzed skin, as if he had absorbed the sun\u2019s warmth and now was suffused with it. He was built like a predator, lean, strong, fast, and perfectly balanced. Frightening in his potential for violence yet irresistibly compelling. She wanted to run her hand up his back, tracing the contours of the muscle underneath. It was a completely sensual desire, a physical need free of rational thought. He was so different from her, so very masculine, and she wanted to reach for him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Richard raised his arms, pulling on the shirt. The muscles flexed under his skin, bulging on his broad shoulders. She watched, mesmerized. Last night, when she had crawled into a strange bed, feeling half-dead, it occurred to her that she was in the house of a criminal, deep in the worst part of the city. If Jason Parris wanted to murder them, he could at any time and with complete impunity. Nobody even knew where they were. Her fear had spiraled, threatening to explode into a panic attack. Then Richard had sat down with his back against the door last night, and her anxiety had faded. Somehow she was completely sure that nothing would make it past him to harm her. It was selfish, but she closed her eyes knowing he wouldn\u2019t move till morning, and she slept well.</p><p>No woman could mistake the way he had looked at her last night when she had stepped out of the shower. She had looked at him too, through the curtain of her eyelashes, when he emerged, his skin clean, his hair damp. She looked at him even though she knew she shouldn\u2019t have. He embodied strength, and she felt weak, despite knowing otherwise. Further, she had survived terrible things, and she was tempted to remind herself that she still lived in the most primal of ways. She wouldn\u2019t do it to him, however. First, it was simply not done, not in this fashion and not after a mere two days of knowing each other. Second, Richard made it plain that his effectiveness depended on having no attachments. He would resent her.</p><p>Neither of them were in their right mind. People who had nothing to lose often did crazy things, and she had to listen to the voice of reason.</p> <p>He turned.</p><p>She\u2019d remembered that he was handsome, but his face caught her by surprise. His intelligent, intense eyes took her measure, and she had to fight not to stammer.</p><p>\u201cGood morning,\u201d Richard said.</p><p>She called upon her years of training, and when she spoke, her voice was completely even. \u201cGood morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJason\u2019s people brought us new clothes,\u201d he said, pointing to a stack of clothing in the chair. \u201cThey\u2019re old and probably not quite as nice as what you\u2019re used to, but we mustn\u2019t attract attention. In the Cauldron, new clothes are likely to get us killed, and we probably want to avoid that, if at all possible.\u201d</p> <p>He should\u2019ve slept a lot longer, considering his injury. \u201cHow long have you been up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot that long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome here, please.\u201d</p><p>He approached the bed. Charlotte sat up, holding the sheet over her chest, raised her hand and touched his neck with her fingers. His skin felt hot under her fingertips. An excited flutter dashed through her. She smelled the light scent of soap emanating from his hair and skin, a hint of spice and citrus.</p><p>Really now. She was thirty-two years old. She could hold her libido in check. Charlotte focused. Her magic slipped out of her fingers and sank into his skin. The wound had almost completely healed. His temperature was normal. Mild dehydration, slightly elevated pulse. In fact, it rose in the brief seconds she touched him. Of course, she told herself. He\u2019d seen her butcher sixteen people. Naturally, he would be alarmed when she touched him. Charlotte dropped her hand.</p><p>\u201cClean bill of health,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cGlad to hear it.\u201d</p><p>He was looking at her. The daylight streaming through the gap in the curtains painted a light gold stripe across his face, tinting his skin gold and bringing a rich russet tint in his irises. He was handsome, his body was strong and fit, and the danger he radiated just enhanced his pull. When Charlotte looked at him, really looked at him as she did now, he was striking.</p><p>And she had no business looking at him. Both of them were on a mission, and it left no room for softness or attraction.</p><p>\u201cWe never talked about the plan,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s simple,\u201d he said. \u201cWe impersonate slavers and their catch, board the ship, and ride it to the Market. Once we near the port, you may have to eliminate the crew. It will have to be done quickly and silently, so as not to alarm those on land.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan Jason\u2019s people operate the ship?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cHe assures me that they can. Whatever his other faults are, Jason is efficient and competent. This is a port city, and there are many former sailors in his crew. We\u2019ll dock and let Jason and his cutthroats do what they do best. Meanwhile, you and I will go and find the bookkeeper. We must eliminate the people at the top of the slaver\u2019s food chain, and for that we will need the bookkeeper alive. Once we know the identity of his superiors, we\u2019ll go from there.\u201d</p><p>She would have to kill again. She knew what she had signed up for when she demanded to come with him. Now wasn\u2019t the time to get squeamish. \u201cIt\u2019s a sound plan,\u201d she said. \u201cHow large a crew do you expect me to kill?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe ship they will be using is likely fast, maneuverable, and unremarkable. I\u2019m betting on a brigantine or albatross, which means fifteen to twenty people at most. Will it be an issue?\u201d</p><p>That was a complicated question. \u201cNo. No issue,\u201d she told him.</p><p>Richard stood up. \u201cI\u2019ll wait outside the door for you.\u201d</p><p>He took his sword and stepped out.</p><p>In that moment, when she found that red spark inside, she had known exactly what the consequences would be. Her life as a healer was over. Her life as an abomination would be brutal and devoid of sympathy or warmth, but probably short. It would be worth it, she told herself. If no other child ever had to cry the way Tulip had because the slavers had taken someone from her, it would be worth it.</p><p>THE corpse lay on a table, a large male about ten years older than Jason but with a similar skin tone. The flesh on the corpse\u2019s cheek bore the same pattern as the scar on Jason\u2019s face.</p><p>The corpse looked fresh. Was it a rival, a long-standing enemy? Or more likely, some man off the street who happened to resemble Jason Parris. Charlotte exhaled quietly. She had walked into this world on her own. She would deal with it.</p><p>Richard leaned against the wall, his arms crossed. The crime lord sat next to the corpse in a chair. Miko leaned against the wall as well, as if mirroring Richard, one leg bent, her foot propping her up. She was a strange girl, quiet, her narrow face calm, but there was this odd hint of unpredictability about her, as if she was just waiting for the right moment to stab someone.</p><p>The disfigurement on the corpse\u2019s face looked red and fresh. The marks on Jason\u2019s face were more than a year old.</p><p>\u201cHow will you age the burn?\u201d Charlotte asked.</p><p>\u201cWe have a necromancer,\u201d Jason said. \u201cShe will age it. Is there anything you need to heal me?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head.</p><p>The aftereffects of fatigue were still there, pooling in her bones, but she\u2019d recovered much faster than she had expected. If she had healed sixteen people yesterday, she would be in bed, unable to move. But now, she felt . . . refreshed. Relieved, as if some heavy physical burden had been lifted off her shoulders. The irony.</p><p>Healing is a noble sacrifice, Lady Augustine\u2019s voice instructed from her memories. Harming is a selfish perversion.</p><p>The burden wasn\u2019t truly gone, Charlotte reflected. She had simply traded the pressure created by the imbalance in her magic for the weight of murder on her mind.</p><p>\u201cSo this healing, is it a special talent?\u201d Jason asked.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome magic can be taught.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte nodded. \u201cYes. Flashing can be taught and improved through practice, even for someone from the Broken, assuming they have any magic at all. Healing can be made more efficient, but you must be born with the talent.\u201d</p><p>Jason was looking at Richard. \u201cYour sword thing is a flash, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Richard nodded.</p><p>Jason looked at her. \u201cI\u2019ve seen a lot of strange magic shit here but never what he does. I asked him to teach me, but he won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do enough harm as it is,\u201d Richard said.</p><p>Jason grinned. \u201cAww, you hurt me, old man.\u201d</p><p>Richard raised his eyes to the heavens. \u201cI\u2019ve unleashed you on this poor unsuspecting city. I simply feel sorry for the cutthroats of Kelena. If I teach you to flash, there will be none of them left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need flash for that.\u201d Jason touched his scar. \u201cLet\u2019s get on with it.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte took a chair and set it in the beam of light spilling through the high window near the ceiling. \u201cSit, please.\u201d</p><p>He sat down. Charlotte stepped closer, turning his face with her fingertips to better view the scar in the light. A second-degree burn, extending into the reticular dermis, the deep layer of skin that cushioned the body against stress. She\u2019d healed worse.</p><p>She raised her hand and let the golden sparks of her magic sink into his skin. He held completely still, his unnerving gray eyes steady.</p><p>The damage was extensive. She sank into the task of repairing the tissue destruction. When a body sustained an injury, specialized cells, which the Broken doctors called \u201cfibroblasts\u201d and the College healers called \u201csuture cells,\u201d sprang to the rescue. They moved into the wound and began secreting collagen, traveling within the clot until finally they anchored and closed the gash. The moment this anchoring took place was determined by many factors, and when the process went on too long, it led to the buildup of fibrous tissue and sometimes, if the scars formed on organs, fibrosis, which could be fatal.</p><p>The scar itself was comprised of the same collagen fibers as the regular skin, but instead of crisscrossing, these fibers aligned in the same direction. She had to soften the stiff tissue of the scar and then painstakingly shift the collagen fibers within the skin to approximate its normal basket-weave pattern. It was slow, methodical work. Facial scars required precision\u2014the symmetry of the face was at stake. The room, Richard, Jason, all of them faded. Only the injured tissue remained, and she focused on realigning it.</p><p>As if through a wall, she heard muffled voices.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re getting your scar healed, and you\u2019ve procured a body double,\u201d Richard said. \u201cWhy the sudden need to appear dead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Mirror is taking an interest in me,\u201d her patient answered.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you do?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMany things, none of them good, but none of them concern the spooks either. They\u2019re watching me, and I don\u2019t like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI warned you, Jason,\u201d Richard said.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t lecture me, old man.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re expanding too fast and killing too many. Violence attracts attention.\u201d</p><p>Jason sighed. \u201cIn case you failed to notice, I\u2019ve been doing pretty well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Five Gangs are frothing at the mouth trying to put you on the bottom of the ocean, Rook has placed a bounty on your head, and now the Mirror\u2019s agents are watching your house. Your definition of \u2018well\u2019 is troubling at best.\u201d He suddenly smiled and affected a slight accent. \u201c\u2018I do not think that word means what you think it means.\u2019\u201d</p><p>He was obviously quoting something he and Jason seemed to know that she did not.</p><p>Jason grinned. \u201cHa, she ain\u2019t a princess, and you wish you were that good a swordsman.\u201d He turned to Charlotte. \u201cHow do you stand him?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe sleeps by the door with his sword to keep me safe,\u201d she told him. \u201cDon\u2019t move.\u201d</p><p>Finally satisfied, she withdrew her magic and took a step back.</p><p>He looked good. It was one of her finer restorations. Relief washed over Charlotte. She could still heal. She had lost none of her skill or power. She hadn\u2019t realized until now that she\u2019d been afraid taking lives might come at the cost of the primary purpose of her magic. She knew it didn\u2019t preclude her from healing; she just wasn\u2019t sure if her control or precision had been compromised.</p><p>The post-healing fatigue wrapped around her, making her dizzy. Jason touched his face. The scar had aged him, but now she could see his face more clearly, and Charlotte realized he was still a young man.</p><p>Miko stepped up and offered him a mirror. Jason looked at himself. His eyes widened.</p><p>\u201cMagic hands,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s a very valuable talent. Almost makes a man regret that he doesn\u2019t own it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTouch her and lose your fingers,\u201d Richard said, his voice casual.</p><p>Jason looked at her. \u201cCome work for me. I\u2019ll take better care of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee, the problem with Richard is, he doesn\u2019t know how to treat a woman. You have to take care of women properly. A woman is like a horse.\u201d</p><p>Dawn Mother, not one of those. \u201cHow so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you want to tame a horse, you offer her an apple. She has to get used to your scent and your delicious apples before she\u2019ll let you put the bridle on her. Soon, if you ignore her, she\u2019ll follow you waiting for a handout. If you keep bringing her treats, eventually she\u2019ll let you ride her.\u201d</p><p>Mhm.</p><p>Richard was leaning against the table like a dark shadow, his pose relaxed, his lips smiling, but his eyes watched Jason with complete focus. Like a wolf sighting his prey, she realized.</p> <p>Jason smiled, displaying even white teeth. At her position on the wall, Miko rolled her eyes.</p><p>\u201cAll I\u2019m saying is I have plenty of apples,\u201d the crime lord said. \u201cYou should give it some thought. You\u2019d like my apples.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte leaned closer to him. \u201cJason, whoever told you this nonsense isn\u2019t your friend. Women aren\u2019t horses, or dogs, or cats. We\u2019re human beings, and the sooner you figure that out, the less likely you will wake up with Miko\u2019s knife in your throat.\u201d</p><p>He stared at her.</p><p>\u201cYou asked me what I want. I want to crush the slave trade. Having a fling with you doesn\u2019t appeal to me. You\u2019re handsome, but you\u2019re too inexperienced and too arrogant to be good in bed. Having ridden many horses doesn\u2019t make you a good rider; it just proves that you can\u2019t recognize a good one or don\u2019t know how to keep her. You\u2019re too young for me, and in ten years, when you improve, I will be too old for you. So let\u2019s not speak of this again.\u201d</p><p>A thin, high-pitched sound came from the wall. Miko was snickering.</p><p>Jason turned in his chair and looked at her, outraged.</p><p>She giggled some more.</p><p>The crime lord blinked and turned back to Charlotte. \u201cSome people would be worried. Words like that can get your throat slit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome people don\u2019t realize healing can be done in reverse,\u201d she told him. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you ask Voshak what he thinks about that?\u201d</p><p>Richard stalked across the floor and came to stand by her side.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re as crazy as he is,\u201d Jason growled.</p><p>\u201cNow you\u2019re getting the idea,\u201d Richard said.</p><p>\u201cEven if we sack the Market and you get your information, what can you do?\u201d Miko said suddenly. \u201cYou\u2019re only two. The slavers are hundreds.\u201d</p><p>Richard grimaced. \u201cI know. It\u2019s a shame, really. I would\u2019ve liked to give them a sporting chance, but sometimes life simply isn\u2019t fair.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte smiled. You had to admire the man.</p><p>\u201cYour face is restored to its former beauty.\u201d Richard turned to Jason. \u201cAre you going to hold up your end of the bargain?\u201d</p><p>Jason rose and pulled the hood of his cloak over his face. \u201cI\u2019m on it, old man. I remember. You said the ship lands at midnight. Where is he planning to dock?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTeal Inlet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeet me two miles north of it tonight at ten.\u201d</p><p>He left the room, Miko in tow.</p><p>\u201cWhat now?\u201d Charlotte asked.</p><p>\u201cNow we go to the city,\u201d Richard said. \u201cI have contacts here. We\u2019ll need them for tonight.\u201d</p><p>IN the daylight, Kelena didn\u2019t look any better, Charlotte reflected, walking with Richard along the canal. It smelled the same, too. At least the dead body was gone, probably swept out to sea by the tide. They had left the dog at Jason\u2019s house. She didn\u2019t the see the harm in his coming, but Richard pointed out that if he bit someone, they would likely be drowned in the nearest canal. They locked him in a room with a cow femur from Jason\u2019s kitchen.</p><p>Richard turned into the narrow alley between the houses, barely wide enough to let them move side by side. The alley opened into a small courtyard, formed by the tall walls of surrounding buildings. Another, much wider alley to the right led from the courtyard, and three men blocked it. They didn\u2019t look friendly.</p><p>Her throat tightened. Her pulse sped up, and an uncomfortable heaviness filled her chest. Charlotte swallowed, but the tightness refused to dissolve. There was going to be a fight.</p><p>It\u2019s just a physical reaction, she told herself. It\u2019s just fear. Her anger and outrage had numbed her yesterday, but that armor had melted during the night. She was very much aware she was alive. She was afraid.</p><p>Charlotte squared her shoulders. She had to handle it.</p><p>The front man, hard, large, bald, with swirls of dark tattoos running over his pale scalp, grinned. His lips stretched unnaturally far, showing a mouthful of two-inch-long fangs. Spiked strips of metal covered his knuckles.</p><p>His magic washed over her, grating against her skin like a handful of sharp sand. A familiar revulsion drowned Charlotte. Her fear spiked in response. The man had been modified with illegal magic, the kind the Dukedom of Louisiana used for the Hand, its covert agents. She\u2019d dealt with it before. A modification made its recipients stronger, faster, and more deadly. It also robbed them of their humanity and was nearly always impossible to reverse.</p><p>Charlotte focused on the two friends of the alligator-mouth. The one to the left was tall, armed with a short mace tipped with a fist-sized chunk of metal. The one to the right, leaner and probably faster, carried two knives. The red rash on the knife fighter\u2019s neck indicated a case of advanced luries, which is what happened when one had sex with unhealthy partners without protective measures.</p><p>Of the three, the modified alligator-mouth man posed the biggest threat. Charlotte felt the magic stir inside her. It yawned, stretched, like a cat rising from a nap, and licked its teeth. Infection wouldn\u2019t be fast enough. She\u2019d have to tear into them and try to cause organ failure.</p><p>\u201cThe man with the strange teeth is enhanced with illegal magic,\u201d she murmured for Richard\u2019s benefit. \u201cThe one with knives has a swollen groin.\u201d</p><p>He blinked. \u201cThank you. I\u2019ll take it under advisement.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d never done a direct unhealing before. Infection, yes, but nothing that caused internal bleeding with the exception of her slip with Elvei. A coppery taste appeared on her tongue. Adrenaline.</p><p>The alligator-mouth realized that his toothy display wasn\u2019t having the desired effect. \u201cYou\u2019re lost,\u201d he called, his voice deep.</p><p>Richard kept walking. She followed him, the dark currents spinning inside her.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, we\u2019ll show you and your bitch the right direction.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo kind of you,\u201d Richard said, and then he moved.</p><p>One moment he was next to her, the next he had smashed his hand into the alligator-mouth\u2019s throat. The man jerked back, and Richard twisted him over his arm, driving the full weight of his opponent to the ground. Before the leader landed, Richard hammered a kick to the macer\u2019s knee. The cartilage crunched, the leg bent the wrong way, and the man crumpled. Richard caught the mace, pulled it from the falling man\u2019s hand, and pivoted to the knife fighter. The handle of the mace danced in his hand, sinking solid blows\u2014head, solar plexus, groin\u2014and the knife fighter dropped to the ground, curling into a ball.</p><p>Alligator-mouth surged to his feet and lunged at Richard, hands out, jaw gaping. Richard knocked his right arm aside, locked his hand on the man\u2019s wrist, jerking it down, smashed the mace handle against the nerve cluster at the base of the man\u2019s exposed neck, and hit him again just below the jaw.</p><p>The big man staggered, as if drunk, waved his arms, fighting desperately to remain upright, then half sat, half fell on the ground, his eyes dazed.</p><p>Charlotte closed her mouth.</p><p>It happened so fast, she didn\u2019t even help. She had simply stood there. The healer in her cataloged the injuries: one traumatized throat, one tear to the posterior cruciate ligament of the knee\u2014a partial at the very least. A full tear was more likely with impaction of the anterior aspect of the femoral condyle against the anterior aspect of the tibial plateau. Richard had kicked the attacker so hard he knocked the bones of the leg together, bruising the femur and tibia. A full tear would mean a healer like her or a ligament graft, because once that ligament ripped completely, no surgeon could sew it back together. Two concussions\u2014one mild, one severe\u2014one sprained neck, one sprained arm, multiple bruises, and three dignities irreparably damaged. All in less than five seconds. And he hadn\u2019t even unsheathed his sword. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Richard approached her and held out his hand. Shell-shocked, she rested her fingers on his, and he helped her step over the bodies into the narrow alley leading from the courtyard.</p><p>Talk, she told herself. Talking makes you appear confident. She couldn\u2019t afford to let him know that he\u2019d shocked her. She had to appear cool and collected because that\u2019s what he needed in a partner. \u201cI thought Jason would better control his territory,\u201d she said. Her voice sounded normal. She\u2019d expected it to shake.</p><p>\u201cThey were probably his men,\u201d Richard said.</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou humiliated him,\u201d Richard said. \u201cThis was the way he showed his displeasure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose you\u2019ll now point out that this is the result of me speaking for myself.\u201d Just try it . . .</p><p>\u201cThat would be satisfying for me, but not entirely accurate. I\u2019ve visited the city on four occasions since he took control of the Cauldron, and he prepared a lovely surprise for me every time. The hardest was an Erkinian woman. We fought for three full minutes, and I thought she\u2019d kill me.\u201d</p><p>They seemed to have a love-hate relationship. Jason admired Richard\u2014she\u2019d read that much in his face and the way he looked at him\u2014and wanted his approval, while at the same time resenting Richard for it. \u201cJason has father-figure issues, doesn\u2019t he?\u201d she asked.</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d Richard sighed.</p><p>\u201cIn that case, it\u2019s good that you\u2019re a human Cuisinart,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA Cuisinart. It\u2019s an appliance from the Broken. You put vegetables into it, push a button, and it chops them into tiny pieces.\u201d</p><p>Richard frowned. \u201cWhy would you need an appliance to chop vegetables? Wouldn\u2019t it be easier to chop them with a knife?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s meant to save time,\u201d she explained.</p> <p>\u201cDoes it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, cleaning it usually eats up most of the time you save on chopping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re telling me that I\u2019m useless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a neat gadget!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m hard to clean, apparently.\u201d</p><p>She checked his face. Tiny sparks danced in his eyes. He was pulling her leg. Well. If that\u2019s how it is . . . \u201cConsidering last night\u2019s argument, I think that you\u2019re remarkably difficult to clean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere probably is a retort to this that\u2019s not off-color,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I can\u2019t think of one.\u201d</p><p>They reached the middle of the alley. A street person sat on the filthy pavement, a sad, hunched-over figure swaddled in rags. His hair hung over his face in an oily gray tangle. A bitter stench of rotting fish rose from his clothes. He looked old and tired, his face a mess of grime. The dirt was caked so thick she could barely see his eyes, his pupils milky white. He was suffering from cataracts.</p> <p>The beggar raised his cup and shook it at Richard.</p><p>Richard glanced at the beggar. His expression didn\u2019t change, but his eyes turned darker. Richard bent down and dropped a coin into the cup. \u201cThird tooth,\u201d he said, his voice barely above a whisper. \u201cTwo hours. Bring your brother.\u201d</p><p>The beggar pulled back his cup, his head drooping lower.</p><p>Richard straightened and took her firmly by the elbow. His touch was light, but Charlotte realized she wouldn\u2019t be able to get away. Richard drew her away from the beggar, down the alley.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t look back,\u201d he murmured. \u201cThat was George.\u201d</p><p>The urge to turn around was overwhelming. \u201cGeorge Drayton? \u00c9l\u00e9onore\u2019s George?\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>Her heart beat faster. The boys would have to be told what happened to \u00c9l\u00e9onore. She was their grandmother. They deserved to know. Her throat closed up. What would she say? There was no way to soften the blow. It would be devastating. She was a grown woman, and seeing \u00c9l\u00e9onore\u2019s body burning had torn a hole in her life that filled with grief, guilt, and anger. They were children who had known \u00c9l\u00e9onore all of their lives. She was the safe haven of their childhood, the one person besides their sister who loved them no matter what and would never abandon them. She made their world safer, and now that illusion of safety would be ripped away. Charlotte swallowed. She had to find the right words somehow.</p><p>It occurred to her that George sat in filth on a street. \u201cWhy is George dressed as a beggar? I thought the Camarine family had adopted the boys?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe and his brother work for the Mirror.\u201d</p><p>They\u2019re spies? Wait a minute. \u201cRichard, George\u2019s only sixteen. Jack should be fourteen.\u201d</p><p>He took a second to glance at her. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t they too young? They\u2019re barely in their teens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome children are less childlike than we like to pretend,\u201d he said. \u201cAt George\u2019s age, I had killed two people and watched my father\u2019s head explode as he was shot dead in a market. What were you doing at sixteen, Charlotte?\u201d</p><p>The long field filled with moaning people surfaced from her memory. The coppery scent of blood, mixed with the toxic stench of warped magic, and the smell of smoke rising from the town a few fields away.</p><p>\u201cAt sixteen I was healing the victims of the Green Valley Massacre.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd George is being inconspicuous to\u2014\u201d</p><p>A boy shot into the alley ahead, slid on garbage, caught himself, and dashed toward them. Reddish brown hair, cropped short, handsome face, dark eyes, completely wild with excitement. She\u2019d seen this boy before in a photograph . . . Jack!</p><p>\u201cRun!\u201d Jack yelled. \u201cRun! Go, George!\u201d</p><p>Behind him a mob of enraged people spilled into the alley, brandishing knives and clubs.</p><p>The beggar-George jumped to his feet. \u201cWhat did you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere he is!\u201d the man at the head of the mob roared. A rock whistled past their heads, ricocheting from the side of the building.</p><p>\u201cRun!\u201d Jack yelled.</p><p>Blue lightning shot out of the crowd\u2014someone had flashed. Oh no.</p><p>Jack jumped six feet in the air, avoiding the glowing ribbon of magic by a hair, bounced off the wall, and sprinted straight at them.</p><p>\u201cHi, Richard, hi, pretty lady!\u201d Jack dashed past them.</p><p>Richard grabbed her hand. \u2018We have to go!\u201d</p><p>They broke into run and chased after Jack, running fast on the cobbled stones. George swore and tossed something over their heads at the crowd. A dry pop burst behind them. Charlotte glanced over her shoulder. A plume of dense white smoke filled the alley. People coughed.</p><p>The blue-glowing whip of someone\u2019s flash struck out of the smoke, licking the cobbles. Someone in this mob was throwing magic around blind. This city was insane.</p><p>They cleared the courtyard and the narrow alley, burst out onto the boardwalk, and pounded down the street. The entrance to Jason\u2019s hideout flew by. The air grew hot in Charlotte\u2019s lungs.</p><p>A small wooden dock rose on their left. \u201cGo right!\u201d Richard yelled, too loud, and leaped off the boardwalk into the dark water, pulling her in with him. The tepid water swallowed her. Charlotte gulped a mouthful of salty liquid and nearly choked. Gods alone knew what sort of contamination was in that water.</p><p>Charlotte kicked her feet and surfaced, spitting the water out. Richard pulled her under the dock, just as two other bodies hit the water a foot away. A moment, and George and Jack broke the surface next to them. The four of them huddled under the dock, their backs against the canal wall, among dirty foam and garbage.</p><p>The mob spilled onto the boardwalk. Charlotte held her breath.</p><p>\u201cThey went right!\u201d someone yelled. \u201cTo the Reed Alley!\u201d</p><p>Boots pounded above them, shaking drops of water from the dock\u2019s boards onto them.</p><p>The filthy wet creature that was George raised his hand, gave his brother a death stare, and drew his thumb across his neck. Jack grinned.</p><p>A dead fish floated up from the depths right next to Charlotte. Ew. She pushed it gently aside with her fingers.</p><p>The last of the stragglers ran past, the noise of the mob retreating. Richard waded to the left, walking along the canal wall at a brisk pace. She waited to make sure the kids followed and went after him.</p><p>Fifteen minutes and two canals later, they climbed out onto the boardwalk. Jack shook himself. Filthy water ran from George\u2019s rags in dirty streams. His hair dripped. He stared at his brother, his face grim. If stares had temperature, Jack would\u2019ve turned into a burned-out match.</p><p>Charlotte gulped a breath, hoping for some fresh air and finding none. Her own soaked clothes smelled like rancid seaweed. Water filled her shoes, and something slimy had wedged itself under the toes of her left foot.</p><p>Richard ducked into another alley, and she followed, limping and making squishy noises on the cobbles. The boys brought up the rear.</p><p>Nobody said anything for the next ten minutes until Richard stopped before a warehouse. The small wooden door swung open. A woman stepped out in front of them, carrying a metal bucket filled with bloody water. She hurled the contents into the canal.</p><p>Great. Fantastic. Once they were somewhere safe, she would sit everyone down and check them for infection.</p><p>Richard held the door open, his eyes scanning the boardwalk.</p><p>Charlotte ducked inside and stepped into a large gymnasium. Men and women, stripped down and sweaty, punched and kicked heavy sandbags. A man and a woman, both muscled with crisp definition, sparred on the reed mats; another pair of fighters squared off, their hands raised, in the roped-off ring raised on a wooden platform. A din hung above the muscular bodies: the rapid staccato of smaller bags being hit, the thuds of kicks hammering at the heavier bags, guttural cries, and rhythmic breathing.</p><p>Charlotte took a step forward. Everything stopped. The gymnasium went completely silent. As one, the fighters looked at her. None of the faces were friendly.</p><p>Not good. She straightened her shoulders, raising her head. Behind her, Jack took a deep breath.</p><p>Richard stepped through the doorway and strode ahead of her, oblivious to the hostility in the room.</p><p>A middle-aged, overweight man stepped away from the ring and walked toward Richard, his steps unhurried. A scar cut across his tan face, just a hair shy of his left eye. Half of his right earlobe was gone, the edge of the old wound ragged and uneven. Bitten off, Charlotte realized. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>If there was a problem, she\u2019d push the teens outside and block the door. At least she\u2019d buy them a few minutes.</p><p>Richard and the overweight man met in the middle of the floor. The man\u2019s eyes were grim.</p><p>Here we go.</p> <p>The overweight man hugged Richard, turned, and went back to the ring. The punches and grunts resumed. Richard nodded at them. \u201cBack room.\u201d</p><p>As soon as they were alone, she would punch him, Charlotte promised herself. No, no she wouldn\u2019t, because resorting to physical violence wasn\u2019t proper. Then again, it might be considered self-defense. If she died as a result of this journey, it wouldn\u2019t be because of slavers. It would be because Richard\u2019s inability to communicate would give her a heart attack.</p><p>RICHARD closed the door of Barlo\u2019s back room and glanced about: a long table, two benches, a sink with a freezing unit next to it, and a scale . . . empty. Barlo had used this chamber as one of the two rooms where fighters warmed up before bouts.</p><p>His heartbeat slowed. So much of his life in these past months had been spent waiting, calculating, watching. Moments like this, born from excitement and danger, when he ran along the steel edge of his sword, matching his wits against opponents, were when he felt truly alive. His heart pumped, the world seemed brighter, the experiences sharper, and he loved every bit of it.</p><p>\u201cRichard!\u201d</p> <p>He turned.</p><p>Charlotte faced him. Her wet tunic molded to her figure, and her hair, which she\u2019d put up into a neat knot, had come undone and hung over her face. That air of detachment and civility had been washed away, as if someone had taken an elegant cat, groomed to within an inch of its life, and dumped a bucket of water on it. Her expression had the same shock, outrage, and promise of violence.</p><p>If he laughed, she\u2019d probably kill him. Quite literally.</p><p>Charlotte opened her mouth, clamped it shut, opened it again . . .</p><p>He strained to keep his face solemn. \u201cMy lady?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWords.\u201d</p> <p>She seemed on the verge of breaking down or screaming. It was best to tread carefully. \u201cWords are good,\u201d he agreed.</p><p>She raised her hands. \u201cI want to punch you.\u201d</p><p>Richard almost doubled over. He\u2019d driven the quintessential aristocrat to crude violence. It had to be about the canal. Oh, the indignity. \u201cI know the water isn\u2019t the cleanest, but we had no alternative.\u201d He let the mask drop a little and smiled. \u201cI promise you, it will be okay. Before you know it, we\u2019ll be warm and dry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care about the bloody canal! Simple words, Richard! Like \u2018We\u2019re safe\u2019 or \u2018They won\u2019t harm us!\u2019 Or \u2018He\u2019s an old friend.\u2019\u201d She made a short cutting motion with her hands. \u201cSomething! I thought we were about to get pummeled.\u201d</p><p>Pummeled here? At Barlo\u2019s? Did she think he would bring her to somewhere where she would be unsafe? \u201cOf course you were safe. I took you in here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou also took me to Jason\u2019s, where you then slept holding your sword.\u201d</p><p>Oh, really now. He took a step toward her. \u201cI assure you, my lady, that you were perfectly safe. If anyone put a hand on you, they\u2019d lose it, and everyone inside that place knew it.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte clenched her hands. \u201cAargh!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m just trying to clarify.\u201d He knew he should\u2019ve let it go, but the idea that he would stupidly put her in danger irritated him beyond belief. \u201cSo you want me to tell you if we\u2019re in danger or if we\u2019re safe. You do realize that there may not be an opportunity to warn you every single time?\u201d</p><p>Charlotte dropped onto the bench. \u201cI would settle for some of the time at this point.\u201d</p><p>Richard couldn\u2019t stop himself. \u201cAs shocking as it seems, occasionally you may have to rely on your own judgment. For example, if we\u2019re running from a mob, we\u2019re probably not safe.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte\u2019s gaze was sharper than a knife. \u201cOne more word of mocking, and I\u2019ll infect you with papillomavirus.\u201d</p><p>She had graduated to actual threats. What was it with this woman? \u201cPray tell, what would that be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWarts,\u201d George said.</p><p>Laughing was out of the question, he reminded himself. \u201cMy apologies. Please allow me to remedy the situation by using words: we\u2019re safe here. Barlo\u2019s an old friend. His fighters know me. We can speak openly here.\u201d</p><p>She hung her head.</p><p>George yanked the sodden mass of hair off his hand and hurled it across the room at his brother. Jack dodged, and the wig splattered against the wall.</p><p>\u201cYou moron!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d Jack blinked, an expression of angelic innocence on his face.</p><p>\u201cYou!\u201d A white glow sheathed George\u2019s eyes. \u201cTwo weeks! I spent two weeks watching Parris, and you screwed it up for me. All you had to do was stay out of the way and watch for his people coming out. What the hell did you do?\u201d</p><p>Jack shrugged. \u201cI stole a fish.\u201d</p><p>Richard hid a laugh. If he had a doubloon for each time he and Kaldar had had this precise conversation . . .</p><p>George\u2019s blue eyes went wide. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was hungry. And bored. But mostly hungry.\u201d Jack spread his arms. \u201cLook, I took one small fish, then the guy started screaming, so I slapped him with it. It wasn\u2019t my fault he tripped and fell into a stall of fruit. So I laughed, and they all started chasing me.\u201d</p><p>The rage written on George\u2019s face imploded into icy determination. His voice was suddenly calm. \u201cAnd so you had this pissed-off mob chasing you. Why did you lead them my way?\u201d</p><p>Jack widened his eyes in mocking sincerity. \u201cBecause you needed a bath.\u201d</p><p>George pulled his rags over his head and dumped them on the floor. He wore a gray-and-black tunic and pants. Good choice, Richard decided. The clothes hugged his body, while allowing ample freedom of movement. In the few years he had known him, the boy had filled out. George would never be a large man, but he had that devastating combination of lean muscle, quickness, and discipline that made one a lethal swordsman.</p><p>\u201cTwo weeks in that alley. Rain, heat, people kicking me as they passed by. And you decided I needed a bath.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWater is good for you. Really. You were filthy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMhm,\u201d George said.</p><p>\u201cDo you have any idea how badly you smelled?\u201d Jack wrinkled his nose.</p><p>\u201cI was supposed to smell. I was pretending to be a beggar. You blew my cover.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour cover was already blown,\u201d Richard said. \u201cParris knows the Mirror has been watching him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee?\u201d Jack said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s beside the point. You ruined two weeks of work because you were bored. Now I\u2019ll be pulled off this assignment, and someone else will have to take my place.\u201d</p><p>Jack shrugged, slightly less sure of himself. \u201cGood. It\u2019s summer. All you do is work. Maybe we can finally have some fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to kill you,\u201d George said calmly.</p><p>Another familiar emotion. This had to run its course, or it would fester.</p><p>\u201cBoys,\u201d Charlotte began. \u201cI really don\u2019t think\u2014\u201d</p><p>A glowing yellow sheen rolled over Jack\u2019s irises. He was two years younger but already the same height as George and wider in the shoulder, with the beginnings of a powerful musculature. Benefits of his changeling blood. Of course, it came with many drawbacks.</p><p>Jack motioned at George. \u201cBring it.\u201d</p><p>George lunged forward, swinging his arm. Jack moved to block. Midway through the punch, George twisted, picking up speed, jumped, and kicked his brother in the chest. Jack flew out the door and into the gym.</p><p>Nicely done!</p><p>Charlotte gasped.</p><p>George strode to the door with a determined look on his face.</p><p>\u201cGeorge!\u201d Charlotte called.</p><p>He turned on his toes, produced an elegant bow, said, \u201cExcuse me, my lady. This won\u2019t take long,\u201d and walked out.</p><p>Charlotte looked at Richard. \u201cWhy are you just standing there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re young men. It\u2019s quite normal,\u201d he told her, and held the door open for her. \u201cIt\u2019s better they resolve it now and be done with it.\u201d</p><p>She sighed, stood up, and went out into the gym.</p><p>The two boys danced across the floor, launching a flurry of kicks and punches, blocking, spinning, jumping. The other activity stopped, and the fighters watched them. Jack clearly had superior strength and speed, but George had studied harder. His movements had the surety born from many hours spent training, while Jack fought on instinct. His instinct was rarely wrong, Richard reflected, as George slid across the floor after taking a powerful kick. But it was no substitute for practice. Still, since William, his cousin\u2019s changeling husband, had taken over Jack\u2019s hand-to-hand education, the boy showed a marked improvement.</p><p>George rolled to his feet, lunged, getting inside his brother\u2019s guard, and locked his hands on Jack\u2019s arm. Northern three-point flip, Richard diagnosed. Jack tried to counter with the Lower Sud drop\u2014William\u2019s influence\u2014but the three-point was nearly impossible to stop, and George had gotten a good hold. Trip, turn, flip. Jack flew through the air, and George slammed him onto the ground. Jack\u2019s back slapped the floor.</p><p>Ugh. Richard grimaced in sympathy. That had to hurt.</p><p>George landed on him and locked his arm into a bar. The fighters cheered.</p><p>Next to him, Charlotte winced again. Watching it from the healer\u2019s point of view was probably more trying. He decided to reassure her. \u201cThey\u2019re actually quite careful with each other. For example, this takedown was designed to incapacitate the opponent. A quarter turn to the right, and Jack would\u2019ve landed on his neck.\u201d</p><p>She gave him an unreadable look.</p><p>He felt compelled to explain. \u201cGeorge could\u2019ve broken Jack\u2019s spine . . .\u201d</p><p>She raised her hand. \u201cRichard, stop trying to make me feel better. You\u2019re making it worse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be an idiot,\u201d George said, putting pressure on Jack\u2019s arm. \u201cYou\u2019re done.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m just resting,\u201d Jack told him through clenched teeth.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re done,\u201d George said.</p><p>They were at an impasse. Jack wouldn\u2019t admit defeat, and George, despite all his anger, wouldn\u2019t dislocate his brother\u2019s arm. He took a step forward to break them up, but Charlotte beat him to it.</p> <p>She walked across the gym and crouched by the two teens. \u201cThat\u2019s enough, George.\u201d She gently put one hand on his fingers, gripping his brother\u2019s arm. \u201cI have something very important to tell both of you, and it won\u2019t wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it good news?\u201d Jack ground out.</p><p>Profound sadness reflected on Charlotte\u2019s face. \u201cNo. It isn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>George released Jack\u2019s arm. The boys rolled to their feet.</p><p>\u201cCome,\u201d she said, linking one arm with George, the other with Jack, and led them both back into the room.</p> <p>SIX</p><p>\u201cMY name is Charlotte.\u201d Dear Goddess, there were no right words. Charlotte took a deep breath. \u201cYour grandmother might have mentioned me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou rent our house,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She nodded.</p><p>George leaned forward. \u201cSomething happened to Grandmother.\u201d It wasn\u2019t a question.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she answered anyway. \u201cI\u2019m a healer. Richard was injured and running away from slavers. He\u2019d reached East Laporte and lost consciousness. Someone found him and brought him to me so I could mend his wounds.\u201d She swallowed. \u201cYour grandmother and I were very close. She was always kind to me. She was my friend.\u201d</p> <p>The words stuck in her throat. She forced them out, each sound cutting her from the inside. \u201cShe was with me when Kenny brought Richard to us. There was also another young woman and her sister with us at the time.\u201d</p><p>Her chest felt heavy. An ache set in, rolling around her heart like a ball of lead. Both George and Jack were looking at her, and she couldn\u2019t look away. Her voice sounded strange to her.</p><p>\u201cI healed Richard. He had lost a lot of blood, so I left to buy some. While I was gone . . .\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t do it. She couldn\u2019t bring herself to say the words.</p><p>\u201cThe slavers burned the house and murdered one of the young women and your grandmother,\u201d Richard said. \u201c\u00c9l\u00e9onore is dead.\u201d</p><p>She saw the precise moment when the meaning of the words sank into George. He took a small step back. His face jerked, and his shoulders slumped forward, as if he had been stabbed and wanted to curl into a ball to protect the wound.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Jack said. \u201cThere are ward stones around the house. There are fucking rocks around the house! Nobody can get in.\u201d</p><p>George\u2019s eyes blazed with white. The glow built, spilling like tears of lightning onto his cheeks. He chanted something savage under his breath. She felt the magic swell around him. The tiny hairs on the back of her neck rose. So much power. So much power. It built on itself, like an avalanche.</p> <p>\u201cStop!\u201d she called. \u201cGeorge, no . . .\u201d</p><p>The magic crested and broke. White light shot out of his eyes and mouth, shining from within him out of his every pore, setting his skin aglow. \u00c9l\u00e9onore had told her the boy was a necromancer. She\u2019d said nothing about this.</p><p>His feet left the ground. He hung suspended a foot in the empty air. His magic smashed into Charlotte like a blast wave. She gasped and saw him through the lens of her own power. He glowed like a radiant beacon of light, his magic focused into a beam, searching the darkness.</p><p>His ghostly voice echoed through her mind.</p><p>\u201cM\u00e9m\u00e8re. M\u00e9m\u00e8re, it\u2019s me. Answer me. Please answer. Please, M\u00e9m\u00e8re.\u201d</p><p>The desperation in his words flooded her. The tears heated her eyes. He was reaching far, past the edge of the Weird, past the boundary. It was impossible, but he was doing it.</p><p>\u201cPlease, M\u00e9m\u00e8re. I love you so much. Please answer.\u201d</p><p>That voice, suffused with so much love and hope, pulled tears out of her. Hot moisture wet her cheeks. Someone put his arms around her, and she realized it was Richard. He steadied her. She knew she had to pull away, but she needed the warmth of his arms, the link to another human being, because she was adrift in the sea of George\u2019s anguish, and it was tearing her apart.</p><p>\u201cM\u00e9m\u00e8re . . .\u201d George\u2019s ghostly voice pleaded.</p><p>The darkness didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t leave me.</p><p>\u201cPlease . . .\u201d</p><p>His glow dimmed. The magic let go, and George fell, dropping into a crouch. His legs gave way, and he sat clumsily on the boards.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s gone,\u201d he said, his voice so young.</p><p>She slipped away from Richard, onto the floor, and hugged him. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. I\u2019m so, so sorry.\u201d</p><p>Jack\u2019s skin tore open. A wild tumble of muscle and skin spilled out, and a huge lynx landed on the floor. The big cat snarled and ran out the door.</p><p>Richard jumped to his feet. \u201cI\u2019ll watch over him.\u201d He took off after the lynx.</p><p>George stared at the floor, his gaze dull. No words would fix it. Nothing she said would make any difference, so she sat next to him and held him. It was all she could do.</p><p>RICHARD ran out the door. The boardwalk was empty. He\u2019d paused for a precious second to grab a set of spare clothes from Barlo, and now Jack was gone. Changelings like Jack weren\u2019t exactly welcome in society. Their minds worked differently from normal people\u2019s. They had trouble understanding human relationships and rules of behavior, but they felt every slight deeply, and it often drove them to violence. The Dukedom of Louisiana murdered them at birth, while Adrianglia treated them as its dirty secret, turning them into soldiers in its prisonlike military schools.</p><p>Jack hadn\u2019t been given up to the realm at birth, like most of his kind. He grew up in a loving family, which made allowances for his nature. Kelena wouldn\u2019t be so kind. If he was spotted and identified, someone would try to kill him.</p><p>Richard turned, scanning the buildings. The boy was fast, especially on four legs, and wasn\u2019t thinking clearly. Lynxes were tree cats; they pounced on their prey from the branches above. He would want to be someplace high, where he could be alone.</p><p>The warehouse across the canal was too low. The distant high-rises of the Business District were too far away and too populated. Where could he have gone?</p><p>To the right, the tall, pale tower of the nearest Kelena\u2019s Tooth scraped the sky. Tall and isolated. A perfect hiding spot.</p><p>Richard jogged through the tangled labyrinth of the Cauldron, along the boardwalks to the edge of the water, then continued past it along the docks stretching into the ocean. The day was overcast, and the water mirrored the gray sky.</p><p>He had experienced plenty of loss in his life. His mother was the first to go, dead at twenty-eight of an aneurysm. He remembered the way she had looked in the coffin, a pale, bloodless imitation of herself. He\u2019d wondered for an absurd moment if someone had replaced her with a doll. His father was next. Marissa. Then Aunt Murid and Erian . . .</p><p>He wished he could\u2019ve spared George and Jack the same fate. Once again he was watching children suffer and unable to do anything about it.</p><p>The last dock ended. In the distance, waves broke against Kelena\u2019s Teeth, splashing against the stone bases of the towers. The tide was low, and crests of sand surfaced here and there. Richard took a chance and jumped. The water came to his knees.</p><p>He waded through to the nearest stretch of sand, heading toward the closest tower. A trail of paw prints pockmarked the sand. Cat footsteps, no claws. The trail led to the tower.</p><p>Kelena\u2019s Teeth had keepers, who monitored the weather and activated magical defenses when storms came. They stood watch in shifts inside the towers. Richard broke into a run, moving at full speed, devouring the sand in long strides.</p><p>Ahead, a stone block slid aside in the tower wall, about twenty feet above the water. More stones slid from the walls, winding in a spiral around the tower, leading down. A man ran out, his eyes wild, and sprinted down the newly formed stairs.</p><p>Richard reached the tower. Finally.</p><p>The keeper splashed through the water toward him. \u201cThere\u2019s a changeling in the tower!\u201d</p><p>Richard reached into his pants and pulled out a half doubloon. \u201cThere is no changeling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw him!\u201d The older man waved his arms. \u201cA huge cat as big as a horse!\u201d</p><p>A horse was pushing it. A pony at best. Richard took the man\u2019s hand, put the coin into it, and looked into his eyes. \u201cThere is no changeling,\u201d he repeated slowly.</p><p>Understanding dawned in the man\u2019s eyes. \u201cI didn\u2019t see anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. I\u2019ll need to borrow your tower for a few minutes, then I\u2019ll leave, and it will be safe for you to go in.\u201d</p><p>Richard started up the stairs.</p><p>\u201cIf he breaks anything, you\u2019ll pay for it!\u201d the keeper yelled. \u201cAnd don\u2019t touch anything either!\u201d</p><p>Richard clambered up the stones that formed the stairs and ducked into the entrance. It was amazing how quickly fear subsided when gold became involved.</p><p>A spiral staircase wound about the stone inner core of the tower, illuminated by the light from many windows. He climbed the steps, higher and higher, until he saw a gaping door at the end of the stairway.</p><p>A raw, pain-filled sound came from upstairs. It wasn\u2019t a feline snarl or any other sound one would expect a lynx to make. Halfway between a howl and a cry, gut-wrenching and brutal, it vibrated through the air. If Richard had hackles, they would\u2019ve risen in response.</p><p>Richard sat down. There was no need to go in. The boy required privacy.</p><p>Another cry followed, wordless and filled with grief and guilt.</p><p>Richard leaned his back against the wall. Jack and he, they were both men, and men had unspoken rules.</p><p>Many years had passed since his father died, and for many of these years his aunt Murid had taken care of him and Kaldar. He was almost an adult when she took him in, but he remembered how much it hurt. He felt abandoned, terrified, guilty for not being there, but the only emotion the rules allowed him to display was anger, and so he raged like a lunatic. Aunt Murid handled his pointless fury with the same expertise she\u2019d handled Kaldar\u2019s obsessive stealing. Both of them had gone out of their way to do dumb shit just to remind themselves they were alive. But even in their darkest moments, both of them knew they were loved. They had a home. It wasn\u2019t the same as the one before, but they were grateful for it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When he was thirty-two, the Hand had attacked the family. In the final battle with Louisiana\u2019s spies, Murid fell. He hadn\u2019t seen her die, but Kaldar had. Richard vividly remembered looking at her savaged body. He remembered his chest hurting and the look on Kaldar\u2019s face, the glassy-eyed gaze of a man whose every emotion had drowned in profound grief. They didn\u2019t talk about it. They stood next to each other at the funeral, stone-faced, because that was the thing to do. After the funeral, they drank together as was proper for a Mire family and went their separate ways within the Mar house.</p><p>He\u2019d come up to his room, thinking he would read a book. Instead, he sat in his chair, catatonic, staring into space, until he realized he was crying. Kaldar must\u2019ve mourned, too. Neither of them would ever admit to his grief. They\u2019d never spoken about it.</p><p>The woman who had taken care of them, sheltered them, and guided them, filling the shoes of both parents at once, had died. But he couldn\u2019t bring himself to comfort his brother even though he knew both of them desperately needed that comfort.</p> <p>Now Jack and George had lost a woman who loved them and sheltered them, and they followed the same pattern. Jack\u2019s running out was probably for the best. If George wanted to grieve freely, he could, because Charlotte was a woman, and her presence wouldn\u2019t be a deterrent. And Jack . . .</p><p>Another forlorn howl rolled through the tower.</p><p>He would talk to Jack when the boy was done. There were things he had to say, things he wished someone had said to him or Kaldar years ago.</p><p>Whatever differences he and Kaldar had, they were brothers, Richard reflected. They had dealt with their guilt and pain in the same way. Kaldar channeled it into an insane obsession with destroying the Hand. Even marriage to the woman he clearly loved beyond all reason did nothing to knock his brother off his path. Richard, on the other hand, had chosen to go after slavers. There probably was a hint of insanity in what he did. No, perhaps not insanity. Fanaticism.</p><p>\u201cFanatic.\u201d It was an old word originally meaning \u201cinspired by god,\u201d and its first meaning was to describe a person possessed by a god or a demon. It was a very accurate description, he reflected. He was possessed, not by a demon, but by the need to correct a wrong. He was a true believer, his cause was just, and he had given all of himself to it without regret. But at the core, it was about helplessness. When Sophie had stopped showering, then stopped talking, then ran away when he tried to ask her why, he could do nothing. He had never felt more helpless in his life, not even when his wife, Marissa, walked out on him.</p> <p>He\u2019d loved Marissa completely, with absolute devotion, and when she\u2019d left him after two years of marriage, his whole world shattered. He had decided it was a good lesson, eventually, once he had crawled out of the deep, dark hole where he\u2019d existed for months. He thought the experience had cured him of the longing for female company just as he\u2019d thought that the road he was on had burned all capacity for emotion out of him. But here was Charlotte, and she stirred something inside him that compelled him to respond. He couldn\u2019t help himself.</p><p>If he\u2019d met Charlotte before this started . . . It was an intriguing but fundamentally stupid thought. If he had met her, she wouldn\u2019t have given him a second look. She was a blueblood and a healer, probably highly respected, while he was a Mire rat with no name, no status, no rank, and very modest means of support.</p><p>And yet he couldn\u2019t stop thinking about her. That\u2019s how it started, Richard reflected grimly. Thinking about a woman, wondering what it would be like, picturing it. A purely physical attraction he could handle, but he\u2019d seen her in a moment of vulnerability. He knew exactly what it cost her to follow him. She was courageous, in the true sense of the word. Experience and training had given him an edge, and he rarely experienced acute fear when facing an opponent. Most of the time, he didn\u2019t even feel anxiety, as if his soul had developed calluses. Perhaps he simply didn\u2019t have anything to lose.</p><p>Charlotte had no combat experience. She hid her fear well, but he was learning to read her. When she raised her chin and squared her shoulders, Charlotte was afraid. She had been alarmed when they met Jason Parris, scared when they faced the thugs, and frightened when the mob chased them. Yet she kept going, overcoming her fear every time. That strength of will was worthy of both his admiration and his respect. Her very humanity made her fascinating and drew him to her. He wanted to know more about her. He wanted to spare her that fear. He wanted to remove whatever was causing her discomfort. Yet there was no way to do it without cutting short her involvement, and he had made a promise to respect her mission.</p><p>Jack emerged from the room. He was nude, and his eyes were red.</p><p>Richard offered him the clothes. The boy dressed.</p> <p>Richard rose. \u201cThere is no shame in grief. It\u2019s human. You didn\u2019t do anything wrong. It doesn\u2019t make you weak, and you don\u2019t have to hide it.\u201d</p><p>Jack looked away.</p><p>\u201cYou couldn\u2019t have prevented your grandmother\u2019s death. Don\u2019t take any of the guilt or blame on yourself. Blame those who are actually responsible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to the slavers?\u201d Jack asked, his voice hoarse.</p><p>\u201cYour grandmother killed some of them. Charlotte killed the rest.\u201d</p><p>They went down the stairs side by side.</p><p>\u201cI want in,\u201d the boy said.</p><p>\u201cIn on what?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re the Hunter. You\u2019re hunting the slavers. I want in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how would you know that?\u201d If someone had opened their mouth, he would be really put out.</p><p>Jack gave a one-shouldered shrug. \u201cWe overhead you and Declan talking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeclan\u2019s study is soundproof.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot to reanimated mice,\u201d Jack said. \u201cGeorge wants to be a spy. He listens in on everything, then he tells me.\u201d</p><p>Fantastic. Declan and he had taken extra measures, like activating soundproof sigils and meeting during late hours, and two teenage boys could still undermine all of their careful security precautions. How comforting. And he wasn\u2019t feeling like a complete moron, not at all. He was sure Declan wouldn\u2019t feel like a moron either.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m coming with you,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely not.\u201d</p><p>Jack bared his teeth in a feral grief.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Richard said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a fun adventure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKaldar let us\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He sank enough finality into his voice to end all arguments.</p><p>Jack clamped his mouth shut and walked sullenly next to him. They left the tower and headed toward the city.</p><p>This battle wasn\u2019t won, Richard reflected, looking at the stubborn set of the boy\u2019s jaw. And once they got back, George and Jack would tag team him. If worse came to worse, he\u2019d talk Barlo into keeping them under lock and key while he and Charlotte dealt with the ship.</p><p>\u201cGEORGE,\u201d Charlotte murmured.</p><p>George remained slumped in her arms, catatonic. She scanned him again. No physical injury. Too much magic, expended too quickly. She had no idea if he was slipping into a permanent coma or just resting, exhausted.</p><p>I shouldn\u2019t have told you. She realized she\u2019d spoken the words aloud.</p><p>\u201cShe was our grandmother,\u201d George said. \u201cWe have a right to know.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte exhaled. Conscious. Finally.</p><p>The boy pushed away from her very gently, got up, and offered her his hand. She took it and stood up.</p><p>\u201cRichard values family above all else,\u201d George said. \u201cHe would\u2019ve told us if you didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know what he does?\u201d she asked.</p><p>George nodded.</p><p>\u201cThen you know he will do all he can to get justice for your grandmother, and so will I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe liked you,\u201d George said. \u201cShe told us a lot about you. We saw your picture.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte swallowed. \u201cYour grandmother was very kind to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that why you\u2019re with him now?\u201d George asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s complicated,\u201d Charlotte said. \u201cBut yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe will join you.\u201d</p><p>He said it matter-of-factly, as if it was the most natural thing in the world for a sixteen-year-old to become a killer. No. Not on her watch.</p><p>\u201cThere is no place for children in what we are about to do. Richard will tell you the same thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sixteen,\u201d George said. \u201cI\u2019m less than a year away from being an adult. I need this. I need to get my own justice. You know how I feel. You must\u2019ve cared for her. Why would you stop me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook at me.\u201d She waited until he met her gaze. \u201cNo. We will do our part, and the two of you will take care of Rose. You have my word that the slavers will pay for what they\u2019ve done. I\u2019ll fight them until I end them, or they end me. This is my battle, and you will stay out of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly,\u201d Richard said, opening the door.</p><p>Jack slipped into the room.</p><p>\u201cYour sister will need support.\u201d Richard stepped inside and shut the door.</p><p>\u201cShe has Declan,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>Richard turned to him, his face suddenly hard. Charlotte fought an urge to step back, and Jack tensed.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s your duty to take care of your family, and Rose and your brother are the only family you have left now. A man doesn\u2019t avoid his responsibilities. Do I make myself clear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCrystal,\u201d George said.</p><p>\u201cTonight, a slaver ship will dock in a secret location,\u201d Richard said. \u201cYou will watch us board it, and you will deliver the name of the ship to your brother-in-law. He will trace it. In the event things don\u2019t go as planned, he will at least have that information. That\u2019s as much as I\u2019m willing to let you do.\u201d</p><p>Jack opened his mouth.</p><p>\u201cThink before you say anything.\u201d Richard\u2019s voice held no mercy. \u201cBecause unlike my brother, I have no qualms about hogtying the two of you and paying Barlo to sit on your bodies until we\u2019re out to sea.\u201d</p><p>Jack clamped his mouth shut.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll take it,\u201d George said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSmart move.

Letting them have a token part in this revenge will ease that anger. Otherwise, their grief will drive them into doing something rash, and neither of us will have an opportunity to save them from the consequences.\u201d</p><p>It was obviously a mistake. \u201cHow are you planning to keep them from getting on that ship?\u201d</p><p>Richard smiled. \u201cGeorge gave me his word. Honor is important to him.\u201d</p> <p>How can a smart man be such an idiot? \u201cRichard, did you feel how much magic that boy expended? If he cared about his grandmother that much, some faint notion of manly honor isn\u2019t going to stop him from getting his revenge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy lady, we agreed you wouldn\u2019t question me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy lord, this will end in disaster.\u201d</p><p>He smiled, a narrow sardonic smile. \u201cThen you\u2019ll get to tell me, \u2018I told you so.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Like arguing with a brick wall. Charlotte opened the door and walked out.</p><p>She had to remember why she was doing this: she sacrificed and killed so nobody else would suffer the way these children were suffering now. She would deal with Richard, and she would get on that ship. When she was done, the slavers would be little more than a scary story.</p> <p>SEVEN</p><p>NIGHT came far too quickly, Charlotte reflected, patting the muzzle of her horse. She stood under an oak. The wolf-dog sat by her feet and showed his teeth to anyone who came too close. In front of her, about forty people assembled in the clearing. The moon hid behind the ragged clouds, and what little illumination they had came from the tall torches thrust along the edge of the clearing.</p><p>About half of Jason\u2019s people, the \u201cslavers,\u201d wore an assortment of leather and carried weapons. The other half, mostly women in filthy clothes, busily tied knives and cudgels under their skirts and shirts. A few had on the Broken\u2019s jeans, others wore the Weird\u2019s dresses. Here and there clothes were being strategically ripped. A young woman walked around the gathering with a bucket of blood and a paintbrush, and smeared the red liquid on random bodies.</p><p>Richard was somewhere out there, getting ready. George and Jack had concealed themselves at a good observation point, ready to play their role in the mission. She and Richard had dropped the Draytons off half a mile away, with Richard giving them strict directions to stay out of sight, to which both teens informed them that it wasn\u2019t their first time.</p><p>\u201cBeautiful,\u201d Jason said next to her.</p><p>The dog growled low. She petted the big black head.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t heard Jason walk up. He wore a monk\u2019s cowl. Stripes of white paint crossed his nose and cheeks, while a horizontal black stripe darkened the skin around his eyes. He looked terrifying.</p><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t you be joining them?\u201d He nodded at the slaves.</p> <p>\u201cI suppose I should.\u201d She walked over and took her place between two \u201cslave\u201d women. The redhead with the bucket of blood stopped by her and casually painted some blood on her neck.</p><p>\u201cWhose blood is it?\u201d Charlotte asked.</p><p>The redhead shrugged. \u201cNo clue. Got it at the butcher shop.\u201d She moved on.</p><p>At least it wasn\u2019t human.</p><p>\u201cYou got a knife?\u201d a slender, filthy girl asked her. There was something familiar about her . . . Miko.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need one, thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake a knife.\u201d Miko offered her a curved, wicked-looking blade. \u201cIt might save your life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about you?\u201d</p><p>The girl grinned at her. \u201cI have several.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte took the blade, slid it into the waistband of her trousers, and pulled her tunic over it. She looked up and saw a ghost striding through the crowd toward her. Wide-shouldered, wearing a padded leather jacket, his hair in a ponytail, an eye patch covering his left eye, leading a black horse. His name was Crow, and she\u2019d killed him. She had watched him die in that clearing with the rest of the slaver crew.</p><p>Her heart hammered. She took a step back.</p><p>Crow kept coming.</p><p>That was fine. She would kill him again. The dark tendrils slipped out of her.</p><p>\u201cCharlotte?\u201d the one-eyed slaver said in Richard\u2019s voice.</p><p>She had always prided herself on excellent control of her magic. Between the moment her magic slithered out to kill him and the next instant, her brain made the connection, and she withdrew her power, aborting his murder in midstrike.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d she asked, sounding as normal as she could.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d No. No, please take me away from here. \u201cYou look older,\u201d she said, to say something. His face was covered with wrinkles.</p><p>\u201cLiquid latex,\u201d Richard said. \u201cProcessed tree sap mixed with water. If you slather it on your face, it will shrink as it dries, wrinkling the skin.\u201d</p><p>He resembled the dead man so much, it was uncanny.</p><p>Richard leaned toward her. \u201cOnce we get to the island, things will be chaotic. It\u2019s essential that we aren\u2019t separated. We must find the bookkeeper. He\u2019s our only lead to the top of the slaver ring.\u201d</p><p>A shrill whistle made them turn. Jason had mounted a horse.</p><p>\u201cWretches, scum, and villains,\u201d he called out. \u201cLend me your ears!\u201d</p><p>Light laughter rippled through the crowd.</p><p>\u201cEvery single one of you is owed a debt by the slavers. Tonight we collect. We\u2019ll board their ship. We\u2019ll sack the Market. We\u2019ll be legends.\u201d He paused and smiled. \u201cWe\u2019ll be rich.\u201d</p><p>An enthusiastic riot of catcalls and guttural grunts answered him.</p><p>He tilted his head. \u201cBut we don\u2019t do this just to get rich.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t?\u201d someone asked with pretended shock.</p><p>More laughter followed.</p><p>\u201cNo, we don\u2019t. Look around you.\u201d Jason spread his arms. \u201cGo ahead, look.\u201d</p><p>Heads turned as people looked at the woods and the night sky.</p><p>\u201cTonight, we\u2019re the masters of all we see. Tonight, we will triumph and grind those bastards under our boots. We\u2019ll take their money and their lives.\u201d His voice gained a savage intensity. \u201cWe\u2019ll listen as they scream and beg us for mercy. We\u2019ll smell the gore as we cut them open and bathe our hands in their blood. We\u2019ll gouge the light out of their eyes. Tonight, we\u2019ll truly live!\u201d</p><p>Silence claimed the clearing.</p><p>\u201cHell, yeah!\u201d Richard barked in a deep voice.</p><p>\u201cYeah!\u201d another male snarl echoed.</p><p>The crowd erupted in shouts, shaking their fists.</p><p>\u201cHe gets carried away sometimes,\u201d Richard told her under his breath.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t say.\u201d More violence. More murder. More joy as her magic devoured lives. Charlotte swallowed. She vividly remembered the seductive rush of pleasure she had derived from killing the slavers, and experiencing it again terrified her to the very core. Her teeth chattered. She clenched them, and her knees began to shake.</p><p>\u201cWe move!\u201d Jason roared.</p><p>Around her, people picked up their gear. She wanted to turn around and run the other way.</p><p>\u201cMay I?\u201d Richard asked, holding a pair of cuffs.</p><p>She raised her hands. Carefully, Richard placed the pair of handcuffs on her wrists. \u201cTwist like this, and they\u2019ll open.\u201d</p><p>The cuffs felt so heavy on her wrists. Charlotte forced herself to nod.</p><p>His fingers brushed her hands, the rough sword master\u2019s calluses they bore scraping her skin. His hands were warm. She looked up at him, asking for reassurance.</p><p>He met her gaze. \u201cI won\u2019t let anything happen to you, my lady.\u201d</p><p>He said \u201cmy lady\u201d as if it was a term of endearment. There was such quiet conviction in his voice that, for a moment, the clearing and everyone around them faded away. It was just the two of them, and he was touching her hands and looking at her in that particular way, concerned, almost tender. Such a strange emotion in the eyes of a man who was a killer. Her worry melted into the air. If only she could walk right next to him, with him holding her, nothing could hurt her.</p><p>\u201cForm two lines,\u201d Jason called out. \u201cSlaves in the middle, slavers on the sides.\u201d</p><p>Reality rushed at her in a terrifying avalanche. What she was doing, standing with him like this, was wildly inappropriate. She didn\u2019t care.</p><p>\u201cStay safe,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYou, too.\u201d</p><p>Richard released her and nodded to the dog. \u201cCome.\u201d</p><p>The beast hesitated.</p><p>\u201cCome,\u201d Richard ordered. The big beast rose off his haunches and trotted over to Richard. Richard locked a long chain on the dog\u2019s collar, mounted his horse, and took position next to Jason. The women formed two lines behind her and Miko, and they started down the road, the \u201cslavers\u201d on horses around them.</p><p>They trudged down the trail. The oaks ended, and the marsh began, a perfectly uniform field of low grasses. The trail veered left and right, cut in the grass. The horses clopped through the slushy, oversaturated soil, their hoofs splattering her clothes and face with mud.</p><p>The anxiety returned full force. Charlotte knew they\u2019d only been walking for a few minutes, but this trek through the vast field of mud seemed endless. It felt like she was marching through some extended nightmare to her death. The wind rose up, flinging the salty smell of the ocean into her face.</p><p>She thought of Tulip\u2019s ashen eyes, and \u00c9l\u00e9onore\u2019s charred body, and George\u2019s haunting voice. \u201cPlease, M\u00e9m\u00e8re . . .\u201d</p><p>She would stop it. No matter how much it cost her.</p><p>An eternity later, the marsh gave way to sandy dunes rough with clumps of sea-oat grass and blanketed with patches of short, creeping grass with wide leaves. Thin spires, like the stamens of a water lily, rose between the leaves, glowing with green, and as the breeze touched them, they swayed, sending dots of brilliant emerald into the night. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t step on those,\u201d Miko said next to her. \u201cThat\u2019s fisherman\u2019s trap grass. It will burn your legs.\u201d</p><p>They crossed the dunes and finally stepped onto the beach. In front of her, the ocean stretched, dark and menacing. To the left, the coast curved, forming a small peninsula, cutting off her view with trees. To the right, the distant turquoise lights of Kelena shimmered, like a mirage above the water.</p><p>\u201cThree torches,\u201d Richard said. \u201cOne in front, two in the back, about twenty feet apart.\u201d</p> <p>A \u201cslaver\u201d on her right slid off his horse, took three torches out of his saddlebag, ran forward, thrust the first torch into the sand, and lit it.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a dark night,\u201d Jason said.</p><p>\u201cDark works for us,\u201d Richard said.</p><p>The third torch flared into life. They waited.</p><p>The dog strayed back, the chain stretching, and licked her hand.</p> <p>The dark silhouette of a brigantine slid from behind the peninsula.</p><p>GEORGE lay on his stomach atop a sand dune. A small black box rested on the sand in front of him. Below, the false slavers and their \u201ccaptives\u201d waited on the beach. In the distance, the brigantine dropped anchor. It was a Weird-style ship, with six segmented masts that rose in a semicircle from the deck, like the wings of a water bird about to take flight. The masts bore panes of gray-green sails. In the open sea, the sails melted against the sky, making the ship harder to see.</p><p>M\u00e9m\u00e8re was dead. It had been six months since he\u2019d last seen her. She had come up to visit for a week at Midwinter. He remembered her face as if he\u2019d seen her yesterday. He remembered her smile. The scent of lavender that always floated around her. He knew that scent so well, that years later catching a whiff of it calmed him down.</p><p>When he was younger, M\u00e9m\u00e8re was a constant presence in his life. He barely remembered his mother. She was a distant smudge in his memory. He recalled his father better, a large, funny man. When he was eight, he was invited to a friend\u2019s house in the Broken. He was given a choice of movies to watch, and as he flipped through the cases, he saw a man in a leather jacket and a wide-brimmed hat, holding a whip. The title read Raiders of the Lost Ark. He\u2019d read the description and realized that this strange man, Indiana Jones, did the same thing his father did. He hunted treasure.</p><p>He\u2019d watched the movie twice in a row, which was probably why he was never invited back. But as he\u2019d grown older, maturity had given him a new perspective. His father wasn\u2019t Indiana Jones, no matter how much he wanted it to be true. His father had abandoned them when they needed him most, forcing Rose to take on all the responsibility of caring for them. There were days she\u2019d come home so tired she could hardly move\u2014once she even fell asleep in the kitchen while peeling potatoes.</p><p>But M\u00e9m\u00e8re was always there. Her house served as their safe haven. No matter what trouble he would get into or how much Rose was mad at him, M\u00e9m\u00e8re was always there with hugs, cookies, and old books. She was there the first time his magic showed itself. He was three years old. He\u2019d been playing in the yard when he saw a squirrel. She had a bushy tail and fluffy red fur, and she didn\u2019t seem afraid of him. She just sat on the trunk. He wanted to pet her, so he started moving closer and closer, one tiny step at a time. He was almost there; and then she fell off the trunk and died.</p> <p>He\u2019d picked up the fluffy body. He didn\u2019t really understand death. He just knew that she wasn\u2019t moving. He wanted her to move, but she wouldn\u2019t. She just hung in his hands, limp, like an old toy. He remembered a feeling of stark terror. For a second he\u2019d thought he would die too, just like the squirrel, then something pulled on him, hurting, and the squirrel turned and looked at him.</p><p>He\u2019d dropped her and ran, across the yard and up the porch. He must\u2019ve screamed because his grandmother had run out onto the porch and scooped him up. He\u2019d buried his face in her shoulder, and she hugged him. A ghost of her voice fluttered from his memory: \u201cIt will be all right. It\u2019s a gift, Georgie. Nothing to be afraid of. It\u2019s a gift . . .\u201d</p><p>George locked his teeth. Six months ago, he\u2019d asked her again to move to the Weird. They had been sitting on the balcony drinking tea. She was leaving to return to the Edge later that day, and a feeling of dread had smothered him, heavy, like a wet blanket. In his mind, she looked exactly the same as she had been when he was little, but now every time she visited, he noticed incremental, alarming changes. Her hair was thinning. Her wrinkles cut deeper into her face. She seemed smaller somehow. It made him ill with worry.</p><p>\u201cPlease stay,\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, dear. I live in the Edge. That\u2019s where I belong. This is very nice, but it\u2019s not for me.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d helped her get into the phaeton that morning. She\u2019d kissed him good-bye.</p><p>He should\u2019ve done more. He should\u2019ve insisted. He should\u2019ve compelled her to stay. If he really had begged, she would have. How could he have been so careless and stupid? Now she was dead. He didn\u2019t even know how she died, if she had burned alive in that damn house . . . he closed his eyes tightly, stopping the tears from welling up.</p><p>He would have to tell Rose.</p> <p>The brigantine was lowering two boats. The people on the beach waited patiently.</p><p>\u201cWe should be down there,\u201d Jack said next to him.</p><p>But they weren\u2019t. Of the two Mar brothers, Kaldar was the more malleable. His ethics had flexible boundaries, and he bent, if the wind was strong enough. But George had taken sword-fighting lessons from Richard over the past year. Richard was like a granite crag in a storm, immovable and resolute. The look in his eyes had told George he wouldn\u2019t be getting his way. Not this time.</p><p>His Mirror assignment was over. George had failed. Jason Parris had identified him as an Adrianglian agent, and he\u2019d already sent the dispatch to the Home Office. Erwin wouldn\u2019t be pleased, but right now his handler\u2019s disappointment was the least of George\u2019s worries. He would watch Richard and Charlotte get on the ship; and then he and Jack would be forced to go home like good little children. Inside, he was screaming.</p><p>The boats pulled away from the vessel, speeding across the water, driven by magic-fueled motors. The magic residue slid off the propellers, turning their wake into a glowing trail of yellow-and-emerald radiance.</p><p>Small tongues of green lightning flared at the brigantine\u2019s aft. They had a cloaking device, and they were priming it. Of course. The South Fleet of Adrianglia possessed three corsair-class vessels, five hunters, and an aerial-support dreadnought. Each carried pulverizer cannons as well as a host of other deadly toys. A fast and light civilian brigantine like this one couldn\u2019t take more than one or two shots. Its best strategy lay in speed and in not being detected in the first place, which is where the cloaking device would come in handy.</p><p>A cloaking device was also hellishly expensive. The slave trade must\u2019ve served them well. He ground his teeth again.</p><p>Jack bared his teeth, his voice a vicious whisper. \u201cStop grinding your teeth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up,\u201d George whispered back.</p><p>\u201cIt bugs me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCover your ears, then.\u201d</p><p>The crooked ribbons of magic lightning built. George opened the box he\u2019d brought. Inside was a single glass bubble. He twisted it open, plucked out a glass lens edged with tiny metal cilia, and slid it into his eye. The lens\u2019s delicate metal tendrils moved, searching, and locked onto his nerves. The pain shot straight into his brain, as if someone had hammered a wooden spike through his eye socket. The Mirror\u2019s gadgets could do incredible things, but they always came with a price. He shook his head and looked up. The brigantine slid into clear, sharp focus, as though he were standing right next to it. He could see the carved sides and the slender lines of the ship\u2019s rigging. If this brigantine followed the Adrianglian Maritime Code, the name would be near the bow.</p><p>Next to him, Jack growled. \u201cAre we just going to lay here like idiots?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, we are.\u201d</p><p>Lightning dashed from the stern toward the bow, dancing over the vessel\u2019s sides, illuminating the ship. That was the moment he was waiting for. He trailed the lightning with his gaze.</p><p>\u201cThis is wrong,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>\u201cWe stay put.\u201d</p><p>The green sparks illuminated the name, written in thick black letters on the bow, and faded into darkness. George sucked in his breath.</p><p>No. No, he must have read it wrong.</p><p>He waited for another flash.</p><p>\u201cGeorge, breathe,\u201d Jack growled into his ear.</p><p>The lightning flashed, illuminating the letters once more. It still said the same thing. George went cold. There could be only two possibilities for this ship to be here now, and he couldn\u2019t deal with either.</p><p>Again. He had to see it again.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is the matter with you?\u201d Jack hissed.</p><p>The magic sparked off the boards, and he read the name again, for the third time, each letter like the stab of a sword into his gut.</p><p>George yanked the lens out of his eye. \u201cWe have to get down there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said we had to stay put.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd now I\u2019m saying we have to get down there.\u201d</p><p>He slithered backward off the dune and took off running toward the beach.</p><p>Jack caught up with him. They went to ground again just behind the \u201cslaves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Jack whispered, barely audible.</p><p>George paused for a second, weighing Jack\u2019s right to know against his explosive temper. If Jack blew up, they would never get on that ship.</p><p>He deserved to know. Better do it now.</p><p>\u201cBecause that ship\u2019s name is Intrepid Drayton.\u201d</p><p>Jack recoiled. For a moment he thought it over, and then the right gears caught in his mind. He made the connection between their last name and the name of the ship. His eyes sparked with fire. \u201cDid they kill Dad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs Dad selling slaves?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe left us to rot in the Edge so he could sell slaves?\u201d A snarl roiled through Jack\u2019s voice. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>George grabbed his shoulder. \u201cHold it in. Not until we\u2019re on board and know exactly what\u2019s going on.\u201d</p><p>Jack ducked his head, hiding the changeling glow of his eyes, and sucked in the air through his nose.</p><p>They would have only one shot at this. The boats had to be close enough for Richard to be unable to do anything about their presence but far enough away that the sailors wouldn\u2019t see any commotion.</p> <p>George took a deep breath.</p><p>The leading boat rolled over the surf, its crew distracted.</p><p>Now.</p><p>George lunged forward, and Jack followed. They dashed into the line of slaves and thrust themselves behind Charlotte.</p><p>\u201cWhat the devil are you doing?\u201d Richard growled under his breath.</p> <p>He didn\u2019t even turn. The man must have eyes in the back of his head.</p><p>\u201cChanging the plan.\u201d George ripped off a piece of his shirt and twisted it around Jack\u2019s hands into a makeshift tie.</p><p>\u201cGo back,\u201d Charlotte hissed.</p><p>Richard dismounted and walked toward George, pulling a pair of handcuffs off his belt. They stood face-to-face, Richard glaring down from the height of an extra four inches. It was a furious glare suffused with so much menace, it could end a riot. George stared straight into it. Today, he had the will to match it.</p><p>\u201cYou gave me your word,\u201d Richard ground out.</p><p>George took a step forward, his voice barely above a whisper, meant for Richard alone. \u201cThe vessel\u2019s name is Intrepid Drayton. Before Earl Camarine adopted me, my last name was Drayton. There is a painting of that ship in my dead grandmother\u2019s house.\u201d</p> <p>He took the cuffs out of Richard\u2019s hands and slipped them onto his own wrists with a click. \u201cIt\u2019s my father\u2019s ship. Either the slavers killed my father and took his vessel, or he\u2019s working for them, and he\u2019s responsible for his own mother\u2019s death. I need to know which it is. If you stand in my way, I will move you, Richard.\u201d</p><p>FOR a moment Richard stood there, glowering, then he checked the cuffs on George\u2019s wrists. \u201cDon\u2019t do anything stupid.\u201d</p><p>He turned around and strode to the front, next to Jason.</p><p>George exhaled. To Richard, family was everything. He understood blood debts and the right to exact justice for one\u2019s family, but it had been a gamble.</p><p>His father couldn\u2019t work for the slavers. Even he couldn\u2019t have sunk that low. Even Rose, who bordered on hating the man, always said that he was never mean or violent. Opportunistic, unwise, and selfish, yes. Could he be selfish enough to work for the slavers? George was thinking in circles. He had to get a grip.</p><p>The boats landed, their flat bottoms scraping the sand with a soft sibilance. An older man stepped out first, followed by four other sailors. Tall and broad-shouldered, he walked like a sailor, lurching slightly with each step, planting his feet firmly on the ground.</p><p>George peered at him, noting every detail. Gray eyes, dishwater-blond hair, cut short, older face, once probably handsome, but puffy from lack of sleep and likely too much alcohol, graying stubble on the cheeks . . . Was it him? He strained, trying to remember, but in his memory his father\u2019s face was a vague blur. He used to remember. He used to know what his dad looked like, but the years had passed, and now the memories were lost.</p><p>\u201cCrow,\u201d the man said. \u201cWhere\u2019s Voshak?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHunter got him,\u201d Richard answered, his voice a ragged growl. \u201cShot him on the edge of Veresk as we were riding out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Ceyren?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot him, too. Arrow to the eye. A fucked-up thing to see.\u201d</p><p>The man sighed. \u201cThat\u2019s what he usually does. Somebody should take care of that fucker. He\u2019s cutting into our profits.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone will take him down,\u201d Richard-Crow hacked and spat in the sand. \u201cAin\u2019t gonna be me, I tell you that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hear you.\u201d The man looked past Richard at the slaves. \u201cYou did well for yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid all right,\u201d Richard-Crow agreed.</p><p>Maybe it wasn\u2019t him. Maybe the slavers had killed him and someone else captained the ship. It would be far better if their father was dead than profiting from the murder of his own mother. Say your name, George willed silently.</p><p>\u201cI take it you\u2019ll be coming on board instead of Voshak,\u201d the man said.</p><p>\u201cMe and everyone you see here,\u201d Richard-Crow growled.</p><p>The man raised his eyebrows.</p><p>Richard stepped forward, leaning in as if ready to punch. \u201cI\u2019ve been on a crew for four years. First, they gave the crew to Bes. Then, when his old lady killed him, they gave it to Carter. After Carter got his dumb ass shot, I went to them and told them to give me a crew. They said I ain\u2019t got leadership potential. They gave it to Voshak instead. Well, their damn leadership potential is rotting in the woods. This is my crew, and I\u2019m taking my wolves in to let them see that.\u201d</p><p>The sailor raised his hand. \u201cOkay, okay. I got it, spitting wonder. I don\u2019t get involved in politics. I just ferry the merchandise. You want a ride to the island, you got it. Load them up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMove them,\u201d Richard snarled.</p><p>A whip snapped above George\u2019s head. The slavers started forward, toward the boats. He was being herded like human cattle.</p><p>George moved, following Charlotte. He was hot and cold at the same time, every cell of his body keyed up, as if the core of his body were boiling. Sweat drenched his hairline.</p><p>The sailor\u2019s gaze snagged on Charlotte. \u201cNice. I was always a sucker for a blonde with a good rack.\u201d</p><p>George shut his eyes for the tiniest moment, trying to recall what little memories remained from his childhood. Was Mother blond? He strained, searching through the vague recollections . . . His eyes snapped open. She was blond. He was sure of it.</p><p>It didn\u2019t mean anything. Many men liked blond women.</p><p>The sailor was looking directly at him. \u201cGood-looking boys. Aren\u2019t they too old for the Market? They like their kids younger.\u201d</p><p>George\u2019s stomach churned with acid. Next to him, Jack clenched his fists. A drop of blood slid between his fingers onto the pale scrap of fabric tied around his hands.</p><p>Hold it in, George prayed.</p><p>\u201cSpecial order,\u201d Richard said.</p><p>The sailor grimaced. \u201cNever understood that myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs long as they pay me.\u201d Richard spat again.</p><p>George climbed into the boat, Jack at his heels, and stared at the sailor on the beach. Say your damn name.</p><p>The sailor grinned. \u201cHello, my lords and ladies. My name is John Drayton. I\u2019ll be your captain this evening.\u201d</p><p>A hot, invisible knife stabbed George straight in the pit of his stomach. The world gained a red tint. Logic told him it was the capillaries in his eyes expanding in reaction to his increased blood flow, but that logic spoke from some distant place in his brain, and he shut it off. Grandmother was dead, and the scumbag who was her son and his father made his money from playing captain to her murderers. John Drayton trafficked in slaves. He had abandoned his children, so he could get rich off of other people\u2019s misery. He might as well have killed his own mother with his own hands. He was responsible.</p><p>\u201cWelcome aboard Intrepid Drayton for your island cruise. You\u2019ll notice bluefin sharks following our ship. If you make any trouble, we\u2019ll tie a line around your neck and toss you overboard. The bluefins like a little chase before their dinner. You behave, and they\u2019ll go hungry. Personally, I hope you don\u2019t\u2014I enjoy a little spectacle. Brightens up a boring voyage.\u201d</p><p>He had to kill his father, to bring him to justice. It was the only right thing to do.</p><p>A soothing current of magic prickled his skin. His heartbeat slowed.</p><p>\u201cSit by me, George,\u201d Charlotte called, her voice like a rush of cold water onto his scalding anger. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>He forced himself to turn around. She sat in the bottom of the barge, her hand resting on Jack\u2019s forearm. His brother\u2019s head was down, the mass of brown hair hanging over his face. A hoarse, strained sound, a muted, controlled snarl, emanated from Jack with every breath. His brother was teetering on the verge of losing his human form.</p><p>They still had a job to do. They had to get to the island. His vengeance would have to wait. His legs felt wooden. He couldn\u2019t make himself move.</p><p>A hard wooden baton smashed in the back of his knees. George crashed down.</p><p>\u201cSit the fuck down,\u201d one of Jason\u2019s slavers said.</p><p>\u201cI see we have the first candidate for the shark feeding,\u201d his father called. \u201cOne more, boy, and I\u2019ll personally shove you off my deck.\u201d</p><p>George forced himself to sit next to Charlotte. She was watching the rest of the slaves board, her face calm.</p><p>\u201cThere will be a time later,\u201d she said, her quiet voice laced with menace. \u201cWe won\u2019t have to wait long.\u201d</p><p>EIGHT</p><p>CHARLOTTE closed her eyes and listened to the waves splash against the hull. Two hours ago, they had been loaded inside the hold of the ship, slaves first, then the slavers. John Drayton was a careful man who locked up his passengers, willing and unwilling. Richard and Jason were the only two men who had remained above on deck.</p><p>George and Jack sat on the floor near the bulkhead. Jack\u2019s shoulders, rigid with tension, slumped forward. He hasn\u2019t said a word since they boarded, but she had seen his eyes. A violent, furious thing stared at her through his irises. Something savage lived inside Jack, and he was using all of his power to hold it at bay. She wanted to tell him she knew exactly how he felt, but her instincts warned her that any stray word could tip the balance in that thing\u2019s favor. She had treated changelings before, or rather she\u2019d treated the changeling soldiers, the hardened, barely human killers who had come out of the crucible of the Adrianglian changeling academy. If Jack lost control now, in the hold, none of them would survive it.</p><p>George knew it, too. He sat next to his brother, hovering protectively over him. His eyes were clear with determination, his face sharpened with grief and anger. He felt betrayed, and he wanted revenge, and she didn\u2019t blame him one bit.</p><p>Anger filled her too, and she held on to it, letting herself steep in it, solidifying her resolve. John Drayton, \u00c9l\u00e9onore\u2019s long-lost son. Not so lost anymore. She pictured his smug smile. \u201cGood-looking kids.\u201d They are your children, you heartless bastard. It wasn\u2019t enough their grandmother is dead, now you\u2019re indirectly responsible for her murder. She wished she could strangle the swine, but he was upstairs. This one life she would\u2019ve taken with pleasure. She glanced at the boys again. Yes, with pleasure. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Charlotte glanced out the narrow porthole, little more than an air vent. The ship had activated a cloaking device the moment they raised anchor. A dense cloud of magic-infused fog slid over the vessel, wrapping it like a blanket. The myriad tiny droplets of water that created the mist acted as countless minuscule mirrors, busily reflecting the ship\u2019s surroundings. An outside observer wouldn\u2019t see the ship. He might perhaps notice a smudge against the perfect line of water and sky. In bright daylight, this distortion would be quite obvious, but at night, with the mist rising from the water, the Intrepid Drayton was practically invisible. Unfortunately, from the inside, the reflective fog was opaque and all she saw now was a dense curtain of mist.</p><p>They must\u2019ve been sailing for at least an hour or two. Time stretched here, inside the hold.</p><p>\u201cI want out of this damn ship. How are we gonna get out of here?\u201d a blond woman next to her murmured to Miko. \u201cWe can\u2019t kill the sailors until we get to port, and if we kill them when we get there, there will be a commotion.\u201d</p> <p>The slender girl nodded at Charlotte. \u201cShe\u2019s our key.\u201d</p><p>The blond woman stared at her. \u201cYou don\u2019t look like much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLooks can be deceiving,\u201d Charlotte told her.</p><p>\u201cThey better be.\u201d The blond woman bared her teeth. \u201cBecause if they lead me out of this bucket in chains and into the slave pens, you\u2019ll be the first I come after. You\u2019ve got a skinny throat. Easy to cut.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte\u2019s magic stirred in response to the menace in the woman\u2019s voice, bubbling to the surface. She kept it in check and stared back at the blond woman with disdain.</p> <p>The woman yanked a knife from inside her rags.</p><p>Miko stepped in her way and hissed. \u201cDon\u2019t be stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you see the way she looked at me? Like I\u2019m gutter trash, and she\u2019s the Marchesa of Louisiana. I\u2019ll cut her throat!\u201d</p><p>Miko moved and suddenly there were two slender blades in her hands. \u201cYou are gutter trash, Lynda. Jason has a plan. You fuck with his plan, you fuck with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got a big mouth for such a dumb bitch. About time someone shut it for you.\u201d</p><p>Lynda lunged forward. Miko spun, thrusting, and the woman crumpled to the boards, gurgling on her blood.</p> <p>Miko turned, one arm held high, the other low, blood dripping from her knives, and surveyed the hold. \u201cAnybody else want to fuck with the plan?\u201d</p><p>Nobody volunteered.</p><p>Lynda writhed on the floor, hot, dark blood spreading around her on the wood. Charlotte let her magic lick at her. External jugular vein cut, internal jugular vein partially nicked, rapid blood loss, estimated time of death: two to three minutes. A familiar sense of obligation tugged at Charlotte, but this time it wasn\u2019t backed by kindness, only habit.</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to heal her?\u201d Charlotte asked.</p><p>\u201cNo. One less psycho.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen finish it. She\u2019s suffering.\u201d</p><p>Miko dropped down on one knee. The knife rose, plunged down, and Lynda stopped struggling.</p><p>The door swung open, revealing Richard. About time.</p> <p>He motioned to her. Charlotte approached.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re about to make landfall,\u201d he whispered. \u201cThere are nineteen sailors on this boat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the captain?\u201d she asked, glancing at the boys.</p><p>Two pairs of eyes stared back at her, one of them glowing amber.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s ours,\u201d Jack said, his voice a ragged, inhuman growl. People backed away from him.</p><p>\u201cWait until I call you,\u201d Richard said, and looked to her. \u201cSailors only.\u201d</p><p>She raised her chin. \u201cVery well. Let\u2019s get this over with.\u201d</p><p>Richard turned and climbed the ladder up to the deck. She followed. The ship sliced through the blue-green waters and the salty breeze, barely skimming the surface of the ocean, its grandiose sails spread wide. The dense barrier of magic fog surrounded it on all sides except for the prow, where the curtain parted. Orange and blue lights winked through the gap\u2014their destination.</p><p>Sailors moved along the deck. Some sat, some talked quietly. Richard pulled her against the cabin and braced her with his big body, hiding her from the rest of the crew. She rested her hands on his leather-encased body, feeling the comforting strength of his muscular shoulders. It felt so intimate standing like this. It was almost an embrace. She knew she was reading too much into it, but she needed an embrace so badly.</p><p>Something brushed against her. She glanced down. The wolfripper hound leaned against her legs.</p><p>\u201cHow fast do you need them to die?\u201d she whispered. She was so angry, and they were scum who ferried slaves and fed children to sharks. She would extinguish their lives.</p><p>\u201cAt the speed we\u2019re going, we\u2019ll dock in fifteen minutes. They\u2019re about to light the colors,\u201d he said. \u201cThe port is likely armed with cannons. They will send a challenge signal. We must send the proper reply, or they\u2019ll consider us hostile. Once the reply is accepted, they\u2019re yours. Kill them as quickly and quietly as you can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChallenge!\u201d someone called out.</p><p>Richard leaned over to glance at the bow of the ship. She did, too.</p><p>A pale green flare shot upward from the port. Charlotte held her breath, waiting.</p><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s green again, they grant us safe passage,\u201d Richard whispered in her ear, his breath a hot cloud.</p><p>\u201cLight the colors,\u201d a deep voice bellowed from the deck above them. \u201cOne two, two two, one three!\u201d</p><p>Magic dashed up the masts. Arcane symbols ignited on the surface of the sails, one each in those on the middle mast and the third in the sails of the center mast on the left side.</p><p>A second green flare blossomed in the night sky.</p><p>The deep voice barked a string of nautical nonsense. The crew sped about the ship, spinning wheels, adjusting metal levers in the control consoles by the masts. The sails shrunk. The segmented masts began to straighten slowly.</p><p>\u201cNow,\u201d Richard said.</p><p>The monstrous magic in her chest stirred, waking. She listened to it, sorting through the plagues she carried within, until she found one that felt right.</p><p>A sailor brushed by them. \u201cHey, Crow, who have you got there?\u201d</p><p>Charlotte reached out above Richard\u2019s shoulder and gently caressed the man\u2019s weathered face. Her magic rose from her in narrow dark streams, like the tentacles of an octopus, and bit into him. He barely noticed. His skin fractured under her fingertips, sloughing off in tiny white scales of epithelium glistening with magic, and the breeze carried them on, down to the rest of the crew. The man stared at her, seemingly mesmerized but really just dying very quickly. The skin of his face turned to powder, as if he\u2019d dipped his head into a bucket of silvery flour.</p><p>Her magic wrapped around him, draining his reserves, and withdrew. The wind stirred the powder that used to be the top layers of his skin, blowing it off. The tiny particles caught on his eyelashes. He sighed and crumpled down softly.</p><p>Richard turned, still shielding her, to look over his shoulder. The sailors began to fall one by one, silent, soft, each releasing a cloud of scaly powder as they sank unmoving to the deck.</p><p>They were bad people who deserved their deaths, yet she felt a crushing sadness at their passing all the same. She buried it away, deep inside, wrapping it in the layers of her anger and resolve. There would be time for self-pity later.</p><p>Richard had the strangest expression on his face. Not quite shock, not quite panic, but an odd mix of awe and astonishment, as if he couldn\u2019t believe what he saw.</p><p>At the far end of the ship, Jason Parris turned, his eyes wide, as the sailors around him folded like deflated balloons. The dog raised his muzzle to the moon and howled, his lonely cry floating above the waves like a mourning wail.</p><p>Above them something thumped quietly. A man tumbled from the upper deck, his face ashen with powder. Richard lunged at him, trying to catch the body to keep it from making a loud thud. But a gust of wind beat him to it\u2014four feet from the deck the body broke into a cloud of particles. They slid harmlessly from Richard\u2019s skin and melted into the breeze.</p><p>He turned to her. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhite leprosy,\u201d she said. It was a terrible disease. She had fought it before, she knew all its little habits and quirks, and she had twisted them with her magic just enough to turn it into her silent assassin. He would think twice about letting her touch him now. Something inside her contracted at that thought.</p><p>\u201cJack,\u201d Richard said, his voice low. \u201cTell them the ship is ours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe can\u2019t hear you,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cJack has good ears,\u201d Richard reminded her.</p><p>Sure enough, Jason\u2019s crew poured out of the cargo hold and spread across the deck, people taking up positions where the sailors once stood. People kicked the fallen bodies overboard. The corpses broke in the wind.</p><p>Someone gasped. She saw panic in some faces.</p><p>\u201cTell Silver Death thank you for the pretty ship,\u201d Jason said to them. \u201cAnd stop gaping. We still need to bring this baby to port.\u201d</p><p>There was no escape. Death was now a part of her name.</p><p>George and Jack emerged from the crowd.</p><p>\u201cI need you to guard your father,\u201d Richard said. \u201cThere are things he knows that we need. If you can\u2019t help yourself, tell me now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do it,\u201d George said. \u201cJack will need a few moments to vent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m counting on you, George. This is your only second chance. If I come back and he\u2019s dead, you and I are done. Do not harm your father.\u201d</p><p>The boy reached behind his neck and pulled a long, slender blade from inside his clothes. \u201cUnderstood. I\u2019ll keep him in perfect health.\u201d</p><p>Richard rapped his hands on the door of the cabin.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Drayton called.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a problem,\u201d Richard replied in his normal voice.</p><p>The door swung open, revealing Drayton with a rifle in his hands. He saw Jason\u2019s people and jerked the gun up.</p><p>Magic pulsed from George, dark and potent. A woman charged out of the crowd and grabbed the gun. Charlotte saw her face and nearly gagged. Lynda, her slit throat a red ribbon across her neck, her face still splattered with the spray of her own blood. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Drayton yanked the gun, but she hung on, blocking the barrels with her stomach. The slaver captain pulled the trigger. The muffled shot popped, like a dry firecracker, blowing small chunks of flesh from Lynda\u2019s back. The undead woman jerked the rifle out of Drayton\u2019s hand and broke it in half like a toothpick.</p><p>Drayton stumbled back.</p><p>Lynda dropped the broken rifle at George\u2019s feet. \u201cMaaaster,\u201d she whispered, her voice a sibilant mess. Her neck leaked tiny droplets of blood. She stared at George in complete adoration, like a loyal hound gazed at her owner. \u201cI love you, master.\u201d</p> <p>Behind her, Jack snarled like some nightmarish monster.</p><p>George\u2019s face showed no mercy. \u201cHello, Father.\u201d He took a step forward, pushing the bigger man into the cabin. \u201cLet\u2019s visit.\u201d</p><p>Lynda ducked in after him. The door swung shut.</p><p>Oh, George . . .</p><p>\u201cTo the bow,\u201d Richard said, resting his fingers lightly on her arm.</p> <p>She followed him to the front of the ship and came to stand by one of the control consoles, all bronze and copper gears encased in glass and enveloped by magic.</p><p>Her magic sang within her, the monster satiated but not fully satisfied. The more she fed it, the more sustenance it wanted. It wound and curled around her in dark currents, almost as if it were an entity of its own, and it loved her, like a loyal pet, existing to serve her and bring her comfort. All those endless hours of cautionary lectures she\u2019d heard within the walls of the College were right. Destruction was seductive and self-rewarding, while healing was an arduous chore.</p><p>She had taken a chance this time. Instead of siphoning off their lives to fuel her magic, she simply killed them, feeding the disease with her own power. Stealing other lives to feed her magic had felt too good. If she tasted it again, there was a chance she wouldn\u2019t stop, and she didn\u2019t want to risk it. Strangely, even though she had relied only on her own reserves, she didn\u2019t feel that drained. Killing was easier than the last time\u2014and the next time it would be easier still. She was on a slippery slope. She had to fight to keep from sliding down.</p><p>One of Jason\u2019s men came to stand by them, saw Charlotte still wrapped in magic, and halted in midstep, maintaining his distance. He looked at her, looked at the console, shifted from foot to foot uncomfortably . . .</p><p>\u201cWould you like me to move?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he exhaled.</p> <p>Charlotte took two steps to the right, away from the console and toward two other men near Jason, both looking like they crushed skulls for their living. The cutthroats shied from her, backing up. Jason held his ground, but his face locked into a hard, impersonal mask. He was deeply afraid and determined not to show it.</p><p>She felt utterly alone. So that\u2019s what it was like to be a pariah.</p><p>\u201cMy lady.\u201d Richard\u2019s fingers touched her arm.</p><p>She almost jumped.</p><p>He offered her his arm. \u201cMay I?\u201d</p><p>Charlotte rested her fingers on his forearm and stood next to him, painfully aware that their legs were almost touching and the streams of her magic wound about him. She dared to glance at him. His face was relaxed. He looked back at her and smiled, as if they had stopped during a stroll in a park to admire some flowers. It made her feel human.</p><p>Why, why didn\u2019t she take \u00c9l\u00e9onore up on the invitation to visit her family? Had she met Richard a year ago, things might have been so different. He was the kind of man she had always wanted to meet. Strong, honorable, and kind. He is also a killer, an annoying voice whispered in her mind. Well, so was she.</p><p>Too late now. They were on a ship sailing to deliver death. Romantic fantasies would get her nowhere. She\u2019d given up that luxury.</p> <p>Charlotte looked straight ahead. A large island loomed in the distance. Two ports hugged its coast. On the right, handsome piers of cut stone thrust into the ocean, flanked by graceful yachts and private boats. Picturesque palms spread their fanned leaves and wide roads, lit with blue and yellow lanterns, ran deeper inland, toward pastel-colored houses in shades of turquoise, white, yellow, and pink. To the left, rougher piers offered refuge to tugboats and barges, leading to a seedy boardwalk and hostile, dark streets. Farther to the left, a naval fort of gray stone stabbed the ocean, overseeing both ports.</p><p>\u201cWhere the hell are we?\u201d someone asked.</p><p>Richard swore, a quiet, savage sound under his breath, and caught himself. \u201cMy apologies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is this place?\u201d Charlotte asked.</p><p>\u201cThe Isle of Divine Na,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s an independent barony\u2014the Baron of Na purchased it from Adrianglia when the continent was being colonized. The entire place is one big luxury resort, full of tourists in the late summer and fall. See, the luxury port is in the north, and the commercial port, where we\u2019re heading, is to the south. We\u2019re barely three hours from Kelena. I\u2019ve looked at this island as a possibility for the Market but dismissed it because I thought it would be too risky to run a slave operation on an island full of vacationers. It was here all this time under my nose, and I missed it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t beat yourself up, old man.\u201d Jason grinned, patting Richard\u2019s shoulder. \u201cHappens to everyone.\u201d</p><p>Richard glared back at him, his composure slipping, and for a second she thought he\u2019d rip Jason\u2019s arm off and beat him with it.</p><p>She leaned closer to Richard, and murmured, \u201cIf you decide to throw him to the ground, I promise to kick him. Vigorously.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Richard said. \u201cI may take you up on it.\u201d He sounded sincere.</p><p>A green flare went up at the dock to the left.</p><p>\u201cThey want us to dock,\u201d one of the older men said to Jason.</p><p>\u201cThen dock us. Gently. We\u2019ll need this ship in one piece to get the hell out of here.\u201d</p><p>The man barked some orders. The ship slowed, approaching the dock in a graceful arc.</p><p>\u201cOne fort,\u201d Jason murmured, his face thoughtful.</p><p>\u201cIt has five long-range, flash-load cannons,\u201d Richard said.</p><p>The slaves formed up in two lines on the deck. Jack moved to the front.</p><p>\u201cWho the fuck put the kid on point?\u201d Jason took a step toward the lines.</p><p>\u201cLeave him where he is,\u201d Richard said. \u201cHe sat in the hold for two hours, holding himself in check. He needs to vent, and none of us needs to be in front of him.\u201d</p><p>The crime lord looked at Richard. \u201cHe\u2019s a kid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a changeling,\u201d Richard answered. \u201cYou\u2019ve never seen one fight. Give him the benefit of the doubt.\u201d</p><p>The faint hum of the cloaking device stopped abruptly. The fog dispersed. Charlotte hugged her shoulders, feeling suddenly exposed.</p><p>A metal chain clanged\u2014they\u2019d dropped the anchor. The ship slowed further, approaching the dock carefully, almost gently.</p><p>\u201cOnce we disembark and take the fort, take her out a few hundred yards,\u201d Jason said to one of his men. \u201cI don\u2019t want to strip this island and come back to a sunken ship.\u201d</p><p>Three dockhands waited on the wooden pier. Behind them, a crew of slavers waited, no doubt ready to receive the merchandise. Some of the slavers were female. Women were no less capable of cruelty than men.</p><p>Lines flew from the ship to the pier. The dockhands secured them.</p><p>\u201cLower the gangplank,\u201d Jason said.</p><p>Two men cranked a large wheel. A metal ramp slid from the ship\u2019s side toward the dock.</p><p>The moment it touched the stone, Jack started down the gangplank. The women followed him in two lines, still keeping their hands bound.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re eager for the slave pens, sweetheart?\u201d one of the slaver women asked.</p><p>Jack swayed. A psychotic grin stretched his lips. His face jerked, his expression feral.</p><p>A tall slaver stepped forward. \u201cCome her\u2014\u201d</p><p>Jack spun, leaping so fast, Charlotte barely saw the knife in his hand slice through the slaver\u2019s neck. Jack landed, catching the man\u2019s severed head by the hair, and hurled it at the slavers.</p><p>\u201cHoly shit,\u201d Jason said.</p><p>Her mind reeled at the amount of force it must\u2019ve taken to slice through the muscle and bone of a thick human neck with a knife.</p><p>The slavers froze, shocked, and Jack ripped into them like a pike into a school of minnows. Blood sprayed, people screamed in pain. The slaves abandoned their fake shackles and charged down to join the slaughter. The dog shot down the gangplank and into the thick of the fighting. She tried to keep up with Jack, but he darted in and out of the bloodbath. She caught a flash of his face\u2014he was smiling.</p><p>In two minutes, it was all over. Eight bodies lay on the ground. Jack shook himself and dashed down the dark street, melting into the gloom. The dog chased him. The women started moving after the two of them.</p><p>\u201cStop!\u201d Jason roared.</p><p>The pretend slaves halted.</p><p>\u201cFall in! Find your squad captain. Now.\u201d</p><p>The criminals separated with almost military discipline, forming four groups.</p><p>\u201cSquad one, slave pens,\u201d Jason barked. \u201cLet everyone out, set it on fire, kill whoever comes to put it out. The slaves will run wild, let them. Don\u2019t follow them. Squad two, hit the barracks and burn that shit to the ground. Kill as many as you can. Squad three, with me. I want these cannons, and I want them yesterday. Once we have the fort, a double green flare will go up. Squad four, hold the line here. Cut this port off from the city. Everyone, you see a red flare, we abort, and you get the hell out. Blue flare, haul ass to where it came from. Don\u2019t loot until I give the all clear. You stop to stuff your pockets before I tell you to, and I\u2019ll kill you myself. You get me?\u201d</p><p>The criminals howled in agreement.</p><p>\u201cGo!\u201d Jason yanked a large sword from under his cloak. \u201cGood luck, old man. Try not to get in my way.\u201d</p><p>He strode down the gangplank, his monk\u2019s habit flaring.</p><p>The criminals dispersed.</p><p>Richard held out a ragged gray cloak to her. \u201cI\u2019m wearing a disguise, but you aren\u2019t. Someone might recognize you.\u201d</p><p>It was unlikely, but there was no need to tempt fate. She put on the cloak, hiding her face in its deep hood, and adjusted her bag of first-aid supplies under the folds. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Richard unsheathed his sword. The slight curve of the long, slender blade caught the light from the lanterns.</p><p>\u201cOur turn,\u201d Richard said. \u201cWe must find the bookkeeper. Stay close to me.\u201d</p><p>RICHARD marched down the gangplank, keenly aware of Charlotte following him. The Broken was forever closed to him, but its books were not, and he\u2019d read extensively about the Broken\u2019s military traditions. As a Marine, Jason was trained in the art of small wars. His particular branch of the military evolved to respond to an enemy employing asymmetric warfare, the tactic that involved striking against the vulnerabilities of the opponent rather than seeking to eliminate the bulk of its force. Jason would take a page out of that playbook: he would deliver brutal precision strikes against the vital points of the island, he would drown the island city in chaos and confusion, demoralizing the enemy and severing communication, then he would eliminate the fractured opposition. He would be ruthless and impossible to rein in, but he couldn\u2019t blockade the entire island.</p> <p>They had to hurry, before the bookkeeper caught on and attempted his escape. They needed his information.</p><p>He veered left, following the cobbled streets at a rapid walk. He would\u2019ve liked to run, but Charlotte\u2019s face had turned chalk pale after she\u2019d eliminated the crew, and the color still hadn\u2019t returned. He didn\u2019t want to push her.</p><p>What she had done to the crew of the Intrepid Drayton shocked him to the core of his being. There was a kind of terrible beauty to her magic, and when he stood in the epicenter of her silent storm, a feeling of otherworldly awe claimed him, as if he became part of a mystical event that couldn\u2019t be explained, only experienced. It was a peculiar, mesmerizing serenity with a touch of fear, the kind he sometimes felt when walking alone through the towering woods of Adrianglia or staring at the rough ocean and its sky, pregnant with a storm. He had encountered something greater than the limits of his ordinary life, and he was both alarmed and drawn to it.</p><p>Jason was right when he called Charlotte Silver Death. The name fit. Horror and beauty mixed into one. But underneath it she was a living, breathing woman, and when he\u2019d looked at her, standing alone at the bow of the ship, vulnerable despite the potent magic swirling around her, while the rest of the people hugged the sides, afraid to step even an inch closer, he felt her isolation. He wanted to shield her, and he had.</p><p>He still wanted to protect her now. Despite everything he had gone through, despite his goal being in sight, if someone had offered him a chance to instantly transport her somewhere safe in exchange for having to relive the last six months over again, he would\u2019ve taken it in a heartbeat. And she would deeply hate him for it.</p> <p>Three people shot out of a side street, two men and a woman. Good weapons, good clothes of a similar cut\u2014town militia or the Market\u2019s slavers. They charged him.</p><p>He lent a part of himself to his blade, feeling the magic slide along the edge of his sword. In the Edge, becoming one with the blade took time and effort, but here in the Weird, where the magic was at its strongest, it required a mere fraction of a second. His flash surged along the blade, pure white, fed by the adrenaline coursing through him.</p><p>The first man stabbed at him with a short, utilitarian sword. Richard swayed out of the way and thrust into the man\u2019s armpit. The sword slid into his flesh, cutting bone and gristle like it was warm butter. He felt the faintest resistance when the heart ruptured and freed his blade with a sharp tug in time to slam the pommel into the second man\u2019s face. The second attacker stumbled back. The woman jumped into his place, swinging the heavy mace in a devastating sideways blow aimed at Richard\u2019s shoulder to incapacitate his sword arm.</p><p>Richard leaned back, letting the mace whistle past him and sliced his sword across her throat. A shallow cut, all that was needed. She gulped her own blood and fell.</p><p>He grabbed the remaining man and hurled him against the wall, holding the blade an inch from the thug\u2019s throat. The man\u2019s eyes told Richard he was drowning in sheer animal terror.</p><p>\u201cThe bookkeeper?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHouse on the hill,\u201d the thug said, his voice shaking. \u201cColumns. White columns.\u201d</p><p>Richard released him, and the man took off down the street at a dead run.</p><p>Charlotte stood unharmed, taking short, shallow breaths. An expression of deep frustration touched her face.</p><p>\u201cCome, we have to hurry,\u201d he told her.</p><p>She caught up to him, and together they started up the street, toward the low hill.</p><p>\u201cWhy do I always do that? Why do I freeze instead of helping you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo killer instinct, remember?\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a natural reaction. When in danger, we fight, flee, or freeze.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t freeze.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m too busy trying to impress you,\u201d he said. \u201cIs it working?\u201d</p><p>She gave him an unreadable look. Perhaps now wasn\u2019t the best time for levity.</p><p>The street ran into an eight-foot-tall stone wall. Small rocks, each paler than the gray stone making up the bulk of the wall, guarded its top, embedded about twenty feet from each other.</p><p>\u201cWard stones,\u201d Charlotte said.</p><p>Climbing the wall was out of the question. The ward wouldn\u2019t let them pass.</p><p>\u201cNew plan.\u201d Richard turned, and they trailed the wall, heading down. Somewhere there had to be a gate or an opening.</p><p>Ahead and to the right, screams cut the silence. An orange-and-red glow lit the night, punctuated by a column of smoke. Jason\u2019s crew had set something on fire.</p><p>The side street curved, and they followed it around the houses, closer to the fire and to another wall. An iron gate lay wrenched to the side. Richard ducked through the opening. A wide courtyard spread before him. To the right, near a blocky building, a fight raged between the slavers and a ragged mob armed with shackles and rocks. The slaves struck out, their haggard faces contorted with bestial fury, their bodies, gaping through the holes in their rags, bearing whip marks. They had no weapons. They ripped into the slavers with their nails and teeth like wild animals.</p><p>These weren\u2019t the freshly acquired, to be sold as slaves. No, they were the rejects, probably used for manual labor on the island, little more than beasts of burden. No human being should have been treated this way, but they had been, and now they were finally venting their rage. They would kill anyone in their path.</p><p>Straight ahead, a raised platform with seven sets of metal posts stood, each post widening at the top. The slaves\u2019 shackles would be fixed to the post, under that wide top, so they could be evaluated. To the right, another gate gaped open, and another group squared off for its control. Nine armed slavers in leather on one side and four of Jason\u2019s people on the other. Neither was willing to make the first move. Jason\u2019s people were good and looked desperate, but the slavers outnumbered them two to one.</p><p>He had to get through that gate.</p><p>Richard grabbed Charlotte\u2019s hand and squeezed it. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to cut our way through. Stay behind me.\u201d</p><p>He strode toward the fight. A slave spun into his way. Richard knocked him aside and thrust himself between the two lines, holding his sword lightly at an angle.</p><p>The slavers surveyed him, spreading out. He heard Jason\u2019s people move back.</p><p>Here, poised on the threshold between violence and peace, was his true place. Generations of warriors, stretching back through time to the fierce native clans that had first fled into the Mire to escape a magic catastrophe, had stood just like him, balanced on that sword\u2019s blade between life and death. Here he was in control, serene and at peace.</p><p>In that brief moment, when their lives and his came together, he truly lived. But for him to experience life, his opponents had to die.</p><p>The first slaver moved to his right. Richard struck, piercing and cutting with a surgeon\u2019s precision and speed honed by countless hours of practice. He spun in a fluid movement and stopped, his sword held at a downward angle.</p><p>The slavers looked at him.</p><p>The second, fourth, fifth, and seventh of them fell. They made no noise; they simply crumpled to the ground.</p><p>The remaining slavers froze for an agonizing second and rushed him. He melted into the moment, striking without thought, completely on instinct. Gash across the chest, reverse, throat cut, abdomen cut, stab under the rib cage to the right, free the blade cutting across a chest in the same move, reverse, cut across the throat, thrust forward . . . and it\u2019s over.</p><p>Too soon. It was always over too soon.</p><p>The last slaver stopped short of his sword. The thrust never connected. The man lingered upright for the space of a breath and sank to his knees, struggling for air. Behind him, Charlotte\u2019s magic coiled back into her body.</p><p>She stood very still, her eyes opened wide, looking at him as if they had met for the first time. This is it, he wanted to tell her. This is who I am.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t tell if she was surprised or horrified or perhaps both or neither. Regret stabbed at him, but then it was better that she knew his true nature. They had to move. He took her hand, and they ran to the gate.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d he told her. \u201cThat was brave of you, but also unnecessary. Please don\u2019t do that again. I don\u2019t want to accidentally injure you.\u201d</p><p>She pulled her hand out of his fingers. \u201cI\u2019m not helpless, Richard.\u201d</p><p>Did she find his touch repulsive? He sliced through the lock securing the gate. \u201cI know you\u2019re anything but. But you\u2019ve done your part, and it\u2019s my turn. Save your reserves. We may need them.\u201d</p><p>They went through the gate, and Charlotte gasped. Above them a corpse hung from a pole. A boy, Jack\u2019s age. His eyes had been gouged out. His mouth was sewn shut. His nose was a broken mess of flesh and cartilage on a face scoured with burn marks. A sign hanging around his neck read, \u201cWe\u2019re always watching.\u201d</p><p>He had seen this before\u2014the slavers\u2019 favorite visual aid to discourage escape. He had pried Jason out of a hole in the ground just before he was about to end up on such a pole. Anger, hot and furious, burned in him, then died down to a simmer.</p><p>\u201cHe was alive,\u201d Charlotte whispered.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHe was alive when they mutilated him. Those are predeath wounds.\u201d</p><p>Darkness whipped out of her. The hair on the back of his neck rose.</p><p>Charlotte clenched her fists. \u201cI\u2019m going to kill every slaver we find.\u201d</p> <p>He noticed the set of her jaw and the thin line of her lips. Her eyes burned. He recognized this fury. It and he were old friends, and he knew it was useless to get in its way. \u201cAs you wish,\u201d he told her. \u201cAll I ask is that we move up the hill toward the bookkeeper.\u201d</p><p>Ahead, the streets unrolled before them, climbing up a low hill. They marched upward together.</p><p>THE house sat recessed from the street, a stately, respectable, two-story mansion, flanked by carved columns and palm trees. A brown horse was tied to the side, flicking its ears and casting nervous glances at the street.</p><p>Richard glanced back behind them. No movement. They had left a trail of dead bodies, and half of them belonged to Charlotte. She killed again and again, driven by an overwhelming need to stop the slaver savagery from happening. He was like that too, at the start of this mess. Back then, every new mutilation and atrocity infuriated him. He had seen things so wrong and shocking, that the only reaction he could manage was to destroy those who committed them. It had become his moral imperative and the only possible human response.</p><p>He saw it now in Charlotte. She was trying to cleanse the city. He wasn\u2019t a mind reader, but he knew exactly what went through her head. If only she could manage to kill every slaver in their way, the pain would stop. If she didn\u2019t kill, she would have to process the full horror of what she had seen in the past five days, and it would rip her to pieces.</p> <p>It had taken him several months before he realized that killing slavers accomplished nothing. They were the immediate tormentors, but no matter how many he cut down, as long as somewhere, someone wealthy was getting wealthier from that torment, new slavers would always take the place of the old. Charlotte would come to realize this too, but for now she needed to act, and act she did. He had known that many plagues existed, but seeing them in all their terrifying glory was an educational experience.</p><p>She was walking oddly now, as if her feet hurt when she rested her weight on them. Her lips were pressed together into a thin, hard line. Her skin was pale, her eyes very bright. She looked feverish. She must be expending too much magic. There were only two ways from here: she would stop exerting herself and recover, or she would drain herself and die.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re almost done,\u201d he told her. \u201cNo more, Charlotte. Save yourself.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte nodded.</p><p>He cut into the door, carving the lock out of it with precise strikes, and pushed the heavy wooden halves open, revealing a large hall with a staircase curving to the second floor.</p><p>His mind barely registered the three crossbowmen crouched behind an overturned chest of drawers. He saw the crossbow bolts coming at him and automatically flashed, throwing his magic in a pale shield in front of him. The bolts bounced off. He dashed forward.</p> <p>\u201cDie,\u201d Charlotte ordered, her voice exhausted.</p><p>The three crossbowmen choked. He jumped over the chest and cut them down with three strikes.</p><p>Behind him, Charlotte slumped over and leaned against the column. Damn it all.</p><p>SHE was spent. The last spark of magic burned dimly within her. If Charlotte let it go, her hold on life would slip. She was almost tempted to do it.</p><p>How had it snuck up on her so quickly? She had expended a lot of magic, but she never felt tired. She felt light and all-powerful, as if her body had become a burden, and she was disconnected from it. And then, in the last five minutes, as she climbed the steep street to the house, reality crashed back into her. Her body felt so heavy, so constraining, as if every pound of her flesh and bone had become three. Her feet ached. She wanted to vomit just to lighten the load.</p><p>The moment her magic flowed out to strike at the bowmen, her legs failed. Too much of herself had gone out with the magic. She had to lean against the column, or she would fall.</p><p>Richard loomed over her. She glimpsed anger in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cNo more.\u201d His clipped voice held an unmistakable command.</p> <p>She felt the magic of his body, a vibrant life force shivering just inches from her. All she had to do was reach for it. Her magic whimpered, eager for sustenance. That\u2019s how plaguebringers were born\u2014the exertion drove the healer to seek an alternate source of fuel and siphon off the nearest life to keep on killing.</p><p>He dipped his head to meet her eyes. \u201cCharlotte!\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t ready to give up on life yet. \u201cDo not raise your voice at me, my lord. I know where my limits are, and I have no intention of fainting or dying. I won\u2019t use my magic anymore. You\u2019re on your own.\u201d</p><p>A lean, dark-haired man walked out from behind the staircase. He carried a sword.</p><p>THE man held a Sud sword, a long, slender length of steel. Young, fit, walking with perfect balance, and carrying his sword with complete confidence. An adept, probably a professional fighter.</p><p>Richard flicked the blood off his blade.</p><p>They looked at each other.</p><p>The sword master attacked. Richard parried and lunged. The blade met a wall of blue flash and slid off. Magic burned his arm. The Sud used the flash to reinforce his blade. Fantastic. And here he thought this would be easy.</p><p>Richard ignored the pain and spun, delivering a short barrage of strikes. The Sud parried, dancing and spinning. They moved across the floor. Richard attacked. Strike, strike, strike. His blade bounced from the Sud\u2019s sword. Normally, his flash-sharpened blade would\u2019ve severed his opponent\u2019s weapon.</p><p>The man was good, Richard gave him that.</p><p>Richard backed away. He walked the path of the lightning blade, relying on that first, faster-than-sight strike to instantly incapacitate his opponent. Failing that, he fought with precision, banking on his power and control. The rapid melee of parrying and trading blows while covering a lot of ground was his weakness, while the Sudanese swordsmen reveled in it.</p><p>The Sud attacked in a flurry of blows. Richard parried, lunging, thrusting, looking for an opening and finding none. The Sud coated his entire sword in a protective magic sheath, making it nearly impossible to break and using it as a shield. It was down to skill and speed, and the Sud had plenty of both.</p><p>The man feinted to the right. Richard pulled away, avoiding the trap. As he dodged, the man hopped forward, turning the feint into a spin, and kicked. Richard saw it, but he had no way to avoid it. He spun into it, flexing, taking the hit on his left shoulder. The kick hammered into the muscle, and Richard staggered back. Like being hit with a club.</p><p>The Sudanese swordsman landed and spun on one foot, showing off. \u201cMy technique is superior.\u201d</p><p>Vanity. The Sud was young, hungry, and eager to prove that he was better. Thank you for showing me the chip in your armor.</p><p>\u201cKeep hopping around,\u201d Richard said. \u201cYour dance teacher isn\u2019t here to clap for you, but I\u2019m enjoying the show.\u201d</p><p>Most men would\u2019ve begun to tire by now. He doubted this one would. The Sud seemed to take putting spring into one\u2019s step literally. His sword was unbreakable, his technique flawless. But the man himself was flawed.</p><p>A hint of movement tugged at Richard. He turned his head slightly. Charlotte pushed away from the column. He had to keep her from doing anything rash. Charlotte was a proud woman. If she had any strength at all, she would\u2019ve remained upright, so she must\u2019ve been at the end of her rope. If she thought he was desperate, she\u2019d try to save him. Letting her die for his sake wasn\u2019t in the plan.</p><p>He shrugged, nonchalant. \u201cMy lady, I\u2019ll be with you in a moment. I just need to pull the wings off that pretty butterfly.\u201d</p><p>The Sud clenched his teeth, making his jaw muscles bulge. It wouldn\u2019t take too much more to nudge him in the right direction.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t mind me,\u201d Charlotte said.</p><p>\u201cFirst I\u2019ll kill him, then you,\u201d the Sud promised.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d Charlotte sat on the overturned chest. \u201cHe\u2019s better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m better and faster,\u201d the Sud said.</p><p>She shook her head, her voice matter-of-fact. \u201cNot only is he better, but you fight for money. He has more at stake.\u201d</p><p>No panic, no tremor in her voice. Just a calm statement. She hit the Sud right where it hurt, and she did it as if the outcome of the fight were already a foregone conclusion. Damn, but that was impressive.</p><p>Charlotte had no doubt he would win. Richard shifted the grip on his sword. He couldn\u2019t disappoint.</p><p>He motioned to the Sud with the fingers of his left hand. \u201cCome on, let\u2019s have the finale. I can\u2019t waste any more time on your prancing. The lady is waiting, and I don\u2019t want to be rude.\u201d</p><p>The Sud leaped, unleashing a flurry of strokes, too fast to keep up. Richard parried the first, the second, the third, and counterattacked, holding his sword with both hands, sinking all of his strength into the overhead blow.</p><p>The Sud flashed, shielding his blade, but the sheer power of the impact staggered him.</p><p>Richard struck again, bringing a barrage of blows onto the Sud\u2019s sword, forcing him back with every strike. Sweat broke out on Richard\u2019s forehead. This attack was draining all of his reserves, but he was betting on the Sud\u2019s ego. If he was lucky, the younger man would rise to the challenge. A wiser swordsman would simply wait Richard out and, once he tired, kill him at his leisure, but youth and wisdom didn\u2019t always travel together.</p><p>The Sud lunged forward, grinding his blade against Richard\u2019s, flash against flash. They struggled, locked. The Sud twisted, trying to catch Richard\u2019s leading leg with his foot, aiming to trip him. Richard shoved him back. The younger man stumbled, off-balance. Richard hammered a front kick to his chest.</p><p>The Sud fell back and rolled to his feet like a cat. His face was a furious mask. He screamed and charged. Richard sidestepped his barrage of strikes, dodging, parrying, knocking the blade aside when he could. He knew the wall was behind him, but there was no place to go.</p><p>His foot touched the stone of the wall. The Sud whirled like his joints were liquid and thrust, aiming at the heart, so fast he blurred. Richard parried on pure instinct, sliding his blade under the strike. Their magic ground against each other, blue against white. The man\u2019s entire weight pressed onto Richard\u2019s blade, tearing a ragged snarl from him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The swordsman\u2019s blade slid up, gaining an inch.</p><p>Richard pushed back, his arms shaking from the strain. Holding the younger man\u2019s deadweight was squeezing the last drops of strength from his tired body.</p><p>Another inch. The Sud\u2019s narrow blade slid along Richard\u2019s sword. He saw it move but was powerless to stop it.</p> <p>The sword cut his left biceps, slicing through the muscle in an agonizing slow burn.</p><p>Sonovabitch. There was no way out of this position that didn\u2019t end with his being hurt. Even if he could summon enough strength to shove the younger man back, the effort would leave him exposed for a counterstrike, and with his back to the wall, he had no way to maneuver.</p><p>The Sud grinned.</p><p>If he lost, Charlotte would die. He would fail, and Sophie would be left alone with her demons. He had to kill the other man.</p><p>He would endure pain if it meant he would win.</p> <p>Richard dropped his blade. The Sud\u2019s sword, abruptly free from resistance, slid forward and cut deeper across his arm, biting into the bone in a flash of pain. Thrown off-balance, the Sud pitched forward, and Richard hammered his fist into the man\u2019s throat. The swordsman rocked back from the blow. Richard tore the sword from his opponent\u2019s hand, flashed, coating it in his magic, and thrust it upward, under the rib cage. The blade carved through the lungs and heart like a knife through a soft pear. The bloody end emerged from the Sud\u2019s breast and sliced into the underside of his chin.</p><p>The man opened his mouth, surprise making his face look young . . . Blood poured out from between his teeth, drenching them in red. Richard pushed him back, and the Sud fell, his unseeing eyes staring at the ceiling.</p><p>Richard slumped forward, trying to catch his breath. His left arm hung useless, the gash in his muscle burning as if someone had poured molten lead into wound. He stared at the man by his feet. What was he, twenty-five? Twenty-eight? His whole life ahead of him, good looks, talent, and now he was dead. Such a waste.</p><p>Richard gritted his teeth and looked at the cut. Blood drenched his skin and dripped on the floor. He didn\u2019t have much of it to spare as it was.</p><p>Gods, it hurt like hell. He breathed in deeply through his nose, trying to separate himself from the pain, forced his face into a calm mask, and turned to Charlotte.</p><p>She sagged on the overturned chest, her shoulders slumped, her spine bent. \u201cLet me see it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d If she saw it, she would try to heal him, and he couldn\u2019t let her do that.</p><p>\u201cMy lord\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said no.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014don\u2019t be a baby.\u201d</p><p>A baby? He ripped a sleeve off the Sud\u2019s shirt and wrapped it around his arm. \u201cThere. It\u2019s fixed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous.\u201d</p><p>He picked up his sword. His left arm felt like it was on fire, and it hurt to move.</p><p>\u201cRichard, don\u2019t ignore me. You just wrapped a filthy rag over an open wound, which is surely infected now.\u201d</p> <p>He walked over to her. \u201cI\u2019m fine. You\u2019re spent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least let me look at it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you well enough to go upstairs?\u201d</p><p>She pushed herself up from the chest, that familiar ice flashing in her eyes. \u201cWithout my magic and with my eyes closed, I\u2019m a better field medic than you are. You will let me look at your wound and dress it properly instead of wrapping some soiled sleeve around it. It will take two minutes, then we can go upstairs and hunt down the bookkeeper. Or we can do it your way, and you can faint from blood loss, in which case we\u2019re both dead because I can\u2019t carry you or protect you. Your arm, my lord. Now.\u201d</p><p>He turned, presenting her with his left arm. It was easier than arguing. She pulled a bag from under her cloak, opened it, and a took out a plastic first-aid kit, complete with the Broken\u2019s familiar red cross on it. Charlotte opened the kit, took out a small vial, and handed it to him. \u201cDrink this.\u201d</p><p>He pulled the cork out with his teeth and gulped the bitter liquid. Cold rushed through him, down the injured muscle, right to the source of pain. A welcome numbness came. It felt heavenly.</p><p>Charlotte splashed something on the cut and began wrapping his arm. \u201cHe cut the bone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMhm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis stone-faced routine isn\u2019t necessary. I know the pain is excruciating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf my rolling around on the ground and crying would make things easier for you, by all means I will oblige.\u201d It finally sank in. He had won and lived, and so did she.</p><p>Charlotte rolled her eyes. \u201cWe\u2019re lucky his sword was so sharp. The cut is very clean. If you give me an hour or two to recover, I will heal this. Was it necessary to let him slash you?\u201d</p><p>Argh. \u201cYes, it was. He was very good, and I didn\u2019t have a choice about it. Since when are you a connoisseur of martial arts?\u201d He was actually arguing that he was a lesser swordsman. How did it even make sense?</p><p>\u201cSince my life started depending on them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe next time I\u2019m in a fight for my life, I\u2019ll be sure to ask your advice, my lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you do, I\u2019ll advise you to not throw away your sword.\u201d</p><p>He almost growled, but it would\u2019ve frightened her, and he held himself in check. An infuriating, impossible woman.</p><p>She tied the final knot and wrapped white tape around the bandage. \u201cWhat\u2019s next?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe go upstairs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well.\u201d She leaned toward him to tie a sling around his shoulder. Her hair brushed against his cheek. Desire stabbed him, sudden and overwhelming. His irritation only made him want her more.</p><p>Charlotte slid his arm into the sling and put the kit back into the bag. \u201cIf you promise not to get yourself cut or skewered with anyone else\u2019s sword, I promise not to faint.\u201d</p><p>Delightful. \u201cI\u2019d be a fool not to take that generous offer.\u201d</p><p>They started up the stairs, agonizingly slow.</p><p>\u201cDid you really think I would win?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She turned to look at him, gray eyes so beautiful on her lovely face. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>Richard imagined stepping forward, pulling her to him with his uninjured hand, and kissing her right there on the stairs. In his mind, her lips were warm and inviting. In his mind, she loved it and kissed him back.</p><p>His mind was a place of many dreams, most of them dead and abandoned. She\u2019s walking next to you, he told himself. She saw the true you, and she\u2019s still willing to care for you. Enjoy what little you have while you have it.</p><p>They made it into the hallway. A faint light painted the floor under the door on their right. Richard pointed at the wall by the door. Charlotte pressed her back against it.</p><p>He kicked in the door, spinning to the side. Bullets peppered the opposite wall, biting chunks out of the plaster. He\u2019d seen the inside of the room for a fraction of a second, but it was enough: a red-haired woman sat behind a desk and a tall man stood next to her, armed with one of the Broken\u2019s guns. Richard yanked a throwing knife out of the sheath on his belt, thrust himself into the doorway, and hurled the blade. The knife bit into the gunman\u2019s throat. The man stumbled back and fell.</p><p>The woman stared at him with cold, clear eyes. She had a heart-shaped face, with the high, contoured cheekbones bluebloods often found desirable. Her flame red hair coiled around her head in a complex braid. Her tunic was silk, cut in what was assuredly the latest style. An oval pendant hung from her neck on a thin gold chain: a pale, aquamarine stone the size of his thumbnail. She looked to be near Charlotte\u2019s age.</p><p>Behind her were two large windows. Rows of shelves supported an assortment of books on the right wall while a large white limestone fireplace occupied the left. An arithmetika, a magic-powered calculator, sat on her desk, next to stacks of paper. No weapons appeared to be in the vicinity.</p><p>\u201cWe found the bookkeeper,\u201d Richard said. \u201cCome inside, Charlotte.\u201d</p><p>She walked into the room. She saw the dead gunman. Her eyebrows rose briefly, then Charlotte sank into the nearest chair.</p><p>\u201cIf you had a knife, why didn\u2019t you throw it at the swordsman downstairs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would\u2019ve been a waste. He would\u2019ve knocked it aside.\u201d Richard nodded at the woman. \u201cPlace both hands on the desk.\u201d</p><p>She did so. Delicate fingers, adorned with thin gold rings studded with stones. Wealth and taste were sometimes unlikely bedfellows, but in this case, they were clearly bosom buddies. A familiar anger flared in him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wealthy, probably well educated,\u201d he said. \u201cJuliana Academy, perhaps.\u201d Juliana\u2019s was considered the best place for blueblood girls with money to receive their education. He\u2019d became very familiar with Adrianglian school selection for Lark\u2019s sake. He shouldn\u2019t have bothered. His niece shot down all of his careful choices.</p><p>\u201cWinters College,\u201d Charlotte said. \u201cHer tunic perfectly matches the shade of her eyes. Juliana\u2019s encourages more creativity.\u201d</p><p>The woman arched an eyebrow and looked Charlotte over, pausing on her dirty, bloodstained clothes. His urge to injure her shot into overdrive.</p><p>\u201cAnd where did you study, if I may ask?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had personal tutorship from one of the first ten,\u201d Charlotte said, her voice glacially cold and cutting with scorn like a knife. \u201cDon\u2019t try to belittle me; you\u2019re hopelessly outclassed. I see shortcomings in your every single aspect, from your lack of taste to your rotten morality. You\u2019ve involved yourself in the basest of crimes. You facilitated murder, rape, and the torture of children. Your conduct is unbecoming a peer of realm.\u201d</p><p>He almost winced.</p><p>The woman drew back, her cheeks turning red. \u201cPlease, spare me the rhetoric. We\u2019re a higher breed. You know this as well as I do. You simply put on blinders and call it altruism. I call it willful ignorance. Those of us who are blueblood became so because our ancestors rose from the ranks of unwashed mobs. They were the thanes, the chiefs, the leaders of their people. The betters of the rest by virtue of their abilities and will. We\u2019re their descendants. They climbed to power, and we maintain it. It\u2019s that simple. These people you\u2019re accusing me of crimes against live like animals. In many cases, being stripped of their freedom is the best thing that ever happened to them.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Charlotte stared at her. \u201cThe function of a noble title is to serve the people. Seven blocks from here, there\u2019s a body of a boy whose eyes have been gouged out with his mouth sewn shut. He was still alive when they did it. What is wrong with you? Are you human at all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA regrettable but necessary casualty.\u201d The bookkeeper crossed her thin arms on her chest. \u201cBut you are right, perhaps we should\u2019ve left him with his lovely family to live in squalor while his parents drank themselves senseless in an effort to forget their own laziness and beat him when his existence reminded them of their baseness. Those who are capable act. They amount to something in life. They don\u2019t live in filth, gorging themselves on cheap food, drowning in addictions, and rutting to produce yet more of their ilk. We rescue children from that. We provide a valuable service.\u201d</p><p>Unbelievable.</p> <p>Charlotte made a choking noise.</p><p>\u201cYour condemnation means nothing,\u201d the bookkeeper said. \u201cThis enterprise was conceived by a mind far superior to yours or mine. Think about it, when a blueblood buys a pretty young girl, she has a shot at a better life. If she\u2019s smart, she will elevate herself by having his child. Just the other day, we fulfilled a special order for a childless couple. They wanted a pair of twins, a boy and a girl, between the ages of two and four, resembling both of them. Do you have any idea how difficult it was to find suitable children? Yet we\u2019ve managed. Slavery is an opportunity. It\u2019s regrettable you can\u2019t understand that.\u201d</p><p>Nothing either Charlotte or Richard could say would ever make this woman see reason.</p><p>\u201cKill her,\u201d Charlotte said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t kill her now, I\u2019ll do it myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need her testimony and information.\u201d He approached the table. He had no idea how they would make it down the hill and to the port with a captive, but by gods, he would try.</p> <p>\u201cKilling me won\u2019t be necessary.\u201d The woman raised her chin. \u201cUnlike you, I know my duty to the spear.\u201d</p><p>She grasped her pendant.</p><p>Richard lunged to stop her.</p><p>The stone crunched under the pressure of her fingers. A blinding spike of light shot out into her chin, through her head, and out of her skull.</p><p>Charlotte gasped.</p><p>The bookkeeper sagged in her chair, dead, her head drooping to the side. The whole thing took less than a second. She had been wearing an Owner\u2019s Gift necklace. He should have seen it, gods damn it.</p> <p>The world screeched to a halt. He felt like he was falling.</p><p>All this time, all this work, and the arrogant scum killed herself. Was there no justice in the world?</p><p>Maybe Charlotte . . . He pivoted to her.</p><p>\u201cVery dead,\u201d she said, her face disgusted. \u201cIrreversibly dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn it.\u201d</p><p>His mind whirred, trying to reassess the situation. Wallowing in defeat never served any purpose. No, he was kidding himself. Even if they had managed to take her alive, neither of them could have gotten her to the ship in their present condition, and if they did, by some miracle, manage it, she would never testify. But it wasn\u2019t over, he reminded himself. Not yet. They might not have the bookkeeper alive, but they still had her office and everything within it.</p><p>Duty to the spear. Only one spear came to mind. \u201cGaesum,\u201d he thought out loud. The symbol of the Adrianglian royal family.</p><p>\u201cThat would explain her devotion,\u201d Charlotte said. \u201cIf she thought she was serving the crown in some capacity, she couldn\u2019t permit herself to acknowledge that they could do something base, or her entire worldview would come crashing down.\u201d</p> <p>They looked at each other. In Adrianglia, the crown was revered. The power of the royal bloodline had its limitations, but the monarch still held the presiding position over the Council, wielding much of the power within the executive branch. The royal family was looked upon as the epitome of behavior and personal honor. The idea that the crown could be involved in the slave trade was unthinkable.</p><p>\u201cThere has to be a trail somewhere. She was a bookkeeper; she had to have kept financial records.\u201d Richard strode to the shelves and pulled a stack of books out. He handed them to Charlotte. She leafed through them while he rummaged through the desk. His search of the drawers turned up a wooden box, unlocked. Inside, necklaces lay in a row, each with a simple large gemstone in a variety of colors. Unlike the bookkeeper\u2019s pendant, their chains were short. Once fastened around the neck, they couldn\u2019t be removed by slipping them over the head.</p><p>\u201cIs that what she used to kill herself?\u201d Charlotte asked, her voice dry.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cThey\u2019re called Owner\u2019s Gifts.\u201d He picked one up, dangling the false ruby pendant. \u201cThey\u2019re given to young attractive slaves who are used for sexual gratification. They have a one-time lock: once fastened, they\u2019re impossible to take off without cutting through the chain. Each contains a small magic charge designed to kill the wearer. The necklace detonates if the chain is cut or the stone is damaged. A pointed reminder that if you disobey or displease, your life can end in an instant. They work much better than shackles and are a lot less obvious.\u201d</p><p>She clenched her teeth, and he read a mix of horror and disgust in her face. \u201cEvery time I think I\u2019ve reached the limit, this place shocks me.\u201d</p><p>And that was true, Richard realized. He thought she\u2019d grow callous or numb, but every new evidence of cruelty cut a new wound into her. Again, he wished he hadn\u2019t brought her here. There were only so many wounds one could take.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you make of this?\u201d Charlotte showed him a hollowed-out book.</p><p>Hope stirred in him. \u201cWas there anything inside?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>And the newborn hope plummeted to its death. \u201cWe have to keep looking.\u201d</p><p>Twenty minutes later, they looked at each other across the table. The office was a wreck. They had left nothing untouched. The ledgers, if they existed, eluded them.</p><p>Richard braced himself on the table. He felt another bout of dizziness coming on. He\u2019d gotten through the first one a few minutes ago, but now the vertigo was back. Taking wounds came with a price.</p><p>\u201cRichard,\u201d Charlotte said.</p><p>He turned.</p><p>A bloody figure stood in the doorway, his hair and clothes stained with gore and soot. His eyes were tired, and he was carrying a bloody crowbar. A huge black dog panted by his side.</p><p>\u201cJack?\u201d Richard said.</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d Jack dropped the crowbar. It clanged on the floor.</p><p>\u201cHow are you?\u201d Charlotte asked.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d he said, his voice dull. \u201cI\u2019m all funned out. I think we should go to the ship now. The city is burning, the fire\u2019s coming this way, and the smoke is making my throat itch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t leave yet.\u201d Charlotte sighed. \u201cWe\u2019ve looked everywhere, but we haven\u2019t found the ledgers. We have to find them, or all this was for nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you look in the safe?\u201d Jack asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat safe?\u201d The room had no safe, only a table and the shelves, and he had knocked on all the clear walls looking for a hollow spot.</p><p>\u201cIn the fireplace.\u201d</p><p>Richard turned to the fireplace. It was a typical Weird limestone fireplace without a mantel. No fire was laid out and the fire pit was perfectly clean. No soot marks. It definitely hadn\u2019t been used, but this far south it might have been conceived as decorative. Richard moved to it, probing the stones with his hand. \u201cWhat makes you think there is a safe in it?\u201d</p><p>Jack sat by Charlotte on the floor. \u201cThere\u2019s no chimney. It smells like the dead woman\u2019s perfume\u2014I can scent it from here. Also, there\u2019s a doorstop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d Charlotte asked, brushing debris from Jack\u2019s hair.</p><p>Jack pointed to the ground. A small ornate doorstop designed to be slid under a door sat by the desk. If the front of the fireplace swung open like a door, it was in the perfect position to be grabbed and wedged under it.</p><p>There was no reason for the bookkeeper to spend time at the fireplace. She wouldn\u2019t have gone anywhere near it. Richard knocked at the stones. If there was some mechanism to unlock it, he couldn\u2019t see it. He picked up his sword.</p><p>\u201cMaybe there is a hidden switch,\u201d Charlotte said.</p><p>\u201cIt would take too long.\u201d He concentrated, feeding magic into the blade, forcing it toward the tip of the sword. The flash-coated edge glowed brighter and brighter, until it blazed like a tiny star. Richard raised the sword and forced the tip into the limestone, testing it. The blade sank into the fireplace, cutting through the rock with surprising ease. No more than half an inch, he decided. If there was a safe, he didn\u2019t want to damage the contents. He dropped to one knee, slashed horizontally across the fireplace, rose, and slashed again at his eye level.</p><p>The front of the fireplace slid half an inch. Richard stepped back. The cut section crashed down and fell with a loud thud, its back exposed\u2014wooden boards with a thin layer of limestone affixed to its front. Inside the gutted fireplace, shelves gaped, containing five small black books and one red one.</p><p>He turned to Jack. \u201cWell done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a genius.\u201d Charlotte hugged the boy.</p><p>Richard pulled out the books and brought them over to Charlotte. His hands shook.</p><p>She opened the first black book, and her eyes widened as she read.</p><p>He flipped through the red volume, scanning the pages filled with neat rows of accounting figures. Investments and payments, to and from five names. Here they were, the people directly profiting from the sale of human beings. Lord Casside, a rich blueblood who\u2019d made his money in the import and export trade. He\u2019d seen him once at Declan\u2019s house during a formal dinner. Lady Ermine. He had no idea who she was, but he would find out. Baron Rene, another unfamiliar name. Lord Maedoc, a retired general, a decorated war hero. And . . .</p><p>\u201cViscount Robert Brennan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe king\u2019s cousin?\u201d Charlotte asked.</p><p>Richard nodded. So it was true. The bookkeeper truly served the spear. Robert Brennan, the seventh person in line for the throne. Never in his calculations had he ever thought that the chain of command went that high. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re shocked,\u201d Charlotte said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d Richard leaned against the desk. \u201cHe was born wearing a silk shirt. He has wealth, status, the privilege afforded to his bloodline, the best education one can buy . . .\u201d</p><p>All the things that had been denied to Richard. An education was a double-edged sword: it broadened his horizons, and, at the same time, it made him painfully aware of the opportunities he would never have. There was a time when he felt trapped in the Mire, aware of the world outside the Edge but unable to get to it, chained to the swamp. He had neither the breeding, nor the money, nor the opportunity to make it past the Louisiana troops guarding the border with the Edge, but he had the intellect and the education to understand the full futility of his position. He would\u2019ve killed to open just one door and escape. Brennan had all the advantages. Every door was open to him.</p> <p>\u201cWhy? Why do this? He\u2019s like a millionaire who\u2019s robbing beggars.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho knows,\u201d Charlotte said. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s the thrill of doing something criminal.\u201d</p><p>She sounded exhausted. Worry stabbed at him. He had to get her and the boy out of here.</p><p>He cut a section of the gauzy curtain, stacked the books on it, and tied it into a makeshift bag. Stealing was criminal. This was an atrocity. More so, because Brennan, born into privilege, had a duty. He had a responsibility to wield his influence for the benefit of the realm, and instead he spat on it. Whatever sickness drove Brennan to rule over the slave trade, Richard would make sure he paid. He would make certain. He had promised it to Sophie, and he would see it through.</p><p>Richard sheathed his sword and handed the bag of books to Jack. \u201cThis is vitally important. Guard it.\u201d</p> <p>The boy nodded.</p><p>Richard offered Charlotte his right hand. She rose from the chair, swaying a little. They walked downstairs and out of the front door. Below them, the city stretched down the hill to the harbor. Orange flames billowed from two different sides of the town, far to the left and closer to the right, devouring the structures. Here and there, isolated shots rang out, followed by screams. A single ship waited in the middle of the harbor, like a graceful bird on a sea of black glass, and above it all, in the endless night sky, a pale moon rose, spilling its indifferent light onto the scene.</p><p>Richard turned to the left, behind the house. The horse still waited. He untied the reins and brought it over to Charlotte.</p><p>\u201cI can walk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCharlotte.\u201d He hadn\u2019t meant to put all of his frustration into that one single word, but somehow he did.</p><p>She blinked, startled.</p> <p>\u201cPlease, get on the horse.\u201d</p><p>She climbed into the saddle. He took the reins and started down the street, Jack at his side. The dog took position ahead of them. Richard\u2019s face itched mercilessly. As soon as they got down to the coast, he would wash all the gunk of his disguise off his skin.</p><p>\u201cGeorge has been alone with dad for a long time,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>It was a lot to ask, but he had confidence in George, and the boy needed to redeem himself. \u201cHe will be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going to kill our dad?\u201d the boy asked quietly.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not for me to decide what to do with your father.\u201d John Drayton deserved to die, and if Drayton weren\u2019t connected to the boys, he would dispose of the man like the piece of garbage he was. But family took precedence, and the children\u2019s claim superseded his.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re going to let us handle it, don\u2019t let George do it,\u201d Jack said. \u201cI\u2019ll kill him for grandma. I don\u2019t care. I don\u2019t even remember him, but George waited for him all this time. It would be bad for him.\u201d</p><p>It was said that changelings didn\u2019t understand human emotion. They understood it just fine, Richard reflected. They simply couldn\u2019t figure out why others chose to mask what they truly felt. Jack wanted to spare his brother. Even in the Mire, where things like betrayal and punishment were kept in the family, no child was expected to kill his parent.</p> <p>The boy, no, the young man was looking at him.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d he told Jack. \u201cThat\u2019s one burden neither of you will have to carry.\u201d</p><p>NINE</p><p>\u201cYOU look good,\u201d John Drayton said from the opposite end of his cabin. \u201cSolid. All grown-up. I remember when you were sickly. You kept raising animals because you couldn\u2019t stand to watch something die. I take it you\u2019ve gotten over that.\u201d</p><p>George examined the man in front of him. The key was to cordon off his own anger and evaluate him as he would any other opponent. The years had banged John around, but he was in good health. He ate well and carried a few extra pounds. The air in the cabin hinted at the spicy notes of his cologne. His clothes were well cut from good fabric. His hair was professionally shorn to flatter his face. John Drayton was a vain man, and he liked spending money on himself.</p><p>George remembered him as being big, a tall shadow. He remembered him being funny. He would make jokes.</p><p>The thought spurred the vicious part of him into a gallop. Jokes. Right.</p><p>For the first hour and a half, John had kept his mouth shut, probably waiting for him to talk. Waiting for \u201cHow could you abandon us, Father?\u201d and \u201cI\u2019ve waited for you to come back, Father!\u201d Waiting for some tell, some clue or lever to push. Keep waiting, scumbag.</p><p>Most people didn\u2019t handle silence well, and John had banked on it and lost. George had no problem with silence. It was an effective tool, and he\u2019d seen his Mirror handlers use it to great effect. Having finally realized that no clues would be coming, John decided to start talking and probe for weaknesses. George had sat in on enough of the Mirror\u2019s interrogations to guess the most likely course this conversation would take: John would try to bridge the gap between the six-year-old sickly child he left behind and the sixteen-year-old he saw now.</p><p>\u201cYou remember what I told you when I left?\u201d</p><p>Like an open book.</p><p>\u201cI said\u2014\u201d</p><p>You mind the family, Georgie. Keep an eye on your sister and brother for me.</p><p>\u201c\u2014for you to keep an eye on your sister and brother for me. You\u2019ve done good. Jack\u2019s still alive, that\u2019s something. Couldn\u2019t have been easy to make that miracle happen.\u201d</p><p>What do you know about it? What do you know about Jack, about his rages, about his not understanding how people think, about Rose spending hours to coax him back to humanity? What do you know, you slimy weasel? You know nothing of our family. You chose to know nothing.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s Rose?\u201d</p><p>Where were you when she worked herself into the ground? Oh, that\u2019s right, getting rich from misery, rape, and pain.</p><p>\u201cYou afraid to speak to me, George?\u201d John slapped his palm on the desk. \u201cDamn it, boy. Tell me how my daughter is!\u201d</p><p>George moved Lynda a step closer. \u201cDo that again, and I\u2019ll let her gnaw on your neck, slowly, one bite a time. Rose will be delighted when I bring her your head.\u201d</p><p>John leaned back. Fear shot through his eyes. He hid it fast, but George had seen it. Yes, he knew the type. John would do anything, say anything to avoid physical pain and punishment. He feared being held accountable more than anything.</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t do that,\u201d John said. \u201cNot the Georgie I remember. The Georgie I remember was kind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Georgie you remember had a father.\u201d Argh. He knew he shouldn\u2019t have responded to the bait. Too late now.</p><p>John\u2019s face brightened. \u201cYou still have one. Look, I know I haven\u2019t done right by you kids. And it\u2019s not like I set out to haul slaves for a living. I just kind of fell into it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo tell. How does one fall into slavery?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe same way one falls into anything.\u201d John spread his arms. He was becoming more animated, happy he\u2019d found some common ground. \u201cYou\u2019re hard-up for cash, and one day in port, a man asks you if you want to make some easy money.\u201d</p><p>Easy-breezy. No need to worry about paltry things like honor, integrity, and sleeping well at night.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the only kind of money you were ever interested in, isn\u2019t it? The easy money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, I work hard just like anybody else. I just had a stretch of hard luck there for a while.\u201d John leaned forward. \u201cGeorgie, listen to me. Whatever else happens, I\u2019m still your father. I\u2019ve done pretty well for myself here, and I wanted to come and find you guys. I kept thinking, just do one more run, get a little bit more money, then I\u2019ll split. But I\u2019m in a good place now, and I\u2019m sick of these slaver assholes. We can take off, you know. You and me. I can show you the ropes, bring you into the family business. I\u2019m a good sailor, Georgie. Let me tell you, when you go out on the ocean and leave the shore behind, it\u2019s something. Just water everywhere, sapphire blue for miles and miles. Water, wind, and sky. You can taste the freedom. There is adventure there. Mystery.\u201d</p><p>He was good.</p><p>\u201cWhat about Jack?\u201d</p><p>John shrugged. \u201cWhat about him? Jack\u2019s a good kid. Didn\u2019t go nuts like his people do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis people?\u201d</p><p>John leaned closer. \u201cOh, come on, Georgie. We all know it. Rose is mine, you\u2019re mine, but Jack was never mine. For him to be what he is, one of his parents had to be a changeling, and there ain\u2019t no changelings in my family or your mother\u2019s. I checked. My father wasn\u2019t one, my mother isn\u2019t one . . .\u201d</p><p>George fought against grinding his teeth.</p><p>\u201cTheir parents weren\u2019t changelings, and on your mother\u2019s side, nobody was one for three generations back either. Your mother, she wasn\u2019t a bad woman, but she was troubled. You think it was easy knowing she opened her legs to every bastard that came through town? It hurt me. Really hurt me, but I\u2019ve come to terms with it. And so should you. You always looked out for Jack. Rose and your grandma, they put that burden on you, and I never thought it was fair. Everyone deserves a break, Georgie. Everyone. Come with me. Jack can look after himself. And later, when you\u2019re older and I\u2019m ready to retire, you can take over. This ship isn\u2019t just named after me. It\u2019s named after you, too.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>No, it isn\u2019t. He looked into John\u2019s eyes and saw a cold calculation there. In that moment George realized he would be dead the moment they left land behind. They\u2019d find what was left of him later, bobbing on the waves with his throat slit and his body torn by fish. My own father.</p><p>\u201cThank you, but I already have a career.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat sort of a career is that?\u201d John pointedly looked over his rags. \u201cIf you got one, it doesn\u2019t pay too well by the looks of it. No offense to you, boy, but you can do better. Or are you talking about those bandits over there? That\u2019s no good. We picked you up near Kelena, that means it\u2019s either the Rook, the families, or Jason Parris, and it has to be Parris, because the families know better, and Rook likes running his show personally, and I haven\u2019t seen him. Am I right? I am right. Parris is a ravenous shark, that\u2019s what he is. Cutthroat. Can you take a man\u2019s life, Georgie? You think about that because you\u2019ve got to be a cold, calculating killer to be in his company.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not with Jason Parris.\u201d George leaned back.</p><p>\u201cWho are you with, then?\u201d</p><p>George reached inside his sleeve, peeled off the coin he kept taped on his forearm, and tossed it to him. \u201cI\u2019m with the people who fish for ravenous sharks.\u201d</p><p>John caught the coin. The magic charge bit his fingers with tiny sparks. He flinched. The surface of the coin flowed, turning into a miniature mirror. Every agent of the Mirror carried one. Some wore rings, some had earrings, and some embedded it into a knife\u2019s hilt. He\u2019d chosen a coin. It seemed appropriate.</p><p>John stared at his own reflection. Blood drained from his face. John dropped the coin like it was hot.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m an underagent of the third degree, Father. I started when I was fourteen. My mission count is at twelve, ten successes and two aborts. My kill count is at seven, and I\u2019m very good with a rapier. In two years, when I complete my training, I\u2019ll be the youngest full-fledged agent in the Mirror\u2019s recent history. Coincidentally, in two more years I\u2019ll also graduate from Brasil\u2019s Academy, since I\u2019ve taken their entrance exams and passed them with a perfect score. There is a place for me waiting in the Diplomatic Corps.\u201d</p><p>John Drayton stared at him, his face slack with shock.</p><p>\u201cSo you see, Father, if I ever feel the need to play at being a sailor, a vessel will either be provided for me, or I\u2019ll purchase one. Given that my name is now George Camarine and the Duke of the Southern Provinces thinks of me as his grandson, I can afford an entire fleet. A small one, but it will be sufficient.\u201d George smiled, a controlled baring of teeth. \u201cI\u2019ve already accomplished more in my life than you could ever hope to achieve. Your promises of a grandiose smuggler life hold no attraction to me, so do be quiet, Father. I\u2019m fighting a strong urge to kill you, and I\u2019d hate to slip up and do you in before Jack comes back.\u201d</p><p>Knuckles rapped on the door.</p><p>\u201cEnter,\u201d George said.</p><p>The door swung open. Richard shouldered his way in, favoring his left side. His left arm rested in a sling. He had washed off his disguise and looked like himself. Jack followed, supporting Charlotte. She, on other hand, looked like a shadow of her former self: pale, exhausted, and sickly.</p> <p>\u201cDid you run into trouble?\u201d George asked.</p><p>\u201cSome,\u201d Richard said. \u201cAny problems?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone. Just talking to the dead man.\u201d</p><p>John licked his lips. \u201cWhat have I ever done to you that you hate me so much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe crew you were supposed to be meeting by Kelena was chasing me,\u201d Richard said. \u201cI\u2019m the Hunter.\u201d</p><p>John drew back.</p><p>\u201cI ended up at your mother\u2019s house,\u201d Richard said. \u201cWe\u2019re distantly related by marriage, and she recognized me and tried to help me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrandmother is dead,\u201d Jack said. \u201cThe slavers burned our house. You killed grandma, Dad.\u201d</p> <p>John\u2019s hands shook. He swallowed. \u201cI wasn\u2019t there.\u201d</p><p>Oh no, you don\u2019t get to weasel your way out of this one. \u201cNot directly, but you made it possible,\u201d George said. \u201cYou contributed.\u201d</p><p>John dragged his hand over his face and through his hair.</p><p>Richard took a piece of paper off the desk, wrote something on it, and pushed it across the desk to John. \u201cFive names. What do you know?\u201d</p><p>John looked at the list. His voice lost all emotion. \u201cThey\u2019re called the Council. That\u2019s where the real money goes. Maedoc is the muscle; he supplies the slavers. Casside is the main investor. I don\u2019t know what the other two do. Brennan runs the whole show. That\u2019s all I\u2019ve got. I\u2019m low on the ladder. If you expect me to testify, I won\u2019t. I\u2019ll never make it. Brennan will have my throat slit before I ever get a word out, and even if I did, it\u2019s all rumors. I never met any of them. We never talked. I follow the schedule, pick up slaves, bring them here, and get paid. That\u2019s the end of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m done with him.\u201d Richard turned to him. \u201cHe\u2019s yours.\u201d</p><p>Finally. He rose.</p><p>\u201cGeorge,\u201d Charlotte said softly.</p><p>He turned to her.</p><p>\u201cThink about what you\u2019re about to do. He is your father. Think about the cost.\u201d She glanced past him. \u201cThink about the guilt.\u201d</p><p>It dawned on him: Jack. Jack always wanted their father to return. When they were small, he used to sit in a tree, watching the road, waiting for him to come back. In elementary school, in the Broken, Jack would fight anyone who dared to say anything bad about their dad, and he would beat them bloody. George had no problem with his hands being bloody, and neither did Jack in the heat of the moment, but he might regret it later. Jack tended to brood, and sometimes his brooding took him to dark places. He was only fourteen.</p><p>John Drayton had to die. He had to pay the price for the inhumanities he helped commit, but George couldn\u2019t let John\u2019s death ruin his brother. The scumbag wasn\u2019t worth a single minute of Jack\u2019s self-loathing.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d George said. \u201cIt\u2019s not worth it. We\u2019ll get a boat, take him to the mainland, and have him put away. You\u2019ll be in prison for so long, you\u2019ll forget what the sun looks like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo what the boy says,\u201d Richard said.</p><p>John rose. \u201cRight.\u201d He reached out to ruffle Jack\u2019s hair. Jack pulled back, avoiding the touch.</p><p>John dropped his hand. \u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>They went out, Richard first, then John, and George, with Lynda in tow. Jack was the last.</p><p>Outside, the stench of smoke assaulted George\u2019s nostrils. The island town burned, the orange glow of its fire reflecting in the waters of the harbor. A cleansing fire, George decided. And a warning. Richard had unleashed Jason Parris on the island like a tornado. The news of the Market\u2019s burning would carry, and soon every slaver along the Eastern seaboard would know he wasn\u2019t invincible and his paycheck wasn\u2019t safe. It was a brilliant move. Richard was a born tactician. George would have to remember that.</p><p>The cabin door swung open behind him. Jack emerged.</p><p>Richard stepped closer to him. \u201cI need you to watch Charlotte for me. She overspent herself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy me?\u201d Jack asked.</p><p>\u201cBecause Jason\u2019s crew is full of bad men, and she\u2019s alone and vulnerable.\u201d</p><p>Jack glanced first at Richard, then at George. He wasn\u2019t quite buying it.</p><p>\u201cCan you just do one thing without arguing?\u201d George tossed his hair back. \u201cJust do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou owe me for the canal.\u201d</p><p>Jack growled something under his breath.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d Richard said. \u201cI haven\u2019t forgotten.\u201d</p><p>Forgotten what?</p><p>Jack shrugged and went into the cabin.</p><p>\u201cInto the boat.\u201d Richard pointed to a small barge waiting by the side of the vessel. They must\u2019ve used it to come aboard.</p><p>They got into the barge, Richard at the nose, then John Drayton. George sent Lynda in next, added insurance. Everyone sat. George took a seat at the stern, passed his hand over the motor, starting the magic chain reaction, and the boat sped across the harbor to the shore. Midway through it, George let go of Lynda. She pitched into the waves, softly, and sank into the cool, soothing depths to finally rest. He didn\u2019t need her anymore. Half a minute later the boat plowed into the soft sand of the beach. The two men stepped out. He followed.</p><p>\u201cStill protecting your brother,\u201d John said.</p><p>The frustration he had been holding in finally broke free. \u201cShut up. You don\u2019t know him. Don\u2019t talk about him. Because of you, M\u00e9m\u00e8re is dead. It\u2019s good that she\u2019s dead\u2014because if she knew what you\u2019ve become, it would kill her.\u201d</p><p>John inhaled. \u201cFine. Let\u2019s get this over with.\u201d</p><p>Richard pulled out his sword.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s my responsibility,\u201d George said. \u201cMy family and my shame.\u201d</p><p>John winced.</p><p>Richard held out his blade. George took it. The lean, razor-sharp sword felt so heavy. The hilt was cold. He concentrated, channeling his magic like a current of molten metal from his arm into his fingers, into the sword, and finally letting it stretch across the edge. The blade sparked with white. He\u2019d trained for months to learn how to do it, but now the magic coated the steel as if on its own.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t bring himself to raise the sword.</p><p>George was trapped between guilt and duty. The indecision hurt, deciding hurt more, and he was so monumentally angry at his father for making him choose. Was he really that weak?</p><p>\u201cC\u2019est la diff\u00e9rence entre lui et toi.\u201d Richard switched to the language of Louisiana.</p><p>This is the difference between you and him.</p><p>\u201cIf you raise that sword, you\u2019re letting his actions determine yours,\u201d Richard continued in Gaulish. \u201cYou\u2019re simply reacting to what he has already done. We are forever linked with those we kill. If you end his life, you will drag his corpse with you for the rest of yours. When your brother and sister look at you, they will see the killer of their father; when you look in the mirror, you will see a murderer. Had he lived with you and abused you or those close to you, ending his life might be cathartic, a sign of rebirth. But this man is a stranger to you. You barely know him. There is no empowerment in his death by your hand. He has no right to govern your life. Let your own actions define who you are.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He was right. Killing John Drayton simply wasn\u2019t worth it. If he forced himself to do it, he would regret it. It would eat at him, and why should he sentence himself to the same burden he tried to spare Jack?</p><p>George swallowed and slowly lowered his sword.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t do it, huh?\u201d John smiled. \u201cI\u2019m still your father, boy.\u201d</p> <p>The very fact that he was goading him meant killing him would be a bad idea. \u201cNo,\u201d George said. \u201cYou\u2019re not.

It had to end, here and now, so he would never darken his brother\u2019s or Rose\u2019s horizon.</p> <p>George turned to Richard.</p><p>\u201cTrust me,\u201d Richard said. \u201cIt\u2019s the right thing.\u201d</p><p>John hefted the gun in his hand, taking a couple of steps back. \u201cLoaded.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSix bullets,\u201d Richard said.</p><p>\u201cMore than enough.\u201d</p><p>John raised the gun. George stared down the black barrel, as big as a cannon. Everything around him stopped. The world gained a crystal clarity, and George saw everything in minute detail: the individual leaves of the palm behind his father, the bead of sweat on John\u2019s temple, the tiny red veins in his father\u2019s eyes . . .</p> <p>The sound of the safety being released rocked George like the blow of a giant hammer against his skull. He knew the bullet would hit him between the eyes. He was staring death in the face.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re an idiot,\u201d John said to Richard.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s your son,\u201d Richard said. His voice was calm, so calm.</p><p>He should do something, George realized. He should\u2014</p><p>\u201cYeah, about that,\u201d John grimaced. \u201cSorry, boy. I never thought you were mine either.\u201d</p><p>John squeezed the trigger. A bolt of white tore out of the gun and bit deep into John\u2019s chest. He convulsed soundlessly, like a marionette jerking on invisible strings, and fell into the sand.</p><p>George felt the moment his body crossed the threshold between life and death and into his domain. It\u2019s done, M\u00e9m\u00e8re. It\u2019s done. He won\u2019t hurt anyone else.</p><p>The relief washed over him, replaced instantly by shame. \u201cHow?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAn Owner\u2019s Gift necklace,\u201d Richard said. \u201cI loaded a stone into the chamber instead of a bullet. When he tried to fire, the stone shattered and released its magic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if he had walked away?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would\u2019ve stopped him and taken the stone out.\u201d</p><p>George couldn\u2019t tell if it was a convenient lie for his sake or the truth. The terrible thing was, he didn\u2019t even care. He was simply relieved that John Drayton was a corpse. What does that say about me?</p><p>Richard clamped his arm around him. \u201cHe died the way he lived. That\u2019s the kind of man he was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI waited for him.\u201d George barely recognized the hoarse, dull sound as his own voice. \u201cI waited for him for years. When Rose was working a crappy job in the Broken, I\u2019d sit on the porch, waiting for her to come home, and pretend I saw him walking up to the house. He would come up with a big smile and tell me, \u2018George, come sailing with me. We\u2019ll look for treasure together.\u2019\u201d</p><p>His eyes watered. He forced the tears back. \u201cHe tried to get me to abandon my own brother. He tried to kill me. I looked into his eyes. They were cold, like a shark\u2019s.\u201d He wanted to cry and scream like a child.</p><p>\u201cNone of what he did or what he had become is your responsibility,\u201d Richard said. \u201cHe was a grown man, and he\u2019s responsible for his own sins. Everything he did in his life led him to this point. I knew he would pull the trigger. It was as inevitable as the sunrise.\u201d</p><p>George stared at him. \u201cI should\u2019ve done it. I should\u2019ve ended it . . . him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou feel that way in the heat of the moment because you look at your father and see the legacy of his crimes. It brings you deep shame. You want to wipe it clean and right the wrongs, but killing him wouldn\u2019t undo them,\u201d Richard said.</p><p>\u201cMy youngest brother betrayed our family and our relatives died because of it. His cousins, his nieces, nephews, children, people who loved him and cared for him. He broke bread with us, he shared in our sorrow and happiness, then he betrayed us. He was a deeply selfish human being. He watched our father being murdered; he was hurt, and he wanted revenge. That was all that mattered to him. I looked into his eyes, when he told me he\u2019d done it deliberately, and it was like looking into the soul of a stranger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to him?\u201d For some reason the answer seemed vitally important.</p><p>\u201cWe forced him to walk with us into the final battle. I saw him on the battlefield. I thought it was my fault, because he was my brother and he had put the family at risk. But I\u2019ve realized he\u2019d made his own choices. I could\u2019ve killed him, but I chose to walk away. I\u2019ve ended a lot of lives, but I\u2019m relieved I didn\u2019t take his. He wasn\u2019t among the dead when we were done, so he\u2019s still out there somewhere.\u201d</p><p>Richard bent to look into George\u2019s eyes. \u201cYour father made his own destiny, and the weight of it crushed him. He was fated to die here, by his own hand. No regrets, George. No guilt, no shame. Leave it here on this beach. If you carry it, it will poison you. Come. We must get back to the ship.\u201d</p><p>Richard led him back into the boat. They sped across the harbor back to the ship.</p><p>George stared at the water. He hurt, and he cradled that knot of pain in the pit of his stomach and tried to grow a callus over the wound.</p><p>RICHARD stepped onto the deck of the ship. Ahead of him George ducked into the cabin. Richard turned and looked at the inferno claiming the island. Orange flames raged, sending plumes of greasy black smoke into the sky. Distant screams echoed, some of fury, some of pain. A ship sank slowly to the left, the lone vessel that had attempted to escape the slaughter. Jason\u2019s cannons had fired a single shot from the fort, and the glancing blow had crippled the stately yacht. The magic-operated pumps had managed to keep it afloat, but they were slowly losing the battle, and now the elegant vessel careened, serving as a warning to anyone else contemplating a quick escape.</p><p>This is what hell must look like.</p><p>A small flotilla of boats departed from the docks and sped across the water, their magic-fueled motors leaving pale trails of luminescence in their wake. Jason\u2019s crew was coming back.</p><p>The door of the cabin swung open behind him. \u201cRichard!\u201d</p><p>He turned.</p><p>Charlotte marched at him, buoyed by anger, the outrage so plain on her face, she nearly glowed. She had drained all of her reserves on the island. She couldn\u2019t have recovered in the scant fifteen minutes it took them to ride to the beach and back. Worry squirmed through him. If she wasn\u2019t careful, the exertion would kill her.</p><p>\u201cDid you let that child kill his father?\u201d</p><p>He marveled at her fury.</p><p>\u201cAnswer me, you heartless bastard!\u201d</p><p>This place, this hell on earth, should\u2019ve broken her. Charlotte should\u2019ve given up by now, beaten down by the horrors and fatigue. But she must\u2019ve seen the pain in George, and it propelled her to confront him. She would never compromise herself, Richard realized. She would never become jaded or lose her resolve. No matter how many dead bodies she walked by, it would always bother her. She had the nobility of spirit to which he aspired and which he so sorely lacked. She wasn\u2019t naive or blind; she simply chose to do what was right, no matter the personal cost.</p><p>He wanted this woman more than he had wanted anything in his entire world. Life with her would never be easy, but he would be proud of it.</p><p>He wanted her so much, it almost hurt.</p><p>In his mind, the ship split, she on one end of a chasm, he on the other. Between lay all the things he had done and she had seen him do. They had too much to overcome. It would never happen. When all was said and done, she wouldn\u2019t want a hardened killer with blood on his hands. She would want someone who\u2019d make her forget this hell.</p><p>\u201cRichard, don\u2019t just stand there. I deserve an answer!\u201d</p><p>\u201cJohn Drayton took his own life,\u201d he said. \u201cGeorge had no part in his death. He did witness it. It was good for him. It brought things to a conclusion.\u201d</p><p>She looked at him for a long moment, her gray eyes bright, almost silver. Maybe there was some chance of something . . . ?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a heartless bastard,\u201d he told her, wishing he could close the distance between them. \u201cBut even I wouldn\u2019t let a child murder his own father. Is that how you see me? Am I a complete monster in your eyes, Charlotte?\u201d</p><p>She turned and walked away. He closed his eyes, inhaling the smoke from the funeral pyre that was the Isle of Divine Na. Well, there it was. He had his confirmation.</p><p>She would be free of him soon. They had the ledgers. It would all be over in a matter of days.</p><p>\u201cRichard!\u201d Charlotte called.</p><p>He turned.</p><p>She stood by the cabin. \u201cYou\u2019re not a monster. You\u2019re the most noble man I\u2019ve ever met. In every sense of the word. I wish . . .\u201d</p><p>His pulse sped up.</p><p>Jason Parris bounded onto the deck. \u201cAm I interrupting something?\u201d</p><p>Charlotte closed her mouth.</p><p>Gods damn him. He would strangle that moron and throw his lifeless body overboard.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Parris grinned. \u201cWell, too bad. We need to haul ass out of here.\u201d</p><p>Jason\u2019s crew flooded the ship, lowering the nets to haul up bags of plundered goods.</p><p>\u201cIf I had fifty extra men, I could own this island.\u201d Jason swept the burning city with his hand. \u201cI\u2019d make it into my own Tortuga.\u201d</p><p>A pirate port of the Broken. He\u2019d read about it in books. \u201cAdrianglia would hardly tolerate Tortuga so close to its shores. What are you planning to do when the Adrianglian Navy blockades the island and starts pounding it with carriage-sized magic missiles?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDuck and cover?\u201d Jason flashed his teeth. \u201cWhat happened to your arm, old man? Did the mighty Hunter actually get hurt this time?\u201d</p><p>Charlotte\u2019s knees folded, and she slid along the cabin\u2019s wall to the deck.</p><p>He shoved Jason out of the way, cleared the distance between them, and dropped to his knees. \u201cCharlotte?\u201d</p> <p>She looked at him, her eyes clear. \u201cWell, this is embarrassing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she said. \u201cMortified, but fine. I shouldn\u2019t have marched out here. I\u2019ve overextended myself. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s anything life-threatening, but I\u2019m probably going to lose consciousness. Please don\u2019t leave me here on the deck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d He wrapped his right arm around her. She leaned against him, her forehead resting against his cheek. He couldn\u2019t believe he was touching her. \u201cI promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook at the two of you,\u201d Jason said above him. \u201cYou\u2019re a sorry-looking mess. Maybe after this, you should plan something less tiring. A tea party or a book club or whatever you senior citizens do in your spare time. Look at me\u2014six men dead, the city looted, and I\u2019m good. Look at my crew. Are y\u2019all tired?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo!\u201d a dozen people roared.</p><p>\u201cSee? Fresh as daisies.\u201d</p><p>Richard growled low in his throat. One day . . .</p><p>Charlotte caressed his cheek. Her lips brushed his, and he forgot where he was or what he was doing.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said.</p><p>He held still for a full minute before he finally realized that she had drifted off into sleep.</p> <p>WHEN Charlotte awoke, she was lying on a cushioned seat, under a blanket. Around her, the polished walls of the horseless phaeton glowed in the sunlight filtering through the gauzy curtain. Sealed behind smooth, transparent pseudoresin, the structure of the phaeton consisted of gears and delicate metalwork, with glowing, hair-thin threads of magic running through it all. Faint lights of warm amber-and-green magic slid along the threads once in a while, melting into the metalwork, like man-made will-o\u2019-the-wisps. Drowsy and comfortable on the soft seat, she watched the soothing interplay of magic and metal. It occurred to her that she had no idea how the phaeton actually worked. She had ridden in them a hundred times and never thought to find out.</p><p>Someone was watching her. Charlotte turned her head. Across from her, Richard sat in the contoured seat. He still wore the same clothes, smelling of smoke. His hair was a mess. His arm rested in a sling. He was ridiculously handsome, and his dark eyes were warm, almost inviting.</p><p>Last night was a blur. She remembered being so tired, waiting for Richard and George to return. George\u2019s story made no sense, and she chased Richard on the deck and demanded to know if he let George kill his own father. Her mind boggled at the idea that he would force the child to live with that kind of guilt. It would scar George in a way nobody could heal.</p><p>Richard looked her straight in the eye, standing there against the backdrop of the burning city, like some beautiful demon, and said nothing. Then she raged at him and accused him of being heartless. He had the strangest look in his eyes, then he told her John Drayton killed himself. She believed him. Richard didn\u2019t lie.</p><p>And then he\u2019d asked her if she thought he was a monster.</p><p>She wanted to tell him then. She wanted to explain the rush of gratitude she felt when he offered her his arm on the bow of the brigantine. She wanted to tell him that she admired him for making a stand and that she wished she could\u2019ve met him before all this happened, before she had thrown her life away.</p><p>Then Jason\u2019s crew boarded the ship, and she had nearly fainted like some weak-nerved fool. Her legs refused to support her, and she went down like a cloth doll. Somehow, she had gone the entire thirty-two years of her life without fainting once, and now she\u2019d managed to almost do it twice in a day. It had to be some sort of record. So shameful. Some partner she turned out to be. It\u2019s a wonder she didn\u2019t die of sheer embarrassment.</p><p>Richard had come to her rescue. She remembered his scent as he wrapped his arm around her, the smell of sweat and smoke and sandalwood, a rich, smooth, earthy, powerful redolence that took her to places she had no business going. She had said something in her addled state she couldn\u2019t remember.</p> <p>\u201cWhere are the boys?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn front,\u201d he said. \u201cThey insisted on driving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the dog?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s with them. You will have to name him at some point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHalf an hour from Camarine Manor,\u201d Richard was still watching her with that warm look in his eyes. \u201cWe\u2019re almost there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlready?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s late afternoon,\u201d he said. \u201cWe left Kelena at dawn and rode nonstop through the day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you still have the ledgers?\u201d</p><p>He reached into a bag lying by his feet and pulled out an edge of the small red leather book.</p><p>It slowly dawned on her then. The horrors of last night were over, and she could let them fade from her, as if it were all a terrible nightmare. They had their proof. They would take it to the Marshal of the Southern Provinces, and the slave trade would be no more. She\u2019d been too spent and traumatized to recognize it last night, but now she finally understood.</p><p>They had won.</p><p>She looked at Richard. \u201cWe won.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe did.\u201d He smiled. It was a genuine, beautiful smile that pulled her as if she were a speck of iron and he a powerful magnet, its lure so sudden and strong, she pressed her back deeper against the carriage seat. She\u2019d kissed him last night before passing out. She was almost sure of it.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right, my lady?\u201d he asked.</p><p>That \u201cmy lady\u201d slid over her soul like soft velvet over skin. \u201cFine, thank you.\u201d</p><p>She waited, but he said nothing more. He made no move toward her. He was probably letting her collect her wits. She thought he wanted her, but maybe she\u2019d read too much into a look. Maybe there was no mutual attraction. Charlotte searched her memory, trying to scrounge up some definitive evidence that he was drawn to her. She could find none. She thought she heard something in his voice or saw something in his eyes, but she barely knew him. They\u2019d been together for a mere two days. She could\u2019ve been mistaken.</p><p>She had thrown away everything she was taught and willingly walked into hell, where she had murdered countless people. It filled her with self-loathing. She hated what she\u2019d become, and she wanted reassurance that she still deserved to be loved. It was coloring her judgment. Richard had made it clear where his priorities lay. True, he always addressed her with complete courtesy and tried to protect her from harm, but she was a useful tool. Any man with exposure to the Weird\u2019s customs would afford her that courtesy, because she was a blueblood and a woman.</p><p>She had to stop deluding herself. She had let her fantasies carry her away once, and she was now perfectly aware of the monsters and heartbreak that lay in wait on that path. She\u2019d made a fool of herself already. If he had any tact\u2014and Richard had tact in spades\u2014he wouldn\u2019t mention it.</p><p>She summoned whatever poise she could muster. \u201cHow\u2019s your wound?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter. It\u2019s so kind of you to ask, my lady.\u201d</p><p>And why in the world did his \u201cmy lady\u201d sound like an endearment to her ears? Charlotte scanned his injury. It was regenerating well, but a budding infection promised to blossom into a serious problem. \u201cI\u2019ll need to heal you when we stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not now?\u201d He touched the curve of the seat next to him.</p><p>She blinked. He was sprawled on the seat, tall, handsome, dangerous, and he was smiling. It was a wicked smile, inviting, no, seductive, as if he was promising her that if she sat next to him, he would claim her, and she would enjoy it.</p><p>Get a grip. You\u2019re not some schoolgirl. Charlotte forced a shrug and invited him to the seat next to her with a nonchalant wave of her hand. \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>Richard rose and sat next to her. She caught a hint of the same scent she remembered from last night, a rich, slightly spicy sandalwood mixed with smoke. Gods, this wasn\u2019t any better.</p><p>Don\u2019t look at his eyes or his smile, and you\u2019ll be fine. Her gaze paused on the sharp line of his jaw, his lips . . . She wanted to kiss him.</p><p>Argh.</p><p>She forced herself to concentrate on the injury, which was hidden by his doublet. His arm was out of the sling. \u201cWhy did you put your doublet back on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt seemed like a bad idea to travel surrounded by cutthroats with my bum arm on display. Jason\u2019s people are like sharks, you see. A hint of weakness, and they\u2019ll rip you to pieces.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake off your shirt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid I may need some help.\u201d</p><p>She could\u2019ve sworn there was a hint of humor in his voice. Perhaps he found her attraction amusing. It seemed out of character for him to toy with her, but then, men did strange things when women were involved. Perhaps he was laughing over her discomfort in his head.</p><p>She had to stop letting her thoughts run around like wild horses. They were carrying her off to crazy places. He needed help getting the jacket off? Fine. She would assist him. Charlotte stood up and gently helped him pull the doublet off, revealing a long-sleeved dark tunic underneath. She would\u2019ve liked to yank it off of him, just to make her point, but her professional pride wouldn\u2019t permit her to purposefully cause pain to a patient.</p><p>His arm was still covered by the sleeve of the tunic. Would she have to peel it off him? Her mind conjured up images of his body beneath the tunic, the tight, strong muscle under the bronzed skin. No. No, that was completely out of the question.</p><p>\u201cDo you have a knife?\u201d Charlotte asked.</p><p>He pulled a knife out and offered it to her, handle first.</p><p>\u201cPerfect.\u201d She took the knife and slit his sleeve, exposing the bandage. She handed the knife back to him. He reached for it. His fingers brushed hers, and every nerve in her stood at full alert. Utterly ridiculous.</p><p>She removed the tape and the bandages. The cut hadn\u2019t bled as much as she expected. Richard had a remarkable talent for quick recovery. She touched the gash, letting the current of golden sparks wash over it. Richard held completely still. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re permitted to wince,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cOnly if you promise not to tell anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour secret is safe with me.\u201d</p> <p>She placed her hand over the wound, her fingers touching his carved biceps, and channeled her magic, repairing injured tissue, melding the blood vessels, and purging any hints of infection. She sealed the skin, painfully aware that he was sitting right there, only inches away. She wanted his tunic off. She wanted to touch that bronzed skin and slide her hand up the hard ridges of his stomach to caress his chest.</p><p>\u201cAll done,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>An ugly mess of a burn scar crossed his shoulder a couple of inches above the wound. The edges of the scar were perfectly straight as if someone had heated a rectangle of metal and pressed it against the flesh.</p><p>\u201cMay I?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>She touched it. The heated metal had to have been held to the skin for at least a few seconds. \u201cWere you branded?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a manner of speaking.\u201d</p><p>Barbaric, to inflict this sort of pain on a human being. \u201cWho did this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did it.\u201d</p><p>She looked at him. \u201cYou did this to yourself? Why?\u201d</p> <p>He sighed. \u201cI had a tattoo on my shoulder. I wanted it gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you thought disfiguring yourself was the best way to go about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt seemed fitting at the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat in the world was on your shoulder that you wanted it gone so badly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy wife\u2019s name,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She pulled back. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean to pry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve come to terms with it. I was young and very much in love. I did ridiculous things like pick wildflowers and leave them on her balcony, so when she woke up, she would see them first thing in the morning.\u201d</p><p>No man had ever brought her flowers. Elvei favored more substantial gifts. It must\u2019ve been so sweet to wake up to a balcony filled with wildflowers. It was at odds with who he was now: a grim swordsman who killed so efficiently, it could\u2019ve been an art.</p> <p>\u201cI wrote dreadful poetry. After we were married, I\u2019d hide small gifts for her around the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t known you that long, but that doesn\u2019t seem like you, Richard. You are . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cBitter? Fatalistic?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPractical.\u201d</p><p>He grinned at her. \u201cAs I said, I was young and romantic. Or a sappy moron, as my brother put it. Marissa hated the Mire. She hated everything about it. I wanted her more than anything, so I became what I thought she wanted in order to win her. It worked. She married me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe must\u2019ve loved you.\u201d How could you not love him?</p><p>Richard sighed. \u201cShe decided I was the best she could get under the circumstances. The Mire is sectioned off from the rest of the Edge: impassable swamps on both sides, the State of Louisiana on the border with the Broken, the Dukedom of Louisiana in the Weird on the other. The trek to the Broken is long and dangerous, and a lot of us from the old Mire families can\u2019t pass through the boundary. Too much magic in our blood. On the other hand, the border with the Dukedom is heavily guarded. Louisiana is aware that the Edge exists, and it uses the Mire to dump its exiles, so they don\u2019t want anyone coming back across the boundary. The swamp resources are limited, and the number of people keeps rising as Louisiana shoves more and more of its undesirables across the border.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt sounds hellish,\u201d she said honestly.</p><p>\u201cIt has a certain primeval, savage beauty. In the morning, when the mist rises above the water and the giant alligators sing, the swamps have an almost otherworldly air. My family was . . . better off than some. We were numerous, we owned land, and we had a reputation of retaliating fast and hard.\u201d</p><p>She could believe that. A whole clan of swordsmen like him would give anyone pause. \u201cAnd your wife?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was born in the Mire, a daughter of an exile from the Dukedom of Louisiana and a local woman.\u201d He leaned closer. \u201cYou see, our family also had Vernard. He was an exile, a blueblood of the finest bloodline. His entire family had been sent to the Mire with him, and my uncle married his daughter. Vernard took over our education. I was his finest pupil.\u201d</p><p>So that was it. Like she, Richard had had the benefit of personal instruction from a blueblood peer of the realm. That\u2019s why his manners and poise were so polished. Living in the Mire must\u2019ve been terrible for Richard. To have the self-awareness and know that there is a better place out there that was out of reach.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t like most men of the Mire, and that appealed to Marissa. She had grown up on her father\u2019s stories of mansions and balls, and I was as close to that as she could find in the swamp. She was very beautiful, and I was like a blind man who suddenly saw the sun.\u201d A mordant smile stretched his lips. \u201cKaldar almost never stops and thinks about the consequences of his actions. Something is fun or not fun, and my brother\u2019s fun often lands him in interesting places such as jails or castles belonging to California robber barons. Where other people see certain death, my brother sees an opportunity for a hilarious, thrilling adventure. But when I got the tattoo, Kaldar warned me that marrying her was a bad idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat should\u2019ve stopped me in my tracks, but it didn\u2019t. I married her. She wanted a clean house free of the swamp\u2019s mud, and I gave it to her. She wanted clothes from the Weird. I bought them when I could find a smuggler.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what went wrong?\u201d It was inappropriate to pry, but she couldn\u2019t help herself.</p><p>\u201cHer grandmother died.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas it very traumatic?\u201d Sometimes the death of a family member caused an irreversible shift in one\u2019s life. She was a prime example of that.</p><p>\u201cNo. Marissa\u2019s grandfather had passed away earlier, and her grandmother left the entirety of their savings to her. It was enough to buy her passage out of the Mire into the Broken, purchase false documents, and start a new life there.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte recoiled. \u201cBut you couldn\u2019t go.\u201d</p><p>Richard nodded. There was a shadow of old pain in his smile and in his eyes. She had an urge to throw her arms around him and kiss him until it went away.</p><p>\u201cShe waited until I was out in the swamp on a family errand and left. When I came back, there was a note on the kitchen table and a collection of the things I\u2019d given her. Jewelry, books, her wedding ring. She took nothing that would remind me of her or the house. The note told me that I\u2019d been a good husband, but this was her way out of the swamp, and she had to take it.\u201d</p><p>She left him? She had left this man? Unbelievable. Charlotte almost shook her head. She would give anything to have Richard bring her flowers.</p><p>\u201cDid you go after her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was no point. She had made it clear she didn\u2019t want me, and I still had some pride. I got drunk. At some point I burned off her name. I recall doing it, but I couldn\u2019t tell you when. I was drunk for a long time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you ever find out what happened to her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Kaldar came across her on one of his excursions to Louisiana. She\u2019s married to a man who owns a store that sells man-made ponds and fountains for people\u2019s yards. She works in the store as well. They have three children, two of their own and a boy from his previous marriage. Kaldar asked me if I wanted him to ruin their little haven. I knew at that moment that despite all my efforts, I was a flawed man because for a few minutes I seriously considered taking him up on it. But I managed to walk away from it.\u201d Richard grimaced. \u201cAnd now I\u2019ve told you my sob story, and it wasn\u2019t my intention.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have my word that I won\u2019t share it,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what is it?\u201d</p><p>He clamped his jaws shut, the line of his mouth resolute.</p><p>\u201cRichard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to seem like a pathetic, moonstruck fool,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cSo far, you\u2019ve seen me as a killer, you\u2019ve seen me as a monster, and now I\u2019ve added a doleful sentimentality to it, setting myself up to be pitied or laughed at. I keep missing the mark.\u201d</p><p>Her pulse sped up. Charlotte caught her breath. \u201cAnd what\u2019s the mark?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe mark is where I seem capable and confident. A better man than I am.\u201d</p><p>He was looking at her again with that intense male need. She couldn\u2019t possibly be imagining it. It was right there. She wondered if he even realized what his stare communicated. No, probably not.</p><p>He wanted to seem better for her sake. He wanted her to like him, and he\u2019d told her something he hadn\u2019t meant to share. She wanted to tell him she understood, to share something equally intimate . . .</p><p>\u201cI almost murdered my ex-husband.\u201d It just popped out of her. Dawn Mother, why in the world did she say that? Of all the things she could\u2019ve told him, that was the last one on the list.</p><p>Richard\u2019s eyes widened.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m such an idiot,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>The phaeton came to a stop. She glanced out of the window in reflex. A beautiful manor lay before them, three stories of beige stone walls, arched windows, and a grand cascade of pale stairs rolling onto the green lawn.</p><p>George opened the door. \u201cWelcome to Camarine Manor.\u201d</p><p>He held out his arm to her. She rested her hand on it and stepped out. Three people waited for them at the top of the stairs. The man was unquestionably a blueblood: tall, wide-shouldered, built for battle. His face was classically beautiful, even more so because he\u2019d chosen to pull back his long, pale blond hair into a low ponytail and the hairstyle accentuated the masculine cut of his jaw.</p><p>The woman next to him had to be Rose. She had a perfect figure, not obviously lean, nor voluptuous, but rather fit. Her face was delicate, with fine features and big eyes framed in dense natural eyelashes, for which at a certain point of her life, Charlotte would\u2019ve given her right arm. Her Edge heritage was obvious. It wasn\u2019t her lack of beauty or poise that gave her away, it was her choice of styling. She was off ever so slightly, but to high society, she might as well have hung a sign around her neck that said \u201cAmateur.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her gown was probably cut in the latest fashion\u2014the fabric was of good quality, and the workmanship looked flawless\u2014but the pale yellow, an attractive color on its own, wasn\u2019t flattering to her skin. Her hair was overly elaborate for an evening at home, and the style her curls were arranged in was decidedly winter instead of late spring. The entire package seemed more suited to a slightly older woman, one who had earned the right to veer from the latest trend by virtue of her status, accomplishments, or reputation. Rose was still in the age bracket where women were expected to be on the cusp of fashion. She was likely modeling herself after another woman\u2019s example, perhaps the earl\u2019s mother or his much older sister.</p><p>The Camarines surely had hired a stylist, but no woman wanted to be consistently told that her taste in clothes was flawed. If \u00c9l\u00e9onore\u2019s stories of Rose\u2019s character were true, she either got exasperated and fired the stylist, or more likely, consulted him only on special occasions. She didn\u2019t commit any fashion crimes, by any means, but she wouldn\u2019t be held up as an example of what to do either.</p><p>On second look, the earl favored a slightly older cut to his clothes as well. He knew, Charlotte realized. He understood that Rose was off by half an inch and adjusted his attire to match. She was so loved. A familiar pain, dulled by time, stabbed at Charlotte. They had that thing she so wanted and was denied. Rose was so very lucky.</p> <p>A young girl stood on Rose\u2019s left\u2019s side, no more than fifteen. Charlotte looked at her face and had to fight to keep from staring. The girl was exquisitely beautiful. Not just pretty, beautiful, almost shockingly so. Her face, a perfect oval, had the coveted high cheekbones and the small yet full mouth. Her nose suggested a touch of something exotic, its lines straight but slightly unusual for Adrianglia, and her eyes reinforced it. Large, wide, yet lightly elongated at the inner corners, they hinted at some mystery, some uncommon heritage and the promise of a dangerous edge. She wasn\u2019t just stunning, she looked interesting, which was infinitely more important than classic perfection or beauty. She could\u2019ve walked into a ballroom filled with people, and every single one of them would pause for a second look.</p><p>That dark haunting beauty seemed familiar, but they hadn\u2019t met before. Charlotte was sure of it.</p><p>Richard opened his arms.</p><p>The girl dashed down the stairs.</p><p>He picked her up and hugged her, and Charlotte realized where she had seen her before: there were echoes of Richard in that beautiful face. Did he have a daughter? No, it couldn\u2019t be\u2014he\u2019d said he was childless.</p> <p>\u201cRichard,\u201d Declan said. \u201cGood to see you in one piece. Why are the boys with you?\u201d</p><p>Rose was looking past them to her brothers. \u201cDid something happen? Why do the two of you look like that?\u201d</p><p>George took a deep breath.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll just draw it out.\u201d Jack pushed forward, past his brother.</p><p>Oh no.</p><p>\u201cGrandmother is dead. Dad was working for people who killed her. George killed Dad, although he won\u2019t admit it.\u201d</p> <p>Charlotte was looking straight at Rose, and she saw the precise moment when the other woman\u2019s world broke to pieces.</p><p>CHARLOTTE sat in the soft chair in Declan Camarine\u2019s study. Richard rested in the other one. The girl sat at his feet on the floor like a loyal puppy, her pose completely at odds with her clothes or age. They should\u2019ve been introduced, but everyone had more important things to do. Somewhere in the house, Rose was trying to make sense of what happened. Her brothers were with her. Charlotte had tried to offer some consolation, but it was pretty clear that Rose needed her privacy, so she came with Richard instead.</p><p>At his desk, Declan closed the red ledger. \u201cThe evidence is damning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt shows a direct financial trail,\u201d Richard said.</p><p>\u201cThat it does.\u201d Declan\u2019s face wore a grim expression. She had expected him to be more celebratory. Perhaps he was shocked by the contents or maybe the raw impact of the tragedy his wife was trying to overcome still stunned him. \u201cIt fits perfectly. Brennan\u2019s position with the Department of the Interior would permit him to keep tabs on my office. He oversees internal security. My people are legally bound to inform the Department of the Interior of any operation that requires the transport of more than ten marshals. He knew where we would strike before we had a chance to get there.\u201d</p><p>Declan fell silent.</p><p>\u201cAnd, my lord?\u201d Charlotte prompted gently.</p><p>He looked at her. \u201cAnd if it was anyone but Brennan, I would act on it immediately.\u201d</p> <p>Richard leaned forward, focused. \u201cThe numbers don\u2019t lie. Audit his accounts. You\u2019ll see the record of payments made to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf it was anyone else, my name and position alone would be sufficient to instantly gain access and isolate the suspect from any channels of influence. But in this case, he is the cousin of the king,\u201d Declan said. \u201cHis favorite cousin, the man whom the King sees as his younger brother. I know Brennan. He is smart, and he navigates the waters of the Department of the Interior like he owns them. He doesn\u2019t make mistakes.</p><p>\u201cIf I request an audit based on the existence of this ledger, I would have to throw all of my pull and all that of my father\u2019s and mother\u2019s reputation just to get a foot in the door. The ledger will be reviewed by half a dozen people, none of whom want to pin a target to their own chests. Brennan will know about it almost immediately. Someone will tell him simply for a chance to be invited to the next royal picnic. I\u2019ll be asked how I came into possession of the ledger, a question, like many others, I\u2019ll have to dodge.</p><p>\u201cDays will pass, the investigation into the ledger will drag on, until he\u2019ll finally come forward and offer to simply settle this because he has nothing to hide. We will perform the audit and find nothing. The ledger will be denounced as a fake. Apologies will be rendered, throughout which he will appear magnanimous and gracious, while I will be painted as overeager, earnest, and naive at best, and jealous and harboring a deep vendetta against Brennan at worst. My credibility will be shot, forcing me to step down, and with me out of the way, Brennan will be free to rebuild his vile enterprise at his leisure.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte sat in stunned silence. The shreds of their victory floated about her, melting into nothing.</p><p>\u201cSo this is it? It was for nothing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Declan said. \u201cWe know who he is now, which means we can more effectively cut him off from access to our antislaver operations. He\u2019s suffered a catastrophic loss from the sacking of the Market. If we consistently dismantle the slave trade, ruining his profits over the course of the next few years, he may decide that continuing his oversight is too expensive . . .\u201d</p><p>Tulip\u2019s tortured face flashed before her. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>The two men looked at her.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she repeated. \u201cNot good enough. A few years? Do you have any idea what I\u2019ve seen? Do you know at what cost those few years will come?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCharlotte,\u201d Richard said quietly. The adolescent girl was staring at her, dark eyes alarmed.</p><p>She checked herself and saw the dark streams of her magic splayed around her. Her control was beginning to slip. She pulled her shame back into herself.</p><p>\u201cYou have my deepest respect and admiration for the depth of your sacrifice, my lady.\u201d Declan rose and bowed to her. \u201cI\u2019m merely pointing out the facts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you need to end him?\u201d Richard asked.</p><p>\u201cA confession,\u201d Declan said. \u201cPreferably in front of a dozen infallible witnesses.\u201d</p><p>It would never happen. Something inside her was dying bit by bit. Perhaps it was hope.</p><p>\u201cThen we\u2019ll have to obtain it for you.\u201d Richard rose. Declan did, too. She regained her feet.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome to stay at the house,\u201d Declan said.</p><p>Richard glanced at her. Charlotte shook her head gently. They needed to be alone with their grief and deal with it as a family. Richard and she were not a part of it, and she wanted to be left to her own despair.</p><p>\u201cThank you. It\u2019s most gracious of you, but I believe it would be best if we moved on,\u201d Richard said. \u201cThe less we\u2019re seen together, the better.\u201d</p><p>Declan escorted them out of his office.</p><p>Outside, dense clouds the color of lead had overtaken the sky. A gust of wind pulled at her hair\u2014a storm was coming. Charlotte realized for the first time that she was still wearing the same clothes she\u2019d worn on the island. A blood splatter stained her pants, a castoff from Richard\u2019s sword. She could smell the stench of smoke on her tunic. She looked like a wreck. It was a wonder they had let her into their home at all.</p><p>On the stairs, the girl stared at Richard with a wordless desperation.</p><p>He hugged her and kissed her hair gently. \u201cI will be at the Lair.\u201d He handed her a folded piece of paper. \u201cGive this to George. Don\u2019t leave the manor. I may have need of you.\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>Richard started down the stairs toward the phaeton, and Charlotte followed. What else could she do?</p><p>The doors swung open, and Rose rushed outside. \u201cWait!\u201d</p><p>Charlotte paused.</p><p>\u201cHow was she before she died?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour grandmother was well,\u201d Charlotte said. \u201cShe spoke of you and the boys often. She kept all of your presents. The glasses you\u2019d sent her were the envy of the whole town. Mary Tomkins almost took sick from sheer jealousy.\u201d</p><p>A haunted look passed over Rose.</p><p>\u201cShe was healthy,\u201d Charlotte continued. \u201cI made sure to keep up with her aches. She was respected. Her biggest worry was trying to keep a cuckoo clock in her hair. She knew you and the boys loved her, Lady Camarine. She stayed in the Edge of her own choosing, and a pair of wild horses couldn\u2019t have pulled her out. Your grandmother never saw herself as a victim. It is perhaps presumptuous of me, but I would suggest that you shouldn\u2019t see her that way either. If anything, the blame belongs to the people who killed her\u2014and me, because when she needed help, I wasn\u2019t fast enough.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte turned and walked toward the phaeton. She felt spent and empty, scraped completely dry. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLady de Ney,\u201d Rose called out.</p><p>Charlotte turned again.</p><p>Rose bowed. It was a deep, formal, Weird bow. \u201cI don\u2019t blame you. I blame them. Thank you for taking care of my grandmother.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d Charlotte told her. She just wanted to get away.</p><p>Richard swung the door of the phaeton open for her, and she climbed in.</p><p>\u201cThe ride won\u2019t be long,\u201d he promised, and shut the door. She heard him get in the front, in the driver\u2019s seat, where an instrument panel waited. The horseless phaeton took off down the road.</p><p>Two years, she reminded herself. That\u2019s how long it took Richard to get to this point. She had only been at this for less than a week. It had been the most difficult week of her life, but it was only a week. Even if it felt like a lifetime.</p><p>Rain drenched the phaeton. She looked outside the glass window and saw a gray haze of water. The raindrops bombarded the roof, sliding along the smooth resin walls of the phaeton, as if she were under a waterfall and yet remained completely dry. Charlotte covered her face and cried. It was a wordless, silent sobbing born of pure pressure that squeezed the tears out of her eyes, more a stress relief than true mourning.</p> <p>The phaeton came to a halt. The door swung open again, and she jumped out into the deluge, grateful that it would wash the signs of her weakness from her face.</p><p>Tall trees surrounded a narrow driveway. In front of her, a house crouched in the rain, like a shaggy bear. She could barely make out the dark log walls under the roof green with moss. Lightning flashed above. A moment later, thunder tore through the hum of the rain. Richard grabbed her hand, and they dashed across the driveway to the house. Charlotte ran up the stairs onto the narrow porch, Richard swung the door open, and she ducked inside gratefully.</p><p>TEN</p><p>\u201cLIGHTS,\u201d Richard said.</p><p>Pale yellow lanterns ignited on the walls, bathing the cabin in their soothing light. Delicate frosted spheres, they dangled from the wood like bunches of glowing grapes. The layout of the cabin was open and simple: in the center, two large couches faced each other, flanked by an overstuffed chair, all in handsome, masculine brown. A classic Adrianglian fire pit sat between the couches, a rectangular construction of stone with a grate partially overshadowed by an exhaust hood venting outside the house.</p><p>To the left, wooden stairs led to a small loft supporting a bed. Under the stairs, a desk stood, filled with stacks of paper. A large map of Adrianglia decorated the wall, with hand-drawn arrows and annotations written in Richard\u2019s hand.</p> <p>At the right wall, a kitchen occupied the far corner, complete with the ornate box of an icer unit and a small stove.</p><p>Richard walked past her, struck a match, and dropped it into the pit. Immediately, the flames surged up. He must\u2019ve laid out the fire before he\u2019d left.</p><p>Long windows offered a view outside the house, all of the forest soaking in the gray deluge of cold rain. Every inch of the wall free of windows was filled with bookcases. Volumes of all shapes and sizes sat on the shelves, interrupted by odd objects. He liked books. So did she.</p><p>The space felt warm and inviting, the crackling of the logs a soothing counterpoint to the rain. For some odd reason, she had expected the house to be austere, almost grim, but it was comfortable and inviting. He was letting her into his personal space, into his home.</p><p>\u201cA towel?\u201d he asked, offering her a green towel.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d She took it and stood there, looking at the towel like an idiot.</p><p>\u201cWould you like to take a shower? The water is heated by the icer\u2019s coils, so it should be hot,\u201d he told her. \u201cIt\u2019s through that door on the right. There are clean clothes in the cabinet.\u201d</p><p>She could wash the Isle of Divine Na off her skin.</p> <p>The bathroom was equipped with a standard Adrianglian shower. When the first drops of water hit her, Charlotte exhaled.</p><p>Ten minutes later, she rummaged through the cabinet and found a tunic that was too long on her and a pair of soft woolen pants, which were tight on her hips. She twisted the towel into a turban on her head and slipped out of the bathroom. Richard waited until she was settled on the couch by the fire pit and entered the bathroom with his own towel.</p><p>She watched the flames and tried not to think. If she didn\u2019t feel so broken, she would\u2019ve walked along the shelves, caressing the spines with her fingers. She wanted to know what he liked, what books he had read, but defeat wrapped around her, like a thick, dull blanket, and she couldn\u2019t fight it off.</p><p>The heat of the fire warmed her skin, and she forced herself to enjoy the simple, meager pleasure of being clean, warm, and safe, at least for the moment. When she looked up, Richard had left the bathroom and was coming toward her. She pulled the towel off her hair and let it down.</p><p>He sat down across from her. For a few minutes, they sat silently, the fire crackling between them.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cWe lost,\u201d she said, hating the failure in her voice.</p><p>\u201cWe lost a battle. I intend to win the war.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cWe know who runs the slavers. We have the names of five people. We study them, then we go after them,\u201d he said.</p><p>Go after them? After the bluebloods with money, after the peers of the realm with power, after the cousin to the king . . . \u201cYou make it sound so simple.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCharlotte?\u201d he asked quietly. \u201cAre you giving up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I have to see this through to the end. I just . . . I feel spent. I thought it would be over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it isn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She faced him. \u201cThe truth is that I\u2019m weak, Richard. Despite all my determination, the moment I saw a way out, I leaped at it. When we found the ledgers, I felt this overwhelming relief. I felt hope. I haven\u2019t gone over the edge yet. I could stop and never use that side of my magic again. I glimpsed a new chance at life, but now it\u2019s gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a strength, not a weakness. Despite everything you\u2019ve seen and done, you retained your humanity. I admire that.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cThere is nothing worthy of admiration here. I\u2019m simply a very selfish woman. We\u2019ve been robbed of our victory, and even though I barely began the fight, I\u2019m already in despair at the first setback. How can you keep going? I thought you would be more dejected.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am. I\u2019m used to setbacks by now, but this one is crushing.\u201d His damp hair, almost black with moisture, fell over his face. The light of the fire played on his skin. \u201cI struggled with it, but I\u2019m also a very selfish man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d</p><p>He glanced at her. \u201cI realized that if this were over, you would leave.\u201d</p><p>The slavers, Brennan, and the insurmountable obstacles to bringing them to justice faded from her mind. He was right there. All she had to do was get up and take two steps forward or invite him in. He could be hers.</p><p>Charlotte raised her chin. \u201cI\u2019m here now. In your house.\u201d</p><p>Richard stopped moving. She had his complete attention.</p><p>She leaned forward and ran her hand through her long blond hair, letting it fall over her shoulders to frame her face. He focused on her completely. She read admiration, desire, and a touch of hard male possessiveness in his gaze. It made her giddy.</p><p>\u201cThe question is, are you going to do something about it, Richard?\u201d</p><p>Richard cleared the distance between them in one rapid step, then his arms were around her. She saw him leaning down and closed her eyes. The first touch of his lips made her shudder, not in fear or excitement, but in desperate, all-consuming want. His lips told her everything she needed to know without making a single sound: that he wanted her just as desperately, that he hoped, that he wouldn\u2019t force her. That he thought she was beautiful.</p><p>His tongue brushed her lips, and she tilted her head and opened her mouth, letting him know that she wanted him, too. He tasted her, kissing deeper, seducing with a promise of more but holding back. Her body tightened. Her breasts pressed against his chest. A deep-seated desire sparked inside her. Suddenly, she felt empty, and she wanted to be full of him. He sensed it, as if they were perfectly attuned, and pulled her tighter, possessive.</p><p>His hands stroked her back, under her tunic, and the roughness of the calluses on his fingers scraping lightly against her skin sent aftershocks through the sensitive muscles of her back. Wrapped in his heated strength, she let go of words and self-awareness, and just kissed him, delighting in the simple pleasure of having him. He tasted of sandalwood and smoke and the promise of bliss.</p><p>\u201cSo beautiful,\u201d he whispered in her ear, and kissed her lips, her cheeks, then her neck, coaxing her to melt. It was too slow. A sudden fear that he would change his mind gripped her.</p><p>\u201cBed,\u201d she whispered to him.</p><p>He picked her up like she weighed nothing and carried her up the stairs to the loft, depositing her on the covers.</p><p>The bed was huge.</p><p>The full reality of what she was about to do dropped onto Charlotte\u2019s shoulders, like a crippling burden.</p><p>She swallowed. The blood spatter on her clothes flashed before her. She wanted to forget it. The clothes she wore now were clean, but she still wanted them gone because she knew her skin was free of blood.</p><p>She started to pull the tunic off herself, then his hands touched the bare skin of her stomach and slid up, along her back, stroking places she never thought erotic but which now sent small pulses of desire through her. He kissed her neck, slipped her tunic off, and kissed her chest, moving down in a slow, confident seduction. Her husband used to do this.</p><p>She swallowed and pulled away.</p><p>Richard stopped.</p><p>Her confidence evaporated. She felt so vulnerable sitting there with her shirt off, painfully self-conscious.</p><p>Richard swallowed. She sensed he was about to step back and grasped his hand. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He stopped.</p><p>\u201cI want you,\u201d she told him. \u201cI . . .\u201d She tried to make sense of the tangled ball of feelings.</p><p>Richard crouched by the bed. \u201cA woman once told me to use words.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m barren,\u201d she said with brutal honestly. \u201cSex was about making children. I want to be loved.\u201d She sounded so needy and desperate. \u201cI\u2019m afraid.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOf me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf intimacy.\u201d She swallowed. \u201cI need it to be different than it was with him.\u201d</p><p>She killed it. She ruined it, she brought the shadow of her ex-husband into the bedroom, and now Richard would have the burden of being different from him without knowing what it was like. It was unfair and selfish. He would walk away from her.</p> <p>\u201cDo you want me?\u201d Richard asked.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He had no idea how much.</p><p>Richard pulled off his tunic. Underneath, his body rippled with strong, carved muscle, his bronzed skin lightened with old scars. She watched mute as he took off his shoes. His pants followed. He was aroused.</p><p>Oh gods, he was so aroused.</p><p>Richard sat on the bed, leaned against the carved wooden headboard, and rested his muscular arms on its top edge. His spare, hard body looked almost decadent against the sheets.</p> <p>\u201cCome,\u201d he invited.</p><p>She stared at him, her eyes wide.</p><p>\u201cYou want it different. Come, make it different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou.\u201d</p><p>He was giving her control. She wasn\u2019t sure what to do with it.</p> <p>She would do something.</p><p>Charlotte stripped, shook her head, letting her blond hair fall over her in a cloud, and sat on the bed.</p><p>He was looking at her with such unrestrained, almost feral need, that she blushed. All of his brakes were gone. This was Richard without manners, without proper etiquette, without restraint. She thought he was ice. She had no idea he was fire.</p><p>The awkwardness fled, leaving sheer excitement.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I do?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cAnything you wish.\u201d</p><p>Anything she wished. She raised her hand and touched his chest, drawing her fingers along the narrow hollow between the hard panes of his pectoral muscles. He strained, his body tightening under her touch, but kept his hands on the headboard. She felt so free and . . . wanton. Yes. That was the word.</p><p>Charlotte slid her fingers lower, caressing the hard bulges of his abdominal muscles, sliding her hand lower, past his navel, tracing the long line of dark hair pointing down.</p> <p>\u201cRichard?\u201d</p><p>His voice was strained. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow good is your control?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow good do you need it to be?\u201d His voice sounded strained. His biceps bulged as he gripped the headboard.</p><p>\u201cCan you keep your hands on that headboard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you want me to, yes.\u201d</p><p>She touched the smooth head of his shaft, and he flexed in response, raising himself slightly off the covers.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s find out,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>She stroked the hard length of him and lowered her head to kiss his neck. The rasp of his stubble scratched her tongue. She tasted a hint of sweat and soap. He groaned. She smiled and kissed him again, his lips, his chest, running her tongue over his nipples, over his hard stomach. An insistent liquid heat spread between her legs. She really could do anything. He would let her. She had complete control. Her excitement spiked.</p><p>She trailed a line down from his navel with the tip of her tongue, feeling the muscles tense, like hardened steel under the skin.</p><p>She slipped his shaft into her mouth.</p><p>His back arched, as he flexed his arms, lifting himself and her. The headboard creaked.</p><p>She licked him, testing his discipline. His body shuddered. He groaned again. \u201cYou may not want to . . . do . . . that. It\u2019s been a while for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor me, too.\u201d She straddled him, her breasts inches from his lips. She felt him press between her legs. He was looking at her, his gaze like a heated caress. Everything about him was so unbelievably erotic, from his strong muscular body, to the way his skin, warmed by the fire, burned under her touch, to the way he looked at her.</p><p>She tilted her hips. The hot hard length of him slid inside her in a rush of pleasure, stretching her from the inside. Charlotte gasped, arching her back, feeling the full extent of him inside her. She felt tight, but flexible, pliant, warm, and so impatient for more.</p><p>\u201cGods, I want you,\u201d he growled.</p><p>She began to rock forward, sliding over him. It felt like heaven, but she wanted more.</p><p>\u201cTouch me now,\u201d she whispered. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>He pushed off the bed, grasping her hips, grinding up, deeper into her. His mouth found her breast, then her nipple, still cool from the shower. His tongue slid over it, and she tightened in response, the rush of sensation so intense it almost hurt. He sucked on her, and she shivered atop him, bending back, riding him faster. Her joints turned liquid.</p><p>He slipped his hand down between her legs and touched the sensitive knot of nerves there. Bliss cascaded through her.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she moaned. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>He kept caressing her, his fingers skillful, adding just the right amount of pressure, matching her movement. The combined sensation overwhelmed her, lifting her higher and higher. Her head swam, but she felt every moment, every caress, as she was hovering on the precipice.</p><p>Her breath was coming in quick whimpers. His body was so hard under her, each muscle taut with strain. He let out a masculine half growl, born of pure lust. It triggered some deep feminine instinct inside her that told her his pleasure was as intense as hers.</p><p>And then the waves of euphoria crested inside her, met, and she fell over the cliff. All the strength went out of her spine. She slumped forward, her eyes wide, lost in erotic bliss.</p><p>He flipped her back onto the covers. She kissed him, running her hands down his back. He pinned her down, pretending to keep her from moving, and looked at her, her mouth, her breasts, the swell of her hips. There was something so deeply gratifying in the look of male satisfaction on his face. She realized that he must\u2019ve wanted her for a long time, and now he had finally gotten her.</p><p>\u201cI want you,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cAre you mine, Charlotte?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should\u2019ve said no. Now you\u2019re mine, and I won\u2019t let you go.\u201d</p><p>He thrust into her, building to a smooth, rapid rhythm. She melted, matching his thrusts, once again desperate for that peak of pleasure. She didn\u2019t close her eyes. She watched his face, drinking in every moment of his pleasure. He kept thrusting, his whole body taut with tension, the muscles of his back strong like hard cables under her fingers. He reveled in her. Moments later, she climaxed again, the aftershocks of an orgasm rocking her. His body went hard, a tremor gripped him, and he emptied himself into her with a satisfied male groan.</p><p>She held on to him, not wanting to let go. He turned, shifting his weight onto the bed, and they lay wrapped in each other. She felt so happy, so heartbreakingly happy.</p><p>\u201cCan it be like this again?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cIt can be however you want it to be,\u201d he told her, and kissed her lips.</p><p>She closed her eyes and smiled.</p><p>\u201cYOU never told me why you do this. Why you went after the slavers.\u201d</p><p>Richard turned his head and looked at her. Charlotte lay on her stomach on the covers, still naked and completely his. That glorious hair spilled over her back like a silken waterfall. Her face, neck, and arms had a tan, but her breasts and the swell of her butt were pale, and the intimate bare stretch of that pale skin seemed intensely sexual. She lay next to him, content, perhaps even happy, completely at ease, looking at him with her silver eyes. Like sunlight shining through the rain, he thought.</p><p>Mmm. Mine. My Charlotte.</p><p>He\u2019d made her happy, he\u2019d made her moan and ask for more of him. If it was at all in his power, he would make it so it would always be like this.</p><p>It could always be like this, a quiet voice whispered inside him. He could take her with him and disappear. Just walk away. Nobody would blame him. Nobody but the ghosts in his memories.</p><p>Richard reached over and stroked her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cDo you remember the girl at the Camarine Mansion? The one who met us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou look alike. Is she your daughter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s my niece. Her name is Sophie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Sophie? The one you were saving when you were delirious?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cMy grandparents had several children. My father was the oldest son, and Gustave, my uncle, was the second oldest. Our family was involved in a feud. In the Mire, everyone feuds with somebody. Our feud was old, with deep roots.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that why your father was shot in the market?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I was too young to take care of the family, still a child by the Mire\u2019s standards, and Gustave was a much better fit. He became the head of our clan. He had two daughters, Cerise, who is now married to Earl Camarine\u2019s best friend, and Sophie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re her cousin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTechnically. Our relationship was always more that of an uncle and niece. I\u2019m old enough to be her father. Gustave was often busy. One day, he had gone out and taken his wife and Cerise with him. Sophie came to see me. She wanted to take a boat down the river to Sicktree, the nearest town. Her mother\u2019s birthday was coming up, and she wanted to sell some wine and buy her a gift.\u201d</p><p>Telling the story was like cutting open the old wound deep inside him. He was surprised it still hurt that much, after so many years. \u201cCeleste, my second cousin, was going with her. I didn\u2019t see the harm in it. Celeste was a capable young woman and a good shot. In the Mire, everybody knows everybody, and our family had a dangerous reputation. Nobody except for the feuding family would dare to bother them, and our feud had cooled to a smolder. I told them to go ahead.</p><p>\u201cAbout twenty minutes out, a group of slavers found them. They put a bullet into Celeste\u2019s head. She pitched into the water, and Sophie went in after her. When Sophie broke the surface, the slavers hit her over the head with an oar and hauled her into their boat.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte moved closer to him, wrapping her fingers around his.</p><p>\u201cSlavers were unheard of in the Mire. The border with Louisiana is the only place they could enter, and it\u2019s guarded too tightly. Someone on the Dukedom\u2019s side had to have let the slavers in for that raid. We never found out who or why. The girls didn\u2019t come home, and that evening, we went out on the river and found Celeste\u2019s body. We began combing the swamp, but we had no idea who had taken Sophie or why.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhere did they take her?\u201d Charlotte asked.</p><p>\u201cTo a hole in the woods. They wanted children, specifically. They put her into a hole in the ground. Sophie said on the second day a man climbed down to visit her. He groped her and tried to rip off her clothes.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte\u2019s eyes shone with outrage.</p> <p>\u201cSophie can flash. She\u2019s properly trained like most of us. Her training wasn\u2019t complete then, but she defended herself. She flashed through the man\u2019s eyes and killed him. In punishment, they stopped feeding her or giving her water. It took us eight days to find her. I remember that camp like I saw it yesterday. Half-flooded holes, starving children, some dead, some dying. We slaughtered the slavers. I got into the hole to pull Sophie out. I stood on the slaver\u2019s corpse to lift her. Some of him was missing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDawn Mother, did she eat him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I never asked. She didn\u2019t know when we would be coming for her, and she did what she had to to survive. But she was never the same. First, she stopped brushing her hair. Then she stopped wearing nice clothes. She decided that she didn\u2019t like her name and she wanted to be called Lark. She spent most of her time in the woods and stopped talking. She would hunt small game or just find carrion and hang it on a tree in the forest because she was convinced that she was a monster, and we would run her off into the woods to fend for herself.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte sat up. \u201cDid you get her help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are no healing colleges in the Mire,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery time I tried to speak to her, she would run away as if I were one of them. One of my cousins is a physician. Not like you, but she is talented in her own way. She examined Sophie several times. There was nothing physically wrong with her. But Sophie was always close to her mother, and as long as some connection between her and her family remained, I thought that, given time, she would slowly heal. But the Hand came calling.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe Louisiana spies?\u201d Charlotte\u2019s eyes widened.</p><p>\u201cThey wanted something our family had. Do you recall the exile I mentioned? Vernard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis last name was Dubois. Does it mean anything to you?\u201d</p><p>Charlotte frowned. \u201cVernard Dubois was a celebrated medical scientist in the Dukedom of Louisiana a few decades before my time. I\u2019ve read some of his work\u2014he con-centrated on applied medical botany. Contrary to what some people think, the College healers don\u2019t just limit their medical education to the use of magic. We study pharmacology, herbology, and other disciplines just like any other medical . . . I\u2019m rambling. Was he the same man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. He\u2019s Sophie\u2019s grandfather.\u201d</p> <p>Charlotte blinked.</p><p>\u201cLouisiana exiled him into the Mire because he had crossed the line into the forbidden territory of magic alteration.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s rich.\u201d Charlotte snorted. \u201cThey turn their spies into magic monstrosities. You wouldn\u2019t believe some of the things they do to the human body.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would,\u201d he told her. \u201cI\u2019ve killed many of them.\u201d</p><p>She leaned over and brushed a kiss on his lips. \u201cWhat does Dubois have to do with all of this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe built a device. He meant it to be a healing apparatus, but instead it turned the human body into an indestructible monster. The Hand wanted it. Louisiana sent a unit of their magically altered spies into the Mire led by a man who calls himself Spider. They kidnapped Sophie\u2019s parents. It cost us two-thirds of our family, but we wiped them out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSophie\u2019s parents?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpider fused her mother.\u201d</p> <p>Shock slapped Charlotte\u2019s face. That\u2019s how Richard had reacted when he first found out. The process of fusion melded human tissue to that of plant, creating a symbiotic entity with all of the memories of the human being but none of the will. Irreversible and agonizing, it had robbed both Cerise and Sophie of their mother.</p><p>\u201cGustave survived,\u201d he said. \u201cSo Sophie has one parent. When the Mirror relocated our family to Adrianglia, I hoped she would leave Lark behind. She traded rags for dresses, and now she takes etiquette lessons. The rest of the time she trains.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith her sword?\u201d Charlotte guessed. She was beginning to get an idea of how their family worked.</p><p>Richard nodded. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen her level of dedication. She practices constantly. Three years ago, she had no interest in it. If you asked me back then, I would\u2019ve told you she would be a mediocre fighter at best. Today, I\u2019m running out of things I can teach her. She developed the killer instinct, she\u2019s ruthless, and I worry about her lack of restraint. Something drives her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think she wants to go after slavers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I told you about my brother. I have, had, another, our half brother Erian. He was just a child when my father died. He was standing right next to him. It irreparably damaged him. He hid it for years, but eventually his hatred consumed him. I don\u2019t want that for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think that by killing the slavers you can heal her?\u201d Charlotte asked.</p><p>\u201cNo. But I can spare her the need to take revenge herself. She\u2019s a good fighter, but she\u2019s still a child. If she goes after the slavers, she will die. Even if she doesn\u2019t, seeking vengeance will damage her more. Slavery is an aberration. It shouldn\u2019t exist in our time, yet it does, and I decided I won\u2019t permit it. I can\u2019t stop it on the entire continent, but I will stop it here in Adrianglia. Sophie will never have to see what I saw. I won\u2019t let their atrocities scar her any further.\u201d His voice degenerated into a snarl. He caught himself. \u201cI let her go on that boat. I was the one who said, \u2018I don\u2019t see any harm in it. Go ahead.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou couldn\u2019t have known.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t change the fact that it happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRichard, it\u2019s not your fault. It\u2019s not her fault either. I can take her to Lady Augustine. She is my surrogate mother at Ganer College. She\u2019s a mind soother, and she\u2019s as good at healing the soul as I am at healing the body. If anyone can assist Sophie, she can, and she will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not certain she wants help.\u201d It wasn\u2019t their way. One didn\u2019t rely on strangers.</p><p>Charlotte raised her arms. \u201cOf course she doesn\u2019t want help. None of us want help when we\u2019re fifteen and the world has victimized us. That\u2019s why we have adults in our lives who make that decision for us. She may not want it, but she needs it. Promise me that once we\u2019re done, one way or the other, you will take her to the College. If neither of us survives, her sister or Rose should make sure she visits there. I will write a letter. If you take it with you, Lady Augustine will see you. Promise me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promise,\u201d Richard said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll hold you to it.\u201d</p><p>A sad whine echoed through the house.</p><p>Charlotte blinked. \u201cIs that the dog?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t be. We left him with the boys.\u201d Richard slid off the bed. \u201cI\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p><p>He went down the ladder and opened the door. A black shape shot by him, smelling of wet fur and dripping rainwater.</p><p>\u201cI thought I was rid of you,\u201d he growled.</p><p>The dog shook, causing the fire pit to hiss.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s decided he\u2019s ours,\u201d Charlotte called from the loft.</p><p>Richard took the towel she had left on the couch and spread it down for the dog. The big mutt flopped on it.</p><p>Richard climbed back up the stairs, stretched out on the bed, and pulled her closer. \u201cYour turn.\u201d</p><p>She raised her eyebrows.</p><p>\u201cTell me why you wanted to kill your ex-husband.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte turned on her back, looked at the ceiling, and sighed. \u201cTurnabout is fair play?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was taken to the College when I was seven. It\u2019s the only life I knew until I was twenty-seven years old. I\u2019ve read books about adventures and love. I flirted. I even made out with boys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShocking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, it was. In the last years of my being there, I couldn\u2019t wait to escape. I was going to travel. I would have all the adventures I could possibly want.\u201d She sighed again. \u201cAt twenty-seven, I received my land grant, my house, and my noble title for my decade of service. I moved in, and soon I realized that I had no idea how big the world really was. I was going to travel, I really was, but the house needed work and the garden needed to be tended, and there were good books . . .\u201d</p><p>She made big eyes at him.</p><p>\u201cYou were scared,\u201d he guessed.</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI had all the training and confidence I would ever need, but I just couldn\u2019t bring myself to do anything with it. And then Elvei Leremine walked into my life. He was a blueblood, flawless, handsome . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate him already,\u201d he said.</p><p>Charlotte smiled, a sad parting of lips without humor. \u201cI was besotted with the idea of falling in love and having a family. Here was my prince, so considerate, so together. The whole thing seemed like a perfect shortcut to happiness. Instead of combing through men and dealing with rejection, I found the ideal husband right away, and I married him because I was so utterly stupid. He stood in line to inherit his family\u2019s lands, but until then we decided it would be best if he came to live with me. He started speaking of children right away. We tried for six months, and he grew more and more alarmed when I didn\u2019t conceive. Then, finally, I went to be diagnosed. For another year and a half I denied the inevitable. I went to the best healers I knew. I underwent procedure after procedure\u2014the memories still give me nightmares. I refused to give up. I was always taught that if you strive hard enough, you will achieve what you desire. I\u2019d read all those romantic books, where a woman can\u2019t conceive, then she meets the right man, and the power of love or his magic virility or what have you overcomes her problems, and she has gorgeous triplets. My magic cure was just around the corner, I was sure of it.\u201d</p><p>She turned to look at him. \u201cI\u2019m barren, Richard. Irreversibly. I will never have a child. There is no cure.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said.</p><p>She hesitated. \u201cDoes it matter to you? I can never give you a child.\u201d</p><p>She was thinking of staying with him. Don\u2019t read too much into it, he warned himself. They came from completely different worlds. She was a blueblood, and he was a fraud, with hardly anything to his name.</p> <p>\u201cThere are sixteen adults in my family, all that remains of over fifty, and almost twenty children, most of them with one dead parent or both,\u201d he told her. \u201cI have many children to take care of. My worth isn\u2019t tied to having one specifically my own.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte sighed and caressed his cheek. Her finger traced his lips. \u201cFunny, had you asked me that before I\u2019d married Elvei, I would\u2019ve told you the same thing. But somehow the quest to have a child became the most important thing in my life. I felt deficient. Almost as if I were somehow not female if I couldn\u2019t conceive. Somewhere in the middle of all of this, I realized that Elvei required a child so he could inherit the family estate. He was in competition with his younger brother, and he was trying to race to the finish line and produce a bouncing baby to claim his land, house, and leadership of the family with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe sounds like an idiot.\u201d Who the hell would care about the lands and house when he had her?</p><p>Charlotte gave a one-shouldered shrug. \u201cI was very naive. And my blinders were firmly in place. Elvei was always attentive. He came with me on some of my procedures. This journey toward getting a child was something we took together. It was a quest we had in common, and I thought it would bring us closer. Really, we were both at fault. He should\u2019ve made his position clear before the wedding, and I shouldn\u2019t have mistaken his courtesy and attention for love. I think it took a toll on him as well. He\u2019d grown obsessive. We had to have sex in a specific position because someone had told him it was most likely to result in conception. He\u2019d help me chart my ovulation. It was a kind of insanity that took over both of us. Looking back at it, all of that seems . . . creepy.\u201d</p><p>Richard stared at her, speechless. Her husband was an ass. He wanted to find him and skin him alive. Saying it out loud, however, probably wasn\u2019t the best strategy.</p> <p>\u201cIn the end, when all options were exhausted, I came to him with the news. I had expected him to hug me and tell me it would all be fine and that he loved me anyway. He presented me with an annulment.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte laughed bitterly. \u201cMy world had collapsed. I wanted to hurt him, and I almost did. I came this close.\u201d She held her index finger and thumb a hair apart.</p><p>\u201cWhat stopped you?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cIt was wrong,\u201d she said simply. \u201cI was a healer. I was meant to heal people, not to hurt them because they crushed my heart.\u201d</p><p>And that\u2019s why she would always be the ray of light in his darkness. He had to hold on to her. He couldn\u2019t let her go. He had to not screw this up.</p><p>Charlotte closed her eyes. \u201cWe, the healers, have two sides to our power: one prolongs life, the other cuts it short. We\u2019re conditioned to use only one. It\u2019s repeated so often, you have it chiseled in your mind by the time you reach your teens: do no harm. Healing is hard work. You feel the magic leaving you. But doing harm is easy. You feel powerful and strong. It\u2019s almost euphoric. You don\u2019t realize how much magic you\u2019ve spent until it\u2019s gone, and you collapse dramatically and make a complete fool of yourself.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou may swoon as you wish. I\u2019ll always be there to catch you.\u201d</p><p>She laughed.</p><p>He grinned.</p><p>Charlotte turned on her side and looked at him. \u201cTwo things can happen when a healer stops being a healer. One, they drain themselves of all of their magic and die. And two . . .\u201d</p><p>She hesitated.</p><p>\u201cTwo?\u201d Richard prompted.</p><p>\u201cThey become a walking plague. They spend their magic, realize they require more, and began to feed on those around them, converting other lives into fuel for further killing. They cease to become human. The first time I killed, when I infected Voshak and his slavers, I wasn\u2019t sure I had enough power to kill them all. So I fed on them. You have no idea how wonderful it felt.\u201d</p><p>Her voice shook.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re terrified of it,\u201d he guessed. Alarm wailed in the back of his head. He was certain he read an article describing something very similar a few years back. The book claimed it was a death sentence to the magic user.</p><p>\u201cYes. Since then I haven\u2019t done it. Once you start, the temptation to keep going is too strong. In the bookkeeper\u2019s mansion, when I was near my limit, I felt you. I could sense your life force. It made me hungry.\u201d She touched his face. \u201cAre you scared?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He wasn\u2019t afraid of her; he was afraid for her.</p><p>She cleared her throat. Her voice was quiet. \u201cSome people think they are better than others at what they do. I don\u2019t think, I know. I\u2019m the most powerful healer of my generation. I wouldn\u2019t become a plaguebringer, I would unleash a pandemic on this world. I\u2019d become a living death. I would rather spend all of my magic and die than kill thousands of people.\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have ever done it. You have to understand, back at the clearing I saw you in the cage, battered and bruised, and they were lounging about as if they were on some picnic. It made me so angry. Draining them seemed like the only way, and I did it. I knew the risks, I just didn\u2019t realize how strong the pull of the magic is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were in shock,\u201d he told her. \u201cTrust me, I was there. I saw your face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not an excuse. A lot of healers disappear after a few years. I always thought it was because they burn out. Maybe they don\u2019t. Maybe they succumb instead and have to be put down like rabid dogs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t do this to yourself. You won\u2019t be put down. I won\u2019t let anyone touch you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRichard, if I ever lose myself, you have to stop me.\u201d Her lips touched his, warm and pliant, and he savored her taste. \u201cI know it\u2019s a lot to ask, but promise me.\u201d</p><p>Something inside him went dead and cold at the thought. \u201cI\u2019ll take care of it.\u201d</p><p>He would do it because she asked him. At the very least, he would try. He wrapped his arms around her and pulled her to him, wishing he could protect her from everything, wishing he could keep her safe. Men, creatures, beasts, he could end them. But how could one fight magic? He couldn\u2019t cut it, he couldn\u2019t kill it, and if it took Charlotte from him, there was nothing he could do about it.</p><p>She hugged him, sliding next to him. \u201cSome twisted romance we have going here.\u201d</p><p>He forced a smile. \u201cI don\u2019t know. It could be worse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re still fighting our war. We could simply give up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t give up,\u201d she said. \u201cIf we did that, everything we have done until now would be for nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes it pull on you? Your magic?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s almost as if it has a life of its own. I picture it as a dark beast or a nest of snakes. Sometimes it sleeps, like now, perfectly content. And then I use it, and the beast awakens and scratches from the inside, trying to claw its way out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish you had told me sooner.\u201d He squeezed her closer and kissed her lips. She tasted so sweet. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have asked you to kill the crew. I shouldn\u2019t have let you get off that ship, period.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t get to tell me what I should or shouldn\u2019t do.\u201d She smiled.</p><p>\u201cYes, I do. You promised to obey me.\u201d</p><p>She rolled over and climbed on him, her face full of mischief. \u201cAnd if I disobey you, mighty Sir Richard, what shall you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no idea. I suppose I\u2019ll growl in a ferocious, manly way.\u201d He put his arms behind his head. Her hair spilled over her left breast. Her right was bare, a perfect, glorious breast tipped by a small dark nipple, almost pink against her soft, pale skin.</p><p>She was so beautiful. He was amazed she let him touch her. That he had her here with him was some sort of miracle of the universe.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re ogling my breasts.\u201d</p><p>He raised his eyebrows. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>She leaned over him, her locks falling around them like a shimmering curtain. Her nipples brushed his chest, cool peaks against the heat of his body. He smelled the delicate scent of citrus from her damp locks.</p><p>\u201cAre you afraid loving me will make you weaker, Richard?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She had no idea how much he wanted her. If someone right now offered him a guarantee that she would stay with him in exchange for walking away from his mission, he wasn\u2019t sure what his answer would be. You\u2019ve fallen too hard and too fast, fool.</p><p>No, loving her didn\u2019t make him weaker. It made him desperate.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re mine,\u201d he said, and wrapped his arms around her. \u201cI have no intentions of letting you go.\u201d</p><p>She smiled, a wicked sexy smile.</p><p>\u201cI mean it,\u201d he told her. \u201cYou can\u2019t escape.\u201d</p><p>The logical side of him warned that a hope of a future together would only hinder them. It would make them hesitate. It would cause them to avoid danger and abandon caution for each other\u2019s sake. They were able to do what they had to do precisely because each of them had nothing to lose. But that wasn\u2019t true anymore. He shut down the logic. It didn\u2019t help.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I don\u2019t want to escape.\u201d She caught his bottom lip between his teeth, pulled gently, and let go. Her eyes were luminescent. \u201cMy deadly noble swordsman.\u201d</p><p>He was so hard, it was making him crazy.</p><p>\u201cI want to have you again,\u201d she whispered. \u201cCan I have you again?\u201d</p><p>He rolled her over on her back and pinned her down. She widened her eyes. \u201cOooh, I\u2019m trapped. What will happen to me?\u201d</p><p>He bent down, relishing the softness of her body under him. \u201cLet me show you . . .\u201d</p><p>ELEVEN</p><p>CHARLOTTE swept the cabin floor, chasing the dust and tiny particles of ash into a neat pile. It had been three days since they had arrived at the cabin. Richard called it his Lair, but even lairs could stand a sweeping. Three days of nothing but conversation, savory meals, and sex. Unrestrained, amazing sex. She smiled to herself. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A delicious aroma of frying meat floated up from the kitchen, accompanied by the sizzle of food in a hot pan. She wasn\u2019t sure what Richard was cooking for breakfast, but whatever it was, it smelled divine. He liked to cook, she\u2019d discovered.</p><p>A faint hissing announced a phaeton arriving. They had been waiting for it.</p><p>\u201cWe come in peace,\u201d a male voice announced from the outside. \u201cDon\u2019t shoot us.\u201d</p> <p>Richard leaned away from the stove. \u201cIt\u2019s my brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll let him in,\u201d she said.</p><p>Charlotte unlatched the door and swung it open. A man in his early thirties stood on the porch, carrying a very thick leather file. The resemblance was definitely there: similar hair, except Richard combed his and Kaldar left it in a disorganized mess; similar faces, both handsome with contoured jawlines and pronounced cheekbones; similar height. And yet they were different. Richard\u2019s features had nobility and pride, while Kaldar was handsome in a roguish way, with a wild glint to his eyes and a charming grin. She had a feeling he smiled frequently and lied easily, while each of Richard\u2019s rare smiles was a gift.</p><p>Kaldar blinked. \u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Charlotte,\u201d she told him.</p> <p>\u201cA pleasure. Say, Charlotte, have you seen Richard? A brooding fellow about as tall as me, but much uglier and incapable of humor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUglier?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, perhaps not uglier per se, but definitely more melancholy. His trouble is that he thinks too much. It keeps him from enjoying life. Have you seen him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s inside cooking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCooking? He hates to cook.\u201d</p><p>Kaldar stepped over the threshold and ducked left. A knife sprouted from the doorframe where his head had been a moment ago. Kaldar flicked his fingers at the blade. \u201cSee? Incapable of humor.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d Richard raised his eyebrows. \u201cI thought the look on your face was bloody hilarious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho are you, and what have you done with my brother?\u201d</p><p>A young man followed Kaldar through the door. An impeccably tailored jacket hugged his fit, slim frame, and he moved with the casual elegance so many bluebloods strived to achieve through dancing lessons. He walked with supple grace but a certain surety, not a dancer, but rather a swordsman. His blond hair, cut long, which usually indicated a mage, accentuated the precise cut of his features, still touched with boyish softness. He turned to her. Familiar blue eyes looked at her from a face that was already arresting and in a few years would be devastating.</p><p>\u201cGeorge?\u201d she gasped.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, my lady.\u201d He took the broom from her. \u201cI\u2019ll finish this.\u201d</p><p>She tried to reconcile the filthy urchin with the flawless blueblood prince and failed. The pieces simply didn\u2019t fit together.</p><p>\u201cTerrible, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Kaldar shook his head in mock resignation. \u201cLook at the caliber of the competition I have to deal with. You know, women under twenty-five don\u2019t even notice me anymore when I tow him around.\u201d</p><p>George rolled his eyes.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re married,\u201d Richard reminded him.</p><p>\u201cI was complaining in a purely hypothetical sense.\u201d Kaldar turned to Richard. \u201cWhat are you cooking? Did you make enough for everybody?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t be left unfed, don\u2019t worry.\u201d Richard jerked the pan up in a sharp motion. A pancake flew in the air and flipped back into the pan.</p><p>\u201cThe least you can do is feed me. I brought your information.\u201d Kaldar shook the file. \u201cMy wife stole it for you from our illustrious spy agency, and we spent the whole night copying it by hand, then taking it back to the Mirror . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe has an imager at his house,\u201d George said. \u201cIt took him less than half an hour to copy everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTraitor child.\u201d Kaldar dropped the file on the counter. \u201cA gift for you, my ever-so-serious elder sibling.\u201d He made an elaborate flourish with his hand, and a piece of paper popped into his fingers out of thin air. Richard put the wooden spoon down and opened the paper. His face showed nothing. He looked at it for a long moment and passed it to her.</p><p>It was Richard\u2019s image captured with an imager and printed on paper with the word HUNTER printed at the top. The shot had caught him in a moment of battle. He\u2019d just swung his sword, and the body in front of him was still falling. Blood spatter stained his skin. His hair flared, moving from the momentum of his turn. His face looked serene.</p><p>\u201cWhere did you get this?\u201d Richard asked.</p><p>\u201cWhile I was procuring your information, I happened to be by Rodera. She\u2019s a hell of a city, and I made an excursion into her gutters and ruffled through her skirts. The slavers are passing this around. You are busted. How many times have I told you to wear a mask? Why don\u2019t you ever listen to me?\u201d</p><p>Half an hour later, when they finished the omelet Richard made, Kaldar had made at least ten jokes, told them a funny story about his wife, and made fun of Louisiana\u2019s ambassador. She understood why Richard got a slightly tense look on his face when he mentioned his brother. They were polar opposites. Kaldar, being the life of the party, had no urge to explore the virtues of dignity and restraint, while Richard had no desire to entertain others with his wit or draw attention to himself.</p><p>\u201cI suppose we should start,\u201d Kaldar said.</p><p>George dragged a large freestanding corkboard into view.</p><p>Mirth drained from Kaldar\u2019s face. \u201cNow then.\u201d</p><p>He opened the leather file and began pinning images to the board, five in all. Charlotte felt a pang of regret. She still saw Tulip in her dreams, but now, when she awoke, Richard held her, and the feeling of lying next to him was indescribable. He never said it, but the way he looked at her, the way he listened, the way they gave pleasure to each other made her feel loved, and deep inside her, a pathetic little hope had reared its head. She hated herself for that hope. It chipped at her resolve and at his. This path demanded sacrifices. They both knew it. They had both agreed to accept it. But each moment she had him to herself felt like a gift. Now that hope was dying, and its death throes brought her at once relief and a sickening fear.</p><p>\u201cLord Casside.\u201d</p><p>Kaldar pointed to the first image. A dark-haired man with a strong profile stared back at them.</p><p>\u201cMinor nobility, of the lesser-known branch of the Dweller family. An only son and a self-made man. About five years ago, he quietly began to liquidate his assets and invest all of his money into Blackwolf Imports and Exports.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlackwolf?\u201d Richard grimaced.</p><p>\u201cNot really an imaginative guy.\u201d Kaldar tapped the picture. \u201cYou were right, by the way. Height, weight, skin and eye color. Everything is consistent. If it wasn\u2019t for the nose and the chin, he could be part of the family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat family?\u201d Charlotte asked.</p><p>\u201cOur family,\u201d Richard said. \u201cI\u2019ll explain in a minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we have Earl Maedoc.\u201d</p><p>Kaldar tapped the second picture. On it, an older man glowered, his features harsh, his stare direct. His gray hair was shorn close to his scalp, and his hooded eyes looked unfriendly.</p><p>\u201cVeteran of the Adrianglian Army, decorated, praised, respected. He oversees recruiting efforts. He also supplies new muscle to the slavers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeing in charge of the recruiting allows him to weed out those unsuitable to military service,\u201d George said. \u201cThose with a penchant for sadism, for example. He steers them toward the slavers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLady Ermine.\u201d</p><p>Kaldar touched the next image. A woman in her late twenties. Delicate bone structure, coils of caramel hair, narrow eyes but a rare, highly prized color: a translucent light green.</p><p>\u201cAnother investor. Lady Ermine also takes a special interest in female slaves. She selects several each season and trains them to increase their value.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know this?\u201d Richard asked.</p><p>\u201cThe Mirror has a list in her file, which she had forgotten in her room at one of the state functions. It details purchases of personal items, including slinky garments and various inappropriate but entertaining things for seven women with different garment sizes and detailed prescriptions for Midwife\u2019s Bane . . .\u201d</p><p>Those bastards.</p><p>\u201c. . . which is apparently . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cUsed as a means of birth control.\u201d Charlotte ground out, furious. \u201cIf the dose is large enough, it can cause damage to the lining of the uterus, rendering a woman infertile.\u201d They were robbing the slave women of their fertility to prevent inconvenient offspring. She was infertile, and she understood the full enormity of their loss. She would crush that Ermine woman like a maggot under her shoe.</p><p>\u201cWhat she said,\u201d Kaldar said. \u201cThe names on the list had the flair of the Broken. There was a Britney, which doesn\u2019t occur here that often, but there was also a Christina, which is a completely Broken name.\u201d</p><p>Good point.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d George asked.</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s derived from the word \u2018Christian,\u2019\u201d Charlotte said. \u201cIn the Broken, Jesus Christ was viewed as the son of God, and his followers are Christians. In the Weird, it was John the Nazarite, whose followers are called the Nazaratians. In the Weird, a Christina would be named Johanna.\u201d</p><p>Kaldar shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that at least some women on that list came from the Edge, if not from the Broken itself. There\u2019s no logical reason for Angelia to have made that list, and when a covert Mirror operative posing as a servant attempted to return it, Lady Ermine claimed she had never seen it before. The Mirror put it into her file as an oddity. Now that we know she\u2019s connected to the slave trade, it makes much more sense.\u201d</p><p>Richard was staring at an image of an urbane, groomed blond man with sharp features and an overly elaborate haircut. There was a focused, predatory edge to his glare. \u201cWhat about him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaron Oleg Rene.\u201d Kaldar crossed his arms. His face had gained an unexpected vicious edge. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t believe who he\u2019s related to. You see the family resemblance?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSpider.\u201d Richard spat the word like it was poison.</p><p>\u201cA distant cousin.

Because of this inconvenient connection, he\u2019s been blacklisted from military service, the Department of the Interior, and the Diplomatic Corps.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does he do?\u201d George asked.</p><p>\u201cArts, sports, and entertainment,\u201d Kaldar said. \u201cHe travels around the country working as a glorified event planner. Organizes festivals, tourneys, and so on. The Department of the Interior has no issue with it as long as somebody else provides his security. He\u2019s very good at it, apparently.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo he can move around the country pretty much at random,\u201d Richard said.</p> <p>Kaldar nodded. \u201cI\u2019m thinking they use him as a buyer / scout / trouble fixer.\u201d</p><p>He turned to the last photograph. On it a man in his middle forties looked at the world with hazel eyes. He was handsome, with a masculine beauty that was just a shade too rugged to be perfect, and that slight roughness only added to his appeal. His expression was dignified but free of pretense. An engaging smile played on his lips and in his eyes, proclaiming loudly that this man was worthy of loyalty because he was good and would do the right thing. Its power was so pronounced, Charlotte felt compelled to smile back.</p><p>\u201cViscount Robert Brennan,\u201d Kaldar said. \u201cThe main head of this twisted hydra.\u201d</p><p>He sat down. \u201cHow do you want to go about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need a confession,\u201d Richard said. \u201cOr at the very least, an admission of guilt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrennan is a tough nut to crack.\u201d Kaldar\u2019s face turned grim. \u201cIt\u2019s not just that he\u2019s a cousin of the king. He\u2019s also popular. Blueblood ladies think he\u2019s darling, and men think he\u2019s a man\u2019s man. He\u2019s athletic, charming, funny, and they all love him. You\u2019ll be fighting against the tide of public opinion.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen we\u2019ll need to turn it against him,\u201d Richard said.</p><p>\u201cHow the hell are you going to do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t we simply remove him from the equation?\u201d George asked.</p><p>\u201cBecause if we kill him, the organization wouldn\u2019t die,\u201d Richard told him. \u201cThink of a monarchy. One king dies, another takes his place, but the institution survives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRichard is right.\u201d Charlotte rose.</p><p>The two men and a boy immediately stood up.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you get up?\u201d she asked George.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a woman,\u201d George answered.</p> <p>\u201cYes, but what is the reason?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou rose because hundreds of years ago, when a woman entered a room full of men, she wasn\u2019t exactly safe. Especially if she was beautiful or had holdings. Our magic is just as deadly, but physically, an average male is stronger than an average woman, so when a woman entered the room, men who knew her stood up to indicate that they would shield her from danger. The three of you just declared yourself my protectors.\u201d</p><p>They looked at her.</p><p>\u201cA modern woman is hardly in danger of a direct assault,\u201d Charlotte said. \u201cSo why do men still get up?\u201d</p><p>George frowned.</p><p>Charlotte smiled at Kaldar. \u201cYou know, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe get up because women like it.\u201d Kaldar clapped George on the shoulder. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to look like an unmannered bumpkin in front of a girl. And if you get up and she notices you, she might sit by you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly. There is no law that says men should rise, but you still do because women enjoy this show of attention. It\u2019s so ingrained in your nature that when we first met, Richard refused to sit down until I did, even though he was half-dead at the time.\u201d</p><p>Richard cleared his throat. \u201cThat\u2019s a wild exaggeration. I was a quarter-dead, at most.\u201d</p><p>Kaldar swiveled toward him and peered at his brother\u2019s face. \u201cThat\u2019s two jokes in less than an hour. You feeling all right?\u201d he asked quietly. \u201cFeverish, eh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. Get out of my face.\u201d</p><p>Kaldar looked at her, then back at Richard, then at her again.</p><p>Charlotte sat down. The three men sat.</p><p>\u201cThe monarchy survives because the bluebloods like it,\u201d she said. \u201cMost Adrianglians like it. It\u2019s an idea that appeals to them on some level. The king has less power than the collective Assembly or the Council, for example, so he can be overthrown. But we like to pretend we\u2019re still a warrior nation under a single strong leader, and we idealize the throne and those who sit on it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr stand close,\u201d Richard added.</p><p>\u201cThe bluebloods don\u2019t fear laws,\u201d she continued. \u201cSome of us still think they don\u2019t apply to us. We fear only public judgment. The public has judged the royal family to be paragons of virtue. We can\u2019t fight that, or we\u2019d have to rub the blueblood noses in the fact that their long bloodlines don\u2019t bestow them with nobility of spirit the moment they pop out of their mothers.\u201d</p><p>Richard nodded. \u201cThe bookkeeper on the island is a prime example\u2014she was so committed to Brennan, her eyes practically glistened at the thought of him. In her mind, he could never do anything base.\u201d</p><p>Their minds ran on parallel tracks. \u201cWe can\u2019t fight the system,\u201d Charlotte agreed. \u201cBut we can tarnish one individual. To crush the slaver ring, we have to get Brennan to admit to an act so base, so at odds with the standard of blueblood behavior, that society will have no choice but to judge him as defective. He will be viewed as a freak, unworthy of his pedigree. Anything he engaged in would become unclean. The bluebloods will destroy him just to escape the taint.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like the way you think,\u201d Kaldar said.</p><p>Richard nodded. \u201cI agree. The public disdain and disgust must be so severe that it would cause a cry of outrage. The slave owners must recognize that being discovered would make them instant social pariahs. That\u2019s the only way the institution of slavery can be rooted out.\u201d</p><p>Richard rose and walked to the board. \u201cBrennan built this organization. He made it efficient, resilient, and profitable. We don\u2019t know why. He doesn\u2019t need the money, and if it ever became public, he\u2019d lose everything. Something must\u2019ve compelled him to create it. He cares a great deal about it. When we fought the Hand, we suffered setback after setback, but we didn\u2019t break until the end.\u201d</p><p>A muscle jerked in Kaldar\u2019s face. \u201cErian.\u201d</p><p>The half brother Richard had mentioned. \u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d Charlotte said.</p><p>\u201cOur youngest brother betrayed the family to the Hand,\u201d Kaldar said.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe disappeared,\u201d Richard said.</p><p>\u201cRichard let him go,\u201d Kaldar told her. \u201cHe saw Erian walking away, and he let him go. We\u2019ll all regret this one day, mark my words.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBack to Brennan. We make him think he\u2019s being betrayed,\u201d Richard said. \u201cMake him think there is a coup and one of the others is trying to take over. It will drive him over the edge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll need at least two people for that,\u201d Kaldar said. \u201cA single person stirring up trouble is too easy to trace. You need at least two people pretending to act independently. And you\u2019re right out, my dear brother, because your mug has by now reached Brennan\u2019s desk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can do it,\u201d Charlotte said. \u201cThey don\u2019t know me. I don\u2019t even have to pretend to be anyone but myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, that\u2019s one,\u201d Kaldar said. \u201cBut I can\u2019t help you and neither can Audrey. The Mirror would have our asses, and, besides, we\u2019re on call. The Grand Thane Callis is marrying Marchesa Imelle de Lon in a month. Why couldn\u2019t that old geezer find himself an Adrianglian woman to marry, I\u2019ll never know. There is a realm full of old ladies waiting for him, but no, that old goat had to go to Louisiana to get himself a wife.\u201d</p><p>The Grand Thane never concerned himself with playing by the rules. Roughly eighty years ago, when Rogan Brennan sat on the throne, his sister Solina Brennan married Jarl Ulrich Hakonssen of Vinland in the north. After Rogan, the crown passed to his son Olred, which made Jarl Ulrich Grand Thane, a title traditionally held by the king\u2019s oldest uncle. As Grand Thane, he had defended the realm, leading the Adrianglian Army and Fleet to victories in the Ten Year\u2019s War. Olred managed to get himself killed before he produced an heir. Because of Jarl Ulrich\u2019s foreign birth, Solina couldn\u2019t assume the throne, and their daughter Gallena became the monarch of Adrianglia. Now Gallena\u2019s son sat on the throne. The Grand Thane was father to the previous queen and grandfather to the current king and Brennan, but he had kept the title that made him famous. Charlotte had seen him twice from afar: he was a massive, battle-scarred bear of a man, famous for his magic, physical might in battle, and roaring voice. Lady Solina had died almost fifteen years ago, and now he finally chose to remarry. She imagined he didn\u2019t want to spend the twilight of his life alone.</p><p>\u201cAnyone who is anyone in both Louisiana and Adrianglia will be at that wedding,\u201d Kaldar continued. \u201cThe entire Mirror is on full alert.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be an excellent place to expose Brennan,\u201d Charlotte thought out loud.</p><p>\u201cIt is, but I can\u2019t be the one to do it. I tried to hint at it to Erwin, who is in charge of operations for my unit, and he shut me down, fast. You\u2019re still short a player,\u201d Kaldar said. \u201cYou need that overlap of influence. That\u2019s the way that con works. You must work completely independently from two different angles toward a common goal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps I\u2014\u201d George said.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d all three of them answered in unison.</p><p>\u201cYou have your future to think about,\u201d Charlotte told him. \u201cIf we fail, Brennan will make it his mission to ruin you in the most gruesome way possible.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNot only that,\u201d Richard added, \u201cbut you are well-known and well connected. If you fall, you will drag your sister, your brother-in-law, and your brother down with you. You can help, George. But you must do it covertly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re out of luck,\u201d Kaldar said.</p><p>\u201cNot if I become Casside,\u201d Richard said.</p> <p>What?</p><p>\u201cCome again?\u201d Kaldar asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve met him,\u201d Richard said. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t be difficult to impersonate. You said yourself, there is a strong resemblance between us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re good with prosthetics, I\u2019ll give you that.\u201d Kaldar crossed his arms. \u201cBut this isn\u2019t some meeting in the middle of the night in a dimly lit tavern. You don\u2019t look enough like him to pass, and if you glue shit to your face, it will be clearly visible in the bright lights of all those ballrooms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot if it\u2019s under my skin,\u201d Richard said.</p> <p>She realized what he was saying. \u201cFacial surgery?\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>Charlotte stared at the picture, comparing the two faces. Richard\u2019s chin was too sharp, his nose bridge too low, his features too defined, and the eyebrows too high . . . No, too much, too many differences. It would never work.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re insane. Who\u2019s going to do this?\u201d Kaldar demanded.</p><p>\u201cDekart,\u201d Richard said.</p><p>Kaldar frowned.</p> <p>\u201cWho is Dekart?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cHe is a defector from Louisiana,\u201d Kaldar answered. \u201cThey were going to exile him for some creative surgeries, and he turned tail and ran across the border into the waiting arms of the Department of the Interior. What makes you think he\u2019ll go for it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have access to the Camarine and Sandine combined finances,\u201d Richard said. \u201cDekart needs money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRidiculous,\u201d she told him. \u201cYou\u2019re going to trust your face to some defector?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCharlotte is right. The man is an artist with a scalpel, but you\u2019ll still die on the operating table,\u201d Kaldar said.</p><p>\u201cNot necessarily.\u201d Richard looked at her.</p><p>No. Not in a million years. \u201cForget it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCharlotte . . .\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI said forget it!\u201d She got up off her chair. \u201cI would have to continuously heal you while the surgeon cut at your face. Look at your chin and look at his. It means cutting the living bone, Richard, and reshaping it. I will have to regrow it beyond its natural shape. Do you have any idea how difficult that is? I\u2019ve assisted in reconstructive surgeries before. I know exactly what\u2019s involved. What you\u2019re proposing is suicide. There is no guarantee I can keep you alive. Best-case scenario, you would be disfigured. Worst case\u2014dead. It\u2019s too dangerous.\u201d</p><p>He simply looked at her.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too dangerous, Richard. I won\u2019t do it. One slip of the blade, one overlooked infection, and you\u2019ll be gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCharlotte,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to assist. I can hire a healer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst, then you will die for sure. Second, no healer is going to do this for you. It\u2019s suicide.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat other way is there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, but this isn\u2019t the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m willing to take the risk,\u201d Richard said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ask that you respect my commitment,\u201d he said.</p><p>The words lashed at her. She had said the same thing to him when he tried to dissuade her from going with him. They had agreed that they would keep their relationship from interfering with the mission. If they hadn\u2019t made love and he was simply a man she knew, she would caution against the operation, but she wouldn\u2019t become borderline hysterical trying to prevent it.</p><p>But they had made love. And she was in love with him, whether he felt the same about her or not.</p><p>The words tore out of her before Charlotte could catch them, but she had summoned her poise, and when they came out, she said them calmly, with a touch of distance. \u201cWhat if I lose you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t. You\u2019re the best healer of your generation.\u201d</p><p>RICHARD lay prone on the table under the harsh sterile light of the surgeon\u2019s lamp. From this position, he had an excellent view of Dekart, a short, lean man, dressed in surgeon\u2019s robes. His face had a look of complete concentration as he reviewed his instruments. On the table in front of him, an imager presented Casside\u2019s face, enlarged to twice its normal size. The imager captured one\u2019s likeness completely, and Dekart was very good.</p><p>Charlotte stood next to the surgeon. Her face was glacially cold, her iced-over beauty almost sharp enough to cut. He was on the receiving end of the coldest stare he had ever seen.</p><p>Dekart\u2019s daughter-assistant tightened the last leather belt, pulling Richard\u2019s left arm tight against the surface of the table. The buckle clicked, locking. He was strapped in.</p><p>\u201cSuicide,\u201d Charlotte said.</p><p>Richard smiled at her.</p><p>Ever since he pointed out that she was thinking with her emotions, Charlotte had shut them down. She had argued for three days with cold, flawless logic, trying to overwhelm him with facts. She explained the operation in detail as they sat by the fire. She found an anatomy volume on the shelf and detailed how easily a scalpel could cause damage. She threatened him with the lingering, chronic pain that came with reshaped bones and nerve damage. And when they made love, she took his breath away. She was trying to give him a reason to back off.</p><p>She had no idea she only made it worse. He wanted to keep her away from using the darker side of her magic at any cost. He had come up with a plan that would call for him to bear almost all of the danger. She wouldn\u2019t have any cause to kill anyone. It hinged on his having Casside\u2019s face, and so he had listened to everything she said and acknowledged the full validity of her arguments, but he refused to budge.</p><p>Dekart began drawing lines on Richard\u2019s face, holding the ink stick in gloved hands. \u201cHow proficient are you in healing, my lady?\u201d His voice was soft and quiet. A slight Louisiana accent tinted his words.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the Healer,\u201d she said in a brisk tone.</p><p>\u201cI understand you are a healer,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cNot \u2018a.\u2019 \u2018The,\u2019\u201d she said.</p><p>Dekart glanced at her. \u201cYou will forgive me if I don\u2019t believe you. The Healer worked miracles until she retired. Still, you must have some ability, since my patient places such confidence in you. Such procedures are . . . quite gruesome. I ask that you restrain yourself from healing until I ask, or you will prematurely heal the changes I will make.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte fixed Richard with a deadly gaze. \u201cIf you die, I\u2019m coming after you. Don\u2019t expect a peaceful afterlife.\u201d</p><p>It must be excruciating for her, he realized. If their roles were reversed, and she lay on the table, while he was forced to watch her face being cut open and mop up the blood, could he do it?</p><p>\u201cDekart, give us a minute.\u201d</p><p>The surgeon gave a one-shouldered shrug, and he and his assistant stepped out.</p><p>\u201cDid you have a moment of clarity?\u201d she asked. \u201cShould I undo the belts?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry for making you do this. It must be difficult for you.\u201d He couldn\u2019t let her realize why he was doing it. If he did die, she would never forgive herself.</p><p>Her narrow eyebrows rose. \u201cHave a care, my lord Mar. First you ignore my advice, now you insult me. I assure you that watching living flesh sliced by a surgeon is nothing new to me. Contrary to your expectations, you are not that special.\u201d</p><p>She was furious with him. \u201cIf I could trade places with you, I\u2019d . . .\u201d</p><p>Her eyes sparked with anger. He\u2019d clearly said the wrong thing.</p><p>She reached over and slapped him.</p><p>\u201cIf you could trade places with me, I\u2019d die on the operating table. You deposited the responsibility for your survival on my shoulders against my will. Don\u2019t offer me empty platitudes.\u201d She turned away from him and walked out of his field of vision. \u201cHe\u2019s ready.\u201d</p><p>The door swung open. A moment later, Dekart loomed over him. \u201cPlease don\u2019t damage the patient. If you feel the need to injure him, kindly do it on other parts of his body.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll heal it before you start,\u201d came the icy reply.</p><p>A cold needle punctured his arm.</p><p>\u201cI will count to ten,\u201d Dekart said. \u201cI want you to repeat the numbers after I say them. Ten.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTen.\u201d</p><p>The room grew fuzzy. \u201cNine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEight.\u201d Dekart\u2019s voice sounded as if coming over a great distance.</p><p>\u201cEight,\u201d Richard whispered.</p><p>\u201cSeven.\u201d</p><p>The light blinked out. Everything went dark.</p><p>\u201cLook at me.\u201d</p><p>A voice called him. Richard swam toward it through the endless colorless water. He wasn\u2019t sure whose voice it was, but it had awakened him, and now he moved. A small part of him wondered why he wasn\u2019t drowning and where the surface was, but those questions were too faint to need his attention.</p><p>Below him, darkness gaped. It was reaching for him, its long tendrils twisted, ready to coil and pull him under. He knew it wasn\u2019t death. Death was nowhere near. It was something else. As he swam, he felt its coldness, spreading through the waters underneath. It smelled like blood, he realized.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t afraid of it. Far from it, it felt familiar, as if it were a part of him.</p><p>\u201cRichard?\u201d</p><p>Charlotte . . . He spun around in the water looking for her. Where are you, love? The water stretched out on all sides of him, a transparent eternity.</p><p>\u201cCome back to me, Richard.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m trying. I\u2019m trying, my sweetheart. I\u2019m looking for you.</p><p>\u201cCome back to me.\u201d</p><p>He felt warmth on his skin and turned toward it. A luminescent golden glow suffused the crystalline depth. He swam into it.</p><p>The darkness chased him. The icy restraints of its tentacles wound about his legs. It pulled, but the light anchored him, refusing to let him go. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCome back to me, Richard.\u201d</p><p>I love you, he wanted to tell her. Don\u2019t let me go.</p><p>\u201cCome back.\u201d</p> <p>He pushed away. The darkness broke. The torn shreds of its tentacles burned into his skin, long black marks. He knew they would be there forever. He kicked his legs and swam into the light.</p><p>His eyes opened, and he saw Charlotte leaning over him, her eyes luminescent. She had saved him. He wanted to tell her, but pain claimed his mouth, pooling in his jawbone.</p><p>She took his hand and kissed his fingers. He realized that the restraints were gone.</p><p>Dekart leaned against the cart with instruments. He looked ill.</p><p>Richard fought through the pain. \u201cHow did it go?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy finest work,\u201d the surgeon said. He pushed from the cart and bowed to Charlotte. \u201cIt was an honor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor me as well,\u201d she told him.</p><p>Dekart turned on his foot and left the room.</p><p>Charlotte bent over him. He saw tears in her eyes and opened his mouth. She put her fingertips on his lips.</p><p>\u201cBe quiet,\u201d she whispered, and kissed him. He tasted tears and desperation on her lips. She held on to him for a long moment and let go, pulling on her composure like a mask. He almost wished she hadn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cWould you like a mirror?\u201d Charlotte asked.</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>She nodded at the hand he was gripping. \u201cYou have to let me go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>She smiled back at him and sat in a chair. Ten minutes later, he finally decided she wouldn\u2019t dissolve into nothing and released her hand. She brought a mirror. A strange man looked back at him. He could still see the old shadows of himself. His eyes were the same. Possibly his eyebrows, and even his forehead. The rest belonged to Casside.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not me,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what you wanted,\u201d Charlotte reminded him.</p><p>\u201cDoes it bother you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour new face?\u201d</p> <p>He nodded.</p><p>She sighed. \u201cIt bothers me that you risked your life for it. But I don\u2019t care whose face you\u2019re wearing, Richard.\u201d</p><p>He realized he loved her, painfully, intensely, with the desperation of a dying man eager for every last moment of life.</p><p>TWELVE</p><p>WARM lips touched her mouth.</p><p>Charlotte opened her eyes. She had fallen asleep on the couch next to the fire pit. The marathon healing session had taken its toll. Fatigue blanketed her body. She had the absurd notion that it covered her like a blanket, draining her life force with each breath she took.</p><p>Richard was looking at her. She reached over and touched his new face, probing for any sign of infection. He was clean.</p><p>\u201cDoes it hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Dekart was truly an artist with the knife. What they had accomplished together was nothing short of a miracle. Richard\u2019s face matched Casside\u2019s with uncanny precision, but where the other noble\u2019s eyes were guarded, Richard\u2019s intelligence shone through, giving the blueblood\u2019s features a dangerous air. Casside himself looked morose and melancholy, his expression pessimistic. Illuminated by Richard\u2019s intellect and will, that same face became fierce\u2014not just handsome, but masculine and strong, the face of a warrior and a leader. It was a pity Casside had done so little with the gifts nature had given him.</p><p>\u201cYou must try to look less like yourself,\u201d she told him, caressing Richard\u2019s cheek with her fingertips. He was still hers, no matter whose face he wore.</p><p>He caught her fingers and kissed them. \u201cWhen the time comes, I will. Do you feel up to walking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDepends on how far.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo the back door. I have someone I would like you to meet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I can do that.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte pushed off the couch and followed him to the back, past the table filled with precisely organized stacks of paper and crystals. Days of peering over the documents had paid off. They knew the Five, as they had come to call the slaver bluebloods, better than they knew themselves, and they had formed the plan. Richard\u2019s face was the first part of it. Her part involved befriending Lady Ermine. She would do it with pleasure, Charlotte reflected. She would become her best friend and confidante; all for that moment when their scheme came to its conclusion, and she could snuff her out like the flame of a foul candle.</p><p>\u201cOnce I become Casside, I can\u2019t watch over you.\u201d Richard paused at the back door and took an orange from the fruit dish on the kitchen counter.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m hardly helpless,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cYes, but you can\u2019t use your magic in public, or you\u2019ll risk an arrest. And you don\u2019t have a fighter\u2019s reflexes.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte didn\u2019t argue with him. He was right. She could easily kill on a massive scale, but an average fighter would cut her down. Her reaction time wasn\u2019t honed enough. Her trek through the island had demonstrated that.</p><p>\u201cA bodyguard would be a welcome addition,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t be a part of blueblood society with a bodyguard,\u201d she told him. \u201cIt isn\u2019t customary and more importantly, the presence of a trained fighter among them would set the Five on edge, including Brennan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot this one.\u201d Richard opened the door.</p><p>Sophie stood on the lawn. She wore loose blue pants and a white shirt. Her dark hair was pulled back from her face into a neat ponytail. A sword in a sheath hung from her hip.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Charlotte said.</p><p>Richard threw the orange at Sophie. The girl moved, too fast, her strike a blur. The four pieces of the fruit fell onto the grass. Sophie flicked the juice off her blade.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Charlotte repeated.</p><p>\u201cJust as a precaution,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s typical for you to have a companion. Why not her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause we\u2019re playing a dangerous game, and I don\u2019t want her to get hurt.\u201d</p><p>Sophie didn\u2019t flinch. Her face remained placid, but hurt pulsed in her eyes. She was used to being rejected, Charlotte realized.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t the two of you discuss this?\u201d Richard said, and stepped into the house.</p><p>Oh great.</p><p>The child on the lawn looked at her with an almost canine expectation, like Sophie was some half-starved puppy and Charlotte held a steak in her hand. Charlotte stepped down onto the grass, fighting the slow burn of her aching muscles. \u201cShall we walk?\u201d</p><p>RICHARD watched Charlotte and Sophie walk away into the forest. The dog with no name trotted after them.</p><p>The faint sound of steps came from behind him. He recognized that walk.</p><p>Kaldar came to stand next to him, his face thoughtful. \u201cVery pretty, both of them. The two women you care about most.\u201d There was a slight hint of disapproval in his tone.</p><p>\u201cI suppose you came by to inform me I\u2019m making yet another grave mistake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Kaldar grimaced. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Richard sighed and motioned to him with his hand.</p><p>\u201cI checked on her,\u201d he said. \u201cDo you know who the first ten are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe first ten blueblood families who arrived in Adrianglia.\u201d The cream of the crop.</p><p>\u201cThey took Charlotte from her family when she was seven and brought her to Ganer College, where she met Lady Augustine al Ran, a direct descendant of the Ran family, who just happen to be one of the first ten. The Lady adopted her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMhm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRichard, you\u2019re not listening. She formally adopted her. Charlotte\u2019s full name is Charlotte de Ney al-te Ran. If the king hosts a dinner, she can sit at the first table, right next to the royal family.\u201d</p><p>Richard turned to him.</p><p>\u201cThey didn\u2019t publicize the adoption, probably to give Charlotte a fair chance at a normal life. It isn\u2019t even on her marriage license\u2014she signed it as de Ney. I don\u2019t think that moron she married ever knew. But it is in her Mirror file. Do you have any idea how many men would kill for a chance to marry into a first-ten family?\u201d</p><p>He had a pretty good idea. \u201cYour point?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrincesses don\u2019t marry swineherds in the real world,\u201d Kaldar said. \u201cWhen people hear her name, they stand up. You\u2019re an Edger, a swamp rat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember,\u201d Richard said. \u201cBut thank you for reminding me.\u201d</p><p>Kaldar ground his teeth. \u201cLet me remind you of something else: when Marissa left, you drank for two months straight, then tried to drown yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor the last bloody time, I didn\u2019t try to drown myself. I was drunk and out of wine, and I walked out onto the pier because I remembered I had left a bottle in the boat.\u201d And then he\u2019d slipped and discovered that swimming while drunk was a lot more complicated than it seemed. He\u2019d made it to shore and passed out on the bank from exhaustion, where Kaldar had found him. For some reason, everyone in the family insisted it was a suicide attempt, and nothing he said could convince them otherwise.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the only brother I\u2019ve got,\u201d Kaldar said. \u201cIf you follow through with this plan of yours, she will enter society without you. I\u2019m not faulting your plan\u2014you can\u2019t keep her locked up, and she would have to dip her toe into those waters sooner or later. The reality is, she\u2019s unattached, beautiful, and has the kind of name that will turn every head. The moment she\u2019s announced, they will start circling around her like sharks. These are people who have never in their lives had to worry about where their next meal was coming from. They can rattle off ten generations worth of ancestors at the drop of a hat. They\u2019re a different breed. Someone young, handsome, with the right pedigree and the right amount of money might catch her eye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are really worried about me.\u201d</p><p>A muscle jerked in Kaldar\u2019s face. \u201cWhen Marissa left, you were still young. A part of you knew you still had your whole life to live. You\u2019re older now, and you\u2019ve lost your head over her. You don\u2019t fall for women often, but when you do, it\u2019s all or nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince when did you become an expert on my love life?\u201d</p><p>Kaldar waved his arm around. \u201cIt\u2019s obvious. You watch her. You try to make her laugh. If she leaves you, it might break you, and I might not be here to hold your head above the water. I just want you to consider the possibility now, so it doesn\u2019t shock you when it comes.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIf I need help swimming, I\u2019ll let you know.\u201d</p><p>Kaldar opened his mouth as if to say something else and snapped it shut.</p><p>\u201cIs there more?\u201d Richard asked. \u201cOut with it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf you marry her, you would become a member of the al Ran family. Lady Augustine al Ran, the woman who adopted her, must grant her approval.\u201d Kaldar pulled a small clear imager cube out of his pocket and handed it to him. \u201cWatch this before you do anything else.\u201d</p><p>He walked away.</p><p>\u201cKaldar!\u201d</p><p>His brother turned and looked at him. Kaldar was genuinely worried for him. His brother wore his jokes and humor as armor. That he\u2019d dropped it for his sake spoke volumes. When Declan had first approached him with his proposition to hunt down the slavers, Richard never considered what might happen to Kaldar if he failed. Seeing families torn apart had taught him to pay better attention to those who mattered most to him. His brother had a wife who loved him and the support of what remained of their family, but if something happened to him, Kaldar wouldn\u2019t take it well. At the very least, he could give Kaldar the satisfaction of knowing he did everything he could to save Richard from himself.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll watch it together.\u201d</p> <p>Kaldar grimaced, turned on his heel, and joined him. They walked to the house side by side. Richard had considered the possibility that Charlotte might leave him, stolen away by the glamour of blueblood society. Her adoption into the first ten made it even more likely.</p><p>The cube was cold in his hand. He entered the house and approached the imager. It sat to the left of the couches, a tall, round table about a foot and a half in diameter, with ornate metalwork decorating its single leg. A brown-and-gold carapace of polished metal guarded the top of the table. He touched it, and it split down the middle, the two halves of the carapace sliding down the table\u2019s sides, revealing a delicate surface inlaid with strange designs. A pale blue glow shimmered along the surface, bathing the designs in its gentle radiance. At the center, three metal prongs rose in the semblance of an inverted bird leg armed with wicked talons.</p><p>He looked at the cube. Something told him he really didn\u2019t want to know what was on it. The Mirror was the realm\u2019s magpie: it gathered bits of information, some precious, some useless, and dragged them to its archives, like a foolish bird dragged baubles that caught its eye to its nest. There was no telling what he would see.</p><p>The talons waited.</p><p>He would rather know. Richard dropped the cube into the claws. The prongs closed about it. A dim blue light ignited within the cube, and an image of Charlotte formed above it. She was sitting on a balcony, somewhere high above. She looked younger, softer somehow. Her hair was gathered into a roll like a crown on her head, and her dress, a pale green, spilled on the floor. She truly did look like a princess.</p><p>A man stood next to her. He was slender, his hair a light brown. He wore a light jacket, fitted with crisp precision to his frame, matching pants, soft boots. The clothes announced money and a good tailor.</p> <p>\u201cYou look very nice, Elvei,\u201d Charlotte said.</p><p>\u201cThank you. You look divine, as usual.\u201d</p><p>Elvei. Her ex-husband. Richard peered at the man\u2019s face, assessing him as one fighter would assess another. Unless the man was an incredibly gifted flasher, Richard was reasonably sure he could take him. He could find no resemblance between himself and Elvei. They looked nothing alike. Perhaps that was part of the attraction. A selfish part of him said it didn\u2019t matter why she liked him, but still, he wanted her to be with him because of who he was, not because of how he compared to the man she\u2019d chosen before.</p><p>Elvei sat in a chair near the bench. \u201cI hope you don\u2019t mind if I pry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t say that I will until you ask me the question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I will just come out and ask it plainly. Why is it necessary for Lady Augustine al Ran to approve our union?\u201d</p><p>Charlotte leaned back. \u201cI\u2019ve told you the story of how I came to be at the College. I was taken from my family when I was very young. Over the years, I\u2019ve come to think of Lady Augustine as my mentor. Her opinion is very important to me. Why is this troubling to you?\u201d</p><p>Elvei smiled. \u201cIt appears today is my day to be blunt. I commend you for your devotion to your mentor, but the extent of the Lady al Ran\u2019s inquiries into my background has been exceptionally . . . comprehensive. She requested the files on the first seven generations of my ancestors.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo you have something to hide?\u201d Charlotte asked.</p><p>\u201cOf course not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen don\u2019t trouble yourself.\u201d She smiled and reached out to caress his face. The muscles in Richard\u2019s arms tightened.</p><p>\u201cYou worry too much, Elvei.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCharlotte, you are of age and have been for quite some time. You don\u2019t really need her permission to marry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cElvei, I would never consider a long-term relationship, let alone marriage, with any man who hadn\u2019t met with Lady Augustine\u2019s approval. She\u2019s like a mother to me, and her view is vital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if she disapproved of me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would break our engagement. I\u2019m afraid that\u2019s the price you have to pay for being with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I will gladly pay it.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte smiled. The image melted.</p><p>\u201cThere you have it,\u201d Kaldar said. \u201cIf you want a life with Charlotte, you\u2019ll have to battle Lady Augustine, and that\u2019s not a war you can win. When she asks about your background, what will you tell her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat I\u2019m a Mire rat.\u201d Richard grinned. \u201cThat my father was a Mire rat, his father before him, and on and on, all the way to the beginning of our family when the ancient Legionnaires first settling the continent got trapped in the Mire and mixed with the natives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you should mention Vernard while you\u2019re at it.\u201d Kaldar shook his head.</p><p>\u201cYes, how could I forget. Dear Lady, my granduncle-in-law was an exile, one of my uncles was a changeling, and a few of my cousins aren\u2019t even human. I have a tiny slice of land and very little money, and the only reason I\u2019m allowed in Adrianglia at all is because my cousin Cerise married a changeling, who promised the Mirror ten years of service in exchange for asylum and citizenship for the Mar family. Did I miss anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should have Charlotte there when you tell her that, or the noble lady might suffer an apoplexy. You\u2019re not taking this seriously, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s rich, coming form a man who never took anything seriously.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI take the safety of my wife and my family very seriously. What has gotten into you? Is any of this penetrating that thick skull of yours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not worried about the bluebloods stealing Charlotte away. She has seen them before, and she chose me instead. We also have bigger problems than Lady Augustine.\u201d Richard crossed the room to the bookcase and pulled a heavy, embossed volume from the top of the shelf. He\u2019d moved it there so Charlotte wouldn\u2019t find it.</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCharlotte can kill with her magic.\u201d</p><p>Kaldar stared at him. \u201cShe\u2019s a fallen healer. Richard, they\u2019ll kill her if they find out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s part of the problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the other part?\u201d</p><p>The book felt heavy, like a chunk of solid rock. Richard flipped through the pages, turning the thick paper sheets to a particular article, and offered the book to his brother. He had read it so many times, he had committed the words to memory. He kept hoping it would say something different. It didn\u2019t.</p><p>The act of draining another\u2019s magic to fuel oneself is colloquially known as life-force drain, a term which originated from the first-person accounts of the rare few who had experienced it. They describe this phenomenon as draining or stealing the target\u2019s life. In reality, the user and the target form a magic feedback loop, and it is the target\u2019s magic energy, not some mysterious life force, that is being drained. However, since a human body is unable to sustain life without this magic energy, when a target\u2019s magic is depleted, the target dies, so the term isn\u2019t as inaccurate as it may seem at first glance.</p><p>In the event of life-force drain, the user attracts the magic of the target, pulling it to himself and absorbing this energy. The user quickly becomes overwhelmed with the influx of incoming magic, and his body begins to radiate it out in whatever form feels most natural to the user. The user then invariably sends out more magic than he takes in, which in turn, causes him to absorb more magic in a greater volume, which he again must disperse. This essential cycle of absorbing and dispersing is ever expanding; the longer it continues, the harder it is to stop. Consider a snowball rolling down the hill: the longer it rolls, the bigger it grows. The longer the duration of the feedback loop, the greater the amount of magic that passes through the user, until eventually the user becomes a mindless conduit for the flow of magical energy.</p><p>There are known instances of interrupted feedback loops, where the user had begun the draw of energy but engaged in it for only a few brief moments. These users report feelings of euphoria and extreme pleasure associated with the absorption of magic. No doubt, this contributes to the difficulty of feedback-loop interruption. In plain terms: stealing magic produces pleasure and is self-rewarding, so much so that many users do not want to stop, and, after a few minutes, they find they cannot.</p><p>For the purposes of this study, eleven confirmed instances of interrupted feedback loop were examined, and in nine out of eleven cases, the users reattempted the feedback loop at a later date. All nine lost their humanity and had to be destroyed, as they presented an imminent threat to others. It is this author\u2019s opinion that surviving one interrupted loop is possible; however, interrupting such a loop for a second time is beyond the limits of human will.</p><p>Kaldar looked up from the page. \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow much did George tell you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that you were injured, ran into the Edge, she healed you, then the slavers came, killed the boys\u2019 grandmother, set the house on fire, and threw you in the cage. Charlotte saved you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhen she found us, she initiated a feedback loop. It was her first time killing, and she didn\u2019t think she had enough power. She can kill without it, but every time she does, her magic pushes her toward making it again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if she does?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe will pull magic to her from her enemies and send it out as a plague, then she will drain more magic and send that out, and on and on, until everyone around her is dead. She would become a plaguebringer. She would never stop.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo she would become an unstoppable crazed mass murder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes she know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe knows. She asked me to kill her if she succumbs to it. I tried to talk her out of fighting the slavers, but she refuses to walk away.\u201d</p><p>Kaldar sank into the couch. His face was completely serious, something that almost never happened.</p> <p>\u201cCongratulations,\u201d he said, his voice dry. \u201cYou finally managed to find a woman as tragically noble as yourself. I didn\u2019t think one existed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not tragic.\u201d</p><p>Kaldar held up his hand. \u201cSpare me. Some children are born wearing a silk shirt; you were born wrapped in melancholy. When they slapped you to make you cry, you just sighed heavily and a single tear rolled from your eye.\u201d He dragged his finger from the corner of his left eye to his cheek. \u201cYour first words were probably \u2018woe is me.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy first words were \u2018Kaldar, shut up!\u2019 because you talked too much. Still do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have grimly acknowledged the sadness of your situation since you were a kid. You don\u2019t even notice it anymore.\u201d</p><p>Richard leaned forward. \u201cWould it be better if I turned everything into a constant joke?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, someone has to make you laugh; otherwise, you\u2019d collapse under the burden of being you. People can share in the joke. Nobody can share in your anguish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been the butt of your jokes all my life, and let me tell you, it\u2019s not quite as fun.\u201d</p><p>They stared at each other. If Richard had a wet wig in his hands, he would\u2019ve thrown it against the wall and kicked his brother in the chest. Sadly, they were too old to brawl.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why the face,\u201d Kaldar said. \u201cYou did it for her, so you can be on the inside, working against the Five instead of her. Is she worth it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs Audrey worth it?\u201d Richard asked.</p><p>\u201cLeave my wife out of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou gave yourself up to the Hand for her. Was it worth it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. And I\u2019d do it again.\u201d Kaldar sighed. His shoulders slumped in defeat. \u201cWhat do you need from me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll need your help,\u201d Richard said.</p><p>\u201cYou have it. We\u2019re family.\u201d</p><p>Richard went to the wine cabinet, got a bottle of green wine and two glasses, and brought it over. He poured the wine. Kaldar swallowed some and smiled. \u201cTastes like home. Where did you find the berries? I thought they only grew in the Mire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAunt Pete grew them somehow in a greenhouse behind her home.\u201d He let the wine roll down his throat. The delicious light taste refreshed him, whispering of swamp and home.</p><p>Brennan, Lady Augustine, blueblood society, all of it, he could handle. They were just people. But he had no idea how to protect Charlotte from herself. He couldn\u2019t lose her. He tensed at the thought, his muscles locked, as if he were fighting for his life. Fear gripped him. He was so rarely afraid, and here he sat, terrified.</p><p>Suggesting that she sit this one out would only have the opposite effect. She would just fight harder.</p><p>He went over the plan in his head. They would lay a two-part trap for Brennan, and he would take care of the first half of the plan. With luck, Brennan would take his bait, and Charlotte\u2019s involvement might not even be necessary. If he failed to entice Brennan, the plan didn\u2019t call for her to use much of her power, only for the use of her name and position. She would be in minimal danger.</p><p>If they succeeded by some crazy stroke of luck, he would do everything in his power to make her happy.</p><p>\u201cYou really didn\u2019t try to kill yourself?\u201d Kaldar asked.</p><p>Damn it. \u201cKilling yourself requires desperation. I wasn\u2019t desperate. You know why I drank? I drank because I was angry. I swore to love her and defend her. I gave her a house, I provided for her, and I treated her well. Even if she didn\u2019t love me, it should\u2019ve been enough. Had she left me for a man, I would understand. I would be angry, but I wouldn\u2019t want to keep her with me against her will if she chose another man. She left me because her life wasn\u2019t nice enough. That\u2019s how low I ranked, somewhere down below the \u2018nice house\u2019 and \u2018no mud in the yard.\u2019 I drank because I was pissed off and didn\u2019t want to do something stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t hold back. Tell me how you really feel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI deserved better than a fucking note!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe she was afraid she couldn\u2019t leave with you there,\u201d Kaldar said.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell does that mean?\u201d Richard spread his arms. \u201cAre you implying I\u2019d hurt her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m implying that Marissa was never much for confrontations. Although I don\u2019t know, you\u2019re a scary bastard when you get going.\u201d Kaldar winked at him.</p><p>Richard pointed at him.</p><p>\u201cOh gods, the finger of doom. Deliver me!\u201d</p><p>He would not pummel his brother. It wouldn\u2019t be right. Richard forced himself to sit down in the chair. \u201cAre you quite finished?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Well, no, I could go on, but I\u2019ll spare you.\u201d Kaldar poured more wine. \u201cIt will work out. It always does.\u201d</p><p>Richard raised his glass. \u201cI\u2019ll drink to that.\u201d</p><p>SOPHIE pulled a cloth from the pocket of her tunic and carefully cleaned the blade. She and Charlotte strolled down the path into the woods, the wolf-dog trotting in front of them like some monster from a child\u2019s fairy tale.</p><p>\u201cDo you have to do this every time you take your sword out?\u201d Charlotte asked.</p><p>\u201cIf I draw blood,\u201d the girl answered quietly. \u201cAnd the orange juice is acidic. It will corrode the blade.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not make a stainless-steel sword?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStainless steel doesn\u2019t bend. A sword must be flexible, or it will break.\u201d</p><p>Much like people. \u201cDid Richard talk you into becoming my bodyguard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI asked him. He said that the opportunity exists, but the final decision is yours, and he had \u2018neither the capability nor the inclination to compel you to do anything against your will.\u2019 He\u2019s very formal sometimes.\u201d</p><p>He would say something like that, wouldn\u2019t he? \u201cThe people we\u2019re up against will not hesitate to kill you even though you\u2019re a child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t hesitate either,\u201d Sophie said with quiet determination. \u201cAnd I\u2019m faster and better skilled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still a child.\u201d</p><p>Sophie took a step. Her hand blurred again: strike, strike, strike\u2014was it three? Four?\u2014and she sheathed her sword.</p><p>The woods stood silent. Nothing moved.</p><p>Sophie sighed, reached out, and pushed a four-inch-wide sapling with her finger. The tree slid aside, breaking into four pieces as it fell.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not as dramatic when it doesn\u2019t fall by itself,\u201d Sophie said. \u201cI\u2019m faster than Richard. It takes him a third of a second longer to stretch his flash onto the blade. Do you know what that means?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Somehow she knew the answer wouldn\u2019t be good.</p><p>\u201cIt means I can kill him,\u201d Sophie said.</p><p>Dawn Mother. She chose her words carefully. \u201cDo you want to kill Richard?\u201d</p><p>Sophie shook her head. \u201cWhen Spider fused my mother, William killed her. He is my brother-in-law, and it was a mercy killing. My father died with her. He\u2019s alive, technically. He eats and breathes and talks. But he is . . . absent. He tries to take care of the family because it\u2019s his duty, but if the rest of us disappeared tomorrow, he would walk off the nearest cliff.\u201d Sophie turned to her. \u201cIt\u2019s not fair. I didn\u2019t die. I\u2019m still here, but he doesn\u2019t care.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d said it so flatly, her aspect so neutral. She was barely fifteen years old and already she was masking her pain. Charlotte fought an urge to reach out and hug her. It probably wouldn\u2019t be welcomed.</p><p>\u201cHe must care. A parent doesn\u2019t just abandon a child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy father did. He loved my mother so much, and now she is gone, and the world stopped for him. He stopped training me. He stopped talking to me after dinner. He stopped talking to everyone unless it\u2019s absolutely necessary, so I suppose I shouldn\u2019t expect special treatment just because I\u2019m his daughter.\u201d</p><p>So much damage. A low pain squeezed Charlotte\u2019s chest. It felt like her heart had turned over.</p><p>\u201cRichard is the only father I have now. He takes care of me. But I\u2019m faster, and he would hesitate to cut me down. He loves me very much. So I know I can kill him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a cold thing to say.\u201d</p><p>Sophie glanced at her, surprised. \u201cYou think so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just a fact.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cI can\u2019t help it.\u201d</p><p>Anything Charlotte said to that would sound like a criticism. The coldness was likely a barrier Sophie had built, and the fact that it was there meant fragility. Charlotte stayed silent. Perhaps later, if they had a chance to forge more trust, she could return to it.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re planning to expose Brennan at the Grand Thane\u2019s wedding,\u201d Sophie said.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know this?\u201d Did Richard actually tell her?</p><p>Sophie raised her head. Light filtering through the trees dappled her face. \u201cHawk.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte looked up as well. A bird of prey soared above the treetops, circling around them.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s dead,\u201d Sophie said. \u201cGeorge is guiding it. He is very powerful.\u201d</p><p>The realization washed over Charlotte in a cold gush of embarrassment. \u201cIs George spying on Richard and me?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAlways,\u201d Sophie said. \u201cAll those perfect manners are a sham. He spies on everyone and everything. Declan hasn\u2019t been able to conduct a single business meeting in the past year without George\u2019s knowing all the details. He does let go when you make love. He is a prude.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2018Prude\u2019 is a coarse word. He has a sense of tact,\u201d Charlotte corrected before she caught herself.</p><p>\u201cA sense of tact,\u201d Sophie repeated, tasting the words. \u201cThank you. The other one is somewhere around here, too.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe other one?\u201d</p><p>Sophie surveyed the woods. \u201cI can smell you, Jack!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you can\u2019t,\u201d a distant voice answered.</p><p>The dog barked and shot through the bushes to the side.</p><p>\u201cI told you.\u201d Sophie smiled. \u201cSpider will attend the wedding of Grand Thane. He\u2019s a peer of the Dukedom of Louisiana. His rank demands it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou can\u2019t kill Spider,\u201d Charlotte told her.</p><p>\u201cI just want to see him. He took my mother and my father away from me.\u201d Sophie\u2019s dark eyes looked bottomless. \u201cI want to see his face. I want to brand it in my head.\u201d She tapped her skull. \u201cSo I\u2019ll never forget it. Because we will meet again, and when we do, I want to be absolutely certain that I kill the right man.\u201d</p><p>She was frightening.</p><p>\u201cPlease let me do this, Lady de Ney. Please.\u201d Her words were a fierce, savage whisper. Sophie dropped on one knee. \u201cYou have lost someone. You know how it feels. I\u2019m running in circles, like a mouse on a wheel. I just want a way to get off. Please.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte\u2019s memory conjured the nightmare of her house burning. She had felt so helpless standing there, on that lawn, watching \u00c9l\u00e9onore\u2019s remains smolder as the ash rained on Tulip\u2019s hair. She chose to do something about it because she possessed the means to do it. When Spider tore this child\u2019s parents from her, she must\u2019ve felt helpless, too. She banished Sophie, gave up the person she was, and became Lark, who cut trees into pieces faster than the eye could follow.</p><p>She and Richard, they were exactly alike. Ice over fire, a cool exterior hiding uncontrollable passion and emotion beneath. If Charlotte shut Sophie out now, she would be inflicting another wound. The very fury that fueled the child\u2019s transformation might tear her apart.</p> <p>Charlotte sighed. \u201cHow proficient are you in etiquette?\u201d</p><p>Sophie stood up. \u201cI took lessons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame instructor as Rose?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you know?\u201d</p><p>Charlotte reached over and brushed a twig off Sophie\u2019s tunic. \u201cThe gown you wore when I saw you the first time. It\u2019s a decade too old for you. We have a lot of work to do, my dear. If you really want to come with me, you must be flawless.\u201d</p><p>SOPHIE drank from a tiny cup, holding it with effortless grace. Charlotte sat across from her. In the three days she had spent with her, Sophie had soaked up information like a sponge. She was a natural mimic in the best possible sense of the word\u2014she imitated not only the action but the air, the atmosphere Charlotte projected, and the change in her demeanor was immediate.</p><p>The door swung open, and Jack strode into the cabin. Moving in complete silence, he approached the table and dropped a crystal in the middle of it.</p><p>\u201cThis is everything.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Charlotte told him.</p><p>He surveyed Sophie sitting in a simple pale peach gown and crouched by her, his eyes big in his handsome face. George had the elegance, there was no question. But Jack was wildfire. There was something about the child, about the way he held himself, the raw potential for unpredictability, perhaps, or the air of danger he emitted, that would give Jack an allure all of his own in a few years.</p><p>\u201cI have an idea,\u201d he said.</p><p>Sophie tilted her head, looking at him with her dark velvet eyes.</p><p>\u201cDitch the dress and come hunting with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re such a child,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re turning into an old lady.\u201d</p><p>Sophie smiled and stabbed a dagger into the table. She moved so fast, she was a blur, but somehow Jack had moved his hand, and the dagger pierced wood instead of flesh.</p><p>Charlotte sipped from her cup. \u201cOne more, and both of you will be down with dysentery for a week.\u201d</p><p>Jack moved backward and sprawled in a chair, exasperated.</p><p>Charlotte slid the crystal into the thin metal claw of an imager. A light filtered through the crystal, forming the image of a young girl in a vivid blue gown.</p><p>\u201cNext.\u201d</p><p>Another young blueblood flower, another blue satin.</p><p>\u201cNext.\u201d</p><p>More young girls. Cornflower blue. Royal blue. Sky-blue.</p><p>\u201cBoring people doing boring things wearing boring clothes,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>\u201cBlue is in season.\u201d Charlotte surveyed Sophie. \u201cWhat shade of bright blue looks good on you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, my lady,\u201d Sophie answered.</p><p>\u201cNone,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>Sophie arched her eyebrows at him. \u201cWhen I want your opinion, I will cut it out of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn this case, he\u2019s right. You would be surprised, but men do usually have an excellent eye when it comes to female clothes. Look at your wrist. You too, Jack.\u201d</p><p>Both of them turned their right arms, displaying their wrist. She did the same. \u201cSee how the veins in my wrist and Jack\u2019s look really blue? We have a cool undertone to our skin. Veins in your wrist have a slight green tint because of the warm undertones of your beautiful golden bronze skin. Cool colors such as blue, purple, or turquoise won\u2019t look good on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could wear white,\u201d Sophie offered. \u201cLady Renda says white is always in season.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhite is for cowards,\u201d Charlotte said. \u201cAnd Lady Renda is a dinosaur.\u201d</p><p>Sophie choked on her tea. Jack chortled.</p><p>\u201cWhen people say white, they often mean a really icy white, which has cool undertones. Pure black isn\u2019t a good idea either. Jack, because of his cooler skin tone, would look very well in black; you wouldn\u2019t. Richard\u2019s skin tone is similar to yours. He wears black, and although he\u2019s a very handsome man, it doesn\u2019t resonate with his skin; it just makes him look menacing. True white is a neutral color\u2014everyone looks well in it, but there is no daring in it, no sense of style. Wear it, and you might just as well announce that you\u2019re playing it safe. We don\u2019t play it safe. We make a statement.\u201d Charlotte passed her hand over the crystal to reactivate it. \u201cColor wheel, stage twelve.\u201d</p><p>A complex color wheel ignited in the air above the reader. In the center, twelve bright colors formed the inner core: first, the primary shades of red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and violet. Between them were six transitional shades. Past the center, the color wheel split, with each of the twelve inner colors fracturing into four shades. Just outside the center, the color shades turned dark, nearly black. Hair-thin lines sectioned off the wheel into individual colors, each new tone a shade lighter than the previous one, until at the outer rim of the wheel, the colors became nearly white.</p><p>\u201cThis is your secret weapon. Remember that first blue gown?\u201d Charlotte nodded at the wheel. \u201cFind the color segment.\u201d</p><p>Sophie stared at it for a second. \u201cNumber twenty-six.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery good. It\u2019s a saturated derivate of cobalt blue.\u201d Charlotte touched the gears. The color wheel slid higher, and the row of pictures she had viewed ignited below it.</p><p>\u201cThey are all within the same segment,\u201d Sophie said. \u201cThe color varies slightly, but they are playing it safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly. These are the unmarried young women who are supposed to be on the cusp of fashion, which is why they are all wearing what they consider to be the cutting-edge trend. The older the woman, the more vivid the color, but none of them are deviating from the blues\u2014they\u2019re like goats in a herd all following the leading goat. Women who are either attached or are not looking to impress their awareness of fashion onto others will wear whatever color they please. This is the daughter of Duchess Ramone.\u201d Charlotte pointed at the next-to-last picture of a tall, slender young girl. \u201cI\u2019ve met her before. See, she\u2019s wearing green.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShocking!\u201d Jack called out from his chair.</p><p>\u201cShe is young and \u2018in the market,\u2019 so to speak, but she has enough status and daring to do whatever she wants. She also knows that vivid blue isn\u2019t her color either. Still, if you look at the dress closely, there are notes of blue in it. The idea is not to spit in the eye of the current trend but subtly twist it to make it your own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is ridiculous,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>\u201cFashion is utterly ridiculous,\u201d Charlotte told him. \u201cAnd ninety-nine percent of the fashion is who is wearing it. Some no name wears an ugly hat, and people say it\u2019s an ugly hat. If Duchess Ramone wears an ugly hat, people say, \u2018What an interesting new trend.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo it\u2019s about money?\u201d Sophie asked.</p><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s about poise. You must be supremely confident in what you\u2019re wearing and comfortable in your own skin. Being a blueblood isn\u2019t just knowing the rules. It\u2019s knowing the precisely correct thing to do in every situation, then doing it with unshakable entitlement.\u201d</p><p>Sophie frowned, puzzled.</p><p>Charlotte smiled at her. \u201cIt\u2019s not very difficult. Have no fear, we\u2019ll practice. But back to the color wheel. Forget white and black. We must show off your skin, your neck, and that face. This is where the impact should be.\u201d Charlotte picked up a drawing pad. \u201cSegment 28, row 17.\u201d</p><p>A beautiful warm gray, reminiscent at once of the pearly inside of an oyster shell and the soft glow of polished aluminum, ignited above the imager.</p><p>Sophie leaned forward, her eyes wide. \u201cIt\u2019s the color of my sword.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte smiled and began to sketch. They would have to add some pale blue accents to nod at the trend, but nothing major.</p><p>\u201cBut where will we get the dress?\u201d Sophie asked.</p><p>\u201cDresses. We each need a set of at least six outfits, all tied together with similar design elements. We\u2019ll take a page out of Richard\u2019s playbook, contact the best dressmaker we can find, and throw an obscene amount of money at her.\u201d Charlotte continued to sketch. The dressmaker would likely balk\u2014the silhouette that emerged on the paper was slightly uncommon for a young girl, but it suited Sophie perfectly. \u201cIf she digs her heels in, we\u2019ll find another. I\u2019m not without means, and when it comes to dresses, money makes a most convincing argument.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to spend money on me,\u201d Sophie said. \u201cMy sister is married to William Sandine. I can get bucketloads of money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have to\u2014I want to.\u201d Charlotte grinned and turned to Jack. \u201cWould you like to help?\u201d</p><p>The expression on his face underwent a lightning change, from surprise, to fear, to a bored, distant expression. \u201cI suppose,\u201d he said, and yawned. \u201cIf I\u2019m bored.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s his nonchalant expression,\u201d Sophie said. \u201cHe puts it on when he doesn\u2019t know how to respond.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you on good terms with the Duchess of the Southern Provinces?\u201d Charlotte asked. Declan\u2019s mother was precisely the kind of heavy hitter who would make a decisive difference in their entrance to society.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m adored,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>Sophie snorted.</p><p>Jack glanced at her, indignant. \u201cThat\u2019s what she always says.\u201d He slipped into a perfect imitation of a highborn blueblood accent. \u201c\u2018Oh, Jack. I adore you, you silly boy.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Charlotte lost it and laughed. \u201cDo you think your adorableness can arrange for the two of us to have tea with Her Grace?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPiece of cake,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>RICHARD opened his eyes. Charlotte had come up the stairs and paused, studying him lying in bed. Darkness had fallen, and the gentle lights of the lanterns played on her face. She was beautiful. Looking at her opened a gaping hole inside him born from the knowledge he soon would have to let go.</p><p>They hadn\u2019t made love since the operation on his face. He wanted her so badly, it burned, more than a want, a need akin to an addiction. He was addicted to Charlotte, to her scent, her taste, the soft touch of her skin against his. To watching her gasp in surprise when he brought her to a climax. He needed her the way he needed air, and anticipation of their separation set his teeth on edge.</p><p>In this moment, he regretted everything: every word he had said to her seemed wrong, every gesture coarse and stupid. She deserved . . . someone better than him, but he was deeply selfish and would do everything in his power to keep her.</p><p>\u201cWhere is Sophie?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe left,\u201d Charlotte said. \u201cSupposedly to say good-bye to her sister. Unfortunately, Jack had let it slip that Cerise and William are already out on assignment. She\u2019s giving us privacy. I suspect all of the undead mice, squirrels, and birds watching your Lair are gone, too.\u201d</p><p>He slipped into formal blueblood affectation. \u201cDear gods, are they expecting us to have intimate relations?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt appears so. Do the children know something I don\u2019t?\u201d she asked.</p><p>She\u2019d changed the subject. \u201cKaldar sent a message through George,\u201d Richard said. \u201cBrennan left for the Southern Coast. Supposedly he\u2019s visiting a sick friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe went to tour the island,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd now with him out of the way, you want to make the switch and become Casside?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re ready to begin our scheme.\u201d And once they began, they couldn\u2019t be seen together. No hint of their alliance could exist.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m ready,\u201d she told him. \u201cChoosing a dressmaker presented a dilemma, but I found one who is talented, poor, and hungry to make her mark. The dress orders are in, and I\u2019ve piled money on her with promises of more. The first two gowns will be ready in record time. Jack is arranging a tea with Declan\u2019s mother. I plan to come clean and ask for her assistance. My introduction will be much smoother if she lays the groundwork. I think I could convince her to help us. With or without Her Grace\u2019s backing, I should make an appearance at the capital within two days at the celebration of Spring\u2019s End.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill Sophie be ready?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes and no.\u201d Charlotte shook her head. \u201cThe basics are there, and she is very smart. Being a maiden of escort isn\u2019t exactly complex. I did it when I was her age\u2014you walk three steps behind your sponsor and don\u2019t talk unless spoken to. While she doesn\u2019t know everything yet, she\u2019ll do fine.\u201d</p><p>The anxiety ate at him. \u201cSounds like you have things in hand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould we go through the plan again?\u201d They had gone over it a dozen times, but the moment he left, events would spiral out of his control.</p><p>\u201cYou will travel to the capital and replace Casside. You\u2019re planning on kidnapping him on the way to his weekly card game, which he will attend. The attack on the island likely made Brennan furious, and the four bluebloods under him will strive to maintain the status quo out of sheer self-preservation. You will kidnap Casside, remove his retainers from the house, and your family will detain them until we\u2019re done.\u201d She invited him to continue.</p><p>\u201cIn two days, you will make an appearance at the Spring\u2019s End Ball,\u201d Richard said. \u201cYou will make an impression on Angelia Ermine. You will befriend her. It\u2019s likely that she is sleeping with Brennan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said that before,\u201d Charlotte said. \u201cWhat makes you so sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you remember that speech Brennan had written while in Academy about leadership as the true purpose of the monarchy?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. They had read it to each other out loud.</p><p>\u201cHe wants the throne. He thinks he\u2019s destined to rule, but he will never acquire the crown,\u201d Richard said. \u201cHe\u2019s too far removed from the line of succession. It\u2019s killing him inside. The slaver ring is his kingdom, and Casside, Angelia, Rene, and Maedoc are his thanes. He would demand absolute loyalty from them. Angelia is young, unattached, and attractive. He would want the satisfaction of owning her completely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAngelia is scum. I\u2019ll have to strain not to kill her.\u201d Charlotte shook her head. \u201cWhile I\u2019m working on her, you will stage an attempt on Brennan\u2019s life, making him think that Maedoc is trying to kill him.\u201d</p><p>It was a difficult plan, one that demanded that both of them surrender their best weapons. He would have to use his sword without the benefit of the flash technique, but she wouldn\u2019t be able to use her magic either. That fact filled him with relief. Still, killing Brennan would have been so much easier with it.</p><p>Suddenly Charlotte stepped toward him and embraced him. Her lips touched his. He kissed her deeply and tasted desperation. \u201cAre you afraid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m terrified,\u201d she said.</p><p>He held her to him. \u201cI wish I knew what to say,\u201d he murmured. \u201cI wish I had the right words.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me what will happen if we win,\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cIf we win, I will find you,\u201d he told her. \u201cAnd if it\u2019s in my power, we will never be apart again. If you will have me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if I won\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>He raised his eyebrows. \u201cI\u2019ll probably beg. Or do one of those stupid dramatic things men do to win women over. If we still lived in the time of knights, I\u2019d just unhorse anyone who stood in my way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll hold you to it,\u201d she whispered, and kissed him back.</p><p>HER Grace, Lady Jane Olivia Camarine, Duchess of the Southern Provinces, was flawless, Charlotte reflected. She looked to be in her late forties although likely older since her son, the Earl of Camarine, was past thirty. Her tunic and trousers, a gorgeous emerald green and cream, were tailored with a deceptive simplicity that masked her thickening waist while playing up the duchess\u2019s curves. Her hair, artfully layered on her head in twin plaits, elongated her round face. She wore a single piece of jewelry, a wedding ring crafted from spider-silk-thin tendrils of gold. It was both extremely expensive and superbly tasteful. She stood on the terrace, next to a picnic table, bathed in morning light.</p><p>\u201cLook at the way she stands,\u201d Charlotte murmured, as she and Sophie followed Jack to the table. \u201cChin tilted upward to make the neck appear thinner; light on the left, so it will play up the draping lines on her tunic. Long vertical lines, like those, make you appear thinner. You must always be aware of the light and know your best angles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour Grace,\u201d Jack said. \u201cMay I present Charlotte de Ney and Lark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSophie Mar,\u201d Charlotte murmured under her breath.</p><p>\u201cAnd Sophie Mar,\u201d he intoned.</p><p>Charlotte curtsied. Next to her, Sophie sank down gracefully.</p><p>\u201cWhat a pleasure to meet you both.\u201d The duchess smiled warmly. \u201cChildren, do you actually want to be here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Jack and Sophie chorused.</p><p>The duchess grinned. \u201cBroderick fixed the fountain in the pool.\u201d She pointed with her thumb over her shoulder in a distinctly unblueblood gesture. \u201cFlee while you can!\u201d</p><p>The two teenagers took off down the wide white stairs toward the pool gleaming in the middle of the lawn. At the last step, as if by some signal, they broke into a run, flying across the grass. Jack spilled out of his clothes. Sophie grasped the hem of her gown. Dear Dawn Mother, please let there be something under it. The gown flew off, revealing a small bikini. The two teenagers leaped in unison and vanished into the water.</p><p>\u201cThey planned this, didn\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d imagine so,\u201d Her Grace said. \u201cShall we?\u201d</p><p>They sat at a table.</p><p>\u201cI remember you. You were only fifteen at the time, but I recall you escorting Augustine al Ran.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m flattered,\u201d Charlotte said.</p><p>\u201cSo is it Charlotte de Ney?\u201d</p><p>There was no point in hiding. \u201cCharlotte de Ney al-te Ran, Your Grace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought so. Jack mentioned that you\u2019ve been living in the Edge for the past three years. Have you been to see your mother since your return?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Your Grace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe boys have given me a summary of your plan. Is it true? A Brennan is dealing in slaves?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Your Grace.\u201d</p><p>The duchess looked at the two teenagers splashing in the pool. \u201cI knew his parents. They were nice people. Capable, morally upright, conscious of their responsibilities. I wonder if they know. I doubt it. As a parent, you always worry and wonder if you went wrong somewhere, if something you said or did caused your child to stray from the path.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWith all due respect, he did more than stray,\u201d Charlotte said. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t believe the horrors I\u2019ve seen.\u201d</p><p>A shadow passed over the duchess\u2019s face. \u201cPerhaps I would. I will help you, my dear. We have a duty to bring him down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Your Grace.\u201d</p> <p>An outraged howl came from the pool, followed by Sophie\u2019s laugh.</p><p>The duchess sighed. \u201cSophie doesn\u2019t trust many people. I\u2019ve tried to forge a bond, but she very politely keeps me at arm\u2019s length. If Sophie chose, she could live with her sister, but she selected not to do it. She holds herself apart, but she seems to respond to you. It\u2019s a precious connection. Please safeguard it.\u201d</p><p>THIRTEEN</p><p>GEORGE stood next to the Duchess of Southern Provinces, or Lady Olivia, as she preferred to be called, and surveyed the glittering gathering of the Adrianglian elite. Not all of them were blueblood, but all were rich or powerful or both. Lady Olivia wore a green bracelet on her left wrist, which signaled that she wished to maintain her privacy, and they were left to their own devices.</p><p>Around them, the vast terrace of the Evergreen castle stretched into the night, bordered by tall, pale columns, each supporting a tasteful cascade of flowers growing from marble planters. Dense trees surrounded the terrace on the north and south. To the west, the entrance to the castle\u2019s first floor gaped open, illuminated with golden light. There, the new arrivals paused at the entrance to be announced and recognized before drifting on to mingle. To the right, the trees had been cleared, and the ground dropped to the shimmering waters of the Evergreen Lake. Above burned the sunset, a garish spectacle of red and gold so vivid, it almost hurt.</p> <p>Standing there, watching people flutter by, George felt a peculiar sense of detachment, as if he were in a dream. The end of spring was an ancient celebration, born in a more violent time, when starvation decimated the population, war was frequent, and human life cheap. The people who\u2019d begun it wore simple clothes and carried savage weapons. They gave thanks to their gods for surviving to summer. Now their descendants floated on, dressed in fine gowns and tailored jackets, aware but unwilling to acknowledge the tradition of blood that gave the festival its roots. But they were still just as brutal as their ancestors. If a threat were to appear, the entire gathering would spark with bursts of lightning as their magic sliced it to pieces.</p><p>The George Camarine side of him reminded him of the commonly known facts about each familiar face, while the Mirror agent side served up their secrets. Here came Lady Olla in a beautiful gown of sea-foam green, a white flower in her red hair. She had a penchant for collecting crystal figurines of dragons and a severe addiction to sumah. He knew the names of her suppliers and where they could be found. Lord Ronkor, a former logistics officer and now a transportation supervisor in the Department of the Interior, broad-shouldered, confident, exuded an air of masculine swagger as he took wide strides across the floor. Lord Ronkor enjoyed being spanked by young women and was notoriously quick in bed, according to the prostitutes he frequented. His wife hadn\u2019t noticed\u2014she was carrying on a decade-long affair with her best friend\u2019s sister. Yes, hello, how are you? How\u2019s your cousin, the one working in Kamen Port Authority? Is he still taking bribes? What a delightful scamp.</p><p>A small hand rested on his shoulder. \u201cYou look distant, my dear.\u201d</p><p>He bowed his head slightly. \u201cApologies, Your Grace.\u201d</p><p>The woman next to him frowned with her eyes. Her face remained perfectly pleasant. Her Grace Olivia Camarine wore a gown of deep regal purple. The theme of the festival was nature and rebirth, a celebration of spring, and the hue of her dress precisely matched the clusters of widow\u2019s tear flowers spilling from the planters. Her dark hair was put away into a tasteful arrangement. In her late fifties, she looked twenty years younger, and despite her age and a life that was more than trying, she remained beautiful. She was Declan\u2019s mother, and she had stepped into the role of George\u2019s grandmother as soon as Jack and he arrived in the Edge. That role had been officially chiseled into stone when Declan and Rose formally adopted him and Jack.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t let them trouble you,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cThey don\u2019t.\u201d He felt a rush of gratitude. Many of the people gathered here would never let him forget that he came from the Edge. Very few of them dared to recall that Her Grace\u2019s mother was an Edge rat just like him. She was above reproach by virtue of her position and success, but he was still a fair target. \u201cI know their secrets.\u201d</p><p>She raised her eyebrows. \u201cGloating?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly a little.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee that it doesn\u2019t go to your head.\u201d</p><p>He bent toward her and smiled. \u201cToo late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGeorge, you are a terrible scoundrel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLady Virai wouldn\u2019t have me otherwise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is, sadly, true.\u201d</p> <p>The fact that his direct supervisor and the woman in charge of the Mirror was Her Grace\u2019s best friend occasionally made his life complicated, but he\u2019d learned to deal with it.</p><p>Lady Olivia\u2019s dark eyes sparked. \u201cShall we start our little game?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs you wish.\u201d</p><p>Her Grace slipped the bracelet off and slid it onto her right wrist. Immediately, the current of the crowd changed. Small eddies formed as the nearest lords and ladies found graceful ways to disengage from their conversations in favor of greeting the Duchess of the Southern Provinces.</p><p>Lady Olivia hid her amusement in a placid half smile. He hadn\u2019t been present when she met Charlotte, but since then he\u2019d had plenty of chances to observe the two of them. Lady Olivia had liked Charlotte instantly. It was very clear that they were two birds of a feather\u2014neither was born into a blueblood line and both had attained the pinnacle of social achievement. They were astute, adept, and intelligent, and listening to them he had felt slightly out of his depth.</p><p>People approached. He uttered pleasantries, making them sound as if he meant them. About ten minutes later, with the crowd at its peak, Lady Olivia turned to him.</p><p>\u201cGeorge, have you seen her yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, my lady.\u201d He could see the question form on the faces around them.</p><p>\u201cShe did say she intended to attend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, my lady. You made it very clear to her that she would suffer your wrath otherwise.\u201d</p><p>Lady Olivia heaved a martyred sigh. \u201cI\u2019m really not that frightening.\u201d</p><p>Nobody laughed. History was a required subject for anyone hoping to achieve any significant position in Adrianglia, and every person within earshot knew about the massacre that ended the Ten Day War between the Dukedom of Louisiana and Adrianglia and who was responsible for it.</p><p>\u201cDo check on her for me,\u201d Her Grace prompted.</p><p>George bowed his head. A falcon shot upward from its post on the nearest column and streaked away, in the direction of front gate. He concentrated, looking through the bird\u2019s eyes at the string of phaetons. There, latest model, delicate ornamentation, Sophie\u2019s face in the window.</p><p>He left the bird soaring. \u201cYour Grace, they are about to arrive. Ten minutes at most.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDelightful. Thank you, my boy.\u201d</p><p>He slid back into his affectation of boredom, surveying the faces, noting the minute details, as people pulled on polite masks, frantically trying to figure out who was the subject of their conversation. A tall, dark-haired man paused on the periphery of the gathering. Lord Casside. A member of the Five. It didn\u2019t seem like his type of affair. He must\u2019ve gotten a personal invitation from someone he couldn\u2019t ignore . . .</p><p>George caught himself. Not Casside. Richard.</p><p>He had watched through the eyes of a bat when, two nights ago, Richard\u2019s people grabbed Casside off the dark street. He\u2019d left a club where he\u2019d fenced with his usual partner, turned the corner on the dark street, heading to his phaeton, and three men jumped him. They sealed his mouth, brought him down, thrust a bag over his head, and yanked him into the dark archway. A moment later, Richard strode out onto the street, dressed in exactly the same clothes, walking at exactly the same speed. He walked over to the phaeton, got in, and rode off. George knew this, but when he looked at the lean man across the terrace, his mind didn\u2019t say Richard. It said, \u201cCasside,\u201d and insisted on it.</p><p>It had to be some sort of subtle magic, George decided. One of those secret talents the Edgers hid from everyone.</p><p>Richard glanced in their direction, looking bored.</p><p>CHARLOTTE paused before the entrance to the terrace. Through the doors she could see the gathering: the people, the clothes, the jewels . . . An electric zing of excitement dashed through her. She had done this dozens of times, but that preappearance rush never got old.</p><p>Sophie stepped forward and passed a small card with their names and titles to the crier. The man took it, and the child moved back to her place next to Charlotte. She looked a shade paler than when they had exited the phaeton. Poor kid.</p><p>Charlotte wrapped her arm around Sophie\u2019s shoulders. \u201cIt will be fine,\u201d she murmured. \u201cBreathe and hold your head high. Remember\u2014poise. You belong here. It\u2019s your right to be here.\u201d</p><p>Sophie swallowed.</p><p>\u201cBaroness Charlotte de Ney al-te Ran and Sophie al-te Mua,\u201d the crier announced.</p><p>\u201cHERE she is,\u201d Lady Olivia exclaimed.</p><p>Every head at their side of the terrace turned to the entrance. Charlotte stepped through, and George blinked. She wore a shimmering gown of delicate blue. It hugged her body. It really hugged her body, showcasing every curve before it flared into a flowing skirt that fell to the floor, and he felt vaguely embarrassed for looking. The top of the dress featured strips of brown fabric that narrowed on the side and spread across the blue skirt, imitating thin, twisted, apple branches. White blossoms, accented with silver, bloomed on the branches. The silhouette was simple, yet the color, the cut, and the pattern combined into an elegant, refined whole, and Charlotte, with her pale blond hair and gray eyes, floated in it, like the queen of spring.</p><p>He could almost hear a barely audible collective gasp from a dozen women who realized they had just been upstaged. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>George chanced a glance at Richard. The man stood very still, his gaze fixed on Charlotte as she walked across the floor, and despite his new face, in that moment Richard looked nothing like Casside. A mix of emotions reflected on his face, desperation, passion, longing. It lasted for half a moment and looked like torture, then Richard slipped back into Casside, the way one put on a shirt in the morning. He must miss her.</p><p>George glanced back at Charlotte and forgot to breathe. Three steps behind her, to the left, Sophie walked across the terrace.</p><p>The world took a step back.</p> <p>She wore a flowing gown of a pale gray with a touch of blue, draped at the top, caught by a sash, then floating in a weightless long skirt. He\u2019d seen that precise color when she unsheathed her sword. The dress shimmered as she walked, slick and fluid, as if the metal of her blade had come to life and streamed over her like liquid, shifting with every movement.</p><p>He saw the graceful lines of her neck.</p><p>He saw her dark hair and a single pale blue flower in it.</p><p>He saw her face.</p><p>She was beautiful.</p> <p>He realized he was standing there like an idiot, with his mouth hanging open, and clamped it shut.</p><p>A moment later, Charlotte joined them. Her Grace hugged her, gently. \u201cMy dear, I had almost given up hope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t disappoint you if it is at all in my power.\u201d Charlotte smiled.</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019ve brought Sophie.\u201d Her Grace opened her arms, and Sophie hugged her. \u201cHow can you hide this beautiful flower in that country house of yours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe country is where the flowers bloom the best,\u201d Charlotte replied.</p><p>\u201cOh please.\u201d Lady Olivia made a dismissive gesture that could\u2019ve done a premier dancer proud. \u201cIt\u2019s about time for the child to see the wider world.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cExcuse me, Lord Camarine?\u201d</p><p>A singsong female voice tugged on him. George turned. Lady Angelia Ermine stood next to him, wearing a fishtail gown of light powder blue. Her caramel golden hair cascaded in a tumble of locks on her left side, drawing attention to her delicate shoulders and long neck. She was quite attractive, George reflected in a detached way. She also profited from the sale of slave women and robbed them of their future children.</p><p>Her escort, a well-groomed, elegant blond man in a tailored russet doublet smiled at him with a sardonic spark in his eyes\u2014Baron Rene, Spider\u2019s cousin. He seemed perfectly at ease and enjoying himself. Two of the Five for the price of one.</p><p>George smiled. \u201cMay I help you, my lady?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you happen to know Lady de Ney?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve only met her casually. I understand she has a very rare talent. Her Grace holds her in the highest regard. Some sort of family favor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer dress is divine,\u201d Baron Rene volunteered. He was looking at Charlotte with a distinctly male appreciation.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s probably one of her own designs,\u201d George said, keeping his voice light. \u201cWould you like an introduction?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI suppose we can spare a moment or two.\u201d Angelia shrugged.</p><p>She was clearly dying to be introduced. George stepped to the side, waited until Her Grace leaned over to Sophie, and caught Charlotte\u2019s gaze. \u201cMy lady, Lady Angelia Ermine and Baron Rene.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte smiled. \u201cA pleasure.\u201d</p><p>Baron Rene bowed, bringing Charlotte\u2019s fingers to his lips. As he bent, George caught sight of Richard\u2019s face. His expression was so perfectly placid, so even, it was slightly alarming.</p><p>Baron Rene straightened. Charlotte and Angelia touched the back of their hands to each other. As their skin connected, a tiny tendril of black shot from Charlotte\u2019s hand to Angelia\u2019s. If he wasn\u2019t looking closely, he would\u2019ve missed it.</p><p>The two bluebloods said a few more words about the festival and weather and disengaged.</p><p>The center of the terrace rumbled. That\u2019s right, he realized, it was almost dark.</p><p>The tiles in the middle slid aside. Magic surged in a translucent wall, forming a tall column. Inside it something sparked. Flames burst, roaring upward at the sky, perfectly contained by magic\u2014a perfect imitation of an ancient bonfire.</p><p>The bluebloods applauded. He clapped with them, watching Charlotte and Sophie out of the corner of his eye. The ground was prepared. It was up to Charlotte to set her trap.</p><p>TIRED, Charlotte descended the staircase from the front entrance where their rented phaeton waited, the driver holding the door open. Sophie walked next to her. They conquered the last few steps, got inside, and sank onto the soft cushions of the seats. The driver shut the door, and, a moment later, they were off.</p><p>Charlotte pulled her shoes off and thrust her feet onto the opposite seat. Across from her, Sophie groaned and did the same. They wiggled their toes at each other.</p><p>\u201cOw, ow, ow.\u201d Sophie bent forward and massaged her toes. \u201cWhy do the heels have to be so high?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst, because they elongate your calves and make your legs look leaner. Second, because you couldn\u2019t possibly do any work in shoes like this, so if you own them, you must live a life of leisure.\u201d Charlotte leaned back. \u201cAll in all, it went very well. We owe Lady Olivia a favor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you give Angelia?\u201d Sophie asked.</p><p>Charlotte grinned. \u201cYou saw that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was looking very carefully.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was already infected with Dock Rot, a very strong, virulent form of herpes. I just coaxed it into an outbreak.\u201d</p><p>Sophie\u2019s eyes went wide. \u201cIs that one of the sexual diseases?\u201d</p><p>Charlotte nodded. \u201cOh yes. They call it Dock Rot because it\u2019s often found among port prostitutes. It\u2019s curable, but the regimen is long and expensive, and it\u2019s quite easily preventable through the use of the male sleeve and vaccination.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo why wasn\u2019t she vaccinated?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably because it didn\u2019t occur to her that she might catch it. The question is how did a blueblood flower such as Angelia end up with a dock-prostitute rash?\u201d</p><p>Sophie grinned. \u201cThat\u2019s an interesting question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it?\u201d Charlotte rubbed her hands together. \u201cI think we\u2019re going to contact Lady Olivia and make sure Angelia gets an invitation to a tea. Mmmmm, about two days should do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re scary,\u201d Sophie told her.</p><p>You have no idea, sweetheart. You have no idea. \u201cYes, but I\u2019m on your side.\u201d Charlotte reached over and squeezed Sophie\u2019s hand. \u201cYou did so well today. It will get easier, I promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was . . . exciting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so glad.\u201d Charlotte grinned. \u201cDid you notice George?\u201d</p><p>Sophie leaned against the back of the seat. \u201cI know! He is so perfect, it\u2019s sickening.\u201d Her eyes grew wide. \u201cThat woman next to me, the one with the green rose in her hair? She leaned over to the other lady, and she said, \u2018I bet I could teach him a thing or two.\u2019 And the other woman said, \u2018He\u2019s just a boy,\u2019 and the green rose woman said, \u2018That\u2019s the best time in a man\u2019s life: they\u2019re easy to steer, and they can go and go and go.\u2019 Can you believe that? She must be thirty! It\u2019s disgusting.\u201d</p><p>Sophie stuck her tongue out and made a retching noise.</p><p>Charlotte smiled. \u201cI don\u2019t think George is in any danger. He does the distant, I\u2019m-above-it-all impression quite well, and the duchess would fry anyone who looked at him the wrong way.\u201d</p><p>Sophie\u2019s dark eyes turned serious. \u201cIs that how it\u2019s supposed to be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it how what\u2019s supposed to be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre we supposed to be obsessed with sex?\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d asked it quietly, and Charlotte sensed the answer was very important. \u201cIt depends on the woman. We\u2019re not all cut from the same cloth. Some women mature faster, some slower; some actively seek out sexual pleasure, and some don\u2019t value it as much. Why do you ask?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to do it.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte tilted her head, trying to get a better look at Sophie\u2019s face. \u201cWhich part?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to have sex,\u201d Sophie said. \u201cMaybe later. But not now. I have friends. They kiss each other. The boys are . . . you know. Hands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMhm.\u201d Charlotte nodded.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like to be touched. One of them tried, and I told him I didn\u2019t like it. He acted as if there was something wrong with me.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte paused. There was so much she wanted to explain, but the little bond of trust they had between them was so fragile. She had to find the right words.</p><p>\u201cThere is nothing wrong with you. Your body belongs to you alone. Touching it is a privilege, and it\u2019s up to you to grant it. Some boys\u2014and men\u2014don\u2019t handle rejection well, and they will try to shame you or pressure you into letting them do what they want because they feel entitled. They\u2019re not worth your time. Also, there is nothing wrong with not enjoying sexual touching or kissing. For some girls, their sexual awakening comes early, for some, later. I was almost seventeen before I became aware of men sexually, and even then, it was because of a particular boy I liked rather than men in general.\u201d</p><p>Sophie looked out the window.</p><p>Charlotte couldn\u2019t tell if she had said the right thing or the wrong thing. This is what parenting must be like. The duchess was right. Never knowing if you had done harm or good was awful.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Sophie said. \u201cIt\u2019s just that I don\u2019t have anybody else to ask. My sister is gone a lot with William. My aunts always want to know who is it and what\u2019s his name. And I can\u2019t ask Richard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh gods, no, don\u2019t ask Richard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe would be scandalized.\u201d Sophie pressed her lips together, as if trying to hold something back.</p><p>\u201cIf he gets an idea that someone tried to touch you against your will, he\u2019d kill them.\u201d Charlotte cleared her throat and tried to produce a reasonable imitation of Richard\u2019s raspy voice. \u201cI\u2019m going to decapitate that ruffian. Please don\u2019t hold dinner. No need to trouble yourself on my account.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sophie squeezed her lips tighter, but the laughter burst out anyway. \u201cHe would say that! \u2018I shall bring you his head. You may use his skull as a vase. No use in wasting a perfectly good cranium.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Charlotte giggled. \u201cWe\u2019re so morbid.\u201d</p><p>They giggled again. Sophie tried to hold it in and snorted. \u201cOh no, I\u2019m so unladylike.\u201d</p> <p>That only made them laugh harder.</p><p>Finally, they stopped.</p><p>\u201cYou can ask me anything,\u201d Charlotte said. \u201cI don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happens next?\u201d Sophie asked.</p><p>\u201cTomorrow, Richard is going to the club for his weekly card game. It\u2019s possible that Brennan will be there.\u201d Charlotte\u2019s heart skipped a beat. There was no danger, she reassured herself. Richard had fooled everyone, except for the old house servant, whom he had replaced. The real Casside and his servant were now safely tucked away in one of Declan\u2019s dungeons. The chance that Brennan would realize that Richard was an impostor was very slight.</p> <p>Very, very slight.</p><p>\u201cSo what then?\u201d Sophie asked.</p><p>\u201cThen we will make Brennan think he\u2019s being betrayed.\u201d</p><p>RICHARD sat at a pentagonal table and reviewed his cards. He had the winning hand. He surveyed the faces of the four other men at the table. Much like the Broken\u2019s poker, the Weird\u2019s council was a game of strategy and bluffing. He\u2019d learned to count cards when he was barely old enough to understand the game. It required a good memory and paying attention. Child\u2019s play.</p><p>To his right, Lord Korban frowned slightly, trying to hide his tells. Next to him, Robert Brennan smiled at Richard from above his cards. The man was unconcerned and completely at ease, as if relaxing at home. He didn\u2019t look like the man whose island slave operation had turned to ash a week and a half ago.</p><p>Lorameh, a veteran of the air force, sat next to Brennan. As a human being, Lorameh was thoroughly unremarkable: pale blond hair gathered into a ponytail at the nape of his neck, light eyes, neither handsome nor unattractive. He\u2019d known Brennan for a long time, and the two of them treated each other with easy familiarity.</p> <p>At Lorameh\u2019s side, Maedoc, his severe gaze fixed on the cards, completed the circle. Where Brennan was carefree, Maedoc reviewed his cards with a deadly serious air, as if the fate of the realm rode on his winning hand.</p><p>If Richard called a challenge, Lorameh would fold, Korban would panic and go in, then change his mind and fold at the first opportunity. Maedoc would stubbornly hold, because although his hand was mediocre, he viewed surrender as the weakest of the options. Brennan . . . His hand was weak, but Brennan was an enigma.</p><p>\u201cChallenge,\u201d Richard said.</p><p>\u201cAccepted.\u201d Korban slid a coin toward the stack of gold in the center of the table.</p><p>\u201cWithdraw.\u201d Lorameh tossed his cards down. \u201cToo rich for my taste.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAccepted,\u201d Brennan said, adding his own doubloon. The corner of his mouth curved.</p><p>\u201cAccepted,\u201d Maedoc growled.</p><p>\u201cLiving dangerously, Robert,\u201d Lorameh said.</p> <p>\u201cDanger adds spice to a mundane existence,\u201d Brennan said.</p><p>\u201cYou just took a voyage to the Southeast Coast, while I slave away at my desk,\u201d Lorameh said. \u201cOf the two of us, my existence is much more mundane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was visiting a friend,\u201d Brennan said.</p><p>\u201cA friend with soft curves and beautiful blue eyes perhaps?\u201d Lorameh asked.</p><p>\u201cA lord never tells. Your play, Casside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChallenge,\u201d Richard said again, and slid a gold coin into the center of the table. There had been a very slight note of command in Brennan\u2019s voice. Brennan had also counted the cards. He knew exactly what sort of hand Richard had. Where was he going with this plan?</p><p>\u201cWithdraw!\u201d Korban dropped his cards.</p><p>\u201cAccepted.\u201d Brennan added more money.</p><p>Maedoc hesitated.</p><p>\u201cOur brave soldier is thinking of surrendering,\u201d Brennan said.</p><p>A light laughter rolled around the table. Richard allowed himself a sparse smile to not stand out.</p><p>Maedoc\u2019s face turned redder. He slid another coin to the stack. \u201cAccepted.\u201d</p><p>What was going on? Richard sorted through the available responses. Casside would keep playing. He was driven by money, and the hoard of gold on the table was substantial. \u201cChallenge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnother challenge, Casside?\u201d Brennan looked directly at him. \u201cYou should make it a big one.\u201d</p><p>His tone was mild, but his stare left no doubt\u2014it was an order.</p><p>\u201cVery well.\u201d Richard slid the entirety of his coins into the center of the table.</p><p>Lorameh whistled quietly. Korban turned a shade paler.</p><p>\u201cAccepted,\u201d Brennan said. He pushed a tower of coins to the center with a careless sweep of his hand and turned to Maedoc.</p><p>Punishment, Richard realized. Maedoc was being punished for the failure of the slavers on the island. He oversaw the slaver muscle. The breach in security was Maedoc\u2019s fault, and now Brennan was publicly humiliating him.</p><p>The big man looked back at Brennan, his teeth clenched.</p><p>\u201cAre you with us or against us, Maedoc?\u201d Brennan asked.</p><p>The muscles on Maedoc\u2019s jaws bulged. He stared at the coins. Of the Five, he was the least wealthy. Both Brennan and Casside had means, but for the other three bluebloods, the lack of funds was a real danger.</p><p>The strain on Maedoc\u2019s face was clearly visible. Richard felt no sympathy for him. The memory of rain-drenched holes filled with children, of the boy with his lips sewn shut, and barely human slaves was too fresh.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d Brennan tapped the table.</p><p>\u201cWith you.\u201d Maedoc shoved the gold forward.</p><p>\u201cYour move,\u201d Brennan looked at Richard.</p><p>\u201cTriple Royal Charge.\u201d Richard dropped a king, three knights, and an archer on the table.</p><p>Maedoc\u2019s face turned purple. \u201cDouble charge,\u201d he croaked, and let the cards fall. Two knights, a squire, a page, and a blacksmith.</p><p>\u201cTwo pages, two squires, and a carpenter.\u201d Brennan spread the cards on the table. \u201cYou win, Casside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the lousiest hand,\u201d Korban said.</p><p>\u201cLuck of the draw.\u201d Brennan grinned.</p><p>He rose and slid the money toward Richard. \u201cTake it before we change our minds.\u201d</p><p>Maedoc looked ripe for apoplexy. Richard hid a smile. It said volumes about his own morality, but anything that hurt the Five brought him joy.</p><p>Lorameh had an odd look on his face\u2014he wasn\u2019t sure what had just happened, but he didn\u2019t like it.</p><p>\u201cI think I shall take my winnings home.\u201d Richard swept the coins into a bag.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll join you.\u201d Brennan rose.</p><p>They walked out of the club into the night. It had rained. Dampness hung in the air, and rainwater pooled in the uneven cobbles under their feet. The club occupied one of the restored buildings of Carver Castle, and the narrow street curved, snaking its way through the tangle of buildings that had once housed servants, knights, and soldiers. Here and there, magic lanterns cascaded from the walls, their pale lights diluting the darkness rather than banishing it.</p><p>\u201cYou played rather aggressively tonight,\u201d Brennan said.</p><p>What would Casside say? \u201cI dislike losing money.\u201d</p><p>Brennan grimaced. \u201cWe have all just lost a great deal of money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow fast can the enterprise be rebuilt?\u201d Richard asked.</p><p>\u201cThe efforts are under way now. Six months.\u201d Brennan\u2019s face jerked. An ugly scowl distorted his features, as if the fury inside him struggled to tear through the paper-thin mask of his easygoing demeanor. The man had a temper. Richard filed it away for future reference. \u201cIt was the Hunter. Three hundred men and a yearlong hunt, yet they can\u2019t kill one man.\u201d</p><p>The irony was too rich. It was time to carefully push Brennan in the right direction. \u201cOne wonders why.\u201d</p><p>Brennan pivoted on one foot toward him. \u201cWhat are you implying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI find it odd that these three hundred men can find a set of twins of particular age and coloring but can\u2019t find the Hunter.\u201d</p><p>The passageway widened, circling the main keep. A few moments and they would pass through the arched gate and reach the main courtyard and their phaetons.</p><p>Something moved in the darkness by the arch.</p><p>Brennan halted. Richard put his hand on his rapier. Casside was a skilled fencer\u2014like many bluebloods, he had a proper martial education. The slender sword wasn\u2019t Richard\u2019s preferred weapon, and being divorced from his magic hindered him. Casside couldn\u2019t stretch his flash onto his sword. It was a lost art, known by a select few. And now that he was Casside, Richard would have to make do without it.</p><p>People moved within the arch, ink black silhouettes in darkness.</p><p>Brennan raised his head. \u201cWhat have we here?\u201d</p><p>Arrows whistled through the air. Brennan\u2019s magic sparked, bursting from him in a brilliant white flash shield, disintegrating the missiles.</p><p>A bright blue flash shot from behind them, threatening to cut Brennan in half. Richard shoved him out of the way. The flash scorched the cobbles between them.</p><p>Richard dashed into the darkness in the direction of the flash, his rapier bare, counting under his breath. One, two, three, four. Another bolt of blue lightning tore at him. The flasher needed four seconds to recharge. The most accomplished magic users could do it instantly, but most needed time to refocus their magic.</p><p>Richard dodged, and the magic scoured the cobbles. The flasher gave himself away. He saw them now, three people waiting in the alcove to the left\u2014the magic user and two fighters.</p><p>Richard charged. One.</p><p>The fighter on the left, a lean, agile woman, struck at him, spinning, her twin wide swords slicing like a razor-sharp tornado. He dodged left, right, left again. Two. The bigger sword grazed his chest, cutting through the doublet. Steel burned his skin.</p><p>Three.</p><p>The woman pressed her advantage.</p><p>Four. He dodged right, avoiding the flash by a mere second, lunged, and smiled as the tip of his rapier burst his opponent\u2019s heart. The woman fell. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>One. The large man behind her leaped, taking her place, chopping at him with a vicious short axe. Two. Three. Richard backed away. Four. His instincts screamed, and he dived left, half a second before another flash bolt cut a gash in the stone wall behind him.</p><p>The axe fighter smashed into him, knocking him off-balance. Too close for a lunge. Richard veered left, grabbed the axe fighter\u2019s right arm, yanking him forward, and smashed the heavy hilt of the rapier into his left eye. The man howled in pain. Three. Richard spun him around and shoved him forward. The flash tore into the axe fighter. The stench of smoking human meat filled the air.</p><p>Richard sprinted, putting all of his speed in the run. Time slowed down, stretching like viscous honey.</p> <p>He saw the magic user, a short, overweight woman. Slowly, as if underwater, she opened her mouth, raising her arms. The first brilliant blue spark of the flash formed between her fingers, biting at her skin with roots of lightning.</p><p>He thrust.</p><p>The blade passed under the growing tangle of magic, under the woman\u2019s left breast and into her lung. He\u2019d missed the heart by a hair.</p><p>Richard threw himself left. The magic tore from her in a wide beam. She tried to scream, but the words gurgled in her throat. He dropped the rapier, grabbed her from the side, and snapped her neck with a quick jerk.</p><p>It cost him half a second to recover his sword. Richard dashed back. When he\u2019d sent Garett, his cousin, to hire the thugs to kill Brennan, he warned him to hire enough to make a serious statement but not so many that Brennan would be overwhelmed. As satisfying as it would feel, Brennan couldn\u2019t die. But Richard had never counted on a flasher or a skilled swordsmen. There was a slight chance that they could actually succeed, and their scheme would fall apart before it had even begun.</p> <p>He rounded the bend. Brennan bent over a prone man, breathing hard, his face an ugly, feral mask. A thick drip of bright red blood spilled from his scalp onto his face. Three bodies sprawled on the cobbles. None of them moved.</p><p>Brennan clutched a man by his shirt and stabbed him.</p><p>The man cried out.</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d Brennan demand, his voice a ragged growl. \u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d the man groaned.</p><p>Brennan twisted the dagger in the wound. \u201cWho?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cKordon said . . .\u201d The man\u2019s voice was fading. \u201cHe said . . . it was . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Brennan yanked him higher.</p><p>\u201cEagle,\u201d the man whispered. His eyes rolled back in his skull. His body convulsed once, and he sagged in Brennan\u2019s grip. The king\u2019s cousin stared at the limp body, his eyes bulging. He looked deranged. Then the anger vanished, and Brennan pulled his composure back on like a mask.</p><p>\u201cRobert!\u201d Richard sank force into his whisper. \u201cWe must leave. There will be questions.\u201d</p><p>Brennan let go of the corpse, dusted his hands, and strode into the arched tunnel, his pace brisk. \u201cDid you bring a phaeton?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll ride in it, then. Can your servants be trusted?\u201d</p><p>Richard hid a smile. He had replaced all of the staff in the house with his family. There wasn\u2019t a single person in that house whose name wasn\u2019t Mar. \u201cImplicitly.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>The arch ended, opening into a well-lit courtyard filled with phaetons and horses. Richard stopped, pulled a handkerchief from his clothes, and thrust it at Brennan. \u201cBlood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Brennan pressed the cloth over the blood. They crossed the space quickly. Richard opened the door of the phaeton, and Brennan ducked inside on the wide bench. Richard climbed in after him and let his fingers fly over the controls. The ornate panel buzzed, the gears began turning, and the phaeton whirred to life. He drove out of the courtyard, maintaining average speed.</p><p>Seven lives were lost. They belonged to professional killers. He felt no guilt but a vague dissatisfaction. Some part of him must\u2019ve secretly hoped Brennan would die.</p><p>Brennan wiped the blood off his scalp. \u201cWell! That was more fun than I\u2019ve had in a while. How about you?\u201d</p><p>Richard sorted through Casside\u2019s possible responses. \u201cYou have a strange idea of fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou always were a cautious man, Casside.\u201d Brennan gave his shoulder a friendly punch. \u201cCome on. You must\u2019ve felt alive there for a few minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was keenly aware that I was alive. I wanted to stay that way, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you did. All that fencing paid off. Don\u2019t fret, Casside. You weren\u2019t the target. They went straight for me.\u201d Brennan grinned that infectious smile that made him famous. \u201cA shame they didn\u2019t provide more of a challenge.\u201d</p><p>If Richard didn\u2019t have irrefutable evidence that Brennan was responsible for hundreds of broken lives, he could\u2019ve imagined that he might have liked this man.</p><p>In ten minutes, Richard parked in front of Casside\u2019s mansion and ushered Brennan inside. Orena, his second cousin, met them in a foyer, saw Brennan bleeding, and made big eyes. \u201cAlcohol, salve, rags,\u201d Richard told her. \u201cQuickly.\u201d</p><p>Brennan winked at the woman. \u201cIs he always so demanding?\u201d</p><p>Orena bowed her head and escaped.</p><p>\u201cYour people are very serious, Casside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve known my family for a long time. They don\u2019t take their duties lightly.\u201d Richard led Brennan into the study. Orena reappeared with medical supplies, followed by Aunt Pete.</p><p>\u201cThey are both trained surgeons,\u201d Richard assured Brennan.</p><p>Brennan leaned back, offering the gash on his forehead to Orena. \u201cDo you think you can make me pretty again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, my lord.\u201d</p><p>In ten minutes, the gash on Brennan\u2019s head was washed, disinfected, and sewn up. His own wound required only dressing and some butterfly bandages. The women departed, taking bloody rags with them.</p><p>Richard slumped in a chair. \u201cI abhor violence.\u201d</p><p>Brennan looked at him. \u201cDon\u2019t we all, my friend? Don\u2019t we all.\u201d</p><p>Richard nodded. Casside had never sought military service, a fact Brennan likely knew. He reached for a pitcher filled with red tea and made his hand tremble as he poured it into the glass. The glass spout of the pitcher knocked against the rim of the glass.</p><p>Brennan rose. \u201cLet me do that.\u201d He took the pitcher from him and filled two glasses.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Richard gulped his drink.</p><p>\u201cIt really took the wind out of your sails?\u201d Brennan watched him carefully.</p><p>\u201cNot at all,\u201d Richard said, making an obvious effort to keep the glass steady. \u201cI just want to know who and why. What in the world is the \u2018eagle\u2019?\u201d</p><p>Brennan drank from his glass and studied it. \u201cGood tea. The eagle is on Maedoc\u2019s family crest. His father was known as the White Eagle. Maedoc, in his own time, was called the Dark Eagle. His son, provided he chooses a military career like the four generations before him, will be some sort of eagle as well. Beautiful tradition, isn\u2019t it? There is a subtle elegance in the old blueblood lines.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaedoc?\u201d Richard raised his eyebrows. \u201cI suppose he knew exactly where you would be. I\u2019m sure losing the money hit him hard, but murder? Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA bid for power, perhaps.\u201d Brennan turned the glass right, then left, studying the play of light in the raspberry red tea. \u201cHe might have grown tired of my leadership. The attack on the island destabilized our little enterprise. It would be an excellent time to make a bid for the new head wolf, and he means to take my place.\u201d</p><p>Beautiful. Richard leaned forward. Brennan had taken the bait, hook, line, and sinker. \u201cMaedoc can\u2019t run this operation. He knows it. Not only that, but the three of us wouldn\u2019t stand for it.\u201d</p><p>Brennan furrowed his eyebrows. \u201cPlease. Rene hates Adrianglia for holding him back. He doesn\u2019t care who\u2019s in charge as long as he\u2019s permitted to profit from thrusting a stick into our realm\u2019s gear. Angelia is a twisted creature; she will follow whoever hands her the biggest diamond and whispers sweet nothings in her ears while pouring coin into her purse. And you, well, you seek the money. You\u2019re for sale, my friend. That\u2019s how I got you in the first place. I\u2019m too old for illusions\u2014friendship and loyalty are fine qualities, but the voice of ethics grows weak in the face of riches.\u201d</p><p>The plan hinged on throwing suspicion on the retired general. Both Rene and Angelia were too weak for Brennan to ever see them as a true threat. Of all of them, only Maedoc could pose a serious challenge to Brennan\u2019s rule of the slaver trade, and Brennan had to view the threat as significant or it wouldn\u2019t topple him off-balance.</p><p>\u201cMaedoc was in charge of the security of the island,\u201d Richard thought out loud.</p><p>Brennan gave him a sharp glance. Icy and calculating, that stare gripped Richard and for a second he felt the same calm that descended on him when he faced a fighter with a naked blade glaring at him from across three feet of open ground.</p><p>Inside Richard\u2019s head, an alarm wailed. Careful. Careful, now. Don\u2019t be too obvious.</p><p>\u201cDo you know how the island was sacked?\u201d</p><p>Yes or no? What was the right answer? \u201cNot the particulars.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe bandits pretended to be slaves and commandeered our ship. Drayton, that moron, must\u2019ve let them right on board. They sent all the right signals and were permitted to enter the harbor and dock in plain view of the fort. Witnesses say that a crew of slaves began to disembark. They slaughtered the slavers meeting them and spread through the island, hitting precise targets. One group attacked the fort, the next hit the barracks, the third opened the slave pens. Beautiful, isn\u2019t it? Daring. Imaginative. Risky.\u201d</p><p>Brennan paused, offering him an opportunity to make a contribution. It was a trap. It had to be a trap. He was watching him too closely. He needed a neutral answer. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to admire them knowing how much money we stand to lose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDivorce yourself from finances for a moment. Think of the brazen elegance of it. This raid is everything Maedoc is not. Oh, he\u2019s hailed as a brilliant tactician, but I\u2019ve studied his military record. Maedoc is a bull, my friend. He sees the target and plows toward it. Deception and sleight of hand are quite beyond him. If he wanted to replace me, he would\u2019ve attacked me directly. Not only that, but why would he identify himself as the Eagle? Why not simply make up a name? In fact, why give a name at all? Those were contract killers; their bargains are simple: money for a life, their quarry or their own.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Brennan didn\u2019t buy Maedoc\u2019s treason. Richard\u2019s disappointment was so sharp he could taste it. He buried it, in the same deep place he buried his guilt and memories. Nothing could show on his face. He had hoped to spare Charlotte from getting involved, but Brennan was too logical and too cautious. She would have to implement her part of the plan. Damn it.</p><p>Brennan took a deep gulp of the tea. \u201cNo, this matter is a lot more complicated. The mind that conceived the raid is likely the same mind that would cash in on the ripples it would cause. That person would seek to utilize my weakness to his or her advantage. We know that this person is deceitful and sly. This person would have considered the possibility of failure and would take precautions to point the finger at someone other than themselves. Therefore, the culprit can\u2019t be Maedoc. It\u2019s simply too obvious, even for him. No, it\u2019s one of you\u2014Rene, Angelia, or perhaps even you, my friend.\u201d</p><p>Richard sat the glass down. \u201cWhat are you implying?\u201d</p> <p>Brennan grinned, another charming smile. \u201cOh, relax, Casside. You\u2019re at the very bottom of my suspect list. I don\u2019t believe platitudes or assurances of loyalty, but I do believe that tremor in your hand. You simply don\u2019t have the guts for it. You wouldn\u2019t have put your own life in danger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m inclined to take that as an insult.\u201d Richard stood up from his chair.</p><p>Brennan sighed. \u201cOh, do sit down. You\u2019re brave enough. I\u2019m not impugning your courage. You can\u2019t help the simple biological reaction of your body. The point is, we have a traitor in our midst. I intend to find them out.\u201d</p><p>He smiled.</p><p>\u201cThis is so much fun, Casside. And here I was planning to be bored.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI will take boredom instead of this, thank you. Are you tired? You\u2019re welcome to stay the night.\u201d</p><p>Brennan waved his hand. \u201cNo. I need night, wind, life. A woman. Perhaps I\u2019ll pay Angelia a visit although she really is too much trouble. She enjoys being coaxed, and I\u2019m not inclined to bother. Do you ever go slumming?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should.\u201d Brennan\u2019s face took on a dreamy quality. \u201cIt\u2019s good for the body and occasionally the soul. There is a wonderful place down in the Lower Quarter. They call it the Palace of Delights. Ask for Miranda.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet my people take you home. Head wounds sometimes have hidden consequences. Robert, don\u2019t gamble with your health. We don\u2019t know how many of them there are. Perhaps there is another group . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, fine.\u201d Brennan waved his hand. \u201cRuin all my fun.\u201d</p> <p>Richard rose. \u201cI\u2019ll tell them to have the phaeton ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCasside?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t forget what you\u2019ve done for me today,\u201d Brennan said.</p><p>\u201cWhat would you have me do?\u201d Richard asked.</p><p>\u201cAct normal. Nothing out of the ordinary. I\u2019ll call on you when I\u2019m ready. This promises to be a brilliant game, and I intend to enjoy every moment of it.\u201d</p><p>FOURTEEN</p><p>CHARLOTTE sat across from Angelia Ermine and watched the other woman attempt to ignore the burning itching under her lacy Sud-style tunic. They sat on a verandah of Lady Olivia\u2019s city house, at a delicate table carved out of a solid piece of crystal. The table bore a dozen desserts and three different teas, which the six other women present at the gathering seemed to be enjoying. What Angelia would\u2019ve enjoyed most of all would be a good scratch, possibly with some fine-grade sandpaper. Unfortunately for her, Her Grace was telling a charming story from her past, and the half dozen other attendees hung on her every word. Excusing herself wasn\u2019t an option.</p> <p>\u201cAnd then I told him that if he was going to stoop to that level of rudeness, I would be forced to retaliate . . .\u201d Her Grace appeared completely engrossed in her anecdote, except for the occasional brief glance in Charlotte\u2019s direction.</p><p>The itching must\u2019ve reached torturous levels, because Angelia gave up on maintaining an attentive facade and locked her teeth. Sweat broke out on her forehead. Her disease had reached its peak, and Charlotte had been quietly spurring it on. Any other woman would\u2019ve sent her apologies and stayed home, but Angelia was too much of a social climber. She was a minor blueblood, her bloodline undistinguished, her achievements mediocre, and a tea with the Duchess of the Southern Provinces was a lure she couldn\u2019t ignore.</p><p>Charlotte sipped tea from her cup. The refined taste, tinted with a drop of lemon and a hint of mint, was uniquely refreshing. She\u2019d have to beg Lady Olivia for the recipe.</p><p>\u201cAnd then I slapped him,\u201d Her Grace announced.</p><p>The women around the table gasped, some genuinely surprised, some, like Charlotte, out of a sense of duty.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me,\u201d Angelia squeezed out. She jumped to her feet and ran from the table.</p><p>A shocked silence claimed the gathering.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Lady Olivia said.</p><p>\u201cWith your permission, Your Grace, I should check on her,\u201d Charlotte folded her napkin.</p><p>\u201cYes, of course, my dear.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte stood up and headed toward the washroom. Behind her, Lady Olivia inquired, \u201cWhere was I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou slapped him,\u201d Sophie helpfully suggested.</p><p>\u201cAh yes . . .\u201d</p><p>Charlotte left the verandah, crossed the sunroom, and stopped by the washroom. Hysterical sobs echoed through the door. Perfect.</p><p>Charlotte slid a key from the inside of her sleeve, unlocked the door, and stepped inside. Angelia froze. She stood before the mirror, her tunic thrown carelessly to the floor. Bright red blisters covered her body, some as big as a thumbnail, surrounded by smaller ulcers, like some sickening constellations. Some had broken open, weeping pus.</p><p>\u201cOh my goodness,\u201d Charlotte murmured, and shut the door behind herself.</p><p>Emotions cascaded across Angelia\u2019s face: shock, indignant outrage, fury, shame, contemplation . . . She hovered between them, trying to choose the right one, the one most to her advantage. It lasted only a few seconds, but Charlotte saw it clearly. Angelia Ermine\u2019s sweet and often vacant face hid a strategist\u2019s mind. Charlotte would have to be exceptionally careful.</p><p>Angelia clamped her hands to her face and cried. Appropriate emotion, sure to gain sympathy. Charlotte squeezed the key in her fist. Angelia had stripped motherhood from dozens of women. If only she could kill her. Oh, if only.</p><p>\u201cShhh, shhh.\u201d Charlotte forced soothing calm into her voice. \u201cIt\u2019s all right.\u201d</p><p>Angelia bent over the sink, weeping like a hysterical dove. \u201cOh, Lady al-te Ran. Look at me.\u201d</p><p>Very dramatic. \u201cDo you know what illness this is?\u201d Charlotte asked.</p><p>The woman sobbed. \u201cLook, it\u2019s on my neck now. Everyone will see.\u201d</p><p>Nice misdirect, my dear. It won\u2019t work. \u201cYou\u2019re wearing lace with raw silk fibers. Raw silk tends to aggravate Dock Rot.\u201d</p><p>Angelia choked on her tears.</p><p>That\u2019s right, I know exactly why you\u2019re bearing these sores. She was sleeping with Brennan, who was by all indications possessive. Likely he was her only current lover, but she wasn\u2019t his only entertainment. Brennan had visited a professional and brought back this disease as a present for Angelia.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right.\u201d Charlotte feigned hesitation. \u201cLook, this is your secret. I have my own secret, too. I will help you with yours if you promise to keep mine to yourself. Will you do that, Angelia?\u201d</p><p>The woman nodded.</p><p>Charlotte reached over and touched her, fighting revulsion. Helping Angelia turned her stomach. Charlotte let her magic seep into the afflicted body. She found the disease and forced it into dormancy, spurning the skin cells into regeneration. The blisters burst, dried, and healed, turning into faint red stains.</p><p>\u201cOh my gods,\u201d Angelia whispered, for a moment forgetting about putting on a show.</p><p>Charlotte looked at the two of them in mirror, standing close to each other. \u201cFeel better?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a healer!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you can\u2019t tell anyone, Angelia. No one. Healers are not safe outside of their colleges. We\u2019re forbidden to do harm, and we\u2019re easy targets. Do I have your promise?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. Anything.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte picked up Angelia\u2019s tunic. \u201cHere, put this on.\u201d</p><p>The younger woman slipped into the tunic. Charlotte straightened her hair. \u201cAs beautiful as ever.\u201d</p><p>Angelia sniffed. It was an adorable sniff. It would\u2019ve worked even better if she weren\u2019t a monster.</p><p>\u201cAfter today, you must call on me. Healing you completely will take a much longer session, and we don\u2019t have time. Chin up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat will we tell them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll tell them you had an attack of food allergies. It will be fine. The duchess knows about me, and she trusts my judgment.\u201d Charlotte opened the door and held it. \u201cDo you know who\u2019s responsible for exposing you to this atrocity?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Angelia\u2019s face turned grim.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know who he is, and it isn\u2019t my place to ask, but you should know that this disease is easily preventable. He didn\u2019t use a sleeve, probably letting you shoulder the burden for preventing a pregnancy, but potions and pills do not prevent the spread of diseases.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was very selfish of him,\u201d Angelia said. If her voice had substance, it would\u2019ve cut. \u201cBut then, that\u2019s what men are\u2014selfish pigs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m outraged on your behalf. Not only is he being unfaithful, but he is forcing you to suffer the consequences of his infidelity. I hope you let him have a taste of his own medicine.\u201d</p><p>The younger woman turned to her, her face puzzled. \u201cWhat exactly do you propose?\u201d</p><p>Charlotte shrugged, scorn dripping from her. \u201cHe is cheating on you. Perhaps you should show some interest in a mutual acquaintance he considers beneath him. Someone masculine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone who may threaten his ego,\u201d the other woman said.</p><p>\u201cIndeed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know just the man.\u201d Angelia smiled. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat a beautiful smile.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, Charlotte, I believe we will get on quite well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI surely hope so. Come now, before we are missed.\u201d</p> <p>CHARLOTTE stood on the balcony of her house. The sun had set, but the sky was still lit with the wake of its passing. The house faced a park, and the evening wind rustled in the branches. Tiny insects, luminescent with green and orange, chased each other through the leaves.</p><p>Two days had passed since she healed Angelia in the bathroom, followed by another three-hour session at her house. The poisoned tree should\u2019ve borne fruit by now, and it was time for an update.</p><p>Somewhere out there, Richard waited, just as she did. Charlotte hugged herself.</p><p>She missed him. She missed the easy intimacy and the feeling of being held, not just physically, but emotionally. When they were together, she didn\u2019t have to face things alone. She hadn\u2019t realized until now how much she needed that closeness. In the worst time of her life, she had leaned on him, sometimes without realizing and sometimes consciously, and now he was gone. It felt like something had been ripped out of her.</p><p>Is that what love felt like? She had barely met him, but she felt like she knew him, intimately knew him better than she had known anyone in a long, long time.</p> <p>She wondered if he missed her.</p><p>A bluebird landed on the rail of the balcony and held unnaturally still.</p><p>\u201cHello, George.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood evening.\u201d George\u2019s voice emanated from a point somewhat higher than the bird\u2019s head.</p><p>\u201cI still don\u2019t understand how you do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a technique I learned in the Mire. One of Richard\u2019s relatives is an accomplished necromancer, and Richard took me to see him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIs he ready?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m in contact with Richard as well.\u201d George paused. \u201cHe says hello.\u201d</p><p>She wished they could meet, but meetings could be observed, and communication via magic devices could be intercepted. This was the only safe way.</p><p>\u201cI attended Lord Caraway\u2019s lunch,\u201d George reported. \u201cLady A spent the entire time hanging on M\u2019s arm and his every word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Angelia was paying attention to Maedoc. Brennan would notice it, especially now that Richard had put the idea of Maedoc\u2019s betrayal into his mind. With luck, he might view Angelia\u2019s sudden interest in the retired general as a sign of her switching loyalty.</p><p>\u201cRichard says that you are brilliant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease tell him thank you for me. How did the attack go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRichard says that the attack went as planned, but B didn\u2019t take the bait.\u201d</p> <p>Damn it. \u201cHe didn\u2019t buy M\u2019s betrayal?\u201d</p><p>George paused. \u201cNo. Richard says that he underestimated B. B judged the attack as too obvious. He\u2019s likely making inquiries into the rest of the players.\u201d</p><p>Brennan didn\u2019t trust anyone, even an ally who stood next to him in a sword fight. This was bad news. \u201cAre we going to Step 2?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. He sends his sincere apologies. He hoped to keep you from being involved.\u201d</p><p>It was up to her to execute Step 2. In the planning stage, Richard had hoped that the attack alone would be enough to make Brennan suspect Maedoc. In the event it failed to do so, she had to provide a confirmation of Maedoc\u2019s guilt to Brennan. Since Richard and she acted independently, Brennan had no reason to suspect a conspiracy.</p><p>Before they started the game, Richard had his brother plant a file in the records of the Military Archive. The image of Richard\u2019s face was now tied to the fabricated identity of a veteran of the Adrianglian Army, who had served a number of years under Maedoc. The Five knew what the Hunter looked like, and now it was up to her to connect the dots between the Hunter and Maedoc, and present it to Brennan.</p><p>\u201cNo apologies necessary. I need some things. I didn\u2019t have to infect A. She already carried Dock Rot. B isn\u2019t faithful to her, just as Richard anticipated. I need to track down the prostitute he\u2019s sleeping with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer name is Miranda,\u201d George said. \u201cShe works out of the Palace of Delights on Griffon Avenue in the Lower Quarter.\u201d</p><p>Sometimes Richard was frighteningly thorough. \u201cTell him thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe says he misses you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI miss him, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease be careful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou, too,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>The bird spread its wings and shot into the air.</p><p>She missed Richard. If she closed her eyes, she could picture him, his eyes, his muscular body, the smile on his lips . . . Her memory conjured the feel of his skin against hers and even his scent. She missed him so much, it almost hurt. The sooner they destroyed Brennan, the faster they could be together. Assuming he still wanted her.</p><p>She\u2019d sensed a certain distance between them before they left, as if he was consciously building a barrier between himself and her. Something had changed between them. She wasn\u2019t sure what, but it troubled her.</p><p>Charlotte stepped inside. Sophie sat on the couch, her legs tucked under her, a book spread in front of her. The wolfripper hound sprawled on the floor next to her.</p><p>\u201cI need your help,\u201d Charlotte said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to visit a dangerous part of town.</p><p>Sophie uncoiled from the couch. \u201cI\u2019ll get my sword. Can we bring the dog?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>Half an hour later, wrapped in a hooded cloak, Charlotte dropped two gold doubloons on the counter of the Palace of Delights. \u201cMiranda.\u201d</p><p>The proprietress, an older woman in a crushed silk gown, didn\u2019t even blink. \u201cSecond floor, blue door.\u201d</p><p>The blue door opened into a comfortable room with a canopy bed, all in various shades of red. The sheets were black silk. A thick red rug hid the floor. The furnishings were rich but slightly vulgar.</p><p>A moment, and a woman walked through the door. She was slender, blond, and doe-eyed. She saw Sophie.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t do kids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrennan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know any Brennan.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte opened her wallet and dropped a coin on the desk. Miranda\u2019s eyes widened. That\u2019s right, a gold doubloon. Charlotte added another to the first, making it clink. Another doubloon. Another. Five now. Five doubloons was probably more than Miranda made in a month.</p><p>\u201cI could just take the money,\u201d Miranda said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d cut off your hand before you touched it,\u201d Sophie said. Her eyes were glacially cold. Miranda looked at her and took a small step back.</p><p>Six doubloons.</p><p>\u201cOnce I stop dropping coins, my offer to pay for your information is withdrawn,\u201d Charlotte said. \u201cBetter make up your mind.\u201d</p><p>Seven.</p><p>She held the eighth doubloon between her fingers for a long moment. Miranda sucked in a breath. The coin clinked against the others on the table.</p><p>Charlotte sighed.</p><p>\u201cFine!\u201d Miranda shrugged. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you. Money first.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte let her sweep the gold off the table.</p><p>\u201cHe comes, he fucks, he leaves. If you\u2019re looking for state secrets, he doesn\u2019t share.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me about his habits. What does he like?\u201d</p><p>Miranda sat on the bed. \u201cNothing too twisted. He likes to feel he owns you. Sometimes he makes me crawl to him and beg him to fuck me. I don\u2019t care\u2014as long as he\u2019s paying. He\u2019s got this thing about all women being secretly whores. Sometimes he makes me dress up in a nice prim outfit, formal gown, flowers in the hair, the whole thing, and suck him. He gets off on the perversity of it, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know that you have Dock Rot?\u201d</p><p>Miranda grimaced. \u201cI know. Damn soldiers. I already took my medicine.\u201d</p><p>AFTER the perfumed air of the Palace of Delights, the cold night breeze felt refreshing. Charlotte and Sophie walked down the street. Charlotte walked fast. Regrettably, the closest place where they had been able to leave their phaeton was a brisk five-minute walk away, and the neighborhood wasn\u2019t exactly safe. They left the dog tied to the vehicle just in case.</p><p>\u201cMaking her crawl to him is sick,\u201d Sophie said.</p><p>\u201cBrennan likes to debase women. He also likes to feel powerful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did we need to know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he\u2019s investigating Richard, which means he hasn\u2019t bought our story completely. Angelia\u2019s ignoring him in favor of Maedoc. He\u2019ll look for ways to punish Angelia and possibly replace her. There may come a time that I will have to distract him.\u201d</p><p>Sophie mulled it over. \u201cJust like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrennan is power-hungry, and I\u2019m his type: tall and blond.\u201d</p><p>They turned into the phaeton lot. Two men blocked their way. The taller of the two flashed a knife. \u201cMoney. Now.\u201d</p><p>Nice tactic. The Palace had to have maintained security because mugged patrons were bad for business. So someone there either noticed that they left early and surmised they were looking for information rather than pleasure, or Miranda had raised an alarm. Likely the first option\u2014the proprietress had given them a sharp look when they left, and Miranda was paid too well to blab. Now they were being scared off, just in case they had any thoughts of coming back.</p><p>\u201cMoney, you cow!\u201d The man raised his knife.</p><p>\u201cMay I?\u201d Sophie asked. \u201cPlease?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeave, or she will kill you,\u201d Charlotte said.</p><p>\u201cSuit yourself, whore.\u201d The man lunged and gasped as his arm slid off his body and fell to the pavement. His mouth gaped open in the horrified beginning of a scream. He never got to make one. Sophie swept past him, and he crumpled to the floor. The other thug backed away, his hands in the air, and fled into the night.</p><p>Sophie pulled a cloth from her tunic and cleaned the blood off her blade.</p><p>Charlotte looked at the body on the ground. He was damaged beyond her skill. A child had just ended the man\u2019s life and seemed completely untroubled by it.</p><p>\u201cCome.\u201d Charlotte headed toward their vehicle. \u201cDo you enjoy killing, Sophie?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI enjoy the shadows,\u201d Sophie said.</p><p>\u201cThe shadows?\u201d</p><p>At the phaeton, the wolfripper hound licked her hand. Charlotte let it into the back, and they got into the vehicle. Sophie started the phaeton, and they rolled off into the night.</p> <p>\u201cI walk the path of the lightning blade. A warrior poised between light and darkness. It\u2019s difficult to explain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would appreciate it if you tried anyway.\u201d</p><p>Sophie frowned, her profile, lit by the golden glow of the instruments panel, etched against the night outside. \u201cThe death isn\u2019t important. The only thing that matters is the moment of decision. My path is a line. My opponent\u2019s path is another line. In the instant we meet, we\u2019re forever altered. We may both walk away, or my line or his line may end, but for a brief time we exist in the same space on the verge of action, and that space is full of possibilities. It\u2019s the moment in which I truly live. It\u2019s short. It\u2019s always so very short.\u201d</p><p>An old memory flashed before Charlotte. She was sixteen, attending a dance during a summit with another college, and as she stood there, chatting with her friends, she saw an older boy looking at her from across the floor. She saw admiration in his eyes. In that brief instant, when their gazes met, an array of possibilities flashed before her: he could come over, he could talk to her, there could be the start of something . . . It was a sweet kind of thrill, slightly frightening, but exciting. But Sophie found it in battle and was addicted to it. How could you even begin to fix something like that?</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the next step?\u201d Sophie asked.</p> <p>\u201cThe next step is to prepare for the Grand Thane\u2019s wedding. We need to pack and leave in three days. It will take us at least a day to get there, and we need to make sure we don\u2019t arrive too early or too late. You will love Pierre de Rivi\u00e8re. I saw it first when I was your age, and it is a beautiful castle. We\u2019ll attend the wedding, where I\u2019ll catch Brennan\u2019s attention, and find some way to connect Hunter and Maedoc.\u201d She wasn\u2019t quite sure how she would go about it.</p><p>Thinking about the wedding made her feel uneasy. Anxiety took her heart into a cold fist and squeezed. What if something happened to her or to Richard? This was no game. If they stumbled, Brennan would kill them.</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to do it, Charlotte realized. She was afraid. She wanted to run away with Richard back to the cabin in the woods and pretend none of this had ever happened. The anticipation of what she was about to do pressed on her like a crushing weight. She wanted to escape.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s where Spider will be,\u201d Sophie said. \u201cAt the wedding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s where you won\u2019t kill him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if I could?\u201d Sophie asked.</p> <p>\u201cTell me, what does Spider do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s an agent of the Hand and the head of a Hand\u2019s crew,\u201d Sophie said.</p><p>\u201cPeople under his command are enhanced to monstrous levels. I find it very unlikely that he would travel alone. Look at me, Sophie.\u201d</p><p>The girl turned her face to Charlotte.</p><p>\u201cPromise me that you won\u2019t kill him. I placed so much trust in you. Tell me you won\u2019t betray it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d Sophie said. \u201cYou\u2019ve been very kind to me. You don\u2019t have to worry, Lady Charlotte. I keep my promises.\u201d</p><p>FIFTEEN</p><p>THE long-distance phaeton shot out of the woods. It was time to wake Sophie. Charlotte touched the girl\u2019s hand, and she awoke instantly, fully alert.</p> <p>\u201cLook out the window,\u201d Charlotte said.</p><p>Sophie leaned toward the wide panel of glass in the phaeton. A vast river stretched before them, its placid waters golden and pearl, reflecting the glory of the setting sun. A flat bridge spanned the endless width of the river, and in the middle of the bridge, thrusting straight out of the water, a castle rose.</p><p>Sophie took a sharp breath.</p><p>The castle of Pierre de Rivi\u00e8re towered before them like a massive stately mountain of buildings crafted with cream stone. Couched in green trees growing from planters, its walls and countless terraces and balconies all but glowed in the sun. Thin, ornate spires stretched to the sky. Giant windows looked out onto the world from among the textured parapets and ornamental wall carvings so delicate, so light, that the entire enormous structure seemed to float upon the waters of the river.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s so beautiful,\u201d Sophie whispered.</p><p>\u201cI hoped you would like it. It\u2019s one of the wonders of the continent.\u201d</p><p>The phaeton entered the bridge. The wolfripper dog raised his shaggy head in alarm.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d Charlotte told him.</p><p>She\u2019d suggested leaving the hound at the Camarine estate, but Sophie had hugged him and looked at her as if she\u2019d suggested cutting off an arm. Faced with two pairs of sad puppy eyes, Charlotte had capitulated. She had insisted on a leash, a bath, and a haircut, all of which had failed to turn him into a pampered pet. He still looked like he chased wolves through the woods. They would have to make an effort to walk him, and he would make things less convenient, but it couldn\u2019t be helped.</p><p>A high, forlorn cry rolled through the sky, as if the clouds had sung.</p><p>\u201cLook!\u201d Charlotte pointed at a bright green spark dropping from the sky.</p><p>The spark plummeted, growing, becoming an enormous scaled shape armed with massive wings. The wyvern circled the castle, the sun reflecting from the cabin on its back. Another joined it, then another . . . One by one, they landed on the castle grounds.</p><p>\u201cThe elite of both realms will be there.\u201d Charlotte smiled. \u201cAre you excited?\u201d</p><p>Sophie nodded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so glad. Enjoy it,\u201d Charlotte told her. \u201cIt\u2019s magic.\u201d</p><p>They had work to do, but for now she would just sit here and watch the world of wonder blossom in the child\u2019s eyes, and for a few brief moments, she could be fifteen again, riding in a phaeton to her first ball.</p><p>The bridge brought them beneath the portcullis to the main thoroughfare that circled the castle. The phaeton veered right, along a side route, and finally came to a stop in the courtyard before a grand stairway. A familiar man stood on the bottom step, speaking to a noble in a dark doublet. Brennan, Charlotte realized.</p><p>Their driver opened the door, and Charlotte stepped out.</p><p>\u201cCharlotte!\u201d Angelia called.</p><p>Oh Dawn Mother. \u201cAngelia!\u201d</p><p>Angelia Ermine swept into her view. \u201cI\u2019m so glad you could make it.\u201d</p><p>At the stairway, Brennan turned. His gaze snagged on them. He smiled at the man he was speaking too and strode toward them.</p><p>Anxiety pierced Charlotte. She pretended to listen to Angelia. She wore a silk tunic and trousers, both in a beautiful shade of green. The clothes were formfitting and only a hint suggestive, which made them rather prim by the standards of society. She hadn\u2019t counted on meeting Brennan right off the phaeton, but the possibility existed, and she had dressed precisely for that occasion.</p><p>\u201cAngelia,\u201d Brennan said.</p><p>The other woman spun, surprised. \u201cRobert . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy dear, I\u2019m most put out.\u201d Brennan took Angelia\u2019s hand and kissed her fingers. \u201cYou\u2019ve been denying me the pleasure of your company. One would almost think you were displeased with me.\u201d</p><p>Angelia blinked. \u201cOf course not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho is your friend?\u201d</p><p>Angelia produced a charming smile. \u201cCharlotte de Ney al-te Ran.\u201d</p><p>Brennan blinked. The name had the desired effect.</p><p>\u201cCharlotte, Lord Robert Brennan.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte curtsied. \u201cYour Highness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh no, please. No titles.\u201d Brennan waved his hand. \u201cMy memory may be betraying me, but I\u2019m almost positive I haven\u2019t encountered you before. I would have remembered our meeting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMay I tell him?\u201d Angelia asked. \u201cMay I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs you wish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCharlotte comes to us from the Ganer College of Medicinal Arts. She has spent quite a long time there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey don\u2019t let us out much.\u201d Charlotte smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like a convent.\u201d</p><p>Interest sparked in Brennan\u2019s eyes. She was right\u2014the idea of seducing a woman shut off in a convent appealed to him.</p><p>\u201cHow peculiar,\u201d Brennan said. \u201cI don\u2019t believe I\u2019ve ever met a College escapee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019m flattered to be the first, my lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you a healer?\u201d Brennan asked.</p><p>\u201cOnly a physician, my lord.\u201d Lucky for her, Ganer College was home to both magic healers and their mundane counterparts. Given that Brennan had gone to visit the Island of Na, he must\u2019ve heard of Silver Death killing people on the island with strange magic. She didn\u2019t want to advertise her talents. He could connect the dots.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a healer,\u201d Angelia blurted out. \u201cAn excellent one.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte heaved a small sigh. \u201cForgive me, my lord. We don\u2019t usually identify ourselves outside of the College.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfectly understandable. I imagine you would be inundated with requests otherwise.\u201d Brennan glanced at Angelia. \u201cI had no idea you kept such exotic company. I do hope you haven\u2019t been ill, my lady?\u201d</p><p>Angelia\u2019s composure crumbled. \u201cLady Charlotte is a friend,\u201d she squeezed through her teeth. \u201cBut now that you mention it, yes, I have been ill. I\u2019ve caught a most unpleasant disease from a most surprising source. I can\u2019t wait to tell you all about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would love to hear it, but we\u2019re being rude to your friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh no, not at all,\u201d Charlotte said. \u201cI\u2019m tired from my journey, and I need to do all those small secret female things women do to make themselves presentable before the dinner. Please excuse me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you for your understanding,\u201d Brennan said. \u201cThe loss is entirely ours.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte curtsied and watched them walk away. Angelia\u2019s spine was rigid like a spear\u2014she was fuming. She was about to reveal to Brennan that he had infected her with Dock Rot, and that conversation couldn\u2019t possibly go well. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHow did it go?\u201d Sophie murmured at her elbow.</p><p>\u201cIt went well. Now we must lay our trap.\u201d</p><p>An hour later, Charlotte paced in her dressing room. Her dress waited on the bed. She wore a long black robe. Her undergarments had been very carefully chosen\u2014she wore the tiniest of black lace panties, a bra that was a collection of translucent lace and black straps, and black stockings held up by thin ribbons simulating leather. She\u2019d had the ensemble custom-made, modeled after some of the sexy garments she had seen advertised in the flyers from the Broken. The outfit wasn\u2019t just seductive, it was erotic, explicit, and raunchy. A woman of her status had no business wearing these kinds of undergarments unless she was aiming to provide very specific entertainment to her lover. Her spike- heeled shoes raised her to dangerous heights. Her hair had been arranged into an elegant wave appropriate to a formal function. Her makeup was perfect, and she was as ready as she could be.</p> <p>This was a prime opportunity\u2014Brennan still remembered her\u2014and capturing his attention later would be significantly harder. Being unmarried, he would be inundated with women. She had to make an unforgettable impression immediately.</p><p>Sophie sat on the bed and watched her pace. \u201cWhat if he isn\u2019t interested?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe will be. Men like Brennan think that every woman is secretly wanton. He loves the juxtaposition of the prim and proper with the dirty and seductive. He loves to corrupt. It makes him feel powerful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you walk in those shoes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPractice. Lots of practice.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat if he\u2014\u201d</p><p>The door swung open, and Jack stuck his head into the crack. \u201cHe\u2019s coming!\u201d</p><p>Thank you, gods.</p><p>The door clicked shut.</p><p>\u201cQuick!\u201d Charlotte tossed the robe aside and moved into position in plain view of the door. Sophie grabbed the gown and held it up as if to put it on her.</p><p>GEORGE leaned against the column and watched out of the corner of his eye as Brennan walked up the stairs. The Guest Keep resembled the Broken\u2019s hotels in its architecture: a stairway led from the bottom floor to a long landing connecting to a hallway, then another stairway at the opposite end of the landing led to the next higher floor. Each of the visiting bluebloods had been assigned a set of rooms, and the roster of the rooms had been posted at each intersection of stairs and hallways. From his vantage point on the fourth-floor landing, George had an excellent view of the lower stairway and the roster.</p> <p>Brennan was a third of the way up the stairs.</p><p>Kaldar, dressed in the gray-and-blue uniform of the castle staff, walked out of the hallway. He casually stepped to the roster, slid it off the wall, hung a new one in its place, and walked away.</p><p>Cutting it close. Kaldar liked to live dangerously.</p><p>Brennan conquered the stairs and paused before the roster. The original list put Brennan and the rest of the royal relatives on the fifth floor. This roster placed him on the third.</p><p>George pondered Brennan\u2019s back. He was a large man, strong, athletic. Thick, muscular neck. Jack could snap it, but he would have trouble.</p><p>This man was responsible for Sophie\u2019s torment. He turned slavers from random raiders to an organized force. His hands were stained with M\u00e9m\u00e8re\u2019s blood. He made it possible for John Drayton to sink so low, he drowned.</p><p>A small, furious voice chanted inside George, \u201cKill him, kill him, kill him . . .\u201d But there would be no killing, not now. No, first there would be public humiliation. Then there would be shame, then anguish, then punishment.</p><p>Brennan turned to the right, heading down the hallway toward Charlotte\u2019s room. George concentrated, sending his voice to an undead mouse riding in Jack\u2019s pocket. \u201cHe\u2019s coming.\u201d</p> <p>Brennan disappeared into the hallway. Kaldar strode to the roster, swiped it off the wall, and placed the original in its spot.</p><p>THE door swung open.</p><p>Charlotte took a deep breath.</p><p>Brennan stepped into the suite and stopped. His eyes widened. He gaped at her, his mouth hanging slightly open.</p><p>Sophie froze, her face suitably shocked.</p><p>Charlotte met Brennan\u2019s gaze. She knew her poise was perfect, but inside she was trembling. She made no attempt to cover up. She simply stood there, as if she were wearing the most conservative of gowns, her expression even.</p><p>Brennan\u2019s gaze roamed over her body, pausing on her breasts, her stomach, and finally on the triangle between her legs, barely obscured by translucent black lace. She had his complete attention. A woman of noble name, who was proper in all outward appearances and who had just come out of seclusion, secretly wearing an outfit that would embarrass a professional. He had to take the bait. It was made to order specifically for him.</p><p>A long moment passed.</p><p>Charlotte raised her eyebrows, and said, her voice perfectly even, \u201cI believe you\u2019re in the wrong room, my lord.\u201d</p><p>Brennan blinked as if waking up. A lifetime of experience in etiquette kicked in. \u201cOf course. My apologies, my lady.\u201d</p><p>He shut the door.</p><p>\u201cKnowing the precisely correct thing to do in every situation, then doing it with unshakable entitlement,\u201d Sophie whispered.</p><p>Charlotte\u2019s knees trembled. She collapsed into a chair.</p><p>GEORGE watched as Brennan emerged onto the landing and marched to the roster. His face wore a look of intense concentration. He stopped before the roster and stared at it for a long moment.</p><p>His room number and Charlotte\u2019s differed by exactly one digit. Hers read 322 and his 522. It had taken a great deal of manipulation on Kaldar\u2019s part to arrange this. Any significant difference between the numbers, and Brennan would\u2019ve smelled a rat.</p><p>The man shook his head and started up the stairs. George stepped away from the column, back out of Brennan\u2019s view, and walked away quickly, staying close to the wall. He turned the corner just as Brennan stepped onto the fourth-floor landing.</p><p>DINNER was served on one of the massive terraces and consisted of light appetizers.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m hungry,\u201d Sophie murmured.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s expected that after the ball we\u2019ll have a late dinner in our rooms,\u201d Charlotte murmured, and adjusted the strap on Sophie\u2019s left shoulder. This dress, a beautiful variation of blue-gray with a metallic sheen, was a collaboration between her and the dressmaker. Two thin shoulder straps held up a modest linear bodice that hugged Sophie\u2019s slender figure. Thin leaves of pale and darker blue overlapped on the bodice, built from the left side and spreading in a fan to the right. Two gathered lengths of fabric draped over Sophie\u2019s hips, tight enough to accentuate the modest flare of her hips but loose enough to still be appropriate. Past the draped fabric, a wide skirt built from layers of chiffon streamed down to the floor.</p><p>It was a refreshing dress, youthful and light, and its style matched Charlotte\u2019s own gown. She\u2019d chosen a blue-green chiffon. Two leaves of silvery fabric served as her sleeves. The pattern continued along her sides, the leaves stretching to hug her, underscoring her waist and the curve of her hips. Tiny silvery dots, each slightly less shiny than the leaves, traced a delicate pattern over her chest and stomach, until finally her skirt flared into layers and layers of weightless chiffon.</p><p>Sophie looked beautiful. She herself looked elegant and every inch a blueblood, which is exactly what Charlotte was trying to project. The music was getting louder. Soon the dancing would start. She wasn\u2019t expected to dance but once or twice, but Sophie would enjoy it. And likely cause a stir. Charlotte had asked her to demonstrate a couple of dances, and her footwork was exquisite.</p><p>She felt the pressure of someone\u2019s gaze, scanned the gathering, and ran into Richard\u2019s face. He stood across the terrace, in the shadow of a column, and he was looking at her with shock and longing, as if he were thunderstruck. It hurt. It hurt so much to stand there across from him and know that she couldn\u2019t walk over there, she couldn\u2019t touch him or go away with him. Charlotte looked away.</p><p>No matter what happened around her, deep inside she always remembered that either of them, or both of them, might not survive this. They were in constant danger, and a happy outcome wasn\u2019t guaranteed. That knowledge pressed on her like an ever-present, crushing burden. She awoke with it, and she went to bed with it. It haunted her through the day. Occasionally, she would get distracted and forget, but inevitably she would remember, and when she did, the fear and anxiety hit her like a punch to the stomach. Her throat closed up, her eyes watered, and her chest hurt. For a few moments, she would hover on the verge of tears and have to talk herself off the cliff.</p><p>She missed Richard. She worried about him more than she worried about herself.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t made for this, she realized. Some might revel in danger and intrigue, but she just wanted everything to be done. She wanted it to be over. The stress and the pressure chipped at her, and she felt herself cracking under their chisel. The harder the pressure ground, the more she wanted to escape. Last night, she\u2019d dreamed about walking up to Brennan, killing him, and throwing herself from the balcony. In the morning she had been horrified\u2014not by the suicidal fantasy, but because for a brief moment before she returned to reality, she felt relief.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t shatter. Too many people depended on her, Sophie, Richard, Tulip . . . Speaking of Sophie, where had she gone?</p><p>Charlotte turned and saw a group of young people, all on the cusp of adulthood, surrounding a blueblood in a dark green doublet. He was tall, blond, and strikingly beautiful. He was telling some sort of story, and his face wore the comfortable expression of a practiced speaker. His audience hung on his every word.</p><p>Charlotte drifted closer, analyzing his gestures. Not just blood, old blood. Not Adrianglian, definitely a Louisianan bend\u2014he\u2019d raised his hand in an elegant gesture, palm up, index finger almost parallel to the floor, three others bent slightly\u2014a clear tell. Louisianan court etiquette dictated that when the Emperor was present, the nobles carried a token, a small silver coin engraved with his likeness, worn on a chain wound around the fingers. The gesture was designed to display the coin and was so ingrained in the manners of the older families, they made it unconsciously when they presented a point during an argument or acknowledged someone\u2019s else\u2019s point. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She\u2019d drifted close enough to hear him.</p><p>\u201c. . . After all, as Ferrah states, excelling in the service of the multitude is the highest calling. The ego can attain its pinnacle only when laboring for the greater good of the majority.\u201d</p><p>There were nods and sounds of agreement. He really had them entranced.</p> <p>\u201cBut doesn\u2019t Ferrah also say that compromising one\u2019s ethics is the ultimate betrayal of self,\u201d Sophie\u2019s voice sounded from the back. The group of young people parted, and Charlotte saw her. \u201cAnd since he defines ethics as the ultimate expression of individuality, his arguments are contradictory and suspect.\u201d</p><p>The blueblood looked at her with genuine interest. \u201cThe contradiction is present at first glance, yet it disappears if one assumes the moral code of the individual is aligned with the goals of the multitude.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut does not the multitude consist of individuals with wildly conflicting moral codes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt does.\u201d The blueblood smiled, clearly enjoying the argument. \u201cBut the attitudes of the multitude are aimed at self-preservation; therefore, we have the emergence of common laws: don\u2019t murder, don\u2019t commit adultery, don\u2019t steal. It is that commonality that prompted Ferrah to embark on the examination of multitude and self.\u201d</p><p>Sophie frowned. \u201cI was under the impression that Ferrah embarked on the examination of multitude and self because he desired his sister sexually and was upset that society wouldn\u2019t permit him to marry her?\u201d</p> <p>The young people gasped. The noble laughed. \u201cWhose treasure are you, child?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMine,\u201d Charlotte said.</p><p>The noble turned to her and executed a flawless bow. \u201cMy lady, my highest compliments. It is rare to see a well-read child in this day and age. May I have the pleasure of your name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCharlotte de Ney al-te Ran.\u201d</p><p>The noble straightened. \u201cAn ancient name, my lady. I\u2019m Sebastian Lafayette, Comte de Belidor. And this is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSophie.\u201d</p> <p>The noble smiled at Sophie. \u201cWe must speak more, Sophie.\u201d</p><p>Sophie curtsied with perfect grace. \u201cYou honor me, my lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope she didn\u2019t upset you, Lord Belidor,\u201d Charlotte said.</p><p>The noble turned to her. \u201cSebastian, please. On the contrary. I often become frustrated at the lack of mettle among the younger generation. It seems that we had . . . not a better education, per se, but perhaps more incentive to use it. They learn, but they hardly think.\u201d</p><p>Behind Sebastian, Sophie mouthed something silently.</p><p>A woman in the dark blue uniform of the castle staff approached them and bowed, holding a small card out to Charlotte. \u201cLady de Ney al-te Ran.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me,\u201d Charlotte smiled at Sebastian and took the card. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>On the card beautiful calligraphy letters said, \u201cHis Highness Lord Robert Brennan cordially requests the pleasure of your company for the Rioga Dance.\u201d</p> <p>Charlotte blinked. The Rioga Dance was an old tradition. The floor was cleared, and a single pair\u2014one of whom was of royal blood but never the reigning monarch\u2014danced alone. It was the official start of the ball, and a privilege most women here would kill for, quite literally.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s seems I\u2019m to dance the Rioga,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cCongratulations.\u201d Sebastian bowed his head. \u201cWhat an honor.\u201d</p><p>Before he straightened, Sophie mouthed something again. What was she trying to say?</p><p>\u201cGive way to the Grand Thane!\u201d the crier barked.</p><p>Charlotte curtsied. As one, the nobles around her bowed.</p><p>A procession spilled out of the doors, led by the Grand Thane, a huge bear of a man, his mane of hair completely silver. The Marchesa of Louisiana, his future bride, who walked next to him, seemed tiny in comparison. She was only five years younger, but she moved with the grace of a much younger woman. Her dress, a shimmering gown of pale cream sparked with tiny lights, as if studded with stars.</p><p>Behind them, the immediate members of both families strode side by side. Charlotte glimpsed Brennan directly behind the Grand Thane. He looked positively splendid in a formfitting jacket, its red tone so dark, it was almost black. You terrible bloody bastard.</p><p>The procession swept through the gathering. The Grand Thane led the Marchesa to a pair of thronelike chairs. She sat.</p><p>The women in the audience rose, Charlotte with them. The Grand Thane took his seat, and the men rose as well.</p><p>Brennan stepped forward.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s time, my lady,\u201d the woman who had delivered her invitation said.</p><p>Sophie was smiling. There was something deeply disturbing about her smile.</p><p>In the circle, Brennan nodded to Charlotte.</p><p>\u201cMy lady, it\u2019s time,\u201d the woman prompted again.</p><p>Sophie\u2019s lips moved again.</p><p>Spider.</p><p>Sebastian was Spider. Dawn Mother. I am leaving Sophie standing next to Spider.</p><p>The opening notes of the Rioga floated on the breeze. Charlotte had no time to stop. All she could do was step forward.</p><p>RICHARD pretended to be bored. Next to him, Rene chattered about something with Lorameh and Lady Karin, Rene\u2019s cousin. Soon the dancing would start.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t spoken to Charlotte for nine days. Nine days of no contact. George\u2019s birds didn\u2019t really count. Nine days of brooding and sleeping alone, just him and his thoughts, and his thoughts had turned pretty dark. He wanted to see her. He wanted to tell her he loved her and hear that she loved him in return. The moment his mouth didn\u2019t have to make small talk, thoughts of her intruded into his mind. He imagined a life with her. He imagined a life without her. Perhaps he was going crazy.</p><p>Brennan walked out into the open expanse of the terrace.</p><p>Richard had to fight from grinding his teeth. Being in Brennan\u2019s presence was becoming harder and harder, both because he hated the man and because Brennan\u2019s good fortune brought his own shortcomings into focus. The man who had been given literally every advantage in life, while he himself was given none, used all his resources and talents to profit from the misery of others. He couldn\u2019t wait to bring Brennan down.</p><p>\u201cI guess Robert is the sacrificial lamb on the Rioga\u2019s altar,\u201d Rene quipped.</p><p>\u201cI wonder who his partner is,\u201d Lorameh said.</p><p>\u201cAngelia?\u201d Lady Karin suggested.</p><p>\u201cShe wishes.\u201d Lorameh laughed.</p><p>The music began.</p><p>\u201cI do hope he won\u2019t be stood up,\u201d Rene said with mock concern.</p><p>The crowd parted, and Charlotte walked out.</p><p>The world came to a screeching halt. Her dress flared about her with every step, the diaphanous layers of blue-green fabric thin like gossamer, suggesting the contours of her body, then obscuring them. She didn\u2019t walk, she glided.</p><p>\u201cDivine. Who is she?\u201d Lorameh asked from somewhere far.</p><p>\u201cLady de Ney al-te Ran,\u201d Rene said. \u201cExquisite, no? And such a name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh no,\u201d Lady Karin said. \u201cShe mustn\u2019t have expected to be asked to dance. Her heels are too high.\u201d</p><p>His memory told him that Charlotte couldn\u2019t be as tall as Brennan during the Rioga: he was a man and of royal blood. It would be a critical social blunder. Most people watching her knew it. She had to know it as well.</p><p>Without breaking her stride, Charlotte stepped out of her shoes. She didn\u2019t slow down; she didn\u2019t give any indication of what she had done. She simply kept gliding forward, leaving two high-heeled shoes behind her. Sophie scooped them up and melted into the crowd.</p><p>Lady Karin gasped. Someone to the left clapped, then someone to the right, and Charlotte curtsied before Brennan to the sound of appreciative applause.</p><p>Brennan bowed, offering her his hand. She placed her hand onto his palm.</p><p>Sharp pain stabbed Richard between his ribs on the left side. Suddenly, the air grew viscous. He struggled to breathe.</p><p>Brennan rose to his full height and rested his arm around Charlotte\u2019s, touching her back.</p><p>He was touching her.</p><p>The music broke into a fast rhythm, and the two of them spun into the dance, Charlotte\u2019s dress streaming around Brennan like water currents around a rock.</p><p>His hands were on her. His fingers were touching her skin. She was touching him. Her hand rested in his. She was smiling. She looked like she was enjoying it. She looked at Brennan, and her face glowed with admiration.</p><p>A wave of ice rolled over Richard\u2019s skin and evaporated, burned off by all-consuming anger. He was watching Charlotte and Brennan turn and turn on the dance floor, helpless to do anything about it.</p><p>\u201cThey look so beautiful together,\u201d Lady Karin said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got to hate the man,\u201d Rene said. \u201cRoyal blood, rich, smart, good fighter. You\u2019d think fate would disfigure him just out of the sense of fairness, but no, the bastard is handsome, and the moment a sophisticated, enchanting woman enters society, he snatches her up before any of us even trade two words with her.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s right. Brennan was handsome, rich, with royal pedigree. And who was Richard? A penniless swamp rat with a sword and a stolen face.</p><p>In his mind, Richard stepped out onto the dance floor. He held his own sword in his hand, not Casside\u2019s weak rapier. He cut in between them, spun in a burst of magic and steel, and Brennan\u2019s head rolled off his shoulders onto the floor.</p><p>Charlotte gasped. He walked over to her . . .</p><p>The music ended, and he heard his own heartbeat, too loud, like the toll of some giant bell. Brennan was bowing. Charlotte curtsied. Brennan straightened. The emotion on his face was unmistakable: it was the primal need of a man who had found a woman he had to have.</p><p>People applauded. It sounded like a storm to Richard\u2019s ears. She never said she loved him. She gave him her body in the cabin, perhaps in a moment of weakness, but she never promised anything to him. And if she had, promises were often broken.</p><p>Brennan led Charlotte over to the Grand Thane and the Marchesa. She curtsied again, a deep, graceful bow. The Marchesa said something. Charlotte replied. Brennan grinned, displaying even teeth.</p><p>The crowd turned into a smudge of faces, the voices blended into a loud hum, and Brennan\u2019s face and those gleaming teeth came into sharp focus. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Richard pictured driving the blade of his sword into Brennan\u2019s eye. Everything within him wanted Brennan\u2019s blood. He stood poised on the edge of his blade, fighting to keep his balance.</p><p>\u201cCasside, are you unwell?\u201d Lorameh asked, looking at him very carefully. \u201cYou haven\u2019t said a word.\u201d</p><p>Answer, you fool. Say something.</p> <p>He forced his lips to move. \u201cI have a headache. I think I shall retire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the flowers,\u201d Lorameh said. \u201cThat much perfume and pollen mixing together, it\u2019s a wonder the lot of us haven\u2019t collapsed from breathing it in. Let\u2019s get a drink, my friend.\u201d</p><p>Richard willed himself to move, but his feet remained rooted to the floor.</p><p>\u201cCome now,\u201d Lorameh said. \u201cYou\u2019ll feel better after some fresher air and a bit of wine.\u201d</p><p>Staying here, watching the two of them, would do nothing except put him at risk of jeopardizing everything. Richard turned, snapping the chain of jealousy and pain that anchored him in place, and followed Lorameh into the castle, where drinks had been set out.</p> <p>CHARLOTTE wiggled her toes in the ceramic footbath. Dancing barefoot across the ancient stone wasn\u2019t the most pleasant of experiences. She\u2019d stepped twice on some sharp pebble, and the dirt of the stones, although they had been cleaned, was now permanently embedded in her feet. She\u2019d soaped them, scrubbed, and even tried a pumice stone, but the dirt remained. Finally, she had resorted to soaking.</p><p>It went so much better than expected. She had made an impression on Brennan and coincidentally a favorable impression upon the Marchesa. Brennan was feeling distinctly possessive. He held on to her a few moments too long after the dance and seemed unwilling to step away from her side. She finally excused herself to the washroom. He waited nearby, but she\u2019d bet that a lone royal cousin wouldn\u2019t remain unattended for too long, and she proved right. A group of Louisianan ladies surrounded him, and she quietly made her escape.</p><p>She found Sophie at Spider-Sebastian\u2019s table, attentively listening as he debated some point of Louisianan politics with some older man and his entourage. While they made their good nights and said thank-yous for the stream of compliments received, Charlotte composed a devastating chewing-out in her head, which she delivered the moment they stepped into their quarters and shut the door. Sophie listened to every word and at the end hugged her, said, \u201cThank you, you\u2019re the best,\u201d and disappeared into her room.</p><p>Charlotte stood by the door, staring at it for a little while, not sure what to do, and went to take a shower. And now she was soaking her feet.</p><p>Charlotte slumped back in her chair. The room was quiet and dark around her. The glass doors to the balcony were open, and the night wind sifted through the gauzy white drapes. A big, pale moon lit the sky and the stone rail of the balcony. Beyond it, the river stretched, reflecting the moonlight.</p><p>How did she even end up here? Eight weeks ago she was just plain Charlotte living her life quietly in the Edge. Now she was attending a royal wedding, her name out in the open. She thought of Lady Augustine. Her surrogate mother wouldn\u2019t have approved of airing out the name. The moment her adoption was made public, she\u2019d become a target for the enterprising social climbers. But then the name was the least of her worries. She\u2019d broken her oath. Lady Augustine would be horrified to know how far her star pupil had fallen.</p> <p>A rope dropped from above, stretching to the balcony.</p><p>Charlotte blinked.</p><p>The rope was still there.</p><p>Feet in dark boots slid into her view, followed by long, lean legs, followed by narrow hips, a muscular chest clothed in dark fabric. Richard.</p><p>Her heart pounded in her chest. She tried to get up and splashed water all over the plush white rug. Damn it. And now she was swearing in her head. Wonderful.</p><p>Charlotte stepped out of the bath and ran to the balcony on her toes.</p><p>He landed on the rail.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she hissed in a loud whisper.</p> <p>\u201cI had to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Get on that rope. You\u2019re going to ruin everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrennan isn\u2019t everything.\u201d</p><p>His face was sharpened, almost contorted, by desperation.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d she whispered. \u201cDid something bad happen? Are you hurt?\u201d</p><p>He jumped off the rail, pulled her inside the room, and clamped her to him. His mouth found hers, hot, possessive, and demanding. He kissed her as if this was the last time he would see her.</p><p>For a moment she almost melted, but alarm won out. \u201cRichard, you\u2019re scaring me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go away,\u201d he whispered. \u201cLet\u2019s just leave, you and me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I don\u2019t want to lose you. I love you, Charlotte. Come with me.\u201d</p><p>She studied his face. \u201cAre you jealous of Brennan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Oh, for the love of . . . \u201cRichard!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that I can\u2019t give you a title or riches or\u2014\u201d</p><p>She put her hand on his mouth. \u201cShut up. I have a title and riches. You don\u2019t get to abort the plan because you didn\u2019t like that I danced with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou liked it,\u201d he said through her hand.</p><p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou looked like you were enjoying it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was supposed to look like I enjoyed it, you moron. It\u2019s called \u2018acting.\u2019\u201d</p><p>He looked at her, clearly at a loss for words.</p><p>\u201cIf you can go under the knife risking death, I can dance with Brennan and parade in front of him in my underwear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>She shouldn\u2019t have said that.</p><p>\u201cCharlotte?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI let him see me half-undressed. I\u2019ll model it for you later if you wish. Now you need to get out!\u201d She pushed him onto the balcony. \u201cGet out, get out, get out. And take your rope with you. You\u2019re too old for this. I\u2019m too old for this.\u201d She shut the glass doors.</p><p>He stood for a long moment, then jumped, caught the rope, and pulled himself up.</p><p>Charlotte fell backward onto the bed. Idiot. Moron. He scaled the wall for her like some sort of robber-prince from an adventure novel. Climbed a rope in a fit of jealousy. Really, who climbs a rope?</p><p>A knock sounded through her door. Now what? She walked over, pulling her thin robe tighter around herself, and checked the glass window in the door. Brennan.</p><p>\u201cThis is highly improper,\u201d she said through the door.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a highly improper man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho shall remain in the hallway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCharlotte, I just wish to talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne moment.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte walked over to a communicator and dialed the castle staff. The gears spun and a man\u2019s face appeared above the copper half sphere. \u201cAt your service, my lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRobert Brennan is at my door. He wishes to have a conversation. I require an escort.\u201d</p><p>The man turned away for a moment and faced her again. \u201cThe escort has been dispatched. They will be at your door in twenty seconds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>She walked over to the door and peered through the glass. Moments crawled by. She counted to twenty in her head. At eighteen, a man and a woman in castle uniform rounded the corner and came to a halt by her door.</p><p>Charlotte unlocked it.</p><p>Brennan sighed. \u201cChaperones? Are we children?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are adults, which is exactly why I require witnesses.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cDo I scare you, Charlotte?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour Highness, I\u2019ve seen things that would turn most people\u2019s hair white overnight. I don\u2019t fear you. I\u2019m simply being prudent.\u201d</p><p>He tilted his head. \u201cYou undo your hair at night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Wearing her hair down wasn\u2019t one of the best hairstyles for her. She looked much better with an updo, but her scalp did have to rest at some point.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you leave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy ward had enough excitement for the evening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe little girl? Who is she to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s the daughter of a friend. Her mother is dead, and her father is unfit to care for her.\u201d</p><p>Brennan shook his head. \u201cThis would be so much better without an audience.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s precisely why we have one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to continue our acquaintance,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cAre you fond of tea in the morning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn that case, I could give a morning tea tomorrow at ten.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn that case, I would definitely attend. Who else will be there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy ward and I. If you\u2019re planning to attend, perhaps I will invite a couple of other people to maintain propriety.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou seem to be very concerned with propriety.\u201d</p><p>You seem to be very concerned with making a profit on selling children into slavery. \u201cThere are times when I can be inappropriate.\u201d</p><p>A small, hungry light sparked in Brennan\u2019s eyes. \u201cHow inappropriate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you bide your time, perhaps I\u2019ll show you.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cYou\u2019re going to make it into a game, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you choose to look at it that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love games.\u201d He leaned forward, picked up her hand, and kissed her fingers. \u201cI never lose.\u201d</p><p>She leaned toward him and said, pronouncing the words very clearly, \u201cGo to bed, Your Highness.\u201d</p><p>He smiled, a self-satisfied, happy baring of teeth, and headed down the hallway.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said to the escort.</p><p>\u201cOf course, my lady,\u201d they chorused.</p><p>Charlotte shut the door, locked it, turned, and ran into Richard.</p><p>\u201cI told you to leave.\u201d</p><p>He stared at the door with that familiar predatory focus. \u201cI\u2019m going to kill him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you won\u2019t. You will climb your rope and leave.\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t listening to her. He wasn\u2019t even looking at her. He simply moved to the door, and she knew that she had to stop him now, or he would chase after Brennan and fight him, and their entire scheme would crumble. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Charlotte grasped the back of his head and pulled him down toward her. Kissing him was like drinking spiced wine\u2014the heat of him dashed through her, burning through her body. Immediately, she wanted him.</p><p>He wrapped his arms around her, pulling her close. His tongue touched hers, and she shivered. When she opened her eyes, he was looking at her, and this time he did see her.</p><p>\u201cYou have to leave,\u201d she whispered.</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. You must go. What if he goes to find Casside, and you\u2019re gone?\u201d</p><p>His eyes turned dark.</p><p>\u201cLook at me, Richard. You cannot kill Brennan until we expose him. You can\u2019t do it, or it was all for nothing.\u201d She kissed him again, trying to pull him away from the destructive anger. \u201cYou have nothing to worry about.\u201d</p><p>He blinked, like a man waking up from a deep sleep, focusing on her.</p> <p>\u201cYou have nothing to worry about,\u201d she repeated. \u201cI love you, Richard. Go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said I love you, you fool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen this is over\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she told him.</p><p>He stared at her.</p> <p>\u201cThe answer is yes, Richard. Yes, I will go with you and live with you in your Lair, because I love you. Now you must leave. Get out of here!\u201d</p><p>She pushed him out to the balcony, shut the doors, and made sure to lock them.</p><p>Richard looked at her from behind the glass. He had the strangest look on his face, a kind of stunned amazement.</p><p>\u201cGo!\u201d she mouthed at him.</p><p>\u201cI love you, too,\u201d he mouthed, then jumped and climbed back up his rope.</p><p>She crossed the room, fell on her bed, and put a pillow over her face. She felt hot and giddy. He loved her. It made everything worth it.</p><p>What if he stopped being there? What if something happened, and he was gone?</p><p>The anxiety shot her in the heart. Here it is again. Hello there.</p> <p>Please, she prayed silently. Please, please, please, let it be all right. Please, let it all work out.</p><p>Please.</p><p>SIXTEEN</p><p>CHARLOTTE sat in a chaise on her balcony, sipping bloodred tea from her cup and subtly watching Brennan seethe in his chair, directly across the coffee table. To the right Sophie sat quietly reading a book. To the left, on the divan, the Duchess of the Southern Provinces lounged, drinking her tea in tiny swallows and carrying on a conversation.</p><p>He must\u2019ve expected that Sophie and whoever she had invited wouldn\u2019t be much of an obstacle. He could bully most people out of the way by the simple fact of his birth. But Lady Olivia provided an impenetrable barrier. She was older, well regarded, and her influence and power surpassed his. His Highness was forced to behave, and he didn\u2019t like it. The small talk was clearly grating on him. He was desperately bored.</p><p>Almost bored enough to pick up the album she had placed on the coffee table within his reach. A foot long by a foot wide, bound in luxurious brown leather and embossed with a silver serpent biting his own tail, a symbol of the Ganer College, the album held approximately eighty pages of heavyweight paper interweaved with glassine tissue. It beckoned to be picked up.</p><p>Just a little more, Charlotte thought. A little longer.</p><p>Lady Olivia launched into a discussion of the agricultural properties of oranges.</p><p>Brennan hid a yawn, leaned forward . . . and picked up the album.</p><p>Lady Olivia glanced at Charlotte and took a moment to snack on cookies.</p><p>\u201cWhat an exquisite book,\u201d Brennan said, obviously relieved at the opportunity to jump-start the conversation. \u201cAre these members of your family?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, my lord.\u201d Charlotte sipped her tea. \u201cThey are my greatest triumphs as a healer. The truth is, we are a vain lot.\u201d</p><p>Brennan turned the page and winced. \u201cDear gods, this child is horribly burned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn unfortunate accident,\u201d Charlotte said. \u201cShe was trapped in a barn during a brush fire that had overtaken the village. If you turn the page, you will see that she was considerably better after I was done. Burns are difficult to heal completely, but we had a modest success with her.\u201d</p><p>Brennan turned the page. \u201cThis is uncanny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou give yourself too little credit, my dear,\u201d the duchess murmured.</p><p>She had to keep him looking through the book. \u201cI believe there is a worse case a little further.\u201d</p><p>Brennan flipped a page. Another. Another. His hand froze.</p><p>Bull\u2019s-eye.</p><p>\u201cThis man.\u201d Brennan turned the album, holding it with one hand so she could see it. A picture of Richard looked back at her. He looked a few years younger. His hair was longer, but the image bore an unmistakable resemblance to the poster of Hunter.</p><p>Brennan\u2019s quiet voice held the steel overtone of command. \u201cTell me about this man.\u201d</p><p>Lady Olivia raised her eyebrows. Charlotte leaned forward, looking at the image. \u201cThis isn\u2019t one of the worst cases.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease. Indulge me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well. He was a soldier, one of those extremely dangerous, covert types. You know, the sort who are released into the woods with nothing but a knife and a length of rope and retrieved a week later, after they have single-handedly demolished an enemy legion. He\u2019d been very badly wounded. His liver and kidney had been sliced through with a spear, and by the time he was brought to me, he was delirious. He kept recounting his proudest moments in life\u2014being chosen for his unit, his son\u2019s being born, and Lord Maedoc presenting him with the Shield of Valor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you certain?\u201d Brennan\u2019s face had gone completely flat.</p><p>\u201cYes. Fever does strange things to the mind. He went on and on about his son\u2019s eyes and Lord Maedoc\u2019s demeanor. I believe he got to spend some time with Lord Maedoc after the ceremony, and it was the highlight of his service. His healing took approximately sixteen hours. I was exhausted and had to rest. When I came to check on him the next day, some soldiers had collected him and left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaedoc?\u201d Brennan repeated. \u201cWas that their commanding officer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I was upset that the College released him\u2014he was in no shape to travel, really\u2014and so I made the staff get the release order so I could check the seal on it. Is this important?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all.\u201d Brennan shut the album and turned to Lady Olivia. \u201cYou were telling us about oranges, Your Grace?\u201d</p><p>RICHARD studied himself in the mirror. The man who looked back at him was nothing like him. Stolen face, stolen clothes, another man\u2019s sword. They were tools, he told himself. Tools of his trade. She loved him anyway. She loved him.</p><p>Someone knocked on the door in a rapid staccato. Kolin, his second cousin, glanced at him. Richard nodded. Kolin swung the door open.</p><p>Brennan strode in, almost knocking Kolin over. His face shone with grim determination. Behind him Rene paused at the doorway, his face bloodless.</p><p>\u201cGet your sword and come with me,\u201d Brennan said.</p><p>\u201cDid something happen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCasside, get your sword.\u201d</p><p>Richard belted his rapier on. Brennan spun on his foot and marched out. Richard followed him, striding side by side with Rene down the hallway. They climbed the ladder, crossed another hallway, and stepped into a metal-and-glass lift. Brennan punched a code into the panel, and the small cabin slid upward. Stone flashed by, then daylight streamed in. They were rising straight up the side of the castle.</p><p>\u201cHunter belongs to Maedoc,\u201d Brennan said. \u201cHe\u2019s his creature.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d Rene asked.</p><p>Brennan turned to him, his face skewed by fury, and Rene took a step back.</p><p>\u201cIt was quite clever of him. Use the Hunter to destabilize the slave trade, make me appear weak, foster the discontent as all of us lost money. I thought he was too limited for a plan like this, but he fooled us all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d Rene asked, a note of anxiety in his voice.</p><p>\u201cNot just me. All of us.\u201d</p><p>The cabin stopped. The gears in the wall turned, the doors opened, and they stepped out onto a narrow balcony, overshadowed by a spire. Far below, the river glistened. They were at the very top of the castle.</p><p>At the other end of the balcony, Maedoc and Angelia stood by the stone rail. Angelia\u2019s face was bloodless. Fear shivered in her eyes like a small animal trapped in a corner.</p><p>\u201cWhat was so important?\u201d Maedoc asked.</p><p>She pointed at them.</p><p>Maedoc turned. \u201cBrennan? What\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have a traitor,\u201d Brennan said, closing the distance between them. \u201cThe one who\u2019s behind Hunter and the attack on the island.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d Maedoc frowned.</p><p>Brennan jerked a dagger from his sheath and thrust it in Maedoc\u2019s right side.</p><p>Angelia choked on a scream.</p><p>Brennan pulled the dagger down through the flesh with a sharp jerk, his face inches from Maedoc\u2019s shocked eyes, and pulled the blade out. The initial thrust probably punctured the lung, Richard decided. The rip lacerated Maedoc\u2019s liver.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Rene squeezed out. \u201cRobert, what are you . . .\u201d</p><p>Maedoc sank against the rail, struggling to stay upright. Brennan stepped over to Rene and thrust the bloody dagger into his hand. \u201cYour turn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour turn, you spineless shit. We\u2019re in this together. Do it or join him.\u201d</p><p>Rene stared at Maedoc. The big man raised his left hand, his right clutching the rail. \u201cDon\u2019t . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will not suffer traitors in my house! Do it!\u201d Brennan barked.</p><p>Rene stabbed Maedoc in the stomach. Blood spurted, drenching the dagger\u2019s handle.</p><p>The soldier cried out.</p><p>Rene dropped the dagger and stumbled away. Brennan picked it up and turned to Angelia. \u201cYou\u2019re next, my lovely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She backed way. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Brennan\u2019s voice vibrated with fury. \u201cI\u2019ll help you.\u201d</p><p>He grabbed her hand with his bloody fingers, slapped the dagger into it, and locked her fingers around it with his hand, moving behind her, pushing her toward Maedoc. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d she moaned.</p><p>Bile rose in Richard\u2019s throat. Finally, the mask had ripped open. Brennan was flying his true colors. To kill a man in a fair fight was one thing, but this\u2014this was a sickening, perverse butchery.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d Brennan said in her ear, holding her from behind in a half embrace. \u201cFor once, you\u2019ll be the one who gets to stick it in. It\u2019s not hard.\u201d</p> <p>Brennan forced her forward, raised her hand with his, and stabbed Maedoc in the chest. Blood gushed. Maedoc groaned.</p><p>Angelia whimpered.</p><p>\u201cOh no, there is a little bit of blood,\u201d Brennan said. \u201cBut you can handle it, can\u2019t you? You think all that money that poured into your accounts isn\u2019t bloody? You think those shiny stones in your ears aren\u2019t soaked in it?\u201d</p><p>She tore away from him.</p><p>Brennan turned to Richard and held out the dagger. \u201cCasside. Join us, my friend.\u201d</p> <p>Richard strode forward, took the dagger, and thrust, between the ribs and up, piercing the heart. Maedoc gasped and sagged to the stone. The light went out of his eyes. The torture was over.</p><p>Brennan stared at the prone body. \u201cLook, the three of you. Look very well. You all did this with me. Now we\u2019re bound by blood.\u201d</p><p>Angelia hid her face in her hands and wept.</p><p>\u201cTake his legs.\u201d</p><p>Richard picked up Maedoc\u2019s legs. Brennan slid his hands under Maedoc\u2019s arms. They heaved and threw the body over the balcony into the river below. Brennan picked up the dagger, wiped it on a handkerchief, and hurled it into the water. The blade caught the sunlight, sparking as it flew, and vanished far below.</p><p>Rene hugged Angelia and drew her toward the lift. Richard followed them. Brennan remained at the rail, his back to them, his arms crossed.</p> <p>\u201cHe is crazy,\u201d Angelia sobbed in the lift. \u201cHe\u2019s gone crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will be all right,\u201d Rene told her.</p><p>It wouldn\u2019t be all right. The house of cards Brennan had built was tumbling down, and Richard was waiting for the right moment to set it on fire. And as the lift slid down, he thought of a perfect way to do just that.</p><p>Five minutes later, Richard walked into his quarters. \u201cGeorge! I know you\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>A mouse scuttled out from under a bookshelf.</p><p>\u201cFind my brother,\u201d Richard said. \u201cWe have things to arrange.\u201d</p><p>GEORGE stood in the shadows, leaning on the column, and watched the dining hall fill with people. The ridiculously pretentious book he\u2019d read on Pierre de Rivi\u00e8re claimed that the Grand Dining Hall was a room of \u201calmost painful elegance.\u201d It wasn\u2019t. It was a room of opulent old wealth.</p><p>The pale walls rose fifty feet high, reaching a glass ceiling so clear, it was invisible except for the three enormous chandeliers suspended from it. Each twelve-foot-wide chandelier was woven of hair-thin metal-and-glass strands in a perfect imitation of a cloud backlit by sunlight. Thousands of crystals suspended by thin wires cascaded from the chandelier, like rainbow-hued raindrops. The wires were invisible from the floor, and looking up gave one an illusion of standing under a spring shower.</p> <p>The floor was seamless cream marble shot through with veins of silver and gold. Beautiful ornate vines cast out of bronze climbed the walls, bearing crystal- and gemstone-studded flowers. The same vine pattern decorated the chairs and the tables, shrouded in silk cloth. The book claimed that no two chairs in the dining hall were alike. Looking at the detail of the tiny leaves and buds, George believed it. The plates were silver, and the silverware had a gold tint. The room itself was enormous, and a full floor-to-ceiling mirror to his right reflected the space, making it appear even larger.</p><p>This space wasn\u2019t just old, it was timeless. It would never go out of style by virtue of the wealth concentrated within it. It was a room built by old rich men and women to entertain other rich men and women, none of whom had ever tasted poverty. Just one of those flowers or plates would feed an Edge family for a week. The amount of food they would throw away after the bluebloods were done picking at their plates could sustain a small Edge town for a day.</p><p>He had known crushing poverty. He remembered it keenly, and this display of lavish luxury made him nauseous.</p><p>Torn shreds of conversation floated about.</p><p>\u201c. . . found the body . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201c. . . water. Stabbed a dozen times . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cGods, how horrible . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201c. . . the wedding might be postponed . . .\u201d</p><p>He caught sight of Charlotte and Sophie. Sophie was walking their dog on a beautiful leash with silver metalwork. The leash looked like it should belong to a fluffy ten-pound puppy with delicate paws and manicured claws. Seeing a large, muscular dog on its end was disconcerting.</p><p>Charlotte and Sophie took their seats next to a blond blueblood. He turned, displaying a familiar profile. Spider. Also known as the Count of Belidor. Sophie murmured something. He leaned over with an almost paternal expression on his face and said something. She nodded.</p><p>It must\u2019ve hurt her to sit close to him. George had tried to talk to her about it last night, as much of a conversation as one could manage when one communicated by means of a dead squirrel and voice projection. She said it was so painful, it was almost sweet. He thought about it for a while, but he still couldn\u2019t figure out what she\u2019d meant.</p><p>He saw Jack drift in through the doors. He moved quietly, sliding between groups of people, and nobody paid him any mind, as if he were invisible. A moment later he stopped next to him. \u201cHey, Ugly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you smell it on me?\u201d</p><p>George gave him a look. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>They had spent the last three hours in the room behind the mirror. It was a narrow space used mostly by staff and currently empty. The two of them and Kaldar had pulled apart the thin wooden panels until the back of the mirror was exposed, stripped the protective paint layer, then sprayed a silver solvent on the back of the mirror, turning the reflective surface into simple glass.</p><p>Kaldar had raided the Mirror\u2019s stash of gadgets, and they attached four barrier generators on the back of the now-transparent glass, stretching a spell across its back surface. As long as the room remained undisturbed, nobody would be able to tell that the mirror had been tampered with. Immediately after they finished the job, Jack began obsessing that he had a chemical smell. Normally, George tolerated his brother\u2019s quirks, but at the moment they had bigger things to worry about.</p><p>\u201cDo you think it will work?\u201d Jack asked.</p><p>\u201cIf this doesn\u2019t work, I\u2019ll kill him myself.\u201d</p><p>George didn\u2019t need to specify\u2014\u201chim\u201d meant Brennan. Brennan was the root of the evil that had damaged their lives. Too many people had suffered, too many had died. He couldn\u2019t be allowed to exist.</p><p>\u201cAgreed,\u201d Jack said. \u201cWe\u2019ll do it together.\u201d</p><p>Across the hall, Richard stepped inside. He saw Rene and Angelia standing together in the corner and walked in the opposite direction, taking position against a column, much like George\u2019s.</p><p>The Grand Thane walked into the lobby, the Marchesa on his arm. The conversation died. The older man led his bride-to-be to the center of the room, to their table, and sat. Brennan followed him among the other bluebloods, taking the seat at a table nearby. His face wore a solemn expression.</p><p>Jack bared his teeth, quick like a knife cut, and hid them again.</p><p>\u201cCome on.\u201d George pushed away from the column, and they walked to their seats at their assigned table next to the Duchess of the Southern Provinces.</p><p>\u201cBoys,\u201d she greeted them with a smile.</p><p>\u201cMy lady.\u201d They both bowed.</p><p>\u201cPlease sit down.\u201d</p><p>They sat.</p><p>\u201cHow is it going?\u201d Lady Olivia asked quietly.</p><p>\u201cWell so far,\u201d George answered. The most difficult thing about Brennan was that he made an unpredictable opponent. The murder of Maedoc had proven that. What they were about to do was calculated to unbalance him, make him spin out of his orbit, and once he did, he would become a human wrecking ball, destroying everything in his path.</p><p>A tall man in the uniform of the Castle Guard strode into the room and onto the raised platform at the front. \u201cMy lords and ladies, may I have a moment of your time.\u201d</p><p>Quiet fell onto the gathering.</p><p>\u201cMy name is Celire Lakita. I\u2019m in charge of the security for the Pierre de Rivi\u00e8re. This morning, a murder occurred on these premises.\u201d</p><p>Nobody gasped. Everybody had already heard the news.</p><p>\u201cI want to assure you that your safety isn\u2019t in question.\u201d Celire paused. \u201cWe know that the murder took place on the Upper Northern Balcony. We know that four assailants were involved. We know why it occurred. We know who is responsible.\u201d</p><p>George focused on Brennan. The big man sat absolutely still, his face a cold mask.</p><p>\u201cI will now speak to the killers directly.\u201d Celire looked at the gathering. \u201cWe know who you are. Rest assured that this matter will be resolved by the day\u2019s end. Attempting to escape is futile\u2014you will note increased security presence in the hallways. You have until this evening to make things easier on yourself and retain some small measure of dignity. If you don\u2019t cooperate, your fellow conspirators will. The measure of my mercy is small and dwindling by the minute. To the rest of you, please enjoy your meal.\u201d</p><p>He stepped down.</p><p>The hall buzzed with a dozen simultaneously started conversations. It was a carefully crafted speech. Kaldar and Richard had spent forty-five minutes writing it. Once Kaldar flashed his Mirror credentials and dangled the possible arrest of Maedoc\u2019s murderers in front of Celire, the head of castle security proved more than willing to play his part in laying the trap. Now, Brennan had to react.</p><p>Do it, George willed silently, staring at Brennan\u2019s back. Do it. You know you want to talk to them.</p><p>Brennan flicked open a pen.</p><p>\u201cPen,\u201d Jack murmured.</p><p>\u201cI see it.\u201d</p><p>Brennan wrote something on a piece of paper and flagged down a waiter. The waiter weaved his way to the table where Rene and Angelia sat together. The waiter dropped off the note. Rene looked at it. His face turned pale. He passed the note to Angelia. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Five minutes later, he sent one of his own. The second note arrived at Richard\u2019s table. He folded his napkin, rose, and walked out.</p><p>Three minutes later Angelia rose. Rene carefully escorted her to the door. Brennan was the last to leave.</p><p>He had to take them to the side room. It was the only private room quickly accessible from the Grand Dining Hall. Security blocked the hallway on the left, and the hallway on the right opened into staff areas and kitchens filled with people.</p> <p>The mirror shivered. Someone had opened the side room\u2019s door, and the draft had disturbed the delicate web of the spell.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Jack hissed.</p><p>The spell tore like a film of oil being swept from the water\u2019s surface. The mirror vanished, revealing a perfectly transparent sheet of glass and Brennan behind it. Rage distorted his face. Angelia flattened herself against the wall. Rene bristled. Richard remained impassive, like a dark shadow. He was looking straight at the dining room. No alarm registered on his face. The spell must\u2019ve worked as intended\u2014from inside the side room, the glass still appeared to be mirrored.</p><p>\u201cThey know nothing,\u201d Brennan snarled, his voice slightly muffled but clearly recognizable as it issued from the grates hidden among the ornaments on the wall. \u201cThey have nothing, they know nothing, they are lying.\u201d</p><p>The Grand Thane raised his hand. The noise in the dining hall died, as if cut off by a sword.</p> <p>\u201cWake up!\u201d Rene snapped. \u201cThey know. We should deal.\u201d</p><p>Brennan hammered a punch into Rene\u2019s jaw. The blond man staggered back.</p><p>\u201cNow you listen to me, all of you.\u201d Brennan barked. \u201cThere will be no deals. Don\u2019t speak to anyone, don\u2019t say anything, don\u2019t even break wind without clearing it with me first. If you do, I will crush you. Don\u2019t think for a second that you will get out of this unscathed, while I\u2019ll go down. I\u2019m a royal peer of the realm. You\u2019re nothing. You\u2019re trash.\u201d</p><p>He spun to Angelia. \u201cYou\u2019re a whore who can\u2019t keep her legs together. You\u201d\u2014he turned to Rene\u2014\u201care a fop and a weakling.\u201d He faced Richard. \u201cYou\u2019re a greedy coward. I can replace every one of you, and there will be a dozen fighting to take your places. I made you what you are. I took the fractured bandits and scum and molded them into a military force. Not a single slave was sold on this coast in the last five years without my getting a cut. I command three hundred slavers. I own the seaboard. I am the real power.\u201d</p><p>The Grand Thane rose. His eyes bulged. His face turned purple with rage. George felt an overpowering urge to be very quiet and small.</p><p>\u201cYou want to open your mouths? Try it. You won\u2019t live to see the sunset. Do you hear me?\u201d</p> <p>The Grand Thane started toward the glass.</p><p>Brennan spun, his eyes deranged. \u201cYou will be lucky if I kill you. I may just strip you of everything you are. I\u2019ll have you sold to the vilest degenerate I can find. You\u2019ll end your days drowning in the basest of perversities, kept on a chain for his amusement\u2014\u201d</p><p>The Grand Thane grabbed the nearest chair, almost as an afterthought, and smashed it into the glass. Shards rained down, scattering across the floor. Suddenly, the two rooms became one. Brennan saw everyone in the dining hall looking at him and froze.</p><p>\u201cYou vain, pathetic brat,\u201d the Grand Thane roared.</p><p>Brennan reached for his sword. \u201cDon\u2019t put your hands on me, old man!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThese hands will end you, boy!\u201d</p><p>Rene put his hand on the hilt of his sword.</p><p>A hair-thin streak of pure white flash pulsed from the left, and hit Rene\u2019s hand. Blood poured. Rene screamed.</p> <p>At the far table, Lorameh stood calmly, white lightning dancing on his fingers. There was something familiar about his face. The recognition hit George like a punch. \u201cErwin!\u201d</p><p>The man had been his supervisor for two years. How the hell did he not recognize him? He wasn\u2019t even wearing much of a disguise.</p><p>\u201cOf course, it\u2019s Erwin,\u201d Jack said. \u201cHe smells the same. Did you just now figure it out?\u201d</p><p>Magic sparked in Brennan\u2019s eyes. A shield of white cloaked him.</p><p>The Grand Thane planted his feet.</p><p>Richard backed out of the room into the hallway.</p><p>White streaks of lightning clutched at the Grand Thane\u2019s hair. An enormous magical pressure built around him, winding about the old man like a cocoon streaked with radiant veins of power. Shit.</p><p>People at the front tables scrambled away.</p><p>\u201cWe have to go!\u201d Jack jumped up.</p><p>\u201cNo need,\u201d Lady Olivia said.</p><p>A whip of white lightning shot from Brennan at the Grand Thane\u2019s chest and bounced off. He\u2019d actually tried to kill his own grandfather.</p><p>\u201cI began you,\u201d the Grand Thane thundered. \u201cI will end you, whelp!\u201d</p><p>He opened his arms, his palms up. A brilliant ball of coiled magic spun between them.</p><p>\u201cStay close to me, children,\u201d Lady Olivia said.</p><p>Kaldar popped up between the tables and dashed over to them.</p><p>A wall of white sheathed Brennan.</p><p>The pressurized cocoon of magic tore. A torrent of power ripped out of the Grand Thane. The flash explosion smashed into Brennan.</p><p>Kaldar landed between Jack and George. George braced for the blast wave. His flash shield was strong, but he wasn\u2019t sure it would hold.</p><p>A sphere of white unfolded from Lady Olivia, encasing the table. Around them, tables flew back, as if slapped by a giant\u2019s hand. The duchess sipped from her cup.</p><p>The sphere melted.</p><p>The walls of the side room had disappeared. A colossal hole gaped in the side of the castle. Angelia lay on the floor. Rene was crouched against a sidewall. Brennan stood, unharmed. He\u2019d shielded himself and Rene, who\u2019d hidden directly behind him.</p><p>Brennan unsheathed his blade. \u201cIs that it, old man? That\u2019s all?\u201d</p><p>No more magic. It must\u2019ve taken all of Brennan\u2019s power to shield himself.</p><p>The Grand Thane had no sword.</p><p>Brennan struck, a fast overhand blow. His sword gleamed in the sun and clanged against Richard\u2019s blade. It wasn\u2019t Casside\u2019s rapier but Richard\u2019s own sword.</p><p>Richard\u2019s jacket was gone. He wore a loose white shirt. Tiny red dots marked Richard\u2019s face and hands. Blood, George realized. Richard\u2019s flash screen was weak. He had managed to block enough of the Grand Thane\u2019s explosion to survive the blast, but it had cost him, and now he was bleeding from every pore. They called it flash punch, a sure sign that his magic was expended\u2014and so was Brennan\u2019s. Without their magic, if they fought now, it would be down to sword against sword.</p><p>Brennan\u2019s eyes bulged. \u201cCasside, what the hell are you doing? Have you lost your mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not Casside.\u201d Richard glanced at the Grand Thane, a question obvious on his face. The old noble pondered him for a moment.</p><p>Let him do this, George willed. He needs this.</p><p>\u201cYou have my permission,\u201d the Grand Thane rumbled.</p><p>Richard stepped between the old man and Brennan.</p><p>To the left, Charlotte jumped to her feet and stood utterly still.</p><p>Brennan stepped back, raising his sword. It was a plain, functional sword of a simple but brutal design that had served Brennans for centuries, carving their path to the throne. It had a thirty-five-and-a-half-inch double-edged blade, sharp and polished to a satin smoothness; a ten-inch hilt with a seven-and-a-half-inch grip, wrapped in plain leather cord that allowed Brennan to wield the sword one- or two-handed; a round pommel and cross-guard. George had held a sword like that before, made by the same smith\u2014Declan had it in his armory. The balance of the blade was at five and a half inches, and it weighed about two and a half pounds, a combination that made the sword nimble despite its size. Holding it in his hand had made him feel indestructible.</p><p>Richard\u2019s sword was single-edged and curved ever so slightly. It was razor-sharp, weighed only a pound, with a twenty-five-and-a-half-inch blade, and a four-inch grip. Brennan\u2019s sword was ten inches longer, a pound heavier, but also slower, a powerful butcher blade to Richard\u2019s sleek scalpel.</p><p>Brennan slashed to the right, aiming for Richard\u2019s right side, just below the ribs. Richard moved to parry, but instead of following through, Brennan reversed the strike and lashed at Richard\u2019s left. Richard brought his sword across, point down, meeting Brennan\u2019s blade just in time. Brennan was testing for speed, George realized.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re not Casside, then who are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou call me Hunter.\u201d</p><p>Brennan struck again, the sword dancing in his hand. Right slash, left slash, right slash, left. The swords rang from each other. Richard moved back under the onslaught, his movements short, economical. Brennan drove him across the room. Blades flashed, Richard moved a touch too slow, and the point of Brennan\u2019s sword grazed his shoulder. Blood swelled across the white sleeve. Damn it.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Jack growled.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just a paper cut. He\u2019s fine.\u201d First blood was to Brennan. Not a good sign. George\u2019s pulse rose. Richard couldn\u2019t lose. He simply couldn\u2019t lose this fight.</p><p>The two men circled each other like two predators stalking. Richard, a lean wolf, and Brennan, a pampered tiger.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Brennan asked.</p><p>\u201cYou profit from the sale of human beings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA true believer, then.\u201d Brennan bared his teeth. \u201cAnd who are you to judge me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a man,\u201d Richard said.</p><p>Brennan grasped the sword in both hands and struck, bringing it in a circular motion across Richard\u2019s chest. Richard moved back, and the sword whistled past his shirt. Brennan reversed the swing and struck diagonally down. Richard parried, deflecting the blow with the flat of his blade. Steel rang. Richard staggered back. Brennan was bigger and at least thirty pounds heavier, all of it solid muscle. George knew Richard had ungodly stamina, but the flash punch had clearly taken its toll.</p><p>Brennan swung again, a high, horizontal cut. Richard parried in a clamor of steel. They crossed swords again and again, blocking with the flats of their blades. Brennan grunted and hammered at Richard, blow after blow, sinking his enormous strength into it. Richard was backing away, staggered by the hits. George clenched his fists. Get out of there. He\u2019s going to pin you against the wall.

He wants to end it fast.\u201d</p><p>Brennan was familiar with all the techniques of proper swordplay\u2014and knew all the tricks as well. Members of his family received expert instruction in the martial arts from early childhood. George hadn\u2019t been allowed to start practicing until he was nine. At his age, Brennan had already been learning swordplay for six years. He was banking on his raw power now. This wasn\u2019t a duel; this was a fight to the death, fast and brutal. Only one would walk away, and Richard looked desperate.</p> <p>Brennan cut Richard\u2019s right shoulder. Another graze. Damn it. George hid a growl. He wanted to run out there on the floor and finish this.</p><p>Jack tensed next to him, gathering himself like a cat before a pounce.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare,\u201d the duchess said. Hearing her voice was like getting a bucket of ice water dumped on him. George recoiled.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t your fight. You must stay out of it.\u201d</p><p>Brennan slammed his shoulder into Richard, shoving him back. Richard crashed into the wall.</p> <p>Get out, get out, get out . . .</p><p>Brennan thrust. Richard knocked his blade aside and spun left, breaking free.</p><p>Brennan pulled a dagger from the sheath on his belt. The brute assault had failed. He was going for the smarter plan now. Brennan cut from the right. Richard deflected the blade, and Brennan slashed his hand with the dagger, flinging blood into the air.</p><p>Argh!</p><p>Richard spun and thrust. Brennan knocked the blade aside and carved at the inside of Richard\u2019s forearm. The sword hand was vital. One cut in the right place, and Richard would lose mobility, strength, or his sword altogether. Brennan was taking him apart piece by piece. Richard looked like he was on his last breath. He was slowing down. His shirt was crimson with blood.</p><p>Another cut. Damn it all to hell.</p> <p>Brennan sensed weakness, like a shark senses blood in the water. He slashed in a wide, horizontal cut, left to right. Richard leaned back with sudden speed. The sword sliced empty air. Richard clamped his left hand on Brennan\u2019s sword wrist. Brennan lunged with the dagger, striving to drive it into Richard\u2019s throat. Richard ducked under the blow and rammed the pommel of his sword under Brennan\u2019s chin. Blood spilled from Brennan\u2019s mouth. He jerked back, and Richard sliced across the inside of his left biceps. Brennan dropped the dagger and stumbled back. \u201cWho are you?\u201d he gasped.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m an Edger, a nobody. You preyed on my people, so I took it all away from you. I killed your crews, I destroyed your island, I misled you into thinking Maedoc was a traitor. The pieces of your kingdom are crashing down around you because I made it happen.\u201d</p><p>Brennan growled, spitting blood. \u201cI\u2019ll kill you, you piece of Edge shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll never rule,\u201d Richard snarled back. \u201cYou\u2019re unfit.\u201d</p><p>Brennan lunged into a furious melee. His sword shone, slicing in wide arcs: left, right, left. Richard deflected. Brennan head-butted him. Richard scoured Brennan\u2019s side. They clashed again, bloodied, focused only on each other. The ringing of steel on steel was like a heartbeat.</p><p>Brennan made another slash at Richard\u2019s neck. All his blows were above the chest, George realized. Enemy fixation. He had heard about it but had never seen it. In this moment, Brennan hated Richard so much that he was unable to look away from his face. All his cuts were designed to chop Richard\u2019s head off.</p><p>Richard spun out of the way and hammered a kick into Brennan\u2019s side. The bigger man took a step back. The point of his sword drooped. Tired! He was tired. The blade was slow to come up.</p><p>Brennan exhaled, blood bubbling on his lips, and charged. Richard let him come and slashed at Brennan\u2019s stomach in a lightning cut.</p> <p>Brennan stumbled, clamping his arm to his stomach, trying to hold his guts inside. Richard paced back and forth, stalking him like a lean, hungry wolf hounding a lame bear. The bigger man tried to straighten. Richard dropped down, almost to his knees, and sliced across Brennan\u2019s legs, left-right, his sword blurring.</p><p>Brennan staggered. The fabric of his pants split, showing crisscrossing cuts. Blood swelled. He growled and sank to his knees. Richard hammered a knee to his face. Brennan toppled over. Richard flicked the blood off his sword with a sharp jerk and looked at Charlotte.</p><p>She still stood at the table, so pale, she looked bloodless. Slowly, Richard raised his sword in a kind of salute.</p><p>The Grand Thane boomed. \u201cSomeone, take out this garbage.\u201d</p><p>Celire appeared, backed by half a dozen guards. They swarmed Brennan. Three swords pointed at Richard.</p><p>\u201cNot him,\u201d the Great Thane said. \u201cHe can go.\u201d</p><p>Richard bowed his head. The guards parted, and he strode toward them.</p><p>\u201cA disgrace.\u201d Erwin said. George turned. The spy was standing at their table. He looked a lot less like Lorameh and very much like Erwin. Some sort of magic had to be at work here. He would have to get to the bottom of it.</p><p>\u201cErwin?\u201d Kaldar peered at him. \u201cYou\u2019re Lorameh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I am. What part of back off was unclear to you? I have sat on Brennan for ten months, building my case so I can bring him in quietly, without scandal and embarrassment to the realm.\u201d Erwin raised his arm, indicating the wrecked dining hall. \u201cThis is exactly what I was trying to avoid.\u201d</p><p>Richard reached them. \u201cWhere is Charlotte?\u201d</p><p>George glanced at Charlotte\u2019s table. It was empty. Charlotte was gone. So was Sophie\u2014and so was Spider.</p><p>\u201cShe was just here,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cJack!\u201d Richard barked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on it.\u201d Jack dashed through the dining hall, crouched at the table, inhaled and pointed to the doorway. \u201cRight hallway.\u201d</p><p>Richard sprinted across the hall.</p><p>\u201cMY lord!\u201d Sophie called out.</p><p>Spider stopped and turned. He was midway through the gardens, and as he spun on his foot to face her, the gorgeous flowerbeds framed him. He seemed an elegant painting, drenched in sunlight. She let the dog off the leash.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here, Sophie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was scared when the screaming started,\u201d she said. \u201cI ran out and saw you walking away.\u201d</p><p>He raised his hand, inviting her to walk next to him. She caught up, and, together, they strolled down the winding path. The dog ran sideways to investigate some flowers.</p><p>\u201cI see you brought your dog. Have you finally settled on a name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I think we should call him Callis.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter the Grand Thane?\u201d Spider smiled.</p><p>\u201cThey have the same type of rough dignity. Where are you going?\u201d</p><p>The stiff blade of her short sword, the only weapon that could be hidden in her dress, was warm against her thigh. Roses bloomed on both sides of the path, pink, dark red, and cream, their velvet petals sending a refined perfume into the air.</p><p>\u201cI came here to disrupt this wedding,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cBut why? Don\u2019t you like the Marchesa?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do. I\u2019m very fond of her, in fact. She is a beautiful example of the best noble blood has to offer. But I\u2019m a patriot, my dear. And sometimes the needs of my country conflict with my personal likes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand,\u201d she said. \u201cDuty.\u201d He wasn\u2019t a monster by choice, oh no. He was a patriot. The only difference between a common psychotic sadistic murderer and Spider was he had Louisiana\u2019s mandate to be one.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Spider nodded. \u201cThe Marchesa has great land holdings. It wasn\u2019t in our best interests to let those lands fall under Adrianglian influence. I was planning something quite spectacular. But a true professional knows when he is beaten. They have created such a glorious chaos on their own, I can\u2019t possibly contribute anything else to it. It\u2019s time for me to walk off the stage.\u201d</p><p>He stopped. They stood in the very center of the garden, where the path formed a ring.</p><p>\u201cI very much enjoyed your company. You\u2019re very intelligent,\u201d Spider said. \u201cYou have the ability to reason and keep an open mind. If you develop ambition, it will carry you far. I wish you the best of luck, my dear. I will keep an eye on you if I can. I\u2019m interested to see how far you will go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow does one develop ambition?\u201d</p><p>He tilted his head. \u201cHave you ever wanted something? Something you know you can\u2019t have? Something that is your heart\u2019s desire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cConvince yourself that you should have it. Realize that it is yours by the right of your might or intelligence or simple desire. Reach for it and take it. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>Oh, she understood. She understood quite well.</p><p>\u201cFarewell.\u201d He turned away. He was about to walk out of the garden. She might never get another opportunity like this.</p><p>\u201cLord Sebastian?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>She sank her hand into the hidden fold of her skirt. \u201cWould you like to know what my heart\u2019s desire is?\u201d</p><p>Spider turned to her, a light smile on his lips. \u201cVery well. What is it, sweetheart?\u201d</p><p>She thrust her knife into his chest, stretching the flash across the blade in a tiny fraction of a second.</p><p>Spider gasped.</p><p>She clamped him to her and tore the blade through his innards, mincing soft organ tissue. Blood poured from Spider\u2019s lips, his face stunned with disbelief.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s to watch you die, you piece of shit,\u201d she said. \u201cYou fused my mother.\u201d</p><p>He lunged forward, impaling himself deeper on the blade. His hand clamped her throat, squeezing it in a steel grasp. Her air vanished. Don\u2019t panic. Whatever you do, don\u2019t panic.</p><p>\u201cSophie Mar, I take it.\u201d His voice was a ragged, inhuman growl. His eyes bored into her. The world was fading into darkness. \u201cWell played, my little one. Well played.\u201d</p><p>She freed the sword with a sharp tug. The air in her lungs boiled.</p><p>\u201cYou have no idea how much I loathe your family.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Out of the corner of her eye she saw a black blur dart across the grass. Callis rammed Spider and clamped his teeth on his right forearm, adding his hundred pounds to Sophie\u2019s weight. Spider groaned. His fingers opened, releasing her throat. She fell and landed into a crouch, gasping for air. She needed to move, but her body refused to do anything but breathe, wasting precious seconds.</p><p>Callis snarled, pulling at Spider, trying to yank him off his feet. With his left hand, Spider jerked a blade from the sheath at his waist and bashed the dog over the head. Callis growled. Spider sank his blade into the dark fur of Callis\u2019s back, and it came out crimson.</p><p>No! You don\u2019t get to kill my dog! Her legs finally obeyed. She sprang up, sword raised, and slashed across his ribs. Why in the world wasn\u2019t he dead? What if he couldn\u2019t die?</p> <p>He kicked Callis aside. The dog dropped to the ground with a vicious snarl and tried to lunge.</p><p>\u201cNo! Mine,\u201d she told him.</p><p>Spider laughed. \u201cLet\u2019s see what you\u2019re capable off.\u201d He struck. He was fast, so fast; he might have been almost as fast as Richard.</p><p>She parried and slashed at his shoulder, cutting a gash in his doublet. Blood swelled. Not deep enough. Her sword was too short. He sliced at her in a vicious, horizontal cut. She had no way to dodge to the side, so she bent back. Pain seared her just under the collarbone. The tip of his blade had cut across the exposed top of her chest. Blood poured onto her gown. As he finished the strike, she grasped his wrist with her left hand and sliced across his chest. The flash-sharpened blade cut through his ribs.</p><p>Spider snarled. He was still standing.</p> <p>\u201cNot good enough, Sophie Mar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood enough for you. You don\u2019t get to take anything else from me.\u201d</p><p>He laughed.</p><p>\u201cDie.\u201d She cut him again. \u201cDie, die, die!\u201d</p><p>He stumbled back and kept laughing.</p><p>She slashed at him again and again, becoming a whirlwind, her blade an extension of her, bound to her by her magic. She cut him again and again, oblivious to the wounds she took.</p> <p>Finally, he fell to his knees.</p><p>She stopped. Her breath was coming in ragged gasps. Callis whined at her feet.</p><p>\u201cNot bad,\u201d Spider said, his mouth dripping blood. \u201cLook behind me. What will you do now, my dear?\u201d</p><p>Sophie raised her head.</p><p>Monsters were climbing over the brick wall into the garden.</p><p>CHARLOTTE ran down the stairs. She\u2019d lost track of things for a moment, watching Richard win, and when she turned around, both Sophie and Spider were gone.</p><p>The hallway ended in an arched entrance, flooded with sunlight. She dashed through it. A large garden spread before her. In the middle of it, Sophie stood in a gown scarlet with blood, holding a small sword. The big dog stood shivering next to her. Sophie\u2019s gaze was fixed on the far wall. Charlotte looked up.</p><p>People were climbing over the wall, dropping into the flowers one by one. Some were human, some were a grotesque collection of animal parts grafted onto human bodies. Their magic splashed her like a wave of sewage. The Hand. They must be Spider\u2019s people. Sophie stood alone against two dozen trained killers, and she was holding an oversized knife.</p> <p>Charlotte ran. The time slowed to a crawl. She saw everything with crystalline clarity\u2014the monsters in the flowers; Sophie\u2019s pale face as she turned to glance at her; the desperation of knowing she was outmatched in the child\u2019s eyes . . .</p><p>The magic tore out of Charlotte, the dark currents streaming like black dragons to find their victims. They stung the first agent, biting his muscular body. He snarled, an inhuman sound, and kept coming. The regeneration, Charlotte realized. His enhanced body was healing the damage she inflicted with her diseases as fast as she could hurt him. She would have to give it more power.</p><p>She snapped some of her inner chains. The magic shot out of her, its black streams luminescent with red sparks, carrying death. The magic sped toward the Hand\u2019s agent, brushing against the wolfripper in passing. The dog howled, spun, and fled past her to the safety of the castle. The darkness stung the agent again. He went down on his knees. A bloody red lesion split open the skin on his back. Charlotte struggled to keep the wound open, feeling his body fighting her. He healed with unnatural speed. How was this possible?</p><p>Sophie dashed through the garden to her. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m so sorry. I didn\u2019t mean to. It just happened. Spider was walking away . . .\u201d</p><p>Charlotte thrust herself between the child and the monsters. \u201cStay near me.\u201d</p><p>She gave the magic more of herself and pushed. Her dark current snapped and struck, biting deep into the approaching fighters. They still kept coming. There had to be fifty of them in the gardens. They were circling them, closing in a ring. In moments, the two of them would be surrounded.</p><p>This was a death stand. If Charlotte didn\u2019t start feeding on them to fuel her own magic, the Hand would rip her and Sophie apart. But even if she then managed to kill them all, it would destroy who she was and she\u2019d take Sophie\u2019s life without even thinking about it.</p><p>Sophie held her knife, her face bloodless and terrified.</p><p>She had to save Sophie. Her years of making quick decisions in a crisis paid off. Fear vanished. Her head was suddenly clear. There was only one way out, Charlotte realized. It was impossible for both of them to get out of this alive, but if she bought Sophie enough time to escape . . . It was just possible the child could survive. It was their only chance.</p><p>You will turn into the plaguebringer, a tiny voice warned her.</p><p>True\u2014once she went down this road, nothing would prevent that\u2014but the Hand were too many, and they healed too fast. They would overwhelm her before she could move on to the castle and cause damage to innocent people. It was suicide, but it was the best possible option.</p><p>The first agent Charlotte had downed, rose, shaking off his injuries like they were mere scratches. Charlotte whipped her magic, and the dark currents clenched the revolting hybrid of human and beast. An exhilarating influx of life force flooded into her. She siphoned off his life and turned it into power.</p><p>The dark serpents of her magic smashed into the second agent, draining her dry and dumping her desiccated corpse into the flowers. They stung another and another, stealing more life, feeding it back into her.</p><p>Charlotte squeezed Sophie\u2019s shoulder. \u201cRun!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t leave you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you stay, I\u2019ll kill you. I\u2019ll clear the way. Run, sweetheart. Keep Richard away from me. Run!\u201d</p><p>Sophie ran. She flew along the path back to the castle like she had wings.</p><p>Charlotte opened the floodgates. Her power surged forward, biting deep into the monsters in Sophie\u2019s path. She stole their life force and vomited it back as an all-devouring plague. The Hand\u2019s agents shuddered and fell.</p><p>Sophie dashed through the gap between the bodies.</p><p>Her magic reaped its grisly harvest. The enhanced agents fought to reach her and fell, cut down, and she fed on their lives, reveling in their taste.</p><p>Sophie shot up the stairs and through the arched doors.</p><p>Enough. She could pull it back now. Charlotte strained, reeling the magic back. The darkness buckled inside her, fighting to stay unleashed. So strong, so overpowering. Her hold on her power slipped a little, then a little more. It was if she were caught in the current of a violent river that pushed her back, and no matter how hard she tried, she couldn\u2019t force her way against the flow.</p><p>She had become an abomination. The magic streamed out of her like a black storm, and she was powerless to stop it. As if in a dream, bodies were falling around her, slowly and softly, like wilted flowers. The dark river inside her rose, the furious current creeping higher and higher.</p><p>Oh, Richard . . . It had all gone wrong. It had gone so, so wrong. She was crying, the tears rolling down her cheeks. I\u2019m so sorry, love. I\u2019m so, so sorry. You were all I wanted. You were all I hoped for. I\u2019m sorry.</p><p>She shouldn\u2019t have pushed him away last night. She should\u2019ve invited him in, to love and be loved one last time.</p><p>The current inside her swelled, and she drowned.</p><p>RICHARD ran through the hallways, the walls a smudged blur. Ahead, Sophie dashed through the arched entrance, her face wet with tears.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s gone!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCharlotte\u2019s gone, she\u2019s gone!\u201d</p><p>He pulled away from her, but she grabbed onto his clothes, dragging him away from the arch. \u201cNo, Richard, no! No, you\u2019ll die. No! Don\u2019t go! She said for you not to go!\u201d</p><p>He hugged her to him, kissed her hair, and pushed free.</p><p>\u201cRichard,\u201d she screamed.</p><p>He burst into the sunlight.</p><p>Charlotte stood in the middle of the garden. Her magic raged, striking down the Hand\u2019s agents, the black streams boiling, twisting, like a terrifying storm. The Hand\u2019s freaks tried to run, but the magic bit them again and again. Some crawled, other lay unmoving, little more than desiccated husks, and some were decomposing.</p><p>Charlotte turned, and he saw her eyes. They were solid black.</p><p>The flowers by her feet withered. The blight ran from her, spreading through the garden. Roses died, rotting at the root. The last of the Hand\u2019s monsters swayed and fell.</p><p>She had become what she always feared. She had turned into a living death.</p><p>He had to get to her. He had to reach her.</p><p>The flowers by the stone steps on which he stood withered. He stepped on to their dried corpses and walked across the garden.</p><p>The darkness streamed to him. It cloaked him. He felt its deadly cold sting.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Charlotte.\u201d</p><p>Ten feet separated him from her.</p><p>His body buckled. It felt like he was being turned inside out.</p><p>Eight feet. The bones of his legs melted into agony.</p><p>\u201cI love you. Don\u2019t leave me.\u201d</p><p>Three steps.</p><p>His heart was beating too fast, each contraction slicing him as if someone were stabbing shards of glass straight into his aorta.</p><p>He dropped his sword\u2014his fingers couldn\u2019t hold it\u2014and closed his arms around her. \u201cMy love, my light . . . Don\u2019t leave me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She stood submerged within the black current of the magic river. The red pockets of magical essence washed over her one by one, glowing weakly, and she absorbed them in a cascade of euphoria.</p><p>No thoughts. No worries. Just freedom and bliss.</p><p>Another wash of red splashed against her. She tasted it and recoiled. It tasted too familiar. She hadn\u2019t taken it. It was freely given, but everything in her rebelled against consuming it. How could this be?</p><p>She forced herself to sample the essence, letting it permeate her. It streamed along her, coursing through her, so unbelievably delicious. Wrong. It was wrong. Her magic shrank from it.</p> <p>She strained, trying to identify it. There had to be a reason.</p><p>Richard!</p><p>He was Richard.</p><p>She heard a voice from a great distance. It cloaked her, separating her for a brief second from the darkness.</p><p>My love, my light . . . Don\u2019t leave me.</p> <p>She was killing him. She was draining his life, drop by precious drop.</p><p>No! No, she didn\u2019t want it. Take it back! Take it all back!</p><p>She tried to reverse the flow and send life back into him, but the current gripped her, smothering her, trying to banish reason. She felt herself drowning and fought against it with everything she had.</p><p>No! I am the Healer. You\u2019re part of me. You are part of me. You will obey me.</p><p>Pain flooded her, the current hammering against her body. Hundreds of pinpoint needles pierced her, burning her. The agony overwhelmed her, and she melted into blinding pain.</p><p>If she gave up now, Richard would die.</p> <p>Charlotte ripped through the pain. A golden glow coated her. The current of the dark river shrank from it.</p><p>You will obey.</p><p>The pain was excruciating. She screamed, although she had no voice. The glow shot from her, igniting the river into a radiant gold. Her magic boiled.</p><p>The darkness fell apart. She saw Richard\u2019s prone body in the dead grass and dropped to her knees next to him.</p><p>Don\u2019t die. Please, don\u2019t die.</p><p>She pushed, but no magic came. There was nothing left of it, neither light nor darkness.</p><p>Richard was barely breathing.</p><p>She strained, trying to pull on that roiling gold. The magic buckled inside her, threatening to rip her apart, but would not obey. Pain exploded inside her in excruciating bursts of agony. Charlotte tasted blood in her mouth.</p> <p>Tiny specks of blood formed on her skin, coming out of her pores. Finally her voice obeyed, and she screamed, the pain streaming out of her. It felt like she was dying. She almost wanted to die just to end the agony, but she had to save him.</p><p>Obey me. Work. You will work.</p><p>Something broke inside her.</p><p>Her magic burst out of her, the gold so potent, it lifted him above the ground. Her power bound them into one. Everything she had taken, every life she had stolen, all of it went into Richard. She drenched him in the healing gold, again and again, hoping against hope that he would live.</p><p>Come back to me. Come back to me, love.</p><p>It felt like her body was melting. She had to hold on. She had to heal him.</p><p>\u201cCome back to me. I love you so much.\u201d</p><p>He opened his eyes.</p><p>She didn\u2019t believe it. It was a trick.</p><p>He raised his hand. His fingers touched her lips. \u201cI love you, too.\u201d He pushed from the ground and sat up.</p><p>She collapsed on his chest and surrendered to the pain.</p><p>RICHARD sat by the heavy wooden doors. Behind them, the healers of Ganer College worked on Charlotte. He\u2019d thought she had fallen asleep from exhaustion. It took him five precious hours to realize she couldn\u2019t wake up. He\u2019d loaded her into a phaeton and drove at a breakneck speed to Ganer College. He walked through the gates, carrying her, and people came and took her away from him. He followed them through the labyrinth of hallways and stairs to this corridor and this room, where they shut the doors in his face, and he\u2019d been sitting here for hours, not knowing whether she would live or die. A man had brought him a platter of food at some point, but he felt no need to eat. He got up a few times to relieve himself in the bathroom two doors down.</p><p>He was so monumentally angry.</p><p>The two of them had done so much, they had sacrificed so much, and after all of that, now she would die. He wanted to rage and punch the walls at the unfairness of it, but instead he had to sit still. He tried picturing going home without her and couldn\u2019t.</p><p>If she died . . . What was the point?</p><p>\u201cThere is often no point. Seeking some sort of justification in the flow of life is useless,\u201d a woman said.</p><p>He looked up. An elegant, older woman stood before him, tall and very thin, with dark hair and intense penetrating gaze.</p><p>\u201cWill she live?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. She\u2019s resting now.\u201d</p><p>Relief flooded him.</p><p>\u201cMy name is Lady Augustine al Ran. Walk with me, Richard. There are some things we must discuss.\u201d</p><p>He rose and followed her down the hallway. \u201cAre you reading my mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m reading your emotions. You\u2019re drowning in bitterness. I\u2019m a sensate, and over the years, I\u2019ve become very good at connecting the dots.\u201d</p><p>They reached another set of doors. He held them open for her. She strode through. He went after her and found himself in a long, stone breezeway about fifty feet off the ground. A roof sheltered it from the elements, but the large, arched windows had no glass, and the breeze blew through them. The sun was out, its light bright and golden. When he\u2019d brought Charlotte in, night was falling.</p><p>\u201cWhat time is it?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s late morning,\u201d she said. \u201cFor you it is tomorrow. You\u2019ve spent the last fourteen hours waiting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas it been that long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>His anger was melting into the wind, carrying off his bitterness. He felt . . . calm.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need you to have a clear head,\u201d she said, stopping at one of the windows. \u201cYou have some decisions to make, and I don\u2019t want your emotions to interfere with them. I know about you, Richard. She wrote to me before leaving for the wedding. She told me all about you. She loves you, which explains why she has done the impossible for your sake. I wasn\u2019t there, but her body and her mind bear the scars. Tell me what happened.\u201d</p><p>He told her everything. The slavers, Charlotte, the dark magic, Sophie, all of it.</p><p>\u201cI had surmised as much,\u201d she said, looking at the gardens far below. \u201cCharlotte was always very strong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill there be repercussions?\u201d</p><p>She raised her narrow eyebrows. \u201cOfficially? No. She is too valuable as a healer, and the idea that a feedback loop can be broken would only give fools the pretext to experiment with it. No, there will be no sanctions, but there are consequences. When Charlotte broke the feedback loop to heal you, she did it at a terrible cost. She experienced discordance. It\u2019s a very rare phenomenon, where the magic user becomes so absorbed in channeling her magic that she loses motor skills. Charlotte must relearn basic things, Richard. She must learn again how to walk, how to hold a spoon or a pencil, how to turn the page of a book.\u201d</p><p>His heart sank. \u201cBut she can learn?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yes. There is nothing physically wrong with her body. We\u2019ve repaired the damage and made her as healthy as she could be. But it will take a lot of patience and practice. She will be bedridden for weeks.\u201d</p><p>She was alive. She was healthy, and she had survived. That was all that mattered. \u201cWhen can I take her home?\u201d</p><p>Lady Augustine turned to him. \u201cThat may not be a good idea. I don\u2019t think you understand. Charlotte will need to be carried to the bathroom. She will need to be bathed. She will need to be spoon-fed and will be bedridden for weeks until she is able to begin rehabilitation, which will likely take months. Do you have any children? You will have to take care of her as if she were a child. Think of what it will do to any romantic feelings you may have for her. You will never be able to see her in the same light again. Walk away, Richard. Leave her here with us. This is what we do. We care for the sick, and we\u2019re very good at it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid she say she wanted me to take her home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll take her home.\u201d</p><p>The older woman stared at him. \u201cYou must know that I won\u2019t consent to your marriage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care,\u201d Richard told her. \u201cI don\u2019t care about your family, your title, or your bloodline. I\u2019ll be with her in any way she will have me.\u201d</p><p>He turned and marched back the way they had come. He pounded his way through the hallway and walked through the doors. Charlotte was awake. She lay in bed, her hair fanning across the pillows like a golden veil, her silver eyes alert and aware. He knelt by the bed.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t hold you,\u201d she told him.</p><p>He kissed her lips gently. \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI care. You don\u2019t have to, if it\u2019s too much . . .\u201d</p><p>He heard tears in her voice.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t leave you,\u201d he told her. \u201cI will never leave you. We\u2019ll do this together. Come home with me. Please.\u201d</p><p>He hugged her to him. \u201cSay yes, Charlotte.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she told him.</p><p>EPILOGUE</p><p>THREE MONTHS LATER</p><p>THE evening sky had just begun to darken. Strings of colorful, round lanterns hung from the trees, glowing gently with yellow, green, blue, and red. Tiny golden fireflies floated in the air. The September air was warm and pleasant. Charlotte rocked back slightly in her chair. Before her a vast lake spread, calm and shiny like the surface of a coin. If she leaned forward, she would just be able to make out Kaldar and Audrey\u2019s house across the water to the left.</p><p>The lake splashed against the wooden pier. Jack lay on his back on the boards, looking at the sky, his hands behind his head. George skipped a small pebble across the pond next to him. Sophie sat on the edge, her feet in the water. Two weeks after the house was built, she asked if she could come and stay with them for a few days. She never left.</p><p>Charlotte smiled. She would\u2019ve loved to get up off her chair, walk down the winding path from the deck, and soak her feet in the green water too, but she knew her limits. She would have to wait. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>In an hour or so, Richard would get a phaeton, and they would go over to Declan and Rose\u2019s house. The Lord and Lady Camarine were expecting. George and Jack would become uncles. Now there was an interesting thought.</p><p>At her feet, Callis raised his shaggy black head. The wolfripper dog let out one quiet woof. Someone was coming.</p><p>Light, unhurried steps made her turn. Lady Augustine walked up the porch.</p> <p>They hadn\u2019t spoken to each other for a quarter of the year. Charlotte gripped her cane, planted her feet down, and stood. \u201cHello, Mother.\u201d</p><p>Lady Augustine\u2019s eyebrows crept up. \u201cYou\u2019re standing.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte took a step forward. \u201cAnd walking. With much difficulty.\u201d She had the best caretakers in the world, but her progress was still painfully slow.</p><p>They looked at each other. Her legs trembled, and Charlotte lowered herself back into her chair.</p><p>Lady Augustine sat next to her. \u201cThat is an enormous dog.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes. He used to be a slaver dog, but he mellowed out.\u201d Charlotte rubbed Callis\u2019s shaggy side with her toes. \u201cAre you done being angry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou almost threw away your life. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever stop being angry.\u201d Lady Augustine sighed.</p><p>\u201cThen why did you come?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause even though I was never very familiar with the Camarines, I received an invitation to celebrate the pregnancy, and the rules of propriety dictate that I attend.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte smiled. \u201cRichard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would suppose so. It was quite elegantly done. I will admit that while he\u2019s not of noble birth, he does understand our mind-set.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd exploits it, quite ruthlessly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see he built you a house.\u201d Lady Augustine glanced at the house behind them. \u201cBy what means did he pay for it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do believe it\u2019s extremely crass for you to inquire.\u201d Charlotte couldn\u2019t help but grin.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m inquiring not as Lady al Ran, but as your adoptive mother. Mothers are permitted to be crass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis family built it. I offered to pay for it, but he declined. They got together and raised it in about two weeks. I watched it go up. It was fascinating. Did you know that Lord Sandine is a changeling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard something about it, but I thought it was simply a rumor. What kind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA wolf. I saw three people struggling with a beam, and he took it away from them and carried it by himself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLord Sandine helped build your house?\u201d</p> <p>Charlotte nodded. \u201cHe\u2019s married to Richard\u2019s cousin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you like to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo marry.\u201d Lady Augustine pronounced the word with a crisp exactness.</p><p>Charlotte shrugged. \u201cPerhaps. I have a man who loves me. I have a daughter, who lives with us in this great house he built for us. We\u2019re happy. Marriage is only a formality. You should meet your granddaughter, Mother. She is beautiful, and she needs you and me both.\u201d</p><p>Lady Augustine glanced toward the pier. Her face took on an odd expression, as if she were staring over a great distance. \u201cDear gods,\u201d she whispered. \u201cShe\u2019s so damaged, darling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is. She doesn\u2019t trust easily, but she loves me and I love her. We can help her together.\u201d</p><p>Richard walked up on the porch. \u201cMy lady, Charlotte. The phaeton is ready. Would you care to accompany us, Lady al Ran?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe I would.\u201d The Lady rose. \u201cBut first I\u2019m going down to the pier to meet Sophie. Excuse me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood luck!\u201d Charlotte said after her. She stood up. Richard hugged her, supporting most of her weight as she leaned against his strong body.</p><p>\u201cMad?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNo. I meant to write her, but my penmanship is still horrid. It looks like chicken scratches in the dirt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d he told her.</p><p>She kissed him. The touch of his lips woke a lingering need inside her. \u201cI love you, too,\u201d she whispered. \u201cDo you think you could show me tonight how much you love me?\u201d</p><p>He laughed quietly, a satisfied male chuckle. \u201cI think that could be arranged.\u201d</p><p>She leaned her head against his chest. They stood together, wrapped in each other\u2019s warmth. Tomorrow would be a new day, new worries, new problems, new concerns. But tonight was peaceful and sweet.</p><p>\u201cCan we do this again tomorrow?\u201d she murmured. \u201cCan you and I come out here and sit on the deck, drink wine, and watch the water?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a date.\u201d He kissed her.</p><p>She smiled. </p> </body></html>"]
