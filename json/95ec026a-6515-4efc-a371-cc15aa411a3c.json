I\u2019ve watched my brothers get into some serious trouble when they were in high school. I was never expected to follow in their footsteps. I get straight As, I don\u2019t get into fights, and from age eleven I knew what I wanted to be when I grew up. I\u2019m known as \u201cthe good kid\u201d in mi familia\u2014the one who\u2019s expected to never fuck up.</p><p>My friends know I have a crazy rebellious streak, but my family doesn\u2019t. I can\u2019t help it\u2014I\u2019m a Fuentes, and being rebellious is deeply rooted in my genes. The kid my family sees on the outside isn\u2019t necessarily what\u2019s on the inside, and I intend to keep it that way. I vowed never to stray from my ultimate goal of going to college and studying aeronautics, but taking a few physical risks every once in a while feeds that adrenaline rush I crave.</p> <p>I\u2019m standing at the bottom of a rock formation in Boulder Canyon with four of my friends. Jack Reyerson brought rock climbing gear, but I don\u2019t wait to strap on a harness. I grab one of the ropes and attach it with a carabiner on my belt loop so when I reach the summit I can anchor the rope for the rest of the group.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not safe to go up without gear, Luis,\u201d Brooke says. \u201cBut you already know that, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep,\u201d I say.</p><p>I start a free solo ascent, making my way up the rock formation. This isn\u2019t the first free solo I\u2019ve done at Boulder Canyon, and I\u2019ve had enough training to know what the hell I\u2019m doing. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s not a risk\u2014it\u2019s just a calculated one.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re crazy, Luis,\u201d Jamie Bloomfield yells from below as I climb even higher. \u201cIf you fall, you\u2019ll die!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI just want everyone here to know that I\u2019m not responsible if you break every bone in your body,\u201d Jack says. \u201cI should have had you sign a liability waiver.\u201d</p><p>Jack\u2019s father is a lawyer, so he has an annoying habit of announcing his lack of responsibility about pretty much everything we do.</p><p>I don\u2019t tell them that climbing without a safety harness is an adrenaline rush. It actually makes me want to push myself harder and take more risks. Jamie called me an adrenaline junkie after I snowboarded down the black diamond slope in Vail on the winter break trip last year. I didn\u2019t tell her that fooling around with the girl I met in the lobby that night was also an adrenaline rush. Does that qualify me as a junkie?</p><p>When I\u2019m halfway to the summit, I\u2019ve got my right hand secured above me and one foot planted inside a small crevice. It\u2019s high enough to make me look down to see what I might be falling on if I do lose my grip.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t look down!\u201d Jack says in a panic. \u201cYou\u2019ll get vertigo and fall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd die!\u201d Jamie adds.</p> <p>Dios m\u00edo. My friends seriously need to chill. They\u2019re white, and haven\u2019t been brought up in a Mexican family full of guys who thrive on challenges and living on the edge. Even though I\u2019m supposed to be the one Fuentes brother who\u2019s smart enough not to take risks, I feel most alive when I do.</p><p>The summit is a few feet away. I stop and look across the sky, getting a bird\u2019s-eye view of the landscape. It\u2019s fucking amazing. I used to live in Illinois, where the landscape was completely flat except for the skyscrapers. Looking out across the Colorado mountains makes me appreciate nature. The wind is at my back, the sun is high in the sky, and I feel invincible.</p><p>I reach up with my left hand and grab on to the edge of a crevice in the rock face about ten feet from the top. I\u2019m almost there. As I scan the rock for a spot to place my foot, I feel something sharp pierce my hand.</p><p>Oh, hell. That wasn\u2019t good.</p><p>I just got bitten by something.</p><p>Instinctively, I quickly plant my foot as I snatch my hand back and glance at it. Two small puncture marks are on the back of my hand with my blood streaming out of them.</p><p>\u201cStop scratching your balls so we can get up there before the sun sets, Luis!\u201d Eli Movitz screams from below.</p><p>\u201cI hate to break the news to you guys,\u201d I call down to them as the tip of a snake\u2019s head appears above me, then sneaks back inside for cover, \u201cbut I just got bitten by a snake.\u201d</p> <p>I didn\u2019t get a good look at the sucker, so I have no clue if it\u2019s venomous or not. Shit. I look down at my friends and vertigo hits almost immediately. This was not in the plan. My heart is racing and I squeeze my eyes shut, hoping to stop my head from spinning.</p><p>\u201cHoly shit, man!\u201d Eli yells to me. \u201cWas it a rattler?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did it look like?\u201d Jamie calls up to me. \u201cDid it have stripes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI only saw the tip of the head, and I\u2019m not about to go back up there and get a closer look,\u201d I tell her, wondering if I should move sideways and continue the last ten feet of my ascent or attempt to go back down.</p><p>I\u2019m a math guy, so I immediately consider the odds of surviving this situation. My hand definitely stings, but it\u2019s not numb. Surely if I was just pumped with a shitload of venom I\u2019d start feeling numb and stiff right about now.</p><p>\u201cI knew Luis shouldn\u2019t have free solo\u2019d it,\u201d Jack\u2019s voice echoes from below. \u201cI knew it! Nobody listened to me, and now he\u2019s stuck up there while venom is probably spreading throughout his body.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut the fuck up, Jack!\u201d I yell. \u201cSnakes don\u2019t have fuckin\u2019 legs, so how was I supposed to think there\u2019d be one hidin\u2019 in the face of a damn rock that\u2019s ten feet below the summit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you feel, like, normal?\u201d Brooke asks.</p><p>\u201cA snake just punctured my skin with its fangs, Brooke,\u201d I say as I head back down slowly. It might be my imagination, but I think my hand is starting to get numb. \u201cOf course I don\u2019t feel normal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet a ranger with antivenom!\u201d Jack yells to the rest of them. We\u2019d have to drive to find one. None of us have our licenses yet, so we\u2019re screwed. Actually, I\u2019m the only one who\u2019s screwed.</p><p>With all the talk of antivenom and rattlers, I can\u2019t think straight and lose traction.</p><p>My foot slips. Then my hand, the one without two puncture holes in it, starts sweating all of a sudden and I lose my grip. I slip down the side of the rock face and hear the gasps and screams of my friends below while I scramble to get a foothold or a hand on something solid. It\u2019s no use.</p><p>All I can think of before I hit the ground is I\u2019m not ready to die.</p><p>2</p><p>Nikki</p><p>\u201cI love you, Marco.\u201d</p><p>I said it. I couldn\u2019t look into my boyfriend\u2019s deep, dark eyes as the words flowed seamlessly from my lips, because I\u2019m also holding something back. I figured saying I love you as a conversation starter would be easier than saying I might be pregnant. It was cowardly not to look into his eyes and tell him everything, but saying those three words is a start. I feel more vulnerable than I\u2019ve ever felt before.</p><p>I don\u2019t do vulnerable well.</p><p>I breathe out slowly and gather up the courage to look up at my boyfriend of a year. We lost our virginity to each other a month ago when his parents went to Mexico to visit his grandmother.</p><p>I can\u2019t even think about it now as I focus on him. Okay, I said I love you. Your turn to say it back, like you whispered in my ear the first time we made love. Then I\u2019ll tell you I missed my period this month and I\u2019m freaking out. Then you\u2019ll tell me everything will be okay and that we\u2019ll deal with it together.</p><p>He\u2019s smiling. Well, kinda. The side of his mouth is quirked up, like he\u2019s amused. I wasn\u2019t going for amused. I was going for affection and adoration\u2014signs that it was okay to tell him my secret. I look toward Lake Michigan, wishing we weren\u2019t outside and hoping nobody from our high school suddenly shows up. I wrap my arms around myself. It\u2019s not that warm in Illinois yet, and the wind off the lake is definitely making me shiver. Or maybe it\u2019s my nerves.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to say it back to me,\u201d I say to fill the silence, but that\u2019s a complete lie. I do expect Marco to say it back to me. I don\u2019t want to hear it just on special occasions and when we\u2019re making love.</p><p>The first time he said it was after the homecoming dance back in September. Then on New Year\u2019s Eve. And on Valentine\u2019s Day. And my birthday. So many nights I lie alone in my bed and think about how our love will last forever.</p><p>We don\u2019t have the same friends because we live on different sides of Fairfield, but that\u2019s never mattered. We\u2019ve made it work. After school, we usually go to my house and just ... be with each other.</p><p>And now we might be having a baby. How is he going to take the news?</p><p>Today is the last day of our freshman year of high school before summer break. Marco suggested we go to the beach after school when I told him I needed to talk.</p><p>It makes sense, really. The beach is our special place.</p><p>We had our first kiss on the beach last summer. He asked me to be his official girlfriend there the second week of school. We made snow angels on that same beach back in January when we had a snow day. We come here to share all our private secrets, like once he told me where gang members stashed guns around town so the police wouldn\u2019t catch them carrying it. Marco has always known guys who were heavily connected.</p><p>He steps away from me, and immediately I get goose bumps as if my body knows something is up besides the wind coming off the lake. He combs his fingers through his jet-black hair. Then sighs. Twice.</p><p>\u201cI think we should see other people,\u201d he murmurs.</p><p>I cock my head to the side. Obviously I didn\u2019t hear him right.</p><p>There are a few phrases that a girl expects to hear after she declares her love to her boyfriend. I can think of a few right off the top of my head, but I think we should see other people isn\u2019t one of them.</p><p>I\u2019m stunned. And I can\u2019t stop shaking as I think about being pregnant without him at my side, smiling and telling me everything will be okay.</p><p>\u201cW-w-why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou always said you\u2019d never date a gang member, and I\u2019m gonna be one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I won\u2019t date a gang member,\u201d I blurt out. \u201cJust two days ago you told me you\u2019d never join the gang, Marco. It was right before we made love. Remember?\u201d</p><p>He winces. \u201cI said a lot of things I probably shouldn\u2019t have. And could you please not call it makin\u2019 love ... every time you say it like that you make me feel like shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want me to call it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust sex, huh?\u201d</p><p>He rolls his eyes, and I swear my stomach lurches in response. \u201cSee, now you\u2019re makin\u2019 me feel like shit on purpose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not doing it on purpose.\u201d</p><p>He opens his mouth to say something, then must think better of it, because he shuts it.</p><p>I scan his face, hoping he\u2019ll say Just joking! Of course I pick you over the Latino Blood, but he doesn\u2019t. My heart feels like someone is chipping away at it, piece by piece.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re just ... so different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo we\u2019re not. We\u2019re perfect together. We go to the same school, we have the best time together ... we\u2019re both Mexican.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He laughs. \u201cYou don\u2019t even speak a word of Spanish, Nikki. My parents and friends talk about you while you\u2019re in the room, and you\u2019re clueless. You\u2019re not really Mexican.\u201d</p><p>Is he kidding me?</p><p>My parents were born in Mexico, just like the rest of my ancestors. Nobody would mistake them for anything other than Latino. Spanish is their first language. My parents came to the United States after they got married. After that, my dad went to medical school and did his residency at Chicago Memorial.</p><p>\u201cThe gang doesn\u2019t make you more Mexican, Marco. Don\u2019t make the gang more important than our relationship.\u201d</p> <p>He kicks up the sand with his toe. \u201cNo hablas pinche espa\u00f1ol.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you said. Can you translate, please?\u201d</p><p>He holds his hands up in frustration. \u201cThat\u2019s my point. To be honest, I\u2019ve been hangin\u2019 with the Blood for a while now.\u201d</p><p>How can he say that? I put my hand over my stomach in a weak effort to protect any baby that might be growing inside me. I can\u2019t help tears from welling in my eyes. I know I look desperate and pathetic as a stream of tears runs down my cheeks. Everything I thought I had with Marco is blowing up in my face. I feel more alone than I ever have in my life.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe this,\u201d I say in almost a whisper.</p> <p>I should tell him my secret. Maybe it\u2019ll make him change his mind, knowing that we might have a baby. But if I\u2019m not pregnant, am I just prolonging the inevitable?</p><p>\u201cI just don\u2019t want you to give me shit for bein\u2019 a Blood,\u201d he blurts out. \u201cAll of my friends joined.\u201d</p><p>I look down at my nails. I\u2019d painted them last night and drew a red heart design in the middle of each nail. On my thumbs, inside the little hearts, I put the initials MD\u2014Marco Delgado. I thought he\u2019d be flattered. Obviously I was delusional. I quickly hide my thumbs in my fists.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he says, then rubs my shoulder like a parent consoling a child. \u201cDon\u2019t cry. We can still, you know, be friends ... friends with benefits, even.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to be friends with benefits, Marco. I want to be your girlfriend.\u201d The entire contents of my lunch threaten to come up on me.</p><p>What is the gang giving him that I can\u2019t?</p> <p>He stays silent and kicks the sand again.</p><p>My hands fall limply at my sides as I realize I can\u2019t fix this. He\u2019s looking at me differently, as if I\u2019m just one of the other girls at school and not the girl of his dreams or the future mother of his children.</p><p>He pulls his cell phone out of his pocket and glances at the time. \u201cUm ... about tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe end-of-year party at Malnatti\u2019s?\u201d It\u2019s the \u201cofficially unofficial\u201d pizza party for Fairfield High students. They put up a big tent outside their restaurant and have a DJ and an all-you-can-eat pizza party from six to eleven. Afterward, most of the students hang out at the Fairfield football field back forty until the police come to break it up.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he says. \u201cSo, uh, if you know of anyone who wants to be hooked up, let me know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re selling drugs?\u201d I ask him.</p><p>He shrugs. \u201cIt\u2019s money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s dirty money, Marco. And illegal. Don\u2019t do it. You could get arrested and locked in jail.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t need a fuckin\u2019 lecture from you.\u201d</p><p>He checks his phone again. Is he waiting for someone to call or text him? I feel like I\u2019ve already lost everything we ever had.</p><p>The tears running silently down my cheeks are a clue that I am most definitely not okay, but he doesn\u2019t seem to care. I swipe them away and curse myself for being so weak.</p><p>I can handle this. I\u2019m an independent girl who doesn\u2019t need a guy to figure out what to do. Obviously this is my problem, and my problem alone. If I\u2019m pregnant, he\u2019ll figure it out when he sees my stomach swell up like a balloon. He\u2019ll know it\u2019s his. If he chooses to acknowledge us and clean up his life, then we\u2019ll talk.</p><p>I look up at Marco and give him a small smile. \u201cI don\u2019t want to control you. I never wanted to be the girl who held you back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you did ... you have. I can\u2019t do it anymore.\u201d</p><p>I guess in reality I\u2019m not independent. Our relationship did define me, and I liked it that way. I can\u2019t believe he wants me out of his life. It doesn\u2019t make sense.</p><p>He gets a text, but I can\u2019t see who it\u2019s from. He texts back. \u201cCan you make it home on your own?\u201d he asks me. His fingers move fast and furious as he continues texting.</p><p>\u201cI guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool.\u201d He leans down and kisses me on the cheek. \u201cMy friends thought you\u2019d go all loco on me. They thought you\u2019d punch me or somethin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>Now there\u2019s a thought. But no, I couldn\u2019t punch him.</p><p>Before I can open my mouth to beg him to come back to me and lose any dignity I have left, he turns to leave. Then he\u2019s just gone. Out of sight, but definitely not out of mind.</p><p>He picked the gang over me.</p><p>My breath hitches. I look out at the lake and feel like jumping in\u2014to swim away and pretend this isn\u2019t happening. Desperation washes over me like waves washing footprints off the shore, and I start to shake uncontrollably. My knees crumple to the sand, and I can feel my hot tears start to fall again. This time I don\u2019t swipe them away. I break down and cry while recalling every single moment Marco and I spent together, and praying that my period is just late and I\u2019m not really pregnant.</p><p>Pregnant at fifteen was never my plan.</p><p>3</p><p>Luis</p><p>I guess my secret is out. If it wasn\u2019t for that damn snake, I wouldn\u2019t have fallen off the rock and mi'am\u00e1 wouldn\u2019t be sitting in the hospital room continuously shooting me threatening stares that translate into You are in so much trouble.</p><p>Ends up I didn\u2019t have venom running through my body. One of the snake\u2019s fangs punctured a nerve in my hand, which is why it felt numb. After I fell, Brooke called her father in a panic. He picked us up and drove me to the hospital. Surviving the snake bite was the easy part. Getting continuously lectured by mi'am\u00e1 has been torture.</p><p>During the fall down the face of the rock, I scratched up my legs pretty bad. I should be grateful for finally being able to grab part of the rock that jutted out with my good hand, even though in the process I ripped my skin open from palm to wrist and almost needed stitches. In the end, the doc decided the cuts weren\u2019t deep enough to require stitches and decided to have a nurse bandage me up instead.</p><p>Mi'am\u00e1 crosses her arms on her chest as she watches me adjust the hospital bed so I\u2019m not lying down flat. \u201cYou scared me half to death, Luis. Who told you to climb up a mountain without a safety harness?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNobody.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was stupid,\u201d she tells me, stating the obvious as she watches the nurse bandage my hand.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>I look over at my brother Alex, leaning against the window watching me. He\u2019s shaking his head, probably wondering how he got stuck with two younger brothers who were destined to do reckless, stupid things. Pap\u00e1 died before I was born, so Alex has been the oldest male in our immediate family since he was six. Now he\u2019s twenty-two.</p><p>I\u2019ve got to give Alex credit. He\u2019s always tried to keep us out of trouble. Carlos was a lost cause from the start. Mi'am\u00e1 said our other brother was born kicking and screaming, and never stopped until he was a teenager. Then all that pent-up energy was used to start fights with anyone who was stupid enough to piss him off.</p><p>Alex was twenty when mi'am\u00e1 sent Carlos to live with him so Alex could straighten Carlos out.</p><p>Now Carlos is in the military and Alex is about to get married to Brittany Ellis, the girl he\u2019s been dating since high school.</p><p>A nurse peeks her head into the room. \u201cMrs. Fuentes, we need you to sign a few papers.\u201d</p><p>The second mi'am\u00e1 leaves the room, Alex steps toward me. \u201cYou are one lucky motherfucker,\u201d he says. \u201cIf I ever find out you free solo again, I\u2019ll personally kick your ass. Got it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlex, it wasn\u2019t my fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, hell,\u201d he says, covering his eyes with his hand as if he has a big headache. \u201cYou sound just like Carlos.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not Carlos,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cSo don\u2019t act like him. I\u2019m gettin\u2019 married in two weeks. Two weeks, Luis. The last thing I need is one of my brothers fallin\u2019 off a fuckin\u2019 cliff and killin\u2019 himself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTechnically it wasn\u2019t a cliff,\u201d I tell him. \u201cAnd the odds of gettin\u2019 a snake bite on an ascent is like\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me a break,\u201d he says, cutting me off. \u201cI don\u2019t need statistics, Luis. I need my brother at my weddin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>Five girls, including Brooke, Jamie, and three of their friends, appear in the doorway. They\u2019re all carrying balloons that say Get well soon! on them. I give a short laugh as my brother glances at the parade of girls with shock as they tie their balloons to the side rail of my bed.</p><p>\u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d Brooke asks.</p><p>\u201cLike crap,\u201d I tell them, lifting up both of my bandaged hands\u2014one with the snake bite and the other from being ripped open by the rocks.</p><p>\u201cWe came here to make you feel better,\u201d Jamie says.</p><p>I smile wide and immediately feel better. Now that I know I\u2019m not about to die, it\u2019s all good. \u201cWhat do you girls have in mind?\u201d</p><p>I think I hear my brother snort as he steps back and the girls surround my bed.</p><p>\u201cWant a back massage?\u201d Angelica Mu\u00f1oz asks with a flirty lilt to her voice.</p><p>\u201cI brought some cookies from the Pearl Street Mall bakery,\u201d Brooke says. \u201cI can feed you since you can\u2019t use your hands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got to be kiddin\u2019,\u201d Alex mumbles from behind her.</p><p>Angelica settles behind me and starts massaging my back while Brooke takes one of the chocolate chip cookies she brought and lifts it to my mouth.</p><p>My future sister-in-law walks into the room, her high-heeled boots clicking on the hospital floor and her hair secured in a long blond ponytail running down her back. She takes one look at my entourage and shakes her head in confusion.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on here?\u201d she says to Alex.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t ask,\u201d Alex says, coming up to her.</p><p>\u201cAlex called me in a panic and said you\u2019d had an accident,\u201d she tells me.</p><p>I hold up both of my bandaged hands again. \u201cI did. Hurts like a bitch, but the doc says I\u2019ll survive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cObviously,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll be happy when your mother walks in the room and catches her fifteen-year-old son surrounded by his own harem. You know how protective she gets, Luis.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf she\u2019s like my mom, she\u2019ll freak,\u201d Angelica says, then says to the other girls, \u201cMaybe we should leave.\u201d</p><p>Angelica is a girl I\u2019ve casually fooled around with a few times at parties. She\u2019s got Mexican parents, too, so she gets it. The other girls don\u2019t have a clue how protective Mexican mothers can be. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I tell the girls that I\u2019ll text them when I can use my hands, and they leave right before mi'am\u00e1 walks back in the room.</p><p>\u201cWho brought the balloons?\u201d she asks. \u201cWas it those girls I saw in the hallway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I tell her. \u201cThey\u2019re just friends from school.\u201d No use getting into detail about how I\u2019ve made out with three out of the five of them at one point or another.

You liked the rush of knowin\u2019 you were sayin\u2019 fuck you to danger. I\u2019ve got one brother in the military, a best friend who\u2019s been six feet under for more than four years, and I\u2019m not about to sit back while my baby brother gets la tengo dura by flirtin\u2019 with danger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou take life too seriously,\u201d I say, moving past him. \u201cI\u2019m not your baby brother anymore, Alex, and I\u2019m not as innocent as you think. I\u2019m almost sixteen. You know that girl Brooke who brought me cookies? She\u2019s not innocent, either. You want to know how I know that?\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t help but crack a grin as Alex puts his hands over his ears like earmuffs.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019re too fuckin\u2019 young, bro. I swear, if you get a girl pregnant you\u2019ll have more than just two bandaged hands to deal with.\u201d</p><p>4</p><p>Nikki</p><p>I don\u2019t know how much time has gone by. Every time I get a call on my cell and realize it\u2019s not Marco, I ignore it. Every time I get a text from one of my friends, I ignore it.</p><p>I don\u2019t know how long I\u2019ve been sitting on the beach crying, but I don\u2019t care. I tell my baby to give me strength, but I feel as weak as ever.</p><p>Until I hear a familiar voice. \u201cNik!\u201d</p> <p>I look up. It\u2019s Kendall. Kendall and I have been best friends since preschool, when we both wore the same dress on picture day and told everyone we were twins even when Miss Trudy said that lying wasn\u2019t part of the school\u2019s \u201ccore principles.\u201d We didn\u2019t know what \u201ccore principles\u201d were back when we were four, but when Miss Trudy talked about them in her stern voice we knew we were in trouble.</p><p>Before I say anything, she kneels down to me. \u201cI heard.\u201d</p><p>She might have heard about the breakup, but she has no clue I might be pregnant. I bury my face in my hands. \u201cI can\u2019t believe this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d She sits beside me.</p><p>\u201cHe picked the gang over me.\u201d I look up at my friend who has light hair and hazel eyes\u2014the exact opposite of me. \u201cHe said I wasn\u2019t Mexican enough.\u201d</p><p>Kendall shakes her head and snorts. \u201cHe\u2019s an idiot.\u201d</p><p>I sniff a few times, then try to wipe the tears off my face. \u201cHow did you find out?\u201d</p><p>She winces. \u201cI tried to call you and text you, but you didn\u2019t answer. So I texted Marco and asked where you were. He told me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI told him I loved him. Then he said he wanted to see other people. Then he said he was already hanging out with the Blood and we could be friends. Friends with benefits, Kendall. Can you believe it? As if I could just turn my feelings off like a faucet.\u201d</p><p>Just saying the words friends and benefits in the same breath makes me cringe.</p><p>Kendall sighs. \u201cI know it doesn\u2019t seem like it right now, but you\u2019ll find someone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t do this without him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo what?\u201d she asks, confused.</p><p>I look up at her, the one friend I can trust more than anyone else. \u201cI might ... be pregnant.\u201d</p><p>Her look of shock mixed with a hefty amount of pity is enough to make me cry all over again.</p><p>She puts her hands on either side of my face and urges me to look at her. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be fine, Nikki. I\u2019m here for you. You know that, right?\u201d</p><p>I nod. I wish I\u2019d heard those words come out of Marco\u2019s mouth.</p><p>\u201cHow late are you?\u201d she asks.</p><p>\u201cA week and a half.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you take a pregnancy test?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. I guess I thought after I told Marco, we\u2019d get one together at a drugstore a few towns over where nobody knew us.</p><p>Kendall urges me to get up. \u201cFirst, I\u2019m going to get a pregnancy test for you. Then we\u2019re going to figure it out. Listen, it is what it is and you can\u2019t change it. Let\u2019s find out so we know for sure. Cool?\u201d</p><p>Truth is, at this point I don\u2019t know if I want to know for sure. Ignorance is bliss, right?</p><p>I\u2019m silent as Kendall drives me to a drugstore and back to her house. I sit on the edge of her tub and bite my fingernails nervously while she reads the instructions and hands me the stick I\u2019m supposed to pee on so I know if I\u2019m carrying Marco\u2019s baby.</p><p>I look at the stick. \u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d I tell Kendall. \u201cI just ... need to see Marco one more time. I need to talk to him face-to-face before I do this. He\u2019ll be at Malnatti\u2019s. If I can pull him away from the party and talk to him, maybe we can work things out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ... I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s a good idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to see to him tonight, Kendall.\u201d I look down at the pregnancy test. \u201cI can\u2019t do this without him.\u201d</p><p>I know I sound desperate. I just have to find out if there\u2019s anything I can do to change his mind about the Latino Blood ... and me ... and dealing drugs.</p><p>Kendall stands. \u201cYou sure you want to talk to him tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d I feel like I have so much to say, and was too caught off guard to say it before. If he knows how much I truly care about him, he\u2019s got to change his mind. I can\u2019t imagine any girl loving him more than I do. I put the pregnancy test back in the package and shove it in my purse.</p><p>\u201cCome on, let\u2019s get you ready then,\u201d she says, taking me to her room and scanning her closet to pick something for me to wear. \u201cI think seeing Marco right now is a horrible idea, but if you\u2019re determined, I\u2019m not going to stop you. First I\u2019m going to make sure you look so hot, Marco will shit in his pants when he takes one look at you.\u201d</p><p>In the end, Kendall picks out tight skinny jeans and a designer top that her mom gave her after she decided she didn\u2019t want it anymore. At the party, I take a deep breath and hold my head high as I walk through the big white tent at Malnatti\u2019s with Kendall at my side.</p><p>I scan the main area. It seems like the entire school is here celebrating the beginning of summer break.</p><p>Music is playing.</p><p>Some people are eating.</p><p>Some people are dancing.</p><p>I scan the tent for the familiar face that makes my heart race every time I look at him.</p><p>I finally see him ... making out with Mariana Castillo in the back corner. She\u2019s one of the tough, pretty Latino Blood homegirls that most girls at Fairfield steer clear of. He\u2019s kissing her in that familiar way I know all too well. And feeling her ass with hands that touched my naked body just two days ago.</p><p>No.</p><p>I close my eyes, wishing the image would disappear. But it doesn\u2019t.</p><p>I open my eyes, and now I notice that most of the freshmen and sophomores are staring at me. I get looks of pity from girls on the north side, but I notice most of the Latina girls from the south side are whispering to each other and laughing. They\u2019re gloating, happy that Marco dumped his rich north side girlfriend.</p><p>I tell Kendall not to follow me as I turn and run out of the tent, not stopping until I reach my house twenty minutes later. I bolt upstairs and lock myself in my room, feeling like a complete fool.</p><p>I pull out the pregnancy test from the zippered section of my purse and unwrap the stick. I let out a long, slow breath. This is it. The moment of truth.</p><p>I sneak off to the bathroom, glad the rest of my family is watching television in the family room.</p><p>After I follow the instructions, I hold the stick in my hand and wait impatiently for the results to show up. As I stare at the little plastic window that will tell me my fate, three things Marco taught me today race through my mind: boys will lie to your face just to have sex with you, don\u2019t trust any boy who says I love you, and never date a boy who lives on the south side of Fairfield.</p><p>5</p><p>Luis</p><p>Two weeks after my showdown with the snake, I\u2019m in a tuxedo at my brother\u2019s wedding. I never thought I\u2019d see Alex get married. Then again, I never thought I\u2019d be back in Illinois again. This time, though, we\u2019re at a rented house on Sheridan Road in Winnetka. It\u2019s less than fifteen minutes from the south side of Fairfield where we used to live, but it feels like a whole other world.</p><p>\u201c\u00bfEst\u00e1s nervioso?\u201d I ask Alex as I watch him attempt to adjust the bowtie so it sits straight.</p><p>\u201cEstoy bien, Luis. It\u2019s just that this damn thing won\u2019t go on right,\u201d Alex growls, then slides the strip of fabric from under his crisp white collar and whips it on the ground before running his hand through his hair. He sighs heavily, then glances at me. \u201cHow the hell did you get yours to tie without lookin\u2019 like a kid did it?\u201d</p><p>I pull out a piece of folded-up paper from the back pocket of my rented tuxedo pants, ignoring the pain from my still-raw hand. \u201cI printed instructions off the Internet,\u201d I tell him proudly as I hold out the piece of paper.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re such a geek, Luis,\u201d our brother Carlos chimes in as he moves from the opposite side of the room and rips the instructions out of my hand.</p><p>Carlos didn\u2019t have to worry about renting a tuxedo because he\u2019s wearing his dress uniform from the army. From the way he stands straight and tall when he wears it, I know he\u2019s proud he\u2019s in the service instead of being in the gang he was in when he lived in Mexico with me and Mam\u00e1.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d Carlos says as he picks up the tie and shoves it and the instructions into Alex\u2019s empty hand. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to keep that bride of yours waitin\u2019 at the altar. She might decide to ditch you and marry a white dude with an investment portfolio instead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou tryin\u2019 to piss me off?\u201d Alex says, shoving Carlos away when he laughs at the clear plastic container with the red rose boutonniere packed neatly inside.</p><p>Carlos nods. \u201cEstoy tratando. I haven\u2019t had a chance to give you shit since I was deployed nine months ago, Alex. No puedo parar.\u201d</p><p>Just as I\u2019m about to offer to tie Alex\u2019s bowtie for him, mi'am\u00e1 comes into the room.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you boys doing?\u201d she asks, as if we\u2019re still little kids messing around.</p><p>\u201cArguin\u2019,\u201d Carlos says matter-of-factly.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no time for that.\u201d</p><p>Carlos kisses her on the cheek. \u201cThere\u2019s always time for arguin\u2019 when you\u2019re a Fuentes.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She glares at him, then looks up at the ceiling. \u201cDios m\u00edo ay\u00fadame.\u201d</p><p>She grabs Alex\u2019s bowtie and wraps it around his neck. As if she\u2019s a pro, she has it tied in less than thirty seconds.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Ma,\u201d Alex says.</p><p>When she finishes, she looks up at Alex and cups his face in her hands. \u201cMy oldest hijo is getting married. Your father would be so proud of you, Alejandro. Graduating from college, and now getting married. Just ... don\u2019t forget where you came from. \u00bfMe Entiendes?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d he assures her.</p><p>Mi'am\u00e1 pins his boutonniere on his lapel, then steps back and looks at all three of us. Her hands press against her heart and her eyes get watery. \u201cMy boys are all grown up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t cry, Ma,\u201d Alex tells her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d she lies as a tear escapes the corner of her eye and runs down her face. She quickly brushes it away, then straightens and heads for the door. \u201cCarlos and Luis, you should collect the rest of the groomsmen and tell them to line up soon.\u201d She glances at Alex. \u201cFinish getting dressed, Alejandro. The procession is about to start.\u201d</p><p>She closes the door, leaving us alone.</p> <p>I watch as Alex walks over to the window overlooking Lake Michigan. Chairs set up on the private beach are filled with guests waiting for him and his bride.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t do this,\u201d he says.</p><p>I step closer, hoping to get a hint that he\u2019s joking.</p><p>He\u2019s not.</p><p>I glance at the clock on the wall. \u201cUmm, Alex, you do realize that the weddin\u2019 is supposed to start in ten minutes, don\u2019t you?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll handle this,\u201d Carlos says, taking control. He braces his hands on Alex\u2019s shoulders. \u201cDid\u2019ja cheat on Brittany?\u201d</p> <p>Alex shakes his head.</p><p>\u201cYou in love with another chick?\u201d</p><p>Another shake.</p><p>Carlos leans away from Alex and crosses his arms on his chest. \u201cThen you\u2019re goin\u2019 through with it. I didn\u2019t get leave and fly all the way to Chicago for you to call it off, Alex. And besides, you love the gringa and promised you\u2019d marry her after you both graduated college. This is a done deal. No backin\u2019 out now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019d you do, Alex?\u201d I ask, completely confused now.</p><p>He sighs heavily. \u201cI haven\u2019t told her the news that at the end of the summer we\u2019re movin\u2019 back to Chicago.\u201d</p><p>Our entire family has lived in Colorado for almost three years. Moving back here isn\u2019t gonna fly with Brittany. \u201cWhat do you mean, you\u2019re movin\u2019 back to Chicago?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a long story. Brit\u2019s parents are handin\u2019 over custody of her sister, Shelley, to the state of Illinois. She\u2019s twenty-one and can go on state fundin\u2019 for her care. That means she\u2019ll be pulled from Sunny Acres and moved back here. Brit doesn\u2019t know yet. She also doesn\u2019t know I got into Northwestern for grad school. I accepted.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd you didn\u2019t tell her any of it?\u201d Carlos asks. \u201cOh, man, you are screwed.\u201d</p><p>Alex rubs the back of his neck and winces. \u201cI kinda never even told her I applied to Northwestern. She thinks we\u2019re stayin\u2019 in Boulder after the weddin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>I know full well my brother\u2019s soon-to-be wife doesn\u2019t want to come back to Illinois. I\u2019ve heard her talk about her fear of coming back to the place where Alex got shot, and beat up within an inch of his life to get jumped out of the Latino Blood. He\u2019s told her it\u2019s safe now, since the gang broke off into different factions and the new head of the gang, Chuy Soto, is in jail. We\u2019ve all assured Brittany that Alex doesn\u2019t have a target on his back, but she\u2019s skeptical.</p><p>I know it took a lot for Alex to convince Brittany to have their wedding back here. I think she agreed for the sole reason that she hoped her parents would attend the ceremony\u2014despite their hatred of my brother.</p><p>They hate him because he\u2019s Mexican.</p><p>And he\u2019s poor.</p><p>And he was in a gang.</p><p>He\u2019s still batting two out of three, which makes him an unacceptable match for their daughter. She comes from a rich, white, and stuck-up family. I have to give Mr. Ellis, her dad, some credit. He did try to get to know Alex. A while back when he came for a visit to Boulder, he invited Alex to play golf. That was a bad idea. My brother is not the golfing type. One look at his old gang tattoos should\u2019ve been a clue.</p><p>Brittany\u2019s parents haven\u2019t shown up. Not yet, at least. Brittany hopes to have her parents at her side when she walks down the aisle, but plan B is to walk down with Carlos\u2019s girlfriend\u2019s dad, Dr. Westford. Either way, my brother will be waiting for her at the end of the aisle.</p><p>Alex shrugs into his black tuxedo jacket and heads for the door. \u201cJust promise me one thing. If she kicks me out of our room tonight, let me sleep in one of yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, bro,\u201d Carlos says. \u201cI\u2019ve been away from Kiara for nine months. I ain\u2019t sharin\u2019 my hotel room with anyone but her. Besides, your virgin bride\u2019ll want to consummate the marriage.\u201d</p><p>Alex rolls his eyes. I\u2019m pretty sure they consummated their relationship years ago. I\u2019m also pretty sure Carlos knows that fact.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got to tell her,\u201d I say. \u201cBefore the weddin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no time,\u201d Carlos chimes in, totally amused. \u201cNice to start your marriage with lies and deceit. You\u2019re a stellar role model, bro.\u201d He pats Alex\u2019s back.</p><p>\u201cC\u00e1llate, Carlos. I\u2019ll tell her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBefore the ceremony, or after?\u201d I ask.</p><p>From the open windows, harp music starts flowing into the room.</p><p>The three of us look at one another.</p><p>We know our family will never be the same.</p><p>\u201cWell, guys, this is it,\u201d Alex says as he opens the door. He stops suddenly and bows his head. He squeezes his eyes shut. \u201cI wish Paco were here,\u201d he mumbles.</p><p>Paco was Alex\u2019s best friend. He died when he and Alex were seniors in high school. My brother has never gotten over it.</p><p>\u201cMe too,\u201d I say, crossing myself as I think of the one guy who we treated like an honorary Fuentes.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Carlos says. \u201cBut he\u2019s here. You know he\u2019s watchin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>Alex nods, then straightens. If it weren\u2019t for Paco, Alex wouldn\u2019t be here. He\u2019d be in a coffin, too.</p><p>My brothers aren\u2019t aware that I know how Paco died. Hector Martinez, the head of the Latino Blood, shot Paco. Hector also killed my father, and even shot Alex. Hector was the enemy. My life would have been very different if the enemy weren\u2019t dead, because I would have dedicated my life to getting revenge.</p><p>I was eleven when I found out who shot Pap\u00e1 when Alex was six years old and mi\u2019am\u00e1 was pregnant with me. I held back the urge for revenge, but I felt it like a fire slowly burning inside me until Hector\u2019s death years ago made my family safe.</p><p>Just the thought of Hector Martinez can get me riled up. I take a deep breath and follow Alex and Carlos to the processional. We stand near the priest with the rest of the wedding party, and for the moment I forget about the past.</p><p>\u201cAlex, you got the arras?\u201d Carlos asks him.</p><p>The arras are the thirteen gold coins he\u2019ll give Brittany as a symbol of his trust and confidence in her. They\u2019ve been passed down from my grandparents to my parents, which is a good thing, \u2019cause there\u2019s no way my brother would be able to afford the coins otherwise. They\u2019re not having a traditional Mexican wedding since Brittany isn\u2019t Mexicana, but they\u2019ve put some Mexican traditions in the ceremony.</p><p>Alex pats his pockets. \u201cShit. I left the arras in the room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go get \u2019em,\u201d I say, then head back to the makeshift dressing room.</p><p>\u201cHurry,\u201d I hear Carlos and Alex call out behind me.</p><p>I swing open the door to the dressing room and find I\u2019m not alone. A girl about my age is in the room, looking out the window. Her white dress contrasts with her honey-colored skin, and just the sight of her makes me stop in my tracks. She\u2019s smokin\u2019 hot, with dark wavy hair running down her back and a face that reminds me of an angel. She\u2019s obviously a guest at the wedding, but I\u2019ve never met her before. I\u2019d definitely remember her if I had.</p><p>I flash her a smile. \u201c\u00a1Hola! Yo soy Luis. \u00bfQuieres charlar conmigo?\u201d</p><p>She doesn\u2019t say anything.</p><p>I point to the door. \u201cUmm ... la boda va a empezar,\u201d I tell her, but it\u2019s clear by the way she rolls her eyes that she doesn\u2019t really care.</p><p>\u201cDude, speak English,\u201d she says. \u201cThis isn\u2019t Mexico.\u201d</p><p>Whoa. Chica with an attitude in the house. \u201cSorry,\u201d I say. \u201cThought you might be Mexican.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m American,\u201d she says, then holds up a blinged-out cell phone and waves it in the air. \u201cAnd I\u2019m on the phone. It\u2019s a private conversation. Do you mind?\u201d</p><p>The side of my mouth quirks up. She might claim she\u2019s a full-blooded American, but I\u2019d bet my left nut she\u2019s got some Mexican blood running through her feisty veins.</p><p>I pick up the arras and give her a smile. \u201cSave a dance at the reception for me, mi chava.\u201d</p><p>She hangs up with whoever she was talking with and sneers at me. \u201cUgh, you\u2019re one of those guys who flirt and smile to get with a girl, then they dump that poor girl on their ass when they least expect it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, so you\u2019ve heard about me,\u201d I say, then wink at her. She starts to walk out of the room in a huff, but I reach out to stop her. \u201cI was just kiddin\u2019. Don\u2019t take life too seriously, mi chava.\u201d</p><p>The angel gets in my face. She does it to intimidate me, but all it does is fire me up. \u201cHow dare you tell me not to take life too seriously! You don\u2019t even know me.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t usually mess around with girls with attitude. I\u2019ve been around enough of \u2019em to know that muy cre\u00eddas are more trouble than they\u2019re worth. They\u2019ve always intrigued me, though. I can\u2019t help it. I think it\u2019s in the Fuentes blood to mess around with girls who most definitely don\u2019t want to get messed with.</p><p>\u201cLuis, you\u2019re holding up the ceremony,\u201d mi'am\u00e1 calls loudly from the hall. She walks into the room, then raises an eyebrow at the sight of me standing close enough to the angel that if I bent forward the slightest bit I\u2019d be kissing her. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on in here?\u201d she demands, as if we were about to get it on and she got here just in time to break it up.</p><p>\u201cYeah, what\u2019s goin\u2019 on?\u201d I ask the girl, deliberately putting her on the spot.</p><p>The girl holds up the cell. \u201cI was in the middle of a call when he came in here and started to hit on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my son. And you are ...\u201d Mam\u00e1 says, her eyes narrowed into slits. Oh, man. She\u2019s in interrogation mode. You don\u2019t want to meet mi'am\u00e1 when she\u2019s got her mind set on getting information out of you.</p><p>\u201cNikki Cruz,\u201d the girl says with pride. \u201cMy dad was Alex\u2019s surgeon.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Not Mexican, my ass. I was right. This angel has more than a little red, white, and green blood running through her veins. Dr. Cruz was the one who took the bullet out of Alex\u2019s shoulder at the hospital when he got shot years ago. The doctor has been in contact with Alex ever since, keeping tabs on him.</p><p>Mam\u00e1 nods, then scans Nikki Cruz\u2014the surgeon\u2019s daughter\u2014from head to toe. \u201cThe wedding is about to start. \u00c1ndale, Luis.\u201d</p><p>Before I turn around and walk out of the room, I give Nikki a completely arrogant and secret wink/nod that\u2019s sure to once again bring out that Latina attitude in full force.</p><p>She flips me off. She doesn\u2019t do it to amuse me, but it does.</p> <p>I can\u2019t wait for the reception. Like my two older brothers, I don\u2019t ever back down from a challenge, and Nikki Cruz is definitely not one that will surrender easily. By the end of the night I bet I could convince her to be my next girlfriend\u2014well, at least until my flight back home to Colorado.</p><p>6</p><p>Nikki</p><p>I watch as Luis follows his mom out of the room with his arrogant head held high. I was about to hang up with Kendall when he popped into the room and I froze. For a brief second I thought he was Marco. They\u2019re both about the same height, age, and physique.</p><p>When Luis smiled at me and I felt a flicker of attraction, panic swelled inside me. I can\u2019t let my guard down, and a guy like Luis is as dangerous as Marco. I can tell by that smile. He looks innocent enough, but I know better. He might be able to fool other girls, but not me.</p> <p>It\u2019s been two weeks since Marco and I broke up, and the pain is still as raw as it was when he left me on the beach. I never want to feel as desperate and devastated as I did that night. If hatred and bitchiness will protect me, I\u2019ll use it.</p><p>I hold my head high as I walk back to the ceremony. The music starts, and I quickly grab the empty seat between my mom and my younger brother, Ben. Ben is slouched down in his chair, annoyed that Mom and Dad didn\u2019t let him play his handheld video game player. He has to sit here like all the other bored twelve-year-old boys at this wedding.</p><p>My parents and Ben have no clue Marco and I broke up. I didn\u2019t want to talk about it. I also didn\u2019t want my parents to gloat and say We told you so. Ben wouldn\u2019t care since he hardly said two words to Marco the entire time we were dating.</p><p>If my parents had it their way they\u2019d probably want to set up an arranged marriage for me, because they want me with a nice boy who comes from a \u201cgood background.\u201d The last thing I want is my parents picking out my boyfriends or, heaven forbid, my future husband.</p><p>Ben hasn\u2019t had a girlfriend yet. He\u2019s been spared any parental input on his love life, because his love life is nonexistent\u2014unless you count Princess Amotoka from the online game he plays. Needless to say, she\u2019s not real.</p><p>My eyes wander to the front, where Luis is standing next to the rest of the groomsmen. When our eyes meet for a split second, he winks while flashing me a killer smile. I look down, pretending to suddenly be very interested in a stray thread on the bottom of my dress. I feel nauseous.</p> <p>Right behind me I hear a girl whisper loudly, \u201cOmigod! Do you see that hottie with the spiked hair? Omigod, who is he?\u201d</p><p>If she says Omigod again, I\u2019m turning around and slapping her.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Alex\u2019s brother Luis,\u201d someone explains to the Omigod girl.</p><p>\u201cI think he just winked at me,\u201d I hear her squeal.</p><p>I don\u2019t mention that I have a good idea that his wink was meant for me. I force myself to ignore him and focus on the bride and groom. I just wish I wouldn\u2019t find it so hard not to stare at Luis, for the sole reason that I\u2019m doing my best not to stare at him. I hate that.</p><p>The ceremony is just like every other beach wedding ceremony at twilight while the sun is going down. Okay, I admit the whole setting is super cool, but the beach has a negative vibe to me right now. I thought it was my special place with Marco, but it\u2019s not. Being here, staring at Lake Michigan in the background, only reminds me of our breakup.</p><p>The bride, Brittany, is about to walk down the aisle, but she hesitates and glances anxiously at the entrance before taking the arm of an older man about to escort her.</p><p>\u201cPoor girl. Her parents didn\u2019t show,\u201d my mom whispers to me.</p> <p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d I ask.</p><p>Mom shrugs. \u201cI\u2019m not sure. I just overheard some of her bridesmaids talking about it before the ceremony started.\u201d</p><p>Brittany walks down the aisle and looks like she came right out of the pages of a designer bride magazine. The groom, Alex, can\u2019t take his eyes off her.</p><p>As soon as the priest opens his prayer book to start the ceremony, I can\u2019t help but glance at Luis. He\u2019s listening intently to the priest and suddenly has a serious, worried look on his face. I wonder why, until ...</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t get married,\u201d Luis chimes in loudly.</p><p>More than a few gasps come from the crowd. Every guest is in shock.</p><p>This is getting good.</p><p>Alex slaps his hand over his eyes. \u201cYou didn\u2019t,\u201d he says to Luis.</p><p>Luis steps forward. \u201cI just ... Alex, tell her. You can\u2019t start your marriage on a lie.\u201d</p><p>Brittany, whose mouth has been wide open ever since Luis spoke up, lifts her veil and furrows her perfectly plucked eyebrows.</p><p>\u201cTell me what?\u201d She\u2019s turning whiter than her wedding dress, if that\u2019s even possible. I hope the priest or maid of honor, who looks like she wants to murder Alex, is ready to catch her if she passes out.</p><p>\u201cNothin\u2019,\u201d Alex says. \u201cWe\u2019ll talk later, chica. It\u2019s not a big deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t chica me, Alex,\u201d his bride snaps.</p><p>\u201cI think she\u2019s gonna deck him,\u201d Ben murmurs, amused.</p><p>The bride isn\u2019t buying it. Maybe they\u2019re about to come to the realization that happily-ever-after doesn\u2019t exist. \u201cIt\u2019s a big-enough deal for your brother to stop our wedding,\u201d Brittany argues.</p><p>\u201cThis is ridiculous,\u201d Alex growls. He mumbles something to the best man, who seems more amused than shocked.</p><p>I feel a sisterhood bond with Brittany, even if she\u2019s not aware of it.</p><p>Alex\u2019s mom, sitting in the front row, has her head bent as if she\u2019s watching an ant on the ground and it\u2019s the most interesting thing she\u2019s ever seen. I think I just saw her crossing herself. When she looks up again, she\u2019s got daggers in her eyes as she glares at Alex and Luis.</p><p>With nowhere to run except through the crowd or escape into the Lake Michigan water, Alex says, \u201cWe\u2019re movin\u2019 back here.\u201d</p><p>Brittany blinks a few times. She cocks her head to the side as if she didn\u2019t hear him right. \u201cHere? As in Chicago?\u201d</p><p>All I can think is, Oh, Alex, you\u2019re clueless. Looking around at the other guests watching this drama unfold, I notice a couple of girls two rows in front of me not too upset by the chain of events unfolding before our eyes. I think they\u2019ve got the hots for Alex, and won\u2019t be disappointed if he\u2019s suddenly single. I\u2019m sure the Omigod girl is available behind me, although Alex is probably too old for her.</p><p>Brittany backs away from Alex. \u201cAnd you didn\u2019t tell me because ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you were busy plannin\u2019 this weddin\u2019, and studyin\u2019 for finals, and, to be honest, I didn\u2019t want you to start freakin\u2019 out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo my opinion doesn\u2019t matter? What about my sister?\u201d Brittany points to the girl in the wheelchair next to the maid of honor. \u201cI\u2019m not leaving her in Colorado.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you two like to take a break and discuss this privately?\u201d the befuddled priest asks.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Brittany snaps. \u201cI don\u2019t want to go anywhere with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s your wedding,\u201d the priest reminds her. \u201cUmm ...\u201d He looks at his Bible, as if that has the answers to help the couple mend their problems.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just get married and discuss this later,\u201d Alex tells her. \u201cYou\u2019ll agree once you hear me out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re supposed to be a team and make decisions together, Alex. Lying is a deal-breaker.\u201d</p><p>Yes! She\u2019s finally getting it. He lied. Boys always lie. I want to scream Break it off with him while you have the chance! but I restrain myself.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t lie, chica. I just delayed mentionin\u2019 it for a little while. This is not a deal-breaker.\u201d</p><p>She crosses her arms on her chest. \u201cMaybe it is for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarry me, Brittany, \u2019cause you know it\u2019s gonna happen anyway. Shelley will be with us, I promise. This is all about keepin\u2019 us together.\u201d</p><p>He closes the distance between them. Without another word, he pulls her to him and kisses her with lips, a peek of tongue, and ... I think I hear some breathless sighs coming from the guests. Nobody can take their eyes off that sensual kiss full of passion.</p><p>Don\u2019t fall for it! I want to scream, but I can tell it\u2019s no use. Her bridal bouquet falls to the ground as she wraps her arms around his neck.</p><p>I glance at the girl behind me. The Omigod girl is all dreamy-eyed as she watches the make-out session. All the girls are looking like that. I can just imagine their minds racing, wondering if they\u2019ll have as much chemistry with their boyfriends/husbands one day. With that thought, I glance at Luis again.</p><p>He\u2019s looking right at me, and a shock wave runs through me. So what if we have chemistry. Chemistry doesn\u2019t miraculously turn bad boys into good ones.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m mad at you for keeping something important from me,\u201d Brittany says to Alex, although her conviction has definitely been compromised after that kiss.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Alex says. \u201cI promise I have no other secrets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I do,\u201d she says. \u201cAs long as we\u2019re spilling secrets I might as well tell you mine.\u201d She looks down at her stomach and places her hand over her midsection. When she looks back up at him, her eyes are glassy. \u201cAlex, I\u2019m pregnant.\u201d</p><p>My stomach clenches in response.</p><p>7</p><p>Luis</p><p>When I objected to the wedding, I didn\u2019t know it would turn into the Fuentes Family Circus. I just wanted Alex to come clean to Brittany.</p><p>That\u2019s it.</p><p>I had no clue my soon-to-be sister-in-law is pregnant. Oh man, seeing our ma\u2019s face when Brittany announced the news was classic\u2014her face turned bright red.</p><p>I\u2019m glad it\u2019s over, though. Brittany said \u201cI do\u201d and my brother said \u201cI do\u201d and she didn\u2019t toss the arras back at him, and Brittany Ellis is now Brittany Fuentes.</p><p>My brother is going to be a father ... man, I can\u2019t believe it. Neither can he. After the initial shock, he hasn\u2019t stopped smiling, and at one point he even knelt down and kissed Brittany\u2019s stomach over her wedding dress.</p><p>I look across the room at everyone dancing on the moonlit dance floor having fun.</p><p>Mi'am\u00e1 comes up to me. She\u2019s still flushed, but I can\u2019t be sure if it\u2019s from the shocking news she\u2019s going to be a grandmother, the fact that I saw my cousin Jorge make her do shots of tequila, or if the realization hit that she just married off one of her three kids. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I\u2019ve already danced with all of my female cousins at least twice. And Brittany\u2019s single friends who didn\u2019t bring a date. One girl was seriously on the prowl and grabbed my ass a few times while we were dancing. I think she\u2019s one of Brittany\u2019s sorority sisters. She has no clue I\u2019m fifteen, because she asked me what frat I was in.</p><p>I look over at Nikki Cruz, the one person who\u2019s not having fun.</p><p>She\u2019s sitting at one of the tables by herself. I swear the chick looks like she\u2019d be happier taking a final exam than being at this wedding.</p><p>I head over to her. \u201cYou might want to think of smilin\u2019 at some point tonight,\u201d I tell her. \u201cIt\u2019s a weddin\u2019, you know.\u201d</p> <p>She looks up at me with big eyes that I swear are made of brown silk. It\u2019s dark out, but the lights make her eyes shine.</p><p>\u201cSmiling is overrated,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cHow would you know if you haven\u2019t tried it?\u201d I take the chair next to her and straddle it. \u201cCome on, I dare you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo away.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s bitter, and trying her hardest to have a shitty time tonight.</p> <p>I fold my arms on the back of the chair. \u201cDid you know smilin\u2019 reduces the level of stress hormones in your body like epinephrine and dopamine? Seriously, even a fake smile\u2019ll help. Try it.\u201d</p><p>She ignores me, so I cup my hands over my mouth and do something I haven\u2019t done in years\u2014barnyard sounds. I start with my imitation of a sheep and end with an impressive moo. Girls used to eat it up when I did them back in fifth grade. They\u2019d hang around me for entertainment, which is just what I wanted at the time. Guys who didn\u2019t have any entertainment value were ignored. I was a kid who refused to be ignored.</p><p>I still refuse to be ignored.</p><p>I look at Nikki while I\u2019m doing the sounds, but I get zero reaction from her. Nada.</p><p>Until she scans me up and down like I\u2019m a creature from another planet. \u201cAre you for real?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs real as they come, mi chava.\u201d I stand and hold out my hand. \u201cDance with me.\u201d</p> <p>She eyes my scabs and winces. \u201cWhat happened to your hand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLong story involving me and a snake. The snake won.\u201d</p><p>She obviously doesn\u2019t believe me. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you dance with that girl over there?\u201d she says, pointing to this girl I was introduced to named Yvette. She\u2019s one of Brittany\u2019s aunts\u2019 cousin\u2019s kids or something like that. She\u2019s got dyed blond hair and a fake tan. Brittany said she\u2019s on the swim team at school, and last year won state in the two-hundred-yard freestyle. Great body, but not my type.</p><p>\u201cYou want me to dance with someone besides you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she says, sticking her cute nose in the air like a princess.</p><p>I shrug. \u201cSuit yourself.\u201d</p><p>Whatever. If that\u2019s the way she wants it, she can sit here and be miserable. I look at the dance floor. My three-hundred-pound aunt Rosalita is waving me over. Last time I danced with her, she stepped on my foot and almost crushed my bones.</p><p>Just as I\u2019m about to leave Nikki alone to drown in her own misery, Alex pats me on my shoulder. Standing next to him is Dr. Cruz, Nikki\u2019s father.</p> <p>\u201cAlex tells me you\u2019ll be applying to Purdue to study aeronautics engineering after graduating high school,\u201d Dr. Cruz says to me with the slightest hint of an accent.</p><p>I stand. \u201cThat\u2019s the plan, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood for you. I really respect that you\u2019re following in your brothers\u2019 footsteps and working hard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI respect that, too,\u201d the woman standing behind him says. Nikki\u2019s mom, obviously. \u201cIt\u2019s admirable. Boys who have drive and ambition will definitely go far in life.\u201d</p><p>I think I hear Nikki snort when I get her parental approval.</p><p>Dr. Cruz pats Nikki on the top of the head. \u201cI see you\u2019ve met my daughter, Nikki.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefinitely. I asked her to dance, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>Dr. Cruz practically drags his daughter off the chair. \u201cDance with Luis.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t feel good,\u201d she mumbles.</p><p>\u201cCome on, sweetheart. At least pretend to have fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to have fun or pretend to have fun, Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be rude,\u201d her mother scolds, then urges her toward me. \u201cDance with the boy.\u201d</p><p>I hold out my elbow for Nikki to take, but she struts her hot little Latina body to the dance floor without waiting for me.</p><p>\u201cGood luck,\u201d Dr. Cruz calls out to me.</p><p>A fast song is playing, and Nikki starts dancing with a bunch of people randomly. I watch her as she pretends to loosen up. I know she\u2019s faking it because she\u2019s not really smiling ... she\u2019s not frowning, either. She\u2019s just ... here.</p><p>I try and dance close to her, watching as her body moves to the music. She\u2019s not a good dancer ... she\u2019s downright awful. She doesn\u2019t seem to notice she looks ridiculous as she jerks her body like a robot around the dance floor. She won\u2019t even look at me. In fact, she\u2019s busy moving from group to group so nobody can claim her as their partner.</p><p>Until a slow song comes on.</p><p>Nikki stops abruptly. I reach out for her waist and gently urge her toward me. We\u2019re face-to-face now. She looks up at me with long eyelashes that almost touch her eyebrows and eyes that I could melt into if she\u2019d let me. There\u2019s no mistaking the electricity pulsing through the air between us. If we got together, it would be explosive ... in a really good way. She\u2019s intimidating, which is sexy as all hell. I don\u2019t get intimidated easily.</p><p>\u201cHola, coraz\u00f3n,\u201d I say, and wiggle my eyebrows at her.</p><p>I expect her to smile.</p><p>Or laugh.</p><p>I don\u2019t expect her to knee me in the nuts and say \u201cFuck you.\u201d</p><p>Which is exactly what Nikki Cruz does.</p><p>8</p><p>Nikki</p><p>I didn\u2019t mean to knee Luis in the nuts.</p><p>Okay, so that\u2019s not entirely true. I meant to knee him where it counts. I just didn\u2019t mean to do it hard\u2014in front of everyone, including the bride and groom. And my parents. And his mother. And everyone else who happened to be on the dance floor at the time.</p><p>While Luis grabs his crotch and winces in pain, I walk away and head for the women\u2019s restroom. Sprint is more like it. Maybe if I distance myself quickly, nobody will know that Dr. Cruz\u2019s daughter is a complete mess. Fat chance, I know.</p><p>I lock myself in a stall, content to stay here forever if it means I don\u2019t have to face the rest of the world for a while. After about five minutes of pretending that I don\u2019t exist and wishing I were a fictional character in one of Ben\u2019s stupid video games, I think the coast is clear ... until I hear the click of a woman\u2019s shoes and a knock on my stall door.</p><p>Knock, knock, knock. \u201cNikki, it\u2019s your mother,\u201d she says, her knuckles rapping on the door. \u201cOpen up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if I don\u2019t want to?\u201d</p><p>Her response is more knocking.</p><p>I open the door slowly. \u201cHi,\u201d I say, forcing a smile.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t Hi me, young lady. You completely embarrassed me and your father out there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d I say dumbly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not the one who needs an apology. What in God\u2019s name came over you, Nikki?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d If I told her, then she\u2019d know about my secret. I can\u2019t tell her; not now when I\u2019m trying to figure out what to do. \u201cI just ... it was an accident.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn accident?\u201d Mom asks, not convinced in the least. She takes a deep breath. \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on with you, but hurting people and embarrassing yourself and your family isn\u2019t the answer.\u201d</p><p>I know that. But I couldn\u2019t stand there while Luis\u2019s strong hands wrapped around my waist. I wanted to lay my head on his chest and pretend he was my knight in shining armor willing to avenge my honor. But that was a fantasy. When he spoke to me in Spanish, it reminded me too much of Marco and the biggest mistake of my life. I have no knight, no honor.</p><p>\u201cI suppose you want me to apologize.\u201d</p><p>She nods. \u201cYes, I do. Sooner rather than later.\u201d</p><p>I watch as Mom walks out of the room, leaving me alone. It\u2019s her way of making the apology my own decision, as if she\u2019s not forcing me to do it. I close the door again and lean my head back against the stall door.</p><p>I know I\u2019m being irrational. All Mexican boys aren\u2019t like Marco, just like all Mexican American girls aren\u2019t like me. Actually, most Mexican girls I know speak Spanish and have at least a few other Mexican neighbors. I don\u2019t. Maybe I judged Luis harshly, but then again, I probably pegged him perfectly.</p><p>I hear the door open and the tap-tap-tap of more heeled shoes on the bathroom floor.</p><p>\u201cOmigod, I can\u2019t believe that girl who danced like a freak kicked Luis and left him on the dance floor!\u201d I hear one of the girls say.</p><p>I didn\u2019t kick him. I used my knee, but I\u2019m not about to clear up her little mistake. Not now, at least.</p><p>\u201cDid you get a glimpse of his lips?\u201d the other girl says. \u201cYum.\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes.</p><p>\u201cI know, right? I told him I\u2019d help heal his wounds. I\u2019m meeting him over by the pier in five minutes. I\u2019ll bring back a report on how kissable his lips really are.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a pause, so I peek through the little space between the door and stall. The Omigod girl is pushing up her boobs to make her cleavage pop out of her dress like butt cheeks. She turns to her friend. \u201cHow do I look?\u201d</p><p>I take that as my cue to come out of the stall and show myself. As soon as they realize they aren\u2019t alone, they look at me, then at each other. I pretend to fix my hair and makeup in the big mirror right next to them.</p><p>I decide to give them my two cents. Not because they asked for it, but because they need it.</p><p>\u201cBeware of guys who look like Luis,\u201d I say. \u201cGuys like that will use you, then leave you when someone else comes along.\u201d</p><p>Omigod girl puts her hand on her hip and looks me up and down. \u201cWhat makes you think I actually care?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just trying to help. You know, girl bonding and all that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGirl bonding?\u201d the girl says in a mocking tone. \u201cI don\u2019t bond with girls who dance like they\u2019re having a seizure. And I don\u2019t hate guys, like you obviously do.\u201d</p><p>Her friend is laughing now. Omigod girl joins her. They\u2019re laughing at me, just like the girls were at Malnatti\u2019s the night I saw Marco kissing Mariana Castillo. I shouldn\u2019t care, but I do.</p><p>I walk out of the bathroom, leaving Omigod girl and her friend to gossip on their own.</p><p>I don\u2019t hate guys. I\u2019m just ... cautious.</p><p>My mom stops me as I pass her. \u201cDid you apologize to Luis yet?\u201d she asks.</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cI was just about to,\u201d I say quickly, then attempt a fake search for Luis.</p><p>I wander up and down the beach, taking my time heading back to the party. The lick of the waves against the shore and the fresh smell of the air brings me back to the day I told Marco I loved him ...</p><p>The night I found out I was pregnant.</p><p>I\u2019d do anything not to see the disappointment and horror on my parents\u2019 faces when they learn that their fifteen-year-old daughter got knocked up by the ex-boyfriend they\u2019d never liked. At some point I need to tell them the truth: that I took a pregnancy test and it came out positive, but just thinking about it makes me want to cry. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>While the party is still going strong into the night, I sit on a rock far down the beach and look out at the seemingly endless expanse of water. I sit for a long time, listening to the faint music coming from the wedding. Every now and then I get a stomach cramp that hurts like crazy, but it slowly eases as I breathe in and out with smooth, controlled breaths.</p><p>Enough sulking, Nikki. Get up and move on ... literally and figuratively, a voice inside my head instructs.</p><p>I stand up and head back to the party. As I\u2019m walking and thinking about how I\u2019m going to gather up the nerve to apologize to Luis, then go home and have the dreaded talk with my parents, I trip on something soft. I look down and realize I just tripped on clothes. Guy clothes ... namely a tuxedo.</p><p>I look around and see two silhouettes kissing in the water.</p> <p>Luis and Omigod girl. Her annoying squeal echoes through the air. I can tell she\u2019s with Luis because ... well, every time I glanced at him tonight, his image was etched in my brain. Even in shadow, I instinctively know it\u2019s him.</p><p>I can\u2019t believe he can fool around with Omigod girl knowing that she\u2019s just a one-night stand. I realize I\u2019m angry with Marco and transferring my emotions onto Luis, but they\u2019re too similar.</p><p>Evil thoughts are running through my mind, like snatching his tuxedo so he\u2019s left without clothes. I shouldn\u2019t do it.</p><p>But then again ...</p><p>Without really thinking it through for fear I\u2019ll lose my nerve, I snatch up Luis\u2019s tuxedo jacket, shirt, pants, boxers, and shoes. I take Luis\u2019s wallet from his pocket and leave it in the sand. No use in having him think I stole his wallet, after all.</p> <p>I toss the clothes behind a rock and head back to the reception area. I wish I could see his face when he has to search, all naked, for his clothes. I left them where he can easily find them ... in the light of day. He\u2019s gonna have to work for it in the moonlight.</p><p>Yes! For the first time in weeks, I feel empowered.</p><p>\u201cYo, Nik,\u201d Ben says. \u201cMom and Dad have been looking for you. We\u2019re about to leave.\u201d</p><p>Mom and Dad say their good-byes to practically everyone at the wedding. I stand behind them and add my polite thanks to theirs, without a hint that I\u2019ve just stashed Luis\u2019s tux where he might not find it.</p><p>\u201cWhat were you doing on the beach?\u201d Ben asks me as I get into Dad\u2019s car.</p><p>\u201cApologizing to Luis,\u201d I lie. Obviously I didn\u2019t do that much damage to his lower region if he was fooling around an hour later.</p> <p>Dad pulls out of the parking lot, down the winding driveway, past the house where the wedding was held, and then onto the small road leading away from a neighboring hotel the guests are probably staying at tonight. Ben, sitting beside me, is busy playing with some app on his phone.</p><p>Looking out the window, I see a naked Luis holding his wallet over his crotch while trying to sneak into the hotel. He freezes when we pass, probably hoping to avoid being noticed.</p><p>But I notice him.</p><p>And he notices me.</p><p>With a genuine smile that hasn\u2019t crossed my face in forever, I roll down my window and give him a small private wave.</p><p>Instead of being embarrassed, he drops the wallet and salutes me with one hand and waves back to me with the other.</p><p>Which means he\u2019s fully exposed.</p><p>Don\u2019t look at anything but his face, Nikki. Whatever you do, don\u2019t give him the satisfaction of scanning down.</p> <p>In the end, Luis Fuentes gets the best of me. I couldn\u2019t help but look. His body is leaner and more ripped than Marco\u2019s, and seeing him in all his glory definitely showcases their differences.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you apologized to Luis,\u201d Mom chimes in quietly when we\u2019re almost home.</p><p>\u201cYep,\u201d I tell her.</p><p>Any tiny ounce of glee I might have fades as my stomach clenches again. And again. I feel like I\u2019m going to throw up. A dizziness washes over me, and I close my eyes until Dad pulls into our driveway.</p><p>Mom turns around and frowns when we\u2019re home. \u201cDon\u2019t embarrass us like that again. You\u2019re not trash, so don\u2019t act like it.\u201d</p><p>I grab the handle and ease myself out of the car. A sharp pain in my side makes me wince. \u201cI know,\u201d I manage to say through clenched teeth.</p><p>\u201cYou know how to act like a lady,\u201d Mom says.</p><p>I just need to throw up, then I\u2019ll be fine. Ben has already booked it into the house. I can\u2019t talk because I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll lose the entire contents of my stomach right here.</p><p>Mom sighs in frustration. \u201cLook at me when I\u2019m talking to you, young lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, Mom,\u201d I force myself to say. \u201cI\u2019m just ... not feeling good.\u201d</p><p>I walk upstairs, but I stop when my stomach clenches and I keel over in pain. I suck in a breath, not being able to stand it. It feels like something is cutting me open from the inside.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d Mom asks as she comes up behind me. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Nikki?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d I look at her and know I can\u2019t lie any longer. Especially when I feel a trickle of wetness running down my inner thigh. My heart is racing and I\u2019m feeling faint. Another shot of pain runs right through me.</p><p>My knees buckle, and I curl up in the fetal position at the top of the stars because it hurts so bad.</p><p>\u201cRaul!\u201d my mom screams.</p><p>My dad is kneeling at my side in an instant. \u201cNikki, where\u2019s the pain?\u201d he asks just like a doctor would, but with a hint of panic behind his words. He\u2019s a surgeon, but I bet he\u2019s not prepared for this.</p><p>I can\u2019t delay the truth any longer.</p><p>I don\u2019t look into either of their faces as I cry in a soft whisper, \u201cI\u2019m pregnant ... and I think something\u2019s really wrong.\u201d</p><p>Now I can see blood trickling down my leg.</p><p>Mom gasps, then holds on to the railing for support.</p><p>My dad stares at me with eyebrows furrowed in confusion. He\u2019s completely stunned for a second, as if time has stopped, but quickly snaps out of it as reality sets in. \u201cAll right. Let\u2019s get you to the hospital,\u201d he says, not in a panic but like a doctor with a purpose. He picks me up and carries me down the stairs while Mom calls our neighbor and asks her to come over to stay with Ben.</p><p>My parents help me get in the front seat while the pain increases with every second that passes. In the car on the way to the hospital, I glance at my dad. I\u2019ve never seen him look this worried or sad. When I started hanging out with Marco almost daily, he warned me to stay away from him. That boy is nothing but trouble, he\u2019d said one day when he came home to find us making out in the pool in our backyard. I don\u2019t want you hanging around with him. He\u2019ll get you into trouble. Mom agreed with him.</p><p>I thought they were judging Marco just because he lived on the south side. I was wrong.</p><p>I look over at my dad. He\u2019s got a death grip on the steering wheel, and he\u2019s focused on the road.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, I\u2019m so sorry, I\u2019m so sorry,\u201d I say over and over as the pain gets sharper and sharper.</p><p>He sighs heavily. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you hate me?\u201d I hold my breath, waiting for the answer.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m disappointed in you, Nicolasa,\u201d he says, calling me by my formal name he never uses unless he\u2019s really upset. He doesn\u2019t say anything more than that.</p><p>\u201cNo matter what, we love you,\u201d Mom says encouragingly from the backseat. \u201cHow did this happen? When? Where? We don\u2019t condone\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaria, not now,\u201d Dad tells her.</p><p>Mom stops her questions, but they linger in the air between us.</p><p>At the hospital, Dad makes sure I get admitted immediately. They do all these blood tests, and the specialist, Dr. Helene Wong, orders an ultrasound. I\u2019m trying to hold in my tears, but it\u2019s no use. After the ultrasound, Mom holds my hand. She doesn\u2019t say much. I think she\u2019s too scared and shocked to say anything, so she lets Dad and the other doctors do all the talking.</p><p>After Dr. Wong orders a second ultrasound and I\u2019m put on an IV, Mom sits on one side of my hospital bed and Dad sits on the other. The doctor is standing next to them with my test results in her hand.</p><p>\u201cYou have an ectopic pregnancy,\u201d she says, then explains why I need to have emergency surgery because they suspect my fallopian tube has started to rupture. Mom has her hand over her mouth as tears fall down her cheeks. Dad nods stiffly as he listens to Dr. Wong.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going to happen to my baby?\u201d I ask in a panic.</p><p>Dr. Wong touches my shoulder. \u201cThere\u2019s no way to save the baby,\u201d she explains.</p><p>I start crying again. The second I realized that I was really and truly pregnant, I\u2019d hoped that the pregnancy wasn\u2019t real. Did my negative thoughts make my body reject the baby? Deep sorrow and a mountain of guilt that I know I\u2019ll carry around forever settle in my gut.</p><p>Another wave of pain hits, and I grab my stomach.</p><p>As my parents sign the waivers, the reality of what\u2019s happening is making me shake.</p><p>\u201cWill I still be able to have kids in the future?\u201d I ask Dr. Wong before she leaves the room to prep for the surgery.</p><p>She nods. \u201cOne tube will be damaged, but your other one is healthy. You should be able to conceive without too much trouble.\u201d</p><p>After the IV is in, and they\u2019re ready to wheel me into surgery, I look over at my parents. I want to say something to them, but I know if I do I\u2019ll burst into sobs.</p><p>Mom gives me a small, tight smile. She\u2019s disappointed in me. I don\u2019t blame her.</p><p>Dad holds my hand until I\u2019m wheeled into surgery. \u201cWe\u2019ll be right here waiting until you come out.\u201d</p><p>The operating room is cold and smells like canned air. I\u2019m being hooked up to monitors and Dr. Wong tells me I\u2019m going to be feeling sleepy as they put something in my IV. As I fall into a deep slumber, I vow to forget about Marco and forget about our baby who never had a chance.</p><p>Luis Fuentes reminded me that I\u2019m still vulnerable. If I\u2019m emotionally unavailable, then I don\u2019t have to worry about ever getting hurt. When this nightmare is over, I\u2019m going to be a different person ... Nikki Cruz will no longer be vulnerable.</p><p>9</p><p>Luis</p><p>TWO YEARS AND TWO MONTHS LATER</p><p>Fairfield, Illinois.</p><p>If you would\u2019ve told me two weeks ago I\u2019d be moving back to Illinois after fleeing this place when I was eleven, I\u2019d have laughed. In all that time I came back to Illinois once, for my brother\u2019s wedding more than two years ago.</p><p>Now I\u2019m seventeen and back for good.</p><p>I\u2019m about to start my senior year. I know every teacher, every student, and every inch of Flatiron High in Colorado, where I went for the past three years of high school. If I had a choice, I wouldn\u2019t have come back to Fairfield. But I\u2019m Mexican, and my culture is all about loyalty to family.</p><p>Duty to family brought us back. Alex and Brittany are living here with my little nephew, Paco. We saw them last night, as soon as we arrived. Brittany\u2019s pregnant again, and mi'am\u00e1 says she\u2019s not going to miss out on watching her grandchildren grow up.</p><p>We\u2019re standing in front of the old house we used to rent. It\u2019s a two-bedroom house, bigger than a shack but smaller than most homes on my block. It\u2019s clear that the Latino Blood don\u2019t have as big a presence in Fairfield anymore. The spray-painted tagging of buildings and street signs is gone, and nobody is looking at cars driving down the street as if they might be rival gang members about to do a drive-by. The presence of a police car parked in the street makes me question my initial observations, though. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I know why mi'am\u00e1 wanted to come back and live in this town, in our old house. It\u2019s not just because Fairfield is close to Evanston, where Alex and Brittany live. It\u2019s because of the past ... the memories of mi pap\u00e1 she\u2019s desperate to hold on to.</p><p>I watch as mi'am\u00e1 puts the key in the lock, takes a big breath, then opens the door. She sent in a deposit and a check for the first month\u2019s rent while we were still in Colorado, for fear that someone else would snatch it up. I didn\u2019t tell her she had nothing to worry about, that nobody would be standing in line to rent the dump we used to call home.</p><p>I was wrong.</p><p>We stand in the small living room, and I do a double take. The old, ripped carpeting has been replaced by new hardwood floors. The walls have been freshly painted a bright white. I hardly recognize the place.</p> <p>\u201cLuis, look!\u201d mi'am\u00e1 says as she steps into the kitchen and runs her hand over the new granite counters and stainless steel appliances. She smiles wide, then hugs me tight in excitement. \u201cIt\u2019s a new beginning for us.\u201d</p><p>A loud knock on the front door echoes through the house. \u201cIt might be Elena. She said she was going to stop by after work,\u201d mi'am\u00e1 says, hurrying to open the door.</p><p>I\u2019m about to check out the old bedroom I used to share with Alex and Carlos when I hear mi'am\u00e1 exclaim, \u201cCan I help you, officer?\u201d</p><p>Officer?</p><p>The cops are here?</p> <p>The only experience I\u2019ve had with Fairfield cops was when my brothers got into trouble or when they\u2019d question us about gang activity when I was younger. When most of your family have been gang members, the last thing you want is a police officer knocking on your door. Even though Alex is in grad school and Carlos is in the military, old habits are hard to break.</p><p>I walk into the living room and watch as a cop in uniform smiles wide at mi'am\u00e1. He\u2019s got dark brown hair in a short military cut and is standing in one of those cop stances that means business. \u201cI saw you pull up and wanted to introduce myself,\u201d the guy says, then holds out his hand. \u201cI\u2019m Cesar Reyes, your landlord and next-door neighbor.\u201d</p><p>Mi'am\u00e1 reaches out to shake his hand, then pulls it back quickly as she eyes the gun strapped to his holster. \u201cThanks for introducing yourself, Officer Reyes,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cCall me Cesar.\u201d The cop looks down, noticing what she\u2019s focused on. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to intimidate you, Mrs. Fuentes. I was about to go to work, and I didn\u2019t know the next time I\u2019d catch you home.\u201d His eyes dart to me. \u201cIs that your son?\u201d</p><p>She opens the door wider and steps back, so now I\u2019m in full view. \u201cOfficer Reyes, this is Luis\u2014my youngest.\u201d</p><p>Reyes nods in my direction. \u201cWelcome to the neighborhood.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I mumble, not thrilled to suddenly be living next to a cop who happens to be our landlord.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m having a barbeque at my place Sunday night. You both should hop on over if you get a chance.\u201d</p><p>Neither of us answers.</p><p>He shrugs. \u201cAll right. I guess I\u2019ll see you around then.\u201d He pulls a business card from his front pocket and hands it to mi'am\u00e1. \u201cIf you need anything, don\u2019t hesitate to call.\u201d</p><p>He walks to his car, then drives away.</p><p>\u201cGlad that\u2019s over,\u201d I say.</p><p>Mi'am\u00e1 closes the door slowly, then sighs as she leans against it.</p><p>\u201cYou all right?\u201d I ask her.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. Just ... let\u2019s get started unpacking.\u201d</p><p>On Sunday, Alex calls to say he got me an interview at the Brickstone Country Club in Evanston, which is a twenty-minute walk from our house. I need a job to help out and told Alex to be on the lookout if he hears of any openings. My cousin Enrique has a body shop, but Alex works there already a few days a week, and since the economy turned to shit Enrique doesn\u2019t have enough work for two extra employees.</p><p>At four I head over to Brickstone. It\u2019s a huge place with a private eighteen-hole golf course, Olympic-sized indoor and outdoor pools, and an exclusive dining room solely for club members.</p><p>The interview process doesn\u2019t take long. This lady, Fran Remington, calls me into her office after I fill out an application.</p><p>She puts her hand on her desk and gives me a once-over. \u201cI see here that you\u2019re a straight-A student and were on the soccer and swim teams at your old high school. Tell me, Luis, why do you want a job here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just moved here from Colorado and need to help my mom with bills. I\u2019ve got college applications due in a few months, and those cost a lot of money.\u201d</p><p>She lays the paperwork on her desk. \u201cWhere do you want to go to college?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPurdue University. They\u2019ve got an aeronautics program,\u201d I tell her. \u201cAfter my bachelor\u2019s I plan on applyin\u2019 to NASA\u2019s astronaut trainin\u2019 program.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re ambitious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>She looks over my application again. \u201cYou don\u2019t have any serving experience. I really need a server for the dining room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can do it,\u201d I tell her. \u201cIt\u2019s not a problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur members expect top-notch food and the best service Illinois has to offer. I don\u2019t tolerate any bad attitudes, tardiness, or slovenly employees. When members walk into the club, they\u2019re treated like royalty by each and every person on my staff. Our members pay a tremendous amount of money to be part of this club. They\u2019re demanding, and so am I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can handle it.\u201d</p><p>The woman hesitates just a few more seconds before smiling at me. \u201cI like a young man with ambition like yours. Even though you don\u2019t have experience, I\u2019ll give you a shot. You\u2019ll start as a busboy for a month, then move up to server if you have what it takes. You can start on Saturday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you for the opportunity, ma\u2019am,\u201d I tell her. \u201cI won\u2019t let you down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. It\u2019s settled then.\u201d</p><p>Back at home, I find Officer Reyes standing on our front stoop, wearing jeans and a T-shirt. He\u2019s got a Budweiser in his hand, and he\u2019s talking with mi'am\u00e1. I wouldn\u2019t think anything of it, but the guy has a big grin on his face, and he just touched her elbow as she laughed at something he said.</p><p>Oh, man.</p><p>I know how a guy acts when he\u2019s flirting with a girl, because I do it all the time. There\u2019s no doubt in my mind that our neighbor/landlord/cop has the hots for mi'am\u00e1.</p><p>How the hell am I gonna explain that one to my brothers?</p><p>10</p><p>Nikki</p><p>Ugh, I couldn\u2019t sleep last night. It\u2019s the first day of my senior year, and I\u2019m so ready for it. I\u2019m ready to graduate, get out of Fairfield, and start my life.</p><p>I take a shower, get dressed, then head downstairs for breakfast.</p><p>\u201cYou look nice,\u201d Mom says, eyeing my jeans and turquoise silk tank she bought me when she went shopping in downtown Evanston last week. \u201cHere, I made some eggs for you and Ben.\u201d</p><p>My brother walks into the kitchen, his hair practically falling into his eyes as he reads some gaming magazine. It\u2019s his first day of freshman year and he\u2019s wearing ripped jeans and a T-shirt that has seen better days. You\u2019d think he\u2019d at least dress up for the occasion, but no.</p><p>\u201cBen, you need a haircut,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks,\u201d Ben responds absently as he reads an article about some new combat game coming out with digital graphics. I only know this because I glimpse the title of the article, which says \u201cCombat Forces II\u2014Stunning Digital Graphics!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBen, you do realize that you\u2019re in high school now, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you should take care of your appearance.\u201d</p><p>He sets his gaming magazine on the kitchen table. \u201cI put on a shirt that didn\u2019t have holes in it. That should count for something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt says MAY THE FORCE BE WITH YOU!\u201d</p><p>He looks down at his shirt. \u201cI know ... cool, huh?\u201d</p><p>I look at Mom for support in this.</p><p>\u201cEverybody has their own definition of cool, Nikki,\u201d Mom says.</p><p>Ben gives Mom an exaggerated wink. \u201cDon\u2019t you think it\u2019s time to tell Nikki the truth\u2014that I\u2019ll be a self-made millionaire by the time I\u2019m twenty and Nikki will probably be asking me for loans?\u201d</p><p>Mom sets a plate in front of him and starts heaping eggs and toast onto it. She even pours orange juice into his glass. \u201cThe truth is that you better sit on your butt and eat your breakfast before it gets cold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSocial skills count for a lot, you know,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>\u201cSocial skills are overrated,\u201d my brother says right before he takes a huge bite of bread.</p><p>Mom pats Ben on the shoulder. \u201cStop antagonizing your sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe makes it so easy,\u201d Ben says, then leans back in his chair. \u201cSo who wants to name my next Queen of the Dragon Empire in the game I\u2019m in the middle of coding?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about you name her Nicolasa after your sister?\u201d Mom suggests.</p><p>\u201cI need a tougher name than that,\u201d Ben tells her. \u201cThis is a queen who can yield a sword and wear chain mail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not Bertha?\u201d I jokingly suggest. I hate when Ben starts talking about cartoon characters as if they\u2019re real ... I hate it more when he sucks me in and I actually validate his obsession.</p><p>\u201cQueen Bertha? Nope, doesn\u2019t work for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll think of something.\u201d Mom gets her keys out. \u201cOh, I almost forgot. Nikki, you can\u2019t take your car today. Your father took it in for repairs this morning when he realized that it was leaking oil. Why don\u2019t you two walk to school? Start off the year being active instead of lazy and spoiled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m proud of my laziness,\u201d Ben says, amusing himself. \u201cAnd what\u2019s wrong with being spoiled?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything.\u201d She turns around just as I\u2019m about to finish the last bite of my food and says, \u201cI\u2019ll tell you what ... I\u2019ll drive you both to school because I have to go to work anyway, but you can either walk or take the bus home.\u201d She smiles serenely.</p><p>Having your mommy drive you to school as a senior? \u201cIf Dad took my car, let me take his.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot going to happen,\u201d she says. \u201cUnless you get all As, you\u2019re never getting hold of the keys to his Lexus. It\u2019s a goal to work toward.\u201d</p><p>Ben rolls his eyes. \u201cMom, Nikki has never gotten all As.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, she has,\u201d Mom says.</p><p>Ben laughs. \u201cI\u2019m not talking about kindergarten.\u201d</p><p>I kick my brother under the table. Just because he doesn\u2019t try, hardly studies, and gets all As doesn\u2019t mean he has to be arrogant about it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m having dinner with some clients tonight, so I won\u2019t be home. I\u2019m decorating their house using all antiques,\u201d Mom says excitedly.</p><p>\u201cHave fun,\u201d I tell her, knowing she will. My mom is an interior designer who loves turning boring spaces into themed rooms she calls \u201ceclectic showstoppers.\u201d Each room in our house has a theme and has been turned into one \u201ceclectic showstopper\u201d after another. My life is inundated with themed rooms. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>At school, Kendall is waiting for me by our lockers. At the end of junior year we got to pick any locker in the senior hallway for the next year, so Kendall and I made sure our lockers were right next to each other. That was before she started dating Derek. The two of them have been inseparable since the last day of school, when he showed up at her house with a dozen roses and a song he\u2019d written about her.</p><p>I don\u2019t trust Derek. I know he likes Kendall, but I also know a lot of girls flirt with him and he flirts back. In a moment of male weakness, he can crush Kendall\u2019s trusting heart.</p><p>\u201cJust an FYI,\u201d Kendall says, wincing as if she\u2019s about to share some bad news. \u201cMarco\u2019s locker is right across from ours.\u201d</p><p>A wave of anxiety rushes through me. \u201cPlease tell me you\u2019re lying.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI wish I was.\u201d</p><p>After we broke up, Marco got in really deep with the Latino Blood. I know he\u2019s been selling drugs and getting in fights a lot. Something happened last year to the guy who ran the gang, and the LB presence in the south side of Fairfield got broken up. I heard Marco started hanging out with other gangs besides the LB. He\u2019s gotten meaner and tougher. I used to think he had a hard exterior but was sweet once you really got to know him. Marco is anything but sweet now.</p><p>Derek is walking down the hall, heading straight for us. Of course he\u2019s stopped by practically everyone who calls out his name. Girls are enamored with him because he\u2019s ridiculously gorgeous with blond hair, a model\u2019s face, and a very chiseled body. Guys like him because he\u2019s a major athlete. As a sophomore, he made it to the state championships in tennis. When he hurt his shoulder before junior year, he decided he didn\u2019t want to play tennis and instead went out for the soccer team. He was voted MVP last year at the end of the season, which surprised nobody.</p><p>Derek stands beside Kendall, but she turns her back and pretends to be interested in something in her locker.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019re still mad,\u201d Derek says.</p> <p>Kendall shoves books in her locker. \u201cI\u2019m not mad. You can go to college wherever you want, Derek. You don\u2019t have to get permission from me to apply out east.\u201d</p><p>He puts his hand on the small of her back and leans toward her. \u201cWhy won\u2019t you even look at Ivy League schools?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause they\u2019re not in the Midwest,\u201d she tells him. \u201cYou want to go far from home, fine. I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Kendall isn\u2019t saying it, but she\u2019s committed to staying near Fairfield for college because her mother got diagnosed with cancer last year. She\u2019s gone through chemo and the doctors say she\u2019s in remission, but Kendall doesn\u2019t want to be far away.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you saying, that if I go to school out east it\u2019s over between us?\u201d Derek asks.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p> <p>I decide to put my two cents in the discussion for a reality check. \u201cThe percentage of couples who stay together after high school is, like, less than five percent, you guys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for the vote of confidence, Nikki,\u201d Derek says sarcastically.</p><p>\u201cJust being real,\u201d I tell him. \u201cNo need to have you guys living in Fantasy Land.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope you never go to Disney World,\u201d Derek says to me. \u201cYou\u2019ll probably tell all the little kids there that Mickey Mouse is just a guy in a costume.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>Kendall sighs. \u201cDerek, leave Nikki alone. She\u2019s just protecting me.\u201d</p><p>Derek shakes his head, frustrated. \u201cDammit, Kendall. When are you gonna realize you don\u2019t need protection from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNikki\u2019s my best friend.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m supposed to be your boyfriend.\u201d Derek walks away with a bitter look on his face.</p><p>Kendall leans her head against her locker. I know she\u2019s scared. She was scared of losing her mom, and now she\u2019s scared of losing Derek. I know about being scared, which is why I tell it like it is. Yes, Derek might leave her for another girl. Or go to a college far away and forget about how much he loves her. Or maybe he\u2019s been lying to her about how much he cares about her. That\u2019s reality. Derek might even think he\u2019s being sincere ... but how long will that last?</p><p>\u201cHe hates me,\u201d I tell her.</p><p>\u201cNo, he doesn\u2019t.\u201d She turns to me. \u201cHe just thinks you\u2019re overly cynical.\u201d</p><p>As soon as she says the word cynical, I hear an old familiar voice speaking in Spanish echoing from across the hall. Marco. Just hearing the deep rumble of his voice used to make me grin from ear to ear. Now his voice is like nails on a chalkboard.</p><p>I look over at Kendall. She touches my forearm sympathetically.</p><p>\u201cIgnore him,\u201d she advises.</p><p>Of course I\u2019ll ignore him, just like I\u2019ve done the past two years. He\u2019s changed way too much, and so have I. I pretend to scratch my chin with my shoulder as I peek across the hall at his locker. Marco is talking to some guy who looks familiar ...</p><p>Wait.</p><p>One.</p><p>Second ...</p><p>No, it can\u2019t be.</p><p>It\u2019s Luis Fuentes, the guy whose clothes I hid when his brother got married years ago. The last time I saw him, he was naked. That was so long ago, I bet he doesn\u2019t remember me. I remember him, though. He\u2019s the boy who reminded me that I was vulnerable. The night I met him I became cynical. I glance again.</p><p>Oh, no.</p><p>He\u2019s staring right at me.</p><p>11</p><p>Luis</p><p>Exotic eyes. Wavy brown hair. An attitude a mile long. Older, but she\u2019s still got that unique \u201cangel with an edge\u201d aura about her.</p><p>I\u2019d know that girl anywhere. I could pick her out of a crowd of a thousand girls. She denied her Mexican blood, danced like a robot, and dissed me all in the same night.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Nikki Cruz, \u00bfverdad?\u201d I ask Marco, a friend of mine from grade school. It\u2019s kind of weird how it\u2019s like I never left. I never realized how deep my roots are in this town, even though I\u2019ve been gone from Fairfield for almost six years. I came to school early this morning and got my schedule from the front office. As soon as I walked to my locker, I was recognized by a bunch of old friends I used to hang out with.</p><p>Marco glances at the girl, then nods. \u201cHow do you know Nik?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHad a run-in with her a couple years ago at my brother\u2019s weddin\u2019.\u201d No need to go into detail about how she hid my clothes and left me to fend off the overly aggressive girl I\u2019d been skinny-dipping with that night. \u201c\u00bfCu\u00e1l es su historia?\u201d I ask him.</p><p>\u201cHer story is that she\u2019s filthy rich and has a body made for fuckin\u2019 around,\u201d Marco says. \u201cShe\u2019s a puta. Keep your ass far away from that pocha if you want to stay sane.\u201d</p><p>I look her way and our eyes meet. Does she remember me?</p><p>While Marco talks to a couple guys, I keep my eyes on Nikki. She quickly turns her gaze away, says something privately to the tall blond girl standing next to her, then tosses her hair back and they both strut down the hall without a backward glance.</p><p>I fly through my first two classes; it\u2019s cool to see old friends that I thought I\u2019d never see again. It doesn\u2019t take a rocket scientist to figure out that Marco is hanging with the big boys outside of school. Nobody has to talk about his gang affiliation\u2014it\u2019s obvious. Most of the families who lived in my \u2019hood were connected. Some still are.</p><p>The south side of Fairfield might not be overflowing with active gang members anymore, but we\u2019re still the poor kids at school. The elementary and middle schools weren\u2019t integrated, but the high school merged all the schools from both sides of Fairfield into one multicultural melting pot.</p><p>The first time I realize how different things are here than in Boulder is when we have to change for gym class.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sitting in my spot, Mex,\u201d some beefy white guy says to me as I sit on a bench in the locker room after being handed my gym uniform. \u201cMove.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t help the laugh that escapes my mouth. \u201cMex? Did you just call me Mex?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou heard me. Now go sit your dirty immigrant ass somewhere else.\u201d</p><p>Unlike my brothers, I don\u2019t like to fight and I\u2019m not looking to start one now.</p><p>I casually take off my shoes and remind myself that this guy isn\u2019t worth getting kicked out of school. I\u2019m not gonna let him bully me, though.</p><p>\u201cSorry to break the news to you, gringo,\u201d I tell him. \u201cBut I ain\u2019t movin\u2019. It\u2019s the first day of school. You don\u2019t have a \u2018spot\u2019 yet.\u201d</p><p>Other guys start piling in the locker room. Gringo slams his fist hard on the locker right above my head, causing everyone to look our way.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m warning you,\u201d he growls through clenched teeth, then kicks my shoes across the room.</p><p>I roll my eyes. He wants me to throw the first punch so I\u2019m the one who gets in trouble. He has no clue that I have the patience of a saint. At least that\u2019s what Carlos says, although that isn\u2019t saying much, considering his fuse is about as short as an eyelash.</p><p>Pedro, a guy who lived across the street from me since before we moved, motions to the back of the locker room. \u201cAh, dejalo y muevet\u00e9,\u201d he says to me.</p><p>In other words, avoid the conflict.</p><p>\u201cListen to your friend,\u201d Gringo says, then grabs my T-shirt and attempts to push me away from his precious spot.</p><p>Not happening.</p><p>I push back. He doesn\u2019t expect it, because his body slams against the lockers hard. He loses his balance and lands on his ass with a thud.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna fuckin\u2019 kick your ass!\u201d he screams.</p><p>He\u2019s about to charge his full weight against me when one of his friends stands between us. \u201cDougan, chill out. Seriously, man, it\u2019s not worth getting kicked off the team.\u201d</p><p>Dougan stares me down before turning his back and walking to another row of lockers with his friends following behind him. I sit and take a deep breath. I\u2019m not in Boulder anymore, that\u2019s for damn sure.</p><p>Everyone who has fourth-period lunch ditches the cafeteria and instead chooses to eat outside. The courtyard is filled with students. The south siders sit under the trees, while the north siders have flocked to the picnic tables as if they were personally made for them. I notice Nikki sitting with a bunch of jocks, all vying for her attention. She smiles at them and laughs at their jokes, but I can tell she\u2019s being fake. None of them are holding her attention for long.</p><p>I sit next to my old friends under a big maple tree.</p><p>\u201cSo what you been up to, Fuentes?\u201d Pedro asks as he reaches into a brown paper bag and pulls out his lunch. \u201cBesides pissin\u2019 off Dougan in the locker room.\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cLived in Mexico for a while. Then moved to Colorado.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat made you come back to this shithole?\u201d Marco Delgado asks. He sits across from me and I catch a glimpse of a pocketknife peeking out of his sock.</p><p>\u201cFamilia brought me back,\u201d I tell them.</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of familia,\u201d Marco says. \u201cYour brother Alex used to be a Blood, didn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>I nod.</p><p>I\u2019d be an idiot not to think that subject would come up sooner or later. My brother was an active member of the Latino Blood, until Hector Martinez betrayed him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cChuy got busted a while back.

Once Chuy went down, the rest of the OGs went down with him. My cousin Enrique almost served time, but Alex helped him get a good lawyer who got the case against him dismissed.</p> <p>\u201cYou think Alex had somethin\u2019 to do with the bust?\u201d</p><p>Alex, responsible for bringing down the Latino Blood? I don\u2019t think so. \u201cMy brother isn\u2019t a narc,\u201d I say. Fuentes pride runs deep, and I\u2019ll do anything to protect my brothers and my family name. \u201c\u00bfComprende?\u201d</p><p>Marco nods. \u201cI\u2019ve got no problem with him. It\u2019s all good, man.\u201d</p><p>Mariana Castillo, the girl every guy had a crush on in second grade, sits with us. A bunch of girls follow her lead. Mariana was always the leader of the girls ... whatever she did, the other girls followed. She\u2019s got a flawless complexion, long legs, thick lips, and a gleam in her eyes that reveals a raw and ruthless spirit.</p><p>\u201cWell, well. I guess the rumors are true,\u201d she tells me. \u201cLuis Fuentes has definitely grown up.\u201d</p> <p>Marco laughs. \u201cI think you\u2019ve got yourself a fan club, Luis.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should come out with all of us on Saturday night,\u201d Mariana says.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got to work,\u201d I tell her.</p><p>\u201cThat sucks. What if we\u2014\u201d</p><p>A blaring voice over the loudspeakers scattered throughout the courtyard cuts her off. \u201cLuis Fuentes, please report to Principal Aguirre\u2019s office immediately. Luis Fuentes, report to Principal Aguirre\u2019s office immediately,\u201d the voice bellows again just in case for some miraculous reason I hadn\u2019t heard the first time.</p><p>Marco lets out a low whistle. \u201cIn trouble with Aguirre on the first day of school, Fuentes?\u201d he asks, amused. \u201cHe\u2019s probably been alerted that we were friends back in grade school. Got in our share of trouble, didn\u2019t we?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSure did.\u201d Marco and I had been in the same homeroom and sat next to each other for practically every class. I always earned good grades, but Marco could always convince me to be his partner in crime.</p><p>\u201cDid you get called in, too?\u201d I ask him.</p><p>\u201cFirst thing this mornin\u2019. Aguirre\u2019s a hard-ass and will try to scare you into playin\u2019 by his rules. He\u2019ll try to get you to talk, but keep your mouth shut. It\u2019ll totally piss him off. It\u2019s hilarious watchin\u2019 his face get all red.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bet it has to do with that fight with Dougan in the locker room,\u201d Pedro chimes in.</p><p>\u201cGood luck,\u201d Mariana says.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I say, hoping that I don\u2019t need it.</p><p>I find the front office a few minutes later. An old woman behind the front desk looks frazzled as students stand around impatiently requesting class schedule changes or signing up for appointments with the guidance counselor.</p><p>I figure I\u2019ll wait in line instead of announcing my arrival. I\u2019m not looking forward to facing Aguirre. Marco isn\u2019t the only one who declared him a hard-ass. My brothers warned me that their old principal didn\u2019t take any prisoners.</p> <p>The door opens to Aguirre\u2019s office and a tall guy wearing a suit and tie appears. \u201cFuentes!\u201d he yells above the noise. He scans the room until his eyes lock on mine. He doesn\u2019t look thrilled to see me. \u201cIn my office,\u201d he orders.</p><p>I weave my way through the crowd.</p><p>Aguirre is holding a manila folder with my name typed on it as he sits on the edge of his desk. \u201cCome in, Luis. Sit down.\u201d</p><p>I sit in one of his guest chairs and look around the room. Fairfield High School memorabilia is scattered on the walls, as well as pictures of Aguirre with old alumni. A tennis player, an NFL quarterback, and a news anchor are a few of the alumni pictures posted. Impressive.</p><p>I wonder if in ten years I\u2019ll be in a picture with Aguirre that\u2019s permanently displayed in his office.</p><p>Not right now, though. Right now Aguirre is looking at me with a mixture of annoyance and anger.</p><p>\u201cThe last time I had a Fuentes called into my office, it was your brother Alex. He was a magnet for trouble.\u201d He slaps my file on the table. \u201cI assumed you\u2019d be different, Luis. You were a straight-A student at Flatiron High. That school is ranked as the second-best high school in Colorado for academics. You were in the honor society, active in student council, played soccer, and were cocaptain of the swim team.\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>He leans forward. \u201cSo why the hell are you getting in fights in the locker room?\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Aguirre lets out a deep breath. \u201cIf I had a dollar every time I heard a student say I don\u2019t know, I\u2019d be a millionaire. No, a billionaire. I have a zero tolerance policy. Whatever altercation happened between you and Justin Dougan in the locker room has become my problem. You want to know what I do with my problems?\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t answer.</p><p>He leans forward again and speaks in a quiet, slow voice meant to capture my undivided attention. \u201cMy problems get a detention. After that comes suspension. Three strikes, and you\u2019re expelled.\u201d</p><p>When he takes a blue slip off his desk and hands it to me, I swallow hard. My first detention. I am not, no matter what, going to get two strikes. Even if it means being called Mex for the next nine months.</p><p>\u201cDoes this go in my permanent file?\u201d I ask, looking down at the offending blue slip.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid so.\u201d</p><p>Shit. I briefly have a vision of breaking into the school office in the middle of the night and making the detention disappear. In movies people break into offices and steal files all the time. It would definitely be an adrenaline rush, especially if I was able to pull it off.</p><p>\u201cNow get out of here,\u201d Aguirre says. \u201cI don\u2019t want to see your face back in my office unless it\u2019s to tell me you\u2019re on the honor roll. Keep your head in your books, and we\u2019ll get along just fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that it?\u201d I ask him.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He smiles and opens his arms out wide. \u201cWelcome to Fairfield High.\u201d</p><p>12</p><p>Nikki</p><p>Luis had been talking to Marco and Mariana when he got called to Dr. Aguirre\u2019s office. He walked with confidence and purpose out of the courtyard, and I found myself having a hard time tearing my gaze away until he was out of sight.</p><p>I hope he doesn\u2019t remember me, although I have a strange feeling in the pit of my stomach that he didn\u2019t forget our encounter at his brother\u2019s wedding. How could he? The last image I have is him waving to me ... naked. He looked ridiculously hot back then, and he\u2019s still got the swagger. Just from the way he walks I can tell he knows he\u2019s one of those guys with the \u201cit\u201d factor.</p><p>In the halls, girls were staring at him. He nodded and smiled at every girl who looked his way. Marco was flirting with the girls right along with him, like they were a tag team.</p><p>The next time I see Luis, it\u2019s the last period of the day. Chemistry with Mrs. Peterson. Luis seems amused when he walks in the classroom and finds me sitting in the back row with Kendall and Derek. When the pregnant teacher announces that she assigns partners and we\u2019ll be sitting in alphabetical order, my heart starts racing. My last name starts with a C and Luis\u2019s starts with an F. I panic that we could be assigned as partners, until Mrs. Peterson calls out, \u201cMariana Castillo, you\u2019re partnered with Nikki Cruz.\u201d</p><p>Oh, no. Mariana and I have only one thing in common: our parents were born in Mexico. That\u2019s it.</p><p>Mariana Castillo hated me when Marco and I dated, as if I took away her property. The few times Marco and I hung out with his friends, she\u2019d always glare at me and make sure none of the other south side girls liked me. I was an outcast in their group, but as long as I had Marco by my side I didn\u2019t care. Even though Marco and I aren\u2019t together anymore, Mariana still hates me.</p><p>\u201cEww. How come I get stuck with the fake Latina?\u201d Mariana mumbles.</p><p>\u201cThere isn\u2019t anything fake about me, Mariana. You got a problem with me, go tell Mrs. Peterson.\u201d</p><p>Mariana waves her hand in the air. \u201cMrs. Peterson, Nikki and I can\u2019t be partners.\u201d</p><p>Peterson stops and looks down at Mariana. \u201cYes, you can and yes, you will. Believe me, Miss Castillo, I get complaints every year, and not once have I changed partners.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cZip it, or you\u2019ll get a detention.\u201d</p><p>Mariana shuts her mouth, but sneers at me as Mrs. Peterson goes down the rest of her list.</p><p>Luis is assigned to the table across from ours. Derek is assigned as his partner. I try not to have eye contact with Luis, but I find myself glancing up. Our eyes meet for a brief second before Mrs. Peterson knocks on Luis\u2019s lab table.</p><p>\u201cSo I see I\u2019m blessed with another Fuentes in my class,\u201d our teacher says. \u201cYour brother Alex was one of my more ... challenging students. I guess I should give you the same lecture I gave your brother, Mr. Fuentes. No talking unless it\u2019s lab time, and even that isn\u2019t supposed to be used for chatter and gossip. It\u2019s for work. Get it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot it,\u201d Luis says, giving her a cocky thumbs-up.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s hope you\u2019re better than your brother at following directions. Oh, and that reminds me ...\u201d She regards the rest of the class. \u201cI have a zero tolerance policy. No cell phones allowed, even if it\u2019s an emergency from your parents, your friends, your boyfriends or girlfriends, your dog, or even God. They can call the front office if it\u2019s important enough. In addition, no gang-related clothing,\u201d she says, looking right at Luis and then eyeing the rest of the class, \u201cand no threats against any student or you\u2019ll be out of my class permanently. I have detentions ready to hand out for anyone not following my rules. Now, take five minutes and introduce yourselves to your partner. Tell them interesting things about yourself, including your hobbies or what you did over the summer. Then you\u2019ll introduce your partner to the class.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe I have to partner with you,\u201d Mariana mumbles.</p><p>\u201cThe feeling is mutual,\u201d I mumble back.</p><p>Mariana picks up her notebook and turns to the first page. \u201cSo talk, so I can write something down and not get kicked out of class. I know you\u2019re a rich bitch who used to date Marco Delgado until he broke up with you. Anything else I should share with the class?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust tell the class that I help disabled dogs get adopted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously, that\u2019s wack,\u201d Mariana says with a grimace. \u201cYou tell the class that I got a hundred thousand views on the YouTube video I made.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoing what?\u201d I ask, wondering if she did a striptease act. Or maybe it was an instructional video on how to properly take a bong hit. I\u2019m sure Mariana\u2019s name wasn\u2019t on the drug-free petition some freshman passed around last year for their community service project.</p><p>\u201cI sing and dance ... better than you, I\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>I write that piece of information down to share with the class when it\u2019s my turn. Little does she know that dancing better than me is no difficult feat. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Luis introduces Derek, then Derek talks about how Luis moved here from Colorado but used to live in Fairfield when he was younger.</p><p>After the introductions there\u2019s time left, so Mrs. Peterson takes us on a tour of the lab. She tells us it was updated over the summer, and explains why there\u2019s a shower stall in the back of the room.</p><p>\u201cLast year we had an ... incident with some of my students who didn\u2019t listen to my instructions. Let\u2019s just say that the school board decided that installing a hazardous chemicals washing area might be necessary. None of you should ever need this shower, but if for any reason any one of you gets a chemical on your skin and you\u2019re having a reaction, wash it off immediately. You don\u2019t need to raise your hand and ask permission.\u201d</p><p>While we\u2019re standing in front of the shower, my phone starts to vibrate. Crap. It\u2019s in my back pocket. I totally forgot to turn it off. As if that\u2019s not bad enough, it rings so loud that now everyone is staring at me. I ignore it, hoping Mrs. Peterson doesn\u2019t realize it\u2019s mine and praying that the call transfers to voice mail before the next ring.</p> <p>\u201cYou better turn that off,\u201d Kendall murmurs in my ear. \u201cRumor has it Peterson\u2019s got a cell phone collection worth thousands.\u201d</p><p>Too late.</p><p>\u201cMs. Cruz?\u201d</p><p>I squeeze my eyes shut for a moment, wishing I could magically transplant myself to another classroom. \u201cYes?\u201d I answer meekly.</p><p>Mrs. Peterson is standing in front of me now. \u201cGo ahead, answer it.\u201d</p> <p>I hesitate.</p><p>\u201cTake your phone out of your pocket and answer it,\u201d she orders again. \u201cBefore I go into labor, please.\u201d</p><p>I slide it out of my pocket and press the answer button, when, to my complete horror, Mrs. Peterson motions to hand the phone to her.</p><p>She puts it to her ear. \u201cHello, this is Nikki\u2019s phone,\u201d she says into the receiver as if she\u2019s my personal secretary.</p><p>She covers the mouthpiece and whispers loudly so everyone can hear, \u201cIt\u2019s Dara from Razzle Salon, confirming your bikini and eyebrow wax appointment.\u201d Pause. \u201cThis is Mrs. Peterson, Nikki\u2019s chemistry teacher.\u201d Pause. \u201cDara says she\u2019s running late, so she\u2019s calling to see if you can come at six instead of four today.\u201d</p><p>I feel my face getting red hot as comments and snickers echo through the room. \u201cThat\u2019s fine,\u201d I say weakly.</p> <p>Mrs. Peterson puts the phone back to her ear and says, \u201cDara, six o\u2019clock will be just perfect. Okay. Yes, I will definitely let her know. You have a fabulous day, too. B\u2019bye.\u201d</p><p>She turns off the phone, then walks over to her desk and places it inside one of the drawers. Peterson lets out an exaggerated, hefty sigh. \u201cI guess since it\u2019s the first day of school I\u2019ll be nice and give you an option. Either I get to keep your phone, or you can serve detention after school today.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s her being nice? What\u2019s it like when she\u2019s being mean? I\u2019ve spent three years at this school without managing to get even one blue detention slip. \u201cI seriously thought it was turned off,\u201d I say, hoping she\u2019ll show some compassion.</p><p>She points to her deadpan expression. \u201cDoes it look like I care? Zero tolerance. You should have turned it off before you came to class. Or, better yet, left it in your locker. Or at home. It\u2019s school policy to keep your phones completely turned off during class, Ms. Cruz. Not on vibrate and not switched to silent. You\u2019re a senior. You\u2019ve had three years to memorize the Fairfield High School manual.\u201d</p><p>Memorize the manual? From her serious tone, I do think she expects us to memorize the school manual. \u201cI\u2019ll take a detention,\u201d I say as the bell rings.</p><p>While everyone else files out of class, I wait for Mrs. Peterson to fill out the detention slip. She hands it to me, along with my phone.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t let it happen again,\u201d she says. \u201cOr you and I are not going to get along.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t mention that I\u2019m not feeling particularly optimistic about us ever getting along.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s tough love,\u201d she calls after me as I walk out of her classroom.</p><p>I\u2019d call it something else, but I don\u2019t make it a habit to piss off teachers, so I keep my mouth shut and head for my locker. Kendall is standing in front of it, waiting for me. She grabs my detention out of my hand and stares at the offending words written in Mrs. Peterson\u2019s handwriting. \u201cI seriously can\u2019t believe that woman gave you a detention on the first day of school. Peterson is brutal. Want me to wait for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah, but thanks.\u201d My brother is walking toward us, reminding me that we\u2019re supposed to walk home together. \u201cI got a detention, so I can\u2019t walk with you,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>\u201cYou got a detention on the first day of school?\u201d he asks, completely shocked. \u201cI didn\u2019t think that was possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is when you\u2019ve got Mrs. Peterson for a teacher,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give you a ride home,\u201d Kendall tells Ben. \u201cBut you can\u2019t talk about dragon slaying as if it\u2019s a real sport.\u201d</p><p>Ben agrees, although I\u2019m sure he\u2019s bummed that he can\u2019t talk dragon slaying with her. I feel sorry for my brother, who doesn\u2019t have many friends who share his love of gaming. He\u2019s very popular online, but the people he plays with are anonymous ... they\u2019re not real friends.</p><p>After they leave, I resign myself to the fact that I can\u2019t stall the inevitable. I head to the cafeteria, which doubles as the detention room after school. I\u2019m pretty certain I\u2019ll be the only one in there.</p><p>But as I enter the cafeteria and am handed a sign-in sheet by Mr. Harris, a gym teacher, I see I\u2019m not alone.</p><p>Justin Dougan, wearing his letterman\u2019s jacket even though it\u2019s too hot outside for anything heavier than a T-shirt, is sitting in back with his head resting on top of the table. Either he\u2019s sleeping or pretending not to care that he\u2019s stuck in this room expected to do nothing but be silent and do homework for an hour.</p><p>There\u2019s one other person in detention with me\u2014Luis Fuentes.</p><p>I sit on the empty lunch table behind him, wondering the entire time how he managed to get himself in trouble. I glance back at Justin, and it doesn\u2019t seem so impossible anymore. Justin isn\u2019t exactly known for being the nicest kid in school. He must have provoked Luis. And Luis must have fought back.</p><p>Fights aren\u2019t allowed at Fairfield High without consequences. Neither are cell phone calls during class.</p><p>I sit for a half hour, attempting to study because some teachers don\u2019t think the first day of school is meant to be a blow-off day. I force myself to look down at my math book, but I can\u2019t focus and I\u2019m totally lost. It\u2019s because Luis is here. I\u2019m so aware of his presence in the room that it\u2019s distracting.</p><p>\u201cHey, Nikki,\u201d Luis whispers.</p><p>I look up and realize that Mr. Harris has walked out of the room. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Luis slides off the cafeteria bench and straddles the one right across from me. \u201cWe didn\u2019t really have a chance to talk in Peterson\u2019s class. Remember me from a couple of years ago?\u201d he asks.</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cNope,\u201d I lie.</p><p>He puts his hand on his chest. \u201cLuis Fuentes. I met you at my brother\u2019s weddin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>As if I\u2019d ever forget. I wish I didn\u2019t remember Luis Fuentes and his arrogant, annoying smile. Or the fact that he went skinny-dipping with a girl he met after flirting with me.</p><p>He\u2019s looking at me with his head tilted to the side, assessing my response.</p><p>I look away. Then look back at him. He\u2019s got one brow arched questioningly. It\u2019s no use, because he\u2019ll know the truth sooner or later. I can\u2019t keep up the charade any longer.</p><p>I shrug. \u201cOkay, I remember you. Happy now?\u201d</p><p>He casually props a foot up on the bench, and I can imagine him being a model at a photo shoot doing that pose. \u201cAre you still bitter \u2019cause we never got it on that night? You didn\u2019t have to steal my clothes to get a peek at the goods, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did not steal your clothes. I just hid them. And I don\u2019t remember seeing your ...\u201d I gesture to the general area of his crotch. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t memorable, obviously.\u201d</p><p>But it was. I\u2019ve replayed that image of him, in all his glory, not looking one bit insecure or ashamed of his nakedness, many times. I hate myself for remembering him and everything he\u2019d said to me that night in detail.</p><p>The beginning of a smirk tugs at his lips, because he knows. He knows I remember that moment just as clearly as he does.</p><p>Luis leaps back to his original seat as Mr. Harris walks back in the room.</p><p>\u201cBy the way,\u201d Luis whispers to me, \u201cyou got numbers three and seven wrong.\u201d</p><p>I look down at my math homework. \u201cHow would you know?\u201d</p><p>He taps his head with his forefinger. \u201cI\u2019m kind of a math whiz. In both questions you forgot that the left-hand side requires the chain rule since y represents a function of x.\u201d</p><p>I look down at my paper. After a minute of retracing my steps, I find out that he\u2019s right. I look up at him in shock, but his back is turned to me again and Mr. Harris is scanning the room to make sure we\u2019re quiet.</p><p>After an hour, Mr. Harris announces that we\u2019ve completed our detention requirements and are free to leave. Justin is the first to go. He glares at Luis as he passes him. Luis must either pretend not to notice or he doesn\u2019t care.</p><p>I walk out of the room. Luis walks next to me. \u201cLooks like you need a math tutor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t hang out with south siders,\u201d I tell him, not stopping as I push open the front door to the school and walk out into the scorching summer heat. \u201cOr date them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t date south siders?\u201d he asks, chuckling.</p><p>\u201cNot anymore I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to hang out with you or date you, Nikki.\u201d He flashes me a killer smile he\u2019s probably practiced in front of a mirror until it was perfect. \u201cI suppose I wouldn\u2019t mind messin\u2019 around with you, though. Whenever you\u2019re up for it, let me know.\u201d</p><p>13</p><p>Luis</p><p>The best thing about surviving the first week of school is that you appreciate weekends and being able to sleep in. That is, except when your little nephew trots in the room while you\u2019re sleeping and mistakes your head for a drum.</p><p>\u201cHey, muchacho!\u201d I say, picking him up and having him sit on my chest. \u201cIf your diaper leaks, you\u2019re outta here.\u201d</p><p>He flashes me a four-toothed smile.</p><p>Now that Paco is almost two years old, it\u2019s time he learns how to pronounce my name. \u201cSay Luis,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>\u201cWeese,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cNot quite, but we\u2019ll work on it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWeese,\u201d he says again, getting excited now. He\u2019s bouncing up and down on me, like I\u2019m his horse. \u201cWeese, Weese, Weese!\u201d</p><p>Brittany peeks her head in the open doorway. \u201cPaco, are you bothering T\u00edo Luis?\u201d she asks.</p><p>\u201cNah,\u201d I tell her. \u201cHe\u2019s cool.\u201d</p><p>After entertaining him for a bit, I take my nephew into the living room, where Alex and Brittany are talking to mi'am\u00e1. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHey, bro,\u201d Alex says, then gestures to my boxers, which have the word Colorado written all over them in random colors.

Feel sorry for me?\u201d</p><p>Brittany and my brother smile at each other.</p><p>\u201cDefinitely. She\u2019s brutal,\u201d Alex says. \u201cBrit, didn\u2019t she give us detentions like every other day?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve tried to block those days out.\u201d Brittany cringes. \u201cI really hated you back then, Alex.\u201d</p><p>He slides the back of his hand slowly across her arm. \u201cCome on, chica. You wanted me, but you were afraid to admit it.\u201d</p><p>Brittany bites her bottom lip as she looks into my brother\u2019s eyes. He cups her cheek in his hand and pulls her close, then kisses her.</p><p>I slide my nephew off my shoulders and shield his eyes. \u201cSeriously, guys, aren\u2019t you past the honeymoon stage by now? You\u2019re on your second kid already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to get past this stage,\u201d my brother says.</p> <p>\u201cMe neither,\u201d Brittany coos.</p><p>Mi'am\u00e1 wags her finger in my direction. \u201cDon\u2019t you get any ideas, Luis. Keep your head on straight and don\u2019t lose sight of your goal.\u201d She holds out her arms for me to hand Paco over to her, then she takes him in the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cI almost didn\u2019t recognize the place,\u201d Alex says, eyeing the furniture and hardwood floors.</p><p>\u201cThis place looks amazing,\u201d Brittany agrees. \u201cThe neighborhood has completely changed, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me about it,\u201d I say. \u201cWe\u2019ve even got a cop livin\u2019 next door.\u201d</p><p>Alex shakes his head in confusion. \u201cA cop?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah. He also happens to be our landlord.\u201d I leave out the part that I think the guy was making a move on Mam\u00e1.</p><p>Alex sits up, really interested now. \u201cYour landlord is a cop?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s realized that this side of town is dirt poor. I\u2019ve got the feelin\u2019 he wants the south side of Fairfield to be the next Wrigleyville.\u201d Wrigleyville is the upscale yuppie neighborhood where Wrigley Field, home of the Chicago Cubs baseball team, is located. Wrigleyville is nothing like Fairfield, even if Officer Reyes wants to think it is.</p><p>\u201cLa polic\u00eda livin\u2019 in south Fairfield,\u201d Alex murmurs, almost to himself. \u201cGlad he wasn\u2019t here when I was in high school. I definitely didn\u2019t play by the rules like you do, Luis.\u201d</p><p>What he doesn\u2019t know won\u2019t hurt him. I wonder what rules I\u2019ll be tempted to break tonight with Marco, Mariana, and their friends after I get off work.</p><p>\u201cWant to go to Brookfield Zoo with us after breakfast?\u201d Brittany asks. \u201cPaco goes crazy walking through the bat house.\u201d</p><p>I laugh. \u201cWhile I\u2019d love to stroll around the zoo with you guys, I\u2019ve got homework. Then I work from three to ten tonight.\u201d</p><p>My brother raises an eyebrow. \u201cYou got the job at Brickstone?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re lookin\u2019 at the club\u2019s newest busboy, Alex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA busboy?\u201d My sister-in-law shakes her head. \u201cI don\u2019t think you should do it. You\u2019re ridiculously smart and athletic, Luis. They should have put you as a lifeguard, or at the front desk or something. Don\u2019t settle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s money,\u201d I tell her, shrugging.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s degrading,\u201d she shoots back.</p><p>I shrug again. Brittany was brought up rich and white and has no clue what it\u2019s like to be poor. Or Mexican. I know we need the money, and the place pays decent. So what if I\u2019ll be pouring water and handling people\u2019s dirty dishes. It\u2019s not a big deal. Mexicans are notorious for doing jobs white people don\u2019t want to do. I\u2019m cool with it. And I know I\u2019ll do a good enough job to get that promotion to server in a month.</p><p>Alex and Brittany leave with Paco after breakfast. I get a few texts from Marco asking me to hang out with him and a bunch of other guys before I go to work, but it\u2019ll have to wait till later. I\u2019ve got to keep my grades up. If I don\u2019t, I can kiss the aeronautics program good-bye.</p><p>After studying for next week\u2019s math assessment and US history quiz, I walk to work. It\u2019s still nice out, but I know it won\u2019t last long. Spring in Illinois is just a tease before the scorching summer. Then fall hits with a vengeance. But what really brings you to your knees is the frigid winter cold with winds that\u2019ll slap you in the face and make you wish you lived where they don\u2019t even know what snow is. Chicago snow is totally different from Boulder snow.</p><p>Fran Remington meets me by the front desk and has me work with a guy named Richard, a middle-aged dude with feathered hair that doesn\u2019t move across his scalp. It\u2019s either hairsprayed to death or a hairpiece.</p><p>In the employee locker room, I\u2019m handed my uniform\u2014white pants and a crisp white shirt with the word Brickstone embroidered in a small crest on the chest. Richard gets to wear black pants and a white shirt complete with a black jacket and tie. He looks like he\u2019s going to a wedding. I, on the other hand, resemble a guy who sells ice cream from a vending cart.</p><p>I spend the night shadowing Richard. Guests pile into the dining room as the night goes on. I help Richard serve the food, I clear dishes, refill glasses, and pretty much float through the night without a problem.</p><p>Until Nikki Cruz walks in with a group of friends. They\u2019re all white except for her, which shouldn\u2019t annoy the shit out of me, but it does. It\u2019s no wonder she disses her Mexican side ... she doesn\u2019t associate with anyone who\u2019s Mexican. I don\u2019t recognize any of them, but one of the guys in the group is wearing a black golf shirt with the words Chicago Academy Golf Team embroidered in gold letters.</p><p>Everyone knows that Chicago Academy is the exclusive private high school that kids with a lot of money go to. They\u2019re known for being complete snobs who drive high-priced, gas-guzzling cars. I bet none of these pendejos could tell the difference between a carburetor and an alternator.</p><p>Nikki\u2019s got on a low-cut pink sundress that shows off her curves. Damn, she looks hot. I\u2019m not the only one who notices, because the Chicago Academy dudes walking in behind her are not subtle about checking out her ass.</p><p>Richard taps me on the shoulder. \u201cYou almost spilled water on Mrs. Steinberg,\u201d he says in a not-too-thrilled tone.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d I murmur. Shit. Seeing Nikki here is distracting me.</p><p>I watch as the hostess leads Nikki and her friends to a table in a secluded corner by the window. Just my luck it\u2019s in Richard\u2019s station.</p><p>\u201cPour them water,\u201d Richard says, gesturing to Nikki\u2019s table. I hear her quiet laughter from across the room over something one of the girls says to her.</p><p>I go over to the table with a pitcher of ice water. I\u2019m in charge of water\u2014all types of water. The assistant waiter is in charge of all other drinks.</p><p>\u201cWould you like tap, sparkling, or bottled water?\u201d I ask them.</p><p>Nikki looks up at me, wide-eyed. \u201cLuis, what are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI work here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know him?\u201d one of the Chicago Academy guys asks Nikki. The guy eyes me, obviously sizing me up, then says to her, \u201cIs he your cousin?\u201d</p><p>Because we\u2019re both Mexican he thinks we must be related? Idiot.</p><p>\u201cNo. We, umm ...\u201d Nikki stumbles on the words.</p><p>\u201cWe go to school together,\u201d I say, finishing her sentence.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s cute,\u201d the guy says. \u201cMy dad went to Fairfield before they merged Fairfield South and North together. He said it\u2019s trash now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re such an elitist,\u201d Nikki says, more amused at his comment than annoyed. \u201cFairfield is diverse, unlike that white-bread school you go to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re as much of an elitist as I am, sweetheart,\u201d the guy says.</p><p>Derek and his girlfriend, Kendall, walk in and join the group. Derek reaches out his hand, and we shake. \u201cWhat\u2019s up, man? You didn\u2019t tell me you worked here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy brother knew some\u2014\u201d</p><p>The elitist guy taps me on the elbow. \u201cGet us some sparkling water,\u201d he orders, interrupting me.</p><p>Derek scowls. \u201cYo, Hunter. Don\u2019t they teach you at that fancy school of yours not to cut someone off when they\u2019re talking?\u201d</p><p>The snob rolls his eyes. \u201cI just played eighteen holes, Derek. I\u2019m thirsty. Sue me for asking the kid for something to drink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s cool,\u201d I tell the snob, but I\u2019m thinking, Kid? A dude my age, named Hunter no less, just called me kid. Unbelievable.</p><p>When I come back from the kitchen with the sparkling water and a small bowl of limes in hand, I pour the guy water.</p><p>I pour Nikki water, too. I wish I didn\u2019t get a whiff of her sweet perfume as I leaned down next to her.</p><p>After finishing all of their drink orders, I busy myself with the rest of the customers. I don\u2019t linger around Nikki\u2019s table, and only go back to clear dishes or give refills. There\u2019s something about Nikki that makes me want to know what it would be like if we got together. It\u2019s her feisty spirit, and the fact that nothing I\u2019ve done has made her loosen up. She\u2019s a challenge that I definitely want to take on.</p><p>I hate the fact that there\u2019s a part of me that\u2019s embarrassed being a busboy in front of Derek, Nikki, and Kendall.</p><p>When Nikki\u2019s table gets up to leave, Hunter holds out a fifty-dollar bill. \u201cHere you go,\u201d he says, making a show of handing it to me like I\u2019m a charity case. \u201cDon\u2019t spend it all in one place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, man,\u201d I say, even though I\u2019d like to shove the money back in his face. Or up his ass\u2014where it looks like he stashes the rest of his cash.</p><p>\u201cHey, Nik,\u201d I call out as she\u2019s about to walk out of the room.</p><p>She stops and looks back at me.</p><p>I know the rest of the guys are watching, so I step close to her and whisper in her ear, \u201cDitch these guys when I get off work and hang with me, mi chava.\u201d</p><p>She pulls me close and whispers in my ear, \u201cDream on,\u201d then struts out of the room while the guys look dumbly at her, then back at me.</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t flirt with her,\u201d Derek says to me before following the rest of their friends out of the dining room.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause Nikki has claws. Big ones, and they\u2019ll come out when you least expect it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t scare me,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>He pats me on the shoulder. \u201cShe should.\u201d</p><p>Twenty minutes later, I recognize Nikki\u2019s parents as they walk into the dining room and are also seated in Richard\u2019s section.</p><p>\u201cLuis, you look familiar,\u201d Dr. Cruz says as he looks at my name tag.</p><p>\u201cMy brother is Alex Fuentes. I met you and your family at his weddin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, yes. That\u2019s why you look familiar. It\u2019s been a long time.\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Cruz smiles in a reserved, almost rehearsed way. \u201cAlex told us you were moving back to Chicago. If you need anything, be sure to call us.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I nod, not sure if she really means it or if she\u2019s just saying it to be polite. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>Being in the presence of Dr. and Mrs. Cruz makes me forget that I\u2019m supposed to be serving other tables. Until I get a nudge from Richard, reminding me that I have a job and I better do it well or risk being fired.</p><p>I stand up straight and get back to business. \u201cWould you like sparkling, bottled, or tap water?\u201d</p><p>14</p> <p>Nikki</p><p>The guys from Chicago Academy are all the same. They\u2019ve got big egos and think they\u2019re studs. After dinner, my friends and I hang out by the Brickstone volleyball courts. My brother disappeared before dinner to go to the game room because he found out someone beat his high score on a simulated motorcycle game. My parents are at some lecture in the Brickstone auditorium.</p><p>Hunter McBride is sitting next to me, along with a bunch of guys and girls from Chicago Academy. They live in my neighborhood so I\u2019ve known them forever, but ever since junior high they\u2019ve gone to private schools while the rest of us went to public schools. My mom wanted me to go to CA, but since all my friends were going to public schools I chose to stay with them.</p><p>I look over at Kendall and Derek sitting on the other side of the court deep in discussion. I don\u2019t know which one of them looks more miserable. Ever since they had the whole \u201cwhere are we going to college\u201d discussion, they haven\u2019t been getting along. I think they finally realize that their relationship won\u2019t last forever.</p><p>Hunter nudges me and says, \u201cNikki, truth or dare?\u201d</p> <p>I throw my head back. \u201cNot this stupid game again. The last time we played truth or dare, I ended up having to eat three burgers and threw up afterward.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll let you start, then.\u201d</p><p>All eyes are on me. I sigh, wondering how I get myself into these situations. I need Kendall to get me out of this, but she\u2019s caught up in her own problems with Derek right now.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Nikki,\u201d a guy named Mason says. \u201cIt\u2019s your turn to get Hunter back for the burger-eating incident.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ll play, but only because I get the upper hand to start with. \u201cOkay ... Hunter, truth or dare?\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t hesitate. \u201cDare.\u201d</p> <p>Now I\u2019ve got to think of something that I know he won\u2019t do. That\u2019ll teach him to start playing this stupid game with me. \u201cI dare you to jump in the pool with your clothes on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I didn\u2019t think he\u2019d agree to it, mainly because I think he probably only owns clothes that need to be specially dry-cleaned and hand pressed.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he says, \u201cbut you have to come with me as a witness.\u201d</p><p>Fair enough. The rest of the group waits for us at the volleyball courts as Hunter and I walk across the grass to the outdoor pool.</p><p>\u201cAre you really gonna jump in?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d He wiggles his eyebrows. \u201cI\u2019d do anything you tell me to do.\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes. Hunter can\u2019t stand the fact that I won\u2019t just go out with him because of who he is. He\u2019s told me it\u2019s his life goal to make me say yes to a date, so he\u2019s made asking me out a game. Most girls are dying to know what it\u2019s like to be with Hunter McBride, son of the biggest real estate mogul in Chicago. He goes out with girls once or twice, then gets sick of them. He knows we\u2019ll never get together for real, but that doesn\u2019t stop him from trying.</p> <p>I shouldn\u2019t play along, but I do. Hunter is a harmless rich guy who needs friends like me in his life to bring him down to earth. It\u2019s not easy ... years of being spoiled and getting everything he wants is rotting his brain. Kendall thinks he\u2019s hopeless, but I think of him like one of the dogs at the shelter I volunteer at\u2014he just needs some training.</p><p>We open the gate to the outdoor pool at Brickstone, which is officially closed to guests because it\u2019s past ten o\u2019clock.</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s the deal with you and that busboy guy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, right. He was looking at you the entire time. I saw you checking him out more than a few times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was not. You\u2019re changing the subject,\u201d I say because I can feel my face getting hot just talking about Luis. \u201cYou better hurry and jump in before security comes.\u201d</p><p>Hunter sits on a lounge chair and pulls off his shoes.</p><p>\u201cI said with your clothes on, Hunter.\u201d</p><p>He laughs. \u201cThese are my custom Edward Green shoes, sweetheart. I\u2019m not about to get them wet.\u201d</p><p>I take one of his precious shoes, stand at the edge of the pool, and pretend to toss it in the water.</p><p>His eyes go wide. \u201cYou better not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if I did?\u201d I ask, tossing the shoe back to him. He needs to know material things shouldn\u2019t mean so much.</p><p>He puts both shoes neatly under the chair. It makes me wonder if the clothes in his closet are neatly folded and color-coded.</p><p>\u201cIf you tossed my shoe in, I\u2019d do this!\u201d he says, then surprises me by picking me up and jumping into the pool with me securely captured in his arms.</p><p>I come up sputtering. \u201cI\u2019m gonna kill you!\u201d I swim toward the edge of the pool, completely drenched and contemplating how I\u2019m going to explain this one to my parents. I hoist myself out of the water and wring out my hair. \u201cI hate you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t. In fact, I think you like me a little.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s where you\u2019re wrong. You owe me a new pair of shoes,\u201d I tell him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem. When can I take you shopping?\u201d Hunter gets out of the pool. His shirt is sticking to his chest, his pants are sticking to his legs ... and he\u2019s looking right at my chest. I look down and realize that my dress is clinging to my skin.</p><p>\u201cNever. I\u2019ll e-mail you my size and a picture of them.\u201d</p><p>Hunter stares down at my heels. \u201cWhat designer are they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I got them at Target.\u201d</p><p>He laughs. \u201cDo you know how cute you are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot when I\u2019m wet and makeup is running down my face. I\u2019m sure I look horrible, thanks to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou look hot, Nik. Superhot.\u201d He steps closer. \u201cWe\u2019re both wet. You know what this means, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat I\u2019m done playing truth or dare?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It means that we\u2019ve got something in common. I might not have the Mexican thing goin\u2019 on, but we\u2019re both soaking wet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re grasping at straws, Hunter. Being wet does not mean we have something in common.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust shut up and roll with it. You know, I\u2019m always game if you want to fool around. You don\u2019t have a boyfriend, I don\u2019t have a girlfriend ...\u201d He leans in to kiss me, but I put my hand on his chest and stop him.</p><p>\u201cSeriously, don\u2019t make me laugh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, Nik.\u201d He looks down at my breasts. \u201cYour body is telling you something.\u201d</p><p>If he\u2019s referring to me being nippy, it\u2019s because a gust of wind just blew over me and I got a chill for a second. We\u2019re in the suburbs of Chicago\u2014no girl is immune to the Chicago wind.</p><p>\u201cThe pool is closed for guests,\u201d a guy says from the gate. A bunch of employees are standing behind him, ready to jump in the pool for employee \u201cafter-hours\u201d swim time. Luis is there, too, talking to the hostess from the dining room.</p><p>\u201cThe pool is closed?\u201d Hunter asks as if he wasn\u2019t aware of it. Hunter winks at me to play along. He\u2019s good at playing dumb, I\u2019ll give him that.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to come back tomorrow,\u201d a security guy says. \u201cIt\u2019s only open to staff after ten.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d Hunter grabs his shoes, then takes my hand in his and leads me out of the pool area.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Luis says as Hunter and I pass him.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d I say back dumbly.</p><p>I take my hand from Hunter\u2019s grasp. \u201cRemind me never to play truth or dare with you again.\u201d</p><p>Hunter laughs. \u201cAre you kidding? That was fun. I bet I could have paid that security guard off and we could have stayed. You\u2019ll have to come over to my house next time and go in our hot tub with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeep dreaming.\u201d</p><p>Over by the volleyball courts, I see my parents talking to my friends.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to you two?\u201d Dad asks us when he catches a glimpse of our drenched clothes. \u201cYou\u2019re both soaking wet.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not about to admit I was playing truth or dare. It\u2019s better to play the stupid teenager role. \u201cHunter thought it would be funny if we went swimming with our clothes on,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>Hunter opens his mouth wide in mock shock and points to me accusingly. \u201cShe made me do it.\u201d</p><p>Mom shakes her head. \u201cI think the party\u2019s over, Nikki. Time to go home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m coming with you,\u201d Kendall says, joining us. She leaves Derek sulking by himself.</p><p>As we walk to the car, I look over at the pool area where the employees are still hanging out. Though it\u2019s not fully lit, I can see Luis on one of the lounge chairs still talking to the hostess.</p><p>\u201cWe ran into Luis Fuentes,\u201d Dad says when we start driving home. \u201cYou remember him, don\u2019t you, Nikki? He\u2019s Alex\u2019s brother. Very smart boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I say. \u201cHe\u2019s in my chemistry class.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suspect Luis has a wild streak now that he\u2019s moved back to the south side,\u201d Mom says in a warning tone. \u201cDon\u2019t get involved with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve hardly said two words to him,\u201d I say to my overprotective mother, but really feel like moaning in defeat.</p><p>It\u2019s been easy to reject advances from guys like Hunter because I don\u2019t feel a connection with them. When Luis and I are in the same room, I\u2019m so aware of him that I wonder how long I can keep the wall of protection up before he chisels through it. His swagger, his confidence, his advances ... they make me weak and I have to continually remind myself that a boy like Luis can make me lose control.</p><p>Staying strong has never been so hard.</p><p>15</p><p>Luis</p><p>On Monday morning, Nikki is waiting for me at my locker the second I get to school.</p><p>\u201cWhat are the chances that I can convince you to get another job?\u201d she asks me.</p><p>She says it as if I can find another job with a snap of my fingers. \u201cWhat\u2019s the problem, chica?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe problem is that I don\u2019t want my friends questioning how we know each other or guessing that we have some unfinished business between us ... because we don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you care about what other people think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just do,\u201d she says. \u201cEveryone knows I don\u2019t have a boyfriend or want a boyfriend.\u201d</p><p>I laugh. \u201cSo who was that guy you were with in the country club pool Saturday night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHunter is just a friend.\u201d She crosses her arms on her chest, doing a pretty good imitation of our chemistry teacher. All she needs to complete the image is a glare that can melt steel.</p><p>\u201cSo you go around bonkin\u2019 guys who aren\u2019t your boyfriend? Nice,\u201d I say. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t bonk.\u201d</p><p>Marco sticks his head between us. \u201cYes, Nikki, you do.

Don\u2019t be a pendejo.\u201d</p><p>In a flash she runs down the hall and disappears.</p><p>\u201cSince we broke up all she does is hang out with rich white dudes. Every once in a while she needs to be reminded what it was like to be with a Latino stud,\u201d Marco says.</p><p>I take my books out of my locker and head to class. \u201cYou should probably go home and sleep off whatever you\u2019re on, ese.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeed to stay in school,\u201d he answers. \u201cIf I\u2019m absent, they won\u2019t let me try out for the soccer team.\u201d</p> <p>Soccer tryouts are today and tomorrow after school. Soccer wasn\u2019t a popular sport at Flatiron High, but at Fairfield it\u2019s obviously big because everyone is talking about it. Even some of the girls talked about watching the tryouts.</p><p>I don\u2019t see Nikki until the end of the day, in chemistry. She\u2019s standing at the lab table across from me. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d I say.</p><p>She doesn\u2019t respond.</p><p>\u201cMarco didn\u2019t mean what he said this mornin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, he did. You guys are all alike. Leave me alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy does Nikki hate me so much?\u201d I ask Derek.</p> <p>He laughs. \u201cNikki hates every guy who reminds her of Marco. You\u2019re Mexican, he\u2019s Mexican ... and worse, you\u2019re friends. \u2019Nuff said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo she goes for guys like Hunter instead?\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head. \u201cDon\u2019t ask me. I\u2019m having enough troubles with my own relationship; the last thing I want to do is try to analyze someone else\u2019s.\u201d Derek and I start getting our lab station ready while we wait for Peterson\u2019s instructions. \u201cYou ever have a girlfriend?\u201d he asks me.</p><p>\u201cNot a serious one\u2014nothin\u2019 that lasted more than a couple of months.\u201d I dated a girl when I lived in Mexico, but her parents didn\u2019t like me. They said they didn\u2019t want their daughter running with some poor dude. I bet if her parents knew I was living back in the U.S. they\u2019d be pissed we broke up. Getting a one-way ticket to the States without sneaking across the border like a fugitive is like winning the lottery.</p><p>\u201cA bunch of us are gonna watch you at soccer tryouts,\u201d Mariana says to me as she leans across the lab table. \u201cI hear you\u2019ve got moves.\u201d</p><p>Nikki snorts.</p><p>\u201cTable one, I hear talking!\u201d Peterson yells from across the room. \u201cDo you four want a detention, because I have some detention slips in my desk collecting dust. You know how much I hate dust.\u201d</p><p>After the final bell rings, Derek and I head for the locker room. During tryouts, the social divide is blurred. The coach puts Marco and me on the same team and we dominate. The other side can\u2019t even score. Justin Dougan, who happens to be our goalie, pushes me from behind when I get close to our net to block a ball.</p> <p>\u201cWhat the fuck, Dougan. If you haven\u2019t noticed, we\u2019re on the same team.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOops,\u201d he says sarcastically, then holds out his hand so anyone watching would think he\u2019s about to help me up.</p><p>I whack his hand away. \u201cWere you born a prick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up, Fuentes. We might be on the same team, but we\u2019ll never be in the same league.\u201d</p><p>Derek stands beside me. \u201cDougan, get over yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s cool,\u201d I tell Derek, and ignore Dougan the rest of the time.</p><p>At the end of practice, all the guys walk to the hot dog place a block away from school. Derek has been preoccupied the entire walk over. He pulls out his cell phone and starts texting the minute we get our food and sit down.</p><p>\u201cYou been datin\u2019 Kendall a long time?\u201d I ask him.</p><p>\u201cSince this summer,\u201d he says. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t trust me. She thinks I\u2019m gonna cheat on her or find someone else if we go to different colleges.\u201d He grabs a fry. \u201cI love her, you know. I can\u2019t even see myself with anyone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes she know you\u2019re in it for the long haul?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit, Luis, I tell her all the time. Nikki\u2019s been putting negativity and doubts in her head ever since we started going out. Don\u2019t get me wrong ... I think Nikki\u2019s cool, but she thinks we\u2019re all out to screw as many girls as possible. I wish she had a boyfriend so she\u2019d loosen up.\u201d He nods in my direction. \u201cWould you date her?\u201d</p><p>I think of Nikki\u2019s feisty attitude mixed with her delicate vulnerability that intrigues me to no end. She\u2019s also crazy beautiful with a body that has inspired more than a few fantasies. I\u2019m afraid if I dated her, I wouldn\u2019t want to let her go. I\u2019d have to, though. I have a long-term plan, and it doesn\u2019t include being tied down to a girl.</p><p>\u201cSo, would you date her, or what?\u201d Derek asks again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d go out with her,\u201d I admit.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m supposed to have Kendall come on my boat next weekend. You should come with us ... I\u2019ll have her bring Nikki.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNikki won\u2019t go if she knows I\u2019m gonna be there,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>\u201cLeave that up to me.\u201d</p><p>A kid I don\u2019t know walks past us. \u201cHey, Ben!\u201d Derek says.</p><p>The kid gives a half wave as he heads to the game room off to the side.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Ben Cruz, Nikki\u2019s brother,\u201d Derek explains. \u201cHe\u2019s a freshman and is completely antisocial if you\u2019re not into gaming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGamin\u2019, huh?\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>I wander into the game room after I finish eating and most of the guys have left.</p><p>Ben is playing some alien shooting game when I walk up to him. He\u2019s in the zone and doesn\u2019t look up until the game is over.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re Nikki\u2019s brother, right?\u201d I ask before he slips another token in the slot.</p><p>He looks at me, then goes back to playing the game.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Luis Fuentes,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>He starts shooting aliens. \u201cI know who you are. You\u2019re Alex\u2019s brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you know?\u201d</p><p>He shrugs. \u201cPhotographic memory, I guess.\u201d</p><p>Gamers love when you speak their language. \u201cYou ever play World of Warcraft?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve got some sick graphics.\u201d I had played WoW, but the free trial period ended and there was no way I could afford the monthly fee. \u201cAwesome game,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>When he finds out I\u2019ve played WoW, his entire face lights up. \u201cI\u2019ve been playing for two years,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m designing my own adventure game with awesome graphics and levels just like Warcraft. Nobody really cares except gamers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bet it\u2019s cool.\u201d I definitely appreciate strategic computer games.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d show it to you ...\u201d He hesitates. \u201cBut you probably don\u2019t want to come to my house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m a geeky freshman and you\u2019re a senior who hangs with the tough kids and jocks. On top of that, I heard my sister telling her friends that you\u2019re a jerk.\u201d</p><p>Marco yells out, \u201cYo, Luis. We\u2019re goin\u2019 over to Juan\u2019s house to hang out. Come on, I\u2019ll give you a ride.\u201d</p><p>Ben stiffens as soon as Marco\u2019s voice bellows through the air. The poor kid is scared shitless of Marco. Is it because of Nikki? Or did Ben and Marco have a problem in the past?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna stay here,\u201d I tell Marco.</p><p>He laughs. \u201cAll right. But when you get bored playin\u2019 with the geeks, call me.\u201d</p><p>Ben pretends not to hear the insult. We talk about online games versus traditional arcade games. It doesn\u2019t take long before Ben insists I come to his house so he can show me the new game he\u2019s developing that would mix the two. The kid is more excited than I would be if I got a Camaro.</p><p>When I follow Ben up the driveway of his house, it\u2019s hard not to be impressed. Inside, each room is decorated in weird patterns and colors. They have a computer room decorated in a jungle theme complete with a stuffed tiger in the corner.</p><p>Ben has a superhigh-tech computer with a huge monitor that looks like a television screen. I bet the whole thing cost close to four Gs.</p><p>Ben explains how to play the game he\u2019s designing. I choose to be a dragon slayer and my mission is to battle the badass dragon who\u2019s guarding my princess. In the middle of my battle, the dragon freezes. Ben takes the controller from me.</p><p>\u201cI need to fix that bug,\u201d he says. I try and help him, although computer coding is not my strong suit.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d Nikki asks me when she walks into the computer room.</p><p>\u201cPlayin\u2019 video games with your brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a freshman,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cSo? Luis\u2019s a gamer,\u201d Ben tells her proudly. \u201cJust like me. Us gamers have to stick together.\u201d</p><p>Nikki sneers at me. \u201cLuis is not a gamer, Ben.\u201d She huffs in frustration and storms out of the room.</p><p>\u201cBe right back,\u201d I tell Ben, then I follow Nikki. She\u2019s heading for the stairs, but I grab her elbow and force her to look at me. \u201cWhat\u2019s your problem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t even given me a chance.\u201d</p><p>She laughs. \u201cI don\u2019t need to. You\u2019re too cocky for your own good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a cover-up for my extreme insecurity when it comes to you. Maybe if we kissed it would prove whether we have chemistry or not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust one kiss?\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what you\u2019re missin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>She closes the space between us and, before my brain has time to contemplate what\u2019s about to happen, Nikki grabs the back of my hair and pulls my head to hers so our lips are just barely touching.</p><p>Talk about an adrenaline rush.</p><p>\u201cDo you kiss with just lips?\u201d she whispers, then brushes her lips against mine. \u201cOr do you spice it up a bit?\u201d Her tongue darts between my lips in a slow, sensuous rhythm that sends images of us together in a more intimate setting rushing through my head.</p><p>I keep my hands at my sides, letting her control this. That means I\u2019m in control of myself, even if she\u2019s controlling the kiss. I know she\u2019s fucking with me, making me all hot and bothered just to dis me after.</p><p>I\u2019ve got this. In fact, I think she\u2019s the one losing control.</p><p>\u201cI definitely like to spice it up.\u201d I glide my tongue against hers. It\u2019s hot and wet and feels fucking incredible. A small moan escapes from her mouth that I swear sounds like, \u201cOh, Luis,\u201d and that\u2019s where I lose it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Nikki is an adrenaline rush just being herself. I pull back and cup her flushed cheek gently in my palm.</p><p>We just stare at each other. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she asks.</p><p>\u201cLookin\u2019 at you. We got major chemistry, don\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d She doesn\u2019t break eye contact, probably wanting me to look away first. When I don\u2019t, she steps away and a huge, cocky grin crosses her face. She tsks and shakes her head. \u201cSorry, Luis, but you need a little practice. Your tongue action was a bit awkward. I mean, it wasn\u2019t all bad. You have potential, but obviously we\u2019re not compatible.\u201d</p> <p>As I\u2019m standing there stunned, I\u2019m thinking that this girl is a witch and not an angel. She\u2019s definitely put a spell on me, and I\u2019m practically panting, ready to beg her for the chance to do it again\u2014now. That wasn\u2019t just fun, and my tongue action is anything but awkward. I\u2019ve had fun with other girls. Lots of \u2019em. Nobody has complained before.</p><p>When I looked into her eyes, and her eyes were locked on mine, there was something there. It was undeniable.</p><p>Nikki wipes her lips with the back of her hand. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare tell anyone we kissed.\u201d</p><p>Why, because I\u2019m a poor Mexican and after Marco the only guys who are worthy of her have fifty-dollar bills they wave around like pieces of scrap paper?</p><p>Ben walks in the room and asks, \u201cWhat were you guys doing?\u201d</p> <p>Nikki says \u201cNothing\u201d at the same time I say, \u201cYour sister and I were just makin\u2019 out.\u201d</p><p>16</p><p>Nikki</p><p>Sometimes things are better off forgotten. The fact that I kissed Luis is one of them. So it wasn\u2019t as bad as I made it out to be ... and in reality I can\u2019t stop thinking about doing it again. But he doesn\u2019t need to know that. All week during school I\u2019ve managed to avoid talking to him, which is great. Except it takes a lot of energy to avoid someone you can\u2019t help but notice.</p><p>Sunday mornings I volunteer at the animal shelter near my house. When I get there, the manager, Sue, tells me that a new dog named Granny came in this morning.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s blind,\u201d Sue tells me, and my heart breaks a little. \u201cBulldog. Probably around nine or ten years old. Her elderly owner died, and nobody in the family could take the dog.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019ve seen old dogs die in their cages at the shelter, because few people want to adopt a dog only to pay the higher medical costs older dogs usually have. On top of that, people don\u2019t want to adopt a dog that won\u2019t be around much longer.</p><p>\u201cWhere is she?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cCage thirty-three. You can walk her, then start cleaning out the west side cages.\u201d</p><p>I immediately go to cage thirty-three. Granny is lying down in the corner with her head on the ground.</p><p>\u201cHey, girl,\u201d I say as I unlock the cage.</p><p>She picks her head up when I pet her, and leans into my lap. I learn pretty quickly that Granny likes her tummy rubbed. I take her for a walk, leading her to the open grassy area in the back so she can sniff around.</p><p>I walk the other dogs, but the entire time I\u2019m thinking about Granny. I go back to her cage to give her tummy rubs five more times.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll come back tomorrow to check on Granny,\u201d I tell Sue during my break.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re not on the schedule.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. But I noticed her bowl was full. I hand-fed her. If she doesn\u2019t eat tomorrow, I\u2019ll help her.\u201d</p><p>Sue rolls her eyes. \u201cShe\u2019ll eat, Nikki. Healthy dogs don\u2019t starve themselves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDepressed ones do,\u201d I say back. \u201cAnd she\u2019s depressed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo bad we don\u2019t have the budget for a dog therapist, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got me, though,\u201d I tell her.</p><p>I spend the rest of the time handling the other dogs until I leave the shelter and head home for a shower.</p><p>When I pull into my driveway, Kendall is already waiting for me. She stares at the mud stains on my jeans. \u201cAre you full of doggie germs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>She holds her hands up. \u201cUgh. Don\u2019t touch me. I\u2019ll wait outside while you take a shower. Hurry!\u201d</p><p>We\u2019ve had plans for a while to go on Derek\u2019s boat in Fox Lake. It\u2019s not actually his boat, it\u2019s his parents\u2019.</p><p>Twenty minutes later I run out of the house all showered and ready to spend the rest of the day relaxing and tanning on the boat.</p><p>\u201cSo ...,\u201d Kendall says. \u201cWant to elaborate on what\u2019s going on between you and Luis since \u2018the kiss\u2019?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d called Kendall after our kiss and told her everything. \u201cNothing. You know I just made out with Luis to prove a point to myself ... and to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that point is ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat I can kiss a guy without getting emotionally involved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how did that work out for ya?\u201d</p><p>I look out the window. \u201cI\u2019m not as emotionally immune as I want to be. I\u2019m just glad we\u2019re going out on the boat so I can clear my head. I don\u2019t want to get involved with anyone, Kendall. Especially someone like ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike Marco?\u201d Kendall says, finishing my sentence.</p><p>\u201cYeah. I can\u2019t do that.\u201d</p><p>Kendall shrugs. \u201cWhat if Luis is different, Nik? What if he likes you, and you like him, and it\u2019s all good?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t work that way. You love Derek, and Derek loves you, but you guys still have problems.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going on the boat today, aren\u2019t I? I\u2019m trying to live in the moment instead of obsessing about our inevitable future.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s what you think I should do?\u201d</p><p>After the forty-minute drive, she pulls into the gravel driveway. \u201cI think you should be happy. You\u2019ve been punishing yourself for two years, Nikki.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to get hurt again.\u201d I smile and give her a hug. \u201cI love you for wanting me to be happy, though.\u201d</p><p>Kendall was there after I lost the baby. She listened to me cry hour after hour, day after day, night after night, until I had no more tears left. When I needed her to talk, to just say anything to get my mind off of what had happened, she came through for me. She talked about everything and nothing until her throat was sore. And when I didn\u2019t want to talk, we sat silent for hours. She bought me ice cream and Hallmark sympathy cards with encouraging words on them, and told me one day my heart would heal even if my body was scarred forever.</p><p>\u201cJust try to have fun, okay?\u201d We walk around Derek\u2019s lake house and head for his private pier.</p><p>\u201cHey, girls!\u201d Derek yells from the boat. \u201cYou\u2019re late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNikki had to wash dog germs off her,\u201d Kendall tells him. For the first time in a week, Kendall wraps her arms around Derek and gives him a kiss. I\u2019m glad things are better between them, even though I admit I have my doubts.</p><p>I\u2019m shocked to see Luis sitting on the bow wearing nothing but a pair of long swim shorts, revealing naturally tanned washboard abs and a thin line of hair, which extends from his navel and disappears beneath his swim shorts, which ride low on his hips.</p><p>Whoa. I hate that I\u2019m tempted to stare.</p><p>\u201cWho invited you?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cObviously not you,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cGive the guy a break,\u201d Derek chimes in as he sits in the captain\u2019s chair.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t think this is a date,\u201d I tell Luis quietly as he offers a hand to help me in the boat.</p><p>Luis furrows his brows. \u201cWho said anythin\u2019 about a date? I didn\u2019t say anythin\u2019 about a date. Yo, Derek, did you say anythin\u2019 about a date?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, you did. You said you wanted to ask Nikki out, but were too chickenshit to do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, this is turning out to be an interesting afternoon. Luis, nothing is going to happen between us. We kissed. It was awkward. It\u2019s over.\u201d</p><p>Luis smacks his lips together and winks. \u201cWhatever you say, mi chava.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop calling me that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh,\u201d he says dismissively.</p><p>Derek starts the boat and soon we\u2019re flying over the water. Derek and Kendall are by the wheel, and Luis and I are up front. I sit across from Luis instead of next to him, mainly because I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll grab on to him for dear life when we jump the waves. I love boating, but I like going slow. Unfortunately Derek doesn\u2019t have that same philosophy. I hold on to the side rail and pray we don\u2019t capsize.</p><p>I glance at Luis. He\u2019s looking down, fascinated, as he watches the water crash against the side of the boat. He\u2019s definitely enjoying the ride.</p><p>When we ride over the bumpy wake of another boat, I close my eyes and grip the rail tighter.</p><p>\u201cAre you afraid?\u201d Luis says over the roar of the engine. He\u2019s suddenly at my side. I can feel the heat of his body next to mine, and I\u2019m tempted to reach for him to hold me. I open my eyes and look around as the scenery whizzes by.</p><p>I don\u2019t need a guy to make me feel secure. I can do it on my own. I grab the rail tighter. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lyin\u2019. If you hold on to the rail any tighter you\u2019ll cut off the circulation in your fingers.\u201d He slides his body closer. \u201cI want to hold you, Nikki. Will you let me?\u201d</p><p>17</p><p>Luis</p><p>I don\u2019t know what it is with this girl. She\u2019s vulnerable and strong-willed at the same time. She makes me want to protect her, and at the same time peel back the layers of that wall she puts up.</p><p>\u201cLet me hold you,\u201d I say again.</p><p>She shakes her head. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>I lean away from her. She\u2019s shutting me out.</p><p>\u201cIs it because of Hunter, or some other dude?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s because I don\u2019t want to get serious with any guy.\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cSo let\u2019s not be serious. Let\u2019s just have fun with each other and see where it goes. I won\u2019t pressure you or give you attitude. Just the real me.\u201d</p><p>I know she\u2019s thinking about it. At least she didn\u2019t shut me down right away.</p><p>\u201cThat was a rush, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d Derek yells after he anchors the boat. He tosses a raft in the water, then does a backflip off the side.</p><p>Kendall jumps in next. \u201cCome on, you guys!\u201d she yells from the water.</p><p>Nikki strips off her shorts and tank top, revealing a red bikini with black trim. I watch as she stands on the edge of the boat with the tips of her toes hanging over the side. I\u2019m mesmerized, but trying not to show it.</p><p>\u201cSo ... Luis?\u201d She looks back at me without her usual animosity. I notice the playful challenge laced in her voice. \u201cYou said we should have fun. Are you brave enough to take the plunge?\u201d</p><p>18</p><p>Nikki</p><p>I only asked if he\u2019d take the plunge in a moment of pure weakness.</p><p>I don\u2019t have long to analyze his physique when he stands over the side, extends his muscular arms over his head, and dives in the water like an Olympic swimmer. I peer over the side of the boat, waiting for him to emerge from the water. When he doesn\u2019t, I start freaking out.</p><p>\u201cWhere is he?\u201d I ask in a panic.</p><p>\u201cYou lookin\u2019 for me?\u201d he asks. His voice echoes from the opposite side of the boat. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Instinctively, my hand flies to my chest. \u201cDon\u2019t do that again, Luis. You scared me half to death. I thought you\u2019d drowned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cConsidering he\u2019s an all-state champion swimmer,\u201d Derek says as he swims by Kendall, \u201cI don\u2019t think you have to worry about that.\u201d</p><p>I arch an eyebrow. Luis, an all-state champion swimmer? I jump into the water, feet first. It\u2019s not graceful, but I\u2019m not an all-state champion swimmer\u2014far from it.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s see how fast you are, Fuentes. How about a race?\u201d Derek points to his left. \u201cTo the buoy over there and back. Girls get a head start.\u201d</p> <p>Kendall and I immediately start racing toward the buoy. The boys wait, but not for long. It\u2019s not a fair race, because Luis and Derek pass us in less than five seconds. Derek is on the swim team at Fairfield and can definitely hold his own. Luis passes him easily, though, way before they reach the buoy.</p><p>Derek and Luis both stop at the buoy and wait for me and Kendall to catch up.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the holdup?\u201d Derek calls out.</p><p>Kendall attempts to splash Derek, but he\u2019s too far away. \u201cYou guys are such show-offs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the testosterone,\u201d Luis says, treading water with seemingly no effort.</p> <p>I swim harder, but too quickly I\u2019m out of breath and need a second to rest.</p><p>\u201cYou girls have no stamina,\u201d Derek says.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll show you stamina,\u201d Kendall calls out, doing a pretty good breast stroke back to the boat. Derek follows close behind her, while Luis swims over to me. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>Water drips off his lips, chin, and hair. He looks younger right now, kinda like he did when I first met him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m done racing, if that\u2019s what you mean,\u201d I tell him. I float on my back to give my body a rest.</p><p>Luis floats next to me, but grabs Derek\u2019s abandoned raft that has floated near us and we both hang on to it. We stay silent for a while, riding the wakes of other boats skimming across the water while we stare up at the sky.</p> <p>He points to one of the clouds. \u201cLooks like a dog, doesn\u2019t it? See the ears and long tail?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLooks like a snake to me. It can\u2019t be a dog because it doesn\u2019t have legs.\u201d</p><p>He laughs. \u201cNobody\u2019s perfect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, they\u2019re not. I learned that the hard way,\u201d I blurt out, then point to another cloud so he doesn\u2019t analyze my comment. \u201cThat one\u2019s shaped like a rainbow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s a turtle,\u201d he says. \u201cSee its head pokin\u2019 out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wrong. That\u2019s not a head. It\u2019s the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow,\u201d I counter in an Irish accent, reaching up to the sky and tracing the rainbow and the pot of gold with the tip of my finger.</p><p>\u201cYou sure?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely. I\u2019m an expert on cloud formations.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDid you ever think what the earth would look like from space?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ve never wondered about it. \u201cI\u2019ve seen pictures and video. Looks like a big marble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean experience it, like be up there lookin\u2019 down on earth. Would you go if you had the chance?\u201d He lets go of the raft and puts his arms behind his head, floating on his back and looking up at the sky. \u201cMan, I\u2019d do anythin\u2019 to go up there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could die on the way up ... or down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care. It\u2019s worth the risk for the ultimate adventure. Bein\u2019 so close to the moon and stars ... knowin\u2019 the universe is endless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re daydreaming, Luis. Come back to earth.\u201d I splash him.</p><p>He cocks his head to the side and says boldly, \u201cJust so you know, I retaliate.\u201d</p><p>I splash him again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m warnin\u2019 you ...\u201d</p><p>When I splash him the third time and say \u201cBring it,\u201d he ducks under the water. I kick my feet, wondering what he\u2019ll do. \u201cLuis, if you scare me or pull me under I\u2019ll kill you. I swear it. I was kidding when I said \u2018bring it.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>I keep kicking. There\u2019s no sign of Luis, not even a ripple in the water indicating he\u2019s near me. The suspense is driving me nuts. I wait, still kicking. I know he\u2019s around here somewhere, unless he really is a fish and is breathing underwater in some magical underworld. He\u2019ll come up ... but when?</p><p>He bursts out of the water right beside me, making a big splash with his entire body. I let out a very geeky yelp, which makes him laugh.</p><p>He swipes the water off his face with his hand. \u201cYou\u2019re not as brave as you think you are, mi chava.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m brave when guys aren\u2019t creeping up on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t creep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStalk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t do that, either. When I like a girl, I\u2019m not subtle. In third grade I put a love letter in Selena Ibarra\u2019s desk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened? Did she read it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. She laughed. And then she showed it to everyone on the playground. I got made fun of until my brother Carlos threatened to kick anyone\u2019s ass who gave me shit. Nobody really bothered me after that. Carlos is intimidating when he wants to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think he\u2019ll kick my ass if I give you shit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s in the military, stationed overseas. I think you\u2019re safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d I say. \u201cThen he won\u2019t mind if I do this.\u201d When I reach out to dunk him, he goes down easily. When he comes back up, we\u2019re face-to-face.</p><p>My breathing gets harder and faster. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because I\u2019ve been in the lake for too long, or because he reminds me so much of Marco. Suddenly I can\u2019t see clearly and my head spins.</p><p>\u201cWhoa,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m suddenly light-headed.\u201d I reach out and frantically grab his arm for support.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d he asks, concern in his voice. His free arm reaches around my waist and holds me in a firm, protective grip ... like a hero. Our legs touch under the water and it feels intimate even though it\u2019s not.</p><p>I quickly take my hand off his arm. \u201cSorry. I just ... got dizzy for a second. I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>I thought Marco was my hero, but he wasn\u2019t. Heroes are just made-up characters in fairy tales. They don\u2019t exist. At least in my universe, they don\u2019t. Luis is close to being one today, though.</p><p>He leads me back to the boat, staying by my side the entire time and asking periodically if I\u2019m okay. Before we climb back up, he taps my arm. \u201cNik?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust so you know, I\u2019m havin\u2019 a good time.\u201d</p><p>I nod and give him a small smile. \u201cMe, too. It\u2019s a good thing we established this wasn\u2019t a date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should warn you that I plan on spendin\u2019 the rest of the day changin\u2019 your mind,\u201d he says with a big grin on his face.</p><p>19</p><p>Luis</p><p>After soccer practice on Monday, Marco and I hang out at his house. He rolls his eyes when I insist on doing my homework before we go off and party with some of the other guys.</p><p>After I\u2019m done with my homework, Marco and I get in his black SUV with tinted windows and ride around town.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been hangin\u2019 out with Nikki,\u201d I tell him when we turn down Green Bay Road.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got a problem with that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat I got a problem with is you hangin\u2019 with Derek and Ben\u2014guys from the north. You belong with us, Luis. You\u2019re one of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not dissin\u2019 you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust know where your loyalties lie. \u00bfComprendes, compa?\u201d</p><p>\u201cS\u00ed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBien. Now let\u2019s go party at the beach, where the real Latinas are.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t tell him that Nikki is a real Latina, and I can\u2019t get her out of my head. After our non-date on Derek\u2019s boat, she said she needed space. I\u2019m giving it to her, but I can\u2019t deny I want to be with her.</p><p>Marco drives toward Lake Michigan. He doesn\u2019t park near the public beach. Instead, he takes a right and heads for the secluded part of the beach where the Blood used to hang out.</p><p>\u201cWhy here?\u201d I ask. The Blood aren\u2019t active in Fairfield anymore, so I figure this part of the beach is deserted.</p><p>But it\u2019s not.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t hear the news?\u201d Marco asks.</p><p>\u201cWhat news?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChuy Soto got out of the DOC on Friday.\u201d</p><p>I freeze. Chuy is one dangerous motherfucker. I don\u2019t suppose being locked up has reformed him. If he\u2019s back, does that mean the LB is about to get stronger?</p><p>I\u2019ve seen gang deaths, beatings, and bullshit. But I\u2019ve also seen the honor and loyalty the guys in gangs have to their friends.</p><p>The beach is filled with guys from my \u2019hood; my people. Guys I haven\u2019t seen since I moved back have come out of the woodwork for this welcome home party for Chuy.</p><p>We play football on the beach for a while. Afterward, Marco grabs a can of beer from a cooler. He gulps the alcohol until the liquid is running down the sides of his mouth. When he\u2019s finished, he swipes his mouth with the back of his hand, tosses the empty can on the ground, and slaps his knees together as if he just made a touchdown.</p><p>Marco tosses me a can. \u201cYour turn.\u201d</p><p>I open the can and chug it in hopes the alcohol will erase the image of a soaking wet Nikki in a bikini from my mind. Unfortunately, it doesn\u2019t. I reach in the cooler and take another can. I take big gulps, waiting for the buzz. I\u2019ve haven\u2019t gotten shit-faced drunk often, but then again, it isn\u2019t often a girl invades my mind.</p><p>\u201cLuis, come here!\u201d Marco yells, waving me over.</p><p>I head over to where Marco and his boys are talking. \u201c \u2019Sup?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Chuy Soto.\u201d He nods in the direction of the newest person to walk down the beach.</p><p>The guy is as big as a bear, has tattoos completely covering his arms and neck, and walks with an intimidating don\u2019t-fuck-with-me-or-you\u2019re-dead swagger. To top off the look, a cigar hangs out of the side of his mouth.</p><p>Everyone is silent. Chuy stops when he reaches me. If I hadn\u2019t grown up with gang members my entire life, I\u2019d probably be shittin\u2019 in my pants right about now.</p><p>\u201cI heard a Fuentes had graced Fairfield with his presence,\u201d Chuy says as he holds out his hand for me to shake.</p><p>\u201cI brought him,\u201d Marco says, proudly taking credit.</p><p>I shake Chuy\u2019s hand with a strong, sure grip. Guys like Chuy respect anyone who doesn\u2019t shiver in their boots when approached.</p><p>\u201cCaballeros, let me talk to Fuentes alone,\u201d Chuy says.</p><p>It doesn\u2019t take more than that for Marco and the other guys to disperse. Marco joins the rest of the ganga who are surrounding a big pile of wood and sticks they\u2019re about to light up.</p><p>\u201cI asked Marco to bring you here tonight,\u201d he says.</p><p>That doesn\u2019t make sense. From what I heard, Chuy thought of my brother as a traitor ever since he got jumped out of the Blood. Why the sudden change of heart for a Fuentes brother? If Chuy considers Alex an enemy, why am I safe from his wrath? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Unless he expects me to replace Alex in the gang.</p><p>\u201cI thought you were in jail,\u201d I say.</p><p>He smiles, with the cigar still hanging out of the side of his mouth. \u201cLet\u2019s just say I got out on a technicality.\u201d He leans forward and talks in a low voice. \u201cListen, I need to rebuild the Latino Blood, and you\u2019re gonna help me do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy me? I\u2019m not connected.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s where you\u2019re wrong, Luis. You were born a Blood.\u201d He pats me on the back. \u201cAnd you\u2019ll be an LB until the day you die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I were an animal, I\u2019d most likely be ...\u201d by Luis Fuentes</p><p>Normally I like writing essays. Last year I wrote a paper in English about why certain aspects of Mexican culture had been integrated so completely into American society. I got an A, of course. Mr. Heilmann somehow got it printed in the local newspaper, which was pretty cool.</p><p>But now I\u2019m stumped, which rarely happens. I bet most guys in my class\u2019ll choose a lion, the king of the jungle. I\u2019m not the king, and never have been.</p><p>Thinking of a king reminds me of Chuy Soto.</p> <p>My pen is poised over my paper. I wonder if I was drunk last night or if Chuy really did say he expects me to help him rebuild the Latino Blood. I gaze at a picture of Alex, Brittany, and Paco on the wall.</p><p>Mi'am\u00e1 has the day off. I realize she\u2019s not cooking like I thought. She\u2019s got a cigarette perched between her fingers as she stands over the sink.</p><p>\u201cI hate when you smoke,\u201d I tell her.</p><p>\u201cIt relaxes me.\u201d She takes a drag of the cigarette and taps the ash in the sink. \u201cI got offered a job yesterday, as a receptionist. It\u2019s at the hospital where Elena works.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s cool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s decent money, and includes health benefits,\u201d she says, then lifts the cigarette to her lips again.</p> <p>\u201cYou okay, Ma? You look like you\u2019re freakin\u2019 out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEstoy bien.\u201d She blows out smoke. \u201cWell, everything\u2019s not fine. I got a call today that Carlos was injured.\u201d</p><p>I start to panic as horrific images of soldiers who\u2019ve come back in wheelchairs and lost limbs swirl in my head. \u201cWhat happened? Give it to me straight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing serious, but bad enough that he\u2019s coming home to recuperate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean it\u2019s nothin\u2019 serious?\u201d I ask. \u201cIf he\u2019s comin\u2019 home, it\u2019s got to be bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s his leg. He had to have surgery and couldn\u2019t join the rest of his unit, so they\u2019re forcing him to take a medical leave. He also has to decide it he wants to reenlist. I want him home, but ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou heard that Chuy Soto got out of jail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cElena just found out from Jorge.\u201d She points the cigarette at the doorway. \u201cYou just make sure you stay away from him. I don\u2019t want you or Carlos getting messed up with him, or the LB.\u201d</p> <p>Too late for that. I rub the knot forming in the back of my neck. How do I say this? I hesitate and my palms get sweaty. \u201cMa, did I get \u2018blessed in\u2019 the LB?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere did you hear that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChuy Soto said somethin\u2019 to me about bein\u2019 born a Blood and, well, I didn\u2019t know what he meant.\u201d</p><p>She points to me, her finger shaking. \u201cYou don\u2019t listen to Chuy, Luis. You hear me? Just stay away from him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s runnin\u2019 things again. He wants to rebuild the LB.\u201d</p><p>I know I have a crazy, dangerous streak\u2014an urge to charge into danger. For the most part I\u2019ve controlled it, but when I met Chuy last night ... I kinda got an adrenaline rush at the prospect of facing him head on\u2014to make him pay for his part in Alex\u2019s jumping out, which almost cost him his life.</p><p>Mi'am\u00e1 takes another drag of her cigarette. \u201cJust keep your distance and don\u2019t ask questions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t I have the right to know why the new head of the Blood thinks I\u2019m one of them?\u201d I ask her.</p><p>She cups my cheek in her hand. \u201cNo, Luis. No questions. We\u2019re always better off not asking questions. You\u2019re safe. We\u2019re all safe as long as you stay away from Chuy.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t tell her that I don\u2019t want to stay away, because I want to find out what Chuy has planned. The more power he has, the less power the rest of us in Fairfield have. If Chuy has control, he can order revenge on Alex. If my family is in danger, I need to know.</p><p>Getting close to Chuy is my only option.</p><p>20</p><p>Nikki</p><p>Derek always has a party on his birthday because his parents are always out of town at a yearly sales conference at the same time. It\u2019s something everyone at Fairfield looks forward to. I was really excited to come to Derek\u2019s party tonight. I haven\u2019t opened up physically or emotionally with Luis since we went on Derek\u2019s boat two weeks ago, but I\u2019ve thought about it every day.</p><p>Kendall and I arrived at the party early to decorate the house. Derek took his older brother\u2019s ID and bought a few kegs. Normally I don\u2019t drink, but Luis texted me and said he was definitely coming here tonight.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Derek asks as I fill a plastic cup to the rim with beer and start to gulp it down.</p><p>\u201cLosing my inhibitions,\u201d I tell him. \u201cWhat does it look like I\u2019m doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t drink, Nikki.\u201d</p><p>I raise my cup in the air. \u201cI do now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKendall!\u201d Derek yells, obviously not knowing how to deal with me. \u201cCome here!\u201d</p><p>Kendall peeks into the kitchen. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>Derek gestures to me. \u201cYour best friend is having a solo pre-party.\u201d</p><p>Kendall laughs as I take another gulp. \u201cUmm ... not a good idea, Nik.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it is. Luis is coming here tonight.\u201d I\u2019m starting to feel less stressed about being with him the more I drink.</p><p>Kendall and Derek give each other knowing looks.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not what you think,\u201d I tell them. \u201cI just want to know what it would be like to pretend we\u2019re a couple.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretend? Just admit that you like him,\u201d Kendall says. \u201cAnd deal with those feelings. Getting drunk is like a bandage that won\u2019t stick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you, I don\u2019t have feelings for him.\u201d I laugh at the thought.</p><p>Kendall pats Derek on the chest. \u201cDerek, do something ... say something.\u201d</p><p>Derek holds up his hands. \u201cI\u2019m not touching this conversation with a ten-foot pole.\u201d He quickly leaves as the doorbell rings.</p><p>I\u2019ve almost downed the entire cup, and pour myself more. \u201cDo you know Luis was the first guy I kissed since Marco?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Kendall says.</p><p>\u201cI think about it a lot. More than a lot, actually. Luis is the perfect one to practice on, right?\u201d</p><p>Kendall takes the cup out of my hand. \u201cI don\u2019t think you should use a guy for practice. You\u2019ll hurt him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I won\u2019t,\u201d I assure her. \u201cHe\u2019s admitted he\u2019s a player, just like Marco. He\u2019s the one who said we should just have fun. I\u2019ll make sure he knows whatever happens between us is just casual.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGirls like Mariana do casual hookups, not you,\u201d Kendall says. When I grab another cup and fill it to the rim, she drops the subject. \u201cDon\u2019t say I didn\u2019t warn you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine. You tell me I need to loosen up. Luis tells me the same thing ... I\u2019m gonna give it a try.\u201d</p><p>An hour later music is blaring and the place is crowded. I\u2019m definitely buzzed, and want to find Luis. I down the rest of whatever\u2019s in my cup, toss it in the garbage, and push through the crowd to find him. He\u2019s nowhere in sight. I ask around, but nobody\u2019s seen him.</p><p>\u201cHey, Nikki,\u201d Justin Dougan says, smiling wide with teeth that are so white I bet a blind person could see them. \u201cYou look hot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUmm ... I kinda had plans with ...\u201d I\u2019m about to say Luis, but we don\u2019t really have plans. I have plans. I just assume Luis will go along with them. And hanging out with Justin Dougan is definitely not in my plans.</p><p>\u201cGo upstairs with me,\u201d he says, taking my elbow and urging me away from the throng of partiers.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going upstairs with you, Justin.\u201d He\u2019s not the one in my fantasies.</p><p>\u201cTrust me,\u201d Justin says. \u201cI won\u2019t try anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t trust any guy who says \u2018trust me.\u2019 I ... need some air.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. Then walk outside with me.\u201d</p><p>Before I can protest, Justin leads me outside to the pool deck. The entire time I\u2019m craning my neck to see if I can catch a glimpse of Luis, with no luck. He said he\u2019d be here, but maybe he changed his mind.</p><p>Justin is drunk, too. I can tell by the way he stumbles across the deck before sitting on one of the lounge chairs. \u201cSit next to me,\u201d he says, then grabs my wrist and urges me down. \u201cYou look like a hot tamale.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not really a compliment,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>He leans toward me. I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s falling on me or trying to feel me up. Either way, he smells like beer and sweat. It\u2019s not a good mix. I push him off me.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d I hear Luis say as he steps into view.</p><p>He looks good in jeans that hang off his hips just the slightest bit and a T-shirt that looks so worn it\u2019s probably as soft as silk.</p><p>Justin glances up at him. \u201cGo away, Mex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNikki is also Mexican, you dumbass,\u201d Luis says.</p><p>Justin stiffens. \u201cWho you calling a dumbass?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNobody! He didn\u2019t mean it,\u201d I say. \u201cRight, Luis?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really,\u201d Luis says. \u201cI meant it.\u201d</p><p>Justin is about to get up and challenge Luis when Derek grabs Justin\u2019s arm and steers him away from Luis. \u201cDougan, I need your help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith what?\u201d Justin asks.</p><p>\u201cJust ... something.\u201d Derek leads him into the house, leaving me alone with Luis.</p><p>Luis is looking at me as if I\u2019ve betrayed him. \u201cWhat were you doin\u2019 sittin\u2019 with that pendejo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t actually sit with him ... Okay, I did but ...\u201d I sigh. Tonight is not going as I planned. I\u2019m buzzed, and I don\u2019t know how to explain that I\u2019ve been waiting for him this entire time. I can show him, though. \u201cFollow me.\u201d</p><p>He hesitates.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d I say, taking his hand and leading him toward the pool house. I know the key is hidden in the planter. I take it out and open the door with one thing on my mind: to let go of my inhibitions and kiss Luis like I did in my house. This time, we won\u2019t be interrupted. Luis attempts to turn on the light switch, but I put my hand over his.</p><p>\u201cLock the door,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>He does.</p><p>I walk farther into the room. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to be with Justin tonight. You\u2019re right, he is a pendejo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t like seeing you with him,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019d like seein\u2019 you with any other guy ... besides me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Right now I have a desperate need to be held by him. This isn\u2019t going to define me. This is about having fun and living out the fantasy.</p><p>\u201cHold me,\u201d I say. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re drunk,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cJust a little buzzed, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNikki,\u201d he whispers as he gets closer. As soon as I feel his body heat I reach out and slowly run my hand down his arm.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t talk,\u201d I whisper. If he talks, he might say something to ruin the moment. To be honest, I\u2019m afraid of what he\u2019ll say.</p><p>Being here, in the dark, makes this surreal. It\u2019s like a mixture of fantasy and reality all meshed in one. I\u2019m totally okay with living in Fantasy Land right now, because that\u2019s what I need. If this felt too real, I wouldn\u2019t be able to go through with it.</p><p>I brush my lips across his face to his ear. \u201cHold me, like you wanted to on the boat.\u201d</p><p>The second he wraps his arms around me, a sweet calmness washes over my entire body. It reminds me of when he held me protectively when we were in Fox Lake. I\u2019m not deluding myself into thinking this incredible feeling will last forever, but I revel in his embrace. I\u2019m living in the moment, and it feels so amazingly good I never want it to end.</p> <p>His arms are caressing my back slowly, the warmth of his strong fingers searing my skin through my silky top.</p><p>I\u2019ve pushed him away for so long, but tonight the pressure is off. With renewed determination, I reach up and touch my fingertips to his face.</p><p>He pulls back. \u201cYou sure about this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefinitely,\u201d I say. \u201cYou\u2019re my fantasy tonight. Is that okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFantasy, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. As in the opposite of reality.\u201d I laugh, giddy just being here with him. I\u2019m excited to put my plan into motion. \u201cJust for tonight, let\u2019s see what happens.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>Tomorrow? \u201cI haven\u2019t thought that far ahead. I just want to make out with you right now. You game?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat depends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn what?\u201d I ask.</p><p>He leans forward and kisses the sensitive spot right under my ear, then whispers, \u201cIf you want to stop at kissing, or go further.\u201d</p><p>When he brushes his lips slowly down my neck, I throw my head back and hope he continues to go slow. I\u2019m not used to slow.</p><p>\u201cThat feels so good.\u201d I moan as he lets his lips rest on the spot where he can feel my pulse. He kisses the spot lightly. \u201cKeep doing that.\u201d</p><p>He kisses it again. And again. And again. \u201cYour pulse is racin\u2019,\u201d he whispers against my skin.</p> <p>\u201cNo shit,\u201d I say, which makes him laugh.</p><p>I put my hand on his chest. Through his shirt, I can feel his heart beating hard and fast against my palm. \u201cYours is, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm,\u201d he says before I feel the softness of his warm, wet tongue replace his lips on my pulse.</p><p>Whoa. I suddenly get dizzy and grab his shoulders for support. His strong arms lock around me immediately and hold me steady, as if he\u2019s more than willing to be my hero tonight.</p><p>I need a hero.</p><p>It\u2019s romantic. The shades are closed and we have total privacy from the chaos outside. A few slashes of dim light between the slats break through the darkness of the room. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the alcohol I drank that\u2019s making me want him so much, but I\u2019ve never felt this way\u2014not even with Marco.</p><p>I wish this could last forever.</p><p>When his lips sear a path down my neck and he gently pushes the straps of my shirt away to kiss the top of my shoulder, I can\u2019t take it anymore.</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t kiss me I\u2019m going to die.\u201d I pant. \u201cForget going slow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you said my tongue action needed work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI lied. Want to try again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah,\u201d he says. \u201cReal bad.\u201d</p><p>He hesitates for a split second, but then I feel his palm cup my cheek while his thumb moves back and forth like a soft caress across my lips. I close my eyes and kiss his thumb.</p><p>\u201cDoes this feel good?\u201d he asks, replacing his thumb with a touch of his lips.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I whisper back. My hands weave into his hair.</p><p>I must be more than buzzed, because all I can think about when his lips brush against mine is that I wish we could stay like this forever.</p><p>A flick of his tongue against my lips makes my breath hitch.</p><p>\u201cLet me taste you, mi mu\u00f1eca.\u201d He moans.</p><p>I clear my head from all thoughts and inhibitions as my tongue reaches out for his. He\u2019s a breath away, waiting for me. When our tongues collide, it\u2019s hot and wet and slippery and slow ... it feels dirty and sexy and beautiful all at once.</p><p>I melt into him as he holds me close. Our mouths are open and tasting each other. I feel like my insides are molten lava as he cups his hands over my butt and urges me closer. I feel him against me, and his obvious bodily reaction to our kiss makes my body ache for his touch.</p><p>We\u2019re both breathing heavily now. The place has no air-conditioning, and I\u2019m starting to sweat. In one motion, I break our kiss and pull my shirt over my head. I\u2019m standing here in my shorts and my bra.</p><p>I take his hand and place it over my bra. His breath catches, and the hot air around us seems electrified.</p><p>His fingers skim the silky satin of my bra and the sensitive skin between my breasts. His hands are skilled and slow. He\u2019s teasing me, and I\u2019m breathing harder in anticipation of him pulling the material aside.</p><p>Waiting is complete torture.</p><p>I can\u2019t wait anymore. I reach around and unhook my bra, then let it fall to the floor. I wish I could see his face right now.</p><p>\u201cYour turn,\u201d I say playfully, then tug on the bottom of his shirt. \u201cI want to feel your skin against mine.\u201d</p><p>He hesitates again.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d I tell him. \u201cDon\u2019t overthink this. We\u2019re having fun. Isn\u2019t that what you want?\u201d</p><p>Without further hesitation he rips off his shirt and immediately pulls me against him. My breasts crush against his hard, lean body.</p><p>While he caresses my bare back and his hands move down to cup my butt again, I wrap my arms around his neck and my legs around his body. His hands hold me suspended in midair until he carries me to the nearest wall. He presses against my body, holding me against the wall while we grind against each other. His hardness presses against my softness, and I wish we were naked but at the same time I\u2019m glad we\u2019re not, because right now I\u2019m not in control. I\u2019ve lost it, and I have the feeling he has, too.</p><p>\u201cTell me to stop.\u201d He groans against my lips.</p><p>I don\u2019t. I can\u2019t. Instead, I wrap my legs around him tighter, urging him to keep moving. He does.</p><p>I bite down hard on his bottom lip when things get too intense, too emotional. My hands are on his hot chest and I can\u2019t hold back anymore.</p><p>I wrap my arms around him tighter and whimper against his neck. My entire world explodes around me, and the feeling won\u2019t stop. Then I feel him grab me tighter while he comes apart in my arms. It\u2019s just ... wow.</p><p>\u201cThat was amazing,\u201d I say weakly after I come down from the high and catch my breath. \u201cTo be honest, I was nervous all week. But ... this was a great fantasy, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>He tenderly touches my hair, then gently runs his fingers through it. \u201cIt was more than that, mi chava.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYo, Luis!\u201d Marco\u2019s voice calls from the outside of the pool house. Knock, knock, knock. \u201cLuis, you in there?\u201d</p><p>21</p><p>Luis</p><p>Nikki quickly covers her nakedness with her hands and whispers in a frantic voice, \u201cIt\u2019s Marco. What\u2019s he doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d My body is still coming off the high and I can\u2019t think straight. I\u2019ve hardly had time to recover, and I know there\u2019s a good chance the evidence of what we just did is probably gonna be visible. Not good.</p><p>Knock. Knock. Knock.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get rid of him.\u201d I pick up her clothes and hand them to her.</p><p>I watch as Nikki clutches the bra and shirt to her chest. \u201cThanks,\u201d she whispers.</p><p>She rushes past me, but I take her hand and gently urge her to face me. \u201cAre we cool?\u201d I know it\u2019s a stupid thing to say, but no other words come. I want to tell her more, a lot more, but I can\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cYeah, we\u2019re cool. Just ... go.\u201d</p><p>She locks herself in the small bathroom while I make sure my shirt covers any evidence of our encounter.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck took you so long?\u201d Marco asks.</p><p>Shit. Think of something fast. \u201cTakin\u2019 a piss. What\u2019re you doin\u2019 here? I thought you didn\u2019t party with north siders.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI might not party with \u2019em, but I\u2019ve got business with \u2019em.\u201d</p><p>By business he means drugs. \u201cYou\u2019re loco.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd proud of it.\u201d</p><p>He peers over my shoulder and scans the pool house, but the lights are off so he can\u2019t see anything. I close the door and head out, hoping to guide Marco far away from Nikki. It\u2019s obvious she doesn\u2019t want him knowing what happened between us. Hell, she might want to deny we fooled around. Or maybe she was so buzzed she won\u2019t even remember it in the morning.</p><p>Marco and I walk into the main house. \u201cThis place is lame. Let\u2019s bounce,\u201d he says, pushing through the crowd of people who are eyeing us suspiciously.</p><p>\u201cWho invited the wetbacks?\u201d Justin Dougan calls out as we leave. He\u2019s on the front lawn with a bunch of the guys on the football team, and they\u2019re not sober. They\u2019re all laughing and giving Dougan high fives for insulting us.</p><p>Marco and I both halt, give each other knowing looks, and in unison turn to face Dougan and his crew.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell did you just call us?\u201d Marco asks, ready for a fight.</p><p>\u201cYou heard me,\u201d Dougan says. \u201cWe only allow immigrants to clean our houses or mow our lawns.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Marco says. \u201c \u2019Cause when I screwed your sister in her bedroom two weeks ago she didn\u2019t say anythin\u2019 about that. In fact, I know firsthand that she loves eatin\u2019 big, fat burritos.\u201d</p><p>Oh, man. Dougan\u2019s nostrils flare, and his group advances toward us. \u201cYou\u2019re dead, Delgado.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you really screw his sister?\u201d I mumble out of the side of my mouth so only Marco can hear.</p><p>He grins mischievously and nods.</p><p>\u201cGo back to Mexico where you animals belong,\u201d Dougan says, then spits at us like we\u2019re the animals he accuses us of being.</p><p>Without hesitation, Marco charges him. I\u2019ve got his back, though, when two of Dougan\u2019s friends pull him off and start pummeling Marco with their fists. It doesn\u2019t take long for my own fists to start flying.</p><p>And it doesn\u2019t take long for a crowd to gather.</p><p>I don\u2019t get into fights often, but when I do the beast in me unleashes with a vengeance. Maybe Dougan is right and I am an animal. The instinct to fight is in my Fuentes blood. Two guys are holding me down while a third is kicking my stomach. It doesn\u2019t even hurt ... with each blow the rage rising to the surface makes me stronger. I break out of their grasp and bring two of them down before I scramble to get up and pull a guy off of Marco. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I fight one guy to the ground, punching until he stops fighting back. Then Dougan and I get into it. He throws a punch that hits me square in the jaw. I retaliate with a punch of my own that brings him down.</p><p>I don\u2019t even notice the flashing blue lights of a cop car until two cops pin me to the ground. One puts his knee on my back and starts to handcuff me. I look over and see another two cops handcuff Marco.</p><p>\u201cGet up, Luis,\u201d one of the officers orders.</p><p>Huh? I know that voice. I turn to look at the officer. Holy crap. It\u2019s none other than Officer Reyes, my next-door neighbor and the guy who\u2019s been flirting with mi'am\u00e1.</p> <p>\u201cShit,\u201d I groan. \u201cNot you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know this kid?\u201d another cop asks Reyes.</p><p>\u201cYeah. And I know his ma ain\u2019t gonna be happy he got in a fight.\u201d Reyes looks on the ground right next to me. Two packets wrapped in blue cellophane are lying in the grass. \u201cWhat are those?\u201d he asks me. \u201cThose come out of your pockets when you were fighting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He picks up the packets.</p> <p>\u201cLooks like blow to me,\u201d one of the cops holding Marco says. \u201cYou two been dealing tonight?\u201d he asks us.</p><p>Marco shakes his head. \u201cNo, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCesar, I swear they\u2019re not mine,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>I glance up at the crowd and see Nikki, standing with her hand over her mouth in shock. When our eyes meet, she turns away in disgust. She doesn\u2019t believe me.</p><p>From the look on Reyes\u2019s face, he doesn\u2019t believe me, either.</p><p>He lets out a slow breath and shakes his head in frustration. \u201cAll right. You two, over by the squad cars. Now!\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019m told to spread my legs so Reyes can pat me down.</p><p>\u201cGot any weapons, drugs, or needles on you, Luis?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cYou high or drunk?\u201d he asks, his hands patting up and down my legs.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why were you fighting?\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cJust felt like it, I guess.\u201d I\u2019m sure he doesn\u2019t give a shit if the pendejo called us wetbacks and thinks Mexicans should be second-class citizens.</p><p>\u201cThink hard, because I\u2019m the one who\u2019s gonna have to call your mother to explain why I have you in custody and suspect you were dealing some pretty serious shit. I\u2019d rather give her a reason why you thought it was a good idea to come all the way to the north side of town to cause trouble.\u201d</p> <p>What, does Reyes think that poor Mexicans are only allowed on the north side to mow lawns and clean houses, too? \u201cI didn\u2019t come here to cause trouble,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>\u201cReally? Why are you here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was invited,\u201d Derek\u2019s voice calls out. \u201cBy me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd who the hell are you?\u201d Reyes asks.</p><p>\u201cI live here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me see some ID.\u201d Derek pulls out his ID and Reyes examines it.</p><p>Reyes gives a short laugh. \u201cHappy birthday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen, I\u2019m sure you\u2019re aware that the legal drinking age in Illinois is twenty-one. You\u2019re eighteen.\u201d Reyes tsks and shakes his head. \u201cWhere are your parents?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVegas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you thought you\u2019d host yourself a birthday bash while they were gone?\u201d</p><p>Derek nods. \u201cSeemed like a good idea at the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh. Get everyone out of your house, lock it up, and come to the station with us so we can call your parents,\u201d Reyes says.</p><p>Derek is one cool gringo to come out here and vouch for me. \u201cDon\u2019t take him in, Reyes,\u201d I say. \u201cGive the guy a break. It\u2019s his birthday.\u201d</p><p>Reyes shakes his head. \u201cBirthdays aren\u2019t a license to break the law, Luis.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m led to the back of one of the squad cars, while Marco and Derek are led to the other. Two officers drive them away while Reyes walks over to Dougan and his buddies. He talks to them for a while, taking notes the entire time. After a while Reyes and his partner walk back to the squad car I\u2019m in.</p><p>Reyes gets in the driver\u2019s seat and turns to me. \u201cYou really screwed up tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me \u2019bout it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen, Luis. I care about your mother. You being involved in fighting and drug dealing is gonna hurt her real bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI already told you the coca wasn\u2019t mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas it your buddy\u2019s stash?\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s the deal. I\u2019m gonna let you and your friends off tonight after calling their parents, because I didn\u2019t find the drugs on your person and a few witnesses said that you and Marco were harassed before the fight. But I\u2019ll be watching you like a fucking hawk from now on. If I find out you\u2019re dealing or getting into more fights, I\u2019ll be on your ass so fast your head will spin.\u201d</p><p>Shit, this guy is worming his way into mi'am\u00e1\u2019s life, and now he\u2019s going all parental on me. I\u2019ve lived without a father my entire life, and have done just fine.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not my father,\u201d I remind him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. If I were, I\u2019d lock you in juvie for the night to teach you a lesson.\u201d</p><p>22</p><p>Nikki</p><p>I let my guard down, which was not in the plan. Tonight, when Luis and I were in the pool house, I allowed myself to believe Luis and Marco are completely different.</p><p>That was before I saw him fight.</p><p>Luis and Marco were on the same side, fighting Justin and some guys from the football team. Luis\u2019s fists were flying, and the worst part about it was that I think he liked it\u2014as if the fight fed some need in him.</p><p>I don\u2019t know who started the fight. It doesn\u2019t matter, really. Luis didn\u2019t walk away. Instead, he was the last man standing, ready to take anyone on that would dare challenge him. He didn\u2019t stop until the cops physically restrained him.</p><p>And then I saw the drugs on the ground right by his feet.</p><p>I can\u2019t be with someone who fights and deals drugs. Marco used to fight so much he\u2019d get suspended. Principal Aguirre says he has a zero tolerance policy, but quickly realized when our class entered Fairfield freshman year that if he gave everyone three strikes and then expelled them, there\u2019d hardly be any students from the south side left. Aguirre still threatens to expel students, but rarely follows through.</p><p>I need to force myself to stop thinking about Luis. As I fall into bed after I get home, I can\u2019t help but hate myself for feeling so vulnerable tonight. I let go of my inhibitions and knew what I was doing. But Luis didn\u2019t tell me he was dealing drugs\u2014that\u2019s a game changer.</p><p>Sunday morning comes and I wake up hoping Granny has started eating on her own.</p><p>\u201cHow is Granny doing?\u201d I ask Sue.</p><p>\u201cShe won\u2019t eat much. She\u2019s definitely depressed.\u201d</p><p>I go to her cage and sit with her.</p><p>Granny sniffs the air as soon as I open her cage. \u201cHey, girl,\u201d I say as I reach out and lead her to my lap. \u201cDid you miss me?\u201d</p><p>Her answer is a wag of her tail. She looks thin. Too thin.</p><p>I pet her behind the ears and she rolls onto her back. When she seems content, I pick up the food in her bowl and hand-feed her. She eats from my hand when I put the food to her nose.</p><p>\u201cWant me to take you home?\u201d</p><p>She answers by nuzzling her nose into my leg.</p><p>\u201cI just have to convince my parents to let me take you,\u201d I tell her.</p><p>When I\u2019m home and I tell my parents about Granny, they both say I can\u2019t have her.</p><p>\u201cYou have too much going on,\u201d Mom says.</p><p>\u201cAnd when you\u2019re off to college, then what?\u201d Dad says.</p><p>\u201cBut she\u2019s old, and blind, and living in a cage! If you were old and blind, would you want to spend your last days in a cage?\u201d I argue.</p><p>Mom pats my hand. \u201cNikki, we think it\u2019s admirable for you to want to help the dog, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>I sigh. \u201cJust ... can you meet her? Meet her first, then make a decision, okay? I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll be a great pet, and I know when you take one look at her you\u2019ll have the same opinion that I do about her.\u201d</p><p>They both look at me as if I\u2019m pathetic. I know what they\u2019re thinking, that I\u2019m trying to take care of a needy animal because I need to be wanted. We\u2019ve covered this ground before. Maybe they\u2019re right. I can\u2019t help but have a special bond with the less fortunate dogs who come into the shelter\u2014the ones who seem helpless. I root for the underdog, every time.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what,\u201d Dad says. \u201cNext weekend, if Granny is still there, your mother and I will go meet her.\u201d</p><p>A big grin crosses my face. \u201cThat\u2019s awesome! Thanks so much!\u201d I hug both of them.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re making no promises, Nikki.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, I know.\u201d Well, I do know. Once they see Granny they\u2019ll fall in love with her.</p><p>On Monday, the buzz about the fight at Derek\u2019s house, the arrests, and the drugs found by Luis\u2019s feet is running rampant. I can\u2019t walk down any hall without hearing something about Luis, Derek, or Marco.</p><p>I get some sideways glances, too. Everyone at school knows Marco and I dated, and some still associate us together.</p><p>I avoid eye contact with Luis even when he calls out my name, and during lunch I sit in the library and study for my calculus exam so there\u2019s no chance of meeting with him or Marco. I know I\u2019ll be seeing Luis in chemistry, though.</p><p>I time my arrival so I get to chemistry just as the bell rings.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t ignore me forever,\u201d Luis whispers behind me when Mrs. Peterson instructs us to go to the sink in the back of the room to clean out our test tubes.</p><p>\u201cYes, I can,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>\u201cWhat about Saturday night, in the pool house?\u201d</p><p>I freeze, remembering the moment I let go of all my inhibitions. That was a mistake, and the wall is up again. \u201cI\u2019m trying to forget it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can try, but it\u2019s not gonna work.\u201d He leans closer. \u201cI can\u2019t forget it either, you know.\u201d</p><p>His words stir something deep inside me, and I need to lash out at him to push him away. \u201cYou know what sucks, though? You starting a fight just minutes later with Justin Dougan and finding out that you were dealing drugs.\u201d</p><p>He steps back and weaves a hand through his hair. \u201cYeah, that was a bummer. You know what sucks even more, though?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat you\u2019re so desperate to believe everythin\u2019 bad you hear about me. You\u2019re obviously not a supporter of the \u2018innocent until proven guilty\u2019 concept.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Fuentes,\u201d Mrs. Peterson calls out. \u201cStop the chatter. Are you aware there are people in back of you who need to use the sink?\u201d</p><p>Luis looks right at our teacher and says, \u201cTo be honest, Mrs. P., I don\u2019t really give a shit.\u201d</p><p>23</p><p>Luis</p><p>I\u2019m done worrying about getting detentions\u2014staying after school for an hour is obviously going to be a common occurence so I might as well embrace it. In fact, the last time I had a detention I actually got some homework done. The problem is getting a detention from a teacher who insists that you serve the detention in her classroom instead of in the cafeteria with all the other delinquents. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I\u2019m sitting on my usual lab stool and I pull out homework. I\u2019m about to work on math problems when Peterson stands over me.</p><p>I look up at her. She\u2019s giving me the evil eye, which would make me laugh if I didn\u2019t think she\u2019d give me another detention if I did.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t Hi me. What\u2019s going on with you?\u201d She crosses her arms on her chest, and I can just sense the wrath of Nadine Peterson is about to hit like a tornado. \u201cYou know better than to cuss in my class. You also know having private spats in the middle of a class experiment is unacceptable.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m havin\u2019 a bad day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom the look of the bruises on your face, I\u2019d also say you had a bad weekend. Want to talk about it?\u201d she asks as she sits on Derek\u2019s chair and leans on the lab table. I get the sense that she\u2019s parked in that spot and isn\u2019t about to move until I spill.</p><p>\u201cNot really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, don\u2019t talk. I\u2019ll do the talking, and you can listen.\u201d</p><p>I put a hand up, stopping her. \u201cYou can save your breath.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy motto is you can\u2019t have too many lectures. Ask your brother to confirm my philosophy.</p><p>\u201cSometimes you\u2019re on a great path, and you reach a fork in the road. Sometimes you decide to go straight, and all is fine and dandy. But then sometimes the other paths look a little interesting, so you choose to switch things up a bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd your point is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t switch things up, Luis. I\u2019ve known your family since you were eleven years old. You\u2019re smart like Alex, you have the drive like Carlos, and you\u2019ve got a boyish charm all your own that\u2019s endearing. You can lose it all like this,\u201d she says, snapping her fingers.</p><p>\u201cSometimes you have no choice about what path you follow. Sometimes you\u2019re forced into it,\u201d I respond.</p><p>She sighs. \u201cI know it\u2019s not easy. Alex started out on a destructive path, but found a way to make it right. I know you will, too.\u201d She waves a finger in my face, acting like the stern teacher she\u2019s always been. \u201cAnd if you cuss in my class again, I\u2019m going to personally drag you down to Dr. Aguirre\u2019s office.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re not as mean as you think you are, you know,\u201d I tell her. \u201cYour zero tolerance policy has too many gray areas.\u201d</p><p>She gives a harrumph and slides off the stool. \u201cIt\u2019s the pregnancy. I assure you after I push this kid out I\u2019ll come back to school meaner than ever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomethin\u2019 to look forward to,\u201d I say sarcastically.</p><p>After detention, I head over to Brickstone.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re late,\u201d Fran says as I pass her in the lobby.</p><p>\u201cI know. My chemistry teacher made me stay after school. It won\u2019t happen again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMake sure it doesn\u2019t. I don\u2019t tolerate tardy employees.\u201d She narrows her eyes and steps closer. \u201cWhat happened to your face?\u201d</p><p>Oh, hell. I could lie and tell her I fell down the stairs, but I doubt she\u2019ll believe me. I might as well just fess up. \u201cI got in a fight.\u201d</p> <p>She motions for me to follow her into her office. \u201cSit down,\u201d she says, pointing to the guest chair. She folds her hands on top of her desk and leans forward. \u201cI\u2019ve hired and fired more employees in my career then I\u2019d like to admit. I know you\u2019re a new employee, but today you\u2019re late and have bruises on your face. My guests don\u2019t want to be served by delinquents. I\u2019ve seen kids like you who are on a downward spiral that only gets worse. I\u2019ve given them chance after chance, but to be honest, it never works out in the end. I wish I had better news for you, but my instincts tell me I\u2019m going to have to let you go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve had a bad week. Just give me another chance,\u201d I say, but she\u2019s already walking toward the door.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. Your last paycheck will be sent to your home.\u201d Fran glances at her watch, a sign that my time is up. \u201cI wish you all the best in your future endeavors. Bill!\u201d she yells out. \u201cMr. Fuentes here is no longer an employee. Please escort him off the property.\u201d</p><p>First she fires me, then she gets a bouncer to kick me out. Talk about adding insult to injury.</p><p>I follow Bill to the front entrance. \u201cIt\u2019s not you,\u201d he says as I hand over my name tag and am told to get in his security vehicle, also known as a golf cart. \u201cWe\u2019ve had some incidents in the past with former employees who stayed on the premises to cause havoc.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo prob, man. You\u2019re just doin\u2019 your job.\u201d</p><p>After being escorted off of Brickstone premises, I take my time walking home. How the hell am I gonna explain getting fired to mi'am\u00e1? It\u2019s bad enough she hasn\u2019t talked to me since she picked me up from the police station on Saturday night. On top of that I\u2019ve got Chuy telling me I\u2019m already a Latino Blood; Nikki, who thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit drug dealer; Peterson breathing down my neck; a cop making moves on mi'am\u00e1; and now I get fired.</p><p>Talk about a week from hell.</p><p>A big black SUV pulls up beside me. It\u2019s Chuy. \u201cHey, Fuentes. Get in the car.\u201d</p><p>When I was a kid I knew to stay away from Chuy. I once overheard Alex tell Paco that Chuy was a crazy motherfucker who\u2019d profess to be your best friend one minute and point a gun at your head the next. Chuy\u2019s older now, with weathered skin and empty eyes. Mi'am\u00e1 warned me to stay away. I\u2019m not afraid of him, and I want to know what he\u2019s up to. I don\u2019t know if that makes me tough or just plain stupid.</p><p>I get in the car and admire the clean leather seats and sweet sound system. \u201cWhere are we goin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe warehouse.\u201d He blows out smoke from his cigarette. It lingers in the car before slowly disappearing. \u201cYou ever been there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s time, amigo.\u201d He drives through town. I notice him looking through the rearview mirror and glancing around, probably making sure we\u2019re not being followed. He makes a quick turn onto a small street between the railroad tracks and an industrial park. It doesn\u2019t take long before we drive through a wooded area and come upon a building that has a big sign on it saying QUINTERO SHIPPING AND RECEIVING. It\u2019s always been a front for the Latino Blood hangout. And now that Chuy is back, the place is buzzing again.</p><p>I take it all in, wondering how come this guy trusts me.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d Chuy says. \u201cYou and I need to have a little chat.\u201d</p><p>A few guys are hanging out front. He flags the Latino Blood gang sign, and they flag back, before parting and letting us pass.</p><p>He leads me to a room off to the side, with a huge leather couch facing a big flat-screen TV.</p><p>\u201cSit down,\u201d Chuy orders as he pulls out another cigarette and lights it.</p><p>I want to know what the hell he wants from me, without the bullshit. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>He shrugs, then sits on the couch and puts his feet up on the coffee table in front of him. \u201cI want to be friends. I\u2019ve kept an eye on you since you left Fairfield. You\u2019re a smart kid, Luis. Smarter than most pendejos out there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou kicked the shit out of my brother and left him for dead. You don\u2019t want to be friends, Chuy. You want to use me as a pawn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re all pawns, Luis. The bottom line is that the Blood needs you, and it\u2019s your time to step up. Everyone has to step up sometime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo fill my brother\u2019s spot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, if you want to rationalize it that way. The Blood is comin\u2019 back to Fairfield. You\u2019re either with us or against us. Alex knew the score and was smart enough to come on board. He knew the consequences of not joinin\u2019 when approached to be a part of our brotherhood. He\u2019s out. The burden is on you now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you sayin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>He pulls out a Glock from the waistband of his jeans, places it on the coffee table with a loud thud, then looks up at me with a stern, serious expression. \u201cYou want to keep your family safe, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>24</p><p>Nikki</p><p>I am a big believer in the justice system. The fact that Luis insinuated I judged him unfairly is just ...</p><p>Okay, maybe I did judge him. But the evidence was right there, at his feet.</p><p>During dinner, I can\u2019t eat. The hurt look on Luis\u2019s bruised face after I told him he was dealing drugs makes me feel horrible. After dinner, I go to Kendall\u2019s house.</p><p>I plop myself on Kendall\u2019s purple beanbag chair in her room and spill everything. \u201cI called Luis out, and he got pissed that I judged him before hearing his side. I feel like crap now. Luis and I fooled around in Derek\u2019s pool house right before the fight. It was intense.\u201d I get butterflies in my stomach remembering how far we went. \u201cI don\u2019t remember it ever being that intense with Marco, and it scared me. I can\u2019t get sucked into a relationship with a guy who\u2019s gangbanging and dealing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree with you there,\u201d Kendall says.</p><p>Oh, how I wish I could turn back time and make Luis ignore Marco\u2019s knock on the pool house door. \u201cI told Luis it was fun fooling around with him, but to be honest it was more than that. It felt real, and I got carried away because of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou told him it was just some casual fun?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat else was I supposed to do, Kendall? I don\u2019t want him thinking that I want to trap him in some exclusive relationship and I\u2019m falling for him. He\u2019d probably laugh in my face anyway.\u201d</p><p>From the first second I met Luis two years ago, I knew he was a player. He didn\u2019t even try to hide the fact that he wanted to get with me the night we met. When I rejected him, he moved on to someone who was more than willing.</p><p>Kendall gets a phone call, but she ignores it. \u201cDid you ever think that Luis wouldn\u2019t consider it being trapped to be in a relationship with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou, my friend, have issues that you still need to work on.\u201d</p><p>Tell me about it. \u201cJust the thought of bringing up the word relationship scares me. It\u2019s a moot subject, though, because we\u2019ve pegged Luis as a gangbanger.\u201d</p><p>Kendall sighs. \u201cI don\u2019t know. If he\u2019s dealing drugs, get out now before you get sucked in. But Derek thinks he\u2019s not doing that stuff. They\u2019ve become friends.\u201d</p><p>Ugh, I\u2019m so confused. I was so sure after Luis got in the fight and I saw the drugs on the ground right there that he was guilty. Now I\u2019m second-guessing myself. \u201cYou think I should go talk to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTalk to who?\u201d Derek says, walking into the room and giving Kendall a kiss like they\u2019re a married couple in love.</p><p>\u201cLuis,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cI saw him get escorted out of Brickstone by security about two hours ago. I tried calling his cell, but he\u2019s not answering. He looked pretty bummed,\u201d Derek says.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d I ask in a panic. \u201cWhy did they fire him?\u201d</p><p>He shrugs. \u201cDon\u2019t know. I asked some of the staff, but didn\u2019t get any answers.\u201d</p><p>With renewed determination, I get off the beanbag and grab my keys. \u201cI\u2019m going over to Luis\u2019s house to talk to him.\u201d I feel sick, as if somehow his detention and getting fired from Brickstone is connected to our argument in chemistry class. I never gave him a chance to explain everything because, in the back of my mind, I was looking for an excuse to push him away. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I took the coward\u2019s way out.</p><p>\u201cNikki, wait!\u201d Kendall grabs her purse. \u201cWe\u2019re going with you for moral support.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, but I need to do this on my own.\u201d</p><p>Kendall gives me an understanding, sympathetic look. \u201cJust remember that if it was meant to be, it\u2019s all good!\u201d</p> <p>It makes me wonder if it wasn\u2019t meant to be, how bad can it get?</p><p>25</p><p>Luis</p><p>I walk home, glad mi'am\u00e1 is working so I can be alone and lock myself in my room. The second I walk in the house, I realize that\u2019s not an option. Both of my brothers are sitting on the couch in the living room. I haven\u2019t seen Carlos in over a year, and wasn\u2019t expecting him to be released from the hospital in Germany until next week. He looks fine, but when he gets up I can tell it\u2019s not without pain.</p><p>\u201cHey, bro!\u201d I say. \u201cThey let you out early?\u201d</p> <p>I couldn\u2019t stand bein\u2019 in the hospital, so I made them release me early. I almost don\u2019t recognize you,\u201d Carlos says, giving me the once-over. \u201cYou\u2019re sportin\u2019 some badass bruises. How does the other guy look?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean the other five guys?\u201d</p><p>Carlos whistles in appreciation as he turns to Alex. \u201cOur little brother has turned into quite the fighter while I was away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me about it,\u201d Alex mumbles. \u201cAsk him who he\u2019s been hangin\u2019 with.\u201d</p><p>Carlos raises an eyebrow. \u201cWho you hangin\u2019 with, Luis?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone of your business. Alex, where\u2019s Brit and Paco?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAt her parents\u2019 house for dinner. I got out of goin\u2019 when I heard Carlos was flyin\u2019 in today. So, Luis ... I got a text from Julio a few minutes ago sayin\u2019 you got the boot. What happened to your job at the country club?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s also none of your business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re our little brother,\u201d Carlos says, advancing on me like a soldier on a mission. \u201cEverythin\u2019 you do is our business.\u201d</p><p>The last thing I need is my brothers giving me shit, especially now. I would push Carlos away, but supposedly he\u2019s got a nasty gash complete with a shitload of stitches on his leg from shrapnel that wedged itself into his muscle.</p><p>\u201cLay off,\u201d I tell him, but my words fall on deaf ears.</p><p>Carlos attempts to pin me to the wall like he did when we were kids. I\u2019m too fast and slip out of his reach, but not before he grabs my T-shirt and pulls it hard to get me to face him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re packin\u2019 heat, aren\u2019t you?\u201d he says as he lets go of my shirt.</p><p>Shit. Busted. Alex is up in a flash. He stands next to Carlos and both of my brothers form a human wall, preventing me from escaping.</p> <p>\u201cGive it to me,\u201d Alex growls.</p><p>Carlos shakes his head. \u201cWhat the fuck, Luis? You gangbangin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>I hear the front door open and mi'am\u00e1\u2019s voice call out, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>Reyes is standing behind her in uniform.</p><p>Carlos immediately blocks me protectively. \u201cYou got a warrant?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cCarlos,\u201d mi'am\u00e1 snaps in a scolding tone. \u201cDon\u2019t be rude. I invited Cesar over for dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho the hell is Cesar?\u201d Carlos asks.</p><p>\u201cOur next-door neighbor,\u201d I explain. \u201cAnd landlord.\u201d</p><p>Carlos looks from me, to Alex, then to mi'am\u00e1. \u201cIs this some sort of joke?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid not,\u201d Alex says.</p><p>Mi'am\u00e1 sets down her groceries in the kitchen, then comes back in the room. \u201cWhat are you doing home so early, Luis?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got fired.\u201d</p><p>She blinks a few times in shock. \u201cFired?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey didn\u2019t want an employee with bruises from a fight servin\u2019 customers.\u201d</p><p>Mi'am\u00e1 shakes her head in disappointment and sighs. Damn, I think she\u2019s about to cry. I wonder if it\u2019s because Officer Friendly is here. She excuses herself and sullenly escapes back to the kitchen.</p><p>Reyes steps forward and holds out his hand to Carlos. \u201cYou must be Carlos. Your mother is really proud of your service. It\u2019s nice to finally meet you.\u201d</p><p>While Carlos and Reyes shake hands, Alex slaps me on the shoulder. \u201cLuis and I will be right back,\u201d he tells them.</p><p>In my room, which used to be our room, Alex goes all father-figure on me. \u201cYou better not be dealin\u2019 drugs,\u201d he says in a harsh whisper so Reyes can\u2019t hear us.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did you get fired? Don\u2019t bullshit me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t for gangbangin\u2019, Alex. I already said I got fired for havin\u2019 bruises on my face ... and for bein\u2019 late for work,\u201d I add.</p><p>\u201cWhy were you late?\u201d Alex asks, not letting up on his interrogation. I think he chose the wrong profession.</p><p>\u201cPeterson gave me a detention. Now lay off, bro. I\u2019m not strapped, and I\u2019m not dealin\u2019 drugs. Seriously, Alex, stop puttin\u2019 your shit on me.\u201d I pull up my shirt and show him that I\u2019m hiding a black rolled-up notebook in my waistband. I pull it out. \u201cI don\u2019t have a gun in my waistband. I have this.\u201d</p><p>Carlos, who just popped in the room, pulls the notebook from my hand. \u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe gun you thought he was hidin\u2019 in his pants,\u201d Alex says. \u201cIt\u2019s a notebook, Sherlock.\u201d</p><p>Carlos opens the notebook and starts reading the first page out loud.</p><p>\u201cNobody really knows her</p><p>Except the chosen few</p><p>Her secrets are kept hidden</p><p>Behind that sun-kissed hue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me that!\u201d I yell as I try to grab the notebook back. Carlos yanks it out of my reach and continues reading.</p><p>\u201cIf I reach out to touch her</p><p>She\u2019ll just run away</p><p>My Forever and Always</p><p>Will have to wait another day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoly shit, bro. That\u2019s deep. Alex, I would\u2019ve bet that you were the sappiest one in this family, but I was wrong. Luis beats you, hands down.\u201d Carlos rolls the notebook back up and hands it to me. \u201cWho\u2019s the lucky girl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter. She thinks I\u2019m scum.\u201d</p><p>Carlos laughs. \u201cThat means she likes you, bro. Shit, the first time I met Kiara, she thought I was an asshole.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were an asshole,\u201d Alex chimes in.</p><p>\u201cDamn straight,\u201d Carlos says, completely proud of it. \u201cGirls like assholes; at least they did when I was in high school. We\u2019re a challenge for \u2019em. Kiara was different.\u201d He laughs just thinking about his girlfriend. \u201cKiara, on the other hand, was my challenge. She didn\u2019t make it easy for me.\u201d</p><p>Nikki\u2019s not making it easy for me, either. Man, life used to be so simple until we moved back to Fairfield. I had a solid, foolproof ten-year plan. Now that I\u2019m back, all my plans have turned to shit. Today I was forced to make a choice between my family\u2019s safety and my own future.</p><p>I had to take the detour. Mi familia comes first. They\u2019ll always come first.</p><p>I had to take the gun Chuy put on the table. I pledged my loyalty to the Blood after that, which screws everything up. How long can I keep the truth from my brothers when they\u2019re already suspicious?</p><p>\u201cAlex! Luis! Carlos! Come help set the table!\u201d mi'am\u00e1 calls out to us.</p><p>My brothers practically jump to attention when they hear her voice.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll talk about this later,\u201d Alex promises.</p><p>I play it cool until everyone is occupied in the kitchen. It\u2019s my opening to find a place to hide the gun.</p><p>When Reyes came in, I maneuvered the Glock so it was hidden in my shorts. Nobody saw me slip a notebook from my backpack and roll it up. I didn\u2019t think I could pull it off, but I did. I swear a few times I thought the gun was about to slip down, but by some miracle it held until Alex walked out of the room.</p><p>Now I\u2019ve got to stash it so my brothers won\u2019t find it, and Paco won\u2019t accidentally get hold of it when he comes over and mistakes it for a toy. Without having time to think, I rush to my closet and shove the Glock in the pocket of the one and only suit I own. I\u2019ve worn it to weddings, funerals, and a few quinces. The suit is in the back of the closet, so I\u2019m confident it\u2019s safely hidden. I walk back to the kitchen and hope I don\u2019t have guilt written all over my face.</p><p>\u201cHey, Ma. Did you know Luis has a crush on a girl?\u201d Carlos says when we\u2019re all eating at the small kitchen table. Even Reyes is still here, but since he\u2019s gotten the hint that we\u2019re not thrilled he\u2019s in the picture, he\u2019s been quiet.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s news to me,\u201d mi'am\u00e1 says. She doesn\u2019t even look in my direction, clearly still pissed at me for getting in a fight and losin\u2019 my job.</p><p>I\u2019m glad when the doorbell rings and interrupts the silence.</p><p>\u201cExpectin\u2019 anyone?\u201d Alex asks as he moves toward the front door.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d mi'am\u00e1 says.</p><p>My cousin Elena stomps in the house like a tornado. Everything about Elena is big. She\u2019s got big hair, a big personality, and ... well, let\u2019s just say she doesn\u2019t need silicone implants. Elena is hilarious, but she is one scary Latina when she\u2019s pissed. \u201cIs the bastard here?\u201d she asks.</p><p>Alex shrugs. \u201cAnd the bastard would be ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cJorge. You know, my cheating husband.\u201d</p><p>Mi'am\u00e1 rushes to Elena\u2019s side. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI found him at Homestyle Buffet with that tramp Nina Herrera.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s Nina Herrera?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cHis high school girlfriend. I caught them in the act.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou caught them having sex at Homestyle Buffet?\u201d Carlos chimes in, confused and maybe a little amused.</p><p>\u201cNo. They had dinner! When was the last time my sonofabitch husband took me to dinner, huh? Huh? Huh? Anyone want to answer that question?\u201d She gestures to each of us, then sneers when she focuses on Reyes. \u201cLorena, are you aware that you\u2019ve got a cop sitting at your dinner table?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Cesar,\u201d he says, standing as he introduces himself.</p><p>She stares at the handcuffs secured to his uniform, just waiting to be slapped on an unsuspecting criminal. Considering Elena herself had run-ins with la ley when she was younger, she doesn\u2019t trust cops any more than the rest of us do. She takes a step away from Cesar as if he has some infectious disease.</p><p>\u201cYeah, umm ...\u201d She turns to mi'am\u00e1 and murmurs fast and furious, \u201cWhatthefuckareyoudoingwithacopinyourhouse?\u201d</p><p>She says it as if it\u2019s all one word.</p><p>Mi'am\u00e1\u2019s response is, \u201cHe\u2019s a friend.\u201d</p><p>Elena nods as slow as her brain is processing the information. \u201cHe\u2019s a friend? Since when did you become friends with cops? Wait, maybe this is a sign!\u201d She plasters a big smile on her face and turns to Reyes. \u201cI need you to arrest my cheating husband.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhile I\u2019d really like to help you,\u201d Reyes says, \u201cI can\u2019t legally do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho said anything about doing it legally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s kidding, right?\u201d Cesar asks mi'am\u00e1, who shrugs with embarrassment. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNot really.\u201d Dismissing Reyes because he can\u2019t help her cause, Elena stands next to Carlos\u2019s plate and reaches out to take a bite of his taquito. \u201cI forgot to welcome you home, Carlos. How\u2019s your leg?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got to be honest, Elena,\u201d Carlos says as she kisses him on the cheek and leaves a big red lipstick mark. \u201cSince you came in, I haven\u2019t felt any pain. You\u2019re more entertainin\u2019 than television, and more effective than Vicodin.\u201d</p><p>She takes her attention off of Carlos and focuses on me. I moan as she takes my cheek and squeezes it between her fingers. \u201cI love you Fuentes boys like you were my own. Mwah!\u201d</p><p>She comes in close. I can clearly see a stray chin hair she needs to pluck, and her strong perfume burns my nostrils.</p> <p>Her lips start to pucker and I cringe. \u201cPlease don\u2019t get lipstick on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you know you love it,\u201d she responds. I try to shield my face, but she plants a wet one on my cheek with her big lips.</p><p>\u201cDid she get me bad?\u201d I ask Alex.</p><p>Alex cocks his head to the side, analyzing the mark. \u201cYeah. She got you good, bro.\u201d</p><p>Alex doesn\u2019t wait for Elena to make her mark on him. Instead, I watch as he opens his arms out wide for a hug. When she goes to kiss him, he ducks and plants one on her cheek.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re sneaky,\u201d she says, wagging her finger. \u201cIf you ever cheat on Brittany, I\u2019ll seriously cut your dick off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d have to get in line behind Brittany if that ever happened. Listen, Elena, I\u2019ll call Jorge and see what\u2019s up. He\u2019s not havin\u2019 an affair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnyone home?\u201d Jorge\u2019s voice echoes through the house.</p><p>My chair scrapes the floor as I make a quick move to help Alex restrain Elena so she doesn\u2019t go all ape shit on Jorge. When Reyes wants to get involved, I hold a hand up to stop him.</p><p>\u201cThis is normal,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>\u201cFor who?\u201d he responds.</p> <p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t cheatin\u2019 on you,\u201d Jorge says, looking like a mess. \u201cNina wanted someone to talk to after she broke up with her boyfriend, that\u2019s all. Stop actin\u2019 like a jealous wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not jealous,\u201d Elena cries out, clawing through us to get to him. \u201cCulero, get a clue. When an ex-girlfriend wants to talk to you, that\u2019s code for \u2018I want you back.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>The doorbell rings again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get it,\u201d Alex says. I\u2019m not paying attention until his loud, commanding voice carries across the house, saying, \u201cLuis, you have a visitor.\u201d</p><p>26</p><p>Nikki</p><p>I stood outside Luis\u2019s house for a few minutes before I got up the nerve to ring the bell. They\u2019re obviously having a party. I can see a house full of people through the front window.</p><p>Alex answered the door. He knows who I am. Every few months my parents invite him and his wife and son to our house for dinner or Sunday brunch. He calls Luis to the door and my heart pounds in anticipation.</p> <p>Luis comes to the door with a big red lipstick mark on his cheek. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d he asks, his voice tense. He\u2019s obviously not happy to see me.</p><p>\u201cCome on in,\u201d Alex says, putting his arm around me and urging me inside.</p><p>\u201cYou still got that lipstick crap on your face, bro,\u201d Alex mumbles to Luis as we pass him.</p><p>Luis curses, then starts wiping his cheek vigorously. \u201cMy cousin likes to mark us,\u201d he explains. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of an unnecessary and annoyin\u2019 tradition.\u201d</p><p>I pass a police officer standing next to Luis\u2019s mom. Carlos is here, too, along with another couple. The couple must be having a heated argument, because they don\u2019t look happy with each other.</p><p>Carlos points to me. \u201cIs this the girl?\u201d he asks Luis. \u201cThe one from the poem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat poem?\u201d I ask, suddenly curious.</p><p>\u201cThere is no poem,\u201d Luis insists. \u201cMy brother is delusional from the pain meds he\u2019s on. Don\u2019t listen to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d I ask Carlos.</p><p>Carlos lifts up his pant leg, revealing a nasty cut stitched together with a row of staples traveling from his thigh all the way down to his calf. \u201cThis is proof that freedom ain\u2019t free.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOuch. How did it happen?\u201d I ask, cringing. Just looking at it is painful.</p><p>\u201cShrapnel from an IED.\u201d He narrows his eyes at me. \u201cYou Mexicana?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarlos!\u201d his mom calls out in a scolding tone.</p><p>\u201cSeriously, bro, shut up,\u201d Luis says.</p><p>Carlos holds up his hands in surrender. \u201cWhat, it\u2019s a crime to ask a girl if she\u2019s Mexican?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s just rude,\u201d Luis says.</p><p>Carlos laughs heartily. \u201cBro, when have you known me not to be rude?\u201d</p><p>I answer Carlos, \u201cI\u2019m American more than Mexican. Does it matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly if you deny your heritage. Don\u2019t want to dilute the culture, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarlos is one to talk,\u201d Alex chimes in. \u201cHis girlfriend is as white as they come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you kiddin\u2019, Alex? Have you looked at your lily-white wife lately?\u201d Carlos argues playfully.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Alex says. \u201cBefore you rip on white people, you might want to remember that your nephew is half white.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot the half that counts,\u201d Carlos says proudly. \u201cListen, I\u2019m an American and fight for this country, but that don\u2019t mean I ignore my Mexican heritage like it\u2019s somethin\u2019 to be ashamed of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not ashamed of it,\u201d I say. \u201cI don\u2019t know Spanish or walk around waving a Mexican flag. I\u2019m not going to fake it, when I don\u2019t know much about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not too late to learn,\u201d Carlos says.</p><p>\u201cLuis, are you going to introduce me to your friend?\u201d his mother cuts in.</p><p>Luis hesitates, so I step forward. \u201cI\u2019m Nikki,\u201d I say with a smile.</p><p>\u201cNikki Cruz,\u201d Alex says. \u201cDr. Cruz\u2019s daughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, I remember you.\u201d She tilts her head, deep in thought. \u201cWeren\u2019t you at Alex\u2019s wedding?\u201d I silently pray she doesn\u2019t mention that I kneed Luis\u2019s nuts on the dance floor. That\u2019s an incident I\u2019d rather not dredge up right now.</p><p>Carlos isn\u2019t going to let this one slip by. He perks up. \u201cOh, yeah! Nikki, weren\u2019t you the one who kicked Luis in the\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNikki goes to Fairfield,\u201d Luis explains. \u201cWe\u2019re in chemistry class together.\u201d</p><p>So now everyone is silent, waiting for me to talk. I turn to Luis and mumble quietly, \u201cCan we talk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Follow me.\u201d I follow him through the kitchen and out the back door. \u201cAll right,\u201d he says. \u201cTalk.\u201d</p><p>I clear my throat and look up at the sky, knowing that Luis wants to go up there one day. Will he pursue his dreams, or has he changed his plans? \u201cI was thinking about what you said in chemistry today. You know, the part about me judging you before I had all the facts. Well, after thinking about it ... you were right.\u201d</p><p>He shrugs. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t really matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt does to me,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cWhy? You\u2019ve made up your mind about me.\u201d He gives a short laugh. \u201cEveryone has.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me right now you\u2019re not dealing drugs and I\u2019ll believe you. Look in my eyes and tell me the truth.\u201d</p><p>He looks me straight in my eyes. \u201cI\u2019m not a dealer,\u201d he says, his gaze not faltering one bit. \u201cThe drugs weren\u2019t mine. I\u2019m not Marco, so stop puttin\u2019 both of us in the same category.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re friends with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m also friends with Derek. Listen, I don\u2019t know what the hell happened between you and Marco. To be honest I don\u2019t really want to know, \u2019cause if I did I\u2019d probably want to kick the shit outta him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need you to protect me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if I want to?\u201d I watch as he looks up at the sky and stares at the stars. \u201cDamn, Nik, you have no clue what crazy thoughts have been runnin\u2019 through my head since we were on Derek\u2019s boat, and then after hookin\u2019 up Saturday night ... You want to ignore what happened, but I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe truth is, I can\u2019t, either.\u201d I swallow the lump forming in my throat. \u201cI have to know if you\u2019re in the LB, because if you are I can\u2019t do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook at me,\u201d he says. When I do he sighs. \u201cI\u2019m not a gangbanger, Nik.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were right to call me out. I wanted to think the worst about you, because if I did I could ignore the connection I feel when we\u2019re together. It\u2019s like I get you, and you get me, and then Saturday night when we were alone in the pool house\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said it was fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you it was fun just to throw you off. Hunter once told me most guys can screw a girl they love just as easily as they can have a one-night stand. Marco was the last guy I dated, and he practically destroyed my heart and soul and everything in between. It was more than fun Saturday night, Luis. I need to know if you think we can make it work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow. The way my week has been goin\u2019, that\u2019s the last thing I expected to hear.\u201d Luis runs a hand through his hair. I can sense the stress radiating off him. \u201cMy life is so fuckin\u2019 complicated right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d I say. \u201cI don\u2019t mean to complicate things more.\u201d I focus on the ground because I don\u2019t want to see his face when he tells me that I\u2019m delusional.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not your fault.\u201d He takes a deep breath, then slowly lets it out. \u201cNik, I gotta be honest. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a good idea to get involved with me right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get it,\u201d I say. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to explain.\u201d He hadn\u2019t tried to hide the fact he was a player from the second I met him. I was stupid to think getting closer to him and feeling a connection meant I\u2019d suddenly changed him.</p><p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t get it.\u201d The sides of his lips turn up in a small smile. My breath hitches when he reaches out and slides his hand to the back of my neck and urges me to look at him. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be with anyone else, mi chava. I want you to be my girlfriend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, really.\u201d</p><p>His words soothe my increasing doubts. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be with anyone else either,\u201d I say.</p><p>I haven\u2019t wanted to let anyone get close to me, but that was before Luis came back into my life. Maybe this push-pull thing is us trying to figure out where we stand. Times have changed, I\u2019ve changed, and I\u2019m ready to put the past behind me.</p><p>A moment passes and I feel a sense of peace cover me like a blanket. I hope he doesn\u2019t see tears threatening to fall from my eyes.</p><p>\u201cCome here,\u201d he says, pulling me close. \u201cYou\u2019re shaking.\u201d</p><p>I close my eyes and a tear falls down my cheek. Luis has managed to slice right through my invisible protective armor and I feel so vulnerable. \u201cI\u2019m scared.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMe too.\u201d He holds me tighter, then kisses the top of my head.</p><p>It feels so good to be held again by him. I bury my head in his chest, soaking up the warmth of his embrace. \u201cPromise me you\u2019ll always be honest with me, Luis.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promise.\u201d</p><p>27</p> <p>Luis</p><p>The second lie I just told my new girlfriend is that I\u2019d be honest with her. The first is that I\u2019m not in the LB. If she knew I have a task to do for the Latino Blood, and I\u2019m ordered to pack heat to prove my allegiance, I\u2019d lose her. I understand that makes me a selfish bastard, but I don\u2019t want to give up the chance at having Nikki be a part of my life.</p><p>The back door opens. It\u2019s Brittany, holding Paco in her arms. The second she sees us, she gasps. \u201cOops, sorry,\u201d she says, backing up. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to interrupt. Paco was looking for you, Luis, and your mom said you were outside. I didn\u2019t know you were with someone.\u201d She squints in confusion as recognition sets in. \u201cNikki Cruz, is that you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Nikki says, stepping away from me.</p><p>\u201cOh. Wow, okay. I didn\u2019t know you and Luis were, um, friends.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re kinda more than that,\u201d I tell my sister-in-law.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Are you guys, like, dating?\u201d</p><p>I drape an arm around Nikki, because it feels right and I want her close. She looks up at me, and I swear I can stare into her expressive dark brown eyes forever. \u201cYeah, we\u2019re datin\u2019,\u201d I say without looking away from my girl. \u201cRight, mi chava?\u201d</p><p>Our eyes are still locked on each other as Nikki smiles up at me and nods.</p><p>\u201cDoes your mom know?\u201d Brittany asks.</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d I tell her.</p> <p>Brittany laughs. \u201cI think she\u2019s got a pretty good idea. I caught her peeking out the kitchen window at least a dozen times since I came in. I had no clue you were out here with a girl ... which completely explains why she was snooping. Mam\u00e1 Fuentes protects her boys like a mother hen. I\u2019m sure I won\u2019t be any different when my son starts to discover girls. You remember that, Paco.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWeese!\u201d Paco yells, and squirms to get out of his mom\u2019s grasp.</p><p>\u201cPaco, T\u00edo Luis is busy,\u201d she tells him. \u201cHe can\u2019t play with you right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Nikki says, tearing her gaze away. \u201cI have to go home anyway.\u201d</p><p>As soon as Brittany lets him down, Paco runs over to me.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s my little taquito?\u201d I ask, picking him up and giving him a high five. \u201cShouldn\u2019t you be asleep by now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, he should,\u201d Brittany chimes in, exasperated. \u201cMy son likes to be up all night and sleep all day ... just like his father.\u201d She places a hand over her growing stomach. \u201cThis one keeps me up all night, too. God help me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a Fuentes,\u201d I tell her proudly. \u201cRight, Paco? You\u2019re gonna have a little brother to boss around soon?\u201d</p> <p>He nods.</p><p>Brittany doesn\u2019t. \u201cHopefully this one\u2019s a girl. The male Fuenteses in this family are exhausting me. I don\u2019t know how your mom survived living with three of you boys under one roof.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever a dull moment.\u201d I faintly hear Carlos laughing. \u201cIt\u2019s still not dull.\u201d</p><p>Alex calls Brittany back to the house, leaving me holding Paco.</p><p>\u201cRemember me?\u201d Nikki asks, tickling my nephew\u2019s stomach. \u201cI\u2019m Nikki.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKi-ki!\u201d Paco yells. \u201cKi-ki-ki-ki. Ki-ki-ki-ki.\u201d He bobs his head from side to side as if he\u2019s singing a song.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re workin\u2019 on his verbal skills,\u201d I tell her.</p><p>She gently smoothes a hand over Paco\u2019s hair. \u201cHe\u2019s perfect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo are you.\u201d I lean in to kiss her, and for an instant an image of us repeating this moment in the future flashes across my mind ... me, Nikki, and a child of our own.</p><p>Nikki says, \u201cI really have to go. We have school tomorrow, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that you made the soccer team. I could watch your practice after school. We can hang out after.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got to do something after practice.\u201d A little task Chuy gave me that Nikki doesn\u2019t need to know about. \u201cBut I\u2019ll meet you later on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she says, nodding. I can\u2019t tell if she\u2019s skeptical or not.</p><p>We walk back in the house. Everyone is, unfortunately, still here. And, unfortunately, all eyes are on us.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna walk Nikki to her car,\u201d I announce to my family. I hand Paco to my brother.</p><p>\u201cBye,\u201d Nikki says, smiling shyly as she gives a nervous, general wave to everyone in the room. She walks up to mi'am\u00e1. \u201cIt was really nice seeing you again, Mrs. Fuentes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d mi'am\u00e1 responds politely. \u201cGive my regards to your parents.\u201d</p><p>Regards to her parents? Suddenly mi'am\u00e1 has turned into a mild-mannered socialite. Is she putting on an act for Officer Reyes? Whatever it is, I\u2019m grateful.</p><p>Nikki and I walk to her car parked out front. She leans against her car door before opening it. \u201cHey,\u201d she says, then bites down on her bottom lip nervously.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know that\u2019s our routine, right?\u201d she says. \u201cYou always say \u2018Hey\u2019 to me, and I say \u2018Hey\u2019 back. Or I say \u2018Hey\u2019 to you, and you say it back to me.\u201d</p><p>I smile. She would pay attention to something like that. I look down at those sweet lips I\u2019m dying to taste again. \u201cHey,\u201d I whisper as I bend down to kiss her.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d she whispers softly against my lips. She puts a hand on my chest. \u201cUm, before we go ahead and make out ... I think you should know that your family is watching us.\u201d</p><p>I glance back at the house. The lights are suddenly off, and I can make out the shadows of my family spying through the front window.</p><p>\u201cThis is embarrassin\u2019,\u201d I mumble.</p><p>\u201cCall me later,\u201d she says as she opens her car door.</p><p>\u201cWait, aren\u2019t we gonna kiss?\u201d Seriously, now that I have a girlfriend, I\u2019m gonna reap the benefits. Hell, the way my week has been going I figure being liplocked with her will keep me sane.</p><p>She gives me a peck. \u201cThere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy cousin Elena\u2019s stupid kisses are better than that, Nik. Come on, mi chava, throw me a bone here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you, we have an audience,\u201d she says.</p><p>I shrug. \u201cI don\u2019t care. Let\u2019s give \u2019em somethin\u2019 worth watchin\u2019. My back is facin\u2019 them, so they won\u2019t see much.\u201d</p><p>She wraps her arms around my neck.</p><p>I moan, loving the feeling of her body leaning against mine.</p><p>It\u2019s dark and quiet outside with only the streetlights giving off a yellow glow. Nikki knows how to get me fired up with a mere touch of her lips, and she uses that to her advantage. Her soft lips brush against mine, over and over. We start making out. Good thing my back is hiding our hot embrace.</p><p>A car driving by honks repeatedly and stops beside her car, ruining the moment. \u201cGettin\u2019 lucky, Fuentes?\u201d a familiar voice yells out the window.</p><p>It\u2019s Marco.</p><p>Nikki freezes, then buries her face in my chest in an attempt to hide her identity. It\u2019s no use, though, because her car is a dead giveaway. My hands are braced against the car, shielding her even though I know it\u2019s useless.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up, Delgado?\u201d I ask.</p><p>He sticks his head out the window. \u201cObviously not as much as you and Nikki. Just a tip: she likes it when you lick her behind her ear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for the advice, man, but I think I can figure it out on my own,\u201d I tell him. \u201cNow get the fuck out of here.\u201d</p><p>Marco\u2019s laugh lingers as he screeches away and disappears down the block.</p><p>\u201cIs he gone?\u201d she asks, her voice muffled because she\u2019s still got her head buried in my chest.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Don\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll tell Marco to lay off.\u201d I tip her chin up so I can get lost in her soulful eyes again. \u201cMy goal is to make you forget you ever dated him.\u201d</p><p>I lean down to kiss her again, but she pulls back. \u201cI just, you know, need to say something before I leave. I don\u2019t want to be worrying about it all night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHit me with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t have sex with you,\u201d she blurts out.</p><p>Her words slam into my libido like a bucket of water on a flame full of testosterone. I think my dick just twitched in protest. \u201cLike, ever?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cI just don\u2019t want our relationship to be about sex and nothing else,\u201d she says. \u201cIf we remove the sex expectation right now, it\u2019ll be better.\u201d</p><p>Better for who?</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want us to be all about sex, either, Nik, but I got to be honest ... I was hopin\u2019 it\u2019d be part of it at some point.\u201d</p><p>She glances to her left and right, as if she wants to make sure nobody else can hear our conversation. \u201cI just can\u2019t. Too many complications, you know.\u201d</p><p>No, I don\u2019t know. Do I even want to know? Shit. Is this about Marco? Or is this all about me?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll understand if the no sex thing is a deal-breaker for you,\u201d she says shyly.</p><p>I\u2019m not gonna lie. Just lookin\u2019 at Nikki makes me horny, but it\u2019s more than that. I like her. A lot. Enough to want to call her my girlfriend. I like just sitting with her and talking. The rest will come when she\u2019s ready.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d I tell her. \u201cI\u2019m cool with the no sex rule. But, uh, can we keep the option open to talk about it in the future? You know, just in case you change your mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she says, lightly kissing me on the lips. \u201cBut don\u2019t hold your breath that I will. We can do other things, though.\u201d</p><p>I raise my eyebrows, interested. \u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll show you later.\u201d She covers her mouth when a smile crosses her face. \u201cI can\u2019t talk about this when your mother is watching. I\u2019ll see you tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>She gets in her car and pulls away just as mi'am\u00e1 opens our front door. \u201cIs there something you need to tell me?\u201d she asks before I step in the house and face the rest of the family.</p><p>\u201cYeah. I have a girlfriend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think a girlfriend will complicate your life?\u201d</p><p>\u201cS\u00ed, Mam\u00e1. It will complicate my life.\u201d But not in the same way she thinks. The Latino Blood is a black cloud over my head. I wish finding out what Chuy is up to didn\u2019t include me getting caught up in the Blood. But it has. \u201cIt\u2019ll all work out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCollege is most important,\u201d she says. \u201cMore important than girls. Don\u2019t let anything sidetrack you from your goals, Luis. You\u2019ll regret it the rest of your life.\u201d</p><p>Right now my goal is to get past tomorrow after soccer practice, when I\u2019ll be going into Evanston. It\u2019s my first errand for Chuy and another way to prove that I\u2019m willing to take risks for the Blood. I\u2019d be lying if I didn\u2019t admit a part of me was looking forward to the challenge. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>28</p><p>Nikki</p><p>In the morning, I wake up and immediately turn my phone on, hoping to have a text from Luis. I get butterflies in my stomach just wondering if he might have been thinking about me when he woke up this morning.</p><p>A text pops up on the screen. It\u2019s from Luis. I can\u2019t help but grin when I read his perfectly thought-out message.</p> <p>Luis: Hey</p><p>The message was sent twenty minutes ago. I quickly type the only appropriate response and press SEND.</p><p>Me: Hey</p><p>I rush to the bathroom, but bring my phone with me just in case he texts me back. While I\u2019m brushing my teeth, I hear the chime on my phone. Another text. I hurry to finish brushing, then pick up my phone.</p><p>Luis: u ok?</p> <p>Me: About what?</p><p>Luis: Us. Me.</p><p>Me: yeah. Why?</p><p>Luis: just checking.</p><p>At school, Luis and I sit on the floor in front of my locker before the bell rings.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t do my math homework last night,\u201d I tell him as I pull out the sheet Mr. Gasper gave our class. \u201cAfter I got home I couldn\u2019t concentrate. I hardly understand it anyway. My brain doesn\u2019t compute calculus. I don\u2019t even know why we have to learn it. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m going to use it in real life.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDepends what you do for a livin\u2019.\u201d Luis slides the sheet onto his lap and studies it. \u201cCome on, we have ten minutes before the bell rings. I\u2019ll help you finish it.\u201d</p><p>I try hard to focus on anything else but him. I move my hand over his and draw invisible circles on the back of his hand with my fingers.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re distractin\u2019 me,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>He laughs, then pulls his hand away. \u201cDon\u2019t you want credit for the homework, mi chava?\u201d</p><p>I kiss him. \u201cYeah, but I\u2019d rather just hang out with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want my girlfriend flunkin\u2019 math and havin\u2019 to take it over in summer school. Focus,\u201d he tells me.</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay.\u201d I put my pencil on the paper, ready to work. \u201cI\u2019m focused.\u201d</p> <p>We work until there\u2019s a minute before the bell rings. All I know is that Luis has the patience of a saint. He was able to explain stuff to me at my level, instead of Mr. Gasper\u2019s way, which is way too confusing.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I say as I slip the sheet into my folder.</p><p>\u201cSit with me at lunch today,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cWith your friends?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He laces his fingers through mine.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t really get along with them. They hate me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be fine, I promise.\u201d</p><p>Kendall and Derek come walking down the hallway. \u201cI guess you two worked it out last night, huh?\u201d Kendall says.</p><p>I squeeze Luis\u2019s hand. \u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>Luis and I part when the bell rings. I know I\u2019m not going to see him until lunch, but I do see Marco. He\u2019s in my gym class. I usually ignore him and he ignores me.</p><p>Today I\u2019m not so lucky.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019ve finally found another guy to obsess over?\u201d Marco asks as we run around the track surrounding the football field.</p><p>I run faster, but he keeps up with me. Mr. Harris, our gym teacher, is holding a stopwatch. \u201cKeep up the good pace,\u201d he calls out as we pass him.</p><p>\u201cThis thing with you and Luis won\u2019t last, you know,\u201d Marco says. He stops talking as a couple of runners pass us. \u201cWhen he dumps you, are you gonna make him feel like dirt and turn everyone on the north side against him, like you did to me?\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t turn anyone against Marco. We broke up at the same time that he joined the Latino Blood. Coming to school with gang tattoos didn\u2019t really help his popularity with the people I hang out with. I know almost everyone on the north side ignored Marco after we broke up. I just don\u2019t think it had anything to do with the breakup and everything to do with him flaunting his gang affiliation.</p><p>I keep running and ignore every word that comes out of Marco\u2019s mouth. I wish I had headphones in my ears to block him out completely.</p><p>\u201cIf you tell Luis what I said, I\u2019ll pass around that naked picture I took of you on my cell.\u201d He leans in close. \u201cWhen I told you I deleted it, I lied.\u201d</p><p>Tears threaten to sting my eyes, but I hold them back. When gym is over, I rush to the locker room and pray that Marco is bluffing.</p><p>At lunch, I spot Luis in the hall just as we\u2019re both entering the cafeteria.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cHey. I\u2019m eating lunch in the library,\u201d I tell him. \u201cI\u2019ve got to study, and I can\u2019t do it when everyone is around. I\u2019ll see you in chemistry, okay?\u201d I need to get away from Marco and his threats.</p><p>He starts to follow me. \u201cI\u2019ll go with you to the library.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You\u2019re the biggest distraction for me right now. I need to focus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously?\u201d Luis asks, unconvinced.</p><p>\u201cSeriously.\u201d I kiss him, loving the feeling of his warm lips on mine that make me forget Marco\u2019s threat for the moment. Being with Luis makes me believe everything will be okay in the end.</p><p>\u201cHey, you two. No PDA,\u201d a teacher calls out. Oh, no. It\u2019s Mrs. Peterson. She taps us on our shoulders. \u201cBreak it up.\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Peterson waits for us to part, then crosses her arms. \u201cNikki, I\u2019m going to have Dr. Aguirre send you home with another Fairfield High student handbook. You obviously haven\u2019t memorized the rules. If you\u2019d like to stay after school and go over them together, I can help you.\u201d She raises an eyebrow at Luis. \u201cThat goes for you, too, Mr. Fuentes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t you ever broken the rules, Mrs. P.?\u201d Luis asks her.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she retorts, but then thinks about it more. \u201cWell, there was this one time in high school ...\u201d Her voice trails off. \u201cNever mind. I don\u2019t want to catch you two kissing in the hallway again. I didn\u2019t make up the rule, but I have to enforce it.\u201d</p><p>Shocker. Mrs. Peterson just admitted to being a rule breaker herself. And maybe she even disagrees with some of the rules. Luis looks pretty pleased with himself that he got her to admit it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you later,\u201d I call out as I head to the library. \u201cGo eat with your friends.\u201d</p><p>I sit in one of the private study carrels and pull out my lunch and a book from the fiction section that I just picked off the shelves. I don\u2019t really have to study. I just don\u2019t know how to tell Luis that I can\u2019t hang out with his friends.</p><p>29</p><p>Luis</p><p>In chemistry, Peterson watches us like a hawk. Damn, that woman might not have made up the rules, but she sure does get off on enforcing \u2019em. Today Peterson is lecturing the entire class. I glance at Nikki and find her looking right at me. She smiles. I\u2019m the luckiest dude on earth. I\u2019m gonna hate leaving her after practice today.</p><p>The bell finally rings. Nikki and I walk to our lockers together.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll meet you on the field,\u201d I tell her, then pull her close.</p><p>She pushes me away. \u201cYou heard what Mrs. Peterson said. No PDA in the halls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not lookin\u2019. Besides, school\u2019s over.\u201d</p><p>She shakes her finger at me. \u201cYou\u2019re living on the edge, Mr. Fuentes,\u201d she says, imitating Mrs. P. \u201cPromise me you won\u2019t get another detention.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t do that, mi chava.\u201d</p><p>In the locker room, Dougan comes up to me as I put my soccer jersey on.</p><p>\u201cNobody likes the idea of you and Nikki together,\u201d he says. \u201cWell, besides Kendall and Derek.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t really give a shit what anyone thinks,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>I sit down on the bench and get my cleats on, hoping Dougan will just disappear.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t.</p><p>He sits next to me. \u201cYou know her parents are gonna have a fit when they find out she\u2019s dating a dude in the LB. I know you\u2019re one of them ... no need to deny it. Just so you know, I\u2019ll be there to comfort Nikki when she realizes you\u2019re just another Mexican scumbag.\u201d</p><p>I finish fastening one cleat and put on the other. I don\u2019t want anyone, especially Dougan, interfering with my relationship with Nikki. I know Alex and Brittany had similar issues. All of their friends tried to warn them their relationship would end up in disaster, but in the end it didn\u2019t matter what anyone else thought. That\u2019s how I want it to be with me and Nik\u2014the two of us figuring this out without interference from anyone else.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know shit, Dougan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know more than you think.\u201d</p><p>I finish tying my cleats and scan the area to make sure we\u2019re alone. \u201cYo, Dougan. If you tell Nikki anythin\u2019, I swear the LB will be all over your ass.\u201d Without waiting for him to respond I head to the field, where the coach is having the team do laps for warm-up. Nikki is sitting in the stands with Kendall, watching us, with a bunch of other girls.</p><p>Marco jogs beside me. \u201cWhat\u2019s up, Fuentes?\u201d He nods toward the bleachers. \u201cI see you got a fan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you have an opinion about my girlfriend, keep it to yourself,\u201d I tell him. \u201cSeriously, stop givin\u2019 her shit or you\u2019ll have to answer to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you, her bodyguard or boyfriend?\u201d he jokes.</p><p>\u201cBoth.\u201d I glance at the bleachers. Nikki doesn\u2019t look too happy that I\u2019m talking to Marco.</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s entertainin\u2019 that you and Nikki have a little thing goin\u2019 on,\u201d Marco says, then pats my back. \u201cGood luck with that, bro ... while it lasts.\u201d</p><p>He sprints to the side of the field to talk to the coach before I can say anything back.</p><p>Derek is a midfielder who can kick the ball farther and more accurately than I\u2019ve ever seen. Marco and I are forwards, and we read the game as if we\u2019re of one mind. Instinctively we know what to expect from each other, and what we\u2019re both thinking.</p><p>The only distraction I have is Nikki. Each time the ball goes out of bounds, I find myself looking for her in the stands.</p><p>\u201cFuentes, what are you doin\u2019?\u201d Coach yells. \u201cSal just threw the ball inbounds to you and you were staring off into La-La Land.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, Coach,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cGet off my field until your head is back in the game,\u201d he yells, then motions for another player to replace me.</p><p>I jog off the field and stop at the water station. I squirt water in my mouth, then douse my head to cool me off.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m distracting you, aren\u2019t I?\u201d Nikki asks.</p><p>I turn around and see her leaning on the chain-link fence. The sun is shining on her dark hair, showing off hints of natural red highlights.</p><p>Is she distracting me? Hell, yeah. \u201cI missed that ball \u2019cause I was lookin\u2019 for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do that,\u201d she says. \u201cDo you want me to leave? It\u2019s not a big deal. I don\u2019t want to piss off your coach.\u201d</p><p>I wink at her. \u201cYou know I don\u2019t want you to leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNikki Cruz, stop distracting my player, or I\u2019ll make this a closed practice and kick you out!\u201d Coach yells.</p><p>\u201cGo make a goal to appease the poor man,\u201d she tells me.</p><p>\u201cWill do.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The rest of the practice I keep myself focused on the drills and not on Nikki. After practice, Marco and I are talking about strategy as we walk out of the locker room. Nikki is waiting for me in the hallway.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d I pat Marco on the back. \u201cI\u2019ll meet you at your car.\u201d</p><p>He sighs. \u201cAll right. But don\u2019t take long. We need to bounce, bro.\u201d</p> <p>I put my arms around Nikki and bend my head down to kiss her, but she pulls back. \u201cYou have plans with Marco?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d I shrug. \u201cHe wants me to help him out with somethin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I didn\u2019t want you to know, all right? Listen, you\u2019ve got issues with the guy and I didn\u2019t want to piss you off. I\u2019ll come over right after, I swear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I don\u2019t mean to question you.\u201d She pulls my head down and kisses me. \u201cI have trust issues.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know. I\u2019m on a mission to cure you of that.\u201d</p><p>I put my arm around her and we walk to the parking lot. Marco is waiting out front in his car. He beeps when he sees me. \u201cCome on, pendejo!\u201d he yells impatiently out the window.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see ya later,\u201d I say to Nikki, then kiss her again before sliding into Marco\u2019s car.</p><p>A few minutes after we drive off, Marco motions to his glove compartment. \u201cOpen it.\u201d</p><p>When I do, five little packets of white powder packed in blue cellophane stare back at me.</p><p>\u201cChuy wants us to unload this shit for seventy-five dollars a pop. We get to keep twenty-five.\u201d</p> <p>I slam the compartment shut. \u201cDude, that\u2019s yeyo. You know, that stuff I almost got busted for over the weekend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me somethin\u2019 I don\u2019t know. Here,\u201d he says, pulling out a sheet of paper with an address scribbled on it: 2416 Newberry Drive. Evanston. \u201cChuy said we could unload it by sellin\u2019 it to this culero.\u201d</p><p>We drive on Sheridan Road through Fairfield, winding down the tree-lined curvy road until we reach Evanston. I\u2019m silent the entire time, looking out the window at pedestrians and wondering what they think of us. Do they see two Mexicans in a car and immediately think we\u2019re drug dealers? Today they\u2019d be spot on. It\u2019s not a big shipment that could put us in jail for ten years, but it\u2019s enough to get us arrested.</p><p>Chuy\u2019s threat runs through my head. You\u2019re either with us or against us. You want to keep your family safe, don\u2019t you?</p><p>Yeah, I want to keep my family safe. I have to do this for my brothers, my nephew, my sister-in-law, and mi'am\u00e1. Doing drug deals for the LB is an obligation as much as it is a way to find out insider info. I\u2019m pretty sure Alex did it, I know Carlos did it ... now it\u2019s my turn.</p><p>It\u2019s still light out, so it\u2019s not hard to find the address. We arrive at the house. \u201cThis place is a dump,\u201d I say, staring at the random pieces of scrap metal and wooden skids piled up in the yard.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll wait in the car,\u201d Marco says.</p><p>I shove the five packets in my pockets. I\u2019ve never done anything like this before and feel like a complete poser. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you do it?\u201d I ask Marco. \u201cYou\u2019re the veteran.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cChuy told me to make you do it. Somethin\u2019 about you provin\u2019 yourself.\u201d He checks his rearview mirror. \u201cLook, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if this guy is one of Chuy\u2019s buddies checkin\u2019 up to make sure you\u2019re gonna follow through.\u201d</p><p>Shit. \u201cYou got my back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah ... Yeah, I got your back.\u201d Marco is acting all cool, as if he\u2019s done this a thousand times and it\u2019s not a big deal. \u201cGo on already. Stop stallin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>I reach into the small duffel I stashed in Marco\u2019s car this morning before school and pull out the Glock. I shove it into my waistband, then walk to the front door. On it is a sticker that says NO SOLICITING. I\u2019m about to sell drugs. Is that soliciting? I could probably do a kick-ass essay on the topic, making an argument for and against it.</p><p>Okay, I am stalling. You can do this, I tell myself as my heart is pumping hard and fast. I ring the doorbell and hear footsteps as someone comes to the door. It opens. A guy with a shaved head that resembles a cage fighter I once saw on TV is standing in front of me. I\u2019m gonna guess he hasn\u2019t showered in a week, because he smells like shit.</p><p>\u201cWho the hell are you?\u201d the guys asks.</p><p>Umm ... what do I say? It\u2019s not easy thinking this stuff up on the fly. \u201cUmm ... I think I got stuff that you want.\u201d</p><p>I sound like an idiot.</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of stuff?\u201d the guys asks, unfazed at how stupid this conversation sounds.</p><p>I start to pull one of the packets out of my pocket when the guy grabs my shirt and pulls me into his house.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t ever do that again, you hear. Pigs drive around these parts lookin\u2019 to bust guys like you. He sees you flashin\u2019 coke and you and I will both be arrested. All right ...\u201d He sniffs a few times and his hands are shaking in anticipation. \u201cShow me what you got.\u201d</p><p>I pull out the five packets. \u201cSeventy-five dollars each. Three seventy-five for all five.\u201d I was always good in math.</p><p>\u201cHow about three fifty?\u201d he counters.</p><p>Seriously, are you even allowed to counteroffer on a drug deal? He obviously thinks I\u2019m a rookie. I am, but if Chuy is monitoring this, I better not back down. If I don\u2019t do this, my loyalty will be questioned.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck do you think I am, a wholesaler?\u201d I say in a pissed-off tone, slipping into the tough gang member role easily. \u201cThree seventy-five or I\u2019m out.\u201d Listen, as long as I\u2019m here, and risking it all, I might as well get the full amount. \u201cI\u2019ve got ten more guys who\u2019ll give me four bills for shit this pure. Either you take it, or they will.\u201d</p><p>I took AP economics\u2014the supply and demand model is powerful stuff. If this dude thinks the supply is low and demand is high, chances are he\u2019ll play the game my way.</p><p>He hesitates for a split second. I take my chances and go for the bluff, heading for the door.</p><p>\u201cOkay, fine!\u201d he calls out. \u201cI\u2019ll be right back with the money. Just ... just wait right there.\u201d</p><p>I hold the packets in one hand and reach around for the Glock with my other. If this guy is about to shoot me, I better be ready to fire back or get the hell out.</p><p>Shit, what have I turned into? A gangbanging drug dealer getting off on being a badass. How easy it\u2019s been for me to do a complete 180. The only thing keeping me here is the fact that if I don\u2019t, I won\u2019t know what Chuy has up his sleeve. It\u2019s something that involves me. I know that for sure. I can\u2019t go to the cops. Chuy\u2019s got eyes and ears all over the streets, and even hinted that he\u2019s got some of the cops in Fairfield on his payroll. For the first time in my life, I can\u2019t do the right thing.</p><p>The thought that this pendejo about to buy drugs from me can be an undercover cop enters my mind, but the way he looked longingly at the yeyo and started sniffing over the prospect of havin\u2019 the stuff within reach makes me forget that thought.</p><p>The guy comes back in the room with a bunch of bills in his hand. \u201cHere,\u201d he says, shoving the money at me.</p><p>Do I count it now, before I leave, or is that considered a dis? I don\u2019t know the protocol here so I\u2019m making this shit up as I go along. I briefly glance down at the money, then hand over the yeyo.</p><p>As I walk back to the car my heart is still pounding. This adrenaline rush gives me a natural high that makes me feel invincible, like I felt when I free solo\u2019d it back in Boulder. The chance I\u2019ll get bitten by a snake here is rare, but lying to Nikki and my family could have worse consequences.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get out of here,\u201d I tell Marco as I slide into the passenger seat.</p><p>I get a text as we speed away from the house.</p><p>Nikki: Hey. what u up to?</p><p>I don\u2019t answer.</p><p>30</p><p>Nikki</p><p>I tell Luis to meet me at the animal shelter. When he pulls up on a motorcycle, I do a double take. He pulls off the helmet and walks over to me.</p><p>\u201cIs that your motorcycle?\u201d I ask him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my cousin Enrique\u2019s. He let me borrow it. He said I could work at his auto body shop a few days a week since he knows I lost my job at Brickstone and business has started to pick up.\u201d He puts his arms around me and holds me for a long time. \u201cI missed you, even if you do smell like wet dog.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI gave Granny a bath.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGranny?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s my favorite dog here. You want to meet her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefinitely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on.\u201d After introducing him to the staff, I take him back to Granny\u2019s cage. \u201cIsn\u2019t she adorable?\u201d I ask as I bend down and pick her up. \u201cShe\u2019s blind, but she can hear you perfectly.\u201d</p><p>Luis takes her from me. \u201cYo, Granny, what\u2019s up?\u201d She nuzzles her nose into his shirt as he pets her. \u201cYou want to take her home, don\u2019t you?\u201d he asks me.</p><p>\u201cHow did you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy the way you look at her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy parents don\u2019t want me to get a dog, but I\u2019m working on them. I think they\u2019ll cave soon. I even had them come meet her.\u201d I look off into the distance. \u201cI think they\u2019re afraid I\u2019ll freak out when she dies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you?\u201d</p><p>I stroke Granny behind her ear. \u201cYeah, probably.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long does Granny have left?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long do any of us have left?\u201d I ask him, getting a thoughtful smile from Luis in return.</p><p>I introduce him to more dogs, and point out all of their stories and quirks. Jake the beagle doesn\u2019t stop howling, Hannah the shepherd mix likes her crate mate a little too much. The puppies that came in today will probably be adopted by noon. \u201cEveryone loves the puppies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept you. You love the pathetic ones, like Granny.\u201d</p><p>I push him playfully. \u201cShe is not pathetic. She\u2019s needy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI took psych last year. If I was a psychologist, I\u2019d probably diagnose you as a person who likes to feel needed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a fair assumption,\u201d I admit. It\u2019s better than being needy. \u201cWhat about you, Mr. Fuentes? Are you needy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can be if you want me to be,\u201d he says, which makes me laugh.</p><p>I show him the makeshift studio I set up to take pictures of the dogs to post on the adoption website I created. I pick up the camera and show him the pictures I took of all the dogs at the shelter.</p><p>\u201cMaggie sleeps a lot, so I put a pillow down and had her lie on it,\u201d I explain. \u201cAnd Buster loves to play catch, so I took this one with three balls in his mouth so people would know he\u2019s a playful guy. I try to show the personality of each dog in the pictures.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m impressed,\u201d he says, eyeing me with admiration as he scans through the pictures. \u201cThese are good. I can see them in a book.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy goal is to get them adopted,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a saint.\u201d</p><p>I think of the picture that Marco said he didn\u2019t delete. \u201cI\u2019m far from it. I\u2019ve done some really dumb things in the past.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe all have.\u201d He holds out his hand. \u201cRemember these scars? I wasn\u2019t lyin\u2019 when I said I got bitten by a snake and fell off a cliff right before my brother\u2019s weddin\u2019. I didn\u2019t wear a harness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I like livin\u2019 on the edge sometimes. Don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Not anymore, at least.\u201d He keeps flipping through the pictures. The last one in the camera is of Granny. It didn\u2019t do her justice. \u201cWait here.\u201d I get Granny and put her in his arms. \u201cSit over there with her.\u201d</p> <p>He sits by the light and pets Granny while I snap pictures. When he turns her over and scratches her stomach while she lies upside down and practically smiles into the camera, I know I have the perfect picture. Granny might be blind and old, but she\u2019s going to be the perfect pet for me. The fact that Luis is smiling warmly as he pets her makes me want to print out a copy to post on my wall at home. I feel like she\u2019s already mine.</p><p>\u201cYour turn,\u201d he says, giving Granny to me. I hold her while he takes a picture of us on his cell phone.</p><p>My mom calls, telling me I have to come home and help her hang new drapes in our living room. She\u2019s into abstract flower patterns that remind her of some artist named Georgia O\u2019Keeffe or something. \u201cI\u2019ve got to go,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>Luis and I head to the now empty parking lot.</p><p>\u201cDo you think we\u2019re rushing into things?\u201d I ask him.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t stress about it, mi chava. It\u2019s all good.\u201d He slips the helmet over his head and revs the engine to his motorcycle.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t kill yourself riding that thing!\u201d I yell.</p><p>He gives me a thumbs-up, then waits until I get in my car before speeding out of the parking lot.</p><p>I come to the realization that my boyfriend is an adrenaline junkie. Can I keep up with him?</p><p>31</p><p>Luis</p> <p>High school soccer games don\u2019t usually have police and security guards at them, except when Fremont plays Fairfield. Our team is pumped on Saturday morning when we play Fremont. We\u2019re rival schools and rival towns with rival gangs. I guess after an incident where a Fremont player got stabbed by a Fairfield player last year, they decided to hire police to patrol the stands and the sidelines just in case all hell breaks loose.</p><p>In the end, we win five to four. Alex, Brittany, Carlos, and Paco stay after the game to talk to some old friends from Fairfield.</p><p>I\u2019m holding Paco when Mariana and a bunch of her friends walk up to me. \u201cCute kid,\u201d she says.</p><p>Paco is a complete chick magnet. He gives them all high fives, and even calls Mariana \u201cchica\u201d like Alex calls Brittany. It actually sounds like cha-cha and the girls find it hilarious. Man, the kid already knows how to flirt with the chicks. My nephew is advanced in that department, but I wouldn\u2019t expect anything less from a Fuentes.</p><p>Carlos is standing next to me, shaking hands with this dude I\u2019ve never seen before. \u201cTell your sister I said hi,\u201d he tells the guy.</p><p>\u201cWho was that?\u201d I ask after the guy walks away.</p><p>\u201cDestiny\u2019s brother.\u201d</p><p>Destiny. His ex. I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s seen her or talked to her since they broke up years ago. I do know that Carlos was obsessed with the girl and had pictures of her taped above his bed. I know Carlos was bummed when she broke up with him and would have done anything to get her back. That was before Kiara was in the picture, though.</p> <p>I look around for Nikki. She\u2019s standing in the bleachers talking to a couple of her friends.</p><p>\u201cHey, Nik!\u201d I yell up to her.</p><p>She glances at me, then looks away.</p><p>What the hell?</p><p>I\u2019m still holding my nephew as I walk up to her. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>Her friends say a quick hello, then scatter.</p><p>Nikki crosses her arms on her chest, her Latina attitude clawing its way to the surface. \u201cTo be honest, I\u2019m kind of jealous you were all chatty-chatty with Mariana.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously, you were jealous?\u201d I ask, amused. \u201cThat\u2019s cool.\u201d It means she cares.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not funny. You were flirting with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was not. Paco was. I don\u2019t know if you could blame a kid who\u2019s not even two years old, though.\u201d I cock my head to the side and change the subject. \u201cDid you see the two goals I made for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you see me point to you after I made them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were pointing to the sky, Luis. Toward God.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was not, and you know it.\u201d She takes Paco from me. My nephew plays with her hair, and suddenly I\u2019m the one who\u2019s jealous. \u201cWhy are you making a joke out of this?\u201d she asks.</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s stupid, Nik. There\u2019s not even room in my day to think about someone else.\u201d Paco starts kissing her on her cheek with big, sloppy wet ones. \u201cHe\u2019s suckin\u2019 up to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least someone is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou tryin\u2019 to fight with me? Before you answer, I should warn you that I find you ridiculously sexy when you\u2019ve got attitude.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just ... forget it,\u201d she says. \u201cIf you don\u2019t even recognize that you\u2019re a flirt, it\u2019s useless to talk about it.\u201d</p><p>My brothers laugh when they see her giving me the cold shoulder. \u201cOh, man,\u201d Carlos says. \u201cI think our little bro is in big trouble.\u201d</p><p>Carlos drapes his arms around both of us. \u201cKiss and make up, you two. Kiara is comin\u2019 here in less than an hour and I\u2019ve got a task for you guys. You too, Alex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of task?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cI need you to dig for mi'am\u00e1\u2019s jewelry box.\u201d</p><p>Oh, no. Not this again. When Carlos was younger he thought it would be brilliant to pretend he was a pirate hiding his treasure. Mi'am\u00e1\u2019s jewelry box doubled as the booty. Ended up it wasn\u2019t such a brilliant idea because Carlos forgot where he hid the box. Mi'am\u00e1\u2019s wedding ring and every piece of jewelry she\u2019d owned was in there. For years we dug in that small wooded area by our house and came up empty-handed.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think Nikki is gonna want to go treasure huntin\u2019,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind,\u201d she says. \u201cWhere is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a good question. I hid it by the ravine near our house.\u201d Carlos rubs the top of his crew cut and winces. \u201cI kinda need it pretty bad. Kiara\u2019s comin\u2019 and, well, I just need to find that damn thing. I tried lookin\u2019 this mornin\u2019, but my damn leg gave out.\u201d</p><p>When Carlos leaves to go pick up Kiara from the airport, the rest of us head over to the ravine with shovels. Nikki had me pick up this German shepherd named Hank from the shelter so he can help with the search, because she swears she can tell he was specially trained at one point in his undocumented life.</p><p>In the woods above the ravine, Alex sections the place out. Alex, Brittany, and I are not optimistic. But Nikki and Hank have enough optimism and energy for all of us. Hank sniffs the air and walks over the sticks and leaves as he and Nikki head to their designated section.</p><p>Brittany waves the small garden shovel in the air, like she\u2019s raising her hand. \u201cHow deep do we have to dig?\u201d she calls out.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Alex tells her. \u201cI figure not too deep \u2019cause Carlos was a kid who hated breakin\u2019 a sweat.\u201d</p><p>I start digging, spacing my holes about ten inches apart in a grid pattern so I don\u2019t miss anything. The jewelry box was white, so it should be easy to find. I look over at Nikki. She\u2019s talking to the dog and instructing him to \u201cgo find it!\u201d Seriously, is a dog supposed to know what it means? I laugh as Hank sniffs away. The second he settles on a spot, Nikki starts digging away. She\u2019s so intent on her task, she doesn\u2019t look up.</p><p>Which means I can watch her.</p><p>I know what she\u2019s thinking. In her mind, Carlos needs her. He\u2019s desperate to find the jewelry box, and I know she\u2019s more than motivated to find it for him. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if she dug in every spot Hank sniffs until darkness falls. My girl is on a mission. I don\u2019t have the heart to tell her that Hank might be sniffing for a place to shit, not because he\u2019s actually following a scent.</p><p>I wonder what she\u2019d say if I told her I need her, too.</p><p>After twenty minutes and about five false alarms, I hear Nikki screaming, \u201cI think Hank found it!\u201d</p><p>My head pops up and I see Nikki on her knees, waving her arms back and forth so we can see her. Sure enough, when I get close I see she\u2019s dug out a tiny section of what looks like it could be a jewelry box. Hank is barking now, crazy excited.</p><p>\u201cThat dog is a fuckin\u2019 genius, Nikki,\u201d Alex says, taking his shovel and digging the rest of it out. Moments later, I help lift it free.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m textin\u2019 Carlos and tellin\u2019 him we found it,\u201d I say as Alex pries open the rotted top.</p><p>Nikki\u2019s got a huge grin as she praises Hank and gives him a treat she stashed in her pocket. I\u2019m still in shock and can\u2019t believe the dog had anything to do with it. Maybe it was just plain luck, but then again, when I look down at the dog I think he\u2019s got a proud grin on his face.</p><p>Alex takes out mi'am\u00e1\u2019s engagement ring and holds it up to the light shining through the trees. The diamond glitters in the light.</p><p>Back home, Nikki announces the good news to mi'am\u00e1. Mi'am\u00e1 opens the box and takes out her wedding band and engagement ring. She slips them on as tears run down her cheeks. \u201cIt\u2019s been so long,\u201d she says, choking back the words. Paco asks her if she\u2019s got a boo-boo because she\u2019s crying. \u201cYes,\u201d she says to him. \u201cI have a boo-boo.\u201d</p><p>Ma places the rings back in the dirty box just as Carlos and Kiara walk in the door. Kiara is yelling at Carlos for carrying her luggage in the house when he\u2019s not fully healed, but he\u2019s just ignoring her protests. Kiara should know by now that he\u2019s one stubborn motherfucker. They\u2019re checking into a nearby hotel later, but he didn\u2019t want to leave her expensive luggage in the car while it was parked in front of the house.</p><p>\u201cAre you two seriously fightin\u2019?\u201d Alex asks. \u201cYou haven\u2019t seen each other in over a year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe like to argue,\u201d Carlos tells him. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the two things we do best. Right, mamacita?\u201d</p><p>Kiara rolls her eyes. \u201cRemind m-m-me why I\u2019m in love with you again?\u201d</p><p>Carlos gives her a mischievous grin as he pulls her close. \u201cI\u2019ll show you later.\u201d</p><p>Kiara seems content with that answer as she hugs me, Brittany, and Alex.</p><p>\u201cThis is my girlfriend, Nikki,\u201d I tell her, then point to the dirty dog panting on the floor. \u201cAnd that\u2019s Hank the orphan.\u201d</p><p>Nikki isn\u2019t prepared for Kiara to hug her like a long-lost sister, and then go over to pet Hank, who rolls onto his back for full exposure.</p><p>Brittany and Alex leave to pick up Shelley, Brittany\u2019s sister. She lives in a care facility for people with disabilities, but spends most weekends at Alex and Brit\u2019s place. Paco loves riding in her wheelchair and has no clue she\u2019s disabled. Nikki and Shelley obviously know each other from previous interactions and, when Shelly arrives, immediately start chatting about dogs and the shelter. Nikki promises to take Shelley to the shelter one day, which makes Shelley squeal with happiness and Brittany smile with gratitude. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>At dinner when our entire family is together, it really hits me that Nikki and I are a couple. My arm rests on the back of Nikki\u2019s chair and she leans into me. I hate to admit I\u2019m falling hard and fast. Just the thought of losing her because of my involvement with the LB stresses me out. Especially when I get a text from Marco to meet him later tonight at the warehouse.</p><p>I reach for Nikki\u2019s hand and squeeze it under the table. She squeezes back, then looks up at me.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d she asks quietly while the rest of my family is pigging out. \u201cYou\u2019ve been quiet ever since we got here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was just thinkin\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d</p><p>I lean in close and whisper in her ear, \u201cRenegotiatin\u2019 the terms of our relationship.\u201d</p><p>Her face turns beet red and she whispers back, \u201cWe\u2019ll discuss that later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust so you know, I got an A in debate,\u201d I tell her.</p><p>She looks up at me with a grin on her sexy ruby lips. \u201cSo did I.\u201d</p> <p>32</p><p>Nikki</p><p>On Monday, Luis surprises me by coming over to my house after soccer practice.</p><p>\u201cYou could have just texted me,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>He shrugs. \u201cYeah, well, I thought you could use a calculus tutor. I\u2019m offerin\u2019 my services,\u201d he says, then adds with not a small hint of cockiness, \u201cfor free.\u201d</p><p>Oh, man, I am in trouble. The more time I spend with Luis, the more I want to be with him. I force myself to keep distant, and tell myself that I\u2019m not going to let him get too close. I\u2019d like to, though. When he puts his arms around me, I feel protected and safe. My mind tells me it\u2019s a false sense of security. I\u2019m constantly trying to determine which of my emotions is centered on reality.</p> <p>I even get the sense that when he says he\u2019s going to work at his cousin\u2019s auto body shop, he\u2019s actually doing something else. I\u2019m probably being paranoid. I told him to be honest with me, and I want to trust him. But I have my doubts. It\u2019s easy to push all doubts to the back of my head when I\u2019m with him, though.</p><p>\u201cI do need some help in calc,\u201d I admit.</p><p>\u201cHi, Luis,\u201d Mom says as I lead him to the kitchen table where my books are spread out.</p><p>\u201cHi, Mrs. Cruz,\u201d Luis says politely.</p><p>\u201cYou two have been spending a lot of time together lately,\u201d she says, stating the obvious.</p><p>Luis nods. \u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I hope it\u2019s not too serious. Nikki has to concentrate on her college applications and keeping her grades up.\u201d</p><p>I cringe. \u201cMom, don\u2019t embarrass me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Nik,\u201d Luis tells me. \u201cMy ma said the same thing.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m tempted to prove to them both that we don\u2019t have to compromise our future just because we\u2019re together.</p><p>\u201cCan Luis eat over, Mom?\u201d I blurt out, changing the subject before she asks him for his dating credentials. I know she worries about me, and doesn\u2019t want a repeat of what happened between me and Marco. Both my parents have grilled me about any boy I talk to. What they don\u2019t know is that all friendships I\u2019ve had with guys after Marco were just that\u2014friendships. This thing with Luis ... it\u2019s much more. But I told my parents we were just friends so they won\u2019t freak out.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re ordering Chinese, Luis,\u201d Mom says. \u201cDo you like Chinese?\u201d</p><p>He shrugs. \u201cI can eat anythin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re more than welcome to join us for dinner.\u201d She says it without a smile on her face, like she\u2019s only saying it to be polite. I hope Luis doesn\u2019t notice. She looks at our schoolbooks spread on the kitchen table. \u201cYou guys better get cracking on that homework.\u201d</p><p>Luis and I sit at the kitchen table. He helps me with my calculus, then moves across the table to start on his own homework. I\u2019m working on a poem for language arts. Our teacher said we should write about someone who had an impact on our lives, whether it was good or bad. I want to write about Luis, because he makes me want to change ... he makes me want to love again. I\u2019m still holding back, but to be honest, I don\u2019t want to.</p><p>I glance at Luis for inspiration.</p><p>I catch him checking me out at the same time. Nervous butterflies flutter in my stomach as I fantasize about what it would be like if we were alone together.</p><p>I expect him to look away, but he doesn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you staring at me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d ask you the same thing,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cDo your work,\u201d I tell him, trying not to let on that I\u2019m tempted to go sit on his lap and wrap my arms around his neck.</p><p>He looks down at his social studies folder. \u201cI can feel your eyes on me,\u201d he says after a minute.</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d I stare at the blank page and start my poem. My first attempt is about a hero, who has come to save me before my heart turns completely to ice and cracks in a million little pieces never to be healed. No, that sounds too paranormal. I hope what I have with Luis is real, but after my bad judgment in the past, I don\u2019t trust my instincts.</p><p>\u201cWant to come over on Sunday?\u201d he asks me. \u201cMi'am\u00e1 will be at work, and my brothers are gonna barbeque.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna warn you, though. They\u2019ve already talked about playin\u2019 Panty Discus.\u201d He laughs when he sees my expression. \u201cIt\u2019s not what you think. It\u2019s a game played with a tennis ball and panty hose ... the kind that women wear. You have to see it to really appreciate it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure,\u201d I say, unconvinced. \u201cAre your brothers competitive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just say I suspect Carlos started trainin\u2019 for it months ago while he was stationed overseas. Alex has always won, but now that we\u2019ll be playin\u2019 in pairs I think we\u2019ve got a good shot at winnin\u2019 the whole thing. Brittany is kind of a lightweight when it comes to strength.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you win?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBraggin\u2019 rights.\u201d He shrugs. \u201cThey\u2019re kind of a big deal in my family.\u201d</p><p>When my mom goes to pick up the Chinese food, I bite my lip wondering if I should bring up The Talk. I look up at Luis and know I\u2019m going to have a hard time keeping to my original conditions.</p><p>\u201cUmm ... didn\u2019t you challenge me to a debate or something like that the other night?\u201d</p><p>His head shoots up. \u201cYeah. I\u2019m ready.\u201d</p><p>I laugh. \u201cFor what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe debate, or, you know ... whatever you\u2019re ready for ... I\u2019m all in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t the World Series of poker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what it is, chica.\u201d</p><p>I twirl my hair on my finger nervously. \u201cI have to admit I\u2019ve been thinking about being with you a lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too. Come here.\u201d He pulls his chair out and motions for me to sit on his lap. Hoping my mom won\u2019t come in, I sit on his lap and wrap my arms around his neck. I look down at his dark, mesmerizing eyes. \u201cNik, I won\u2019t hurt you. I\u2019m not gonna ditch you afterward.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. It\u2019s just hard for me and ... I\u2019m afraid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf what?\u201d He rubs my back affectionately. \u201cTalk to me.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t say what\u2019s really on my mind. Marco. The miscarriage. The betrayal. Luis\u2019s secrets. I\u2019m afraid of making myself vulnerable. I bury my face in his neck and squeeze tight. Despite all of my inhibitions and all of my suspicions, I\u2019m falling for Luis. Being able to resist him physically is beginning to be impossible.</p><p>\u201cJust so you know ... I\u2019m not on the pill or anything,\u201d I say softly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got condoms,\u201d he says, then smiles sheepishly. \u201cNot on me, of course. I\u2019m not one of those pendejos who carries one around just in case.\u201d</p><p>Who better to get over the past than with someone I want to be with ... someone who I\u2019m starting to fall in love with. I lean in and whisper in his ear, \u201cI\u2019m nervous.\u201d</p><p>He reaches up and cups my face in his palm. \u201cYou need to trust me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if I can.\u201d</p><p>33</p><p>Luis</p><p>I\u2019m not sure asking Nikki to come over on Sunday was the best idea, especially when Carlos decides to grill my girlfriend and embarrass the shit outta me.</p><p>\u201cSo, Nikki,\u201d Carlos says the second she walks in the house, \u201cdid you know Luis stares at a picture of you and some dog on his phone for like an hour before he goes to sleep? I swear he takes it in the can with him, too, but I don\u2019t know what the hell he\u2019s been doin\u2019 in there with it.\u201d</p><p>Carlos was never one to listen to directions. I told him this morning not to say stupid shit to Nikki. I should\u2019ve known that wasn\u2019t gonna happen.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t listen to him, Nik,\u201d I tell her.</p><p>\u201cI second that,\u201d Kiara says, giving Carlos the evil eye. She whacks him in the stomach. \u201cDon\u2019t embarrass them, Carlos.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think she should be flattered to know how much my little bro likes her,\u201d he says innocently.</p><p>\u201cIt is kind of a coincidence,\u201d Nikki says, unfazed. \u201cBecause I look at Luis\u2019s picture all the time, too.\u201d She looks at me and winks.</p><p>The entire house goes silent. Damn. I didn\u2019t know my novia could hold her own against Carlos.</p><p>She looks up at me adoringly. \u201cGreat minds think alike. Right, Luis?\u201d</p><p>Damn straight. I wink at her and take her hand in mine. \u201cDefinitely.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes light up, and when the sunlight shines through the front window and hits them, I notice her brown eyes have golden specks inside.</p><p>Nikki tilts her head to the side and asks Carlos, \u201cSo, when are you and Kiara getting engaged? Luis told me you two have been dating a long time.\u201d</p><p>Go, Nikki! My girl can take the heat and dish it right back. That\u2019ll teach my brother to stick his nose where it doesn\u2019t belong.</p><p>Alex, who just came in from the kitchen, can\u2019t hold in his laughter. \u201cShe\u2019s got you there, bro.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, Carlos?\u201d Kiara chimes in. \u201cWhen are we g-g-getting engaged?\u201d</p><p>Carlos clears his throat. And moans in defeat. \u201cCan we talk about this later?\u201d he asks, then narrows his eyes mockingly at Nikki. \u201cWarn me next time I get the urge to embarrass you and my brother.\u201d</p><p>Nikki gives him a thumbs-up. \u201cWill do.\u201d</p><p>After we eat, Alex holds out mi'am\u00e1\u2019s panty hose and says, \u201cCompetition time.\u201d</p><p>I stare at the hose. Alex will be long gone, back at his house, when mi'am\u00e1 notices that two pairs of hose are completely cut off at the top of the leg. There\u2019s no doubt in my mind that she\u2019ll notice. It\u2019s not a matter of if, but when. And I\u2019ll be here to face the consequences.</p><p>The problem with my brothers, besides the obvious, is that we\u2019re competitive. It\u2019s not even normal sibling rivalry. If there\u2019s a competition, it\u2019s all-out war. The winner gets the right to brag about it forever, and the loser gets the right to be made fun of forever. It\u2019s kind of like a religious tradition.</p><p>The competitions in the past weren\u2019t fair because I\u2019m younger than my brothers. But now we\u2019re about the same height and same strength, so any competition is going to be fierce. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s head to the park,\u201d Alex says, then pulls out a tennis ball from the front closet.

It sounds like a slam on women, to be honest.\u201d She puts her hands on her hips, and all I can think about is seeing those hips without any clothes covering them.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a slam on women,\u201d I tell her. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if one day it became an Olympic sport.\u201d</p><p>She laughs. \u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p> <p>We all head over to a huge, empty grassy area by the park.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re playin\u2019 in teams,\u201d Alex says. \u201cCouples against couples.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not playing something that\u2019s named Panty Discus,\u201d Brittany exclaims. \u201cI know you explained what it meant, but it still sounds dirty.\u201d She earmuffs Paco. \u201cAnd I really don\u2019t want Paco saying it.\u201d</p><p>Carlos rolls his eyes. \u201cBrit, get that stick out of your rich ass, please, and suck it up. You\u2019re playin\u2019. And when my nephew is old enough, he\u2019ll not only be sayin\u2019 it, he\u2019ll be playin\u2019 it, too. It\u2019s a Fuentes tradition.\u201d</p><p>Brittany\u2019s mouth is open in shock. \u201cCarlos, if I\u2019m concerned about my son hearing Panty Discus,\u201d she says, whispering the offending words, \u201cdo you really think I want him to hear cuss words flying out of your mouth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I at least spell them?\u201d Carlos asks. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s kidding.</p> <p>Alex gets in the middle of them. \u201cThat\u2019s fine. Brit, if you don\u2019t want to play, you don\u2019t have to. Paco can fill in for you, although to be honest, it\u2019ll probably kill my winnin\u2019 streak.\u201d</p><p>Brittany walks up to Alex and points her finger to his chest. \u201cI\u2019ll do it, but only because I\u2019m your wife and I love you.\u201d</p><p>Kiara watches Alex and Brittany with a longing gaze, then stares at my oblivious brother Carlos. Nikki was just joking with her back at the house, but I\u2019ve got the feeling Kiara\u2019s been waiting for a ring from my brother. I don\u2019t know why he\u2019s been dragging his feet, because we all know it\u2019s gonna happen.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m game,\u201d Kiara says with a sigh.</p><p>I look at Nikki. I can\u2019t wait to get this over with so I can be alone with her.</p><p>\u201cHow about you, Nik?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m game, too,\u201d she says, giving me look that gets my heart racing. \u201cJust tell me what to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does the winner get?\u201d Brittany asks.</p> <p>\u201cBraggin\u2019 rights,\u201d Carlos explains. \u201cWhich in this family is worth more than money.\u201d He turns to Kiara. \u201cWe better win, mamacita.\u201d</p><p>Alex sets up a stick as the starting line and shows everyone the homemade Panty Discus contraption\u2014which is just a leg cut off of a pair of women\u2019s panty hose with a ball stuck in the toe end and a knot in the other end. \u201cThe object is to toss the Panty Discus as far as you can. Farthest combined toss wins.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOldest goes first,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>\u201cWorks for me.\u201d Alex stands at the starting line and starts twirling the ball over his head faster and faster before he releases it. It flies high and far in the air. When it lands, he\u2019s pretty cocky thinking that nobody can best him. He places a rock in its place. \u201cBrit, your turn.\u201d</p><p>I watch as Brittany tries the same technique, twirling the ball over her head. He stands next to her, coaching, while Paco makes a game of trying to pat down my spiked hair. \u201cCome on, Brit, I got full faith in you to pull this one out,\u201d Alex says to Brittany. \u201cTwirl it faster now. Damn, girl, you look hot doin\u2019 that. Okay, release!\u201d</p><p>She does, but the Panty Discus is released when the ball is aimed to the side and flies out of her hand, heading directly to her right and not straight ahead. It lands about fifteen feet to the side of the starting line.</p><p>\u201cWhat. The. Hell. Was. That?\u201d Alex asks, sucking in a breath.</p><p>Brittany huffs and cries out, \u201cYou said I looked hot and it totally threw me off. It\u2019s not my fault. I\u2019ve never played this game before, Alex. Next time, shut up and let me toss it without your comments.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChica, that was embarrassin\u2019. You need some intensive Panty Discus instruction.\u201d He playfully picks her up and carries her to where we\u2019re sitting. \u201cWhen we get home\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy turn!\u201d Carlos says, rubbing his hands together gleefully. \u201cWatch and learn from the expert, people.\u201d He limps over to the starting line and circles one end of the hose over his head. \u201cYou takin\u2019 notes, Kiara?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m too busy w-w-watching your muscles flex,\u201d she says.</p><p>He wags his eyebrows at her, then whips the Panty Discus with all he\u2019s got and it lands a yard or so farther than Alex\u2019s toss. Carlos yelps out another war cry and kisses his newfound army muscles. \u201cArmy strong, suck\u2019ahs!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re loco,\u201d I tell him as he puts a stick to mark the place of his throw and hands the Panty Discus to Kiara.</p><p>Kiara imitates Carlos\u2019s helicopter-style move and does a pretty good job whipping the hose in front of her. It doesn\u2019t go as far as his, but at least it\u2019s straight. Carlos nods, impressed with her toss. \u201cI think we\u2019ve got it in the bag, Kiara,\u201d he tells her as he marks her spot.</p><p>My turn.</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d Nikki says before I step up to the starting line. She rushes up to me and crushes my mouth to hers. \u201cGood luck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm, I like good luck kisses. We should have Panty Discus tournaments all the time,\u201d I say.</p><p>She stands aside while I take a deep breath and channel all of my energy toward getting this thing past Carlos\u2019s marker. I twirl the hose around, then with all my might whip it in the air. It flies high, and I\u2019m sure I got the height but fear I\u2019m lacking the distance until it falls a few inches past Carlos\u2019s stick.</p><p>\u201cNo way!\u201d Carlos says.</p><p>I kiss my muscles, mocking him. \u201cDon\u2019t knock the swimmer, suck\u2019ahs! Even in the off season we can kick butt.\u201d</p><p>I grab Nikki around the waist and pull her against me. \u201cHow was that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour turn. Make me proud, chica.\u201d</p><p>Nikki walks up to the starting line, determination and focus outlined in her tense expression. She whips the ball around her head like a warrior with a war club, then releases the thing in the air with a loud grunt that echoes throughout the park.</p><p>It lands way farther than Kiara\u2019s. Adding up the combined distances, we win.</p><p>I point to Nikki. \u201cThat\u2019s my girl.\u201d</p><p>She jumps up and down, raising her hands in the air like we just won a trip to Hawaii. \u201cWe did it!\u201d</p><p>As we\u2019re celebrating, a car drives up with a bunch of girls inside. The car stops and a girl gets out. She\u2019s got a huge grin on her face and is walking with a sway of her hips as she makes a direct beeline toward Carlos. \u201cCarlos!\u201d she says excitedly. \u201cI can\u2019t believe it\u2019s you! My brother told me you were back, but ... well, my friends and I were about to go to the city, but I made them make a detour. I had to check for myself to see if it was true.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s Destiny, my brother\u2019s ex from high school.</p><p>My brother\u2019s eyes go wide with shock. \u201cHoly s-h-i-t, Des. It\u2019s been a long time. How the h-e-l-l are ya?\u201d He points to Paco. \u201cGotta watch the language around my nephew.\u201d</p><p>She laughs. \u201cHangin\u2019 in there. Going to school for nursing. What about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in the army. Stationed in the Middle East, but I\u2019m on leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow.\u201d She makes a point of licking her lips as she checks him out. \u201cT\u00fa eres guapo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou look great, too. The same as I remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou still single?\u201d</p><p>He holds up his left hand and points to his ring finger. \u201cYep. Still a bachelor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAwesome.\u201d One of her friends calls to her. \u201cI got to go, but it was great seeing you.\u201d She pulls out a card from her purse. \u201cCall me sometime. My number\u2019s on the back. I\u2019d love to catch up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool,\u201d he says, shoving the card in his back pocket.</p><p>We all watch as my brother\u2019s ex-girlfriend wraps her arms around him and hugs him tight. There are a few kinds of hugs. A short, impersonal \u201cobligatory\u201d hug. A medium-length \u201cit\u2019s good to see you\u201d hug, and then there\u2019s the kind of hug that Destiny is currently giving my brother. It\u2019s a lingering, \u201cI want to be more than friends\u201d hug/squeeze combo.</p><p>I look over at Kiara, standing beside Brittany, absolutely aware of the kind of hug Destiny is giving my brother.</p><p>\u201cReally, call me,\u201d she calls out as she goes back to her friends.</p><p>When Carlos finally turns around and faces us, he must see the look of shock on our faces. I think nobody wants to talk first, because we don\u2019t know what to say.</p><p>Kiara finally does the talking.</p><p>She holds up her left hand and shows off the \u201cno ring\u201d finger. \u201cStill a bachelor!\u201d she says sarcastically, mimicking him. \u201cAre you kidding me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he says, clueless. \u201cIt\u2019s the truth. What do you want me to do, lie to her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I want you to press your bodies together and grind against each other like you were doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t grind against her. It was an innocent hug good-bye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI-I-Innocent? Honey, that hug was anything but innocent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKiara, you\u2019re overreactin\u2019. You want to argue, is that what this is all about? \u2019Cause I\u2019m leavin\u2019 soon and we won\u2019t be seein\u2019 each other for at least six more months. The last thing I need is you creatin\u2019 drama.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t want to argue. And I\u2019m not creating drama, Carlos. You are.\u201d Kiara\u2019s nostrils flare in fury, and I notice her eyes getting watery. But she doesn\u2019t lash out at him, or start bawling. Instead she just says, \u201cMaybe you should get back with Destiny. I think she\u2019d like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that what you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt seems like that\u2019s what you want. Why don\u2019t you take out that card and call her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I will,\u201d he yells, pissed off now. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGood. While you\u2019re at it, why don\u2019t you ask her to marry you. You obviously don\u2019t want to marry me,\u201d she says, then walks back to our house.</p><p>\u201cCarlos, I love you, but you can be the biggest idiot sometimes,\u201d Brittany pipes in, then follows after Kiara.</p><p>Nikki steps back, says, \u201cI\u2019m gonna go with the girls,\u201d and jogs away from us.</p><p>Alex and I both look at Carlos.</p> <p>Carlos holds up his hands. \u201cWhat?\u201d he asks defensively, completely oblivious.</p><p>\u201cYou just dissed Kiara in front of Destiny,\u201d Alex says.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t dis her.\u201d He leans in and whispers, \u201cI was makin\u2019 sure she didn\u2019t get a clue that I\u2019m gonna propose to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could\u2019ve at least introduced her as your girlfriend.\u201d</p><p>Carlos retrieves the discus and says, \u201cAlex, the last thing she\u2019d want to do is meet Destiny.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t get it,\u201d I murmur.</p><p>Alex braces his arms on Carlos\u2019s shoulders. \u201cDoes Destiny think you have a girlfriend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy the hell would that matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause, Carlos, she was flirtin\u2019 with you big-time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what? Girls flirt with me all the time. That doesn\u2019t mean I cheat on Kiara. She knows I wouldn\u2019t fuck around on her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOther girls aren\u2019t your ex, dumbass,\u201d Alex says. \u201cNow go apologize to Kiara, and fix this. Beg, if you have to.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe thinks you don\u2019t want to marry her,\u201d I add.</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d Carlos says. \u201cI asked you all to look for Mam\u00e1\u2019s jewelry box \u2019cause she said if we finally found it I could give Kiara the ring Pap\u00e1 gave her. It\u2019s at the jeweler bein\u2019 cleaned. I was gonna take her to Ravinia tomorrow and propose durin\u2019 intermission.\u201d He rubs the back of his neck and lets out a long, slow breath. \u201cI gotta figure this out.\u201d</p><p>Back at the house, the girls are standing in the front yard. Kiara puts on a brave face, but it\u2019s obvious she\u2019s been crying.</p><p>\u201cYou told me you were over D-Destiny,\u201d Kiara tells Carlos. \u201cBut that\u2019s obviously not true. I\u2019m g-g-going back to Colorado tonight. I\u2019m tired of waiting around for s-s-something that\u2019s never going to happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was over Destiny the second you put those stupid cookie magnets in my locker in high school,\u201d Carlos tells her.</p><p>\u201cI d-don\u2019t believe you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted to make it special for you, but what the hell ... I might as well do it now.\u201d Carlos takes a deep breath. \u201cMarry me, Kiara,\u201d he blurts out in front of everyone.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d she asks, challenging him.</p> <p>\u201cBecause I love you,\u201d he says, walking up to her and bending down on one knee while he takes her hand in his, \u201cand I want to go to sleep with you every night and wake up seein\u2019 your face every mornin\u2019, I want you to be the mother of my children, I want to fix cars with you and eat your crappy tofu tacos that you think are Mexican. I want to climb mountains with you and be challenged by you, I want to argue with you just so we can have crazy hot makeup sex. Marry me, because without you I\u2019d be six feet under ... and because I love your family like they\u2019re my own ... and because you\u2019re my best friend and I want to grow old with you.\u201d He starts tearing up, and it\u2019s shocking because I\u2019ve never seen him cry. \u201cMarry me, Kiara Westford, because when I got shot the only thing I was thinkin\u2019 about was comin\u2019 back here and makin\u2019 you my wife. Say yes, chica.\u201d</p><p>Kiara is crying now. \u201cYes!\u201d she says.</p><p>We all give our congratulations and talk to a couple of neighbors across the street who witnessed the scene, but when I turn back around I notice that Nikki disappeared.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Nik?\u201d I ask Brittany.</p><p>Brittany points to the house. \u201cI asked her to go in your closet and get me one of your zippered hoodies. I\u2019m freezing.\u201d</p><p>My closet? Oh, hell. I rush to my room and find Nikki searching for a hoodie hanging in my closet. If she sees the Glock ...</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d I say, standing in front of her. I start closing the doors, blocking her from my suit. Is it in the same spot as I left it? Did she find it? What the hell am I gonna say if she asks me about it? I could play dumb, but I\u2019ve never been able to pull that off successfully.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d she says back. \u201cBrittany told me to come in here and get a jacket for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get one,\u201d I say, steering her away from my closet.</p><p>Nikki looks at me, confused. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ve got a gun stashed in my closet. \u201cNothin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure? You look agitated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d I want to bang my head against the wall, because she\u2019s onto me. \u201cI wanted to tell you somethin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Now I\u2019ve got to come up with something on the fly. \u201cI\u2019m fallin\u2019 in love with you,\u201d I blurt out.</p><p>Oh, shit. Did that really come out of my mouth? I\u2019ve never said that to a girl before, and promised myself that I\u2019d never say it if I didn\u2019t mean it.</p><p>The scariest part is that I did.</p><p>34</p><p>Nikki</p><p>After Luis said the L word, I pretended that I heard Brittany calling my name and practically ran out of his room. I ignored the fact that he said it, and he hasn\u2019t brought it up again.</p><p>On Wednesday, I decide to go to work with him because we kind of need to talk about Sunday. I don\u2019t want to make a big deal about it, but I don\u2019t want to throw around the L word like Marco and I did.</p><p>Luis now works for his cousin. Enrique\u2019s Auto Body is located on the south side of Fairfield, on the corner of Washington Street and Main Street. It\u2019s on an intersection where gang members used to hang out. This particular part of Fairfield was famous for weekly drive-by shootings when I was in grade school. Even though there was a front-page article in the local newspaper a while back about the absence of gang activity in recent years, I get an eerie feeling just being here.</p><p>\u201cThis is it,\u201d Luis says when we pull up to one of the three parking spaces out front.</p><p>My eyes zero in on the old, random bullet hole marks on the side of the building as Luis leads me inside.</p><p>A guy with tattoos running up and down his arms is bent over a car\u2019s engine. He\u2019s wearing a dirty T-shirt and pants that need a good washing. \u201cHey, ese,\u201d the guy says.</p><p>Luis motions to me. \u201cThis is Nikki.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEncantado de conocerte, Nikki. Soy Enrique, el primo de Luis.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t speak Spanish, Enrique,\u201d Luis tells him.</p><p>Enrique laughs. \u201cSorry. You look Mexican.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot all Mexicans speak Spanish,\u201d I counter.</p><p>\u201cAll the Mexicans I know do,\u201d he says. \u201cHell, a majority of Mexicans I know don\u2019t even speak English.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy dad thought it was more important to perfect his English. We don\u2019t speak Spanish at home.\u201d</p><p>Enrique shakes his head, as if my dad\u2019s theory doesn\u2019t sit well with him. \u201cTo each his own.\u201d</p><p>Luis walks over and looks under the hood of the car Enrique was just working on. \u201cGot a leaky gasket?\u201d he asks Enrique.</p><p>\u201cS\u00ed. It needs a tune-up and\u2014\u201d</p><p>Enrique freezes when a girl walks in the shop. She looks like she\u2019s in her twenties, and she obviously knows Luis, because she runs up and gives him a big hug the second she sees him.</p><p>\u201cYou look like a man, Luis,\u201d she says, then rubs the stubble on his face. \u201cThe last time I saw you, this was peach fuzz.\u201d</p><p>Luis brushes her hand away. \u201cThanks for embarrassin\u2019 me in front of mi novia, Isa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlex didn\u2019t tell me you had a girlfriend,\u201d she says. She looks surprised to see me standing a few feet away from him. \u201cOh, I didn\u2019t see you there. I\u2019m Isabel, an old friend of Luis\u2019s brother.\u201d</p><p>I smile back. \u201cNice to meet you.\u201d</p><p>Enrique, who\u2019s been silent since Isa walked in, wipes his hands on his pants. I see him swallowing a few times, as if he\u2019s nervous. \u201cHi, Isa,\u201d he says with a big grin on his face. \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re here. Really. I hardly ever see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been busy working,\u201d she tells him.</p><p>\u201cI know. I wish you came by more.\u201d</p><p>Isa bites her lip nervously. \u201cMy car has been revving when I press on the gas, as if it doesn\u2019t want to go. I thought you could check it out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d Enrique says enthusiastically. \u201cGive me your keys. I\u2019ll take a look at it right now. Luis, head out to the back lot. I lined up cars that need oil changes.\u201d</p><p>Luis tells me to wait for him while he changes into his work coveralls. I chat with Isabel for a few minutes, until Luis comes back.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s definitely a fashion statement,\u201d I joke, taking in his oversized blue coveralls covering him from neck to ankle.</p><p>He points his thumb toward the back room. \u201cYou want to wear one? If you like \u2019em so much, I\u2019ve got a spare in the back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks.\u201d</p><p>He pulls a toolbox off one of the shelves and motions for me to follow him. The sun is shining bright in the sky, and today it\u2019s warm, although with the fall Chicago weather, you never know what each day will be like. I sit on the ground in front of the car Luis is working on and lift my face to the sun.</p><p>\u201cIs Enrique in a gang?\u201d I ask so only he can hear. \u201cI saw his tattoos.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s an OG\u2014an Original Gangster ... not too active anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d</p><p>He shrugs. \u201cIt means he\u2019s an old-timer, not a foot soldier. OGs like Enrique only get called on when there\u2019s somethin\u2019 big goin\u2019 down. He stays pretty much to himself, but ... you know ... loyalty runs deep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe likes Isabel,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d He sits on one of those rolling dollies and pulls out tools from the toolbox. \u201cBut he said she\u2019s turned him down every time he asks her out. She\u2019s kind of hopelessly pining for the guy she was in love with in high school.\u201d</p><p>A pang of regret that I spent so much time hopelessly mourning my doomed relationship with Marco settles inside me. It was a waste, and I can never get that time back. \u201cWas it a bad breakup?\u201d</p><p>He stills. \u201cThey didn\u2019t actually break up. He died.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s so awful.\u201d</p><p>Luis doesn\u2019t look at me. \u201cHe was Alex\u2019s best friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did he die?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe got shot.\u201d</p><p>Questions start swirling through my head. \u201cBy a rival gang?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. By his own gang.\u201d He looks sad as he sits on the wooden dolly and stares at the ground.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t get it, Luis. Why would someone even join a gang?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome people don\u2019t have a choice,\u201d he says before lying down on the dolly and rolling his upper body under the car.</p><p>I tap his leg.</p><p>He slides back out and looks up at me.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s always a choice. You didn\u2019t join a gang even though your brothers did.\u201d I lean down and kiss him. \u201cYou didn\u2019t take the easy way out. I love you for that.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He raises an eyebrow when the L word escapes from my lips.</p><p>Oops. That was not supposed to happen.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean love as in the \u2018I love you\u2019 kind of way,\u201d I\u2019m quick to point out, then slap my hand over my face to hide my embarrassment.</p><p>He sits up and gently nudges my hand down. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, mi chava,\u201d he says, then winks at me. \u201cI know what you meant. Listen, you don\u2019t know what my brothers went through. They did what they needed to do. Don\u2019t judge them. You don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to be us ... to be poor and live in the middle of a street war. You never had to live with drive-bys and watchin\u2019 your best friend die in your arms. It sucks.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, I can\u2019t imagine what it\u2019s like. I\u2019m just glad you\u2019re not a part of it.\u201d</p><p>He nods, then spends the rest of the time working while I watch.</p><p>\u201cCan I help you?\u201d I ask. \u201cI feel bad just sitting here while you\u2019re working.\u201d</p><p>His hand appears from under one of the cars. \u201cHand me the oil filter wrench.\u201d</p><p>I look at the tools laid out. Umm ... they all look the same to me. I look back at his waiting hand. \u201cYou stumped me.\u201d</p> <p>I hear him laugh. \u201cSorry. It\u2019s the thing that looks like a claw with red rubber handles.\u201d</p><p>Considering there\u2019s only one thing with red rubber handles, I have a pretty good idea which one it is. I pick it up and place it in his waiting hand.</p><p>When he\u2019s finished, he slides back out. \u201cYou remind me of my sister-in-law. She knows shit about cars, except how to put the key in the ignition.\u201d</p><p>I raise my hand. \u201cI know how to do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease tell me your dad at least taught you how to change a tire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have to know how to change a tire.\u201d I reach into my purse and pull out the handy card I always carry with me for those types of emergencies. \u201cMy dad got me a Triple-A membership for that.\u201d</p> <p>He rolls his eyes. \u201cYou should know how to change a tire. Remind me to teach you one day.\u201d</p><p>We spend the rest of the time talking. It\u2019s scary. The more I know about Luis, the more I like him. We\u2019re so totally different, but I get him. We never run out of stuff to talk about, and even when there\u2019s a lull in the conversation it\u2019s not awkward.</p><p>\u201cWould you ever consider applyin\u2019 to Purdue?\u201d he asks me when he\u2019s underneath the fourth car in line for an oil change.</p><p>He already told me that\u2019s his first choice of schools. \u201cI don\u2019t know. It wasn\u2019t on my top ten list. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought maybe, you know, if you and I were still ...\u201d His voice drops off. \u201cForget it, Nik. I think I\u2019ve breathed in too many oil fumes.\u201d</p><p>If we\u2019re still together by the end of the year, it would be great if we could go to the same college. I feel so close to Luis right now, and we\u2019re growing closer every day. I have to remind myself not to get sucked in.</p><p>I need to tell him how I feel.</p><p>I tap on his knee. \u201cI think we\u2019re getting too serious.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re a pessimist,\u201d he says, rolling out from under the car again. \u201cHave some faith.\u201d He pulls me down to him and caresses my back. I can feel the warmth of his hands penetrate through my shirt. \u201cI have dirty hands,\u201d he says. \u201cYour shirt is probably ruined.\u201d</p><p>The sound of footsteps coming toward us makes us part.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up, man,\u201d Marco says. He\u2019s standing with a huge scary-looking guy.</p><p>I clutch Luis\u2019s bicep tightly.</p><p>\u201cYou gonna introduce me to your friend?\u201d the scary guys asks.</p><p>I can feel Luis\u2019s bicep flex. \u201cNikki, this is Chuy. He\u2019s a buddy of mine.\u201d</p><p>Chuy puts his cigar in the side of his mouth and stares at me long and hard. It makes me feel like he\u2019s assessing my value. \u201cYou go to Fairfield High?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never seen you around before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe lives on the other side of town,\u201d Marco chimes in. \u201cRight, Nik?\u201d</p><p>I nod.</p><p>\u201cListen, guys,\u201d Luis says. I sense that he\u2019s deliberately taking the focus off of me. \u201cIf you\u2019re lookin\u2019 for Enrique, last I saw he was in the garage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not lookin\u2019 for Enrique,\u201d Chuy says. \u201cI was lookin\u2019 for you, Fuentes. I\u2019ve got a task for you.\u201d</p><p>I feel my heart stop beating as I realize what\u2019s happening.</p><p>Luis has been recruited into the LB.</p><p>35</p><p>Luis</p><p>Nikki\u2019s shocked face when Chuy said he was looking for me says she knows what Chuy\u2019s visit is all about. She picks up her backpack and purse off the ground. \u201cI need to go home. Now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you in a hurry for?\u201d Chuy asks. \u201cYou have a problem with me talkin\u2019 with your boyfriend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, she doesn\u2019t. Let\u2019s talk inside,\u201d I tell him. Damn. The last thing I want is Nikki to start asking questions again.</p><p>Chuy takes his time as he disappears into the shop. Marco falls in line behind him.</p><p>I turn to Nikki. \u201cI\u2019ll be right back,\u201d I tell her. \u201cIt\u2019s not what you think.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s looking at me as if I\u2019m a stranger, not her boyfriend. \u201cI want to go home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take you in a minute. Just ... stay here,\u201d I say. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>I walk inside, anxious to get rid of Chuy and Marco. \u201cWhere did Chuy go?\u201d I ask Enrique. Isa is still here, talking to him as he works on her car.</p><p>\u201cIn my office,\u201d Enrique says. He can\u2019t say anything against Chuy because of his unwavering loyalty and honor he pledged to the Latino Blood a long time ago.</p><p>Chuy is sitting at Enrique\u2019s desk, like it\u2019s his own. Marco is standing next to him like a bodyguard.</p><p>I close the door just in case Nikki decides she wants to listen in on our conversation. \u201cAll right, what\u2019s goin\u2019 down?\u201d</p><p>Chuy taps his ash right on Enrique\u2019s desk. \u201cThis guy owes me five Gs. I need you and Marco to collect it. Tonight.\u201d</p><p>He reaches into his back pocket and pulls out a piece of paper. I scan the address. Augusta Lane. \u201cThat\u2019s deep in Fremont 5 territory,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>All I can think about is the look of betrayal on Nikki\u2019s face as I left her by the car outside. \u201cI can\u2019t go into F5 territory without gettin\u2019 my head blown off,\u201d I blurt out.</p><p>\u201cYes, you can. And yes, you will.\u201d He gestures to the door. \u201cThat honey of yours out there looks real nice. I could use a hot chick like that to sell for me over at DePaul. The college boys love to buy from pretty girls. Ain\u2019t that right, Marco?\u201d</p><p>Marco nods. \u201cThat\u2019s right. Mariana\u2019s makin\u2019 a killin\u2019 over there.\u201d</p><p>This is bullshit. \u201cNikki\u2019s off limits,\u201d I say, loud and clear so there\u2019s no mistaking that she\u2019s never to be thought of as an asset to the LB. I\u2019ll be damned if I drag Nikki into the LB.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s time I let you in on a little secret,\u201d Chuy says, sitting up now. \u201cThere\u2019s a safety-deposit box at Chicago Community Bank with your name on it. Once you turn eighteen, you have access to it. I\u2019ve got the key.\u201d He pulls out a shiny silver key from his pocket and slides it over to me. \u201cAfter your birthday you\u2019re gonna get me whatever\u2019s in that box. You come back from the F5 tonight and show me that you can handle the heat. Loyalty, Luis. You have to earn it, then you reap the benefits.\u201d</p><p>I pick up the key and put it in my back pocket. \u201cWho put it in my name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not important. What\u2019s important is you provin\u2019 your loyalty.\u201d He lets out a stream of smoke. \u201cYou do this, and you\u2019ll see more money than you ever dreamed of, kid.\u201d</p><p>Marco follows Chuy out of the office. I step in front of him before he reaches the door. \u201cWhat do you have to do with this, Marco?\u201d I ask him.</p><p>\u201cI just follow rules.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what you want to be, a follower?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got no other choice, and neither do you. This is big, Luis. I know it. Chuy knows it. It\u2019s about time you get with the program.\u201d He pushes past me. \u201cThe sooner you break it off with Nikki, the better. She\u2019ll just complicate things. I\u2019ll meet you at the warehouse in an hour.\u201d</p><p>After he leaves, I scan the piece of paper with the address on it once more. My nerves are about to snap.</p><p>Nikki is waiting for me in the garage, talking to Isa. I don\u2019t want to lie to her any more than I already have, but I don\u2019t want to risk losing her.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d I say as I walk up to her.</p><p>\u201cTake me home, Luis,\u201d she orders. \u201cI should have known not to trust you.\u201d</p><p>36</p><p>Nikki</p><p>Trust. He begged for my trust, when all along he was affiliating himself with the Latino Blood ... with Marco. My heart isn\u2019t melting. It\u2019s breaking.</p><p>I storm outside and straddle the back of his motorcycle.</p><p>\u201cLet me explain,\u201d Luis says. I shake my head, unwilling to listen. My suspicions were right all along. \u201cIt\u2019s not what you think.\u201d</p><p>Love. Is it just a word boys use to manipulate girls?</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to listen to anything you have to say,\u201d I tell him. \u201cIf you won\u2019t take me home, I\u2019ll walk.\u201d</p><p>I start to get off the bike. He curses under his breath, then says, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to walk. I\u2019ll take you home.\u201d</p><p>I get on the bike again and grab the back instead of holding on to him. If I touch him, I could lose my nerve and let him explain away why everything points to him being a Latino Blood. I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll believe him, because I want to believe him. It\u2019s not what you think, he\u2019d said.</p><p>He pulls up to my driveway. \u201cNik,\u201d he says as I hop off and head for the door. \u201cNik!\u201d</p><p>I stop, but don\u2019t turn around.</p><p>\u201cYou come from this rich family and live in this rich neighborhood. I don\u2019t. Guys like Marco and Chuy ... they\u2019re my people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m your people, too,\u201d I murmur softly.</p><p>\u201cNot in the same way.\u201d I feel his hands on my shoulders. \u201cI\u2019m not a Latino Blood, Nikki.\u201d He turns me around and holds out his arms. \u201cSee, I\u2019m not marked. I\u2019m not gonna say I\u2019m not hangin\u2019 with the Blood, but I\u2019m not one of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you hanging with them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s like me tellin\u2019 you not to hang with Kendall.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s right, even if I don\u2019t want him to be. The Latino Blood has a presence on the south side of Fairfield where he lives.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, Luis,\u201d I say, stepping away from him so I can think clearly. \u201cI have a feeling you\u2019re not telling me the whole truth. I need you, and I\u2019m afraid you\u2019re already a Blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just hangin\u2019 with them, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been told that before. By Marco. We all know how that turned out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNikki, I\u2019m not Marco. I\u2019m not in the Blood. And I\u2019m not gonna leave you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I look into his eyes and all I see is sincerity. No deceit. \u201cYou better not be selling drugs, or we\u2019re through.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t sell drugs,\u201d he says. \u201cI promise.\u201d</p><p>37</p><p>Luis</p> <p>Boxcar Alley is in the crappiest neighborhood in the western suburbs of Chicago. The houses are set behind the backdrop of a boxcar graveyard, ripe for dirty drug deals and homeless crackheads.</p><p>Without time to spare, I take the gun from my closet and drive back to Enrique\u2019s. He\u2019ll give me advice without blabbing to the rest of my family. He\u2019s kept to the Latino Blood\u2019s Code of Silence even when other guys blew it off.</p><p>I told Nikki I wouldn\u2019t do drug deals. I hate lying to her. If doing drug deals are a way to gain Chuy\u2019s trust and protect my family, what choice do I have? I don\u2019t want to do Chuy\u2019s dirty work any more than she wants me to, but I have to. I was being honest when I said I wasn\u2019t a Latino Blood. While Chuy might consider me one, I\u2019m not. I\u2019m just playing his game so I can find out what the LB has planned. I\u2019ve got to be strategic or this isn\u2019t gonna work.</p><p>Enrique looks at me from across his desk. \u201cDamn, cuz. Boxcar Alley\u2019s a rough place to be. That\u2019s enemy territory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarco\u2019s goin\u2019 with me,\u201d I tell him. \u201cFor backup.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWant me to go with you? Problem is they know me, and if a couple of Fremont 5 OGs catch sight of me, it\u2019s gonna get rough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need them retaliatin\u2019 against this place, or you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right. You just watch your back at all times, Luis. Take my Mustang. At least you\u2019ll have a chance to get away if the Fremont 5 pendejos start trouble. Most of their young bucks got shitty aim.\u201d He pats the back of my shirt. \u201cYou strapped?\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cYou and I both know I ain\u2019t gonna use it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t accidentally shoot yourself.\u201d He looks me straight in the eye and says, \u201cIf it\u2019s you or them, let it be them.\u201d</p><p>I meet Marco at the warehouse. We speed all the way to Boxcar Alley, through towns that are worse off than mine. I slipped on a black hoodie and sunglasses, so hopefully nobody will notice that I don\u2019t belong in this \u2019hood.</p> <p>Marco\u2019s obviously been here before, because after we park he says to follow him. We pass a liquor store with a drunk out front talking to himself. Guys walking down the street heading toward us are definitely out looking for some action or a fight. We duck into a drugstore and stay out of their line of vision until they pass. I\u2019m confident we could make a good showing in a fight against three or four guys, but when it comes to ten against two, I wouldn\u2019t bet on us.</p><p>We weave through the streets behind the boxcars. I only lift my head when I have to. Marco struts right up to the house as if he collects in F5 territory every day.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you want to check the place out first?\u201d I ask him. \u201cOr have a plan?\u201d</p><p>Marco waves his hand, dismissing my concern. \u201cNah, it\u2019s cool.\u201d</p><p>A guy answers the door. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d he asks roughly.</p><p>\u201cMoney. And if you don\u2019t give it to us, today will be your biggest fuckin\u2019 nightmare,\u201d Marco barks through gritted teeth. His eyes are open wide, like he\u2019s one crazy motherfucker. I think it\u2019s just an act until Marco pulls out a gun and points it right at the guy\u2019s head. \u201cGive up five Gs or get your head blown off. Which is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYo, Marco,\u201d I say. \u201cCool it, would ya?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s cool. Stay out here and keep watch. Don\u2019t let anyone in the house.\u201d</p> <p>The guy holds his hands up and backs into the house as Marco walks inside. I don\u2019t know what the hell to do. Marco is obviously on a power trip. Shit. If he starts shootin\u2019 people ... I start thinking of my life behind bars.</p><p>This wasn\u2019t supposed to be how it went down. I was supposed to come back to Fairfield, graduate, go to college, then apply to NASA\u2019s space program\u2014the chain of events on the timeline of my life. I had every aspect of my life perfectly planned out.</p><p>As it looks now, the only place I deserve to go is jail. I look up at the darkened sky. I\u2019m about to lose everything ... including Nikki.</p><p>A few minutes later, when I\u2019m about to knock on the door and tell Marco I\u2019m done with Chuy\u2019s bullshit orders, he steps out.</p><p>\u201cDid you get the cash?\u201d I ask him.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo it\u2019s all cool?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUmm ... I think we should bounce, like fast.\u201d</p><p>We hurry through the maze that\u2019s Boxcar Alley. I look back and realize a bunch of guys are on our tail. They\u2019re waving guns, and we\u2019re trying to lose them in the overcrowded graveyard of old railroad cars.</p><p>It\u2019s not working.</p><p>We duck behind one of the boxcars. Marco peeks his head out, and a bullet flies past his head.</p><p>\u201cWe need to get out of here. We\u2019re screwed if we stay in one place,\u201d he says.</p><p>I\u2019ve never been in a shootout, but I\u2019ve witnessed them. I pull out my gun, but keep it at my side, partially hidden. Marco does the same.</p><p>\u201cOur car is right there. See it?\u201d I say, my adrenaline pumping at full speed.</p><p>He nods.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re gonna run toward it, and drive away without lookin\u2019 back,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>\u201cGot it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf they shoot, start unloadin\u2019 at the rail cars to scare \u2019em. Hopefully they\u2019ll take cover at least until we can get to the car.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s no time to strategize a plan B, because the guys are about to surround us. If we don\u2019t move now, we\u2019re fucked.</p><p>\u201cNow!\u201d I yell, and we both book it toward Enrique\u2019s Mustang.</p><p>My pulse races as a shot rings out. Then another. And another. I jump into the car and look over at Marco. He sticks his gun out of the front window and unloads the chamber as I start the car.</p><p>I screech away, knowing that we barely made it out alive.</p><p>\u201cPut the guns in the glove compartment,\u201d I tell him, handing mine over to him. I check the rearview mirror for cops, but don\u2019t see any.</p><p>The sound of our heavy breathing fills the car.</p><p>\u201cThat was close,\u201d Marco says, leaning his head back on the seat. A second later he says, \u201cHoly shit. Luis?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDude, you got shot.\u201d</p><p>I look over at my bicep. Blood is rushing down my arm and staining the seat of the car, so I strip my hoodie off and tell Marco to tie the sleeve around my arm. \u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I tell him. \u201cIt\u2019s a scratch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cScratches don\u2019t gush blood, Luis. You sure you\u2019re okay?\u201d</p><p>I can just imagine mi'am\u00e1\u2019s face when she sees I\u2019m bleeding. \u201cI\u2019ll go to Enrique\u2019s and spend the night. He\u2019ll know what to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lucky you made it out alive,\u201d Enrique says when I show up to his place a half hour later. \u201cYour arm ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI kinda ran into a Fremont 5 bullet,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>He nods. \u201cYour ma is gonna shit twice, then she\u2019s gonna kill you. Chuy\u2019s one sonofabitch, sendin\u2019 you kids into F5 territory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me about it.\u201d</p><p>I take a shower in Enrique\u2019s apartment above the garage. The bullet exited but left a two-inch gash, and now that I\u2019m sitting down looking at the fleshy wound, it hurts like a bitch. It won\u2019t be hard to hide, even with a bandage. I\u2019ll just wear a hoodie and long-sleeve shirts until it heals.</p><p>\u201cWhere did Marco run off to?\u201d Enrique asks me after he closes up the garage and meets me in the apartment.</p><p>\u201cThe warehouse.\u201d I put on a shirt Enrique lends me after he calls mi'am\u00e1 and tells her I\u2019ll be bunking at his place tonight. \u201cWhat do you know about me bein\u2019 blessed in?\u201d I ask my cousin as he takes a beer out of his fridge.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know anythin\u2019 about that,\u201d he says as he gives me an intense stare. \u201cAnd if I did, I probably wouldn\u2019t be able to tell ya. \u00bfComprende?\u201d</p><p>He knows something. I nod. It\u2019s no use trying to get any info out of him. If he was sworn to secrecy, he\u2019ll go to the grave with it.</p><p>The Latino Blood Code of Silence.</p><p>It\u2019s one code I haven\u2019t broken yet, but intend to crack sooner rather than later.</p><p>38</p><p>Nikki</p><p>Two weeks after Luis promises me that he\u2019s not in the LB, it\u2019s his eighteenth birthday. I know my parents are at some dinner party in the city, and my brother is at some gaming tournament in Wisconsin, so I invite Luis over for a private birthday dinner.</p><p>I\u2019m not a chef, but I do know how to follow a recipe. I got a Mexican cookbook from the bookstore. We don\u2019t have authentic Mexican food often, and most of the recipes are foreign to me. Other than breakfast, my parents usually order takeout or eat at Brickstone. If Mom does cook, it\u2019s pretty much a simple pasta dish or something from the meat market specially prepackaged and marinated so all we have to do is throw the stuff in the oven.</p><p>Luis arrives at six, right on time, with a bunch of yellow daffodils in his hand. The stems are wrapped together with a big yellow ribbon. \u201cHey,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d I say back.</p><p>He scans my skinny black dress that hugs every one of my curves. \u201cDamn, Nik. You look amazin\u2019.\u201d He looks down at his jeans and cringes. \u201cSorry I didn\u2019t get more dressed up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need you dressed up. You look like a stud just the way you are.\u201d I take the flowers. \u201cYou didn\u2019t have to bring me flowers. It\u2019s your birthday, not mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted to bring you somethin\u2019,\u201d he says. When I put the flowers to my nose to smell them, Luis looks nervous. \u201cI didn\u2019t know if you\u2019d like \u2019em. Carlos told me to bring you red roses, but I thought you\u2019d like yellow. They remind me of you. They brighten a room ... just like you.\u201d</p><p>I reach out and touch the stubble on his face, wondering how I ever thought he was the least bit similar to Marco. His tender gaze pierces my heart. \u201cI love them. Come on in. I made you dinner,\u201d I say proudly.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d he asks as his eyes settle on the wrapped box I set on the table.</p><p>\u201cYour birthday present.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t have to get me anythin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I wanted to. Go on, open it.\u201d When he does, I hold my breath.</p><p>He pulls out what looks like a twisted black iron rock, but I know it\u2019s not just a rock. He rolls it around in his hand, studying it. Does he know what it is? Hopefully he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s a cheap paperweight.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a meteorite,\u201d I explain quickly. \u201cFrom Argentina. Inside the box are the authentication papers, explaining where and how it was found.\u201d</p><p>He looks at me over the meteorite with a stunned expression on his face. \u201cI know what it is. I\u2019ve seen them in museums. And in books. But I\u2019ve never held one. Or owned one.\u201d He examines all sides in awe, feeling each curve and crevice with his fingertips. \u201cI can\u2019t believe this was in space. It\u2019s so cool ... surreal.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s yours,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what to say. It must\u2019ve cost you a fortune. I just ... wow. I\u2019d beg you to return it and get your money back, but I don\u2019t want to part with it.\u201d</p><p>I kiss him on his cheek. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. I didn\u2019t need that college fund, anyway.\u201d He cocks an eyebrow, and I smile mischievously. \u201cI\u2019m just kidding. I had money saved up from babysitting and birthdays.\u201d With my forefinger, I run a path down the front of his shirt. \u201cBesides, you\u2019re worth it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s debatable, mi chava.\u201d He stills my hand. \u201cIt\u2019s the coolest gift anyone\u2019s ever given me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGood. Mission accomplished.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d He puts the meteorite gently back in the box and kisses me passionately until I\u2019m wanting more and my insides are melting. I\u2019m breathless and never want to stop. Knowing that we\u2019re alone, and I have another gift planned for him, makes me want to skip dinner altogether. \u201cThanks for the gift,\u201d he says against my lips.</p><p>\u201cMy pleasure.\u201d Flustered now, I step away from him and gesture to the dining room, where everything is set up. \u201cI made an authentic Mexican meal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRecipes passed down from your abuelita?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really. Try a cookbook I bought yesterday at the mall.\u201d</p> <p>He laughs. \u201cNext time you want to make an authentic Mexican meal, call me first. Mi'am\u00e1 taught me and my brothers to cook when we were kids.\u201d</p><p>After serving him a plate of chicken enchiladas and guacamole, I realized that I should have followed the recipe and mixed the avocado by hand instead of blending it in a mixer. It was like soup, and did not taste good at all. I made a flan for dessert, but it fell into chunky gelatinous pieces as I served it to him.</p><p>\u201cYou did an awesome job,\u201d he says as he fishes for the slippery flan eluding his spoon.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lying. It sucked. Face reality, Luis. I should have ordered takeout. If you were Mrs. Peterson, you\u2019d give me a D minus on this meal.\u201d</p><p>He laughs. \u201cAn A plus for effort. The tortilla chips were awesome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because I bought them ready-made at the Mexican grocery in Wheeling,\u201d I say.</p> <p>When we\u2019re done, he helps me clear the table and put the dishes in the dishwasher. Afterward, I see him leaning against the kitchen counter watching me. \u201cYou have a plan for the rest of the night, or are we gonna wing it?\u201d</p><p>I take his hand and weave his fingers through mine. \u201cI have another birthday present for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>I lean close to his ear and whisper, \u201cMe.\u201d He swallows, hard. I watch as the muscle in his jaw twitches. \u201cWant to go upstairs ... to my bedroom?\u201d</p><p>He nods slowly. \u201cI didn\u2019t think you could top that meteorite gift, but you just did.\u201d</p><p>I take his hand and lead him to my room. My heart is racing the entire time, because I\u2019ve prepared myself for this. I tell myself it\u2019s okay, because I want this as much as Luis. I\u2019m in control here. I just have to keep myself in check and not let my emotions run wild.</p><p>Luis walks around my room, studying the pictures on my wall. Most of them are of me and my friends. Some are dogs from the shelter. He stops when his eyes focus on the one of me and him at Alex and Brittany\u2019s wedding two summers ago. We both had no clue the photographer had caught the moment on camera.</p><p>He points to it. \u201cHow did you get this?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBrittany brought it over when she had dinner at my house one night.\u201d</p><p>He points to the expression on my face. \u201cYou were so pissed. Look at me, with that stupid-ass cocky grin. I thought I was the shit back then.\u201d He shakes his head, then scans the rest of the pictures.</p><p>While his back is turned to me, I reach around and slowly unzip my dress. \u201cYou are the shit, Luis,\u201d I say in a teasing voice.</p><p>\u201cNah, I\u2019m\u2014\u201d</p><p>He stops midsentence as he looks at me and it registers that I\u2019m unzipping my dress. My mouth is dry as I slide the straps down my shoulders slowly until the material falls to the floor in a pool at my feet.</p><p>His eyes never leave me. Mine never leave him.</p><p>\u201cWhat were you saying?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cI forgot.\u201d His gaze travels down the length of my body. I dressed in pink lace panties and a matching bra, prepared for us to be together tonight. \u201cMi chava ...\u201d He takes a step toward me. \u201cI didn\u2019t think you could look more beautiful than when you opened the door tonight. But you do.\u201d</p><p>I hold my breath in anticipation and longing as his fingers skim lightly over my shoulders before gently slipping my bra straps aside.</p><p>This is okay, I tell myself. I can enjoy this and stay as emotionally detached as I want. His lips replace his fingers. He kisses one shoulder, then brushes his warm lips across my neck and kisses the other one.</p><p>I grab on to him for support because his warm breath brushing over my skin makes me dizzy. I want him here with me, I want him close ... but this is sex. It has to be just sex.</p><p>I grab him over his pants, then unzip his jeans.</p><p>\u201cEasy, girl,\u201d he says, amused.</p><p>He puts an arm around me, holding me steady, as he bends down to kiss me. It\u2019s not just any kiss. His lips move slowly over mine, brushing against them before his tongue reaches out. I feel his hot breath mingle with mine as our tongues glide over each other\u2019s in a slow rhythm that makes my skin hot and sweaty. His hands move slowly up and down the curve of my back in the same rhythm as our kiss.</p><p>Truth is, being with Luis makes me want to ditch all of my self-awareness and give in to every temptation.</p><p>He pulls his shirt over his head, then tosses it aside. He\u2019s got a big scab on his arm. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d I ask, tracing around it.</p><p>\u201cJust got a cut workin\u2019 at the garage,\u201d he says, dismissing it.</p><p>\u201cWhat were you doing?\u201d</p><p>He hesitates long enough for me to question whether he\u2019s about to tell me the truth.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not important.\u201d He kisses me again, trying to make me forget about his mystery wound. It works for the moment.</p><p>We strip naked and move to the bed. Instead of jumping each other\u2019s bones, he takes his sweet time running his hands over every inch of my body as if he\u2019s going to memorize it for a painting later.</p><p>I follow his lead, skimming my palm across his hot skin in a slow, torturous pattern until he\u2019s panting. I lean over him and use my lips and tongue, exploring every inch. He grabs the sheets so hard his knuckles turn white. It makes me feel like I have the power, not the other way around.</p><p>Until it\u2019s his turn to explore. I try to stay calm. But it\u2019s hard. I brace myself for it to happen any minute now. He gently pushes the hair out of my face as he gazes into my eyes. \u201cI\u2019m livin\u2019 my fantasy,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cWhat fantasy is that?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cBein\u2019 alone with the girl I love. I love you, Nikki. You know that, right?\u201d</p><p>Umm ... \u201cYes. Me too,\u201d I say dumbly, trying to block the rush of emotions threatening to surface.</p><p>His thumb traces my lips and I swear his eyes are getting all glassy. \u201cI\u2019ve never felt this way about another girl before,\u201d he whispers.</p><p>No.</p><p>I don\u2019t want to keep hearing words of love.</p><p>Luis is dangerous and has the ability to suck me in if I let him. I can\u2019t let that happen. He\u2019s got secrets. I\u2019ve got secrets. We can\u2019t share them, but we can share our bodies.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s have sex,\u201d I blurt out. I reach over and open my side-table drawer. I pull out a condom from the box I bought over the weekend and hand it to him. \u201cHere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLo \u00fanico que quiero es hacerte el amor, mi vida.\u201d I look at him with a blank stare. I think he forgot that Spanish came out of his mouth automatically. \u201cI want to make love to you, Nikki. More than anythin\u2019. But you said\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cForget what I said. Let\u2019s do it.\u201d He leans in to kiss me again, but I put a hand on his chest and nudge him away. \u201cPut the condom on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, now.\u201d</p><p>He seems a little frustrated that I\u2019m rushing this, but he rips open the package and puts on the condom. If we do this fast, and I\u2019m able to keep myself free of emotion, it\u2019ll be fine. Tonight will wipe the bad memories of me and Marco away.</p><p>He\u2019s poised above me now, his hands braced on either side of my head. I gaze up at his light brown skin slick against mine. \u201cCome on,\u201d I say, urging him along.</p><p>His lips are inches away from mine. \u201cI got to be honest, Nik. This isn\u2019t how I imagined it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. Let\u2019s just do it. Hurry up.\u201d</p><p>I squeeze my eyes shut. I can\u2019t look at him. Not now, when I\u2019m determined to stay emotionless. He hesitates, then swears under his breath and pushes himself off me.</p><p>Cold air rushes under the blanket as he sits on the edge of the bed. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d I ask. \u201cWhy\u2019d you stop?\u201d</p><p>He pulls off the condom and tosses it in the trash. \u201cThis ain\u2019t workin\u2019 for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>He looks back at me, pissed. \u201cShit, Nik, you\u2019re actin\u2019 as though this is a one-night stand between strangers. I\u2019m trying to make love to you and your eyes are shut so damn tight it looked like you were wishin\u2019 I was someone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not ... I wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cForget it.\u201d He grabs his boxers and puts them on. \u201cNext time your boyfriend tells you he loves you, you might want to acknowledge it with more than a yeah, me too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to love me,\u201d I snap.</p><p>\u201cToo late, mi chava.\u201d</p><p>I sit up. \u201cI can\u2019t do the love thing, Luis.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you just want a fuck partner, is that it?\u201d he snaps, then shoves his legs into his pants. \u201cIt would\u2019ve been cool of you to let me know we were just gonna screw so I didn\u2019t make a fool of myself pourin\u2019 out my feelings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t make a fool out of yourself. Don\u2019t be mad. I just don\u2019t want to get hurt again. I won\u2019t repeat what I did with\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarco,\u201d he says, finishing my sentence. \u201cI\u2019m fuckin\u2019 sick and tired of it always comin\u2019 back to you and Marco. You still in love with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not ... I don\u2019t. You have no clue what I went through.\u201d I can\u2019t get the words out.</p><p>\u201cTell me, then. Tell me, so you can finally move on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He grabs his shirt off the floor and looks at me with a grave expression on his face. \u201cDo you love me?\u201d</p><p>I clutch my blanket to my chest and give him the only answer I can. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>39</p><p>Luis</p><p>I want to destroy something, anything. I left Nikki\u2019s house tonight knowing one thing\u2014it\u2019s over. I was an idiot to think she feels the same way about me that I feel about her. I wanted to believe she was holding back because she was scared ... but in reality she was just using me to get over someone else.</p><p>Instead of going home, I drive to the LB warehouse. On the way, I notice a car in the rearview mirror that I\u2019ve seen a couple of times before. Am I being tailed? I speed through busier parts of town and lose them. At the warehouse, Marco is sitting with a bunch of guys. Some are drinking beer, some are smoking dope. It\u2019s the scene mi'am\u00e1 wanted to shelter me from, probably because she knew I\u2019d be drawn to it at some point. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I\u2019ve reached that point.</p><p>\u201cHey, amigo,\u201d Marco says. I can tell by his bloodshot eyes that he\u2019s completely wasted. \u201cI thought you were goin\u2019 out with your novia tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not my novia anymore.\u201d I grab a beer and chug it. It\u2019s cheap stuff, but I\u2019m guessing it\u2019ll do the job.</p><p>\u201cCongratulations. You finally dumped the bitch.\u201d He holds up his own can of beer in a congratulatory salute. \u201cOn to bigger and better.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRight.\u201d I crush the first can in my hand and reach for another. Then another. By the time I\u2019m on my fifth beer, I\u2019m feeling damn good. Like I don\u2019t give a shit about anyone, especially Nikki.</p><p>I need to tell her tonight was a mistake, and it\u2019ll never happen again. I won\u2019t give her the satisfaction of letting her think she hurt me. I pull out my cell and call her.</p><p>\u201cHey, Nik,\u201d I say when she answers. \u201cI\u2019m with Marco.\u201d I put my arm around my homie and say, \u201cWe were just tradin\u2019 stories about you. Ain\u2019t that right, amigo?\u201d</p><p>Marco laughs. I know she can hear him. I\u2019m being a complete pendejo and I\u2019m making this up as I go along, but in my drunken state I don\u2019t have a filter. She might as well have stabbed me in the heart.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m hanging up,\u201d she warns.</p> <p>\u201cNo!\u201d I yell into the receiver. \u201cI need to say one more thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she asks.</p><p>Time to be the asshole she thinks I am.</p><p>I concentrate on not slurring my words, but I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m successful. \u201cI\u2019m done with you.\u201d</p><p>She hangs up on me. My words hurt her. I know I\u2019m gonna regret that call in the morning, but right now I\u2019m flying high and don\u2019t give a rat\u2019s ass.</p><p>I stumble over to the cooler and grab another beer. By the time I finish it, I\u2019m seeing double and I\u2019m completely unable to think ... about anything. I don\u2019t even remember what I said to Nikki, or even if I really called her or if I just thought that I called her.</p> <p>\u201cHey, Luis,\u201d Mariana says, coming up to me. \u201cYou\u2019re wasted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me somethin\u2019 I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there trouble in paradise?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head and hold up the beer can. \u201cThis is my paradise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what will get your mind off of Nikki.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe.\u201d She kisses me, and I\u2019m too weak and too stupid drunk to think about pushing her away. She\u2019s not what I want. She knows it, but she doesn\u2019t care. I could close my eyes and pretend she\u2019s Nikki ... that would really prove I\u2019m an asshole.</p><p>Mariana leads me to a room off to the side. I sit on an old, beaten-up couch and she straddles me, but my body won\u2019t cooperate\u2014as if it knows what it wants and Mariana\u2019s not it. \u201cI\u2019m in love with her,\u201d I say, stopping Mariana before this goes any further.</p> <p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Mariana asks, annoyed.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s my angel.\u201d</p><p>Mariana slides off me and heads for the door. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what you\u2019re missin\u2019, Luis.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, I do. I\u2019ve had one-night stands before ... they\u2019re all the same. With Nikki it matters ... which is why tonight hurts so fucking bad.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d I tell Mariana.</p><p>She doesn\u2019t answer. Instead, she walks out and slams the door behind her.</p><p>In the early morning, I wake up and realize that I fell asleep at the warehouse. Everyone is gone except for the few LBs that call this shithole their home.</p><p>My head is spinning even before I manage to lift myself into a sitting position. I wonder if I look as shitty as I feel. Glancing down at the empty cans of beer beside me makes my stomach churn. I\u2019m gonna puke.</p><p>I stumble outside and hurl until there\u2019s nothin\u2019 left. I\u2019m so weak I can hardly stand.</p><p>\u201cRough night?\u201d Chuy asks, coming up beside me.</p><p>\u201cS\u00ed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI used to get fucked up like that when I was your age. Fun times, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not havin\u2019 fun right now,\u201d I tell him as another wave of nausea hits me.</p><p>He laughs as I puke my guts out again. \u201cYou still got that key I gave you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t had a chance to go to the bank,\u201d I tell him. \u201cBesides, I think I\u2019m bein\u2019 followed.\u201d</p><p>He laughs cynically. \u201cI\u2019m havin\u2019 you followed, Luis. You\u2019re valuable to me, and the Blood.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ve got to watch my back even closer now, dammit.</p><p>Chuy pats my back, hard enough to rattle my sensitive stomach. \u201cAll right, amigo. You get one more week and then I\u2019ve got to put the pressure on. Consider this a warning. Go home,\u201d he orders. \u201cAlex and Carlos are there, but don\u2019t tell them you were here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know where they are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t you realized it by now, Luis?\u201d Chuy says. \u201cI\u2019ve got eyes and ears everywhere. Hell, even when I was in the can I knew your every move. When you were in Colorado, I had my guys track you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you\u2019re ready to know, I\u2019ll tell ya. Now get your sorry ass out of here.\u201d</p><p>I walk through the door of my house, but can\u2019t make it to the bathroom so I run back outside to puke in the bushes. I ignore the stares from my family as I stumble through the house and head straight for my bedroom. Sleep. All I need is sleep. I fall facedown onto my mattress.</p><p>\u201cLuis!\u201d mi'am\u00e1 says from the doorway. She\u2019s pissed, and I\u2019m not in the mood to hear her yell at me. \u201cWhere were you? I\u2019ve been calling you all night, without an answer. What\u2019s the use in having a cell phone if you refuse to answer it for your own mother?\u201d She narrows her eyes at me. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you? Are you on drugs, Luis?\u201d</p><p>Out of the corner of my eye I think I just saw her cross herself. If she starts lighting the memorial candles and begins praying to Pap\u00e1, I\u2019m seriously going to lose it.</p><p>\u201cI was drunk,\u201d I tell her. \u201cAnd now I\u2019m hungover. Answerin\u2019 your call would\u2019ve killed the buzz, so I ignored it.\u201d</p><p>I hear her suck in a shocked breath, then I feel something whack me in the back of my head. Her shoe.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that child abuse?\u201d I ask her.</p><p>\u201cIt would be, if you were a child. You\u2019re eighteen, Luis. You\u2019re a man now. Act like it!\u201d</p><p>She slams the door shut. The sound is like a jackhammer banging against my skull, which I\u2019m sure is exactly what she intended. Mi'am\u00e1 isn\u2019t subtle, that\u2019s for damn sure.</p><p>The room is finally a sanctuary, and I close my eyes. My peace is short-lived, though, because I hear the door creak as someone opens it.</p><p>\u201cYou gonna hit me with your other shoe?\u201d I mumble against the pillow.</p><p>\u201cNah,\u201d Alex\u2019s voice echoes through my head. \u201cMi'am\u00e1 told Carlos and me to come in here to make sure you\u2019re not dead, which is pretty much what she thought when you didn\u2019t answer your cell last night.\u201d</p><p>Alex and Carlos\u2014the tag team from hell. They\u2019re the last people I need shit from right now. If they decide to trail me, too, I\u2019ll have an entire entourage.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen sit up and talk to us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, in that case I\u2019m not fine. Go away.\u201d I moan. \u201cUnless you want me to puke all over you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened with you and Nikki last night?\u201d Alex asks.</p><p>\u201cNada. We\u2019re history.\u201d</p><p>Carlos chuckles. \u201cYeah, right. Believe me, I\u2019ve been in the same condition you\u2019re in, bro. Gettin\u2019 shitfaced over a girl isn\u2019t a solution. Talk to her and work it out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not talkin\u2019 about it.\u201d</p><p>I open one eye and see Alex crouching beside the bed. \u201cI\u2019m not lettin\u2019 you fuck up like we did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFace the facts, Alex. I\u2019m already a fuckup, and I don\u2019t intend to change that fact anytime soon.\u201d</p><p>40</p><p>Nikki</p><p>Everything has changed in the blink of an eye. Luis, me ... us. I spent the rest of Saturday night crying in bed, wondering how everything spiraled out of control. Luis\u2019s call in the middle of the night didn\u2019t help. God, how my heart raced when I saw his number come up. I hoped he would tell me that he\u2019d wait for me to open my heart to him, that it didn\u2019t matter how long it took. If he really loved me ... Oh, it doesn\u2019t matter. He said it was over.</p><p>The problem is that the feelings I had for him, and still have for him, are so intense they scare me. I wanted to make love to him, body and soul, but my fear made me pull away. In the end, all I could give him was my body. It wasn\u2019t good enough.</p><p>On Monday I try my hardest to avoid seeing Luis at school, but every time I open my eyes I spot him either at his locker or walking down the hall with friends. He makes no eye contact with me, even in chemistry when we\u2019re facing each other across the lab tables.</p><p>\u201cAre you coming to watch the soccer game with me after school?\u201d Kendall asks me after chemistry on Tuesday.</p><p>\u201cNo. Definitely not,\u201d I tell her.</p><p>She stops and gives me one of her pity looks. \u201cWhy won\u2019t you tell me what happened Saturday night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLuis and I broke up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that part. Want to share why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I\u2019m ready. I\u2019m just not ready now.\u201d</p><p>She sighs. \u201cAll right. I\u2019m here for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re always here for me. It\u2019s time you get another best friend who doesn\u2019t carry around so much baggage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot gonna happen.\u201d She gives me a warm smile. \u201cYou\u2019re my inspiration.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what? A drama queen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Do you realize how many dogs you\u2019ve helped rescue? You\u2019re the girl that doesn\u2019t give up on the underdog.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel like I\u2019m the underdog.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you know never to give up on yourself. You\u2019re stronger than you think you are, Nikki.\u201d</p><p>Every minute of every day I\u2019m tempted to text hey to Luis. Or call him, just to hear his voice.</p><p>On Wednesday, Mariana and Luis are talking at his locker. They sit next to each other at lunch. In chemistry, he makes a joke and she laughs so hard I think her lungs are going to burst.</p><p>On Thursday after school, I\u2019m thankful I\u2019m scheduled to work at the shelter. Being with the dogs will help me get my mind off of Luis.</p><p>I check in at the front desk, then head back to the cages. My heart skips a beat when Granny\u2019s cage is empty and the pink identification card is missing from the slot on her cage door.</p><p>Did she die in the middle of the night, all alone and scared? Or is she so skinny from not eating they had to take her to the vet? I rush over to Sue in complete panic mode.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to Granny?\u201d I ask her.</p><p>\u201cShe was adopted.\u201d The phone rings. \u201cI thought you knew about it,\u201d she says before she answers the call.</p><p>How would I know? I didn\u2019t do the paperwork on her. I open the adoption log book and scan the approved applications. When I read the name Granny on top of the latest application my heart swells with happiness that she finally has a home. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Until I look at the bottom of the page at the name of the person who adopted her. Luis Fuentes.</p><p>I gasp. \u201cHe didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour friend came in right before we closed last night and adopted her,\u201d one of the other volunteers tells me.</p><p>Luis knew I wanted her. How dare he come and snatch her. He took Granny just to spite me. Oh, how could I ever have thought I wanted to be with someone who\u2019d adopt a dog just for revenge?</p> <p>My mind is in a rage as I spend my assigned time cleaning out cages and walking the dogs. After I clock out, I get in my car and race to Luis\u2019s house.</p><p>I knock on the door.</p><p>No answer.</p><p>I pound on the door.</p><p>Still no answer.</p> <p>I put my ear to the door and hear the television, so I know someone\u2019s got to be home.</p><p>I shimmy through the space between the bushes and the front window. I eye Luis sitting on the couch with Granny in his lap, then knock on the glass to get his attention. He looks at me, and I give him the universal sign language for \u201copen the damn door\u201d by pointing to it.</p><p>By the time I shimmy back to the front stoop, he\u2019s opened the door. \u201cI puked in those bushes a few days ago. You might want to be careful where you step.\u201d</p><p>Eww. I\u2019m careful not to step in anything unidentifiable, but since the bushes are in the way, it\u2019s no use. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you stole my dog.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t steal a dog, Nik. How cruel do you think I am?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI meant Granny, and you know it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow can I steal a dog I officially adopted at a shelter?\u201d</p><p>I narrow my eyes at him. \u201cYou knew I wanted her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, so? You know the sayin\u2019 ... you snooze, you lose. You want to hear it in Spanish?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s doing his best to upset me and it\u2019s working. \u201cNo. You didn\u2019t even want a dog.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do now. Granny and I are bondin\u2019.\u201d He crosses his fingers. \u201cWe\u2019re like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis whole adopting thing isn\u2019t really about Granny. This is about us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is no \u2018us\u2019 anymore, remember?\u201d</p><p>His words sting. \u201cSo you steal the one dog at the shelter you know I have a special attachment to just to piss me off and rub it in?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, please. You were smotherin\u2019 the poor thing. I didn\u2019t get her for some retaliation against you. There were a few burglaries in the neighborhood and we need a good watchdog.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s blind, Luis!\u201d I yell. \u201cShe can\u2019t watch anything. I don\u2019t even think she can bark. Granny\u2019s got one foot in the grave.\u201d</p><p>He pretends like my words are an insult to him and his dog. \u201cShh, don\u2019t let her hear you say that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re kidding, right?\u201d</p><p>He shrugs. \u201cListen, the lady at the shelter approved my application. You got a problem with it, talk to the shelter. I don\u2019t give a shit what you think anymore.\u201d</p><p>If I were a cartoon, a big great gust of steam would be coming out of my ears right now. \u201cWhat about Saturday night, Luis? You told me you loved me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that what guys are supposed to say before they screw their girlfriend? I thought it was a prerequisite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t mean that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want me to say, that I want to get back with you just so you could think of another guy while we\u2019re in bed together? No, thanks.\u201d</p><p>Granny waddles to the front door. Luis reaches down and picks her up. Seeing him holding her so gently in his arms shows off the warm and caring side he\u2019s trying to hide from me.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know what I think about, Luis. And don\u2019t tell me you weren\u2019t keeping secrets from me. You were obviously doing something shady for that Chuy guy. I know he wasn\u2019t recruiting you to join the Boy Scouts. I chose to ignore all the warning signs and trust you. You lied to me, didn\u2019t you? You keep more secrets than the Pentagon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI lie to everyone. It\u2019s no big deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a big deal to me.\u201d I point to his arm. \u201cThat didn\u2019t happen in the garage. You were in a knife fight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWrong. Try gunfight.\u201d He puts Granny on the grass so she can waddle around and he holds his hands up. \u201cOkay, fine. You got me. You\u2019re lookin\u2019 at the newest Latino Blood recruit, baby. I\u2019ve been dealin\u2019 drugs and gangbangin\u2019 with Marco behind your back. That\u2019s my secret. What\u2019s yours?\u201d</p><p>I swallow and prepare myself to reveal the truth. It doesn\u2019t matter anymore, so why are tears running down my face? I wish I could hold them back, but I can\u2019t. I\u2019m angry, I\u2019m hurt, I\u2019m sad ... He\u2019s just like Marco. I tried to deny it, but the truth slaps me in the face.</p><p>\u201cI was pregnant with Marco\u2019s baby the day he broke up with me.\u201d Luis steps back, shock written all over his face. \u201cI lost the baby right after we left Alex\u2019s wedding and I almost died. This thing coming between us wasn\u2019t about me and Marco!\u201d I yell, getting riled up now. \u201cIt was about trust. And in the back of my head I knew you were lying to me about the Blood. Don\u2019t blame me for holding back, Luis. I was almost ready to let go and try to trust again. It took me a while, and I wasn\u2019t really good at it, but at least I was trying, which is more than I can say for you. It was you who was holding back all along.\u201d I pull the meteorite out of my purse. \u201cMaybe I couldn\u2019t say it yet, but I tried to show you how much I cared.\u201d Tears stream down my cheeks as I chuck the meteorite into the street.</p><p>I expect him to go running after it, but he doesn\u2019t. His eyes are fixed on me.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d he says softly. He reaches out to me.</p><p>I whack his hand away. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare touch me ever again!\u201d</p><p>41</p><p>Luis</p><p>A week later, as I hop on my motorcycle in the library parking lot after working on my essay for Purdue\u2019s application, a car that I\u2019ve noticed trailing me for the past two weeks stops in front of me and blocks my path.</p><p>A guy steps out of the car. I\u2019ve seen him at the warehouse a couple of times, but I\u2019ve never talked to him. He\u2019s an OG. \u201cChuy wants to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLater,\u201d I tell them.</p><p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t get it.\u201d A big guy steps out of the back. \u201cHe wants to talk to you now.\u201d</p><p>I leave the motorcycle in the parking lot and get in the backseat. I\u2019ve been avoiding this meeting. The key Chuy gave me has been like a weight on my conscience.</p><p>Chuy is sitting in the backseat, waiting for me. We\u2019re driven randomly through town.</p><p>I take the key out of my wallet. \u201cI can\u2019t do it. I thought I could, but I can\u2019t.\u201d The way Nikki looked at me with complete and utter hatred when I tried to console her after she told me she\u2019d been pregnant with Marco\u2019s baby made me realize it was really over for good. She hated Marco, hated the LB, and now she put me in the same category because I\u2019ve betrayed her, just like Marco. The entire week I\u2019ve tried to feel him out to see if he knows about the pregnancy, but he hasn\u2019t taken the bait. Either he doesn\u2019t know about it, or he\u2019s determined to keep it a secret.</p><p>\u201cI know you feel a pull toward the LB,\u201d Chuy says. \u201cBut you don\u2019t know why.\u201d</p><p>I stay silent. Every word he just spoke is the truth. I won\u2019t admit it because I\u2019m ashamed of it.</p><p>\u201cNo need to hide your true feelings. Tu pap\u00e1 wanted you to be in the Blood, Luis. He made sure you were watched over and protected. He brought you to the warehouse a week after you were born, to be blessed in with LB written on your forehead in his own blood ... a full-fledged Latino Blood.\u201d</p><p>No fucking way. \u201cMy father died before I was born,\u201d I say. \u201cAlex told me he was there, he saw our pap\u00e1 get shot ... what you\u2019re sayin\u2019 doesn\u2019t make sense, unless\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour father wasn\u2019t a Fuentes,\u201d Chuy says, interrupting my confusion. He pulls a picture out of his suit pocket and hands it to me. \u201cI was there.\u201d</p><p>I look at the picture of Hector Martinez with a huge grin on his face as he holds a baby in the air like a king presenting his newborn baby to the people. The prince. In the middle of the baby\u2019s forehead, written in blood, are the letters LB\u2014Latino Blood.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s you,\u201d Chuy says. \u201cAnd your pap\u00e1. Your real pap\u00e1.\u201d</p><p>As soon as the words leave Chuy\u2019s mouth, a feeling of dread washes over me. It can\u2019t be true. But there have been signs. I\u2019ve never seen my birth certificate. When Alex was shot Carlos donated blood, but mi familia never even approached me to do the same. It always rubbed me raw. Were they worried that I\u2019d find out Alex and I weren\u2019t a match, or that I\u2019d somehow find out we were only half brothers? Chuy said I was blessed into the Latino Blood, but mi pap\u00e1 died before I was born. I couldn\u2019t have been blessed in, unless my father was a member of the LB at the time.</p><p>I need answers, and I need them now. Did mi'am\u00e1 shield me from the gang life because she didn\u2019t want me finding out the truth?</p><p>I used to know where my loyalties lie. Now I\u2019m not so sure.</p><p>\u201cDrive me back to the library,\u201d I say to the dude driving. \u201cI need to get out of here.\u201d</p><p>The guy looks to Chuy for direction. Chuy nods his approval. Even when they drop me off by the library and let me out of the car, I feel trapped. He knows where to find me, how to lure me back with threats I can\u2019t ignore. I left the picture in Chuy\u2019s car, hoping to leave the image of Hector proudly holding that baby\u2014me\u2014behind.</p><p>I find myself driving to Alex\u2019s apartment. I knock on the door, hoping he\u2019s home. I need answers, and he\u2019s the one person who can give them to me. Alex comes to the door. \u201cLuis, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cAre you my brother?\u201d I ask plain and simple.</p><p>\u201cOf course I\u2019m your brother,\u201d he says, confused.</p><p>\u201cLet me be more specific, then. Am I your half brother?\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t answer. He stares at me, with those Latino Blood tattoos on his own chest and arms mocking me.</p><p>\u201cFuck you, Alex!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Brittany says, coming into view with Paco in her arms. \u201cLuis, you look sick. I hope you didn\u2019t catch the flu from Paco. Are you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWeese!\u201d Paco yells, clapping and excited to see me.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not okay.\u201d I look at Alex with contempt. \u201cDoes Brit know?\u201d</p><p>Alex nods slowly.</p><p>\u201cDo I know what?\u201d Brittany says innocently as she wraps Paco tight in a blanket. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on between you two?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlex was just confirmin\u2019 that I\u2019m not his brother,\u201d I say.</p><p>Alex stands in front of me, face-to-face. \u201cYou are my brother, dammit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, half. What\u2019s the other half, huh? Tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you heard, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHector Martinez is my father, isn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>I glance at Alex\u2019s shoulder where Hector shot him not long after he killed Paco. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIsn\u2019t he?\u201d I say again.</p><p>\u201cS\u00ed, Luis,\u201d Alex says, defeated. \u201cHector Martinez was your father.\u201d</p><p>Brittany puts a comforting hand on my shoulder, but I shrug it off.</p><p>\u201cDoes Carlos know, or am I not only the black sheep of the family, but also the last to know who my own fuckin\u2019 father is.\u201d</p> <p>Alex doesn\u2019t want to tell me. He\u2019d rather keep me ignorant and innocent, but that\u2019s all in the past. I\u2019m not a kid anymore. Far from it.</p><p>\u201cTell me!\u201d I scream at him. My entire body is tense and I suppress a vicious rage that\u2019s bubbling inside me.</p><p>\u201cCalm down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me to calm down. Don\u2019t say another word to me except the absolute truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Alex brushes his fingers through his hair. \u201cHe suspects. He brought it up once about ten years ago, and I shut him down. I told him never to bring it up again, and he hasn\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, hooray for Fuentes family secrets.\u201d It feels like I\u2019ve got a lump the size of a basketball in my throat as I ask, \u201cDid he rape our mother? Am I the result of a rape?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe cheated?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot exactly. Why don\u2019t I take you home and you can ask her yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a home, Alex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be stupid, Luis. Your home is wherever your family is. Mam\u00e1 did things she thought would keep us safe.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo she whored herself out. Nice.\u201d</p><p>Alex pushes me, his eyes blazing mad. \u201cDon\u2019t talk about mi'am\u00e1 like that. She did what needed to be done, period. Don\u2019t judge her when you don\u2019t know what went down.\u201d</p><p>All this time I\u2019ve been so stupid. The evidence was right in front of my face and I never even put the pieces together. I had this ridiculous delusion that I was the golden child, because I was in my mother\u2019s stomach when my supposed father was shot and killed\u2014the last gift my father gave her was me.</p><p>But in reality I\u2019ve never been the golden child. I\u2019ve been the black sheep ... I\u2019ve called myself a Fuentes and I never was one.</p><p>I step back. \u201cAdios, bro.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt means I\u2019m out. For good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not goin\u2019 anywhere.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou have no hold over me, Alex. Hell, we don\u2019t even share the same father.\u201d I think of all the times I felt bad for Carlos because he seemed the odd one out. He didn\u2019t have the brains or even temper that Alex and I were born with.</p><p>Joke\u2019s on me. I don\u2019t even have the same blood.</p><p>\u201cYou think your DNA matters?\u201d he asks. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t. You were my brother as soon as you came out of Mam\u00e1\u2019s stomach and I held you when you were less than an hour old. You were my brother when Mam\u00e1 worked and I wiped your ass and changed your diapers. And you\u2019ll be my brother until I take my last breath! \u00bfComprende?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou denied me my history ... my heritage!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI denied you nothing, Luis. Your biological father was ...\u201d He hesitates.</p><p>\u201cGo ahead and say it. Come on, Alex, don\u2019t hold back now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHector Martinez was a manipulative asshole who threatened people with their lives so they did what he wanted. He was a murderer and drug lord. We did you a favor by not tellin\u2019 you that half your genes were from a man without scruples or a conscience.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou better be careful, Alex.\u201d I push him back, ready for a brawl. \u201cThat\u2019s my blood you\u2019re talkin\u2019 about.\u201d</p><p>My words must sting, because Alex pounds his chest. \u201cWake up, Luis. You\u2019re lookin\u2019 at your blood. I\u2019m your blood.\u201d</p><p>I regard him with disgust. \u201cAll I see in front of me is an ex\u2013Latino Blood. A traitor to my people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s bullshit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWatch your back, bro. You never know who\u2019s family ... and who\u2019s the enemy.\u201d</p><p>I storm away from him, blocking out Alex\u2019s demands to come back, mixed with Brittany\u2019s pleas not to leave. She says we can work it out.</p><p>I\u2019m done working things out.</p><p>Chuy was right. Being a Latino Blood is my destiny, my birthright. I told myself I wanted to get close to Chuy to gain insider info about the LB. I was lying to myself. All along I wanted to be in it, be a part of the drug deals and danger. I walk into the LB warehouse with one thing on my mind\u2014living up to my father\u2019s legacy.</p><p>Chuy is sitting in his makeshift office talking to some OGs. One look at me and Chuy sends everyone else out of the room\u2014except a guy named Tiny, who isn\u2019t tiny.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go to the bank and see what\u2019s in the safety-deposit box,\u201d I say. \u201cBut I\u2019ve got conditions.\u201d</p><p>His ever-present cigar is hanging from his mouth. He takes it out and blows smoke in the air. I watch as it lingers above his head before disappearing into the smoke-filled room. \u201cConditions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cS\u00ed. First, you never threaten Alex\u2019s family, Carlos, or mi'am\u00e1 again. Second, you initiate me like everyone else.\u201d No more straddling the line. I\u2019ve chosen my side, and I don\u2019t want anyone mistaking me for something that I\u2019m not and was never intended to be.</p><p>\u201cGlad you\u2019ve come around, Fuentes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t call me that,\u201d I say roughly. \u201cI\u2019m not a Fuentes and you know it, so stop the bullshit. You agree to my terms or not?\u201d</p><p>We stare each other down. \u201cSure. Hector predicted you\u2019d be a fighter,\u201d he says proudly, reminding me of the picture of Hector holding me when I was a newborn. He nods to Tiny to get the other OGs back in the room. \u201cLuis here wants to solidify his place in the LB family, boys,\u201d he calls out as they pile back in. \u201cProblem is, Luis, you\u2019ve already been blessed in. No need for an initiation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want it. Jump me in like a new recruit.\u201d</p><p>He laughs. \u201cWhat, you want us to kick the shit outta you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to be initiated like Alex. I\u2019m not takin\u2019 the easy way out. I can handle it.\u201d I\u2019ll show them I don\u2019t need to be protected from the truth. I can just hear Hector Martinez from the grave egging me on, challenging me to prove to all these guys that I\u2019m as tough as he was.</p><p>He cocks an eyebrow. \u201cYou can handle it, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m my father\u2019s son,\u201d I say stoically. \u201cBring it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMi placer,\u201d he says, amused. \u201cYo, Rico!\u201d he yells. \u201cRound up some others and give Luis here a Latino Blood thirteen-second welcome. I\u2019m gonna join in, too.\u201d He cracks his knuckles one by one. \u201cI\u2019m gonna enjoy this.\u201d</p><p>42</p><p>Nikki</p><p>Kendall thinks I\u2019m a survivor, but right now I don\u2019t feel like one. All I feel like doing is going over to Luis\u2019s house so he can hold me and tell me everything is okay between us.</p><p>I\u2019m dreaming. It\u2019s not okay between us and never will be.</p><p>\u201cDad,\u201d I say, sitting down with him as he watches a soccer match on television. \u201cHow come you and Mom never took us to Mexico?\u201d</p><p>He shrugs. \u201cWe travel a lot, Nikki. You went to Brazil with us two years ago. And Argentina when I spoke at the conference there. You practically gobbled up all the gelato in Italy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut why not Mexico?\u201d</p><p>He blows out a long, slow breath. \u201cI guess if we went, I\u2019d feel like I had to show you where I grew up. I don\u2019t want to look back, Nikki. Your mother doesn\u2019t want to, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA lot of the Mexican kids at school have parents who don\u2019t even speak English.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn the south side,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re trying to raise you and your brother to not have the we/them mentality, and the resentment between the haves and have-nots, which I\u2019m afraid is rampant on the south side. Your mother and I discussed it a lot before you were born.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s like we\u2019re white. I don\u2019t eat Mexican food and none of the kids I grew up with were Mexican.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not trying to be white, Nikki. We assimilated. Is that so horrible?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel like in the process of wanting to fit in so bad, you and Mom have neglected to make us proud of our heritage. I love being American. But when I look at the kids on the south side ... like the Fuentes family ... I\u2019m jealous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s there to be jealous about, honey? You have everything you need, and most things you want. We\u2019re living the American dream. I know the mentality of most Mexican families on the south side of Fairfield: work like a dog, send money to relatives back in Mexico, and don\u2019t have high expectations because they\u2019ll never be met. Most Mexican kids on the south side of Fairfield aren\u2019t expected to go to college. After high school they\u2019re expected to help their parents provide for the family, and protect what they call the \u2019hood. That\u2019s not our mentality.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d I want to tell him what\u2019s been nagging me for the past two months, ever since I was with Luis on Derek\u2019s boat. \u201cI want you to tell me about your childhood, Dad. Not now, but when you and Mom are ready. It\u2019s really important to me. Being Mexican is important to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes this have anything to do with you spending so much time with Luis?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe. We broke up, and I miss his family and being surrounded by people who showed off being Mexican like it was a badge of honor. I know it\u2019s stupid, but I really liked that.\u201d I also miss Luis so much, I ache for him and have cried myself to sleep every night since his birthday.</p><p>\u201cIf you want to go to Mexico, I\u2019ll talk to your mother. We have no plans this summer, with you going to college in the fall.\u201d He pats my knee. \u201cI think you\u2019re right. We need to look back sometimes and realize the past taught us to appreciate our future.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s true. I need to go back to my own past, so I can heal and look forward to the future. Marco is the key.</p><p>I leave the room and walk outside to call Marco. When he doesn\u2019t answer, I text him.</p><p>Me: can we talk?</p><p>Marco: Can\u2019t. I\u2019m helping Luis get jumped in</p><p>43</p><p>Luis</p><p>Chuy is standing in front of me, in the middle of a circle of about fifteen guys. My cousin Enrique isn\u2019t here, but Marco is. And a couple of other guys from school. He\u2019s also rounded up some of the guys who were around when Alex was in the Blood.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s what\u2019s gonna happen, Luis,\u201d Chuy explains. \u201cMis vatos and I are gonna take you in the back room and kick the shit out of you for thirteen seconds. When it\u2019s over, you\u2019re in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I fight back?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cNo. If you even attempt to, our punches will be harder,\u201d he says, not missing a beat. \u201cThis is to break you down before we build you back up bigger, stronger, and tougher. Like a stallion, ese. When we\u2019re done, you\u2019re a Latino Blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get it over with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn, you are like Hector. That crazy motherfucker was as impatient as you are,\u201d Chuy says. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>All of them lead me to a room without any windows. I notice dried blood stains on the floor. I should be scared, but I\u2019m not. Marco catches my attention. He\u2019s excited, like my jumping in will raise his position in the Blood.</p><p>A few of the OGs stand behind me, probably making sure I don\u2019t get last-minute jitters and escape.</p><p>\u201cYou ready?\u201d Chuy asks.</p><p>I nod. A deep rage simmers inside me, desperate to be unleashed. I don\u2019t know how much longer I can hold it back.</p> <p>Chuy grabs my chin, his fingers digging into my skin. \u201cYour face reminds me of Alex,\u201d he says. \u201cI enjoyed bringin\u2019 him to his knees when he jumped out. What sweet revenge this is gonna be.\u201d</p><p>I pull myself out of his grasp, but the second I\u2019m free Chuy\u2019s iron-hard fist flies in my face. He must have a ring on, because something sharp slashed my cheek.</p><p>\u201cOne,\u201d he says, gloating over the obvious damage.</p><p>\u201cTwo,\u201d I hear him call out. The rest of the guys start closing in. I quickly shield my face with my hands and arms. It\u2019s hard keeping them up when, blow after blow, my body aches and wants to crumple to the ground.</p><p>\u201cThree.\u201d</p> <p>A blow to my side makes me want to cry out, but I don\u2019t. I hold it in. I can handle anything, even this. I want to fight back, but Chuy\u2019s words are in the back of my head. Our punches will be harder.</p><p>\u201cFour.\u201d</p><p>Marco clocks me in the jaw when I move my hands for a split second. I taste blood, but don\u2019t have time to dwell on it as I struggle to stay upright. I\u2019m waiting to hear the number thirteen. It\u2019ll be over at thirteen.</p><p>\u201cFive.\u201d</p><p>One of the guys kicks the back of my knee hard. I stumble to the ground. I\u2019m on my hands and knees now. I\u2019m trying to stand, but can\u2019t. I get kicked hard in the stomach.</p><p>\u201cSix.\u201d</p> <p>I manage to stand up. Each blow feeds the restless fire inside me. I can handle this. I can handle anything.</p><p>\u201cSeven.\u201d</p><p>I have my hands covering my head again, but I don\u2019t think it does any good. A kick to my back makes me wince. I\u2019m losing energy fast.</p><p>\u201cEight.\u201d</p><p>Block it out, Luis. Block out the pain and think about something else.</p><p>Think about Nikki, the girl who stole your heart and ran away with it.</p><p>\u201cNine.\u201d</p><p>These guys fight like pros, though. They fight as hard and rough as Alex and Carlos. If Nikki were here, would she care that I was being beaten?</p> <p>\u201cTen.\u201d</p><p>I think it\u2019s almost done. I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m trying to stay strong but the constant blows and kicks are threatening to break me down, just like Chuy warned. My body has been hit so hard, I think one of these guys must either be wearing steel-toe shoes or has been specially trained for kicking. No. I won\u2019t let them win. I\u2019m in charge of my destiny, not them.</p><p>\u201cEleven.\u201d</p><p>Please let this be over soon. I feel my body going limp, and I can\u2019t hold in my rage any longer.</p><p>I don\u2019t hear the number twelve. Chuy has stopped counting. The bastard is just standing, prolonging the beating. The fact that with each blow I\u2019m stepping into the LB and out of Nikki\u2019s life forever is too much to take.</p><p>Fuck this game Chuy\u2019s playing. I start swinging, ready to bring down anyone who dares to get near me.</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d I hear someone yell after I punch him.</p><p>I bring two more down while some OGs are trying to pin me to the ground. Chuy is standing off to the side, enjoying this. He\u2019s got a cocky grin on his face that needs to be wiped off, right now.</p><p>I deck two more guys and squirm out of the grasp of the OGs and go after Chuy. I want nothing more right now than to unleash my fury on him. He swings at me, but I\u2019m faster. My fist connects with the side of his jaw. He flies back, and I get brief satisfaction while four of the OGs grab my hands and twist them behind my back.</p><p>Chuy is bleeding out of the side of his mouth. He doesn\u2019t bother wiping it off ... instead he licks it like a bloodsucking vampire. I may not get out of this alive, but at this point I don\u2019t give a shit.</p><p>\u201cWe have a little miscommunication, peque\u00f1a mierda. You seem to think you\u2019re runnin\u2019 this show. Maybe you forgot that I\u2019m the boss here. Not you. You think you could replace me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I mumble.</p><p>He punches me in the gut and I double over, but the guys holding my arms like a damn vise straighten me back up.</p><p>\u201cWrong answer. I\u2019ll ask again. You think you could replace me?\u201d</p><p>I take a deep breath, force myself to ignore the piercing pain my body is in, and look up. \u201cYeah,\u201d I say.</p><p>He punches my face, this time harder\u2014if that was even possible. My head reels in pain.</p><p>\u201cWrong answer. I\u2019ll ask again. You think you could replace me?\u201d</p><p>I try to open my eyes wider, but I can\u2019t. I do the best I can, though, through the haze. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>He punches me in the gut again. He might have broken a rib, \u2019cause I felt something crack.</p><p>\u201cWrong answer. I\u2019ll ask again. You think you could replace me?\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s done. I lost Nikki. I lost NASA. I lost everyone else. The only thing I have left is my father\u2019s legacy as a hardass who never backed down until he was dead and buried. I\u2019ll hang on to that legacy for as long as I can.</p><p>\u201cS\u00ed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDelgado, get me an electric shaver,\u201d Chuy orders. \u201cAnd a screwdriver ... a sharp one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Marco asks.</p><p>\u201cJust do it, you stupid little fuck. If you don\u2019t want to end up like this pendejo, do it.\u201d</p><p>Chuy\u2019s next blow to my head is the last thing I remember before I black out.</p><p>When I come to, I\u2019m lying on the cement floor.</p><p>\u201c\u00a1Felicitaciones!\u201d Chuy says as he crouches beside me. I catch sight of the gold rings on his fingers. \u201cYou\u2019re one of us now.\u201d</p><p>I just want to lie back down right here on the floor and sleep until my body stops screaming out in pain.</p><p>44</p><p>Nikki</p><p>Marco finally answers my call after an hour of me trying nonstop.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Luis?\u201d I ask him.</p><p>\u201cI dropped him off at home a few minutes ago,\u201d Marco\u2019s voice echoes through the receiver. He chuckles, the sound mocking me. \u201cHe\u2019s in bad shape, but he\u2019ll survive. He\u2019s one tough motherfucker. Didn\u2019t know he had so much fight in him, but Chuy brought him to his knees.\u201d</p><p>My heart slams in my chest. \u201cYou could have stopped it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re delusional. Luis wanted it ... he asked for it. Get your head out of your ass and face the fact, Nik. You don\u2019t have a hold on him anymore. The LB does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did you pick the LB over me, Marco? Tell me the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMoney, status, brotherhood. You and I would\u2019ve never lasted, and I knew it. You were a temporary distraction from my goals.\u201d</p><p>A temporary distraction. The truth definitely hurts, but it\u2019s a dull ache instead of real pain. I\u2019m over him, over us, over what happened as a result of our relationship.</p><p>\u201cI was pregnant the day we broke up,\u201d I tell him, then look at the picture of me and Luis dancing at Alex and Brittany\u2019s wedding, still up on my wall. Somehow seeing Luis\u2019s goofy grin as he tried to get me to smile gives me the hope and the strength to get through this conversation. \u201cI\u2019ve carried guilt about not telling you for over two years. I had a miscarriage, and our breakup\u2014combined with losing our baby\u2014messed me up for a long time.\u201d</p><p>I stop talking and wait for his reaction. I don\u2019t know what I want him to say, or what I expect him to say.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know the kid was mine?\u201d he says in a cocky tone.</p><p>He knew I was his first and he was mine. There was nobody else. His question is so insulting he doesn\u2019t deserve an answer.</p><p>I hang up on him, then call Kendall. \u201cLuis got jumped into the Latino Blood tonight,\u201d I tell her. \u201cI\u2019m going to his house to make sure he\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m coming with you,\u201d she says. I hear Derek\u2019s muffled voice as she tells him what\u2019s going on. \u201cDerek\u2019s coming, too. We\u2019ll be at your house in five minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHurry,\u201d I tell her.</p><p>I knock on Luis\u2019s front door, but there\u2019s no answer. The door is slightly open, so we walk in.</p><p>\u201cLuis?\u201d I call out.</p><p>No one responds. I go to his room, knowing that he\u2019s here ... feeling his presence somewhere in the house.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll check the bedrooms,\u201d Derek says. \u201cYou two stay by the front door. If you need to get out of here fast, just go.\u201d</p><p>Derek opens the door to Luis\u2019s bedroom. I squeeze Kendall\u2019s arm, scared of what he\u2019ll find ... if anything.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell happened to you, dude?\u201d Derek asks.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d I hear Luis answer.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s here,\u201d I whisper to Kendall.</p><p>\u201cNikki wanted to make sure you were okay.\u201d Derek waves me over. \u201cI\u2019ll, uh, be right outside the door if you need anything ... like a hospital.\u201d</p><p>I gasp when I see Luis sitting on his bed with his back against the wall. His head is resting in his hands. There\u2019s blood all over his face. His head is shaved, and his completely bloodied shirt is in shreds on the floor.</p><p>Granny is sitting beside him, her head on his thigh. She knows he\u2019s hurting.</p><p>I rush over to him, afraid to touch his face for fear I\u2019ll hurt him. \u201cWhat did they do to you?\u201d I ask softly, trying to hold back the flood of emotion threatening to rush out of me. I have to stay strong for Luis.</p><p>\u201cGo away,\u201d he moans.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not leaving while you look like that,\u201d I whisper.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need you here, and I sure as hell don\u2019t want you here. We\u2019re done, remember? I\u2019m not your charity case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you look like one right now. Drop the ego and let me help you.\u201d</p><p>They shaved off his beautiful signature hair. Did they hold him down, or did he bow his head in submission and willingly have it shaved? Either way, they weren\u2019t gentle. He\u2019s got cuts all over his scalp.</p><p>\u201cThey shaved your head.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t realize it before, but his spiked, boyish hair was a symbol of his innocence and individuality. Now he looks so tough ... so Latino Blood. I lift his chin and urge him to look at me. When he does, I almost suck in a breath. His lips are busted up, his eyes are half closed because his lids are swollen ... and he\u2019s got red, nasty cuts mixed with bruises all over his face, back, and chest.</p><p>When I look into his eyes, they\u2019ve got an empty hollowness to them. It scares me. Will he change and become like Marco?</p><p>\u201cWhat part of \u2018get away from me\u2019 don\u2019t you understand?\u201d he asks.</p><p>When he cups his head in his hands, I catch a glimpse of the letters L and B gouged in his bicep.</p><p>\u201cYou need to go to a hospital,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t. They\u2019ll ask me what happened.\u201d He looks up at me. \u201cI\u2019m bound by a code of silence. You know what I need, Nik? Drugs. Illegal ones. Lots of \u2019em, actually. And make sure there\u2019s enough so I don\u2019t come out of it for a while.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cStop talking stupid.\u201d I sit on the bed and take a long, hard look at him. \u201cHere\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen. You\u2019re gonna let me clean you up. After that, you can tell me to leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you hear me? Unless you have pain meds, I don\u2019t want you near me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo bad.\u201d</p><p>Kendall and Derek help me wet some paper towels with hydrogen peroxide. I kneel in front of Luis and gently place one of the paper towels next to a cut by his eyebrow.</p> <p>\u201cWhat happened to the boy who said he loved me?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cHe died,\u201d he says dryly.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to push you away,\u201d I tell him. \u201cIt\u2019s my defense mechanism.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCongratulations, Nikki,\u201d he says. \u201cYou win.\u201d</p><p>He jerks his head away from me, but I make him face me while I clean off his chin and a nasty cut on his cheek. When I move to clean the wound on his bicep, the angry letters gouged out of his skin that\u2019ll leave permanent scars stare back at me.</p> <p>He holds my wrist with his strong fingers and stills my hand, which is about to wipe off blood still oozing from the wound. \u201cDon\u2019t help me,\u201d he says. \u201cI need you to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? We had a connection, Luis. I want to forget it but I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>His haunting eyes stare right through me. \u201cDon\u2019t lie to yourself and think what we had was any different than what you had with Marco.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe that,\u201d I say, shaking my head. \u201cMaybe we don\u2019t have a chance for a future, but I know from the bottom of my heart that what we have goes way deeper than anything I had with Marco.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wrong.\u201d He grabs my fist tighter, stopping me from touching him. \u201cYo, Derek!\u201d he yells.</p><p>Derek sticks his head in the doorway. \u201cYeah?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGet her out of here, before I do somethin\u2019 stupid.\u201d</p><p>Derek touches my shoulder. \u201cNik ... you need to let him go.\u201d</p><p>I swallow the basketball-sized lump in my throat. \u201cI love you, Luis.\u201d</p><p>Luis squeezes his eyes shut. \u201cDerek ... get her out!\u201d</p><p>I move away from him and take a deep breath. I can\u2019t get through to him. He\u2019s gone to the other side and left me behind.</p><p>45</p><p>Luis</p><p>Less than an hour after Nikki and company leave my house, I get a surprise visit from Alex and Carlos. Word obviously spread to them that I got jumped in, because they don\u2019t look surprised to see me all beat up.</p> <p>\u201cGo take a shower,\u201d Alex says, tossing me a towel. \u201cYou\u2019re filthy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t take too long,\u201d Carlos says, tapping me on the leg. \u201cBecause dinner\u2019ll be ready in forty-five minutes.\u201d</p><p>He picks up Granny, who hasn\u2019t left my side.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want dinner,\u201d I tell him. \u201cAnd give me back my dog.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll want to eat when you find out what I\u2019m makin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>I look up at my half brothers. I expect them to give me shit, but they don\u2019t. They\u2019re just ... here.</p><p>\u201cYour dog is depressed, just like you,\u201d Carlos says as he sets Granny on the floor.</p><p>I take a shower and let the hot water wash away the dried blood on my skin, but it won\u2019t erase the fact that I\u2019m a full-fledged Latino Blood. Or the fact that I pushed Nikki away for good, which hurt way more than Chuy gouging the letters LB into my skin with the screwdriver.</p><p>I\u2019ve lost her. It\u2019s a good thing, though. I\u2019d just end up disappointing her, and I don\u2019t want to hurt her more than I already have.</p><p>When I step out of the bathroom, my brothers are sitting at the kitchen table. They\u2019re talking quietly, obviously discussing how they\u2019re going to deal with me. When I don\u2019t join them, they bring their plates to my room and lean against the wall while they chow down. The smell of beef and spices makes my mouth water, but I don\u2019t want to face them right now ... or eat with them.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you two doin\u2019?\u201d I ask.</p><p>Alex and Carlos look at eat other and shrug. \u201cEatin\u2019, bro,\u201d Alex says. \u201cWhat does it look like we\u2019re doin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>I point to my bedroom door. \u201cWe have a kitchen, you know. Go eat in there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m cool,\u201d Carlos says. \u201cWhat about you, Alex?\u201d</p><p>Alex takes a forkful of carne guisada, which they both know is my favorite. \u201cI\u2019m cool, too,\u201d he says as he makes a big deal out of shoving the food in his mouth and moaning in pleasure as if he\u2019s in carne guisada heaven.</p><p>After dinner, Carlos lies down on a spare mattress on the floor in my room. \u201cAren\u2019t you stayin\u2019 at the hotel with Kiara?\u201d I ask him.</p><p>\u201cNot tonight. Or tomorrow. You fucked that plan up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t blame me,\u201d I tell him. \u201cGo to the hotel. I want you to.\u201d</p><p>When I get my aching bones up to go to the bathroom, I notice Alex has camped out on the living room couch. \u201cGo home to your wife and kid,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m stayin\u2019 here for the week. Mi'am\u00e1 is stayin\u2019 with Brit and Paco, in case you were wonderin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need you and Carlos babysittin\u2019 me. I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>Once I get a bunch of Tylenol in me, I\u2019ll be fine.</p><p>He laughs as he scans my appearance. \u201cYeah, right. You look fine, bro. Go to bed and let your body start to repair itself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen\u2019s the lecture comin\u2019?\u201d I ask. I\u2019m not stupid enough to think I\u2019m off the hook from Alex and Carlos giving me shit.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not gonna lecture you,\u201d Alex says.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not, either,\u201d Carlos says.</p><p>\u201cYou do realize I\u2019m an LB, right?\u201d I say just to make sure we\u2019re all on the same page. \u201cI didn\u2019t get mugged today ... I got jumped in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStatin\u2019 the obvious, bro,\u201d Carlos says in a bored tone.</p><p>Alex picks up the remote and watches television. They\u2019re pretending like they don\u2019t care one bit that I\u2019m part of the Latino Blood, but I\u2019m not an idiot. They\u2019re playing me. But why?</p><p>\u201cSo you guys are cool with it?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t go that far,\u201d Alex says. \u201cBut we get it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd we\u2019re gonna give you time to get out of it,\u201d Carlos says.</p><p>I hold my bruised ribs as I limp back to my room. \u201cCome on, Granny,\u201d I say. My dog bumps her head into the wall and I want to tell her I feel her pain\u2014literally.</p><p>\u201cOh, and by the way,\u201d Alex yells from the living room. \u201cEnrique is givin\u2019 you a week off work.\u201d</p><p>I slowly lower myself onto my bed, trying to ignore every ache. I couldn\u2019t work even if I wanted to.</p><p>\u201cOh, one more thing,\u201d Alex calls out. \u201cYour chemistry teacher is comin\u2019 to tutor you this week while you heal. You go to school lookin\u2019 like that and Aguirre\u2019ll call the cops.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease tell me you\u2019re jokin\u2019 about Peterson comin\u2019 here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo joke, bro. She\u2019s really lookin\u2019 forward to it,\u201d Alex says.</p><p>46</p><p>Nikki</p><p>Luis hasn\u2019t been back to school all week. I called Brittany, who told me that Alex and Carlos have been taking care of him. Alex says he\u2019s healing fast. Kendall, Derek, and Hunter invited me to play golf at Brickstone. I don\u2019t want to go, but I need to get my mind off of Luis.</p><p>I can\u2019t say how many times I\u2019ve been tempted to go over to Luis\u2019s house. Six times I got in my car and started driving, but I always stopped myself before I crossed the railroad tracks to the south side.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you came,\u201d Hunter says as I set my golf clubs in the golf cart.</p><p>I give him a small smile. \u201cMe too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe three,\u201d Derek says, then nudges Kendall.</p><p>\u201cMe four,\u201d she says, although she\u2019s less enthusiastic.</p><p>On the eighth hole, while Derek is coaching Kendall on how to do a chip shot to get her ball out of the sand trap, Hunter sits next to me in the golf cart. \u201cGo to my homecoming with me,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cWas that a question or a statement?\u201d I ask him.</p><p>\u201cConsidering I don\u2019t want you to even contemplate saying no, I\u2019d say it was a statement.\u201d He puts his arm around me. \u201cYou know I\u2019ve always wanted to date you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiar. You\u2019ve wanted to add me to your trophy shelf.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue. So how about it?\u201d</p><p>I glance down at his green custom golf shoes with shiny gold designs on the tops. His initials are engraved in the gold. Luis wouldn\u2019t be caught dead in them. \u201cI can\u2019t go to homecoming with you, Hunter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it because of my shoes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s because I\u2019m in love with someone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes he know about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. But he doesn\u2019t believe me.\u201d</p><p>When Marco and I broke up, and I saw him with Mariana, I didn\u2019t fight for him. I gave up and let the LB win. With Luis it\u2019s different. I realized that I\u2019m not giving up on us, and I\u2019m going to fight to get him back. I love him deeper than just my heart ... I love him to the inner parts of my soul as if he\u2019s a part of me.</p><p>It\u2019s about time he knows it.</p><p>47</p><p>Luis</p><p>While Alex is out and Carlos is watching television, I sneak out my bedroom window with my backpack and head to the bank with the key to the safety-deposit box. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s too much to hope I\u2019ll be back before they realize I\u2019m gone. I have to know what\u2019s in the bank, so I can decide what to do. I sneak through back alleys to make sure I\u2019m not followed.</p><p>At the bank, I give them my ID and sign a slip of paper declaring that I\u2019m the owner of the box. Afterward, I\u2019m directed to a locked vault. The bank employees leave me in the vault alone while I open the box and examine the contents.</p><p>Stacks of hundred-dollar bills stare back at me. I bet there\u2019s at least ten or fifteen thousand dollars here. My heart starts racing. I don\u2019t look up for fear there\u2019s a video camera watching my every move. Seeing this much money makes me nervous. What was it supposed to be used for? Why did Hector put my name on the box in the first place? I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll ever get the answers.</p><p>There\u2019s also a piece of paper with a bunch of numbers on it and below them the letters CODEOFSILENCE\u2014all caps, no spaces.</p><p>Under the money is another piece of paper, embossed and stamped as original\u2014my birth certificate.</p><p>Luis Salvatore Martinez Fuentes.</p><p>I stare at the two last names ... mi'am\u00e1 acknowledged Hector as my father on my birth certificate. She gave me his last name, but never told me. On the bottom of the certificate, where it says father, Hector Martinez is listed\u2014and the bastard signed the document.</p><p>Despite everything, I don\u2019t feel like a Martinez. It\u2019s not a part of me, and I won\u2019t adopt it as my own.</p><p>I jot the numbers down on my palm with a pen, fold the birth certificate into my pocket, then put the box back in its slot. Since I laid my eyes on the cash, I\u2019ve been trying to convince myself to take it\u2014it\u2019s mine, isn\u2019t it? Mi'am\u00e1 needs it, Alex needs it ... it could help Carlos and Kiara start their lives together. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But what if it\u2019s blood money, or drug money? Shit, I\u2019m a Latino Blood with a damn conscience. Not a good combination.</p><p>I quickly fill my backpack with the cash, then take the bus to the local library, hoping I\u2019m not being tracked. If Chuy knows I\u2019ve been to the bank, then he knows I\u2019ve seen what\u2019s in the box. Is he expecting me to just hand over the cash and give him the numbers on the paper? If I don\u2019t give them to him, will he kill me? If I do give them to him, what does he need me for, then? Best bet is that I\u2019ll be smoked either way.</p><p>If Nikki and I were together, she\u2019d be in danger. I\u2019m glad I gave her up, although it\u2019s killing me inside.</p><p>I can\u2019t tell Alex and Carlos what\u2019s goin\u2019 down. They\u2019re already involved more than they should be. I swear they haven\u2019t let me out of their sight for one minute since they came back home. If Carlos gets involved, and something goes wrong and he gets arrested, he\u2019ll most likely be dishonorably discharged from the army. Alex could lose his scholarship, his family ... if he\u2019s in jail, he\u2019ll miss the birth of his second child.</p> <p>I\u2019ll never let either of them get involved. I might be a Martinez, but I still feel like a Fuentes.</p><p>I look back and realize that I\u2019m being tailed by a black Camaro. The guy driving looks suspiciously like the pendejo who opened the door in that house Marco and I went to in the F5 territory to collect the five Gs.</p><p>Luckily I know Fairfield like the back of my hand. I walk toward the police station, which is right behind the library. I walk inside the station lobby and wait while the car passes, then go behind the station and head to the back door of the library.</p><p>Once inside, I sign up for an hour of computer use. I Google the set of numbers I found in the safety deposit box, but nothing comes up. What would Hector do with the numbers? Probably not a phone number, but the number starts with double zeroes. I deduce that it\u2019s either some kind of code, a password, or an account number. A bank account, maybe. But what bank? There\u2019s probably thousands of banks. How the hell am I supposed to figure out which one? Or maybe it\u2019s not a bank account, and the numbers don\u2019t mean shit.</p><p>It\u2019s no use. My hour is up and I still don\u2019t have a clue what the numbers mean. I look behind me and see someone else waiting to use the computer. Damn. I need more time.</p> <p>At home, I sneak back in through my window when I catch sight of Reyes smoking a cigarette on his back porch. He\u2019s shirtless and his back is to me. Plain as day I see a tattoo between his shoulder blades. F5.</p><p>Reyes is a gangbanger posing as a cop? Holy shit. What has he been doin\u2019, spying on me like the others? Was this all planned out? Chuy said he\u2019s been watching me all along, even when I was in Colorado. Could Chuy secretly be fuckin\u2019 with me?</p><p>I\u2019m so fucking confused it feels like my head is about to explode. Not wanting Reyes to know I\u2019ve seen him, I sneak around to the front of the house. When I walk through the door, Peterson is sitting at the kitchen table peering at me over her glasses.</p><p>\u201cWeren\u2019t you supposed to give birth already?\u201d I ask her.</p><p>She touches her protruding stomach. \u201cAny day now. I\u2019m on maternity leave, so you\u2019ll have a break from me for a few months. Don\u2019t be too broken up about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou almost missed our tutoring session,\u201d she says, then glances at her watch.</p><p>Considering my chances of surviving the next few weeks are slim, she doesn\u2019t need to waste her time. \u201cListen, Mrs. P., I know my brothers kind of coerced you to be here, but it\u2019s a waste of your time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not giving up on you,\u201d she says, patting the chair next to her.</p><p>\u201cI would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t give up on Alex, and I\u2019m not giving up on you. Alex had every reason to throw it all away but he didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Alex never had the connection to the LB that I do.</p><p>\u201cShow me your math homework,\u201d she orders in a no-nonsense voice.</p><p>\u201cNot to be disrespectful, Mrs. P., but I\u2019d bet I\u2019m better in math than you.\u201d My brothers must have found my textbook and binders in my room and \u201chelpfully\u201d left them on the table for me. I pull out the math sheet I finished in five seconds.</p> <p>\u201cMr. Gasper gave me a new worksheet. I made a copy of it. I bet I can finish the worksheet faster than you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow much?\u201d</p><p>She pulls her wallet out, opens it, then slips a five-dollar bill out of the top. Attached to one side of her wallet are her checks ... with a row of numbers at the bottom. The first two numbers are zeroes.</p><p>\u201cWhat are those numbers?\u201d I ask her, pointing to the bottom of the check.</p><p>\u201cThe bank routing number, and the bank account number. Why?\u201d</p><p>I glance at my palm with the numbers written on it, and adrenaline pumps through my veins. That\u2019s it. The bank routing number, and bank account. \u201cNo reason. I\u2019ve never had checks,\u201d I tell her.</p><p>Mrs. P. takes ten minutes to explain how checks work, and even pulls one of hers out of her wallet and makes me write one out.</p><p>\u201cSign your name here,\u201d she says, pointing to the bottom right corner. \u201cThis is a life skill that you should know, Luis.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got other life skills,\u201d I tell her.</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, I don\u2019t consider cussing a life skill. Or fighting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do. Necessary ones.\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head and sighs in frustration. \u201cI will give you this important information about checks.\u201d She writes the word VOID in big bold letters on the front of the check she told me to practice on. \u201cLet this be the last time you write your name on someone else\u2019s check. If you do, or forge someone\u2019s name on a check, it\u2019s a felony. You go to jail. Make good decisions, Luis. Focus on math and science and doing well in school. Those will help you. The fighting won\u2019t.\u201d She places Gasper\u2019s worksheet in front of me. \u201cYou ready for the challenge?\u201d</p><p>I pick up a pencil. \u201cYou\u2019re on, Mrs. P. But I\u2019ve got to warn you, I\u2019m a numbers guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d she says, patting me on the hand. \u201cThat skill will serve you well in college, and when you\u2019re up in space.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s more likely I\u2019ll end up in hell before heaven or space.</p><p>48</p><p>Nikki</p><p>I gave Derek a note to give to Luis. He texted me that he delivered it. Now I\u2019m waiting. If he won\u2019t come to me, I\u2019m going to him.</p><p>I debated what to wear, and now I\u2019m second-guessing myself. What if he doesn\u2019t remember this dress, the one I wore the night I met him? What if he doesn\u2019t remember what room we were in when we first laid eyes on each other?</p><p>But the setup doesn\u2019t matter. What matters is that Luis knows I love him, and I\u2019m not giving up on us trying to make this work.</p><p>I know he\u2019s a Latino Blood now, but if he realizes what we have is stronger than any bond he could have to a gang, everything will work out. I have to believe he really doesn\u2019t want to be in the LB and will find a way to get out.</p><p>I look at my cell phone. No call from Luis, no text, and it\u2019s nine o\u2019clock. I told him in the letter to meet me here at nine. Every second that passes makes me nervous that he might not show, but I don\u2019t give up hope. Even at nine fifteen when there\u2019s no sign of him, I still have faith he\u2019ll come. I feel like that movie where the girl is standing on the pitcher\u2019s mound, waiting for the guy. When all hope is lost, the hero comes running onto the field and they live happily ever after.</p><p>Luis is my hero, even if he doesn\u2019t know it yet. He\u2019ll know tonight ... if he shows up.</p><p>I check my clock again for the hundredth time. Nine thirty.</p><p>When I called the private grounds where Brittany and Alex got married, the lady on the phone told me I had to call their management office to inquire about a daily rental. To my surprise, Hunter answered the phone. Ends up his family owns the property, and he told me the house would be unoccupied for two days, so I could stay there for free. When I told him he might change his mind about letting me use the place because I was going to be with another guy, all he said was, \u201cLucky guy. I hope he\u2019s worth it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>At ten, I\u2019m losing hope. I take the key out of my purse, ready to close the place up, when the door opens.</p><p>Luis is in the doorway. \u201cHey,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDerek gave me your note. Sorry I\u2019m late. There was a little mishap with my dog.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to Granny?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe kind of wandered off, but I found her. Why did you want me to come here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t been at school.\u201d I step closer to him. \u201cI missed you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wearin\u2019 the same dress you had on when we met.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou remembered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow could I forget. I thought you were an angel from heaven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still your angel, Luis.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t do this.\u201d He looks around the room. \u201cYou pushed me away that night at your place ... You were right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I was scared, Luis. The second I laid eyes on you, I knew you were dangerous ... because I felt a connection.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe same you felt with Marco,\u201d he says with a sad tone to his voice.</p><p>\u201cNo. Very different. Very, very different. You\u2019re a genius in chemistry class, Luis. Explain the electricity in the room right now. It\u2019s flowing between us ... even you can\u2019t control it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s lust.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s something else. Follow me,\u201d I say, then slide past him and head outside to the dance floor.</p><p>\u201cYou were a shitty dancer back then,\u201d he says, watching me as I play music I\u2019d already set up from my portable iPod speakers.</p><p>I smile sheepishly. \u201cI\u2019m still a shitty dancer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not who you think I am, or who I thought I was. I found out that my father was Hector Martinez, the head of the Latino Blood. I\u2019m following in his footsteps.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m shocked, but everything makes more sense now. \u201cWhy follow in his footsteps?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I have to, Nik. It\u2019s my legacy. I was born a Latino Blood,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I\u2019m gonna die one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot tonight, you\u2019re not.\u201d I take his arms and put them around me as we sway to the music. I wrap my arms around his neck as a slow love song plays in the background. \u201cI love you, Luis ... unconditionally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNik, don\u2019t do this,\u201d he whispers.</p><p>I hold him tighter. \u201cI\u2019m not holding back anymore. Luis, tell me you love me, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never stopped lovin\u2019 you, mi chava.\u201d I hear him curse under his breath. \u201cBut I can\u2019t drag you down with me. This can\u2019t happen between us, because you know I\u2019ll have to leave you.\u201d</p><p>I take his hand and lead him onto the beach, and into one of the many abandoned lifeguard stations. Flickering candles in glass containers surround the cramped space\u2014candles I lit over an hour ago.</p><p>He stands against the wall, watching my every move. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLast time we were alone together I held back,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>\u201cI know. You didn\u2019t trust me, which was a smart move. You said you didn\u2019t love me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI lied.\u201d I run my fingers lightly over his shaved head and he closes his eyes. \u201cYou look so tough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t feel so tough.\u201d He opens his eyes. They sparkle with every flicker of the candlelight hitting them. He\u2019s got beautiful, mesmerizing eyes that pierce my soul. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t love me. I don\u2019t deserve it.\u201d</p> <p>I hold his face in my hands. \u201cLuis, I admire the fact that you know what you want, and go for it even when the odds are stacked against you. You\u2019ve taught me to be proud of my Mexican heritage. I am in awe of how smart you are, and that you push me away to protect me from the Latino Blood. I think it\u2019s adorable when you look up at the sky and instead of admiring it you want to go up there and explore it. I love you because you\u2019re the only person I want to make love to without any conditions and\u2014and I love that you need me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do need you, Nik. But I still don\u2019t deserve you.\u201d</p><p>Just knowing that he\u2019s here with me is enough. \u201cWe deserve each other, Luis ... and I need you just as much as you need me. Hold me.\u201d</p><p>He steps closer, but hesitates. \u201cIf I do, mi chava, I can\u2019t promise I\u2019ll be able to let you go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p> <p>He wraps his arms around me and I wrap mine around him. It\u2019s silent, except for the sound of our breathing and the gentle waves lapping against the shore. We stay standing, embracing each other, for what seems like forever. This is what it\u2019s supposed to be like.</p><p>\u201cWant me to list all the reasons I love you?\u201d he asks me. \u201cI wrote a poem about it for English class ... I called you my forever and always.\u201d</p><p>Hearing his words makes me smile, and I tell him what I\u2019m feeling deep in my gut. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna make it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe odds are against us, Nik.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince when did bad odds ever stop you from your goal?\u201d I ask, then lift his shirt up and kiss his abs. I follow the line of hair from his navel down until I reach the waistband of his jeans.</p><p>\u201cKiss me,\u201d he says, urging me up so we\u2019re face-to-face.</p> <p>We start making out slowly, but as soon as he opens his mouth and his tongue slides against mine, it\u2019s no holds barred. Our bodies melt against each other and I feel his hardness through his jeans. I\u2019m not holding back this time. I couldn\u2019t even if I wanted to ... this is too intense.</p><p>\u201cYour skin is so damn soft,\u201d he says as his hands reach under my dress and he pulls down my panties until I step out of them.</p><p>I push him against the wall. \u201cStay right there. Don\u2019t move,\u201d I order, then unzip his pants and ease down his boxers.</p><p>\u201cNik ...\u201d He groans as I touch him all over until I know he\u2019s about to lose control.</p><p>\u201cMmm ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna ...\u201d He can\u2019t get out the rest of his sentence.</p><p>\u201cMake love to me, Luis.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to, baby, but I don\u2019t have a condom. I can\u2019t risk gettin\u2019 you\u2014\u201d</p> <p>I put a finger over his beautiful lips. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. I\u2019m on the pill now. I\u2019m safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too ... I mean, you know, I don\u2019t have any STDs,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ready then, and I\u2019m not holding back this time. Do you want this as much I do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore than you know.\u201d He kicks off his pants and boxers, then covers the floor with our clothes before he lowers me to the floor. \u201cYou really sure you\u2019re ready for this?\u201d he asks, his face full of vulnerability and emotion.</p><p>I nod.</p><p>\u201cI love you, mi chava,\u201d he whispers in my ear as we move together as one. \u201cI\u2019ll always love you, no matter what happens, okay?\u201d He brushes the hair off my face. His intense, soulful eyes pierce mine as we cling desperately to each other. He stills. \u201cIf I die tomorrow, move on. Promise me you\u2019ll move on.\u201d</p><p>Tears sting my eyes. \u201cI won\u2019t let you die, Luis.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPromise me, Nik. For me. Come on, if you love me ...\u201d</p><p>He knows his life is in grave danger. I can feel his tension, his pain ... his sorrow.</p><p>I try to hold back tears, but they won\u2019t stop. I grab on to him, clutching him to me ... feeling the love flow between us ... a forever bond that defies explanation.</p><p>Afterward, we lie together and watch the moonlit waves way into the night. I don\u2019t want to sleep, but I curl into his warmth and my eyelids grow heavy.</p><p>\u201cYou can change your destiny, Luis,\u201d I say before I fall asleep. \u201cIf anyone can do it, you can.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t wake up until the sun shines through the wooden slats of the roof. Luis is writing something in candle wax on the wall beside me.</p><p>It\u2019s a heart with initials inside: LF + NC.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d I say.</p><p>He looks at me and smiles. \u201cHey. You sleep okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReal good. I like sleeping in your arms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo your parents know you were with me?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He sighs heavily. \u201cThey don\u2019t want you with someone like me. They\u2019re right, you know. I\u2019m not innocent, Nikki. And I\u2019m afraid that I\u2019m in too deep to get out.\u201d He crouches beside me and gently touches my cheek with his fingers. \u201cGod, how I wanted last night to go on forever. But it can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re talking like this is the end.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt might be. It involves a lot of money, and I\u2019m in the middle of it. People have died for less money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not letting you die,\u201d I tell him. I\u2019ll find some way to help him.</p><p>\u201cI wish it was that simple.\u201d He squeezes his eyes shut. \u201cI\u2019ve got to go. I can\u2019t stall any longer.\u201d</p><p>I put on all my clothes and stand up. \u201cI\u2019m going with you, then. We\u2019re in this together.\u201d</p><p>He smiles. \u201cI won\u2019t let you. You know that. I\u2019m not puttin\u2019 you in danger. I can\u2019t call the cops, I can\u2019t tell my brothers ... I\u2019m on my own here.\u201d</p><p>Tears stream down my face as I reach up and kiss his cheeks, his eyelids, his warm lips. \u201cI have complete faith in you and I love you no matter what. Remember that, okay?\u201d</p><p>He nods. \u201cYou make me believe in the impossible.\u201d</p><p>We hold each other for a long time, until he tells me he\u2019s got to go. As I watch him drive away, I know what I need to do. He might not think I can help him, but I need to try. I drive over to Marco\u2019s house, hoping it\u2019s early enough that he\u2019s home.</p><p>He answers the door, surprised to see me. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need you to help Luis.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChuy ordered everyone away from the warehouse when he meets with Luis. That usually means he wants no witnesses. I can\u2019t do anythin\u2019 to change it.\u201d</p><p>I grab his shirt when he starts to close the door on me. \u201cYou can\u2019t just sit back and let Luis get hurt.\u201d</p><p>He shrugs out of my hold. \u201cIt\u2019s not in my hands, Nik.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re not going to help him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI value my life, Nik. If I go against Chuy, I\u2019m dead. I\u2019m playin\u2019 both sides, waitin\u2019 for someone to go down. If the F5 are standin\u2019 at the end, I\u2019m with them. If Chuy is on top, I\u2019m with the LB.\u201d</p><p>I slap him. \u201cYou\u2019re nothing but a coward. How can you stand by, knowing that your friend\u2019s life is in danger?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s simple. I\u2019m lookin\u2019 out for number one, baby. Me.\u201d</p><p>49</p><p>Luis</p><p>Granny hadn\u2019t wandered off last night. I was late meeting Nikki because I was over at Derek\u2019s house. After he\u2019d given me the letter from Nikki, I asked him if I could use the Internet at his house. It was a good thing my brothers didn\u2019t question me.</p><p>Within forty-five minutes, I\u2019d had the answer I was looking for. The numbers I\u2019d written on my hand and memorized were the bank routing and account number. The bank where Hector stashed the money is in the Grand Cayman Islands. The second I typed the password CODEOFSILENCE and the amount was displayed on the screen, I almost fell off my chair.</p><p>Six million, three hundred thousand. Dollars.</p><p>I had to refresh the screen a bunch of times to make sure it was right. And then looked at the name on the account just to make sure I read it right. Luis Salvatore Martinez Fuentes.</p><p>Whether I give Chuy the money or refuse to, my life is in danger.</p><p>After I left Derek\u2019s house, I went to Nikki. I had no intention of making love to her last night. I went to her hoping to convince her that I\u2019d given her up for good. I wanted to be an ass, to make it easier for her to move on and forget about me. I was going to tell her I was into Mariana, but the lie couldn\u2019t come out of my mouth.</p><p>Because I love the girl.</p><p>This morning I was tempted to ask her to run away with me and never look back. But I can\u2019t. I had to leave Nikki. Her mom thinks I\u2019m not good enough. I don\u2019t want to prove her right.</p><p>I head for the LB warehouse, ready to face Chuy. I may not be the guy Nikki deserves, but I\u2019m sure as hell not the guy Chuy wants me to be ... I\u2019m not Hector, and never will be.</p><p>I\u2019m Luis Fuentes. Nikki had complete faith in me that I could fix this. I\u2019m still skeptical, but I figure my odds are best if I take a chance on trusting the one person who might be the enemy. I pull out my cell and dial the number to Officer Reyes.</p><p>\u201cThis is Reyes,\u201d he answers.</p><p>I take a deep breath. \u201cIt\u2019s Luis Fuentes. I know you want to bust Chuy Soto, and I can help you. Before I do, I need to know if you want to ruin him because you\u2019re a cop, or because you\u2019re Fremont 5.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you talking about?\u201d he asks. The tension in his voice carries through the line.</p><p>\u201cReyes, I know mi\u2019am\u00e1 trusts you. But I saw your F5 tattoos, and I have to know if you\u2019re playin\u2019 us. Are you just a cop as a cover, so you can provide inside info to your crew?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLuis, I\u2019m not hiding anything from anyone. I used to be an F5 back in high school. I was in so fucking deep.\u201d He pauses, his voice flooding with anger. \u201cUntil my best friend got killed by a crackhead in a dirty alley in the city in a drug deal that went bad. His life was worth so much more than the payday the gang scored. That day I promised myself I\u2019d find a way out ... and when I did, I became a cop so I could stop other kids from making the same mistakes me and my friends did. I\u2019ve tried to bring down Soto, but he knows how to cover his tracks. Come to the station and you can tell me what you know.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t be sure he\u2019s telling me the truth, but my gut tells me to trust the guy. His story hits close to home. \u201cI can\u2019t come to the station, \u2019cause something\u2019s goin\u2019 down right now,\u201d I tell him. \u201cJust tape the conversation I\u2019m about to have and you\u2019ll get all the dirt to put him away for a long time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do anything stupid,\u201d Reyes starts to say, but I turn off the sound and stick the phone in my back pocket. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I\u2019ve got a duffel full of cash. Nobody is guarding the warehouse door, so I walk right in.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s about time,\u201d Chuy says. \u201cI was waiting for you. You managed to ditch my boys last night. Where were you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I thought that was any of your business, I wouldn\u2019t have ditched them.\u201d The last thing I\u2019d do is let Chuy or Marco know I was with Nikki. The Blood and Nikki are two separate parts of my life, and I\u2019ll do everything in my power to keep it that way.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a wiseass,\u201d Chuy says. \u201cAnd you haven\u2019t proven that you can be trusted.\u201d He nods to the duffel. \u201cOr have you?\u201d</p> <p>I toss the duffel to him. Just as he unzips the top and digs inside, my brothers barge into the room like a SWAT team.</p><p>Alex and Carlos are both here, ready to fight. Not a good idea. I\u2019ve got this all figured out, and having them here is screwing everything up. If we get busted, or bullets go flying, I need my brothers out of here.</p><p>\u201cWell, well ... it\u2019s a Fuentes family reunion,\u201d Chuy says. \u201cNice of you to join us.\u201d</p><p>No, it wasn\u2019t. What the hell is going on? How did they know I\u2019d be here, unless Reyes tipped them off? I turn to my brothers and say, \u201cAlex, get the fuck out of here ... and take Carlos with you. I don\u2019t need you guys here.\u201d</p><p>Carlos limps inside the room until he\u2019s standing next to me. \u201cWhat, you think we were gonna let you meet with Chuy on your own? No way.\u201d</p> <p>Shit. \u201cThis is not how this was supposed to go down.\u201d</p><p>Chuy pulls out a gun and points it at Alex. \u201cMaybe it was,\u201d he says, unfazed. \u201cThis is my lucky day. I get to kill the entire Fuentes family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou forget that I have millions that I can turn over to the cops, or give to you,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Chuy says. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019ll kill you last, while you\u2019re watchin\u2019 your brothers die. Or you can save yourself and give me the info I need. I\u2019m God in Fairfield. You don\u2019t believe me, just ask your cousin Enrique ... Oh, yeah, you can\u2019t. I smoked him this mornin\u2019 when he wouldn\u2019t tell me where you were. Loyalty, guys. You\u2019re not loyal, you die. Period. Loyalty to the LB comes before loyalty to family.\u201d</p><p>No. Not Enrique. My stomach lurches.</p><p>With his free hand, Chuy pulls up a picture on his phone ... of Enrique lying on the floor of his body shop with blood pooled around his head.</p> <p>\u201cEnrique didn\u2019t know where I was!\u201d I yell. \u201cHe was the most loyal Blood you\u2019d ever have, you pendejo.\u201d</p><p>Alex pulls out a gun and points it at Chuy. \u201cPut the gun down or I\u2019ll kill you.\u201d</p><p>Chuy laughs. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t, Alex. I know you. You haven\u2019t got it in you to kill someone. Besides, I\u2019ve got a chica named Nikki who\u2019s beggin\u2019 for her life right about now.\u201d</p><p>What! I feel like he just punched me in the gut and the wind got knocked out of me. He could have stabbed me with a knife and it would hurt less. \u201cYou hurt Nikki and I swear I\u2019ll kill you with my own hands,\u201d I growl.</p><p>Chuy shrugs. \u201cPut the gun down, Alex, or Luis\u2019s little girlfriend has a tragic accident. If I don\u2019t call my guys and let them know I\u2019ve secured the money, she\u2019ll find herself in the Des Plaines river ... tied to a big rock that sinks all the way to the bottom.\u201d</p><p>Alex slowly puts the gun down and kicks it over to him.</p><p>Chuy looks to Carlos. \u201cYou might as well give up yours, too.\u201d</p><p>A very pissed-off Carlos takes a gun from beneath his shirt and tosses it onto Chuy\u2019s desk.</p> <p>\u201cAnd what about yours?\u201d Chuy asks me. \u201cThe one I gave you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI left it at home,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>\u201cProve it. Lift up your shirt and turn around real slow.\u201d After I do, he says, \u201cTime to give me the numbers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet my brothers go,\u201d I tell him. \u201cThis is between you and me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Chuy says. \u201cThis is between me and all of you. You\u2019re in this together as far as I\u2019m concerned.\u201d</p><p>This is not happening. Despite all I\u2019ve risked to keep them safe, I\u2019ve managed to jeopardize my brothers\u2019 lives, and Nikki\u2019s. \u201cIf I give you the codes, you have to promise to let my brothers and Nikki go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was bluffin\u2019 about Nikki.\u201d Chuy laughs. \u201cI guess I should play more poker, huh? The first lesson in battle is knowin\u2019 the weakness of your enemies. Nikki is your weakness, Luis. You shouldn\u2019t have spilled the truth to Marco about how much you cared about the girl. I\u2019ll give you a hint ... he\u2019s not really your friend. He got close to you because I told him to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know your weakness,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMoney. You want it, and I have it. You hurt my brothers, you\u2019ll never see another cent.\u201d</p><p>Chuy holds up the gun and points it at Alex. \u201cI\u2019m gonna call your bluff.\u201d</p><p>I hold my breath as Alex holds his hand out, stopping me and Carlos from running in front of him. He knows we\u2019ll do it; we\u2019ll take a bullet and die for him.</p><p>Alex stands straight and tall, staring into the barrel of Chuy\u2019s gun.</p><p>A shot rings out. Shit. No! But wait, Alex is still standing. Even he looks surprised as he stares at Chuy with a red stain on his shirt that\u2019s growing bigger and bigger. Chuy was shot and clutches his shoulder as he collapses.</p><p>I look to Carlos, sure he had another gun stashed in his pants. But he\u2019s just looking at Chuy, stunned. He doesn\u2019t have a gun in his hand.</p><p>I look behind me. The shooter is standing in the doorway, the smoking gun shaking in her hand.</p><p>Nikki.</p><p>She drops the gun. She\u2019s hyperventilating as I pull her into my arms. \u201cI couldn\u2019t let him hurt you ... I had to ...,\u201d she cries out.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s still alive,\u201d Alex says, swiping the gun away from Chuy\u2019s hand.</p><p>I hear police sirens and pull Nikki close, telling her it\u2019ll be okay even though I\u2019m shaking as hard as she is.</p><p>Reyes barges in, with his gun at the ready. The guy is sweating and breathes a sigh of relief as he eyes the scene. A few other officers surround Chuy and call for an ambulance.</p><p>\u201cShit, Luis. What the hell were you thinking?\u201d Reyes yells after they stabilize Chuy and take him away on a stretcher. \u201cYou all could have been killed.\u201d He points aggressively at Alex. \u201cI told you to give me the address to this place, then stay put. What the fuck are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>Alex shrugs. \u201cListen, Reyes, once we realized what was goin\u2019 down, we weren\u2019t about to let our brother face Chuy on his own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s our blood,\u201d Carlos explains, then pats me on the back. \u201cThe kind that matters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need to find out if Enrique\u2019s okay,\u201d I say. \u201cWhat if he ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI already sent a squad car to check out Enrique\u2019s Auto Body,\u201d Reyes says. He hesitates. \u201cIt\u2019s not good news.\u201d</p><p>I squeeze my eyes shut, wondering when the violence will ever stop. Sometimes I think Ben is right, that the fantasy world is better because reality sucks ... but then I look at Nikki and I believe we can beat the odds.</p><p>Reyes makes us all go down to the police station to give our statements, and we\u2019re released to our parents after the district attorney is called in to listen to the taped phone conversation. No charges are filed against us, and the money in the duffel and the offshore account are handed over to the police. Nikki explained that the gun was Marco\u2019s ... when they were together he\u2019d shown her the place by the railroad tracks where the LB hid their guns. Marco had told Nikki that he was there when Enrique died and he knew what Chuy had planned at the warehouse. He was called into the station and charged as an accessory to murder.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re shakin\u2019,\u201d I tell Nikki as I hold her two weeks later. We\u2019re sitting on the couch in her living room while her mother periodically checks in on us. She\u2019s not thrilled we\u2019re still together, but she\u2019s warming up to the idea slowly. Ben told us that we\u2019ve inspired a new game he\u2019s working on ... with us as the main characters.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so glad you\u2019re here,\u201d Nikki says, wrapping her arms around me and squeezing tight. \u201cI have a secret that I haven\u2019t told you.\u201d She looks up at me, her expressive chocolate eyes a window to her Latina soul. I couldn\u2019t look away even if I wanted to. \u201cI applied to Purdue a week ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I ask, smiling for the first time since I left her at the beach.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Who else besides me is going to keep you out of trouble?\u201d</p><p>This girl is my angel. From the first moment I laid eyes on her I remember thinking that God sent her down to earth just for me. She believed in me when I didn\u2019t even believe in myself. \u201cNik, I love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she says, then taps her heart with her fingers. \u201cI feel it in here. I don\u2019t need the words to prove what you\u2019ve already showed me. I\u2019d do it all over, you know. The good and the bad ... it was all worth it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d do it all over, too ... but if that ever happens, hold back from kneeing me in the nuts. I\u2019m sure our future children will appreciate it.\u201d</p><p>She leans away from me and her eyebrows shoot up. \u201cOur future children? Luis, don\u2019t get ahead of yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d I ask her. \u201cDoesn\u2019t the thought of marryin\u2019 me give you an adrenaline rush?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she says, kissing me. \u201cYeah, it does. You once told me that I make you believe in the impossible. You make me believe in love, which I\u2019d given up on. Thank you for proving to me it\u2019s not just a fairy tale.\u201d</p><p>50</p><p>Nikki</p><p>Seven months after the shooting, three weeks until we graduate, I look at Luis across our chemistry table. Derek is talking to him, but he\u2019s not listening. I know this because he just gave me a wink/smile combo that reminds me of the first time we ever met. I knew the boy was cocky.</p><p>What I didn\u2019t know is that I\u2019d fall in love with him.</p><p>\u201cNikki, are you paying attention?\u201d Mrs. Peterson, now the mother of a little girl, says as she waves a hand in front of my eyes.</p><p>\u201cTo what?\u201d</p><p>Luis laughs.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s so funny, Mr. Fuentes? We\u2019re working with acid. Paying attention is crucial. Please keep your relationship out of my classroom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, Mrs. P.,\u201d Luis mumbles as he focuses on the task at hand.</p><p>Mariana and I take a beaker and follow the instructions. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you two are still together,\u201d she grumbles. \u201cIt\u2019s not gonna last, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t bet against us, if I were you,\u201d I tell her as I take a dropper and put a small drop of acid on a piece of paper and examine what happens.</p><p>I feel Luis\u2019s eyes on me, so I look up. He licks his lips suggestively. I would roll my eyes, but instead decide to give him a wink/smile back and lick my own lips to throw him off balance.</p><p>\u201cDude!\u201d Derek yells. \u201cYou just spilled acid on your arm!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My eyes go wide as Luis sucks in a breath, then curses in Spanish as he rushes to the emergency shower in the back of the classroom. I run after him in a panic.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d I ask.</p><p>He\u2019s under the shower, rinsing the acid off. \u201cChica, you distracted me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry. I didn\u2019t mean to.\u201d</p> <p>He smiles weakly. \u201cYeah, you did. I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>I breathe a sigh of relief. \u201cI could never forgive myself if you were permanently scarred.\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Peterson appears beside me. \u201cDo I need to call an ambulance?\u201d she asks, examining his arm and the red puffiness forming where the acid touched his skin.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Luis says. \u201cI\u2019m okay now. It was just a drop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m banning you from this experiment and instead assigning you a twenty-five-page paper on acid.\u201d She points to me. \u201cYou too, young lady. And I\u2019m changing your seats so you two are not facing each other. When are you two going to stop getting in trouble? Soon, I hope. It\u2019s a good thing I already had my baby or you would have just scared me enough to send me into labor.\u201d</p> <p>She storms out of the room.</p><p>\u201cCome here,\u201d Luis says, motioning for me to join him under the spray of the shower.</p><p>I step under the showerhead and in seconds I\u2019m as soaked as he is. \u201cWhat if Mrs. P. comes back here and catches us?\u201d I ask as he bends his head down to kiss me. \u201cYou know about her zero tolerance policy. It\u2019s in the school policy manual, you know.\u201d</p><p>He kisses me while the water sprays us. \u201cI\u2019ve got insider knowledge about that zero tolerance policy,\u201d he says against my lips.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d I whisper as I hear the final bell ring.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s bluffin\u2019,\u201d he says. \u201cShe wants all of us to graduate.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019m about to ask him where he got this insider knowledge when Mrs. Peterson appears in the doorway. \u201cAre you two still in here?\u201d she asks, rolling her eyes at the sight of us. She cocks an eyebrow. \u201cYou are seriously testing my patience. Luis, dry off with that towel on the rack and go to the nurse\u2019s office to have your arm checked out. Nikki ...\u201d She sighs. \u201cWhat are you doing in here with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a really good question,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cShe was helping me,\u201d Luis says.</p><p>\u201cWith what?\u201d Mrs. Peterson asks impatiently, then puts up a hand. \u201cOn second thought, don\u2019t answer that.\u201d She shakes a finger at Luis.</p><p>\u201cYou Fuentes boys are nothing but a pain in my rear. If you and your brothers ever have more children, make sure they go to another school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFairfield is home,\u201d Luis tells her with a cocky grin. \u201cAnd the best place to raise a family. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if all of our kids went to Fairfield High. Admit it, Mrs. P. You know you\u2019d love that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but ...\u201d Mrs. Peterson looks up at the ceiling and puts her palms together as if she\u2019s praying.</p><p>\u201cNo need to stress over it now,\u201d Luis tells her. \u201cYou\u2019ve got about sixteen years before you\u2019ll have my nephew, Paco, in your class.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat are the chances he\u2019ll be more interested in my chemistry class than girls?\u201d she responds.</p><p>\u201cSlim to none,\u201d Luis answers as he puts his arm around me. \u201cHe is a Fuentes, after all.\u201d</p><p>Epilogue</p><p>TWENTY-SIX YEARS LATER</p><p>Luis and Nikki hadn\u2019t been prepared when the fertility doctor broke the news that Nikki was pregnant with triplets. They were even more shocked when they found out they were having three boys. Life has been eventful for them over the last eighteen years, with triplets who are distinctly different from one another.</p><p>Their son Enrique is so wrapped up in playing the violin and wanting to be the youngest member of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra that he doesn\u2019t have time to get in trouble. Then there\u2019s Juan, who is just like his uncle Ben. Juan is a gamer and an avid reader, preferring to live out his adventures in fantasy worlds created by game designers.</p><p>Luis and Nikki\u2019s biggest challenge right now is Luis, Jr.\u2014or Junior, as everyone calls him. He is competitive and hot-tempered, which reminds Luis of Carlos. Junior is a charismatic and good-looking kid. When he walks into a room, heads turn\u2014reminding Luis of Alex. Unfortunately, Junior is also too smart and cocky for his own good, which reminds Luis of himself at eighteen.</p><p>Junior is also an incredible athlete. At the age of five he begged his parents for hockey skates after watching the Chicago Blackhawks win the Stanley Cup. At the age of ten, he was playing goalie for the AAA travel hockey team. Now, in his senior year of high school, Junior\u2019s team has made it all the way to the state championships.</p><p>On the day of the championship game, Junior is nervous, more nervous than he\u2019d been when his dad spent four months on the international space station two years ago. Junior wants to win this game badly. He knows college scouts will be attending, and he desperately hopes to play college hockey and eventually get drafted into the NHL.</p><p>Junior came to the rink early today so he can run drills before the other players take the ice. He sits on the locker room bench after stripping off his street clothes. This is going to be the biggest game of his hockey career. He knows it, and his family knows it. All of his uncles and cousins are coming to the game ... even Uncle Carlos and Aunt Kiara have flown in with his cousins from Colorado to attend the game. It will be one hell of a night, ending with him either celebrating his ass off with a win or depressed as hell with a loss.</p><p>Junior reaches into his hockey bag to pull out his equipment just as a girl barges into the locker room\u2014without knocking. If Junior were self-conscious or insecure, he\u2019d probably have pulled out his jersey and held it over his briefs.</p><p>But he isn\u2019t.</p><p>The hot mamacita standing in the doorway has long, straight hair that falls in her face and thick, pouty lips that belong on a movie star. He bets she\u2019s a groupie of the Giants\u2019 first-string goalie, Dale Jacoby, who bragged about the number of girls he dated and screwed in the locker rooms of various rinks around the country. Junior had played on the same team with Jacoby when they were kids. Now they were opponents from rival high schools who were about to play against each other in the state championships.</p><p>Jacoby was in the news recently because he was handpicked by the Olympic hockey coach to try out for the US Olympic team. Junior wasn\u2019t jealous. At least that\u2019s what he told himself when he\u2019d heard the news.</p><p>Obviously the bimbo standing in the doorway is thinking this is either the girls\u2019 bathroom or a place to meet Jacoby for a quickie before the game.</p><p>\u201cLocker rooms are for players only,\u201d Junior tells the bimbo, annoyed.</p><p>\u201cDuh,\u201d she says with attitude, walking farther into the room. Junior glances up and notices that she\u2019s carrying a hockey bag and has goalie pads slung across her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t Jacoby carry his own equipment?\u201d Junior asks her.</p><p>The girl sets down the bag and pads in the middle of the room, right in front of his. \u201cI\u2019m sure he could, if he hadn\u2019t broken his leg at a party last night.\u201d</p><p>What? Jacoby broke his leg? Junior hadn\u2019t heard a word about it. He knew less than nothing about the Giants\u2019 new second-string goalie, who he\u2019d never played against. \u201cSo who\u2019s playin\u2019 in his place?\u201d</p><p>The girl unzips the bag and pulls out a neck guard and chest protector. \u201cYou\u2019re looking at her.\u201d</p><p>Junior can\u2019t help the laugh that escapes from his mouth. \u201cYou\u2019re a girl.\u201d</p><p>She quickly glances at the bulge in his briefs. \u201cAnd you\u2019re a boy. Now that we\u2019ve got that straight, I\u2019ll just let you know that I would use a girls\u2019 locker room, but they don\u2019t have one at this rink. And the other locker room is being cleaned for the next half hour ... I guess there was a peeing contest in there when the Pee Wee league played this morning. They told me to dress in here. Just keep your eyes to yourself.\u201d</p><p>Junior looks at her, stunned. \u201cDon\u2019t the Giants have a second-string goalie named Frankie Yates?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEver hear of female hockey players?\u201d she asks him, clearly annoyed. \u201cOr have you lived in a cave your entire life? My name is Franchesca Yates ... Frankie for short.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t lived in a cave, chica,\u201d Junior tells her. \u201cI\u2019m all for girl hockey players, especially ones as hot as you.\u201d</p><p>Her face scrunches up, like she\u2019s smelling something really bad. \u201cAre you ... hitting on me?\u201d</p><p>She walks up to him then, standing toe to toe. She isn\u2019t as tall or muscular as he is, but she definitely stands straight and confident. He likes confidence in a girl, but this one needs to be brought down a peg. Part of playing hockey is psyching out your opponents before the game and talking trash during the game. It\u2019s tradition. Just because Frankie Yates is a girl doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s exempt from the same treatment he\u2019d give to Jacoby.</p><p>He\u2019d just psych her out in a different way, because she\u2019s a girl.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you say we get together after the game?\u201d Junior tells her as he reaches out and fingers a strand of her hair. He knows he\u2019s affecting her just like he affects a lot of girls ... he can tell by the way her breath hitches as his fingers accidentally brush against her cheek. \u201cI can, you know, console you when you lose.\u201d</p><p>Before he has time to blink, the girl clocks him. Her fist lands solidly on his lip. She obviously has brothers who taught her how to fight.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell ...,\u201d he says, swiping his now busted lip with the back of his hand and seeing blood.</p><p>She backs away and shrugs. \u201cDon\u2019t mess with me, Fuentes. And if you think you\u2019ve got an easy win ahead of you, think again. I\u2019ve seen you play before, and I wasn\u2019t that impressed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ve never seen you play, so you\u2019re obviously not used to playin\u2019 with the big boys.\u201d</p><p>She laughs in a mocking tone. \u201cI\u2019m a transfer student from Minnesota, Fuentes. Minnesota. You know, that little state that breeds NHL players. Hockey is in our blood. I\u2019ve played with girls who can skate circles around you, so it\u2019s you who\u2019ll need consoling tonight. I\u2019m just guessing that getting beaten by a girl will crush that overblown ego of yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBring it,\u201d Junior says, then puts on his gear and walks out. Who the hell was she, anyway? He\u2019d never even seen her play, so how good could she be?</p><p>Junior\u2019s dad and his uncles are standing outside the locker room, waiting for him.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to your lip?\u201d his uncle Alex asks him. \u201cIt\u2019s bleedin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>Uncle Carlos laughs. \u201cI thought hockey players fought on the ice, not off of it.\u201d</p><p>Before Junior can answer, Yates walks out of the locker room in full gear. \u201cGood luck, Junior. You\u2019ll need it,\u201d she says, then taps him on his equipment-padded butt with her goalie stick as she passes him.</p><p>Junior points to her. \u201cCan you believe I have to play against that bitch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you do to her?\u201d his father asks him, eyeing his bloody lip. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNothin\u2019.\u201d When his father obviously doesn\u2019t believe him, Junior adds, \u201cOkay, I guess I was talkin\u2019 trash ... and maybe I touched her hair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuess she taught you a lesson, huh?\u201d his father says.</p><p>A lesson. The last thing Junior wants is to be taught a lesson by the goalie of his rival team. Junior watches her long, blond ponytail sway back and forth against the name YATES on the back of her jersey as she struts down the corridor to the ice. He\u2019d never thought it was possible to strut with hockey gear and skates on, but Yates sure as hell does it ... and does it well.</p><p>After Luis and his brothers exchange knowing looks, they laugh.</p> <p>Luis met Nikki when he was fifteen, fell in love with her when he was eighteen, and married her when he was twenty-three. The first time they\u2019d met, she\u2019d kneed him in the nuts.
