Rose Langley walked barefoot on the beach, looking up at the splendor in the sky. She had no idea what had caused this beautiful spectacle; she just knew she\u2019d never seen anything like it. It was a large and shimmering half crescent, and behind it, like a silent and glowing echo, was a second half crescent. Once upon a time, she might have gone to her tutor, Mr. Moreno\u2014so old, soft-spoken and wise\u2014and asked him where such an intriguing sky had come from. He would have studied it and perhaps told her that one of the other planets was aligned with the moon. Or, perhaps, he might have said it was an illusion created by cloud cover or by tiny dewdrops in the air that didn\u2019t quite become rain.</p> <p>But, of course, she couldn\u2019t ask Mr. Moreno anything. She\u2019d given him up, along with anything that resembled decency and a respectable life when she\u2019d become convinced that her father was cruel and unreasonable, incapable of seeing what a wonderful, illustrious man Taylor Grant would prove to be.</p><p>She\u2019d run away from the gentility of her home in New Orleans, certain that Taylor loved her and that her world with him would be wonderful.</p><p>She tried to think only of the moon and feel its enchantment. But she could hear the men back at the saloon. Pirate\u2019s Cove\u2014an apt name for a saloon, since Galveston Island had first been settled by the pirate Lafitte. Lafitte was long gone. Older men, remnants of the pirate\u2019s day, still sat in the bar, where they drank and cursed and spoke of the days of Spanish rule and French rule, Spanish rule again and the coming independence of Texas. It was all talk. Galveston was a rising port city, and there were plenty of ill-gotten gains to be found here. Maybe a few of the men would be leaving to take up arms for Texas, but for the most part, they were lecherous miscreants who seemed to sit around all day drinking, smelling worse and worse by the hour. And they\u2019d get Taylor drinking, and he\u2019d have no money, and he\u2019d convince them to pay for her services\u2014and convince her that they\u2019d pass out as soon as they were alone with her. They generally did, though not always quickly enough... . She winced, staring up at the moon. She would feel sweaty and horrid, and the stench of them would stay with her long after they\u2019d passed out, and even walking into the waters of the bay would not erase that stench.</p><p>She could hear the laughter and the curses and the bawdy remarks. And sometimes, she could hear the feigned laughter of one of the saloon whores\u2014women who were mostly old and used up, who poured on the perfume and accepted small amounts of money and whiskey or rum for their quick services.</p><p>Taylor had turned her into one of them.</p> <p>Tears stung her eyes. She tried to pretend she\u2019d never left home and she was just a young woman walking on a beach beneath a whimsical moon. But it didn\u2019t change a thing. And it couldn\u2019t ease the pain that suddenly filled her.</p><p>She still loved Taylor. After everything he had done to her. She was such a fool!</p><p>\u201cRose!\u201d</p><p>The sound of his excited cry made her turn. Taylor had come out of the saloon, and he was running toward her. She saw, as he breathlessly reached her, that his eyes were glittering.</p><p>His excitement, however, was no longer contagious to her.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it, Taylor?\u201d she asked him.</p> <p>\u201cFinally! Finally, I\u2019ve made the play that will get us out of here. Rose, my darling Rose, look at this!\u201d</p><p>He produced a ring.</p><p>She remembered jewelry. She remembered good jewelry, like the cross her father had bought on a business trip to Italy, and the beautiful little pearl-drop earrings her mother had given her on her fourteenth birthday. She\u2019d never owned magnificent pieces, just the gold and semiprecious gems that were the cherished items of a young girl on a working plantation.</p><p>Still, she knew good jewelry.</p><p>And this piece was far more than simply good. It was probably worth her father\u2019s entire plantation. The glowing illumination of the strange moon picked up on the brilliance of the diamond in the delicate gold setting. The diamond was multifaceted, shimmering with an assortment of colors; it had to be five carats, if not more.</p><p>And it seemed to have a life of its own. It was almost as if the fiery brilliance of the gem burned in her hand.</p><p>Rose stared at Taylor. He\u2019d been drinking, but he was sober. His beautiful blue eyes were on her with tenderness, and his lips\u2014weak lips, in a beautiful but weak jaw\u2014were curved into a loving and tremulous smile.</p><p>Yes, despite all that he had done to her, he loved her, really loved her.</p> <p>\u201cWhere did you get this?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI started playing poker, and the other fellows had taken their winnings and moved on, and I was still playing with old Marley\u2014you remember, the decrepit old man who says he sailed with Lafitte. He put this on the table, and he said Lafitte himself had called it the Galveston diamond. Once upon a time, it belonged to the Habsburg kings! It came off a Spanish ship Lafitte took in the days before the War of 1812. Rose! Marley swears Lafitte gave him the diamond, although he likely stole it. But that doesn\u2019t matter. He had it\u2014and we have it now. It\u2019s the key to our salvation. We can go anywhere. You never have to be with those old bastards again, and we don\u2019t have to sleep on a beach. We can get married, buy horses, join the Texans, make a land claim\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTaylor, Texas is going to war! We have to get out of here. And we\u2019ve got to do it tonight\u2014before someone realizes you have this.\u201d Rose felt his excitement, but despite its beauty, there was something about the gem she didn\u2019t like. She wanted to go\u2014right then. And she wanted them to sell the stone\u2014at whatever price. They\u2019d have to be paid enough to get by, but after that... The most important thing was that they escape now. Quickly. She was willing to leave what paltry items they had in the tiny room that was all they could afford and just run down the beach. Along with her own growing excitement, she felt a growing sense of danger.</p><p>Was it the diamond? Was it warning her\u2014or was it causing her fear?</p><p>\u201cOh, the others don\u2019t know about it, and even if they did, the thing is supposed to be cursed,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cIt seems the princesses or whoever had it died young. I\u2019ve got a bit more in winnings. We\u2019re going to buy horses and get out of here. We\u2019ll leave at first light. And if we can\u2019t buy land, we\u2019ll go back east. We\u2019ll go to Virginia or maybe all the way to New York!\u201d</p><p>For a moment, the curious moon appeared to be luminescent, shining down on them with the sweetest of blessings.</p><p>And then she heard a commotion, coming from the saloon.</p><p>\u201cTaylor, what\u2019s happening?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>There were men running toward them. She started to back away, but there was nowhere to run. This was an island. The beach stretched on for miles here and headed into bracken.</p><p>Nowhere to run.</p><p>\u201cThere he is. Get the bastard!\u201d one of the men shouted.</p><p>She felt pressure on her hand. Taylor was thrusting the ring into her grasp. She took it. And she knew that if these men were after the diamond, they would strip her down and search her on the beach. She pretended to push back a stray lock of hair and stuck the diamond in her chignon.</p><p>Her heart thundered. Five men had come out; one was Matt Meyer, known for scalping Indians in Tennessee. He was surrounded by his henchmen\u2014rough frontiersmen who\u2019d seen better days, but who had never lost their talent for brutality.</p><p>She stepped forward. \u201cGentlemen, what is the problem?\u201d she demanded. She moved past Taylor, praying they\u2019d hesitate before actually offering physical violence.</p><p>She was forgetting herself. And them.</p><p>Meyer grabbed her by the shoulders and threw her on the sand. \u201cCheater!\u201d he said to Taylor. \u201cWhere the hell is my watch and fob?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Taylor shrieked. \u201cI didn\u2019t cheat, and I don\u2019t have your watch and fob! I swear, I swear on all that\u2019s holy, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMen,\u201d Meyer said quietly.</p><p>They descended on Taylor. They beat him as they stripped him naked and left him half-dead in the sand. Rose cried out in horror, but her one attempt to stop them was quickly diverted as one of the men backhanded her in the face and sent her down again, her mind reeling.</p><p>\u201cHe ain\u2019t got it,\u201d another of the men finally said to Meyer.</p><p>And then, of course, they looked at Rose.</p><p>\u201cHe was telling the truth!\u201d Rose screamed in fury and despair. She staggered to her feet and stood as proudly as she could, with all the old disdain she could summon. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t have your watch or fob, never had it, and neither do I.\u201d She knew, however, that her protest would be in vain. And she was worried sick about Taylor. He lay bleeding and naked in the sand. She\u2019d heard him groan once; now he was silent.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve murdered him,\u201d she accused Meyer.</p><p>There was more commotion coming from the tavern. Others, hearing the fracas on the beach, were spilling out of the saloon.</p><p>\u201cTake the whore,\u201d Meyer said to his men. \u201cLet\u2019s move out of here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait! You can\u2019t just leave him!\u201d Rose sobbed. \u201cHe could be alive!\u201d</p><p>Meyer, who was a big man, perhaps forty, and strongly muscled, walked over to her and jerked her toward him. \u201cHow did you wind up with such a pathetic excuse for a man?\u201d Suddenly he smiled. \u201cAll those airs, my dear Miss Southern Belle! Well, well. I\u2019ll find out later if you\u2019ve got my property. Come on, boys, time to leave this island and move inward. If there\u2019s going to be a war, I think we\u2019ll be part of it. Hmm. And, Miss Southern Belle Rose, I guess you\u2019re going to be my whore now!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet go of me, you bastard!\u201d She had to play for time. People were streaming out of the saloon and she had to tell them Taylor was innocent and that these men had halfway killed him. It was one thing to have a fight, or even shoot at a man, but to do this, to gang up on someone and beat him so badly...</p><p>Meyer hauled back and hit her again with such force that she would\u2019ve fallen if he hadn\u2019t grabbed her. The world around her was whirling as Meyer tossed her over his shoulder. She tried to free herself, tried to protest, but his voice grated in her ears. \u201cYou want your boy to have a chance to live? Then shut up! You\u2019re with me now, Rose. Ah, yes, Miss Rose, you\u2019re with me. Think of the glory! We\u2019re on to fight for Texas!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He started to laugh.</p><p>For Texas...</p><p>She fought against his hold. She raised herself, clutching his shoulders, and for one moment, she saw the moon again. Or moons. Now there seemed to be ten of them swimming in the sky, still absurdly beautiful crescents.</p> <p>Then the moons all disappeared. Yet as her world faded to black, Rose could feel the gem somehow burning against her skin through the tight knot of hair.</p><p>Meyer, these men, didn\u2019t even know she had the diamond, but it had already destroyed her life.</p><p>Chapter One</p><p>San Antonio, Texas</p><p>April</p> <p>Logan Raintree had just left his house and was walking toward his car when the massive black thing swept before him with a fury and might that seemed to fill the air. He stopped short, not knowing what the hell he was seeing at first.</p><p>Then he saw it. The thing was a bird, and he quickly noted that it was a massive bird, a peregrine falcon. Its wingspan must have been a good three feet.</p><p>It had taken down a pigeon.</p><p>The pigeon was far beyond help. The falcon had already ripped the left wing from the creature and, mercifully, had broken the smaller bird\u2019s neck, as well.</p><p>As Logan stood there, the falcon stared at him. He stared back at the falcon.</p><p>He\u2019d seen attacks by such birds before; they had the tenacity of jays and the power of a bobcat.</p> <p>They also had the beaks and talons of their distant ancestors\u2014the raptors, who\u2019d once ravaged land and sea. This kind of bird could blind a man or, at the least, rip his face to shreds.</p><p>Logan stood dead still, maintaining his position as he continued to return the bird\u2019s cold, speculative stare. There seemed to be something in its eyes. Something that might exist in the eyes of the most brutal general, the most ruthless ruler. Touch my kill, and you die! the bird seemed to warn.</p><p>Logan didn\u2019t back away; he didn\u2019t move at all.</p><p>He knew birds, as he knew the temperament of most animals. If he ran away, the bird would think he should be attacked, just to make sure he did get away from the kill. Come forward and, of course, the bird would fight to protect it. He had to stay still, calm, assured, and not give ground. The falcon would respect that stance, take its prey and leave.</p><p>But the bird didn\u2019t leave. It watched Logan for another minute, then cast its head back and let out a shrieking cry. It took a step toward him.</p><p>Even feeling intimidated, Logan decided his best move was not to move... .</p><p>\u201cI have no fight with you, brother,\u201d he said quietly.</p><p>The bird let out another cry. It hopped back to the pigeon, looked at Logan and willfully ripped the second wing off, then spat it out and stared at Logan again.</p> <p>This was ridiculous, he thought. He\u2019d never seen a peregrine falcon so much as land in his driveway, much less pick a fight with him.</p><p>He reached with slow, nonthreatening movements for his gun belt and the Colt .45 holstered there; he had no desire to harm any creature, but neither would he be blinded by a bird that seemed to be harboring an overabundance of testosterone.</p><p>As if the bird had known what the gun was, it leaped back.</p><p>Logan had the gun aimed. \u201cI don\u2019t want to hurt you, brother bird,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if you force my hand, I will.\u201d</p><p>The bird seemed to understand him\u2014and to know he meant his words. It gave yet another raucous cry, jumped on the pigeon and soared into flight, taking its prey. Logan watched as the bird disappeared into the western sky.</p><p>Curious about the encounter and very surprised by it, he shook his head and turned toward his car again.</p><p>He took one step and paused, frowning.</p><p>It suddenly looked as if he\u2019d stepped into an Alfred Hitchcock movie.</p><p>The Birds.</p><p>They were everywhere. They covered the eaves of his house, the trees and the ground, everything around him. They sat on the hood and the roof of his car. Every bird native to the state of Texas seemed to be there, all of them just staring at him. Jays, doves, grackles, blackbirds, crows and even seabirds\u2014a pelican stood in the center of his lawn.</p><p>It was bizarre. He was being watched...stalked...by birds!</p><p>None made a move toward him.</p><p>As he started to walk, a sparrow flapped its wings, moving aside. He continued to his car, wings fluttering around him as the smaller birds made way. When he reached his car door, he opened it slowly, carefully, and then sat behind the wheel, closing the door. He revved the engine and heard scratching noises as the birds atop his car took flight.</p><p>Logan eased out of the driveway. As he did so, a whir of black rose with a furious flapping of wings. He blinked, and when he opened his eyes again, they were gone.</p><p>Every last bird was gone.</p><p>He looked back at his old mission-style house, wondering if he\u2019d somehow blacked out, had a vision, and yet managed to get into his car. But that was not the case. He didn\u2019t black out. For him, visions were dreams. They occurred only when he slept, and he usually laughed them away. His father\u2019s people believed that all dreams were omens, while his mother\u2019s father\u2014psychiatrist and philosopher William Douglas\u2014believed that dreams or \u201cvisions\u201d were arguments within the human psyche. In William\u2019s view, fears and anxiety created alternate worlds seen only in the mind; their role was to help resolve emotional conflicts.</p><p>Whichever approach was correct didn\u2019t matter much. He\u2019d seen what he had seen. This hadn\u2019t been a vision or a dream.</p><p>But it was odd that it had happened when he was on his way to meet with Jackson Crow, FBI agent and head of the mysterious Krewe of Hunters\u2014a unit both infamous and renowned.</p><p>San Antonio. It was different, that was all. Different.</p><p>Kelsey O\u2019Brien looked out the Longhorn Inn\u2019s kitchen window. From here, she could see the walls of the old chapel at the Alamo. The city was bustling, pleasantly warm now that it was spring, and the people she\u2019d met so far were friendly and welcoming.</p><p>She still felt like a fish out of water.</p><p>That\u2019s what she was missing\u2014the water.</p><p>She\u2019d been in San Antonio almost three days and they\u2019d been nice days. San Antonio was a beautiful city. Kelsey actually had a cousin living here, Sean Cameron, but he worked for a special-effects company, and they were currently out in the desert somewhere, trying to reproduce the Alamo as it had once been for a documentary. She was grateful that her old camp friend, Sandy Holly, had bought the historic inn and one-time saloon where she was staying. Sandy made her feel a bit less like a fish out of water, but it was strange not to be within steps of both the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico. Her life\u2014except for summer camp and college upstate\u2014had been spent in the Florida Keys. Where there was water. Lots and lots of water. Of course, they had the river here, and she loved the Riverwalk area, with its interesting places to go and dine and shop. The history of the city appealed to her, too.</p><p>It was just...different. And it was going to take some getting used to. Of course, she still had no idea what she was doing here, or if she was going to stay. She might not be in San Antonio long; on the other hand, she could be transferring here. And she might be taking on a different job.</p><p>She was a United States Marshal, which meant she worked for a service that might require her to go anywhere. She\u2019d certainly traveled in her life, but the concept that she could be moving here, making a life here, seemed unlikely\u2014not something she would have chosen. Now that it might be happening, she had to remind herself that she\u2019d always known she could be transferred. But her training had been in Miami, and because of her familiarity with Key West, where she had grown up, she\u2019d been assigned, as one of only two Marshals, to the office there. She\u2019d been doing the job for two years now, enjoying an easy camaraderie with Trent Fisher, her coworker. They reported in to the Miami office when required, and occasionally their Miami supervisor came down. Key West was small, and despite the friction that could exist between law enforcement agencies, she\u2019d quickly established excellent working relations with the police and the Coast Guard and the other state and federal agencies with which the two Marshals worked. And then...</p><p>Then she\u2019d suddenly ended up here. She was still wondering why, because Archie Lawrence, her supervisor, had been so vague.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to love the situation,\u201d Archie had assured her. \u201cYou go to this meeting, and then you\u2019ll have a two-week hiatus to decide what you feel about an offer you\u2019re going to receive. So, nothing is definite yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m being given a vacation so I can get an offer and think about it?\u201d That hardly seemed typical of the government. \u201cWhat\u2019s the offer?\u201d she\u2019d demanded.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what your meeting is about,\u201d he\u2019d said.</p><p>And no amount of indignant questioning or wheedling would convince him to share the details. If he even knew them... \u201cLook, your meeting is with an FBI agent and you may be transferring services,\u201d Archie had told her. \u201cThat\u2019s all I\u2019m at liberty to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d she\u2019d asked him. \u201cI don\u2019t want to change agencies!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, it\u2019s come down from the brass, kiddo, and it sounds unusual\u2014two federal agencies getting together on a friendly basis. Hallelujah!\u201d Archie rolled his eyes. \u201cNo one\u2019s going to force you to change. You\u2019re being presented with an opportunity. You can say no. I mean it. If you don\u2019t like this offer, you have the option to pack up and come home, with no harm done to your status here. So quit asking me questions. Go away. Don\u2019t darken my door\u2014for the time being, anyway. You have things to do, arrangements to make.\u201d He\u2019d sent her one of his lopsided grins. She liked Archie and considered him a great boss. He was always easygoing until he went into \u201csituation\u201d mode and then he could spew out orders faster and with more precision than the toughest drill sergeant.</p><p>Sometimes, of course, she wondered what Archie really thought of her. She was good at her job, although some of her methods were a bit unexpected. Luckily, a lot of criminals were still sexist. They didn\u2019t realize that a woman could and would hold them to task, shoot with uncanny aim and manage handcuffs with ease. But she\u2019d felt Archie\u2019s eyes on her a few times when she hadn\u2019t really been able to explain the intuition that had led to her discovery of a cache of drugs, a hiding place\u2014or a dead body. She even wondered if he was hoping she\u2019d take another position. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Today, soon, she\u2019d attend a meeting with a man from the FBI: He had an offer for her that presumably had to do with the unique abilities she\u2019d shown during her two years with the government, and due to the status of this particular branch of service, various government offices were cooperating. On the one hand, she felt like telling someone that if she\u2019d wanted to work for the FBI, she would have applied to the FBI. But she was curious, and she wasn\u2019t prone to be difficult; it was just the mystery of the situation.</p><p>Law enforcement agencies were not known for their cooperation\u2014rather sad, really, since they were all working toward the same goal. That was one of the reasons she\u2019d loved working in Key West; they had plenty to deal with, but they were smaller, and thus got along fairly well. Drugs were constantly out on the waterways. The Coast Guard was overworked, ditto the state police and the county police. The cops in Key West loved the Marshals. It had all been pretty good. State police, Monroe County police, the Coast Guard and the U.S. Marshal\u2019s Office, all getting along, most of them meeting for a beer here and there on Duval Street or some off-the-tourist track location. In her case, it had probably helped that she\u2019d gone to the University of Miami and done an internship with the U.S. Marshal\u2019s Office. She\u2019d zeroed in on her chosen profession early. And she\u2019d expected to stay in south Florida.</p><p>To contemplate a life here, in Texas, was just...strange.</p> <p>Nothing wrong with Texas, of course.</p><p>But she had it all figured out. It was the water. In San Antonio, there was no coast. There was the river, though.</p><p>She glanced at her watch. Two hours until her meeting.</p><p>When she looked out the window again, she nearly jumped. In those few seconds, a massive crow had landed on the outer sill. The damned thing seemed to be staring at her. She waved a hand at it.</p><p>The bird didn\u2019t fly away. It continued to stare.</p> <p>Then it pecked the window.</p><p>She almost stepped back, then didn\u2019t. She scowled at the bird. \u201cI\u2019m a United States Marshal, and I will not be intimated by a bird!\u201d she said aloud.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>Kelsey swung around. Sandy Holly had come breezing into the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cYou have really big, aggressive birds around here,\u201d Kelsey said.</p><p>\u201cWe do?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, look!\u201d</p><p>When she turned to the window again, the crow was gone. It bothered Kelsey to realize that the bird disturbed her. Ah, well, she had discovered earlier that one of the men she\u2019d be meeting was Agent Crow. Maybe that knowledge had made the bird\u2019s appearance seem like something more\u2014like some kind of omen, for good or...</p><p>Sandy smiled, raising her eyebrows. \u201cAnyone would think you were trying not to like Texas,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cNo, no, I love Texas. Texas is great,\u201d Kelsey told her.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you\u2019re just a little nervous. This is the big day, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is it,\u201d Kelsey agreed. Sandy Holly was proving to be a true friend. Kelsey had gotten to know her almost twenty years ago, when they\u2019d been a pair of awkward eight-year-olds at the West Texas dude ranch Kelsey\u2019s parents had been sure she\u2019d want to attend. But she\u2019d been terrified of horses, while Sandy was terrified of being alone. Sandy had ridden before, even at five, because...because she was a Texan from San Antonio. Texans rode horses and wore big hats. So, at eight, Kelsey had toughened up enough to tell Sandy she didn\u2019t need to be homesick, and Sandy had promised Kelsey she\u2019d learn to love horses. She did, Kelsey mused. Thanks to Sandy, she\u2019d become an excellent rider. And, thanks to Sandy, she\u2019d known where she wanted to stay when she came to San Antonio. The Longhorn Inn and Saloon.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t as if they\u2019d seen each other frequently. After a few years, they had skipped camps of any kind. But they\u2019d met with other friends in Vegas to celebrate their respective twenty-first birthdays and kept up with each other through Facebook and email. When she\u2019d first talked about applying to be a U.S. Marshal, Sandy had encouraged her.</p><p>Kelsey was particularly glad to be here because Sandy wasn\u2019t in great shape at the moment\u2014taking over the old inn had proven to be a monumental task, and there were problems Sandy had hinted about that Kelsey didn\u2019t entirely understand. They hadn\u2019t really had a chance to sit down and talk, since Sandy was running a business, which meant her time was limited. It was even more limited because she\u2019d lost a manager the week before\u2014the young man simply hadn\u2019t shown up for work\u2014and while Sandy had a great housekeeping staff of three, the organizational and hostessing duties had all fallen to her. Of course, as Kelsey well knew, Sandy could be high-strung, and she wondered if working for her friend wasn\u2019t a little stressful. On the plus side, Sandy did like to hire college guys who needed a break on a r\u00e9sum\u00e9. None of them seemed to last too long, however.</p> <p>Sandy walked over to some controls on the kitchen wall and squinted as she looked at them. \u201cHmm. I\u2019m going to hope this turns on the music and doesn\u2019t open the storm windows,\u201d she said, twisting the dial.</p><p>Country rock filled the air.</p><p>\u201cI think you got it,\u201d Kelsey told her.</p><p>\u201cHow about some coffee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can actually sit for a few minutes?\u201d Kelsey asked. \u201cAnd tell me what\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>Sandy poured coffee into cups and set them on the table, shrugging. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing really wrong. The past few days around here have been tense, that\u2019s all. People are so ridiculous!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, explain, will you?\u201d</p><p>Sandy let out a long sigh. \u201cIt\u2019s just this haunted thing about the inn. I sometimes wonder if I was crazy or what to get involved with it, even though I like a ghost story as much as anyone. Well, you know I\u2019ve wanted this place for years. I\u2019ve always been fascinated by the history\u2014especially what happened to Rose Langley.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe poor girl who was killed right before the fall of the Alamo?\u201d Kelsey asked.</p><p>Sandy nodded. \u201cRose was killed by her lover\u2014or pimp, depending on how you want to look at it\u2014in Room 207. It\u2019s a sad story about a good girl gone wrong. She took off from her parents\u2019 home because she was madly in love with Taylor Grant, and when they were in Galveston, she ended up being more or less kidnapped by a notorious bad guy named Matt Meyer, who wounded Grant. She might have fought Meyer and gained time for help, but she seems to have been afraid he\u2019d finish Grant off if she didn\u2019t go with him. So, the revolution was about to begin, and Meyer wanted to fight for Texas. They came here, and apparently, Rose and Matt Meyer got into a terrible fight, and he murdered her. He\u2019d been known to kill, so it wasn\u2019t a surprise. We wouldn\u2019t just consider him a criminal today, we\u2019d consider him to be as sick and perverted as the most heinous killer out there. Oh\u2014and, of course, he took off before the battle of the Alamo, or before anything resembling the law could catch up with him. But...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how much of this you remember from my emails,\u201d Sandy said. \u201cI had just bought the place\u2014money down, no way out\u2014when all of a sudden there were problems. I was already in here, deciding what to do about renovating a week or so before the closing, when a girl named Sierra Monte disappeared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I remember. But remind me what she was doing here, when the inn was in the middle of changing owners,\u201d Kelsey said.</p><p>\u201cPeter Ghent, the last owner, still had the place until closing. That\u2019s how it works. I\u2019d gotten a deal because there was no return on the down payment if anything went wrong. Anything. Ghent had some of the rooms rented, but he was like an absentee landlord. Sierra came here, apparently, because she wanted Room 207. Go figure. The rooms were super-cheap, even though it was a historic property, because Ghent wasn\u2019t running it well. The bar sucked! It was all falling apart and I\u2019d just started to renovate. But Sierra Monte insisted on staying. Anyway, she disappeared. A maid found blood everywhere and then the cops came in\u2014but there was no body. And, of course, she disappeared from Room 207, so the legend continued to grow. I closed down for a bit when I took over to get the renovations finished. And then I didn\u2019t rent out the room at all afterward but the mystery of the place encourages people to come in. You know how that goes. Now people are clamoring for 207. I\u2019m careful who I give it to, though, because I\u2019m afraid of some idiot freaking out in the middle of the night and jumping out the window or something! It\u2019s hard to read people over the phone or through the internet, but, like I said, I\u2019m careful. It\u2019s rented out now\u2014only because I have a big ol\u2019 rodeo cowboy staying in it.\u201d</p><p>Kelsey winced. \u201cI know what you\u2019re saying. At the Hard Rock in Hollywood, Florida, people vie for the room where Anna Nicole Smith died. And people book way ahead for the \u2018murder room\u2019 at the Lizzie Borden house in Fall River, Massachusetts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly!\u201d Sandy said. \u201cBut now, the stories about Room 207 are scaring people away from the inn, not bringing them in!\u201d</p><p>As if to confirm Sandy\u2019s words, a high-pitched scream pierced the hum of easy-listening music. Kelsey had just picked up her mug, but the earsplitting cry of terror startled her so badly that coffee sloshed over the brim. She leaped to her feet, staring at Sandy.</p><p>Sandy stared back at her, stricken, shaking her head. Kelsey set her mug on the table and went flying out to the inn\u2019s grand salon\u2014now its lobby\u2014looking around for the source of the scream.</p><p>It came again, stretching long and loud, and Kelsey raced toward it.</p><p>When he reached the riverfront area and parked, Logan was still mulling over the strange behavior of the birds. He knew that the Native American half of the family\u2014no matter how \u201cmodern\u201d or forward-thinking they might be\u2014would see omens in the situation. He couldn\u2019t help wondering about it himself.</p><p>But he had to put it out of his mind.</p><p>Logan had been told by his captain that this meeting was important. In that case, he wasn\u2019t quite sure why he was meeting an FBI agent beneath a brightly colored umbrella on the Riverwalk. It wasn\u2019t that he had anything against the Riverwalk; it just didn\u2019t seem like the place for an important meeting. Tourists thronged the area, along with locals. The shopping included both high-end boutiques and Texas souvenir shops, and the restaurants were varied as well as plentiful. He loved the river; watching water always seemed to improve anything. Still, this was unusual. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He wasn\u2019t surprised that he was noticed\u2014and hailed\u2014by many people. He\u2019d spent his life in San Antonio, and he\u2019d been called on during many a \u201csituation\u201d at the riverfront, so he knew a number of bartenders, shopkeepers and restaurant owners. Of course, the tourists and visitors were something else entirely. One teenage boy called out, \u201cLook! It\u2019s Chuck Norris! Hey, Walker, Texas Ranger!\u201d</p><p>He tipped his hat to the kid. No need to make their visitors think Texans weren\u2019t hospitable and friendly.</p><p>He was dressed in standard departmental wear\u2014boots, white hat and gun belt. He was carrying a Colt .45, his weapon of choice, and a popular gun among Rangers. He guessed that, in a way, he did look like Chuck Norris\u2014or the character he\u2019d played on a long-running TV show. Except, of course, that Norris was blond and light-skinned and he had dead-black hair and hazel eyes. People did stare. There weren\u2019t even two hundred Rangers in the whole state, so he supposed that made his appearance especially interesting for tourists.</p> <p>Another reason not to carry out an important meeting in a public place.</p><p>He did, however, recognize the man he was supposed to see, despite never having previously met him. Agent Jackson Crow was seated at one of the tables lining an iron fence that arced right out over the water, a cup of coffee in front of him. He was dressed in a black suit that seemed to scream FBI, to Logan\u2019s mind at least. He wore dark glasses and seemed perfectly comfortable, sitting at ease while he waited for the meeting. Whatever people thought of him, he obviously didn\u2019t give a damn.</p><p>Logan walked straight to the table. Crow was aware of him; he stood.</p><p>\u201cRaintree, I presume,\u201d he said, smiling as he offered his hand.</p><p>Logan shook hands, studying Crow. Yep, Indian blood. He assumed Crow was staring back at him, thinking the same thing. \u201cYes. I\u2019m Logan Raintree.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cComanche?\u201d Crow asked.</p><p>\u201cAll-American mutt in every way,\u201d Logan told him. \u201cOne ancestor was Comanche, one was Apache\u2014and two were European. Norwegian and English. You?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCheyenne and all-American mutt, as well,\u201d Crow said. \u201cI like the concept of that. Sit, please. Thank you for meeting with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome, but I wasn\u2019t really given a choice\u2014I was given an order.\u201d</p><p>Crow didn\u2019t respond to that. \u201cCoffee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCoffee sounds good,\u201d Logan said, pulling out a chair. He noted that the table had been set for three. \u201cSomeone\u2019s joining us?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>\u201cYes\u2014a U.S. Marshal,\u201d Crow said. \u201cWe\u2019ll eat when she gets here.\u201d</p><p>Logan slowly arched his brows. \u201cAll right, what kind of felon, madman or serial killer do we have running around San Antonio?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know much about him as yet. That\u2019s where you come in,\u201d Crow explained. \u201cAnd I\u2019m meeting with you first. Marshal O\u2019Brien isn\u2019t due for another half hour or so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t that mean you have to go through all of this twice?\u201d</p><p>Crow gave him a grim half smile and shrugged. Logan had the feeling that there was always method to his madness, though at the moment, he sure couldn\u2019t tell what it was.</p><p>A leather briefcase lay on the table. Crow reached into it and produced a sheaf of papers\u2014photos, Logan saw.</p><p>He didn\u2019t immediately recognize what he was looking at. At first glance it appeared to be a trash pile, but then, peering closer, he saw human bones beneath the branches, boxes and other refuse.</p><p>He looked back at Jackson Crow. \u201cI wish I could say that a dead body was something unusual,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s the circumstances that are unusual,\u201d Jackson murmured. \u201cHere\u2019s another.\u201d</p><p>The next picture was of a half-decayed body on a gurney in an autopsy room. This was a far more gruesome sight, resembling a creature imagined by a special-effects wizard; the flesh was ripped from most of the jaw and the cadaver seemed to be grinning in a macabre manner.</p><p>\u201cWhere was this body discovered? He? She?\u201d Logan asked.</p><p>\u201cShe. Both sets of remains belong to women. Both disappeared from the San Antonio area, one a year and a half ago, one about a year ago. Both had made it to San Antonio and were never seen again. Or not alive, anyway,\u201d he added.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m assuming traces were done on their credit cards, and the usual procedures carried out.\u201d</p><p>Jackson nodded. \u201cNeither actually checked into a hotel. The bones in the first picture belonged to a young woman named Chelsea Martin\u2014schoolteacher, part-time gemologist. The cadaver on the gurney was once a dancer named Tara Grissom. She worked out of New Orleans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDancer? As in stripper?\u201d Logan asked.</p><p>Jackson shook his head. \u201cShe was with a modern dance company. The show she was in closed down and they weren\u2019t due to cast the next show for a few months. She headed out to Texas. According to friends, she was fascinated with the Alamo. She flew from New Orleans to Houston and on to San Antonio, and she was never heard from again after she waved goodbye to the fellow who\u2019d been sitting next to her on the plane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the other girl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSimilar story. She was a new teacher, and when budget cuts came down, she lost her job. Chelsea Martin left New York City for San Antonio, took a cab straight to the Alamo and wasn\u2019t seen again.\u201d</p><p>Logan frowned. \u201cI should\u2019ve heard about this by now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou probably did. Think about all the missing-persons reports,\u201d Crow said with a shrug. \u201cThere are hundreds of them\u2014thousands. Some people go missing on purpose. You have to remember that. Thing is, until you really start digging, you don\u2019t always know if someone\u2019s disappeared on purpose or not.\u201d He pulled out more sets of pictures. They were all of bodies in various stages of decay. Female bodies.</p><p>Logan frowned at Jackson Crow. \u201cAll these corpses\u2014they\u2019re from here?\u201d</p><p>Crow nodded. \u201cMost of these women have yet to be identified. A number of them might have been prostitutes or women living on the edge. When someone doesn\u2019t have family or close friends, there\u2019s no one to hold law enforcement to task once the case has gone cold. We wouldn\u2019t have known about this if an enterprising young officer hadn\u2019t stumbled on the first body in a trash pile\u2014just a block from the Alamo. Don\u2019t look so appalled. No unit of Texas law enforcement has been neglectful in this case. First off, we still don\u2019t know if the cases are related, although studying the way the killer disposed of the bodies, it seems likely.\u201d He grimaced. \u201cThere may be a few who were killed by someone else\u2014someone who happened upon a body-disposal system that has eluded the law\u2014but I believe most of these women met the same killer. They all just disappeared. And of all the corpses and skeletal remains we\u2019ve discovered so far, we\u2019ve only been able to match two of the women to missing-persons reports.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you putting together a task force?\u201d Logan asked him.</p><p>\u201cMore or less. I\u2019m putting together a team.\u201d</p><p>Logan began to feel uneasy. He\u2019d looked up Jackson Crow. He had a reputation for being a crack behavioral profiler; he also had a reputation for running a crew of\u2014for lack of a better term\u2014ghost hunters. Hired by a somewhat reclusive government bigwig, Adam Harrison, he investigated the unusual. To the man\u2019s credit, it seemed that his team generally found real human beings who\u2019d perpetrated the crimes and brought them to justice.</p><p>Still...</p><p>Somehow, he felt Crow knew something about him. It wasn\u2019t a comfortable feeling.</p><p>\u201cAnd you want me to be on this team?\u201d Logan asked.</p><p>\u201cWe have one special unit working now\u2014a team of six, and six seems to be the optimal number. I\u2019m starting a second team. I don\u2019t just want you to be on the team\u2014I want you to head the team.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve had incredible success finding missing people,\u201d Jackson said smoothly.</p><p>Logan didn\u2019t blink. \u201cLogic,\u201d he told Crow. And a little luck...</p><p>\u201cLogic is the most important tool we have,\u201d Crow agreed. \u201cI\u2019m a man of logic myself.\u201d</p><p>Logan winced, then said flatly, \u201cYou look for ghosts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI look for killers,\u201d Crow said, correcting him. He indicated the briefcase. \u201cI have a lot of info on you, too, of course. I know you\u2019re exceptionally talented.\u201d Crow hesitated, thoughtful for a minute. When he spoke again, it was with both respect and empathy. \u201cAnd I know that your wife was kidnapped by the brother of a drug runner you put in jail. I know you found her\u2014buried in a pine box. The killer had been playing a game with you, but he screwed up. He didn\u2019t provide enough oxygen. You were able to find her, although no one ever really knew how. You just found her too late.\u201d</p><p>Logan felt tension seep into his bones. Alana had been gone nearly three years, yet he still couldn\u2019t think about her without a sense of loss and rage burning in his gut. She\u2019d died because he was who he was. She\u2019d been a shimmering spirit of laughter and giving, and she had died because of him. His exceptional talents had been useless.</p><p>Her death had sent him into the hills on a long leave; only a return to the land far from the city had somehow kept him halfway sane.</p><p>Maybe that was why he hadn\u2019t been aware of what had gone on with these missing women. And maybe everyone had overlooked the real and horrendous danger for the reason Jackson Crow had just given him. Sad, but true. Those on the fringes of life were often simply not missed.</p><p>\u201cYou have what we need,\u201d Crow told him.</p><p>No, I don\u2019t, Logan thought. I failed the woman I loved.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a Texas Ranger,\u201d Logan said, startled by the sound of his own voice, which was almost a growl.</p><p>\u201cYes. You returned to being a Ranger,\u201d Crow said. \u201cBecause you can\u2019t help yourself. You have to work in law enforcement. But, even as a Ranger, you have limitations. I can provide unlimited resources for you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThanks. I like being a Ranger. I\u2019m not so sure about being a fed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a matter of choice. Texas pride aside, there are a few things you might want to keep in mind, such as the fact that federal services have jurisdiction everywhere. In our case, of course, we work where we\u2019re invited in, except when we\u2019re talking about criminals and situations that cross state lines. That\u2019s always our jurisdiction. Crossing state lines is something killers do often enough. It\u2019s as if they know they can throw law enforcement into confusion and break chains of evidence when they do, and that\u2019s one reason the FBI is so important. Of course, your superiors know about this offer, and although they\u2019d be sorry to lose you, they understand the unique possibilities of the position I\u2019m offering you.\u201d</p><p>Logan shook his head. \u201cThank you. No. You\u2019ve got a serial killer on your hands. Or\u2014since one way or another, I\u2019ll get involved\u2014we\u2019ve got a serial killer on our hands. We\u2019ll dig in, too, work with the FBI. But I think I\u2019ll stay right where I am. I don\u2019t see any reason to change.\u201d</p><p>Crow nodded. \u201cAs I\u2019ve been saying, it is your choice. But there\u2019s something different about this case that does require an extra ability to see.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSee what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeneath the obvious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChelsea Martin called a friend just before she disappeared,\u201d Jackson Crow said.</p><p>\u201cFrom the Alamo?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe said she saw a ghost. She thought it had to be the ghost of a Texas hero. He was trying to urge her to get away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve lost me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe phoned Nancy McCall, a friend in New York, when she reached the Alamo. At first, according to Nancy, she was laughing, telling her that a reenactor was playing a game with her. Then she was concerned, saying that the \u2018performer\u2019 was getting very dramatic, insisting she leave the Alamo, go and hide somewhere. At the end of the conversation, Chelsea seemed to believe she\u2019d seen a ghost. She sounded frightened, and said this ghost or whatever he was had just disappeared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNothing. The line went dead. Her phone was never used again, and it was never found\u2014and I\u2019ve shown you what was left of Chelsea Martin.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>The Longhorn had been built at a time when men were men and...men were men. The saloon had a long curving bar, a piano and a large space for gaming tables. Near the front entry, which came complete with swinging doors, a staircase led to the balcony above and to the rooms on the second floor. When Kelsey sped into the main saloon area from the kitchen, she was stunned to see a man running down the stairs as if he were being chased by every demon in hell.</p><p>A big, tough-looking man. Leanly muscled, he stood a good six foot two\u2014and he was wearing an expression of sheer horror.</p><p>He had to be the \u201cbig ol\u2019 rodeo cowboy\u201d Sandy had told her about.</p><p>As Kelsey ran to the foot of the stairs to discover the cause of his terror, he nearly knocked her over in his haste to reach the door.</p><p>\u201cSir! What is it? What\u2019s happened?\u201d</p><p>Luckily, it seemed that the few other guests currently checked in to the Longhorn were already out or still asleep, and that the staff was either busy or not at work yet. No one else had appeared at the sound of the screams.</p> <p>\u201cLet me out of here! Let me out of here now!\u201d he yelled. He seemed like a decent man. Even in his near hysteria, he wasn\u2019t going to mow her down or pick her up bodily to toss her out of the way.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t realized that Sandy had come behind her until she heard her speak. \u201cMr. Simmons, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Simmons was perhaps thirty; he had the ruggedly handsome look of a modern-day cowboy, and Kelsey assumed he was in town for the upcoming rodeo trials. The man might have been ready to brave the meanest bronco, but he pointed up the stairs with a trembling hand. \u201cBlood...blood...blood. Oh, God, blood everywhere, all over the room!\u201d he said. \u201cLet me out. For the love of God, let me out of here!\u201d</p><p>Kelsey arched a brow at Sandy and placed a hand on Simmons\u2019s shoulder. \u201cSir, it\u2019s all right. Sandy will help you,\u201d she said.</p><p>Sandy looked back at Kelsey, her eyes filled with a silent plea. See? I\u2019ve been trying to tell you. It\u2019s happening again, and it\u2019s getting worse and worse. Do something!</p><p>Kelsey stepped past Mr. Simmons and hurried up the stairs to the gallery. She paused, gazing down over the rail of the landing. Sandy held her guest by the arm and was urging him to calm down. But Simmons seemed adamant about leaving.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019ll just show us, Mr. Simmons,\u201d Sandy said.</p><p>\u201cWhat, are you insane?\u201d he shouted. He stared up at Kelsey. \u201cDon\u2019t...oh, God, don\u2019t go in there! Get the police!\u201d he cried.</p><p>\u201cMr. Simmons,\u201d Kelsey called down. \u201cI am a law enforcement agent. I\u2019m a United States Marshal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRoom 207,\u201d Sandy said gravely.</p><p>Kelsey nodded, turned and hurried down the hallway. It was a straightforward numbering system; the second floor had ten rooms, 201 through 210. Room 207 was to her left along the gallery. Her own room was 201, but she didn\u2019t really have to check at the numbers; the door to 207 was wide open, just as Simmons had left it.</p><p>She stepped inside and paused, biting her lip. There was nothing there. Certainly no blood.</p><p>The room was handsomely appointed. In fact, Sandy had done a beautiful job restoring the whole place. She\u2019d renovated it with authenticity, studying historic documents and outfitting it with period pieces. Kelsey knew something about all of this, because Sandy had been in love with the inn\u2014longing to buy it\u2014for years. The Longhorn was one of the oldest original wooden structures of a bygone era. It had opened in 1833 as the Longhorn Saloon and Gentleman\u2019s Palace, and through its history, it had been the place where travelers to San Antonio, especially \u201cgentlemen,\u201d had come to enjoy the liquor, poker, ambiance and female entertainment provided here. Every now and then, Sandy arranged a night with old-time entertainment; it was no longer a house of prostitution, of course, but she held poker games for charity, and hired period singers, actors and dancers to evoke the feel of the old west.</p><p>Needless to say, any building as old as this one held its share of ghost stories. Room 207 had come with the Rose Langley legend, and much more recently, Sierra Monte had disappeared from it.</p><p>Kelsey considered what Sandy had told her about the Sierra Monte case.</p><p>Blood spray and spatter had covered the room. There had never been any sign of her body, and there had never been an arrest. DNA testing proved that the blood was hers, and the medical examiner had claimed it was highly unlikely that anyone could have lost that much blood and survived. How her remains had been removed from the room was a mystery, just like the identity of her killer.</p><p>It had been a horrible story. But in law enforcement, officers and agents heard a lot of horrible stories. And if every hotel in the world closed when something bad happened, they\u2019d be tearing down buildings right and left.</p><p>Afterward, Sandy had hired special crews to come in and clean up.</p><p>There wasn\u2019t a drop of blood to be seen anywhere.</p><p>Kelsey walked into the bathroom, once a dressing room for the \u201cgirls\u201d who had entertained at the Longhorn. She hadn\u2019t been in on the investigation, although she\u2019d researched it, primarily because of her friendship with Sandy. She knew that blood had been found in the bathroom, as well, a great deal of it. Detectives and forensic crews had determined that Sierra was most likely killed in the bedroom and possibly dismembered in the bathroom.</p><p>When the police had finished and Sandy had taken over the place, she\u2019d had the bathroom in 207 completely remodeled. The old tub was still taking up a lot of space in the evidence room at the police station.</p><p>The bathroom looked completely ordinary. Shaving equipment and toiletries were on the counter by the sink, and the old claw-foot tub Sandy had bought to replace the original one was damp. Sandy\u2019s guest had obviously had a bath or a shower before finding himself mesmerized by the blood his imagination had conjured up.</p><p>When Kelsey left the room and walked down the stairs, she saw that neither Sandy nor Mr. Simmons was in the main saloon area. She wasn\u2019t sure if they\u2019d run outside\u2014or if Sandy had managed to calm him down. She pushed open the swinging doors and looked out at the street. No one there. Kelsey quickly returned to the kitchen and the table where she\u2019d been about to drink her now-cold coffee.</p><p>Simmons and Sandy were sitting there, but Simmons wasn\u2019t drinking coffee. A shot glass and a bottle of whiskey stood in front of him. He\u2019d apparently downed several shots already.</p><p>Sandy and Simmons both turned to Kelsey. She shook her head. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing there, Mr. Simmons. Nothing at all.\u201d</p><p>He gaped at her, disbelief in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI swear to you,\u201d she added quietly, \u201cthere\u2019s nothing.\u201d</p><p>He groaned, lowering his head, pressing his temples between his palms. \u201cWell, that\u2019s just great. I\u2019m going crazy.\u201d</p><p>Kelsey drew up a chair next to him, setting a reassuring hand on his shoulder. \u201cMr. Simmons\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCorey. Call me Corey, please,\u201d he interrupted gruffly.</p><p>\u201cCorey,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re not going crazy. You\u2019re merely human, which makes you susceptible to the history of places like this. Everyone knows the stories about the Longhorn. You know the room was covered in blood at one time, and not that long ago, either. So, in your mind, you saw it covered in blood. You\u2019re not crazy. What happened wasn\u2019t a fun ghost story. It was reality.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should just not rent out that room,\u201d Sandy murmured.</p><p>Corey waved a hand in the air. \u201cNot your fault,\u201d he said. He gave them both a rueful grimace. \u201cI asked for that room. I told the boys going to the rodeo that I\u2019d be sleeping with the ghosts. I was a real hotshot. I didn\u2019t know I had a crazy susceptible mind. At least...that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to believe, Miss...?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cO\u2019Brien. Actually, Marshal O\u2019Brien,\u201d Kelsey said.</p><p>\u201cKelsey\u2019s been working with the U.S. Marshal\u2019s Office in Key West,\u201d Sandy explained.</p><p>\u201cA U.S. Marshal,\u201d he repeated, looking at her as if she were some kind of alien life form.</p> <p>She smiled at him.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t look like a cop,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cTechnically, I\u2019m not a cop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you...you do cop things.\u201d He still seemed confused.</p><p>\u201cMore or less.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCan a U.S. Marshal get my stuff out of that room?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI can do that for you, Mr. Simmons. And I\u2019ll help you find another location to stay, too,\u201d Sandy told him.</p><p>\u201cUm, can you just put me in another room?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Sandy was clearly surprised by his request. \u201cOf course I can. But you were pretty desperate to get out the door, Mr. Simmons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCorey,\u201d he said again, smiling. He flushed. \u201cLadies, I\u2019m going to ask you to do me a massive favor. Never repeat the fact that a six-foot-three two-hundred-and-thirty-pound bronco buster ran out of his room screaming like a baby.\u201d</p><p>Sandy laughed softly. Kelsey shrugged.</p> <p>\u201cPlease,\u201d he murmured, looking at Kelsey.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I don\u2019t really have anyone to tell,\u201d Kelsey said. She checked her watch. \u201cYou two will have to excuse me. I have a meeting this morning. That is, if you\u2019re sure you\u2019re all right now, um, Corey?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m feeling like the biggest fool in Texas, and that\u2019s some mean space,\u201d Corey said. \u201cI\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Kelsey glanced at Sandy. \u201cYou call me if you need anything. And, Corey, as soon as I\u2019m back, we\u2019ll see to it that all your things are moved to your new room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Kelsey,\u201d Sandy said. \u201cBut I\u2019m sure I can manage.\u201d She hesitated. \u201cUh, Kelsey? Are you interested in switching rooms with Corey? That would save me a lot of bother.\u201d</p><p>Kelsey thought about it for a moment, then said, \u201cSure. Why not?\u201d She wondered whether she\u2019d been too rash, but Sandy\u2019s gratitude confirmed that she\u2019d made the right decision.</p><p>Kelsey took another look at the half-empty bottle of whiskey. Corey Simmons was either going to lie down and pass out soon, or he\u2019d be seeing more ghosts. But Sandy smiled at her with confidence, and Kelsey figured she\u2019d manage, just as she\u2019d said. Sandy had supported both her parents through protracted deaths due to cancer, and Kelsey believed that was one reason she\u2019d been so caught up in the restoration of the Longhorn. She\u2019d pulled herself out of mourning and she\u2019d done it by throwing herself into this massive project. She could be tough as nails when she chose. Not only that, her livelihood now depended on the inn.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t even know what this meeting is,\u201d she said. \u201cSo don\u2019t worry about phoning if you need me.\u201d</p> <p>Sandy nodded. As she started out, Corey Simmons called her back. \u201cMiss\u2014I\u2019m sorry, Marshal! Miss O\u2019Brien, thank you.\u201d</p><p>She gave him a tiny salute of acknowledgment. Leaving the kitchen, Kelsey hurried back up to her room to grab her handbag. She paused to study herself in the freestanding Victorian swivel mirror. She felt she looked professional\u2014something she hadn\u2019t worried about in ages. She was five-nine, decked out in a black suit and simple white cotton tailored blouse. Her hair was a deep auburn, secured in a band at her nape. She had what she hoped were steady green eyes, and a lean sculpted face that lent her a look of maturity\u2014at least in her own opinion. Despite Corey Simmons\u2019s surprise that she was a woman who did \u201ccop things,\u201d she made the proper appearance for a U.S. Marshal. That seemed important in light of today\u2019s meeting.</p><p>She hurried out of her room, then walked down the hall to 207 again. Stepping inside, she held very still and closed her eyes. She\u2019d come up here before because of Corey\u2019s hysteria; now, she decided to take a moment to see what her intuition would show.</p><p>She opened her eyes, but didn\u2019t focus on the room as it was now. What she saw looked similar, but...different. Out of kilter. There was a wardrobe in the corner, but it was a slightly different wardrobe. Where the bathroom should have been, she saw a slatted Oriental divider: The bed was smaller, and a white chemise lay at the foot of it.</p><p>There were two people in the room, a man and a woman. The woman was beautiful, dark curly hair piled atop her head, long legs clad in old-fashioned stockings and garters. She wore a white shirt and corset. Her dress had been thrown on a nearby chair. The man was wearing a dark suit, a tall hat and appeared to have stepped out of an 1850s fashion ad for gentlemen. He was tall and, despite his apparel, had the rugged look of a cowhand. He strode angrily across the room and grasped the woman by the shoulders. \u201cYou won\u2019t hold out on me!\u201d he shouted at her. \u201cI want it, and I want it now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have it,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a liar! I know what happened in Galveston that night, and I know your pretty-boy lover won it. I want it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s mine!\u201d she responded.</p><p>\u201cYou think you\u2019ll get back to that no-good weakling? Well, give up that dream. He moved on the moment you were gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate you,\u201d she told him, shaking herself free. \u201cI hate you, Matt. I loathe you. You forced me here, and you\u2019ve used me enough. Even if I had it, I\u2019d never let you have it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re an old whore already, Rose,\u201d he said. \u201cI want it, and I\u2019ll get it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will never give it to you!\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t respond. Instead, he wrenched her to him again; his fingers curled around her neck. He squeezed his hands together; he shook her hard. She grabbed desperately at his arms, trying to break his hold on her.</p><p>\u201cPlease, Matt!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll kill you, and I\u2019ll rip this place to shreds\u2014and find it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease!\u201d</p><p>That one word escaped her lips, more breath than word, as her face became red and mottled and she began to flail at him helplessly. Kelsey was so horrified by the vision that she ran to the man and woman, but of course they weren\u2019t there, not in this time and space. As she reached them, the woman went limp, and the man picked her up and tossed her onto the bed as if she were refuse.</p><p>Then they both disappeared.</p><p>Kelsey blinked. She wanted to cry for the woman who seemed to have fallen in love so foolishly, been abused and then murdered. There\u2019d been no future for her; she had died still a beauty.</p><p>What was the it they\u2019d been talking about?</p><p>However, that wasn\u2019t a concern right now.</p><p>She hurried out of the room, curious about the meeting her superior had insisted she attend.</p><p>She found herself remembering the bird on the window ledge that morning and, once again, couldn\u2019t shake the strange feeling it had given her.</p><p>She was about to meet men named Crow and Raintree. She wondered if this meeting had something to do with the Bureau of Indian Affairs.</p><p>And yet, somehow, she had the feeling it didn\u2019t.</p><p>She suspected it would have to do with her so-called \u201cspecial\u201d abilities. Abilities she usually kept to herself, but in the recent situation...</p><p>In all honesty, she knew why she\u2019d been called.</p><p>This had to be connected to the body she\u2019d found three weeks ago in Key West. That was when Archie had really begun to look at her strangely.</p><p>Body? No...she hadn\u2019t actually discovered a body.</p><p>Just bones. Broken and disarticulated bones. They might\u2019ve all wound up in the garbage heap or a landfill if the trucks had come through a few more times. But Kelsey had seen the woman standing there, sobbing over the heap. And when she\u2019d looked again, there had been no woman, but...</p><p>But there\u2019d been the bones.</p><p>Logan shook his head, staring at Jackson Crow. \u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t understand what? The gravity of the situation?\u201d Crow inquired.</p><p>\u201cNo. I don\u2019t understand what setting up a team with the FBI will accomplish that various law enforcement agencies working together won\u2019t,\u201d Logan said. \u201cI don\u2019t believe a ghost killed her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t, either,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cThere are two possibilities, and since you\u2019re a Texan, I should think either one would bother you. One, a killer is dressing up as a Texas hero to attack innocent women.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDead Texas heroes remain...heroes. They\u2019re still trying to save the lives of others, and warn them away. Because they recognize a killer when they see one.\u201d</p><p>Logan wanted to argue with him; he even raised a hand to do so, but didn\u2019t find the right words. He was suddenly reminded of the very strange experience with the birds that morning.</p><p>Strange, but certainly natural. A physical phenomenon.</p><p>And, of course, he knew that things could happen, things that didn\u2019t always fall into the realm of natural physical phenomena.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to answer me now. My people are working on it. But,\u201d Crow added wryly, \u201cwe\u2019re being stretched far too thin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re not expecting an answer yet,\u201d Logan said. \u201cBecause if you were, I\u2019d have to say no.\u201d</p><p>Crow shrugged. \u201cWe don\u2019t expect anyone to just say, \u2018Hey, I\u2019ll jump on it.\u2019 But I\u2019ve studied law enforcement profiles, and I\u2019d like to begin with you and Marshal O\u2019Brien.\u201d He sent Logan a quick smile. \u201cI wasn\u2019t keen on this when it first came up, either. I assumed I was receiving a major demotion. But you\u2019d be astonished by what can be accomplished when you put the right network of people together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you have a good team, yes, it can work exceptionally well. But you don\u2019t really know someone until you\u2019ve met him. Or her. So, you study profiles. What happens if you meet someone you don\u2019t like?\u201d Logan asked.</p><p>\u201cThen I don\u2019t make the offer. Just so you know, I don\u2019t work alone. A man named Adam Harrison started this...experiment, shall we say. He had friends, and he identified people around the country who had abilities. Instincts, if you prefer. He put my team together. Adam\u2019s an interesting man, not particularly talented in this area, but he\u2019s developed a sense for people with these uncanny skills. So far, he\u2019s zeroed in perfectly every time.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAdam Harrison. The name\u2019s familiar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s done a great deal of good. He and his team have uncovered many charlatans, and found the truth behind their mist and mirrors. He watches people carefully. He knows who to approach for the Krewe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not trying to be argumentative,\u201d Logan muttered, \u201cbut a lot of what you hear about Texans is true. We were our own country for a short while, and we\u2019re still dedicated to being Texans.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDedication is a good thing. But, like I said, you can think about it. And regardless of what you decide, you\u2019re now apprised of this situation.\u201d Crow indicated the pictures, then got to his feet. \u201cI believe Marshal O\u2019Brien has arrived.\u201d He smiled, glancing at his watch. \u201cPrecisely on time.\u201d</p><p>Logan stood, too. He saw a woman coming toward them. He noted first that she had a thick head of auburn hair that fell to her shoulders, and then he went on with his assessment. She moved with fluid confidence, and she was tall, about five-ten. Slim and well-built. She wasn\u2019t wearing a badge, but there was a quality about her that spoke of law enforcement. He was pretty certain the bulge on her hip was a Glock.</p><p>As she came nearer, he realized that she had exceptionally fine features and might have graced a model\u2019s runway rather than a crime scene. But before she reached them and offered each man a firm handshake as introductions were exchanged, he could tell that she wasn\u2019t some kind of delicate hothouse flower. Her walk, her movements, the way she\u2019d looked for them and found them instantly\u2014they all registered authority and determination. Maybe she\u2019d perfected her manner to offset her beauty, which was vivid and startling. When she removed her sunglasses, he saw that she had green eyes, their color almost as deep as a forest.</p><p>He also realized that she was as curious as he had been about the meeting. \u201cShall we order?\u201d he suggested. \u201cWe\u2019re all here now.\u201d</p><p>He lifted his hand to summon their waitress. Crow was polite and friendly as he ordered his meal, and despite the fact that Kelsey O\u2019Brien couldn\u2019t have done more than glance at the menu, she ordered quickly. He did, as well, although he wasn\u2019t hungry. Something about this meeting was causing his stomach to knot.</p> <p>Jackson Crow began the new conversation casually. \u201cHow are you enjoying Texas, Marshal O\u2019Brien?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s great,\u201d she said. \u201cSan Antonio is beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you been able to see or do much yet?\u201d Crow asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m staying at the Longhorn, a historic saloon. I can see the Alamo from my window. Very poignant, really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Longhorn has quite a reputation,\u201d Logan commented. Ridiculous! he told himself. For some reason, he\u2019d just had to throw that out.</p><p>He was irritated at his own pleasure in thinking he might know something Agent Crow didn\u2019t. This meeting was confusing him. He was usually willing to do whatever it took to stop crime, especially murder. But this...</p> <p>It felt as if once he took a step, he\u2019d fall into a pit, and he wasn\u2019t sure he\u2019d know how to maneuver his way out.</p><p>Maybe because he hadn\u2019t known that there seemed to be a pattern of disappearances. It was true that the FBI could recognize the similarities between these crimes.</p><p>Maybe he was still off his stride because of what had happened on his way here\u2014the scene with the birds.</p><p>Logan began to explain. \u201cA murder took place there around the time of the Texas Revolution,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd about a year ago, a young woman disappeared from the \u2018murder room.\u2019 Local homicide detectives tore the room and half the hotel apart, and she was never discovered. The room looked like there\u2019d been a bloodbath. I\u2019m not sure if that fits with the cases you\u2019ve been showing me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like it does,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cWhat do you think, Marshal O\u2019Brien?\u201d</p><p>Logan studied the young woman he had so recently met.</p><p>She smiled awkwardly and looked around before answering. \u201cWe seem to be pretty casual here. Please call me Kelsey. And I\u2019m sorry but I\u2019m not up to speed. What cases?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cOne moment,\u201d Crow murmured. \u201cOur food is coming.\u201d</p> <p>Kelsey O\u2019Brien had ordered salmon. Logan wondered if she avoided red meat and realized he\u2019d ordered fish that afternoon, too. When their waitress left the table, Jackson launched into the story he\u2019d already told Logan.</p><p>Logan sat back, listening, while Jackson Crow explained the FBI involvement. He waited until they had finished eating and then spread out the pictures to show her.</p><p>\u201cHorrible,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cI do believe we\u2019re looking for one killer. Although, as I told Raintree, it is possible that these murders and the unknown remains we\u2019ve discovered aren\u2019t all connected. We\u2019re talking about a huge population here and, obviously, the larger the population, the easier it is for people to get lost in the crowd,\u201d Crow said.</p><p>Logan saw that Marshal Kelsey O\u2019Brien wasn\u2019t turning away from the pictures, but neither was her expression devoid of empathy and distress. She raised her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve seen the dead before, but...in my area, it\u2019s often a drug runner shot and down. Nothing like...this.\u201d</p><p>Jackson Crow scooped up the pictures as the waitress came to clear the table and bring them more coffee. When it had been poured and they were alone once again, Logan found that he was intrigued to discover what Kelsey knew about the Longhorn Inn.</p><p>\u201cWhat have you learned about the murder?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>She looked at him, and he gazed into her clear green eyes. \u201cYou mean Sierra Monte? Very little, I\u2019m afraid. The owner, Sandy Holly, is an old friend of mine. That\u2019s why I\u2019m staying at the Longhorn. So I only know what Sandy\u2019s told me and a few things I read online. I also know it was incredibly complicated when she purchased the place, because she had a nonrefundable deposit down, with access to begin the renovations, and then Sierra Monte disappeared. Sandy still had to pay on the closing date and everything was put on hold while the police finished their investigation and then the people hired to do the crime-scene cleanup were brought in. She was devastated about the young woman, of course, but she was also in a predicament herself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s up and running now, and doing well, right?\u201d Logan asked.</p><p>Kelsey nodded. \u201cShe did a stunning job with it. There are parts of the inn that make you feel as if you\u2019ve been transported almost two hundred years back in time. And, of course, Room 207 was gutted, and yet there\u2019ve been people clamoring to get into it\u2014and people claiming they\u2019ve seen ghosts and blood... .\u201d She paused. \u201cSome people are fascinated by this stuff. Sandy was worried about it, naturally. And now...\u201d</p><p>She stopped speaking. There was a lot more to the \u201cand now...\u201d but she didn\u2019t seem sure she should be talking about it.</p><p>Kelsey was aware that both men were watching her, waiting. She shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s odd\u2014just before I left today, a big bruiser of a cowboy came running out of that room, screaming. He was convinced that the entire room was covered in blood. Of course it wasn\u2019t.\u201d She grinned. \u201cEventually, he calmed down and I went up to the room and looked around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d Jackson asked her.</p><p>\u201cIt was just as the cowboy had left it,\u201d Kelsey O\u2019Brien said slowly.</p><p>Logan noticed that she\u2019d hesitated before she spoke. Her words were smooth enough, but there was something she wasn\u2019t saying. She didn\u2019t fully trust them; however, that was okay. He wasn\u2019t sure of his own feelings about Jackson Crow or Marshal O\u2019Brien yet, either.</p><p>\u201cImpressionable minds can create ghosts,\u201d Crow said.</p><p>\u201cVery true,\u201d Kelsey O\u2019Brien agreed.</p><p>But Crow homed in on her words. \u201cWhat about you? What did your mind see in that room?\u201d</p><p>She leaned back, startled, but composing herself as she returned Jackson Crow\u2019s gaze.</p><p>\u201cAnyone could get impressions in that room\u2014once you know what happened there,\u201d she replied. \u201cAnd, of course, I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes it ever distress your friend?\u201d Crow asked her.</p><p>\u201cDefinitely. She\u2019s sunk a lot of money into the Longhorn, especially since she bought it in bad condition\u2014and under bad circumstances. Sandy\u2019s wanted to own it for ages, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything unusual occur during your nights at the inn?\u201d Crow asked next.</p><p>\u201cIn my room? Not a thing,\u201d Kelsey said.</p><p>She didn\u2019t share easily, Logan thought.</p><p>\u201cBut you do feel the saloon is haunted?\u201d Crow persisted.</p><p>She hesitated again, frowning, and then answered with \u201cWhat exactly do you consider haunted, Agent Crow? When I walk through places that are steeped in history, there\u2019s always an air about them. The Alamo? I feel like I\u2019m walking on hallowed ground. I get that same feeling at the Tower of London and the battlegrounds at Gettysburg. I think many people feel this way in certain places. The Longhorn Inn is no different. It witnessed history. I suppose many people imagine they see the past when they\u2019re going through places like that.\u201d</p><p>Crow listened, nodding, a small smile curving his lips. \u201cNice reply. And not an answer to my question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, what do you want?\u201d Kelsey asked him, clearly irritated. \u201cDo I pass ghosts walking up and down the stairs or in the saloon? No.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you seen them at all?\u201d</p><p>She looked as if she\u2019d been trapped. Obviously, she had to be competent and able to stand on her own, but Logan suddenly felt that he wanted to step in; he hated being cornered himself, and he didn\u2019t like to watch it being done to someone else.</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of haunting are you talking about, Agent Crow?\u201d he asked. \u201cResidual haunting, where the same traumatic event occurs over and over again? Or are you referring to intelligent or active haunting, where the ghosts actually partake in life?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEither,\u201d Crow said, shrugging. \u201cI\u2019m curious.\u201d He leaned across the table, his casual manner gone. \u201cKelsey, I know damned well that you see what others don\u2019t. What did you see in Room 207?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She frowned. \u201cWhat did I see? A murder.\u201d She looked over at Logan, and he couldn\u2019t tell whether she saw anger or appreciation in his eyes. \u201cAbsolutely nothing that could help us with the here and now. I saw a murder that took place over a hundred and fifty years ago, and the murderer himself is long gone. I guess what I saw was a residual haunting. No blood\u2014the poor woman was strangled. So, perhaps we should get back to what we\u2019re actually dealing with. Dead women. Corpses dumped here, there and everywhere in San Antonio. I\u2019m assuming you have more to work with than just photos, Agent Crow?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI\u2019m set up at the police station, about a mile away. I\u2019ll pay for our meal, then we\u2019ll go there and you can see how far we\u2019ve gotten. Tomorrow, I\u2019ll be briefing local law enforcement, but for now, you can come over and get started.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa, Agent Crow. I haven\u2019t agreed to be part of this team,\u201d Logan reminded him.</p> <p>Crow raised one shoulder. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to see what we have?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Logan let out a deep breath.</p><p>Of course he did. This was happening in his city, and Jackson Crow had been right about one thing\u2014he had to be in law enforcement.</p><p>He had to be involved.</p><p>And since he\u2019d seen the pictures of the remains...</p> <p>He turned to face Kelsey O\u2019Brien. She was watching him with her intent green eyes, and he wondered if she felt the same sense of urgency he did. The same need to know, despite the risks.</p><p>\u201cReady when you are,\u201d he said quietly.</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>This is not going to work! Kelsey thought.</p><p>Jackson Crow seemed pleasant enough, like a man who could be a team player. But Logan Raintree seemed almost hostile. Except that he\u2019d pitched in with information about the Longhorn and he\u2019d also risen to her defense when Crow had been hammering away about what she\u2019d seen at the inn. Still, it was pretty obvious that he didn\u2019t want to be a member of any team, and if he wasn\u2019t part of the team\u2014was there a team? There would be a task force, she supposed. Now that the FBI had become aware of the number of corpses, there\u2019d have to be. The fact that a serial killer was suspected of targeting the area was bound to become known, and the public would demand it.</p><p>But did she want to be part of it?</p> <p>Something inside her wanted to recoil. And something else wanted to go with the two men, go and look at the available evidence.</p><p>So she went. She had certainly seen violence and death as a U.S. Marshal. Gun battles happened on the open sea when drug traffickers found themselves under siege. Bodies were dragged out of the Gulf and the Atlantic. She\u2019d seen the ugly side of human nature. Despite that, the murders of the women seemed far more horrific than the cold and impersonal violence she most frequently witnessed. Cocaine dealers shot their rivals and their enemies\u2014people who worked for the law.</p><p>True, she\u2019d found those bones in Key West... . And because she had, the victim had been identified, and a family had learned the sad truth.</p><p>She forced herself to appear cool, professional, stoic as they reached the police station and passed through the outer areas, where petty offenders were being booked. San Antonio was not without its share of prostitutes and thieves, and a number of them were being interviewed, along with traffic offenders and others brought in by the police for their various misdeeds. But Jackson Crow barely noticed them. With a brief word to the desk sergeant, he led her and Logan through a hallway to a large room enclosed by smoked glass. Within that room were several desks, a free-standing, forty-inch computer screen, a small lab area, a board with marker notes and a private snack station with a large coffeepot and a small refrigerator and microwave oven. It was almost its own little fortress.</p><p>This could be her place. For now at least.</p><p>A man sat at one of the desks, but rose when they all entered. He was tall and striking in a lanky, easy way, and was quick to shake their hands when Jackson introduced him as Jake Mallory. On Jackson\u2019s own team, he was adept with cameras, recorders and, he admitted dryly, a guitar.</p><p>\u201cOnly one member of your team\u2019s here,\u201d Logan pointed out.</p><p>\u201cI told you,\u201d Jackson Crow said. \u201cWe\u2019re stretched too thin. There\u2019s been a murder at an old hotel in D.C. Some of my people are there.\u201d</p> <p>Logan Raintree merely nodded.</p><p>\u201cSo what do you have?\u201d Kelsey asked Jake Mallory.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve given them the information about Chelsea Martin and Tara Grissom?\u201d Jake asked Crow.</p><p>Again, Crow nodded. Jake sat at his computer and hit a key. The large screen against the far wall came to life. \u201cThat\u2019s Chelsea Martin on the left, Tara Grissom on the right,\u201d he said. \u201cBoth photos were taken a few months before they disappeared.\u201d</p><p>No matter how long a person worked in law enforcement, Kelsey thought, it was heartbreaking to see the image of a young woman in life\u2014and to know how that life had ended. Chelsea Martin had huge blue eyes and dark brown hair. Tara Grissom was a blonde, with green eyes. Chelsea\u2019s face had been round, while Tara\u2019s was slim with high cheekbones. Chelsea peered out at them, smiling. The close-up had been cropped, and it looked as if her face had been taken from a picture with kids in it. She\u2019d presumably had her arms around some of them. They must\u2019ve been children she\u2019d taught. Tara\u2019s picture had probably been a publicity photo, because it had a neutral background and she smiled at them from a posed angle.</p><p>\u201cThese are the young women we know, and they\u2019re at the morgue, along with six we have yet to identify,\u201d Jake said. \u201cThe killer isn\u2019t going for a particular look, or not that we can pin down from these two, at any rate. One\u2019s a brunette, the other a blonde. One was plump, and one was lean. And although we haven\u2019t identified the other remains, there\u2019s hair on most of them, or remnants of hair, and the colors vary.\u201d He cleared his throat. \u201cI was listening to Chelsea\u2019s last phone conversation when you arrived.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer phone conversation? How was it recorded?\u201d Logan asked. \u201cIf her friend answered the phone, there wouldn\u2019t be a recording.\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparently, she answered right when the recording began. We got lucky. Nancy McCall had an old-fashioned answering machine,\u201d Jake said. \u201cIt\u2019s strange\u2014I\u2019ve been isolating sounds on the tape, but...well, you want to listen to the original recording first?\u201d</p><p>Crow nodded.</p><p>\u201cThis is the conversation,\u201d Jake said, hitting another key.</p><p>Chelsea Martin, with her wide cheeks and big eyes, smiled at them from the screen as they listened. \u201cNancy! Hey!\u201d said her voice, sweet and excited.</p><p>\u201cYou were supposed to call me when you landed,\u201d came the reply.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I went straight to the Alamo, which is crazy, \u2019cause I\u2019m dragging around a bag and all. But I had to come here! I\u2019ve read so much about it, so many stories about the siege and the battle and the people who were here...oh! Too funny! There\u2019s a man in costume. I\u2019ve been flirting with him. He\u2019s pretty cute, too!\u201d</p><p>Before her friend could respond, another voice broke in. It was deep and husky, and had a rattling sound, almost as if someone were speaking through a mouthful of dust.</p><p>\u201cCome away, come away, now. You\u2019re in danger!\u201d</p><p>They heard Chelsea giggle. \u201cThe battle\u2019s over,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re in danger,\u201d the rattling voice said again, \u201cPlease, listen to me.\u201d</p><p>That voice. Kelsey had been in dire situations several times, but she couldn\u2019t remember when any sound had caused such a chill to suddenly sweep through her.</p><p>\u201cNancy, I think a ghost is playing with me,\u201d Chelsea said, and she laughed again.</p><p>\u201cChelsea, what\u2019s going on?\u201d her friend asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d</p><p>And that was it. Silence. For a moment, those in the room were silent, as well.</p><p>\u201cAnd just how do you figure the third voice got on the phone?\u201d Logan Raintree asked. His voice was hard and cold. \u201cFor it to be that clear, he had to have his mouth right next to the phone. What did the friend say when you questioned her about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI called Nancy McCall earlier this afternoon,\u201d Jake said. \u201cShe didn\u2019t hear the other voice when she spoke to Chelsea, and she has no idea how it can be so clear on the recording\u2014or even how it managed to record at all. I told you, I\u2019ve been isolating sounds, but I can\u2019t separate this voice from Chelsea\u2019s when I try to bring them onto different frequencies. I just played you the original. I can isolate Chelsea\u2019s voice, and you\u2019ll hear that it\u2019s still in there.\u201d</p><p>He played the recording again.</p><p>Afterward, Jackson walked over to Jake\u2019s desk, which held a pile of folders. He picked up two of them. \u201cTake these,\u201d he said, handing one to Logan and one to Kelsey. \u201cThey have all the information we\u2019ve got on Chelsea and Tara, and the times and dates the six unidentified bodies were discovered. Please take a look at the folders. If you decide to join the team, I\u2019d like you to come to the morgue with me tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave those bodies been there all this time?\u201d Logan asked.</p><p>\u201cNo. We\u2019ve exhumed them,\u201d Jackson told him. \u201cThey were buried by the city as unknowns.\u201d</p><p>Logan shook his head, eyes narrowed. His expression was impassive, and yet Kelsey felt that some kind of emotion was seething inside him. \u201cWhy now?\u201d he asked. If he exploded, he\u2019d be frightening.</p><p>Yet she was equally certain that he never just exploded. He controlled himself at all times.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s in the folder,\u201d Jackson said.</p><p>Next, Jake passed out pages he\u2019d obviously printed for them. \u201cI was looking up information on another case when I found out that a young woman, Vanessa Johnston, has recently disappeared\u2014on her way here,\u201d he told them. \u201cRight now, she\u2019s a missing person. She was driving in. Neither she nor her Honda has been seen since she stopped at a gas station near the county line. I brought the problem to Jackson\u2019s attention. Everything\u2019s on those sheets I gave you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Kelsey slipped hers inside the folder.</p><p>\u201cI spoke with your captain about this case, Raintree,\u201d Jackson was saying. \u201cAnd he invited us in.\u201d</p><p>Kelsey watched as Logan Raintree nodded curtly and headed toward the door.</p> <p>He paused and turned to face them. \u201cWhat time are we going to the morgue?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201c9:00 a.m.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d</p><p>He left the room.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to hear the recording again, please,\u201d Kelsey said.</p> <p>She found a chair at one of the empty desks and sat, listening as Jake replayed it. Once more she felt the strange chill, but along with the sense of fear and dread, she felt...</p><p>A sense of something being oddly right. Not about the recording. About her. She might miss the water, miss home, miss being a Marshal, but she knew she could help on this case. And she wanted to.</p><p>She held her folder with hands that seemed to freeze around it. When the recording finished, both men were watching her.</p><p>\u201cNine?\u201d she asked. She\u2019d heard Jackson the first time. She\u2019d just needed to say something.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cI\u2019ll pick you up at the Longhorn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne more thing.\u201d Jake touched a key. The picture on the large computer screen changed.</p> <p>Another young woman of about twenty-five smiled out at her. She was wearing a tiara on sandy-colored hair.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s our missing girl,\u201d he said. \u201cVanessa Johnston. Last year\u2019s Miss Maple Queen of Montpelier, Vermont.\u201d</p><p>Kelsey rose. \u201cI\u2019ll have these read by tomorrow and be completely up to speed,\u201d she told Crow. \u201cI\u2019m in, provided you still want this team to exist if Raintree opts out.\u201d</p><p>She was surprised when Crow smiled grimly. \u201cHe\u2019ll be at the morgue tomorrow, and he won\u2019t opt out.\u201d</p><p>Kelsey decided not to answer. Raintree hadn\u2019t looked as if he planned to agree. Not in her opinion, anyway.</p><p>But then, maybe she was better at understanding the dead than the living.</p><p>\u201cGood afternoon,\u201d she said. And she left the two men, still feeling the same sense of dread.</p><p>And the same sense of purpose.</p> <p>Logan drove straight to his own office. Others greeted him as he walked through the main room, both those sworn in as Texas Rangers and civilians busy at other tasks. The world hadn\u2019t changed for any of them; they waved at him, smiled, chatted. He went to Captain Aaron Bentley\u2019s office, tapped on the door, but walked in without waiting for an answer. Bentley was on the phone. He was a big man with snow-white hair, as rugged-looking as any man who\u2019d ever run a Texas Ranger division.</p><p>Bentley seemed to be expecting him. He lifted a hand in greeting and ended his conversation.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell did you send me into, sir?\u201d Logan demanded.</p><p>\u201cSit down,\u201d Bentley told him. Logan stood there stiffly for a minute, then sighed and took the chair in front of Bentley\u2019s desk. \u201cSir\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, don\u2019t \u2018sir\u2019 me,\u201d Bentley said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been together too long for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been good at my job,\u201d Logan said.</p><p>\u201cYou have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo...\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, I\u2019m trying to get you onto a team where you can really be of service. Is that going to be on the Texas level or on the national level?\u201d Bentley murmured. \u201cI had to ask myself where you could do the most good, Logan. And if I\u2019m honest, it\u2019s with this new team. Your instincts have helped us in hundreds of cases. You have the sort of mind that reads others, and you\u2019ve predicted the course of a perp\u2019s actions a dozen times. I thought we\u2019d lost you after Alana died, but you headed out to that rock you love so much and your grandfather\u2019s place, and you came back stronger. I\u2019d like to keep you, but when the request comes down from the top of the food chain, you do what you need to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m told I have a choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do. You have time to think about this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat time? Captain, do you know what\u2019s been going on? And if I\u2019m so damned good at this kind of thing, why the hell didn\u2019t I know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe FBI has just shared its information,\u201d Bentley said. \u201cWe\u2019re in process of analyzing it, and supplying them with whatever info we can find. Every law enforcement agency in the area will be on the hunt now. But, Logan, you...\u201d</p><p>Bentley\u2019s voice trailed off. Bentley\u2019s voice never trailed off. Logan knew they were both thinking about the same thing\u2014what had happened with Alana.</p><p>\u201cThe Rangers have changed over the years, Raintree,\u201d Bentley said, recovering his voice. \u201cWe\u2019re a true law enforcement agency under the Texas Department of Safety. You know as well as I do that we\u2019re actually older than Texas as a republic, a state, a Confederate state and a U.S. state again. Hell, when Stephen Austin organized Rangers to protect the frontier while the Anglos were first moving in, we were frontier guards, and that was our business for a long time. Then we battled the Mexican government, and the Native American tribes, and the outlaws. We kept peace on the frontier until there was no more frontier. We had our valiant moments in the sun, and we were some of Zachary Taylor\u2019s finest troops in the Mexican-American war. At times we also acted like a law unto ourselves. Those days are over\u2014for all their brilliance. We\u2019re a respected law enforcement agency. We serve a higher god, you might say. And that\u2019s the thing, Logan. No matter how you look at it, we\u2019re part of the greater good.\u201d</p><p>He had neatly sidestepped the real conversation.</p><p>Alana.</p><p>Logan remained silent.</p><p>\u201cLogan, the feds have way more power than I can ever have or give,\u201d he said in a resigned voice. \u201cAnd this team the government wants to set up\u2014it has a direct connection to the most powerful law enforcement men in the country. Anything that can be done within constitutional limits will be done. Warrants achieved at all hours of the day or night. In any city, any state of the Union. The right to cross geographical boundaries to chase the truth. I\u2019ve heard that the man responsible for creating these teams has the White House on speed dial. But more than that, Logan, they have what you need, and you have what they need.\u201d</p><p>He had what they needed.</p><p>Sitting there, he suddenly felt defeated. Nothing seemed real. He\u2019d been pretending that his life could return to normal. Playing at being a good Ranger, following the clues, investigating leads. If he didn\u2019t think about Alana, he could look back on his life as if it were history, as distant as the events at the Alamo.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a unique opportunity,\u201d Bentley said.</p><p>Logan didn\u2019t have anything more to say to Bentley. Except this, \u201cI still have time,\u201d he said as he rose from his chair.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He exited the office, pausing at the door to turn around. \u201cThanks, Captain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRaintree, you\u2019re a great officer. I\u2019ll be sorry to lose you.\u201d</p><p>Logan didn\u2019t deny that Bentley had lost him. But he wasn\u2019t sure yet. He\u2019d know in the morning.</p><p>Kelsey couldn\u2019t decide where to go.</p><p>Her mind was spinning. She should get back to the Longhorn, log on to her computer and look up everything she could find on Jackson Crow and Adam Harrison and the Krewe of Hunters. But she wasn\u2019t ready to go back yet; she wasn\u2019t ready for questions or even for Corey Simmons and the ghosts of a century gone.</p><p>She needed to mull over the meeting.</p><p>She parked her rental car by the Alamo. She\u2019d taken the tour several days ago. But there was something special about the place, an aura of a certain time, the acts of men who\u2019d changed history.</p><p>And she couldn\u2019t forget the recording she\u2019d just heard. Chelsea Martin at the Alamo, laughing at first, happy as she talked to a friend. Then...gone.</p><p>And now...</p><p>Dead.</p><p>She wandered aimlessly for a while, watching as a group worked with schoolchildren, reenacting what had occurred at the fort. She gathered that one man was playing the role of Davy Crockett, and another, that of twenty-six-year-old Lieutenant Colonel Travis, who\u2019d run the battle\u2014since his co-commander, Jim Bowie, was in bed, probably dying, and probably of tuberculosis. A few men were playing other defenders, those who hadn\u2019t gone down in history with such giant names and reputations, but who had died there nonetheless.</p><p>She listened to them, impressed. The actors were doing a brilliant job, bringing the situation to life. The men they portrayed were tired. They spoke of day-to-day things\u2014their meals, scouting expeditions, their exhaustion, their desire for more comfortable beds.</p><p>She was so busy watching them that she hardly noticed when a man sat next to her. Then she caught sight of him in her peripheral vision, and became instantly aware. Perhaps she shouldn\u2019t have been surprised, but she was.</p><p>There was no mistaking Logan Raintree. The best of many cultures had mixed in his face, a face as cleanly sculpted as a marble bust, with high broad cheekbones and a determined chin. He wasn\u2019t beautiful, but he was one of the most imposing men she\u2019d ever met. The ever-simmering energy within him added a vitality and heat that made him even more intriguing, more attractive.</p><p>Seductive. She immediately tried to wipe that thought from her mind.</p><p>She didn\u2019t speak but gazed at him solemnly. He\u2019d known she was there. He hadn\u2019t walked away when he saw her. Quite the opposite\u2014he\u2019d joined her.</p><p>She was almost shocked when he smiled at her. \u201cI\u2019d like to apologize, Marshal O\u2019Brien. I\u2019ve been an ass.\u201d</p><p>She smiled in response. \u201cUm, apology accepted. Except...you weren\u2019t that bad,\u201d she said with a laugh.</p><p>\u201cWhat made you come here?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s not that far from the Longhorn, where I\u2019m staying. I wasn\u2019t ready to go back and answer a bunch of questions about the meeting. I needed time.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, looking toward the chapel. \u201cI wondered if you\u2019d come here because this is where Chelsea Martin was last seen.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt might\u2019ve had something to do with that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou going to accept Jackson Crow\u2019s offer?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cI...don\u2019t know. Maybe. You?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis morning, I would\u2019ve given him a definite no. Now...I\u2019m not sure. Either way, I want to find out what there is to see at the morgue tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>She felt a tightening inside. Yes. The morgue.</p><p>They were both silent for a minute. Then he began to speak, his tone relaxed.</p><p>\u201cThe Alamo\u2019s a shrine,\u201d he said softly. \u201cOf course, it\u2019s different than it was at the time of the battle. The chapel and this area\u2014including the long barracks\u2014was just a small part of the original Alamo,\u201d Logan explained. \u201cThe walls extended for a quarter of a mile. In fact, that was one of the problems for the defenders once Santa Anna\u2019s men breeched the walls\u2014the place was too big to protect easily. The men who fought here fought hard, and they fought knowing they were likely to die.\u201d He glanced at her. \u201cCourage is being afraid\u2014and going ahead, anyway.\u201d</p><p>Kelsey nodded in agreement.</p> <p>\u201cSanta Anna had his men raise a red flag in a nearby church tower, and that bloodred flag indicated there\u2019d be no quarter given. But, of course, the Alamo was part of a bigger story, and like most history, it depends on who is doing the telling. The Spanish had been in control. They\u2019d signed a treaty ceding Florida to the U.S. and creating a boundary between the United States and Spanish America. But before that, men called impresarios, Stephen Austin among them, had been luring Americans into Texas with land grants that required no down payment. Then the Mexicans fought the Spanish for independence and won. Santa Anna become president, or more accurately, dictator. Texians or Anglo-Americans, and Tejanos, Mexican-Texans, had been living under the Constitution of 1824 until Santa Anna rescinded it and pretty much pissed them all off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich led to what happened here,\u201d she said, absorbed in what he was telling her.</p><p>\u201cRight. But a lot of movies about the Alamo forgot to depict the Tejanos who were part of the effort\u2014and part of the effort to create an independent Texas. Some of the early books and movies about the Alamo were downright racist. The good old Anglo-Americans were the heroes, while the Tejanos who fought just as hard were ignored. I\u2019m glad to say we\u2019re moving past that.\u201d He smiled slightly. \u201cBut it\u2019s also true that regardless of background, these men weren\u2019t on some idealistic mission for freedom and honor. They were like most of us\u2014looking for a way to make a better life for themselves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd there would\u2019ve been no Texas without both groups,\u201d Kelsey remarked.</p><p>His smile deepened. \u201cSanta Anna miscalculated. He thought that his \u2018no quarter given\u2019 policy would scare off the revolutionaries. Instead, \u2018Remember the Alamo!\u2019 became a battle cry. Soon after, the massacre at Goliad occurred. Santa Anna had everyone there executed, and the war became one of revenge as well as Texan independence. Of course, if they\u2019d lost, the whole thing would\u2019ve been described as the Mexicans putting down an uprising by a group of rebels.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Texas did gain its independence and then became part of the United States,\u201d Kelsey said. \u201cI appreciate what you\u2019ve told me. I\u2019m really interested in history.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMe, too. I just want it to be history and not fiction.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a Ranger and obviously Native American,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat\u2019s your history?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery typical of Texas\u2014a real mix. My father\u2019s a quarter Apache and three-fourths Anglo. My mother\u2019s half Norwegian and half Comanche. They\u2019re both all-Texan. And all-American. And they\u2019re alive and well and living happily in Montana now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t the Texas Rangers spend a lot of years battling the Comanches?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said. \u201cBut they also learned from them.\u201d He eased back a little as he spoke, leaning against the bench as he watched the young people around him seek to learn about the past. \u201cA Comanche warrior could ride at breakneck speed\u2014while clinging to the side of his horse with his shield, bow and quiver. He could fire off twelve arrows while a Ranger was trying to reload his rifle. To fight the Comanche, the Rangers had to learn how to do the same\u2014or something equivalent and their fights led to some real renovations in weapons.\u201d He turned to face her. \u201cI like to think I\u2019ve learned from all my ancestors, including the Vikings,\u201d he added with a grin.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d she said, shrugging comically.</p><p>\u201cO\u2019Brien. Are you Irish?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cLike you, I\u2019m mostly all-American mutt, but yes, my dad\u2019s family immigrated from Ireland.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd you come from the Sunshine State. Do you miss it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cOkay, a little. But I\u2019m at the Longhorn, as you know, and Sandy\u2019s an old friend. I have a cousin here, too. Sean Cameron. But he\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>He straightened. \u201cSean Cameron is your cousin?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cWell, a Sean Cameron is my cousin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe works for a company called Magic on Demand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. You know him?\u201d</p><p>He nodded, staring at her.</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s been a consultant for us a few times. I haven\u2019t seen him in quite a while, but one Halloween we had a murder in a haunted house, and he was brought in. He helped the crime-scene people dig through the fake gore and get down to the real evidence.\u201d Logan was quiet for a minute.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she murmured. \u201cDid you always want to be a Texas Ranger?\u201d she asked, changing the subject.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cMy dad was a Ranger,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI always wanted to be a Marshal,\u201d she told him. \u201cI knew it from when I was in high school.\u201d</p><p>He slouched down on the bench, thoughtful as he studied the tourists coming and going. \u201cMost people would say you don\u2019t look the part,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWhat am I supposed to look like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJohn Wayne, maybe.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cDidn\u2019t he play a Texas Ranger once? He was definitely here at the Alamo in one of his movies.\u201d</p><p>He turned to her, but as he did, he saw someone behind her and frowned.</p><p>She turned around, as well, and saw a man. He was the only person in their vicinity and he was dressed in costume, a big wide-brimmed hat, buckskins and boots. She assumed he had to be a member of the little group who\u2019d just reenacted the scene between the men at the Alamo. He obviously knew Logan Raintree and wanted to speak to him, while Raintree looked as if he wanted the man to disappear.</p><p>What was his problem? Logan Raintree was being downright rude, and in her opinion, there was no excuse for that kind of behavior.</p><p>\u201cHello.\u201d She smiled, hoping to compensate for her companion\u2019s lack of courtesy.</p><p>She was startled when Raintree stood abruptly and even the costumed stranger took a step back.</p><p>\u201cWho are you talking to?\u201d Raintree asked suspiciously.</p><p>Kelsey stared at him as if he\u2019d lost his mind. She stood, too, and said pointedly, \u201cThe gentleman you\u2019re ignoring.\u201d She turned back to look at the man in costume, but he was gone.</p><p>When she turned toward Logan Raintree again, his expression had hardened, and he seemed to have withdrawn from her.</p><p>\u201cYou saw a man?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cOf course I saw him,\u201d she said. \u201cHe wanted to talk to you, and you acted like he was a martian or something.\u201d</p><p>As she frowned at him, both of them standing near the chapel of the Alamo, she heard an intense whirring sound.</p><p>Birds.</p><p>Black birds...crows. Settling down, all around them.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you at the morgue tomorrow,\u201d Logan Raintree said, and he began to walk away, his footsteps moving through the sudden sea of birds, scattering them in all directions.</p><p>Chapter Four</p><p>A murder could be easier to solve than the case of a missing person, Kelsey reflected. When a body was discovered, there was a chance to collect evidence and\u2014usually\u2014a trail to follow. When a person had simply disappeared, you had to assume someone must have seen something, but finding that someone was often next to impossible.</p><p>The files they\u2019d been given contained all the known information about Vanessa Johnston, who was last seen purchasing gas at a station near the county line.</p><p>She\u2019d spoken briefly with a young cashier when she had gone in to buy coffee, saying she was excited about going to San Antonio, and then she\u2019d gotten back into her Honda and driven off. Neither she nor the car had been seen since.</p><p>Her cell phone records indicated that she\u2019d made no calls. Nor had she used her charge card again.</p><p>\u201cA car has to show up somewhere,\u201d Kelsey murmured aloud to herself.</p><p>There was a tap on her door. She was in bed\u2014having moved into Room 207\u2014and she rose up, leaning against her pillow.</p><p>\u201cKelsey?\u201d Sandy called.</p><p>\u201cCome on in,\u201d Kelsey said.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t had a chance to speak with Sandy since she\u2019d gotten back; the inn was now full, and there\u2019d been a number of bartenders and waitresses in the busy downstairs area, along with the singer who was reprising old tunes with a piano player. The saloon had been bustling. She\u2019d been glad, since she wasn\u2019t ready to share anything about her day. Yet.</p><p>When she\u2019d returned, however, Corey Simmons had been waiting for her, hoping to buy her a drink. She\u2019d declined. Sandy had packed up his belongings, brought them to Kelsey\u2019s room, then packed up Kelsey\u2019s stuff. He wanted to thank her, he\u2019d said rather sheepishly, for moving into Room 207.</p><p>\u201cHey, just wanted to make sure you\u2019re okay in here,\u201d Sandy told her, stepping inside. Sandy was wearing an apron, since she\u2019d pitched in with the serving downstairs.</p><p>Kelsey smiled. \u201cI\u2019m fine, absolutely fine. Nothing\u2019s going to happen to me in this room,\u201d she assured Sandy. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sandy let out a soft sigh. \u201cWell, thank you. You were wonderful. I can hardly believe Corey decided to stay here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you know, if the inn\u2019s filling up and someone else wants this room, I can always go to another hotel,\u201d Kelsey told her.</p><p>\u201cNo! You\u2019re staying right here. I\u2019m not renting this room to macho men, cowboys or hunters. I\u2019m keeping things calm. I have to make a living on this place!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, then, not to worry. I\u2019ll stay, and I\u2019ll be just fine,\u201d Kelsey said again.</p> <p>\u201cSo, how did your day go? What\u2019s up? What was the big meeting about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell...I\u2019ve been asked to join the FBI,\u201d Kelsey said.</p><p>\u201cReally? Wow! I didn\u2019t know the FBI went out and asked people to join it! Don\u2019t they have an application process and training, and all that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI imagine that\u2019s the usual case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow. You must be special!\u201d</p> <p>Kelsey shrugged one shoulder. \u201cI don\u2019t know about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy you? I mean, honestly, I think that\u2019s amazing!\u201d Sandy said.</p><p>\u201cI am a United States Marshal,\u201d Kelsey reminded her. \u201cI have all the training that went along with that, and they\u2019re both federal agencies.\u201d</p><p>Even with Sandy, she didn\u2019t want to talk about the reasons. And, in fact, those reasons hadn\u2019t actually been discussed. Oddly enough, it hadn\u2019t been necessary. They\u2019d all understood.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t really know,\u201d she lied.</p><p>Sandy came in and perched on the foot of her bed. \u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure yet,\u201d she said evasively. \u201cSandy, forgive me, but I\u2019m not at liberty to discuss any of this yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry! Of course not. I\u2019d just love it, though, if you moved to Texas. I mean, I know you love your home and all, but Texas is a great state.\u201d</p><p>Kelsey made a point of casually closing the folder she\u2019d been reading, then sat up straighter in bed. \u201cI\u2019ll make a decision by tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you can live right here!\u201d Sandy said excitedly.</p><p>Kelsey laughed. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, the scuttlebutt about the room will die out. Or you can bring in one of those ghost expedition groups. Either way, you\u2019ll get lots of business. But I\u2019ll probably stay for a while. So, thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is great,\u201d Sandy said happily, as if it was all settled. \u201cI know Sean is off working now, but you have a cousin here. And you have me. It\u2019ll be like home.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sure it will.\u201d Despite herself, Kelsey yawned.</p><p>Sandy stood quickly. \u201cOkay, well, I\u2019ll let you get some sleep. But I\u2019m so thrilled you\u2019re going to be here! Yay!\u201d She walked to the door. \u201cGood night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood night. Thanks, Sandy.\u201d</p><p>When Sandy had gone, Kelsey got out of bed and went to the door. She hadn\u2019t thought to lock it earlier; now she did.</p><p>She looked at the files again, but she really was tired. Facts, figures and faces were beginning to swim before her eyes. She left the bathroom light on, but turned off the others, set the files on the bedside table and slipped back into bed.</p><p>She should\u2019ve realized she wasn\u2019t going to sleep well that night... .</p><p>At first she felt as if she\u2019d been disturbed by the sound of someone whispering. It was annoying, but not enough to completely wake her. Then she began to see it all again. The room changing, ever so slightly. The Oriental divider by the bathroom door.</p><p>She noticed something different about the darkness with the glow of just the bathroom light.</p><p>No, there was a gas lamp burning.</p><p>Kelsey saw the two people in the room, the man and the woman. She, so beautiful with her dark curling hair piled atop her head and tumbling around her face with a few stray dark locks. The dress lay on the floor, and the woman wore old-fashioned stockings and garters. The man stood in his dark suit.</p><p>As he\u2019d done in her earlier vision, he strode across the room and grabbed the woman. \u201cYou won\u2019t hold out on me!\u201d he shouted. \u201cI want it, and I want it now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have it,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a liar! I know what happened in Galveston that night, and I know that your pretty-boy lover won it. I want it, and I want it now!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s mine,\u201d she responded.</p><p>The rest of the scene played itself out, just as it had earlier that day.</p><p>When the man squeezed the life out of the woman, she went limp. He picked her up and threw her down, the same way he had before.</p><p>Then they both disappeared into the darkness. Seconds later, light began to show from the bathroom and the room resumed its earlier appearance. She\u2019d been unable to move; she\u2019d really never wakened.</p><p>A tiny light seemed to hover directly in front of her. She realized she was seeing a woman\u2019s face. In dream, in vision, in half sleep, in the tormented corners of her mind, she saw a face. She thought it would be Rose Langley, the pathetic creature murdered in this room.</p><p>But it wasn\u2019t. It was a face she\u2019d seen in a picture that day.</p><p>The face of the missing girl, Vanessa Johnston. She wasn\u2019t smiling now. She was sad. She looked at Kelsey and whispered, \u201cToo late.\u201d</p><p>Too late, too late, too late...</p><p>There was a whir of flapping black wings in the room, and the sound they made seemed to mock the words that had been spoken.</p><p>Too late, too late, too late...</p><p>The flapping stopped, and the wings seemed to merge and create a shape.</p><p>A man.</p><p>She saw him only as a silhouette at first. Then he turned to her, his expression grave. It was Logan Raintree, so tall and lean and solid, his face like chiseled marble, his hazel eyes alive and burning.</p><p>\u201cYou saw a man?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>She heard wings again, and now she seemed to be outside. The black birds, the crows, settling all around them, on the ground, the benches and the nearby power lines and poles.</p><p>And then he was gone, and the darkness swept around her.</p><p>When she woke in the morning, she remembered her dream about the murder of Rose Langley, her vision of Vanessa Johnston.</p><p>And the appearance of Logan Raintree in her room.</p><p>Surrounded by crows.</p><p>The Bexar County morgue was large, and a special room had been set aside for the victims who might have been associated with a single killer.</p><p>Jackson Crow did have all the right connections. Logan had been at the morgue often enough in years gone by, and he was familiar with various members of the staff. But he\u2019d never seen anything like the way people scurried for Jackson Crow, nor had he been there when an entire facility was dedicated to one pursuit.</p><p>There were eight gurneys in the room. Each had a sheet draped over the length of a body.</p><p>One sheet was almost flat. He assumed it covered a victim who was little more than bones.</p><p>One of the bodies had already been in the morgue, along with those of Chelsea Martin and Tara Grissom. Five others had been exhumed. They walked from gurney to gurney with Dr. Frazier Gaylord, medical examiner. He carried a clipboard with his notes on the remains of Chelsea and Tara\u2014and the unknowns. The unknowns, of course, had been buried by the county and exhumed by the county, but they had numbers rather than names. Gaylord was thorough in his discussion of each one. Logan kept silent as he followed Jackson and Kelsey. The first body was skeletal and the second had no discernible features. Medical reports indicated that all the women had been between twenty-two and thirty-five; none had borne children. Hair proved to be of every color. Five had been Caucasian and two were Hispanic. One, according to Gaylord, was Asian\u2014Logan didn\u2019t ask what had given him that impression. The girl still had a pretty face beneath the damage and decay. \u201cOr possibly American Indian?\u201d he suggested.</p><p>\u201cNo, I believe she was Chinese,\u201d Gaylord told him. \u201cBased on the set of the skull and the cast of the eyes. There\u2019s enough left...as you can see.\u201d</p><p>Kelsey O\u2019Brien hadn\u2019t said a word. He liked that about her. If she had a question, she asked it. If she didn\u2019t, she listened. Absorbed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m puzzled as to why you\u2019ve put these deaths together,\u201d Gaylord mused, looking at Jackson Crow, \u201csince the cause of death isn\u2019t consistent.\u201d He glanced at his notes. \u201cThere are nicks on this woman\u2019s skeletal remains, suggesting that she was stabbed to death. Broken hyoid bone in the next one suggests strangulation. The young woman over there\u2014\u201d he pointed to the farthest gurney \u201c\u2014was drowned. So, we have, in our collection of Jane Does, two strangulations, three stabbings and a drowning. And, then, of course, we get to the bodies of the two young women who have been identified, Chelsea Martin and Tara Grissom. This is a big city, and that means big-city crime. These poor souls might have encountered any member of the criminal element. Or they might have been murdered by someone in a fit of anger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know yet, Doctor,\u201d Crow said. \u201cLet\u2019s move on, shall we?\u201d</p><p>They walked to the last two gurneys, those holding the remains of Chelsea Martin and Tara Grissom. \u201cWe\u2019re facing the same inconsistency of method.\u201d Gaylord paused to pull back one of the sheets. \u201cChelsea Martin,\u201d he said quietly, \u201cidentified from dental records. As you can see, there wasn\u2019t much left when she was discovered.\u201d</p><p>Chelsea Martin had been found in a trash heap in almost skeletal form. There were still bits of flesh adhering to the bone here and there, and strands of pretty brown hair attached to the scalp that remained. Dr. Gaylord pointed to her throat. \u201cHyoid bone broken. My guess is that this young woman, too, was strangled.\u201d</p><p>They paused for a moment, looking at the gurneys with their sad burdens. Logan found himself thinking of a pirate slogan: Dead men tell no tales!</p><p>Except that the dead could tell tales\u2014when something of the killer stayed behind. When there was a shred of physical evidence. A hair, fiber, skin cells caught in the fingernails of a murder victim. And the dead could tell many tales when they left clues about where they\u2019d been going, who they\u2019d been with... . </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Or when they could actually come back.</p><p>The others were moving on.

The remains of Tara Grissom were so gruesome they appeared to be something created by a special-effects master for a horror movie. \u201cHalf-covered. Half in the ground, half out,\u201d Gaylord said. He indicated areas of the body. \u201cBut you\u2019ll see here that a knife was used on her. It was thrust into the abdomen several times, once in the throat, and the fatal blow chipped a rib\u2014here\u2014and pierced the heart. Death couldn\u2019t have been easy for this poor girl.\u201d</p> <p>Tara Grissom had half a decaying face.</p><p>Gaylord went on talking to Jackson Crow, telling him they\u2019d been thorough with the autopsy. Scraping had been done under the nails, the crime-scene units had considered every conceivable clue or chance of DNA evidence. He launched into an explanation of their procedures, but Logan had ceased to hear him. He was vaguely aware that Kelsey O\u2019Brien was giving him, rather than Crow or Gaylord, her attention. She was still, silent, as she gazed at him, standing a few feet back.</p><p>Logan didn\u2019t care that she was watching him. He stepped closer to the gurney.</p><p>He closed his eyes briefly, then touched the remains.</p><p>Speak to me.</p> <p>He looked down. For a moment, he saw her as she\u2019d been in life. Young, beautiful, vivacious, a dancer with a dancer\u2019s grace of movement. She opened her eyes, and they were both there, lime-green eyes that were striking with the lovely blond hair. She tried to offer him a wistful smile. Her lips moved.</p><p>\u201cI barely saw him,\u201d she seemed to say. \u201cHe came out of the darkness, and he was in darkness. I fought so hard, but I was bleeding... . I just kept thinking that I\u2019d never dance again. I didn\u2019t even realize at first that I\u2019d never breathe again.\u201d</p><p>Her voice was real to him. He could hear her as plainly as if Gaylord were saying the words.</p><p>Where were you? he asked in silence.</p><p>But she didn\u2019t reply.</p><p>Back at the station, in the dedicated room, Logan sat contemplatively, watching Kelsey O\u2019Brien as she worked. Besides the computer screen, she used a board and markers, attaching photos of the victims\u2019 remains. By each of them, she made notes. They were alone in the room.</p> <p>\u201cAll right,\u201d she said, \u201cwe know that we\u2019re looking at one woman who disappeared a year and a half ago, and one who disappeared a year ago. Because of the deterioration, Dr. Gaylord can\u2019t precisely pin down the time of death, but...\u201d She paused, pointing at one of the pictures. He\u2019d already learned that Kelsey couldn\u2019t think of the unidentified victims as Jane Doe I, II, III and so on, and she\u2019d given them names. They were Jane Doe, Jenny Doe, Judy Doe, Jodie Doe, Julie Doe and, finally, Josie Doe. He\u2019d seen that she had tremendous empathy for all their victims, although she was professional as she handled photos that could churn any stomach. She indicated Julie Doe. \u201cBut! Dr. Gaylord believes Julie is the most recent victim, and that she\u2019s been dead around a month.\u201d She went back to the photo of Tara Grissom. \u201cAs you know, Tara was found half-hidden by a tarp in a boatyard on the river, one that had been closed down for a year. Chelsea was found at the bottom of a compost heap at a nursery. There was no known connection between her and anyone there, and all the employees checked out when the police investigated. Let\u2019s get to our other women. Jane, discovered by a rock pile near a pond at a public park. Strangled. Jenny was found by garbage men at a trash dump\u2014stabbed to death. Judy in another park, again by some rocks, half in and half out of the water, strangled. Jodie was dragged out of the river. Cause of death, drowning. Julie was found when divers were cleaning out a park pond. She was strangled. And Josie was in a compost heap, too. She\u2019d been stabbed. The killer is incredibly lucky. He keeps disposing of the bodies in almost public ways, and yet he\u2019s never seen, and he doesn\u2019t leave anything behind. Not a fiber, a hair...nothing. To the best of Gaylord\u2019s ability to discern, considering the amount of decomposition, the women weren\u2019t sexually molested. But...it appears that our killer is escalating his activities. Say his first murder was a year and a half ago, then a year ago...and then every couple of months, and now every month. We have another missing woman at the moment, who may or may not be his ninth victim.\u201d She stopped speaking and looked at him. He\u2019d heard her voice and her words, but he realized he\u2019d been concentrating on the woman herself more than anything she had to say. Kelsey was young, but she was grave. Mature. Only when he\u2019d seen her really smile, while they talked at the Alamo, had it occurred to him that she was probably in her mid-to-late twenties. When she smiled, her face lit up, and her emerald-green eyes became enchanting.</p><p>She was the same age as their victims.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think the drowning victim was attacked by the same killer,\u201d he said. \u201cThe rest, I believe, were. And he\u2019s local. He knows exactly where people will and won\u2019t look. But why? And how has he managed to kill them without anyone seeing a thing?\u201d</p><p>She was pensive. \u201cAt the Alamo,\u201d she said quietly, meeting his eyes.</p><p>He admitted that he was glad they were by themselves. Jackson Crow had stayed at the morgue where Jake had joined him to take photographs; they were going to work with artists to reconstruct the faces of the dead.</p><p>He studied her a moment longer. He winced, staring down at the floor. He felt strangely close to her, although he had no idea why. And he felt guilty. He\u2019d loved his wife with his whole heart. He\u2019d been responsible for her death, not directly but responsible nonetheless. It wasn\u2019t that he hadn\u2019t found another woman attractive since her death. He\u2019d dated casually in the past year, and even gone home with a woman from a bar a time or two. There was something different about that, something that, for good or ill, spoke of a lack of feeling.</p><p>But he had a connection with Kelsey O\u2019Brien, and before he\u2019d recognized that, he\u2019d noted how beautiful she was, how conscientious, competent, bright and...appealing.</p><p>And so now, although they\u2019d scarcely touched, he felt that he\u2019d become too involved with her. Intimate in an unfamiliar way.</p> <p>He steeled himself; this was a professional matter. Women were dead. More women could die. A killer had gotten away with heinous acts for a long time.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t shut me out, please,\u201d she said, and he had to look away again. He wasn\u2019t shutting her out\u2014not deliberately, and not on a professional level.</p><p>\u201cYou saw Zachary at the Alamo yesterday,\u201d he said, his voice louder than he\u2019d intended.</p><p>\u201cZachary? The guy in costume?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He smiled, amused despite himself. The question was so innocent.</p><p>\u201cHe wasn\u2019t in costume. He\u2019s dead,\u201d Logan told her.</p><p>He\u2019d taken her by surprise. That was certain. Eyes wide, she groped for a chair, then sat down across from him.</p><p>\u201cDead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLong dead,\u201d Logan went on, feeling a bit incredulous. \u201cCome on, you must be aware that you\u2019re a wind-spirit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWind-spirit?\u201d she repeated, like an automaton.</p><p>\u201cThat term came from my dad\u2019s family,\u201d he said. \u201cIt means you speak with the dead. You see ghosts. You hear them and see them, and you can actually carry on conversations with them.\u201d</p><p>Kelsey swallowed hard. She set her hands on the table, and they were trembling.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re here,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cYes. But you knew that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I guess I did,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd so did you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He drummed his fingers on the table. \u201cI suppose I didn\u2019t want to admit it. I thought it was a part of my life that I just kept quiet, and used when I needed to. When it didn\u2019t fail me,\u201d he added, and he could hear the rasp in his voice. He cleared his throat; there was no reason to make Kelsey think he hated her for what had been his own shortcoming. \u201cI know all about Adam Harrison, his early links to the government and various strange cases, and his decision to start Jackson Crow\u2019s Krewe of Hunters team. I even know about the cases they\u2019ve solved, and some of their considerable accomplishments.\u201d</p><p>She regarded him with her beautiful gemlike eyes. They reminded him of emeralds, they were such a deep, true green.</p><p>\u201cThen why are you so determined to be against Jackson Crow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019ve failed, miserably, upon occasion,\u201d he told her flatly.</p><p>\u201cBut people fail in many situations, and maybe this kind of force can make a difference,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cFor the moment, I\u2019m in. I am a Texas Ranger, this is my state and I\u2019m appalled that these poor women are dead and we weren\u2019t even aware of a connection. And now there\u2019s another missing girl.\u201d</p><p>He saw an expression of shock on her face.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s dead,\u201d Kelsey whispered.</p><p>He frowned. \u201cHow do you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLast night...well, it could just be a dream.\u201d He looked at her steadily and she blinked, then explained. \u201cI\u2019m not sure\u2014maybe I simply have a cinematic imagination. But I see what I suppose they call residual haunting. I see the murder in Room 207, the one that took place in the nineteenth century. When Rose Langley was killed. The first time I saw it was yesterday, right before we met for lunch. I really didn\u2019t have any experiences at the inn before that. But last night I moved into Room 207. The Longhorn is filling up\u2014there\u2019s a rodeo here next week, and Sandy asked me to stay in 207, as a favor to her. When I went to sleep, the same scene played out before me. Then there was a tremendous flapping of wings\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWings?\u201d he interrupted.</p><p>\u201cYes, as though birds were whirling around.\u201d She paused. \u201cLike they did yesterday, at the Alamo.\u201d</p><p>He was silent.</p><p>\u201cHmm, wait. I saw the first haunting, the residual one, and then, when that faded away, I saw her face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you know it was hers?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBecause Jake Mallory showed it to me on the screen before I left yesterday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut if you\u2019d seen her face, maybe you were just recalling it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe said, \u2018Too late.\u2019 Then the birds seemed to take up the cry. Over and over again. Too late, too late, too late.\u201d</p><p>He watched her as she spoke. She never took her eyes from his, and he sensed how hard it was for her to say all this to him. He didn\u2019t speak for a moment. \u201cYou figure...I\u2019m a little on the unbalanced side?\u201d she finally asked. She tried to smile.</p><p>He shook his head slowly and offered her a wry smile. \u201cI have Apache in me. The Apache believe in the dream state. They\u2019re very religious people. Spirits take on the form of humans, and there\u2019s an afterlife, in which everyone lives in happiness and abundance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes that mean you do think it\u2019s possible that the dead speak to us in dreams?\u201d</p> <p>He laughed suddenly. \u201cWell, you already know that I speak to a dead man at the Alamo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I hadn\u2019t known he was dead until you told me. He died at the Alamo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but not the way you probably think. He\u2019d been a courier\u2014he was sent out by Travis during the siege. Travis kept sending out letters, because he was desperate for more men. Zachary Chase rode out on March 5, and Santa Anna\u2019s troops attacked in full strength before dawn the next morning. So Zachary survived the Alamo and went on to fight at San Jacinto\u2014the battle that won independence for Texas. He survived it, too, but returned to live in San Antonio. He died near the bench where we were sitting, a heart attack most likely brought on by the wounds he\u2019d received fighting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, he\u2019s real. I mean, as real as a ghost can be. Maybe he can help us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf he\u2019d seen anything, he would have told me already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou speak to him often?\u201d she asked. \u201cReally speak to him?\u201d She hesitated. \u201cLike the girl on the gurney this morning. Tara Grissom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOften enough,\u201d he said. He winced a little. \u201cZachary loves to play games. He finds it hysterical to make me talk to him when there are people around. He loves it when they stare at me as if I\u2019m insane. I keep trying to tell him it\u2019s not a good thing to make people think that a Ranger with a gun is a crazy man.\u201d</p><p>She smiled at that but quickly turned serious again. \u201cIf he didn\u2019t die there, why does he haunt the Alamo?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cGuilt, I imagine,\u201d Logan replied. \u201cHe was chosen to ride out the day before. His friends and comrades all died, and he didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he risked his own life, riding through enemy lines to get the message out,\u201d Kelsey said.</p><p>\u201cI agree. And yet if we feel guilt, if we believe it in our own minds, that\u2019s what\u2019s true to us,\u201d he said.</p><p>He heard his own words.</p> <p>It was certainly true for him.</p><p>But I am guilty! he told himself. I arrested Rory Norton. I brought him down, and I brought him in, and he sat on death row. And Alana died because of it.</p><p>Rory Norton had viciously killed at least a dozen people. He\u2019d shot anyone who had gone against him, and if he hadn\u2019t carried out the murder himself, he\u2019d ordered it. He\u2019d also been responsible for dozens of other deaths with the hardcore drugs he\u2019d supplied.</p><p>If Logan hadn\u2019t been so determined to bring him down, if he\u2019d let another Ranger or another law enforcement agent take him in...</p><p>\u201cWe can carry guilt all the way to the grave,\u201d Kelsey said. \u201cThat\u2019s so sad.\u201d She stood suddenly. \u201cWe have to go and speak with him.\u201d</p><p>Logan groaned. \u201cIn broad daylight\u2014two of us talking to a ghost? Kelsey, there are going to be tourists all over right now!\u201d</p><p>He realized he\u2019d just called her by her given name for the first time. She hadn\u2019t even noticed.</p><p>\u201cYes, but we need to find out what your friend knows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not actually what you\u2019d call a friend,\u201d Logan said.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a ghost.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he was living, and he must like you\u2014 I think he was trying to talk to you yesterday when you were so rude!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t rude. He wanted to make me look foolish in front of you, and I didn\u2019t appreciate it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLogan, he was trying to speak to you,\u201d she insisted.</p><p>\u201cHe would\u2019ve told me if he\u2019d known anything,\u201d Logan said again.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t learn about this last disappearance until yesterday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true, but if Zachary had seen a woman in distress, he would have mentioned it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe he didn\u2019t realize a woman was in distress.\u201d</p><p>Logan thought about the morgue, and how the corpse had opened its eyes. \u201cTara said she was attacked in the darkness,\u201d he murmured. \u201cShe didn\u2019t say she was at the Alamo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been in the plaza at night, and even with the lights that focus on the chapel, it can be very dark. And the areas surrounding it are dark, too. But we do know that Chelsea\u2019s last conversation with her friend took place at the Alamo. The conversation that was interrupted by what she called \u2018a man in costume\u2019\u2014and by that voice we heard on the tape. Logan! What\u2019s the matter with you? We actually have someone who could steer us in the right direction, and you\u2019re hesitating.\u201d</p><p>He stood. \u201cFine. Let\u2019s go to the Alamo.\u201d</p><p>They sat on the same bench and watched as tourists came and went. It wasn\u2019t hot; the sun was bright and the day was beautiful. But Logan was anxious, worrying about the dozen tangible things they could be doing instead.</p><p>Mothers pushed infants in strollers, dads walked by holding the hands of toddlers. The citizens of San Antonio, along with the many tourists visiting the Alamo, passed by.</p><p>They waited an hour, and there was no sign of Zachary Chase.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand. Why doesn\u2019t he come?\u201d Kelsey asked.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a ghost. He appears when he chooses to,\u201d Logan said. He hid a smile, looking at her. She was wearing a business suit again, this one a navy pinstripe with an attractive flare to the jacket and a tailored pale blue blouse beneath it. She wore little heels, maybe an inch high. They must look like an odd couple, with her so formally, even severely, dressed and him in jeans and a buckskin jacket. He was never without his service weapon, though. It was hidden by his jacket.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t there a way for you to contact him?\u201d she asked, her eyes brilliant as she turned to him.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Call him on his cell phone?\u201d</p><p>She grimaced and wagged a finger at him. \u201cWe might\u2019ve lost a valuable opportunity yesterday. You have to learn not to be so hostile.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not hostile.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just said that with tremendous hostility,\u201d she said.</p><p>He started to laugh; despite their circumstances, she could somehow make him feel lighter.</p><p>But then his laughter faded.</p><p>A black bird suddenly landed in front of his feet. It looked at him, tilting its head.</p><p>He thought he heard a flutter of wings, and turned to see that birds had begun to light down around them. He wondered if he was wearing aftershave with bird pheromones and felt an odd sensation of dread.</p><p>\u201cThe birds again,\u201d Kelsey said in a low voice.</p><p>Startled, he looked at her.</p><p>\u201cThere was a crow at the kitchen window yesterday morning,\u201d she told him. \u201cAnd then here and, after that, in my dream.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Comanche believe differently from the Apache,\u201d he explained. \u201cThey believe all creatures bring power, and we can look to them for the particular energy and power they provide.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to admit, I feel as though I\u2019m in an Alfred Hitchcock movie,\u201d she said, frowning.</p><p>\u201cI thought that, too. At first. Half these guys are crows. Like Jackson Crow,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cYou think Jackson Crow is controlling the birds?\u201d she asked skeptically.</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m thinking along the Comanche line,\u201d he told her. \u201cThey\u2019re here for a reason. They\u2019re here to give us power.\u201d</p><p>The birds settled around them, but did nothing that was in any way frightening. He remembered the hawk that had taken down its prey in front of him. That had been just yesterday morning. The hawk had almost dared him to try to take its kill.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t done so, but he\u2019d held his ground. Which was when he\u2019d seen the mass of crows and myriad other birds.</p><p>\u201cWe can walk around the Alamo,\u201d he suggested to Kelsey.</p><p>She nodded. \u201cAll right. Since Zachary doesn\u2019t carry a cell phone.\u201d</p><p>She stood and he joined her. He took a step forward, then paused. One of the birds was swooping toward them. Instinctively, he reached out to draw Kelsey against his chest. He thought the bird might be attacking.</p><p>But it dropped something at their feet and flew on.</p><p>Kelsey straightened, pulling down her jacket and brushing back her hair.</p><p>\u201cThe little bastard was dive-bombing us!\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cNo...no, it wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Logan bent down to see what the bird had dropped. It looked like a small twig, tipped in red paint.</p><p>Kelsey gasped as his hand closed around it, and he realized what he was seeing wasn\u2019t paint.</p><p>It was nail polish. On the well-manicured nail of a finger.</p><p>A human finger.</p><p>Chapter Five</p><p>\u201cThis is what I think it is, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Kelsey asked.</p><p>Logan nodded. Kelsey was prepared; she reached into her purse and produced an evidence bag. \u201cWe have to bring it right in,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to call Crow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut shouldn\u2019t we\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019d rather we took it to someone else I know. Someone not associated with this case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...Gaylord has to be competent. Otherwise, I\u2019m sure Jackson Crow would\u2019ve brought in a different medical examiner,\u201d Kelsey said. But that didn\u2019t seem to sway his opinion. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cFine. Your call,\u201d she said, shrugging. He got through to Crow, and when he\u2019d finished, he told her, \u201cWe\u2019re going into the office. Crow\u2019s calling someone. Someone I like better than Gaylord.\u201d</p><p>As she walked briskly toward his car\u2014his strides were long when he was in a hurry\u2014Kelsey asked him, \u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>He glanced her way. \u201cThere\u2019s a new, younger woman at the M.E.\u2019s office. I\u2019ve worked with her on a few cases. She\u2019s not as matter-of-fact as Gaylord. Don\u2019t get me wrong, Gaylord is competent, he\u2019s just been at it too long. To him, a body is a body. Kat Sokolov has a greater...I don\u2019t know, investment in her cases.\u201d</p> <p>Kelsey grinned.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cStrange. When I first met you, I took you for matter-of-fact.\u201d</p><p>He smiled slightly, and Kelsey realized she was pleased when she made him smile. And even though she prided herself on her abilities, she\u2019d liked it when he\u2019d protected her from the bird.</p><p>Stop thinking that way! she warned herself.</p> <p>When they returned to the station, Jackson Crow was there with Jake Mallory and a pretty, petite blond woman with large blue eyes. She hugged Logan, then turned to Kelsey with an open smile.</p><p>\u201cLogan already knows Katya, Kelsey, so I\u2019ll introduce you two,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cKatya, Marshal Kelsey O\u2019Brien. Kelsey, Dr. Katya Sokolov.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoctor, it\u2019s a pleasure,\u201d Kelsey said. \u201cI\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Kat, please!\u201d the other woman interrupted. \u201cI\u2019m not formal with my clients.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m just Kelsey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere it is.\u201d Logan produced the finger in the evidence bag.</p> <p>Kat lifted the bag first and studied the finger through the plastic. \u201cSome decomp, but not too bad\u2014not like the others,\u201d she said. \u201cThe finger wasn\u2019t severed. It was ripped off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould the birds have done this?\u201d Logan asked. \u201cA crow dropped it in front of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Birds have very powerful beaks. That probably means the body\u2019s nearby, which should make it easier to find the rest of her,\u201d Kat said. She brought the finger to the small lab area of their assigned space. \u201cI\u2019ll have to send off samples, you know,\u201d she said, turning to Jackson.</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>Kat placed the finger under the microscope; when Jake hit some buttons on the computer, it appeared before them, larger than life on the screen. \u201cForefinger,\u201d Kat said. \u201cAnd it belonged to a young woman. White, I\u2019d say. The polish is a gel\u2014the kind that stays on for two to three weeks.\u201d She looked around, and Kelsey wasn\u2019t sure if she was seeking Jackson\u2019s approval or Logan\u2019s. \u201cWe\u2019ll be able to get a good DNA comparison, and that\u2019ll tell you if this belongs to your missing girl. I\u2019ll send out samples today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a chance that...that there is no body, right?\u201d Kelsey asked. \u201cThe finger might have been severed before death?\u201d</p><p>Kat shook her head. \u201cThe way it\u2019s been dislodged, with no blood coagulation, makes me suspect it came from someone who no longer had a beating heart. But, to be fair, I can\u2019t be a hundred percent certain.\u201d</p><p>Logan took Kelsey\u2019s arm. \u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cWhere are we going now?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cTo look for crows.\u201d</p><p>They drove for what felt like hours, in every direction around the Alamo. But although they stopped more than a dozen times, digging through garbage pits, trash piles and any other place a body could conceivably be hidden, they found nothing.</p><p>Logan was frustrated. \u201cWe have to find Vanessa Johnston quickly,\u201d he said.</p><p>She laid a hand on his arm. \u201cWe will find her, but even if there\u2019s a flock of birds up there the size of a 747, I doubt we\u2019d see them anymore. It\u2019s too dark. Time to quit for the night. Besides, we can\u2019t continue the search if we don\u2019t get some rest.\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cAll right. Where\u2019s your car?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt the Longhorn. Or rather, the parking garage across the street. Jackson picked me up this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll take you back.\u201d</p><p>When they reached the inn, Kelsey said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you come in with me? You\u2019re curious about the saloon. You can talk to Sandy, and she can tell you more about what was going on with Sierra Monte and the bloody disappearance in Room 207 a year ago. It\u2019s highly possible that Sierra died by the same hand that\u2019s killed these other girls.\u201d</p><p>He looked at her, shaking his head. \u201cThe Sierra Monte case is still open. It did occur to me, of course, except that none of the remains match her DNA. Honestly, we\u2019re not inept in Texas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to imply that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBodies with no names. And now a name with no body,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cPlease, just park. Come in. The food here is good,\u201d Kelsey encouraged him.</p><p>He found parking, and they walked into the Longhorn together.</p><p>Inside, the saloon was lively. That night, Sandy had a trio\u2014piano player, fiddler and guitarist\u2014playing on stage, and the music was at a pleasant level. Poker games that involved peanuts were going on at a few of the tables, and people seemed to be enjoying themselves.</p><p>\u201cRodeo in town,\u201d Logan said. He set a hand on Kelsey\u2019s shoulder and whispered, \u201cOver there, at three o\u2019clock. The real deal. See how his jeans are worn and his hat\u2019s been folded a million times? And his boots are scuffed to pieces. There...\u201d He turned her slightly. \u201cTen o\u2019clock. A city slicker down to play cowboy. Shiny new boots. Designer cowboy shirt. Face clean and pure as a newborn babe\u2019s\u2014no nicks, scrapes or scars from a tumble or an argument with a bull or a bronco. Or even a calf.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOuch,\u201d Kelsey said. \u201cJudgmental, aren\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. I hope they all come to San Antonio and have a good time\u2014and keep the city prospering.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d Sandy said happily, swinging past them, her fingers twined around a half-dozen beer steins. \u201cWelcome, sit, I\u2019ll be right with you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can help,\u201d Kelsey called after her.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be silly! You\u2019d be like a bull in a china shop. We\u2019ve got it covered,\u201d Sandy called back.</p><p>Kelsey gave an offhand shrug as they went to scrub their hands. \u201cShe\u2019s remembering the time at camp when I spilled a whole tray of juice glasses\u2014which happened to be full,\u201d she told Logan.</p><p>On their way back from the restroom, she noticed that Ricky, one of the bartenders, had come from behind the long saloon bar and was waving to her, gesturing to a small table near the stage. \u201cC\u2019mon,\u201d Kelsey said, and Logan followed her.</p><p>They sat, with Ricky promising he\u2019d bring them a couple of beers. Logan looked around, studying all the renovations. \u201cYou\u2019re right. Your friend has done a great job. It\u2019s as if you stepped back into the nineteenth century. Very different from when I was last here, which has to be more than three years ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe rooms are beautiful, too,\u201d Kelsey assured him.</p><p>Ricky brought their beers. He was twenty-four, eternally cheerful and he loved working in the saloon. \u201cThe special is barbecue beef. And it really is special.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBarbecue beef for me,\u201d Kelsey said. \u201cWould you like a menu?\u201d she asked Logan.</p><p>\u201cRefuse a special that\u2019s special?\u201d he asked. \u201cMake it two, please, Ricky.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d caught Ricky\u2019s name, although she\u2019d said it only once when he delivered the beers. Kelsey liked that he was cordial to those who waited on him. She glanced away, wondering again what was the matter with her. She was listing his good points as if she was planning to bring him home to her mom, and she had to remind herself that their relationship was professional\u2014they were working together\u2014and that he could be a real hard-ass.</p><p>She was startled when someone suddenly swooped down on her, giving her a mammoth hug, then stepping back quickly in acknowledgment of Logan. \u201cSorry, sir! But this young lady is my heroine. Forgive me if I got too friendly.\u201d</p><p>Kelsey turned to Logan, \u201cThis is Mr. Corey Simmons, Logan. Corey, Ranger Logan Raintree. Corey is here for the rodeo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you,\u201d Logan said, rising to accept Corey\u2019s outstretched hand.</p><p>\u201cPleasure is mine. Hey, now, we\u2019re not in any trouble for rabble-rousing, are we, Ranger?\u201d Corey asked, his grin wide.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just here for the barbecue,\u201d Logan told him, taking his seat again.</p><p>Corey dragged over an unused chair, and set it, facing backward, in front of the table. He straddled it, resting his elbows on the chair back.</p><p>\u201cGuess I\u2019m being a little nosy, but I happen to know that the lady is a U.S. Marshal,\u201d Corey said. \u201cAnd glad of it, I am. She\u2019s a brave soul, and I had to beg her not to let the world know that I\u2019m willing to ride any bull\u2014but afraid of my own shadow.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d wondered if Logan was going to be irritated by the cowboy joining them; he wasn\u2019t. He gave Corey a broad smile. \u201cAny one of us can be spooked, Simmons,\u201d Logan said. \u201cSo, you\u2019re taking part in next week\u2019s rodeo?\u201d</p><p>Corey nodded. \u201cI\u2019m going to stay on the bull longest, I swear it! And I ride a fine barrel race, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood luck to you,\u201d Logan said. \u201cTell me about your experience in Room 207.\u201d</p><p>Corey Simmons had the grace to blush. \u201cWell, of course, now I\u2019m thinking I let my imagination run away with me, you know? What with that awful story about the room... Well, there\u2019s the older story, too, but it\u2019s the new one that scares the bejesus outta me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you didn\u2019t really see anything?\u201d Logan asked him.</p><p>\u201cIt was like I opened my eyes and saw a sea of blood everywhere! Dripping down the walls, on the floor...well, I\u2019m just glad to be outta there. I would\u2019ve left the inn if it wasn\u2019t for the Marshal here!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Logan looked at her with some amusement. Kelsey shrugged.</p><p>\u201cWe all get carried away now and then,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>They were close to the bar. As she spoke, she saw that a man sitting on one of the wooden stools at the end had turned toward them. He didn\u2019t look like a cowboy. He was tall and thin and wearing jeans, but with a tailored shirt and loafers. His hair was cut stylishly short, and there was nothing weathered about him. He saw her looking at him, and slid off his bar stool, coming toward them.</p> <p>\u201cOh, Lord help us,\u201d Logan groaned.</p><p>\u201cWho is it?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>She didn\u2019t have to wait to find out. Corey grinned broadly. \u201cIt\u2019s the newspaper man!\u201d he said, apparently pleased that they\u2019d drawn his attention.</p><p>But when the man approached and said, \u201cWhy, Mr. Simmons, did I hear that correctly? You were scared out of your room by a vision of blood on the walls?\u201d Corey wasn\u2019t so pleased anymore.</p><p>\u201cNo, you didn\u2019t hear anything correctly, Murphy,\u201d he said. \u201cListening in on other people\u2019s conversations is rude, and if you write about a conversation you think you heard, I\u2019ll denounce you as a liar!\u201d</p> <p>Kelsey noticed that Logan didn\u2019t stand. \u201cYou\u2019re interrupting a private conversation, Ted,\u201d he told the man. \u201cYou\u2019re not welcome here,\u201d he added.</p><p>No one seemed to want the man around. It didn\u2019t stop him.</p><p>\u201cSo, word is out that you spent the day at the morgue, Ranger Raintree. What\u2019s going on? Is there a serial killer loose in the city, and you\u2019re not alerting the public?\u201d</p><p>Kelsey watched Logan\u2019s fingers clench his beer stein. It was made of heavy glass, but she was afraid it would shatter. He managed to look up at the man. \u201cActually, I\u2019m not with the Rangers right now, Murphy, and if there\u2019s something to be said, you\u2019ll hear it from a law enforcement spokesperson. I\u2019m here for dinner with a friend, and I\u2019d appreciate it if you let us enjoy that dinner in peace.\u201d</p><p>Murphy was persistent. \u201cFriend?\u201d Murphy\u2019s eyes snapped to Kelsey. \u201cWhat kind of slacker do you think I am, Raintree? Friend? This is Marshal Kelsey O\u2019Brien, in from Florida. So, what is it? Drug running? Murder? Or murders, plural?\u201d</p><p>Logan stood at last, towering over Murphy. \u201cIf you don\u2019t leave, we will. Kelsey, I\u2019m sorry, but...\u201d</p> <p>She stood, too.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take care of this creep, if you want,\u201d Corey Simmons said, grinning. \u201cYou can\u2019t touch him. That would be Ranger or Marshal brutality. But I\u2019m just an old cowboy, and I can take him out. It\u2019d be worth the night in jail.\u201d</p><p>By then, patrons near them had heard the confrontation, and with Logan and Corey Simmons both looming over Murphy, the tension and testosterone seemed to be rippling through the bar.</p><p>Sandy came rushing over. \u201cTed Murphy! What are you doing? Get out! See that sign over the bar? It says the owner has discretion over who should and shouldn\u2019t be served. You\u2019re creating a public disturbance, and you\u2019re going to ruin my business, and if you do, I promise I\u2019ll sue you\u2014and your paper\u2014up the wazoo. Do you understand me?\u201d</p><p>Ted Murphy had already taken a few steps back. No doubt he\u2019d known he wasn\u2019t going to taunt Logan Raintree into pounding him and creating negative press for the Texas Rangers. Corey Simmons didn\u2019t seem to care about the consequences.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ve gotten what I came for,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cGood evening, ladies and gentlemen.\u201d He turned away, took the time to drop cash on the bar and walked out.</p><p>\u201cThat sniveling little bastard!\u201d Logan said.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s gone now. Please, sit, enjoy the saloon,\u201d Sandy pleaded, glancing from him to Kelsey.</p> <p>Kelsey nodded and glanced at Logan.</p><p>\u201cSure. I\u2019m looking forward to a special special barbecue,\u201d he said with a smile. Kelsey sat, he sat and so did Corey Simmons.</p><p>\u201cEase up,\u201d Kelsey warned Logan softly. \u201cYou\u2019re going to break that glass.\u201d</p><p>He stared at his hand, at his white knuckles against the bronze of his skin.</p><p>Then he grinned, but it was a deadly grin. \u201cGod knows what the man is going to plaster all over that damn tabloid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen it\u2019s a rag. Who cares?\u201d Kelsey asked.</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s a local paper, a daily, but it sure ain\u2019t a very respectable one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy point exactly,\u201d Kelsey said.</p><p>\u201cHey, it\u2019s me he\u2019s going to skewer,\u201d Corey said. \u201cBig \u2019fraidy-cat tough-boy cowboy. But you know what? He\u2019ll get his. I promise you,\u201d Corey said. \u201cDrink up, friends, drink up!\u201d He lifted his stein. Kelsey politely lifted hers in return. Obviously, Corey could see that Logan\u2019s mood hadn\u2019t lightened. He stood, winking at Kelsey. \u201cI\u2019ll just leave you two alone now. If you need me, you know where to find me!\u201d</p><p>When he\u2019d left, Logan looked at Kelsey. \u201cMurphy truly is a rat,\u201d he told her. \u201cHe\u2019ll put all kinds of half-truths in the paper, and get the public going, screaming that the police and the Rangers are putting the city in danger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt may not be that bad,\u201d Kelsey said. She tried to smile. \u201cHey, I come from Key West. If news isn\u2019t bizarre, it\u2019s worthless.\u201d</p><p>He finally cracked a real smile. Then it faded. \u201cSorry. I don\u2019t loathe many people, but I loathe that man. When my wife...\u201d</p><p>His voice trailed off. She was surprised to feel her heart sink.</p><p>He had a wife. Well, that wasn\u2019t a great surprise. The man was walking sexuality, rugged and masculine to a fault.</p><p>After a moment, he continued speaking. \u201cWhen my wife was murdered, and I found her just minutes too late...\u201d</p><p>He shook his head and then looked at her again. \u201cIt was one of those instances. The kind we\u2019ve talked about. I found her because I heard her.\u201d He brought his fingers to his forehead. \u201cIn here,\u201d he said. \u201cI heard her crying out, and then, after I found her, I realized I\u2019d heard her because she was dead. I\u2019d put a killer on death row, and his brother wasn\u2019t happy. When the trial was over, he kidnapped my wife\u2014and didn\u2019t give a damn if the world knew who\u2019d done it. He said he\u2019d heard I had \u2018Injun powers,\u2019 and that if I wanted her back, he\u2019d give me clues, but I\u2019d have to use those powers. I don\u2019t think he even meant to kill her\u2014he buried her alive, but he didn\u2019t set up the oxygen supply right, and she suffocated. I got to her, but too late. We put her killer on death row, too, but...\u201d He paused. \u201cReporters all over were writing about the case. I never said how I found her, never spoke to anyone about it. I was sent on leave. When Murphy got wind of what happened, he wrote an article about Indian dream states, one that actually suggested Texas Rangers with Native American blood used peyote, and that my, uh, supposed drug habit might have been the reason Alana was so easily taken. There was a protest, of course\u2014the Department of Public Safety was going to sue. I didn\u2019t know about it, and I didn\u2019t give a damn about it at the time. But the article couched the insinuations so carefully that everything was merely a suggestion. An implication. And in the end there was no lawsuit. Murphy isn\u2019t stupid. He\u2019s a vicious bastard, but he isn\u2019t stupid. If he puts anything out there now, it\u2019ll be filled with innuendo, but he\u2019ll manage to make us all look like bumbling idiots.\u201d</p><p>Kelsey wasn\u2019t sure what to say; she felt his pain and bitterness as if it were a tidal wave, washing across the table and sweeping her in. She wanted to touch him, tell him she was sorry, but he didn\u2019t seem the kind of man who wanted pity. Before she could decide what, if anything, to do, Ricky came bearing their dinner plates, oblivious to the recent conflict.</p><p>\u201cHere we go, an extraspecial dinner special!\u201d With a flourish he served them. \u201cRight back with the barbecue sauces\u2014hot, spicy and mild for the faint of heart.\u201d</p><p>Logan straightened, a forced smile coming to his lips, something of a mask slipping over his features, hiding his thoughts and emotions. \u201cThanks.\u201d He glanced at Kelsey. \u201cTexas barbecue is famous, you know. And when it\u2019s special\u2014well, there\u2019s nothing better.\u201d</p><p>She felt that Logan had long since learned to cope with both his fury and his agony, concealing them behind stoicism. She felt numb and awkward herself; she\u2019d learned so much about investigating people, but it hadn\u2019t occurred to her to find out more about Logan Raintree. Then again, they were on the same side. But she didn\u2019t know how to react. She couldn\u2019t move so quickly from an agitated state to a relaxed one, and she must have stared at him, stricken, when she should have been doing or saying something\u2014anything\u2014else.</p><p>\u201cGod, I am so, so sorry. I didn\u2019t know,\u201d she said at last, her voice shaking.</p><p>\u201cAnd you shouldn\u2019t have known. We can\u2019t work together with you tiptoeing around my feelings. I\u2019m sorry\u2014it\u2019s just that Murphy is the one person who can hit exactly the right buttons to send my temper over the edge.\u201d</p><p>She grinned. \u201cBut you didn\u2019t belt him one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go applauding me on that. I\u2019m afraid that if I ever touched him, I wouldn\u2019t be able to stop. I\u2019d kill him.\u201d</p><p>She could tell he wanted to change the subject. But she couldn\u2019t help herself. \u201cHow long ago did this happen?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>His jaw tensed for a moment. \u201cDon\u2019t worry\u2014I\u2019m not going over the edge now. Alana died three years ago. I took my time dealing with it. I\u2019m doing okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t worried,\u201d she said honestly.</p><p>He studied her again and seemed to believe her. \u201cGood,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think the food can be all that special if you don\u2019t eat it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m eating, I\u2019m eating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe barbecue is excellent,\u201d he told her. \u201cAnd messy.\u201d He grimaced and licked barbecue sauce from his fingers. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The food was delicious; Logan could handle the fiery hot sauce, while she had to opt for mild. They both concentrated on eating during the next few minutes, and only a few pleasantries and requests were exchanged\u2014Logan\u2019s, \u201cPass the salt, please,\u201d and Kelsey\u2019s \u201cAnother beer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds fine,\u201d Logan agreed. Ricky brought them a second round. By the time they\u2019d finished the food and lingered over their beers, Logan seemed to have his anger under control.</p><p>\u201cWhy did your friend Sandy buy this place?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s coveted the Longhorn for years,\u201d Kelsey said. \u201cShe loves Texas history and grew up here, listening to stories about the Alamo and the Longhorn. She took business and hospitality courses, and managed to pull together the financing when the previous owner was ready to sell it and retire. Sandy worked really hard to get this place. Her folks died close together when we were about nineteen. She got her education, plus money for the down payment, from what they left her.\u201d Kelsey sighed. \u201cShe was devastated when Sierra Monte was killed while she was in the middle of purchasing it. Or, I suppose I should say, disappeared, leaving behind so much blood that she couldn\u2019t possibly have survived. They had to bring in a biohazard cleanup crew, and there were a number of police and legal situations she had to deal with\u2014in the midst of such tragic circumstances. So, with all of that going on, the saloon has really been a labor of love for her.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cDid Sandy know Sierra Monte?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not really. She was in and out of here at the time, and they might have passed each other and exchanged a few words, but they weren\u2019t friends or even acquaintances.\u201d She hesitated a minute. \u201cDo you want to see Room 207?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019d like to see it very much,\u201d he said.</p><p>They both rose. Logan started toward the bar to pay their bill, but Kelsey flagged Ricky down. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. I have a house account,\u201d she told him with a grin. He stiffened slightly.</p> <p>\u201cI pay my way,\u201d he insisted.</p><p>\u201cSo do I,\u201d she said promptly. \u201cYou\u2019re up next time.\u201d They were going to be partners. Paying their own way didn\u2019t mean they couldn\u2019t take turns\u2014not that she\u2019d ever been one to worry about that kind of accounting. She was happy to treat.</p><p>She hurried up the stairs, aware of being watched. When the saloon was in full swing, those not staying at the inn often watched guests mounting the stairs with envy.</p><p>Logan was right behind her.</p><p>As she reached the balcony, she paused.</p><p>She was used to being observed, casually or sometimes, with male appreciation. Actually, the drunker the clientele, the more appreciation she received.</p> <p>But tonight, she felt someone watching her intently. She walked to the carved white wood rail that overlooked the saloon. Some people were eating, and some were still playing poker with their peanut shells. Quite a few were entranced by the music, while others were just interested in their drinks and the conversations they were enjoying at the long bar.</p><p>She surveyed the room below.</p><p>Ricky was out on the floor. He set down a beer, looked up at her, grinned and waved. She realized he\u2019d seen Logan, as well; maybe he assumed they were both getting lucky.</p><p>She flushed and waved back.</p><p>Sandy was on the floor, too, and she waved. So did the cowboy, Corey Simmons.</p><p>She glanced at the slatted, swinging doors to the sidewalk. They were fitted into glass now, to protect the flow of air-conditioning demanded by modern patrons. And, in the glass, she could see a face. The eyes in that face, she knew, were directed at her.</p><p>The face belonged to the reporter. Ted Murphy.</p><p>Let him watch, she thought.</p> <p>She decided not to say anything to Logan. The man was standing outside the saloon, doing nothing illegal. Better not to risk another confrontation. Or another reminder of the past.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Logan asked.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d she said. \u201cI was just thinking that the saloon probably looks just like it did a hundred-and-fifty-plus years ago. Sandy studied old drawings and photographs to get it right, and she had the furniture repaired or replaced with similar period pieces.\u201d Conscious that she was babbling, she dug in her bag for her room key.</p><p>\u201cThe historic societies in this area owe Sandy a big thank-you,\u201d Logan said, pushing open the door after she\u2019d unlocked it.</p><p>Entering the room, he stood still for a moment and slowly looked around. \u201cI wasn\u2019t here at the time the murder\u2014or bloodletting\u2014of Sierra Monte occurred,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd homicide detectives from the police department handled the investigation. None of the bodies that were found are Sierra Monte\u2014we know that from the DNA testing\u2014but it seems more and more likely that she was a victim of the same killer.\u201d</p><p>Kelsey nodded thoughtfully. \u201cYes, she was obviously a stabbing victim like some of the others\u2014like Jenny Doe and Josie Doe. They have that in common. But Jenny and Josie...where were they killed?\u201d</p><p>He angled his head. \u201cEvery murder has to have a crime scene. We simply haven\u2019t found them yet. And there\u2019s another question. Was Sierra Monte killed in this room by sheer coincidence, or is there a reason that two different women living in different centuries were killed here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat could the past have to do with Sierra Monte\u2019s death?\u201d she asked. \u201cThe first murder was really sad\u2014well, all murder is. But the whole story is sad. From the bits of legend I\u2019ve picked up, Rose Langley started life as a sheltered plantation girl. She fell in love with a drifter, who pimped her out as they made their way across the states. And then she was kidnapped by another guy, who eventually murdered her.\u201d She broke off, frowning. \u201cHe wanted something from her,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cHe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer killer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I can\u2019t tell from what I\u2019ve...seen,\u201d Kelsey said.</p><p>\u201cCan you describe what you saw? Where they were? What was happening?\u201d</p><p>Kelsey tried to recall both the waking vision and her dream. The details hadn\u2019t altered from one to the other.</p><p>\u201cWhen the vision starts, they\u2019re both in the room\u2014Rose Langley and Matt Meyer. Rose was really stunning, even after all she\u2019d been through. Slim and shapely, with a pile of dark curls that she\u2019d pinned up, but they came loose and tumbled around her face. She and Matt must have been in the room for a while, fighting. Her dress lay on the floor\u2014over there\u2014and the bed was by the window that looks out onto the street. Rose was still wearing her corset and garters, her stockings...and Matt Meyer was dressed more like a businessman than a Davy Crockett or Daniel Boone type. He must have been considered tall for his day. He was at least your height, but heavier set. Maybe his drinking habit was taking its toll.\u201d</p><p>She flushed, a little embarrassed that she was giving him her opinion when he\u2019d just asked her to describe what she\u2019d seen. But he was listening.</p><p>\u201cThen Matt walks across the room to Rose. She\u2019s standing here,\u201d Kelsey said, striding to the center of the room near him. \u201cHe grabs her by the shoulders. And yells at her. \u2018You won\u2019t hold out on me! I want it, and I want it now.\u2019 That\u2019s what he says to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRose says, \u2018I don\u2019t have it.\u2019 The man\u2019s grip on her tightens and his face twists into a really cruel expression, and he tells her, \u2018You\u2019re a liar! I know what happened in Galveston that night, and I know your pretty-boy lover won it. I want it!\u2019\u201d</p><p>Kelsey swallowed. She\u2019d watched it all before, but she hadn\u2019t stood where Rose Langley had. She felt such sorrow for the woman.</p><p>She turned away from Logan. \u201cI\u2019m trying to remember exactly what they said. And never once did either of them mention what \u2018it\u2019 was.\u201d She thought back and said, \u201cRose told him \u2018No! It\u2019s mine!\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen he killed her?\u201d Logan asked.</p><p>\u201cWithin the next minute or so. He taunted her first. He said, \u2018You think you\u2019ll get back to that no-good weakling? Well, give up that dream. He moved on the moment you were gone.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then...\u201d</p><p>Kelsey closed her eyes, trying to recall what they\u2019d said. She was surprised that the words came so easily to her lips, almost as if she were an actress, playing the part of Rose Langley.</p><p>\u201c\u2018I hate you,\u2019\u201d Rose said. \u201c\u2018I hate you, Matt. I loathe you. You forced me here, and you\u2019ve used me enough. Even if I had it, I\u2019d never let you have it!\u2019\u201d</p><p>She opened her eyes and looked at Logan.</p><p>\u201cMatt Meyer responded with, \u2018You\u2019re an old whore, Rose. I want it, and I\u2019ll get it.\u2019\u201d Kelsey shuddered. \u201cThen Rose said, \u2018I will never give it to you.\u2019\u201d</p><p>She wrapped her arms around herself, imagining the feel of the man\u2019s hands around her neck. Rose had clutched his arms, trying to break his hold. She\u2019d tried to scratch and claw him, but she hadn\u2019t been strong enough.</p><p>He\u2019d wrenched the woman to him, his fingers curled around her neck. He\u2019d squeezed his hands tightly together; he shook her hard. She grabbed desperately at his arms, trying to free herself.</p><p>\u201cShe begged him then. \u2018Please, Matt?\u2019\u201d Kelsey said. \u201cBut his fingers were around her throat, and he told her, \u2018I\u2019ll kill you, and I\u2019ll rip this place to shreds\u2014and find it.\u2019 She was able to whisper \u2018please\u2019 one more time. And then she was dead,\u201d Kelsey finished. \u201cHe picked her up and threw her on the bed as if she meant nothing to him. I hope he never found it.\u201d</p><p>Logan shook his head. \u201cHe never did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, Marshal O\u2019Brien, it\u2019s obvious you\u2019re not a Texan, and not from San Antonio. After hearing your description of the murder, I\u2019m positive that it can only be one thing. And I\u2019m sure a lot of people might have felt it was worth fighting for, killing for\u2014dying for.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWell, what was it?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cThe Galveston diamond.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Six</p> <p>Logan lay in his room, staring at the ceiling fan as it whirred. He\u2019d spent all his time since he\u2019d returned home going through the various files on the victims. The stories he\u2019d heard about the Galveston diamond kept playing through his mind, but so far, all he had was the fact that if Kelsey\u2019s vision was true, Rose Langley had left Galveston with the diamond, and she might have died trying to keep it. Once the ring had disappeared after a poker game in Galveston, it had never been seen again.</p><p>Chelsea Martin had been a part-time gemologist. But he couldn\u2019t find anything relating to gems or gemology regarding Tara Grissom, and, of course, the as-yet-unidentified corpses had given them nothing about their past likes, loves or hobbies.</p><p>He started trying to find everything he could on Sierra Monte. There were plenty of newspaper articles, but he wasn\u2019t looking for background on the investigation. He wanted to know more about the woman herself. He was glad to discover that he could trace the articles and police interviews to some of her friends and find old references on their social networking pages. She\u2019d written one friend about an \u201camazing\u201d citrine she\u2019d found on eBay, and another page had an old reference to a ring she\u2019d bought in New York\u2019s diamond district. \u201cA blue diamond! It\u2019s magnificent\u2014and I could afford it!\u201d Sierra had written.</p><p>Clearly, she\u2019d had an interest in gems and jewelry. Just like Chelsea.</p><p>He tried all the social connections he thought the young women had most likely used. He turned his attention back to Chelsea and Tara and looked through the links, and discovered that both women had\u2014like a high percentage of the country\u2014kept up Facebook pages. The pictures of their past lives made him sad, and the many messages of condolence, addressed to their families and friends, were heartbreaking. He wasn\u2019t sure what he\u2019d discovered; he hoped something would click in his mind at some point.</p> <p>Finally, he\u2019d tried to sleep.</p><p>And, of course, what he\u2019d learned about the young women continued to dance through his head, but then he found himself thinking of his own life and events gone by.</p><p>He thought dully of the time it had taken him to get past the agony of losing Alana. He\u2019d often wondered if it would have hurt any less if she\u2019d died of natural causes. But ultimately, there was no way out of being human. He had met Alana soon after he\u2019d become a Ranger, and she had loved his work and the history of the Rangers\u2014that of the stoic, heroic frontier protectors, and that of the men who\u2019d pictured themselves above the law. Her own father had passed away, but he\u2019d also been a Ranger. The idea of Logan\u2019s changing his line of work to something safer had never come up.</p><p>But then, neither had suspected that she might become a victim of violence.</p><p>Alana had known he loved her. She\u2019d known that he would have given his life in exchange for hers, without question. She had loved him in return. If they\u2019d ever been able to discuss the situation, she would have smoothed back his hair and said, \u201cHey, Ranger. That\u2019s the way the beans fell, and that\u2019s that.\u201d</p><p>Since he\u2019d come back, almost a year ago now, he\u2019d worked on the tangible cases. A bank robbery. A gang war\u2014with homicides. There was one case in which a clever killer had murdered his friend with gloves on, using the friend\u2019s own gun\u2014but he\u2019d forgotten about the way circumstantial evidence could pile up, and he\u2019d wound up confessing, afraid of the death sentence, carried out with frequency in the state of Texas.</p> <p>And then Logan had been told to meet with Jackson Crow.</p><p>Whir, whir, whir, the ceiling fan went.</p><p>Hearing Alana call to him when she was already dead hadn\u2019t been his first experience with the unacknowledged senses. He\u2019d had opportunities as a child to embrace both Apache and Comanche ways\u2014entirely different from each other. To the Comanche, it was natural to see signs and learn lessons from the creatures around them. They weren\u2019t gods; they were energy and strength and power. The Apache saw a different world, in which there\u2019d be an afterlife, and you might meet an enemy there, just as you could on earth. There were ghost riders, because there was a soul, and the soul lived on. Dreams were seen as omens, or as visions that might help a warrior make a decision. The unusual was far more accepted among most Indian nations. Not to mention the fact that the American west offered certain natural flora that occasionally enhanced a dream-walker\u2019s quest. \u201cAll natural,\u201d an Apache friend had told him once. \u201cSo is hemlock,\u201d Logan had said. Yes, the world was filled with the natural\u2014and what some saw as the supernatural. Like all things, there was both good and bad in what was natural\u2014and supernatural.</p><p>Logan\u2019s first supernatural occurrence had fallen on the beneficial side. A young Apache girl had been kidnapped, and it was suspected that her own father had done it. He was known as a cantankerous alcoholic, who\u2019d taken a strap against his sons often enough. There was little love for the man among his people, and it was easy to point the finger in his direction. But while sitting with his grandfather, watching the smoke of a fire, Logan believed he\u2019d seen the girl. She was crying and afraid, and he thought he saw her at an abandoned emu farm outside the Apache reservation. Although he\u2019d been seventeen at the time, and a \u201ctinted white boy,\u201d as some of his relatives called him, he\u2019d been able to convince his father\u2014who had brought in the Texas Rangers. The man who still owned the land had allowed them to investigate. They\u2019d found the girl\u2014with the corpse of another. They caught the pedophile who\u2019d kidnapped the girls and assaulted them and accidentally killed the first.</p><p>Logan had lied, of course. He\u2019d said he\u2019d heard the information about the girl and, riding with his cousins across family land on the outskirts of the city, he\u2019d noticed the buildings on the abandoned farm and put two and two together. That was the day he\u2019d known he was going to be a Texas Ranger.</p><p>He\u2019d learned to focus and had honed his abilities. At times, he\u2019d spoken to his grandfather in the years since he\u2019d died, and to other \u201csouls,\u201d those he\u2019d known and those he hadn\u2019t. He did understand one thing: If a soul had moved on, he would not be able to speak with that person again. He had heard Alana when she\u2019d called out to him, because she hadn\u2019t intended to let her killer get away with her murder. But she was gone now. He\u2019d sat at her grave site often and long; he\u2019d wandered the house with the little picket fence that they\u2019d owned together\u2014now sold\u2014calling out her name. He\u2019d gone to the restaurants they\u2019d frequented, spent hours in the park where he\u2019d proposed, ridden the Texas plains where they\u2019d often taken his cousin\u2019s horses, and no matter how hard he tried, how hard he focused, he couldn\u2019t find her. Not even in his dreams. But when they\u2019d recovered her body, buried in the coffin, the oxygen supply not properly set, he thought he saw her eyes open. He thought she touched his cheek. He had heard her whisper, \u201cGoodbye, my love. Do good.\u201d</p><p>They were the words she\u2019d often said to him when he went off to work.</p><p>He had been convinced she was alive. He\u2019d tried to drag her out of the coffin and into his arms. Insanity had struck him, and he\u2019d beaten back his friends, heedless of injury to them. All he\u2019d seen was that Alana needed help. It had been Tyler Montague, another Ranger, who\u2019d finally taken him by the shoulders and wrestled him down, and it had been the tears in Tyler\u2019s eyes that made him see the truth. Alana was dead, and he was destroying the evidence they would need to see her killer convicted.</p> <p>He\u2019d taken a two-year leave. When he\u2019d come back, he\u2019d refused to deal with anything that smacked of the supernatural.</p><p>And yet here he was. Like it or not, he was sucked in. Last night had been the clincher. He wasn\u2019t sure why. But Kelsey O\u2019Brien\u2019s vision in Room 207 had started the process, and he believed that the murder of Rose Langley had something to do with what was going on now.</p><p>The Galveston diamond. It had never been found. He wondered what it was worth in today\u2019s market. Millions.</p><p>But...what could the deaths of so many women have to do with a diamond that had disappeared more than a hundred and fifty years ago? Especially when they suspected that most of them had been living on the fringes of society, surviving as prostitutes or by doing whatever odd jobs they could get. People who were on their own, who hadn\u2019t even been reported as missing.</p><p>Or so he assumed. They knew about Tara Grissom and Chelsea Martin. And maybe they could uncover something about the others.</p><p>He thought back to the files with the bios and information they had thus far. Chelsea had been a teacher. And part-time gemologist.</p><p>After an unsatisfactory night\u2019s sleep, Logan rose, showered and dressed, then headed out, anxious to get to Jackson Crow\u2019s temporary headquarters.</p><p>He paused as he stepped out his door.</p><p>The birds were back. There were sitting on the eaves of his house; they were arrayed around him on poles and wires, and some even sat on his car.</p><p>They watched him, and he watched them in return.</p><p>They seemed to be exuding no ill will.</p><p>\u201cAh, my friends, are you offering energy and strength? Or are you warning me that what lies ahead should be avoided?\u201d</p><p>The birds did not reply.</p><p>He opened the door to his car, revved the engine and the birds took flight.</p><p>Kelsey had brooded through the night. No other dreams or visions had come to her, but she\u2019d spent hours thinking about Logan Raintree. She realized that what she\u2019d learned disturbed her, and she woke feeling out of sorts.</p><p>Arriving in the kitchen early, she hoped for a little time alone, but that was unlikely. The inn was now full, and Sandy had hired help to prepare breakfast. Kelsey was glad to see that coffee had been brewed, but disappointed that there was nowhere she could be alone to enjoy it. She stood in a corner of the kitchen, trying to keep out of the way.</p><p>\u201cEverything all right?\u201d Sandy asked.</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d Kelsey assured her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou look upset,\u201d Sandy said. Then she grinned. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be. I love your Texas Ranger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not my Texas Ranger,\u201d Kelsey muttered. \u201cWe\u2019re just working together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Well, then, I wouldn\u2019t mind working with your Texas Ranger.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSandy, have you ever met Logan before? Was there information about him in the paper when his wife died?\u201d</p><p>Sandy frowned, and her eyes widened. \u201cOh! Oh, he\u2019s that Texas Ranger! I didn\u2019t make the connection... . I definitely remember the case!\u201d She shivered. \u201cOh, it was horrible. The poor woman died. The killer was playing a time game. Except that he had some kind of oxygen system supposedly rigged up when he buried her alive, but he didn\u2019t do it right. The Ranger\u2014her husband\u2014found her, but she\u2019d been dead for a while, according to the papers. Oh, that\u2019s so sad! But Logan Raintree seems so...well, normal. Considering what he\u2019s been through.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is normal,\u201d Kelsey told her.</p><p>As normal as I am, she thought.</p><p>But her distress about the tragedy in his life\u2014and her anger that she hadn\u2019t been told\u2014continued to bother her.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve got to get going.\u201d Kelsey drained her coffee cup and put it down.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Sandy said. \u201cOh, and, by the way, thank you again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, for dealing with Corey Simmons. He\u2019s a happy camper now, and I was sure he\u2019d leave the inn and tell terrible stories about it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re still okay with the room?\u201d Sandy asked anxiously.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m absolutely fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just remember when we were growing up...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Kelsey arched a brow. She\u2019d never shared any of her impressions or visions with Sandy, even though they were close friends. She\u2019d learned early that it was too easy for people to misunderstand\u2014or to make fun of her.</p><p>\u201cWhen we were kids, at camp, you\u2019d tell great stories about history. And those ghost stories you told by the campfire... You were so good, I always felt as if you knew something the rest of us didn\u2019t\u2014almost as if you had imaginary friends whispering in your ear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was an imaginative kid,\u201d Kelsey said. \u201cListen, I\u2019ve got to get to work. See you this evening\u2014and thank you. It\u2019s great to have a place to stay.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to get involved in a discussion about the Longhorn. She wanted to accost Jackson Crow and find out why he hadn\u2019t told her anything about Logan Raintree.</p><p>Crow was alone when she walked into the dedicated room at the police station.</p><p>\u201cYou had no right to put me in the situation you did,\u201d she said angrily, marching toward him at his desk. \u201cNone.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd what situation was that?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cSetting me up with a man\u2014a potential team member\u2014without any explanation about his past.\u201d</p><p>He leaned back casually, watching her.</p><p>\u201cAnd why does his past matter right now? We\u2019re looking for a murderer, not planning a therapy session.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I see. You\u2019re giving me a \u2018this is business\u2019 speech? Well, I\u2019m sorry, that\u2019s not acceptable under the circumstances. You obviously want us using abilities we don\u2019t usually share. And just as obviously, that\u2019s going to bring us closer than most business associates, team members, whatever we\u2019re going to be!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think Logan Raintree is emotionally crippled? Or that he\u2019s going to go off on some kind of rampage? Shoot up the streets?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, of course not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should have known. That\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLogan\u2019s past is his concern. He chose to tell you about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but...what happened to him wasn\u2019t something like, oh, his house was robbed. His wife was murdered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you knew it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI make a point of knowing everything about anyone I\u2019m asking to join this team,\u201d Jackson told her.</p><p>Frustrated, she scowled at him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s important that you get to know each other on your own terms, not that I outline your lives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cA team only works when every member learns to trust every other member,\u201d Jackson said.</p><p>She would have spoken again, still irritated, but the door opened and Logan Raintree came into the room. He greeted them with a solemn, \u201cGood morning.\u201d</p><p>They both responded. Kelsey felt guilty; she wondered if he could tell she\u2019d been talking about him.</p><p>He probably could. But he didn\u2019t press it. \u201cWe need to get back on the streets. We have to find Vanessa Johnston. I read and reread the files last night. We can\u2019t compare lives and histories on all the victims, since we don\u2019t know who some of them are, but I spent last night looking for a common thread between the two women we do have. So far, all we\u2019ve got is that both were young, attractive, fascinated with the Alamo and headed there. But,\u201d he said, glancing from Jackson to Kelsey and offering them a crooked, almost sheepish smile, \u201cI believe I\u2019ve found a connection between one of them, Chelsea Martin, and Sierra Monte. And it\u2019s something that\u2019s been staring us in the face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Galveston diamond?\u201d Kelsey asked.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cSierra Monte was presumably killed at the Longhorn,\u201d he said. \u201cThe diamond was brought to Galveston by pirates. It was apparently stolen, then disappeared from history after it was won in a poker game in Galveston. Historians agree on that much. The legend that says Rose took it with her is based on conjecture but the diamond\u2019s never been found in Galveston. People with metal detectors have searched the beach for it often enough. I can imagine that someone might\u2019ve thought Sierra Monte was looking for it at the inn, but Chelsea Martin never got there. She made it to the Alamo\u2014her last known location. But in her spare time, she studied gems.\u201d Logan paused. \u201cI went to her Facebook page,\u201d he said. \u201cShe truly loved stones and wanted to work with jewelry. But I\u2019m willing to bet she knew about the Galveston diamond. Sierra Monte was a diamond girl, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you find out anything similar about Tara Grissom?\u201d Jackson asked him.</p><p>\u201cEverything I read reinforced what we\u2019ve already learned\u2014she loved history, especially state history revolving around the Alamo, the massacre at Goliad and the road to independence for Texas. She must have been aware of Rose Langley and the Galveston diamond. Although a lot of it\u2019s legend, the story\u2019s been around in Texas as long as I can remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut these other women... We\u2019re assuming they were runaways or prostitutes because we haven\u2019t been able to match them to any missing-persons cases,\u201d Kelsey said. \u201cHow could they be involved with the Galveston diamond? Do you really think it\u2019s possible that they all died because of a diamond that\u2019s been missing for a century and a half?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s the only connection I\u2019ve found between any of the victims,\u201d Logan said.</p><p>Kelsey sat on the edge of Jackson\u2019s desk and picked up one of the sheets he\u2019d been studying, a synopsis of the medical examiner\u2019s reports.</p><p>\u201cThe Longhorn isn\u2019t far from the Alamo,\u201d she pointed out. \u201cAnd if you\u2019ve studied the Alamo, you probably know about the Longhorn. Most of us learned about Davy Crockett, Lieutenant Colonel Travis and Daniel Boone as school kids, no matter where we grew up, but the sad tale of Rose Langley isn\u2019t as well-known. All the local kids would\u2019ve heard it, of course, and so would anyone with a fixation on the period. But the Longhorn\u2019s been torn apart over the decades. If there was anything hidden there, it would\u2019ve been found by now. And where else would you look? But if the women never even made it to the Longhorn... Anyway, just because someone liked gems and knew Texas history, why would you murder her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need to know more,\u201d Logan said quietly. \u201cMore about all the women.\u201d</p><p>Jackson looked across the desk at Kelsey. \u201cWe\u2019re going to try to do that.\u201d Jackson was thoughtful. \u201cAnd yes, we have to find Vanessa Johnston. Every officer in every agency in the city is searching for her. I\u2019d like to take an hour and go back to the morgue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re testing at the morgue\u2014with Kat as the M.E.?\u201d Logan asked. \u201cWe\u2019re bringing Kat in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and I\u2019m going to bring in our fourth and fifth team members, too. Jane Everett is meeting us at the morgue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe does facial reconstructions,\u201d Logan informed Kelsey. \u201cAnd she\u2019s very good. She can work with all kinds of material, but she\u2019s worked with computer images, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJane\u2019s done assignments for several anthropological societies,\u201d Jackson added, \u201cand also for the Rangers and the police.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy wasn\u2019t she brought in before?\u201d Kelsey asked.</p><p>\u201cEverything costs,\u201d Logan reminded her, looking at Jackson.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re also getting a computer whiz,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cFilm and sound effects, computers\u2014every team needs someone who\u2019s good at those things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I know him or her?\u201d Logan asked.</p><p>\u201cYou both do,\u201d Jackson said.</p><p>Kelsey was startled. \u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSean Cameron.\u201d</p><p>Kelsey almost fell off the desk. \u201cSean Cameron? My cousin, Sean Cameron?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there family rivalry, Marshal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, nothing of the kind. Sean...Sean is great. But he...works on movies. Documentaries\u2014like the one he\u2019s doing now, about the Alamo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s done computer work for us before,\u201d Logan said. \u201cCrime-scene recreations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Sean isn\u2019t a cop.\u201d Kelsey frowned, looking at Jackson.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Logan agreed. \u201cNeither is Jane.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIs it fair to bring them into...whatever this is?\u201d Kelsey asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s up to them. If the team works out, they\u2019ll wind up with training, and you\u2019ll both have to take a few courses, too, for the proper certifications in weapons and such.\u201d</p><p>Kelsey wondered about the documentary. Would Sean still be working on it? He was no slouch. Besides being multitalented, he was what you\u2019d consider a \u201cman\u2019s man.\u201d Football, kickboxing and mixed martial arts were hobbies for him, and he\u2019d turned down a chance to be college all-pro because he loved film and computers more.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s got what we need,\u201d Logan said, looking at her curiously.</p><p>\u201cDoes he know about this?\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve communicated,\u201d Jackson told her.</p><p>\u201cAnd he\u2019s a\u2014\u201d Logan began.</p><p>\u201cTexan,\u201d Kelsey finished for him. Logan raised his eyebrows and smiled at her. He was smiling far more easily. She wished she wasn\u2019t so glad of that.</p> <p>\u201cWhen are they meeting us at the morgue?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cIn twenty minutes. At nine,\u201d Jackson said.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the first order of business?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll start with Kat,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cMost of the bodies are so decomposed that the best medical examiner in the world would have difficulty telling us much more than Gaylord did. But she has the ability to go a step further, especially now, as a member of this team.\u201d</p><p>Logan wasn\u2019t surprised by that, Kelsey realized. Of course, he knew Kat Sokolov because he\u2019d worked with her before.</p><p>\u201cShe...speaks with corpses?\u201d she ventured.</p> <p>Logan turned to her. If he guessed she\u2019d been talking about him earlier and felt angry about it, he didn\u2019t indicate that in any way. \u201cI think Jackson means that she not only has a special ability, but she\u2019s got the money behind her now to do the kind of testing they wouldn\u2019t normally have done for unidentified corpses with apparent causes of death. Doing the appropriate tests, Kat can learn a great deal more. She\u2019ll be able to give us information that could lead us in the right direction.\u201d</p><p>Jackson spoke up. \u201cKat is excellent, and she\u2019ll be dedicated to this case.\u201d</p><p>He looked at them both. \u201cWe\u2019ve already got our first report from her. We didn\u2019t need an exceptionally talented M.E. to find out about the DNA in that finger, but as we all suspected, it was Vanessa Johnston\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe killer seems to be speeding up,\u201d Logan said.</p><p>They were all quiet for a minute. Yes, they\u2019d suspected that the finger had been the missing woman\u2019s. Now they knew it. Yes, any adept technician could have gotten them that information. But Kelsey had the feeling that things were just beginning, that Jackson Crow knew exactly what he was doing, and Kat Sokolov was going to be an important addition to their, as yet, uncertain unit. But although Kelsey hadn\u2019t made a formal decision, and neither had Logan, she felt as if they belonged. As if they were part of the Krewe of Hunters.</p><p>\u201cWe should\u2019ve been able to help her,\u201d she murmured. Tears stung her eyes; she hadn\u2019t known Vanessa Johnston or the others, and she\u2019d mastered some hard lessons in law enforcement, but the human element was always there. So was the hopeless, impotent feeling that came with learning another victim was past saving.</p><p>\u201cWe just figured this out,\u201d Jackson reminded her. \u201cNow it\u2019s up to us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s probably beyond help, but not beyond justice,\u201d Logan said. \u201cLet\u2019s head out. The longer it takes us to discover the truth, the more opportunity there\u2019ll be for this killer to find his next victim.\u201d</p> <p>Kat wore a white lab jacket and her hands were gloved as she worked over the body of Tara Grissom, taking blood and tissue samples.</p><p>Logan watched her, again studying what remained of Tara\u2019s face. He felt anger roiling inside him\u2014a good anger, not a destructive one. It was the kind of anger that made him want to track down the killer. A completely controlled emotion. They needed to be methodical while they worked with all possible haste. He glanced over at Jackson Crow and thought about the power the man had and what they were being offered.</p><p>Certain tests were automatically done on corpses brought in for autopsy. In cases where cause of death seemed clear, some tests usually wouldn\u2019t be done. They were just too expensive, especially when X-rays or physical trauma pointed to the means of death\u2014such as broken hyoid bones or the evidence of stab wounds.</p><p>However, in this case, they desperately needed more clues. That meant more time and money.</p><p>Jackson had the federal funds necessary to pitch in when the local budget was used up. And, Logan knew, if he joined Crow\u2019s unit, he\u2019d have that same backing.</p><p>He saw that Jackson was staring at him, and he wondered if the other man suspected what was going on in his mind.</p><p>\u201cI doubt I\u2019ll be able to find needle marks if the women were injected with any substance,\u201d Kat said apologetically. \u201cIn some of these instances we\u2019re down to almost no soft tissue. We could find metal poisoning in the hair or bones, but...we do have a few victims who may be able to tell us something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGC-MS?\u201d Logan asked.</p><p>She nodded, looking at Jackson. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>To detect many of the possible substances that might\u2019ve been used to subdue the women before they disappeared, GC-MS, or gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy, would be needed. The state of decay meant that no other approach was likely to yield results.</p><p>It seemed logical that the women had been influenced in some way to leave the Alamo\u2014or wherever their location\u2014without putting up any kind of fight or making a scene. They might\u2019ve been persuaded to come and see something or invited to do something. What that something was Logan and the others had no clue\u2014except for the phone call recorded between Chelsea Martin and her friend Nancy. The call was abruptly cut off. Someone had interrupted Chelsea, and she hadn\u2019t been seen or heard from again...until her corpse was discovered. Another possibility, as Kat had mentioned, was some form of sedative.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to do more testing, a lot more testing,\u201d Kat told them. \u201cAs of now, I don\u2019t have much to give you, but I\u2019ll look for drugs, and I\u2019ll study the stomach contents\u2014those tests were done, but not really followed up. I\u2019ll do whatever I can.\u201d She offered them a weak smile. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be nice to have first call on all the lab techs out there, and free rein for any test I need.\u201d</p><p>Logan glanced across the corpse at Kelsey, who was gazing down at Tara\u2019s face. He liked the quiet way she\u2019d stood listening, and the empathy in her eyes. He looked at the corpse himself and wondered whether he\u2019d lost his \u201ctalent\u201d after Alana\u2019s death.</p><p>Had it diminished because he\u2019d refused to make use of it? After all, what good was a \u201ctalent\u201d that had failed him when he\u2019d needed it most?</p><p>But he still had it. He knew he did. Something was eluding him, though. He could reach out, and he could see, but he couldn\u2019t see enough. He\u2019d reached the young woman, but he\u2019d felt blinded.</p><p>He walked over to Kelsey, who started, her attention drawn from the corpse. He took her hand; she scowled at him, taut and resistant, when he urged her toward the corpse.</p><p>\u201cYou need to see,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cJust like you do,\u201d she shot back.</p><p>He bent his head slightly, a bitter smile curving his lips. \u201cBut we\u2019re a team, right? And your eyes might be better on this one. You have to feel the hurt, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t allow him to force her hand onto the putrefying corpse, but she didn\u2019t make a show of fighting him in front of Kat and Jackson, either. She did let him guide her, though, and he felt some emotion rip through her as she touched Tara Grissom\u2019s arm. Her eyes flashed to his in green fury but she didn\u2019t get a chance to speak; the door opened and they were joined by a tall, slim brunette wearing a lab coat and carrying a camera.</p><p>\u201cJane,\u201d Jackson said warmly. \u201cThank you for coming.\u201d</p><p>Logan released Kelsey\u2019s arm.</p><p>But he met her eyes again and shrugged grimly. She\u2019d gotten something, made some kind of connection. And while he was glad to welcome Jane Everett to the investigation, he was also anxious to get back on the streets with Kelsey.</p><p>She had what he\u2019d lost.</p><p>Maybe it was simply the ability to give, and to love. To touch, in a way he no longer could.</p><p>Chapter Seven</p><p>Kelsey tried to greet Jane Everett cordially, with professional courtesy, but she felt as if she were burning inside. Watching as Kat worked with the corpse had become painful. She kept wondering if Vanessa Johnston had been alive when she\u2019d reached Texas, and though she knew the loss of a finger didn\u2019t guarantee death, she also knew they wouldn\u2019t find her alive. And as she\u2019d listened to Katya Sokolov, she\u2019d felt an almost overwhelming sadness for the young woman on the table.</p><p>Touching her had made it worse; it was as though she\u2019d felt her own life ebbing through her fingers as the corpse\u2019s one good eye stared at her. Deep in her mind, she\u2019d heard a silent cry for help.</p><p>Where were you? Kelsey asked. What were you doing? How were you so quickly and easily taken? And why?</p><p>\u201cKelsey O\u2019Brien, Jane Everett,\u201d Jackson said, introducing them.</p><p>They shook gloved hands, and Kelsey tried to smile as Jackson continued. \u201cLogan, Kat, Jane, you three know one another and you\u2019ve worked together, so I\u2019m actually the odd man out here, along with Kelsey, of course.\u201d</p><p>Jane Everett had warm amber eyes and she seemed pleased to meet Kelsey. They didn\u2019t exchange small talk over the corpse; Jane went right to the heart of her expertise. \u201cThis isn\u2019t going to be easy,\u201d she said. \u201cI can do better images when we\u2019re working with skulls,\u201d she told Kat.</p><p>\u201cTara\u2019s face we know.\u201d Kat spoke gently and respectfully of the dead. \u201cOn some of the others, most of the tissue is already lost, so we can take a look and then decide on an approach.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cJane,\u201d Logan said. \u201cI think it\u2019ll help us immensely if we can determine the identities of the other women.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKat and I will start on the images immediately,\u201d Jane assured him. \u201cThen you can distribute the pictures.\u201d She smiled. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen you in while. It\u2019s good to work with you again.\u201d</p><p>Jane liked him, Kelsey thought. At the moment, she didn\u2019t like him very much herself.</p> <p>But Jane had barely entered the room when the door opened again, and her cousin arrived. Sean came in, giving her a broad smile, and it was nice because...so far, she really had been an outsider. She wasn\u2019t Texan. Sean was, but he was blood, as well, and they even bore a family resemblance. She wanted to rush over and throw her arms around him, but the gravity in the morgue forbade it. And the sense that still seemed to vibrate in her fingers, the sense that Tara Grissom was with her, made any other kind of feeling\u2014or interaction\u2014difficult just now.</p><p>Jackson stripped off his gloves and shook hands with Sean, and the others greeted him as an old and esteemed acquaintance. He looked at Kelsey then, sheepish, his eyes trying to meet hers but slipping to the corpse that lay between them.</p><p>\u201cHey, Kels.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Sean.\u201d</p><p>He was tall and lean, with hair that was similar to her own but much darker, and the same green eyes that were dominant in their family. While she stood awkwardly behind the corpse, Sean kept avoiding it and trying to speak to the others, saying he was glad to be working with them again.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure I\u2019m much good in the morgue,\u201d Sean said, addressing Jackson. \u201cAnd I\u2019m still involved with the documentary. But I\u2019ll do my best on searches and video recreations as soon as I have something to work with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKat?\u201d Jane began. \u201cHow soon\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis afternoon,\u201d Kat said instantly. \u201cI\u2019ll get an assistant in here, and we\u2019ll start with the photographs. I\u2019ll see what I can do about getting down to the skulls. If we can come up with a real idea of more of the victims\u2019 faces, Sean can start tonight.\u201d Kat turned to Jackson, Logan and Kelsey. \u201cI\u2019ll do whatever I can in the tests, and get back to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKelsey\u2019s named our victims,\u201d Logan said. \u201cI think we all believe that \u2018Jodie Doe\u2019 might have been the victim of a different killer\u2014she was drowned. This doesn\u2019t mean we don\u2019t need justice for her, too. I\u2019m just mentioning it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, I\u2019ll look for differences, as well,\u201d Kat promised. \u201cI\u2019ll also do anything I can to find out if a common drug, synthetic or natural, was used on any of the women.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone at the office tonight at eight o\u2019clock,\u201d Jackson said.</p> <p>They were dismissed. Kelsey pulled off her gloves and went back to the hallway. Knowing Sean was behind her, she turned around and greeted him with a hug at last. \u201cI was hoping to see you soon,\u201d she told him, \u201cbut this is a surprise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a surprise for me, too,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, not totally. Crow contacted me, but a lot of my time is committed to the documentary that\u2019s being shot. The good thing is, we\u2019ve come back to the city to do some interior shots at Branch Studios. I\u2019m here now, so you\u2019re welcome to stay with me. I figured you wanted to spend some time with Sandy, but if we\u2019re working together...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love to come and stay with you, but right now I think it\u2019s more important to be at the Longhorn.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cWe\u2019re negotiating to shoot there, too.\u201d He grinned wryly. \u201cThe rodeo\u2019s in town, which is good on the one hand, since they can hire some of those guys as extras. But it\u2019s bad in a way, too, because Sandy may not want shooting done on the premises when she has such a great clientele\u2014thanks, of course, to the rodeo. She won\u2019t want us closing off any areas. Then there\u2019s sound, of course. But I\u2019m not producing. I\u2019m just the special-effects guy.\u201d He glanced at his watch. They\u2019d moved down the hall, but Jackson, Logan and Jane Everett had exited the autopsy room, as well. He looked quickly in their direction. \u201cSo, this is why you\u2019re here?\u201d he asked her. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><p>My cousin! My blood, she thought. Sean was here. She felt now that she really had someone she knew, and trusted entirely.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure yet,\u201d she told him. \u201cJackson Crow seems to know what he\u2019s doing. It\u2019s a little scary. But very tempting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s intriguing. Who knew the world had so many strange people in it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not strange,\u201d Kelsey said.</p> <p>\u201cRight. We\u2019re perfectly normal gifted people,\u201d he said dryly. \u201cLet\u2019s face it, Kels, we\u2019re strange. But working where strange is normal might be really nice for a change.\u201d</p><p>She studied Sean\u2019s face. He was a few years her senior; they\u2019d both seen and done some things that could definitely be considered strange. And they\u2019d both learned that you didn\u2019t talk about any of these things to others.</p><p>She nodded. \u201cWe\u2019ll see, won\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe will,\u201d he agreed.</p><p>\u201cSean, you know the history and legends here, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBorn and raised in San Antonio,\u201d he reminded her. \u201cAny questions you have, I can answer later, okay?\u201d</p><p>The rest of the group was coming toward them, and he backed away from her slightly. \u201cGoing to my day job.\u201d He raised his voice. \u201cI\u2019ll see you all tonight. And if anyone has anything for me...\u201d</p><p>He waved and headed off.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go, shall we?\u201d Logan said to her.</p><p>She didn\u2019t ask where they were going. Kelsey knew he was anxious to search for Vanessa Johnston.</p><p>She still felt a simmering anger against him over forcing her to touch Tara\u2019s corpse\u2014forcing her hand in more ways than one\u2014but she nodded.</p><p>They left the morgue together.</p><p>Kelsey could still smell the mixture of chemicals that seemed to permeate the autopsy room, even as they walked into the sunlight.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t a smell you ever forgot.</p><p>They returned to the Alamo, and sat on the bench not far from the entrance to the old chapel.</p><p>\u201cThis seems highly useful.\u201d He could hear the sarcasm in her voice. They\u2019d been on the bench for nearly half an hour and nothing had happened.</p><p>\u201cThis is where the crow dropped the finger,\u201d Logan said patiently.</p><p>She was cool and aloof; she\u2019d been angry since they\u2019d left the morgue.</p><p>He turned to her. \u201cLook, we\u2019re here because we can sit on this bench and possibly...hopefully, make some discoveries.\u201d</p><p>Her green eyes blazed. \u201cYes, we know we can do things differently. But, Raintree, we\u2019re supposed to use our gifts as we see fit to use them. I don\u2019t force you to do anything, and you don\u2019t force me.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI tried. I touched Tara, and because of that, I know she was taken in darkness. You\u2019re better than I am. You might have discovered more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not better! You...made contact.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo did you,\u201d he said, turning away. \u201cAnd, hey, if you don\u2019t want to use what you have, you should just go home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should go home?\u201d she responded furiously. \u201cIf you can\u2019t move beyond the past, there\u2019s no sense in working on this. And if you\u2019re supposed to be some kind of team captain, well, there\u2019s been a mistake.\u201d</p><p>He wanted to answer her sharply, but he tensed and found himself inhaling.</p><p>She was right. She was so right. He had to learn to find the truth again.</p><p>He exhaled. \u201cTeam. That means we all use what we have,\u201d he said. He turned back to her. \u201cDid you get anything more?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cTara Grissom can\u2019t help us because she was taken in the dark, and she doesn\u2019t know who killed her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe can still help us,\u201d Logan said.</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have to find out more about her. Learn about her friends and acquaintances. Who knew she was coming here? Did she meet with anyone once she arrived? We need to discover the little personal things. I thought\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou thought you could force me when I wasn\u2019t ready,\u201d Kelsey said.</p><p>He smiled crookedly. \u201cAre we ever really ready?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you ready yet?\u201d</p><p>Was he?</p><p>Looking past Kelsey, he saw Zachary Chase hovering a few feet away.</p><p>\u201cZachary,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>Kelsey whirled around. Logan supposed that, if any visitors were watching, they\u2019d think the two of them were staring at an imaginary friend.</p><p>Kelsey didn\u2019t stand. She didn\u2019t act as if she was about to shake hands with the air. She smiled, though, and said in a soft voice, \u201cMr. Chase! I\u2019ve been hoping to meet you.\u201d</p><p>Thus encouraged, the ghost of Zachary Chase came forward.</p><p>Kelsey made way for him to sit on the bench between them.</p><p>Zachary was in buckskin, the outfit he\u2019d probably worn most of his life. His face was weathered and taut, but he was still capable of a shy grin as he looked at Kelsey. And, with him between them, they could converse as if Kelsey was talking to Logan, which would certainly create the appearance of a normal conversation.</p><p>\u201cHow do you do, miss,\u201d Zachary said appreciatively as he greeted Kelsey. \u201cIt\u2019s a pleasure to meet you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou, too, Zachary.\u201d Kelsey nodded at him.</p><p>\u201cThis is Kelsey O\u2019Brien,\u201d Logan said. \u201cShe\u2019s a U.S. Marshal. We\u2019re both desperate for help, Zachary. Someone is stealing or seducing away women from this area, or so we believe\u2014and killing them.\u201d</p><p>Zachary frowned. \u201cI had worried,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cZachary, you didn\u2019t say anything to me,\u201d Logan chastised him.</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t been around much,\u201d Zachary said. \u201cWhen you were, it was as if you hadn\u2019t noticed me. And I didn\u2019t know the women were dying.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCan you tell us what you\u2019ve seen?\u201d Logan asked.</p><p>Zachary sighed, glancing toward the chapel, and Logan had to wonder just what the man was seeing. He knew the Alamo as they couldn\u2019t, as the best scholar couldn\u2019t, as the most historically accurate filmmaker could never quite portray it.</p><p>\u201cThere was one rather plump, pretty girl. And she saw me. She saw me, the way you see me. I watched the man following her. I was trying to tell her. To warn her. Then he approached her, and touched her, and I couldn\u2019t hear what he said. She gave a startled look, and she seemed to fall toward him. I thought perhaps he\u2019d given her bad news. They left together,\u201d Zachary said.</p> <p>\u201cYou mean...she sank against him? But she was still conscious? Moving on her own?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom what I saw, yes.\u201d He pointed toward the street. \u201cIt was busy that day. I thought that if she was afraid or in trouble, she would cry out. But she didn\u2019t. She went with him. It was as if she knew him, and yet, when he was following her, I didn\u2019t think she did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you describe him? What did he look like? Who was he?\u201d Kelsey asked anxiously.</p><p>\u201cHe was Davy Crockett.\u201d</p><p>Logan saw the surprise register on Kelsey\u2019s face.</p> <p>\u201cPardon me?\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cZachary, I\u2019ve never seen the ghost of Davy Crockett at the Alamo,\u201d Logan began. \u201cYou\u2019ve told me before that you sit here and think about him, but you\u2019ve never seen him, either. I don\u2019t believe the ghost of Davy Crockett, if he was here, would be out to hurt people.\u201d</p><p>Zachary shook his grizzled head. \u201cNot the real Davy Crockett,\u201d he said impatiently. \u201cThis man seemed to be one of the actors they bring in when they\u2019re doing reenactments. Lord knows, I\u2019ve watched enough of those through the years!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, someone dressed up as Davy Crockett?\u201d Kelsey asked.</p><p>\u201cSomeone trying to dress up like Davy,\u201d Zachary said. \u201cBut he was ridiculous, this man. Oh, his clothing wasn\u2019t bad. Had on buckskin and fringe, rather like my own trousers and jacket. Had on a cotton shirt in a plaid pattern. What looked so bad was his face. Fakest whiskers I\u2019ve ever seen, and bad wig. Worse hat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink, Zachary,\u201d Kelsey urged. \u201cHad you ever seen the man before?\u201d</p> <p>Zachary shrugged. \u201cDon\u2019t rightly know. I mean, there\u2019s so many of those actors who come and go, and around here, on Halloween, there are Davy Crocketts everywhere. When I did see him, I was barely aware of him at first. I thought a school group was coming. Then I noticed that he was following the young woman, and I tried to warn her. I think she even saw me, and she was laughing. She supposed I was playing with her. I tried to get her to follow me into the chapel. There were people there. Living, breathing people. I just felt he was...odd. Then he went up to her and I couldn\u2019t get close enough to hear what he was saying. She sagged against him, like I told you, and they went away. I didn\u2019t think much more about it. I\u2019ve seen a lot here over the years. Many people pass through this place. Sometimes they\u2019re smiling, sometimes they\u2019re serious. Sometimes they leave together, and sometimes they leave alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you seen the man since?\u201d Logan asked him.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t think I have,\u201d Zachary said. \u201cHard to say, though. You get all kinds around here. The historical society is usually in on it, but you occasionally get folks who think they\u2019d like to be heroes, too, and they dress up and come here. Every once in a while, you get the unemployed actor with a hat out for donations. But did I see this particular fellow again? I don\u2019t rightly know.\u201d He shook his head again and looked at Kelsey sorrowfully. \u201cI didn\u2019t know women were being killed. And I\u2019d planned to talk to Logan the other day and find out if there was anything I needed to worry about, but he brushed me off. Rude, you know what I mean?\u201d Zachary asked.</p><p>Kelsey actually smiled as she looked past him at Logan. \u201cIncredibly rude,\u201d she agreed.</p><p>\u201cZachary, you know damned well that you enjoy making me look like a fool who talks to himself,\u201d Logan said. \u201cWe waited for you,\u201d he added. \u201cThe other day.\u201d</p><p>Zachary shrugged. \u201cSometimes I like to walk around where the walls once stood,\u201d he said. \u201cSometimes I like to walk on, heading in the direction I did the day I left to get help.\u201d He turned to Kelsey and said sadly, \u201cMen might be willing to die. Don\u2019t mean they want to die.\u201d</p><p>Kelsey started to reach for him, but her hand ended up on Logan\u2019s thigh, and she yanked it back.</p><p>\u201cZachary, I\u2019m so sorry about all your friends here,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cIt was a long time ago. I don\u2019t know why I stay. Can\u2019t help them now. I just keep thinking... . The provisional government was a mess. Who knows? More men might\u2019ve come, and more might\u2019ve died. And I didn\u2019t get to see everything, but I did speak to some of the women afterward. Santa Anna, he was a bastard, executing people right and left. But he didn\u2019t kill the women or the kids.\u201d</p><p>Kelsey murmured sympathetically.</p><p>\u201cI could never help them,\u201d Zachary said.</p><p>\u201cBut you can help us. You can help us now,\u201d Logan told him.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I do?\u201d Zachary asked. \u201cYou say women are being killed. I only saw what I did that one day, and even then... So what can I do now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can watch for us, Zachary. You can watch what goes on. I\u2019ll stop by every day. Tell me if you see this man again or anyone who might have been this man,\u201d Logan said.</p><p>\u201cI can do that. Yes, I can do that.\u201d Zachary nodded vigorously. He stared at the chapel entrance again. Tourists were flocking around; docents and interpreters were on duty. The sun was shining, and the sky was blue, and it was a beautiful day in Texas.</p><p>Zachary spoke directly to Kelsey. \u201cDavy Crockett died in the fighting, you know. That\u2019s what they told me. Travis, he was killed right away. Some say Davy was taken and executed, but I talked to Susanna Dickinson after the battle\u2014she was the wife of my friend Almaron Dickinson\u2014and she said there was a commotion, the women and children were hiding, but she heard that Davy went down fighting. Santa Anna sent her and Joe\u2014Travis\u2019s slave\u2014on to Gonzalez to warn the folks they\u2019d all be dead if they kept fighting. And can you imagine? Santa Anna offered to adopt her little girl! This was after her husband was killed. Good for Susanna\u2014she didn\u2019t give an inch.\u201d</p><p>Logan let Zachary talk, although he\u2019d heard his stories many times before.</p><p>They needed Zachary now. He could be a witness\u2014the camera and the recording no one could find.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d Kelsey was telling Zachary.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cSo long ago, now. So long ago.\u201d He suddenly turned to Logan. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on with the birds?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Frowning, Logan gave his attention to his surroundings.</p><p>The birds were back.</p><p>There were scores of them, and different varieties. Crows, of course. Black birds by the dozens, alighting here and there and everywhere around them. On cars, poles, wires, the eaves of the old chapel. And there were sparrows, pigeons, seagulls and more.</p><p>As he looked, an arrow of flapping wings passed overhead and soared toward the south.</p><p>He stood, saying, \u201cZachary, please keep watch for us. Tell me about anything you see, whether you think it\u2019s important or not.\u201d</p><p>Zachary was on his feet, as well, and Kelsey rose at his side, studying the birds. She frowned, then said to Zachary, \u201cThank you so much. I\u2019m so glad to know you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy pleasure to serve you, beautiful lady.\u201d Zachary made a slight bow.</p><p>Logan regarded her for a moment himself. Kelsey was just that, a \u201cbeautiful lady.\u201d He believed she could be tough, and he was sure she knew how to use her weapon, and that she was effective in law enforcement. But there was a ladylike quality about her, in her movements, her manner of speech, the empathy in her emerald eyes.</p><p>And yes, she was beautiful.</p><p>\u201cWe have to go,\u201d he said.</p><p>Her level gaze reminded him that they\u2019d searched before and found nothing.</p><p>But she nodded; they had to keep trying.</p><p>They returned to Logan\u2019s car. \u201cThe birds were flying south,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWe already went south, but we could have missed something.\u201d She stared out the window intently while Logan drove as slowly as he could.</p><p>\u201cAre we looking for an actor?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cIt could be an actor,\u201d he said. \u201cOr someone who knows there are always actors and would-be actors around. It\u2019s easy\u2014strange as that sounds\u2014to dress up in buckskin and look like you belong at the Alamo. I wish Zachary could\u2019ve just said, yes, he saw the man\u2014he was tall and light-haired or short and swarthy, blue-eyed, green-eyed, businesslike, a bum... . But all we know is someone\u2019s using history.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUsing history to find history,\u201d she murmured. She turned to face him, her focus now on their quest, the anger gone from her voice. \u201cI wonder if Zachary knew Rose Langley. The saloon would\u2019ve been frequented by men who were at the Alamo\u2014not when the siege happened, of course, but when they first came. There was a community here. And some of them must have known Rose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll talk to him again,\u201d Logan said. \u201cWe\u2019ll talk to him every day until we learn the truth. Keep your eye on the street, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been here before,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t look hard enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m keeping an eye out for trash piles, dumps, old construction heaps,\u201d Kelsey said. \u201cFresh gardens, old gardens...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think this guy likes hiding his victims in plain sight, if that makes sense. He wants them to rot, and then be discovered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he wants them discovered,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cOddly enough, I think he does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop!\u201d Kelsey shouted.</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnywhere around here.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He saw a space between a massive GMC truck and a Mini Cooper. He moved his car smoothly in and turned off the ignition.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you see?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe birds.\u201d</p> <p>He looked. They were across from a large wooden fence.</p><p>Black birds were perched on top of the fence.</p><p>On it were written the words Danger. Keep Out. Fourscore Construction.</p><p>He left the car and started toward it, aware that Kelsey was close behind.</p><p>There were chains where the wood ended and an aluminum gate had been erected. The fence itself had a jagged top\u2014fine for birds, but not great for people.</p> <p>Logan pulled out his Colt.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Kelsey snapped. \u201cThis is private property!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re feds now, or acting as feds, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am a fed. It\u2019s still private property.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hear a distress cry. Don\u2019t you?\u201d he demanded, squinting at her.</p><p>As if on cue, one of the birds let out a raw scream.</p> <p>\u201cWell...\u201d Kelsey shrugged. \u201cWe could just call someone from the company.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat takes time,\u201d Logan objected.</p><p>The bird gave another loud screech.</p><p>\u201cHey, I hear a cry,\u201d Logan said next. \u201cIt might be nothing, but...\u201d</p><p>He shot the chain that was keeping them out, then pushed the gate open and entered the construction site.</p><p>Kelsey said something under her breath and followed.</p><p>The site was large, but no one seemed to be working that day. An old building had apparently been torn down to make way for a new one. Old foundations stood, surrounded by cheap wire and warning signs. Plywood covered some of the gaping holes in the ground.</p><p>Logan gestured toward the south. \u201cStart over there. I\u2019ll take the north corner.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, sir,\u201d she muttered, marching off in the direction he\u2019d told her.</p><p>Logan went to the opposite corner. Here and there, sections of a wall had been built; he could see naked brick as he lifted the first plywood sheet. Below it he saw nothing but what would one day be a part of a basement.</p><p>He looked across at Kelsey. She\u2019d lifted a sheet, too, and then let it fall. She was standing very still.</p><p>\u201cLogan,\u201d she called softly.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d he called back.</p><p>\u201cThe birds.\u201d</p><p>That was when he noticed them. They hovered over a section that would have been an entry, he imagined, or, perhaps a corner of the basement.</p><p>He heard sirens\u2014someone had alerted the local police to gunfire.</p><p>They had to hurry.</p><p>He nodded, and they both skirted the other holes and went over to the area where the birds had been.</p><p>Facing each other, they raised the sheet of plywood.</p><p>Logan looked down expectantly but saw nothing except a hole in the ground littered with construction debris.</p><p>Kelsey hurried around to his side. \u201cSlide me down there, Logan!\u201d</p><p>She crouched close to the ground, heedless of her clothing\u2014her tailored pants and jacket, her crisp white shirt. He caught her arms, guiding her, holding her tightly until she dangled just a few feet from the bottom.</p><p>Their eyes met, and in that moment, he thought, We are a team. We understand each other.</p><p>She dropped the rest of the way and righted herself. He twisted around, sliding into the hole himself and then falling.</p><p>Old broken boards were everywhere. So were plywood shavings and sawdust, with the occasional coffee or soda cup and fast-food wrappers.</p><p>He began to raise boards and sift through trash, and then Kelsey cried out.</p><p>He turned.</p><p>There, protruding from the ground, was an arm, the hand dangling.</p><p>And the hand was missing a finger.</p><p>Chapter Eight</p><p>\u201cFentanyl,\u201d Kat Sokolov said when they were back at the office.</p><p>Kelsey tried to recall what she knew about the drug. It was legally used as a painkiller and had improved the quality of life for many a cancer patient.</p><p>Not surprisingly, unscrupulous people were now selling it for use on the streets. Like all good things, it had been corrupted.</p><p>She waited for Kat to continue. Kelsey\u2019s mind seemed as exhausted and dazed as her body. It had been a long day. Logan had managed to keep the local cops at bay while contacting Jackson and getting Kat down to the construction site so the body could be recovered without losing any evidence that might exist. They\u2019d spent hours in the April sun, working the scene along with local forensics and keeping the \u201cteam\u201d in the lead. Jane Everett had come to photograph every minute of the procedure, and she, Logan and Jackson Crow had kept watch to ensure that nothing that could provide a clue\u2014a fiber, a fingerprint, a hair\u2014was overlooked.</p><p>And once Vanessa Johnston had been removed from the ground, she\u2019d been rushed in for autopsy while local investigators had set out to question every member of the construction team, from the contractor to the delivery boys. Kelsey had to admit that, like Logan, she didn\u2019t believe they\u2019d get much help from that direction. The site had been closed down for several weeks due to lack of funds. Vanessa Johnston had only been missing for about a week. Still, there was the fact that the lock on the gate was new and there was no other point of entry, unless one scaled the wooden walls with their arrow-tipped tops. It was extremely unlikely that anyone could have crawled over the fence, especially carrying a corpse or a drugged or unwilling woman. That mystery was solved when Logan began walking the perimeter and discovered that two of the side-by-side slats were no longer embedded in the earth. They slid easily enough when pushed to create an entrance allowing passage for a man, even a man bearing a burden as large as a human body.</p><p>The neighborhood was canvassed, although no one had heard anything, and only one woman complained about noise at the site.</p><p>\u201cBirds!\u201d she\u2019d told the officer. \u201cBirds shrieking and cawing at all hours of the night. I called in to complain twice.\u201d</p><p>And she had; the construction site was on a list for the cops to check out.</p><p>The physical evidence at the site could take weeks to examine, even with all of Jackson Crow\u2019s power and contacts. There were hundreds of wooden boards, there was dirt, bricks, refuse, and many other surfaces to be tested.</p><p>Vanessa Johnston\u2019s body had not decayed to the same extent as the other bodies. Kat was optimistic that she\u2019d be able to learn a great deal more about time and method of death than she could with the earlier victims.</p><p>Kelsey thought about Vanessa\u2019s family and friends, those who had feared for her and would now learn the worst... .</p><p>Everyone seemed as exhausted as she was. Jane had done what she could to establish images of the deceased; Kat, too, had worked without a break. Sean came later, having spent the day on the documentary. He\u2019d plunged in without pausing for a meal.</p><p>Now they sat, the six of them, in the office, their chairs gathered in a circle, sharing the events of the day and discussing what they\u2019d found out, with Sean listening.</p><p>\u201cFentanyl,\u201d Kat repeated. She looked at Logan and Kelsey. \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ve come across it. Fentanyl is a synthetic narcotic analgesic, and it\u2019s a hundred times more potent than morphine. For chronic pain, it\u2019s often delivered to patients through a patch. It\u2019s also combined with other drugs for surgery. Like I said, fentanyl\u2019s hit the streets, and God knows how many overdoses there\u2019ve been because of it. It\u2019s sometimes mixed with Rohypnol\u2014commonly known as a roofie\u2014and I\u2019m assuming that we\u2019ve missed the combination because of the deterioration of the previous bodies and because we needed to use GC-MS testing. But that\u2019s how the killer is grabbing these women. I think he\u2019s mixing up a dose and getting close enough to prick them with some sort of needle or slap on a patch. I\u2019m not positive of his method because I haven\u2019t been able to find a needle mark or evidence of a patch on any of the women, although I\u2019ll continue searching on Vanessa Johnston tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe drug is that potent?\u201d Kelsey asked. \u201cIn my experience, roofies usually go into drinks, and I\u2019ve worked cases where the women don\u2019t remember a thing that happened to them for hours afterward. In one rape, the woman didn\u2019t believe she\u2019d ever been with the man, and he was only caught because the police found video.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, a roofie is a date-rape drug,\u201d Kat said. \u201cMemory can be completely lost. But this is a mixture. The fentanyl is knocking the person out\u2014right after the killer gets her to come with him willingly. Why? I have no idea. As far as I can tell, the women aren\u2019t being attacked sexually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI figured he had to have a method for getting so many women to disappear with him. If he was causing any kind of scene, someone would\u2019ve noticed something by now and reported it,\u201d Logan said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll start on a grid, although I don\u2019t suppose we know where Vanessa was last seen?\u201d Sean asked.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s begin by putting all the women somewhere near the Alamo,\u201d Logan suggested. \u201cAnd then indicate where the bodies were found. Let\u2019s include Sierra Monte in the investigation, so we\u2019ll need the Longhorn in the grid, as well. We know she was taken from there.\u201d</p><p>Kelsey glanced over at Logan. He seemed increasingly convinced that Sierra Monte\u2019s death was connected with the others. He also wondered if\u2014and how\u2014the Galveston diamond might be involved.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have preliminary sketches of the other women for you tomorrow, and we\u2019ve decided it\u2019ll be necessary to remove the remaining flesh and soft tissue on several of the skulls. In a few of the other cases, that\u2019s what we\u2019re down to, anyway,\u201d Jane said. \u201cI can provide images that will be almost real,\u201d she added. \u201cThere are even formulas you can use to come up with the most likely hair and eye color.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat will help,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cWe need to identify the other women ASAP.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Kat agreed. \u201cAnd we have the best people in crime-scene forensics working on the site. Logan has seen to that. He knows the local technicians and scientists and labs. The place itself is a mess, but there\u2019s got to be some bit of evidence.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Logan cleared his throat. \u201cThis killer understands how to corrupt evidence. Somewhere along the line, however, he\u2019s going to leave something behind, something that doesn\u2019t become tainted. A skin cell, strand of hair, whatever. But even when we\u2019ve got that, we\u2019ll need someone with whom to compare our samples. I think we should start looking at anyone who might be into costuming. We should investigate actors, interpreters, would-be actors and even historians,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need suspects.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy actors?\u201d Sean asked.</p><p>\u201cWe found a witness who says he saw Chelsea Martin with someone dressed like Davy Crockett,\u201d Kelsey said.</p> <p>\u201cCan we all speak with him?\u201d Kat asked.</p><p>Kelsey glanced quickly at Logan, still a little uncomfortable about blurting out such strange information, even in this group.</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d Logan shrugged. \u201cHis name is Zachary Chase and he hangs out at the Alamo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cZachary Chase?\u201d Sean frowned. \u201cThat\u2019s the name of one of the couriers who rode out of the Alamo just before the final battle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA descendant?\u201d Sean asked.</p><p>\u201cNo. Zachary himself,\u201d Logan said with a rueful smile. \u201cHe\u2019s a ghost. But he\u2019s still at the Alamo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Sean exhaled. \u201cWell, I\u2019m working on a documentary about the Alamo. I can give you all kinds of information\u2014and dozens of actors.\u201d</p><p>Logan\u2019s house was fascinating. It had the feel of a hunting lodge; it was built of stone and wood, and a large stone fireplace was the focal point of the sprawling living room, with an extraordinarily fine headdress on the wall over the mantel\u2014an Apache war bonnet from the 1870s, Logan told her.</p><p>He was casual about the house. He\u2019d only owned it a year, and he\u2019d bought it when he\u2019d sold his last house because the backyard was almost an acre, unusual in central San Antonio.</p><p>Besides having a number of authentic Apache and Comanche relics, he had a nice collection of art and seemed to be a fan of Mort Kunstler\u2019s Civil War pieces. \u201cMost of them are prints,\u201d he explained. \u201cThe originals are pretty pricy, but I have a friend on Apache land who is a fan, too, and frames them so expertly they look like they could be originals.\u201d</p> <p>He\u2019d just brought out two bottles of Lone Star beer and set them on coasters on the coffee table that stood in front of the soft leather sofa. He took a seat next to her, and for a moment she wondered why he\u2019d asked her to come\u2014and then wondered why she\u2019d said yes.</p><p>She smiled and he looked back at her and laughed.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re an odd pair,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cTrue, and yet a pair,\u201d she murmured, gazing at the fire. She found it pleasant to sit there and watch the flames. The day had been warm while the sun was out, but the evening was cool, with a definite chill in the air.</p><p>He leaned back, propping his feet on the coffee table. \u201cTomorrow, the documentary.\u201d He looked over at her again. \u201cThanks to Sean\u2014and the fact that you\u2019re his cousin\u2014we\u2019ll have nice, natural access.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll find out tonight if they\u2019ve negotiated space with the Longhorn,\u201d she said.</p><p>He was studying her and smiling. \u201cYou look like Sean. I don\u2019t know why I didn\u2019t see it before.\u201d</p><p>Kelsey laughed. \u201cGreat. I look like a linebacker.\u201d</p> <p>He lowered his head for a minute, the same smile on his lips. \u201cYou know you don\u2019t. You always make sure you look professional\u2014and not like a runway model.\u201d</p><p>She felt a flush touch her cheeks. \u201cSean and I have similar features, I suppose. Grandpa Cameron. He had the red hair and green eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSean and I have been acquainted for a while,\u201d Logan said. \u201cHe\u2019s come in to work on digital recreations several times, and they\u2019ve been really helpful in court.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never realized he did that,\u201d Kelsey said. \u201cI guess it\u2019s because we\u2019re far away, and rarely see each other, even though we\u2019re close.\u201d</p><p>She sank back against the sofa. Sitting there felt good, as if the warmth of the fire was slipping into her bones, easing away the tension that had built up during the day. By the time they left the police station, she\u2019d figured the kitchen at the Longhorn might have closed, and she\u2019d thrown out a comment about heading back to dig through the fridge. Then Logan had said he had chili he only needed to heat up, and she\u2019d found herself agreeing, even though Sean had assured her that he could find someplace to take them for a meal.</p><p>So now the chili was heating. She\u2019d entered Logan\u2019s domain and she was glad of it. She was weary, and it felt all right to be weary with him, her defenses down. She\u2019d been furious with him earlier, but the more they worked together the more she understood that he could be relentless in pursuit, especially when he was frustrated. Yet he knew the law\u2014and how to work around it when necessary.</p><p>After she\u2019d agreed to come home with him, she\u2019d panicked, afraid she\u2019d be going to a shrine\u2014the house he had shared with Alana.</p><p>But he had sold that house and changed his residence, and despite the guilt and bitterness he carried like a brick around his neck, he was trying to move into a new life.</p><p>\u201cI would\u2019ve thought you\u2019d have a dog,\u201d she told him, taking a long swallow of her beer. She glanced at him and grinned. \u201cLike a pit bull or maybe a wolf.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had a wolf mix once. Loved her. She was a great watchdog, and yet incredibly affectionate. She died a few years ago. I\u2019ve also had a little mutt about so high.\u201d He raised his hand a foot from the floor. \u201cLately...well, one day I\u2019ll get another dog. I like dogs. I just want to know I\u2019m going to be a good dog owner again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love to have a dog,\u201d Kelsey said. \u201cBut I feel the same. My training was hard, proving myself was hard\u2014I didn\u2019t want to get a dog and ignore it. I\u2019d like some big old mutt. Just a big lovable hound that wants to be loved and petted when I come home, and that I could take to a park or...well, we don\u2019t even know if this whole team will work, or if it does, where we\u2019ll be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I took you for the Yorkie-poo type,\u201d Logan said.</p><p>\u201cOh, really!\u201d she said, laughing, because he was obviously teasing her.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have your experience,\u201d she said a few minutes later. \u201cIn law enforcement or in life. But I\u2019m good at what I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019re good at everything you do,\u201d he told her. He\u2019d spoken the words casually, but his voice had a rasp that they both heard, and it seemed to turn the words into a double entendre that she knew he hadn\u2019t intended. He stood with a wry grin of apology. \u201cChili should be hot by now, and I\u2019m starving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too.\u201d</p><p>She rose to join him. In the kitchen, while he took the chili from the stove, he instructed her to grab the instant rice from the microwave, which she did. Then she chopped tomatoes while he washed and broke up a head of lettuce. They sat at the kitchen table and said very little for a while, except when Kelsey took the time between mouthfuls to compliment him on his chili.</p><p>\u201cAh, well, Rangers come from a long tradition of survival in the wild,\u201d he reminded her. \u201cStephen Austin brought the first three hundred legal American colonists into Spanish Texas after his father died, soon after receiving an empresarial grant to colonize. They were known as the Old Three Hundred, and they were on dangerous frontier ground, so he created an informal group for protection\u2014the Rangers. Poor Austin had barely gotten started when Mexico gained its independence from Spain and the land grant was rescinded. There was trouble ahead for sure. So, the original Rangers were out there...ranging. Watching for outlaws, Indian attacks and bad men, protecting Austin and the colonists. They had to learn to forage.\u201d He grinned. \u201cAny self-respecting Ranger has to know how to cook.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I wouldn\u2019t want you to be anything less than self-respecting,\u201d Kelsey said with mock seriousness.</p><p>\u201cWhat about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can cook,\u201d she assured him. \u201cAt least, I\u2019m great with a microwave.\u201d</p><p>He laughed softly, but set his fork down, having finished his meal. \u201cHow did you know which plywood cover to pick up today?\u201d he asked unexpectedly.</p><p>She grimaced. \u201cI wish I could say I\u2019d heard something, that Vanessa Johnston was reaching out of the ground for me.\u201d She raised one hand in a dismissive gesture. \u201cOkay, I wish I could say that, but only to you. I noticed the birds. Is that crazy, or what?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cStrange, when I was meeting Jackson Crow\u2014and you\u2014I had an incident with a bird. There were birds everywhere. Although I\u2019m not a superstitious man and I\u2019ve learned a lot of different beliefs, I thought it might be an omen at first, or a warning. Now...maybe it\u2019s just because they\u2019re drawn to carrion, but the birds seem to be helping us out. I don\u2019t know... . Crazy or not, it was a bird that dropped Vanessa\u2019s finger in front of us, telling us she was out there to be found.\u201d</p><p>Kelsey didn\u2019t speak for a minute.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking?\u201d he asked her quietly.</p><p>She was surprised by the tone of his voice. She looked across at him and studied his face. It was such an attractive face\u2014strong, with good bones, piercing eyes, the bronze texture of his skin. She liked everything about his appearance. But attractive men were numerous; with Logan, she realized, there was more. Even when he irritated or angered her, there was something about him that compelled her.</p><p>Dangerous, she told herself.</p><p>But she knew he was attracted to her, too, even if it was just physical. In their few days together, they\u2019d formed a strange kind of bond.</p><p>Yes, there are times when we can both communicate with the dead. We\u2019ve touched a corpse, and felt the voice of her soul calling out.</p><p>And we share a ghost at the Alamo now, a man who died more than a hundred years ago.</p><p>Logan was looking at her. She hadn\u2019t answered his question. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhen we heard about Vanessa, I thought maybe we were brought together to save a life. Justice for the dead is so important, but I suppose I wanted to believe we were coming together to protect and save the living.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cWe still may,\u201d he said. \u201cWe haven\u2019t caught this killer yet. He may have other victims in his sights\u2014he probably does\u2014and we\u2019re on it now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t even have any suspects,\u201d she murmured.</p> <p>\u201cTrust me, we will.\u201d</p><p>He sounded confident. Kelsey watched him, knowing he wouldn\u2019t stop\u2014whether their team was formed or not, whether he became a fed or stayed with the Rangers or worked freelance\u2014until he found the man who had committed these crimes.</p><p>\u201cI believe you,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>She would never know whether it was the simple words they exchanged, or something about that evening or the way they looked at each other. She would never even know if she\u2019d moved to kiss him first or if he\u2019d moved to kiss her. It hadn\u2019t been a romantic night. There were no roses or candles, no movie with dinner or a walk on the beach... .</p><p>But maybe it wasn\u2019t romance. Maybe it was more basic than that\u2014the straightforward urgency of need.</p> <p>Somehow they were suddenly locked in an embrace, a sweet touch that seemed to burn through limbs, that answered longing. He knew how to kiss, not with force but with confidence, and the feel of his mouth covering hers was an unbearable aphrodisiac. She parted her lips to his, hungry to explore everything about him, and before she realized how it had happened, they were both standing, tearing at each other\u2019s clothes. Their guns and holsters were the first to go. It wasn\u2019t until then\u2014when she recognized what she was actually going to do\u2014that she became conscious of the dirt and grime of the day. Some semblance of shyness tried to invade the hunger that surged through her with such insistence, almost as if she\u2019d been without water for days, and she had to drink or die.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m filthy,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cI do have a shower,\u201d he said.</p><p>He hopped along, tugging at his boots as they headed from the kitchen down the hall to the shower. Her own pumps were kicked aside and he groped for the water while she struggled out of her suit trousers. Hot steam filled the bathroom. She caught sight of them both in the misting mirror just before it completely fogged. She thought there was something oddly right about the way they looked together. He was dark and she was pale, and her hair was streaming down over his fingers and they were close, so close.</p><p>\u201cBirth control?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cTaken care of,\u201d she said.</p> <p>He dragged her into the shower, pulling the curtain around them, and the spray of the water seemed to enhance the feel of his lips, his tongue within her mouth, the touch of his hands upon her.</p><p>For a moment, as they were locked in a kiss with the water showering over them, she felt a panic rise within her.</p><p>He was still in love with his wife.</p><p>She was a substitute for a dead woman.</p><p>She wanted to cry out. She wanted to look into his eyes, deny nothing, but insist that he call her by name, acknowledge the fact that he was with her. It was all she wanted. No declarations of love or even caring, just the acknowledgment that she was Kelsey O\u2019Brien, she was flesh and blood and she was here with him now.</p><p>But she said nothing. She felt the searing fire of the water again, or the fire that was inside him, the liquid heat of his lips on hers, and she let the thought slip by because she wanted to be where she was. She felt his hands on her breasts and between her thighs and the hot, slick feel of his dark hair as he bent against her, mouth and tongue over one breast and then the other. She clung to him, her fingers sliding against his back and digging into his buttocks. She would\u2019ve said just moments before that she hated showers, that she was tall, that the shower was slippery, that it was far from her fantasy of making love. But he was strong and powerful, and she wasn\u2019t afraid\u2014and it didn\u2019t seem at all bizarre that they hardly played in the water before he lifted her easily and she slid down onto him as if they\u2019d rehearsed it all as a dance. She felt the tile behind her, and his movements against her and inside her, and she was aware of only the running water, the force of her own movements and his. Finding his mouth again as they thrust and writhed, feeling the explosiveness inside her, that was sweeter than she\u2019d imagined possible... .</p><p>She climaxed with a shattering sensation she\u2019d never experienced before. She\u2019d been with other men, of course\u2014in particular one Key West cop she\u2019d thought she loved until their relationship ended a few months ago. But the intensity of these emotions, these sensations, was new to her. She felt Logan shudder as he finished, and then he held her close, still inside her, and she felt again the surge of water. She didn\u2019t know what to say or do so she said something ridiculous, whispering in his ear.</p><p>\u201cWe might have gone for some soap, as well, you know.\u201d</p> <p>He chuckled, easing her down, making sure she didn\u2019t slip.</p><p>\u201cI have soap,\u201d he said, and reached for it.</p><p>It might have been awkward; they might have stared at each other, naked in a shower, and realized what they\u2019d done.</p><p>She could have spoken then... .</p><p>But she still didn\u2019t. He took the soap, and spun her around, caressing her with it. And she stood, feeling the water, feeling his touch, and it was so good and sweet again that she didn\u2019t dare think, didn\u2019t dare breathe. Until the friction she felt began to grow into something else, and she turned toward him, seizing the soap, and touching him slowly in return. She savored the feel of his flesh beneath the suds, and teased his body as he had teased hers, watching the movement of her hands against him, savoring the rise of his erection to her erotic touch\u2014and wondering how such incredible passion and intensity could have escaped her all her life.</p><p>He kissed her while hot water sluiced the soap from them both. Then he lifted her into his arms and fumbled to turn off the taps. He carried her, dripping from the shower, down the hall. They stumbled onto his bed in the dark, and he began to kiss her again, taking his time. She tore at his shoulders and hair, and pulled him to her, then crawled over him, lying against him as she made her way down the length of his body, squirming and arching as she returned every last kiss. He took her in his arms and brought her to him, and as they made love that time, they twisted and turned, each atop and each below, panting and gasping and whispering incomprehensible words of pleasure until, once again, it seemed that the ground beneath them trembled and the heavens above exploded.</p><p>Kelsey lay against him, gasping for breath, hearing the pounding of her heart and his. Slowly, slowly, she began to notice the damp sheets. As she felt her heart calm, she realized she was still entwined with him. They both lay there in a silence so long she thought he was asleep, and she tried to ease herself from the sprawl of their limbs.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t live here,\u201d she said. \u201cI have to get back to the Longhorn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you don\u2019t live there, either,\u201d he told her.</p><p>She was ridiculously happy that he wanted her to stay the night.</p><p>\u201cIf Sandy knows I never came back, she might worry, and she\u2019s got enough on her plate right now,\u201d Kelsey said.</p><p>\u201cYou could call her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could, but it\u2019s more than that. I\u2019m not sure why\u2014maybe because of you\u2014but I feel it\u2019s important that I stay in Room 207,\u201d Kelsey said. \u201cI really have to go,\u201d she added. \u201cThank you for a really wonderful night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, think nothing of it, Marshal O\u2019Brien. Thank you for a wonderful night.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d used her name. Well, he\u2019d called her Marshal O\u2019Brien, and only when it was over, but that still pleased her.</p><p>\u201cHave to collect all my clothing,\u201d she said, and rose.</p><p>He followed her after a moment, dressed in nothing except jeans, and she thought he looked as attractive as ever, but younger somehow. He helped her, finding one of her lost pumps, then headed to the bedroom door, searching for his car keys.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you should leave, but if you feel you need to, c\u2019mon, I\u2019ll get you there safe and sound.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d she said lightly.</p><p>He was silent as they drove through the streets.</p><p>\u201cActually, you don\u2019t live that far from the Longhorn,\u201d she said apologetically. \u201cYou didn\u2019t have to come out. I like walking at night.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a great idea for you to go running back across the Alamo in the dark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a U.S. Marshal,\u201d she said, as if he needed reminding. \u201cI can fire my weapon, and I got excellent marks at the range, you know.\u201d</p><p>She saw that he was serious, although his eyes were intent on the road as he drove. \u201cI don\u2019t doubt that. But I don\u2019t like what\u2019s going on. Each of these women was obviously taken by surprise. That can happen to anyone\u2014any man or woman. I don\u2019t like to think about you, or anyone, really, taking chances until we understand what we\u2019re up against.\u201d</p><p>She looked ahead. \u201cWell, then, thanks for the ride.\u201d</p><p>He pulled up in front of the Longhorn. It wasn\u2019t rowdy inside, but there were still lights on and people lingering at the bar.</p><p>Kelsey got out of the car quickly. \u201cI\u2019ll be careful,\u201d she promised. \u201cI\u2019ll go right up the stairs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll swing by for you in the morning, to get to the studio,\u201d he said.</p><p>She felt the greatest urge just to get back in the car. He was still shirtless in his jeans, and for the first time she wanted to forget that she was supposed to be focused elsewhere, that she was working on a truly horrible case. She wanted to forget she was strong and independent and following the course she\u2019d chosen.</p><p>He was so damp and sleek and tempting... .</p><p>She managed to smile, and realized she was laughing at herself.</p><p>\u201cThanks. I\u2019ll be ready.\u201d</p><p>She hurried into the Longhorn. She tried not to pay attention to the stragglers as she dashed up the stairs. When she reached the balcony, she paused. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She hadn\u2019t been thinking about people watching her, and yet she\u2019d felt that same strange sensation along her spine, that intense stare following her all the way up.</p><p>She walked to the rail and looked over. She could see nothing but the tops of a dozen ten-gallon hats.</p><p>Turning away, she opened her door, prepared for bed and crawled in.</p> <p>She started dreaming right away.</p><p>But she didn\u2019t dream of days gone past. She dreamed of a darkened room, and the man who waited for her there, and she dreamed that he spoke her name.</p><p>Chapter Nine</p><p>For the first time, Logan felt the extreme emptiness of his house when he returned to it.</p><p>The fire had died down low. Silence surrounded him.</p> <p>He\u2019d wanted her to stay. He couldn\u2019t remember when he\u2019d wanted to spend the whole night with a woman and wake up beside her.</p><p>\u201cI really should get a dog, shouldn\u2019t I?\u201d he said.</p><p>Of course, no one answered.</p><p>He walked into the kitchen and began picking up the remnants of their dinner. As he rinsed the dishes and put them in the dishwasher, he thought of the way Kelsey had looked when she was in his kitchen and the way she\u2019d looked in the shower, and then in his bed.</p><p>He groaned as he walked back into his bedroom. The sheets were still damp. The faint, ethereal scent of her cologne or soap or maybe just the woman herself seemed to hover in the air, and it was going to make sleep difficult.</p><p>He wanted to feel guilty. He hadn\u2019t merely had sex. He\u2019d had great sex.</p> <p>More than that\u2014he\u2019d cared.</p><p>That was why he should feel guilty.</p><p>But he didn\u2019t feel the corrosive pain he usually did. He tried to analyze himself. He knew Alana had loved him. She\u2019d really loved him, the way he\u2019d loved her.</p><p>And she would honestly want him to be happy. That was a revelation, although it shouldn\u2019t have been.</p><p>Ah, but what was happy?</p><p>He told himself that right now, happy would be discovering that he was being effectual in stopping the murders that had occurred beneath his nose.</p><p>But as he lay there, he was oddly at peace.</p><p>\u201cI will get you, you bastard,\u201d he said aloud.</p> <p>And he would, or die trying.</p><p>But he found that he could close his eyes, and that sleep would come, and that he could allow it. Because he would start again in the morning.</p><p>Hours later he woke suddenly, and he did so with extreme dread.</p><p>Kelsey.</p><p>Her name pounded in his head. He bolted up.</p><p>Kelsey didn\u2019t know what time it was. She didn\u2019t know what she\u2019d heard, but she was wide awake.</p><p>There was...something. A sound that had wakened her from a deep sleep.</p><p>She opened her eyes in the darkness but made no sudden move. She\u2019d left her Glock on the bedside table where she could grab it in an instant.</p><p>When she did make her move, it was swift. She sat up and reached for the gun, staring into the darkness.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m armed, and I\u2019ll shoot,\u201d she said, and she meant it.</p><p>But her only answer was the ticking of the old-fashioned alarm clock. She leaned over and switched on her light. Shadows seemed to slide back into the walls.</p><p>There was no one there. She rose, always careful about the placement of her back, and walked quietly to the bathroom. The shower curtain was closed; she wrenched it open with her left hand. No one there, either.</p><p>Perplexed, she headed back into the room. It wasn\u2019t so large that she couldn\u2019t see every corner of it. Nothing stirred. She listened to the hum of the air conditioner, and wondered if it had kicked on, awakening her.</p><p>She knelt down and peered under the bed. Not even a dust bunny.</p><p>At last, she walked to the door. It was locked.</p><p>Perplexed, she went back to the bed. As she did, the phone rang.</p><p>\u201cO\u2019Brien,\u201d she said, looking at the clock.</p><p>\u201cKelsey?\u201d Logan. He sounded anxious.</p><p>\u201cLogan. Hey. Do you know what time it is?\u201d</p><p>He ignored her slight sarcasm. \u201cSix. Are you all right? Has anything happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are you?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cMy room. 207.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEntirely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure you\u2019re alone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I\u2019ve just been around the room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStay there. I\u2019m on my way.\u201d</p><p>Ten minutes later, there was a knock and she heard Logan\u2019s voice again. She opened the door. He was dressed, but his hair was askew over his forehead.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>He came into the room. As she had previously done, he made a visual sweep of it.</p><p>\u201cLogan, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d she persisted.</p><p>He paused, looking at her in confusion. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he finally said. \u201cWere you dreaming...or having a vision again? Did you see the past? Matt Meyer strangling Rose Langley or...something more contemporary?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. She wondered if she should tell him that she\u2019d awakened, certain that someone had been there, that she hadn\u2019t been alone. But he seemed so worried about her that she answered carefully.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m all right. I woke up just before you called, but I searched the room and...well, I was the only one here. But I wish I\u2019d see more in this room,\u201d she told him.</p><p>He relaxed. She smiled. \u201cYou need a hairbrush. Use mine. It\u2019s on the dressing table.\u201d</p><p>Sheepishly, he smoothed back his hair, then walked over to borrow her brush.</p><p>\u201cThank you\u2014for being worried about me,\u201d she said, as he shaped his hair into its customary neatness.</p><p>\u201cHey, what\u2019s a partner to do?\u201d he asked. \u201cI guess I\u2019ll let you sleep for another hour or get ready. Or whatever.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t have a chance to leave. There was another pounding at Kelsey\u2019s door, followed by Sandy\u2019s anxious voice.</p><p>\u201cKelsey?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged and hurried to the door. Sandy was staring at her with similar concern.</p><p>\u201cDid anything happen? Are you okay? Oh, Lord! Maybe I should never have bought this place!\u201d Sandy saw Logan, but she obviously wasn\u2019t surprised. \u201cRicky opened the door when he heard Ranger Raintree knocking... . I was so afraid something had happened in here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m fine. Logan just wants to make an earlier start than we\u2019d originally intended,\u201d Kelsey said.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Sandy let out a sigh of relief. \u201cRicky came in early this morning\u2014he was going to help me with the garbage disposal, but I\u2019d already fixed it.\u201d She grinned engagingly. \u201cYou learn a lot about simple electrical work and Band-Aid types of repairs when you own a place like this. Actually, I didn\u2019t learn that stuff when I was doing my hotel and hospitality degree, go figure, but my dad being an electrician sure helped a lot. Anyway, to make a long story short, coffee is brewed and Ricky\u2019s got food going, too!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019d be great.\u201d Logan turned to Kelsey. \u201cWhenever you\u2019re ready,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYou two have time for breakfast, don\u2019t you?\u201d Sandy asked.</p><p>\u201cOf course we do. Thanks,\u201d Logan replied, smiling. Sandy flushed. She liked Logan, apparently.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be down as fast as I can,\u201d Kelsey promised. \u201cLogan, why don\u2019t you go ahead?\u201d</p><p>When she entered the kitchen, he and Sandy were seated at the table. Ricky and several other employees were working around them, cooking and gathering up plates for the guests who were filtering down.</p><p>Sandy looked up, almost as if she felt guilty about something, when Kelsey walked into the room.</p><p>\u201cCoffee,\u201d Ricky said, handing her a cup as he hurried by. \u201cI\u2019ll bet you need it.\u201d</p><p>She thanked him briefly and sat down at the table, noticing that Sandy had the local paper.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to like this,\u201d Sandy warned.</p><p>The headline read Body of Vanessa Johnston Found. Where Are Rangers of Yore?</p><p>The byline belonged to Ted Murphy.</p><p>She glanced at Logan, but he seemed much calmer regarding Murphy than he\u2019d been a couple of days earlier.</p><p>\u201cWhat a help the little prick is to law enforcement,\u201d Kelsey said, shaking her head as she read the article.</p><p>Murphy hadn\u2019t written anything that wasn\u2019t factual. But he also knew that the FBI was involved, that she\u2019d been brought in from Florida and that a special \u201ctask force\u201d\u2014including law enforcement officers who\u2019d had some \u201cinteresting\u201d experiences\u2014was on the scene. He\u2019d researched the small amount of information available on Jackson Crow and his unit, the Krewe of Hunters, and suggested San Antonio should bring in a tea-leaf reader, a medium or maybe a voodoo priestess.</p><p>\u201cYep, he\u2019s a little prick,\u201d Logan agreed.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s so sad, and so scary!\u201d Sandy said.</p><p>\u201cWe just have to do our best to keep details from the man,\u201d Logan said, dismissing the paper. \u201cRicky made cheese blintzes today,\u201d he told Kelsey. \u201cThey\u2019re excellent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds good,\u201d she said.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t really even hungry. She couldn\u2019t believe that Logan was accepting the newspaper article so coolly. She hoped the article\u2014which really couldn\u2019t be missed if you saw the paper\u2014wasn\u2019t going to hamper their investigation.</p><p>\u201cYes, you have to have some blintzes,\u201d Sandy said, starting to rise, but Ricky was already there with a plate for Kelsey.</p><p>\u201cSit, eat, relax, both of you. We\u2019ve got it covered,\u201d he told Kelsey, then Sandy.</p><p>\u201cThank you!\u201d Sandy breathed, with Kelsey echoing the words.</p><p>Sandy waved a hand in the air. \u201cHe\u2019s such a sweetheart. Like he says, he\u2019s got me covered. He\u2019s worried about me because we\u2019re trying so hard to accommodate everyone, and I\u2019m going insane. I\u2019ve agreed that the host of that documentary can come in here and do a few minutes at the bar. It\u2019ll be a mess because we have so many people staying here, and I\u2019m telling everyone that they don\u2019t have upstairs access\u2014except for the fire escapes\u2014from one-thirty to three-thirty this afternoon. I\u2019ll set up a bar in here, but it\u2019s disruptive. I don\u2019t know how I let them talk me into this. Oh, wait\u2014\u201d she rolled her eyes \u201c\u2014yes, I do. They offered me big bucks. Of course, if I really piss off my guests, and they cream me on all the travel sites, it won\u2019t be worth very much.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThe people staying here seem to be nice,\u201d Kelsey said.</p><p>Sandy placed a hand on hers. \u201cHere I am, going on about a trivial problem while you...\u201d Her voice trailed off, as she gestured at the paper. \u201cWhile you\u2019re dealing with a real problem. Do you think the Sierra Monte case might actually be related?\u201d</p><p>Kelsey winced inwardly. Sandy was such a good person and she worked so hard, Kelsey hated to dismiss her by saying they weren\u2019t supposed to talk about their cases.</p> <p>Logan saved her from answering. \u201cWho knows at this point? And it\u2019s only recently that anyone has thought this might be a serial killer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Sandy murmured, looking from one to the other. She suddenly seemed to remember her own dilemma for the day. \u201cKelsey, I should\u2019ve said this earlier. If you\u2019re going to need anything from your room\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Sandy, I won\u2019t interrupt the filming.\u201d</p><p>Sandy brightened. \u201cIf by any chance you guys have some spare time this afternoon, you\u2019re more than welcome to watch. I\u2019ve been told I can be there\u2014nice of them, huh? I tried to tell them I could arrange far better circumstances if they\u2019d wait until after the rodeo. But, with their budget, they have to wrap things up. I did suggest they might\u2019ve asked me earlier, but it seems their narrator or whatever you call him came in for a beer the other night and fell in love with the place. He told the documentary people they had to do a location shoot here, not film the Longhorn scene at the studio. So... Well, it\u2019s just for today. And bless Ricky and my other help! Like I said, we\u2019ll keep a bar going in here, as well. Thank God they put in a big kitchen! And drinks will be on the house for our guests tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLooks like you\u2019ve got everything worked out, Sandy,\u201d Kelsey said.</p> <p>\u201cAnd maybe we can get back here to watch the filming,\u201d Logan added. \u201cNow eat up those blintzes, Kelsey. We need to go soon.\u201d</p><p>She did. Logan encouraged Sandy to talk, and she explained how she\u2019d admired the Longhorn and how she\u2019d wanted it since she was young. Nothing Kelsey hadn\u2019t already told him, but Sandy was clearly enjoying the conversation. \u201cWho knew what would happen right before I was finally able to buy it?\u201d She winced. \u201cOuch. That sounds terrible. Of course, I\u2019m so sorry about that young woman. Sierra Monte.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there anything you can tell me about her?\u201d Logan asked.</p><p>\u201cI wish I could,\u201d Sandy replied. \u201cI just saw her a few times when I came by, measuring, getting ideas. We exchanged comments like \u2018how are you\u2019 and \u2018nice to see you\u2019 and \u2018beautiful day,\u2019\u201d Sandy said. \u201cShe always seemed very pleasant, and she loved the inn, too. She knew the story about Room 207, but she said she liked staying there, and that it was the main reason she\u2019d come to the Longhorn. She was especially interested in poor Rose Langley. I\u2019ve always been entranced by that legend myself. My grandfather told me the story when I was a little girl\u2014I mean that\u2019s what got me so excited about this place from the get-go. But now...my heart aches for Sierra. She became part of the legend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, she did, didn\u2019t she?\u201d Logan looked at Kelsey\u2019s half-eaten food and seemed to know that she was just pushing it around her plate.</p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d he asked her.</p> <p>\u201cYes, I am.\u201d She stood. \u201cThanks, Sandy. Ricky!\u201d she called. \u201cThank you! Blintzes were great!\u201d</p><p>He smiled in acknowledgment, busy preparing.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be back for the filming, if we can swing it,\u201d Logan said.</p><p>They headed out to Logan\u2019s car. \u201cIf the filming\u2019s going to take place in the saloon, maybe we should wait,\u201d she suggested. \u201cWe want to check out the actors, but it might be difficult to do that here\u2014and we don\u2019t want Ted Murphy to catch us at it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe can\u2019t be everywhere. I\u2019m willing to bet he\u2019ll be bugging whatever public information officers he can find today. He\u2019ll probably try to wheedle something else out of someone at the morgue, as well. I would like to see the filming, but I think we\u2019ll have a better chance of observing the actors if we go to the studio.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs you wish, oh, faithful leader,\u201d Kelsey said lightly.</p><p>She\u2019d been worried that she\u2019d feel awkward about the previous night, or that he\u2019d act uncomfortable or reserved, but it was almost as if it had never happened. Maybe it hadn\u2019t been anything\u2014in his mind at least. She decided that she\u2019d act low-key and easygoing, concentrating instead on the horror and mystery before them.</p><p>The studio was some distance from the inn. Kelsey sat back for the drive, glad that Logan knew where he was going.</p> <p>They arrived and found that their names were on a list. The gatekeeper let them through, and when they\u2019d parked a receptionist called Sean to come out and get them.</p><p>\u201cThis building rents out space to a lot of producers and productions,\u201d he said, welcoming them. \u201cToday, we\u2019re doing the room in the Alamo where Jim Bowie was on his sickbed and where it\u2019s presumed he died.\u201d</p><p>They followed Sean down a hallway as he told them, \u201cAlan Knight, the executive producer, isn\u2019t on set, but you\u2019ll meet Bernie Firestone, the director. He\u2019s a down-to-earth guy and really great at documentaries. I like working with him. He tells me what he wants in the way of the special effects, I tell him if it\u2019ll work and we go from there.\u201d</p><p>They came to a door that warned no one was to enter if the red light was on\u2014it wasn\u2019t. A green light blazed, and Sean opened the door and ushered them in.</p><p>It was much more casual\u2014and much busier\u2014than Kelsey had expected. The director, Bernie Firestone, was with the cameraman, checking angles as the first camera zoomed in on the scene being depicted. Kelsey could see how the sets were constructed, and she watched a makeup woman adjusting the mustache on one of Santa Anna\u2019s men, who would soon burst in on Jim Bowie.</p><p>Bernie Firestone seemed happy enough to meet them, and while the preparations continued, he stood back and explained. \u201cThere are so many versions of Bowie\u2019s death. He was dying and in rough shape\u2014that we know. Some people say he cursed the Mexican officers who came in so violently and he did it in such eloquent Spanish that Santa Anna ordered his tongue cut out and that he be thrown, alive, on the funeral pyre. Others say he killed himself. I just don\u2019t believe Bowie would do that. We offer all the different stories in our narration, but in the scene, we\u2019re going with the most widely accepted. The officers burst in on him, he propped himself up against the wall and he shot at them until he was shot and bayoneted to death.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cOf course, he died with his famous knife at his side\u2014we have to believe that!\u201d</p><p>Kelsey watched as quiet was called and all the support personnel moved away. Firestone calmly announced, \u201cAction!\u201d and filming began. The narration would be edited in. The actors played out the scene, ad-libbing for greater spontaneity, Bernie had told them.</p><p>Bowie\u2014or the actor portraying him\u2014leaned heavily against the wall. The bed was in a corner, at an angle. There were guns in his hands, his knife in his belt. The door flew open and Mexican officers filed in. Bowie started to fire. One of Santa Anna\u2019s men clutched his shoulder, and another cried out in pain, clasping his knee and falling to the ground. The men attacked Bowie with their bayonets, and he clutched his knife, raising it high over his head as they slammed their bayonets into him. It was painful to watch.</p><p>But when \u201cCut!\u201d was cried by Firestone, the actor playing Bowie sat up. He was dripping in fake blood, but he seemed pleased. \u201cBernie, how was that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfect, Brant. We\u2019ll break and set it up again for a backup shot,\u201d Bernie said. He looked over at Sean. \u201cYou\u2019ll be able to edit out Henry Garcia, won\u2019t you? I want the blasting guns as the men burst in. You can do that, right? But Henry tripped on the doorframe. I thought the whole set was going to fall in for a minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s the take you want, Bernie, no problem. That\u2019s easy stuff,\u201d Sean assured him.</p><p>\u201cOkay, guys, grab some coffee, and then get back here and we\u2019ll do a second take,\u201d Bernie called.</p><p>The actors left the set, milling around a table laden with coffee and pastries. Bowie came over, still covered in his stage blood.</p><p>Sean escorted Kelsey and Logan to the table to join the performers. There were seven of them, including James Bowie, who was really Brant Blackwood, a local actor. He was polite and apologetic as he met them in his spattered clothing. \u201cKelsey O\u2019Brien, Sean\u2019s cousin. A pleasure. You look like him except that you\u2019re pretty. Oh, hell, Sean\u2019s pretty, too, but he hates when you tell him that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlackwood, you\u2019re an old goat,\u201d Sean said. Obviously, he liked the older man, and the feeling was mutual.</p><p>\u201cHey, I know you,\u201d Blackwood told Logan. \u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry. I mean, you were on the news,\u201d he finished awkwardly. \u201cAnyway, glad you\u2019re back in law enforcement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Logan said, shaking his hand. \u201cNice to meet a star.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, I\u2019m not the star in this,\u201d Blackwood muttered. \u201cThat\u2019s Jeff Chasson. He\u2019s the narrator. We get all mucked up and dirty. Chasson puts on a buckskin outfit, gets his hair done nice and walks in front of a few locations to explain what the scene\u2019s been about. I\u2019ve been proud to play Bowie, though. He must\u2019ve been a tough old dude.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you seem to be doing him justice,\u201d Logan said.</p><p>Sean went on to introduce them to Santa Anna\u2019s men\u2014the clumsy Henry Garcia, Ned Bixby, Arnie Rodriguez, Liam Swenson, Donald Chou, Victor Lyle and Doug Bracken. They were very affable, and for a few minutes they talked about the documentary. All of them seemed to feel a part of it, and to get on well together. They were a mixture of nationalities, Kelsey learned, with Henry Garcia being the only one who thought he was \u201cmostly pure Mexican.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDo any of you ever dress up at the Alamo?\u201d Logan asked.</p><p>\u201cSometimes, when they have reenactments,\u201d Henry said. \u201cLike in March, when the anniversary rolls around. But it\u2019s a shrine, you know\u2014a national shrine. They\u2019re careful about filming there, and they don\u2019t like bums getting dressed up to con tourists out of money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t done one of those reenactments, but I\u2019d like to,\u201d Victor Lyle said regretfully.</p><p>None of these men seemed to be a mass murderer. Least of all, the guy playing Bowie...</p> <p>When the break was over, and everyone was recalled to the set, Logan whispered to Kelsey, \u201cI\u2019m going to keep the director busy. Grab up the paper cups. Oh, and mark them with each man\u2019s name.\u201d</p><p>She frowned at him. Collect them without being noticed? Maybe. Mark them?</p><p>But Logan was good. He and Sean managed to get the cameramen and Firestone paying attention to them, with their backs toward Kelsey. The actors were milling around the stage; the makeup and prop people were in the dressing rooms. She quickly dug a marker from her purse and wrote initials on the cups, praying she wasn\u2019t making any mistakes.</p><p>Firestone turned around once. She smiled and took a big bite of pastry, then had to swallow down the mouthful of guava and cheese.</p><p>She joined them a few minutes later, the paper coffee cups in plastic bags inside her large purse.</p> <p>They stayed to watch as the scene was filmed one more time. Afterward, they heard Firestone complain about the position Jeff Chasson had put him in, with regard to the Longhorn Saloon.</p><p>\u201cWe were just going to film it here\u2014in fact, the sets were ready to go. But Chasson is convinced he\u2019s not only the expert, he\u2019s the star. When I told him we were sticking to the schedule, he went over my head. To the important people,\u201d Firestone said. He grinned ruefully at Kelsey. \u201cThat would be the money people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJeff Chasson,\u201d Kelsey murmured. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I\u2019ve heard of him before.\u201d</p><p>Firestone irritably waved a hand in the air. \u201cHe\u2019s written a few books on the history of Texas, the South, the Civil War. And he\u2019s been interviewed in some of the big documentaries.\u201d He paused. \u201cThis is a labor of love for a lot of us. We\u2019re trying to tell the story that keeps our heroes heroes without romanticizing them. The producer wanted Jeff Chasson, and he wanted to be part of it. Don\u2019t kid yourself\u2014a director can be fired by the producer. My power is limited.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSandy, who owns the Longhorn, is a good friend of mine,\u201d Kelsey told him. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be there and watch for a bit, if we may.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour friend did us a tremendous favor, despite Mr. Chasson\u2019s interference.\u201d Firestone smiled. \u201cYou\u2019re more than welcome.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSandy was happy about the income,\u201d Kelsey said. \u201cHer upkeep is high.\u201d</p><p>They spoke a while longer, then Sean walked them out. \u201cThere are other people who can do what I do here,\u201d he muttered. \u201cBut when I suggested to Jackson that I quit, he asked if I\u2019d stay on and work with you all at night. But he also said to talk to you, Logan.\u201d</p><p>Logan stepped back for a moment. Kelsey sensed that he was startled by Sean\u2019s words. \u201cI think it\u2019ll be good if we can keep our connection to the film, and that\u2019s you, Sean. Stay with it, okay? I hope the hours don\u2019t wear on you too badly.\u201d</p><p>She loved Sean, and she knew he worked hard. He\u2019d worked at a special-effects studio in L.A., a job he\u2019d loved, for many years. He\u2019d come home because his high school flame had been dying. Although they hadn\u2019t made it as a couple, they\u2019d never stopped being close. He\u2019d always called Billie Jo Riley the true love of his life. He\u2019d stuck with her until the end, and then, maybe a little broken, he\u2019d stayed on in Texas. He wasn\u2019t married and he didn\u2019t have kids\u2014and he still worked ridiculous hours.</p><p>Sean shook his head. \u201cNo, I\u2019m in.\u201d</p><p>He gave Kelsey a hug. \u201cHey, remember, if you want out of the Longhorn, kid, just holler.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSean, you cannot call a U.S. Marshal kid, even if she\u2019s your cousin,\u201d Kelsey chastised, smiling. \u201cBut I need to stay at the saloon. It\u2019s another connection we have.\u201d</p><p>She and Logan left the studio and returned to the station and their dedicated room. Jackson was there alone. \u201cPoorly collected evidence, but we have these if we need them,\u201d Logan said as Kelsey took the coffee cups from her handbag. \u201cThey were intended for the garbage, and would have been in the garbage.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTechnically, would have been is not the same as actually being there,\u201d Jackson pointed out.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t use it in court, but if they help us find a killer, then we\u2019ll look for a way to make our case,\u201d Logan said.</p><p>Jackson nodded.</p><p>Logan checked his watch. \u201cWe\u2019re going over to the Longhorn,\u201d he said. \u201cYou never know what we might learn. So far, we don\u2019t have a shred of evidence\u2014or, I should say, we have a mountain of it that means nothing.\u201d</p><p>They went back to the Longhorn, coming in through the kitchen. Ricky was there, along with a few of the guests who seemed happy enough to be sitting around, enjoying the free alcohol.</p><p>Corey Simmons was among them. He greeted them warmly. \u201cHey! This worked out just great for me. I met the director, and he said he liked my look. And he found out what I do for a living, that I\u2019m the real rodeo deal. I\u2019m going to be a performer! I mean, on film. They hired me to be one of the couriers when they do the scenes with the fellows slipping out across the Mexican lines.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great,\u201d Kelsey said. \u201cI\u2019m happy for you, Corey.\u201d</p><p>He gave her an enthusiastic hug. \u201cAnd to think! If it wasn\u2019t for you, I probably wouldn\u2019t have stayed on here!\u201d</p><p>Ricky interrupted them. \u201cYou can go into the saloon now. Quietly, I\u2019ve been told. They\u2019re running film. Jeff Chasson wants his practice filmed, in case it\u2019s better than any of the takes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe won\u2019t make a sound,\u201d Kelsey promised.</p><p>She led the way, Logan close behind her. They entered the saloon on tiptoe and walked around the seating area in a wide arc.</p><p>Bernie Firestone, standing near one of the cameramen, turned and waved to them, urging them in.</p><p>Sandy, who was seated at one of the saloon tables, waved as well, inviting them to join her.</p><p>They slid into seats at her table.</p><p>One of the other bartenders was dressed in the vest, cotton shirt and string tie that a bartender might have worn in the mid-1800s.</p><p>Jeff Chasson leaned against the bar like a rugged frontiersman on the day of the Alamo.</p><p>He was blond and clean-shaven, but he did look convincing as he stood there, a hat on the bar, beside a long rifle.</p><p>\u201cIt was here that the men came when they needed respite. Remember, the defense of Texas fell into the hands of a mixture of people\u2014old settlers and new settlers, those who came hoping for land and glory. They were a ragtag band, not a regular army. So, while many a rancher, Ranger and drifter passed through, their station in life didn\u2019t really matter. We\u2019re in the old Longhorn Saloon. Famous for the best whiskey in the area and the prettiest girls. Among them was the legendary Rose Langley. She sang, and she served, and she flirted\u2014the most coveted of all the girls. But she\u2019d come to San Antonio with one of the roughest men to ever draw a bead on Texas. He died in the fight for independence, or so it\u2019s assumed, but he was hardly one of our heroes. Before he disappeared, part of the massive death toll that brought Texas independence, Matt Meyer became enraged with the beautiful Rose, and strangled her right here at the inn, up in Room 207.\u201d</p><p>The narrator turned dramatically to indicate the staircase. \u201cUp those stairs. Room 207. And the history and the legends live on,\u201d he added ominously.</p><p>Kelsey saw the horror on Sandy\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cRose was strangled, but in the aftermath, in the years that followed, like the legend of the Alamo itself, the legend of the Longhorn was destined to continue. So will we ever know? Is the Alamo really hallowed ground, drenched with the blood of heroes? Is it haunted by the men who died there? And is the historic Longhorn just as haunted, with spirits\u2014old and new\u2014drifting along that staircase?\u201d</p><p>Chasson let the sentence fade away.</p><p>Sandy was tense, waiting for what he\u2019d say next.</p><p>Then he settled back at the bar. \u201cJeff Chasson at the Alamo, now and then.\u201d</p><p>The knowing smile left the man\u2019s face as he pushed away from the bar and started toward Bernie Firestone. \u201cThat\u2019s bullshit, pure bullshit. We need to add the part about the murder of Sierra Monte. The Alamo now and then\u2014\u201d he snorted. \u201cWe\u2019ve talked about the massacre in Goliad and what happened in San Antonio. It\u2019s bullshit not to mention the murder last year! We can sell this thing ten times over if we talk about blood dripping through the woodwork. Not then but now.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Ten</p><p>Sandy was distressed. She got to her feet, wanting to protest, clearly not knowing how. Kelsey leaped up, too, and Logan, afraid that Kelsey would try to defend Sandy first and use diplomacy second, decided to take the matter into his own hands.</p><p>He winked at Sandy, then walked over to the director and Chasson.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me,\u201d Logan said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t help overhearing,\u201d he began.</p><p>Chasson turned and stared at him in irritation. \u201cWho the hell are you?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a friend of Sandy\u2019s, and I\u2019m also a Texas Ranger, Mr. Chasson,\u201d Logan said politely. He went on before Chasson could ask what business he had interfering. \u201cI should warn you that you\u2019re in the Longhorn due to the largesse of the owner. The events that occurred here in the 1830s are well-known, but for you to sensationalize the presumed death of an innocent girl is in extremely bad taste. If you simply present known facts, that\u2019s one thing. But you\u2019re doing a documentary on the Alamo, not on unsolved murders in Texas. You could be setting up this production for a major lawsuit\u2014by the owner, by the victim\u2019s family\u2014and you\u2019d be named right along with the production company. Or Ms. Holly might determine that the production should be thrown out and you could be banned from ever stepping foot in the Longhorn Saloon again.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He smiled as he spoke. He\u2019d lost his temper with Ted Murphy, and he wasn\u2019t going to do that again. He was really getting his life, himself, back; dealing with arrogant assholes like Chasson in a smooth and politic way was actually far more satisfactory than losing his temper.</p><p>Chasson scowled at him before turning back to Bernie Firestone. Firestone had been grinning, but he tried to appear stern when Chasson looked at him for help.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Jeff. You said you wanted to film here. And if we\u2019re filming here, Ms. Holly does have a say. You didn\u2019t tell me you planned to talk about Sierra Monte.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d He stared over at Sandy. \u201cBut it\u2019s history!\u201d</p><p>Kelsey walked up to them, Sandy beside her.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Sandy\u2019s property now, Mr. Chasson,\u201d Kelsey said. \u201cAnd she has the right to call the police and have you evicted if you\u2019re breaking an agreement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t agree to anything,\u201d he said angrily.</p><p>\u201cYou can leave,\u201d Sandy offered, apparently delighted with the way things were going.</p> <p>\u201cWe...we paid to film here!\u201d he sputtered indignantly.</p><p>\u201cHowever, I was given script approval,\u201d Sandy said.</p><p>Jeff Chasson might have been a jerk, but he knew when he was outnumbered. He smiled again, the practiced smile he gave the camera. \u201cAll right, forgive me. I wasn\u2019t aware of your script approval, Ms. Holly. But if that\u2019s the case... You see, the documentary traces the history of the Alamo, along with that of Texas. We follow the Alamo through to the present time. Ms. Holly, the Longhorn is a huge part of that. Now, we can leave, and I can say anything that\u2019s fact, and there\u2019s nothing you can do about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true,\u201d Sandy murmured.</p><p>\u201cOr you and I can work on a script together, ensuring that the truth is told, but that you\u2019re happy with what I say.\u201d</p><p>Sandy looked uncertain at that. Her eyes darted to Kelsey, who shrugged. \u201cSandy, it\u2019s totally up to you.\u201d</p> <p>She still hesitated. Chasson placed a hand on her shoulder. \u201cPlease, Ms. Holly? It looks bad if we avoid the truth. Bernie, what\u2019s the schedule? This is all we had for today, isn\u2019t it? Could I have a few minutes with Ms. Holly?\u201d</p><p>Bernie Firestone nodded. \u201cWhatever Ms. Holly decides.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr did you want a larger check?\u201d Chasson asked.</p><p>Sandy straightened regally. \u201cI made a deal. I\u2019m not reneging because of money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. Sandy and I can hammer this out. It won\u2019t take us more than twenty minutes,\u201d Chasson said.</p><p>Guiding Sandy to another table, Jeff Chasson withdrew a pen from his jacket pocket and a cocktail napkin from a longhorn-shaped holder.</p><p>Bernie shook his head. \u201cI knew better than to take on this project.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJeff Chasson calls the shots?\u201d Logan asked.</p> <p>\u201cNot all of them,\u201d Bernie said wearily. \u201cOn some of the narration. Like I told you, he really wanted this project, and the executive producer really wanted him. To be honest, he looks good on camera, he\u2019s got credibility and he has a great voice. This is my first real snag. A lot of the film is action, reenactments of what happened, based on the historical record.\u201d He paused. The cameraman, no longer filming, had taken off his headset, set it over the tripod and waited with weary patience. \u201cI\u2019m not sure you met earlier. This is Earl Candy. An amazing cameraman.\u201d</p><p>Kelsey and Logan shook hands with him, introducing themselves.</p><p>\u201cI wait around a lot,\u201d Candy told them with a good-natured shrug.</p><p>Kelsey laughed, and Bernie Firestone flashed her a smile. \u201cYour cousin Sean is an important part of the process. There are dozens of maps spread across the screen as the narration goes on\u2014he does those. And he\u2019s a whiz with film, working with shots that look like hell until he\u2019s added his smoke and black powder or blazing sun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the cast?\u201d Logan asked in what might have sounded like a non sequitur but wasn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cYou saw today. Most of them have been a dream. Very professional.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019ve hired on a real cowboy,\u201d Logan noted.</p><p>Bernie nodded. \u201cThe guy\u2019s got the look, you know.\u201d He smiled at Kelsey again. \u201cI\u2019d love to have you in a few shots, all dressed up like a saloon girl. And, Raintree, you\u2019d make a damned good Alamo defender.\u201d</p><p>Kelsey immediately demurred. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s for me, but it sounds like Corey Simmons is pleased and excited.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019ll just have to work around the rodeo schedule. There\u2019s always something. And we\u2019re supposed to wrap this up by next week. That\u2019ll be a miracle.\u201d</p><p>Jeff Chasson rose and returned to stand before Bernie. \u201cI\u2019ve got everything settled with Sandy. We\u2019ll film the last part in Room 207. She\u2019s approved the script.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Earl Candy asked. Logan saw that his camera was big and heavy; there were also lights and screens, along with sound equipment.</p><p>Logan saw that Kelsey was frowning, silently echoing his own reaction.</p><p>\u201cKelsey, do you mind?\u201d Sandy asked, hurrying over to her excitedly. \u201cHe\u2019s going to introduce me as the new owner up in your room. We\u2019ll be quick\u2014we have to be. I need to reopen the bar area soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did a wrap-up on the practice tape,\u201d Bernie said.</p><p>\u201cAnd you can edit it, and I damned well know that,\u201d Jeff Chasson snapped. \u201cCome on. Sandy and I have this all worked out, and it\u2019s going to make for a better piece. Our market is the history and learning channels. You have to offer them something new. Something out of the ordinary.\u201d</p><p>Chasson turned away, starting for the stairs with Sandy.</p><p>Bernie Firestone glared after them. \u201cYeah. How about history?\u201d he muttered. But Chasson didn\u2019t hear him, and Sandy had apparently become his best friend.</p><p>\u201cWant me to carry some of the camera equipment?\u201d Logan asked. \u201cI don\u2019t know much about it, but I can haul and take directions.\u201d</p><p>Bernie and Earl Candy looked at him with gratitude. \u201cWait, I\u2019ll get you more help!\u201d Kelsey said cheerfully.</p><p>A moment later, Kelsey was back with Corey Simmons, who was happy to assist with the equipment. Kelsey grabbed a couple of the screens, and with all of them participating, they were able to take up the entire video and sound ensemble in one effort.</p><p>When they reached the room, Sandy was applying what had to be Kelsey\u2019s makeup and trying to move Kelsey\u2019s belongings out of the way. Logan watched Kelsey\u2019s eyes as she surveyed the scene; she held her temper and stepped forward. \u201cSandy, I can shift my belongings into the bathroom and closet for now. Finish your makeup and let me clear everything away.\u201d</p><p>Chasson had already studied the room, and he started giving directions. \u201cBernie, get the room, and then me, with the curtains just so, like that, looking out on the street. We\u2019ll have Cameron play with the film and get some mist going. And shadows. That\u2019ll be great.\u201d</p><p>Logan held still. It was up to Sandy. If she wanted to go along with the arrogant weasel, that was her choice.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll set it all up,\u201d Earl Candy said. \u201cDon\u2019t mind me,\u201d he added a little bitterly.</p><p>\u201cLet me just, uh, get out of the way,\u201d Corey Simmons said. He\u2019d put down the heavy camera he\u2019d carried, looking torn. He\u2019d run screaming from this room, Logan remembered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be back in the kitchen for now, in case y\u2019all need me!\u201d Corey said next. Maybe he was expecting the director or Jeff Chasson to ask him to stay. Neither did. Logan wasn\u2019t sure if Corey was relieved or disappointed.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Corey,\u201d Logan said. The others hadn\u2019t really seemed to notice him, once his function had been fulfilled.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here, if you need me,\u201d he repeated. Then he left, heading back down the long stairway.</p><p>\u201cIs this the way it usually works?\u201d Logan asked Earl Candy in a low voice.</p><p>\u201cWell, there isn\u2019t always a usual in documentaries, but no,\u201d Candy said. \u201cHell, I make a good income and I\u2019m paid by the hour. Guess this\u2019ll let me get the wife an iPad.\u201d</p><p>Chasson did have an eye for the dramatic. He started to tell Bernie what to film, but Bernie took over. \u201cI know what you want, Chasson. And I\u2019ll make it work, but listen to me now. They call me the director for a reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll get out of the way, too,\u201d Logan said.</p><p>Kelsey frowned, and he almost smiled. She wasn\u2019t leaving what was currently her room with these people in it.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll wait here, in the hallway,\u201d he said.</p><p>Kelsey nodded slightly and joined him.</p><p>What Chasson had planned wasn\u2019t derogatory, or disrespectful. He spoke softly, with a reverent hush to his voice as he said, \u201cWe\u2019ve come to Room 207. When some guests phone to book it, they call it the murder room. This was where Rose Langley entertained men from the Alamo, and where she met her death. And where, nearly two centuries later, another young woman encountered a terrible fate, although the truth of that fate is still not known. With me is Sandy Holly, current owner of the Longhorn Saloon and Inn. Sandy, can you tell us more of the story?\u201d</p><p>Sandy looked very pretty\u2014shy and sweet\u2014as she stepped closer. Chasson laid an arm across her shoulders. \u201cMs. Holly, you bought the Longhorn right after the incident with Sierra Monte, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was in the process of buying the saloon, yes, and it was so tragic! We don\u2019t know what happened, other than that a tremendous amount of blood was found in the room. But after the police were finished, a clean-up biohazard crew came in and, as you can see, the room is beautiful now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, Sandy, twice in the same room... Do you think the spirits of Rose Langley and Sierra Monte are still here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I think that if there are spirits, they\u2019re the souls of those who have gone on, and both women know I revere the history in this place, and that they\u2019re as welcome as any other guest of the Longhorn Saloon,\u201d Sandy said earnestly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThank you, Sandy,\u201d Chasson intoned, \u201cand I\u2019m Jeff Chasson for the history of the Alamo and Texas, old and new.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right\u2014was that brilliant, or what?\u201d Jeff asked, coming forward when they were done.</p><p>Logan realized that Sandy was smiling from ear to ear.</p> <p>She came forward, as well, hurrying out to the hallway to throw her arms around Kelsey. \u201cThat was great, just great! I think it will bring tons of people to the inn!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope so, Sandy,\u201d Kelsey told her. She looked at Logan, and he grinned in return. He could tell that they were both wondering what Sandy had been so worried about.</p><p>\u201cDrinks on the house!\u201d Sandy announced. \u201cIf you\u2019re available, of course.\u201d</p><p>Earl Candy nodded. \u201cWorks for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too. I could use a drink,\u201d Bernie said. \u201cEarl, give Cameron a call first. Have him get a gofer to pick up the film and ask him to take a look. I want it back with his effects in it as soon as possible, just to make sure we\u2019ve got something really decent.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThanks for letting us hang around, Sandy,\u201d Logan said. \u201cLet\u2019s get Corey Simmons back up here, and we\u2019ll carry the film equipment down so Kelsey can have her room back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKelsey, wow. You\u2019d be a great interview!\u201d Chasson said, homing in on her.</p><p>\u201cNo, no, I wouldn\u2019t be. I\u2019d ruin your documentary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re staying in this room. Have you been scared? Do you sleep with the lights on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a room, just a room. An ordinary room.\u201d Kelsey spoke evenly and smiled as she looked at him.</p><p>\u201cWell...anyway. Thanks,\u201d Chasson said, turning to Sandy. \u201cI\u2019ll take that drink, Ms. Holly. In fact, I\u2019ll have two. I\u2019m done for the day!\u201d</p> <p>They started down the stairs. \u201cI\u2019ll get Corey. He does know how to tote and haul,\u201d Logan told Kelsey. He left her in the hallway, watching the crew take apart the camera and sound system again.</p><p>He came back with Corey and they helped carry down the equipment. By then, the young gofer who\u2019d been summoned had arrived; he collected the film, and Kelsey\u2019s room was cleared out at last.</p><p>Logan waited with her as she went through her room. She didn\u2019t seem to mind spirits or ghosts at all, but openly resented having Jeff Chasson in her temporary domain. Chasson did have a smarmy charm; Sandy had fallen for it in no time flat. Despite himself, Logan could suddenly envision the hours he and Kelsey had spent together, and it was an almost painful and too-physical memory. He urged himself to abandon the thought. \u201cLet\u2019s run by the Alamo,\u201d he said thickly, \u201cand then get to the station.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cSorry. I just feel...\u201d</p><p>\u201cInvaded?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She laughed. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have your key.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes. But then, Sandy has a key, too.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTrue,\u201d he acknowledged. \u201cThat\u2019s why you should just come and stay with me.\u201d The words were out of his mouth before he knew what he was saying, but as he spoke, he realized he meant them.</p><p>Kelsey shook her head. \u201cSean needs to stay with this documentary. By the same token, I need to stay in Room 207.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cWe should get moving,\u201d he told her. The days were too short for everything they had to do. The killer might already have another woman. But at the moment, he needed to move for another reason. He had concentrated too fully on Kelsey.</p><p>\u201cThe Alamo\u2014and our bench?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He hurried down the stairs. Jeff Chasson, Bernie and Earl Candy were already at the bar, drinking. They were joined by Corey Simmons and several other guests. Chasson was talking to Corey, which didn\u2019t seem to bode well, but there was nothing they could do about it.</p><p>They left the Longhorn and headed out.</p><p>Kelsey hadn\u2019t liked Jeff Chasson in her room, and she couldn\u2019t shake that feeling. Even though he\u2019d kept his words and tone careful, there\u2019d been something nearly salacious as he talked about the murders. And she was worried about Sandy, falling for such a slimy manipulator, but Sandy seemed to be smitten.</p><p>They walked to the Alamo from the inn.</p><p>\u201cNow the rat bastard is talking to Corey Simmons, who wants to be in the documentary. If Chasson finds out that he was in that room, there\u2019ll be hell to pay,\u201d she said to Logan.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Corey won\u2019t say anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure. Corey Simmons is happy as a clam to be in that film. He\u2019s been hired to portray a rugged frontiersman willing to brave the lines of Santa Anna\u2019s army to bring help to his comrades. He\u2019s not going to risk that\u2014or his rodeo career\u2014by admitting he was scared silly in a \u2018haunted\u2019 room and had to be saved by a woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA U.S. Marshal,\u201d she corrected him.</p><p>He didn\u2019t reply but grinned again.</p><p>\u201cNever mind.\u201d she groaned. He was right about Corey\u2019s frontier mentality.</p><p>They reached the Alamo and claimed \u201ctheir\u201d bench, the place Zachary Chase would expect to find them. He didn\u2019t come right away, of course, and they studied the flow of people around the historic shrine, speaking softly about the case as they waited.</p><p>\u201cThe actors at the studio seemed wonderful,\u201d Kelsey said. \u201cOf course, we\u2019ve only met a fraction of the people involved. When Sean was out on location, there were hundreds of extras at a time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but some of those people live out there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere still have to be other people working here, in San Antonio, if they\u2019re doing more scenes at the studio. I mean, they just about have to include the famous scene in which Travis tells the men they can fight or leave. He draws a line in the sand, and James Bowie has himself carried over the line, even though he can\u2019t stand. And there have to be scenes between Santa Anna and the women and children he spared, and Joe, Travis\u2019s slave.\u201d</p><p>He nodded and leaned his head back, catching the last rays of the dying sun.</p><p>\u201cAnd we\u2019re taking the word of a ghost that we\u2019re looking for a man in costume,\u201d he said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou doubt Zachary?\u201d Kelsey asked, a little horrified.</p><p>\u201cNot in the least. But could you begin to explain that to anyone else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cSo, we met some nice actors today. Except for Jeff Chasson, and he\u2019s an idiot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t disagree. But being an idiot doesn\u2019t make a man a murderer, nor does the fact that he\u2019s charming\u2014or can pretend to be\u2014make him innocent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not. But...did you see his eyes light up when he talked about Sierra Monte? It gave me chills,\u201d Kelsey said.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s creepy, but that still doesn\u2019t make him a murderer,\u201d Logan responded. Then he straightened. \u201cHere comes Zachary.\u201d</p><p>And indeed, their friendly spirit was coming toward them, excusing himself as he moved past others who had no idea he was even there. Sometimes people would pause and look around, as if they felt a strange stirring or the whisper of a chill. Maybe they were really feeling the past and the sacred sorrow of the ground on which they walked.</p><p>Zachary made his way to the bench and bowed awkwardly, greeting Kelsey, then took the seat between her and Logan.</p><p>\u201cI have kept my eyes open, and I have been vigilant, through the day and through the night,\u201d he assured them. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to say I have nothing to tell you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing is good,\u201d Logan said. \u201cWe\u2019re afraid that another young woman is going to be kidnapped and killed. We don\u2019t know why this man is taking them, but I was thinking it might have to do with Rose Langley and the Galveston diamond.\u201d</p><p>Zachary Chase frowned. \u201cThe Galveston diamond? It disappeared in Galveston, or so I thought. I always heard it had existed, but that in the scuffle\u2014when Matt Meyers took Rose Langley\u2014it was lost in the sand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe Rose brought it here,\u201d Kelsey said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s interesting, that she might have held on to it.\u201d Zachary spoke very quietly.</p><p>\u201cYou knew Rose, didn\u2019t you?\u201d Logan asked him.</p><p>Zachary nodded, and there was something wistful in his eyes. \u201cI wish...I wish I had been braver. That I had been a better man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn what way?\u201d Kelsey asked gently. \u201cYou must have been a very brave man, to have done all that you did.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, gazing down at his hands. Then he raised his eyes, a rueful expression on his face. \u201cYou have to remember, we didn\u2019t expect Santa Anna when he came. We thought it would take him much longer to march here. And when it all began\u2014well, we still thought the provisional government would send reinforcements. I wasn\u2019t brave just being at the Alamo. And when we were manning the mission... I went to the Longhorn often. I was in love with Rose,\u201d he admitted.</p><p>\u201cYou were in love with her?\u201d Logan repeated, and Kelsey realized that this was something he hadn\u2019t known or guessed.</p><p>\u201cShe was beautiful, and no matter what was done to her, she was so sweet and refined. I wanted to take her away with me. Run in the night. Go somewhere, anywhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Santa Anna\u2019s army was coming,\u201d Kelsey said.</p><p>\u201cI could\u2019ve made my move. I could have slipped away with her and we could have ridden east, ridden as hard as the wind, and escaped. But Rose was afraid for me. He\u2019d nearly killed her man, Taylor, back in Galveston, and she\u2019d seen him shoot another in cold blood over a poker game. I said we should go, anyway\u2014just get the hell out of Texas. But Rose would tell me no, she wouldn\u2019t risk my life, and God help me, there was cowardice in me, because I didn\u2019t insist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow curious,\u201d Kelsey murmured. \u201cBecause, as I said, I believe she did have the diamond. And that, at the cost of her life, she refused to give it to Matt Meyer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you so certain?\u201d Zachary asked. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Kelsey decided not to tell him she\u2019d seen the woman he\u2019d loved, seen her murdered\u2014over and over again, in her dreams and visions.</p><p>Logan didn\u2019t say anything; he waited for her to speak.</p><p>Kelsey took a deep breath. \u201cI believe she had it, Zachary, because people have searched for it for years and years\u2014to no avail. Of course, time passes, seas and sand change, hurricanes almost wiped out Galveston, and still...I think she had it. I suspect she was waiting for her own courage not to fail her, and then she would have ridden away with you.\u201d</p> <p>Zachary smiled and looked at her. \u201cDo you really think so?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I could only reach her...touch her,\u201d he said, his ghostly voice wistful. Then he seemed to give himself a shake. \u201cBut...even if Rose had the diamond, what does that have to do with someone kidnapping women from the Alamo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t figured that out yet,\u201d Logan said.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure? Are you sure it\u2019s the same man, and that it could be connected to Rose and the diamond?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, we\u2019re not, but we need someplace to start.\u201d Logan got to his feet. The darkness was descending upon them. \u201cThank you, Zachary,\u201d he said. \u201cKelsey?\u201d</p><p>She rose, too, and so did Zachary. He began to walk by, then quickly turned.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d he told Kelsey. \u201cI will do my best not to disappoint you.\u201d</p><p>She watched as he moved toward the chapel and disappeared into the dusk and shadows of nightfall.</p><p>\u201cHe may be in love again,\u201d Logan said dryly.</p><p>\u201cJealous?\u201d she teased.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019m a bit ahead of the poor guy, being flesh and blood,\u201d Logan said. He added briskly, \u201cIt\u2019s time to get to the station. I\u2019m tired\u2014and hungry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, we really should remember that thing called lunch,\u201d Kelsey said.</p><p>They retrieved Logan\u2019s car and drove to the station. When they entered their office, Jane and Kat were already there, leafing through a sketch pad with Jackson. \u201cMay we?\u201d Logan asked Jane, and the other three were quiet as Logan and Kelsey looked through the pages together.</p><p>\u201cThese are just sketches,\u201d Jane said. \u201cI have computer renditions that may be better. I don\u2019t know yet. I\u2019ll compare the women and the sketches, and you decide which you want to go with. The sketches give an opaque quality to the faces\u2014it makes them a little dreamier. The computer images are sharper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe sketches...have so much life,\u201d Kelsey said. Jane was a talented artist. The faces on the page seemed to have an individuality. Each woman was drawn with medium-length hair, and yet the personalities all seemed different.</p><p>\u201cWe can put them out tomorrow,\u201d Jane said. \u201cCopies are already at the paper. They just need an approval.\u201d</p><p>Kelsey realized that the others, including Jackson, were looking at Logan. He met Jane\u2019s eyes. \u201cHave them printed, please.\u201d</p><p>She nodded and just then, the door burst open. Sean entered, pulling a computer from his shoulder bag even as he shoved his way in.</p> <p>\u201cYou have to see this,\u201d he said urgently.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Did you come up with something in a grid?\u201d Logan asked.</p><p>Sean was shaking his head. \u201cNo, no. I hear you and Kelsey were there for this! I thought Chasson had fiddled with the image somehow. I thought...I don\u2019t know what I thought. But I haven\u2019t given it back to anyone yet. I haven\u2019t shown it to anyone. I just called Earl Candy and asked him if they\u2019d been playing around with Halloween props or anything of the sort, and he swore they hadn\u2019t. All he\u2019d seen through his lens was Sandy and Jeff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s in the film?\u201d Logan demanded.</p><p>Chapter Eleven</p><p>Logan glanced covertly at Sean, curious about his excitement regarding the film.</p><p>There was nothing unusual in it. At first.</p><p>He saw what he\u2019d seen earlier that day, in a smaller version on the computer.</p><p>Jeff Chasson stood by the window, posing for the camera. He spoke with a husky tremor in his rich voice. \u201cWe\u2019ve come to Room 207. When some guests phone to book it, they call it the murder room. It was where Rose Langley entertained men from the Alamo, and where she met her death. And where, nearly two centuries later, another young woman encountered a terrible fate, although the truth of that fate is still not known.\u201d</p><p>Logan thought Earl Candy was a damned good cameraman. He\u2019d caught the room at just the right angle, getting in the period dressing table and drapes; he\u2019d used a lens that created a mysterious, ethereal quality.</p><p>Chasson spoke again, gesturing Sandy toward him. \u201cWith me is Sandy Holly, current owner of the Longhorn Saloon and Inn. Sandy, can you tell us more of the story?\u201d</p><p>And then Sandy stood next to him, looking sweetly innocent as she faced the camera, Chasson\u2019s arm around her shoulders. \u201cMs. Holly, you bought the Longhorn right after the incident with Sierra Monte, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Sandy nodded. She was a natural, speaking to Jeff, but cheating toward the camera. \u201cI was in the process of buying the saloon, yes, and it was so tragic! We don\u2019t know what happened, other than that a tremendous amount of blood was found in the room. But after the police were finished, a cleanup biohazard crew came in and, as you can see, the room is beautiful now.\u201d</p><p>Logan cleared his throat. \u201cSean, I\u2019m not sure what we\u2019re supposed to be seeing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d Sean said.</p><p>\u201cBut, Sandy, twice in the same room... Do you think the spirits of Rose Langley and Sierra Monte are still here?\u201d Jeff Chasson asked.</p><p>\u201cNo. I think that if there are spirits, they\u2019re the souls of those who have gone on, and both women know I revere the history in this place, and that they\u2019re as welcome as any other guest of the Longhorn Saloon,\u201d Sandy said, passion in her voice.</p><p>And then Logan saw it, but he had to blink to be certain. A shadow seemed to step out of the wall. A shadow in the shape of a woman. As the computer continued to play the scene, they heard something that sounded like a sob.</p><p>As Jeff Chasson wrapped up, then stood there, giving the camera his final half smile, the sob turned to a wail, and then it, and the shadow, disappeared.</p><p>There was silence as they all stared at the blank computer screen.</p><p>\u201cPlay it again,\u201d Logan said.</p><p>Sean did.</p><p>And it came back, exactly the same.</p><p>\u201cNo one\u2019s had the opportunity to alter this film?\u201d Jackson asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see how they could have,\u201d Sean said. \u201cI got a call from Bernie, and he seemed really annoyed with Jeff, except that he thought they\u2019d gotten some good stuff. He wanted to see it, and he wanted me to play with shadow and light, to make the room look spooky and haunted. But this is what I saw before I did a thing.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t think there was time for anyone to look at it, much less alter it in any way.\u201d</p><p>Kelsey turned to her cousin. \u201cYou did say you haven\u2019t given them this footage, didn\u2019t you?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Sean stared at her, exasperated. \u201cOf course not! I kept this and copied it, and cleaned up the sound, then exaggerated the shadow so they\u2019d assume I put it in. I brought the original here.\u201d He glanced from Logan to Jackson, and then at Logan again. \u201cI knew you wouldn\u2019t want any of them seeing this, especially knowing Chasson as I do. He would\u2019ve turned this into a media circus. I figured we didn\u2019t want them following anything related to our dead women right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKelsey, that\u2019s the room you sleep in?\u201d Jane asked.</p><p>Kelsey nodded. Logan felt as if his stomach twisted and every muscle in his body tensed.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you can go back there,\u201d he told her softly.</p><p>But she looked at him with bright eyes. \u201cLogan, everything I\u2019ve seen so far has been like a repetition. It\u2019s just a residual haunting. Now I know there\u2019s someone in the room who can be reached. What I couldn\u2019t tell from the image was whether the woman was Rose Langley or Sierra Monte.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be in there alone,\u201d Sean said, sounding like a big brother. He was her cousin, Logan reminded himself. But at the moment, that didn\u2019t matter.</p><p>\u201cShe won\u2019t be there alone. I\u2019m going to stay with her,\u201d Logan said firmly.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s kind of cute\u2014they\u2019re fighting over you,\u201d Kat said, trying to be light.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think Sean\u2019s fighting to be with me,\u201d Kelsey retorted.</p><p>Logan ignored them both. \u201cKat, anything else from your end?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore of the same. I was able to get more test results from Tara Grissom. And we\u2019re looking at the same mix in her system. She was definitely drugged when she was taken\u2014the same as Vanessa Johnston,\u201d Kat said.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s he getting to them? Wouldn\u2019t you find needle marks?\u201d Kelsey asked.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m not sure yet, but... I probably mentioned that when it\u2019s used medicinally, the drug is often delivered through a patch. The killer might be using the same method, with his own little drug cocktail. That would explain why we can\u2019t find any pinpricks, and it would explain how they became so docile. I\u2019m still looking, but soft tissue decomposes quickly,\u201d Kat said. \u201cYou should also know that you didn\u2019t fail anyone,\u201d she added, looking around at the team. \u201cThere\u2019s a high probability that Vanessa Johnston was killed the night she disappeared. She was covered by plywood, dirt and other grime, but...well, the development of larvae and flies can help a lot in determining time of death.\u201d</p><p>Logan watched Kat, glad she was on the team. Or with the unit. Yes, they were going to be a unit. She was a tiny blue-eyed blonde with more energy than a hummingbird; she was thorough and open-minded, never dismissing the suggestions of law enforcement officers, and always going the extra mile.</p><p>Logan turned to Sean Cameron. \u201cHave you done a grid on the bodies that can help us any?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Sean gestured to the desk where Jake Mallory had set up his computer and the connections to the large screen. \u201cI need about two minutes,\u201d he said. \u201cMay I?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s your show,\u201d Jackson replied.</p><p>Sean nodded and started his own setup. A minute later, a map of the area with an overlay noting the names of the victims appeared. \u201cI\u2019ll explain, although it\u2019s pretty self-evident,\u201d Sean said. \u201cHere we have the Alamo, the Longhorn and the locations where the bodies were discovered. There are only a few blocks between the Alamo and the inn. We\u2019re going to include everything here, in case there is a connection. Rose Langley was found in Room 207, soon after she was murdered. I don\u2019t think anyone proved it was Matt Meyer, but apparently everyone knew it. Due to the amount of blood in Room 207 last year, forensic scientists and medical examiners agree that Sierra Monte didn\u2019t walk out of there alive. If we were to draw a line around the locations where the rest of the bodies were found, including those of our other known victims\u2014Chelsea Martin and Tara Grissom\u2014we have a circle, and the center of that circle would fall right between the Alamo and the Longhorn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think the locations mean anything?\u201d Jane asked.</p> <p>\u201cWell, it means that a killer is staying within his familiar area,\u201d Logan said. \u201cEvery time he\u2019s dumped a body, he\u2019s known exactly where it could be left in plain sight and still remain hidden. So he knows the area. He also knows something about drugs, decomposition and how to manipulate people. Some of these things anyone can study online. And I\u2019m afraid we\u2019re a huge city, so there are plenty of drugs on the street. Plus, it\u2019s really not that hard to go to lectures or read books on criminal science these days, although it would be interesting to find a suspect with knowledge of criminal science in his background.\u201d He looked around at the others. \u201cWe believe this person is never seen accosting the women, because he doesn\u2019t accost them. We also believe he\u2019s taking them from the area of the Alamo. If he\u2019s not creating an obvious problem, there\u2019s no reason for tourists or anyone to notice him. Also, if he\u2019s walking around the Alamo in costume, people just assume he\u2019s part of the program. When Jane\u2019s images go out tomorrow\u2014online and in the paper\u2014we may get more help from the public.\u201d</p><p>He walked over to the board Kelsey had covered with the women\u2019s J. Doe names and locations of death. \u201cThis is conjecture, but... A gem worth probably millions in today\u2019s market disappeared from Galveston right before the Alamo. If it did come to San Antonio, it came with Rose Langley, who was killed in Room 207. We\u2019ve learned that Sierra Monte was exceptionally fond of gems and intrigued by jewelry, and so was Chelsea Martin. We\u2019ve also learned that Tara Grissom was fascinated by the history here, so she likely had knowledge of the Longhorn Saloon, Rose Langley and the Galveston diamond.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow would the killer have known who these women were, and why would he have suspected they\u2019d even heard of the diamond?\u201d Kelsey asked.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a good question.\u201d Logan looked at Sean. \u201cI\u2019ve done computer searches and I\u2019ve checked our identified victims\u2019 email and social network accounts. What we need to find out is whether they were communicating with someone here, in San Antonio, who might\u2019ve been giving them information\u2014and maybe getting ideas or other information from them. That\u2019s just a theory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if some of them were killed so it would look like there\u2019s a serial murderer?\u201d Kelsey asked.</p> <p>Logan turned the question over to Jackson. He was old FBI; he\u2019d worked as a behavioral specialist.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s possible,\u201d he said thoughtfully. \u201cOur scientific investigations have giant holes because most of the bodies were found in such severe states of decomposition, but as far as we can tell, these murders haven\u2019t had the markings of a sexual psychopath. The victims were murdered in different ways. They\u2019re similar only in sex and age. And again, as far as we know, their relationship is to the Alamo or the Longhorn Saloon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe killer almost has to be local, as we\u2019ve discussed, partly because of the time elapsed. Of course, a killer could come and go, but the time and location grids suggest he\u2019s local,\u201d Kelsey said.</p><p>Logan nodded. \u201cI\u2019m going to say local for those reasons, too. We\u2019ll accept the fact that Rose Langley was killed by Matt Meyer. And we\u2019ll work on the theory that the Galveston diamond did come to San Antonio. Rose was the only one who knew where the diamond was, but it seems likely that it was hidden somewhere at the inn.\u201d He looked at Sean. \u201cCan you research the known victims, try to find out if they believed they were psychics? I didn\u2019t see anything about that when I researched them, so I figure we\u2019ll have to ask friends and family directly.\u201d</p><p>Kelsey raised her eyebrows. \u201cKat,\u201d she asked. \u201cCould the killer have kept them alive long enough to question them, or try to get them to a s\u00e9ance, or anything like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course, it\u2019s possible. But still, how did the killer know which women to snatch?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI might have an answer to that,\u201d Sean said. \u201cHe saw their pictures, which made them easy to identify. They\u2019re all over the internet. It\u2019s a reasonable place to start.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe believe he\u2019s dressed up, so we\u2019re looking for someone who does costume events, has access to costumes or might own a costume.\u201d Kelsey glanced at Logan, and then at Jackson Crow. \u201cI honestly think we have that on good authority.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe use everything we get,\u201d Jackson assured her.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something else to keep in mind. We need to discover who might have had an unhealthy interest in the Longhorn, perhaps because of the murders,\u201d Logan said. \u201cI\u2019m almost convinced that one victim\u2014our drowning victim\u2014was killed by someone else, and if we determine her identity, we have a chance of finding her killer. But as to the killings that could continue, our answers may very well revolve around the Longhorn Saloon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe really have to do better with this meal thing,\u201d Kelsey said, popping a piece of cheese in her mouth as she cut pieces from a block of sharp cheddar to add to the salads. \u201cI\u2019m starved.\u201d</p><p>Logan hardly heard what she\u2019d said. He was deep in thought, trying to create a list of everyone he\u2019d seen at the Longhorn in the past few days. Which, of course, meant very little, since the rodeo was in town.</p><p>But there was Ted Murphy, for one.</p><p>All right, he hated the man, but you couldn\u2019t go blaming someone for serial murders simply because you found that someone to be an unbearable prick.</p> <p>\u201cWant to share your thoughts?\u201d Kelsey asked, putting the salad on the table and taking a bottle of red wine from a nearby shelf.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d he answered. \u201cSorry. I was thinking about people at the Longhorn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSandy, Ricky and a host of bartenders and hired help for starters.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cWe\u2019ll get the Rangers and the local police to follow through on employee dossiers,\u201d he said. \u201cI was thinking more about the people we\u2019ve come across there. Like Ted Murphy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe certainly seems excited by the prospect of blood and guts.\u201d She made a sardonic face.</p><p>\u201cJeff Chasson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s sort of a celebrity. Popular historian and performer. And he\u2019s also huge on the blood and guts, or so it seems,\u201d Kelsey said.</p><p>\u201cCorey Simmons\u2014but he\u2019s here for the rodeo, and I\u2019m not sure if he\u2019s ever been to San Antonio or the Longhorn before.\u201d Logan reached into the broiler for the steaks he\u2019d thrown in. He set their food on plates and turned off the oven. \u201cI\u2019ll have profiles run on these people. And if we\u2019re going to look at Jeff Chasson, there\u2019s the rest of the film crew. The director, Bernie Firestone, and the cameraman, Earl Candy.\u201d</p><p>They began their meal. At one point, Kelsey put her fork down and sighed. \u201cLogan, this is like looking for a needle in a haystack. Even trying to narrow down some kind of profile seems next to impossible. San Antonio is the seventh-largest city in the United States. Most Americans know the story of the Alamo, if not all the details. Anyone can rent a costume.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s going to make a mistake or he already has made a mistake, Kelsey. We have to find it,\u201d Logan said.</p><p>\u201cWe can only hope....\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t sure when or how, but they\u2019d tacitly agreed that she\u2019d come home with him. They\u2019d slid into this naturally. When the meeting had broken up, he\u2019d spoken first, suggesting steak. Now they were here, back in his house, as they\u2019d been the night before. Of course, they were still talking business, trying to come up with new possibilities; it was hard to erase a mindful of theories and facts and conjecture.</p><p>But just as natural as his suggestion of steak and her agreement was the way they rose from the dinner table and melted into each other\u2019s arms. Kelsey headed down the hall, and he practically raced after her, then paused to run back and make sure the broiler was off. When he returned, it was to find a trail of clothing leading to the shower.</p><p>Maybe touching the softness of her flesh and breathing in her scent was like a drug. Maybe making love gave them both the mindlessness they needed, if only for a few hours.</p><p>There was something about her. It began with her eyes, the emerald green that seemed so pure and untainted, even with the world around them so ugly and cruel and torn. She was lithe and beautifully golden with a fading tan; against that, her hair was like fire, a fire of temptation and seduction. She was vital in her passion, eyes flashing, whispers ever more erotic, and she moved with the fluidity of water. She could tease and excite and arouse with a sweep of that lustrous burning hair. Making love with her was like a sea of sensation. All-encompassing.</p><p>Shower and then bed. Making love in a stream of water, then making love in the softness of mattress and pillows. Afterward, he lay spent in a way he barely remembered, his mind telling him that sex was just physical heat and desire shared by a man and a woman, and yet somewhere in his soul another voice was telling him there was a difference and he should know it well. The difference between sex and making love... </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As he lay with her, the sudden coolness of the air-conditioning was sweet against the heat of his damp flesh, and he didn\u2019t want to move. Didn\u2019t want to be reminded that his world was a place where the ugliness of day could intrude on the beauty of the night, where there was no escaping who he was or what he did.</p><p>She nudged him. \u201cI need to get back to the Longhorn,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he protested.</p> <p>She rose up on an elbow and smiled. \u201cLogan, you know I have to go back. You\u2019re the one who\u2019s so convinced it all has to do with the Longhorn.\u201d</p><p>She looked down at him, the fall of her hair curling around her naked breast, her eyes that extraordinary green, even in the darkness.</p><p>He reached out for her and drew her to him, his lips just an inch from hers when he whispered, \u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><p>She eased against him as their lips met in a slow kiss that became deep and passionate. Time stood still and yet passed by swiftly. And when she lay beside him again, they didn\u2019t speak, and she didn\u2019t move. As he held her he began to drift off... .</p><p>He saw nothing but darkness before him, and then he felt as if he\u2019d zoomed in somewhere with a camera, going in close. He wasn\u2019t immediately sure where he was. Then he saw that he\u2019d zoomed into Room 207 at the Longhorn, and that he was standing just inside. It was as though a movie began to unfold. There was someone speaking in a raspy voice and he recoiled. He needed to watch, but he didn\u2019t want to, because he was human, and it was agony and anguish to watch another person\u2019s pain and do nothing to stop it.</p> <p>A shadow was coming from the wall. But Sandy wasn\u2019t there, and neither was Jeff Chasson. Just the shadow. He thought he\u2019d see Rose Langley step forth in a corset and garters and chemise, and that he\u2019d witness Matt Meyer placing his fingers around her neck, killing her.</p><p>Because she wouldn\u2019t give him the Galveston diamond.</p><p>But it wasn\u2019t Rose, and the woman wasn\u2019t clad in anything old-fashioned, although he couldn\u2019t have sworn exactly what era, if any, such a simple white gown belonged to. He didn\u2019t need to pinpoint the age of the clothing, however; he recognized the woman\u2019s face. He\u2019d seen it in his files, on the news, perhaps even on a TV screen, but he hadn\u2019t been affected by it back then as he was now. Crime had gone on when he\u2019d left the world for his grandfather\u2019s land and enclosed himself in his circle of mourning. Horrible things had happened but they hadn\u2019t really touched him, hadn\u2019t seemed personal.</p><p>He\u2019d since learned that the world was shared, that he\u2019d gotten into law enforcement with a true desire to find justice, to save the vulnerable and innocent from the brutal and vicious.</p><p>He knew the face. Sierra Monte\u2019s.</p><p>The shadow coming from the wall seemed to be looking straight at him. Her smile was sad, and her whisper was broken and pleading as she whispered, \u201cHelp me. Help them. Help her.\u201d</p> <p>She didn\u2019t fade away, but rather disappeared in an explosion of flapping wings. She\u2019d been a shadow, and then she\u2019d been form, and her form had burst into dozens of black crows that flapped their wings and flew away. He started, and realized he\u2019d been sleeping and that now he was awake.</p><p>Kelsey was gone.</p><p>He leaped out of bed and ran naked down the hallway, to the kitchen. Her clothing no longer lay strewn about.</p><p>He raced back into the bedroom and looked at the clock. He thought he\u2019d barely closed his eyes, but it was 3:00 a.m.</p><p>He was suddenly so anxious, so desperate to find Kelsey, that he nearly dashed out of the house nude. He remembered the shadow with Sierra Monte\u2019s face whispering to him.</p><p>Help me, help them, help her.</p><p>Kelsey was her, and Kelsey was in danger.</p><p>He managed to jump into his jeans and moccasins, grab a shirt and buckle on his gun belt. Then he tore from the house.</p> <p>San Antonio was different by night, especially in what Kelsey considered the heart of it\u2014Alamo plaza. The Alamo shone beautifully in the night lights, while across the street and grass and trees of the plaza, some neon still burned. Ripley\u2019s Believe It or Not offered the visitor a trip through the extreme and the exotic and the plain old weird, and ghost tours were, needless to say, available. Tomb Rider 3D promised to be an entertaining attraction, and for those who wanted a good scare, there was Ripley\u2019s Haunted Adventure, where guests could ride a haunted coffin cage into a world of \u201cbone-chilling\u201d special effects, animatronics and live-action thrill-chill actors.</p><p>But it was three in the morning, so there was no one about. Kelsey decided she loved the city this way.</p><p>She was surprised that she\u2019d been able to slip out of bed without a protest. She\u2019d noted before that Logan seemed to wake at the slightest movement or sound. Not tonight.</p><p>He wanted her to stay, she knew, but men went into protective mode, especially when they were sleeping with a woman. They both understood that she had to stay in Room 207, and that her talents and abilities were why she\u2019d been chosen, why she was with him. Talents and abilities she had to use...</p><p>They all realized there was something in Room 207. Even if she hadn\u2019t already seen the past reenacted there, they\u2019d watched the film.</p><p>Logan would have to forgive her for walking out\u2014and he would, because it was the right thing for her to do. He wanted to come to Room 207 to be with her, but she knew innately that neither one of them wanted to make love in that room, tainted as it was by pain and brutality, so they\u2019d gone to his house with wordless consent.</p><p>It didn\u2019t change the fact that she needed to be in that room. She didn\u2019t mind if he came back with her; she\u2019d actually like it if he did. It was just that...</p><p>He\u2019d been sleeping so deeply. He\u2019d been at rest and she thought that, for Logan, such a deep and encompassing sleep was rare.</p><p>A moon rode high that night, casting a gentle glow along with the streetlights. Turning from the modern attractions to the historical ones, Kelsey saw the old chapel of the Alamo gleaming. With the modern world at her back, it seemed even more hallowed.</p><p>Not until she\u2019d crossed over toward the old chapel was she aware of being followed.</p><p>She paused for a moment, pretending to adjust a shoe. There was no sound. Straining to hear, she caught the rustle of leaves, the sighing of a breeze at night. She straightened, reminding herself that she was a U.S. Marshal. She was armed and deadly with her weapon, and she was smart enough to be a little afraid. It also occurred to her that she just might have a chance to lure someone who might be a killer.</p><p>As she began to move again, she heard a click. Click, click, click.</p><p>Up ahead lay the historic Menger Hotel and other buildings. She needed to move away from the open plaza and find a place to wait.</p><p>Once more she pretended to stop, just to gaze at the chapel in the moonlight, and reflect upon its sanctity and beauty. She listened and thought there might be someone between her and the side of the plaza.</p><p>Kelsey resumed walking, and when she\u2019d cleared the open area, she crouched close to the buildings on her way down the street.</p><p>She slipped into a tiny alley and waited, drawing her Glock, releasing its safety.</p><p>She looked back and heard another sound.</p><p>Not close yet.</p><p>Kelsey leaned against the wall, closing her eyes, and prayed for strength and intelligence in every move, then peered out carefully.</p><p>There was someone there. All she could see was a silhouette, moving slowly, stopping, moving slowly.</p><p>She felt her heart beating and wondered, Could this be the man? A killer, stalking by night?</p><p>She prepared to meet him. She looked out again.</p><p>He was coming closer and closer, and the shadow he cast seemed to dwarf the chapel of the Alamo and the street itself.</p><p>She braced herself to accost him. She turned and faced the man with the mammoth black shadow.</p><p>Chapter Twelve</p><p>Before she could open her mouth, Kelsey heard Logan Raintree\u2019s voice in the night.</p><p>\u201cStop! In the name of the law, stop. I have a Colt aimed at your back and will shoot to kill or cripple. Hands above your head. Turn slowly!\u201d</p><p>Kelsey stepped out from her hiding place. By the glow of the moon and the streetlights she could see that a man stood in the plaza. Logan\u2019s gun was aimed at him, and he was slowly turning, as ordered.</p><p>She walked out, her own weapon drawn. She saw that the man was big\u2014tall and big, not fat, but heavily muscled.</p><p>Corey Simmons.</p><p>\u201cLogan!\u201d Corey said with relief. \u201cWhat the hell?\u201d</p><p>She could see that Logan wasn\u2019t smiling. As she walked back to the plaza to skirt around Corey and join Logan, she saw that Corey was starting to lower his hands.</p><p>\u201cNo! Keep them up!\u201d Logan shouted.</p><p>Corey did. He now had a Colt and a Glock aimed at him.</p><p>His handsome face appeared puzzled.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? What\u2019s this about?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cYou carrying a weapon?\u201d Logan asked Corey, flashing an angry glance Kelsey\u2019s way.</p><p>She frowned in return, indicating her own grasp on the Glock.</p><p>\u201cI got me a little peashooter here, and it\u2019s legal! Totally legal. Hell, Logan, you know that. This is Texas!\u201d Corey said.</p><p>\u201cGet his gun,\u201d Logan told Kelsey.</p><p>She went over to Corey. He was carrying a Smith &amp; Wesson, stuffed into his waistband.</p><p>As she took it, she saw his eyes on her, wide and disbelieving. \u201cWhat\u2019s this all about, Kelsey?\u201d He sounded hurt and confused.</p><p>She backed away from him. \u201cWhy were you following me?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI just left a bar up the street, over there, on the other side of Ripley\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe bars are all closed now,\u201d Logan said.</p><p>\u201cYes, it\u2019s closed. That\u2019s why I left!\u201d Corey returned indignantly. \u201cSmell my breath!\u201d</p><p>He exhaled a rich plume of alcohol that spoke for itself.</p><p>\u201cSo, why were you following me?\u201d she asked again.</p><p>\u201cHell, I didn\u2019t know I was following you. I didn\u2019t intend to follow anyone. But if I was following you\u2014or anyone else\u2014it would be to make sure you got where you were going safely! Some bad things have been happening here, which you know! Can I put my hands down now?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNot yet. Kelsey, see what else\u2019s he\u2019s carrying,\u201d Logan said.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Kelsey murmured, patting him down.</p><p>\u201cBest thrill I\u2019ve had all night,\u201d he told her. \u201cExcept I\u2019d like to know what gives you the right to do this.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cProbable cause!\u201d Logan said, walking forward.</p><p>Kelsey turned to Logan. \u201cHe\u2019s got his wallet, Logan. His wallet, his keys and nothing more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, could I put my hands down?\u201d Corey asked.</p><p>Logan nodded as Kelsey stepped away from him. Corey let his hands fall, shaking his shoulders, then rubbing his arms. \u201cWhat the hell is the matter with you two?\u201d he grumbled. \u201cIt\u2019s me! Corey. The coward who couldn\u2019t stay in 207!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt sure looked as if you were following Kelsey,\u201d Logan said.</p> <p>\u201cWell, I wasn\u2019t. And you can check out Mike\u2019s bar tomorrow. He\u2019ll tell you I\u2019d been drinking, and that when he closed the place, the two of us were still shooting the breeze, and then I left. On foot. No driving under the influence. Can I have my gun back?\u201d</p><p>Logan\u2019s jaw locked; Corey saw his expression.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d Corey said. \u201cYou keep it. For now. Check out my story with Mike tomorrow. Then you can give it back to me.\u201d</p><p>He probably expected Logan to return the gun after that, but Logan didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cGreat. You\u2019re being a good, responsible citizen,\u201d Logan said.</p><p>\u201cSo, now what? We stand here in the street?\u201d Corey asked. \u201cAh, come on! I want to get back, I want to get some sleep. And you know, don\u2019t you, that I can complain about this?\u201d</p> <p>It was the wrong thing for him to have said.</p><p>\u201cYou go ahead and complain.\u201d Logan\u2019s voice was quiet. Deadly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry!\u201d Corey said. \u201cI\u2019m just tired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s move on,\u201d Logan said.</p><p>\u201cWalk ahead,\u201d Kelsey suggested.</p><p>He did. They followed at a distance.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you leave without me?\u201d Logan whispered fiercely.</p><p>\u201cYou were sleeping so soundly, I didn\u2019t want to wake you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut we know stuff goes on around here!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was armed, Logan, and I heard him. I was ready for him. Please, have some faith in me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re talking about someone who can drug people in a heartbeat and lure them away, Kelsey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was okay, Logan, really.\u201d</p><p>He paused, looking at her. \u201cIf I start to wander off alone, stop me, will you?\u201d</p><p>Up ahead, Corey sensed or heard the friction. He came to a halt. \u201cGuys? Do I get to keep walking? What\u2019s going on here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d they both snapped.</p><p>\u201cKeep walking,\u201d Logan added.</p><p>They reached the Longhorn together. The saloon was quiet; the bar was shut down for the night.</p><p>Kelsey moved ahead to use her passkey to let them in the front door. Corey Simmons had one, too, as did the other guests.</p><p>She moved back so he could go ahead of her.</p><p>\u201cNow, that just doesn\u2019t feel right,\u201d Corey said. \u201cMe, stepping in front of a lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t think of me as a lady, Corey. Think of me as\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah. A U.S. Marshal.\u201d</p><p>He went in, but waited for her and Logan. \u201cAm I allowed to go to bed? Wake up and have coffee and breakfast in the morning?\u201d</p><p>Logan studied him and nodded. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut now I\u2019m on your radar. You suspect me of something. God Almighty, all I did was walk back to my hotel after drinking. I was being a responsible citizen, Raintree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou harassed me for nothing,\u201d Corey said angrily.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps,\u201d Logan agreed.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t do anything!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. It appeared that you were following a young woman at three in the morning, and there\u2019s been bad stuff happening, as you pointed out yourself,\u201d Logan said.</p><p>\u201cCorey,\u201d Kelsey told him quietly, \u201cif you\u2019re waiting for an apology, you\u2019re not going to get one. You\u2019re probably totally innocent, but if Logan hadn\u2019t accosted you when he did, you would\u2019ve met up with my Glock. Go to sleep, all right? What were you doing out so late drinking, anyway? I can see having a few beers, but shouldn\u2019t you be getting ready for the rodeo? Don\u2019t you want to be in top form?\u201d</p><p>That made him even more indignant. \u201cI\u2019m a cowboy! The real deal. We know how to drink and smoke and cuss\u2014and still be in top form!\u201d Corey shook his head as if they\u2019d never understand. \u201cBesides, I wouldn\u2019t hurt a fly. Hell, I even wrangle a calf gently!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you do,\u201d Kelsey said.</p><p>Corey muttered under his breath. He stared hard at Logan, and then Kelsey. \u201cWell, good night, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood night, Corey.\u201d Kelsey spoke in a low voice, but Logan didn\u2019t respond.</p><p>He started up the stairs. Logan and Kelsey watched him as he approached his room\u2014her old room\u2014at the far end of the upstairs gallery. He walked to the railing and looked down at them.</p><p>\u201cGoing to bed now,\u201d he called softly.</p><p>\u201cSweet dreams!\u201d Kelsey called back.</p><p>Logan just watched him. He\u2019d make sure their door was locked that night. And bolted.</p><p>Corey Simmons waved, and moved away from the balcony. They heard a door open and then shut.</p><p>\u201cIs it Corey?\u201d Kelsey whispered.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know, do we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, he wasn\u2019t going to drug me, Logan. He didn\u2019t have a thing on him, I guarantee you, no needles or anything of the kind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe not. It still seemed suspicious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd his story could be completely true,\u201d Kelsey said.</p><p>\u201cCould be. I\u2019ll check at Mike\u2019s bar tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right. So. Now what?\u201d Kelsey asked him.</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cNow we go to Room 207. And we see what it offers tonight.\u201d</p><p>Logan lay awake. He\u2019d stripped down to his jeans, but he\u2019d been tempted to keep his boots on. He was glad he\u2019d gotten the few hours of dream sleep he had, because he had a feeling he wouldn\u2019t be getting any more that night.</p><p>He wondered why. The bed was comfortable and the night quiet, and he liked having Kelsey beside him. He respected her. He knew she\u2019d been good when she\u2019d worked for the U.S. Marshal\u2019s Office; if she hadn\u2019t been, she wouldn\u2019t be here. Jackson Crow still seemed a somewhat elusive character, but Logan was convinced that he did know his business and that he\u2019d chosen his people carefully.</p><p>At night like this, with her by his side, he could forget for a few seconds at a time what they both did. Her breathing was soft, the feel of her hair against his bare skin as soft as a whisper, and the warmth of her body touched him. He felt an urge to protect her\u2014and to experience ease and comfort, as well.</p><p>The old-fashioned clock on the bedside table ticked the seconds away. The drapes were drawn, but they were gossamer and lace, much as they would\u2019ve been years ago, when the Longhorn was built.</p><p>The room was quiet. That night\u2019s shadows seemed to be natural ones, caused by the glow of artificial light from beyond the delicate curtains.</p><p>He drew her closer to his chest, and felt the movement of her breath as she slept. She seemed at peace.</p><p>He remembered waking earlier and discovering that she was gone. He thought about Corey Simmons and reminded himself ruefully that, yes, she was capable, and yes, she\u2019d been prepared if someone had accosted her.</p><p>But the strange image in his dream kept coming back to him. Shadows, and then a face, and a face he knew, not from life, but from the pictures he\u2019d seen of her.</p><p>Sierra Monte. Appearing as a face in the shadows and crying out.</p><p>Help me. Help them. Help her.</p><p>Even if he was learning to forgive himself, he could never forget the words that first warned him Alana was in trouble. The call from a bitter man, asking him, \u201cDo you know where your wife is, Ranger Raintree? I think she\u2019s calling you. I\u2019m going to give you a chance because you seem to follow the law, Raintree. Instead of shooting people, you arrest them, and I respect that. You arrest people and they wind up on death row with a little extra time. So I\u2019m giving you time to find your wife. They say that you\u2019re some kind of soul sucker or psychic. Anyway, I hear her calling. Help me, help me, help me.\u201d</p><p>He felt sweat bead on his cold skin, and he fought hard not to relive the past. This was the present. And there\u2019d be another dead woman if they couldn\u2019t stop what was happening.</p><p>He\u2019d been lost in his own thoughts for a long time when he suddenly realized that Kelsey had stiffened beside him. She pushed herself into a sitting position.</p><p>\u201cKelsey?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes were open; she stared straight ahead.</p><p>\u201cKelsey?\u201d he said again.</p><p>But she didn\u2019t seem to hear him. She seemed to still be asleep and yet she was staring across the room.</p><p>To Logan, nothing had changed. The room looked exactly the same. The drapes seemed to float as if a breeze was coming in, although the windows were closed. However, this was no paranormal phenomenon\u2014the air-conditioning ducts sat directly beneath them. The dressing table was to the left of the windows as he looked at them, and the wall was to the right, a bare corner. The second tall period chest broke up the expanse of wall; a swivel mirror sat atop it. When he looked at the mirror, it returned nothing but darkness and shadow and the wall across from it.</p><p>Kelsey was staring into the corner of the room where there was only wall.</p><p>\u201cKelsey.\u201d Once more, he said her name, and again, she didn\u2019t respond.</p><p>He watched her for a moment, wondering if he should wake her.</p><p>He decided to wait.</p><p>She slid over him, as if he weren\u2019t there at all, as if she were rising from an empty bed. Unmoving, she stood beside him, still staring at the corner.</p><p>He hesitated, just watching her.</p><p>She took a hesitant step toward the wall, then paused. Her face was creased with pain and empathy. He began to fear for her, but he fought the temptation to grab her and shake her. Was she sleepwalking? If so, it might be dangerous to startle her into wakefulness. And if not... </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She took another step. And then she slowly reached out, leaning forward as she extended her arm, fingers dangling in the air as though she was trying to touch someone.</p><p>It was then that the subtle change came.</p><p>There were shadows in the room, yes. But now those shadows began to flicker, to dance, following the movements of objects or people that could not possibly exist.</p> <p>One of the shadows moved from the wall... .</p><p>It was there, the way it had been on the film. So far, it hadn\u2019t taken any form, but seemed to be a mass.</p><p>Like birds. Like birds forming some kind of image, their wings flapping as they hovered.</p><p>He waited. There\u2019d be a face. And the face wouldn\u2019t be that of Rose Langley; it would be Sierra Monte\u2019s.</p><p>He blinked and the shadows seemed to darken, to cover the walls and the furniture and drip down them, like shadow blood.</p> <p>Kelsey took another step, and another, still reaching out.</p><p>Suddenly, he was afraid for her. He didn\u2019t know what he was seeing, and he certainly didn\u2019t know what she saw. He didn\u2019t want to wake her, but neither could he leave her as she was.</p><p>He rose from the bed and stood behind her, wanting to touch her, to draw her back.</p><p>She stepped forward, and he followed.</p><p>They moved toward the shadow, and again he waited, expecting the face to appear... .</p><p>But it didn\u2019t. Kelsey reached the shadow, and she was almost within it. He slid an arm around her shoulders, determined not to let her know that darkness alone.</p> <p>No face appeared before him, but in his mind, he heard the plea again.</p><p>Help me. Help them. Help her.</p><p>He stepped back, drawing Kelsey with him. There were no birds in the room, but he thought he heard a flutter of wings. As he\u2019d dreamed earlier, the shadow seemed to burst into dozens of shadowy black birds, wings flapping as they disarticulated the shape they\u2019d been, and disappeared.</p><p>The room seemed lighter.</p><p>Logan stayed next to Kelsey. She looked confused, and her arm dropped to her side.</p><p>The room was lighter, he realized. Morning was coming, dispelling the last of the darkness as the sun began to rise in the eastern sky.</p><p>A shaft of bright light found its way to them. Kelsey turned and blinked and looked at him.</p><p>\u201cLogan? Why are you standing there like that?\u201d And then she seemed to notice her own position. \u201cWhy am I standing here like this?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat did you see?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cSee where?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the corner.\u201d</p><p>She turned again, still half-asleep and confused. She seemed to wait for him to speak first, and then said, \u201cThat corner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKelsey, you were sleepwalking. Or something,\u201d he told her. \u201cYou don\u2019t remember anything? Anything at all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Logan, it\u2019s so strange. You know I\u2019ve seen what I assume to be an incident of residual haunting in here. I\u2019ve described it to you as precisely as I can remember. But just now\u2014\u201d She broke off. \u201cI don\u2019t remember. I don\u2019t remember a thing.\u201d</p><p>He looked at her anxiously, but her eyes were so lost, he didn\u2019t want her worrying anymore.</p><p>\u201cMaybe it\u2019ll come to you,\u201d he said casually. \u201cAnyway, we can try for another hour or so of sleep.\u201d</p><p>She touched his cheek. \u201cLogan, I\u2019m so sorry I woke you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m awake half the time on my own.\u201d With a broad smile, he swept out an arm. \u201cAfter you, Marshal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore sleep.\u201d She yawned. \u201cThat\u2019ll work for me.\u201d</p><p>She walked to the bed and crawled over to the far side. He got in beside her, lying on his back, and she curled against him.</p><p>Once again, he lay awake. The room was bathed with light.</p><p>He remembered being with Alana one time, remembered her asking, \u201cWhy do ghosts only seem to appear at night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe they like subterfuge,\u201d he\u2019d told her. But then he\u2019d recalled things he\u2019d seen in the light of day, and he thought about Zachary Chase walking the Alamo and the plaza, in both the mornings and the afternoons. He\u2019d said to Alana, \u201cI suppose ghosts are like the rest of us. Some like the daytime hours, others the night. Some are brazen and some are shy. Some don\u2019t want to be seen. And some want you to hear them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be the same as people, wouldn\u2019t it?\u201d Alana had mused. \u201cSome know how to ask others for what they need, and some don\u2019t. And will simply go without.\u201d</p><p>Alana was gone. Truly gone. Whether to the heaven of her Christian fathers, or the great hunting plain of the western tribal people, she had passed on. She had said her goodbyes and embraced whatever new world she\u2019d entered.</p><p>Murder victims often did stay behind. At least until their murderers were apprehended. And if they never were...</p><p>He hoped that victims like Chelsea Martin and Tara Grissom never had to see what they\u2019d become. He vowed silently that he\u2019d do whatever he needed to find them rest.</p><p>He felt Kelsey shift beside him again; she\u2019d gone back to sleep. He smiled slightly.</p><p>So easy for her...</p><p>He closed his eyes.</p><p>Logan had already gone downstairs when Kelsey finished showering and dressing. She was about to strap on her gun, grab her bag and head down after him when she paused. She could remember waking, with the two of them standing in the corner together, and she could remember what he\u2019d told her. She could even remember that she\u2019d been exhausted. And yet despite all that, it had been incredibly easy to go back to sleep.</p><p>She thought of the day she\u2019d come up here after Corey Simmons had run screaming down the stairs.</p><p>That was when she\u2019d seen it. Matt Meyer killing Rose Langley.</p><p>If only everything could play out so clearly before her mind\u2019s eye!</p><p>She held very still and waited, but the spectral image didn\u2019t come again. And yet as she stood there, she felt there\u2019d been a subtle change in the room. It hadn\u2019t just occurred; it had happened since her room was invaded by the film crew.</p><p>She considered the film Sean had brought them. Had something else come into the room, something that had lain dormant and was now awakened? She didn\u2019t know. She waited for a few minutes, but nothing moved or changed. She\u2019d opened the drapes. There wasn\u2019t even a shadow in the room.</p><p>She started to walk out, then paused again.</p><p>\u201cI want to help you,\u201d she said. But although she waited another full minute, nothing happened. Nothing at all.</p><p>She went downstairs to find Logan sitting at one of the saloon tables. Ricky had just poured him a cup of coffee and seemed to be expecting her. \u201cMorning, Miss Marshal,\u201d he said.</p><p>Kelsey laughed. \u201cGood morning, Ricky. That makes it sound as if my last name is Marshal, but, hey, you call me whatever you like. Although Kelsey will do just fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCoffee, Kelsey?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she said.</p><p>As Ricky went off to bring another cup, Logan spoke softly. \u201cHe told me it\u2019s quiet this morning because their cowboy guests left early for a preliminary meet out at the stockyards. Apparently, our friend Corey was quiet and a bit grouchy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not exactly a surprise,\u201d Kelsey said.</p><p>Logan shrugged. \u201cSorry. I can\u2019t seem to trust him. Oh, wait. I\u2019m not supposed to trust him. I\u2019m law enforcement.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t get a chance to reply. Sandy came hurrying over to the table, a newspaper clutched in her hands.</p><p>She set it down in front of them and pulled up a chair, saying, \u201cHere\u2019s today\u2019s front page.\u201d</p><p>Jane\u2019s sketches, created from what remained of the faces she\u2019d seen, the skull bones she\u2019d recorded and measured, and her own intuition, stretched across the paper beneath a headline that read Have You Seen These Women?</p><p>Kelsey looked at Sandy. \u201cThis is great. We\u2019re trying to identify these women,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m glad the paper\u2019s being good about helping law enforcement.\u201d</p><p>Sandy tapped one of the faces. \u201cI knew this girl!\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Logan asked sharply. \u201cSandy, who is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t tell you her name. She stopped by and asked if I needed any more help. I didn\u2019t, but I thought about her after she left. I began to think maybe she\u2019d been a runaway, and that I might have done something for her. And now...now she\u2019s one of the dead women, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Logan said. \u201cSandy, can you remember anything about her? When did she come by?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree months ago, maybe four. I feel dreadful! If I\u2019d done something, she might still be alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no reason to feel that way. Try to think back. She didn\u2019t give you a first name?\u201d Kelsey asked.</p><p>\u201cSusan, Sally, Sarah...it began with S.\u201d</p><p>Ricky had returned with a cup of coffee for Kelsey. \u201cSherry,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cSherry,\u201d Kelsey repeated, turning her attention from Sandy to him. \u201cRicky, did you talk to her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, we talked for a while. She seemed at least twenty-one. She was a nice girl, fascinated by the Longhorn, and I swear she knew more about the place than I did. Her last name started with an H.\u201d</p><p>Logan gave an encouraging nod.</p><p>\u201cBoy, we\u2019re batting a thousand here, aren\u2019t we?\u201d Ricky sighed. \u201cHiggins, Highland, Hilbert\u2014something like that. We were slow at the time. So much so, there were some nights Sandy and I were the only ones working. And we survived because of the local crowd.\u201d Ricky frowned and looked at Sandy. \u201cWe were getting a lot of newspaper people in then, Ted Murphy among them. He\u2019s always been a jerk, but he\u2019s a jerk who built up a bar tab and paid it, so we were actually glad to see him. You might want to check with Ted Murphy. I think he sat at the bar with her.\u201d</p><p>Sandy sniffed. \u201cMurphy wanted to set up cameras and stuff in Room 207 and see what he could get. Unlike him, I don\u2019t want to sensationalize the place. Of course, other than his bar tab, which he\u2019s always paid, he wants everything for free.\u201d</p><p>Logan was on his feet. Kelsey swallowed a few sips of her coffee, preparing to leave. But Logan wasn\u2019t ready to go. He pointed at the paper again. \u201cSandy, Ricky, please take a good long look at all the women on this page. Do you recognize any of the others?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>They both stared at the paper, and then at Logan. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Sandy said.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d He nodded. \u201cWho else was local around that time? Did you ever see Jeff Chasson or anyone from the film crew?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d Sandy said.</p> <p>\u201cThink harder.\u201d</p><p>She chuckled. \u201cIf I\u2019d seen that Jeff Chasson before, I\u2019d know it, trust me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the other men? The director, Bernie Firestone, or Earl Candy?\u201d Kelsey persisted.</p><p>Sandy shook her head.</p><p>\u201cA lot of the rodeo guys were around back then. There was some kind of local rodeo thing going on,\u201d Ricky said.</p> <p>\u201cCorey Simmons?\u201d Kelsey asked.</p><p>\u201cHe wasn\u2019t staying here,\u201d Sandy replied. \u201cThis is the first time I know of that he\u2019s gotten a room here. I think he was at one of the chain hotels, but he used to come to the bar at night with the others.\u201d</p><p>Ricky studied the paper, and his eyes seemed sad.</p><p>\u201cAs far as the film guys go, I might\u2019ve seen both of \u2019em in here, maybe on a Saturday night\u2014or another night when we had entertainment. It was busy\u2014half the world was around.\u201d He looked back down at the paper again, and then up at Logan. \u201cThis girl...I think I\u2019ve seen her, too, although it\u2019s hard to tell from sketches, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou saw her here?\u201d Kelsey asked. \u201cAt the Longhorn?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I saw her at church. The Congregational church, about five blocks behind the Ripley\u2019s side of the plaza.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s my church. I like it there.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWas she a regular?\u201d Logan asked.</p><p>\u201cNo...but I saw her a few times. I\u2019m sorry. I can\u2019t remember better than that, and I may be wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great, Ricky,\u201d Logan told him. He turned to Kelsey. \u201cReady to go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReady,\u201d she said. Waving goodbye to Sandy and Ricky, they left by the front door.</p><p>Logan was moving quickly that morning. He jogged to his car, pausing at the passenger side, as if remembering he should open the door for her\u2014and then deciding that he shouldn\u2019t because they were partners and not a couple going out on a date. He slid into the driver\u2019s seat, and Kelsey got in beside him.</p><p>\u201cThe phones will probably be ringing off the walls\u2014or they would if they were on walls these days,\u201d Logan said.</p><p>She agreed. They drove to the station where they were greeted by the desk sergeant before they could head over to the task force.</p><p>\u201cTen calls already. Some are crackpots, telling me they envision the girls on a lily pad or some such thing, but I\u2019ve got everything down. I\u2019m assuming you want even the crackpots.\u201d</p> <p>Logan thanked him. Kelsey saw that it was just eight when they entered the room, and so far, they were the only ones there. Logan got on the phone, returning the calls they\u2019d received, while Kelsey studied the information they had on the unidentified women she\u2019d given J names.</p><p>She brought out the files she\u2019d been working with and read them through.</p><p>\u201cJane Doe, strangled, discovered by a rock pile, semihidden, near a pond in a public park. Jenny Doe, found in a trash dump, stabbed to death. Judy Doe, strangled, again found in a public park. Jodie Doe, dragged out of the river, drowned. Julie Doe\u2014most recent victim until Vanessa Johnston, dead about a month\u2014strangled and left in a pond, discovered by divers. Josie Doe, found in a compost heap, stabbed to death.\u201d</p><p>She compared the names to Jane\u2019s sketches and notes, and started adding her own comments.</p><p>Josie Doe was actually Sherry H-something, according to Sandy and Ricky. And the girl Ricky had seen at the Congregational church had been their drowning victim, Jodie Doe.</p><p>Logan covered the phone\u2019s mouthpiece. \u201cThis caller believes that our Jane Doe is his niece, Linsey Applewood. She\u2019s from New Orleans, and no one\u2019s heard from her since she disappeared out of her uptown apartment.\u201d</p><p>Kelsey nodded and included that information. Logan asked the man questions, making notes as he did, then took another call. He was quiet, listening.</p><p>He hung up and looked over at her. \u201cThat was Reverend Milton from the Congregational church. Ricky was right. She was there. She and her husband didn\u2019t stay long, because he didn\u2019t think the church focused enough on family issues. That they were too permissive and not following the dictates of the Bible.\u201d He hesitated. \u201cReverend Milton paid a courtesy call on the family, and the husband said his wife had left him and moved back to New Mexico.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess she didn\u2019t move back.\u201d</p><p>Logan looked at her a moment longer. \u201cThe husband\u2019s an actor,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we met him yesterday.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Thirteen</p><p>The fact that they knew that one of their victims had been married and never reported missing because she\u2019d supposedly left her husband and moved back home did not make that husband guilty of murder. It did, however, make him a \u201cperson of interest.\u201d</p><p>Jackson accompanied Logan when he went to pay a call on the actor, Ned Bixby, who\u2019d been portraying one of Santa Anna\u2019s men in the documentary.</p><p>He knew that he wished the \u201cperson of interest\u201d had been Jeff Chasson, and he knew, too, that was wrong.</p><p>He just didn\u2019t like the man.</p><p>And Ned Bixby had seemed humble and nice enough.</p><p>They\u2019d phoned his home and gotten no answer, and when they\u2019d phoned the studio, they learned that Ned had called in sick that day.</p><p>They tried walking around the man\u2019s house, and they spoke to his neighbors. He\u2019d gone out that morning, and they hadn\u2019t seen him since. He hadn\u2019t looked sick.</p><p>They visited Reverend Milton, who was sad to hear that the young wife, Cynthia Bixby, was dead. \u201cShe was a sweet, quiet little thing. Her husband seemed to answer for her all the time. I had a lovely talk with her once when she came to church alone. She was excited to be living in San Antonio\u2014both of her parents have passed on and she was an only child\u2014and she loved the area. She was big on the history of San Antonio. She had a teaching degree, but her husband wanted her to stay home and raise a family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid they seem to be having any marital problems?\u201d Logan asked.</p><p>\u201cNo\u2014I mean, other than the fact that she looked to him every time she was about to speak. They sat together. They even held hands. Then he called one day and said thank you, but they wouldn\u2019t be back. He was looking for a church where he could be closer to God, and where he would know that he was on the right track to do God\u2019s will. As I said, I went by after that, just a courtesy call, and I found Ned alone at home. He told me Cynthia had woken up one morning and told him she didn\u2019t want to be married to him anymore, she needed to break away and live a life that was more fulfilling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas he angry, bitter, nonchalant? How did he appear?\u201d Jackson asked.</p><p>\u201cA little bitter, I think. He said she didn\u2019t seem to understand that no matter what society dictated, God felt that a wife should stay home, raise children and honor her husband. She wanted to get out and see the world. He said he believed she wanted to drink and cavort and perhaps sleep with other men.\u201d He shrugged, tapping his fingers on the desk. \u201cI thought maybe she just wanted to make her own choice about what to order off a menu.\u201d</p><p>Eventually, they left the reverend, and had an all-points bulletin sent out so they could find their \u201cperson of interest\u201d and talk to him.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have to leave it to the patrols and get back. Kelsey\u2019s going to have her hands full at the station, even with Jane and Kat helping her and Jake returning. We\u2019re not getting anywhere here,\u201d Jackson said.</p><p>\u201cI have an idea, one last try before we go back.\u201d Logan mentally consulted his notes. \u201cCome on, one more drive. That\u2019s it.\u201d</p><p>Logan drove to the edge of the city. Jackson didn\u2019t question him until they pulled onto a quiet road.</p><p>\u201cIs this where the pond is?\u201d Jackson asked.</p><p>Logan nodded. \u201cI gather it\u2019s down there. Divers were cleaning it out when she was found.\u201d</p><p>Jackson followed him as he walked across the park. Logan saw the man perched glumly on the rocks by the pond and motioned to Jackson, who walked around the other way.</p><p>Ned didn\u2019t look the same as he had the day before, when he\u2019d been a member of Santa Anna\u2019s army. Gone were the beard and mustache, and the hat. He was clean-shaven, his hair dusky blond. He was young, too, no more than mid-twenties.</p><p>\u201cNed,\u201d Logan said, approaching him.</p><p>The young man looked up. Panic streaked across his face and he stood, obviously planning to run in the opposite direction.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t. Don\u2019t run,\u201d Jackson said. He had his gun at the ready. Jackson wasn\u2019t going to shoot; Logan knew that. But Ned Bixby didn\u2019t.</p><p>Bixby turned to him again, then back to Jackson. Defeated, he looked at Logan.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t do it,\u201d he said. He lifted his hands and let them fall. \u201cI was angry with her, yes. But I didn\u2019t kill her. I couldn\u2019t kill her. I could never raise a hand against her. I loved her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe just need to ask you some questions,\u201d Logan told him.</p><p>\u201cSure. Oh, yeah, sure. I believe that in the eyes of the world, I\u2019ll be judged quickly. Guilty,\u201d he said wearily. \u201cIsn\u2019t it always supposed to be the husband?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo out of six?\u201d Jane asked Kelsey.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure we\u2019ll have more once we piece together everything we\u2019ve got,\u201d Kelsey said.</p><p>Kat cleared her throat. \u201cWe have a definite ID on our first victim, Jane Doe. I\u2019ve just compared the dental records, and the young woman is Linsey Applewood, out of New Orleans. She\u2019d lived there since graduation from Tulane. She didn\u2019t have a roommate, and she didn\u2019t say a word to anyone, just packed up one morning and left. But she must\u2019ve intended to come back. The apartment was full of her belongings and the landlord finally put them up for auction.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat was her major at Tulane?\u201d Kelsey asked.</p><p>\u201cHistory.\u201d</p><p>Kelsey drummed her fingers and started shuffling through the pile of messages they\u2019d received. She found the one from Linsey Applewood\u2019s uncle. \u201cKat, do you have a number for the landlord?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRight here,\u201d Kat said. \u201cMr. Dillard. I\u2019ll dial it, just pick up the line.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>The landlord seemed to be a nice man who was truly disheartened to hear that Linsey was dead. Kelsey let him talk and consoled him the best she could. Then she said, \u201cIt sounds as if you knew her fairly well. I\u2019m so sorry, Mr. Dillard. Perhaps you could tell me more about her. What did she like and dislike? What were her hobbies?\u201d</p><p>Dillard told her that Linsey Applewood had loved animals and spent many an afternoon at the zoo. She enjoyed jazz music, and kept talking about buying a saxophone. She was cheerful and sweet. She dated, but hadn\u2019t been serious about anyone, and she liked to spend time with her girlfriends.</p><p>\u201cThose girls, they just cracked me up!\u201d Dillard said with a sad sigh. \u201cThey were so silly. They had these Ouija Fridays and they\u2019d come over and drink wine and eat cheese and \u2018conjure the spirits.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>\u201cReally? Do you have any information on the other girls, Mr. Dillard?\u201d Kelsey asked.</p><p>\u201cBijou went to Europe before Linsey left,\u201d Dillard said, \u201cand I don\u2019t know her last name, or even if that was her real first name. I can get you a number for Dottie Hicks. She\u2019s still in town. In fact, she bought one of the tea-reading places down in the Quarter. Give me a minute\u2014I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p><p>Kelsey waited. He returned with a number for Dottie, and when she\u2019d ended the call, Kelsey dialed it. A young woman\u2019s voice answered. \u201cTender Tea Leaves.\u201d</p><p>Kelsey asked to speak with Dottie and found out she already was. Dottie hadn\u2019t heard about Linsey, but although she was dismayed, she wasn\u2019t surprised. \u201cOh! Oh, no! I was afraid of something like this, but I hoped... I mean, when she just disappeared... Oh, no, this is horrible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d Kelsey said. \u201cI spoke with Mr. Dillard. He said you and Linsey and another girl were fond of the Ouija board and that you had parties every Friday night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me close the door.\u201d Dottie was gone for a second and came back. \u201cHonestly, we try to read people rather than leaves. But I don\u2019t want the customers hearing that. Linsey was...well, she wanted it all to be real. She wanted to see the future, and she believed we could contact ghosts. One night, the planchette went flying right off the board and the lights began to flicker. I swear, it\u2019s true.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat ghost were you contacting?\u201d Kelsey asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t remember. A pirate, someone in Lafitte\u2019s crew, or...I don\u2019t remember. But Linsey started thinking she knew things. She was always trying to get me to go to Texas with her\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSan Antonio?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. She wanted to stay at an old inn there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Longhorn?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure. It might have been.\u201d</p><p>Kelsey was on the phone a while longer, making notes. When she hung up, Jane handed her the sketch of the girl Sandy had recognized. \u201cSheryl Higgins. Drifting waitress, pothead and self-proclaimed palm reader. Her last known residence was Houston. She was recognized by the truck driver who gave her a ride out here. He happened to be back in San Antonio and saw this morning\u2019s paper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, Sandy and Ricky were right,\u201d Kelsey said. \u201cDid you say palm reader?\u201d</p> <p>Jane gave her another piece of paper. \u201cTruck driver\u2019s number. His name is Billie Joe Glover. He\u2019s expecting your call, and he\u2019ll come in if we wish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d Kelsey made her next call. Billie Joe was shocked to hear about Sherry. She\u2019d been cheerful, he said, even if she didn\u2019t seem to have a lick of common sense.</p><p>\u201cShe told me she could sling hash, and if you could sling hash and pop the top on a beer, you could work anywhere in the country. She sang while we were driving, and she had a right pretty voice. Real sweet girl. I\u2019d look for her every now and then when I came back to San Antonio\u2014but hell, I didn\u2019t know she was missing. She just wanted to travel and see the sights. And she wanted to live near the Alamo. It called to her, that\u2019s what she told me.\u201d</p><p>Jake Mallory arrived as Kelsey hung up after talking with Billie Joe, the trucker. Jake had flown back to the D.C. area, but returned when Jackson called him. He was ready to pitch in by manning the phones and interviewing anyone who claimed to have information.</p><p>Impulsively, Kelsey stood. \u201cJake, here\u2019s the chart, my notes, the old information and the new information. I\u2019ll be back soon.\u201d</p><p>She smiled at the others and headed out, not sure why she didn\u2019t want to say that she was going back to the Longhorn.</p><p>She simply felt the urge to return to Room 207.</p><p>They\u2019d wondered if the murdered women had some kind of belief in the paranormal. And so far, they were learning that their now-identified victims did. Linsey\u2019s planchette had flown when she\u2019d been trying to contact a pirate who\u2019d sailed with Lafitte. That was where the story of the Galveston diamond had begun\u2014with pirates. Of course, trying to contact a pirate didn\u2019t necessarily connect to the diamond showing up in San Antonio, but it might. The legend wasn\u2019t discussed in history books, but it was certainly well-known.</p><p>Kelsey considered the facts they\u2019d already accumulated.</p><p>The women had died at different times, and so far, they did have an interest in the occult and in the Alamo. They\u2019d been drugged, and although the highest percentage of what they\u2019d been given was a painkiller, it had also included a \u201croofie,\u201d a drug that made them pliable, a date-rape drug. It was also a drug under the influence of which they might have said or done anything.</p><p>Logan was on the right track; she was sure of it. The killer was looking for the Galveston diamond. His killing wasn\u2019t as random as it seemed. He was luring women to a place where he could drug and seize them.</p><p>He wanted them to contact Rose Langley in the spirit world and have her tell them what she\u2019d done with the Galveston diamond.</p><p>Kelsey asked the desk sergeant for a car. She drove back to the inn and entered through the main doors, since there was really no way to slip up to any of the rooms. Sandy had told her once that outlaws had shimmied down the drainage pipes and leaped to the trees from the windows, but she didn\u2019t think that would work so well today. Most of the trees were gone, and the drainage pipes were made of far cheaper and more fragile material.</p><p>When she came inside, the place was quiet. The lunch crowd had left, and it was too early for the cocktail group. Ricky was behind the bar wiping glasses, and Corey Simmons, looking worn and groggy, sat on a bar stool.</p><p>He swung around when she entered. \u201cWell, if it isn\u2019t the beautiful Marshal. Welcome, ma\u2019am, yes, welcome. Did you come back to have a drink with me? How\u2019d you lose the long, tall Texas Ranger? Doesn\u2019t matter. Good riddance.\u201d</p><p>He was drunk, she quickly ascertained, and it looked like too much alcohol brought out a nasty streak.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing back here, Corey?\u201d</p><p>He scowled. \u201cI lost. What do you think? I lost\u2014and it\u2019s your fault!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCorey, if you lost, it was because you decided to stay out drinking all night,\u201d Kelsey told him calmly. \u201cIt\u2019s not my fault you didn\u2019t get to bed until after three!\u201d</p><p>He wagged a finger at her. \u201cIt was past three-thirty when I hit the hay. See? It was your fault!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Corey. I don\u2019t think so. I\u2019m sorry\u2014are you out of the competition altogether?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he admitted. \u201cI\u2019m still in the bull riding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s good. Sober up and get some sleep, and you\u2019ll do fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, fine. But why don\u2019t you come and have a drink with me first?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I have to get back to work. I just have to grab a few things from my room,\u201d Kelsey said.</p><p>\u201cOne drink?\u201d he wheedled. \u201cJust one\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCorey,\u201d Ricky broke in, walking over to him. \u201cKelsey is working on murder cases. Leave her alone, okay?\u201d</p><p>Corey raised his beer mug. \u201cOh, yeah. She thinks I\u2019m a murderer. But I\u2019m not, and she knows it now, don\u2019t you, Kelsey? Word\u2019s out that they identy-fied one of those girls, and it was the husband that done it, and he\u2019s one of those actor types. He was probably a sicko right from the get-go. Her murder case is solved, even if Kelsey and that loco Ranger wanted to make me out to be the killer. One drink. Come on, please?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you should start worrying about the bull. I\u2019m not having a drink, Corey, thank you,\u201d she said, her words polite but firm. She hurried on up the stairs and felt his eyes following her all the way. A chill raced down her spine. This time, however, she didn\u2019t have to wonder about the reason for it. Corey Simmons was angry with her.</p><p>She ignored him and closed the door to her room. She looked around, but everything seemed perfectly normal. Setting down her purse, she sat on the bed. Logan had found her in the corner of the room, staring at it. She\u2019d been sleepwalking; she\u2019d never done anything like that before.</p><p>But she wasn\u2019t afraid of ghosts. She needed to stop, and wait, let her mind go, and hope they\u2019d come to her, not in her dreams but now, when she was awake. When she could understand.</p><p>From below, she heard the distant noise of the door opening and closing, and the occasional clicking of glass against glass. Someone had come in to play the old piano, and she could hear the soft and plaintive strains.</p><p>The drapes lifted in the false breeze of the air conditioner. Dust motes drifted on the air.</p><p>After a while, she lay down on the bed. She closed her eyes, then opened them; she was overtired and didn\u2019t want to fall asleep. But her eyes fell shut again. She forced them open, and this time, when she did, she saw the shadow in the corner. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A young woman. She wore a pretty nightgown, and her hair was tied back at her neck with a ribbon.</p><p>Sierra Monte.</p><p>\u201cHelp me,\u201d she said plaintively.</p> <p>Kelsey rose to go to her. She moved slowly, afraid the apparition would vanish if she moved too fast.</p><p>As she came closer, she saw that a second shadow was joining the first.</p><p>Kelsey paused. Those who were decent in life, she told herself, would be decent in death. But what about those who hadn\u2019t been so decent?</p><p>Be careful!</p><p>She didn\u2019t know if she spoke the words out loud or in her mind. For a moment, she was seized with fear\u2014fear that she\u2019d come back to urge something evil out of hiding.</p> <p>But Sierra turned slightly and smiled. The second shadow behind her began to take shape, and Kelsey saw that it was the woman she knew from the scene replayed before her twice\u2014it was Rose Langley.</p><p>The women had come to her together.</p><p>\u201cTell me what I can do,\u201d Kelsey begged. \u201cWe\u2019re trying, I swear, we\u2019re trying. Can you help us? We need your help, don\u2019t you see?\u201d</p><p>Rose set a gentle hand on Sierra\u2019s shoulder. \u201cIt\u2019s the stone,\u201d she said. \u201cThey always want the stone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is the stone?\u201d Kelsey asked.</p><p>\u201cI...don\u2019t know,\u201d Rose said. \u201cBut it was cursed. They said it was cursed. And so it was, and so it is today.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSierra, did you find the stone?\u201d Kelsey asked next.</p><p>\u201cThey thought I could.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cIt was my fault. I pretended I knew so much, that I could reach out and touch the dead. And now, I am the dead.\u201d Her melodic, thin-as-air voice seemed to break.</p><p>\u201cWho, Sierra, who?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know! I remember sleeping, but I don\u2019t remember waking... . I don\u2019t even remember dying.\u201d</p><p>Like the others, she\u2019d been drugged.</p><p>\u201cI will help you, I swear. I\u2019ll do anything I can,\u201d Kelsey promised.</p><p>\u201cNo...no...you mustn\u2019t! They know about you. They\u2019ll slip in when you\u2019re sleeping. They\u2019ll come, and you won\u2019t remember. If you can\u2019t find the stone, you\u2019ll fail them, and you won\u2019t remember what you said or how you died, and you\u2019ll wake up and you\u2019ll be with us.\u201d</p><p>There was a sudden, loud knock at her door. Kelsey jumped; her apparitions vanished not in a flurry of wings, but as if they\u2019d never been.</p> <p>\u201cKelsey? Kelsey! Are you all right?\u201d</p><p>It was Sandy. Kelsey cursed her bad luck or her foolishness. She should\u2019ve tracked down Sandy, told her she was there, explained that she was working.</p><p>She gritted her teeth, not wanting to look angry when she opened the door. She managed a smile.</p><p>Sandy stared at her for a minute. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but Ricky just told me Corey was being a pest and you ran up here. You\u2019re not usually back in the middle of the day, and there\u2019s so much going on... . I was just worried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s sweet of you, Sandy. But I\u2019m fine. I had a few things to do that I needed a bit of privacy to accomplish, so I came back here and holed up.\u201d</p><p>Sandy still looked worried, and Kelsey gave her a hug. \u201cI swear, I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, then. I\u2019ll leave you to your own devices.\u201d</p><p>As Sandy backed away from the door, Kelsey called out, \u201cOh, Sandy, thank you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou helped us tremendously. We identified at least one of the girls with information from you and Ricky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great,\u201d Sandy said, then sighed loudly. \u201cOh, Kelsey! Why couldn\u2019t you have been a runway model? Then I wouldn\u2019t have had to worry about you all the time.\u201d</p><p>Kelsey laughed. \u201cFor one thing, I\u2019m not that thin. For another\u2014well, then you\u2019d really have to worry about me. I\u2019m a klutz, and if they\u2019d put me in high heels, I\u2019d have broken my neck on the runway. So, kid, I\u2019m fine, I swear it!\u201d</p><p>Sandy nodded and started to go, but came rushing back, obviously flustered. \u201cKelsey, he\u2019s down there!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHim, him! That hunk-a-hunk Jeff Chasson!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, go and play hostess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe came back here!\u201d Sandy said in awe.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the best-looking innkeep in town. Go on! Buy him a drink!\u201d</p><p>Kelsey finally got Sandy to go downstairs. She looked around the room, but whatever momentum she\u2019d found was gone.</p><p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t we figure out how to do dial-a-ghost?\u201d she muttered to herself.</p><p>She sat on the bed again, gazing at the corner. A moment later, she stood and walked over to the wall, then went out to the hallway and studied the rooms and the doors. It didn\u2019t tell her anything. She came back in, staring at the wall again. The longer she did, the more convinced she became that she was right.</p><p>Now she had a plan.</p><p>And now, all she had to do was work out how to implement it.</p><p>Ned Bixby cried when they showed him the photo of his deceased wife. He laid his head on his arms and cried.</p><p>He was oblivious to the other women; he barely glanced at the photographs of the dead.</p><p>But he cried hard tears over his wife.</p><p>Despite that, Jackson and Logan took turns questioning him. He didn\u2019t want a lawyer. No matter what they said, he denied killing his wife.</p><p>Jackson spoke very softly to him. \u201cNed, you\u2019ve got to help us out. We\u2019re looking at a series of killings here. All the bodies were found in similar condition\u2014decomposed, as you can see. I want things to go easy for you, but this is murder. They\u2019ll search your house, Ned. They have probable cause because of what witnesses have said about your marriage, because you claimed that your wife had gone to New Mexico when it turned out she was dead. They\u2019ll connect all the killings to you, and this is Texas, Ned. There\u2019s a death penalty in this state.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t kill those women,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cJust your wife?\u201d Logan asked him.</p><p>\u201cNo, no!\u201d he shouted.</p><p>\u201cTell us something to give the district attorney,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cWe don\u2019t quite understand what\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t kill my wife or anyone!\u201d Ned exploded before Jackson could finish.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re guilty,\u201d Logan began. \u201cWe\u2014\u201d</p><p>Ned went very still. He wiped his eyes and cheeks, and stared at them. \u201cI deserve to die,\u201d he said suddenly.</p><p>\u201cNed, we need to know what happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was me! I did it. I killed them. I killed them all,\u201d he burst out. \u201cNow I\u2019m done. Arrest me. And I want an attorney.\u201d</p><p>Ten minutes later, Ned Bixby was arraigned. Now, they had to wait until he had an attorney before they could talk to him again, although a search warrant was being issued for his house and car. Logan reminded the D.A. that the document had to be carefully worded; they didn\u2019t want to discover that Ned Bixby had a toolshed or other extra building that, if not included, couldn\u2019t be searched. They were looking specifically for a knife and for drugs and drug paraphernalia and, Logan added, for any reference to the Alamo, the Longhorn Saloon or the Galveston diamond.</p><p>The D.A. listened to Logan and then sighed. \u201cHalf the people in Texas and ninety percent of San Antonio have books that refer to the Alamo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll weed through it all,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cPlease. It\u2019s important.\u201d</p><p>At last, the two of them returned to the task force office. Jake, Jane and Kat were there, taking calls and making notes.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Kelsey?\u201d Logan asked, concerned.</p><p>Jane raised her head from a file she\u2019d been attaching notes to. \u201cShe left. Actually, a while ago now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t say where she was going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but she sounded like she wouldn\u2019t be long,\u201d Jake said. He frowned. \u201cSorry, this place is a madhouse. We\u2019ve got a bunch of calls from palm readers who want to visit the corpses and touch their hands.\u201d</p><p>Nodding, Logan tried to appear calm as he slid his cell phone from his pocket.</p><p>What was it with the woman?</p><p>Still, she had a firearm and was trained to use it. She knew what she was doing.</p><p>He was almost certain that she wasn\u2019t going to answer her phone.</p><p>But she did.</p><p>\u201cO\u2019Brien.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKelsey, where the hell are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m at the Longhorn. Logan, can you come here?\u201d</p><p>She was speaking in a hushed voice.</p><p>\u201cYou never came back to the station. Kelsey, we picked up Cynthia Bixby\u2019s husband. He confessed to all the murders.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you believe him?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he admitted.</p><p>\u201cI know I should be there, but...can you come here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Logan closed his phone. \u201cShe\u2019s at the Longhorn and she asked me to meet her there,\u201d he told Jackson. \u201cI\u2019ll call in.\u201d</p><p>As he started out, Kat called him back.</p><p>\u201cLogan, she was talking to friends of our victims. You should know that Linsey Applewood was big into the occult. Kelsey also talked to the truck driver who drove Sheryl Higgins to San Antonio. Apparently, she made spare money as a palm reader.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Logan said.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re still weeding through tips,\u201d Jake assured him.</p><p>Logan thanked him, then headed out. He was tempted to run his siren, but he didn\u2019t allow himself to do it.</p><p>Help me, help them, help her.</p><p>He\u2019d just talked to Kelsey on the phone, and she was fine.</p><p>The saloon had filled up when he arrived. Cowboys crowded the bar stools and the tables. He noted that Ted Murphy was there and that the film crew had returned. Absent was Corey Simmons.</p><p>He made his way to the bar, where Bernie Firestone hailed him. \u201cYou have one of my actors,\u201d he said glumly.</p><p>\u201cHis wife is among the dead, I\u2019m afraid,\u201d Logan said.</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t kill her, I\u2019m sure of it. Ah, well, thank God I\u2019m not the producer on this thing. I can take a day or two to drink away my frustration!\u201d Bernie lifted his glass. \u201cJoin me?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMaybe in a bit.\u201d</p><p>Murphy was behaving himself, eyeing Logan but not talking and not trying to entice him into a drink, either.</p><p>Ricky, rushing about with a tray of filled glasses, finally noticed him.</p> <p>\u201cHey, Logan. You look like you need a cool one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, but I\u2019m looking for Kelsey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s in her room.\u201d</p><p>He started to leave, then hesitated. \u201cWhere\u2019s Corey Simmons? Doesn\u2019t he usually hang out here around this time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was going to pass out,\u201d Ricky said. \u201cI convinced him to go to bed.\u201d</p> <p>Logan dashed up the stairs. As he reached the gallery, his heart quickened when he heard a sharp cry from the area of Kelsey\u2019s room.</p><p>Room 207.</p><p>And Corey Simmons was up here, too.</p><p>He ran the rest of the way to her room and tried the door. It was locked. He stepped back to slam his shoulder against it to break in. As he did, Kelsey opened the door. She was covered with white dust, but she stepped back quickly, letting him in.</p><p>He looked around the room. Plaster dust was everywhere; part of the wall had been torn out.</p><p>Logan turned back to Kelsey. She gave him a wistful smile of both triumph and sadness. \u201cI\u2019ve found Sierra Monte,\u201d she said quietly, and pointed to the gaping hole in the wall.</p> <p>Chapter Fourteen</p><p>Kelsey took Logan over to the wall she\u2019d begun to dismantle and the corpse that had been lodged there.</p><p>Tearing the wall apart hadn\u2019t been easy.</p><p>Using only her pocketknife, she\u2019d systematically cut through the drywall and old lathing. She\u2019d done her best to keep the damage down, knowing that this was her friend\u2019s place of business, and yet she\u2019d been absolutely convinced the woman\u2019s ghost clung to that area for a reason.</p><p>Logan closed the door and locked it.</p><p>\u201cDid you just cry out?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, I didn\u2019t mean to, but when I found the body...\u201d</p><p>He leaned against the door, giving her a chance to explain.</p> <p>\u201cI know it looks crazy, but the logic is really simple. Think about it. The blood had been all over the room, nowhere else. Sierra Monte was definitely killed here, but the team working the case believed the body had been taken elsewhere because she wasn\u2019t here. The inn was being renovated at the time. Most of the rooms had just been redone, so no one would notice this particular section of wall... . And while Sandy would\u2019ve repainted, there was no reason for her to dig into walls that had recently been repaired when she had so much else to work on. It\u2019s all logical,\u201d Kelsey insisted.</p><p>He was watching her, his expression skeptical.</p><p>She sighed. \u201cOkay, screw logic. The shadow on the film was in this area, and today I saw them, Logan. I saw them both. Sierra and Rose. They were hovering in this corner.\u201d</p><p>Logan walked toward her, still silent. He came to stand directly in front of her, and then he reached down, planting an enormous kiss on her lips.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re brilliant!\u201d he told her.</p><p>She smiled. \u201cAnd now you\u2019re covered in plaster, too. I\u2019ve got a disaster going here, but I didn\u2019t want to make too much noise and I didn\u2019t want to ask Sandy\u2019s permission... . We have to call in forensics, though. I\u2019m not sure of my sanity in this\u2014Sandy has so much to deal with right now\u2014but this is a murdered woman, someone who was flesh and blood.\u201d</p><p>Logan pulled out his phone. \u201cI\u2019m calling Jackson. He\u2019ll do this from the FBI end, and he can bring in Kat and he\u2019ll let me call the shots on the crime scene, though God knows we never seem to get anything from the bodies. Still, there\u2019s always that one time a killer makes a mistake, and we could get a hair or a fiber or something. Maybe even DNA that matches DNA in the system.\u201d</p><p>As he spoke to Jackson Crow, he inspected the wall she\u2019d dug out, using nothing but that small knife. She\u2019d ripped through drywall and lathe, slowly and methodically. It had been worth it.</p><p>Within twenty minutes, Jackson Crow had arrived with Kat Sokolov. He inspected Kelsey\u2019s finding, as well, and stood silently for a few minutes, considering the situation. \u201cWe need crime-scene people here,\u201d he said flatly.</p><p>\u201cI need her out of the wall,\u201d Kat told them.</p><p>\u201cBut Ted Murphy is down there, not to mention the fact that the place is jumping,\u201d Kelsey said.</p><p>\u201cMurphy is going to be a sensationalist no matter what we do.\u201d Logan shrugged. \u201cNothing\u2019s going to change that. Kelsey, do you want to tell Sandy what you found? We don\u2019t have to clear the bar\u2014there\u2019s no point. But we have to have our people in here. We can rope off the upstairs, and only overnight guests can have access to the gallery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do we tell the customers down there?\u201d Kelsey asked.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d Logan said wearily, wiping plaster dust from his cheek. \u201cWe\u2019ll get a spokesperson on it. Other than that, they can guess all they want.\u201d</p><p>Kelsey walked over to the door.</p><p>\u201cKelsey.\u201d Logan stopped her.</p><p>He sent her a wry grin. \u201cIf you go downstairs looking like that, people are going to think you\u2019re the ghost of Room 207.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Yes.\u201d Kelsey nodded, and headed into the bathroom. She tried washing her face and shaking out her hair. Kat came in behind her and began patting at her clothes.</p><p>Kelsey studied herself in the mirror. She and Kat seemed to have gotten off most of the paint chips and plaster dust, and she looked more or less presentable. She brushed her hair and put on some fresh makeup, then squared her shoulders.</p><p>\u201cReady.\u201d</p><p>It was with an almost unbearable pain in her heart that she went down and sought out Sandy. She was going to tell the friend who\u2019d given her hospitality that she might be about to destroy not just her business but her dream. However, the Longhorn had survived before. It would do so again.</p><p>She saw Ted Murphy, ostensibly chatting with friends at one of the tables. He\u2019d stay away from Logan, she was sure.</p><p>But he watched. He watched all the time.</p><p>She saw Bernie Firestone and Earl Candy at the bar, and they both hailed her with friendly waves. She waved back, but kept searching the crowd for Sandy.</p><p>She found her sitting, enthralled, with Jeff Chasson.</p><p>Kelsey wondered why she felt so protective of her. Sandy was very pretty, and there was no reason she couldn\u2019t attract the sexiest man in any crowd. But Kelsey didn\u2019t believe that anything about Jeff Chasson was real. Why he would want more information on the grisly doings at the Longhorn, she didn\u2019t know. But she felt he was a worm, trying to wriggle his way into something.</p><p>And now, of course, he was there when she needed to speak with Sandy alone. As she walked over to the table, Chasson looked up at her and stood, offering her a strange smile. She had the feeling that he was always on the lookout for whatever he might be able to use. Or another conquest, perhaps...</p><p>\u201cMarshal O\u2019Brien. Have a drink with us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d Kelsey replied. \u201cBut I\u2019ve come to steal Sandy away from you for a few minutes. Sandy, please?\u201d</p><p>Sandy frowned at her. \u201cKelsey, Jeff and I were sharing some experiences. Can\u2019t you just talk to us both?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI really need to speak with you alone,\u201d Kelsey said.</p><p>Sandy got to her feet, giving Kelsey a look of confused anger.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d Kelsey murmured.</p><p>As she gripped Sandy\u2019s arm to lead her toward the stairs, Sandy pulled back. \u201cWhat are you doing to me? He\u2019s the best possibility I\u2019ve had of sex with anything decent in, like, forever!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSandy, you have to give me a minute.\u201d</p><p>But Sandy wrenched her arm away. \u201cWhat? What? I know your work\u2019s all-important, and that you\u2019re big-shot law stuff but, Kelsey, come on! We lower mortals need lives, too!\u201d</p><p>That startled Kelsey and angered her. \u201cSandy, I found Sierra Monte!\u201d she snapped.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Sandy\u2019s cry and the white look of pure horror on her face made Kelsey feel instantly sorry and apologetic that she\u2019d blurted out the words.</p><p>\u201cShe was in the wall,\u201d Kelsey said.</p><p>\u201cYou...you...found her? In the wall? My wall?\u201d Sandy asked. \u201cNo, oh, no. No, no, no. Not all this again. Oh, my God. Oh, Lord.\u201d</p><p>Kelsey was afraid Sandy was going to faint. But when she tried to help her, Sandy shook her off and stood on her own. \u201cWhy?\u201d she asked, and it sounded as if she was going to cry. \u201cWhy were you digging in my wall?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was logical, Sandy, and she was there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know for sure she was dead...and if I didn\u2019t know, I didn\u2019t have to care. Oh, Kelsey!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSandy, please! The girl was brutally murdered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, and I\u2019m sorry, and...and now\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to handle it as carefully as possible. All we have to do is block off the gallery, so our crime-scene people can make it through. We have to get her out of the wall, Sandy.\u201d</p><p>Sandy stared at her blankly.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to clear out the bar, and you don\u2019t have to do anything tonight. I\u2019ll bring them in discreetly. Overnight guests will still be able to get to their rooms,\u201d Kelsey said quickly.</p><p>Sandy seemed to be letting it all sink in. \u201cNo. No. I\u2019ll take care of this. You go ahead and call the people you have to call.\u201d</p><p>Sandy escaped her and headed for the bar. She crawled up on one of the stools with the help of the surprised cowboy she\u2019d rather rudely unseated.</p><p>\u201cEveryone, please!\u201d she shouted.</p><p>The piano player stopped playing. People were still talking, but Sandy raised her voice and shouted again. \u201cPlease! I have a very important announcement!\u201d</p><p>At last, the room went silent.</p><p>Sandy pointed toward Kelsey. \u201cMy very good friend Marshal Kelsey O\u2019Brien has done the Longhorn, and the city of San Antonio, a great service. God knows how she figured it out, but Kelsey has just solved a mystery that\u2019s plagued our city\u2019s finest\u2014she\u2019s discovered the remains of Sierra Monte, the young lady who disappeared from Room 207 about a year ago. And she found her right in Room 207.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A shocked murmur rose and grew louder; everyone looked over at her.</p><p>\u201cMy God!\u201d someone shouted. Ted Murphy, of course.</p><p>\u201cBut!\u201d Sandy roared above the crowd, quieting it again. \u201cI\u2019ve been informed that we don\u2019t need to close down. Forensics people are coming. We need to give them free passage and easy access to the stairs, so no one up in the gallery, okay? Unless you\u2019re a guest and you want to go to bed. I don\u2019t know anything more at this time, and I don\u2019t think even Marshal O\u2019Brien does. I beg you, however, to stay, to drink, to play. Tragedy struck the Longhorn\u2014that\u2019s something we already knew. But the saloon is still an incredible piece of history, as is our beloved Alamo. Thank you, my friends.\u201d</p> <p>Sandy accepted the cowboy\u2019s help in stepping down from the bar stool. She stared across at Kelsey, and with a nod of thanks, Kelsey hurried back up the stairs.</p><p>The forensics people were going to be at it through the night, surveying the wall and determining how best to remove the corpse. Kat planned to stay and supervise, and after a while, it seemed that there was nothing left for Kelsey to do but leave.</p><p>Logan told her, \u201cPack up a few things. There\u2019s no sleeping here tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know this puts Sandy in a bad position,\u201d she said, \u201cbut there was nothing I could do. I still feel as if I pushed her right over the edge. Ted Murphy is downstairs. It\u2019ll take a crane to get him out of the place. It\u2019s like death has become a spectator sport.\u201d</p><p>Logan mulled that over. Sadly, throughout history, death sometimes had been a spectator sport.</p> <p>\u201cKelsey, you did the right thing. You realized Sierra had to be in the wall. You dug her out. What else could you do?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cThis turns everything around. Now we have to find the previous owner, and we have to find everyone who worked here at the time.\u201d</p><p>Kat walked over to them and said, \u201cThe previous owner is dead. There was an article about him\u2014written by none other than Ted Murphy\u2014several months ago. The guy was elderly and he lived in Austin, where he died of some kind of flu. He didn\u2019t spend much time at the Longhorn to begin with, and he would\u2019ve been questioned back then, so whatever he had to say will be in the police reports. But he wasn\u2019t here when the blood was discovered by one of the maids. He was in Austin. He\u2019d been there for weeks before it happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSandy will know who was working here,\u201d Kelsey said. She turned to Logan. \u201cI\u2019m really tired,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>He didn\u2019t put an arm around her the way he wanted to; they were in a professional situation. But he wanted to get away from this place as fast as he could. With Kelsey.</p><p>And he was going to be the head of this unit?</p> <p>Maybe unit was the key word. People who worked together, who had one another\u2019s backs. Because, before he could ponder the situation, Kat spoke up.</p><p>\u201cYou two get out of here tonight,\u201d she said. \u201cI have this covered. Go to your house and get some sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d he said gratefully.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the one whose job it is to deal with the mortal remains.\u201d She laid a reassuring hand on his arm. \u201cYou have to catch the living who commit the crimes.\u201d</p><p>He smiled at her and took Kelsey\u2019s hand, and he no longer cared who saw him. \u201cCome on,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re leaving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019m ready to exit by the fire escape.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, come on, tough girl. I know you can handle it.\u201d</p><p>And, of course, she did. They went downstairs, and when people crowded around them, Kelsey was the perfect professional.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to say,\u201d she explained. \u201cRemember, we assume it\u2019s the body of Sierra Monte. We won\u2019t know any more until the medical examiner has examined the remains, and that won\u2019t be for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy wasn\u2019t that body found before?\u201d Ted Murphy demanded.</p><p>\u201cI guess no one looked in the wall,\u201d Kelsey said coldly. \u201cAnd beyond that, Mr. Murphy, I have no idea. I\u2019m just in from Florida. And, as we all know, this is Texas!\u201d</p><p>Murphy was going to question her again. But, somehow, the man no longer ignited Logan\u2019s temper as he had earlier.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing else to tell anyone tonight. Please have some respect!\u201d he said loudly. \u201cThis was a living person who died tragically. Please give the people working for the state and the country time to get in there and do their jobs.\u201d</p><p>He walked through the crowd, drawing Kelsey along with him.</p><p>They were in the car before she turned to him and said, \u201cWhat the hell is wrong with people? With all of us? Why isn\u2019t there more concern about the fact that someone died?\u201d</p><p>He was quiet for a minute. \u201cI don\u2019t think the issue is that people don\u2019t care. We\u2019re all horrified to hear about an earthquake or some other disaster that killed thousands. But we can\u2019t help taking it more personally when someone close to us dies. Besides, the news media told everyone a year ago that Sierra Monte had to be dead. So, our mutual grief over a young woman who had her life cut short has already been felt. Now, it\u2019s more of a curiosity.\u201d</p><p>Kelsey sat back. \u201cI think I care too much,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cIf you didn\u2019t, you wouldn\u2019t be who you are, and you wouldn\u2019t be so good at what you do.\u201d</p><p>She looked at him and smiled slowly. \u201cThank you. I just feel bad that I betrayed a friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKelsey, I\u2019m sorry, but murder takes precedence, and Sandy will have to realize that. Besides, it didn\u2019t appear that we harmed her business any.\u201d</p><p>She seemed to agree with that.</p><p>When they reached his house, he suggested she might need food, but she said she wasn\u2019t interested. He poured her a glass of wine, and she drank it, and afterward, she walked into the bedroom. He left her alone until his own sense of exhaustion took hold. He went in as quietly as he could, doffed his clothes and slid into his side of the bed. A few minutes later, she moved against him; he was surprised.</p><p>When they\u2019d made love, he thought maybe it had been an affirmation of what was good about life, and he was glad to sleep with her through the night. Maybe they were both too tired to dream, or have visions, or nightmares. He remembered holding her, stroking her hair\u2014and then his alarm rang, announcing that it was seven-thirty.</p><p>He rose and showered and dressed, while Kelsey was still deeply asleep. He sat by her and tousled her hair, trying to wake her gently. He was worried; he hadn\u2019t thought she\u2019d be quite so upset by yesterday\u2019s events. Her guilt about Sandy, in particular, seemed to distress her. He hoped she\u2019d gotten over it\u2014or at least forgiven herself.</p><p>She opened her eyes and groaned. \u201cThis was supposed to be vacation time while I decided about taking the job,\u201d she said. She closed her eyes again and opened just one. \u201cYou didn\u2019t happen to make coffee yet, did you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did. But you don\u2019t get any until you\u2019ve had your shower,\u201d he told her.</p><p>That brought her to her feet, pushing him out of the way and flying for the bathroom. He returned to the kitchen; she was soon there, neatly and professional dressed in one of her dark pantsuits.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going? The office?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cWe\u2019ll keep getting information. Ned Bixby confessed to all the murders, but we know he was lying. I don\u2019t think he murdered his wife\u2014that\u2019s in his mind. He believes it\u2019s his fault she\u2019s dead and he wants to be punished.\u201d</p><p>Kelsey got cream from the refrigerator for their coffee. \u201cBut...I thought you agreed the drowning victim\u2014Cynthia Bixby\u2014was the victim of a different killer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen we learned who she was and what her marriage had been like, I wanted to believe we\u2019d found the killer. But when we sat with Bixby... Kelsey, he cried so hard over the pictures of his wife. I just don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think he killed her in a fit of passion and anger? Or that maybe he is crazy and did kill the others?\u201d</p><p>Logan shook his head. \u201cI just don\u2019t feel it,\u201d he said.</p><p>Kelsey hesitated, running her fingers over the rim of her coffee cup. \u201cLogan, I went back to the Longhorn yesterday because I\u2019d talked to various people who helped us get IDs on two of the dead women. Both of them thought they had psychic powers. Whether they did or not, we\u2019ll never truly know. But I think you\u2019re right about the diamond. In whatever way this man is managing to drug the women, making them pliable\u2014just as in a date-rape situation. But he doesn\u2019t want to rape anyone. He wants to find someone who\u2019ll communicate with Rose Langley and have her reveal where the Galveston diamond is hidden. But...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRose doesn\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Logan studied her. \u201cYou asked Rose\u2019s spirit, I take it?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI wonder so much about what we see, and what we can\u2019t see. I thought maybe she\u2019d gone on, because what I saw in visions or dreams was what everyone calls a residual haunting. But yesterday, she was there. And what\u2019s...nice, I suppose, is that Rose and Sierra know each other. And maybe they\u2019re in that room together because of the diamond. Or...who knows why Rose is still here? Whether he really died fighting for Texas or not, Matt Meyers is certainly long gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Sierra\u2019s killer isn\u2019t\u2014and men are apparently still prepared to kill for a diamond.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re back to square one,\u201d Kelsey said.</p><p>\u201cNo, we\u2019re not. Now we can safely assume that Sierra was a victim, just like the others. And even as a ghost or spirit or residing soul, she can\u2019t tell us anything because she must have been taken in the same way. The roofie in the drug cocktail keeps the women from remembering. But it does help to know that Sierra obviously met the same fate. Because we can start looking harder and closer at the people who were involved with the Longhorn at the time she died. Okay, not the old owner since he was never around and he\u2019s dead, anyway.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have to bring Sandy in and query her on everything from the day she made her down payment on the place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid so,\u201d Logan said. \u201cLet\u2019s get on in.\u201d</p><p>They\u2019d started the drive to the station, both thoughtful, when Kelsey suddenly turned to him. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we stop at the Alamo for a bit? I want to see if Zachary Chase is around.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAll right,\u201d he said slowly.</p><p>As he parked, he noticed that there was a Ranger car in front of the Longhorn farther down the street.</p><p>Well, maybe Jackson had decided that when the forensic crew had finished, the inn\u2014or the crime scene\u2014was going to be in need of some protection.</p><p>They went to their usual bench. It was early, but already the plaza was busy.</p><p>\u201cI wonder if Zachary will expect us at this hour,\u201d Logan said.</p> <p>He needn\u2019t have worried. They\u2019d only been there a few minutes when Kelsey nudged him. He saw Zachary excusing himself, unheard, as he made his way through a sea of tourists.</p><p>Kelsey and Logan moved apart, as they usually did, so Zachary could sit between them.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m surprised to see you two,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m sorry, but I have nothing to tell you. I suppose that\u2019s good?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually,\u201d Kelsey began, \u201cI\u2019ve come to tell you something. Rose is still here.\u201d</p><p>Zachary Chase was silent. There was hope on his face, and sorrow. \u201cMy poor Rose. Her life became so wretched, and now she lingers in death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe she needs a friend,\u201d Kelsey said.</p> <p>Zachary was silent again, and neither of them broke the silence. Then he turned to Kelsey, puzzled. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just ask Rose about the diamond? If the wretched gem is found, then\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t know where it is, Zachary. She died\u2014and it disappeared,\u201d Kelsey told him.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s terrible, isn\u2019t it?\u201d he mused. \u201cThat people could kill, and die, for a stone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA stone, a hunk of glittering rock...greed,\u201d Logan said. \u201cZachary, none of this is your fault, and what happened at the Alamo certainly wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps I\u2019ve been waiting... .\u201d Zachary shrugged. \u201cCould you... Maybe you could suggest to Rose, if you see her, that she take a stroll. That she walk by the Alamo. That she...well, perhaps you could tell her I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>Kelsey smiled. \u201cThe Longhorn welcomes guests, Zachary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it can\u2019t hold good memories for her,\u201d he said, his voice hoarse. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be part of the memories she must have of being used and sold...and murdered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see what I can do,\u201d Kelsey promised him.</p> <p>\u201cAnd I am ever vigilant,\u201d he promised in return.</p><p>Logan rose. \u201cWe\u2019d better get going,\u201d he said to Kelsey. Zachary got up when she did, and he gave a slight bow.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll remain vigilant,\u201d he vowed.</p><p>They watched as he walked away and disappeared into the crowd. Then they headed for Logan\u2019s car. Kelsey paused, looking at the Longhorn down the street and the vehicle parked in front of it.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a Ranger car,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it a friend?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He grinned. \u201cThere aren\u2019t that many of us, so most likely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you arrange it?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cNo, I assume Jackson did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust one car,\u201d she murmured. \u201cOne Ranger?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess you haven\u2019t heard all our stories,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the early 1900s, the mayor of Dallas called on the Rangers because he was about to deal with an angry mob. When Ranger Captain W. J. McDonald stepped off the train, the mayor asked him, \u2018Where are the others?\u2019 To which McDonald replied, \u2018One riot, one Ranger,\u2019 or words to that effect. Trust me, Kelsey. One Ranger can keep a curious crowd from making Sandy crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSandy is going to be crazy, no matter what,\u201d Kelsey said. \u201cTrust me.\u201d</p><p>He sighed, climbed into the car and revved the engine, then drove to the station. An exhausted Kat Sokolov was just leaving.</p><p>\u201cI brought my findings in,\u201d she said. \u201cThe body was little more than a skeleton. There was some soft tissue left, but because of the situation, it became almost mummified. She was stabbed to death\u2014no surprise there. I was able to tell she\u2019d also been drugged, with the same cocktail used on the others. What I haven\u2019t been able to find yet is any puncture mark on any of the victims. Not even Vanessa Johnston. I don\u2019t know how this man is managing to get the drugs into their systems. Possibly a patch, as I mentioned before, but...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll figure it out,\u201d Logan said. \u201cNow it\u2019s your turn to get some rest.\u201d</p><p>She nodded and smiled wearily.</p><p>Sean was in the office when they arrived, working industriously at a computer. \u201cWe\u2019ve got you for the day?\u201d Kelsey asked him.</p><p>\u201cWork on the documentary has been suspended.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hadn\u2019t realized Ned Bixby had that big a role in it. He doesn\u2019t really look like a Mexican,\u201d Logan said.</p><p>Sean raised one shoulder in a shrug. \u201cHe was playing a bunch of different roles. Word just came down from the producer, perhaps out of respect for the situation, that we\u2019d resume next week.\u201d He looked at them both for a moment. \u201cI think I\u2019ve found something you\u2019ll want to see.\u201d</p><p>Logan and Kelsey walked around to stand behind him. Sean had a series of emails up on the screen.</p><p>\u201cThis showed up at eight,\u201d he said, indicating the computer. \u201cIt belonged to Linsey Applewood, and her landlord had it in storage. I hacked her code and brought up her emails. She was corresponding with someone called Mr.Alamo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you able to trace it back to a name?\u201d Logan asked.</p><p>Sean\u2019s expression was sheepish. \u201cIf I\u2019d traced a name, I\u2019d be dancing a jig. No, no name, but I did find out that the emails were all coming and going from an internet caf\u00e9 a few blocks from the Longhorn. The thing is, you need to read the email correspondence.\u201d</p><p>Sean stood and allowed Logan to take his place. \u201cGo to the first one. They start about two years ago, and become more...evocative, I guess you could say.\u201d</p><p>Linsey Applewood\u2019s screen name had been seeitgirl. The first email had been sent by Mr. Alamo.</p><p>Hey. Heard you have a gift. I have a gift. Maybe we could get together and explore options.</p><p>Seeitgirl had written back:</p><p>I\u2019m the real deal. I don\u2019t play games.</p><p>Then you should come here. The area is full of legends, mysteries\u2014and riches.</p><p>More emails followed in a teasing vein, including some that questioned seeitgirl\u2019s abilities.</p><p>I talk to the dead, she\u2019d written at last.</p><p>And Mr.Alamo had responded:</p><p>That\u2019s what is needed. Only the dead can tell the tale. When you come, I will prove that I am everything I claim. And then you must prove that you are all that you claim. If so, we can share fame and treasure.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s the internet caf\u00e9?\u201d Logan asked.</p><p>Sean gave him the exact address.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll need to bring photos of the woman,\u201d Logan murmured. \u201cDo we have a list yet of people working at the Longhorn at the time Sierra was murdered?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have what I could pull off IRS logs,\u201d Sean said.</p><p>\u201cI guess being federal is good.\u201d Logan grinned. \u201cVery helpful. But we still need to interview Sandy, see what she remembers about any staff who were there a year ago.\u201d</p><p>He looked at Kelsey. She groaned. \u201cI think that someone other than me should call her right now.\u201d</p><p>Logan nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, wait,\u201d Kelsey said, heading for one of the other desks. \u201cI\u2019ll get her down here. I can\u2019t believe she\u2019s still that upset with me, or that she\u2019ll refuse to help with an ongoing murder investigation.\u201d</p><p>She sat down and dialed the Longhorn. Logan watched as she got an answer, as she waited and then frowned. Finally, she hung up.</p><p>\u201cLogan, Sandy is gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, gone?\u201d</p><p>Kelsey\u2019s face was taut with tension. \u201cI spoke with Ricky. He got the customers out at about four in the morning. He didn\u2019t see Sandy then, but he assumed she\u2019d gone to bed. He went to wake her when she didn\u2019t show up this morning and he found that her bed hadn\u2019t been slept in. Her handbag\u2019s there, none of her clothing is gone, but he can\u2019t find her. Oh, God, Logan, do you think the killer was there last night? That...he\u2019s taken Sandy?\u201d</p><p>Chapter Fifteen</p><p>Kelsey felt dizzy for a moment, worried sick, afraid that her affiliation with the case and her relationship with Sandy might have put her friend at risk. She was going to stand, but she didn\u2019t. She couldn\u2019t allow trembling knees in front of her coworkers. And a U.S. Marshal didn\u2019t burst into tears. Neither did an FBI agent. She had strength. She knew it, and she knew her work. However, she\u2019d had no idea what it would feel like when someone she cared about might be in a deadly position because of her.</p><p>Sean looked at her from behind the computer desk. She saw the concern in his eyes. Logan, too, wore an expression of concern; he moved closer to her. \u201cShe has a crush on Chasson, right? Let\u2019s find out if she went home with him.\u201d He glanced at Sean. \u201cTry to get him on the phone, and try everyone you know until you find him. Sandy\u2019s probably with him, but even if she\u2019s not, we\u2019ll want to question him.\u201d He looked back at Kelsey. \u201cSandy could be walking around the city, just needing a break from the Longhorn. I\u2019m not going to say you shouldn\u2019t worry, but the last day\u2019s been traumatic for her.\u201d</p><p>Kelsey nodded. Before panicking, there were a dozen intelligent avenues she could follow. \u201cUnder normal circumstances, she wouldn\u2019t even be considered missing yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go. While Sean tracks down Jeff Chasson, we\u2019ll start at the Longhorn and try to retrace Sandy\u2019s steps,\u201d Logan said. \u201cMeanwhile, Sean can get a list of addresses for everyone we know was in the saloon last night, and we\u2019ll pay calls on them while we keep trying to reach Sandy. Sean, could you send someone to the evidence locker to see if they had a computer for Sierra Monte? You might check where Sheryl Higgins was last seen, too, and if there\u2019s a possibility she had a computer, iPhone, iPad, whatever. We\u2019ll stay in close contact.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Just as they were leaving, Jackson walked in. Logan briefed him on the latest developments, and Jackson listened gravely, then handed Logan the newspaper he\u2019d been carrying.</p><p>\u201cHave you seen this?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Logan stopped and read the front page. Ted Murphy had been at it again.</p> <p>Missing Dead Woman Found in Walls of Historic Longhorn. Below that, Actor in Custody for Murder. Citizens Question Guilt as Body Count Rises.\u201d</p><p>The article went on to describe the discovery of Sierra Monte\u2019s body as disorganized and chaotic. The team assembled to seek out answers was compared to the Keystone Cops. While the sketches of local artist Jane Everett were helping identify the unknown victims, Texas law enforcement seemed to be working with so-called psychics. Women in San Antonio should bolt their doors. Apparently, the killer was using a drug cocktail, and no one was safe.</p><p>Logan didn\u2019t read the article word for word, but he noticed that Ted Murphy was promising an exclusive interview with accused murder suspect Ned Bixby the next day.</p><p>\u201cI can make sure that doesn\u2019t happen. We can transfer him to a federal facility. Since he says his wife went to New Mexico, I could play the federal card,\u201d Jackson told him.</p><p>\u201cIf Murphy interviews Ned Bixby and gets something from him that we didn\u2019t, it\u2019ll be a good thing,\u201d Logan said. \u201cActually, I\u2019d like to have Ted Murphy brought in for questioning. He has details in this article that we haven\u2019t released.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe can have him brought in, but he\u2019ll be out in a flash. He\u2019ll claim his right as a journalist to protect his sources,\u201d Jackson muttered.</p><p>\u201cWell, we can hold him for twenty-four hours,\u201d Logan said.</p><p>Kelsey was standing silently at his side, and he knew she was anxious to leave. Jackson didn\u2019t delay them any longer.</p><p>Kelsey continued her silence as they drove. He glanced at her and saw the same sick feeling that must have shown in his face three years ago. He reached out a hand for hers. \u201cWe\u2019ll find Sandy,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWe saw a Ranger\u2019s car in front of the inn this morning. If someone was there through the night, how could this have happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRangers don\u2019t tell people what they can and can\u2019t do,\u201d he said patiently. \u201cIf Sandy chose to go somewhere, walk out of the inn, there would\u2019ve been no way he could stop her. Right now, we should think about Jeff Chasson. We both know she was hoping to hook up with him.\u201d</p> <p>Kelsey let out a breath. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s just that every time a woman disappears around here, we seem to find her dead.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t speak again. They got to the Longhorn and quickly parked on the street. As they started to head inside, Logan noticed that the Ranger car parked outside belonged to a good friend of his, Tyler Montague.</p><p>When they walked in, there were only a few stragglers in the saloon. Ricky was sitting at a table with Tyler, who was taking notes. Both men rose when he and Kelsey entered, and Logan set a hand on her back, leading her toward them. As they all sat, he introduced Tyler to Kelsey. Tyler made a perfect Ranger; tall, lean and muscled, he practiced martial arts during his off hours. Even better, he was smart and methodical.</p><p>Ricky was a mess. He looked tired and frantic, dark hair pushed back from his forehead in disarray. His eyes were red-rimmed.</p><p>He tried to smile at Kelsey. \u201cThe morning\u2019s been insane. The news is out about Sierra Monte\u2019s body, there\u2019s all kinds of stuff going on at the rodeo fairgrounds today and people have been rushing in from the street to gawk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRicky, could Sandy have left with Jeff Chasson?\u201d Kelsey asked. She looked over at Tyler Montague. \u201cYou would\u2019ve seen them, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarshal,\u201d Tyler said, \u201cI didn\u2019t arrive until about two this morning, so anything that went on before then, I wouldn\u2019t have seen. Ricky\u2019s been giving me a description of everyone here last night and trying to recall everything that happened, and it doesn\u2019t seem to me that Ms. Holly could\u2019ve been forced out by anyone. There were still a few people when I showed up, and part of what I was told to do was clear the bar. The assumption was that Ms. Holly had been upset and left the cleanup to her staff. We didn\u2019t know she never went to bed until Ricky tried to find her when it was time to start cooking and serving breakfast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t see her leave,\u201d Ricky said. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t see Chasson leave, either,\u201d he said, brightening.</p> <p>\u201cRicky, is her room locked?\u201d Kelsey asked.</p><p>Ricky shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t remember if I locked it or not after Ranger Montague and I went in there. We saw her purse on the dresser...her keys were by it. I checked the closets\u2014it didn\u2019t look like she\u2019d taken anything with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas anyone contacted Chasson yet?\u201d Tyler asked.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re trying from the station,\u201d Logan said.</p><p>Kelsey got up. \u201cI want to go into her room,\u201d she announced.</p><p>\u201cYou know where it is. Right behind the kitchen,\u201d Ricky told her.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Kelsey said.</p><p>As Logan stood with her, Tyler said, \u201cI\u2019ll hang here with Ricky and keep an eye on the place. Special Agent Crow wants someone watching the stairs and the gallery.\u201d</p><p>Logan nodded. He and Kelsey made their way to the kitchen and the room that branched off it.</p><p>\u201cThe kitchen was detached when the Longhorn was built,\u201d she said. \u201cBy the time Sandy bought it, though, the pantry hall had been built to connect the kitchen to the saloon and the smokehouse, which is now Sandy\u2019s room.\u201d</p><p>Logan studied the simple architecture. He noted that there was a private door leading to the grounds in back, which had probably been extensive once. Now, there was only the broad lower porch, some trellises, plants and little fountains. The back of the property was set off from its neighbors by a high whitewashed wooden fence, allowing guests privacy.</p><p>Logan walked to the door that led outside as Kelsey searched the room for any sign of where Sandy might have gone. Ricky hadn\u2019t lied; there was absolutely no evidence of distress. The bed was neatly made, Sandy\u2019s toiletries arranged in an orderly fashion on her dressing table, and there didn\u2019t seem to be a speck of dust on the hardwood floor. As he reached the outer door, Kelsey was peering beneath the bed.</p><p>The lock was just a push-button type that could be locked from either side. Logan stepped out and stood on the rear porch. From here, Sandy could take a pathway straight to the street, or she could turn to her right and go through the gate to the backyard. He looked for footprints, but the porch was swept clean. He headed toward the backyard, entered and glanced around. He saw a pretty little toolshed in the far corner. His eyes followed the lawn to where there was access from a door at the rear of the saloon. It led to the side of the stage.</p><p>As Logan surveyed the area, his phone rang.</p><p>\u201cRaintree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLogan, it\u2019s Sean. So far, we haven\u2019t been able to get hold of Jeff Chasson. He\u2019s not answering his home phone or his cell. I\u2019ve contacted Bernie Firestone and other people associated with the documentary, and they haven\u2019t been able to reach him, either. I had a patrol car go by his house, and his car is parked in front. Should we enter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me the address. I\u2019ll go in,\u201d Logan said. \u201cGet me a warrant while I\u2019m on the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLogan, the woman\u2019s been missing for only a few hours. I think you should hear some kind of noise and go for probable cause.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he proves to be our man, we can\u2019t have evidence thrown out in court.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s such a long shot, Logan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd we\u2019re worried about a woman\u2019s life,\u201d Logan agreed. \u201cAll right. I\u2019m going in.\u201d</p><p>Kelsey knew Logan was watching her, and she started to worry that she\u2019d be taken off the case, since she was personally involved. She had to act like a law enforcement officer and not a terrified relative.</p><p>\u201cWe may get more IDs on the other women today,\u201d she said, both to distract herself and to emphasize her professionalism. \u201cAt first, I thought the killer was going after women who were interested in or knew something about gems. Now, while that may be part of it, we also know he was looking for psychics. That would suggest the killer\u2019s aware that there are people who can really contact the dead, so I\u2019m going to assume we\u2019re adding several aspects to our profile. First, he\u2019s someone who\u2019s local, or frequently local, with a good understanding of the geography, history and legends of the area. And while the business was in transition\u2014before Sandy officially took over\u2014there could have been an endless throng of people in and out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJackson has officers hunting down everyone who worked here,\u201d Logan told her.</p><p>\u201cSo...a local, with an avid interest in history, with access to costumes and to drugs. But drugs are easily available on the street, and still...\u201d She turned to look at him. \u201cIt has to be someone with some basic chemistry in his background to be able to mix up the right cocktail. And administer it. How could you be so focused on a diamond that you\u2019d go through all of that and kill over and over again?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cThe kind of money it would bring in today\u2019s market is astronomical,\u201d he reminded her.</p><p>\u201cBut wouldn\u2019t people out there\u2014dedicated gemologists\u2014know about the diamond?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but come on. You can buy body parts on the black market. Selling a diamond would be nothing.\u201d Logan slowed down. \u201cThat\u2019s Chasson\u2019s house,\u201d he said.</p><p>He pulled up behind a deputy\u2019s car. The two officers who\u2019d been watching the house emerged from it and approached them. They all introduced themselves, then the older officer said, \u201cWe\u2019ve knocked, we\u2019ve banged, we\u2019ve walked all around the house. There\u2019s no response.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLogan!\u201d Kelsey gripped his arm.</p><p>The birds were back. They\u2019d suddenly swooped in, hundreds of them perching atop the roof and the eaves, on utility wires nearby and the garden trellises in front. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI heard a scream,\u201d she told Logan and the two local officers.</p><p>\u201cIt might\u2019ve been those dratted birds,\u201d the older one said.</p><p>\u201cAnd it might not have,\u201d Kelsey insisted. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to go in.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCover the back,\u201d Logan said tersely. The officers moved around the side of the house, while he and Kelsey hurried toward the front door.</p><p>They didn\u2019t have to break in; it was open. When they walked inside, they discovered a sunken living room with white and brown furniture, chrome and glass tables, and the finest in ultramodern luxury. There were two filled wineglasses on the coffee table, neither of them touched. Logan headed toward the kitchen and family room, and Kelsey hurried down the hallway toward the bedrooms.</p><p>She found Jeff Chasson\u2019s room easily enough. It was filled with pictures of him posing with various actors, many of them stars. She didn\u2019t focus on the pictures, but on the bed.</p><p>It was wildly rumpled, sheets half on the floor, pillows scattered.</p><p>A moment\u2019s relief swept through her.</p> <p>Well, she was pretty sure she knew where Sandy had spent most of the night.</p><p>Logan came up behind her. \u201cI think we know where Sandy was, and what she was doing,\u201d he said lightly, echoing her own thought.</p><p>\u201cStill, she left the inn with nothing? No purse, no keys, no overnight bag...\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe she thought she was just going out for a while,\u201d Logan said.</p><p>\u201cSo where is she now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Jeff Chasson? Neither of them are answering their cells. Maybe they decided on a romantic interlude.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSandy wouldn\u2019t just walk off. She would\u2019ve told me, or if she\u2019s angry with me because of what I started, she certainly would have told Ricky. She stuck him with a real mess,\u201d Kelsey said.</p><p>Logan listened to her, but then shook his head. \u201cWe\u2019re already on dangerous ground, Kelsey. Sandy is an adult and she hasn\u2019t been missing twenty-four hours. Jeff Chasson\u2019s an adult, too\u2014chronologically speaking\u2014and at the moment, we\u2019re guilty of breaking and entering. They might\u2019ve had such a magnificent, tumultuous night that they went somewhere for a few days. And maybe Sandy\u2019s angrier at you than you think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know that Sandy was the one who shared this bed with Chasson,\u201d Kelsey said. \u201cAnd no matter how angry she might be with me, she loves the Longhorn. She would never just walk away from it. Besides,\u201d she added, \u201cthe front door was open!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut there\u2019s no sign of foul play here,\u201d Logan said.</p><p>\u201cYes, there is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe birds,\u201d she said. \u201cThe birds are everywhere. Something definitely happened here.\u201d</p><p>Logan looked across the table at Ned Bixby. He sat with his attorney, who appeared to be frustrated. The guy was young, a civil servant, and Logan was sure that nothing in law school had prepared him for a client who wanted to confess to everything.</p> <p>Since Logan was now convinced that Bixby hadn\u2019t even killed his own wife, he knew that he had to trip the man up. \u201cTell me about the way you stabbed your wife, Ned. It\u2019s important that we get the details.\u201d</p><p>Bixby stared back at him. \u201cI don\u2019t remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure you do. She was your wife. You loved her. Were you angry? Furious that she wanted to leave you and sleep with other men? I mean, that\u2019s what you believed, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t want me,\u201d he said quietly. He looked down at his hands. \u201cI drove her away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou drove her away because you wanted to control her with your love?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...I expected too much. Please, I said I did it. I don\u2019t need a trial. I did it. I killed her. I killed them all.\u201d</p><p>Logan leaned forward. \u201cIf you make a confession like that, Ned, and law enforcement is pulled off the case, more women could die. Do you want that to happen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, I didn\u2019t kill them all. But I killed Cynthia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo tell me about the knife.\u201d</p><p>Bixby was crying again, tears streaming down his cheeks. \u201cWhat\u2019s to tell? It was a knife. A carving knife, I guess. I grabbed it out of the holder in the kitchen. I thrust it into her heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNed,\u201d Logan said wearily, \u201cwe\u2019re going to release you.\u201d</p><p>Ned Bixby gaped at him. \u201cBut...I just confessed to killing my wife!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t kill her, Ned. Cynthia wasn\u2019t stabbed. She drowned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do the details matter? She was in the bathtub. I was so angry, I forced her head under the water,\u201d Bixby said.</p><p>The young attorney shook his head and lifted his hands. \u201cHe wants to be convicted.\u201d</p><p>Logan eased back in his chair, looking at Bixby. \u201cNed,\u201d he began, \u201cyou didn\u2019t kill your wife, but you feel responsible. You believe that if you hadn\u2019t been so possessive and dictatorial, she wouldn\u2019t have left you, and if she hadn\u2019t left you, she wouldn\u2019t be dead. But what you\u2019re doing is wrong. You didn\u2019t kill Cynthia, and what you don\u2019t see is that now her killer could get away with it.\u201d</p><p>Bixby\u2019s face contorted with anger. \u201cI did it. I am responsible,\u201d he said. He frowned at Logan. \u201cI thought I was fine. I thought I could live without her. But then you showed me...her body.\u201d</p><p>Logan rose. He walked around and set a hand on Bixby\u2019s shoulder. \u201cShe\u2019s gone, and you didn\u2019t do it. Get angry again because she was someone you loved, and she\u2019s dead, murdered.\u201d He pulled a chair closer to Bixby. \u201cTell me about her, Ned. Did she like the Congregational church a lot? Did she like music? Was she a dancer? Did she like jewelry? Did she prefer romantic comedies or horror movies or what? Help me out here.\u201d</p><p>Bixby inhaled on a deep, rattling breath. \u201cShe was full of light. She sang around the house.\u201d He paused. \u201cShe loved being in San Antonio. She\u2019d go to the Alamo and just sit in the plaza and stare at the old chapel. She told me she could see them\u2014that she could see the ghosts there. I\u2019d laugh at her, and she\u2019d be indignant and tell me that there could be a plane somewhere between this life and the next one, and I shouldn\u2019t be such a skeptic. She was happy about the ghosts she saw. She said it meant there was another world, one where everyone was happy.\u201d He winced. \u201cI didn\u2019t make her happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNed, she did leave you, right? You saw her leave, as in take her things and walk out of your home, right?\u201d Logan asked.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cBut she didn\u2019t take much. She just wanted out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you two have a computer?\u201d</p><p>Bixby nodded.</p><p>\u201cMay I have it?\u201d</p><p>Again, Bixby nodded.</p><p>Logan straightened and turned to the young attorney. \u201cI\u2019ll see about getting all the charges against him dismissed.\u201d</p><p>The attorney looked as if he was about to kiss him. Logan stepped away.</p><p>Kelsey stood with Sean at the rear of the internet caf\u00e9. The business offered dozens of computers as well as coffee, sandwiches and pastries. The manager, Shelby Horton, was a harried man in a full apron and a hair snood who wanted to be helpful, but also wanted to get them out as quickly as possible.</p><p>\u201cAs many as a hundred people come in here on a typical day,\u201d he said. \u201cTall, short, men, women...so many of the hotels still charge for internet, and guests don\u2019t want to pay. I have strangers and locals and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about Jeff Chasson?\u201d Kelsey asked. \u201cDo you know who he is?\u201d</p><p>Horton arched his eyebrows. \u201cActually, he has been here. He sometimes comes in when he\u2019s working on local shoots. He acts like he\u2019s afraid he\u2019s being followed or fans are going to come screaming after him. Frankly, not that many people even notice him. He\u2019s not that big a celebrity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he comes in regularly?\u201d</p><p>Horton nodded.</p><p>\u201cWhat about the newspaper guy\u2014Ted Murphy?\u201d Sean asked.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s always in here. I guess he thinks he\u2019ll hear something, pick up some gossip and scoop the wire services, but he\u2019s crazy. Moms come in to connect with their kids. My computers all have Skype. Soldiers come in\u2014we\u2019re not far from several bases and major military hospitals. Yeah, maybe Murphy thinks he\u2019s going to overhear some national secrets. Oh, and we get the cowboys. Now, that\u2019s funny. The guys in their rodeo getups pecking away at the keyboards. We get all kinds here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re looking for someone who logs in as Mr.Alamo,\u201d Sean told him.</p><p>\u201cI have no idea what people log in as,\u201d Horton said. \u201cDid you trace it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe name is on a free service. The address is fake, the phone number\u2019s fake, everything about it is fake.\u201d</p><p>Kelsey produced her badge. \u201cMr. Horton, someone is logging in from here to contact women and lure them to the Alamo\u2014and their deaths. We need your help.\u201d</p><p>The man froze. He turned white. \u201cOh, my God. You\u2019re talking about all the murders...the women who had their pictures in the paper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid I am. What I need is for Sean to spend the day here, searching through your computers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can be discreet,\u201d Sean promised.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m figuring you could get a warrant if you wanted, anyway, except... Oh, God, I\u2019d never make you do that. I...oh. Oh, God,\u201d Horton said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll leave the two of you together then.\u201d Kelsey flashed Sean a smile and headed out, then paused and turned back. \u201cMr. Horton, what about interpreters? Actors in costume, say, from the time of the Alamo?\u201d</p><p>Horton waved a hand in the air. \u201cSure!\u201d he said. \u201cThose guys and gals are stranger than the cowboys. They\u2019re pretty funny-looking in their period clothing, hunched over computers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Hurrying out of the internet caf\u00e9, Kelsey walked back to the Longhorn.</p><p>Tyler Montague was still on guard, and Kelsey noticed that he was making a point of talking to the men at the bar. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Among them was Bernie Firestone. As Kelsey walked over to join them, Firestone looked at her and took a long swig of his beer. \u201cAny word from Chasson yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She caught Tyler\u2019s eye; he shook his head. There been no change at the Longhorn. Ricky was doing his best to keep things running smoothly, but the bar was busy that afternoon.</p><p>\u201cGawkers,\u201d Bernie said.</p> <p>\u201cYeah, you know how folks like to slow down at the scene of an accident,\u201d Ricky agreed.</p><p>\u201cAnyone seen Corey Simmons today?\u201d Kelsey asked.</p><p>\u201cCorey\u2019s at the rodeo,\u201d Ricky answered. \u201cBull riding.\u201d</p><p>She nodded and glanced at her phone. She hadn\u2019t heard back from Logan yet, but she didn\u2019t want to bother him. She knew he was trying to ascertain the truth behind Bixby\u2019s confession. Sean was working the computer angle, and Jane, Jackson and Jake Mallory were at the station, following phone leads. There was still a guard on Chasson\u2019s house, but as yet, neither he nor Sandy had been found.</p><p>Restless and worried, Kelsey looked up the stairway to the gallery. \u201cI\u2019m going upstairs,\u201d she told Ricky. \u201cCan you see that I\u2019m not disturbed?\u201d she asked Tyler.</p> <p>\u201cOf course,\u201d he said.</p><p>She walked up the stairs. The crime-scene tape had been removed from the stairway, but still covered the door to Room 207. She slid by it carefully.</p><p>No one had been in to repair any of the damage yet. There was plaster dust over everything and, now, a gaping hole in the wall. The body of Sierra Monte had, of course, been taken away.</p><p>Kelsey sat on the foot of the bed and said softly, \u201cAre you here?\u201d</p><p>But no one answered; no shadows appeared. She knew she needed patience, so she waited, but she\u2019d disturbed the past yesterday, and even if it had been the right thing to do, she was now terribly afraid of the consequences.</p><p>She started when her phone rang and answered it quickly. Sean. \u201cYou found something?\u201d she asked.</p> <p>\u201cLocals and regulars, people who work in the area and come in often. God knows, we may be barking up the wrong tree totally, but I spoke with a woman who was here one day and sat next to a man in costume. She\u2019s the friendly sort. I guess she tried to talk to him, and she said he was rude to her\u2014he didn\u2019t want her to really see his face. He had a mustache and beard, but she was sure his hair was a wig. She also said there was something familiar about him. I\u2019m trying to get her to remember what it might have been. When we were talking I suggested she might know him and that he was trying to hide his identity, and she agreed. Anyway, her name is Alice White, and I have her number. She couldn\u2019t stay because she has small children and has to pick them up, but she\u2019ll be happy to meet with you tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Sean!\u201d Kelsey told him.</p><p>She waited again, staring at the wall. Today, her ghosts had failed her.</p><p>She didn\u2019t know how long she\u2019d been in the room when Logan quietly entered.</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t found Sandy or Chasson yet, right?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, but I did talk with Sean, and he\u2019s doing his best to trace anything he can on the computers, and Kat\u2019s doing more tests. I know we\u2019re close, Kelsey, and that we will find her.\u201d</p><p>Kelsey nodded. \u201cThe woman at the internet caf\u00e9, Alice White, told Sean that she encountered a man who was heavily costumed, trying to hide himself, and very rude. She also said he seemed sort of familiar. He has to be someone fairly well-known. Like Jeff Chasson.\u201d</p><p>Logan stretched out a hand to her.</p> <p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy house. You have to eat. And sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t sleep. Sandy is out there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd there\u2019s going to be a whole city full of people looking for her. We brought Ted Murphy down to the station for questioning. He said he got all the information he had just by eavesdropping at the bar, but he did get a lot nicer. He\u2019s put Sandy\u2019s picture on their internet site and it\u2019ll be in the morning paper. There\u2019s nothing else you can do now, Kelsey. Come on. You\u2019ll be worthless when Sandy does need you if don\u2019t eat and get some sleep.\u201d</p><p>She took his hand, and they left the Longhorn. Kelsey was starved by the time they put together a meal of tuna sandwiches, chips and salad, and when she\u2019d downed two beers, she was also exhausted. She meant to lie down and rest a little, but in minutes, she was sound asleep. She kept seeing Jeff Chasson as she slept, saw him reaching out for Sandy as they stood in Room 207, talking about the blood and Sierra Monte.</p><p>In her dreams Chasson turned to her and smiled bitterly. \u201cYou,\u201d he said. \u201cYou brought it all to life. You\u2019ll pay a price.\u201d</p><p>When she woke in the morning, she felt oddly refreshed\u2014and furious. Logan was already up and in the kitchen; she showered, dressed and joined him there.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Chasson. I know it\u2019s Chasson, and he has Sandy, and we\u2019re going to track the bastard down before he can hurt her!\u201d</p><p>Logan looked back at her. \u201cKelsey, they found Jeff Chasson last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s guilty, I know he\u2019s guilty!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey found him dead, Kelsey. In his own neighborhood, beneath a massive pile of mulch at the end of the street. His throat was slit.\u201d</p><p>Kelsey\u2019s heart seemed to stop.</p><p>\u201cAnd Sandy?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Chapter Sixteen</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no sign of Sandy yet, but I\u2019m sure she\u2019s alive and well,\u201d Logan said, trying to reassure Kelsey, which was probably ridiculous. The situation didn\u2019t look good.</p><p>Kelsey sank into a chair at the dining room table.</p><p>\u201cListen,\u201d Logan said, sitting across from her and taking her hands. \u201cI\u2019m going to talk to Jackson and get you taken off this case, because I know how much you must be suffering. That way\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! No!\u201d she said, standing and jerking her hands from his. \u201cI am staying on this case, Logan. I know Sandy better than almost anyone. I know the Longhorn. I have to stay on this case. I need to talk to Alice White today. And we need to get Sean or Kat or someone researching files to figure out who\u2019s had chemical or pharmaceutical training. We\u2019re close on this\u2014so close. And there\u2019s a chance we\u2019ll find Sandy alive,\u201d she said urgently.</p><p>She was passionate, and he understood how she felt.</p><p>There was no way in hell they could\u2019ve sent him home once Alana had been taken.</p><p>This was different, of course...and yet not so different.</p><p>\u201cAll right. I\u2019m going to drop you at the internet caf\u00e9 with Sean. Then I\u2019ll stop by the morgue and see what Kat\u2019s learned. I\u2019ll check with the group at the station and find out how our research is going on the actors, construction workers, Ted Murphy, Bernie Firestone\u2014and everyone who was then or is now at the Longhorn. They\u2019ll pull up everything, even on Ricky and the maids. When you\u2019ve finished your interview with Alice, keep working with Sean, read any emails he\u2019s gotten. He can connect them with whatever correspondence he found in Cynthia Bixby\u2019s computer, as well. He\u2019ll need your help. And we\u2019ll meet up later at the Longhorn.\u201d</p><p>Kelsey nodded her agreement.</p><p>Logan noted that she appeared strong and determined as they drove, and he reminded himself again that she belonged in the fray as much as he did.</p><p>He also knew the kind of toll emotion could take on the human mind and body.</p><p>Sean greeted them at the front of the caf\u00e9. He\u2019d apparently become friends with Shelby Horton, the manager; coffee was on Shelby.</p><p>Logan left the two of them to work and headed over to the morgue.</p><p>The body of Jeff Chasson was laid out on a table. He didn\u2019t look real anymore, Logan thought, and then again, he looked too real. Kat had performed the Y incision, but she hadn\u2019t gotten to the brain. Chasson\u2019s face, void of the animation of life, was sunk into his neck. Logan experienced a moment of guilt for disliking the man so much and then knew he didn\u2019t need to chastise himself\u2014he would never have wished this on anyone, regardless of his own feelings.</p><p>\u201cCause of death?\u201d Logan asked, although he\u2019d already heard and it was obvious from the bright red necklace around the man\u2019s throat.</p><p>\u201cExtremely sharp knife, at the jugular.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLooks like someone was trying to take his head off,\u201d Logan commented.</p><p>\u201cThis killer wasn\u2019t trying to do that, but he did know that if you got the vein or artery, death would come quickly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wasn\u2019t killed in his house,\u201d Logan said. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t a drop of blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Here\u2019s what\u2019s odd. He was killed on that mulch pile. There\u2019s no sign of any struggle on his body, so he wasn\u2019t forced there. The incision is left to right. He could have taken his own right hand and slit his throat. But also...\u201d Kat stood behind him; she was tiny, but he knew exactly what she was demonstrating. \u201cSomeone directly behind him could have done this, and the blood spray\u2014there was a spray\u2014went straight ahead. Chasson would\u2019ve gone weak almost instantly, and then crashed forward into the mulch. The killer covered him with it, but Chasson\u2019s neighborhood is pretty swanky, and they have a neighborhood watch, so he was found. If there hadn\u2019t been a \u2018patrol\u2019\u2014two retired residents who get together and walk their dogs\u2014Chasson could\u2019ve lain there undiscovered for a month. That\u2019s when the mulch company does a pick-up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have test results yet? Sounds like he was hit with the same cocktail the women were,\u201d Logan said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have the results, but I do have something. Look here.\u201d</p><p>Kat lifted Chasson\u2019s head and held back his hair. There was a very faint circular impression near the hairline.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Logan asked.</p><p>\u201cIt looks like there was a transdermal patch here. I\u2019ve taken a skin sample\u2014you can see my biopsy mark\u2014to assure us that this is indeed the method if it proves to be our fentanyl-roofie mix.

Not enough mulch over the corpse, which was left in a place the killer hadn\u2019t really known all that well. We found hairs, but judging by the color, I\u2019m thinking they\u2019ll be consistent with Sandy Holly\u2019s. We\u2019re pretty sure it was the two of them who had sex\u2014the lab is testing the sheets now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Kat.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll keep you informed.\u201d</p><p>When he started out, she called him back. \u201cLogan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going to join the unit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, yes! Are you kidding me? I\u2019ll get to run the show. I\u2019ll have funds I never dreamed of. Definitely. But then, I worked for some real good old boys before. You\u2019ve been a respected Ranger.\u201d</p><p>Logan paused and then nodded. \u201cI have to admit I like having the power to call the shots. I like the way we keep moving and pool different resources. Yeah, I\u2019ll probably take it.\u201d</p><p>He left the morgue and drove to the station, anxious to hear about further developments.</p><p>Alice White was an attractive woman in her mid-thirties. She was cordial when she met Kelsey, and they sat at one of the caf\u00e9 tables, sipping coffee.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if this means anything at all,\u201d she told Kelsey apologetically. \u201cIt\u2019s just that the man was behaving so strangely. We were at the little desks next to each other, and although he didn\u2019t exactly hide the screen with his body, it seemed like he was trying to. And I wasn\u2019t the slightest bit interested in reading his email! I was being polite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did he look like?\u201d Kelsey asked.</p> <p>\u201cA buffoon,\u201d Alice said. \u201cSo much makeup\u2014fake hair, beard, mustache. I wondered how he made a living as an actor or reenactor, or tour guide. I mean, if he was giving ghost tours, a crowd of four-year-olds would\u2019ve thought he was hokey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you remember anything else? Eye color, anything like that?\u201d Kelsey asked.</p><p>Alice frowned, trying to remember. \u201cI think he wore contact lenses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cColored contacts?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. You know how contacts can catch the light in a funny way? And the color was kind of murky. Maybe it was meant to be...or it might\u2019ve been like blue over brown or something. I\u2019m not sure.\u201d She paused, frowning again.</p><p>\u201cHeight? Weight?\u201d Kelsey asked.</p><p>\u201cUm, medium,\u201d Alice said, adjusting a bangle bracelet on her arm. \u201cNot too tall, not too heavy. I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m not a very good witness. Once when I was here, he came in and when I sat down near him, he got up and walked out. It was hard not to notice him. Like I said\u2014a buffoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was he wearing?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe had on some kind of trousers made out of hide, or fake hide.\u201d Alice paused. \u201cI wish I could tell you more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure the information you\u2019ve given us is going to be very helpful,\u201d Kelsey said.</p><p>\u201cThere was just something so odd about him, and I\u2019m not the only one who noticed it,\u201d Alice told her. \u201cYet he seemed sort of familiar, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn what way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure.... Just an impression, you know? But there was a young man who passed through here. One day, when old creepy-actor gave me one of his scowls, the young guy looked at me and said, \u2018That dude\u2019s a freak. Something\u2019s not right.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I bring a sketch artist in, could you give us a description?\u201d Kelsey asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do my best,\u201d Alice said. \u201cThere\u2019s a little office back there that Shelby will let us use.\u201d</p><p>Kelsey called Jane, who came over from the station immediately and sat down with Alice in Shelby\u2019s private office, Kelsey marveled at the dexterity in Jane\u2019s fingers as she quickly sketched and an image appeared.</p><p>\u201cIt looks like Blackbeard meets frontierman,\u201d Jane said.</p><p>\u201cThe cheekbones should be a little higher, and the eyes a little farther apart,\u201d Alice told her.</p><p>Jane erased and changed, and showed Alice the picture again.</p><p>\u201cYes, yes, that\u2019s very close,\u201d Alice said.</p><p>When they\u2019d finished the sketch, Kelsey could see that Alice White was growing restless, glancing at her watch; she needed to pick up her children. Kelsey thanked her, and let her go. Jane went back to the station with the sketch so the others could see it. When she\u2019d gone, Sean came over to where Kelsey was standing, saying goodbye to Jane.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got something I want to show you,\u201d he said. \u201cWe might have found one of our other girls. Log-in name is psychicchic. She had a similar line of correspondence going with our suspect, Mr.Alamo, on a social network.\u201d</p><p>Kelsey followed him to the computer and read the messages between the two. Psychicchic had posted about a s\u00e9ance she\u2019d attended and how the medium had turned to her for help. She bragged about the ghosts she\u2019d contacted. Mr.Alamo started out by doubting her, then pressing her about proving she had real ability. She could stretch her talents, he said, by coming to the Alamo. \u201cThere\u2019s her picture,\u201d Sean pointed out. \u201cI\u2019ll run it off and see what kind of matchup we can get. And I\u2019ll try to trace her\u2014find out if she\u2019s missing. The only picture of Mr.Alamo is right there.\u201d He pointed at a small image on the screen.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Davy Crockett,\u201d Kelsey said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what it is,\u201d Sean agreed. \u201cOkay, I\u2019m going to the station now. Do you want to drive in with me?\u201d</p><p>Kelsey shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m going to the Longhorn. I\u2019ll wait for Logan there. Call me if you come up with anything else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKelsey...\u201d Sean started to speak, but his voice drifted off. There wasn\u2019t much to say.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s been gone overnight now, Sean. And Jeff Chasson\u2019s dead. I\u2019m really afraid it\u2019s not looking good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but keep the faith,\u201d he said. \u201cI can drop you at the inn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s okay. I like the walk.\u201d</p><p>When Sean left, she thanked the manager for all his assistance\u2014and his coffee. He assured her he\u2019d be there if she needed anything else.</p><p>She walked to the Longhorn and looked over at the Alamo and the plaza, struck by how beautiful the city could be.</p><p>When she entered the saloon, some of the cowboys were there, and Bernie Firestone and Earl Candy might as well have been fixtures on their stools.</p><p>Ricky, meanwhile, was looking lost and forlorn, wiping a glass as he stood behind the bar.</p><p>Kelsey went over to greet them. All three were glum.</p><p>\u201cAnything new, Kelsey? Anything?\u201d Ricky asked.</p><p>\u201cAs you\u2019ve probably heard, they found Jeff Chasson\u2019s body, but no trace of Sandy, so there\u2019s still hope,\u201d Kelsey said.</p><p>\u201cJeez.\u201d Earl stared into his beer. \u201cI hated that bastard. He was a royal pain to work with, but...\u201d</p><p>\u201cLooks like we\u2019re all done filming,\u201d Bernie said. He raised his glass. \u201cTo Jeff. May there be a big audience to greet him in the sky!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess the documentary is...\u201d Kelsey began.</p><p>\u201cDead?\u201d Bernie asked her dryly. \u201cNo, we have enough to put together a film. And, trust me, it\u2019ll sell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s good,\u201d Kelsey said. \u201cFor everyone who\u2019s invested time and money in it. And it\u2019ll be a way of honoring Jeff.\u201d</p><p>Bernie nodded. \u201cWho would\u2019ve thought he\u2019d die like that?\u201d He shivered. \u201cYou know,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cIt seemed to be just women in danger. But now, no one\u2019s safe. I hope you catch the bastard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too,\u201d Kelsey murmured, glancing around the bar. A number of men from the rodeo were at various tables, including Corey Simmons, who sat alone. He saw her watching him, and lifted his glass, his eyes grave.</p><p>She made her way over to him. \u201cCorey, you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was. But I just heard about Chasson. And that Sandy\u2019s disappeared into thin air.\u201d He grimaced. \u201cThis place isn\u2019t just haunted. It\u2019s cursed. I\u2019ve got two more days to make some money bull riding, and then I\u2019m out of here.\u201d</p><p>She patted his shoulder. \u201cI don\u2019t believe a place can be cursed, Corey. People bring their own grief and guilt, but a place isn\u2019t cursed.\u201d</p><p>As she talked to him, the doors swung open and she saw that Ted Murphy had returned. He headed straight for the bar to take the seat next to Bernie Firestone and ordered a beer. He met Kelsey\u2019s eyes. \u201cI\u2019ve been doing anything you all have asked me to get those pictures out there. I\u2019m doing whatever I can to get the public involved,\u201d he said defensively.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t going to attack you, Ted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ready to do whatever will help. The whole community is in a state of shock,\u201d he said. \u201cEveryone\u2019s scared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat includes me. I\u2019ll be closing up early,\u201d Ricky told her. He leaned on the bar and whispered, \u201cI gave Jackson Crow the names of our overnight guests. He ran them through some computer\u2014goes all over the country\u2014and at least we don\u2019t have anyone with anything worse than a parking ticket!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure we\u2019re safe here. I noticed there\u2019s a police car outside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish they\u2019d left Tyler, but this is a new guy. I felt safer with Ranger Montague. The one out there, well, he seems to be dozing with his hat on. Wish he\u2019d come in and stare people down the way Montague did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m here, Ricky, if you need me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d he murmured. \u201cWhat the hell made Sandy go off with that guy?\u201d he demanded loudly.</p><p>\u201cSex,\u201d Ted Murphy answered. \u201cChasson always told me he could pick up a woman and get laid any night he wanted.\u201d He cleared his throat, realizing he was talking to close friends of the missing woman. \u201cMs. Holly is very attractive, and Jeff Chasson could be extremely...seductive.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m going to my room for a while,\u201d Kelsey said. \u201cRicky, if something comes up or if anyone wants to see me, call me, okay?\u201d</p><p>He nodded gravely.</p><p>Kelsey walked up the stairs, wondering why she was so convinced that the answers had to be somewhere in Room 207. But now, when she went in, it seemed empty, as if all life\u2014and death\u2014had left it. She was in the midst of well-tended period furniture and plaster dust.</p> <p>The bed was in bad shape. She dusted the quilt, kicked off her heels and lay back.</p><p>Kelsey closed her eyes and tried to reconstruct everything she\u2019d seen, willing herself to view the image of the residual haunting again. In a few minutes, she opened her eyes slightly, and a silvery mist seemed to pervade the air. Then it dissipated and the residual haunting began.</p><p>Rose and Matt. She, with her stunning dark hair piled atop her head, in her usual half-dressed state, the rest of her garments strewn about. Matt in his dark suit, a tall hat, dapper but still rough around the edges.</p><p>He strode furiously across the room and seized hold of Rose, saying, \u201cYou won\u2019t hold out on me! I want it, and I want it now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have it,\u201d she said.</p> <p>The rest of the scene played out as she knew it would. Just like he had before, he reached out for Rose and his fingers curled around her neck. He strangled her, ignoring her pleas. Then Rose went limp, dead, and Matt picked her up and threw her on the bed and the scene faded. But this time, when it was gone, Kelsey kept seeing the death in her mind, and she tried to figure out what bothered her about it.</p><p>Don\u2019t think too hard. Let it come.</p><p>She got up and walked to the broken wall. How had Sierra\u2019s killer had managed to do it all\u2014kill her so viciously and disappear, right in the middle of the inn\u2019s sale and renovation?</p><p>A moment later, she went to her window and looked at the small yard. She caught sight of the old toolshed. It was just used by the gardeners now, Kelsey assumed, but she was suddenly tempted to check it out. She hesitated. She didn\u2019t want to go through the gauntlet of men in the bar again; she wasn\u2019t up to dealing with their questions and fears. But she wondered, if in the search for Sierra, anyone had inspected the toolshed. She couldn\u2019t imagine that Jackson Crow or Logan hadn\u2019t looked there.</p><p>Kelsey leaned out the window. There was a sturdy branch reaching up from an old oak; its leaves actually touched the outside wall. Reflecting that she hadn\u2019t been a tomboy for nothing, Kelsey climbed onto the sill and stretched out, swinging herself over, testing her weight. It was absurdly easy to grab the branch, go hand over hand to the trunk, drop to a lower branch and then down to the ground.</p><p>She started across the manicured grounds and toward the toolshed.</p> <p>The door opened smoothly on well-oiled hinges. Inside, the small shed was dark, but she could see neat rows of gardening supplies and tools. She entered cautiously\u2014and heard something, or thought she did. She paused, listening. She studied the space in which she stood. It was about twelve by twelve, and with the lawn mower, the shelves and more, she didn\u2019t see anything that could make a noise.</p><p>But then she heard it again, and it seemed to come from beneath her.</p><p>The inn had a basement, of course, and she knew that Sandy stored things down there, in the various rooms created by the foundations. But would a toolshed have a basement? She wished she\u2019d asked her more about the building itself.</p><p>The noise came again. And this time, it sounded like a word. A single word.</p><p>\u201cHelp.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSandy?\u201d Kelsey cried anxiously. She fell to her knees, studying the floor. There was nothing, no hint of cellar door or opening.</p><p>She moved the lawn mower and still saw nothing. She ran her hands over the floor and felt a line, a slight ridge. Following the line, she realized it was a flat three-sided door. Probably the entrance to some kind of tornado shelter.</p><p>She opened the door and peered in. Pitch dark. She\u2019d have to go back to the house and get a flashlight.</p> <p>But she heard her name, called out in a soft, barely discernible whisper. \u201cKelsey? Kelsey, please hurry!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSandy, I can\u2019t see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust jump. It\u2019s low...there\u2019s sawdust, oh, please, please, before...\u201d</p><p>Sandy\u2019s voice trailed off. Desperate, Kelsey angled herself around, gripped the edge of the flooring, dangled for a minute and then let herself drop.</p><p>She didn\u2019t fall far. She landed on a pile of old clothes or bedding and struggled to sit up.</p><p>A light began to glow and she felt something touch the back of her neck. She heard the sound of hoarse, throaty laughter. She felt a calm sweep through her body, a strange sense not of paralysis, but of almost lazy pleasure, and as her Glock was slipped from her holster, she knew she\u2019d been hit with the drug cocktail.</p><p>\u201cWelcome,\u201d came a voice. \u201cNow we\u2019ll find the diamond!\u201d</p><p>Chapter Seventeen</p><p>When Logan reached the station, he was advised of the strides the team had made in the past few hours. He sat with Sean, who was reading emails and trying to match up Facebook pages with missing women. They were dejected when they realized that psychicchic was a missing eighteen-year-old from Nebraska who\u2019d hitchhiked down to Oklahoma with friends and was then never heard from again.</p><p>Logan said grimly that he\u2019d contact the family and they\u2019d get a DNA sample.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we on looking up anyone who might have had a medical, chemical or pharmaceutical background?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cPretty much nowhere,\u201d Sean told him. \u201cMost of the potential suspects went to Texas schools, and no one studied medicine, but they all had to take a pretty tough course in chemistry in order to graduate from high school. Our Ted Murphy recently took a course called \u2018Street Drugs and Slang for Journalists.\u2019 Cowboy Corey did some classes in animal husbandry. Ricky took a number of cooking classes. It doesn\u2019t matter about Jeff Chasson anymore, does it?\u201d He paused. \u201cIronically, our latest victim\u2014or likely victim\u2014Sandy Holly went to a seminar called \u2018Young Woman on the Street, Beware.\u2019\u201d</p><p>As they spoke, there was a tap at the door. Logan answered it to find the desk sergeant with a tall, bald man who looked like he might have stepped out of a Mr. Clean commercial.</p><p>He offered his hand. \u201cI\u2019m Bobby Moore. I was the contractor on the Longhorn just before the murder took place. I was fired afterward when the old owner stepped back in and Ms. Holly was in a financial mess. I\u2019m here to help you any way I can.\u201d</p><p>Logan invited him in. They arranged a chair for him in the center of the room and grouped around him.</p><p>\u201cHow could Sierra Monte\u2019s body have been walled in like that, without anyone knowing?\u201d Logan began.</p><p>\u201cWhen I heard, I asked myself that question. But I guess it wasn\u2019t that hard. We\u2019d been working on some pipes and the electricity, so there was fresh drywall and plaster in a lot of areas. From what I understand, the room was covered in blood, but I guess even when there\u2019s blood everywhere and a massive search, if there\u2019s no body, there\u2019s no murder?\u201d he asked, looking at each of them.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s changed a bit, but it\u2019s difficult to prosecute without a body, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnyone going into that room would know some work had been done recently\u2014but there\u2019d been work done all over the inn, mostly on things necessary to get the building up to code. And the inspectors had been in just a few days before that blood was found, so there seemed to be no reason to start knocking down walls.\u201d He grimaced. \u201cI got to admit, it gave me the chills when I heard, and I knew they\u2019d have to investigate my team, but we were already out of there. We\u2019d been out since the inspection. I was working an old mansion in Louisiana, and my men were scattered. I brought you a list of workers here in San Antonio\u2014most of \u2019em day jobbers\u2014and I also have a blueprint of the place, with the work we did, just in case you need it.\u201d He reached into his pocket and produced a sheaf of neatly folded papers. \u201cMy God, that this could happen...\u201d</p><p>Logan opened the blueprint. He stared at it, but he already knew the inn so well. He hadn\u2019t been to the basement, though, and was intrigued to see the original foundation lines of the old saloon, along with the modern additions.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d he asked Moore, pointing at a line.</p><p>\u201cOh, that. There used to be a well out back. When city water came through, it wasn\u2019t needed, but there was an old walkway that led from the house to the well, so the whole thing was incorporated into an underground tunnel. It was walled off for years. The old well was destroyed and a carriage house stood there at one time. Then that was destroyed and a toolshed was put out there, oh, probably sometime back in the early twentieth century.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ll do some exploring there tonight,\u201d he told Moore. \u201cThank you for bringing this in, and for coming to speak with us.\u201d</p><p>Moore rose and shook hands all around. \u201cI\u2019m a phone call away,\u201d he said, \u201cand happy to help.\u201d</p><p>Logan was planning to head straight out to the Longhorn, but Jane tapped him on the shoulder. \u201cYou haven\u2019t seen the sketches of the man who may be our culprit.\u201d</p><p>He sat with her as she showed him the latest sketch she\u2019d made; she\u2019d entered it in the computer so she could alter hair, eyes and facial features at will.</p><p>There was something about the image that disturbed him. He felt he should have figured out what it was but couldn\u2019t quite pinpoint it.</p><p>\u201cSince Kelsey spoke with Alice White, who gave me the description, maybe she\u2019ll have an idea,\u201d Jane suggested.</p><p>He tried Kelsey\u2019s number, but she didn\u2019t answer. Then he called the bar and got Ricky, who assured him that Kelsey was fine and up in Room 207.</p><p>Logan decided to go there and talk to her before he did any exploring. Checking out the property again, with the asistance of Bobby Moore\u2019s blueprint, was a last-ditch effort, but maybe they\u2019d missed Sandy somehow.</p><p>\u201cJackson, there was a thorough search of the grounds, not just the house, after Sandy went missing, right?\u201d Logan asked. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I gave this toolshed much attention.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jackson nodded. \u201cI went inside it myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, call me if\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a massive team out there looking for Ms. Holly,\u201d Jackson said quietly.</p> <p>\u201cI know...\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d gotten in his car and was halfway to the Longhorn when his phone rang. He answered it immediately, assuming Kelsey was returning his call.</p><p>\u201cRaintree.\u201d</p><p>There was silence. He almost hung up.</p><p>Then he heard the voice. It was altered, he thought, sounding like the voice of a murderous puppet in a horror movie.

Yes, you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho is this, and what do you want?\u201d</p><p>There was laughter. \u201cTough Texas Ranger! Well, you\u2019re not stupid. I want the usual. Don\u2019t try to trace this call. I\u2019m not stupid, either. The phone is an unregistered pay-as-you-go. And don\u2019t go calling your buddies. You\u2019re getting a second chance here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt saving a woman you love.\u201d</p><p>He practically drove off the road.</p> <p>Kelsey hadn\u2019t answered her phone. Ricky had said she was fine, up in Room 207. But Sandy Holly had disappeared just as easily, as if into thin air.</p><p>\u201cYes, tough boy, Lone Ranger, that\u2019s what you are right now. On your own. If you want to play, of course. This is your chance. Yes, I have Kelsey O\u2019Brien. Indeed, I do.\u201d</p><p>He and Kelsey had been professional. They hadn\u2019t run around holding hands or kissing in public. Not surprisingly, the team seemed to know, but respected their privacy. And maybe some of the people at the inn had guessed, too.</p><p>\u201cI thought you\u2019d enjoy this, Logan,\u201d the caller said. \u201cA second chance. You had a first chance once, didn\u2019t you? And you blew it. So try number two. Kelsey\u2019s still alive, I promise you\u2014at this moment, she\u2019s still alive. I\u2019m hoping she\u2019ll do what I need her to do, but I know you have the power, too. Kelsey tells me she doesn\u2019t have any idea where the diamond is. Get the diamond, Logan. Get me the Galveston diamond, and you can have Kelsey back. You can also try to find me.\u201d The horrible laughter sounded again. \u201cFind me, Logan. But scare me and Kelsey dies. One of you comes up with the diamond, or you both die. But her first, of course. I wouldn\u2019t want you to miss it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere, that\u2019s done!\u201d</p><p>Prone on the pile of bedding, aware that she had no strength or will to fight, Kelsey pretended not to stir.</p><p>But she knew.</p><p>She had to get the patch off her neck and do it without being seen.</p> <p>Now.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s done,\u201d she parroted.</p><p>She shifted, as if she was completely comfortable on her makeshift bed on the floor. She smoothed back her hair and felt the patch against her fingers\u2014and she had it off. She noticed, however, that down here, there were more tools and lock boxes, and she was pretty sure the lock boxes were filled with the drugs that had been used on the women.</p><p>Her captor hunkered down beside her. \u201cI know you can see ghosts, Kelsey. I know you can talk to them. Even when we were kids, you were seeing stuff, and people made fun of you, so you never said anything. You\u2019d turn your visions or whatever they were into the most fantastic stories!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see ghosts,\u201d Kelsey said, looking into Sandy Holly\u2019s eyes and wondering how she could have missed the fact that her dear friend, her hostess, the woman she\u2019d known for so many years, was a psychopath.</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019ve seen the ghost of Rose Langley, haven\u2019t you, Kelsey?\u201d Sandy said.</p><p>She was so weak. Her mind was still fogged.</p><p>She saw a row of tools that dangled from a rafter above her. There was a large machete there, along with garden hoes and edgers. All Sandy had to do was reach up and grab the machete. One strike and\u2014</p><p>She forced herself to stare into Sandy\u2019s eyes and giggle. \u201cI thought you liked Jeff Chasson. Instead, you cut his balls off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t cut his balls off!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, since he\u2019s dead, it doesn\u2019t really matter.\u201d</p><p>Sandy sighed. \u201cLook, I did have a thing for Chasson. But he was a snoop, so I was trying to distract him, keep him in line. He was learning too much. Kelsey, listen, I don\u2019t really want to kill you. You\u2019re my friend...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen don\u2019t!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat I can do is give you a little dose and leave you here. They\u2019ll find you sooner or later. All I want is the diamond, Kelsey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Sandy sounded impatient. \u201cI just do! I just want what it can buy. I want the power it can give me. It belonged to royalty, and it would mean a whole new life. I\u2019ve heard about it since I was a kid. When my grandfather first told me the story, I could see it, imagine it\u2014I almost felt like I could touch it. I\u2019ve watched this place. I\u2019ve worked so hard to get this place so I could have the diamond. It\u2019s my right!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat am I supposed to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRose Langley had that diamond when she died. She hid it somewhere. You can talk to Rose Langley\u2014you\u2019ve probably already done it. So get her to tell you where the diamond is. I\u2019ve already disappeared. You won\u2019t remember any of this once I give you a bit more, and the world will think I was the killer\u2019s last victim.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t know how long she could keep it up, but Kelsey decided to stick with the stupid smile. \u201cWhy did you invite a U.S. Marshal to stay with you when you were killing people? Wasn\u2019t that kind of...dumb?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted you here. All the other idiots who claimed to be great psychics were useless. I really just stumbled on Sierra Monte\u2014and her belief that she was a psychic and could find the diamond. After that...after Sierra, I was sure there was a real psychic out there somewhere who could talk to Rose\u2019s ghost and ask her. But, as you know now,\u201d she added dryly, \u201cI\u2019ve been trying for a while. I figured I\u2019d get to you eventually. And then I eavesdropped on you and Logan Raintree. Everyone in Texas knows about him and what happened to his wife.\u201d She patted Kelsey\u2019s head. \u201cSo, you find it, he finds it\u2014I don\u2019t care. I just want it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re good,\u201d Kelsey said. \u201cSo good... But I\u2019m curious. Did you kill Cynthia Bixby? Was she coming around here? Had you contacted her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, no. I didn\u2019t kill her. I heard about her from Ricky and I did contact her, yes. She had some fantasy about being a psychic. But that was one messed-up woman. She had a hard time at home and claimed she heard voices. It might\u2019ve been for real, who can tell? I\u2019m willing to bet, though, that she looked at that water and just threw herself in. Drowned herself. I never had a chance to really get to know her\u2014or to find out if she could locate the diamond. She was just...collateral damage. But you\u2019re right\u2014I am good. I didn\u2019t let myself become a suspect.\u201d</p><p>Sandy shrugged. \u201cYou did give me a jolt when you dug Sierra Monte out of the wall. That bitch told me she was going to find the diamond and she was going to keep it. I was livid. That night was a mess, I can tell you! I had to put a sheet over my head to go after her, and she kept running, and I had to keep stabbing her... . Thank God there were drunkards down in the bar, a bunch of losers who couldn\u2019t hear an air-raid siren if it went off right next to them! But I couldn\u2019t figure out what to do with the body. So I walled it up. Everything was all repainted later, after the room was cleaned, and no one was any the wiser. Anyway, when I was done, I went out the window and down the tree. When they told me about it, I cried, Kelsey. I cried real tears. I kept crying whenever I checked on the clean-up crew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the smell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI used cinnamon bark\u2014not just cinnamon, it has to be cinnamon bark\u2014and spices. I put it inside the wall. And, of course, I made sure everything was airtight when I did my little home repair. Remember history? How people used potpourri sachets to hide smells? Cinnamon was the base for those, and believe you me, I had to think of that quickly after she wound up dead! She was my first, Kelsey. I was just learning, you see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I said, Sandy, you\u2019re good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got good, that\u2019s for sure. I knew the bodies would be discovered at some point, but I was pretty careful about promising fame and fortune only if they came alone, without anyone knowing. Oh, Kelsey, you\u2019d be stunned at how naive women are! I took a course on what to watch out for, but those little fools are the ones who really should have taken it. They were so gullible!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did you kill them?\u201d Kelsey asked.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t planning on sharing the diamond,\u201d Sandy said. She spoke in a chiding voice, as if Kelsey should have undertood this.</p><p>\u201cSo you killed Jeff Chasson for getting too close to the truth.\u201d Kelsey made an effort to keep her tone merely curious.</p><p>\u201cI told you that,\u201d Sandy said, pursing her lips.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s more to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was a prick!\u201d Sandy leaned closer to her. \u201cDo you know what he had the audacity to say to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat he was interested in you.\u201d Sandy giggled. \u201cWell, pretty soon, unless you get me that diamond, he will get to know you. The two of you can haunt San Antonio happily together. Oh, oh...it\u2019ll be a threesome. When the Lone Ranger shows up\u2014minus any of his Tontos\u2014one of you had better get me the diamond.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Sandy!\u201d Kelsey said, using a voice she might have when they were kids. \u201cYou\u2019re going to kill us, anyway!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI really don\u2019t want to,\u201d Sandy said earnestly. \u201cI mean that. I just do what needs to be done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDress up like a hairy frontiersman?\u201d Kelsey asked.</p><p>\u201cThat was fun. I wore a costume and did the computer invites at the internet caf\u00e9. But down at the plaza? That wasn\u2019t me.\u201d She moved her lips close to Kelsey\u2019s ear, and Kelsey prayed she wouldn\u2019t notice that the patch was gone. \u201cThat was my partner. No one manages this kind of operation alone. You know what? He\u2019s a great actor. But he\u2019s going to die tonight, too. The diamond is mine.\u201d She moved away suddenly. \u201cI want that diamond, Kelsey. And I want it now.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou called Logan. He might come with the whole FBI. Then you can kill me, but they\u2019ll get you, and you won\u2019t get the diamond.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLogan won\u2019t let you die. He\u2019ll come alone. You watch. Now, while we\u2019re waiting, why don\u2019t you see if you can conjure up Rose Langley for me?\u201d</p><p>The voice didn\u2019t give it away. Whatever cheap little device Sandy Holly had bought, it was doing the job. No, it hadn\u2019t been the voice that had given her away.</p> <p>It had been the sketches. There\u2019d been something about the eyes, and when they\u2019d spoken, he\u2019d suddenly seen her face, and seen it with the beard, the mustache, the hair.</p><p>It made a shocking kind of sense.</p><p>Who knew the Longhorn better?</p><p>And who\u2019d been around when the inn was changing hands?</p><p>He kept driving, trying to determine his course of action. So far, Sandy probably didn\u2019t realize that he knew about the basement\u2014and the tunnel, supposedly walled up, that led to the toolshed. He was almost positive she\u2019d found a way to get Kelsey down there. And Kelsey was tough and smart, but who would expect the enemy to be a friend? A friend who seemed to be in desperate trouble.</p> <p>And, he thought, Sandy wasn\u2019t working alone.</p><p>If he called in the troops, if they came en masse, they\u2019d be able to corral Sandy Holly and her partner.</p><p>But Kelsey would die.</p><p>He pulled onto the side of the road, and for a minute the pain that surged through him was so intense he couldn\u2019t bear it. Then he breathed, slowly and deeply, and considered what they\u2019d learned about the men who hung around the Longhorn Saloon.</p><p>Finally, he thought he knew the truth. He kept breathing and put his plan into action.</p><p>He pulled back onto the road and drove to the Longhorn.</p> <p>\u201cIs he here yet?\u201d Sandy asked.</p><p>Kelsey had heard the false wall between the basement and the cellar beneath it slide open, but she couldn\u2019t twist around to see who\u2019d come. The voice was hoarse and low, and hard to recognize.</p><p>\u201cNo, not yet. I\u2019m just down here to bring up some bottles of rum. The Ranger needs to come soon. The longer this takes...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. We\u2019ve kept captives down here for days when we\u2019ve had to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey don\u2019t make any noise when they\u2019re dead. How\u2019s this one doing? Did we really have to call the Ranger?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. One of them\u2019s the real deal. I know that for a fact,\u201d Sandy said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m pretty sure the other is, too. I want insurance. It\u2019s time to put an end to this.\u201d</p><p>The drug was wearing off; Kelsey had gotten to the patch quickly enough. But with both of them down there\u2014Sandy and her partner\u2014she didn\u2019t really stand a chance. She was afraid to try moving yet.</p><p>\u201cGo back upstairs. Watch for the Ranger.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, yeah. She must be another fake,\u201d he said, kicking the bedding where Kelsey lay, \u201cor she would\u2019ve called them for you by now.\u201d</p><p>Kelsey forced a giggle. \u201cI can call them. Do you want to play ghost?\u201d</p><p>At last he stepped around in front of her. She wasn\u2019t surprised. It had all been an act from the moment she\u2019d arrived at the Longhorn Saloon.</p><p>\u201cYeah, let\u2019s play ghost,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>Kelsey prayed for help, from the living\u2014or the dead.</p><p>\u201cRose, Rose? Please. I know you\u2019re usually in the house. But can you come here? Now? Please, Rose, these people want to talk to you about the diamond.\u201d</p><p>There was no way on earth that Kelsey could have known she was performing on cue.</p><p>Logan had parked the car down the street and around the corner. He\u2019d come in through the exit they\u2019d taken from Sandy\u2019s room the night before. So far, easy. Too easy.</p><p>But what kind of shape was Kelsey in? How did he get to her without alerting the others? He\u2019d studied the blueprints up and down and inside out, and there was no entrance other than the basement stairs\u2014off the main bar\u2014or through the false floor of the toolshed.</p><p>So, drop in, guns blazing? Would they be able to kill Kelsey that fast? She\u2019d be drugged; she wouldn\u2019t be capable of defending herself. They\u2019d surely have taken her Glock by now.</p><p>As he reached the house, he saw the birds. He\u2019d never seen so many flocked in one place before, not even that day at his house.</p><p>\u201cHey, help me out tonight, brothers!\u201d he said softly.</p><p>Logan was afraid of making any noise as he opened the back gate. He politely asked the birds to shift so he could hop over the fence. He approached the shed from the back.</p><p>And then he paused. The birds flew madly before him as he drew closer to the shed. They were like a cloud of bees, they moved so quickly.</p><p>And then...</p><p>The movement ceased, and the birds took shape, and there in the dusk and the moonlight stood Rose Langley.</p><p>Please.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t sure if he spoke the word aloud or if he thought it, and he wasn\u2019t sure if Rose was really there, or if she was an illusion he\u2019d created.</p><p>But illusion or real, she understood. She brought a finger to her lips and walked toward the shed, opening the door so quietly he didn\u2019t hear it himself.</p><p>But he did hear Kelsey\u2019s voice. It seemed far away and distant, but the trapdoor in the shed was still open, and he moved close to it, and listened as she said again, \u201cRose, please, Rose, they want your diamond. Could you get it for them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing\u2019s happening,\u201d Corey said crossly. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve got to go back up and lure that cop down here.\u201d</p><p>Let him go. Let me save Kelsey, and then deal with him, Logan prayed.</p><p>His luck wasn\u2019t going to be that good.</p><p>\u201cStay here. The stupid cop\u2019ll go up to 207.\u201d</p><p>He heard Kelsey speak again, stalling for time, obviously determined to get the truth\u2014before she died. He was astonished that she was conscious, that she could speak, but maybe he shouldn\u2019t be. It was Kelsey, after all. She had known about the patches, and must have somehow gotten hers off.</p><p>\u201cSo, Corey, are you really a cowboy?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYou bet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut somehow Sandy got you to be a lackey for her. She teased you, and then slept with you, right? But she made you keep it a secret. You liked what the two of you did, though\u2014didn\u2019t you? Kidnapping women and then killing them. But she tried to make you jealous, keep you in line. Didn\u2019t that piss you off sometimes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop it, Kelsey,\u201d Sandy said.</p><p>\u201cSeriously, I\u2019d be pissed off. She slept with that poor producer and then flirted with the newspaper guy\u2014like a true whore!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, we had to shut him up!\u201d Sandy said. \u201cCorey, ignore her. She\u2019s doing this on purpose. Ignore her, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI gotta go back to the bar,\u201d Corey mumbled.</p><p>Let him go. Let me save Kelsey...</p><p>He felt a gossamer touch on his arm. Rose. She looked at him with sorrowful, questioning eyes. Should I? she seemed to ask.</p><p>Logan nodded.</p><p>\u201cRose?\u201d Kelsey\u2019s voice pleaded.</p><p>Rose preceded Logan to the drop. Like a feather through air, she stepped into nothingness and floated down.</p><p>He heard Corey Simmons\u2019s hoarse cry of astonishment as the ghost joined them. Logan leaped down and rolled with his gun cocked. Corey Simmons stared as if he were a ghost, too, but Logan aimed directly at him and shouted a warning when Corey went for his gun. \u201cDrop it! I\u2019ll shoot to kill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou drop it!\u201d Sandy demanded, flying toward Kelsey. \u201cI\u2019ve got another patch. This one is loaded with fentanyl. A hundred times more powerful than morphine. She\u2019ll be dead in seconds with this one, cowboy.\u201d</p><p>He had to shoot; he had to. He couldn\u2019t aim the gun at Sandy because Corey would shoot him, but whatever he did, he had only seconds.</p><p>There was a burst of noise in the room, and a burst of blackness. The ghost of Rose Langley had become a flock of furious flapping birds once again, and they were blinding everyone. Corey Simmons shot wildly. Logan turned his gun on Sandy and shot her through the forehead. Simmons had a bead on him, but to his astonishment, Kelsey suddenly scrambled up from the bedding and tackled him around the ankles. Corey went down, and his second shot went wild as he dropped his gun. He threw off Kelsey, then reached for his gun, but Logan had learned never to take chances. When Corey grabbed his Colt and turned to aim, Logan was above him, his finger on the trigger. He\u2019d aimed true; Corey died swiftly, a bullet hole smoking between his eyes.</p><p>Kelsey staggered to her feet and fell against him.</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cI got the patch off,\u201d she whispered. \u201cOh, Logan...Rose saved us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven without knowing where the Galveston diamond is.\u201d Logan held her up, held her tight.</p><p>\u201cI know where the diamond is,\u201d Kelsey said.</p><p>\u201cYou do, and Rose didn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI went to the room, Logan. I willed myself to see the residual haunting again, and I watched her closely. I saw something glitter in her hair. That\u2019s where she kept it. In her hair. Matt Meyer was a bastard who would\u2019ve searched her body, but she could have slipped it into her hair and he would never have thought to look. When she died, she was a saloon-hall whore, and Texans were about to be massacred. There was no real justice for her, Logan. And there was probably no funeral. She was thrown in a pine box and buried, and if she was lucky, someone said a few words for her. If we find out where she\u2019s buried, we\u2019ll find the diamond.\u201d</p><p>By then, footsteps were tramping down the basement stairs. Ted Murphy came in, smashing the false closure to the walled-in tunnel. Ricky came after him, and then Bernie and Earl, and right behind him were the other members of the unit. Jackson pushed through, anxious to see what had happened. He looked from the dead on the floor to the living before him.</p><p>\u201cYou pulled it off, Logan,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWe pulled it off. Kelsey was the first woman who managed to remove the patch. And she managed to keep Sandy talking. We pulled it off,\u201d he repeated. \u201cBy the way, your timing was perfect.\u201d He smiled apologetically at Kelsey. \u201cEven if they\u2019d killed us both, we had to stop them.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s what we do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSandy?\u201d Ricky said brokenly. He turned to Kelsey. \u201cSandy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I\u2019m sorry, Ricky.\u201d</p> <p>There were tears in his eyes. Ricky had really cared about Sandy. But then so had she, Kelsey thought. Sandy had been her friend, her childhood companion, a woman she\u2019d loved. A woman she hadn\u2019t actually known. Whose depths of evil\u2014there was no other word\u2014she hadn\u2019t understood. The grief she felt now was for the Sandy who had never truly existed... .</p><p>Bernie Firestone was waving his hands in the air. \u201cWhat the hell is it with all the birds?\u201d he muttered. \u201cShoo, shoo...let\u2019s get them out of here!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI rather like birds,\u201d Logan said. \u201cIn fact, I\u2019m very fond of them!\u201d</p><p>Epilogue</p><p>Kelsey left the Longhorn, aware that Rose Langley was at her side. She smiled to herself as she walked.</p> <p>They reached the Alamo plaza, and she saw Logan immediately\u2014just as she saw Zachary Chase.</p><p>Both men stood as they approached. Kelsey nodded at Logan, but then gave her attention to Zachary and Rose.</p><p>At first, they simply stared at each other. Zachary took off his hat, and worked the brim anxiously between his fingers as he watched Rose, adoration in his eyes. Rose hesitated.</p><p>\u201cCome on, he\u2019s waiting for you,\u201d Kelsey whispered.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been so long, and...I don\u2019t know how he ever loved me,\u201d Rose said.</p><p>\u201cBecause your soul is beautiful,\u201d Kelsey told her. \u201cRose, you forgot how worthy you were of love. How worthy you are. Go to Zachary now. Go to him. He still loves you.\u201d</p> <p>Rose stepped ahead of her, until she stood in front of Zachary Chase. He took her hands and gazed down into her eyes. His voice was choked as he said, \u201cRose.\u201d</p><p>She stroked his cheek. \u201cZachary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Rose!\u201d</p><p>Neither of them noticed as Kelsey joined Logan. Still gazing at each other, Rose and Zachary turned and walked toward the Alamo.</p><p>\u201cHave they gone off into the light, do you think?\u201d Kelsey asked.</p><p>\u201cMaybe, and maybe they\u2019ll stay around for a while.\u201d He glanced down at her. \u201cRose was very happy, you know. You found her grave, and the diamond, and you saw that she was given a fine funeral and buried next to Zachary. It was really lovely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was, wasn\u2019t it? And Kat was so respectful when she opened the box of Rose\u2019s bones and took out the diamond. It\u2019ll do wonders for the children in Haiti.\u201d</p><p>They\u2019d all had quite a discussion about the diamond. At first they\u2019d thought they should leave it with Rose, but then decided there might be other fortune hunters who\u2019d kill for the stone. So they\u2019d decided it had to come out, and that it needed to go to a good cause. They\u2019d all agreed it should be donated to a charity.</p> <p>\u201cSierra has moved on,\u201d Kelsey said. \u201cShe said goodbye to me that night, and she smiled, and I think I saw her wave. Then she was gone.\u201d</p><p>Logan looked in the direction of Zachary and Rose. \u201cThat\u2019s good,\u201d he said. \u201cZachary and Rose, they might stay on for a bit. They\u2019ve just found each other after a very long time. I don\u2019t have all the answers.\u201d He smiled at her. \u201cNeither of us does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut we have some of them,\u201d she said.</p><p>He nodded, still smiling. \u201cYes, we have some of them. And by the way, ma\u2019am, there\u2019s far more to San Antonio than you\u2019ve seen so far. I thought we could do a little sightseeing here, and then you could show me around Key West.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have to head to Virginia for some training soon, and exchange our old badges for new ones. But I figured that since we\u2019ll have a few days\u2014now that it\u2019s settled and the second Krewe will be Sean, Kat, Tyler, Jane and the two of us\u2014we should enjoy some time in the sun, near the sea... . I want to go to Key West and see your home. What do you think?\u201d</p><p>They were professionals, of course, and they always acted like professionals. They were standing in front of the Alamo, one of the most sacred shrines in the country. But she had a feeling that all the ghosts of the Alamo and every one of her professional associates would approve.</p><p>She stepped closer and rose on tiptoe and kissed him.</p><p>\u201cSounds like a plan,\u201d she said lightly. \u201cAnd I can\u2019t begin to tell you how many truly beautiful birds we have in the Keys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do love birds,\u201d he told her, and hand in hand, much like Rose and Zachary before them, they ambled along the plaza, eyes only for each other. </p> </body></html>"]
