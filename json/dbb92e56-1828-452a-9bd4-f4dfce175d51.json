The ruptured ear drum would be So. Worth. It.</p><p>But unfortunately, I\u2019ll need my hearing for my senior year this year. And also unfortunately, I can tell by the bright red hue to my mother\u2019s cheeks that she\u2019s far from finished.</p><p>I sigh and stare out the window.</p><p>And ponder my life.</p><p>Because I live in a bubble.</p> <p>A fragile, beautiful, misleading bubble.</p><p>Anyone looking in might think that life within my shiny bubble is perfect. That I have the perfect parents, perfect home, a perfect life. But it is far from perfect and so am I.</p><p>Trust me.</p><p>Or just ask my mother.</p><p>\u201cTake it out.\u201d</p><p>Each word that Adrianna Giannis spits from her lips is like an ice pellet. She\u2019s really pissed now, I can tell. But I don\u2019t care because I\u2019m pissed, too. My new nose ring isn\u2019t hurting anyone. It\u2019s just a little silver stud. It\u2019s not like I got a tattoo on my face or my nipples pierced. I tell her that and her nostrils flare out a little and she cocks her head in a very dangerous way.</p> <p>I take a cautionary step back. My mother has never laid a hand on me, but all good things must come to an end sometime.</p><p>That time might seriously be now.</p><p>Mom narrows her eyes and I might be mistaken, but I think I see red in them.</p><p>\u201cMia Alexandria Giannis. We have put up with your black clothing and the way you dye your hair. We have even tolerated your new bad attitude. But this.\u201d And at this point, she throws up her hands and waves them around. \u201cThis is ridiculous. You know that we have an image to protect because of your father. You know that. Yet you don\u2019t seem to care. You don\u2019t care about anything but yourself. What are we going to do with you?\u201d</p><p>I stare back at her as firmly as I can and take a deep breath.</p><p>And then reluctantly dive back into the same-old, same-old argument that we\u2019ve already had five hundred other times before.</p><p>Make that five-thousand.</p><p>Or five-hundred-thousand.</p> <p>\u201cMom. I don\u2019t understand why I have to pretend to be someone that I\u2019m not just because of my father\u2019s job. It\u2019s not like he\u2019s the prime minister. He just works for the prime minister. People don\u2019t care if the MoD\u2019s daughter dresses in black or has a nose ring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, they do,\u201d she insists. \u201cThey notice and then your father has to field their questions. The Minister of Defense is a very important position to hold and people watch him. And when they see you acting like this, it\u2019s embarrassing.\u201d</p><p>I freeze and my eyes meet hers.</p><p>Fiery green gaze meets fiery green gaze.</p><p>\u201cSo, I\u2019m an embarrassment?\u201d</p><p>My mother freezes too and for a moment, I see uncertainty in her eyes, a hesitant waver. But then she steels herself again.</p><p>\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t you be?\u201d she demands harshly, all traces of the momentary softness gone. \u201cYou do everything you can possibly think of to embarrass us. And you do it on purpose. I don\u2019t know why you sound surprised. Yes, right now, you embarrass us.\u201d</p><p>I am quiet and still as I assess this. I never meant to embarrass them and it is a strange revelation. All I have ever wanted was to be left alone, left to dress how I want and act how I want. Is that really so much to ask?</p><p>Apparently so.</p><p>And it hits me like a brick wall.</p><p>I\u2019m not going to win this argument.</p><p>I am suddenly overwhelmed by frustration and anger and a little hurt, too. So I swallow hard, then swallow again. Then I walk right past my mother without saying a word. As I walk through my bedroom door, I grip the heavy wooden edge in my fingers and slam it as hard as I can.</p><p>The walls shake.</p><p>And I am satisfied with that.</p><p>I calmly stroll down the hall leading away from my bedroom, ignoring the shocked expression on a nearby maid\u2019s face. Yes, we have maids. And butlers. And pool boys. No, I don\u2019t like it. But apparently, my opinion is about as important as Monopoly money is in the real world.</p><p>My mother comes barreling out of my room, just like I knew she would.</p><p>If she had guns, they would be blazing.</p><p>\u201cWhere do you think you\u2019re going? We do not slam doors in this house, young lady.\u201d</p><p>I just did. But I don\u2019t say that.</p><p>I am silent and mulish and I keep walking.</p><p>Mom tags along at my heels like a rat terrier, but I still keep walking. She grabs at my elbow and I shake her off. She falls behind and stays there.</p><p>\u201cJust wait until your father comes home!\u201d she calls.</p><p>I have to laugh at that.</p><p>It would be a terrifying threat, if in fact, my father comes home.</p><p>But he won\u2019t.</p><p>Because he seldom does.</p><p>I keep walking. I know that I\u2019m being a spoiled bitch, but I can\u2019t see past my own annoyance at this point. This need of my mother\u2019s to force me into a perfect mold without any concern for my own wishes has come to a boiling point. I can\u2019t take it anymore.</p><p>I\u2019m going to snap.</p><p>And maybe kill somebody.</p><p>And I won\u2019t look good in an orange jumpsuit.</p><p>Or actually, I probably would. I do look lovely in orange.</p><p>But that\u2019s beside the point.</p><p>I climb into my little red Mercedes convertible and jab at the button that slides the top down. There\u2019s nothing like the wind in my hair as I speed too quickly along Caberra\u2019s scenic highways. And I always, always speed too quickly.</p><p>I shift into first, then squeal my tires as I tear out of our curved semi-circle driveway. Mom ought to like that. She can just add it to her list of things that she\u2019s pissed off about.</p><p>I can hear her voice in my head right now. Stanyos Giannis\u2019 daughter does not squeal her tires, young lady. You\u2019re an embarrassment.</p><p>And then I am embarrassed when I suddenly realize that hot tears are welling up in my eyes.</p><p>Damn it. I wipe at them quickly.</p><p>I hate that I let her get to me like this. This should not have escalated into the feud that it has become. It\u2019s just a freaking nose stud. I can take it out and the hole will grow closed. It\u2019s not the end of the world. My mother, my father and in fact, the entire world, can eff off.</p><p>I shift into third, then fourth gear as I speed along the highway that leads to Valese, the capitol of Caberra. We live ten minutes outside of town, in a sleepy house where nothing happens.</p><p>Ever.</p><p>Except for a few screaming matches between my mother and father and me. And that seems to be happening more and more lately. It\u2019s probably mostly my fault, but I can\u2019t bring myself to conform to their stupid rules. Why should I have to? I\u2019m not hurting anyone. Their stupid rules are stupid.</p><p>Asinine.</p><p>Ridiculous.</p><p>Pathetic.</p><p>The shoulder strap of my black tank top slips down and I yank it back up. I seriously wish that my best friend was here. But Reece went back to her home in Kansas for her senior year, taking another of my best friends, Dante Giliberti, with her. Dante\u2019s father is my father\u2019s boss, which makes Dante one of the few people in the world who knows exactly how I feel about these things. But he\u2019s gone now- a half a world away and I miss them both like crazy.</p><p>I fight the urge to pick up my phone and text Reece that very message. But these curves are too killer to text while driving. And I\u2019ve already texted her that little message about 200 times since she left a month ago. It didn\u2019t change anything. They\u2019re still there and I\u2019m still here.</p><p>Alone.</p><p>I can still feel my temper, right under the surface, boiling and hot. I\u2019ve got to calm myself down. But I don\u2019t have anyone to talk to. Reece was my only real friend, besides Dante and Gavin. And Gavin is away until tomorrow on a trip with his dad.</p><p>I\u2019m on my own, like usual.</p><p>And I\u2019m pissed off at the world.</p><p>Like usual.</p><p>I sigh and maneuver my car through the busy streets of Valese. Before I can even think about it, I find myself driving toward the sea. My favorite place in the world. I love everything about it. The vastness, the saltiness, the beauty. I love the taste of it on my lips and the feel of the sea breeze in my hair. I love being here because I know that I will smell like the sea for hours after I leave. The water always seems to calm me down. So, before I even know it, I have parked my car and am standing with my toes in the water.</p><p>I\u2019m not really sure how I got here.</p><p>Or why I am here.</p><p>But I\u2019m happy that I am.</p><p>Caberra is beautiful. I have to give it that. An island nation just a stone\u2019s throw from Greece, it is gorgeous and tranquil and ancient. I wiggle my toes in the wet sand and enjoy how the cool water laps at my ankles. If it weren\u2019t daylight, I might just strip off my clothes and go skinny-dipping.</p><p>But it is.</p><p>Daylight.</p><p>So I don\u2019t.</p><p>Even I won\u2019t go that far.</p><p>My parents would freaking kill me.</p><p>Instead, I sit down and situate myself in the sand, keeping my toes in the water. I watch my black-glittery-toenail bob in and out of the current and I try to zone out, to forget my current angst with my mother.</p><p>I\u2019m succeeding, too. That is, until a cowboy hat walks into my periphery.</p><p>No lie.</p><p>A cowboy hat.</p><p>In Caberra.</p><p>HolyFreakingHell.</p><p>I stop what I\u2019m doing, the zoning out into a vegetative state, and stare. I can\u2019t help myself. We don\u2019t have cowboys in Caberra.</p><p>But apparently, we do now.</p><p>A giant of a man, or a boy, or a man-boy, is striding over the rolling sand dunes of the beach wearing cowboy boots and a cowboy hat. That is striking enough in its own right. But the muscles on this guy, the guns. His biceps look as thick as my thighs. Which, as a thigh, isn\u2019t that big. But as an arm! It\u2019s enormous.</p><p>I gulp, then stare at him again.</p><p>He\u2019s got sandy-blonde hair peeking from under his hat and what looks like dark brown eyes. He\u2019s wearing a button-up blue and white checked cowboy shirt with the arms ripped off and Levi\u2019s that look like they were created just for him.</p><p>Wow.</p><p>Just wow.</p><p>He\u2019s like a handsome alien creature here in Caberra, where the average guy wears board shorts and flip-flops and carries a surf board like it\u2019s an accessory. And it intrigues me. He looks like the kind of guy who is no stranger to hard labor and I bet a dollar to doughnuts that he\u2019s got calluses on his hands.</p><p>My heart flutters.</p><p>And so I imagine myself reaching in, wrapping my hands around it and squashing it like a bug.</p><p>Because a girl like me doesn\u2019t get all fluttery over a boy.</p><p>Any boy.</p><p>Not even the tough, good-looking ones.</p><p>And he is that.</p><p>Wow.</p><p>He hasn\u2019t noticed me yet. I don\u2019t know why, unless the brim of his cowboy hat impairs his vision. Although to be fair, he is momentarily distracted by a horseshoe crab.</p><p>I watch with interest as he kneels beside it and examines it, his face only a foot or so from the little beast. He acts like he\u2019s never seen one before as he reaches out a finger and tentatively pokes it. It lies still and I wonder briefly if it is dead and has been washed in by the current.</p><p>He pokes at it again, probably wondering the same thing.</p><p>And then the thing lurches into life, scuttling in a haphazard direction directly at man-boy. Man-boy jumps backward in surprise, landing directly on his chiseled backside in the wet sand. The crab continues scuttling toward him, probably disoriented, and man-boy continues to scramble backward, kicking at the crab. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>In his cowboy boots.</p><p>I\u2019m dying with laughter and I am not quiet about it.</p><p>This is literally the funniest thing I\u2019ve seen in awhile.</p><p>Man-boy looks up and sees me laughing and glowers at me, which makes me laugh all the harder.</p> <p>My bad mood has been lifted at the sight of this cowboy\u2019s boots digging into the sand trying to escape a harmless horseshoe crab. For that, I should thank him.</p><p>So I do.</p><p>I get to my feet, brush off the sand and make my way over to him. I offer him my hand, which he takes and I pull him to his feet.</p><p>He smiles and his grin is slightly crooked, which I actually find endearing. He\u2019s not gorgeous in a perfect way, he\u2019s gorgeous in an interesting way. He\u2019s got sexy stubble gracing his jawline and his eyes sparkle.</p><p>He is even better looking up close and I smile back.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m Mia. And you\u2019re afraid of horseshoe crabs.\u201d</p><p>I speak in Caberran. Man-boy looks puzzled and holds his hands up.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t speak Caberran,\u201d he says apologetically in English. So I repeat myself in English. He smiles again, crooked and mischievous.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Quinn. And no, I\u2019m not. I\u2019m not afraid of anything.\u201d</p><p>I start to laugh, then freeze.</p><p>\u201cQuinn? As in, Reece\u2019s friend from Kansas?\u201d</p> <p>He grins again, cocky, self-assured.</p><p>\u201cThe very same. Quinn McKeyen. And you must be Mia, Reece\u2019s friend from Caberra. What a small world this must be.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s got a charming American accent.</p><p>And I might die.</p><p>I\u2019ve heard all about this guy. He\u2019s the one who Reece used to have a crush on, the guy who used to date Reece\u2019s friend Becca and who has come here to Caberra in the Foreign Exchange Student Program to live in Dante Giliberti\u2019s house.</p><p>I\u2019m such an idiot. Whether or not I want to get all fluttery over him, I have to admit that his crooked grin is fairly panty-dropping. I can\u2019t crush on my best friend\u2019s old crush. Can I?</p><p>But as I stare at him, at this man-boy with the chiseled country-boy body, his crooked grin begs to differ.</p><p>He raises an eyebrow. \u201cYou are the same Mia, right?\u201d</p> <p>I nod, willing my voice to begin working again. What the eff is wrong with me?</p><p>\u201cYes. I am.\u201d</p><p>He nods, his cowboy hat dipping in an attractive way.</p><p>He\u2019s like a retro Marlboro commercial.</p><p>But younger.</p><p>And hotter.</p><p>Holy freaking cow.</p><p>\u201cWell then. It\u2019s nice to meet you,\u201d he nods again and I notice that his eyes are warm and chocolately. I\u2019ve always preferred blue eyes. But I am changing that stance as of right this minute. Brown is my new blue. I\u2019m sure of it.</p><p>And then he turns around and walks away.</p><p>Wait.</p><p>Did that just happen?</p><p>I start to call after him, but then decide not to. I\u2019m not going to be one of those girls, the kind that chases after a good-looking guy simply because they\u2019re good looking. And Quinn is definitely that.</p><p>Good-looking.</p><p>Very, very good looking.</p><p>Awesomely, amazingly good looking.</p><p>I watch his strong, wide shoulders sway as he disappears over the sand dunes.</p><p>And later, after I return home and go to bed, I dream about his milk-chocately stare.</p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>To: Reece Ellis &gt;</p><p>[email protected]</p><p>From: Mia Giannis &gt;</p><p>[email protected]</p><p>Subject: HolyFreakingHotGuy</p><p>Reecie,</p><p>Soooooo.

Life sucks without Reece and Dante here. This year will freaking suck without them here. Going to school will suck without them here.</p><p>But today\u2019s the day. And there\u2019s nothing I can do about it.</p><p>Except get my butt into gear and take a shower.</p><p>And get ready for the first day of school.</p><p>I sigh again.</p><p>Hell.</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>The Piranhas are circling.</p><p>I watch them casually as my leg dangles from my open car door.</p><p>They are brightly colored, all with razor sharp teeth, all swarming in for the kill.</p><p>And they all have something in common. All of them think that they are better than everyone else because they have rich or important parents. Big deal. So do I. It\u2019s not all it\u2019s cracked up to be.</p><p>I should know. My life sucks.</p><p>In fact, I sort of hate my life.</p><p>Actually, not sort of. I do.</p><p>And I can\u2019t make myself get out and join them, not yet.</p><p>Because they might not be actual piranhas, but they may as well be.</p><p>The superficial girls are batting their eyes at cocky and arrogant boys, there is endless flirting and way too many noses in the air. Each one of those girls would stab me in the back quicker than they would even look at me. I know that. And it\u2019s all too much to deal with before breakfast.</p><p>Thankfully, the second bell hasn\u2019t even sounded, so I still have some precious alone time for just a few minutes more. I don\u2019t have to deal with these freaking barracudas yet.</p><p>\u201cHey Mia,\u201d a cheerful voice interrupts my solitude.</p><p>So scratch that. Alone time is over. But at least I haven\u2019t lost it to a barracuda.</p><p>\u201cHi Gavin,\u201d I turn and find Gavin Ariastasis.</p><p>As one of my best friends, I trust him because he\u2019s from the same exact position in life that I am in. Almost exactly. His father is Caberra\u2019s Minister of Interior, while mine is the Minister of Defense. Our lives are seriously effed up because of this. In fact, we might as well have our own little effed up club where we air out our own little effed up issues.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready for our last year?\u201d I ask absently, as I watch the fray in front of me. There\u2019s a certain first-day-of-school energy in the air today.</p><p>He laughs in response. Gavin is always laughing, actually. He\u2019s one of the happiest people I know. The world is a joke to him, a comedy, a play. And he\u2019s always in the center of the stage. But I like that about him. Everyone likes that about him. He doesn\u2019t take anything, including himself, too seriously.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ready for anything. Always,\u201d he announces to me.</p><p>One of the things I love the most about Gav is that he is so freaking cocky and self-assured. But he pulls it off in a likeable way, unlike most of these other cretins. That\u2019s why he\u2019s so likeable.</p><p>I laugh and stare up at him. He\u2019s good-looking in a very Caberran way. He\u2019s dark-haired, dark-eyed and carefree. And tan because he\u2019s always out in the sun. Like many of the other Caberran boys, he is a surfer. He was born to live in the sun. His eyes are almost always sparkling at some unsaid joke. But for some reason, I\u2019ve never been attracted to him even though he\u2019s gorgeous. I don\u2019t know why because it would be so convenient.</p><p>But I guess hearts don\u2019t care about convenience.</p><p>\u201cI see you\u2019ve altered your uniform,\u201d he observes.</p><p>I glance down at myself. I have the blue plaid skirt on, the black knee socks and the white button-up shirt on like I should. But I\u2019ve unbuttoned the top several buttons of my shirt and a black camisole peeks out. It\u2019s my homage to the rest of my wardrobe. Black, black, black. It fits my mood most of the time.</p><p>I even dye my hair jet black. Usually, much to my parents\u2019 chagrin, I add colorful streaks to it. Right now, as I told Reece, I have bright blue streaks. I figure I might as well coordinate with my school uniform.</p><p>I nod. \u201cIt\u2019s just a little thing.\u201d</p><p>A little tiny way to be an individual. But even a little of that kind of effort is considered too much around here.</p><p>Kolettis Academy does not exactly encourage individuality. It was founded by Antonio Kolettis, a Prime Minister from a few hundred years back, as the first private school in Valese. It is the private school now. Only the very rich, the very influential or the very powerful can get their kids in.</p><p>It\u2019s ironic that I spend my days day-dreaming about getting out.</p><p>But then, I\u2019m contrary like that. Or so my parents say.</p><p>Gavin nods. \u201cJust a little thing,\u201d he agrees. \u201cJust a little thing that Kanaris might send you home for.\u201d</p><p>He does have a point. The headmaster, Constantine Kanaris, does not deviate from the rules. Not for any reason, not at any time. It\u2019s exhausting. But it\u2019s a little bit fun to play with. He can\u2019t expel me. My father is the MoD of our entire country.</p><p>But that doesn\u2019t mean that Kanaris won\u2019t send me home to change. He\u2019s done it before, many times. He only wishes that the policy had some specifications about hair color. But it doesn\u2019t. So I can color my head like the rainbow if I choose to.</p><p>Take that, asshole.</p><p>Gavin holds out his arm. \u201cCome on,\u201d he urges me. \u201cYou can\u2019t stay out here all day.\u201d</p><p>I stare up at him. \u201cI can\u2019t?\u201d I ask. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>He grins. And entire countries could be leveled with that charming grin, I am sure. And once again I ponder why I\u2019m not attracted to him. It\u2019s probably because I\u2019ve seen him in diapers. That tends to squash sex appeal. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou can\u2019t,\u201d he reiterates cheerfully.</p><p>I sigh.</p><p>Then sigh again for good measure, just to make sure he heard me. Then I grab my bag, slam my car door shut and finally take Gavin\u2019s arm.</p><p>\u201cOkay, fine,\u201d I tell him. \u201cLet\u2019s get it over with.\u201d</p> <p>He stares down at me, his dark gaze twinkling. \u201cWell, when you put it so charmingly, how can I resist?\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes and he laughs. It\u2019s the story of our lives. I\u2019m the sarcastic one with the dry wit, he\u2019s the endlessly happy one.</p><p>One foot in front of the other.</p><p>That\u2019s what I tell myself as we wind our way through the throngs of chattering kids and into the halls of our school.</p><p>One foot in front of the other and then before I know it, the day will be over and I\u2019ll be back home. Which will be miserable too, but not as miserable as school.</p> <p>I hate my life.</p><p>It\u2019s official.</p><p>\u201cSo, have you heard from Dante?\u201d Gavin asks me as we stand in line to receive our locker numbers.</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cNot this week. But I got an email from Reece this morning. They don\u2019t start school until next week. Luckies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if they\u2019re so lucky,\u201d Gavin says as he drops me off at my locker. \u201cApparently, Kansas is hotter than Hades right now. And dusty. I got an email from Dante a couple of weeks ago. He said he\u2019s never seen so much dust outside of a desert.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would feel sorry for him, but... I don\u2019t,\u201d I say firmly. \u201cHe chose to go there. He could be here with us. It was his own decision.\u201d</p> <p>Gavin looks at me with amusement. \u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s feeling sorry for himself,\u201d he tells me. \u201cHe\u2019s pretty happy. I think he\u2019d be happy anywhere Reece is, though.\u201d</p><p>I know that\u2019s right. If anyone was made for each other, even while being complete and total opposites, it is Dante and Reece. I can\u2019t help but wonder how smooth, polished Dante Giliberti is fitting into a rural Midwestern American school. But then I put the thoughts aside. Dante can handle any situation. He was bred for it. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s totally fine.</p><p>Me, on the other hand...</p><p>I look around.</p><p>I\u2019m surrounded, completely and totally, by kids that I can\u2019t stand.</p><p>Heaven help me.</p><p>I put my stuff into my locker except for my Trig book and slam it closed. Whoever gave me Trig for my first class of the day, before I\u2019ve even had an ounce of caffeine, ought to be shot.</p><p>Right after they are drawn and quartered.</p> <p>With those charming thoughts in my head, I make my way toward class and slide into a seat by the window.</p><p>One thing about Kolettis Academy, is that it is very, very nice. We have state of the art equipment, top notch teachers and the very best of everything, all situated in an ancient, beautiful building. We still use the original stone school building, although the interior has been fully remodeled several times throughout the years. The windows are large and allow me to fully see outside, to get a perfect view of the beauty that I am missing this morning. I can see the sea from here, I hear the sea gulls flying overhead and I can hear the water. It makes me sigh. Because I\u2019m not there.</p><p>I\u2019m here.</p><p>In prison.</p><p>\u201cMiss Giannis?\u201d</p><p>Uh-oh. Mr. Priftis\u2019 tone leads me to believe that it\u2019s not the first time he\u2019s called for me.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>I turn my attention to him.</p><p>\u201cAre you awake, Miss Giannis?\u201d</p><p>Luckily, Mr. Priftis seems amused. I nod quickly.</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well,\u201d he smiles. \u201cI need you to share your textbook with Mr. McKeyen until I am able to order him one.\u201d</p><p>My heart lurches into my throat as I notice that Quinn, the one and the same, is seated next to me. He is all sprawled out, somehow fitting his large body into the smallish desk. How had I not noticed him arriving in this classroom? It\u2019s such a small room for such a big body.</p><p>My startled gaze is snared by his and I find amusement there. Calm down, I tell myself. He can\u2019t read your thoughts.</p><p>Or can he?</p><p>The amused expression on his face almost makes me think that he knows exactly how flustered he is making me.</p><p>\u201cMiss Giannis?\u201d</p><p>Mr. Priftis is less amused now and more concerned, his forehead wrinkled.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I answer quickly. \u201cOf course he can share my book.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent,\u201d Mr. Priftis answers as he returns to his desk. I turn to Quinn, Mr. RodeoGodHimself.</p><p>\u201cIf you scoot your desk over, you\u2019ll be able to see,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>Quinn extracts himself carefully from the desk and moves it, then sprawls out once again, but this time right next to me. I can smell him now, that freshly showered man smell and my stomach quivers.</p><p>I\u2019m annoyed with myself.</p><p>I do not react like this to a guy. Not ever.</p><p>Quinn grins lazily at me and my stomach quivers again.</p><p>GodBlessIt. Freaking traitorous stomach.</p><p>And I realize that he\u2019s not wearing his hat. Probably because it\u2019s against school rules to wear a hat on the premises. His hair is definitely sandy blond and it curls up slightly at the nape of his neck. It\u2019s also slightly unruly, but I suspect that\u2019s a good reflection of his personality. Unruly. Rebellious. Ornery.</p><p>His white button-up shirt is slightly loosened at the top and his navy blue tie is not quite straight. He\u2019s wearing his boots and they are currently crossed at his ankles. He manages to look casual and sexy in this sterile classroom setting. I decide it must be an art.</p><p>\u201cI like the stripes,\u201d he tells me, his dark eyes twinkling.</p><p>I stare at him for a moment until I realize that he means my hair. And before I can stop myself, I self-consciously run my fingers through a blue tendril.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I answer. I have no idea if he meant the compliment or if he was just using it as a way to point out that he noticed.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re very coordinated,\u201d he adds, gesturing toward my school uniform. I flush now. Because now he\u2019s teasing me.</p><p>I roll my eyes at him.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he asks innocently. But I can tell from his grin that he is anything but innocent. I flush again.</p><p>He looks at me quizzically, but Mr. Priftis starts his lecture and I turn my attention to him. It\u2019s difficult to ignore Quinn McSexy sitting next to me, particularly when I can feel his soft breath on my arm at times.</p><p>I gulp.</p><p>He smiles.</p><p>I die.</p><p>He winks.</p><p>He should look completely out of place. Because he is out of place even though he\u2019s wearing a uniform like everyone else, although his boots completely add a note of uniqueness to his outfit.</p><p>\u201cDo you own any other shoes?\u201d I whisper to him.</p><p>He stares down at me.</p><p>\u201cOf course. I own football cleats.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t play American football here,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>He looks chagrined.</p><p>\u201cI know. They didn\u2019t tell me that before I came here though.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m sitting next to an American clich\u00e9. A big, muscular, hometown football hero, probably.</p><p>To satisfy my curiosity, I ask, \u201cDid you play quarterback?\u201d</p><p>Because that would be the ultimate clich\u00e9.</p><p>But he shakes his head.</p><p>\u201cNo. I play full-back.\u201d</p><p>I have no idea what that is, but I nod as though I do.</p><p>And then the bell is ringing and I am grabbing my books, saved from having to pretend that I know something about a topic that I actually know nothing about.</p><p>As everyone bustles into the hall, Quinn is surrounded by people trying to talk to him. He is new here; a curiosity, a distraction. New always equals interesting, at least for awhile. And I find myself feeling jealous when I see a throng of other girls milling about him.</p><p>I saw him first.</p><p>I can\u2019t stop the uninvited territorial feeling from welling up inside of me. As if I know him and have a claim to him. And then I shake it away. He\u2019s not mine. That\u2019s ridiculous. He\u2019s not anyone\u2019s. He\u2019s a stranger here, just trying to fit in and get through his senior year in a strange and foreign place.</p><p>But Quinn stands a head taller than most people and as he turns his head, his gaze meets mine. And there is something there, a familiar pull, almost like he is clinging to me from across the hall because he is surrounded by strangers and he feels like he knows me.</p><p>But he doesn\u2019t.</p><p>And I don\u2019t know him.</p><p>So I break his gaze and walk away.</p><p>And I am surprised by how hard it is to do.</p><p>Chapter Four</p><p>From: Reece Ellis &gt;</p><p>[email protected]</p><p>To: Mia Giannis &gt;</p><p>[email protected]</p><p>Subject: First day?</p><p>M,</p><p>So how was your first day?? Did you see Quinn? How is he fitting into life on Caberra? I bet he sticks out like a sore thumb. I can sympathize, though. I was the same way.</p><p>It\u2019s hot here. Really, really freaking hot. Dante understands now why I call it Hell\u2019s Kitchen. School here starts next week, so Dante and I are school shopping today. I told him that he can\u2019t wear slacks here to school if he wants to fit in. But honestly, I can\u2019t picture him in Levi\u2019s, either. I\u2019ll take pics though and send them to you so you can see. It might be hi-lar-ious.</p><p>He came over yesterday and helped us throw hay bales. OMG. Regardless of what I tell him, he truly can fit in anywhere. My grandpa loves him.</p><p>I love you bunches and I miss you.</p><p>XOXO,</p><p>Reecie</p><p>My heart warms up as I read her message. I love that girl. She\u2019s my very first BFF and it doesn\u2019t matter that she\u2019s halfway across the world. But Christmas seems like a lifetime away right now.</p><p>I sigh and close my laptop.</p><p>I miss them both so much I can hardly stand it.</p><p>And now I\u2019m being pathetic again.</p><p>I can\u2019t seem to help it. Since my parents are always so wrapped up in their political and social bullshit, and they don\u2019t allow me to hang around with anyone who isn\u2019t \u201cappropriate\u201d, my circle of support is very limited. Dante, Reece and Gavin are all I have.</p><p>And that\u2019s not really that pathetic, I decide.</p><p>Because everybody needs somebody. No one is an island.</p><p>Right?</p><p>As if on cue, my cell phone buzzes from the pocket of my jeans which are in a pile on the floor. I reach from my bed and scoop it up.</p><p>\u201cGav?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you know it was me?\u201d</p><p>I can hear him smiling through the phone. And his eyes are probably sparkling. But that\u2019s a safe bet, because they\u2019re always sparkling. Gavin is always amused by something.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m magic,\u201d I say glibly. \u201cSee, there\u2019s this cool new thing technology. I can see a person\u2019s phone number when they call.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re hilarious, do you know that?\u201d Gavin grins again. Even though I can\u2019t see it, I know. I can\u2019t help but smile back, even though he can\u2019t see me.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I tell him. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d he answers. \u201cJust thought you might want to hang out today. Want to go diving?\u201d</p><p>The answer to that question is almost always yes.</p><p>Day or night.</p><p>I love scuba diving or snorkeling or pretty much anything that involves me swimming beneath the surface of the sea. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Today is no different.</p><p>\u201cSure thing,\u201d I tell him. \u201cI\u2019ll meet you at the pier in half an hour.\u201d</p><p>Which might be tricky since I\u2019m supposed to be grounded for mouthing off to my mother the other day about my stupid nose ring.</p><p>Hmm. Quandary.</p> <p>I\u2019ll have to put some thought into this.</p><p>But then I give up thinking about it and just leave.</p><p>What are they going to do to me? Take my birthday away?</p><p>I think not.</p><p>As I speed toward the beach, I do ponder the fact that I\u2019ve been such a bitch lately. And for just a moment, I feel bad for my mom. She\u2019s left alone most of the time, trying to fulfill the duties of a political wife. I might sit down and have a talk with her when I get back.</p> <p>Might.</p><p>If she doesn\u2019t kill me for leaving the house.</p><p>Which is unlikely.</p><p>So if I\u2019m still alive when I get back, I might talk to her.</p><p>I nose my car into a parking spot and grab my gear. I\u2019m so looking forward to this. There is nothing better for forgetting all of your problems than sinking below the surface of the sea where there is nothing but blue and solitude.</p><p>As I cross the boardwalk pier, I spot Gavin pulling on his wetsuit on the stern of his small boat, The Shining. The large motorboat was a sixteenth birthday gift to him from his parents and he named it because of his weird obsession with an old American movie of the same name.</p> <p>I can still remember popping popcorn and watching it with him over and over when we were in junior high. I\u2019ll never forget Jack Nicholson\u2019s creepy face as he peeked in the door of the creepy hotel. Ugh. I had nightmares for weeks.</p><p>Gavin might have issues buried behind his ever-present grin.</p><p>Who else would be that obsessed with such a strange movie?</p><p>I smile at him though and hop aboard, dropping my bag on the seat next to him.</p><p>He gives me a quick hug and the rubber of his suit sticks to my skin.</p><p>\u201cHey, Mi,\u201d he says easily. \u201cCheck out the current today.\u201d</p><p>I glance at the horizon and the waves are pretty tall, at least two to three feet.</p><p>\u201cIs there a wind advisory?\u201d I ask, not worried, but curious.</p> <p>He shakes his head. \u201cNot yet,\u201d he tells me. \u201cBut we\u2019d better hurry up and get out of the bay before there is.\u201d</p><p>I have to smile. He wants to hurry up and get out of the bay before the harbor master can tell him that it\u2019s too dangerous to go out today. Seriously, Gavin has no fear. He always just assumes that things will be okay. And I guess that\u2019s something that he and I share.</p><p>I usually feel the same way.</p><p>Things will always turn out okay because they always have.</p><p>Even this summer, when there was an assassination attempt on Dante\u2019s father and Dante himself was caught up in the same mess, everything turned out okay. And if something like that can work itself out, then pretty much anything else can work out too.</p><p>I know.</p><p>Skewed logic.</p><p>\u201cWell, let\u2019s hurry up then,\u201d I tell Gavin.</p><p>He grins his ornery grin. \u201cJust as soon as our guest arrives,\u201d he answers, glancing at his watch. \u201cHe should be here any minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuest?\u201d I raise an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Gavin answers. \u201cThe new guy. I felt sorry for him- he doesn\u2019t know anyone here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I feel like somebody kicked me in the stomach and I don\u2019t know why. \u201cReece\u2019s friend.\u201d</p><p>I have undefined feelings for this guy. I can\u2019t decide if I like that he gets my heart going or if I hate it. So right now, I\u2019m reserving the right to decide later. Honestly, that\u2019s better than my usual gut instinct to hate everything.</p><p>And in the meantime, I\u2019ll just enjoy looking at him.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Gavin nods. \u201cReece\u2019s friend. He seems nice enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, Reece always says that people from the American Midwest are the friendliest in the world,\u201d I answer absently. My eyes are glued to the pier, watching for Quinn.</p><p>Gavin notices.</p><p>\u201cDo you mind that I invited him?\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t know why he sounds surprised. I\u2019m not exactly what you would call a people person. It usually takes me a little while to warm up to someone.</p><p>\u201cNo, of course not,\u201d I say anyway. \u201cIt\u2019s your boat. You can invite anyone you\u2019d like. Except Elena, of course.\u201d</p><p>Gavin laughs at this. Elena Kontou is the notorious Mean Queen of our class. Her mother is in Dimitri Giliberti\u2019s Cabinet which has always put her into our select little group. But she\u2019s mean as a snake even though she has a perfect face.</p><p>Actually, make that had a perfect face.</p><p>Her cheek was scarred in the same yacht explosion that injured Dimitri Giliberti this past summer. She\u2019s had a couple of surgeries to correct it, but you can still see it. And she sort of blames me, because my sort-of-boyfriend at the time, Vincent, was the one who rigged the yacht to explode.</p><p>Have I mentioned that my life is complicated?</p><p>Yeah.</p><p>It is.</p><p>But now Vincent is waiting for his trial and Elena\u2019s face is still scarred. And she has to have someone to blame. And I\u2019m it.</p><p>Lucky me.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Gavin agrees. \u201cI will never invite Elena when you\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d invite her otherwise?\u201d</p><p>I am shocked by this notion.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a snake, Gav. And she can\u2019t swim. You shouldn\u2019t take her out on the water with you.\u201d</p><p>He starts to say something, but we\u2019re interrupted by an American drawl.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a snake, but I can\u2019t swim either. Is that a problem?\u201d</p><p>I look up to find the tips of two battered cowboy boots poking over the edge of the pier.</p><p>Quinn\u2019s gaze meets mine and I find that he is completely unembarrassed by this.</p><p>\u201cYou seriously can\u2019t swim?\u201d I ask, sure that he is kidding. \u201cEveryone can swim.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, they can\u2019t,\u201d he answers easily as he hops into the boat. \u201cApparently, the snake and I can\u2019t. Hey, dude,\u201d he greets Gavin. \u201cThank you again for the invite. I was going crazy at Giliberti House. I was starting to talk to myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem,\u201d Gavin slaps his shoulder and hands him a life jacket. \u201cYou\u2019d better wear this if you really can\u2019t swim.\u201d</p><p>Quinn takes off his shirt and I am instantly distracted by this.</p><p>HolySweetMotherOfGod.</p><p>What do they feed the boys in Kansas?</p><p>This guy is built like a lean brick house. I can easily count his ab muscles and they ripple every time he moves.</p><p>Holy. Cow.</p><p>He straps on the bright orange life jacket and looks down at me.</p><p>\u201cSee something you like?\u201d</p><p>And now he\u2019s cocky.</p><p>And I like it.</p><p>What is wrong with me that I like cockiness as a character trait?</p><p>I shake my head and lie. \u201cNope. Nothing in particular.\u201d</p><p>He grins, unabashed. \u201cWhatever you say.\u201d</p><p>His expression is knowing. And annoying.</p><p>\u201cLook, farmboy. I know that you\u2019re Mr. Hometown Football Hero back home, but here, you\u2019re not. So, you should start out your relationships with a little less ego. People will like you more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d he says, staring at me thoughtfully. \u201cKitten has claws.\u201d</p><p>Gavin is staring me in complete and utter surprise. I\u2019m not usually so bitchy and to be honest, I don\u2019t know what came over me. I shake my head and look away from both of them. Gavin takes the wheel and we\u2019re gliding our way out onto open water. Only now, the silence is sort of uncomfortable.</p><p>And it\u2019s my fault.</p><p>\u201cLook,\u201d I turn to Quinn. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m not that good with new people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d he answers innocently with that lopsided grin. \u201cI hadn\u2019t noticed.\u201d</p><p>Gavin busts out laughing and I have to laugh too.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really sorry,\u201d I say again. \u201cI guess I have trust issues with new people. It seems like so often they just want something from me. But I know that\u2019s not the case with you.\u201d</p><p>He eyes me up and down. And then leans in to murmur into my ear.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be so sure.\u201d</p><p>And my cheeks are instantly flushed.</p><p>OhMyWord.</p><p>Did he really just mean what I think he meant?</p><p>My eyes meet his and he nods, as if he could hear my unspoken question.</p><p>I\u2019m starting to feel like he can read my freaking mind.</p><p>And I\u2019m still blushing.</p><p>So I ignore him.</p><p>And my racing heart.</p><p>Good lord.</p><p>We race from the bay and out into open water while the waves toss The Shining about. We probably shouldn\u2019t be out here, but the dangerousness of it gives it a more exciting edge.</p><p>We\u2019re probably insane.</p><p>Gav looks at me. \u201cDo you want to go out to the wrecks or stick to the reef?\u201d</p><p>Either way, we\u2019d be insane. The wrecks, a collection of old sunken ships, are quite a ways from the bay and the waves will be crazy big there today. And the reef... well, let\u2019s just say that sharks enjoy the reef. A lot.</p><p>\u201cWrecks,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cDone,\u201d he grins.</p><p>He turns the boat into that direction and the wind blows my hair from my face.</p><p>I notice that Quinn is gripping the side pretty hard. So hard, in fact, that his fingers are white. Interesting. Is the Hometown Hero afraid of boats?</p><p>And then I feel bad for thinking of him as Hometown Hero. I decide that I will ask Reece about that before I do it again. I might be way off base, but I doubt it.</p><p>I turn my attention away from both of the guys onboard and instead, stare out at the water. I was right. The waves here are huge. No wonder Quinn is nervous. He\u2019s not used to the sea at all. And he can\u2019t swim. And since that\u2019s the case, I decide that he must be pretty brave to come out onto the sea in these waves in a little motorboat.</p><p>Or maybe stupid. I haven\u2019t decided yet.</p><p>I lean over and put my hand on his arm for a minute.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d I tell him with a grin. \u201cI won\u2019t let you drown.\u201d</p><p>He raises an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cHow would you save me, Tiny Tot? You\u2019re half my size.\u201d</p><p>And that is a true statement.</p><p>I eye him, at the way he is once again sprawled out, casually fitting himself into the boat seat.</p><p>\u201cHow tall are you, anyway?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201c6\u20196,\u201d he answers. \u201cI ate my spinach when I was growing up.\u201d</p><p>Holy crap. I practically am half his size. He\u2019s gigantic.</p><p>He leans over to me.</p><p>\u201cAnd I wear size 14 shoe. Do you know what they say about the size of a man\u2019s foot?\u201d</p><p>My cheeks flare into color.</p><p>Yes, I\u2019ve heard of the saying.</p><p>The size of a man\u2019s foot is supposed to be directly parallel to the size of his... um, male unit.</p><p>I can\u2019t even help myself.</p><p>I eye his foot.</p><p>And it is gigantic.</p><p>My eyes fly to his face and find that he is nodding again. And then he laughs.</p><p>Gavin is shaking his head. He\u2019s never seen me blush so much. That much is true. I\u2019m usually unflappable. But this guy. He gets to me.</p><p>And I\u2019ve almost decided that I hate it.</p><p>But the verdict is still out.</p><p>Because I might like it.</p><p>Gavin drops anchor and the waves really are crazy. The boat is rolling on top of them and I have a brief sense of hesitation. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShould we stay out here?\u201d I ask him hesitantly.</p><p>He looks at the water and shrugs.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re here now. Let\u2019s just take a quick dive and then we\u2019ll head in.\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cFine with me.\u201d</p> <p>I pull my wet suit on over my bathing suit and slide the mask onto my face. Gavin lifts the oxygen tank onto my back.</p><p>Quinn watches us prepare.</p><p>\u201cIs there anything I should be doing?\u201d he asks.</p><p>Gavin shakes his head. \u201cNope. The boat is anchored, so you won\u2019t go anywhere. We\u2019ll be back up shortly.\u201d</p><p>Quinn nods and Gavin grabs my hand and we jump over the side without hesitation.</p> <p>It is instantly calm beneath the water.</p><p>It is exactly why I love to dive.</p><p>Nothing can reach us here in the quiet underwater world. No troubles, no stress, no worry.</p><p>My flippers slide through the water with ease, propelling me downward. My hands cut through the crystal blue water and Gavin is right beside me. I glance upward and I can still see the outline of the boat above. It looks like a giant whale from here.</p><p>I turn my attention back to the water below me.</p><p>I can just see the moss-covered tip of a mast of a sunken galleon when a strange sensation ripples through my body. I stop moving and the sensation grows.</p> <p>It\u2019s a rumbling vibration, a weird shaking.</p><p>It\u2019s literally rolling through my body, like I\u2019m sitting in a car with the bass turned up too loud.</p><p>I look at Gavin, my eyes wide. He is frozen too, floating in place in the water.</p><p>Our eyes meet.</p><p>And then we notice that the sandy sediment on the sea floor is rolling toward us in murky billows.</p><p>What the eff?</p><p>The water continues to vibrate and shake around us and the moment that I think the word shake, it occurs to me.</p><p>Earthquake.</p> <p>Chapter Five</p><p>Gavin realizes it at the same moment that I do and we both spin and propel ourselves upwards.</p><p>HolyEffingEarthquake.</p><p>I burst from the surface of the water and grip the side of the boat and I can still feel the rumbling in the sea. In order for us to feel it all the way out here, the earthquake must be enormous. We haven\u2019t had a big one in years and years, way before my lifetime.</p><p>Gavin pulls himself over the side and then reaches over to give me a hand. I land on the floor of the boat in a clumsy heap and instantly start pulling off my stuff. My flippers, wetsuit and oxygen tank land in a pile.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Quinn asks. He can see the anxiety on our faces and I\u2019m sure he can see the vibrating water.</p><p>\u201cEarthquake,\u201d Gavin tells him. Gav isn\u2019t even undressing, he\u2019s turning the boat toward shore in his flippers, guiding the boat with capable hands.</p><p>Quinn looks startled and he stands up to look out at the horizon. But the rough water knocks him back down. He sprawls in a seat and stares at me in shock.</p><p>My heart thumps in my chest.</p><p>This isn\u2019t good.</p><p>And from the look on Gavin\u2019s face, the dead-serious expression that he never, ever gets, he knows it too. We\u2019re right in the middle of a serious situation, maybe even dire.</p><p>I gulp.</p><p>As we race toward the shore, jumping hard over waves, my teeth jar every time we land. We hit the water so hard that I can\u2019t believe the belly of the boat doesn\u2019t splinter into pieces. I grit my teeth and hold on.</p><p>Quinn is silent now and I almost wonder what he\u2019s thinking, but then I\u2019m distracted by trying to hold on to the things that keep trying to fly out of the boat, like life preservers, bags, flippers and so on. I\u2019ve never seen the current or waves so bad.</p><p>We fly into the bay and the way the boats are rolling on the waves as they sit in their slips is unnerving. They are haunting and spooky as they move with the sea. One of them has flipped onto its side and I know that it will sink. Water is flooding its deck. Debris is floating in the water; oars and cushions and cups and pieces of wood, and I am almost too afraid to look onto the shore.</p><p>But I do.</p><p>And I gasp.</p><p>The Harbor Master\u2019s building is in rubble, in an absolute shambles.</p><p>And the complete seriousness of this hits us.</p><p>\u201cHoly shit,\u201d Gavin breathes. He reaches over and grabs my hand as he noses us into his slip. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to move.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut where should we go?\u201d I ask as we scramble from the boat and onto dry land. The ground is not moving, but after a moment, I feel a short rumble.</p><p>Aftershocks.</p><p>They vibrate my feet and I gulp.</p><p>Even the air feels scary, like a premonition or foreboding. Or something. I try to ignore it.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Gavin admits. He climbs up beside me, then releases my hand to help Quinn from the swaying boat. \u201cSomewhere other than here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe should stay together,\u201d Quinn points out calmly.</p><p>He\u2019s right. And I say so.</p><p>There\u2019s no one else in the harbor, something that I find strange. Although, looking back, I realize that there wasn\u2019t really anyone here when we left. Everyone else was smart enough to not venture into the waves.</p><p>Gavin\u2019s cell phone rings and we look at each other, startled.</p><p>In the heat of the moment, we had forgotten that we had phones.</p><p>He picks it up and I can see the relief on his face as he talks to his mom. After a few moments, he hangs up and looks at me.</p><p>\u201cMy parents are fine. But the Earthquake was bad. Roads are blocked. My parents say to go to the Old Palace and wait there.\u201d</p><p>I gulp.</p><p>With shaking fingers, I pull out my phone. I try my house and there is no answer. I try again, and this time, I get a weird busy signal.</p><p>This can\u2019t be good.</p><p>\u201cGavin, I\u2019ve got to go to my house,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>He looks uncertain. \u201cBut my parents said we should wait at the Old Palace. I\u2019m sure yours would want you to do the same thing. Your father is probably there.\u201d</p><p>The Old Palace is the Capitol building of Caberra. It houses the courts, various government agencies and the Prime Minister\u2019s residence and it is where our fathers work. It is located in the heart of Valese and it is in the exact opposite direction of my house from here.</p><p>Quinn steps forward. \u201cSurely we can drive past Mia\u2019s house on the way to the Old Palace,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s only a little out of the way, right?\u201d</p><p>I am grateful for this. I am shaken and scared and it\u2019s nice to have someone back me up. Although, I\u2019m fairly certain that Gavin would have taken me anyway. He nods reluctantly now.</p><p>\u201cOkay. If the roads are passable. We have to watch for downed power lines, though. We don\u2019t want to get electrocuted.\u201d</p><p>I gulp again. I have the feeling this is going to be a national disaster.</p><p>As we walk to Gavin\u2019s car, a large black Land Rover, I try to call my house again. I get the weird busy signal again.</p><p>A heavy feeling settles in my stomach.</p><p>Something isn\u2019t right at my house.</p><p>I know it right now.</p><p>We drive in silence and from the passenger seat, I stare at the carnage from my window. Houses are in rubble everywhere. Beautiful ancient buildings and shiny modern ones too.</p><p>This can\u2019t be happening.</p><p>But it is.</p><p>Sirens wail and the entire scene seems to pass by in slow motion. I know it is because I\u2019m in shock. And anyone would be in shock. Gavin seems to be, too. Quinn is quiet in the backseat and we watch people walking aimlessly. Everyone seems astounded. People are dirty, their clothing torn.</p><p>Our home country is a wreck.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s probably a good thing we were on the water,\u201d Gavin says quietly. \u201cWe weren\u2019t in a building somewhere.\u201d</p><p>And then it hits me.</p><p>My parents don\u2019t know where I am.</p><p>I\u2019m supposed to be in my room, but I left.</p><p>I left without telling them.</p><p>My heart lodges in my throat and the guilt is unbearable.</p><p>We are able to drive through the carnage and reach my house. But when we get to the electric gates, they won\u2019t open when I punch in the code. And I realize that there must not be any power.</p><p>\u201cCan you give me a boost?\u201d I ask Quinn. He looks surprised.</p><p>\u201cYou want to climb over that?\u201d He eyes the tall brick wall. \u201cHow will you get back over?\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cI\u2019ll figure out how to push the gate open.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m coming with you,\u201d he says firmly, as he cups his hands for me to step into. I\u2019m surprised, because he doesn\u2019t know me or owe me anything. But I don\u2019t say anything. I step into his hands and he vaults me over the wall. He quickly follows me, and Gavin after him. The three of us make our way up my long driveway and I can\u2019t believe my eyes.</p><p>My house is in rubble.</p><p>Trees are down everywhere on the property and it truly looks like a warzone.</p><p>This.</p><p>Can\u2019t.</p><p>Be.</p><p>Happening.</p><p>Everything is still and silent. And then there is another rumbling aftershock and I can\u2019t help but gasp. The sound is noisy in the silence.</p><p>This is freaking insane. My crumbled house is like an eerie ghost town.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be fine,\u201d Quinn tells me quietly. His presence is calming. I hadn\u2019t noticed that before, but it is true. \u201cI promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you promise that?\u201d I ask him. \u201cYou don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do know.\u201d He nods confidently.</p><p>But I don\u2019t feel so confident.</p><p>Everything is spookily calm and quiet. I don\u2019t see my mom or even the servants, which is odd. It\u2019s only been half an hour since the quake. This causes a heavy feeling to lodge in my throat. Where are they?</p><p>I push through the rubble of my front door and find that everything is knocked down in my house. The walls, the ceiling, the doors. Wires are hanging haphazardly, chandeliers look hauntingly gaunt and skeletal as they hang limply in the air.</p><p>\u201cMom?\u201d I call out. My voice seems small in this silent chaos.</p><p>\u201cAdrianna?\u201d Gavin yells.</p><p>No answer.</p><p>I plow forward, pushing broken and jagged things out of my way.</p><p>Quinn grabs my arm.</p><p>\u201cBe careful,\u201d he warns me. \u201cThere could be exposed wires.\u201d</p><p>I gulp.</p><p>Then continue on.</p><p>My mom would have looked for me in this mess. She wouldn\u2019t have left, because she would think that I was under the rubble in my room. Because my room is where I\u2019m supposed to be.</p><p>My heart is heavy as I head down what is left of the hallway leading to my room.</p><p>There is no noise here but for the crackle and pop of debris.</p><p>\u201cMom?\u201d I call again, but my voice doesn\u2019t contain any hope. Because if my mother is here, she is unable to answer and I don\u2019t want to speculate on why that might be.</p><p>\u201cMia,\u201d Gavin says uncertainly as the building rumbles and moans around us. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be here. This isn\u2019t safe.\u201d</p><p>Even as he speaks, a piece of the hallway wall tumbles in front of us and Quinn yanks me out of the way.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d Gavin urges me. His eyes are anxious.</p><p>\u201cJust a minute,\u201d I insist. \u201cI just have to look inside of my room. That\u2019s where she would have gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have one minute,\u201d Gavin says firmly. I nod and he stays right on my heels. Quinn still has my elbow. And everything is a blur.</p><p>I\u2019m numb as I creep into the wreckage that used to house all of my most precious and personal things. Everything is in a mess now, all broken and torn and dirty. My bed is nonexistent. My clothing is scattered on the floor. I can\u2019t even fathom how strong this earthquake must have been to have done this much damage. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMom?\u201d I call again.</p><p>I climb over bricks that used to be walls and stumble on what is left of my bed.</p><p>I pull myself up onto my hands and knees and peer over what seems to be a mountain of wreckage.</p><p>And then the earth quakes again.</p> <p>It rumbles, low and loud, and I hear several pops and cracks from beneath me.</p><p>I don\u2019t know if it is a strong aftershock or another earthquake, but I hear Gavin yell and feel someone yank my arm right before there is a sharp pain in my temple and my vision explodes into a bright white light.</p><p>And then there is nothing at all.</p><p>Chapter Six</p><p>Something is annoying me.</p> <p>This is my first thought because it takes me a moment to place what it is.</p><p>Something is moving. It\u2019s disturbing me, waking me.</p><p>And then I realize that it\u2019s my own finger.</p><p>It\u2019s moving on its own accord, twitching against the side of my leg.</p><p>I try to open my eyes, but my eyelids feel heavy and tired, like they have been glued closed. I try again and then again, and finally, finally, they open.</p><p>Slowly.</p> <p>And the light hurts my eyes.</p><p>I can\u2019t focus.</p><p>Everything looks like blurry shapes and fuzzy outlines and I blink, trying to clear things up. It doesn\u2019t help. I blink again and it is so incredibly, frustratingly hard. My eyes don\u2019t want to cooperate. After a few minutes, I finally bring things into a slightly clearer focus, but it\u2019s not perfect.</p><p>But it\u2019s enough to see a figure sitting in a chair by the window.</p><p>It\u2019s a woman.</p><p>Her head is bowed and I think she is asleep.</p><p>I have no idea where I am.</p><p>\u201cMia!\u201d</p> <p>She wasn\u2019t asleep. The figure jumps to her feet and lunges to my side. Her face is anxious, frantic, hopeful. I stare at her in confusion.</p><p>Because I don\u2019t know her.</p><p>And then I realize something else.</p><p>I don\u2019t know me.</p><p>Alarm slams into me, causing me to panic.</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d I ask her wildly. \u201cWhere am I?\u201d</p><p>This can\u2019t be happening because I don\u2019t know who I am. My heart is speeding, pulsing, threatening to burst.</p><p>HolyHell.</p><p>HolyHell.</p><p>HolyHell.</p><p>I grab her hand and look into her eyes. They are green and startled and instantly concerned.</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d I beg her.</p><p>A tear drops from the corner of her eye.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m your mother,\u201d she answers uncertainly and she reaches for the call button. She presses it, but then runs for the door, calling for a nurse. And then she stops at a sofa on the way back to my bed, and she shakes someone\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>And I realize that someone is lying there. A man. And I didn\u2019t even see him before. I wipe at my eyes and realize that they are covered in goop. I wipe at them again and my vision clears a little.</p><p>The man approaches me with my mother, the mother that I don\u2019t remember and don\u2019t know, and he looks concerned. He\u2019s tall and dark and has silver at his temples.</p><p>And I don\u2019t know him, either.</p><p>\u201cMia,\u201d he begins. \u201cDo you know who you are? Do you remember what happened?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m panicky again. It feels like butterflies are banging their wings against my ribcage, trying to get out. I don\u2019t blame them. I want to get out too.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I answer uncertainly. \u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m your father,\u201d the strange man answers calmly. But he is interrupted by a nurse who comes through the door. When she sees that I am awake, she approaches me quickly, checking my pulse and looking into my eyes. She wipes the rest of the goop away and now I can see.</p><p>My mother is crying and telling the nurse that I don\u2019t know her.</p><p>And the nurse looks at me.</p><p>\u201cDo you know who you are?\u201d she asks gently.</p><p>I shake my head and my mother cries harder.</p><p>\u201cDo you remember anything that happened?\u201d the nurse asks.</p><p>I shake my head again.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s alright,\u201d she tells me and she pats my hand. \u201cEverything will be alright.\u201d</p><p>Will it?</p><p>Because my parents are standing next to me and I don\u2019t seem to remember them. And I don\u2019t remember me, either.</p><p>And I don\u2019t see how in the world that can be alright.</p><p>I\u2019m getting very, very panicky.</p><p>A doctor comes in a few minutes later. He pokes and prods at me, too, in all the same places as the nurse.</p><p>He looks into my eyes and listens to my heart and nods.</p><p>\u201cI hear that you don\u2019t remember very much,\u201d he tells me. I nod.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d he tells me. \u201cYou\u2019ve suffered a head injury. Your brain was swollen and you were placed in a medically induced coma to protect you. We reduced your medication yesterday and you woke up on your own accord today. Physically, you are fine, so do not worry about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t I remember anything?\u201d I whisper.</p><p>The doctor\u2019s eyes are kind.</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019ve had a trauma,\u201d he tells me. \u201cAs the swelling continues to decrease, your memory may come back. As time passes, it may come back that way too. Memory loss as a result of brain trauma is a tricky thing. But you are surrounded by people who love you and I have confidence that you will be fine.\u201d</p><p>I swallow hard and my throat is sore. The doctor notices me wincing.</p><p>\u201cYou had a breathing tube,\u201d he tells me. \u201cYou might notice some tracheal tenderness for a day or two.\u201d</p><p>Tracheal tenderness. That sounds so medical.</p><p>I am still for a moment. My memory is a strange thing. As I think, I can remember bits and pieces of things. I see a car. A red convertible. I think it\u2019s mine, but it might not be. I see a boat. I see underwater murkiness. But there is nothing else.</p><p>I look at my mother.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry that I don\u2019t remember you,\u201d I tell her politely.</p><p>She cries.</p><p>\u201cAdrianna,\u201d my father says sternly. \u201cMia doesn\u2019t need this right now.\u201d He pats her back awkwardly and I note that. My father isn\u2019t great with affection, apparently. \u201cYou need to be strong.\u201d</p><p>She nods, but she\u2019s still crying.</p><p>\u201cWhat is my full name?\u201d I ask my father. He looks slightly pained.</p><p>\u201cMia Alexandria Giannis,\u201d he tells me. The name doesn\u2019t mean anything to me. Nothing at all. It doesn\u2019t feel like me. But then again, I don\u2019t know me.</p><p>\u201cYour middle name is after my mother,\u201d he adds. \u201cYour grandmother. You are very much like her. Very strong-willed and independent.\u201d</p><p>Strong willed?</p><p>I wonder about this. I don\u2019t feel strong willed right this moment. I feel confused and tired. And weak. I don\u2019t like the feeling.</p><p>\u201cYou should rest,\u201d my father tells me. And I realize that I don\u2019t even know his name. So I ask and he looks pained again.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Stanyos,\u201d he tells me. \u201cStanyos Alexander Giannis.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter your mother?\u201d I guess. He smiles and nods.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s satisfied with me for some reason. I\u2019ve done something right, but I don\u2019t know what. Maybe he\u2019s just proud of me that I woke up.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d I ask. Because I realize that I have no idea what happened to put me into this condition.</p><p>\u201cThere was an earthquake,\u201d my mother pipes up. Her eyes are red from crying. \u201cYou were grounded. And you sneaked away to go scuba diving. But that\u2019s a good thing. If you\u2019d been in your room like you were supposed to be when the quake happened, you might have been killed. For once, your rebelliousness was a good thing.\u201d</p><p>She sounds a little bitter and my father gives her a hard look.</p><p>\u201cAdrianna.\u201d</p><p>She lowers her eyes and I know that I\u2019m missing something. But I\u2019m too tired to worry about it.</p><p>\u201cSo I like to scuba dive?\u201d</p><p>My father smiles again.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s your favorite thing in the world.\u201d</p><p>That makes sense. I only have a handful of memories that I can recall and they involve the water. I tell them that. My father smiles, my mother does not. She seems very upset about something that I don\u2019t understand. But again, I\u2019m too tired to make sense of it now.</p><p>I tell them this, that I am so very tired. And they tell me to get some sleep, that they aren\u2019t going anywhere.</p><p>So I close my eyes. But when you are a in a place that you don\u2019t know, with strangers watching your every move and when, in fact, you don\u2019t even know who you are... it is very hard to sleep.</p><p>But I\u2019m going to give it the old college try.</p><p>And then I realize that I have no idea where that saying came from. Somewhere from the back recesses of my mind, probably.</p><p>I can tell already that this getting my memory back thing is going to be a long process.</p><p>Sigh.</p><p>Chapter Seven</p><p>Days pass in a blur of strange faces and visitors.</p><p>Apparently, all of my friends from school come to see me, all of the ones who weren\u2019t also injured in the earthquake. And I don\u2019t recognize any of them.</p><p>The strange thing is that I know what everything around me is. I know the television, the bed, the bathroom, my slippers. I recognize how those things work. It\u2019s like my memory has holes in it. I remember some things but everything else just dropped out of existence, like I never knew it at all. It\u2019s frustrating.</p><p>Also, apparently, I like red jello. It\u2019s pretty much all I want to eat right now. The meat on my tray makes me want to gag.</p><p>My mother sighs.</p><p>\u201cMia, you\u2019re not a vegetarian. You\u2019ve never been a vegetarian. Just eat your food, alright? You need the strength and you\u2019re not going to get it from jello alone.\u201d</p><p>I stare at her.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I should have been a vegetarian,\u201d I announce, laying my spoon down and putting the cover back over my tray. I don\u2019t even want to look at the greenish tinted hospital chicken. (Who in their right mind would eat that??) \u201cAnd maybe I\u2019ll become one now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMia,\u201d my mother sighs again. \u201cWhat has gotten into you today? You\u2019re not normally like this.... so obstinate.\u201d</p><p>I stare at her again. I\u2019m not? So, I don\u2019t usually have opinions? I must have been a very boring person. I\u2019m prevented from responding by another visitor.</p><p>\u201cMia\u2019s being obstinate? How out of character,\u201d a dark-haired guy says wryly. He steps into the room and I wrack my brain. I was introduced to him a few days ago. Gavin. His name is Gavin. And we were-are- good friends.</p><p>Apparently.</p><p>\u201cHi Gavin,\u201d I tell him. I smile politely. It\u2019s hard to pretend to be good friends with someone that I don\u2019t remember. They all tell me that they understand, but there\u2019s no way that they can. I just hope that I don\u2019t accidentally hurt someone\u2019s feelings by forgetting them.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Gavin tells me. He pulls up a chair next to me and I examine him. Dark hair, dark brown eyes, mischievous smile. Crisp white button-down shirt, open at the top, fancy blue jeans, flip-flops. He\u2019s gorgeous. My tummy gets a little fluttery when he picks up my hand as if he knows me.</p><p>Then I remember, he does know me.</p><p>I just don\u2019t know him.</p><p>\u201cHow do you feel today?\u201d he asks. \u201cAre you driving the nurses crazy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, she is not,\u201d My mother says firmly, even though clearly the question was meant for me. \u201cShe\u2019s being polite and courteous, as she should be.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Gavin looks at me. There is confusion and a bit of amusement in his dark eyes, but he quickly masks it. He\u2019s good at this, at smoothing things over. I make a note of that.</p><p>\u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d he asks again. He\u2019s still holding my hand and his fingers are warm. I like it. I may not know him, but I like his hand. \u201cHave they let you outdoors yet for a walk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d I tell him. \u201cI feel good enough though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you shall go,\u201d he tells me valiantly. He picks up the call button and a moment later a nurse appears.</p> <p>\u201cYes?\u201d she asks pleasantly. Gavin smiles at her, with a knee-weakening grin.</p><p>\u201cMiss Giannis would love to go for a walk in the sunshine,\u201d he says. \u201cWould that be possible? I\u2019ll walk with her.\u201d</p><p>My gaze meets his and his eyes are sparkling. It\u2019s no wonder he and I were good friends. He\u2019s very likeable.</p><p>The nurse smiles at him. No one is impervious to his charms, apparently.</p><p>\u201cShe has already been cleared for a walk outside,\u201d the nurse tells him. \u201cShe just hasn\u2019t wanted to go.\u201d</p> <p>Gavin turns to me. \u201cNo? Put your clothes on, Mia . We\u2019re going outside.\u201d</p><p>I stare at him. \u201cI sort of don\u2019t want to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd why not?\u201d he looks at me. \u201cBecause you\u2019d rather lay in here and feel sorry for yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Yes.</p><p>Gavin raises an eyebrow. \u201cNo? That\u2019s not what I\u2019ve been told.\u201d</p> <p>I look to my mother and she appears guilty.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been talking about me?\u201d I ask softly. This actually hurts. I\u2019ve been trying really hard this week\u2014to do what everyone has asked of me. And she\u2019s been talking about me?</p><p>\u201cNo. Yes. I mean, I have, but only because I\u2019m concerned about you,\u201d she stammers. \u201cGavin has always been able to cheer you up, so I called him.\u201d</p><p>I stare at her, but Gavin interrupts.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to go outside for a minute, so get your clothes on. We\u2019re getting some fresh air.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you always been this bossy?\u201d I ask him. He grins.</p><p>\u201cWhy, yes. Yes, I have. And you like it.\u201d He saunters out, not worried in the slightest that I might actually be agitated with him.</p><p>My mother follows him out and I feel my temper bubbling just beneath the surface. But I tamp it down. I\u2019m sure they\u2019re just concerned. Right?</p> <p>Whatever.</p><p>I swing my legs over the side of the bed and sit for a second. Obviously, I\u2019ve been out of bed here in the room to shower and use the bathroom and whatnot. But the idea of going outside, out into the hospital and into the world and the sunshine, has made me terrified.</p><p>I don\u2019t want to admit that to anyone because I feel silly.</p><p>But it\u2019s the truth.</p><p>I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the accident, or if I\u2019ve always been that way.</p><p>Who\u2019s to say?</p><p>Certainly not me.</p><p>I can\u2019t remember anything.</p><p>I pull on some clothing. A khaki skirt and a cream-colored blouse. A pair of tan ballet flats. These clothes feel foreign. I can\u2019t believe I would choose clothing so bland. And so...beige. But apparently, I did.</p><p>Apparently, I was a bland person.</p><p>And I use the word apparently a lot.</p><p>I pull a brush through my hair and stare in the mirror.</p><p>Dark brown hair, green eyes. I\u2019m sort of small. Not small in a weird, misshapen way, but small, nonetheless. I guess I\u2019m pretty, although I look a bit pale from being indoors. I probably should get some sun. Some vitamin D therapy might improve my attitude, too.</p><p>For some reason, I feel so agitated. My mother tells me that it\u2019s very unusual for me, that I\u2019m usually a very cheerful person, but that a certain level of agitation is normal given the circumstances.</p><p>I don\u2019t know about that.</p><p>But then, I don\u2019t know about anything right now.</p><p>And I\u2019m back to that again. Sigh.</p><p>I poke my head out into the hall and find my mother and Gavin talking to each other against the wall.</p><p>I fight back the feeling of annoyance that rises in me, the bad taste that is in my mouth.</p><p>What the eff?</p><p>If he\u2019s my friend, why is he in cahoots with my mother?</p><p>And where the heck did I get a word like cahoots?</p><p>Can\u2019t my friend talk to my mother? I\u2019m clearly a lunatic. I wonder if I was before this accident, too, or if it\u2019s a new thing.</p><p>I\u2019m shaking my head when they notice me.</p><p>Gavin smiles.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready?\u201d</p><p>His smile is a thousand-watt light-bulb and I relax. I\u2019m being hypersensitive, I\u2019m sure. That\u2019s probably normal, given the circumstances.</p><p>Gavin holds his arm out and they both smile at me.</p><p>And once again, I am uneasy, but don\u2019t know why.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ready,\u201d I confirm, as I slip my arms around his forearm. My mother falls back into my room as Gavin and I make our way down the hall and out of the hospital.</p><p>The sun hits me squarely in the face and I blink my eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d Gavin asks quietly. He has apparently noticed that my feet are now frozen to the ground and I am refusing to move from this spot.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I mumble. \u201cI just feel intimidated by coming out here. I don\u2019t know why. It makes me feel sort of panicky.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m such a baby.</p><p>I look around, at the shrubbery in the hospital courtyard, at the benches filled with visitors and patients, at the flowers, the grass, at the wide open blue sky above us. And all I can do is to try and still my racing heart. I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m so anxious about this place. It\u2019s irrational.</p><p>\u201cYou know,\u201d Gavin says quietly as he leads me around the path. \u201cWe were here last year. Our friend Dante had a car accident. And when we came here, we weren\u2019t sure exactly what we were going to find. We knew he was alive and they told us that he was okay, but we didn\u2019t really believe it until we saw it for ourselves. Maybe that\u2019s it. Maybe you have some suppressed memories deep down about that time. It was pretty emotional. It was one of the only times I\u2019ve seen you cry.\u201d</p><p>I look at him. The sun is shining onto his face, illuminating his already bright smile. He\u2019s a gorgeous guy, that much is true. Strong, good-looking and self-assured. That\u2019s a good recipe for destruction.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t cry?\u201d I ask hesitantly. That doesn\u2019t seem right. Because right now, I feel like a blubbering mess on the inside. Gavin shakes his head.</p><p>\u201cNot usually. You\u2019re pretty bad-ass.\u201d</p><p>I have to smile at that. \u201cBad ass?\u201d</p><p>He nods. \u201cYup. Totally bad-ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me why you say that,\u201d I instruct him.</p><p>We continue walking around the pretty landscaped sidewalk as Gavin tells me escapades of my youth, beginning from the time we were in primary school. He speaks smoothly and calmly as we walk around patients who are walking slower than we are.</p><p>\u201cAnd then there was the time that you got the assistant principal at school fired- when we were only in fourth grade. You thought he discriminated against you because he was a pacifist and your father was the minister of defense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he discriminate against me?\u201d I ask, with my eyebrow raised.</p><p>Gavin nods. \u201cIt sure seemed like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, I\u2019m ballsy.\u201d</p><p>Gavin laughs. \u201cYes, you\u2019re ballsy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you and I such good friends? Have we always been? Have we ever dated?\u201d</p><p>Gavin stares at me.</p><p>\u201cYou truly don\u2019t remember anything, do you?\u201d he asks softly. There is sympathy in his eyes and I hate that. I\u2019m not asking for sympathy. I\u2019m just trying to learn more about myself.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t feel sorry for me, Gav,\u201dI tell him. \u201cI don\u2019t need sympathy.\u201d</p><p>He stares at me again.</p><p>\u201cYou just called me Gav,\u201d he points out quietly. \u201cI haven\u2019t told you that you used to do that.\u201d</p><p>I am instantly still. Holy crap. He\u2019s right.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know where that came from,\u201d I admit. \u201cIt just came out. It felt natural.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s your memory,\u201d Gavin decides confidently. \u201cSubconsciously, in there somewhere, you know me.\u201d He grins. \u201cBecause seriously, dude, how could you truly forget me?\u201d</p><p>He is cocky and arrogant and pleasingly so. I smile back.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. It\u2019s like I got hit on the head or something. Oh, wait. I did.\u201d</p><p>He laughs and I laugh and it suddenly seems normal to hang out with him. Relaxed. Friendly. Normal. I\u2019m digging it. So I tell him that.</p><p>He looks surprised.</p><p>\u201cDid you doubt that you would?\u201d He is cocky again. \u201cYour favorite time of the day is always Gavin Time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGavin Time?\u201d I repeat doubtfully. \u201cAre you always this sure of yourself?\u201d I ask, one eyebrow cocked. He laughs. He tightens his grip on my elbow and I enjoy the feeling of his warm fingers on my skin.</p><p>\u201cAlways,\u201d he says, leaning in toward me like he\u2019s confiding something. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the things you love about me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I love things about you, then?\u201d I ask, laughing.</p><p>Gavin smiles. \u201cOf course you do. Everyone does.\u201d</p><p>He winks and laughs and I laugh again.</p><p>\u201cHave we ever had sex?\u201d I ask. Gavin\u2019s head snaps back and he stares at me again, his eyes sparkling and appraising.</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d he says. \u201cWould you like to?\u201d</p><p>He nudges me and laughs, but now I\u2019m on a mission to find out things about myself that my mother probably wouldn\u2019t know, so I ignore his charming grin.</p><p>\u201cAm I a virgin?\u201d I ask hesitantly. \u201cDo you know?\u201d</p><p>He stares at me yet again, but this time he actually seems uncomfortable. If it was possible to squirm while standing in an upright position, he\u2019d totally be doing it. It makes me uneasy.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I ask. \u201cAm I a slut?\u201d</p><p>He rolls his eyes. \u201cNo. You\u2019re not a slut. Far from it. But you\u2019re not a virgin, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut we haven\u2019t had sex?\u201d I ask again. He winks.</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I have a boyfriend?\u201d I ask uncertainly. Because if I do, I certainly don\u2019t remember it.</p><p>Gavin looks unsettled and ignores my question.</p><p>\u201cYou know,\u201d he muses. \u201cI could have totally played this whole situation to my advantage. Let\u2019s start over again. Ask me again if you are a virgin.\u201d</p><p>I smile. \u201cAm I a virgin?\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head solemnly. \u201cNo. You\u2019re not. You and I have wild, passionate jungle sex about four times a day. You love it. And we should probably take it back up again. I think it would help your recovery process to get back into your normal routine.\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes and giggle, ignoring the disapproving look of an elderly lady with a walker.</p><p>\u201cOnly four times a day?\u201d I ask innocently. \u201cAre we slackers, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, don\u2019t tempt me,\u201d Gavin answers. \u201cWe can increase the rate. I\u2019m up for anything. Anytime, anywhere. That\u2019s practically my motto. Always ready. I should get that tattooed somewhere. Maybe on my ass.\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSeriously. Do I have a boyfriend? Besides you, I mean,\u201d I amend quickly. He smiles.</p><p>\u201cNo. You don\u2019t. Not anymore.\u201d</p><p>He looks rattled now, like he wishes he wouldn\u2019t have added that last part.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I ask. \u201cNot anymore? Who was I with? We broke up?\u201d</p> <p>Gavin is definitely uncomfortable now. He looks away and puts a lot of effort into steering me around a slower walker. I stop in the middle of the path and put my hands on my hips.</p><p>\u201cGavin, seriously. Just tell me. My mom doesn\u2019t seem to want to talk about any of this stuff.\u201d And I had tried several times over the course of the past week. She just changed the subject and told me that I was an honor student and was a joy as a daughter, etc, etc. She laid it on so thick that I\u2019m actually a little suspicious of all of it.</p><p>Gavin sighs.</p><p>\u201cYou did have a boyfriend, of sorts. You told me that you weren\u2019t in love with him, that you were in lust with him. He took your virginity and used you to get information. And then he tried to kill our best friends and the Prime Minister of Caberra.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Eight</p> <p>\u201cHoly shit,\u201d I breathe, staring at Gavin. \u201cYou aren\u2019t joking.\u201d</p><p>Gavin shakes his head, his normally cheerful demeanor suddenly very serious.</p><p>\u201cI wish I were,\u201d he answers. \u201cBut I\u2019m not. Vincent Dranias was your boyfriend. You trusted him. And he screwed you over. He\u2019s in jail now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJail?\u201d I whisper. My eyes are watery and I\u2019m annoyed by that. Apparently, I\u2019m not supposed to cry. I\u2019m a bad ass. I wipe at my eyes impatiently.</p><p>\u201cJail,\u201d Gavin confirms. \u201cHe\u2019s eighteen, so he is being tried as an adult. The whole thing isn\u2019t over...these court cases usually go on forever. But he\u2019s in jail for the duration and I can guess that he will be there forever. You can\u2019t try to assassinate the prime minister and not pay the consequences.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I brought that guy into our lives? So it was my fault?\u201d</p> <p>I am horrified at this notion, even though I don\u2019t remember Dante or his father or our lives right now. Gavin shakes his head.</p><p>\u201cNo. You didn\u2019t bring him into our lives. Another one of our friends, Nate Gerraris, did. His father used to be Dante\u2019s father\u2019s Deputy Prime Minister. It was all a plot by Nate to try and get his father promoted to Dimitri\u2019s job. You were collateral damage. They used you to get close to Dante.\u201d He stares at me. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not sure.</p><p>\u201cDoes Dante hate me?\u201d I whisper. I don\u2019t remember Dante, but I certainly don\u2019t want one of my good friends to hate me. And my freaking emotions are going to be the death of me today. Only a lunatic would be paranoid that a friend that she can\u2019t even remember hates her. I\u2019m not in love with myself right now. That much is true.</p><p>Gavin grabs my arm and guides me to a bench nearby.</p><p>\u201cOf course he doesn\u2019t hate you,\u201d he says firmly as we sit. The wood is hard beneath my thighs, but I welcome it. It\u2019s a nice distraction from the confused mess that my brain has become.</p><p>\u201cI know you don\u2019t remember him right now. Or me, either,\u201d Gavin continues. \u201cBut I know that you will. One of these days. And until then, just take my word for it when I say that we are your real friends. We have been friends since we were toddlers. No one understands us like we understand each other. Dante would never be mad at you for getting taken advantage of. He was more pissed than anyone that you were used.\u201d</p><p>Gavin is fierce now and it seems out of his character. I tug on his arm to get his attention.</p> <p>\u201cCalm down,\u201d I tell him. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. I believe you.\u201d</p><p>His face relaxes and he smiles down at me.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he says. \u201cI get worked up sometimes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can see that,\u201d I answer. \u201cBut that\u2019s good. It means you\u2019re passionate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, baby, you have no idea,\u201d he replies, cocky once again. I pick up his hand and study it, noting his smooth fingers. He doesn\u2019t do manual labor, that much is apparent.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t stay serious for long, do you?\u201d I ask, glancing back up at his face.</p><p>His eyes are serious now, even though he grins. \u201cWhat is the point in that?\u201d he answers. \u201cThere is enough serious shit in the world. I don\u2019t need to be a party to it. We see it around us all of the time. There is no need to take ourselves seriously, too.\u201d</p><p>And in this moment, I see something in Gavin that I wonder if I ever saw before, pre-head-injury.</p><p>He\u2019s not as cocky or as happy-go-lucky on the inside as he pretends to be. He wants to be, but he isn\u2019t. So he chooses to act like it instead.</p><p>Interesting.</p><p>\u201cDo we have hard lives?\u201d I ask, instead of pointing out my new revelation. Gavin laughs.</p><p>\u201cSeriously? Our fathers are both in the parliamentary cabinet of the prime minister. We want for nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I asked,\u201d I point out. \u201cOur lives... are they hard?\u201d</p><p>Gavin stares at me for just a moment before he shrugs, then looks away.</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t always easy. But we make it work. We\u2019ve been brought up this way and it is what we know.\u201d</p><p>His answer is very telling, as is the very diplomatic way he delivers it.</p><p>We\u2019re the children of politicians. It\u2019s can\u2019t be fun but Gavin is so stoic about it, so matter of fact. It\u2019s impressive. So I tell him that.</p><p>He shakes his head and helps me to my feet.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not impressive,\u201d he tells me. \u201cIt\u2019s just the way it is, Mi. You\u2019re the same way. Well, you used to be. Although, you\u2019re more of a rebel than I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, I\u2019m a bad ass rebel now?\u201d I tease. He nods.</p><p>\u201cYou always have been. Your latest thing was hilarious.\u201d</p><p>We step back into the hospital and immediately I breathe in the sterile air, which makes me want to gag.</p><p>\u201cMy latest thing?\u201d I repeat as Gavin punches at the elevator button.</p><p>He nods. \u201cYep. You were into wearing black all the time and dying your hair crazy colors. You even had your nose pierced\u2014right before your accident. It was driving your mom insane.\u201d</p><p>I subconsciously pull at a tendril of my dark hair. \u201cMy hair isn\u2019t dyed now and I don\u2019t have a nose ring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Gavin answers as he puts a hand on the door to make sure it stays open while everyone steps on. \u201cWhen I came to visit you for the first time after the accident, your hair color had been changed and the stud in your nose had been taken out. You weren\u2019t even awake yet.\u201d</p><p>I stare at him. So that meant that my parents had dyed my hair while I was still in a coma? What the eff? Changing my hair color was a priority for them while the state of my health was still in the air?</p><p>Gavin sees my expression and shrugs.</p><p>\u201cPolitical family,\u201d he reminds me.</p><p>I think it\u2019s possible that I\u2019m going to hate my new life.</p><p>And my old life.</p><p>As we get off on my floor, Gavin turns to me.</p><p>\u201cMia, everything is what we make it. You hated all of the pressure placed on you by your father\u2019s job. You railed against it all of the time- but that only put more stress on you than necessary. The hole in your nose has grown closed because it was such a new piercing. It\u2019s like it never happened. So, why not use that to your advantage? If you just go with the flow like I do, everything is so much easier. You don\u2019t need stress right now. You need to relax so that your brain can recover from your injury. Seriously.\u201d</p><p>I stare at him. \u201cAre you telling me to fall into the whole rank and file thing and do what everyone tells me?\u201d</p><p>He grimaces.</p><p>\u201cIt sounds bad when you put it that way.\u201d He pulls me to the side, out of the way of the scurrying nurses and orderlies. \u201cAll I\u2019m saying is... relax and go with the flow. I want you to get better and your doctor says that you need to relax to do it. My phone number is in your phone. Call me whenever you need to.\u201d</p><p>My phone. I had forgotten that I had one. And my mother certainly hadn\u2019t given it to me over the course of the last week. I wonder if it was destroyed in the earthquake?</p><p>But instead of saying anything, I just nod.</p><p>\u201cOkay. Thank you, Gavin. I feel more normal today than I have since I woke up and I know that it is because of you. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>Gavin smiles beatifically and my knees momentarily weaken. He truly is gorgeous. He leans forward and kisses my cheek.</p><p>\u201cAnything for you, Mi,\u201d he says. \u201cSeriously.\u201d</p><p>And then he\u2019s gone. I\u2019m standing in the middle of the hall by myself, watching his cocky back retreat to the elevators. Yes, even his back is cocky. And strong. I gulp.</p><p>He turns before he gets on the elevator and grins one last time. I gulp again before I smile back.</p><p>After the elevator doors swallow him up, I truly do feel alone. He knew me. The real me. Not the me that my mother is trying to make me believe that I am. Suddenly, all I want is for him to come back, to sit by my bed and hold my hand and make everything okay.</p><p>But that\u2019s impossible, because everything isn\u2019t okay.</p><p>So with a sigh, I return to my room and find my mother doing a crossword puzzle in her chair. When I enter, she smiles.</p><p>\u201cHow was your walk, sweetheart?\u201d she asks. \u201cAre you tired now? Would you like to lie down?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cNo, I feel good. The fresh air was nice and it was good to talk with Gavin. Mom, do you have my phone?\u201d</p><p>She freezes for a second and I don\u2019t know why. But then she relaxes.</p><p>\u201cOf course, sweetie. I\u2019ve kept it in my purse. I didn\u2019t know if you\u2019d be up to looking at your old pictures or whatnot.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s acting strange, but I put it out of my mind. Who am I to say if she\u2019s acting strange? I don\u2019t remember her prior to this week.</p><p>She hands me my phone. It\u2019s in a hot pink case with a black and white skull on the back. The skull has a pink bow on its head. That makes me smile.</p><p>I power it on, but then am startled by a password screen.</p><p>I don\u2019t remember the password, because I don\u2019t remember anything. I look at my mom and she\u2019s already shaking her head.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know it, sweetheart. You were always very protective of it. You\u2019re a pretty private person.\u201d</p><p>Eff.</p><p>I am utterly dejected. Until I remember something. Gavin knows everything about me. Maybe he would know this. So I ask my mother for his number and I use her phone to call him.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d he answers.</p><p>\u201cGav,\u201d I reply. \u201cDo you know the password to my cell phone?\u201d</p><p>There is a pause.</p><p>\u201cNot for sure,\u201d he finally says. \u201cBut you usually use your birthdate for everything. I think it\u2019s your debit card pin number and your combination to your locker at school. So you might want to try that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d I mutter. \u201cThat would be helpful if I knew my birthday.\u201d</p><p>I sigh and Gavin chuckles.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s May 17th, so try 1705,\u201d he tells me. \u201cAnd you\u2019re seventeen years old.\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes. \u201cI already knew that part.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Because they\u2019d already told me.</p><p>\u201cHow much do you actually know about me?\u201d I ask him. I can\u2019t help but smile. It really does feel good to know that at least someone remembers important things about my life. He laughs.</p><p>\u201cI pretty much know everything,\u201d he confirms. \u201cAnd if I don\u2019t know it, then Reece does.\u201d</p><p>Reece. The best friend that I can\u2019t remember.</p> <p>I sigh again, trying to place her face in my head, but failing. I thank Gavin and hang up, picking up my phone once again. I punch in my birthday and Gavin was right. It opens right up.</p><p>A picture of me and a blonde girl stares back at me from my screensaver. Her slender arm is wrapped around my shoulders. My hair is two shades darker than it is right now and there are bright pink stripes threaded through it. The blonde girl is gorgeous with white blonde high-lights and sparkling blue eyes. We\u2019re both holding up the \u201crock on\u201d signal with our hands and grinning into the camera. I don\u2019t know who took the picture and in fact, I don\u2019t remember taking the picture at all.</p><p>Because this is the story of my life now.</p><p>I\u2019m perpetually clueless.</p><p>I turn the phone towards my mom.</p> <p>\u201cIs this Reece?\u201d</p><p>My mother almost flinches before she nods.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t like Reece?\u201d I ask curiously. My mother shakes her head.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that. Reece is a charming girl. I just don\u2019t think that she understands what it\u2019s like to be you. I worry about the influence she has on you. You should be around kids who understand.\u201d</p><p>I am confused.</p><p>\u201cKids who understand what?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cKids who understand what it is like to be you,\u201d she says firmly but still vaguely. \u201cAn important member of Caberran society.\u201d</p><p>My mom sure does think a lot of herself and our family. Important members of society? I sigh.</p><p>\u201cSo it\u2019s not okay to have friends that aren\u2019t from here?\u201d</p><p>My mother practically grits her teeth.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I said, Mia. I just said that I prefer it when you hang around with kids who understand you. Like Dante or Gavin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDante\u2019s not here,\u201d I remind her. \u201cAre you saying that you only want me to hang around with Gavin?\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s my mother\u2019s turn to sigh.</p><p>\u201cNo. Stop putting words in my mouth. I\u2019d like it if you hung around with Elena Kontou, also, but you don\u2019t seem to want to. I don\u2019t know why. She\u2019s a lovely girl who knows what it\u2019s like to be a girl in your position. Plus, you really should mend fences with her.\u201d</p> <p>I stare at her. \u201cMend fences?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVincent Dranias, that boy who you snuck around with and dated, is the reason her face was scarred. You\u2019ve never apologized for that.\u201d</p><p>I suck in a breath.</p><p>\u201cGavin told me that it wasn\u2019t my fault. That Vincent completely deceived me. Why then, would I need to apologize? I\u2019m honestly asking\u2014because I don\u2019t remember anything. And was she badly hurt in that explosion?\u201d</p><p>My mother pats my hand.</p><p>\u201cNo, it wasn\u2019t your fault. But Elena seems to think that you brought that boy into everyone\u2019s lives. You really should take the time to explain that you didn\u2019t. That you were deceived along with everyone else. And no, she wasn\u2019t seriously injured, but her cheek was scarred. And she is a beautiful girl. She\u2019s taking it hard. In fact, I believe she\u2019s here in the hospital right now. She\u2019s undergoing a series of surgeries to repair the scar.\u201d</p><p>I am quiet. \u201cI would like to talk to her and to apologize for any hand that I had in the whole mess. But the problem is, I don\u2019t remember any of it. How can I apologize for something that I don\u2019t remember?\u201d</p><p>My mom offers me a little smile. A tight, tight smile.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, Mia,\u201d she sighs. \u201cBut maybe you should try talking to her and just see what happens. We can get her room number from the nurse.\u201d</p><p>I nod and she leaves the room, presumably to talk with the nurse. I continue looking through my phone. I have hundreds of pictures. Reece and I are in many of them. We\u2019re on a boat, we\u2019re by the beach, we\u2019re in a bedroom. In one, we\u2019re dressed in green matching shirts, presumably from work. Gavin told me that I work for Dante\u2019s father. It looks like we are great friends.</p><p>There are pictures of Gavin. There are pictures of Gavin and I together. And there are pictures of us with another boy. A really, really handsome blonde boy who has to be Dante.</p><p>Dante Giliberti.</p><p>I look at the handsome face smiling at me from my phone and I wonder how I could possibly not remember him. He\u2019s movie star handsome. I should remember him. But I don\u2019t.</p><p>I scroll through the other faces in the pictures and I don\u2019t remember any of them, either. Charming Reece Ellis. Cocky Gavin Ariastasis. Gorgeous Dante Giliberti. I should know them. I should have their faces memorized.</p><p>But I don\u2019t.</p><p>And it is oh-so-frustrating.</p><p>I am practically growling when my mom returns.</p><p>\u201cRoom 402,\u201d she tells me. \u201cElena\u2019s on the fourth floor. She\u2019s here only for today and then she\u2019ll be gone. So you should go see her now while you have the chance.\u201d</p><p>I am hesitant, but my mom is insistent.</p><p>\u201cMia,\u201d she says patiently. \u201cYou have known Elena since you were children. You shouldn\u2019t let a misunderstanding like this ruin things. Just go and speak with her. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be pleasantly surprised.\u201d</p><p>I am still unsure, but I go anyway. How can I not? I have to make sense out of my life somehow. I should begin by piecing it back together.</p><p>I creep out into the hall and take a big mouthful of the medicinal hospital smell. It smells like iodine and alcohol and plastic. I hate it. But I timidly make my way through the bustling corridors and sterile halls until I find myself standing in front of room 402.</p><p>I stand there for a few minutes, trying to get my courage up.</p><p>You can do this.</p><p>You can do this.</p><p>You can effing do this.</p><p>My hand shakes and I silently cuss myself out. Listen, you. I don\u2019t know who you used to be. But I know that you are not such a wuss. You are a badass. Buck the eff up.</p><p>I knock lightly and there is no answer. I knock harder.</p><p>\u201cCome in,\u201d an annoyed voice calls. I swallow hard and stick my shoulders back. I don\u2019t know who I used to be, but I don\u2019t like feeling intimidated by anyone now. My chin juts out and I push the door open.</p><p>A beautiful girl lies in the bed, covered up to her waist by blankets. She\u2019s got hair the deepest shade of red that flows in soft waves over her shoulders. Her eyes are emerald green and narrowed as she looks at me. And there is a bandage on her cheekbone, marring what would otherwise be a perfect face. She\u2019s breathtakingly beautiful. And she looks like she hates me.</p><p>I gulp.</p><p>\u201cElena?\u201d I ask, although I\u2019m sure it is. Who else could it be?</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she answers coolly in a voice that borders on hatred. \u201cWere you expecting someone else?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cNo. I just wanted to sure.\u201d</p><p>Elena smiles a frigid smile that reminds me slightly of a piranha. I don\u2019t know why because her smile is gorgeous and perfect.</p><p>And cold.</p><p>Just like the rest of her.</p><p>\u201cAh, yes. I forgot. You can\u2019t remember anything.\u201d</p><p>She doesn\u2019t look disturbed by that at all. She seems ambivalent, actually.</p><p>Even though she hasn\u2019t invited me, I walk inside and sit in the chair next to her bed. She has fashion magazines everywhere, so I move them to clear a space.</p><p>\u201cMy mother told me that you and I have a misunderstanding and that I should clear it up,\u201d I tell her. \u201cBut I don\u2019t remember anything. So it\u2019s hard to know what to say.\u201d</p><p>Elena studies me with interest. \u201cYou truly don\u2019t remember anything at all?\u201d she asks. \u201cNot a thing?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cNot much at all. I remember my car. And I don\u2019t know why. I remember scuba diving. But I don\u2019t remember my friends. I don\u2019t remember my parents and I don\u2019t remember myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you don\u2019t remember me?\u201d Elena asks, her lovely head cocked. I shake my head again. \u201cYou don\u2019t remember growing up with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m sorry. I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>And she laughs. I am startled by this and stare. It definitely wasn\u2019t the reaction that I was expecting.</p><p>She muffles her giggles and then stares back.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s not funny. It\u2019s ironic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow is it ironic?\u201d I ask suspiciously. I don\u2019t know what to make of this girl.</p><p>Elena giggles again. I\u2019m not sure if she\u2019s laughing at me or with me or what.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve always worked so hard to portray an image... the image of a girl who doesn\u2019t care about who she is. And here you are now... you don\u2019t remember any of it. You truly don\u2019t know who you are. Don\u2019t you find that funny at all?\u201d</p><p>And suddenly, I kind of do.</p><p>I laugh with her.</p><p>\u201cIf I remembered it, it would be funnier,\u201d I finally tell her. \u201cBut I don\u2019t. I saw pictures\u2014of my hair and my clothes. I guess I was trying hard to prove a point.\u201d</p><p>Elena nods. \u201cYou definitely were trying to make a point.\u201d</p><p>I look at her and try not to look at her bandage. But it\u2019s hard. It might as well have a sign on it that says Look at me. My eyes keep gravitating toward it. I force them back to hers.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I tell her. \u201cFor whatever part I played in the accident. I\u2019m told that I didn\u2019t know what was going on, that I was tricked along with everyone else. But if there were signs that I should have seen and didn\u2019t, I\u2019m really sorry about that.\u201d</p><p>Elena\u2019s nose tilts up and I wonder if this is the moment that she\u2019s going to let me have it. She\u2019s got a certain bitchy air about her...she\u2019s definitely a girl who knows what she wants and how to get it. She doesn\u2019t mess around. I may have amnesia, but even I can see that.</p><p>And she is silent for a long, long moment. I think she\u2019s trying to make up her mind.</p><p>\u201cI was pissed at you,\u201d she finally admits to me. And she sounds surprisingly candid. \u201cBut I was pissed at everyone, to be honest. I know that it wasn\u2019t you who did this to me. It was Nate Geraris and Vincent Dranias. It\u2019s just difficult to be mad at people who aren\u2019t here. I seem to need something- or someone- that I can focus my aggression on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou might want to take up target shooting instead,\u201d I tell her wryly. She laughs.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone wants to see a gun in my hand,\u201d she admits. She seems more honest than I was expecting. Although I don\u2019t know why I had any expectations at all. I don\u2019t remember her.</p><p>OhmyGod. I\u2019m so tired of that phrase. I don\u2019t remember. I get it already. I\u2019m clueless about everything.</p><p>\u201cWere we friends?\u201d I ask curiously. \u201cMy mother said that we didn\u2019t hang out much, but that she didn\u2019t know why. But I\u2019m guessing that my mother didn\u2019t know everything there was to know about me, either.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Elena stares at me silently. She\u2019s examining me, picking me apart. But why?</p><p>\u201cNo, we weren\u2019t very good friends,\u201d she tells me finally. \u201cI don\u2019t know why. I guess I\u2019m not always a nice person. And you never tolerated any crap. That intimidated me.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m an intimidating bad ass?</p><p>I\u2019m not sure that I like me very much.</p> <p>\u201cSo you were the mean girl and I was the bad ass?\u201d I guess. She smiles slowly.</p><p>\u201cI suppose so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mother thinks that I should try to be friends with you,\u201d I tell her bluntly. \u201cBecause you understand what it\u2019s like to be me\u2014a child of a political family. Do you want to be friends?\u201d</p><p>Elena stares at me in surprise. I can tell that she doesn\u2019t know what to say. She wasn\u2019t expecting this from me. But I wasn\u2019t expecting any of this from her, either, so I guess we\u2019re even.</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re certainly not any less blunt,\u201d she observes. \u201cYou\u2019ve always said exactly what was on your mind. Okay, Mia. We can try to be friends. It should be interesting.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d I answer quietly. \u201cIt should be interesting.\u201d</p><p>We chat for a little while longer and it seems uncomfortable, but it gets easier toward the end. I finally make my way toward the door and close it behind me. I exhale a long breath and lean against it.</p><p>Why do I feel like I just made a deal with the devil?</p><p>That\u2019s ridiculous. Right?</p><p>Elena might have red hair, but she\u2019s not the devil.</p><p>I spend the rest of the walk to my own room trying to convince myself of that.</p> <p>Chapter Nine</p><p>I press my face against the glass of my mother\u2019s car. I leave a nose print, but I don\u2019t care. The hills of Caberra speed past us as my mom winds through the curvy roads toward Giliberti House.</p><p>Apparently, our house is uninhabitable and will have to be re-built in order for us to return home. Until then, my mother and I will be staying at Dimitri Giliberti\u2019s family home, Giliberti House. It is located in a huge estate surrounded by olive groves outside of Valese.</p><p>Also apparently, I\u2019ve been there a million times before because that is where I work...in their gift shop. I sell gourmet olive oils and whatnot. And I say \u2018whatnot\u2019 because I have no idea what else I sell there. Sigh.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re almost there,\u201d my mom says. I know she\u2019s assuming that my sigh was a result of being in the car. \u201cYou\u2019ll see the olive groves soon.\u201d</p><p>And I do. We round one more curve and I see hundreds of olive trees, their lush green tops touching the sky. The olives look like pebbles on the branches.</p><p>\u201cYour father will come out on the weekends,\u201d my mother tells me. \u201cHe\u2019s going to stay in the city during the week for work reasons. He\u2019s worried about you, though. He\u2019s hoping that the peace and quiet out here will help you relax and recover more quickly.\u201d</p><p>Him and me both.</p> <p>I\u2019m sick of this whole can\u2019t-remember-who-I-am-thing.</p><p>I nod wordlessly, taking in the scenery as my mother turns into a long, long drive. Flowering trees line each side and white blossoms drift through the air, padding the stone lane beneath us with a thick blanket of petals. It looks like a painting. I take a whiff of the sweet-smelling air.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s gorgeous here, right?\u201d my mother asks, lifting an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I agree. \u201cIt is.\u201d</p><p>She pulls into a circular drive and we get out of the car. The house is amazingly beautiful, like something out of a fancy fairytale. Warm light floods from the windows onto the manicured lawn around it. It draws me to it and makes me want to run into the house.</p><p>A tiny little woman comes out, stooped and elderly. But she moves quickly. She is down the stairs before I can even speak. Her hair is pulled into a neat chignon at the nape of her neck.</p><p>\u201cMia!\u201d she cries out and barrels into me, grasping me up into a surprisingly strong bear hug. She smells like cookies. And maybe sunshine.</p><p>I look at her blankly, wish-wish-wishing that I could place her. Because she clearly knows me. She looks at me sympathetically.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, sweet girl,\u201d she tells me, taking a step backward. \u201cI forgot that you don\u2019t remember me. My name is Marionette Papou. I run this household for the Gilibertis. You know me very well, little one. I\u2019ve known you since you were in pigtails. But you will remember. I have faith in that.\u201d</p><p>She is confident. I like that.</p><p>She turns and greets my mother and then her husband, Darius, introduces himself to me before he gets our bags. They both move surprisingly quickly for being older. And I am surprised again when Marionette tells me that Darius is the foreman for the olive groves. They have both worked here for decades, apparently, and they have no intentions of slowing down anytime soon.</p><p>They lead us into the massive house and I immediately feel welcomed, like I am home. The house is immaculately furnished, but it is cozy even as it is magnificent and enormous. It is the kind of place where families live and thrive. I feel instantly at ease.</p><p>Marionette smiles.</p><p>\u201cI have a treat for you,\u201d she tells me with a grin. \u201cYour favorite.\u201d</p><p>I have no idea what my favorite is, but I follow her anyway.</p><p>I\u2019m trusting that way, I guess.</p><p>As Darius takes our bags upstairs to our rooms, Marionette leads us to the kitchen. Wonderful smells surround us and I inhale deeply.</p><p>She hands me a saucer and shoves me into a chair.</p><p>\u201cYour favorite,\u201d she tells me again as I look at the little fancy plate. There is a forest green G inscribed on the china rim. A flaky croissant drizzled in butter instantly makes my mouth water. \u201cI make them from scratch,\u201d she adds proudly.</p><p>I take a bite and instantly am in love with Marionette. I tell her that and she laughs.</p><p>\u201cOh, you fell in love with me long ago, little one,\u201d she grins, before she pats my arm and glides away to wipe off a cabinet. \u201cI\u2019m French. Everyone loves me.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t know what that has to do with anything, but it makes me smile anyway. I consider that as I look around. This kitchen reminds me of a giant farm kitchen, but is filled with every modern convenience. It\u2019s comfortable in here. I could stay in here forever.</p><p>My mother, however, must feel differently.</p><p>\u201cMia, I\u2019m going to go unpack,\u201d she tells me. \u201cIf you need me, Marionette will show you to my room.\u201d</p><p>I nod and watch her walk away. She doesn\u2019t seem very happy to be here. But then again, she doesn\u2019t seem all that happy to be anywhere. I wonder why. And then I wonder if I ever knew why.</p><p>Marionette watches me.</p><p>\u201cYour mother worries about you,\u201d she says quietly. \u201cI know you don\u2019t believe that, but it is true.\u201d</p><p>I am startled. \u201cI don\u2019t believe that?\u201d I ask curiously. \u201cDo my mom and I have issues?\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s Marionette\u2019s turn to look startled, like a cat who swallowed a canary.</p><p>\u201cUh. Not necessarily,\u201d she says slowly. \u201cJust typical teenager and mother things. Nothing big.\u201d</p><p>But she turns and focuses very hard on cleaning the already spotless stone counters. I narrow my eyes suspiciously, but I don\u2019t say anything. Clearly, she doesn\u2019t want to say anything else.</p><p>\u201cIs it alright if I go for a walk outside?\u201d I ask her politely. She turns and smiles.</p><p>\u201cLittle girl, you don\u2019t have to ask permission. This is your home, for as long as you need it to be. Feel free to walk anywhere you would like to walk.\u201d</p><p>I smile and impulsively turn and hug her. She\u2019s the warmest person that I\u2019ve met so far. She seems surprised, but she hugs me back tightly. Her tiny arms are surprisingly strong.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good to have you here,\u201d she tells me and I swear that her faded eyes are wet. But she turns away again before I can tell for sure.</p><p>I make my way outside through the back terrace doors.</p><p>I look around and sigh contentedly. If there was ever a nirvana, this is it. Giliberti House is like an oasis in the middle of the country. Rolling hills surround us, swaying trees encircle us and the smell of fresh flowers assails my senses. It\u2019s an enchanting place.</p><p>And then I hear it.</p><p>Whistling.</p><p>A song with no words and no real melody.</p><p>I perk my ears and try to find where it is coming from.</p><p>I walk past the back gardens and over the shady lane leading down to what looks to be a set of barns. And then I see him.</p><p>Sweet. Mother. Of Mary.</p><p>A muscular guy with sandy blonde hair is shirtless and there are so many muscles rippling that I can\u2019t even count them all. He is working with a gigantic horse and he is whistling.</p><p>And I am panting.</p><p>Holy crap.</p><p>Do I know this guy??</p><p>I am frozen as I watch his biceps flex and move. He looks to be about my age. He\u2019s got broad shoulders, slim hips and he\u2019s really tall. He\u2019s wearing cowboy boots.</p><p>Cowboy boots.</p><p>Who is he??</p><p>My curiosity is firmly piqued, so I decide to just find out. I approach him and after a second, he notices me and stops what he is doing.</p><p>And then he grins a grin so devastating, I think it might stop my heart.</p><p>No. Lie.</p><p>\u201cMia!\u201d he calls.</p><p>Holy crap. I do know him. Or he knows me, anyway. I watch as he grabs a cowboy hat that is hanging on a fence post and slaps it on his head as he hops over the fence to the paddock. He reaches me in literally five long strides and then crunches me in a bear hug.</p><p>I want to die right here, I think.</p><p>In the safety of his strong arms.</p><p>I will stay here for the next sixty years and die a happy woman.</p><p>But obviously, after a second, he steps away and I fight the urge to cling to him. He feels so safe and warm. And clearly I am craving security. I might want to see a therapist about that.</p><p>\u201cYou look great!\u201d he tells me with a grin. \u201cYour stripes are gone, though.\u201d</p><p>I automatically run my fingers through my hair. \u201cI know. I don\u2019t... I don\u2019t remember them.\u201d</p><p>Hot Guy looks pensive.</p><p>\u201cI bet you don\u2019t remember me, either, do you?\u201d he asks softly. I am hesitant, because I really, really wish that I did. But I don\u2019t. So I shake my head.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I tell him. \u201cMaybe soon. They keep telling me that my memories should come back soon. I\u2019m starting to hate that word, actually. Soon. It\u2019s so vague.\u201d</p><p>Hot Guy holds his hand out.</p><p>\u201cMy name is Quinn McKeyen,\u201d he tells me as he shakes my hand formally. \u201cI\u2019m living here at Giliberti House for the school year. I\u2019m in the Foreign Exchange Student program. I\u2019m from Kansas- which is the state in America where your friend Reece is from. Do you remember Reece?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head again. \u201cI don\u2019t remember anything at all,\u201d I admit.</p><p>He actually smiles. \u201cI\u2019m going to have to think of some way to use that to my advantage,\u201d he says with a wink. I shake my head.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t even try it,\u201d I laugh. \u201cGavin already tried, but unfortunately for him, he didn\u2019t think about it fast enough. He told me about the state of my love life before-hand. That was a little counter-productive.\u201d</p><p>Quinn laughs again. And I decide that I might not know him, but I freaking love his laugh. And his American accent. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAre you a cowboy?\u201d I ask him, eyeing the way that sweat is rolling off his abdomen. I fight the urge to lick it.</p><p>Gross. Lick sweat? What is wrong with me?</p><p>Am I a freak?</p><p>He smiles. \u201cYes, I guess you could say that. I like to ride things. Does that make you nervous?\u201d</p> <p>I stare him blankly. \u201cNervous? Why would I be...oh.\u201d His meaning hits me like a truck and I blush. \u201cI get it. You like to ride things.\u201d</p><p>I smile, even though I\u2019m pretty sure my mom would kill me for engaging in this conversation. But what she doesn\u2019t know won\u2019t hurt her, right?</p><p>\u201cAnd, no,\u201d I add. \u201cI\u2019m not nervous. I can handle anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you don\u2019t even know who you are,\u201d Quinn reminds me with another grin. \u201cSo how can you handle anything?\u201d</p><p>I love the fact that he doesn\u2019t pussy-foot around me. Everyone else has been and it has grown so annoying. I don\u2019t need to be handled with kid gloves. I\u2019m not going to break.</p> <p>\u201cTrue,\u201d I concede. \u201cWhat all do you ride, beside women and horses?\u201d</p><p>Quinn\u2019s dark eyes sparkle. And I find myself transfixed by that. His eyes are such a dark brown, like a rich gourmet chocolate. I\u2019m mesmerized by them.</p><p>\u201cI ride four-wheelers, horses, bulls, you name it. But I haven\u2019t seen any bulls in Caberra yet, so I\u2019ve settled for Titan. Dante bought him for Reece when they were still here. She told me that I can mess with him.\u201d</p><p>He gestures toward the enormous devil of a horse behind him. I eye the beast cautiously.</p><p>\u201cTitan looks a little dangerous,\u201d I point out. Quinn only grins. He\u2019s so relaxed in his worn-out jeans and boots. He\u2019s like the epitome of country charm. I gulp.</p><p>\u201cOh, I sort of like a little danger from time to time,\u201d he tells me. \u201cIt keeps things interesting.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, really?\u201d I shake my head. \u201cIt\u2019s all fun and games until you wind up in the hospital.\u201d</p><p>Quinn laughs. \u201cI\u2019m very good at handling danger, so don\u2019t worry. Everything will be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill it?\u201d I ask and Quinn nods.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>And I don\u2019t even know what we\u2019re talking about anymore. I\u2019ve been distracted by his handsome good looks and his charm and all of the sexual innuendoes that have been flying around.</p><p>\u201cDo you want a ride?\u201d Quinn asks. I\u2019m startled because I\u2019ve been staring so hard into his eyes that I wasn\u2019t expecting him to speak.</p><p>\u201cOn Titan?\u201d I stutter.</p><p>He laughs.</p> <p>\u201cUnless you have a better idea,\u201d he says with one brow raised. He patiently waits for my answer while I die of embarrassment. I can literally feel the heat splashing across my cheeks.</p><p>\u201cUh, no. I don\u2019t have a better idea,\u201d I stammer. I don\u2019t know where my wits have all gone. They seem to be missing in action. I curse them silently and order them to come back. They silently laugh at me and then run for the hills. I have rogue wits.</p><p>Quinn\u2019s damned eyes continue to sparkle.</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s a pity. If you think of something, let me know. Until then, yes, I was speaking of the horse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how to ride,\u201d I tell him. \u201cAt least, I don\u2019t think I do. Do I?\u201d</p><p>Quinn shakes his head. \u201cI don\u2019t know. You and I just met awhile back. Horses aren\u2019t all that common here in Caberra, though. So I doubt it. But I heard that you\u2019ll be staying here for a while. Maybe I could teach you. We could work out a trade. You teach me to swim, I\u2019ll teach you to ride.\u201d</p><p>I stare at him hesitantly. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I remember how to swim. But if I do, I\u2019ll be happy to teach you.\u201d</p><p>Quinn throws his head back and laughs.</p><p>\u201cMia, you are a constant surprise. I never know what to think with you. I like it. Okay, it\u2019s a deal. If you remember how to swim, you can teach me. And I\u2019ll teach you to ride regardless. Deal?\u201d</p><p>I nod immediately, because the image of me sitting in front of him on that horse, leaned back against his strong chest between his legs, is enough to give me heart palpations.</p><p>For real.</p><p>\u201cDeal,\u201d I agree.</p><p>\u201cNow, how about I lead you around for a bit on Titan. I\u2019ll have a hold of his head the whole time so there is nothing to be afraid of,\u201d Quinn tells me. My chin automatically juts out on its own accord.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not afraid of anything,\u201d I announce. And then I\u2019m startled by that. I\u2019m not? Those words came out on their own. I didn\u2019t even think about them. It was Old Mia talking. Maybe I like her, after all.</p><p>Quinn appraises me and there is appreciation in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cCome on, then,\u201d he tells me, holding his large hand out. I take it and he leads me into the paddock. He holds his hand out to Titan, who huffs a big breath out of his gigantic flared nostrils before he steps closer to Quinn.</p><p>Quinn snaps a lead rope into the ring on the halter and I fight the urge to run. What was I thinking, agreeing to this? Titan is enormous. And he\u2019s looking at me with the wild eyes of a demon as he stomps the dirt with his huge demon hoof.</p><p>Ohmygod.</p><p>I\u2019m an idiot.</p><p>This horse is a freaking demon.</p><p>Quinn looks at my face and laughs.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Miss I\u2019m-Not-Scared. It\u2019s alright.\u201d</p><p>He makes a cup out of his hands and motions for me to use it. I wedge my foot between his fingers and he boosts me up. I swing my other leg around and before I know it, I\u2019m situated on top of the demon.</p><p>HolyHell.</p><p>I\u2019m an idiot with amnesia who is sitting on a demon.</p><p>A very tall demon.</p><p>I gulp.</p><p>\u201cCalm down,\u201d Quinn tells me as he glances up at me. \u201cHorses can sense fear. There\u2019s nothing to be afraid of. I\u2019ve got you.\u201d He pats my leg before he walks to Titan\u2019s head. And I can feel the imprint of where his hand was on my thigh. I swallow. He has a very sexy hand. Both hands, actually.</p><p>\u201cYou know, in America, horses are sometimes used for therapy,\u201d Quinn tells me conversationally, as he leads Titan out of the coral. I am panicky as we leave the confines of the fence. A fence means safety. And since I am outside of that fence, I am no longer safe. I swallow hard.</p><p>\u201cAre you saying that I need therapy now?\u201d I ask, only half joking. I clench my thighs around Titan\u2019s bare, broad back. I so don\u2019t want to fall off. There\u2019s no way that Quinn could catch me in time and I\u2019d break my neck. I fight the urge to leap off and run for the house.</p><p>Quinn glances back up at me.</p><p>\u201cOh, you\u2019ve probably always needed it,\u201d he tells me. \u201cI\u2019ve never met anyone who tried so hard to be someone that she\u2019s not.\u201d</p><p>That definitely gives me pause.</p><p>It\u2019s almost the same exact thing that Elena said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m kidding,\u201d he chuckles as he sees my expression. \u201cYou did try hard to portray a certain image. But I\u2019m sure you didn\u2019t need therapy. Just a reality check.\u201d</p><p>I stare at him.</p><p>\u201cA reality check? How well did you know me, anyway?\u201d</p><p>Quinn shakes his head and wipes a little sweat from his brow. He\u2019s got a strong jawline. I love that. I fight to focus on his words, not his face. It\u2019s a difficult feat to master.</p><p>\u201cNot that well. But you were fairly easy to read. Not so much now, though.\u201d</p><p>That pacifies me a little.</p><p>Sort of.</p><p>\u201cWhy not now?\u201d I ask slowly.</p><p>Quinn looks at me uncertainly. \u201cBecause it\u2019s hard to read someone who doesn\u2019t know who she is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho do you think I am?\u201d I am practically whispering now. I suddenly feel very, very tired. I\u2019m physically tired, I\u2019m mentally tired and losing my identity is just a bit exhausting.</p><p>Quinn stops and turns to me, taking a step and then another, until he is pressed against my leg and staring into my eyes.</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re a sweet little bird who has always tried to break out of her cage because you really had no idea what life is like outside of your world. And now you\u2019re a sweet little bird who doesn\u2019t know what to think. All of your masks are gone and now you are forced to be yourself. It must be scary for you.\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t sound sympathetic, just matter-of-fact.</p><p>And I have to respect that.</p><p>I nod.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a bird,\u201d I tell him. \u201cBut you\u2019re right about one thing. I don\u2019t have anything to hide behind now, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would you want to hide at all?\u201d Quinn asks, still staring into my eyes. \u201cThat\u2019s the part I could never figure out. You don\u2019t have anything to hide from. You can take life by the tail if you want to. It\u2019s yours for the taking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s mine for the taking?\u201d I ask, momentarily confused by his nearness. He smiles.</p><p>\u201cAnything you want.\u201d</p><p>I suck in my breath.</p><p>And he inhales deeply.</p><p>And then the moment is broken by my mother\u2019s shrill screaming.</p><p>\u201cMia Alexandria Giannis. Get off of that animal! You\u2019re going to break your neck!\u201d I turn and find her rushing out of Giliberti House toward us and Quinn grins at me.</p><p>\u201cI take it back. You might want to hide from that.\u201d</p><p>I smile back as warmth floods through me. He lifts me down and I enjoy the feeling of my body pressed against his, even though it only lasts for a second. His heart beats against mine.</p><p>Ba-bump.</p><p>Ba-bump.</p><p>He glances down at me and his eyes are like melted chocolate. And I want to eat him up.</p><p>Eat him up?</p><p>Yep. With a freaking spoon.</p><p>I\u2019m insane.</p><p>But he makes me feel so good.</p><p>That\u2019s a fact that I come to realize as I turn away from him to meet my mother. Quinn walks away to take Titan back to the stables and I miss him immediately. Just like I missed Gavin in the hospital yesterday.</p><p>They both make me feel good in two different ways.</p><p>I sigh.</p><p>Because I know that I\u2019m in trouble. I don\u2019t even know who I am, but I just woke up from a coma and I find that I want two separate boys for two separate reasons. That can never be good.</p><p>At least I know that much.</p><p>Chapter Ten</p><p>Dinner at Giliberti House is interesting.</p><p>Marionnette, Darius and Quinn eat in the kitchen, because that\u2019s the way they\u2019ve been doing it. Quinn apparently didn\u2019t want to eat in the formal dining room alone and the Papous would never eat in there because they don\u2019t consider that proper behavior. They are staff, after all. Even though they seem more like family.</p><p>But my mother refuses to eat in the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cMia,\u201d she sighs. \u201cThe wife and daughter of Stanyos Giannis cannot eat in the kitchen. It just isn\u2019t seemly.\u201d</p><p>So, we eat in the formal dining room.</p><p>Alone.</p><p>And it feels so stuffy and unnatural. And I hate it.</p><p>As I stare down the long table at my mother, I hate it even more. I have to practically yell so that she can hear me. That\u2019s how big this table is.</p><p>I want to join the others in the kitchen, where it is warm and cozy and because Quinn is there. But that\u2019s not going to happen. My mother told me as much. Right after she threatened my life if I ever got on a horse again. And told me that I need to stay away from Quinn. Which of course, for some reason, had the immediate and opposite effect. I want to be near him more than ever. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Apparently, I\u2019m rebellious.</p><p>So, I do what any rebellious girl would probably do.</p><p>I eat in sullen silence. I drink my soup from the spoon, I eat three croissants (because they really are my favorites) and I have a giant piece of pie.</p><p>My mother looks at me in disapproval.</p> <p>\u201cMia, you\u2019re not going to be seventeen forever. You might want to start watching what you eat. You don\u2019t want to gain weight.\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes. I\u2019ve got plenty of other things to worry about besides my weight. I\u2019m skinny for now and that\u2019s all that matters. I\u2019ll worry about my weight when I\u2019m thirty.</p><p>\u201cHow long is the construction on our house going to take?\u201d I yell down to my mom. She cringes from the volume of my voice. I\u2019m guessing that it isn\u2019t seemly. But how else is she supposed to hear me? This table is five miles long.</p><p>And I\u2019m seriously starting to hate the word seemly.</p><p>She shrugs. \u201cThey say it will take three months or so. And Kolettis Academy will be closed for the next two to four weeks for construction, as well. I just heard today. They will add that time onto the end of the year. So don\u2019t worry. You\u2019ll graduate on time.\u201d</p> <p>I nod. I\u2019m happy about being out of school for a month. Hopefully that will give my memory time to come back. I\u2019ll focus on that.</p><p>\u201cMy doctor said that I should do things that are familiar to me,\u201d I remind her. \u201cHe said that it will help my memory. I think I\u2019ll see if Gavin wants to go scuba diving tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>My mother looks pained, but she nods. I\u2019m betting that she would much rather have me spend time with Gavin, even if we\u2019re doing something she hates, rather than spend time with Quinn. I don\u2019t know why and I don\u2019t really care. I guess that\u2019s Old Mia\u2019s spunk talking.</p><p>I\u2019m sort of digging that chick now and I wish I could remember more about her.</p><p>\u201cAlso, Marionette told me that Dante and Reece are returning to Caberra for a while to help with clean-up from the earthquake,\u201d my mother tells me. \u201cThe downtown area was particularly damaged. It might do you good to help, as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDante and Reece are coming?\u201d I ask, surprised. \u201cWhen?\u201d</p> <p>She shakes her head. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Marionette probably does, though. You can ask her.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m excited by this. Dante and Reece used to be familiar to me. If I talk with them, it might help. This is a good thing.</p><p>I immediately pick up my dinner plate and head to the kitchen, ignoring my mother\u2019s protests. She doesn\u2019t follow. Too unseemly, I guess, to follow your daughter into a kitchen. I almost laugh, but don\u2019t. My mother\u2019s self-imposed rules are sort of funny. And sort of pathetic.</p><p>Marionette, Darius and Quinn look surprised to see me, but Quinn quickly jumps up and pulls a chair out for me. His polite behavior makes my pulse speed up. But I try to calm it down. He\u2019s only exhibiting manners. Geez. I\u2019m sure he\u2019d do it for anyone.</p><p>I sit down and immediately turn to Marionette, asking her about Dante and Reece. Her face is genuinely happy when she answers.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll be here soon,\u201d she tells me. \u201cI think they\u2019re arriving tomorrow. And they are very excited to see you.\u201d</p><p>Quinn doesn\u2019t look quite as happy, but I\u2019m guessing that has something to do with the fact that he and Reece have a complicated relationship or so I\u2019m told.</p><p>Apparently, they took turns having a crush on each other for the last ten years or so. But they never timed it right and so they never ended up together. Quinn dated Reece\u2019s friend Becca for the last couple of years, although now they\u2019re broken up. But now Reece is with Dante, so the timing still isn\u2019t right. I wonder if Quinn is regretful of that?</p> <p>He doesn\u2019t seem to be, though, as he takes a bite of soup. I can\u2019t help but notice how big his hands are. He\u2019s absolutely gigantic.</p><p>\u201cSo, how much trouble did you get into for riding Titan?\u201d he asks, grinning. He isn\u2019t apologetic at all. I like it.</p><p>\u201cNot much,\u201d I answer. \u201cJust a lecture. Apparently, I\u2019m supposed to stay away from you, too. But you can see how well that lecture took.\u201d</p><p>Marionette mutters under her breath and I can see that she doesn\u2019t approve of my mother. That\u2019s okay. I\u2019m not sure that I do, either. Quinn\u2019s eyes sparkle.</p><p>\u201cAm I a bad influence?\u201d he asks with interest. \u201cI think I might like that. I\u2019ve never been the bad boy before. It might be fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve never been the bad boy?\u201d I ask doubtfully. My eyebrows are raised. Quinn shakes his head.</p><p>\u201cNope. I\u2019m a Midwesterner, remember? Oh, I guess you don\u2019t. Well, I\u2019m from the heartland of America where we\u2019re polite and friendly and never know a stranger. Yes, m\u2019am. No, m\u2019am and all that. Although I am considering a tattoo. I\u2019m guessing your mom wouldn\u2019t approve of that, either.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s smiling now, totally unrepentant and unconcerned. My pulse speeds up yet again. It seems to do that a lot around him.</p><p>\u201cA tattoo? Gavin said that he\u2019s going to get one that says, \u201cAlways ready.\u201d</p><p>Quinn rolls his eyes good-naturedly. \u201cHe would. I haven\u2019t decided yet what I want. Maybe you can help me.\u201d</p><p>I raise my eyebrow again. \u201cMe? I don\u2019t know you well enough to know what you should get.\u201d</p><p>Quinn winks. \u201cWell, maybe that\u2019s part of my diabolical plan. You\u2019ll have to get to know me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDevious,\u201d I grin. \u201cI like it. Well, it might backfire on you. Maybe I\u2019ll get a matching tattoo and then you\u2019ll be tied to me for life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeedy,\u201d he observes. \u201cI like it.\u201d</p><p>We laugh and Marionette and Darius laugh, too. I really like them. And I like this kitchen. And I have decided that I\u2019m going to eat in here from now on. My mother can suck it. If she doesn\u2019t want to join us, she can eat out there alone. She can keep up her seemly appearances all on her own.</p><p>When we\u2019re finished eating, Quinn walks me out. We pass through the dining room and I see that my mother is gone. She left her dirty dishes, though. Obviously carrying them to the kitchen would be unseemly. I\u2019m really starting to hate that word. I should make a list of the words I\u2019m starting to hate.</p><p>Seemly.</p><p>Soon.</p><p>Apparently.</p><p>I can add more later. Right now, I\u2019m preoccupied with Quinn. And his bulging biceps, long fingers and mischievous grin. I stare up at him and smile.</p><p>\u201cDo you and Reece get along okay now?\u201d I ask him as we turn onto the staircase leading to the bedrooms. He looks surprised.</p><p>\u201cOf course. Why do you ask?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGavin told me about you and Reece\u2019s history. So I just wondered,\u201d I shrug. I\u2019m trying to act nonchalant. I hope it\u2019s coming across that way. In an effort to enhance the act, I make a point of examining the portraits of Giliberti ancestors as we walk past them. Their eyes seem to stare into my back. It\u2019s sort of creepy.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you so interested?\u201d Quinn raises an eyebrow.</p><p>So, I fail.</p><p>Epically.</p><p>Apparently I wasn\u2019t so nonchalant.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I shrug again. \u201cJust curious. I guess I find everything interesting nowadays. Everything seems new.\u201d</p><p>Quinn smiles, a real and sincere smile. It\u2019s salt of the earth. Whatever that means.</p><p>\u201cI guess that\u2019s one benefit to amnesia,\u201d he tells me, as he lightly guides my elbow around the landing. \u201cYou get to start over. If you want,\u201d he adds.</p><p>I look at him. \u201cShould I? Start over, I mean. Was the old me something I should re-do?\u201d</p><p>He stops.</p><p>And cocks his head.</p><p>And he is oh-so-sexy.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he says firmly. \u201cOld Mia was someone who hated the pressure of worrying about what everyone thought. So you hid who you really were. Maybe the new you won\u2019t be so concerned with it.\u201d</p><p>I stare at him.</p><p>\u201cI thought you didn\u2019t know me that well,\u201d I point out uncertainly. He shrugs.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t difficult to see,\u201d he answers as we resume the climb on the stairs. \u201cJust worry about being who you really are. If you never remember who you were, that\u2019s fine. You\u2019re still you regardless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s very profound,\u201d I murmur.</p><p>And it is. I\u2019ve been so preoccupied with trying to remember who I was, that I forgot that I\u2019m still me either way. I\u2019m just a me without memories. Interesting. It\u2019s so simple that it\u2019s genius.</p><p>We stop in front of my bedroom.</p><p>There is an awkward pause. But maybe it\u2019s only awkward to me. Quinn always seems casual. Always relaxed.</p><p>He smiles at me now.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re here,\u201d he tells me. \u201cI was getting lonely here all by myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, Dante and Reece will be here tomorrow. So, you\u2019ll have even more people to keep you company,\u201d I remind him.</p><p>\u201cTrue,\u201d he acknowledges. \u201cBut I\u2019m most happy about you.\u201d</p><p>I startle and stare into his chocolate brown eyes. \u201cReally?\u201d I whisper.</p><p>He nods. \u201cReally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t hide what you\u2019re feeling much, do you?\u201d I observe. Quinn\u2019s eyes sparkle in response.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see the point in it,\u201d he admits. \u201cI don\u2019t like games. I don\u2019t like playing them because I hate to lose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re a sore loser , then?\u201d I ask with a laugh.</p><p>But he\u2019s shaking his head. \u201cNope. I\u2019m not a sore loser. Because I never lose in the first place.\u201d</p><p>He dips his head like an old-fashioned cowboy, like something that belongs in a razor commercial or a cologne ad. And then he continues down the hall to his bedroom and I fight the urge to chase after him.</p><p>But I don\u2019t and so I\u2019m left standing in shock in the hallway alone.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t lose.</p><p>What is he trying to win?</p><p>I have a feeling that I am going to be the one who loses\u2014hours of sleep tonight\u2014trying to ponder that question.</p><p>Chapter Eleven</p><p>\u201cMia!\u201d</p><p>There is a squeal, unearthly loud and shrieky, before something lands on my bed. I open my eyes but squeeze them instantly closed again. The sun is too, too bright. And the voice is too, too loud.</p><p>And too, too unfamiliar.</p><p>But the unfamiliar thing is bouncing.</p><p>And ramming its bony elbow into my side.</p><p>So I open my eyes again and find the girl from my phone.</p><p>\u201cReece?\u201d</p><p>The blonde girl squeals again and hugs me. \u201cYou remember me!!\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s exuberant and I don\u2019t want to tell her that I don\u2019t. But I kind of have to. She\u2019d figure it out eventually anyway. So I shake my head.</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m sorry. I don\u2019t remember yet. But your pictures are in my phone.\u201d</p><p>The pretty blonde girl- Reece\u2014is dismayed, but she quickly tries to hide it. She\u2019s like a cheerful ray of sunshine and the clouds are covering up her smile. I feel guilty about that.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really sorry,\u201d I tell her again.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d she assures me. \u201cYou\u2019ll remember soon. I\u2019m just so happy to see you!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sure I would be happy to see you, too, if I could remember,\u201d I tell her regretfully. I know it\u2019s true. When I couldn\u2019t sleep last night, I went through my old text messages. I found about a million from me to Reece, demanding that she return to Caberra. Our text conversations had me laughing. She\u2019s pretty funny. I can see why I liked her.</p><p>She\u2019s shaking her head now. \u201cWhy are you still in bed? It\u2019s 9:00 a.m.\u201d</p><p>And she\u2019s looking at me almost accusingly. I narrow my eyes.</p><p>\u201cIf you try and tell me that I\u2019m normally a morning person, I\u2019m going to know that you\u2019re on drugs. There\u2019s no way that\u2019s true.\u201d</p> <p>Reece laughs. \u201cHeck, no. I won\u2019t even try it. I\u2019m actually surprised that you haven\u2019t thrown a pillow at my head yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t think I haven\u2019t thought about it,\u201d I tell her. \u201cBut since we\u2019re just meeting- for the second time- I\u2019m trying to be on my best behavior.\u201d</p><p>She laughs again. \u201cYou\u2019re the same Mia, even if you don\u2019t remember,\u201d she tells me. \u201cYou\u2019ve always had spunk. And you\u2019ve still got it. That\u2019s important, I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is?\u201d I stare at her. \u201cI don\u2019t think my mother thinks so.\u201d</p><p>Reece smiles. \u201cYou and your mom... you\u2019ve been at each other\u2019s throats since the day I met you. I doubt that\u2019s ever going to change.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe have?\u201d I ask with interest. \u201cShe\u2019s trying hard to make me believe that I\u2019ve always been perfect... perfect manners, perfect behavior, perfect at everything. It didn\u2019t really seem in-line with what I feel.\u201d</p><p>Reece laughs now, a tinkling sound in the sunshine of my bedroom. In fact, she laughs until she is gasping for air. I find myself glaring at her.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it was that funny,\u201d I tell her wryly.</p><p>\u201cOh, but it is,\u201d she gasps. \u201cIf you could only remember. You would just die about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI must have been a monster,\u201d I mutter as I swing my legs out of bed. Reece looks at me and sobers up.</p><p>\u201cNo, of course you weren\u2019t,\u201d she tells me quickly. \u201cYou were just feisty. And you didn\u2019t take crap from anyone. And you definitely didn\u2019t try to be perfect for your mother. She has her own ideas about how the perfect family should be that you\u2019ve never agreed with. You\u2019ve never wanted to pretend to be someone that you\u2019re not. I\u2019ve always loved that about you.\u201d</p> <p>I sigh.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s so good to hear you say that,\u201d I admit to her. \u201cGavin tells me that I should just fall into rank and do what I\u2019m told because it\u2019s easier that way. And he should know- he\u2019s in the same position as me. But it doesn\u2019t feel right. I don\u2019t want to try and change who I am just to fit an image. But apparently, that\u2019s sort of exactly what I was doing before. It seems that I was deliberately going out of my way to be the opposite of what my parents wanted me to be. I don\u2019t really want to do that either. I just want to figure out who I really am and be that.\u201d</p><p>Reece is looking at me sympathetically and I don\u2019t like that.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t feel sorry for me,\u201d I tell her. \u201cPlease. I seriously hate that.\u201d</p><p>She tightens up her expression and leans over to give me a hug.</p><p>\u201cIn that case,\u201d she answers. \u201cI\u2019m glad to see you. Get your butt out of bed. We\u2019ve got things to do and people to scare.\u201d</p><p>I laugh and she smirks.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s something you would have said once upon a time,\u201d she tells me. I grin.</p> <p>\u201cWell, then, let\u2019s go scare some people.\u201d</p><p>I get dressed and Reece and I go downstairs for breakfast. When we walk into the kitchen, Dante and Quinn are lounging at the table with freshly squeezed orange juice.</p><p>Together.</p><p>Which seems odd to me.</p><p>Quinn grins lazily at me and I fight the urge to dive into his lap and rub up against him like a cat. That might not go over so well, so I restrain myself.</p><p>Dante turns and his entire face lights up when he sees me.</p><p>\u201cMia!\u201d he says happily.</p><p>He gets to his feet and I look him over. Yes, he\u2019s exactly as I thought he would be...like a fashion model. He\u2019s wearing khaki slacks and a button-up shirt with rolled up sleeves. The very picture of casual elegance. But he\u2019s sexy as hell with that dimple in his chin and his sparkling eyes. I smile and he hugs me.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good to see you,\u201d he tells me quietly. \u201cI\u2019ve been so worried about you ever since I heard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good to see you too,\u201d I tell him. \u201cI don\u2019t remember you right now, but I\u2019m hoping that I will soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will,\u201d he tells me confidently. \u201cI have faith in that. Everything will be fine.\u201d</p><p>Dante has an air of calm around him that is contagious. I feel comforted by his presence, like all will be well because he says it will be. I like that.</p><p>He pushes out the chair next to him for me and Reece sits next to Quinn. I can tell that there is no animosity there at all, they\u2019re as comfortable as old friends can be. And Dante is perfectly secure with their relationship. As he should be. It\u2019s apparent to anyone in a five mile radius that Reece is completely in love with him. Any thoughts she ever had about Quinn are long gone.</p><p>\u201cHow long are you home for?\u201d I ask as I nibble on a fresh croissant. Dante shrugs elegantly.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t really know yet,\u201d he answers. \u201cAs soon as we heard about the quake, we knew that we needed to come and help with the cleanup, especially when we heard about you. We talked my dad into it and here we are. But I don\u2019t know how long he\u2019ll let us stay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you miss school in America?\u201d I ask curiously. Dante shrugs again.</p><p>\u201cIf we\u2019re here too long, we\u2019ll just finish out the year here. I\u2019m not that worried about it.\u201d</p><p>I know that Old Mia would be very happy to hear this. And I\u2019m sure that New Mia will be too. Eventually. Soon.</p><p>Stupid vague words.</p><p>\u201cReece and I have to go see my father this morning,\u201d Dante tells us. \u201cBut this afternoon, we\u2019ve volunteered to help with a clean-up effort in town. Would you like to join us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d I say. Quinn is nodding too.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d be happy to,\u201d Quinn says. He meets my gaze and my face immediately gets hot. I don\u2019t know why. I\u2019m weird, I guess. That\u2019s a good reason. And also, I think he wants to come because I\u2019ll be there. That\u2019s a good reason, too.</p><p>OhMyWord.</p><p>That thought makes me flustered.</p><p>I\u2019m suddenly finding it hard to breathe. I try to breathe out of my nose like a normal person, not out of my mouth like a weird mouth-breather. But panting makes that difficult.</p><p>\u201cSo, want to meet here around 2:00?\u201d Dante asks as he stands up. \u201cWe can ride together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d I tell him. He bends down and squeezes my shoulder.</p><p>\u201cIt really is good to see you, Mi,\u201d he tells me quietly and then gives me a peck on the cheek. I smile at him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good to see you too,\u201d I answer. And I mean it. Even if I don\u2019t remember, it is still good to see them. He and Reece are so friendly. And their blue eyes sparkle all of the time. What\u2019s not to like? They\u2019re like friendly, witty Barbie and Ken dolls. They\u2019re a gorgeous matching set.</p><p>They leave and Quinn and I are left alone at the table.</p><p>\u201cSo, what are your plans for the day?\u201d Quinn asks. \u201cUntil 2:00, I mean?\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cI\u2019m not sure yet. I\u2019m thinking about seeing if Gavin wants to go diving. I\u2019ve got to see if I still know how to swim somehow. I\u2019ve got a deal to uphold.\u201d</p><p>Quinn grins. \u201cYou sure do. And you don\u2019t strike me as someone who would renege.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m already shaking my head. \u201cNever.\u201d</p><p>He laughs and clears his plate, putting it in the sink. I like the fact that he does that. It\u2019s a thoughtful thing, even though it\u2019s small. My gaze flickers to his butt, which is framed perfectly in worn Levi\u2019s. I seriously doubt there is a pair of jeans in the world that doesn\u2019t agree with that butt. And then he turns and catches me checking his agreeable butt out.</p><p>Epic. Fail.</p><p>I blush.</p><p>\u201cSee something you like?\u201d he asks, one eyebrow raised.</p><p>I blush again.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you mean,\u201d I stammer.</p><p>He chuckles. \u201cWrong answer, tiny tot. You\u2019re supposed to give me a verbal lashing. That\u2019s what you did the last time I caught you checking out my merchandise.\u201d</p><p>My mouth drops open.</p><p>\u201cYour merchandise? Are you selling something now?\u201d</p><p>Quinn winks. \u201cThat depends on who is buying.\u201d</p><p>And he saunters out.</p><p>Yes, saunters. There is no other word to describe the casual, cocky way that he moves through life. OhMyGod.</p><p>My fingers are practically shaking as I pick up my phone and text Gavin. I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m shaking, either. I have no idea why I let Quinn affect me like he does. It\u2019s like my hormones are instantly nervous whenever he is near. I wonder if his are affected the same way? I shake my head and focus on my phone.</p><p>Wanna go diving?</p><p>I text this to Gavin. And then I add a smiley face.</p><p>There is an answer in less than ten seconds.</p><p>My, aren\u2019t we happy today? And of course, Mi. The answer to that is always yes.</p><p>I shove my phone in my pocket and sigh. So, apparently, I don\u2019t usually use emoticons. I should make a list of all the things I don\u2019t normally do. But then again, that would negate my new theory that I\u2019m going to rediscover myself. So I shelve that idea.</p><p>My phone buzzes in my pocket, so I pull it back out.</p><p>BTW, you always wear a bikini to dive. A skimpy one.</p><p>I laugh out loud. And I\u2019m still laughing when I hear a voice behind me.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, sweet one.\u201d</p><p>I turn to find Marionette gliding into the kitchen. She bends and hugs me and I am truly happy to see her.</p><p>\u201cGood morning,\u201d I answer as I return her hug. \u201cDo you happen to know... do I have a car here?\u201d</p><p>She smiles. \u201cYou do have a car. But it isn\u2019t here. And honestly, I don\u2019t know if it was damaged in the quake. But Darius would be happy to take you anywhere you need to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I smile at her.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s out in the barn, I think,\u201d she tells me before she grabs a loaded breakfast tray, presumably for my mother.</p><p>The thought that my mother is up and around puts a spring into my step. I pack a bag with a one-piece swimsuit and duck out before I can accidentally bump into her. I\u2019m guessing that my mother isn\u2019t a morning person, either.</p><p>But that\u2019s just a guess.</p><p>I do find Darius in the barn and he is happy to give me a ride, just as Marionette said he would be. He chats casually during the ride into town. The farm truck is bumpy and jostling, but I don\u2019t mind. He drops me off at the pier and as I am standing there, I realize something.</p><p>I didn\u2019t bring any equipment.</p><p>I\u2019m an idiot.</p><p>And I\u2019m still standing there like an idiot when Gavin finds me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDid you bring your bikini?\u201d he asks with a grin.

Just be forewarned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNoted,\u201d I answer back. It is absolutely impossible to not be happy around Gavin. And that is the truth.</p> <p>\u201cWhere\u2019s your stuff?\u201d he asks, glancing down and only seeing my one little bag.</p><p>I wince at my own idiocy.</p><p>\u201cI was in a hurry to duck out before I ran into my mom, so I forgot it,\u201d I admit sheepishly. Gavin throws his head back and laughs.</p><p>\u201cHmm. Just like old times,\u201d he says with another chuckle. \u201cMia\u2019s hiding from her mom again. Maybe it\u2019s best if we just swim today, anyway. You can get your sea legs back under you.\u201d</p><p>I nod because that\u2019s probably a good idea.</p> <p>He leads me onto a pristine little boat named The Shining. It\u2019s immaculate even though many of the surrounding boats have clearly been damaged in the quake. I look at Gavin questioningly.</p><p>\u201cWe were out on the water when it hit,\u201d he told me. \u201cYou, me and Quinn. So there was nothing for my boat to get damaged with.\u201d</p><p>Oh. This was something I didn\u2019t know. I was with Gavin and Quinn at the same time? I wonder how that came to pass? But I don\u2019t ask. Instead, I take a seat and enjoy the fragrant sea breeze that blows through my hair as Gavin steers through the bay. The sunlight skims the surface of the water and breaks apart into a million prisms of light. It\u2019s gorgeous and I sigh happily while I breathe in the salty air.</p><p>\u201cYou love it out here,\u201d he calls to me when we are on open water. \u201cYou always have and I know you always will. We\u2019ve been doing this since we were small.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways together?\u201d I ask curiously. He nods.</p><p>\u201cAlways.\u201d</p> <p>Hmm. I never know now when he is messing with me, but I look at his face and he is distracted by driving and doesn\u2019t seem to be kidding. So, Gavin and I are together a lot. That would make sense since he knows me so well.</p><p>He kills the motor after a while and the boat floats. Everything is quiet around us except for the water lapping against the fiberglass hull. It\u2019s soothing. I lean back in my seat and allow the sun to wash over my face. I decide that I\u2019m never going to shore. So I tell Gavin that.</p><p>He laughs.</p><p>\u201cYou should\u2019ve mentioned that beforehand and I would\u2019ve brought some food. You\u2019re kind of bitchy when you don\u2019t eat.\u201d</p><p>I open one eye.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t everyone?\u201d</p><p>He laughs again. \u201cNot like you. You once almost ripped my finger off for stealing your candy bar. I thought you were going to punch me in the throat.\u201d</p><p>I giggle. It doesn\u2019t sound like me. But what do I know?</p> <p>\u201cYou probably shouldn\u2019t mess with a girl\u2019s chocolate,\u201d I advise him. He smiles.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know that now, thanks to you. Now, do you want to swim?\u201d</p><p>Gavin looks at me. I eye the water. I know it must be deep out here. Really, really deep.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure if I remember how,\u201d I admit to him. \u201cAnd I still need to change into my suit.\u201d</p><p>Gavin\u2019s eyes start to sparkle. And that\u2019s a dangerous sign. I have re-discovered that already.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s no problem,\u201d he tells me. \u201cI\u2019ll turn my back and you can change. And then we\u2019ll get into the water together. You can wear a life-jacket.\u201d</p><p>I narrow my eyes. \u201cNo peeking.\u201d</p><p>He holds his hands up innocently. \u201cI would never. Okay, maybe I would. But I promise that I won\u2019t today.\u201d</p><p>He laughs impishly. And I know, deep down, that I wouldn\u2019t be overly mad if he did peek. What does that make me? What kind of girl am I, anyway?</p><p>I grab my bag and yank my suit out. True to his word, Gavin turns his back. Although, I do catch him trying to steal a glance in the chrome reflection of the boat trim. I laugh in spite of myself. I have never shoved my clothes off of my body as fast as I do right now. Well, I don\u2019t think I ever have anyway. I yank my suit up and slide my arms into the arm straps.</p><p>\u201cDone!\u201d I announce.</p><p>Gavin turns around, his gaze flickers down and then back up. I can\u2019t read the expression in his eyes very well, but I\u2019m guessing he is disappointed that there really is no bikini. He doesn\u2019t show it, though. Instead, he grabs a bright orange lifejacket and tosses it to me.</p><p>\u201cPut this on.\u201d</p><p>So I do.</p><p>And then I peer over the edge of the boat. The water is brilliant blue and fairly clear.</p><p>\u201cAre there sharks?\u201d I ask.</p><p>Gavin rolls his eyes. \u201cWhen in the history of your life, have you ever worried about sharks?\u201d He pauses. \u201cOh, right. You don\u2019t remember. Sorry. You don\u2019t worry about sharks because you know that you have a greater chance of dying in an airplane crash than you do of getting eaten by a shark. The chances are slim to none.\u201d</p><p>For some reason, that doesn\u2019t make me feel much better.</p><p>But it might be because the sea is so vast and I am so unsure about my swimming skills.</p><p>Gavin looks at me and grabs my hand.</p><p>\u201cMia, I would never let anything happen to you. You are a very strong swimmer. All you have to do is trust your instincts. And you have a life jacket on. You\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>I nod and Gavin counts.</p><p>On three, we jump over the side.</p><p>Chapter Twelve</p><p>I feel panicked for a second as the water closes in over my head. I plunge into the sea and for a brief minute before my lifejacket thrusts me back up, I do panic. I kick hard and flail. But then the buoyancy of the orange vest sends me bobbing back to the surface.</p><p>I sputter as my head breaks through the water. And then I gulp in a huge mouthful of air. Gavin is still holding my hand and he shakes the water from his hair as he treads water next to me.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d he asks in concern. I nod.</p><p>\u201cYep. I just wasn\u2019t expecting it to be so cold.\u201d</p><p>He looks at me strangely. \u201cYou really don\u2019t remember anything at all, do you?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>I release his hand and kick away from the boat. I love the weightless feeling that I have right now, even though I\u2019m secretly worried that sharks are going to notice my legs kicking and come up and bite one off. I\u2019m kind of fond of my legs. I\u2019d prefer to keep them.</p><p>There\u2019s nothing out here, not for miles and miles. I scan the horizon and only see blue. I feel freer than I\u2019ve felt since I woke up. I tell Gavin that and he smiles.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why you love it out here so much,\u201d he confides. \u201cYou\u2019re free out here. No restrictions, no expectations. Usually, we dive the old wrecks.\u201d</p><p>At my clueless expression, he adds, \u201cIt\u2019s a bunch of sunken ships. You love it.\u201d</p><p>For some reason, for a minute, I get a chill. Thinking of old sunken ships resting against the bottom of the sea with moss and crap growing on them is pretty creepy. And I don\u2019t want to swim down there. But of course I don\u2019t want Gavin to know that. I don\u2019t want to hear But you used to love it! even one more time. It\u2019s growing a little old.</p><p>I seem to do okay paddling, so I decide to try swimming. I stretch my arms out in front of me and stroke, one after the other. Gavin calls after me.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re doing great! I knew you wouldn\u2019t forget!\u201d</p><p>I bury my face in the sea and allow it to wash over me. The cool water seems to wash everything away and I glide effortlessly through the water. I flip onto my back and close my eyes, basking in the sun as I float.</p><p>I don\u2019t know how long I bob in the water like this, but I decide that I must have fallen asleep for a minute. Because when I open my eyes again, I am way, way away from the boat.</p><p>Far.</p><p>Away.</p><p>And Gavin is lying on the hull of the boat, asleep. I can tell from the way his arm is thrown up over his head and his eyes are closed.</p><p>I flip over and suddenly, I\u2019m terrified.</p><p>I\u2019m panicky.</p><p>The sea is so very vast.</p><p>And I\u2019m so very alone.</p><p>I scream. I can\u2019t help it. And as I do, I accidentally gulp in a huge mouthful of water. Everything that follows is a blur.</p><p>I start coughing and flailing my arms and even though I\u2019m wearing a life-jacket, I\u2019m thrashing around like a lunatic. I hear the boat motor start up and then I feel the wake of the boat as it crests up to me. Gavin is next to me and before I know it, he\u2019s hauling me over the side of The Shining.</p><p>I\u2019m in his lap, on the floor of the boat and he is holding me and I am shaking.</p><p>OhMyGod.</p><p>I\u2019m such an idiot.</p><p>I\u2019m such an idiot.</p><p>And I must be repeating it out loud, even though I don\u2019t mean to, because Gavin is telling me, \u201cNo, you\u2019re not.\u201d</p><p>But I am.</p><p>I really am.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why I got so afraid,\u201d I tell him. \u201cI think I had a panic attack.\u201d My voice sounds pathetic and I hate it.</p><p>Gavin tightens his grip on me, his strong arms are wrapped around me and I suddenly realize that his skin is pressed against mine and it feels really, really good. I push into him harder and clutch him to me.</p><p>Because for some insane reason, I\u2019m still unnerved.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d he tells me softly. He\u2019s stroking my back and I\u2019m trying to catch my breaths like a normal person. \u201cYou\u2019ve been through a lot. I shouldn\u2019t have let you float like that alone. You seemed like you were doing fine, so I climbed up onto the boat to watch you and I must have fallen asleep. I\u2019m so sorry. This is my fault, Mi.\u201d</p><p>I look up at him. He\u2019s so sexy and concerned and my heart melts.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not your fault that I\u2019m insane,\u201d I tell him firmly. \u201cI don\u2019t know why I panicked. I can\u2019t even explain it. Everything just all of a sudden felt so big and I felt so small and alone. I guess I kind of freaked out.\u201d</p><p>Understatement of the year.</p><p>Gavin\u2019s dark eyes are soft as he stares at me. He brushes a thumb across my cheek and says that he is so very sorry.</p><p>\u201cIt makes sense, Mia,\u201d he tells me. \u201cYou can\u2019t remember who you are. So you feel sort of alone in the world. And when you fell asleep while you were floating and woke up, the sea felt big. And everything came down on you at once. It\u2019s okay. I get it. But you\u2019re never alone. I want you to know that. You will always have me. You always have and you always will.\u201d</p><p>My heart swells until it might burst.</p><p>It feels so incredibly, amazingly good to have this beautiful boy tell me that. To know that he has always been my friend, that he knows me inside and out. And then I do something unexpected.</p><p>I lean up and kiss Gavin.</p><p>On the mouth.</p><p>Sweet Angel of Mercy.</p><p>His lips are soft and warm from the sun. I can taste the sea on them and I weave my hands into his hair, pulling him closer. He tightens his grip on me and kisses me back; hard, hard, harder. He tastes like fruit and smells like sunshine.</p><p>It\u2019s really nice.</p><p>Wonderful.</p><p>Amazing.</p><p>My heart is doing flip-flops when I finally pull away.</p><p>Gavin stares down at me in shock.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve always wondered what that would be like,\u201d he admits. \u201cKissing a firecracker, I mean.\u201d I smile. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s really too difficult to say from just one kiss,\u201d he says, his dark eyes twinkling. \u201cWe should try it again so that I have more to go on.\u201d</p><p>He cups my face in his hands and dips his head, his lips meeting mine.</p><p>He tastes of butterscotch and man.</p> <p>Twenty-five beats of my heart later, he pulls away.</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d I breathe.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll do,\u201d he grins.</p><p>I swat at him and he pulls me into his arms, folding me against his chest. It is warm here, where his skin is bathed by the sun. I feel so safe, like he would protect me from anything. But even better, it\u2019s like he knows exactly what to protect me from.</p><p>\u201cThe old you would never have done that,\u201d he tells me quietly a few minutes later. I sigh.</p> <p>\u201cGavin, you\u2019ll never know how tired I am of hearing that,\u201d I tell him. I feel him smile against my shoulder.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just saying it because it is true. As much as I enjoyed that kiss, I\u2019m thinking that maybe we should hold off on doing it again until you remember a little bit more. Just to be on the safe side. I don\u2019t want you slicing off any of my important body parts later because you\u2019re mad at me for taking advantage of the situation.\u201d</p><p>I snuggle closer. \u201cMaybe I\u2019m the one who is taking advantage of you,\u201d I suggest.</p><p>\u201cOh? How so?\u201d Gavin asks. He shifts my weight so that I am lying more comfortably in his lap. I feel evidence of his \u2018important body part\u2019 jabbing into me, but I pretend not to notice.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I\u2019m using you to jog my memory,\u201d I answer. I don\u2019t open my eyes. It feels too good to keep them closed in the sun.</p><p>He laughs. \u201cWell, in that case, feel free to use me in any way that you want. And if you require any of my important body parts for that, say the word. Just remember, I\u2019m always ready.\u201d</p> <p>I smile.</p><p>But then, for a second, one second, Quinn\u2019s lop-sided grin pops into my head and my heart pounds. Why am I in Gavin\u2019s lap and kissing Gavin\u2019s lips when Quinn has the ability to give me heart palpations?</p><p>The answer is pretty clear though.</p><p>Because I like Gavin\u2019s lips.</p><p>And he has the ability to make my heart pound, too.</p><p>In a world that is confusing and scary, Gavin is one of the only things that is real and true. He\u2019s steady, like a rock, and I so need that right now.</p><p>But is that really a good enough reason to be lying in his lap right now? Maybe he was right and we should wait. I sit up.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do that,\u201d Gavin mumbles. \u201cI was just ready to fall asleep again.\u201d</p> <p>I roll my eyes.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you\u2019re right,\u201d I tell him. This pops his eyes wide open.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Say that again. Because you never, ever say that I\u2019m right.\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes again.</p><p>\u201cYou might be right about this. I don\u2019t even know who I am. So how in the world could I know what I want? I don\u2019t want to screw you over while I\u2019m trying to figure it out. And I definitely, definitely don\u2019t want to ruin our friendship. It\u2019s the best thing in my life right now.\u201d</p><p>He arches a dark eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cMi, I\u2019ve always been the best thing in your life.\u201d</p><p>He laughs and I laugh with him.</p><p>\u201cSeriously, though. You\u2019re not going to ruin our friendship. You\u2019re not going to screw me over, although I think it\u2019s cute that you\u2019re worried about it. How about this\u2014we\u2019ll just play it by ear. We\u2019ll do our thing like we always do. And if things develop like they did this afternoon, we\u2019ll pursue them. Don\u2019t stress about it. You\u2019re not supposed to be stressing. Just relax.\u201d</p><p>I twist around and stare at him.</p><p>\u201cJust relax and go with the flow?\u201d</p><p>He nods. \u201cExactly.\u201d</p><p>I nestle into his chest once again and he tightens his arms around me. The sun beats down on our shoulders, drying my hair and warming my chilled bones. It feels really, really good here with Gavin.</p><p>But just as I\u2019m ready to fall asleep in the sun, I see Quinn\u2019s face again. I remember what it felt like when he pressed against me as I was riding Titan. And I hear his charming drawl in my head. My heart quickens in response, like it always does.</p><p>I have no idea what I\u2019m doing.</p><p>That much is clear.</p><p>But as Gavin and I nap in the bottom of The Shining, curled up in the sun and miles away from our nearest problem, it is easy to put it out of my mind. I\u2019m going to try and do what Gavin suggested.</p><p>I\u2019m going to go with the flow.</p><p>I only hope I\u2019m flowing in the right direction.</p><p>Chapter Thirteen</p><p>I text Dante from the pier and let him know that Gavin will be dropping me off in town. But then Gavin decides to join us. So I spend the remainder of the drive wondering how weird it will be to have Quinn and Gavin in one place.</p><p>But it turns out to not be weird at all.</p><p>They joke back and forth like old friends and I realize that somewhere along the line, they\u2019ve become friends since Quinn arrived in Caberra. Gavin treats me like he normally would and no one seems to notice that anything is amiss. No one would ever know that I kissed him on his boat and then took a nap in his arms.</p><p>No one except for Reece.</p><p>At one point, when Gavin hands me a fresh trash sack, his fingers linger over mine just a little too long. I glance up and smile at him at the same exact time that Reece looks my way. I catch her surprised expression and then her knowing grin. But she doesn\u2019t say anything.</p><p>Yet.</p><p>I have a feeling that it will come later.</p><p>For now, I enjoy watching my friends. They joke and laugh and rough-house. We\u2019re like a little club, tightly-knit and close. I like it. And even though I don\u2019t remember, they don\u2019t treat me like I\u2019m different. I like that, too.</p><p>I look around the little park that we are cleaning and can see vast improvement over what it looked like a scant two hours ago when we arrived. The broken wood and trash has all been picked up and bagged and it once again looks like a place where children would play. It\u2019s a good feeling to know that we did this.</p><p>We all stand and stare at it for a minute and our five shadows stretch onto the playground, side by side. Quinn\u2019s shadow is the tallest and mine is the smallest. The fact that he is standing next to me at the moment accentuates that fact.</p><p>\u201cYou really are a tiny tot,\u201d he says, only to me. His voice is low and quiet and instant warmth floods my nether regions. OhGoodLord. I\u2019m a wanton, wanton girl. Because two hours ago, I was lying in Gavin\u2019s lap.</p><p>I gulp.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t help my height,\u201d I tell him indignantly.</p><p>\u201cNope,\u201d he drawls. \u201cNo, you can\u2019t. I was just wondering, though, how do you fit that much temper into one tiny body, anyway?\u201d</p><p>I glare at him. \u201cI don\u2019t have a temper.\u201d</p><p>Everyone cracks up at this, but I don\u2019t see the humor.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d I insist. But no one listens as they gather up all of our things. My look of indignation is lost because no one is looking. I sigh.</p><p>\u201cWe should go grab some dinner someplace,\u201d Dante suggests. \u201cBy the time we get anywhere, it will be dinner time. Anyone up for it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d Reece says, leaning up to kiss Dante\u2019s cheek. He has a dirt smudge there and she wipes it off before she turns to me. \u201cMia?\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cSure. Just let me text my mom and let her know.\u201d</p><p>Everyone stares.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I ask as I pull out my phone. \u201cIt would be rude not to let her know.\u201d</p><p>They stare more.</p><p>\u201cI must have been a horrible monster,\u201d I mutter as I punch the text into my phone and then put it away.</p><p>\u201cNot a monster,\u201d Reece tells me. \u201cJust....different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmmph,\u201d I grunt as I swing into Gavin\u2019s Land Rover. \u201cWhere are we going to meet?\u201d I ask.</p><p>Dante rattles off a restaurant in town and Gavin nods. And then Quinn appears in my open door, filling it up with his large frame.</p><p>\u201cDo you mind if I catch a ride with you guys?\u201d he asks. I stare at him in surprise. I had just assumed that he would ride with Dante. He grins in their direction.</p><p>\u201cThey seem like they\u2019d like a little alone time,\u201d he says wryly. Reece is holding Dante\u2019s hand, laughing up at him and my heart constricts a little bit. I have to admit...I\u2019m a little jealous. They\u2019re so together. They fit just right. I wonder if I was ever jealous of them before?</p><p>But I\u2019m saved from thinking about it because I have to move to let Quinn in. I climb in the backseat.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re way too big to fit back here,\u201d I tell him. And it\u2019s true. He could fit, but he wouldn\u2019t be comfortable.</p><p>\u201cThanks, tiny tot,\u201d he tells me as he settles into the front. \u201cBut we\u2019ve already had the conversation about how big I am. You just don\u2019t remember it.\u201d He grins impishly and his eyes meet mine in the mirror of his visor. I have the sudden feeling it wasn\u2019t the size of his body that we had talked about. My heart flutters.</p><p>\u201cEveryone set?\u201d Gavin asks. And his eyes meet mine in the rearview mirror. His are warm and twinkly because he knows a secret. He knows how we spent the afternoon.</p><p>OhGoodLord. How do I get myself into these situations?</p><p>I have two gorgeous guys staring at me covertly from the front seat, both with hidden meanings and expressions in their eyes.</p><p>So I do what any normal girl would do.</p><p>I stare at my hands.</p><p>The entire way to the restaurant.</p><p>It seems to take forever, but we\u2019re actually there in twenty minutes. Trust me, though, twenty minutes is a long time to stare at your hands. By the time we get there, I am painfully aware that I need a manicure.</p><p>We pile out and I walk between Quinn and Gavin as we meet Dante and Reece at the door.</p><p>Because Dante is the Prime Minister\u2019s son, we don\u2019t have to wait for a table. We are immediately shown to the best table in the house, actually. It\u2019s situated in front of huge windows overlooking the sea. It\u2019s a beautiful view.</p><p>Or it would be if it didn\u2019t offer such a clear view of the city, showcasing the damage from the earthquake. Staring at it is unsettling. Surrounded by the serenity of Giliberti House, it is easy to be removed from the devastation that the quake caused. Not so here. It is readily apparent.</p><p>There is rubble everywhere, although streets have been cleared. Trees are down and some power lines too, which means that some people are still without power. It\u2019s the worst earthquake this country has seen in years and years.</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d Reece breathes as she takes it in. \u201cWe don\u2019t have earthquakes where I\u2019m from. Kansas has tornadoes, but not hurricanes or earthquakes. I didn\u2019t know what to expect when we arrived here. But it\u2019s even worse than I thought it would be.\u201d</p><p>Dante nods solemnly. \u201cWe\u2019re just happy that power has been restored to almost everyone. It\u2019s amazing how we take things like water or power for granted and we can be reminded so quickly of how lucky we are.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s right and everyone at the table is quiet for a minute, probably reflecting on that very thing. No one at the table, other than me, was really affected by the quake. Their homes are intact, they didn\u2019t even lose power and certainly no one else lost their memories. But I\u2019m really happy about that. I wouldn\u2019t wish it on anyone. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>We order and then chat while we wait for our food. I find that I am famished. And I am slightly fidgety. I\u2019m seated between Gavin and Reece and across from Quinn. Every once in a while, Quinn catches my eye. His gaze is sparkling and mischievous at all times. It\u2019s like he is just waiting for something to amuse him.</p><p>Every time he stares at me, my cheeks catch on fire.</p><p>And Reece notices this, too. She stares at me once, in confusion and then in realization. Not long after, she excuses herself to go to the bathroom.</p><p>And then pauses.</p> <p>\u201cMia, do you need to go?\u201d From the way she is staring at me, I decide that I\u2019d better go whether I need to or not. I hurry after her and when we reach the bathroom, she turns to me.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she demands. \u201cI can see the tension between you and Quinn. And I saw you flirting with Gavin. Seriously flirting, not his usual BS flirting. I\u2019m not trying to interfere, but Mia, you\u2019re supposed to be relaxing so that your memory can come back. I don\u2019t think that adding complications to your life is exactly what your doctor meant.\u201d</p><p>Reece means business. Her cheeks are flushed and I think she\u2019s ready to stamp her foot or something.</p><p>\u201cCalm down,\u201d I tell her. \u201cIt\u2019s not what you think. Or maybe it is. I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m so confused. All I know is that they\u2019re both sexy as hell. And I like them both for different reasons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never used to like Gavin in that way,\u201d she tells me. \u201cSeriously, you didn\u2019t. I always wondered why, because he\u2019s cute and funny, but you never did. You said it was because you\u2019ve seen him in diapers.\u201d</p> <p>I stare at her.</p><p>\u201cWell, see, that\u2019s the thing. I don\u2019t remember seeing him in diapers now, so that\u2019s no longer a problem. To me, he\u2019s a brand new guy who is sexy as hell and twice as funny. I don\u2019t remember anything. All I know is that he makes me feel safe. And trust me, right now I really need that.\u201d</p><p>Reece nods. \u201cI can see where that would be important to you right now. But what about Quinn?\u201d</p><p>I smile at the mere thought of Quinn.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s sexy as hell, too,\u201d I tell her. \u201cWhat girl wouldn\u2019t be interested in him?\u201d</p><p>Reece smiles now, knowingly.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s true,\u201d she admits. \u201cEveryone loves Quinn. Back home, he can\u2019t go anywhere without getting a girl\u2019s phone number shoved into his pocket.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHometown football hero?\u201d I guess. There\u2019s just something about him that screams that.</p><p>Reece nods. \u201cPretty much. And back home, Friday night football games are huge. The whole town turns out. Everyone loves Quinn. And the likeable thing about him is that he isn\u2019t very conceited about it. He\u2019s just a normal guy who happens to be gorgeous. He\u2019s always been that way. It\u2019s probably why I used to be totally in love with him.\u201d</p><p>She grins now. And I have to smile, too. Oh, to be her. Going from being in love with Quinn to Dante. Rough life. I mention as much to her and she grins again. Every time she smiles, her eyes sparkle. I like it. She\u2019s ornery-sweet, not ornery-bad ass like I\u2019m told that I am. Maybe it\u2019s why we get along. We\u2019re opposites.</p><p>\u201cDante is the one for me,\u201d she shrugs. \u201cFor the longest time, I thought it was Quinn. But one look at Dante pretty much changed that. You were here when it happened. You just don\u2019t remember it.\u201d</p><p>I sigh.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d she asks me now. She glances in the mirror and messes with her blonde hair, pushing one tendril behind her ear. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen Gavin actually serious about someone. I\u2019ve seen him with a lot of girls, but they were never girls he would like to keep. You\u2019re different. You have to know that.\u201d</p><p>I sigh again. Because I think I do know that. I know it from the tender tone he had in his voice on his boat. I know it from the soft expression he has in his eyes when he looks at me. I know it from his smile. And I know that I never, ever want to hurt him.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what to do,\u201d I admit. \u201cI really don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Reece turns to me.</p><p>\u201cI think you should just wait it out,\u201d she tells me wisely. \u201cGo on with life and deal with things as they come. Maybe you should just hang out with both of them and see what happens. I think that\u2019s what I would do.\u201d</p><p>My shoulders slump. I can\u2019t help it. I\u2019m not good at waiting. Hence my hatred for the words soon and eventually. Reece wraps an arm around them, bolstering me up.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be fine,\u201d she announces. \u201cSeriously. You\u2019re an amazing, funny, sweet person. Everything will work out for you.\u201d</p><p>I raise an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cSweet? You\u2019re the first person who has described me in that way.\u201d</p><p>She giggles. \u201cYou are sweet. It\u2019s deep down because you try to hide it. But you are a sweet person, Mia. And those of us who know you, know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019re the only ones who matter,\u201d I tell her stoically. \u201cThe ones who know me, I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly,\u201d she nods. \u201cWe\u2019re the only ones who matter. Family doesn\u2019t have to mean blood, Mi. We\u2019re your family. And even though your parents give you a hard time, they love you, too. They just don\u2019t understand you.\u201d</p><p>I nod. And there is a hard lump that has swelled in my throat and I don\u2019t even know why. Reece hugs me again.</p><p>\u201cWanna go back out?\u201d</p><p>I nod, not trusting my voice.</p><p>And when we walk out to the table, I am surprised to find Elena draped over Quinn\u2019s arm. Her voice is stickily sweet and her boobs are pressed against him.</p><p>Instant rage rushes through me, hot and red, but I tamper it down.</p><p>Quinn doesn\u2019t belong to me.</p><p>He\u2019s not mine.</p><p>But my heart doesn\u2019t seem to realize that.</p><p>Elena glances up and sees me, then sees Reece. Her expression changes drastically as she locks eyes with Reece. She turns into an ice-bitch directly in front of my eyes.</p><p>\u201cHey, farm girl,\u201d Elena says coolly. \u201cI didn\u2019t know you were back in town.\u201d</p><p>I start to interrupt, but Reece speaks first. \u201cAnd I didn\u2019t expect to find you draped across my table.\u201d</p><p>Elena smiles, her gaze tunneled on Reece. \u201cI\u2019m not. I\u2019m draped across your ex-boyfriend. Jealous?\u201d</p><p>She glances my way now and I feel frozen in place. This isn\u2019t the girl who I spoke with in the hospital. But if I\u2019m honest, I knew that she had this potential for bitchiness. I could sense it. And now she seems poised to strike, like a snake.</p><p>Dante breaks in, though, his voice calm yet cool.</p><p>\u201cLeni,\u201d he says warningly. I glance at him and he is staring at her, waiting. Expectant. He knows her. He has known her for a long time, so he is patient. Elena looks from him, to Reece, to me.</p><p>And then she smiles.</p><p>\u201cHi, Mia,\u201d she says, her voice sweet now. \u201cIt\u2019s good to see you. Would you like to come sit at our table?\u201d She motions to her table, which is crowded with a bunch of other girls our age. They are snickering as they watch this exchange. And I realize that there is no place I\u2019d rather be less.</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cNo, thanks. I\u2019m fine here.\u201d</p><p>Elena narrows her green eyes. \u201cAre you sure about that? It might be better for you over there.\u201d</p><p>My temper snaps to life.</p><p>\u201cHow so?\u201d I answer, my own green eyes narrowing. Elena smiles wolfishly.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the one who said you wanted to be friends,\u201d she reminded me. \u201cI told my girls that and they didn\u2019t believe me. If you don\u2019t sit with us, they\u2019ll think I was lying.\u201d</p><p>I can feel the incredulous gazes of everyone at the table. All of them are trained on my face, all of them are waiting for me to speak.</p><p>I swallow.</p><p>\u201cElena, I\u2019m happy to try and be your friend. But I won\u2019t be manipulated or used as a pawn. Ever. So, right now, I\u2019m going to stay here and eat my dinner.\u201d</p><p>I stare into her eyes and she stares into mine.</p><p>And then she smiles, relenting.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she says casually. As though it is no big deal at all, as if she is used to people turning her down. \u201cIf you change your mind, though, we\u2019re over there.\u201d</p><p>She slides her slender hand along Quinn\u2019s shoulders as she leaves and I want to break it. She smiles down at him.</p><p>\u201cCall me,\u201d she tells him.</p><p>I see a piece of paper in his hand and I have to assume it is her number.</p><p>My blood boils and I think my vision blurs for a second.</p><p>\u201cSee you later, D!\u201d she calls to Dante over her shoulder.</p><p>Elena is barely gone for a second before Reece marches over to Quinn and yanks the paper from his hand. She tosses it into the burning candle in the center of the table. We all watch it burn.</p><p>\u201cNot in this lifetime, Quinn,\u201d Reece says. \u201cShe\u2019s an utter bitch. You don\u2019t need that.\u201d</p><p>Quinn grins, lazy and slow. \u201cThanks for looking out for me, Reecie,\u201d he says. He looks amused. But his words stir something in me. And I freeze.</p><p>\u201cReecie Piecie,\u201d I murmur. I am stunned because it triggers something in my brain. Something familiar.</p><p>Reece stares at me. \u201cYes,\u201d she says excitedly. \u201cEveryone calls me that. Do you remember?\u201d</p><p>And for a second, I do. I see flashes of Reece and me. We\u2019re on the water, snorkeling, I think. She\u2019s screaming, then laughing. The sun is shining on the water and Dante is there. We\u2019re floating and it is peaceful and quiet and I can see why I loved the water. In my head, Reece grabs my hand and the three of us are floating in a circle.</p><p>And then the memory stops. I can\u2019t remember anything else.</p><p>But I have this piece now, this fragment of my past.</p><p>And that\u2019s something.</p><p>I nod.</p><p>\u201cI remembered something,\u201d I tell them. I sit down and share it. Dante grins.</p><p>\u201cI remember that day,\u201d he announces. \u201cYou were teaching Reece to snorkel. And I pretended to be a shark and scared the crap out of her.\u201d</p><p>Reece smacks at him now. \u201cI\u2019m still not over that!\u201d she sniffs. \u201cYou were a jerk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you love me anyway,\u201d Dante tells her, rubbing at his arm. She smiles up at him.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because you\u2019re not normally a jerk,\u201d she clarifies. Dante is still rubbing his arm.</p><p>Gavin looks at me. \u201cWas that all you remembered?\u201d</p><p>And I think he\u2019s really asking, Do you remember anything about me?</p><p>I nod. \u201cThat\u2019s all. But I think it\u2019s good. A memory came back. So that means that they aren\u2019t all gone forever. Maybe the rest will come back too.\u201d</p><p>And while everyone else seems encouraged, Gavin seems a little pensive. And I think I know why. He\u2019s afraid that if I remember how I felt about him before, I\u2019m not going to feel the same about him as I do right now.</p><p>And that\u2019s a very valid concern.</p><p>I\u2019m worried about the same thing, even while Quinn is staring at me from across the table with such a stormy dark expression. The sexual tension between him and I practically crackles and I want to leap over the table into his arms.</p><p>And then Gavin casually lays his arm over the back of my chair and his thumb rubs circles lightly on my shoulder. I glance into his eyes and I find such kindness there, such pure friendship amidst the sparkling dark depths and I gulp. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I don\u2019t know what, or who, I want.</p><p>I am a mess of utter, swirling confusion.</p><p>At this point, I honestly don\u2019t know if I want my old memories back or if I wish they\u2019d stay gone forever.</p><p>As I look around the table, at the laughing and friendly faces of my friends, I\u2019m beginning to realize that my life is pretty good right now. I might not know what I want, but I\u2019m pretty sure that I don\u2019t want anything to change.</p> <p>At all.</p><p>And I know that my memories have the potential to change everything.</p><p>Chapter Fourteen</p><p>My bedroom has a private balcony. I think all of the bedrooms here at Giliberti House do. I\u2019m sitting on mine tonight, alone, under the dark sky filled with twinkling stars. The night air is cool and it brushes over my skin softly, like tropical velvet fingers.</p><p>And I\u2019m feeling nostalgic and poetic.</p> <p>I don\u2019t know why.</p><p>There is a book lying open in my lap. It feels good to lose myself in someone else\u2019s world tonight, someone else\u2019s fictional drama. Because my own drama is too real and raw.</p><p>There is a knock on my bedroom door, soft and light. And before I can call out, the door opens and Reece is there. She\u2019s wearing pajamas and holding a small box.</p><p>\u201cI brought you something,\u201d she announces as she crosses my room and joins me on the balcony. \u201cYou love these. They\u2019re good for anything that ails you. You bought them for me when I was here this summer.\u201d</p><p>She thrusts the box into my hands and I peer inside.</p><p>Tiny chocolate volcanoes sit amidst tissue.</p> <p>I raise an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cChocolate therapy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there a better kind?\u201d she tosses back.</p><p>\u201cExcellent point,\u201d I answer. I pop one into my mouth and then I almost melt into my seat. \u201cOh my gosh. Yummo.\u201d</p><p>Reece looks satisfied. \u201cRight? I braved the scary gypsy lady for you. That\u2019s how much I love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cScary gypsy lady?\u201d This intrigues me. Reece sighs.</p><p>\u201cThe woman in town who sells these is terrifying,\u201d she tells me. \u201cYou laugh about her, but she\u2019s got these cloudy eyes that see right through a person. And she always mutters vague things about people, as if she can see our future. Last time I was here, she told me that I was strong enough to handle anything. It was like she knew what was going on in my life. It was creepy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you?\u201d I ask. \u201cStrong enough?\u201d</p> <p>Reece looks at me, gorgeous in her blonde, girl-next-door way. She finally nods.</p><p>\u201cYes. I was. And I am. It\u2019s something I learned while I was here. Everyone is strong enough. Sometimes, they just don\u2019t know it. You\u2019re strong enough too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re very profound, you know that?\u201d I nudge her jokingly. But honestly, I\u2019m not joking. Reece has given me some pretty good advice so far.</p><p>I look at her. \u201cSo, I guess my best friend is a sage, then.\u201d</p><p>She laughs. \u201cI don\u2019t know about that. But you\u2019ve never steered me wrong, either, so I guess we\u2019re good for each other.\u201d</p><p>I offer her a chocolate.</p><p>\u201cThank you for being my friend,\u201d I tell her sincerely. \u201cThank you for sticking with me even when I don\u2019t remember how good of a friend you actually are.\u201d</p><p>Reece looks at me like I\u2019ve suddenly grown two heads.</p><p>\u201cSeriously? That\u2019s what friends do. You would do the same for me.\u201d</p><p>I honestly hope that is true, that I\u2019m a good enough person for that.</p><p>We lean back onto our chairs and stare at the stars. Reece wraps her sweater more tightly around her and then pulls something from her pocket.</p><p>\u201cI almost forgot,\u201d she tells me. She hands it to me.</p><p>A picture in a silver frame.</p><p>It\u2019s Dante, Gavin and me, and we\u2019re standing in front of the sea. Sunshine bathes our bare shoulders and we\u2019re wearing swimsuits. I have blue and green stripes in my dark hair, an interesting, peacock-like combination. It\u2019s clear that we are having a good time because we\u2019re all laughing. It\u2019s a candid shot, not posed. Gavin\u2019s eyes are twinkling and he\u2019s bending toward me. Dante is laughing at us.</p><p>And I wish I could remember the joke.</p><p>But I don\u2019t.</p><p>Reece watches me and I feel my lips curve into a smile, simply from the happy expression on my face in the picture.</p><p>It makes me feel warm inside.</p><p>\u201cDante had this, so I had a copy made for you and framed. It was from a beach party this past summer. I love it. In fact, I love it so much that I had a copy made for me, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I tell her sincerely. \u201cVery much. It\u2019s like you\u2019ve handed me a piece of my life, like I have a glimpse of who I was through this picture. I love it.\u201d</p><p>Tears well up in my eyes and I don\u2019t know why. I wipe at them impatiently.</p><p>Reece looks at me sympathetically.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay to be upset,\u201d she tells me. \u201cAnyone would be. And you\u2019re handling it so much better than most people would. Cut yourself some slack, Mi.\u201d</p><p>And her words make me cry.</p><p>It\u2019s like the barrier that I\u2019ve built around myself lately crumbles down and I gulp at the air, sucking at it like a fish on a sidewalk as I heave in wracking sobs.</p><p>At first Reece is shocked, then she grabs me and pulls me to her. She pats my back and murmurs soothingly to me as I cry. And surprisingly, it feels good. When I\u2019m finally finished and I\u2019m lying in Reece\u2019s lap, I feel cleansed. It\u2019s like my tears washed my anxiety away.</p><p>At least, temporarily.</p><p>And I decide that if Gavin was right and I never cry, I might change that. A good cry every once in a while might be a good thing. A cleansing thing.</p><p>But I do feel bad for falling apart on Reece.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I tell her. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to fall apart on you.\u201d</p><p>She rolls her eyes. \u201cDo you know how many times I\u2019ve fallen apart on you? Trust me, I owe you a few breakdowns.\u201d</p><p>I smile and nod like I know, even though we both know that I don\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cYou know what you need?\u201d Reece asks. \u201cYou need some ice cream. With fudge and marshmallows. And then a bubble bath. Come on.\u201d</p><p>I follow her from my bedroom, down the stairs and into the kitchen. There\u2019s a soft nightlight shining in there, like a golden beacon. I love this kitchen. It\u2019s warm and cozy, definitely a room where a family thrives. I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m drawn to it like I am. But it practically feels like the pulse of this large house beats from this room.</p><p>Reece pulls things from the cupboard and drags a couple kinds of ice cream from a large freezer.</p><p>We make two of the biggest ice cream sundaes in the history of the world and then make our way out to the terrace. We eat our ice cream curled up on elaborate wrought iron chairs and surrounded by fragrant flowers.</p><p>\u201cI love it here,\u201d Reece tells me with a sigh. \u201cEverything is so beautiful. I\u2019m going to lobby hard to finish our senior year here. We\u2019re needed here anyway.\u201d</p><p>I look at her, at my friend who seems to have such a big heart. She\u2019s innocently licking her spoon when I hear a deep voice from behind me.</p><p>Quinn.</p><p>\u201cIs this a party and I wasn\u2019t invited?\u201d</p><p>He asks this as he saunters into the gardens. I think he saunters everywhere. There\u2019s simply no other way to describe the way he moves. It\u2019s fluid and confident.</p><p>And sexy.</p><p>\u201cNope,\u201d Reece tells him. \u201cBut I guess it is now. Isn\u2019t it always a party when you\u2019re around?\u201d She grins at him and their manner is relaxed and easy, like two people who have grown up together, because that\u2019s exactly who they are. They both have the same charming American accent and the same friendly way about them.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s so strange that you guys didn\u2019t end up together,\u201d I tell them. Reece looks over at me, startled, while Quinn laughs.</p><p>\u201cDid you hear that, Reecie? I told you that we were perfect together.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s kidding though and it is apparent. They are relaxed and friendly, but there is no sexual chemistry between them at and it\u2019s hard to imagine that there ever was. Quinn nudges her shoulder, but he sits in the chair next to me. Something inside of me is happy about that, satisfied. I can smell him on the breeze, an outdoorsy man smell. I like it.</p><p>Reece rolls her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t date Quinn,\u201d she tells me. \u201cBecause we know everything about each other. For example, I know that he passed out when he was giving blood last year.\u201d She laughs again and Quinn glowers at her.</p><p>\u201cFor the last time,\u201d he tells her. \u201cThe doctor said that there was a real medical reason for that\u2014a vaso-vagal nerve reflex or something.\u201d</p><p>Reece giggles. \u201cWhatever, little kittie,\u201d she laughs. \u201cMeow!\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m staring at her, wondering why the heck my seemingly sane friend is meowing at Quinn when she catches a glimpse of my face and laughs harder.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a nice way of calling him a pussy...cat.\u201d She tacks the last word on as an afterthought. And then I have to laugh. Because the P-word coming out of sweet little Reece\u2019s mouth in any context just doesn\u2019t seem right.</p><p>And then I meow at Quinn too, just because it is funny to associate him with the P-word in any way, shape or form.</p><p>So that is how Dante finds us a few minutes later.</p><p>Reece and I are leaned together, meowing at big, strong Quinn under the light of the moon. We look like lunatics, I\u2019m sure. And we most certainly sound like it. But I don\u2019t even care. I grin up at Dante.</p><p>\u201cHey, D,\u201d I smile.</p><p>Dante smiles back, then startles.</p><p>\u201cD?\u201d</p><p>I look at him for a second, startled too, before I shrug. \u201cIt\u2019s probably because I heard Elena call you that earlier.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not sure, though. It could be a memory. I have no idea. But I\u2019m distracted by listening to Reece complain about how Elena apparently calls Dante \u201cD\u201d just to annoy her now, and then by listening to her lecture Quinn on the fact that he needs to stay far, far away from Elena because she is a mean witch who would probably eat kittens for breakfast if she could, raw and with the fur still on.</p><p>They both listen to her patiently.</p><p>And then patiently ignore her.</p><p>Apparently, they\u2019re accustomed to her funny little outbursts.</p><p>Dante wraps an arm around Reece\u2019s shoulders and turns to me.</p><p>\u201cMia, are you settling in all right? Is your room okay?\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cI love my room and the balcony. Thank you so much for letting us stay here.\u201d</p><p>Dante waves his hand. \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re here. It\u2019s like a party. Well, it would be if Gavin were here, too.\u201d</p><p>Gavin.</p><p>Immediately, thoughts of him flood my mind and I feel guilty for sitting here with Quinn and I don\u2019t know why. Neither of them belong to me. And I don\u2019t answer to either of them. Yet whenever I\u2019m with one, I feel guilty about the other. I sigh. My life is complicated.</p><p>Dante is tugging at Reece. \u201cI think it\u2019s time for bed,\u201d he tells her. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a long day and you haven\u2019t been sleeping well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because I\u2019m jet-lagged,\u201d she tells him, somewhat grumpily. He smiles patiently. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI know, little Sunflower,\u201d he tells her. \u201cAnd you get grumpy when you\u2019re jetlagged. That\u2019s why you should go to bed now. You\u2019ll feel better in the morning.\u201d</p><p>She growls, but it is a harmless, delicate growl. I give her a hug and tell her good night and then they are gone. Quinn and I are the only ones left and I stare at him.</p><p>\u201cSo, you really passed out when they took your blood?\u201d I ask curiously. I\u2019m trying to imagine this giant of a boy fainting. His hands are so big that it seems like he could palm my head if he wanted to.</p><p>He grins ruefully.</p> <p>\u201cI went down like a rock,\u201d he admits. \u201cDoes that ruin your macho image of me?\u201d He\u2019s still grinning, totally unconcerned. He knows that it doesn\u2019t ruin anything for me. If anything, it makes me like him even more.</p><p>If that is possible.</p><p>But I tell him exactly the opposite.</p><p>\u201cOf course it does,\u201d I tell him laughingly. \u201cI\u2019ll never look at you the same.\u201d</p><p>He is unconcerned as he moves closer to me. I take a whiff of his shirt as he leans in. Big mistake, because now I can\u2019t concentrate on what he is telling me. His man-smell has my hormones tap-dancing.</p> <p>\u201cWell, do you want to?\u201d</p><p>Quinn is looking at me and I have no idea what he asked me. My attention was distracted by my stupid tap-dancing hormones.</p><p>\u201cI guess,\u201d I tell him, secretly praying that I\u2019m not agreeing to do something horrible.</p><p>He looks at me in amusement. \u201cWell, don\u2019t get too excited. But I think a walk would do you some good, out here in the fresh air. And of course, there\u2019s me. I would do you good, too.\u201d</p><p>I suck in my breath and he laughs.</p><p>My hormones do jazz hands.</p> <p>And then Quinn pulls me to my feet.</p><p>We walk through the gardens and I can\u2019t help but notice that he hasn\u2019t let go of my hand. His is huge and strong and has callouses on the fingers. My heart speeds up; fast, faster, faster until I can hear it roaring in my ears. As he guides me over a loose stone tile, I am pressed against him and I stare up at him, his eyes frozen on mine.</p><p>Time seems to stop.</p><p>I can count my heart beats.</p><p>Everything is a blur.</p><p>He bends his head.</p><p>His lips meet mine.</p><p>My mind gets blown.</p> <p>For real.</p><p>He pulls away and stares down at me, his gaze intense and dark and smoldering.</p><p>Yes, smoldering.</p><p>I urge myself to remember to breathe.</p><p>He grins. And my knees weaken.</p><p>\u201cSo, you don\u2019t feel the need to meow now? I\u2019m not a pussy...cat now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You\u2019re more like a lion,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>Then I grin and kiss him again. We kiss for quite a while, actually, until my hands are clutching his back and I am gasping for breath.</p><p>When Quinn finally pulls away, he looks satisfied.</p><p>\u201cReady to walk?\u201d he asks casually, as though he hasn\u2019t just addled every wit that I have by playing tongue twister in my mouth. I nod silently, not really trusting my voice.</p><p>Quinn is a fantastic kisser.</p><p>That much is true.</p><p>We walk in the moonlight for a half hour or so. Quinn tells me everything that he\u2019s learned about the estate since he\u2019s been here, things that I should know but don\u2019t. He shows me the building where I normally work. He shows me the factory buildings where the gourmet olive oils are made. And then we make the long walk back to the house.</p><p>I walk slowly because I don\u2019t want the evening to end.</p><p>He walks me to my room and kisses me yet again.</p><p>And I definitely don\u2019t want him to leave, but obviously he has to.</p><p>After I go inside my bedroom, I have to lean against the door for quite a while before my shaking knees feel strong enough to walk to my bed.</p><p>I meow at myself.</p><p>Because I totally deserve it.</p><p>Chapter Fifteen</p><p>I dream about Quinn.</p><p>And then I dream about Gavin.</p><p>Why do they both have to be such amazingly awesome kissers?</p><p>Why do I have to be so freaking indecisive?</p><p>Why is my heart so clueless?</p><p>Oh My Word.</p><p>When I wake in the morning, the sunshine is cheerful, but I\u2019m not. Because I feel like an utter loser. I kissed two sexy guys in one day. And I honestly don\u2019t know which kiss I enjoyed more. There\u2019s clearly something wrong with me.</p><p>I jump in the shower and then get dressed.</p><p>And then I text Reece.</p><p>Want to go into town with me?</p><p>She answers back immediately. Sure. Where are we going?</p><p>To fix my hair, I text her.</p><p>She answers with a smiley face and I\u2019ll be there in five.</p><p>Reece is literally in my room in five minutes. She looks at me and smiles. She looks fresh and cute in a pair of cut-off jean shorts, pony-tail, snug t-shirt and a pair of cowboy boots.</p><p>Yep. Cowboot boots.</p><p>With shorts. And she totally pulls it off.</p><p>\u201cWhat color are you thinking?\u201d she asks as we wind our way downstairs.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I muse. \u201cPink?\u201d</p><p>She grins again. \u201cPink has always suited you.\u201d</p><p>My mother is in the dining room having breakfast and I bend and kiss her cheek. I ignore the startled look on her face and tell her that I\u2019m going to town.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be back in a bit!\u201d I tell her over my shoulder. She\u2019s still too surprised by my display of affection to say anything.</p><p>Reece has Dante\u2019s keys to his fancy Maserati. I decide he must love her a lot to let her drive this car. It has so many bells and whistles that I can\u2019t even figure all of the buttons out. I settle into the passenger seat as Reece drives the curvy roads into Valese. I also commend her on figuring out all of the buttons on this dashboard.</p><p>\u201cI grew up driving farm trucks,\u201d she tells me conversationally. \u201cIt took a while to get used to driving Dante\u2019s car because it\u2019s just so nice. But that\u2019s not a problem that you have. Your little car is really nice, too. And it\u2019s what you learned to drive on. You never had to learn on a three-on-the-tree old truck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree-on-the-tree?\u201d I ask. She nods.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s an old fashioned stick shift. You shift the gears on a shifter on the steering column, instead of on the floor. But once you learn on something like that, you can pretty much drive anything,\u201d she tells me cheerfully. \u201cSo it was probably a good thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll remember how to drive,\u201d I tell her. \u201cI haven\u2019t tried since the accident.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay,\u201d she answers. \u201cWe\u2019ll go get your car later and give it a try.\u201d</p><p>I smile at her because she really is trying to make my life normal. She doesn\u2019t even act afraid to be the one with me when I try to drive. She\u2019s brave. So I tell her that. She laughs.</p><p>\u201cNo, brave is waking you up before 10:00 a.m. Driving with you was always a little terror-inducing, so I\u2019m used to it already.\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes and laugh and we\u2019re in town before I know it.</p><p>I stare out my window, watching the buildings that pass by. I keep thinking that if I look at things that I should know hard enough, I\u2019ll recognize them. It hasn\u2019t happened yet, though. Reece parks and we stroll down the main strip. Cute boutiques line each side of the cobblestone street. People swarm in loosely woven crowds on the walk. I feel like some of them stare at me.</p><p>\u201cDo you think they know me?\u201d I ask Reece. She shrugs.</p><p>\u201cProbably. I\u2019m sure they know who you are.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s hard to ignore the stares, but I give it my best shot.</p><p>\u201cI wonder how much money I have?\u201d I muse curiously. \u201cI mean, I have a credit card in my purse, but I don\u2019t know how much I can spend on it.\u201d</p><p>Reece giggles. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s something you have to worry about,\u201d she answers. \u201cYou used to go on crazy shopping sprees and never even blinked. I\u2019m pretty sure you just use your credit card and then your dad pays the bill.\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cOkay.\u201d That seems awfully nice of my father. I\u2019ll have to remember to thank him.</p><p>Reece pulls me into a trendy little shop and I find several cute outfits. Leggings and mini-skirts, flowing shirts, chunky jewelry. I can\u2019t decide which one to get, so I get them all. I need clothes anyway. Most of mine were destroyed in the quake and I don\u2019t like what my mom bought for me. I never knew there were so many shades of beige in the world.</p><p>Reece looks over my haul in amazement.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I raise an eyebrow. She shakes her head.</p><p>\u201cNothing. There\u2019s just not one black thing in the bunch.\u201d</p><p>That is interesting. \u201cI guess maybe I didn\u2019t like wearing black so much as I liked the reaction I got from it,\u201d I muse. \u201cI don\u2019t know. But I don\u2019t feel the urge to buy it now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine,\u201d Reece assures me. \u201cYou should buy what you want. And apparently, your gut is telling you to buy a lot of hot pink.\u201d</p><p>I smile. \u201cI want to accessorize with my hair. Which reminds me, we need to go have that done.\u201d I keep one of my new outfits on, complete with a cute pair of canvas sneakers and fingerless gloves. I feel trendy and sort of skater-chic.</p><p>Reece leads me out and down the street to a little spa. I don\u2019t have an appointment, but once I tell them my name, they fit me right in. Apparently, Dante\u2019s not the only one around here that gets special treatment. Hmm. Perhaps being the daughter of the Minister of Defense comes in handy. Except for when people stare at me in public, that is.</p><p>Within a couple of hours, my hair is two shades darker with hot pink streaks threaded through it. I stare in satisfaction in the mirror.</p><p>\u201cI love it,\u201d I assure my stylist. \u201cIt seems so cheerful and happy.\u201d</p><p>Reece smiles at me. \u201cYou look like yourself again\u2014but with different clothes. I love the new look, Mia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo do I,\u201d I tell her happily. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m on the way to figuring out who I am. Whoever said retail therapy doesn\u2019t work is insane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree. It works like a charm for me every time. Are you hungry? There\u2019s a bunch of little bistros and cafes down the street.\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cI\u2019m famished. Spending money apparently works up an appetite.\u201d</p><p>She links her arm through mine and we make our way to a little area on the other end of the street that is surrounded by restaurants. There is an open air seating area in the middle, apparently shared by all of the bistros. We grab a sandwich and then head for a table.</p><p>And as we walk, I hear a tinkling, familiar laugh.</p><p>I turn my head and find Elena.</p><p>And she is sitting on Gavin\u2019s lap.</p><p>I freeze, my feet unable to continue walking.</p><p>Elena is perched delicately against Gavin\u2019s chest and she is giggling into his ear. He is laughing too, because Gavin is almost always laughing. He seems perfectly happy to have her on his lap, pressed against him. He is definitely not making any move to get her off. He seems to be enjoying himself, actually.</p><p>Reece is staring too.</p><p>\u201cUm...\u201d she stutters. She has no idea what to say.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d I tell her. \u201cSeriously. I don\u2019t own him.\u201d</p><p>But it feels like someone has impaled my heart. And I don\u2019t even know why. I truly don\u2019t own him. He owes me no explanations. But it feels like he just yanked my heart out and drop-kicked it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I head over in their direction.</p><p>\u201cMia, you have to keep in mind, Gavin is different than us. He\u2019s so easy-going. He pretty much goes with the flow in any situation. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s thinking nothing of this.\u201d</p><p>Reece has found her tongue now. I nod, but I\u2019m not really listening. Instead, I march up to the table next to them and set my tray down. Gavin is startled and then surprised and I can tell that he is really wishing now that Elena wasn\u2019t on his lap.</p><p>Tough crunch.</p> <p>She is, so he needs to answer for it.</p><p>Okay. Maybe I\u2019ve changed my mind. I guess I do want an answer.</p><p>But I don\u2019t ask for it. Instead, I smile cheerfully at them.</p><p>\u201cHey, guys. What\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>Gavin doesn\u2019t push Elena off, but instead, he leans around her to talk to me.</p> <p>\u201cI like the hair,\u201d he tells me with a grin. \u201cI just bumped into Elena and she decided to sit with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean, on you?\u201d I correct him. His smile falters. He can see that I\u2019m annoyed.</p><p>Elena chooses to move now and she smiles at me. I can\u2019t see anything malicious in her smile, although I might be wrong.</p><p>\u201cHi, Mia,\u201d she tells me. She completely ignores Reece.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d I answer.</p><p>But honestly, I\u2019m not really interested in anything she has to say. She looks gorgeous today, as usual. She\u2019s got a revealing tank top on that plunges to a low V in the front and in the back. I love the shirt. I just wish that she didn\u2019t look so perfect in it while she was on Gavin\u2019s lap. Her hair and make-up is perfect, as always, and truly, you can barely see the scar on her cheek now.</p> <p>Gavin hands me a little boutique bag.</p><p>\u201cI got you a gift. I hope you like it,\u201d he says.</p><p>And his voice is hopeful. I\u2019m not sure if he\u2019s hopeful that I\u2019m not mad for finding Elena on his lap or if he\u2019s hopeful that I\u2019ll simply like his gift. And Reece might actually be right. He doesn\u2019t seem unsettled at all that I found them like this. Maybe he really didn\u2019t think anything of it.</p><p>But that\u2019s a little unsettling to me.</p><p>Because I don\u2019t like it. It\u2019s okay to be friends with members of the opposite sex. But if you like someone else, you really shouldn\u2019t have other girls sitting on your lap.</p><p>That\u2019s just my opinion.</p><p>However, I don\u2019t voice that right now. Instead, I peer into the bag and see a white oblong box. I lift it out and pull off the box top and find a silver watch. It is relatively simple and slender, with a feminine band and a diamond on the 12 and the 6. It\u2019s gorgeous.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s inscribed,\u201d Gavin tells me. I flip the watch over and on the back it reads It\u2019s always Gavin Time.</p> <p>I forget my agitation with him momentarily and laugh. I can\u2019t help it. He\u2019s so completely arrogant, but charmingly so. He makes it so hard to stay mad.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful,\u201d I tell him. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>I start to put it on, but Gavin shoves my hand away and fastens it for me. And then he lifts my hand to his lips and kisses it. He lets his lips linger on my skin, warm and soft. And he\u2019s staring into my eyes and anyone in the vicinity can feel the atmosphere change around us. It\u2019s sexually charged.</p><p>I know it.</p><p>Reece knows it.</p><p>And Elena certainly knows it. I can see the interest on her face now and I doubt that\u2019s a good thing. She has a strange smile pasted on her face as she watches us. But I\u2019ll worry about that later.</p><p>For now, I\u2019ve got other things to worry about.</p><p>Like how to stay mad at Gavin.</p><p>But that turns out to be an exercise in futility. He has me snapped out of my anger within ten minutes and we sit and chat with him for at least an hour more. Elena pretends that Reece doesn\u2019t exist, and Reece keeps her back to Elena. But other than that, everything feels normal.</p><p>Gavin has the ability to make anyplace feel like a party. We\u2019re laughing and joking and talking to the strangers sitting around us and I feel infinitely at peace.</p><p>That is, until Elena gets up to leave. She tells me goodbye, ignores Reece and then she bends to kiss Gavin on both cheeks in the normal European fashion. But her kisses linger. And her hands brush over his chest. Then she pushes her boobs against him. And when she turns, her eyes meet mine and I see something unsettling there, lurking beneath the fake friendliness and sparkling emerald depths.</p><p>A challenge.</p><p>Chapter Sixteen</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what to do,\u201d I tell Reece on the way home. \u201cI just don\u2019t know what to do. I love so many things about Gavin. I love how he knows me. I love how he gets me. I love how he makes everyone feel so comfortable at any given time. But that same exact thing is a curse, too. Look at this episode with Elena. Rather than push her off his lap, he rolled with the punches and ate it up. Would he be that same way if we dated? Because I wouldn\u2019t be okay with random girls sitting on his lap.\u201d</p><p>Reece glances at me. \u201cOkay, is it time for me to answer you now? Because I\u2019ve tried four times and you haven\u2019t stopped talked long enough for me to get a word in edgewise.\u201d</p><p>I smile sheepishly. \u201cI know. I think I must chatter when I\u2019m nervous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do,\u201d she confirms. \u201cBut in answer to your monologue, this is just what Gavin is like. You\u2019re right about all of the traits that you just named. And he is very loyal to his friends. That\u2019s something else positive about him. And honestly, I have no idea what Gavin is like with a girlfriend. He\u2019s always been a player- or ever since I\u2019ve known him, anyway. He\u2019s never been serious enough to get involved with a girl for any amount of time. He\u2019s accidentally left a long trail of broken hearts behind him.\u201d</p><p>I slump against the seat. \u201cThis isn\u2019t helping.\u201d</p><p>Reece stares at me sympathetically for a minute before she watches the road again. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s a hard choice. They\u2019ve each got pretty great qualities.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you tell me more about Quinn?\u201d I ask. \u201cI mean, something that you haven\u2019t told me yet?\u201d</p><p>Reece thinks about it for a minute.</p><p>\u201cWell, he\u2019s loyal, too. He dated my friend Becca for years. And even though most of the girls in school had it bad for him, he never cheated on her. Ever. He\u2019s good at everything he does. He rides bulls in competitions with Becca\u2019s brother, Connor. And he wins. And of course, he\u2019s a good football player. He\u2019ll probably go to college on a football scholarship. He loves animals, also. He wants to be a veterinarian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, he must have a big heart,\u201d I muse. Reece nods.</p><p>\u201cVery big,\u201d she tells me. \u201cI remember our freshman year. We had this really small kid in our freshman class. He was always getting picked on by the upperclassmen football players. They kept shoving him into trashcans in the locker room, or closing him in lockers. You know, stupid Neanderthal jock crap. Well, one day, Quinn found the kid, Mike, in the office getting an ice pack from the nurse. Apparently, when the older boys shoved him into a locker that day, they had broken three of his fingers. Quinn took care of it the next day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cQuinn started walking everywhere with Mike. Through the halls, sitting with him at lunch, etc etc. And when the upperclassmen still tried to give Mike crap, Quinn told them they\u2019d have to go through him first if they wanted to keep messing with Mike. And they didn\u2019t want to. Quinn was a big bruiser even as a freshman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to Mike?\u201d I ask.</p><p>Reece smiles.</p><p>\u201cWell, Mikey is now Quinn\u2019s best friend in the world. He actually had a growth spurt so he\u2019s a bit taller than he was. Quinn got him playing ball and now he\u2019s our quarterback, actually. And he never bullies the freshman the way he was bullied.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a nice story,\u201d I tell her. \u201cI bet Mike will pay it forward. He\u2019ll probably do nice things for other people because he\u2019ll always remember how nice Quinn was to him.\u201d</p><p>Reece nods. \u201cHe\u2019s already paid it forward, tons of times. He\u2019s a good guy. Just like Quinn. Quinn is the kind of guy that makes you want to be a better person. He\u2019s got such a... good soul. I don\u2019t know how else to describe it. He\u2019s got a pure heart, through and through.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can see that about him,\u201d I admit to her. \u201cI really can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, please, Mi. Don\u2019t hurt him. I know he seems like a player. And he\u2019s inadvertently broken a few hearts, but he didn\u2019t mean to. I would really hate to see him get hurt, even if it was on accident.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat should I do?\u201d I whisper to her as we turn onto the Giliberti property. She shakes her head.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat would you do?\u201d I ask.</p><p>She shakes her head again. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019m horrible at this stuff.\u201d</p><p>I sigh. \u201cWhat good are you?\u201d I tease. She shrugs.</p><p>\u201cWell, I always know when to bring you chocolate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue. That\u2019s a good enough reason alone to keep you.\u201d</p><p>As we pull up into the circular drive in front of the house, I see Quinn sitting on the huge wrap-around porch with Dante. They appear to be deep in conversation and they are laughing. That\u2019s a good sign. And truly, there should be a law or something against two such good-looking boys being in one spot. They make it hard to concentrate.</p><p>As we cross the lawn to them, they look up and see us and both grin at the same time. I think the heavens open up and the angels sing.</p><p>Okay, that might be an exaggeration. But that\u2019s definitely what happened in my head. Their smiles are just that gorgeous and bright. And Quinn\u2019s is sexily crooked.</p><p>\u201cHey girls!\u201d Dante calls out. \u201cDid you leave anything in the stores or did you buy it all?\u201d</p><p>We are carting a lot of bags. I am woman enough to admit that.</p><p>The boys get up and help us carry it into the house. As they do, Quinn turns to me.</p><p>\u201cYou look really pretty,\u201d he tells me. \u201cI\u2019m glad the stripes are back.\u201d</p><p>His eyes are sparkling mischievously, but his expression is sincere.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I tell him. \u201cI feel more like myself. I think.\u201d</p><p>He laughs. \u201cYou\u2019ve definitely got your swagger back,\u201d he tells me. Dante turns around in front of us.</p><p>\u201cI was just saying that we should have a beach party tonight to try and forget about our stress for a bit. What do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m all for it,\u201d Quinn chimes in. Reece laughs.</p><p>\u201cQuinn, you\u2019ve never met a party yet that you didn\u2019t like,\u201d she accuses laughingly. He doesn\u2019t deny it. Instead, he helps me carry my bags to my room.</p><p>As we walk in, he looks around. I\u2019m thankful that I didn\u2019t leave any panties lying around.</p><p>\u201cSee something you like?\u201d I ask teasingly. He grins.</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d he answers. \u201cWhat do you think about the beach party tonight?\u201d</p><p>Short pause. He stares at me. I have no idea what he\u2019s waiting for.</p><p>I shrug as I drop my bag on the bag.</p><p>\u201cIt sounds fun,\u201d I tell him. \u201cYou\u2019re going, right?\u201d</p><p>He grins. \u201cI\u2019ve apparently never met a party that I didn\u2019t like,\u201d he tells me charmingly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI can see that about you,\u201d I reply. \u201cSo, you\u2019ll be there?\u201d</p><p>He nods. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t miss it.\u201d</p><p>Another long pause.</p><p>Then he gives me an ornery gaze and then he\u2019s gone.</p> <p>When Reece and I are ready to leave later in the evening, Dante is waiting for us on the porch. But Quinn is nowhere to be found.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Quinn?\u201d I ask curiously. Dante shakes his head.</p><p>\u201cHe left earlier, but he\u2019ll meet us there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow will he know where to go?\u201d I ask. \u201cHe\u2019s not that familiar with Valese yet, is he?\u201d</p><p>Dante looks amused. \u201cWell, Elena picked him up. So I\u2019m guessing she\u2019ll show him the way.\u201d</p> <p>Reece and I both freeze and stare at Dante. He holds his hands up innocently.</p><p>\u201cHey, don\u2019t look at me. He\u2019s a big boy- he can do what he wants.\u201d</p><p>Reece narrows her eyes. \u201cBut you let him go with her? She\u2019s a viper. She\u2019ll eat him up for breakfast and then ask for more.\u201d</p><p>Dante doesn\u2019t seem concerned. \u201cI thought she ate kittens for breakfast?\u201d he teases. \u201cBesides, if he\u2019s still with her for breakfast, I doubt he\u2019ll care if she asks for seconds.\u201d</p><p>Reece squeals and smacks his arm and I gulp.</p><p>I ignore their bantering as I try not to physically cringe. How could Quinn have gone with Elena? Did he not think it was important enough to mention that when I asked him if he was going? Instead of being quiet and staring at me, he could\u2019ve brought that small fact to my attention.</p> <p>So apparently, I\u2019m not going to have to choose between Gavin and Quinn. The choice has been made for me.</p><p>I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m relieved about that or not.</p><p>I don\u2019t think I am.</p><p>I try not to think of it as we drive to the beach and then walk over the sandy dunes. The party is far back from the public beaches, secluded on private property. I\u2019m told that I\u2019ve been to many of these parties. I don\u2019t remember a one.</p><p>But when we arrive, it looks like a good time.</p><p>Tons of kids are already here, laughing and playing around. I don\u2019t remember any of them, although I do recognize a few from when they visited me in the hospital.</p><p>A group of boys is throwing a ball back and forth. A group of girls is watching. Another co-ed group is splashing in the surf. There are huge containers of beer and wine-coolers buried in ice. There are tables of food, mostly fresh seafood and bread. There are bonfires. And I love the atmosphere here. It\u2019s happy and carefree. The flickering bonfires in the dying sunlight provides the perfect ambience for a beach party.</p><p>I unfold a chair and sit in it. Reece sticks a wine cooler in my hand.</p> <p>\u201cYour favorite,\u201d she tells me. \u201cJust don\u2019t have twelve of them.\u201d</p><p>She gives me a stern look, making me wonder if I have a drinking problem or something. And then she settles into the chair next to me while Dante gets in on the ball-throwing action. The boys, by this point, are taking off their shirts. And not because it\u2019s hot outside, either. Next to the sea, the breeze is actually a bit chilly today, but they\u2019re stripping down anyway. I shake my head. The male species is so crazy sometimes.</p><p>Dante leaves his shirt on though and Reece shakes her head regretfully.</p><p>\u201cThere comes a time when that boy needs to let loose with the rest of them,\u201d she tells me. \u201cHe\u2019s so happy to be home, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about you?\u201d I ask her. \u201cAre you happy to be here instead of home in Kansas?\u201d</p><p>Reece picks at the label on her bottle and thinks about that for a minute.</p><p>\u201cI love it here,\u201d she finally says. \u201cEven though when we were in Kansas, it felt like Dante was removed a bit from the pressures of being who he is, which was good, I think I still love being here more. I mean, of course I miss my mom and Becca and my grandparents, but there\u2019s just something about Caberra that made me fall in love with it. Honestly, though, I would be happy wherever Dante is. I know, that sounds corny. But it is true.\u201d</p><p>And I know that Dante feels the same way. I can see it in the way his gaze seems to find her periodically no matter what he\u2019s doing. He checks on her and I think it\u2019s sweet. And once again, jealousy rears its ugly head. I really do hope that someday, someone looks at me the way Dante looks at Reece.</p><p>Honestly, no sooner have I had that thought when a pair of dark, twinkling eyes meet mine from across a crowd of boys.</p><p>Gavin.</p><p>He\u2019s standing against one of the coolers talking with another boy that I don\u2019t know. He\u2019s got on a pair of black shorts and a white shirt, unbuttoned at the neck and rolled at the sleeves. He\u2019s barefoot and he\u2019s gorgeous. He looks like a swimwear model for a European magazine. That\u2019s how gorgeous he is.</p><p>I smile automatically as his eyes meet mine.</p><p>He smiles back.</p><p>And my heart flutters like a thousand butterflies.</p><p>\u201cWell, well,\u201d Reece drawls, watching the silent exchange. \u201cLook who is forgiven.\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes at her. \u201cYou said it yourself. He didn\u2019t mean anything by it. He\u2019s a natural flirt. He doesn\u2019t want Elena.\u201d</p><p>I twist my new watch on my arm. I can practically feel his name pressing into my skin. It\u2019s always Gavin Time. I almost giggle again just thinking it, but then I realize that it\u2019s fairly true. I\u2019m always in the mood for Gavin.</p><p>That has to say something, right?</p><p>I make my way toward him.</p><p>He meets me in the middle.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d he says softly. \u201cNice bling. Was it a gift?\u201d He motions toward my watch. I smile.</p><p>\u201cYeah. This guy I know gave it to me.\u201d</p><p>Gavin raises an eyebrow. \u201cOh, really? Do I need to do some ass-kicking? He seems like a pretty awesome guy. I don\u2019t want any competition.\u201d</p><p>I laugh and he laughs and then he links his arm with mine.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s walk,\u201d he suggests.</p><p>As we walk away from the crowd and toward the water, I catch sight of Quinn and Elena approaching the party. She is draped over his arm and he looks to be enjoying it. Of course, to be fair, he\u2019s a red-blooded guy and her boobs are pressed into his arm. Of course he\u2019s going to enjoy it. I swallow hard and try not to plot murderous things against Elena and her boobs.</p><p>I\u2019m walking with Gavin, I remind myself.</p><p>Quinn and Elena don\u2019t matter to me.</p><p>But as we pass them and Quinn\u2019s eyes meet mine in a smoldering stare, I know that he does matter. A lot.</p><p>I fight the urge to turn around and look at him again.</p><p>And I win. I don\u2019t look.</p><p>Take that, self-control.</p><p>Somehow, I am able to focus on Gavin and our walk and the beautiful beach. I put Quinn out of my mind. Once or twice, I glance in his direction and find Elena laughing into his ear. Once, his arm is even snaked around her waist and at that, I squeeze my eyes shut and turn away. It\u2019s the last time I peek at him.</p><p>Gavin looks at me now, a bit of concern on his handsome face.</p><p>\u201cIs everything alright?\u201d he asks me. \u201cYou seem distracted.\u201d</p><p>He leads me to a huge piece of driftwood and sits me down. He sits so close that his thigh presses into mine. I like the feeling.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I lie. \u201cIt\u2019s weird, knowing that I\u2019ve been to a bunch of these parties and I don\u2019t remember any of them. Not a thing.\u201d</p><p>Gavin studies me for a second. Then he brushes a thumb against my cheek. His eyes are soft as he stares into mine.</p><p>\u201cWant me to help?\u201d he asks quietly. \u201cI can tell you what you normally do at these parties.\u201d</p><p>I stare at him for a moment. I know that whatever is going to come out of his mouth will be utter bullshit but I can\u2019t stop myself. I nod.</p><p>\u201cOkay. What do I usually do?\u201d</p><p>Gavin stares out to sea for a minute, then turns back to me, picking up my hand.</p><p>\u201cWell, first you usually eat dinner with me. We grab some fresh crab legs because you love them. I have oysters because, well, you know what they say about oysters and the libido. Then, you drink about a dozen wine coolers. And then, at some point in the evening, you get sick. And I spend a chunk of time hunting for someone else to babysit you so that I don\u2019t have to hold your hair back while you vomit. That\u2019s what usually happens. So, I would suggest not drinking too many tonight.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. I guess he really is telling the truth. I was a party girl. Hmm.</p><p>\u201cGood advice,\u201d I tell him. \u201cSo, you need to eat oysters for your libido? Your libido isn\u2019t strong enough without an aphrodisiac?\u201d</p><p>Gavin stares at me for a second, before he bursts out laughing.</p><p>\u201cTouch\u00e9,\u201d he tells me. \u201cTrust me, my libido is healthy and thriving. Also, I forgot to mention one thing that you always, always do at these parties.\u201d</p><p>And now I know to disregard whatever comes out of his mouth next because his eyes are twinkling, his mouth is curving up. But I still smile and ask what it is.</p><p>\u201cYou always go skinny-dipping with me,\u201d he says impishly. \u201cAlways.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s my turn to burst out laughing now.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re crazy,\u201d I tell him. \u201cI call bullshit. You\u2019re insane.\u201d</p><p>He nods solemnly. \u201cI know,\u201d he tells me, unconcerned. \u201cBut you love me anyway.\u201d</p><p>And I do love him.</p><p>I realize that right now. I don\u2019t know what way I love him, but I do love him. Whether he\u2019s the familiar brother that I never had or ultra-hot boyfriend material remains to be seen. But one way or another, I love him.</p><p>It\u2019s a startling, yet comforting feeling.</p><p>Chapter Seventeen</p><p>I restrain myself and only have two wine coolers. I can\u2019t imagine drinking any more than that, because honestly, I don\u2019t enjoy the taste. But Reece and Dante both seem proud of me for my restraint, so I decide that I definitely must\u2019ve been a wild party girl of some sort. Gavin had been telling the truth, after all.</p><p>Night falls quickly out here overlooking the water and I watch the sun sink down over the horizon in an explosion of gorgeous colors that ricochet off the water and bathe everything in gorgeous light. Reece wraps her arm around my shoulders.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think, Mi?\u201d she asks. It\u2019s an open ended question.</p><p>\u201cAbout what? How the world began? I think it was divine design. About world relations? I think that Caberra is in a good place- both economically and politically. I know the prime minister, so I feel good about that.\u201d I\u2019m joking now and Reece rolls her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI meant, what do you think about your life?\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I answer. \u201cAnd I thought you were asking a big question.\u201d</p><p>She laughs now, but she waits for my answer. Because she\u2019s my friend, she\u2019s actually interested. Drat. I have to give her a thoughtful answer.</p><p>Um.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I admit to her. \u201cI honestly don\u2019t. I think about it all the time, because I can\u2019t help it. I\u2019m constantly wondering how the new me compares to the old me and which one is actually me. It\u2019s confusing and exhausting. Like tonight, it would seem that I used to be a party girl. But I honestly don\u2019t feel the need to get wild or crazy. It\u2019s like I\u2019ve spun around in a 180 from the girl I used to be. And I wonder if it\u2019s partially because of the head injury. I mean, will I go back to normal? Or was my old \u201cnormal\u201d just a fa\u00e7ade? Was I pretending to be someone that I wasn\u2019t? I just don\u2019t know and it is frustrating.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I pause here and take a breath.</p><p>Reece stares at me. Her eyes are wide and blue and I can see empathy in them, even though it\u2019s dark.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t feel sorry for me,\u201d I tell her. \u201cSeriously.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d she answers. \u201cI just sort of know how you feel.\u201d</p> <p>I raise an eyebrow. \u201cYou\u2019ve had amnesia?\u201d</p><p>She laughs. \u201cNo, but I\u2019ve had an identity crisis. When Dante and I first got together, I felt a little lost. There I was, in love with Caberra\u2019s \u2018prince\u2019, but I was- and still am- a farm girl from Kansas. I\u2019m not from a big, fancy family. I didn\u2019t even know how to act at those black tie functions that Dante always has to attend. If it weren\u2019t for you, I would\u2019ve been totally lost. But I eventually figured out that no matter what situation I am in, I am always me. And that will always include the fact that I am a Kansas farm girl, born and bred. I will always eat steak sauce on my steak and wear cowboy boots and I will always feel more comfortable in worn out jeans than a ball gown. But that\u2019s okay- because that\u2019s what makes me, me. Your feisty spirit makes you, you. You will always be witty and slightly rebellious. No matter how you choose to act, or who you choose to be, you will always be that sassy person that we all love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do feel sassy,\u201d I tell her. \u201cSo that must be an innate trait of mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she smiles. \u201cIt is. Now, where did our boys get to?\u201d</p><p>Our boys?</p> <p>I turn with her and search out the crowd. Quinn is sitting next to Elena and they are deep in conversation. He doesn\u2019t see me watching and that is fine. Dante and Gavin are standing together on the edge of the crowd. Gavin instantly catches my eye and grins. And I am instantly reminded that his grin is knee-weakening.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s got a gorgeous smile,\u201d I remark offhandedly to Reece.</p><p>\u201cYup,\u201d she agrees. \u201cAnd he knows how to use it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup,\u201d I answer. Because he so, so does.</p><p>Dante motions to Reece to come join him and Gavin makes his way to me. He grins as he approaches, and I feel a little like a lion and its prey. Gavin doesn\u2019t look away the entire time he is walking. His dark eyes are fixed on me.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d he drawls as he stops next to me. \u201cAbout that skinny-dipping thing? I honestly think you\u2019ll feel more like yourself if you start doing things that you used to do. I\u2019m no doctor, but it makes sense. Don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p> <p>I smile. \u201cMaybe,\u201d I say playfully and Gavin\u2019s eyes instantly fill with hope.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>I shrug and decide to throw caution to the wind.</p><p>\u201cSure. Why not? Everyone else is back over that way and it\u2019s just you and me here. And apparently, we used to do this all the time. So, it\u2019s not like it\u2019s anything you haven\u2019t seen before.\u201d</p><p>I know as well as he does that we\u2019ve never skinny-dipped. And he looks a bit startled now, but then he masks it and returns to his ultra-cocky self.</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d he tells me. \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re up for it.\u201d</p><p>What he really means is, Challenge Accepted. He\u2019s not going to back down.</p><p>And neither am I.</p> <p>I smile.</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d I say. I walk down to the water and start unbuttoning my shorts. The moonlight hits the water in ripples and makes it seem black, instead of the blue that I know it is. It\u2019s chilly and as I shrug out of my shirt, the breeze sends goose bumps forming down my arms. I rub them as I turn to Gavin.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you still dressed?\u201d I ask. I know the answer is because he was watching me undress. But I pretend to not know that.</p><p>\u201cUm, no reason,\u201d he says as he kicks off his shorts and unbuttons his shirt. He peels it off and then we\u2019re left staring at each other in our underwear. He\u2019s very muscular in a tall and slender way. Probably from swimming so much. I\u2019m still wearing my bra and I suddenly feel exhilarated- although I don\u2019t know if it is from standing in front of Gavin in my panties or whether it is from all the rippling muscles on his abs.</p><p>It\u2019s one or the other, though.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d I tell him. I turn for the sea and strip off my underwear and bra at the water\u2019s edge, tossing it behind me into the sand. I dive into the water headfirst, allowing the cold water to rush over my naked skin.</p><p>I love this feeling. It\u2019s like I have no restrictions, no inhibitions and I\u2019m totally free. I splash to the surface and turn to find Gavin right in front of me. His wet arms slide against mine and my breath freezes on my lips.</p><p>His gaze is dark.</p><p>His smile is wicked.</p><p>And so is mine.</p><p>\u201cCome here,\u201d he tells me, pulling me to him. I slide against him, and every inch of us is naked and pressed together. Every inch.</p><p>My heart pounds as he kisses me. His hands are pressed into my back, pushing me closer into his chest. His fingers are warm while the rest of us is cold from the sea. The moon shines onto us, making our skin seem silver in the dark.</p><p>His lips slide away from mine, leaving my breath ragged and panty.</p><p>\u201cKiss me again,\u201d I instruct him, wrapping my arms around his neck.</p><p>\u201cDone,\u201d he whispers. He lifts me up and I wrap my legs around his waist and he\u2019s pressing against me there. And I like it. I don\u2019t take the time to wonder what that makes me. Instead, I just kiss him again and again.</p><p>An image of Quinn pops into my head, but it is quickly overshadowed by an image of Quinn with Elena. Quinn made the choice, I didn\u2019t.</p><p>Gavin is right for me. I can feel it. And I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s not the wine-coolers talking. I only had two. He knows me. Really knows me. And that\u2019s got to be right for me in a time when I don\u2019t know myself.</p><p>His breath is ragged now, his heart pounding against my chest. His gaze is inky black in the night.</p><p>\u201cMia,\u201d he whispers. And he opens his mouth to say something else, but we are interrupted by flashing lights. White pops of light.</p><p>What the hell?</p><p>I\u2019m disoriented for a minute, looking around to see where the light is coming from.</p><p>\u201cGo,\u201d Gavin yells to me, pushing me toward the shore. And then he\u2019s gone. I can\u2019t even see where he went. I\u2019m confused and then I see dark shadows moving on the shore with the white light.</p><p>Cameras.</p><p>Someone is taking our picture.</p><p>I\u2019m astounded. Everything is happening in blurs and I don\u2019t even know what to do but sink into the water so that whoever it is can\u2019t see me naked. It\u2019s all so disorienting.</p><p>And then Quinn is striding toward me. His face is grim and set and he is taking off his shirt as he plows into the water. He doesn\u2019t even slow down.</p><p>When he reaches me, he stares down at me.</p><p>\u201cOh, the messes you get yourself into,\u201d he says quietly.</p><p>He scoops me out of the water and drapes his shirt around me. And then he carries me out of the sea. Men in suits have chased away the people with cameras. Dante\u2019s security detail, apparently. And I see Gavin on the beach, pulling his clothes on.</p><p>He starts to talk to me, but I interrupt, still ensconced in Quinn\u2019s arms.</p><p>\u201cYou left me!\u201d I snapped. Gavin looks surprised.</p><p>\u201cWhat would you have me do?\u201d he asks, still clearly surprised. \u201cThey wanted our pictures. If our parents saw those pictures, we\u2019d be in serious trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho are they?\u201d I ask, still aware that Quinn hasn\u2019t set me down. I can feel his strong arms encircling my naked body. His heat is scorching. Or that might be my temper. I can\u2019t tell.</p><p>\u201cThey are trying to get our pictures for their gossip sites,\u201d Gavin tells me. \u201cThey like to sneak out here when they think we might be having a party to catch unruly behavior on film.\u201d</p><p>And it dawns on him that these are things that I don\u2019t remember.</p><p>\u201cOh, god. Mia, I\u2019m so sorry. I forgot that you wouldn\u2019t know what was going on. I\u2019m sorry. I thought you would know to run for cover. I guess I did leave you.\u201d</p><p>He is genuinely apologetic. But that doesn\u2019t change the fact that he left me. And I\u2019m fairly certain that when I was standing there like a deer in the headlights, they got many pictures of me. Naked.</p><p>OhLord.</p><p>\u201cCan you take me home?\u201d I ask Quinn. He nods.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t put me down, he just turns and walks over the sand dunes with me in his arms. I ignore Gavin\u2019s shouts from behind us as I look up at Quinn.</p><p>\u201cYou can put me down,\u201d I tell him. \u201cI should get my clothes. They\u2019re on the beach.\u201d</p><p>As if on cue, Reece jogs up with my clothing in her arms.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got her, Reecie,\u201d Quinn says before she can even speak. She nods.</p><p>\u201cOkay. I just thought Mia might want to get dressed before you go back to the house.\u201d</p><p>Of course I do.</p><p>I can\u2019t imagine the look on my mom\u2019s face if I walk- or get carried- into Giliberti House as naked as the day I was born.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Reece,\u201d I sigh. \u201cI guess some things don\u2019t change. I\u2019m still getting myself into messes.\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head. \u201cGavin shouldn\u2019t have left you. He feels terrible though. I\u2019ll see you at the house. Here\u2019s Dante\u2019s keys. You can take his car. I\u2019ll find Dante and then meet you there. I\u2019ll have Gavin drop us off.\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cThank you- take your time.\u201d</p><p>She ducks back into the night and I see her blonde hair fading into the dark.</p><p>Quinn still hasn\u2019t put me down.</p><p>\u201cThere are bath houses up ahead,\u201d he tells me. \u201cYou can go inside and change without worrying about someone else taking a picture. I\u2019ll guard the door.\u201d</p><p>I am instantly relieved and indebted to him and impressed with his consideration. I am all of these things at once. And because there are so many things, I don\u2019t even know how to express them.</p><p>So I just nod and say, \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>Quinn grins down at me. \u201cSure thing, tiny tot.\u201d</p><p>He puts me down in the doorway of one of the little bath-houses and I very quickly pull on my clothes. When I walk back out, he is still alone, leaning against the wall of the building. He\u2019s so big, but he\u2019s got such a big heart, too.</p><p>\u201cI will always remember you plunging into the water to save me,\u201d I tell him quietly. \u201cEspecially because you don\u2019t know how to swim.\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t that big of a deal,\u201d he tells me. \u201cSeriously. The water was only chest deep. I saw you out there looking so confused and I knew I had to come get you. I had clothes on,\u201d he reminds me. \u201cYou didn\u2019t. That made it a little easier for me to walk in front of everyone. What possessed you to go skinny-dipping, anyway? You had to know that you guys are constantly watched for photo ops. If Dante\u2019s there, there\u2019s going to be photographers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI forgot,\u201d I told him. \u201cI didn\u2019t remember that.\u201d</p><p>And I feel deflated.</p><p>I feel the total opposite of how exhilarated I felt when I was in the water.</p><p>I still feel naked, though\u2014just in a different way.</p><p>\u201cOf course you didn\u2019t remember,\u201d Quinn says. \u201cSomeone should have reminded you.\u201d He\u2019s sympathetic now. And I hate that. But I don\u2019t say anything. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>We ride to Giliberti House in silence. The irony that Quinn is driving Dante\u2019s car isn\u2019t lost on me. I can\u2019t help but constantly feel surprised at how well they get along now, when I know that they were on rocky terms at first.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s with you and Dante?\u201d I ask as Quinn pulls into the Giliberti drive. He glances over at me.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou get along so well,\u201d I point out. \u201cI figured that since you used to have a thing for Reece that you and Dante would butt heads.\u201d</p> <p>Quinn laughs, a sound that is husky and rich in the night. Even his laugh has an American accent. I like it.</p><p>\u201cDante and I are fine,\u201d he tells me. \u201cHe didn\u2019t know what to think of me at first, but once he realized that Reece and I aren\u2019t a thing, he was fine. He\u2019s really easy to get along with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs are you,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s what I\u2019m told,\u201d he tells me as he uncurls himself from behind the wheel. He comes around the car to open my door, like a gentleman. I love that, too.</p><p>He opens my door and helps me from the car and then walks me up the manicured sidewalk. He doesn\u2019t dwell on the fact that I was skinny-dipping and that he bailed me out. He\u2019ll never know how grateful I am. So I tell him.</p> <p>He shakes his head again.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a problem,\u201d he tells me again. \u201cYou would\u2019ve done the same for me.\u201d</p><p>And I would have. I really would have. That makes me happy. Maybe I really am a bad-ass.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you go to the party with Elena?\u201d I ask him suddenly, before I lose my bad-ass nerve. He looks startled.</p><p>\u201cBecause she asked me. You didn\u2019t,\u201d he points out. \u201cWhy did you go with Gavin?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cI didn\u2019t. I went with Reece and Dante.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut you went skinny dipping with Gavin,\u201d Quinn reminds me.</p><p>\u201cThat was just me being impetuous,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>He stares down at me, his sandy blonde hair curling up at his neck.</p><p>\u201cWell, maybe me going to the party with Elena was impetuous, too.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s still staring at me, strong and silent in the dark. We\u2019re lingering in the doorway of the house, each of us hesitant to open the door and end this conversation. The whole mood feels like an open-ended sentence. And I want it to keep on going.</p><p>With Quinn.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m supposed to want,\u201d I admit to him. His eyes are like liquid chocolate as he assesses me. He seems pensive.</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re the only one who can figure that out,\u201d he finally tells me. And I know he is right.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m just so confused,\u201d I murmur. \u201cAnd I hate that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, tiny tot, don\u2019t stress so much about figuring it out,\u201d Quinn says. \u201cWhen you\u2019re ready, the answer will be clear. You\u2019ll know what you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will?\u201d I ask. I watch his lips as he speaks.</p><p>\u201cYou will,\u201d he assures me. \u201cTrust me.\u201d</p><p>And as I picture his strong arms carrying me out of the sea while I was wrapped in his shirt, I know that I do.</p><p>I do trust him.</p><p>It\u2019s a good feeling.</p><p>Chapter Eighteen</p><p>I see a side to my mother this morning that I wish could have stayed locked in my lost memories. She\u2019s so furious about the pictures taken of me last night that she looks like she could just spit.</p><p>In fact, she accidentally does spit on my cheek as she hisses angry words. I wipe it away and patiently listen to her tirade.</p><p>And as she says something about me embarrassing her and my father, a memory slams into me.</p><p>You\u2019re an embarrassment.</p><p>I inhale sharply as a few more blurred and jagged memories come rushing back. I see a few faces and images and colors and it leaves me feeling nauseous and overwhelmed in a sea of emotion.</p><p>\u201cWe fought that day,\u201d I whisper. My knuckles are white as I fist them in my lap. My mother looks at me from my bedroom windows.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She is startled now.</p><p>\u201cThe day of the earthquake. You told me that I embarrassed you. We fought and I left. I was supposed to have been in my bedroom, but I sneaked away to go diving with Gavin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou remember?\u201d she asks, her face pale. My mom is a small woman, and she looks severe today with her dark hair pulled into a tight chignon at her neck. I nod.</p><p>\u201cI remember. That much, anyway. But it\u2019s something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d she sighs. \u201cIt\u2019s something. Yes, we fought that day. You had your nose pierced. I wanted you to take it out so that you didn\u2019t embarrass your father. You refused. Then you left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd when I was in a coma, you took my nose ring out and colored my hair,\u201d I say calmly. She nods wordlessly.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I ask. I feel limp. Even though I know what she did. I need an answer now. Am I really such an embarrassment to my parents that they would try to change me when I wasn\u2019t even conscious?</p><p>\u201cBecause we had to,\u201d she answers simply. \u201cI thought that maybe everything could change. But I see now that it\u2019s not going to happen. You\u2019re going back to your old ways and there\u2019s nothing I can do about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy old ways?\u201d I raise an eyebrow and try to force my temper down. I feel my blood starting to boil and that\u2019s not a good sign. \u201cJust because I see life differently than you do, doesn\u2019t make me wrong,\u201d I tell her. \u201cIf you and dad weren\u2019t so rigid about trying to force me into the mold of a person that I\u2019m not, maybe you would see that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not trying to change you,\u201d my mother says. \u201cWe\u2019re just trying to change your behavior. You\u2019ve got to realize that a mature person has to sometimes act in ways that they would rather not, simply because of their position in life. You have to act respectful and mature because of your father. It\u2019s just the way it is.\u201d</p><p>And all of a sudden, I see her point.</p><p>I don\u2019t know why, but it\u2019s like a revelation.</p><p>An epiphany.</p><p>Maybe Gavin was right and I can still be who I am, but I don\u2019t have to announce it to the world. Maybe I should fall into rank and do what is expected of me. At least part of the time. It wouldn\u2019t hurt me and it would make my life easier. I can do what I want on the side, but still do what my parents want. Then I wouldn\u2019t have to butt heads with them.</p><p>Butting heads with them takes so much energy.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I say simply.</p><p>My mother stares at me.</p><p>\u201cOkay?\u201d she\u2019s incredulous.</p><p>I nod. \u201cOkay. I\u2019ll try to be more considerate about daddy\u2019s image. I don\u2019t mean to be disrespectful.\u201d</p><p>My mother looks like she doesn\u2019t know whether to have a heart attack or whether she wants to cry and hug me.</p><p>So she just looks at me with her mouth open.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m being serious,\u201d I tell her. \u201cI\u2019ll try not to keep disappointing you.\u201d</p><p>And she flies into my arms with all the velocity of a raging bull.</p><p>A tiny raging bull.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not a disappointment,\u201d she tells me as she strokes my hair. \u201cI love you, Mia. Thank you for being so understanding. And for trying.\u201d</p><p>Holy cow. This was easy.</p><p>That\u2019s all I can think as my little bitty mother cries in my arms. I\u2019ve made her so happy by simply not railing against her. I think Gavin was onto something.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not changing my hair though,\u201d I tell her. \u201cBut I won\u2019t get my nose re-pierced.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeal,\u201d my mother smiles. And it honestly makes me happy to see her happy. She\u2019s looked miserable for as long as I can remember. And probably way before that.</p><p>I can imagine that I was partially to blame.</p><p>\u201cFresh slate?\u201d I ask her. I pull away and look at her face. Her eyes are as green as mine. And hers are wet.</p><p>She nods. \u201cFresh slate.\u201d</p><p>I hug her and am surprised by how good it feels...like a puzzle piece falling into place, somehow.</p><p>\u201cMia,\u201d she says slowly. \u201cI was dreading telling you this, but maybe it won\u2019t be so bad now. There is a benefit tonight at the Old Palace. It is to raise money for people who have been the hardest hit by the earthquake. There will also be a few awards. Dimitri is going to give you and the other kids an award for helping with the clean-up. You should probably go.\u201d</p><p>I stare at her. Obviously, if I\u2019m getting an award, I should go. But she seems so nervous about asking me.</p><p>\u201cHoly cow. I must have been a monster,\u201d I mutter for the twentieth time this week. \u201cOf course I\u2019ll go. I\u2019m sure Dante and Reece will be there, too, right?\u201d</p><p>Mom nods. \u201cYes. And Gavin and Quinn, too, among a few others.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s black tie?\u201d I ask. She nods again, looking pained. She\u2019s dreading my reaction, still. I smile pleasantly.</p><p>\u201cOkay. I\u2019ll need to go get a dress. But I look forward to it.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t look forward to it, but part of this new leaf that I\u2019ve turned over means that I will not throw a fit. My mom looks infinitely relieved.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Mia,\u201d she tells me. She gives me another hug before she leaves. And I\u2019m left alone in my bedroom.</p><p>I text Gavin.</p><p>Are u going to that benefit dinner tonight?</p><p>He answers, Yep. U?</p><p>I reply. Yes. Sigh.</p><p>Gavin comes back with, Do u want a ride?</p><p>I pause. I\u2019m sure Dante and Reece will be going, so I can get a ride with them. Plus, if I\u2019m honest, I have to admit that I\u2019m still a little annoyed with Gavin for leaving me like he did last night.</p><p>Yes, I understand that he was flustered and forgot that I didn\u2019t know what was going on. But still. He left me.</p><p>And Quinn saved me.</p><p>That fact isn\u2019t lost on me.</p><p>I sigh loudly.</p><p>No, that\u2019s ok. I\u2019ll catch a ride with Reece and Dante- and I\u2019ll see u there.</p><p>Gavin take a little longer to answer this time, but finally comes back with, Ok. And it is accompanied by a frownie face.</p><p>I don\u2019t know why I just did that. I honestly don\u2019t. But for some reason, all I can think about today is Quinn. And how he looked as he plunged into the water to carry me out.</p><p>It makes my heart flutter.</p><p>Gavin makes me feel safe because he knows me. But Quinn makes me feel safe because I feel like he would never let anything happen to me. Not that I need a protector, because I don\u2019t. But it\u2019s still a nice feeling.</p><p>I duck out of my room to find Reece. I find her, along with Dante and Quinn, out on the porch sipping at fresh lemonade.</p><p>Reece looks up, concern apparent on her face.</p><p>\u201cHow are you doing?\u201d she asks worriedly. I stare at her.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean? I\u2019m fine. Shouldn\u2019t I be?\u201d</p><p>Now she\u2019s the one who is confused.</p><p>\u201cThe pictures,\u201d she says slowly. \u201cAnd your mom was so upset. I bumped into her in the hall earlier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I answer. \u201cShe\u2019s okay now. I told her that I would try to stop being such a challenge for her. And I haven\u2019t seen the pictures. Should I see them?\u201d</p><p>Reece looks uncertain and she glances at Dante.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no reason you need to,\u201d he tells me. \u201cIt would just make you upset. It\u2019s our fault anyway. We should have reminded you that this happens to us sometimes.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cParticularly when Dante is around,\u201d Reece interjects.</p><p>\u201cBut this will blow over,\u201d Dante adds. \u201cIt always does. By this time next week, the gossip sites will be on to something else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d think that with all the real news with the earthquake, they\u2019d report about that,\u201d Quinn mutters. \u201cNot some teenagers at a party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t agree more,\u201d Dante answers. \u201cBut these websites are toxic and gossipy. They don\u2019t care about the real news. They just want things that will make people\u2019s tongues wag.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLike Mia standing in the sea topless,\u201d Quinn rolls his eyes and I cringe at his words.</p><p>\u201cPlease tell me that they didn\u2019t get a shot of my girls,\u201d I plead. And by girls, of course I mean my boobs. Reece looks pained.</p><p>\u201cWell, your girls are blurred out. But yes. It\u2019s clear that you\u2019re topless.\u201d</p><p>I cringe again. But there\u2019s nothing to be done. The damage is already done.</p><p>I square my shoulders.</p> <p>\u201cOkay. I\u2019m putting it out of my mind,\u201d I announce. \u201cSo what if half of Caberra has seen my girls now\u2014I\u2019ve got to think about other things. Are you guys going to the benefit tonight at the Old Palace?\u201d</p><p>They all nod. I turn to Reece. \u201cI\u2019ve got to go get a dress. Are you up for a short shopping excursion?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d she answers. \u201cI have to get a dress, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfect,\u201d I smile. Dante is already handing over his car keys, the ever-perfect, ever-dutiful boyfriend. He pulls Reece to him and kisses her on the forehead, warning her to be careful on the curves. She smiles sweetly and tells him she will. And then she takes the curves too fast, anyway.</p><p>Twenty minutes later, we\u2019re shopping. Which is apparently one thing that hasn\u2019t changed about me. I will always love to shop.</p><p>At 5:45 p.m., I\u2019m standing in front of the mirror in my room. I look pretty hot, I have to admit. My hair is pulled into a chignon and I like the way the pink streaks show. My dress is black and soft and clings to my curves, falling just above my knee. My shoes are kick-ass three inch heels with cute straps that criss-cross part-way up my calves. I\u2019m even wearing a strand of my mom\u2019s pearls. She was incredibly and amazingly happy about that. I wonder if I used to realize how little it would take to make her happy?</p> <p>When it\u2019s time to go, Dante, Reece, Quinn and I pile into Dante\u2019s Maserati. Quinn and I are crammed into the backseat, which seems even smaller than it normally would because Quinn is so enormous. He takes up way more than half of the space. He just sprawled out and then laughed at me because he had pinned me against the seat. But if I\u2019m honest, I will admit that I enjoy being crushed up against him.</p><p>He grins down at me, almost as if he can read my mind.</p><p>And I can see that he\u2019s enjoying the cramped quarters too. He stretches his arm out behind me and I curve into his shoulder.</p><p>And I like it.</p><p>I\u2019m not gonna lie.</p><p>Dante drives quickly into town. Like, bat-out-of-hell quickly. And that is too quickly because I\u2019m enjoying the heat from Quinn\u2019s body. Reece cringes as we cruise smoothly through the curves, but I don\u2019t blame her. It\u2019s where Dante had his car accident last summer.</p><p>I pause.</p><p>Did someone tell me that? Or was that a memory? I sigh. It\u2019s confusing sometimes. This amnesia thing really, really sucks. But it does seem like my memory is coming back in bits and pieces.</p> <p>When we arrive, I can see Dante\u2019s security detail following us. They\u2019ve been really good about trying to be inconspicuous. But in light of the assassination attempt last year, they are being very careful now. Particularly tonight, with all of these people swarming about. They aren\u2019t letting Dante out of their sight.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to find my father,\u201d Dante says. \u201cI\u2019ll meet up with you later?\u201d I nod and Reece leaves with Dante. The security detail follows. Quinn and I are left alone.</p><p>Again.</p><p>I look at him.</p><p>Then I look at the lines waiting to get into the Old Palace\u2019s ballroom.</p><p>\u201cI know a short cut,\u201d I tell him. And then we both stare at each other.</p><p>\u201cYou do?\u201d Quinn asks, one eye-brow raised. \u201cAnd you remember it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d I confirm in a whisper. \u201cI remember it.\u201d</p><p>The weird thing is that the memory just sort of appeared. It didn\u2019t spring out of nowhere with a big announcement. It\u2019s like it was just there, waiting for me to realize that I remember it.</p><p>So.</p><p>Strange.</p><p>I turn to Quinn. \u201cYes. I do remember,\u201d I repeat. \u201cFollow me.\u201d</p><p>And we duck behind the lines and through the back hallways. Security lets us pass because they recognize me.</p><p>\u201cHave a good evening, Miss Giannis,\u201d one of them says. He nods at me and I smile back. Quinn and I weave through the empty halls of the Old Palace.</p><p>\u201cThis building is amazing,\u201d Quinn tells me as we walk through a corridor with a gilded gold ceiling. The artwork hanging on the walls is authentic and expensive and there is exquisite art in every nook and cranny.</p><p>\u201cIt is,\u201d I agree. \u201cIt really is.\u201d</p><p>I wonder if I used to be blas\u00e9 about it. After all, I was born and raised around this stuff. But I enjoy seeing the wonderment on Quinn\u2019s face as he takes it all in. I hope that I remain like he is right now\u2014appreciative of the beautiful things in life, no matter how many times I see them.</p><p>Even if my memories come back.</p><p>The ballroom is decorated to the nines in silver and black decorations. I see Dante and Reece standing with Dimitri Giliberti toward the front of the room. He is in a military uniform with a sash, his typical formal dress.</p><p>And again, that is something that I suddenly remember as though it has been there all along.</p><p>Which it has.</p><p>I just didn\u2019t remember it until now.</p><p>I gulp.</p><p>My memories returning sporadically and without warning is a total mind bender. Seriously, I can barely wrap my mind around it.</p><p>So instead, I choose to ignore it.</p><p>\u201cWould you like to dance?\u201d I ask Quinn.</p><p>He stares at me hesitantly.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I cajole him. \u201cThe big brawny cowboy can ride a bull but can\u2019t dance?\u201d</p><p>And now he rolls his eyes.</p><p>\u201cIs that a challenge?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes it seem like a challenge?\u201d I ask innocently.</p><p>He sighs and grabs my hand. \u201cCome on, tiny tot.\u201d</p><p>I smile victoriously as he leads me onto the polished dance floor. The crystal chandeliers sparkle above us and servers in black-tails and white gloves sail through the crowds with trays of champagne.</p><p>Quinn pulls me to him and we smoothly dance around the ball room floor. I look up at him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a surprise,\u201d I admit. \u201cI figured you couldn\u2019t dance.\u201d</p><p>But then again, I figured he didn\u2019t own a pair of dress shoes, either. He\u2019s sexy as hell tonight in a tux and polished black loafers. What is it about a tuxedo that can make a boy go from handsome to movie star hot in two seconds flat? My heart flutters as Quinn grins at me crookedly.</p><p>And that\u2019s another thing. My heart has been doing a lot of fluttering lately, mostly over this crooked grin of his.</p><p>\u201cI can most certainly dance,\u201d he tells me needlessly. And I say needlessly because he is demonstrating that fact right now. He can most certainly dance.</p><p>His arms feel really good wrapped around me. I almost sigh because this moment feels pretty perfect. The music is soft and soothing, Quinn is handsome and strong, and I am pressed against his strong chest. He smells delicious. I could go and on about why this moment rocks.</p><p>But unfortunately, it doesn\u2019t keep rocking.</p><p>Because as I look up, I see Gavin. He is standing casually with Dante and Dimitri, with a champagne glass dangling loosely from his fingers at his side. He is the picture of casual elegance\u2014as if tuxedos were invented to be worn by him. But I\u2019m not distracted by how handsome he is. Because the look on his face startles me.</p><p>He\u2019s upset.</p><p>With me.</p><p>That is apparent. I stare into his dark eyes and he looks pointedly away. And he stays looking away. He doesn\u2019t glance back at me. My stomach sinks like a rock.</p><p>\u201cIs something wrong?\u201d Quinn asks, as he stares down at me. I shake my head.</p><p>\u201cNo. I mean, yes. Maybe.\u201d</p><p>He stares at me again, his blonde eyebrows furrowed as he tries to figure me out.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be back, okay?\u201d</p><p>He nods and releases my hand and I scamper through the crowd to get to Gavin. But when I reach the spot where he was, he isn\u2019t there anymore.</p><p>\u201cMia!\u201d I hear Reece call to me. I gaze around and find her in the crowd and she is gesturing wildly toward something behind me. I turn and see Gavin disappearing into a hall. I\u2019m after him like a shot.</p><p>I call out for him, but he doesn\u2019t stop.</p><p>So, I do the only thing I can think of to do.</p><p>I chase him.</p><p>I have no idea how he manages to stay so far ahead of me when I am running and he is walking. It\u2019s like something out of a bad horror movie. I just can\u2019t seem to catch up. I trip along in my heels until I finally get smart enough to take them off. And then I trip along after him barefoot.</p><p>But finally, he takes pity on me</p><p>As he reaches a door that opens to the outdoors, he turns. He is tall and lithe and handsome and he doesn\u2019t want to be with me. That much is apparent.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you need, Mia?\u201d And he sounds weary.</p><p>I\u2019m confused.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you running from me?\u201d</p><p>He smiles a small, tight smile.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not running. I\u2019m walking. You\u2019re short enough that you have to run to keep up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDetails,\u201d I sniff. \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t you stop?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I don\u2019t want to talk to you right now,\u201d he answers simply. And that answer hurts. Because out of everyone in my life, Gavin has always been there for me.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I ask softly.</p><p>\u201cBecause,\u201d he shrugs. \u201cI don\u2019t want to right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut why?\u201d I demand. \u201cYou have to have a reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I just realized something,\u201d he says. And his voice is cool and his eyes are a bit sad. It makes me apprehensive and scared to ask. But of course I ask anyway.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you realize?\u201d</p><p>Gavin is quiet as he stares at me. And the serious and slightly sad expression on his face scares me because I have never seen it before.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I blurt out. \u201cWhat is wrong with you? What did you realize?\u201d</p><p>Gavin sighs.</p><p>\u201cI realized that you have never looked at me like you were looking at Quinn just now. And you probably never will.\u201d</p><p>And then he turns around and walks into the night.</p><p>And I am stunned.</p><p>Because I think he might be right.</p><p>Chapter Nineteen</p><p>I have no idea if he is right or wrong or what. But it doesn\u2019t matter. Because the look on his face was so horribly sad that I just want to wipe it away.</p><p>\u201cGavin, please\u2014wait!\u201d</p><p>I chase after him and tug on his arm. He doesn\u2019t even look at me as he stops by the pool. He looks achingly handsome in the light of the moon. The water moves next to us in aquamarine ripples and I stare into his face. I find that I want to reach up and stroke his cheek or wrap my arms around his shoulders or hug him tight. But I restrain myself. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGavin, I\u2019m sorry. I told you... I don\u2019t know what I want. How can I possibly know that when I don\u2019t even know who I am?\u201d</p><p>I can hear the desperation in my voice and so can he.</p><p>His face softens a bit in reaction.</p><p>\u201cGav, I told you this on the boat the other day. I said that I was afraid to pursue this because I never want to lose you. And you said that it wouldn\u2019t matter\u2014that I would never lose you, no matter what.\u201d</p> <p>Now his eyes are really soft as he looks down at me.</p><p>\u201cSo, you don\u2019t want to lose me... but you don\u2019t know that you want me, either?\u201d</p><p>My heart hurts at his words.</p><p>Like, it literally hurts.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what to say, Gavin,\u201d I tell him. \u201cI know that I love you in some way. I know that you are sexy as hell and you make me laugh and you know me like no one else does. I know that I love being with you\u2014I love laughing with you and swimming with you and kissing you. But something seems to be holding me back and I don\u2019t know what it is.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019m crying now. I feel the tears streaking down my face and Gavin moves to wipe them away. I lean into his hand and he cups my cheek.</p><p>\u201cLet me know when you figure it out,\u201d he says softly.</p><p>And then he leaves me by the pool.</p><p>Alone.</p><p>I am stunned.</p><p>Gavin, easy-going, always laughing, always ready Gavin, just left me alone because I hurt him.</p> <p>And I definitely didn\u2019t mean to.</p><p>Yet I did.</p><p>And now my heart seriously hurts.</p><p>I sink to my knees by the water and cry. Anyone who ever thought I\u2019m a bad ass should see me right now, because I cry until my lungs hurt. The ugly kind of cry, too. Not the pretty, delicate sniff-into-a-tissue cry. Oh, no. I\u2019m crying the dreaded gut-wrenching, mascara-ruining ugly cry.</p><p>And I don\u2019t care.</p><p>I don\u2019t even care when I hear someone behind me.</p><p>\u201cI need a minute,\u201d I call out, sniffing into my hand. I don\u2019t have a tissue, so I wipe my snotty nose on my hand. Gross, but necessary.</p><p>\u201cAre you alright?\u201d</p> <p>Quinn\u2019s husky voice is quiet in the dark.</p><p>I freeze. I know I look like some sort of monster with black-rimmed swollen eyes and a runny nose. But worse than that, I don\u2019t want him to see me this way\u2014sad and broken. Not when he thinks I\u2019m some sort of bad-ass. And especially not when I\u2019m crying because I don\u2019t know what my heart wants. How pathetic is that??</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I tell him without lifting my head.</p><p>There is more rustling behind me. And then I feel his hand on my back. It\u2019s warm and large and comforting.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t seem fine,\u201d he says softly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d I admit limply. I look up now, knowing full well that he will see me in all of my raccoon-eyed glory. But he doesn\u2019t even flinch. He\u2019s just staring at me with the most concerned look.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d he asks simply. \u201cCan I help?\u201d</p><p>I swallow.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I tell him. \u201cCan you fix the holes in my memory so that I know what I want?\u201d</p><p>Quinn stares at me. He\u2019s serious and calm and thoughtful as he tries to decide what to say. Finally, his lips move. I know this because I\u2019m staring at them.</p><p>\u201cNo, I can\u2019t fix your memory,\u201d he tells me as he scoots closer to me. \u201cBut who cares? You don\u2019t need your memory to figure out what you want.\u201d</p><p>I snort, then remember too late that my nose is gunky and runny. I sound like a snotted up pig. I blush, but he doesn\u2019t seem to notice.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t,\u201d he insists. \u201cYou know who you are even if you don\u2019t remember it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what Reece said,\u201d I mutter. \u201cBut it\u2019s easy to say when you\u2019re not the one who is clueless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m clueless,\u201d he nods. \u201cTrust me. Or you can just ask Reece. She can tell you. I\u2019m very, very clueless about many, many things.\u201d</p><p>I smile now, even through my snot.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d I ask curiously. \u201cHow did you know I was out here?\u201d</p><p>Quinn shakes his head. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t hard. When you ran out of the room chasing Gavin, I didn\u2019t think it was going to end well.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m still now.</p><p>The night is cool against my skin and my heart beats hard against my ribs. It\u2019s so quiet out here that I can almost hear it.</p><p>\u201cYou knew I was chasing Gavin? And you still came after me?\u201d</p><p>Quinn nods slowly.</p><p>\u201cHow did you know that it wasn\u2019t going to end well?\u201d</p><p>Quinn rocks back on his heels and he stares at the pool thoughtfully.</p><p>\u201cI just knew. Gut instinct.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you came after me.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m stunned by this. What kind of boy would come after me when he knew that I was chasing another guy? Clearly, one who is self-confident. And Quinn is that. And clearly, a boy who is caring and kind. And Quinn is that, too.</p><p>But still.</p><p>Holy Whoa. How amazing is he?</p><p>\u201cThank you for not pressuring me,\u201d I tell him randomly. I feel so tired and drained. And I\u2019m just so thankful for his presence. So I tell him that.</p><p>He smiles.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome. And I\u2019m not going to pressure you. Do I think you\u2019re cute as hell and twice as sexy? Yes. I do. Do I love your sassy-ass sense of humor? Yep. That too. But I\u2019m going to wait until you realize that you like me, too. I might be clueless about many, many things, but even I know that I can\u2019t make someone like me. If someone likes you, they\u2019ll realize it. And then it will be worth the wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I\u2019m worth the wait?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m whispering now. I don\u2019t know why because we\u2019re all alone in the moonlight. Quinn smiles his sexy lop-sided, knee-weakening grin.</p><p>\u201cYes. I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou seem so confident that my mixed up head is going to decide that you\u2019re the one for me.\u201d I state this calmly as if this conversation wasn\u2019t insanely ridiculous. I\u2019m sitting here with a gorgeous American cowboy discussing the fact that I don\u2019t know if I like him. Is this even happening? Ohmygosh.</p><p>\u201cOh, your mixed up head will definitely decide that,\u201d Quinn answers with a grin. Then he winks. \u201cBecause it\u2019s the right choice.\u201d</p><p>Then he grabs my hand, completely ignoring the fact that I\u2019ve been wiping my nose with it. He pulls me to my feet.</p><p>\u201cWill you dance with me?\u201d</p><p>I look at him uncertainly.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t really want to go back inside. I\u2019m a mess. And I don\u2019t want to see Gavin right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine,\u201d Quinn assures me. \u201cI meant right here. We can hear the music from here. And it\u2019s sexier to dance under the stars, anyway.\u201d</p><p>Quinn McKeyen can\u2019t get any sexier. I decide that in this instant. He pulls me to his tuxedoed chest and I rest my cheek against his satin lapel. His strong arms close around me and we sway together in the light of the moon.</p><p>My heart pounds.</p><p>He is so, so sexy.</p><p>And patient.</p><p>And strong.</p><p>And amazing.</p><p>I sigh.</p><p>He\u2019s got quite a long list of good traits.</p><p>I melt into him and let him hold me. And we dance, swaying together under the twinkling stars. We dance through the next several songs. Then we sit and chat by the pool. And then we dance some more.</p><p>And honestly, by the end of the evening, even in spite of the whole crumbling-into-a-sobbing-heap thing, I can say it\u2019s been the best benefit event I ever remember attending at the Old Palace.</p><p>I know that doesn\u2019t say a lot considering that my memory has holes in it.</p><p>But still.</p><p>I wake up to a knock on my bedroom door.</p><p>I growl and cover my head with my pillow. After not getting home until 2:00a.m, there is no way that I\u2019m getting out of bed at 8:00.</p><p>Not.</p><p>Gonna.</p><p>Happen.</p><p>I bury my head deep under my pillows and squeeze my eyes shut.</p><p>But whoever it is won\u2019t give up. They knock again and again.</p><p>And then finally, they get tired of knocking.</p><p>My door opens.</p><p>And Quinn is standing there. He looks breathtakingly sexy and fills up my entire doorframe. He\u2019s wearing old jeans that fit him exactly right, his cowboy boots and a blue faded button up shirt. The shirt looks soft and worn and it hugs his chest.</p><p>I peer out from under my pillows to get a better look.</p><p>He grins at me.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you so early???\u201d I groan, flipping onto my back and staring at him. \u201cAnd so cheerful already? Plus, you\u2019re dressed and everything. Ugh.\u201d</p><p>He raises an eyebrow as he approaches the bed. I only just now notice that he\u2019s carrying two cups.</p><p>\u201cWould you prefer that I wasn\u2019t dressed?\u201d he asks innocently. He holds out a cup. \u201cI come bearing gifts. Coffee with one shot of espresso plus enough cream and sugar to make cake batter.\u201d</p><p>I stare at him now as I sit up.</p><p>\u201cHow did you know how I like my coffee? Stalk much?\u201d</p><p>Quinn laughs and I decide that I might want to marry his laugh. It\u2019s just that sexy.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t stalk you, tiny tot. I don\u2019t have to. I know you\u2019ll come to me someday. I asked Marietta how you take your coffee. And then she made it. So if it sucks, don\u2019t blame me.\u201d</p><p>I smile and roll my eyes.</p><p>Marietta might have made it, but Quinn brought it to me. And that\u2019s pretty dang sweet. But I don\u2019t say that.</p><p>Instead, I take a sip of the nectar of the gods and stare at him over the cup.</p><p>\u201cSo, what\u2019s the occasion? Why have you come bearing gifts?\u201d</p><p>Quinn perches himself on the edge of my bed. And no, the fact doesn\u2019t escape me that now Quinn is technically in my bed. With me. And I\u2019m half naked.</p><p>My heart flutters again.</p><p>Down girl, I silently tell it. Then I return my attention to Quinn, waiting for an answer.</p><p>\u201cI want to continue with your riding lessons. And I figured you\u2019d need some coffee to wake up.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m already shaking my head.</p><p>\u201cOh, no. I don\u2019t get up this early. The old me didn\u2019t and the new me doesn\u2019t either. And neither one of us is getting up this early to go riding on a gigantic demon. Nope. Not gonna happen.\u201d</p><p>I am up and dressed five minutes later.</p><p>Hey, don\u2019t judge.</p><p>Quinn can be pretty compelling while sitting on the side of my bed smiling at me.</p><p>Okay, fine.</p><p>I\u2019m weak. Weak, weak, weak. Quinn\u2019s cocky grin does that to me.</p><p>But I admit it, so that\u2019s something, right?</p><p>Right before I duck out the door to meet Quinn outdoors, I text Gavin.</p><p>I\u2019m really sorry about last night. I hope you can forgive me. I hate that you\u2019re upset.</p><p>There\u2019s no immediate answer. And I leave my phone in my room.</p><p>Quinn is already waiting for me outside. And now he\u2019s wearing his cowboy hat which only makes him even sexier.</p><p>\u201cHey tiny tot,\u201d he greets me. \u201cI have something for you.\u201d</p><p>And he hands me a pale pink cowboy hat.</p><p>No. Lie.</p><p>I laugh as I take it and shove it onto my head.</p><p>\u201cWhere in Caberra did you find a cowboy hat?\u201d</p><p>He grins. \u201cThere\u2019s a woman in town who makes straw hats. I showed her mine and asked her to make a smaller one for you. In pink. She did a good job.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I feel sassy now in my pink hat. I find myself wishing that I had a pair of shorts and boots on like Reece always wears.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I tell him. \u201cI love it. I feel so American now.\u201d</p><p>He chuckles. \u201cWell, surely you know that all Americans aren\u2019t cowboys. In fact, most Americans aren\u2019t even cowboys. Just some of us. The awesome ones.\u201d</p><p>I smile up at him. \u201cOkay, Awesome One, tell me more about America.\u201d</p> <p>So, as he saddles up Titan, he does. I stay a safe distance away from Titan\u2019s enormous stamping foot, but still close enough to listen. And obviously, close enough to watch Quinn\u2019s muscles flex as he lifts the saddle.</p><p>Because that\u2019s important.</p><p>\u201cWe like good barbeque, football and Sunday naps. We like pep rallies and college ball teams and ice cream. And French fries. We like animals and some girls even carry little dogs around in purses. But I could never see you doing that. We like working hard to be the best we can be. We love Disney World, no matter how old we are. And we love riding in Jeeps with the tops down. We love target shooting. We love firecrackers and the Fourth of July. We love going to the lake on a summer day, especially in a speed boat.\u201d</p><p>He looks at me as he adjusts Titan\u2019s bridle. \u201cIs that enough or do you want to know more?\u201d</p><p>I smile at him.</p> <p>\u201cEvery American likes those things or just you? Because I honestly don\u2019t see Reece target shooting.\u201d</p><p>Quinn smirks. \u201cWell, most Americans probably love those things. I certainly do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never been to America,\u201d I tell him. \u201cSo, I have no way of knowing if you\u2019re exaggerating. I\u2019d planned on coming to visit Reece at some point, but now she\u2019s here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d he tells me. \u201cYou\u2019ll just have to come visit me instead. I mean, you need to know if I\u2019m telling you the truth, right?\u201d</p><p>And he literally stops what he is doing and stares into my eyes. His are warm and brown and chocolately. And I feel flustered for a second. Lost. And then he smiles.</p><p>\u201cDeal?\u201d</p> <p>I swallow and nod.</p><p>\u201cDeal.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s satisfied with that. And he boosts me onto Titan. And I forget for a second that I am terrified because Quinn is swinging up behind me. I twist around to look at him.</p><p>\u201cTandem horseback riding?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you could use a break today from things that stress you. So we\u2019re going to have a relaxing ride today. You just sit back and let me do the work.\u201d</p><p>So I do.</p><p>I settle back against him, enjoying the way his chest is hard and strong. I seem to melt into it and we fit just right. His arms curve around me and I am encompassed there. And I really like being here in this spot. He makes me feel safe and sound and warm. I love the way his chest feels as he talks, and I love the way his voice is smooth, yet husky.</p><p>And then I am faced with a big realization.</p> <p>I love quite a few things about him.</p><p>It\u2019s a bit scary.</p><p>But then I\u2019m distracted by the stubble on his chin as he dips his head to talk to me. So I grin up at him and before I even know what I\u2019m doing, I\u2019m twisting around to kiss him.</p><p>I am as surprised by this as he is, but he recovers first.</p><p>He wraps an arm around me, pulling me close. His tongue delves into my mouth, his breath hot. When he finally pulls away, I feel like panting again.</p><p>There should be a law against being as sexy as Quinn McKeyen.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that for?\u201d he asks softly. His chocolate brown eyes are glued to mine.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I tell him honestly. \u201cI just wanted to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s as good a reason as any,\u201d he answers. \u201cMaybe your heart is starting to give you answers.\u201d</p><p>And maybe he\u2019s right. But I don\u2019t say that.</p><p>Instead, I lean against him again. And I enjoy the ride. Titan walks smoothly, his large muscles contracting beneath us. The sun feels so good on my face that I almost fall asleep. I\u2019m still tired from my late night. We ride through the entire property, weaving amongst the olive trees and down by a natural creek that runs on the property. We take a few minutes there to stretch and let Titan drink. Then we ride more.</p><p>Finally, several hours later, Quinn guides Titan back toward the house and I close my eyes, basking in the sun like a contented cat. I am seriously almost asleep when Titan stops.</p><p>I open my eyes. And I get the surprise of my life. And not a good surprise, either.</p><p>Gavin is here.</p><p>He\u2019s standing next to the corral, apparently waiting for me, and he isn\u2019t happy to see me riding with Quinn.</p><p>Efffff.</p><p>Chapter Twenty</p><p>\u201cHi Gavin,\u201d I call out.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t answer.</p><p>Effffffff.</p><p>\u201cWill you be alright?\u201d Quinn asks me quietly.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d I tell him. \u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d He nods and helps me down from Titan, then heads to the stable.</p><p>I walk straight to Gavin. And Gavin is not happy.</p><p>At all.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing, Mia?\u201d he asks. And there are thunderclouds on his face. I\u2019ve never seen him look quite so mad. Actually, I don\u2019t know that I\u2019ve ever seen Gavin mad at all. I gulp.</p><p>\u201cI went for a ride.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I see that. With Quinn. Literally, with Quinn. You were basically on his lap.\u201d</p><p>Is he jealous? Holy cow.</p><p>\u201cWell, to be fair, there\u2019s only one horse and I don\u2019t really know how to ride yet. So, Quinn was kind enough to take me for a ride.\u201d</p><p>Gavin scoffs. \u201cOh yeah. He\u2019s being kind. There\u2019s nothing in it for him.\u201d</p><p>And now he\u2019s being facetious. And definitely jealous. That\u2019s not like him.</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t answering your phone,\u201d he points out.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because it\u2019s in the house,\u201d I tell him. \u201cI texted you this morning and you ignored me. So I just left it inside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cConvenient,\u201d Gavin says wryly.</p><p>\u201cWhat is wrong with you?\u201d I demand. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t even talk to me last night. And here you are pissed off that I went for a ride with Quinn.\u201d</p><p>As I speak, I glance toward the stables to see if Quinn has emerged, but he hasn\u2019t. He must still be taking care of Titan. I decide that\u2019s best, considering how agitated Gavin is.</p><p>\u201cWhat is wrong with me is that ever since your accident and I saw that things could change between us, in a good way, I\u2019ve felt better than I have in a long time,\u201d Gavin tells me. \u201cYou and I together is a very good thing. We know each other. We would fit so easily into each other\u2019s lives. And all of a sudden, you\u2019re too nervous to try and pursue it. And you\u2019ve never been nervous a day in your life. I don\u2019t understand it. And now you\u2019ve taken up with Quinn. And I can\u2019t figure you out.\u201d</p><p>I stare at him.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to be with me?\u201d I ask. \u201cOr do you want to be with the idea of me... because we would \u2018fit so easily into each other lives?\u201d</p><p>Gavin rolls his eyes. \u201cDon\u2019t twist my words, Mi,\u201d he tells me. \u201cYou know what I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you mean,\u201d I answer. \u201cAnd I haven\u2019t \u2018taken up with Quinn\u2019. I went for a ride with him. We didn\u2019t run away and get married.\u201d</p><p>Gavin is angry now. His tan cheeks are flushed. I can see that he\u2019s trying to rein it in and I don\u2019t understand it. I don\u2019t know where his anger is coming from.</p><p>\u201cMia, I\u2019m worried about you. And your decisions. Quinn isn\u2019t like us. He\u2019s not from here. And I like him, I do. So it\u2019s not that. But you don\u2019t realize right now, because you\u2019re not yourself... but you can\u2019t just got trotting off with someone you barely know. Not in your position. I hate to say this, but you don\u2019t have the best track record with guys. You thought you knew Vincent Dranias too, but look how that turned out. Dimitri, Dante and Elena could have all been killed.\u201d</p><p>I suck in a breath and Gavin goes still.</p><p>And I go still. And my blood turns cold.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Mia,\u201d Gavin says quickly. \u201cI crossed the line. I didn\u2019t mean it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you did,\u201d I answer slowly. \u201cYou did mean it. You don\u2019t think I can think for myself. And you think that the assassination attempt was my fault.\u201d</p><p>He looks pained now.</p><p>As he should.</p><p>I jut my chin out.</p><p>\u201cMia, that\u2019s not what I meant. That wasn\u2019t your fault at all. It was Nate\u2019s fault. And if you hadn\u2019t fallen for Vincent, they would have just found another way into our circle. I just meant that you aren\u2019t yourself. Now isn\u2019t a good time for you to make rash decisions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I haven\u2019t made any decisions,\u201d I point out. \u201cNone. And I think that\u2019s really why you are mad. You thought I would just fall into your arms and that would be that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that would certainly have made things easier,\u201d he says wryly. \u201cBut you\u2019re far too stubborn for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not,\u201d I insist.</p><p>\u201cYes, you are,\u201d he nods. But at least he\u2019s smiling now.</p><p>And then suddenly....something about his smile, or the light hitting his face, or the way he\u2019s looking at me, or something that I can\u2019t put my finger on... something triggers my messed up mind.</p><p>There is a weird sort of flicker in my thoughts, like a blur.</p><p>Everything sort of swirls together in a huge chaotic mess of colors and lights and words.</p><p>And then everything comes crashing down.</p><p>I remember everything.</p><p>Everything.</p><p>I remember diving with Gavin, I remember being friends with him since preschool. I remember meeting Reece for the first time. I remember lashing out at my parents. I remember all of the black gothic clothing I wore. I remember my car. I remember countless charity events at the Old Palace. I remember going to school.</p><p>I remember everything.</p><p>\u201cI remember,\u201d I murmur.</p><p>And I sink to my knees because the suddenness of it, the enormity of it, is overwhelming. I actually feel nauseas.</p><p>\u201cYou remember?\u201d Gavin asks and he is concerned now as he bends next to me. \u201cHow? Are you alright?\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t know. I feel like throwing up. And I don\u2019t know why.</p><p>I rock back and forth on my heels as I focus on my thoughts, on all of the faces in my thoughts. Of Elena- and how she is the world\u2019s biggest bitch and how could I forget that? I remember Reecie and Dante and Nate and Vincent.</p><p>Oh My God. Vincent. I remember Vincent. And Gavin is right. I used very poor judgment with Vince. But how in the world could I have known better? He was hiding who he was from me. That wasn\u2019t my fault.</p><p>And I remember Gavin.</p><p>I stare at him now. At his handsome face and his white smile. But now, all of a sudden, I don\u2019t see him as a heart-stoppingly sexy guy. I see him as my good friend. That is immediate and apparent. He is and always will be my friend. It\u2019s like my heart turned a complete one-eighty. I can\u2019t help how I feel. And just like I was afraid of, my memories have changed everything.</p><p>Gavin stares back.</p><p>\u201cDo you remember me?\u201d he asks quietly.</p><p>I nod.</p><p>And his expression falls.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Quinn yells from the stable door. \u201cMia! Are you okay?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My head snaps up and my eyes meet his.</p><p>And he rushes toward me.</p><p>But Gavin stands up and all of a sudden, his frustration with the situation has a target. A target who doesn\u2019t deserve it, but is a target nonetheless.</p><p>Quinn.</p> <p>Gavin rushes at him with an aggression that I\u2019ve never seen in him. Quinn startles as he realizes what is going on and then he does the only thing he can do.</p><p>He defends himself. He braces himself for impact.</p><p>Gavin plows into him and slams him to the ground.</p><p>Quinn\u2019s head whips back and I hear it crash into the ground with a sickening thud. My stomach clenches at the sound. He hits hard. And then Gavin punches him. Hard. I can hear his knuckles smash into Quinn\u2019s cheek.</p><p>And then Quinn roars like a lion.</p> <p>He throws Gavin off, and Gavin tries to come back for more. Quinn is able to hold him at bay.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to do that,\u201d Quinn says. I think he\u2019s pretty calm, considering the situation. His lip is split and it is bleeding. And I know he\u2019s holding back. He\u2019s not thrashing Gavin the way he could.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know what I want,\u201d Gavin snaps.</p><p>\u201cOh, I do know,\u201d Quinn says. \u201cAnd I\u2019m sorry that you can\u2019t have her.\u201d</p><p>And then Gavin punches at him again. But this time, Quinn catches his fist in his large hand and squeezes, forcing Gavin away. But Gavin won\u2019t give up. He brings his knee up and slams it into Quinn\u2019s gut. I hear the air whoosh out.</p><p>And suddenly, Quinn has had enough.</p> <p>He punches Gavin. Hard. In the face.</p><p>Gavin flies backward into the dirt. And he lays there, still.</p><p>I find my wits now and rush to him.</p><p>\u201cAre you alright?\u201d I shake his shoulder. He\u2019s dazed, but he opens his eyes. \u201cGavin, are you okay?\u201d</p><p>I am panicked now. Blood seems to be everywhere. His hand is bleeding, his nose. I twist around and see that Quinn\u2019s face is streaming blood, too.</p><p>This can\u2019t be happening.</p><p>OhMyGod.</p><p>\u201cGavin?\u201d I say, and my voice is shaky. \u201cCan you hear me?\u201d</p> <p>He actually smiles for a second, but then he turns serious.</p><p>\u201cOf course I can hear you. I\u2019m not deaf.\u201d</p><p>He pushes me off of him and he gets to his feet.</p><p>He stares down at me.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t the right decision, Mia,\u201d he tells me. And then he walks away before I can even answer.</p><p>Quinn takes a step and offers me his hand.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d he asks me. And I have to laugh at that. He\u2019s got blood streaming everywhere and he\u2019s asking me if I\u2019m okay.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I tell him. \u201cHow about you?\u201d</p><p>He touches his cheek gingerly and I see that his hand is swollen already. I start to grab it, but restrain myself. I don\u2019t want to cause him more pain.</p><p>\u201cOh my god, I think your hand might be broken,\u201d I tell him worriedly. He nods.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure it is. Don\u2019t worry about it. It won\u2019t be the first time.\u201d</p><p>I stare at him.</p><p>\u201cDo you get in fights often?\u201d</p><p>He grins his crooked grin.</p><p>\u201cDid I forget to mention that\u2019s one of the things Americans like to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou like to get into fights?\u201d I\u2019m incredulous. He smiles, then shakes his head.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m kidding. But I do live in a small rural town. There\u2019s not much to do, so the majority of us have gotten into a fight or two. What I really meant was that I\u2019ve broken a few bones playing football. It\u2019s okay. I\u2019ll heal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need ice,\u201d I tell him as I grab his arm and spin him toward the house. I\u2019m not sure how I know this, but it seems logical.</p><p>He stops.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d he asks me quietly. \u201cI heard you. Your memories are back. Do you need to go see a doctor, or...\u201d</p><p>I stare at him in utter disbelief. He\u2019s dripping blood and he\u2019s worried that I\u2019m the one who needs a doctor? I mention the ridiculousness of this to him and he smiles.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I don\u2019t have any experience with this whole amnesia thing. It just makes sense that you would need to see your doctor.\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cMaybe I do, but not as much as you do right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d he insists. And as he does, he wipes the blood from his lip. I shake my head.</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t fine,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>He ignores that. \u201cWhat was that even about?\u201d he asks. \u201cWhat set Gavin off like that?\u201d</p><p>I pause. I don\u2019t have a great answer.</p><p>\u201cI... um. I think that Gavin has tried a very long time to be everything that everyone needs\u2014the perfect son, the perfect friend. He tries very hard to be laid back and easy going. And when I lost my memory, I think he saw an opportunity to be part of a relationship with someone who understands what it is like to be with someone like him--- we have the same social pressures. But tonight, he knew that wasn\u2019t going to happen. And I think that everything just sort of exploded for him. All of his pent up frustrations and whatnot. It didn\u2019t have anything to do with you. Don\u2019t take it personally, although I know that\u2019s hard.\u201d</p><p>Quinn nods, but before he can say anything, I hear voices.</p><p>I turn to find Dante and Reece running toward us.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Reece breathes as she skids to a stop next to us. \u201cOh my gosh, Quinn! What the hell? We saw Gavin leave and he was bloody. And you\u2019re bloody....\u201d She trails off and stares. \u201cHoly monkeys. You got into a fight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you alright?\u201d Dante asks quietly. He\u2019s glancing over Quinn, at his split lip and swollen hand. I see now that Quinn\u2019s eye is a bit swollen too. I gulp.</p><p>Quinn nods. \u201cI\u2019m fine, guys. I\u2019ve had worse than this after a game. Trust me.\u201d</p><p>Reece narrows her eyes. \u201cWhat were you fighting about?\u201d And then she looks at me. I exhale shakily. I\u2019m still feeling nauseas.</p><p>\u201cI remember everything,\u201d I tell her. \u201cGavin was upset because I was riding Titan with Quinn and for some reason, something triggered my memories and they all came back. And now I think I\u2019m going to throw up.\u201d</p><p>And I do. I barely have time to turn away before I am dropping to my knees and puking my guts up.</p><p>I hear movement behind me and Reece holding my hair back. She pats my back. But it\u2019s Quinn\u2019s voice that murmurs to me that it\u2019s going to be okay.</p><p>I glance back and find that it is Quinn comforting me. Reece is standing a short distance away, looking for all the world like she wants to shove him out of the way and kneel next to me, but she doesn\u2019t. She lets Quinn do it.</p><p>Another wave of nausea floods through me and I throw up again. And then I\u2019m okay. I sit still for a second, then I wipe my mouth and turn around.</p><p>I try to stand up, but my knees are weak. I feel shaky.</p><p>And I grab onto Quinn\u2019s strong arm.</p><p>Instead of helping me up, he just scoops me into his arms.</p><p>He carries me the entire way to the house, up the stairs, down the hall and into my bedroom. My mother\u2019s face is shocked as we pass her in the foyer, and she follows behind with Reece and Dante.</p><p>Quinn sets me on the bed.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to be fine,\u201d he tells me. And I\u2019m not sure if he is comforting me or giving me a directive. But I nod. Either way, he\u2019s right.</p><p>I\u2019ll be fine.</p><p>I know that now.</p><p>Chapter Twenty One</p><p>Reece sits with me for the entire first twenty-four hours. My mother takes the doctor\u2019s order to rest to heart and refuses to let me leave my bed, so my friends come to me. Dante comes to play chess. Quinn comes to chat and bring me coffee. Reece is always here. We look at fashion magazines, do our nails and she flat-irons my hair.</p><p>Gavin doesn\u2019t come.</p><p>I try not to let this hurt. Reece texted him and told him that I\u2019m alright, that my memories have all returned. She relayed what the doctor told us... that my brain has now made a full recovery. She joked with him that I\u2019m still not right in the head, but I\u2019m as right as I ever was.</p><p>He replied that he\u2019s glad I\u2019m okay.</p><p>That was it.</p><p>And that really hurts.</p><p>But I have to try and look at it from his point of view. And when I do that, I feel really sad. Because he was right. It would have been very convenient if we\u2019d have gotten together. And I think his feelings really did change toward me after the accident. I think that New Mia was exciting for him. It was like meeting someone new, yet someone who was familiar and safe. Just like I felt about him.</p><p>Felt.</p><p>Past tense.</p><p>Because those fluttery feelings that I had for both Quinn and Gavin are gone. And they are solely focused on Quinn alone now. Of that, I am certain.</p><p>Everything Quinn does sends my heart into a tail spin. My hormones burst into flame whenever he is near. My heart has clearly decided. But I haven\u2019t told Quinn yet. I\u2019m trying not to be impetuous. New Mia has turned over a new leaf.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Reece says as she hands me a hot pink shirt. \u201cNew Mia is sticking around?\u201d</p><p>She is trying to hide her surprise, I can tell. She was amazed when I told her that I don\u2019t need to go shopping to replace my new wardrobe with another new wardrobe consisting solely of black.</p><p>I nod. \u201cNew Mia is here to stay, with bits of Old Mia thrown in. Old Mia was trying too hard to prove a few points and all she did was piss people off. New Mia has had some revelations.\u201d</p><p>Reece raises a blonde eyebrow. \u201cLike?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike it\u2019s okay to be agreeable. It\u2019s okay to do things that you don\u2019t really want to do\u2014if those things are helping out people you love. I have to understand that my dad\u2019s job is important and that people watch me. Gavin was right about that\u2014I need to suck it up and do my part. But that doesn\u2019t mean that I can\u2019t do it in my own way. I won\u2019t put my nose-ring back in, but I\u2019m leaving my hair. It\u2019s not hurting anything. I\u2019m compromising on the clothes. I don\u2019t feel the need to wear black, but I\u2019m not wearing beige. Ugh.\u201d</p><p>Reece smiles. \u201cHot pink is a compromise? And fingerless gloves?\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cYes. I believe those are fair compromises.\u201d</p><p>Reece laughs. \u201cI like New Mia. She\u2019s still pretty kick-ass, too.\u201d But then she gets serious. \u201cWhat about Quinn?\u201d</p><p>I stare at her. \u201cI like him,\u201d I tell her quietly. \u201cI really like him.\u201d</p><p>She nods. \u201cI know. I can tell. And he likes you too. So what are you going to do about it?\u201d</p><p>I smile. \u201cWell, there\u2019s one thing that New Mia and Old Mia have in common.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what\u2019s that?\u201d Reece asks.</p><p>\u201cWe both work hard to get what we want.\u201d</p><p>Reece laughs at that and I laugh with her.</p><p>\u201cAm I going to have to listen to you refer to yourself in the third person now for all of eternity?\u201d she asks with a grin.</p><p>\u201cPossibly,\u201d I tell her. \u201cI sort of like it. It makes me feel like the Queen of England.\u201d</p><p>Reece rolls her eyes and hands me a pair of jeans.</p><p>\u201cWell, come on, your highness. Get dressed.\u201d</p><p>I pull my pants on and we wind our way down the stairs and into the kitchen. I am surprised to find my mother there, along with Dante. She\u2019s as casual as can be about eating in the kitchen. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>What the hell?</p><p>\u201cMom?\u201d I look at her in surprise. She\u2019s sitting with Dante, nibbling at a croissant and sipping a cup of coffee.</p><p>She smiles at me and she honestly looks happy.</p><p>My mother.</p> <p>Happy.</p><p>It\u2019s a crazy concept, I know.</p><p>But it seems to be true.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t look so surprised,\u201d she tells me. \u201cI\u2019m not too old to change, you know. I thought about it a lot last night when I was supposed to be sleeping. You might have been right all along. I was too rigid and set in my ways. Some might even say that I was being a witch.\u201d She pauses here, presumably waiting to have someone refute that. No one does. She sighs. \u201cI\u2019m probably partially to blame for you rebelling so hard. So, I\u2019ve decided to take a page from your playbook and reassess my life. Changes will be made.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m stunned.</p> <p>This is amazing.</p><p>I gulp, then nod.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I tell her. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to say,\u201d she tells me. \u201cEverything will be alright, Mia.\u201d</p><p>And once again, I believe that to be true. Everything really will be okay.</p><p>\u201cHave you seen Quinn?\u201d I ask. My mother nods.</p> <p>\u201cHe was here for breakfast. I think he went outside.\u201d</p><p>I chat for a moment longer before I go outside to find him. Reece stays inside to talk with my mom and wait for Dante.</p><p>It doesn\u2019t take me long to find Quinn. I just head down to the stables and there he is. He is truly in his element with that horse. That is for sure. I walk up to the fence and call out a good morning. He turns and I inhale sharply. It looks like a truck has hit his face.</p><p>\u201cHoly cow,\u201d I breathe. \u201cYour face.\u201d</p><p>He smiles. \u201cGee, thanks,\u201d he says. \u201cJust the kind of reaction I was looking for.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s joking and I smile.</p><p>\u201cDoes it hurt?\u201d I ask hesitantly. He rolls the eye that isn\u2019t swollen.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t feel wonderful. But I\u2019m okay,\u201d he assures me.</p> <p>I gaze at him, at his handsome, sexy face that is now swollen and distorted. He smiles. Or I think he does. With his cheek swollen like that, it\u2019s hard to tell. And then he rolls his eye. The un-swollen one.</p><p>\u201cWay to make me feel unselfconscious, tiny tot,\u201d he tells me wryly.</p><p>I wince. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. It just looks painful. I\u2019m so sorry that this happened to you. It\u2019s my fault. That\u2019s what I was coming to say to you. To apologize, I mean.\u201d</p><p>He stares at me like I\u2019ve suddenly grown two heads.</p><p>\u201cThe last I knew, Gavin was the one who attacked me,\u201d he tells me. \u201cNot you. So don\u2019t feel guilty at all, Mia. It\u2019s not your fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I hadn\u2019t been so confused, Gavin wouldn\u2019t have felt led on and this entire thing wouldn\u2019t have happened,\u201d I tell him sadly. \u201cIt is my fault.\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head. \u201cWell, we\u2019ll have to agree to disagree. But on the off chance that you\u2019re right and this is your fault, there\u2019s something you can do to make it up to me.\u201d</p><p>He pauses here and grins. Or I think he does. It\u2019s hard to say at this point with all that swelling. I choose to believe it is a grin and so I grin back.</p><p>\u201cAnd what would that be?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cYou can finally teach me to swim,\u201d he answers. \u201cIf I\u2019m here in Caberra, surrounded by the sea, I think it\u2019s something I should know, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>I smile and start to nod.</p><p>Unfortunately, I don\u2019t have time to agree because a car rolls to a stop next to the stable. A police car from Valese. I\u2019m startled as two officers climb out and head over to us. My heart pounds, although I don\u2019t know why. We haven\u2019t done anything wrong.</p><p>\u201cQuinn McKeyen?\u201d one calls out in English.</p><p>Quinn nods. \u201cYes, that\u2019s me.\u201d He\u2019s unconcerned because he knows that he hasn\u2019t broken the law.</p><p>The officer pulls out a pair of handcuffs. \u201cYou\u2019re under arrest for the assault of Gavin Ariastasis. Son, you picked the wrong boy to pick a fight with. Don\u2019t you know who his father is?\u201d</p><p>The officer snaps on the cuffs and I am dismayed and astounded. So much so that I hear a roaring in my ears. I\u2019m so flabbergasted that it takes a minute for me to come to my senses and say anything.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you know whose property this is?\u201d I demand as I chase after them. \u201cThis is Dimitri Giliberti\u2019s property, as I\u2019m sure you know. I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll like finding out that you\u2019ve just arrested his house guest.\u201d</p><p>The officer levels a gaze at me.</p><p>\u201cMiss, there\u2019s one thing about our prime minister. He\u2019s always fair. If his own son broke the law, he wouldn\u2019t step in to pull any strings. He believes that the law is the same for everyone.\u201d</p><p>I gulp because I know he\u2019s right. Dimitri is known for that.</p><p>\u201cBut Quinn was only protecting himself,\u201d I attempt. \u201cI was there. I saw it. It was self-defense. Gavin started it. And I can\u2019t believe Gavin would press charges.\u201d</p><p>The other officer interrupts. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t Gavin who came down to the police station today. It was his father. You\u2019ll have to take it up with him.\u201d</p><p>Eff.</p><p>Gavin\u2019s father does have a temper. No one likes to cross him. In fact, it\u2019s probably one of the reasons why Gavin has always chosen to be so laid back. He wants to be the opposite of his high-strung father.</p><p>Eff again.</p><p>\u201cQuinn, don\u2019t worry,\u201d I call to him as they put him in the car. \u201cI\u2019m going to get Dante. And my dad, too.\u201d</p><p>Then it occurs to me. My dad is every bit as important as Gavin\u2019s. So I call out to the officers.</p><p>\u201cDo you know who my dad is? I\u2019ll have him down at the station before you can even blink. Maybe he\u2019ll even meet you there.\u201d</p><p>Quinn is shaking his head but I can\u2019t hear what he is saying because the door is closed now. I\u2019m guessing he\u2019s telling me not to drag my father into it. But holy hell. This entire mess is my fault and I\u2019ve never asked my dad for any favors. I think it\u2019s about time to start.</p><p>I am watching limply as the police car rolls back out when Reece comes to find me.</p><p>\u201cIs that what I think it was?\u201d she asks curiously.</p><p>I nod miserably. \u201cYes. And Quinn\u2019s in the backseat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She is as appalled as me. I tug at her hand.</p><p>\u201cCome on. We have work to do.\u201d</p><p>To my mother\u2019s credit, she drops what she is doing to drive me to see my father. I explain the entire situation to her on the way and she actually seems sympathetic. I have no idea what has come over her, but I hope it never goes away.</p><p>And while I am going to see my father, Dante is going to see his. We both tried to call Gavin, but he\u2019s not picking up his phone. I can\u2019t imagine what is going through his head, other than he probably doesn\u2019t want to go against his father.</p><p>But still.</p><p>If ever there was a time for him take a stand, now is the time.</p><p>My father is surprised when my mom and I burst into his large office in the Old Palace. He is even more surprised after I tell him why.</p><p>\u201cQuinn? The nice boy who is Dimitri\u2019s exchange student?\u201d he asks. I nod.</p><p>\u201cYes. And he is a nice boy. What happened wasn\u2019t his fault. And I\u2019m afraid that if these charges go through, he\u2019ll have to go back to America. And that\u2019s not fair.\u201d</p><p>My father studies me. \u201cAnd you don\u2019t want him to leave.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s an observation, not a question. I flush, but I don\u2019t deny it.</p><p>\u201cNo, sir. I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>I even call him sir.</p><p>He thinks about this and stares out this window. I\u2019ve never asked him for any kind of favor before. I\u2019ve never, ever played on his status or importance. Not even one time. And I think he realizes that because he finally sighs.</p><p>\u201cOkay, Mia. I\u2019ll talk to Dimitri. But I\u2019ll also speak with Gavin\u2019s father. Surely, if it is as you are saying and Gavin started it, he will see reason.\u201d</p><p>But even my father doesn\u2019t sound hopeful about that one. Gavin\u2019s father isn\u2019t known for his reason.</p><p>\u201cThe best thing you can do is go wait at the police station. I\u2019m sure he will be released on bail today because this is his first offense, correct?\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cI think so. I\u2019m sure it is.\u201d</p><p>My father nods. \u201cGood. Go wait at the police station. Your mother can bail him out.\u201d</p><p>My mother looks a bit surprised by daddy\u2019s willingness to help, but she seems satisfied with it. I\u2019m overwhelmed by my parents\u2019 behavior today and I rush at my dad and hug him.</p><p>\u201cThank you, daddy,\u201d I whisper. \u201cThank you so much.\u201d</p><p>I feel a tear coming out of my eye and I wipe it away. My father stares at me in surprise. I don\u2019t usually cry in front of him. Or hug him. Or show him any emotion at all other than anger.</p><p>I smile.</p><p>\u201cI really appreciate this, daddy.\u201d</p><p>I leave with my mom and she drives me to the police station, a place that neither of us have ever been. I can\u2019t even believe that my mother, the woman who just recently wouldn\u2019t bring herself to eat in a kitchen, is now going to walk into a police station to post bail. It\u2019s incredible. And a little funny.</p><p>I can\u2019t help but laugh about it, and so when my mom asks what I\u2019m laughing about, I tell her and she laughs too.</p><p>\u201cMia, I know that I\u2019ve been a stuck up snob. It\u2019s easy to get sucked into that kind of thing. And I\u2019ll probably always be a bit of a one. You can\u2019t completely change a person. But I\u2019ll try to be a nicer snob. How about that?\u201d</p><p>I feel like crying again.</p><p>But I don\u2019t.</p><p>Instead, I smile and nod and my mother and I square our shoulders and disappear into the Community Police Station of Valese.</p><p>There\u2019s someone I have to save.</p><p>Chapter Twenty Two</p><p>\u201cI told you,\u201d Quinn tells me yet again. \u201cI\u2019m fine, Mia. Don\u2019t stress about this. It\u2019s going to be fine.\u201d</p><p>The person who I saved turned out to be quite calm when we rescued him.</p><p>When he came walking out of the back hall of the police department, I thought my knees were going to give out. His eyes met mine and I knew that I would do anything I possibly could to keep him out of trouble and in Caberra.</p><p>With me.</p><p>It was an intense moment.</p><p>And now we\u2019re standing in the Great Room at Giliberti House. Well, scratch that. We\u2019re not standing. I\u2019m pacing around like a mad woman, while Dante, Reece, Quinn and my mother are all sitting. Calmly. Like rational adults.</p><p>I\u2019m the only one acting like a lunatic.</p><p>I recently had a head injury, though, so I have an excuse.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not fine,\u201d I tell him. Then I grit my teeth. I\u2019ve been gritting my teeth so much that I\u2019m giving myself a headache. \u201cWe had to bail you out of jail. If we don\u2019t get this straightened out, they\u2019ll send you home\u2014for something that wasn\u2019t even your fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMia,\u201d my mom interjects. \u201cThere is no use pacing around here and worrying. We have attorneys looking at this and your father is attempting to speak with Stefan Ariastasis. Perhaps he will see reason and this will just fade away.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cFat chance,\u201d I mutter. \u201cGavin\u2019s dad isn\u2019t reasonable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, perhaps he will be this time,\u201d my mother insists. \u201cI want you to go outside and take a walk. You should get some fresh air. You need a distraction.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of distractions,\u201d Dante interjects. \u201cMy father is christening our new yacht today. It\u2019s sort of sentimental, actually, since we\u2019re replacing the boat we could have been killed on with a new one. Plus, our old yacht was named after my mother. And our new one is named for Reece.\u201d</p><p>This surprises me, because I didn\u2019t know anything about this. But then, I\u2019ve been wrapped up in my own problems lately. Suddenly, I feel like a terrible friend.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know any of this, D,\u201d I tell him. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. What are you naming it?\u201d</p><p>Dante grins, a brilliantly white smile that is full of pure adoration as he stares at Reece.</p><p>\u201cThe Sunflower.\u201d</p><p>I have to smile. Kansas, Reece\u2019s native state in America, is apparently filled with sunflowers. It\u2019s why Dante is always calling her his sunflower. And I get a huge lump in my throat because this is the sweetest thing on the planet.</p><p>\u201cThat is so sweet,\u201d I tell him. I don\u2019t know why my eyes feel like tearing up. I\u2019ve been so emotional lately. So again, I blame it on my injury. That injury comes in sort of handy.</p> <p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it?\u201d Reece asks happily. \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe it when he told me.\u201d</p><p>I can believe it. Dante adores her. And I\u2019m suddenly once again envious of their relationship. I feel ashamed of that envy though. If anyone deserves it, it\u2019s them.</p><p>\u201cSo, we\u2019re christening it today,\u201d Dante continues. \u201cAnd I know it seems like a bad time, but it might be a good distraction for you to come. We\u2019re having a little party on the boat afterward for close friends and it might be a good opportunity to talk with Stefan.\u201d</p><p>I stare at him. \u201cThat\u2019s an excellent idea,\u201d I tell him. I glance at Quinn. \u201cWant to go?\u201d</p><p>He shrugs and smiles. \u201cSure. Apparently, I\u2019ve never met a party that I didn\u2019t like.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s so casual and cool and collected about everything that it makes my heart constrict. If it were me, I\u2019d be flying off the handle and freaking out. But he\u2019s not. He\u2019s as calm as can be. We\u2019re like yin and yang. Perfect opposites.</p> <p>\u201cHow about we go for that walk now?\u201d Quinn asks me quietly.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>We leave everyone else in the Great Room as we head out the back doors into the fragrant gardens.</p><p>\u201cYour concern for me is sweet,\u201d he tells me as we walk down the picturesque winding stone path. I glance at him.</p><p>\u201cOf course I\u2019m concerned for you. I can\u2019t believe this is happening. You can\u2019t go home right now. You just...can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He stops. We\u2019re hidden behind flower vines now, a good distance from the house beneath our own little canopy of white flowers. I gulp a big mouthful of the scented air.</p><p>\u201cIs there a reason why not?\u201d he asks huskily. \u201cIs there a reason why you want me to stay?\u201d</p><p>I am frozen as I look into his brown eyes.</p> <p>There are hundreds of reasons. I can\u2019t even begin to list them.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I say simply.</p><p>And I lean up and press my lips to his, pulling his face down to meet mine. I wrap my arms around his neck and I feel like I don\u2019t ever want to let go. And at that realization, I pull away, breathless.</p><p>\u201cThere is a reason. It\u2019s because I don\u2019t ever want you to leave,\u201d I tell him. \u201cI want you to stay here with me. I think I\u2019m falling in love with you.\u201d</p><p>Quinn sucks in his breath and pulls me back to him. His lips crush mine and he lifts me up. I circle his strong waist with my legs and he holds me there, for what seems like an eternity. I am surrounded by his musky male scent and his muscular arms. I love being in his arms. So I tell him that. And he squeezes me tighter.</p><p>I kiss him until I can\u2019t breathe.</p><p>And then I tell him that I can\u2019t breathe.</p><p>He laughs and slides me to the ground.</p><p>\u201cWhat am I going to do with you?\u201d he shakes his head. I grin.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to figure out how to get out of this mess and stay here with me for the rest of the year. And we\u2019re going to date. And then you\u2019re going to fall in love with me, too.\u201d</p><p>I stare at him.</p><p>He stares back.</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you think that I haven\u2019t already gotten started on that?\u201d</p><p>I smile. \u201cHave you?\u201d</p><p>He nods slowly. \u201cMia, I\u2019ve been falling in love with you for weeks.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s my turn to suck in my breath. And then I kiss him again.</p><p>And again.</p><p>And again.</p><p>And then one more time for good measure.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to live happily ever after,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>Quinn stares at me. \u201cOh, we will, will we? I thought happily ever after was just a fairy tale thing?\u201d</p><p>I sniff. \u201cShows how much you know. Besides, we live in paradise, Quinn. Obviously, we live in a real life fairy tale.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d he answers. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize that fairy tales had police stations and handcuffs and black eyes. But I\u2019ll take your word for it.\u201d</p><p>He grabs my hand and we continue walking.</p><p>\u201cQuinn, my dad will talk to Stefan. And we\u2019ll get this sorted out.\u201d</p><p>Quinn glances at me. \u201cThank you, Mia. For believing in me so strongly that you went to bat with your father. I know that was hard for you.\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cIt turned out to be pretty painless. So, don\u2019t mention it. Until such time that I need to call in a favor and then I\u2019ll mention it.\u201d</p><p>Quinn laughs. \u201cHmm. Okay. The next time I have to save your topless ass from paparazzi, you can mention it.\u201d</p><p>I laugh and feel warm, fluttery feelings.</p><p>We walk and chat for quite a while longer. Quinn picks me flowers and I carry them. We stop periodically and kiss. And then kiss more. I love the dimple that he gets when he smiles. And I love his lop-sided grin. And the way he always tastes like mint. I tell him these things and he shakes his head, making me realize that I also love it when he shakes his head. So I tell him that, too.</p><p>He says that he thinks that my head injury might have done more damage than we originally thought.</p><p>So I smack him on the arm.</p><p>Then kiss him so more.</p><p>After an hour or so, Dante and Reece come out and find us and we sit and have lemonade on the veranda. Reece watches the way I hang onto Quinn\u2019s arm with a knowing smile. But she doesn\u2019t say anything. And no one has been able to reach Gavin yet. But we put it out of our minds.</p><p>It has to work out.</p><p>It has to.</p><p>Reece and I go change our clothes into sundresses. Mine is hot pink, my new signature color. I wear strappy sandals and pink lip gloss. I\u2019ve decided that I enjoy being a girly girl. Sort of.</p><p>I also blame this on my brain injury.</p><p>Dante and Reece have to leave for the christening early, so Quinn and I ride together in Darius\u2019 truck. I slide over and sit in the middle.</p><p>Our ride is silent, but he reaches over and grabs my hand, holding it on his leg. It feels so good to be here with him. I lay my head on his shoulder and close my eyes.</p><p>We have to fix this.</p><p>We so have to fix this.</p><p>When we arrive at the pier, there is a small crowd already formed. The crowd quickly gets bigger. The Caberrans see this christening as a sign of re-birth. After the assassination attempt last year and the earthquake, it is a step forward. A symbol. It says, We can move on no matter what obstacles we face. It causes a lump to form in my throat.</p><p>We are allowed to board the boat because we have a personal invitation from Dimitri. So, we stand behind him with Dante and Reece as Dimitri speaks.</p><p>He speaks of hope and grace, of strength and patriotism. He speaks of enthusiasm and hard work and faith and love. My throat constricts more with each word that he speaks. Quinn squeezes my hand. I lean into his side.</p><p>Finally, the champagne bottle is broken on the side of the beautiful new yacht and the ceremony is over.</p><p>Quinn and I take a tour of The Sunflower and I am astounded at the beauty of it. It\u2019s gorgeous and bright and modern. There are bedrooms and a galley and sitting rooms. There is a wrap-around balcony with a railing and there are reading nooks. There is a hot tub, even. It\u2019s a gorgeous boat. But the one thing we don\u2019t find on our tour, is Gavin.</p><p>Or Stefan.</p><p>And that makes me feel nauseas.</p><p>How can I plead Quinn\u2019s case if I can\u2019t find them?</p><p>I console myself with crab cakes and a glass of champagne. Quinn has a glass too and reminds me that the drinking age in America is twenty-one. He can\u2019t get over that it is legal here for us.</p><p>I am not as enthralled with that because this is normal for me.</p><p>We make our way to a sitting area on the stern of The Sunflower. Surprisingly, there is no one out here and we are alone. I perch on the cushioned edge of the seat and stare out at the rippling turquoise water.</p><p>Quinn pulls me into his lap. And he nuzzles my neck and kisses me until I\u2019m breathless. Goosebumps form wherever his lips touch and I shiver from the sheer pleasure of it.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so strong,\u201d I tell him as I run my fingers lightly across his chest.</p><p>He smiles. \u201cAnd you\u2019re so small.\u201d</p><p>I smile. \u201cTrue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel like you might fit in my pocket,\u201d he says conversationally. He pulls me more tightly against him. \u201cMia, even if I have to go home, we can make it work. Look at Dante and Reece. They managed it, until Dante went to America.\u201d</p><p>I sigh.</p><p>\u201cBut they were miserable,\u201d I tell him. \u201cThat\u2019s why Dante went to America. And they\u2019ve been together ever since.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he says quietly. \u201cBut we\u2019ll figure it out. Look how much we\u2019ve overcome already. You had a brain injury for god\u2019s sake. And here we are now- you\u2019re sitting on my lap and you\u2019re in love with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m falling in love with you,\u201d I remind him laughingly. \u201cDon\u2019t get ahead of yourself, Awesome One.\u201d</p><p>He laughs. \u201cHeaven forbid,\u201d he answers. \u201cLet me know when you\u2019re there, okay? That might be a good thing for me to know.\u201d</p><p>I laugh, but before I can answer, before I can tell that I do, in fact, love him right now, Reece pops her head out.</p><p>\u201cThere you are!\u201d She walks out onto the deck. \u201cI\u2019ve been hunting for you everywhere. Gavin\u2019s here. He arrived an hour ago. You should go talk to him, Mia. He might listen to you.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m already up and on my way.</p><p>Quinn stays with Reece, because that\u2019s the smart thing to do. But I weave through the crowded rooms. And I don\u2019t see him.</p><p>I walk all around the yacht on the deck and don\u2019t see him.</p><p>I search through the galleys and the reading nooks.</p><p>I don\u2019t see him.</p><p>And then I head to the upper deck.</p><p>After walking around the deck walkway, I head down a middle hall. And I hear him laugh. There is no one up here because this is where the bedrooms are.</p><p>But I hear him laugh again.</p><p>He\u2019s definitely here.</p><p>I follow the sound. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Right to a bedroom door.</p><p>What the hell?</p><p>I push the door open and am shocked beyond belief.</p><p>It\u2019s Gavin alright. And he\u2019s naked. And he\u2019s not alone.</p> <p>Gavin and Elena are in bed.</p><p>Together.</p><p>What.</p><p>The.</p><p>Hell.</p> <p>\u201cMia!\u201d Gavin exclaims. He yanks the bedcovers up over Elena\u2019s naked body and I am frozen in the doorway. I can\u2019t believe my eyes. A week ago, I would have been devastated because I thought I was falling in love with Gavin.</p><p>Thank god I have my memories back and know otherwise.</p><p>Because this would have crushed my heart.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d I murmur. I can\u2019t tear my eyes away from Gavin\u2019s. His are troubled. He didn\u2019t want me to see this. That much is apparent.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s it look like, Mia? God!\u201d Elena snaps.</p><p>And we\u2019re clearly back to normal now. Ice Bitch is back to being bitchy. Only now, I\u2019ve got the upper-hand. I realize that in a rush. They won\u2019t want anyone to know about this, so they\u2019re at a huge disadvantage. I hate to play hardball with Gavin but the fate of my happiness hangs in the balance.</p> <p>\u201cGavin, seriously! Here? On Dimitri\u2019s new boat? What the hell do you think he\u2019d say if he knew?\u201d I snap. Gavin looks a bit dismayed.</p><p>As he should.</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t find out,\u201d Gavin says slowly. \u201cAnd Dante won\u2019t either. Will he, Mia?\u201d</p><p>He looks at me pointedly.</p><p>My heart clenches a little. I do love Gavin, even if it is only like a brother or a best friend. I look at Elena.</p><p>\u201cGet dressed and get out. I need to talk to Gavin.\u201d</p><p>She practically snarls at me, but she does pull her clothes on. She flounces past me in a huff. \u201cI\u2019d better not hear people talking about this, Mia. Or there will be hell to pay!\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t even bother to answer her. I wait until she\u2019s gone and then I close the door. And then I sit next to Gavin.</p> <p>\u201cGav, seriously. What are you doing?\u201d</p><p>He sighs.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing, apparently. She was rubbing herself on me like she always does and I felt rejected by you and it seemed like a good idea at the time. Obviously, it wasn\u2019t. Please tell me you aren\u2019t going to tell anyone, Mi.\u201d</p><p>I reach up and touch his face. His eye is still swollen and black from where Quinn punched him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry all of this happened,\u201d I tell him softly. \u201cI\u2019m sorry that you and Quinn fought. I\u2019m sorry that I drove you to that. I\u2019m sorry that I didn\u2019t know what I wanted- and that I led you on, I guess. I didn\u2019t mean to, but I did. And I hate that I hurt you, Gav. I love you like a brother- like a best friend. Because you are my best friend, and I\u2019m so worried that I\u2019ve lost you.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m crying now. All of a sudden. The tears just start streaking down my face and I wipe at them.</p><p>Gavin pulls me to him. He smells like sex, but I ignore that part. I focus instead on the comforting way that he\u2019s patting my back.</p><p>\u201cMia, don\u2019t cry,\u201d he whispers into my hair. \u201cI love you too. And you know what? It\u2019s okay. You and I weren\u2019t meant to be. We weren\u2019t. If we were, we would have realized it a long time ago. You\u2019re my best friend, too. And I\u2019m sorry about everything.\u201d</p><p>I pull away and look at him.</p><p>\u201cSo, we\u2019re good?\u201d</p><p>He nods.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll always be good.\u201d</p><p>I exhale slowly. Knowing that I haven\u2019t lost him is the biggest sense of relief I\u2019ve ever felt. But then I remember why I\u2019m here.</p><p>I stare into his eyes.</p><p>\u201cGav, you\u2019ve got to talk to your dad. It\u2019s not right that he\u2019s pressing charges against Quinn. Quinn was only protecting himself and you know it.\u201d</p><p>Gavin looks uncomfortable and fidgets a bit.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t control my dad,\u201d he finally says. \u201cYou know that. You know how he is.\u201d</p><p>I nod.</p><p>\u201cI do. But in this instance, you\u2019ve got to. It\u2019s not fair to send Quinn back to America now. Not for something that wasn\u2019t his fault. You were mad at me, at the situation and you took it out on Quinn. He shouldn\u2019t have to pay the price for that.\u201d</p><p>Gavin is still hesitating, so I have to use my leverage. The leverage that I don\u2019t want to use.</p><p>\u201cGav, if you make your father drop the charges, I will never breathe a word of what I saw here today. Ever. Not to anyone. Not to Reece, not to Dante, not to Dante\u2019s father.\u201d</p><p>Gavin stares at me, his gaze a bit cool.</p><p>\u201cAnd if I don\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cLet\u2019s not worry about that, okay? Because I know you\u2019ll do the right thing and make your father drop this.\u201d</p><p>The moment is charged. Gavin\u2019s eyes are pissed. I can see that. But he has to know that I\u2019m right. And the fact that I even had to use this situation as leverage make me angry too.</p><p>\u201cGavin, this is ridiculous. You\u2019re a better person than this. You know what the right thing to do is. You\u2019re a good person\u2014just do the right thing.\u201d</p><p>We\u2019re having a stare-down. His dark gaze meets mine. And holds.</p><p>And holds.</p><p>And holds until I grow fidgety and uncomfortable.</p><p>And then finally he sighs.</p><p>\u201cFine. You\u2019re right. I was pissed because things didn\u2019t turn out the way I\u2019d hoped. I\u2019ll talk to my father tonight. We\u2019ll get it straightened out. You\u2019re right. Quinn doesn\u2019t deserve this.\u201d</p><p>A rush of relief floods through me.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I murmur. I reach over and grab his hand. \u201cThank you. I appreciate this so much.\u201d</p><p>He nods. \u201cI know. And it\u2019s the right thing to do. I\u2019m sorry that he was arrested in the first place. My dad was angry and I couldn\u2019t talk him out of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I tell him. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what we thought happened.\u201d</p><p>Gavin gets dressed and we find Dante, Reece and Quinn. Before anyone can say anything, Gavin steps forward and holds his hand out to Quinn.</p><p>Quinn shakes it without hesitation.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Gavin tells him. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have punched you. Or shoved you. It wasn\u2019t your fault that the situation frustrated me. I hope you can forgive me. I\u2019m going to talk to my dad tonight and convince him to drop the charges.\u201d</p><p>Quinn nods and accepts his apology. And then we all sit and chat for another hour. It\u2019s so surreal that I can\u2019t even believe that it\u2019s happening.</p><p>But it is.</p><p>And we actually have fun, all curled up on the stern of The Sunflower, sipping at champagne and eating appetizers. We laugh, we joke, and things almost seem normal. I don\u2019t say a word about finding Gavin with Elena and I don\u2019t see her again all evening. Gavin doesn\u2019t even seem to notice her absence.</p><p>Later in the night, after we go back to Giliberti House, Gavin calls and tells me that his father agreed to let the whole thing go.</p><p>I exhale a long sigh of relief and I feel like the weight of the world has slipped from my shoulders. I didn\u2019t even realize how uptight I was about it until this moment. And in this moment, I feel like I could fly.</p><p>So I fly down the hall and tell Quinn the good news.</p><p>It is morning before I creep quietly back to my own room.</p><p>Apparently, New Mia\u2019s boyfriend is sexy as hell and has mad-bedroom-skills.</p><p>I smile as I close my bedroom door softly behind me. My knees are still weak, but I don\u2019t meow at myself this time. Anyone\u2019s knees would be weak after the night that I had.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Three</p><p>Two Months Later</p><p>Reece and I are meowing at Quinn.</p><p>This is not unusual. Every chance we get, we do it. It\u2019s hilarious. Or we\u2019re just easily entertained. One or the other.</p><p>This time, it is because Quinn is refusing to wear a speedo in the normal European fashion. He insists on sticking to swim trunks. Although the point of him wearing a suit at all is sort of moot. He still can\u2019t swim.</p><p>We\u2019re at the beach today. Dante and Reece stayed in Caberra and school finally resumed after construction was complete, but we\u2019re out for Christmas break now. It\u2019s been a hectic and stressful past couple of months.</p><p>We\u2019ve worked our tails off, volunteering on different clean-up committees, to get Valese back to the beautiful, pristine city that it should be. And we\u2019ve succeeded. You almost can\u2019t tell that an earthquake ever hit.</p><p>Sadly, the construction on my own home is almost finished and I\u2019ll be moving back home within the month. I say sadly because I love being out at Giliberti House with Quinn, Dante and Reece. But I\u2019ll just have to make the drive to visit them after I move.</p><p>Every day.</p><p>Maybe even twice a day.</p><p>\u201cQuinn, just grow a pair and wear the speedo,\u201d Gavin shouts from down the beach. He and Quinn have patched up their differences in the way that only boys can and even consider each other a friend again. It will never cease to amaze me how boys can get mad, get in a physical fight and then get over it. The male species is truly weird.</p><p>Gavin shouts again, louder this time for effect. \u201cJust grow a set!\u201d</p><p>Quinn runs him down, then tackles him to the ground and they roll in the sand for a bit. Somehow, and I don\u2019t exactly know how, Gavin\u2019s speedos end up floating on the waves of the sea.</p><p>Reece and I look at each other and laugh before we resume looking at our magazines from the safety of our beach chairs. The boys rough-house for a while longer and then Dante joins them to throw a Frisbee around.</p><p>As I look around, at my laughing friends, at the beautiful sea, at my BFF next to me, I can\u2019t believe how lucky I am. Life really does seem like a fairy tale.</p><p>But even fairy tales come to an end. I swallow hard as I remember that sad fact. We\u2019re all looking at colleges now though and I know that our happy little group will split apart next year. Gavin and I are looking at Cambridge, while Dante and Reece are looking at colleges in the States. Quinn hasn\u2019t decided yet what he\u2019d like to do. I\u2019m hoping that he will come with me, though.</p><p>Yes, that is selfish.</p><p>But honestly, Cambridge? It\u2019s not exactly like it\u2019s a hardship.</p><p>And even though some things end, endings are just doors closing so that new doors can open, right?</p><p>I watch Quinn now, his muscles flexing and moving as he dives to catch the Frisbee. He holds it up, showing the others that he did, in fact, catch it before it hit the ground. Then he crows because he won.</p><p>He makes his way over to me and with the sunlight shining from behind him, he is heart-stoppingly gorgeous.</p><p>Seriously.</p><p>I squint up at him as he holds a hand out.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d I ask him, then grin.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d he tells me. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a deal to uphold.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m confused and I tell him that. He smiles.</p><p>\u201cYou were supposed to teach me to swim months ago. And you haven\u2019t yet.\u201d</p><p>I consider that.</p><p>\u201cTrue,\u201d I tell him. \u201cBut we\u2019ve been busy with other things. Like, you know, rebuilding a city.\u201d</p><p>He laughs and pulls me to my feet.</p><p>\u201cExcuses, excuses,\u201d he chuckles. \u201cI don\u2019t see a hammer in your hand right now. I think you can fit me in.\u201d</p><p>He wraps his arm around my waist and I tuck myself into his side. We walk leisurely down the beach and I stare up at him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m lucky,\u201d I tell him suddenly.

You don\u2019t have to keep calling me that. Awesome One will do.\u201d</p> <p>I roll my eyes.</p><p>But he is awesome. I\u2019m just never going to admit that to him. He\u2019s cocky enough as it is... but that\u2019s just the way I like him.</p><p>The sun beats down on our shoulders as we walk down to a pier. The sea laps softly at the wood and I stare down at the clear water.</p><p>I tell him again the mechanics of swimming.</p><p>And he nods.</p> <p>\u201cGot it,\u201d he tells me. \u201cKeep my head up, relax and float. I can do it.\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cYes, you can. And I\u2019ll be right there with you.\u201d</p><p>He laughs. \u201cI think we\u2019ve established this, Mi. You can\u2019t save me. You\u2019re half my size.\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve saved you already,\u201d I tell him. \u201cI\u2019ve saved you from an empty life without me in it.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m totally joking, of course, but he nods. He seems thoughtful.</p> <p>\u201cMia,\u201d he says huskily, as he pulls me to him. \u201cI was just wondering about something. Remember a couple of months ago...you said you were falling for me. Then you said you weren\u2019t quite there. You were going to let me know when you were, but you\u2019ve never said anything.\u201d</p><p>He pauses.</p><p>And pauses.</p><p>And looks at me with an eyebrow raised.</p><p>I sigh happily. And smile.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m there,\u201d I tell him. \u201cI love you, Quinn McKeyen. I thought you already knew.\u201d</p><p>He grins and my knees weaken.</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d he admits. \u201cI\u2019ve known all along. I just wanted to hear you say it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI love you,\u201d I tell him softly. Then I lean up on my tiptoes and whisper into his ear. \u201cI love you. Forever and ever and ever.\u201d</p><p>He grins and grabs my hand.</p><p>\u201cForever and ever and ever?\u201d He raises an eyebrow now.</p><p>I nod. \u201cYep. I told you\u2014this is our own personal fairy tale.\u201d</p><p>He laughs and I squeeze his hand.</p><p>\u201cOn three, okay?\u201d</p><p>He nods.</p><p>We count to three.</p><p>And then we jump.</p><p>The End </p> </body></html>"]
