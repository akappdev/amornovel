I let my guard down for the first time in months and now I\u2019m going to pay the ultimate price \u2013 the one person in my world that I love more than my own life will be taken from me in the blink of an eye because of my stupidity. I did everything I could to keep Emma safe; I hid, I lied and I worked my fingers to the bone, but it was all for nothing. This precious little being that came screaming into my world six years ago and gave me a reason to breathe every single day since then \u2013 I had failed her.</p><p>I watch in horror as my baby struggles to breathe through the tears and the thick, silver tape over her mouth. Her muffled whimpers are like a knife straight through my heart and I fight with everything inside of me to get loose from the bindings holding me in place. I scream and cry with a pain I\u2019ve never felt before as I try so hard to get free. The ropes cut into my wrists and ankles as I twist and turn, thrash and fight. I need to go to her, I need to wrap my arms around her and calm her fears, tell her everything will be okay, but I can\u2019t. How does a mother sit tied to a chair on the other side of the room from her child and just watch her suffer? The years of mental and physical abuse, broken bones and shattered spirit are nothing compared to this.</p><p>\u201cYou just couldn\u2019t leave well enough alone, could you? We were supposed to be a family and you ruined it all.\u201d</p> <p>A fist connects with my cheek and for a moment, I close my eyes to ward off the pain. I don\u2019t have time to wallow in my own self-pity though. I quickly blink my eyes back into focus and my gaze immediately goes to my little one across the room, staring at me wide-eyed. My pain means nothing right now; the only thing that matters to me is making sure Emma is okay. It\u2019s been just the two of us against the world for months now. I had my brother, and I had Austin, but it\u2019s not the same. Their love doesn\u2019t even hold a candle to the love between mother and daughter. There\u2019s a piece of my heart living and breathing outside of my body and for six years it\u2019s been the most amazing miracle to watch her grow and change. Now, I realize just how fragile that piece of my heart is; I can\u2019t protect her and I can\u2019t save her. I don\u2019t want her to see how scared I am, but I can do nothing to stop the sobs from escaping.</p><p>The fear and sadness I see on my daughter\u2019s beautiful, perfect little face makes my stomach cramp and hurts worse than any blow I\u2019ve ever taken to my body. I\u2019m accustomed to the agony and humiliation of abuse. I\u2019ve learned how to shut down my mind and my heart and pretend like it wasn\u2019t really happening to me, but Emma was never supposed to witness this horror. She was never supposed to know how weak I really am. I did everything I could to shield her from this awfulness \u2013 I fled in the middle of the night with nothing but the clothes on our backs, I made a new life for us and I showered my girl with enough love to make up for the missing parent in her life.</p><p>I should have realized you could never outrun your past. It always has a way of catching up with you. My past and my present have collided and nothing will be able to heal the wounds from this devastation.</p><p>For a brief moment, I wish Austin were here. I tried so hard not to love him, not to trust him, but it was impossible. He was full of life and made me want things I knew I could never have. He made me promises I should have known he wouldn\u2019t keep and he made me want things I had no business dreaming of. I should have known he\u2019d run the first chance he got. I always trusted the wrong people and it always came back to bite me in the ass.</p><p>\u201cYou took everything from me. I had a plan. It was going to be perfect.\u201d</p> <p>As our tormentor stalks across the room towards Emma, I scream and cry so loudly that I\u2019m certain someone must hear me, but no one does. No one ever hears me. Emma and I are alone in this nightmare. I\u2019m going to have to sit here, strapped to this chair, bruises marking every inch of my body and watch as my child is taken from me.</p><p>\u201cPlease, don\u2019t do this! You love her, I know you love her. I\u2019m sorry the things I did hurt you but please, don\u2019t take it out on her.\u201d</p><p>I can feel layers of my skin being ripped to shreds as I continue to use every ounce of strength left in me to get free. Blood drips down my palms and off the tips of my fingers to pool on the floor as the monster I spent my life trusting aims a gun at Emma\u2019s chest.</p><p>Oh God, this can\u2019t be happening. I can\u2019t live in a world where she doesn\u2019t exist.</p><p>The click of a bullet being released into the chamber of the gun echoes around the room. \u201cNow it\u2019s your turn to lose it all.\u201d</p><p>I hold Emma\u2019s frightened gaze in my own and try to tell her with my eyes how much I love her and how sorry I am. With a sinking feeling of dread that makes me nauseous, I know our time is up. There\u2019s nothing I can do now but pray that death happens quickly and painlessly for my beautiful baby girl \u2013 and that this asshole will show a tiny bit of mercy and put me out of my misery soon after.</p> <p>The explosion of the gun going off happens without warning and I let out a blood-curdling scream.</p><p>Chapter 1</p><p>Austin</p><p>Two months earlier...</p><p>\u201cI just got your voicemail. Um, are you sure you want me to fill in for you at the office? I don\u2019t think your sister is going to like that very much,\u201d I state into the phone.</p><p>Locking the front door behind me, I head out into the bright morning light and slide behind the wheel of my rental car. I just flew back into the states five hours ago from Afghanistan. After six days in the desert doing surveillance and the fifteen-hour flights to and from the country, I\u2019m surprised I even know what fucking day it is. As soon as I got to the rental house that I\u2019ve called home for the last month, I passed out face down on the bed for a few hours before I checked my voicemails. The only reason I\u2019m not sleeping the day away is because my SEAL brother needs me.</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m sure I want you to fill in for me at the office. Gwen\u2019s got some personal things going on in her life, and there\u2019s no way I want her handling any cases on her own while I\u2019m gone,\u201d Brady explains to me.</p><p>I can hear heavy breathing and kissing sounds through the phone line as I back out of the driveway and head towards downtown Nashville. I chuckle to myself and shake my head. A few months ago, Brady was hired to help with security for one of the biggest pop stars in the country \u2013 Layla Carlyle. I knew the first time he called me bitching and moaning about her that it wouldn\u2019t be long before he\u2019d go over to the dark side like our other team member, Garrett McCarthy. Both of those assholes gave up the single life in the blink of an eye. By the sounds on the other end of the line, I\u2019m guessing that Brady\u2019s decision to go on tour with Layla has proven to be a good idea.</p> <p>\u201cAlright, but don\u2019t say I didn\u2019t warn you. That chick will be pissed off when she sees me walk through that door,\u201d I reply with a laugh.</p><p>There\u2019s more shuffling through the line and I\u2019m pretty sure I just heard a gasp.</p><p>Lucky fucking bastard.</p><p>\u201cAustin, I have to go. Just remember one thing: no fucking my sister.\u201d</p><p>The call ends abruptly and I laugh again as I toss my phone onto the passenger seat. I really can\u2019t be offended at Brady\u2019s parting words. I\u2019ve made it my mission in life to screw beautiful women, and Gwen Marshall is a gorgeous fucking woman.</p><p>She\u2019s also got an attitude a mile long and would probably chew off my head and spit it out if I ever banged her. To be fair though, we didn\u2019t exactly meet under the best of circumstances a month ago. Brady called me when Layla went missing and I dropped everything, drove out here to bumfuck nowhere Tennessee, and helped him get his woman back. Gwen and I spoke on the phone a few times before I headed out here and let\u2019s just say those phone calls were some of my best work. I could tell as soon as I heard her raspy, beautiful, attitude-filled voice on the phone that I would enjoy getting under her skin. My attempts at flirting were swatted away like an asshole housefly. But I\u2019m a SEAL \u2013 we don\u2019t give up easily.</p><p>\u201cThis is Gwen, Brady Marshall\u2019s sister. Your friend Garrett gave me your number. I need some help finding information for a case we\u2019re working on.\u201d</p><p>I knew Brady had a sister; he\u2019d spoken about her once or twice. I assumed she was still in high school. The voice on the other end of the line most definitely belonged to a woman.</p><p>\u201cDo you prefer pancakes or eggs?\u201d I replied nonchalantly.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t, I like...what?\u201d</p><p>The confusion in her voice made me laugh.</p><p>\u201cWell, I figure since you need a favor from me, the least I could do is make you breakfast the next morning when you pay me back.\u201d</p><p>The silence on the other end of the line lasted for so long that I pulled the phone away from my ear to make sure the call hadn\u2019t been dropped.</p><p>\u201cYou have issues. Can you help me get the information I need or not?\u201d she finally asked sarcastically.</p><p>\u201cI can get you anything you need, darlin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>I heard her sigh in annoyance and that just made me want to push her even more.</p><p>\u201cWe need everything you can find on a woman named Eve Carlyle. No one will give us anything.\u201d</p><p>I smiled to myself. She wasn\u2019t easily rattled; I liked that in a woman.</p><p>\u201cI can always make a woman talk. I have this trick I do with my tongue where I swirl-\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, I get it. Stop talking,\u201d she interrupted. \u201cJust, send me an email with whatever you find.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s not like I\u2019d ever really sleep with her. She\u2019s my best friend\u2019s sister. There are rules in the Guy\u2019s Handbook that you never fuck with your friend\u2019s sister. Or fuck your friend\u2019s sister. Brady knows I\u2019m not the settling-down type and I\u2019m sure his sister, with the giant stick up her ass, is the type of woman who would want the white picket fence and nine million snot-nosed kids running around while she nagged the poor bastard who married her day in and day out. No, thank you. One night is about all I can stand with any woman.</p><p>It would take a pretty strong woman to put up with a guy like me and the kind of job I have, which is why it\u2019s always easy to sneak out the morning after and never call them again \u2013 I haven\u2019t met any woman who could fit that bill. I\u2019m a Navy SEAL for life. I can get a call in the middle of the night and be in another country with a gun in my hand and an insurgent in my crosshairs before the little missus even had her first cup of coffee. I live and breathe the job. It\u2019s what I was made to do and even though some of the missions have left me with scars, physically and mentally that I\u2019ll never be able to remove, I still love every second of it. I love the thrill, I love the unknown and I love the danger. I go into each mission knowing full well I might not come home, like so many of my SEAL brothers. There isn\u2019t a woman alive who would understand that dedication and the need I have to take such dangerous chances with my life.</p><p>I\u2019ve never had a family so it\u2019s not like I know what I\u2019m missing. To put it nicely, my mother was a whore. She tried to raise me on her own, since she had no idea which one of the many loser men in her life were my father, but after five years she realized that having a child interfered with her partying. She handed me over to the state and I never saw her again. I was passed around from foster home to foster home, each one slightly worse than the last, until I was eighteen years old. Knowing I had no other choice, I immediately enlisted in the Navy and I\u2019ve never looked back. I never had parents with a wonderful marriage to look up to and I never had siblings to connect with. I have my SEAL brothers and that\u2019s all that matters. Even if I were the type of guy to settle down, I wouldn\u2019t know what the fuck to do with a wife and kids anyway.</p><p>As I drive through downtown Nashville, I wonder if the Ice Queen has melted a little bit since the last time I saw her. When I said I knew Brady had a sister, that was pretty much the extent of my knowledge of her until I met her a month ago. Brady was never the type of guy who opened up about himself or his family life. I knew she existed and I knew she was younger than him. I knew he came from a really well off family and that like me, as soon as he turned eighteen, he got the hell out of there. Since Gwen was younger, she stayed behind and up until recently, he hadn\u2019t spoken to her much. Brady never talked about his reasons for leaving all that wealth behind and I never asked. Every man has a few skeletons in his closet and sometimes, those little bastards need to stay right where they are.</p><p>Then, I talked to Gwen on the phone and got to meet her in person while I helped to track down the mad man who took Layla. I\u2019m not used to a chick practically hating me on sight, but that\u2019s how it went down. We spent a few days together before and after Layla was taken and I\u2019m surprised you can\u2019t still see the stab wounds her damn attitude left on my ego. So why the hell am I more excited about this assignment than the one we did two years ago when we shut down a drug smuggling ring in Cuba? Good question. Call me a glutton for punishment.</p><p>At the mention of Gwen having some \u201cpersonal things\u201d going on her life, I immediately wondered what the fuck she could possibly have going on. The only thing I know about her is that she suddenly showed up in Brady\u2019s life again a few months ago, has been living with him at his apartment and working for him at his PI agency. The little time I spent with her tracking down Layla proved she was determined and hard working. It also proved that everything I said or did bugged the shit out of her.</p><p>Pulling the rental car up in front of Brady\u2019s office, I smile to myself as I get out and make my way up to the glass door. Gwen is not going to be happy to see me at all, especially knowing her brother called me and thinks she needs a keeper. I can already imagine the smoke coming out of her ears and the curses flying from her mouth.</p><p>With a cocky smile firmly in place, I pull open the door and saunter in. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Oh yeah, this is going to be fun.</p><p>Chapter 2</p><p>Gwen</p> <p>Hanging up the phone, I make some notes about a new case on the legal pad in front of me. It\u2019s weird being here in the office alone, but it feels good. It\u2019s nice to know my brother trusts me to handle his business while he\u2019s touring the country with Layla. He was hesitant to leave me alone, especially when I told him I had finally bitten the bullet and filed for divorce. After a few weeks with nothing but positive news from my lawyer that William isn\u2019t contesting anything and that he\u2019s being very cooperative, I shoved Brady out the door and assured him I would call if there were any problems.</p><p>The bell dings above the front door and I don\u2019t look up from my notes, but I do glance at the clock on the desk phone. One of our regular clients, Allison Kinter, was supposed to be here forty-five minutes ago for a follow-up meeting. I can\u2019t stand the woman. Every other week she\u2019s in here complaining that her husband is cheating on her. And every other week, we find absolutely nothing to support that claim, much to her annoyance. She\u2019s pushy, condescending and reminds me too much of my mother.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re late,\u201d I state in annoyance, scribbling one last thing on the page.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, darlin\u2019. If I would have known you were sitting here anxiously awaiting my arrival I would have got here earlier.\u201d</p><p>My head whips up at the sound of the gravely, masculine voice with a tiny hint of southern drawl that under normal circumstances would make my insides melt. Unfortunately, that voice belongs to a man whose ego far outweighs his good looks. Southern gentleman he is not.</p> <p>\u201cGet out,\u201d I demand, standing up from my chair and crossing my arms in front of me.</p><p>Austin perches his hip on the edge of my desk and smiles at me. \u201cNow, don\u2019t be like that. I know you\u2019ve missed me.\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes at his audacity. It\u2019s really sad that a man this good looking is such a pompous ass. He\u2019s easily six-foot-three and two hundred pounds of athletic muscle. His sandy brown hair is cut military short and his bright blue eyes sparkle as he smiles at me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve missed you just about as much as I\u2019ve missed chlamydia,\u201d I state dryly.</p><p>He laughs and looks away from me, flipping through some of the files on top of my desk. I don\u2019t know what it is about this man that turns me into such a bitch. Oh, wait, yes I do. I only spent three days with him a month ago, but I learned enough about him in those few days to make me want to stay far away from him. His blatant attempts at flirting and the charm he turns up so high it gives me a headache reeks of arrogance and a man used to always getting what he wants. I spent ten miserable years with a man like that and I\u2019ll never make that same mistake again. William was charming and flirtatious too \u2013 until something set him off and my body became a punching bag.</p><p>Getting my head out of my ass, I pull my gaze away from the muscles flexing in the bicep of his arm he\u2019s using to hold himself up on my desk. Reaching over, I smack his hand and gather up all of the files. I quickly shove them in my top drawer, slam it shut with a bang and glare at him.</p> <p>What the hell is he doing here anyway? The last I heard from Brady, he jetted off in the middle of the night for some emergency mission and had no clue when he\u2019d be back stateside. I kind of hoped after our few encounters that he would fall victim to a rabid camel attack in Siberia, or wherever the hell he went.</p><p>\u201cBrady\u2019s not here. You can go now.\u201d</p><p>Turning away from him, I walk over to the small kitchen counter on the far side of the office and pour myself a much needed, strong cup of coffee.</p><p>\u201cWell, lucky for you, I\u2019m not here to see Brady. I\u2019m here for you.\u201d</p><p>Just the way he says those words makes my gut clench. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s in annoyance or lust. Either idea pisses me off. My track record with men, well one man, is rife with misery and pain. Just the idea that I would want someone at all, especially someone like Austin Conrad, is enough to make me stack up a million more bricks into the solid wall I\u2019ve already surrounded myself with. It\u2019s absolutely absurd that I would find anything about him even remotely attractive.</p><p>Cradling the warm mug in my hand, I turn around and lean against the counter. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason for you to be here for me. So, like I said, you can go now.\u201d</p><p>Austin slides off of my desk, sticks his hands into the front pocket of his jeans and casually walks up to me. He doesn\u2019t stop until our toes are touching and I can smell just a hint of his spicy aftershave. The creases at the corners of his eyes stand out as he smiles down at me. If I could move away from him, I would. But as it is, the edge of the counter is already pressing harshly into my back. He\u2019s too close, too large and he smells too good.</p><p>\u201cSorry, no can do. Your brother told me to look out for you while he\u2019s gone, so that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to do.\u201d</p> <p>The anger rolls through me and I clench so tightly to the coffee mug that I\u2019m surprised it doesn\u2019t shatter in my hand, dousing both of us in scalding hot liquid. So much for Brady trusting me to run the business and take care of myself.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need you, or anyone to babysit me. I\u2019m a grown ass woman and can handle things just fine on my own,\u201d I tell him with barely concealed fury.</p><p>Austin leans in as close as he can with my hands holding the coffee cup between us. I can feel the heat from his body and I have to tamp down the need to drop the cup and touch him.</p><p>Jesus, what the hell is wrong with me? This man is off limits, and not just because he\u2019s a jerk.</p><p>\u201cOh believe me, it\u2019s quite obvious just how grown you are,\u201d he tells me quietly, his eyes traveling down the front of my body.</p><p>It\u2019s disgusting and dirty. And it makes me weak in the knees.</p><p>God dammit, get a grip, Gwen!</p><p>Sliding along the edge of the counter, I move away from him and back to my desk. I need distance from this infuriating man. It\u2019s impossible for him to be serious for one second.</p><p>\u201cBrady is blindly in love and obviously wasn\u2019t thinking straight when he called you. Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll tell him you stopped by. Now leave. I have work to do.\u201d</p><p>I hear Austin sigh from behind me and hope that he\u2019s finally gotten the hint that I don\u2019t want him here. I mean really, do I need to spell it out for him? He needs to go away before I do something stupid. Signing those divorce papers lifted a huge weight off of my shoulders. Not having William track me down and threaten me like he would have done in the past has given me a false sense of security. It\u2019s made me feel like I might finally be able to move forward and be happy again. Of course the first man I\u2019ve had any real contact with since I left William in the middle of the night all those months ago, aside from my brother or a client, had to be this infuriating man who gets under my skin.</p><p>\u201cNow Gwen, you know how much it turns me on when you\u2019re so demanding,\u201d Austin chuckles. \u201cLet\u2019s just call a truce here, okay? My best friend asked me for a favor and I never tell one of my brothers \u2018no\u2019. I\u2019m in between missions and there\u2019s nothing more I\u2019d like than to keep an eye on you.\u201d</p><p>Austin mirrors my earlier pose and leans his back against the edge of the counter, staring me down.</p><p>\u201cLook, I get that you Navy SEALS are a determined bunch and that\u2019s lovely, very helpful for people who actually need it. But you\u2019re not needed or wanted here. End of story,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>The teasing look in his eyes is immediately gone, replaced by a hint of annoyance.</p><p>\u201cListen, princess, I don\u2019t know what kind of trivial shit you have going on in your life and frankly, I don\u2019t care. But your brother seems to be worried about you. The work he does here can be dangerous. You should know that by now. Even though your attitude could cut a man off at the knees, a single, vulnerable woman like yourself doesn\u2019t need to be within ten feet of danger.\u201d</p><p>The fact that he called me princess is enough to raise my hackles, but then to add in the part about my \u2018trivial shit\u2019 pushes me over the edge. Single, vulnerable woman... are you kidding me? He has no fucking idea what my life has been like or the danger I\u2019ve been around and survived. Without warning, a particularly chilling memory surfaces and my hands begin to shake.</p><p>I put on the finishing touches of my make-up and surveyed myself in the mirror. The little black dress William bought me the previous week fits me like a glove and shows off my curves. I\u2019ve pulled my long, blonde hair up into a sleek twist, just the way he likes it. Glancing at the clock on our nightstand, I see that I\u2019m ready in record time and hurry out of our bedroom and down the staircase. William and I haven\u2019t had an evening out alone together in quite some time. Even though this is a work function for him, it\u2019s still nice to get dressed up and go out on the town with my husband. He\u2019d been so stressed at work and on edge since the baby was born, I think this will be good for us.</p><p>As I walk down off of the bottom step, William looked up from the table in the foyer where he sorted through the day\u2019s mail. The smile on my face died when I saw the look in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck are you wearing?\u201d he asked angrily.</p><p>I glanced nervously down at myself, checking to make sure I didn\u2019t get any make-up powder on the front of the dress and that I wore matching shoes. Since I gave birth to Emma three months ago, I had been a little scatterbrained.</p><p>\u201cIt-it\u2019s the dress you got me. Don\u2019t you like it?\u201d I questioned.</p><p>He tossed the mail down on top of the table and stalked over to me. \u201cYour tits are hanging out. Do you want all of my colleagues to think you\u2019re a whore? Jesus, it\u2019s like you don\u2019t even have a fucking brain sometimes.\u201d</p><p>With a shaking hand, I reached up and pressed my palm over the miniscule bit of cleavage that can be seen peeking out from the top of the dress.</p><p>It\u2019s always best not to say anything when William\u2019s in one of his moods. I should know this by now, but I couldn\u2019t help myself. I needed to know why he was so angry.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not showing that much. This dress is very conservative compared to what the other wives will be wearing.\u201d</p><p>The punch to my stomach is quick and takes my breath away. Bending over, I clutched my hands around my middle and struggled to get air into my lungs while trying not to cry. William hated it when I cried.</p><p>\u201cGo upstairs and change. Make it fast. We\u2019re going to be late now because of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGwen. Hey, GWEN!\u201d</p><p>The sound of my name pulls me back from the past and I blink my eyes into focus. Austin has moved from his spot leaning against the counter and is back in my personal space. The concern on his face is evident and I look down at my hands when I feel something hot and wet on them.</p><p>The coffee. Shit, I spilled the coffee.</p><p>Austin gently reaches out and pulls the now half-empty mug out of my shaking hands, placing it on my desk.</p><p>\u201cWhere did you go just now?\u201d he asks quietly, pulling tissues out of the box on my desk and wiping the spilled coffee off my hands.</p><p>I stare in wonder as he softly pats my hands. It\u2019s been so long since someone took care of me. It\u2019s also been a while since I had one of those awful memories. I pushed them all away as soon as I arrived at Brady\u2019s house that night so many months ago. I wouldn\u2019t let myself think about them. I was broken enough; thinking about all of the ways I was a fool would just make things worse.</p><p>Five minutes in Austin\u2019s company and I\u2019m reliving the past. I angrily yank my hands out of his grasp and finish wiping my hands off on my own.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. I don\u2019t need your help.\u201d</p><p>Stepping away from him, I walk over to the garbage can and toss the tissues away.</p><p>\u201cYou just spaced out and spilled hot coffee all over yourself. Stop being so damn stubborn,\u201d he replies.</p><p>Before I can come up with a good insult that will finally make him leave me the hell alone, the bell above the door dings again and the one word that makes everything better is shouted from across the room.</p><p>\u201cMommy!\u201d</p><p>Chapter 3</p><p>Austin</p><p>I probably shouldn\u2019t have called her a princess. That was a dick move, but she\u2019s really pissing me off. Why is it so hard for her to just accept the fact that Brady wants me here and I\u2019m not going anywhere? Who knows what the fuck made her zone out, her hands shake and had her spilling hot coffee over herself. All that irritability bottled up in her tiny, well-endowed body probably short-circuted her brain. Remind me never to call her any names again. Next time she might throw that cup at my head.</p><p>Before I can try to reason with her again, my eyes widen in surprise as a mini version of Gwen comes racing into the office and throws herself at the woman whose ass I\u2019d been staring at when she bent over to throw away the kleenex.</p><p>\u201cHi baby! How was your day?\u201d Gwen asks the little girl as she scoops her up in her arms and peppers her face with kisses.</p><p>An older woman, I didn\u2019t even notice following behind the girl, stands off to the side with a pink backpack in her hands.</p><p>\u201cI colored you a picture at Miss Karen\u2019s and I got to watch a princess movie!\u201d the girl replies excitedly.</p><p>Gwen holds onto her tightly and then turns to the woman. \u201cThanks for dropping her off, Karen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem. I\u2019ll see you tomorrow,\u201d the woman replies before setting the backpack down on the floor. \u201cBye, Emma!\u201d</p><p>The girl turns in Gwen\u2019s arms and waves. \u201cBye, Miss Karen!\u201d</p><p>As the woman leaves, Gwen sets the girl down and she immediately walks over to me.</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d she asks, looking up at me.</p><p>\u201cI was just going to ask you the same thing.\u201d</p><p>I look over at Gwen with my eyebrow raised. How in the hell did Brady never mention his sister had a kid? I don\u2019t like kids. They\u2019re small and they talk too much. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThis is Mr. Austin. And he was just leaving,\u201d Gwen says, looking pointedly at me.</p><p>Yeah, I don\u2019t think so.</p><p>\u201cAustin is the capital of Texas. Do you like pink? My favorite color is pink.\u201d</p> <p>Bending down to get a better look at the little pipsqueak, I see she has the exact same gray colored eyes as her mother, the same smattering of freckles over her nose and the same dark brown hair. Gwen though, has added a few streaks of blue and purple to hers and I\u2019m not gonna lie, it\u2019s hot as fuck.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re pretty smart for a kid. What are you, like twelve or something?\u201d</p><p>Glancing up, I see Gwen giving me the stink-eye.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re funny,\u201d Emma says with a laugh. \u201cI\u2019m six. My mom says I\u2019m really smart. Are you smart? Do you have a job?\u201d</p><p>Gwen snorts and now it\u2019s my turn to glare at her before looking back at Emma. \u201cI\u2019m a genius. And I\u2019m also a Navy SEAL, which makes me pretty bad ass.\u201d</p> <p>Emma holds her hand out in front of me and taps her foot. \u201cOne dollar, please.\u201d</p><p>Pushing myself up to my full height, I stare down at her in confusion. \u201cUh, one dollar for what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne dollar for the swear jar. You said a bad word. Every time my mom says a bad word I get a dollar for my college fund,\u201d Emma replies without missing a beat.</p><p>Awww shit. That\u2019s right. You\u2019re not supposed to swear in front of kids.</p><p>With a sigh, I reach into my back pocket and pull out my wallet, forking over a five. \u201cHere, keep the change. I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll be putting you through college in no time.\u201d</p><p>Emma snatches the five out of my hand and runs over to Gwen. Little Miss Perfect over there probably never swears in front of her kid. And now she\u2019s got one more thing to add to her ever-growing list of reasons why she hates me and doesn\u2019t want me here.</p> <p>\u201cLook, mom! I got five dollars. That makes a total of...\u201d</p><p>I watch as Emma tries to calculate in her head, scrunching up her face and thinking really hard. It would be kind of cute if I thought kids were cute. Which I don\u2019t. At all.</p><p>\u201cThat brings you up to sixty-two dollars,\u201d Gwen tells her quietly.</p><p>I can\u2019t help the bark of laughter that bursts out of me. \u201cWell, well, well. Looks like someone has a potty mouth.\u201d</p><p>Gwen huffs, taking the five dollars from Emma and sticking it into the front pocket of her jeans. \u201cYou\u2019re forgetting we live with my brother. Uncle Brady isn\u2019t used to living with a little girl, right Emma?\u201d</p><p>Emma giggles and shakes her head at Gwen. \u201cLast week you gave me twenty dollars when you were trying to fix the leak under the kitchen sink. And the week before that you gave me ten dollars when you dropped a big book on your toe. And the day before that-\u201d</p><p>Gwen immediately cuts her off by placing her palm over Emma\u2019s mouth. I think I might be changing my mind on my opinion of kids. Staring at Gwen challengingly, I wait for her to explain.</p><p>She sighs. \u201cIt\u2019s been a bad couple of weeks. Emma, why don\u2019t you take your bag into the back room and get started on your homework?\u201d</p> <p>Gwen removes her hand from Emma\u2019s mouth and the little girl smiles up at me before scooping up her backpack and racing off to the back room.</p><p>When Emma is gone, I watch as Gwen nervously fiddles with things on Brady\u2019s desk. She rearranges a cup full of pens, moves a legal pad to an opposite corner and straightens the desk calendar that doesn\u2019t need straightening \u2013 anything she can do to avoid looking at me.</p><p>After a few minutes, I decide to break the silence. \u201cCute kid you got there.\u201d</p><p>She finally turns to face me and gone is the irritation that\u2019s been there since I walked through the door. She suddenly looks small and vulnerable. Looks like I finally found the one thing, or person, who can melt this woman\u2019s heart of stone.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s the father?\u201d I ask curiously.</p><p>I know Gwen lives with Brady and she doesn\u2019t have a ring on her finger, so obviously there isn\u2019t a man in the picture.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s none of your business,\u201d she replies haughtily.</p><p>Poor guy probably couldn\u2019t stand to be around her bad attitude for more than one night; I feel his pain.</p><p>\u201cHey, I\u2019m just trying to make conversation. We\u2019re going to be working together so we might as well get to know each other,\u201d I tell her with a smile.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing you need to know about myself or my daughter. And how many times do I have to tell you that I don\u2019t want you here?\u201d She asks angrily.</p><p>\u201cLook, I could give a rat\u2019s ass if you want me here or not. I\u2019m staying, end of. Your brother is worried and it must be for a good reason. This isn\u2019t just you we\u2019re talking about here. You\u2019ve got a kid, much to my amazement. If you\u2019re too stubborn to let me look out for you, at least I can keep an eye on her.\u201d</p><p>I watch as anger flares in her eyes at the mention of Emma. Her hands ball into fists at her sides and her breathing picks up, her chest heaving with barely concealed fury. \u201cI can look after my daughter just fine without your help. She\u2019s my responsibility and I will keep her safe on my own, just like I\u2019ve done for her entire life. Go. Away.\u201d</p><p>Jesus Christ, I\u2019ve never even met al-Qaeda members who were this annoying.</p><p>At least she\u2019s got one thing going for her \u2013 she\u2019s consistently a bitch. I can handle bitchy Gwen. That whole scene with her freaking out and spilling coffee is out of my comfort zone. She looked scared to death and helpless. It took everything in me not to pull her into my arms and tell her everything would be okay. That alone should have me running out of here like my ass is on fire. I don\u2019t do touchy-feely, comforting shit. Good to know she seems to be the type of person who would rather chew off her own arm than accept comfort from someone else.</p><p>\u201cDarlin\u2019, you can tell me to leave until you\u2019re blue in the face. I\u2019m not going anywhere until Brady comes home, so get that stick out of your ass and get used to it,\u201d I tell her, flopping down on the chair at Brady\u2019s desk and clasping my hands behind my head.</p><p>With a frustrated growl, she turns and stomps off to the back room.</p><p>As I stare at her ass in those tight jeans until she disappears from sight, I can\u2019t help but wonder what the fuck her deal is. How can someone so small be full of so much piss and vinegar? At least one good thing will come of her being such a bitch \u2013 I won\u2019t be tempted to sleep with her anytime soon. I prefer a woman to use her tongue on me for pleasure, not making me miserable with her verbal lashes.</p><p>Brady is going to owe me big time for this shit.</p><p>Chapter 4</p><p>Gwen</p><p>\u201cCome on, asshole, give me the money shot.\u201d</p><p>I stare through the zoom lens of my camera at Mr. Bradford, standing in the parking lot of a Harley Davidson dealership. Mr. Bradford, a fifty-two-year old foreman at a local car manufacturing plant, \u201cslipped and fell\u201d at work and has been collecting workman\u2019s comp for the last four weeks. Supposedly, the spill he took at work slipped two disks in his back that have been causing him extreme pain. Strange how someone who is supposedly in so much agony that he can no longer work, is thinking about purchasing a motorcycle.</p><p>Under normal circumstances, just buying a motorcycle wouldn\u2019t be cause for alarm, but if this idiot gets on the bike and drives away, he\u2019s toast. While I wait for Mr. Bradford to negotiate with a salesman, I can\u2019t help but think about the previous day at the office. I can\u2019t believe Brady had the nerve to send Austin to keep an eye on me without letting me know. I\u2019m going to kill him. I get where he\u2019s coming from \u2013 he\u2019s been on edge ever since I told him I was filing for divorce, but this really wasn\u2019t the way to go about calming his nerves. If William hasn\u2019t tried to contact me by now, I doubt he ever will. Having Austin under foot every day until Brady gets back is just going to make things worse. I don\u2019t know what it is about him that puts me so on edge and I don\u2019t like it. I don\u2019t like how I want to punch the smug look off of his face one minute and kiss him the next. He\u2019s hot \u2013 there\u2019s no denying that fact. His body looks like it was carved out of stone and my fingers itch to touch the muscles on his chest. These conflicting feelings just piss me off and I can\u2019t help but be a total bitch around him so he\u2019ll just go away and I won\u2019t have to worry about the things I\u2019m feeling. I have no business wanting any man, especially a friend of my brother.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t help but be a little hurt that Austin had no idea I have a child. I just can\u2019t believe that Brady never mentioned it to him. I guess I shouldn\u2019t be all that surprised, since Brady didn\u2019t even know I had a child until I showed up at his apartment a few months ago. Turning my back on him all those years ago when he left for the Navy had hurt him deeply, but I was the one left behind to deal with our parents day in and day out. I was the one they transferred every single expectation onto in Brady\u2019s absence. I wasn\u2019t able to run away like he did, not until I had a child of my own and knew I would do whatever it took to keep her safe.</p><p>I really wasn\u2019t surprised by the look on Austin\u2019s face when Emma ran into the office. Men like him are a dime a dozen. They\u2019re all over you until they find out you\u2019re a single mother and then they head for the hills. And yet, Austin took the time to talk to Emma. I\u2019m sure it was just a ploy to butter me up so I\u2019d agree to let him hang around the office.</p><p>Emma had a million questions for me after we left Austin, and those questions led to questions about her father. Why doesn\u2019t he call or come to visit, does he miss her, can she write him a letter... Ever since I left William, I\u2019ve done nothing but second-guess my decision. Even though he did everything he could to break me, he was always a decent father to Emma. He never laid a hand on her and up until the night I left, he always made sure she was never around when his anger got out of control.</p><p>Maybe enough time has passed... maybe the fact that he isn\u2019t contesting the divorce is proof enough that he\u2019s okay with me leaving him and he can be a part of Emma\u2019s life again. I never wanted to take her away from him, but I didn\u2019t know what else to do. I couldn\u2019t survive one more day with him. I knew if I spent even one more hour in the same house as him, there would be nothing left of me.</p><p>My cell phone rings and without pulling the camera away from my face, I reach blindly into the center console and answer it.</p><p>\u201cHello, Gwendolyn.\u201d</p><p>The sound of my mother\u2019s smooth, cultured voice makes me sit up straighter so I\u2019m not slouching. Even after months of being out of her presence, my automatic response to her voice is still the same.</p><p>\u201cMother, this is a surprise. I didn\u2019t expect to hear from you until next week,\u201d I tell her.</p><p>Even though I skipped town without a word to anyone, and never told my parents where I was going, over the last month or so I reached out to my mother. To say Brady was pissed is an understatement. He didn\u2019t trust them at all. When they found out he wanted to go into the military instead of following in our father\u2019s footsteps of becoming a lawyer, they pretty much disowned him and he hasn\u2019t spoken to them since. As angry as I am with them for pushing me towards William and for never believing my accusations of abuse, they\u2019re still my parents. I needed to at least let them know that Emma and I were alive, even if I couldn\u2019t tell them where we were.</p><p>\u201cI know, but I had some news I wanted to tell you,\u201d my mother answers. \u201cI really think it\u2019s time for you to put an end to this foolishness and come home. There are things happening here that you need to fix.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a reason why my mother and I only speak on the phone every two weeks. I can only handle so much of her guilt and refusal to understand the life I left behind.</p><p>I ignore her demand to come home. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>She sighs into the phone and if I was in the same room with her, I\u2019m sure she would be sitting at the island in the kitchen with her fingers against her temples, like what she has to tell me is causing her a great deal of stress.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry to be the one to tell you this, but William is seeing someone.\u201d</p><p>She pauses dramatically and I\u2019m sure she\u2019s expecting me to burst into tears or rage at the unfairness of it all. Hearing this news, I feel nothing. Absolutely nothing. I\u2019m definitely not sad. If anything, I\u2019m relived. The fact that he\u2019s left me alone all this time makes more sense now.</p><p>\u201cDid you hear me, Gwendolyn? I said, William is dating someone else,\u201d she reiterates.</p><p>\u201cI heard you mother. I\u2019m not really sure what you expect me to say. I\u2019ve filed for divorce. He\u2019s free to date anyone he likes,\u201d I remind her, pulling the camera away from my face and resting my head on the seat back.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve made your point. The two of you had a few problems and you left. Obviously he\u2019s hurting so badly that he needed comfort. It\u2019s time for you to come home and work things out. You need to stop thinking about yourself for once and put your family back together,\u201d she tells me.</p><p>I take a few deep breaths to calm myself before replying. Screaming at my mother will accomplish nothing. No matter how many times I try to explain things to her, she never listens; she never hears me. She\u2019s so in love with the idea of me being married to one of the top surgeons in New York and the prestige that comes with it, she doesn\u2019t even care that her only daughter spent year after year in her own private hell.</p><p>\u201cIf this is how our conversations are going to go each time we speak, then I really don\u2019t see the need to continue putting up with this every other week. You know why I left; you just don\u2019t want to accept it. I\u2019m not coming home, mother. And if you want to continue being in your granddaughter\u2019s life, you\u2019ll respect my wishes and stop trying to make me feel guilty.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I hate using Emma against her, but at this point, it\u2019s the only way to make her see reason.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need to be that way, Gwendolyn. Of course I want to be in Emma\u2019s life and yours as well. I just don\u2019t understand all of this nonsense,\u201d she replies with a sigh.</p><p>\u201cAnd herein lies our problem. Having your husband put you down with his words and his fists for ten years isn\u2019t nonsense. Look, I have to go. I\u2019ll have Emma call you next week.\u201d</p> <p>I end the call before she can say anything else, tossing my cell phone angrily onto the passenger seat and bringing the camera back up to my face. I push my mother\u2019s words out of my mind as I see Mr. Bradford swing his leg over the seat of a brand new Harley. The click of the shutter release echoes through my car as I take over fifty pictures of him starting up the motorcycle, pulling out of the dealership and gunning it top speed down the street.</p><p>Once he\u2019s out of sight, I pull the camera way from my face and quickly scan through the photos. These should be good enough for the plant to take to their lawyer and put an end to their weekly payments to Mr. Bradford. A man with that many problems and in so much pain shouldn\u2019t be able to drive a Harley.</p><p>There\u2019s nothing like the feeling of closing a case. When Brady first asked me to help out at the office, I had no idea what I was doing. Now, I\u2019m out on jobs and doing investigations on my own. William never let me have a job. He was adamant that I stay home and be at his beck and call. Being able to come and go as I please and have a job I love is the best feeling in the world.</p><p>Setting the camera down on the passenger seat, I start up my car and drive a few blocks to the grocery store to pick up a few things before Emma gets home from school. As I walk up and down the aisles, throwing random things into the cart, I stop in my tracks in the soup aisle when something makes the hair stand up on the back of my neck. The overwhelming feeling of being watched fills me and I whip my head around nervously. I\u2019m the only one in the aisle. I shake my head at my foolishness and turn back around, pushing my cart to the next aisle. The feeling of being followed lingers and I rub the goose bumps off of my arms, looking over my shoulder every few minutes as I finish my shopping.</p><p>It\u2019s probably just because of the conversation I had with my mother. Thinking about William always leaves me feeling uneasy. Just because I had to put my whereabouts on the divorce papers, doesn\u2019t mean he would come here and find me. My lawyer assured me that William agreed to the divorce without complaint and said that he would do whatever I asked to make things happen smoothly and without publicity. He knows that at any moment, I could out him to his colleagues as an abuser. His reputation would never recover.</p> <p>Shoving aside the nerves, I load up my car with the bags of groceries and head home to Emma. Another call to my lawyer just to make sure William is still in New York probably wouldn\u2019t hurt.</p><p>Chapter 5</p><p>Austin</p><p>Brady gave me an extra key to his office months ago in case of emergency. I never thought I would be happy to use this thing, but arriving at the dark office an hour before Gwen has its benefits \u2013 like snooping through her files, for instance. Not only do I want to see what kind of jobs Brady has going on right now, I want to see what kind of \u201cpersonal issues\u201d Gwen has. I\u2019m pretty sure she won\u2019t keep a list of said issues in her desk drawer, but you never know.</p><p>My cell phone buzzes, bouncing across the desk and I quickly grab it.</p><p>\u201cHey, asshole, how\u2019s country living?\u201d</p> <p>I laugh when I hear Cole Vargas, the fourth member of our SEAL team, on the other end of the line. Cole took some mandatory time off after our mission in the Dominican last year to heal. We went to the Dominican to help our SEAL brother Garrett rescue the love of his life and his best friend, Parker. She was taken by a nasty son of a bitch and by the time we got to her, she had sustained a shit ton of injuries. While she was in the hospital, she became friends with Olivia, one of her nurses. Cole fell in love with Olivia and they settled down in California where she still works as a nurse.</p><p>Even though he\u2019s living it up with a good woman in Cali, he\u2019s never been the same since our time in the Dominican. Two of his best friends from the Naval Academy were killed right in front of him. He puts up a good front about being happy with his new, slow-paced beach life, but I know better. He\u2019ll never be happy until the people who killed his friends are six feet under. The few times I\u2019ve brought up the subject, he\u2019s bitten my head off, so we both just pretend like it\u2019s not an issue right now. One of these days though, he\u2019s going to explode from keeping all of that shit bottled up.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not eight-thousand degrees in the middle of the desert with a rucksack on my back and an M-16 in my hands, but it will have to do,\u201d I admit with a chuckle.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you gave up a recon mission in Iraq to babysit Brady\u2019s kid sister. Has the state of Tennessee taken a chunk out of your already tiny brain?\u201d</p><p>Ignoring Cole\u2019s barb, I immediately wonder how the hell he knows I was supposed to go to Baghdad, but turned the orders down to take some personal time.</p><p>\u201cCare to tell me how your civilian ass knew about Iraq?\u201d I question as I lean back in Gwen\u2019s chair and kick my feet up on her desk.</p><p>\u201cI may or may not have talked to Risner the other day.\u201d</p><p>Hearing that Cole talked to our Captain is more than a little shocking. Last I knew he wanted to forget about the Navy and just enjoy his woman. I knew it would only be a matter of time before he came back.</p> <p>\u201cAnd what does Olivia have to say about this?\u201d I question.</p><p>Olivia Laferriere is honestly the nicest woman I\u2019ve ever met. She also doesn\u2019t take shit from anyone and can hold her own in a room full of SEALS, but I know she\u2019s the main reason behind Cole\u2019s leave of absence. She doesn\u2019t like the idea of her man going off into the unknown and possibly never coming home.</p><p>\u201cOlivia doesn\u2019t know,\u201d Cole responds after a few quiet moments.</p><p>Well, that explains it.</p><p>\u201cEnough about my shit. Seriously, what the hell are you doing in Tennessee?\u201d</p><p>With a sigh, I explain to Cole about the phone call I received from Brady.</p><p>\u201cHuh, so that\u2019s it? You\u2019re supposed to just sit on your ass and keep an eye on Gwen? Suddenly, sitting here on the deck staring out at the ocean seems like a party compared to what you\u2019re doing,\u201d Cole laughs.</p><p>\u201cFuck you. Speaking of Gwen, what do you know about her?\u201d</p><p>Cole and Brady went to the same high school. It never even occurred to me until now that I probably should have just asked him what the deal was with her. Brady would only tell me what I needed to know and Gwen obviously isn\u2019t going to give up the goods.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t seen her in years. She was a few years younger than us in school so I never hung out with her or anything,\u201d Cole explains. \u201cShe was pretty shy and quiet, blonde hair down to her ass, did whatever her parents told her to do. She married some big wig doctor back in New York and turned into the socialite her mother always wanted her to be.\u201d</p><p>Are we talking about the same person? The Gwen I know has purple and blue streaks in her hair, a nose piercing and a mouth like a trucker. That\u2019s a far cry from being an ass-kissing social climber.</p><p>\u201cI was kind of surprised to hear she skipped town with her kid a few months ago and never told anyone,\u201d Cole continues. \u201cDefinitely not something the Gwen I knew would do.\u201d</p><p>Jesus Christ, what the fuck has Brady gotten me involved in? Even though I want to ask Cole a million questions, something now feels wrong about prying into Gwen\u2019s life without her knowing. I\u2019d much rather have her tell me what the fuck is going on. I end the call with Cole, making him promise to let me know the minute he decides what the hell he\u2019s planning on doing with his life.</p><p>Forty-five minutes later, after sorting through all of the customer files in Gwen\u2019s desk, I\u2019m bored sitting around waiting for her to come to work so I make my way to the back room where I know Brady has a heavy bag hanging from the ceiling and a stack of free weights.</p><p>Wrapping up my hands with some of the boxing tape Brady left on the floor by the weights, I take my frustrations out on the bag, beating the shit out of it until I work up a good sweat. It was good to talk to Cole again, but doing so always brings up bad memories that are better left buried. With every punch to the bag, scenes from the past flash through my mind.</p><p>\u201cVargas, man, they\u2019re dead. We have to leave them.\u201d</p><p>Punch.</p><p>\u201cYou need to pull it together right now. We have to get the fuck out of here!\u201d</p><p>Punch-punch.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t save them. They both took a bullet between the eyes. I\u2019m not about to let that happen to you so get the fuck up and let\u2019s go!\u201d</p><p>Punch-punch-punch.</p><p>Pushing aside the memories, I hit the bag so hard that my hands sting and the muscles in my arms burn, but it doesn\u2019t matter. The pain in my body takes away the pain in my heart from seeing one of my best friends completely lose it in the field, cradling the dead body of one of his friends to him and rocking back and forth in a daze. I need the distraction of being here, helping Brady out so I can forget about how one of the strongest SEALs I\u2019ve ever met broke down and has never been the same since.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you doing?\u201d</p><p>At the sound of Gwen\u2019s angry shout, my arms pause mid-punch. I didn\u2019t even hear her come in. Fuck, I\u2019m losing it. I\u2019m a SEAL, people aren\u2019t supposed to sneak up on me. She\u2019s like a Goddamn ninja.</p><p>\u201cI was working, then I got bored waiting for you,\u201d I tell her, glancing at my watch. \u201cYou\u2019re fifteen minutes late.\u201d</p><p>She slams her purse down on the table by the door and stalks around to the other side of the heavy bag. She\u2019s wearing her usual uniform of jeans and a long-sleeved shirt that hugs her body. Just once I\u2019d like to see her wearing something skimpy that shows a little skin and a lot of cleavage.</p><p>Fuck, I need to get laid.</p><p>\u201cHow the hell did you get in here?\u201d she asks me angrily as I begin unwrapping the tape from my hands.</p><p>I ignore her question. \u201cSo, I\u2019ve been bringing myself up to speed this morning. You got some good shots of Bradford on the Harley.\u201d</p><p>She glares up at me and I smile back.</p><p>\u201cI thought we agreed you were going to leave me alone,\u201d she complains, crossing her arms in front of her.</p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t agree on anything. I smartly kept my mouth shut so you\u2019d stop nagging me. If you\u2019d rather, I could go pick your kid up from school and teach her some new words.\u201d</p><p>She groans in frustration and walks out of the room. Tossing the pile of tape into the trashcan, I follow her out to her desk.</p><p>\u201cDid you go through my files?\u201d she asks in irritation, sorting through the folders on her desk.</p><p>\u201cWell, since I\u2019m going to be working here, I needed to see what you have going on. Don Bradford is a lying sack of shit, April Marcum is a cheating whore and Chris Speedman makes enough money to finally start paying his wife child support.\u201d</p><p>She ignores me, stacking and restacking all of the files since obviously I didn\u2019t put them back as perfectly as she left them, so I continue. \u201cI also checked the calendar. Looks like we have a stakeout later today to catch another cheating spouse. Do you want to drive or should I?\u201d</p><p>Gwen finally stops playing with the files and huffs. \u201cYou\u2019re not going with me.\u201d</p><p>I just smile at her. \u201cFine, I\u2019ll go with you to your hair appointment and make sure you don\u2019t do something stupid like go back to blonde.\u201d</p><p>Oops. I\u2019m not supposed to know that.</p><p>Her head jerks up and she looks at me wide-eyed. \u201cHow the hell do you know I used to be a blonde?\u201d</p><p>I shrug. No sense in telling her Cole spilled some of her secrets. I\u2019d much rather have her assume I\u2019m onto her.</p><p>\u201cJust a hunch. For the record, I like the blue and purple. It\u2019s hot and makes you look like you could kick some ass. You\u2019d look like a Stepford Wife if you were blonde,\u201d I tell her with a laugh, hoping the \u2018wife\u2019 comment will get her to admit something about the poor guy she left behind in New York.</p><p>Her shoulders lose their tension and I actually wonder if she\u2019s letting her guard down. She cocks her head to the side and stares up at me with those gorgeous gray eyes and runs her fingers through her shoulder-length dark hair self-consciously. My dick stands at attention when I think what that hair would feel like skimming across my thighs.</p><p>Oh, hell no! There will be none of that shit going on. Time to douse some cold water on everything.</p><p>\u201cYou do know that it\u2019s my job to find out things, right? I know you ran away from New York with your tail between your legs and have been hiding out here with your brother. What happened? Mommy and Daddy not paying enough attention to you? Or maybe the guy you left behind finally decided you weren\u2019t worth the trouble and kicked you to the curb.\u201d</p><p>The softness in her eyes immediately vanishes and is replaced with hurt. I have a moment of regret for saying what I did, but I don\u2019t have time for this bullshit. We can either keep playing this stupid little game or she can tell me what the fuck is going on and why I\u2019m here instead of out on a mission where there\u2019s real danger.</p><p>Instead of throwing a sarcastic comment my way like she usually does, Gwen turns away from me and heads to the door.</p><p>\u201cI need to run some errands. You can sit at Brady\u2019s desk and go through his files until it\u2019s time to head out and do the tail in a few hours.\u201d</p><p>And just like that, she shuts me down. Guess I probably should have went with my first instinct and continued to grill Cole about her. It would have been much easier than trying to pry the truth out of Gwen. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter 6</p><p>Gwen</p><p>After an hour spent walking around downtown Nashville avoiding Austin for a little bit, I finally decide to suck it up and head back to the office to face him. One minute he\u2019s being a smartass and the next he\u2019s complimenting my hair and making me feel special. And then he goes right back to being a jerk by making that \u2018mommy and daddy\u2019 comment and the dig about my relationship with William. I was stupid to think he wouldn\u2019t look into my background and I could just send him packing. At least he doesn\u2019t know everything. Maybe I should just tell him \u2013 that would certainly shut him up. Tell him how up until the night I left, my husband would only hit me in places where no one could see the bruises; inform him that my parents don\u2019t care what that \u2018poor guy\u2019 put me through, as long as I come back home so they don\u2019t look bad in front of their friends.</p> <p>As much as I want to wipe that smug look off of Austin\u2019s face, I don\u2019t want to see it replaced with pity. Every single day I look at myself in the mirror I worry about what people see, what my daughter sees. I want her to be proud of me for the choices I made and I want to be strong for her. I can\u2019t do that if I\u2019m surrounded by people who feel sorry for me. It\u2019s why I\u2019ve never told Brady everything that happened. Showing up at his place in the middle of the night with a busted jaw, broken ribs and a shattered arm was more than enough truth for him.</p><p>When I\u2019m a block away from the building, my phone vibrates in my hand. Checking the display, I see that it\u2019s Karen.</p><p>Brady introduced me to Karen, who lives across the hall in his apartment building, right after Emma and I moved in. She\u2019s a retired widow in her sixties who raised six children that are now grown and scattered across the country. Emma took to her immediately and Karen jumped at the chance to watch her during the day while Brady and I were working. Most days she refuses to take any money from me and tells me that Emma keeps her young and eases her loneliness and that\u2019s payment enough. Karen was a lifesaver when I was working as a waitress after I first got here and barely had two nickels to rub together.</p><p>\u201cHey Karen, what\u2019s going on? Is Emma okay?\u201d I ask as I wait by the crosswalk for the light to change.</p><p>\u201cHello dear, Emma\u2019s fine. We just got home from an exhausting few hours at the park. Poor thing fell asleep as soon as she sat down on my couch,\u201d Karen tells me with a laugh.</p> <p>The light changes and I look both ways before crossing the street, smiling when I picture Emma talking Karen\u2019s ear off and then crashing mid-sentence.</p><p>\u201cI hate to worry you or anything, but I promised you I would let you know if anything strange happened while Emma was with me,\u201d Karen tells me, all the humor gone from her voice.</p><p>I stop in the middle of the sidewalk, my hand gripping the phone tightly. Karen saw me several times in the hall of our apartment building right after I showed up on Brady\u2019s doorstep in the middle of the night. She saw the bruises and the cast, but never asked any questions. When she agreed to watch Emma a month later, she took my hands in hers and told me that it wouldn\u2019t always be this hard. She told me that she would never pry into my personal life, but if I ever needed someone to talk to she would always be available. As much as I wanted to trust her with my secrets, I just couldn\u2019t. It was hard enough to trust someone else with my daughter. I did, however, tell her to let me know if anything strange ever happened when she was with Emma. It didn\u2019t matter how big or how small, if it seemed off, she was to tell me right away. Karen agreed without question. Each day I get to know her more, it makes me wish my mother could show even half the compassion that Karen does.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d I ask in a shaky voice.</p><p>Karen sighs. \u201cAt first I didn\u2019t think anything of it. Emma was on the swings and I was a few feet away on a bench watching her. After a little while she came running up to me and she told me that there was a man looking at her. When she pointed to where he was, there was no one there. I just chalked it up to her little imagination going wild and sent her back to play. When we were walking home, I noticed a car going real slow down the street past us. I didn\u2019t think anything of it until the car rolled past us again and I realized I had seen the same car parked near the playground when we got there.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t stop my hands from shaking. \u201cDid you see who was driving?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t tell if it was a man or a woman, they were wearing a hat and glasses. I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s the same person Emma saw watching her at the park, but I thought it would be best to tell you,\u201d Karen replies.</p><p>It\u2019s a miracle I can speak without crying, but I manage to thank her and tell her I\u2019ll be home early from work. Right now all I can think about is getting home to my baby and holding her. I hate to do this to Emma, but for the time being, trips to the park are going to have to be put on hold. This could just be a coincidence, but I can\u2019t take that chance.</p><p>I take a few moments to calm my racing heart and, with a deep breath and a lift of my chin, I fling open the door to the office and walk inside, tamping down my nerves over Karen\u2019s phone call and preparing to face whatever Austin throws at me. I stop in my tracks when I see the empty office. The unoccupied room isn\u2019t what makes my heart speed up and my hands shake, though. On the edge of my desk are five coffee mugs from the kitchenette, each one turned so that their handles are facing in the exact same direction. Those mugs weren\u2019t on my desk when I left an hour ago, and even if they were, I would NEVER place them like that next to each other. I feel like a fool for standing here freaking out over a couple of cups, but it\u2019s impossible not to when I think back to one particular day so many years ago...</p><p>As I finished emptying the dishwasher, I walked over to the fridge and pulled out the makings for a sandwich. I figured while William was working from home today I would make him lunch and take it upstairs to him in his office. I flipped on the radio attached to the underside of one of the kitchen cabinets and began to hum along to the music as I made his favorite \u2013 bologna and Swiss with mustard.</p><p>I hadn\u2019t realized that William walked into the kitchen until I heard the crash of a glass breaking against the kitchen counter. I jumped and turned around, dropping the knife covered in mustard to the floor.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is this mess?\u201d William asked, holding the cabinet door next to the microwave open.</p><p>I quickly bent to pick up the knife and tossed it into the sink as I made my way over to him to see what he was so upset about. I stared at the shelves in the cupboard, filled with coffee cups.</p><p>\u201cI-I just emptied the dishwasher, they\u2019re all clean,\u201d I told him softly, confused that maybe a dirty one had gotten in there by mistake.</p> <p>In a flash, his hand was around the back of my neck in a painfully tight grip as he shoved my face closer to the shelves.</p><p>\u201cThe handles aren\u2019t facing out. How many fucking times do I have to tell you that all of the handles should be facing the same way?\u201d he shouts.</p><p>He joked about it once. ONCE when we first got married he asked if it was too much work to turn the coffee mugs around so he could grab the handles. We laughed about it. Right here in this very spot we laughed about his coffee mug OCD and then we made love on the kitchen floor.</p><p>Before I could reply, he shoved me away from him and began turning all of the mugs so that the handles faced the same direction.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I thought you were joking,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>I\u2019m so confused by his actions that I barely had time to react when his hand wrapped around one of the mugs and he turned and hurtled it in my direction. I quickly shielded my face with my hands and the ceramic cup smacked into the top of my hand, hitting me with enough force that I cried out in pain as the cup crashed to the floor in a pile of broken pieces. I bit my lip to stop the tears from falling as I stood in the kitchen in shock and cradled my sore hand to my chest. I stared at William as he turned around all of the coffee mugs in the cabinet so they were in one, uniform row.</p><p>\u201cNext time, don\u2019t be so stupid. The handles should all face the same way.\u201d</p><p>Before I even know what\u2019s happening, I\u2019m stalking across the office and swiping my hand across the top of my desk. The mugs are sent flying to the floor, each one smashing against the tile as I stand there shaking with fury, staring at the mess I just made.</p><p>\u201cJust because you\u2019re pissed at me doesn\u2019t mean you need to take it out on the coffee cups.\u201d</p><p>I whip around and the smile on Austin\u2019s face dies when he sees me.</p><p>\u201cDid you put those on my desk? Why did you put them there like that?\u201d I ask frantically as I turn away from him and begin picking up the shattered pieces.</p><p>I hear him walk up behind me, but I ignore him.</p><p>\u201cThe handles can\u2019t face out, they can\u2019t face out,\u201d I whisper to myself.</p><p>My throat gets tight and I blink back the tears as I pick up every single piece, piling them in my hands and not paying attention to the tiny cuts I\u2019m making on my skin as I clutch tightly to the broken shards.</p><p>I jump when I feel Austin\u2019s hands on my shoulders. \u201cHey, come on, it\u2019s just a couple of cups.\u201d</p><p>His voice is soft and comforting and it should make me feel better, but it doesn\u2019t. I know in my mind I\u2019m not behaving rationally, but I can\u2019t make myself stop. I shrug out of his grasp and quickly stand, dumping the handfuls of glass into the trashcan next to my desk. I stare down at the pile at the bottom of the can in a trance and swipe angrily at a tear that falls down my cheek. When I pull my hand away from my face, the dots of blood on my palm catch my eye. I hold both of my hands up and stare unblinking at the cuts.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do that again, the cups don\u2019t belong like that,\u201d I mutter, watching as a tiny river of blood makes its way down to the edge of my hand.</p><p>Austin is suddenly in front of me with his hands holding gently to my cheeks, lifting my head up to meet his eyes. His face is filled with confusion as he searches my face for answers. \u201cGwen, what the fuck? I didn\u2019t do anything with the cups, I was out getting coffee.\u201d</p><p>I glance over at my desk and see a paper cup from Starbucks sitting on the edge. His hands slide down off my face and he wraps them around both of my wrists, gently pulling me towards him.</p><p>I\u2019m too busy thinking about the past and the memories I wish I could forever erase from my mind forever to worry about him touching me.</p><p>\u201cJesus Christ, you\u2019re bleeding,\u201d he mumbles as he drops one of my hands and wraps his arm around my waist.</p><p>My legs move robotically as he leads me over to the sink against the back wall of the office. He doesn\u2019t say a word as he runs cold water, holding my hands under the steady stream until all the blood has washed down the drain. He silently pulls a towel from the top drawer next to the sink and gently pats both of my hands dry. I watch what he\u2019s doing and have to bite back more tears.</p><p>What the hell is happening to me?</p><p>I can\u2019t do this. I can\u2019t fall apart like this, especially around Austin. I can\u2019t be this weak, pathetic person around him or he\u2019ll just jump right in and take advantage of the situation. I\u2019m not that woman anymore. I don\u2019t fall apart at the drop of a hat and I don\u2019t let people walk all over me. Maybe he put those cups on my desk as a joke, not realizing what it would do to me, or maybe he didn\u2019t. Either way, I can\u2019t let him take care of me like I\u2019m some wounded animal. I\u2019ve fought hard these past couple of months to stop being such an insecure, cowardly person. I can take care of myself.</p><p>Pulling my hands out of his grip, I turn away from him and walk back to my desk.</p><p>\u201cGwen, what the hell just-\u201d</p><p>Cutting him off, I pick up my purse and head towards the door. \u201cIf you\u2019re coming with me, let\u2019s go. I have to be outside the Sunset Motel in twenty minutes if I want to get a good shot of Connor Anderson with his mistress.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m sure he expects an explanation for what just happened, but he isn\u2019t going to get one. I still don\u2019t even understand what the hell happened. Did I freak out over the coffee mugs because that phone call from Karen has got me tied up in knots, wondering if William really isn\u2019t planning to let go of us that easily? What if that was him following Emma and Karen? What if he somehow found out where I work and came in here while Brady was gone to mess with me? It seems absurd that he would go to such lengths, but I wouldn\u2019t put anything past him.</p><p>As I walk out into the afternoon sunshine and head towards my car, I kind of hope Austin will decide to stay at the office instead of going through with this stupid promise of his to Brady to keep an eye on me. I need some time alone to call my lawyer and to clear my head without Austin staring at me like I\u2019m a bug under a microscope.</p><p>Chapter 7</p><p>Austin</p><p>We\u2019ve been sitting outside the Sunset Motel in Gwen\u2019s car for twenty minutes and neither one of us has said a word. She\u2019s pretending like nothing happened, but I\u2019ll be damned if I\u2019m going to keep letting her shut me out. Obviously, my usual charm and finesse isn\u2019t going to work on her; I\u2019m going to have to use another tactic. The only problem? I know next to nothing about communicating with a woman unless we\u2019re naked and I\u2019m telling her to fuck me harder. Coercing someone to talk to me on the job usually involves them being tied to a chair with a gun to their head. Something tells me Gwen wouldn\u2019t respond well to either one of those options.</p><p>What\u2019s that old saying \u2013 you catch more flies with honey or some shit? Maybe if I give a little something of myself she\u2019ll give me something of her. Doesn\u2019t that touchy-feely childhood shit usually work on chicks?</p><p>\u201cThis motel reminds me of one I used to live in when I was thirteen. I bet they even have the same green shag carpet and piss stains on the bathroom floor.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I glance over at her in the passenger seat and she continues to stare out the window at the second floor balcony with her camera resting in her lap.</p><p>\u201cMy foster mom at the time ran the motel,\u201d I continue. \u201cIt was actually the one and only place I ever lived that I kind of liked.\u201d</p><p>She closes her eyes for a second and slowly turns to face me. \u201cYou actually lived in a motel?\u201d</p> <p>I shrug and bend my head down to look through the windshield at the room where Connor Anderson is currently banging his flavor of the week. \u201cFor about a month, until it was time to move on to the next place. I had to help clean the rooms to earn my keep. It\u2019s where I learned all of my stellar housekeeping skills.\u201d</p><p>Leaning back in my seat, I grin at her and she returns the smile. I don\u2019t tell her the part about how I would get smacked upside the head if I didn\u2019t fold the sheets right or how I\u2019d get kicked in the leg if I forgot to put new rolls of toilet paper under the bathroom sinks. No sense in ruining the moment.</p><p>\u201cMy best friend, Ellie Larson, grew up in a foster home, but she stayed with the same family until they eventually adopted her,\u201d Gwen tells me.</p><p>\u201cGood for her. That\u2019s actually pretty rare. Most kids get bounced around, especially if they\u2019re older when they go into the system. I was five, so technically not old, but older than most people wanted. Everyone wants a perfect, tiny baby, not a mouthy kid who craves attention.\u201d</p><p>Gwen rests back against her seat and stares at me. I wonder what she\u2019s thinking. I don\u2019t want her to feel bad for me because I had a shitty childhood. I\u2019m sure she doesn\u2019t know the first thing about growing up with folks who didn\u2019t give a rat\u2019s ass about you and only cared about themselves.</p> <p>\u201cWas it really bad for you? I mean...did people hurt you?\u201d she asks quietly.</p><p>I mirror her pose and lean back in my seat. \u201cNothing I couldn\u2019t handle. For the most part, I learned to stay out of the way and keep quiet and they left me alone.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m actually telling her this shit. Even though I left out all the gory details, I\u2019m still giving her more information than I\u2019ve ever given any woman.</p><p>She studies me intently for a few seconds before shifting her gaze to a spot over my shoulder, unblinking and staring at nothing. \u201cSometimes, even when you\u2019re so quiet you could disappear, that\u2019s when they hurt you the most.\u201d</p><p>She sounds so matter-of-fact that I instantly want to pull her across the seat into my arms and tell her everything will be okay. I don\u2019t like how familiar she sounds with this subject. It makes my gut clench in anger that she\u2019s ever felt even a tiny bit of the pain I did growing up. I\u2019m so shocked by her admission that I sit here in silence like an idiot instead of asking her to explain herself. Too soon the moment is lost and Gwen is blinking out of her daze, quickly pulling her camera up to her eye.</p><p>\u201cThere he is. Mr. Anderson is coming out of his room,\u201d she says aloud, holding the camera steady while pressing the button on the side of it to zoom in.</p> <p>I watch her work, silently snapping a ton of pictures as the guy walks out onto the balcony with his suit jacket draped over one arm. A tall, leggy blonde that is most definitely NOT Mrs. Anderson walks out behind him in a skimpy black cocktail dress. She leans against the doorframe and they exchange a few words before Mr. Anderson leans in, kisses her and grabs her ass.</p><p>\u201cBingo! I got you, you cheating bastard,\u201d Gwen mutters.</p><p>I smile to myself as I watch her face light up with excitement as she continues to take pictures of the ass grab and face-sucking going on right in broad daylight. Gone is the haunted look on her face from moments ago and I realize that Brady was a smart man to put his sister in charge of his business while he was gone. She\u2019s good at what she does and she obviously loves it. It makes me wonder what she did before this \u2013 what kind of job she used to have, what kind of life she used to live. Thanks to Cole I know she was married to a surgeon and the dude probably had a shit ton of money. She probably didn\u2019t need to work, but Gwen doesn\u2019t strike me as the type of person to be a housewife, just sitting around twiddling her thumbs.</p><p>\u201cSo what did you do for a living before you moved here?\u201d I ask as she pulls the camera away and looks at the digital screen.</p><p>She clears her throat uncomfortably and for a minute I think she\u2019s going to ignore me. She takes a while before she answers. \u201cI didn\u2019t work, really. I mean, I was busy; I did a lot of things for charity and stuff like that, but I didn\u2019t have a paying job. God, that makes me sound awful.\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head in irritation as she scrolls through the pictures she just took and, as much as I want to make a comment about her being spoiled, I keep my mouth shut. I\u2019m slowly realizing there\u2019s more to Gwen than I originally thought and I don\u2019t want to ruin the moment by being an asshole.</p><p>Shocker, I know.</p><p>\u201cI realize you don\u2019t have a very high opinion of me and you think I\u2019m a spoiled brat. It\u2019s not like I didn\u2019t want to work. I just... wasn\u2019t able to,\u201d she finishes.</p> <p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t able to? Do you have a wooden leg or a lobotomy I\u2019m unaware of?\u201d I ask with a laugh.</p><p>\u201cHa, ha. You\u2019re hilarious,\u201d she tells me before starting up the car. \u201cWe need to get back to the office so I can print these pictures off and show them to Mrs. Anderson.\u201d</p><p>And just like that, sharing time is over.</p><p>When we get back to the office, while Gwen is busy printing the photos and calling Mrs. Anderson to schedule a meeting, I go outside and pull out my phone. Brady answers on the first ring.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on, is something wrong?\u201d he asks in a worried voice.</p><p>\u201cNo, Mr. World Traveler, nothing is wrong. How\u2019s tour bus life treating you?\u201d I ask as I pace back and forth in front of the building.</p><p>\u201cCramped, shitty food and not a lot of sleep, but it\u2019s good. Layla is doing amazing. Every venue has been sold out,\u201d he tells me with admiration.</p><p>I look through the front window and see Gwen on the phone with her back to me. \u201cListen, I need to ask you something about your sister.\u201d</p><p>Brady is quiet so I quickly continue. \u201cWhat\u2019s the deal with her? You need to tell me why I\u2019m here and what\u2019s really going on. It\u2019s more than her just having a little \u2018personal shit\u2019 and you wanting to make sure your business runs smoothly, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Brady lets out a deep sigh and I wait for his explanation.</p><p>\u201cLook, I\u2019m probably just being a protective older brother and I\u2019m sure she\u2019s pissed at me, but you\u2019re right. It has nothing to do with the business. I know she\u2019s perfectly capable of running that place with her eyes closed,\u201d he admits.</p><p>\u201cSo, what is it? What the fuck is going on with her?\u201d I demand.</p><p>\u201cYou just need to trust me, man. She was... let\u2019s just say she didn\u2019t leave New York under the best circumstances. I don\u2019t know everything, but I know enough. It was bad, Austin, really bad. I\u2019d tell you if I could, but I just can\u2019t do that to her. It\u2019s her story to tell. She\u2019s been through enough and it\u2019s been a long road getting her to trust me again. I can\u2019t betray her by spilling all of her secrets. I\u2019m sure nothing is going to happen while I\u2019m gone, but I\u2019d rather not risk it while I\u2019m so far away.\u201d</p><p>I continue to watch her through the glass, hating the fact that there are so many missing pieces of the puzzle that is Gwen. I\u2019m starting to worry about her and feel bad for her and it\u2019s pissing me off. I don\u2019t have the time or the desire to care about someone, but I\u2019d never go back on a promise.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry, I\u2019m not going anywhere. And hey, thanks for telling me your sister has a kid,\u201d I complain.</p><p>Brady laughs. \u201cSo, you met Emma? Has she made you sing any of Layla\u2019s songs yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, and I\u2019m pretty sure your sister\u2019s not going to let me within ten feet of her again. I added to her college fund within ten seconds of meeting her,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t let Gwen try to tell you that that stupid jar is completely full because of me. She\u2019s got the mouth of a sailor,\u201d Brady admits. \u201cLook, I really appreciate you doing this for me. I know it\u2019s hard when you have no idea what you\u2019re getting into.\u201d</p><p>I end the call on a promise to sing at least one of Layla\u2019s songs to Emma the next time I see her \u2013 and with me still having more questions than answers.</p><p>Chapter 8</p><p>Gwen</p><p>Growing up, every movie or television show I ever watched where a woman was abused always made me shake my head in irritation. Who in their right mind would stick around and put up with that again and again? Didn\u2019t these women have brains in their heads? I knew for a fact that if a man ever laid his hands on me, I would tell him off, kick his ass to the curb and never look back.</p><p>It\u2019s always easy to judge other people when you have no idea what kind of life they live behind closed doors, when you\u2019ve never walked one footstep in their shoes or when you\u2019ve never given your heart to a man you believed when he told you it would never happen again.</p><p>I met William at a charity function my mother was hosting. He had just finished his medical residency and secured a full time position with Mount Sinai hospital. He was the most charming man I had ever met and the first man to make me laugh since my brother left for the Navy when I was sixteen. At twenty-two years old, my parents were starting to pressure me more and more about finding a husband and settling down. Not that I was a wild child or anything like that, but in their eyes, it was high time I find someone so they could impress their friends with a lavish wedding and give them grandchildren they could brag about. Over the years, they tried setting me up with some of their friend\u2019s sons and each one was worse than the last. They were all too much like my shallow parents and I wanted more. I wanted a man who would let me be who I wanted to be and not who my parent\u2019s thought I should be.</p><p>I still remember the night I met him like it was yesterday. I was standing at the bar with a full glass of champagne in my hand wishing I were anywhere but there.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t slouch, Gwendolyn,\u201d my mother scolded out of the corner of her mouth as she smiled and waved at someone she knew across the room.</p><p>I sighed and stood up taller, taking a small sip of my champagne. I wished Brady were here. He would be standing off in the corner making fun of all the pretentious people in the room, our parents included and making me laugh. It\u2019s sad that I can\u2019t even remember the last time I laughed. My life has turned into the movie Groundhog Day \u2013 one day bleeds into the next, the same things over and over until I\u2019m so bored I could cry.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to go find your father and start making the rounds to all the tables. Make sure you smile and thank people for coming,\u201d she told me distractedly as she wandered away.</p><p>It took everything in me not to roll my eyes at her retreating back. I should have told her that I didn\u2019t feel well and stayed home tonight, but then she wouldn\u2019t have been able to parade me around to all of her friends bragging about how I just graduated at the top of my class with a degree in business. A degree I didn\u2019t want, but the only one that would make my parents happy and keep them off my back. I wanted to study social work, but my parents thought it was a frivolous waste and one that wouldn\u2019t make me any money in the future. Just like always, I did as they instructed.</p><p>\u201cIs this the most boring party you\u2019ve ever been to or is it just me?\u201d</p><p>A voice next to me at the bar brought me out of my thoughts. I turned to see a man in a black tux smiling down at me, dimples in each of his cheeks giving him a boyish look. He could be a few years older than me, but his friendly smile and the sparkle in his green eyes made him look younger.</p><p>\u201cWell, my parents are the ones hosting the party, so I think I\u2019m required to say that I\u2019m having a wonderful time,\u201d I replied to him with a smile of my own.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re Beth and Karl\u2019s daughter?\u201d he asked in shock.</p><p>I nodded, taking another sip of my drink.</p><p>\u201cForgive me if this is a little forward, but I had no idea their daughter was so shockingly beautiful,\u201d he told me softly.</p><p>Over the years, I had heard enough trite compliments and pick-up lines from men in my parent\u2019s social circle that I could fill an entire book. But the way this man said it, so honestly and quietly, it didn\u2019t come off as anything but genuine.</p><p>\u201cMy name\u2019s William Stratford the third. I realize that makes me sound like a pompous asshole and I apologize for that. If I don\u2019t tell people I\u2019m the third William Stratford, my father will tell me I\u2019m ungrateful and I\u2019ll have to hang my head in shame. So really, you should just blame him for it,\u201d William said with a laugh.</p><p>He held out his hand for me to shake and when our palms touched, I wanted nothing more than to hold on to him for the rest of the evening. His large, soft hand wrapped around my own small one and my heart skipped a beat.</p><p>\u201cMy name\u2019s Gwen Marshall, but if my mother is around, you\u2019d better call me Gwendolyn or she\u2019ll think you\u2019re a common man who has no social skills,\u201d I informed him.</p><p>William threw his head back and laughed and I couldn\u2019t help but join him. His laughter was infectious and it made me forget for just a moment how much I hated my life.</p><p>\u201cWell, Gwen Marshall, what do you say we defy both of our parents? I\u2019ll let you call me Billy if you let me take you out onto the dance floor and show you my moves.\u201d</p><p>William asked me on a date during our third dance that night at the charity event. I spent the next two years falling madly in love with him and thinking that my life was finally moving in the right direction. He was encouraging of my desire to go back to school for social work, he was thoughtful and romantic and he could always make me smile no matter what kind of day I was having. My parents adored him, mostly because he was quickly becoming one of the most sought after surgeons in New York and his success reflected back on them since we were dating. I didn\u2019t care if they liked him or not; nothing mattered but the fact that, for the first time since my brother left, I\u2019d found a man who understood me and love me for me and not for who my parents were or the amount of money they had. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The first time William hit me, it felt like a dream. The kind where you\u2019re floating above your body and you can see everything that\u2019s happening to you. You try to yell down to yourself and change what\u2019s happening right before your eyes, but your voice isn\u2019t heard. We had been married for six months. Six amazing months where each day was better than the one before it. William honored my parent\u2019s wishes and we didn\u2019t live together until we were husband and wife, much to my annoyance. I didn\u2019t care about anything but spending every waking moment with the man I loved. I couldn\u2019t wait to fall asleep in his arms every night and wake up to his smile. Looking back now, I wonder if I would have seen William\u2019s true nature if we defied my parents and I moved into his home before I walked down the aisle.</p><p>On our six-month wedding anniversary, we got into our first fight. It started off small, something silly where I jokingly teased him about coming home late from work and how dinner had gotten cold. I made an off-hand remark about finding another husband who knew how to tell time. It was meant to be funny, meant to make him roll his eyes and kiss me on the tip of my nose as he liked to do and laughingly tell me he would never be late again. I remember smiling at him, waiting for him to join me and being completely unprepared for the sting of his palm against my cheek.</p><p>Tears of shock rolled down my face and he immediately started crying right along with me, pulling me into his arms, kissing the tears away and telling me he would rather die than hurt me ever again. I was more in shock at seeing this confident, strong man fall apart in front of me than having him hit me and I immediately forgave him.</p> <p>I was such a fool.</p><p>As I open the door to the apartment we share with Brady, Emma drops her book bag in the middle of the floor and races off to her room. When I hear the door close and I\u2019m sure she can\u2019t hear me, I drop the mail on the kitchen counter and pull out my cell phone. After a few rings, my lawyer, Michelle, answers.</p><p>\u201cGwen, I was just about to call you,\u201d she tells me.</p><p>\u201cReally? I\u2019ve been meaning to call you for a few days, but I\u2019ve been busy,\u201d I tell her as I sort through the pile of mail. \u201cDo you know if William is still in New York?\u201d</p><p>I feel stupid asking her this, but I trust Michelle. I spoke to five lawyers before I decided to use her. Each one told me I should immediately go back to New York and handle things the proper way. They told me I was making a mistake by running and that it would only cause problems in the long run. I knew they were right, but I didn\u2019t care. The only thing I cared about was keeping Emma safe. The first time I talked to Michelle, she told me to stay put and she would take care of everything. She confided in me that she was in an abusive relationship when she was younger and she knew exactly what I was going through.</p> <p>\u201cAs far as I know he is, but I can check for you. Why, did something happen? Do you need me to fly out there? Now that your location has been disclosed, we can file a restraining order. Do you want me to call the police?\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t help but laugh at her exuberance. \u201cCalm down there, bulldog. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s nothing, probably just my overactive imagination. I\u2019d feel better knowing he was where he\u2019s supposed to be though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDone. I\u2019ll call his lawyer as soon as we hang up. Oh, the reason why I was going to call you \u2013 a friend of yours contacted me. She wanted to get in touch with you, but I didn\u2019t want to give her your new cell phone number until I made sure it was okay. Her name is Ellie Larson.\u201d</p><p>I smile as soon as I hear the name. Leaving William also meant leaving my best friend behind. Someone who knew some of what I was going through and finally convinced me to leave him. I knew I wouldn\u2019t be able to have any contact with her until I could figure out what to do, but it didn\u2019t make it any easier. Ellie has always been my rock and I\u2019ve missed her.</p><p>I tell Michelle to go ahead and give her my number and hang up the phone feeling a little less crazy about what\u2019s been happening lately. I sort through the mail and stare curiously at a letter addressed to Emma. Brady promised her he\u2019d send her a post card from each city he visited and so far she\u2019s received seven. He must have decided to send something else this time. Tearing open the sealed envelope, I pull out the pink, folded piece of construction paper and open it up.</p><p>I let out a gasp when I see what\u2019s on it. The paper slips from my hand and flutters to the floor. I immediately race down the hallway to Emma\u2019s room, shouting her name in fear as I go. I\u2019m now certain that none of this is my imagination.</p> <p>Chapter 9</p><p>Austin</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t ask you this if I had any other option, but I\u2019m stuck. Emma\u2019s babysitter is out of town visiting family for the weekend. It will only be for a few hours.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m probably going to regret this, but having Gwen actually ask me for a favor is too good to turn down. Even if it means I have to be alone with a kid all night.</p><p>Gwen bites the nail of her thumb nervously and I reach out, pulling her finger from her mouth. \u201cIt\u2019s fine, I can do it, no big deal.\u201d</p><p>She smiles at me and it feels like someone punched me in the gut. Fucking hell! Why does she have to be so God damn good looking and vulnerable when she smiles? I\u2019m such a pussy.</p><p>\u201cSo, what\u2019s the deal? Do you have a hot date or something?\u201d I ask, pretending like just uttering those words doesn\u2019t make me want to punch a wall. What do I care if she has a date? I don\u2019t even like her.</p><p>Fuck.</p> <p>\u201cHardly. Remember that friend of mine I told you about, Ellie Larson? She\u2019s in town and we\u2019re going to dinner. I\u2019d normally take Emma with me but I don\u2019t want her out that late,\u201d Gwen explains.</p><p>\u201cDo I need to like, feed the kid or take her on a walk or some shit?\u201d I ask in a panic.</p><p>Gwen laughs and shakes her head at me. \u201cI\u2019ll make sure she\u2019s fed and walked before you come over. You do realize she\u2019s a human and not a puppy, right?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m starting to think this might not be a good idea. What the hell do I know about kids? What if she starts crying or something?</p><p>Gwen reaches out and rests her hand on my arm. \u201cAll you have to do is sit there and make sure she doesn\u2019t start any fires or run with scissors. I\u2019m pretty sure you can handle it.\u201d</p><p>My gaze shifts from her face to the spot where her hand is touching me. It\u2019s soft and warm and I suddenly wonder what it would feel like wrapped around my dick. I think about that hand sliding down the front of my pants and her tongue darting out to wet her lips. Without even thinking about what I\u2019m doing, I step closer to her until I can feel the heat of her body against mine. Her hand digs into my bicep as if she\u2019s trying to hold me in place and her mouth drops open, her breath coming out a little faster. Her lips are full and beautiful and I bet they taste even better. I can feel her breasts pressed against my chest and I want to slip my hand under her shirt and feel their fullness in my palm.</p><p>Reaching my hand up, I brush her hair off of one shoulder with the tips of my fingers just so I can touch her. Glancing down at the bare skin of her collarbone, I see a scar marking her skin. It\u2019s an old scar, faded and barely visible, but it\u2019s there. It\u2019s a thin line about three inches long that goes from her collarbone over to her shoulder, disappearing under the edge of the shirt. I\u2019ve seen scars like that before; I have scars like this \u2013 all of them the result of being on the receiving end of a knife blade. I stare in fascination at the mark and wonder what the fuck she\u2019s doing with something like this on her body.</p><p>Not being able to help myself, I run my finger back and forth over the scar and ask. \u201cDid you get into a knife fight or something?\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t hide the humor in my voice because the idea of Gwen being in any kind of a fight is funny. Not because she couldn\u2019t handle it, but because whoever decided to fight her probably wouldn\u2019t be breathing topside anymore. She\u2019d kick their ass and make them sorry they ever crossed her path. I\u2019m even a little leery of castration standing this close to her, but I\u2019m too mesmerized by the smoothness of her skin under my fingertips to shield the boys from her imminent wrath.</p><p>Gwen\u2019s eyes blink in confusion and she looks away from me to crane her neck and stare down at the spot on her skin I\u2019m still touching. I watch the softness in her face disappear as she quickly takes a step back from me. Whatever little moment we had going on just a few seconds ago is long gone. She grabs her hair and pulls it back to the front of her shoulder before turning away from me, grabbing her purse and heading for the door.</p><p>\u201cSo, I\u2019ll just see you tonight then at Brady\u2019s apartment? Seven o\u2019clock should be fine.\u201d</p><p>With that, she\u2019s out the door and I\u2019m standing here, my fingers still burning from the feel of her skin, wondering what the fuck just happened.</p><p>Again.</p><p>\u201cCan I put pink lipstick on you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about pink nail polish?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think a pink bow would look really pretty in your hair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Emma huffs and crosses her arms in front of her, so much like her mother it makes me want to laugh. \u201cDon\u2019t you want to do anything fun?\u201d</p><p>Stuffing my hands in the front pockets of my jeans, I glance around her room at the fucking sea of pink. Pink toys, pink blankets, pink stuffed animals \u2013 it looks like a bottle of Pepto exploded and it\u2019s starting to give me hives.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it time for you to go to bed?\u201d I question.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s only seven-thirty.\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd, I don\u2019t go to bed until nine.\u201d</p><p>Jesus Christ. What the hell was I thinking offering to babysit Gwen\u2019s kid? I don\u2019t know how to play with kids. Shit, I didn\u2019t even know how to play when I was a kid. My first foster mother owned a diner put me to work when I was six years old. I had to learn how to wash and dry dishes in kindergarten.</p><p>\u201cUm, how about we play Navy SEAL?\u201d</p><p>She looks at me like I\u2019m crazy. I probably am.</p><p>Getting down on my knees so I\u2019m closer to her level, I look around the room cautiously and speak in a low voice. \u201cThat Barbie over there in the pink dress hiding behind the stuffed dog is a high level insurgent. Do we capture or kill, soldier?\u201d</p><p>Emma looks at me with wide eyes for a moment and I wonder if this is the dumbest idea ever. Then, she glances over at the Barbie in question, bends her knees and whispers in my ear. \u201cI think we need to capture her. Make her talk.\u201d</p><p>Stifling a laugh, I quickly shuffle on my knees over to the edge of her bed, motioning for her to follow with my hand. She runs up behind me and we both peek around the corner of her frilly pink comforter.</p><p>\u201cWhat do we do now?\u201d she whispers from behind me, resting her small hands on my shoulders.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t want to spook her. We take this nice and slow and you don\u2019t make a move until I say so,\u201d I tell her, looking over my shoulder at her.</p><p>She nods, a fierce look of concentration on her face.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to need weapons. She looks like a fighter. Did you bring weapons, soldier?\u201d</p><p>Emma quickly grabs a stuffed alligator from off of her bed. Naturally it\u2019s pink. \u201cI\u2019ve got this alligator. Her name\u2019s Ally and she bites.\u201d</p><p>I nod my head and motion for her to go in front of me. \u201cYou go in first with the gator. Tell her we don\u2019t negotiate with terrorists who wear pink.\u201d</p><p>My eyelids are so fucking heavy it feels like bricks are attached to them. Who knew an hour and a half of playing Navy SEAL with a six-year-old could be so exhausting?</p><p>\u201cHey, Mr. Austin?\u201d</p><p>I struggle to open my eyes when I hear Emma\u2019s sleepy voice and I lift my head from the back of the couch to look down at her, curled up next to me with her head resting against my side.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up pipsqueak?\u201d</p><p>She looks up at me and yawns. \u201cDo you know my daddy?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m suddenly wide awake and I sit up a little straighter, careful not to jostle her too much. \u201cUm, no. I don\u2019t know your daddy. Is he nice?\u201d</p><p>She yawns again, looking away from me to burrow closer into my side. \u201cHe always bought me presents. And he called me princess. But he wasn\u2019t nice to mommy.\u201d</p><p>Uneasiness ripples through my body at her softly spoken words. \u201cWhat do you mean he wasn\u2019t nice to mommy?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m probably the biggest dick in the world for questioning a child, but right now I don\u2019t care. I need info on Gwen and Emma\u2019s sleepy ramblings seem to be just the place to get it. For some reason, I naturally assumed Gwen left New York because of her parents, just like Brady did. Obviously, I was wrong.</p><p>Emma is quiet for a few minutes and I assume she\u2019s fallen asleep, but she mumbles into my side. \u201cHe yelled a lot. He called her bad names. If we would have had a swear jar then, he would have had to put a whole lot of money in it.\u201d</p><p>I swallow thickly, resting my palm on top of her head.</p><p>\u201cI miss my daddy, but he made mommy cry. I don\u2019t want my mommy to cry anymore,\u201d she admits softly right before she falls asleep.</p><p>Reaching for the blanket draped over the back of the couch, I gently pull it down and cover Emma with it. My head drops to the back of the couch and I stare up at the ceiling, things slowly clicking into place in my addled brain. Gwen not having any contact with Brady for years, her showing up at his place in the middle of the night a few months ago, the \u2018personal stuff\u2019 she\u2019s got going on in her life, the way she zones out every once in a while and I can tell she\u2019s thinking about something that bothers her, the comment she made in the car the other day about people hurting you... it\u2019s all starting to make sense. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>That motherfucker hurt her. I wonder if Gwen knows how much Emma worries about her. A kid shouldn\u2019t have to worry about someone harming her mother, especially when that someone is her own father. Just the idea of some douchebag making Gwen feel like shit makes me want to find him and beat his sorry ass into the ground. I know she doesn\u2019t want to talk about her past, especially to me, but if Brady was concerned enough to have me come here and keep an eye on her, this asshole could still be a threat. I may not be the type of guy to settle down with a wife and kid, but that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m going to let anything happen to Gwen or her daughter.</p><p>Chapter 10</p><p>Gwen</p> <p>I glance nervously at my watch as I sit in the booth of the restaurant. Not because Ellie is a few minutes late, but because I\u2019m wondering if Austin is surviving being alone with my daughter. I lied when I told him that Karen was out of town for the weekend. After that damn letter that came in the mail the other day, the coffee mug incident and what happened in the park, I wasn\u2019t about to leave Emma home alone without being absolutely certain she would be safe. Karen is sweet and she adores Emma, but she\u2019s no Navy SEAL. As much as Austin clouds my judgment and messes with my mind, I know that there isn\u2019t a better person out there to keep my daughter safe.</p><p>That damn letter \u2013 a crayon drawn picture of a mother, a father and a little girl. It was a crude drawing and, at first glance, I assumed a child had done it \u2013 until I saw the words scribbled at the bottom of the page: Families belong together.</p><p>It was stupid of me to believe that William would just sit back and do nothing after I left, but to stoop to such childish behavior is pathetic. Michelle called me back on the way to the restaurant tonight and she informed me that William has been in New York for the past couple of weeks and his only travel plan coming up is a medical conference in Chicago. That news didn\u2019t sit well with me at all. The coffee mug thing could be chalked up to my over-active imagination, and the person at the park could have just been a stranger, but that letter sure as hell was real. I\u2019m not about to let him do this to me or to Emma. As much as I don\u2019t want to, I\u2019m have to tell Austin what\u2019s going on. He dropped everything to look after us as a favor to my brother, not knowing what kind of a mess he was stepping into. It\u2019s only fair to him that I explain the situation. There\u2019s no way he can truly protect us if he doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s protecting us from. I hate relying on someone else, but I won\u2019t be careless about my daughter\u2019s safety. William\u2019s money and influence are far-reaching and he\u2019s not a man I want to go up against all on my own. It would be a different story if it were only my well being I had to worry about. I would have no problem being my usual stubborn self and handling things on my own, but I have Emma to consider. I\u2019m not about to let my pride get in the way of protecting her.</p><p>The front door to the small restaurant opens and thoughts of William fly from my mind as I see Ellie walk through the door and scan the room. I slowly slide out of the booth and stare at her wide-eyed. She looks so different. The woman walking towards me with a huge smile on her face looks nothing like the woman I left behind in New York. The last time I saw Ellie she had long, brown hair and a few extra pounds around her middle that she\u2019d been complaining about losing for years. She was never one to wear clothing that accentuated any part of her body, choosing instead to be comfortable in t-shirts and jeans. I hardly recognize the woman I\u2019m looking at. She\u2019s easily lost at least twenty pounds and her thin figure and gorgeous curves are accentuated with a form-fitting little black dress. Her normally mousy, brown hair has been dyed honey blonde and hangs down past her shoulders in a shiny, sleek long-layered cut. She looks wonderful.</p><p>She looks exactly like me three months ago.</p> <p>\u201cGwen! Oh my gosh it\u2019s so good to see you!\u201d Ellie exclaims, throwing herself at me and wrapping her arms around me in a tight hug.</p><p>After a few moments, she steps back and I shake my head at her in awe. \u201cEllie Larson, are you sure it\u2019s really you in there? Holy shit, I barely recognized you.\u201d</p><p>She blushes, glancing down at herself. \u201cI know, it\u2019s a big change, huh? And speaking of changes, is your hair blue and purple?\u201d</p><p>I run my fingers through my long wavy hair and laugh. \u201cI figured if I was going to leave my parent\u2019s world behind, I might as well go all out.\u201d</p><p>Ellie laughs and pulls me back in for another hug. \u201cI\u2019ve missed you so much, Gwenny.\u201d</p><p>Her softly whispered words and the nickname she gave me when we were children have me blinking back tears and I squeeze her tightly for a few more seconds before letting her go. We take our seats across from one another and I reach across the table and grab both of her hands.</p> <p>\u201cYou have no idea how happy I was to hear from you, Ellie. I should have gotten in touch with you sooner, but things have been hectic,\u201d I explain.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine, there\u2019s no need to apologize. I\u2019m just glad you\u2019re okay now. You look so good, Gwen. So much better than the last time I saw you. You look happy. Are you happy?\u201d she asks me softly.</p><p>Ellie\u2019s adoptive parents were my parent\u2019s best friends. When Ellie came to live with them when she was four-years-old, we immediately became best friends. She was the only person who knew how much I hated being the daughter of Beth and Karl Marshall. She was the only one who knew that I wanted more out of my life than being a spoiled rich girl who had everything handed to her on a silver platter. She was also the only one who knew the kind of monster William turned into after we were married. She held me when I cried the first time he broke one of my bones and she slept in a chair next to my bed the first time he put me in the hospital. She was my confidant and the closest thing to a sister I\u2019d ever had. Aside from her new look, sitting here with her right now feels just like old times \u2013 like we haven\u2019t been apart from each other for three months. No matter where we are or what we do, it\u2019s good to know we can always pick up right where we left off like no time has passed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m getting there. Hopefully the divorce will be final soon and I can put all of this behind me. I just don\u2019t know what to do about visitation with Emma. It\u2019s so hard to know what the right thing to do is when you have a child caught in the middle,\u201d I admit.</p><p>Ellie lets go of my hands and leans back in her seat, pulling her napkin closer to her and tearing off little pieces. She\u2019s quiet and before I can ask her what\u2019s wrong, the waitress interrupts us and takes our order. After she walks away, Ellie is still nervously shredding her napkin. I reach over and place my hand on top of hers to get her to stop.</p><p>\u201cAlright, talk. What\u2019s going on with you?\u201d</p><p>She sighs and looks up at me with a sad expression on her face. \u201cI didn\u2019t just call you because I missed you. I mean, I do miss you, every single day. But, there\u2019s something else. Something I need to tell you and I\u2019m not sure how you\u2019re going to take it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re referring to the fact that he\u2019s seeing someone now, don\u2019t worry. My mother already beat you to the punch,\u201d I tell her with a laugh.</p> <p>When she doesn\u2019t laugh with me and instead, I see tears forming in her eyes, my smile vanishes and I lean forward. \u201cEllie, you\u2019re starting to scare me. What\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>She picks up what\u2019s left of her napkin and dabs at her eyes. \u201cYou have to promise me that you won\u2019t get upset. Just... hear me out first before you say anything, okay?\u201d</p><p>I nod in confusion, not saying anything. Ellie has always been a sensitive person, always worrying about hurting other people\u2019s feelings. She has a heart of gold and it pains me to see her so upset about something.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s me,\u201d she whispers softly, refusing to look at me.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s you?\u201d</p><p>She swallows thickly, crumpling up the napkin and tossing it on the table in front of her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the one that William is dating.\u201d</p><p>She finally looks up at me and when the tears start falling steadily from her eyes, I know that the look on my face must not be one of understanding.</p><p>Even if I could find the words to say to her right now, I wouldn\u2019t know where to begin. Regardless of the fact that she\u2019s my best friend and he\u2019s still technically my husband, she knows what kind of man he is. She knows what he\u2019s capable of \u2013 she saw the bruises and the scars and the emotional turmoil I spent most of my adult life being swallowed up by.</p><p>\u201cPlease, don\u2019t be mad at me, Gwen. It would kill me if I knew you were mad. I didn\u2019t mean for it to happen, I swear,\u201d she cries.</p><p>I shake my head at her, leaning back in my seat as I try to process the words coming out of her mouth.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not mad, I could never be mad at you. I\u2019m just... I don\u2019t understand. Jesus Christ, Ellie! You know what he\u2019s like. You need to stay away from him,\u201d I demand.</p><p>Being angry at the things William did to me is nothing compared to the rage I feel knowing that he could be doing the exact same things to my best friend. She\u2019s sweet and kind and he knows this. He knows this and he would do everything in his power to take advantage of her good nature. I can\u2019t let that happen, I won\u2019t. He\u2019s already dressed her up like a Barbie doll that resembles the old me, what more is he forcing her to do? Did he put her up to calling me? Did he come with her to Nashville? Does she know about the letter he sent to Emma? I don\u2019t want to believe that Ellie would ever be a part of something that could possibly harm Emma and me, but I also never thought she would get in bed with that bastard after everything she watched him put me through. William obviously knows how much I care about Ellie and he\u2019s decided to get closer to me by using her. It\u2019s sick and disgusting and I can\u2019t believe Ellie doesn\u2019t see it.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t understand, Gwen. He\u2019s different now since you left. He\u2019s changed,\u201d she pleads.</p><p>I scoff and roll my eyes. \u201cSure he has. Just like he swore he\u2019d changed every single time he pushed me down the stairs or broke one of my bones. God dammit, Ellie, you\u2019re smarter than this!\u201d</p><p>She shrinks back into her seat and for a moment I feel awful about the way I\u2019m talking to her, but I can\u2019t stop myself. She needs to see how bad this is. He\u2019s practically turned her into a walking replica of what I used to look like. Why can\u2019t she see this?</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not the same person anymore, Gwen. He got help for his anger issues, he\u2019s calm and he\u2019s a better man now. He wants to be a good father for Emma. He wants you to trust him so he can have her back in his life. If you would just talk to him, you\u2019d see how different he is,\u201d she explains.</p><p>So different that he\u2019s sending creepy, hostile pictures in the mail addressed to his six-year-old daughter and making my best friend come here to plead his case.</p><p>Right now, I can\u2019t even stand to look at Ellie. I\u2019m scared for her and I feel betrayed. It\u2019s more than obvious that William put her up to this and it makes me sick.</p><p>\u201cYou know what, I think I\u2019ve lost my appetite,\u201d I mutter, throwing my own napkin on the table, grabbing my purse and getting up from the table.</p><p>I walk out of the restaurant and away from my best friend, wondering if I\u2019m ever going to be able to trust anyone ever again.</p><p>Chapter 11</p><p>Austin</p><p>The sound of the door opening and closing wakes me up. I glance behind the couch to see Gwen angrily toss her purse onto the kitchen counter and stalk into the kitchen. She flings open the fridge door so hard it bangs against the counter behind it.</p><p>Looks like someone didn\u2019t have a good dinner. Hopefully she\u2019s in a chatty mood because I\u2019ve got some questions for her. I fell asleep on the couch next to Emma thinking about all of the possible things Gwen had went through before she moved here and none of them left me with a good feeling.</p><p>I gently move Emma off of me, get up from the couch and reposition the blanket around her as she sighs and rolls over. A weird feeling tugs at my heart as I watch her tuck her hands under her cheek. She\u2019s so small, so vulnerable and trusting. She\u2019s obviously seen some not-so-good things in her short, six years and yet she\u2019s happy and full of life. She believes without question that the people who love her will take care of her and keep her safe. She deserves to have a childhood without worry and without scars, so unlike my own. I have an unnatural urge to wrap my arms around her and never let her go, make sure nothing ever harms her and protect her at all costs.</p><p>Jesus, what the hell is wrong with me? I am NOT father material. I\u2019m not even uncle material.</p><p>Not liking the direction of my thoughts, I back away from the couch and the sleeping little girl and head towards the kitchen.</p><p>I make it in there just as Gwen closes the fridge door, pops the top off of a bottle of beer and chugs half of it.</p><p>Leaning casually against the doorframe, I lift my eyebrow at her when she turns to face me. \u201cDid they run out of dessert at the restaurant or something?\u201d</p><p>She studies me silently for a few seconds before slamming the bottle down on the counter and charging towards me, determination shining in her eyes.</p><p>I put my hands up in surrender. \u201cI was just kidding about dess-\u201d</p><p>Her hands clutch onto the front of my shirt and she hauls me to her, bringing my lips to hers. When I hold completely still in shock, she takes it further by opening her mouth against mine just enough to glide the tip of her tongue across my bottom lip.</p><p>Every thought in my brain heads south, right to my dick. I forget about the questions I\u2019m determined to make her answer and all of the reasons why this is the worst fucking idea in the entire world. I wrap my arms around her waist and pull her roughly against me, sliding my tongue into her warm, wet mouth and groan as soon as I taste her. Our tongues immediately tangle together, pushing and swirling, vying for dominance as we both drive harder and deeper into one another. She lets go of my shirt, moving her hands up to clutch large chunks of my hair and my palms slide up under the back of her shirt until I feel smooth, warm skin. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>This is such a stupid idea. Everything about this has bad news written all over it, but I can\u2019t bring myself to care. Gwen\u2019s mouth is the sweetest thing I\u2019ve ever tasted and I want more. Without breaking the kiss, I spin her around and press her up against the front of the fridge, one of her legs immediately coming up to hook around the back of my thigh to hold me close. Pushing my tongue deeper, I bend my knees and slide the hard-on straining against the front of my jeans between her legs. I\u2019m always in a state of semi-hardness whenever I\u2019m in the same room with her, but the need that coursed through me as soon as I felt her lips against mine is off the charts.</p><p>She whimpers into my mouth and shifts her hips, sliding herself against me roughly until I\u2019m damn certain I\u2019m going to come in my jeans like a fucking fifteen-year-old. The sounds she makes, the heat from her body and the way she completely lets go with abandon drives me insane.</p><p>I knew from the first moment she called me an ass that kissing her would be like a fiery explosion, neither one of us surviving without getting burned. She\u2019s mouthy and she\u2019s stubborn, but there\u2019s a vulnerability buried deep down inside that makes me want to take care of her, consume her and protect her at all costs.</p> <p>Keeping my hand under her shirt, I slide it around, over her rib cage and move it up until I have her lace covered breast in my hand. Feeling the weight of it in my palm makes my dick throb and I instantly want to bury myself inside of her. Without breaking the kiss, she arches her back slightly, pushing herself against my palm, wanting more. Using the tips of my fingers, I tug the edge of the cup down roughly until her naked breast fills my hand. I run my thumb back and forth over her nipple until I feel it harden, then circle my thumb around it, over and over until I hear her whimper into my mouth again.</p><p>Her hips are still moving against me, faster and harder now. I gently suck her tongue into my mouth, using my thumb and forefinger to pinch her nipple, rolling it between my fingers. I swallow her cries of pleasure, bringing my free hand down to clutch her ass and help her move against me. I want to pull my head back and watch her come. I want to see her face flush with release and her teeth press down into the soft skin of her lip as her orgasm rushes through her. I want to see it all, but I can\u2019t bring myself to stop kissing her. I hold tightly to her ass and help her slide herself against my dick that gets impossibly harder each time she makes a little sound of pleasure in the back of her throat. I continue kneading her breast and sliding against her until I can tell by the way her hands grip tighter to my hair and her hips move faster against my cock that she\u2019s seconds away from coming apart, straining for release.</p><p>\u201cMommy, what are you doing?\u201d</p><p>Gwen and I freeze, our lips separating, but my hands still firmly attached to tits and ass. I would be perfectly fine keeping them there for a little while longer, but she resumes normal brain function much faster than I do and yanks my hand out from under her shirt before shoving me away from her.</p><p>Keeping my back to Emma so that my dick can go back down to non-horny size, Gwen moves around me and rushes over to Emma.</p> <p>\u201cSweetie, you shouldn\u2019t be awake, it\u2019s late. Come here, mommy will put you to bed.\u201d</p><p>Glancing over my shoulder, I watch as Gwen lifts a sleepy Emma into her arms and rushes out of the room without one glance in my direction. Once they\u2019re gone, I let out the breath I\u2019d been holding since Emma\u2019s voice doused a bucket of cold water all over my dick. Moving over to the counter, I rest my palms on top and drop my head down between my shoulders.</p><p>What in the fucking hell was that?</p><p>She comes in here pissed off about something and without even saying anything, drags me up against her and kisses me. Sure, I was an equal participant once the shock wore off, but what the ever-living hell was that? What made her suddenly decide I was worthy of her affection instead of her wrath?</p><p>This woman is going to be the fucking death of me, but I can still taste her on my lips and still feel the soft, heaviness of her breast in the palm of my hand and the only thought in my mind right now is that it sure would be a great fucking way to die. Turning around, I lean back against the counter and stare at the doorway where Gwen disappeared, running baseball stats through my head until I can finally move without my dick feeling like it\u2019s going to explode.</p><p>Gwen comes back in the kitchen a few minutes later and stops in the doorway. Our eyes meet and for a few uncomfortable seconds, I can tell she\u2019s replaying every single moment of what just happened in this room before Emma interrupted us. I watch her cheeks flush and I can\u2019t tell if it\u2019s because she\u2019s getting turned on again or because she\u2019s embarrassed. As much as I want a repeat performance of what just happened, preferably without clothes this time, we need to talk. I need to know about her ex husband and I need to know what kind of a threat he is.</p> <p>\u201cLook, we need to-\u201d</p><p>She immediately cuts me of. \u201cIt\u2019s late and I need to be up early tomorrow. Thanks for watching Emma, I really appreciate it.\u201d</p><p>Without another word, she turns and heads towards the front door. There\u2019s nothing for me to do at this point but follow her. When I walk into the room, she\u2019s standing with the door open, staring down at her feet like they\u2019re the most interesting fucking things in the world.</p><p>I try again to get her to talk to me. \u201cGwen, we really need to talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, it\u2019s been a long night. I\u2019m not really in the mood to rehash things. I was pissed when I got home and that... shouldn\u2019t have happened,\u201d she tells me, gesturing towards the kitchen. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to happen again so let\u2019s just forget about it.\u201d</p><p>You have got to be fucking kidding me.</p><p>I\u2019m not a chick. I don\u2019t need to talk about my feelings and discuss the pros and cons of what we just did in the kitchen. When I have my tongue down some woman\u2019s throat and her tits in my hand, I don\u2019t need to sit down and discuss it. At least we\u2019re on the same page on one thing \u2013 it never should have happened.</p><p>So why the fuck am I so pissed that she\u2019s dismissing me? I need to ask her about her ex, but all I can think about is how nonchalant she seems about what happened.</p> <p>Well, fuck you very much then.</p><p>I don\u2019t like the shit ton of emotions her words are making me feel, not the least of which is rejection, so I lash out at her without even thinking about what I\u2019m saying. \u201cI\u2019d say it was good for me, but... well, it wasn\u2019t. And you don\u2019t have to worry about me repeating that mistake, darlin\u2019. I prefer a woman who isn\u2019t such a fucking tease.\u201d</p><p>Ignoring the pained look on Gwen\u2019s face, I grab the handle of the door and slam it closed on my way out.</p><p>Chapter 12</p><p>Gwen</p><p>\u201cPlease, keep your voice down. Emma might hear you.\u201d</p><p>My pleading fell on deaf ears as William tightened his hold on my arm and roughly yanked me closer to him.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t fucking tell me what to do! Maybe it\u2019s about time our daughter finds out what a slut her mother is,\u201d he shouted, his lips curled back in an angry snarl.</p><p>I used to love those lips. I used to trace my fingertips over them when we would lie in bed at night.</p><p>I stared at his lips as his hand squeezed around my upper arm so hard that I knew there would be a bruise left behind in the shape of his fingers. It wouldn\u2019t be the first time and I knew it wouldn\u2019t be the last. Suddenly, the thought that I would spend the rest of my days walking on eggshells, hiding bruises and wearing clothing that covered scars seemed like a worse fate than dying.</p><p>William shoved me roughly away from him and I stumbled backwards, my feet getting tangled in each other and my hip hitting the corner of his desk.</p><p>\u201cSon of a bitch,\u201d I whispered, wincing in pain.</p><p>The swear slipped passed my lips without conscious thought as I pressed my hand to the tender skin of my hip. William doesn\u2019t like women who swear. I should have been more careful.</p><p>He charged at me and I had just enough time to brace myself for the fist that connected with my cheek. The force of the blow sent my body away from him and I sprawled across the top of his desk, my arms flying out to catch my fall. Medical books, patient records, his laptop and a cup full of pens went crashing to the floor. He hadn\u2019t hit me in the face since that very first time. Too many people questioned what had happened to me and he couldn\u2019t take the chance of anyone finding out. After that, he was careful to inflict his pain only to places where no one would see \u2013 my thighs, my stomach, my back, my arms... so his lack of concern about the bruise that would surely grace my cheek tomorrow scared me to death.</p><p>His hand clutched onto a handful of my long, blonde hair on the back of my head and he dragged me up from the desk, pulling my head back until I stared up into his furious face.</p><p>My cheek throbbed from the punch and I blinked back tears as my hands reached up blindly behind my head to try and get him to let go of me.</p><p>\u201cDoes the guy you\u2019ve been fucking behind my back have a mouth like that?\u201d he questioned angrily.</p><p>\u201cWilliam, there\u2019s no one else, I swear to you,\u201d I sobbed, my tear-filled eyes pleading with him to believe me.</p><p>My arms up, clutching onto his hand at the back of my head, I\u2019d inadvertently left my body wide open for him. His fist slammed into my ribs, stealing the breath from my lungs as a sharp pain shot down my side. His balled up fist connected with the same spot again and again until blackness swam at the edge of my vision and I heard the snap of a rib breaking.</p><p>He shoved me away from him again and I could do nothing but crumple to the floor, the pain in my side so severe that I knew I was going to throw up. Nausea swirled around in my stomach as I held my hands to my ribs, my breath coming out in short bursts, each one sending a fiery burn down the side of my body until I dry heaved.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a liar and a whore. I\u2019ve done everything for you and this is how you repay me?\u201d he shouted, standing above me.</p><p>I wanted to tell him not to yell, that Emma was going to wake up and see what was happening, but I couldn\u2019t form the words. The pain in my ribs was so bad I knew I was going to black out soon.</p><p>I was so busy struggling to breathe face down on the carpet in his office that I didn\u2019t even see him pull his leg back. I didn\u2019t see his dress shoe covered foot coming towards me until I feel the crunch of bone in my bicep.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a fucking tease! No wonder you let someone else screw you.\u201d</p><p>I bolt up in bed, my body covered in sweat and my heart racing. I unconsciously wrap my arms around myself, recalling the pain of broken ribs and blows to my body from that final beating, the last time I ever allowed William to hurt me. Glancing over at the clock on my nightstand, the red glowing lights read three-fifteen and I know I won\u2019t be able to go back to sleep. Austin\u2019s cocky words from earlier that night play on a loop in my head.</p><p>Fucking tease, fucking tease, fucking tease.</p><p>I know he didn\u2019t mean them the same way William did. I know he only said that to me because I pushed him away. I got home from dinner with Ellie and I couldn\u2019t think straight. Overwhelmed by fear and shaken to the core by her betrayal, I just wanted to forget about everything Ellie told me and the clusterfuck my life has become if only for a moment. I used him, never thinking about what I was doing, simply wanting to do something to erase it all. I didn\u2019t want to think about William or Ellie or how betrayed I felt by my best friend. I had no idea that kissing Austin would only fill my mind with more doubt and confusion. I didn\u2019t think I would ever want to be touched by another man ever again, but having his body against mine, feeling his need for me pushing between my legs... it made everything go away until there was only him. I shouldn\u2019t have pushed him away like I did, but I had to. If Emma hadn\u2019t come into the kitchen when she did, I wouldn\u2019t have stopped him from going further. I would have stripped bare for him and he would have seen all of my scars \u2013 physically and mentally. It\u2019s better this way. I\u2019m no good for him or any man. I\u2019m damaged and that\u2019s the way it\u2019s always going to be. Underneath that smart-ass nature is a man who\u2019s passionate, generous, protective and pours himself into something one hundred percent. I don\u2019t have one hundred percent of myself to give anyone other than Emma.</p><p>When I get to the office in a few hours, I\u2019ll tell him everything. He\u2019ll pity me and he look at me like a victim, but at least then he\u2019ll understand why I can\u2019t do this with him or anyone.</p><p>Getting out of bed, I make my way to the bathroom to shower off the sweat and feelings of anxiety the dream left in its wake. When I\u2019m finished, I quietly creep into Emma\u2019s room and gently sit on the edge of her bed. I watch her chest rise and fall with the deep breaths of sleep and I softly run the backs of my fingers down her cheek.</p><p>Every single day since I walked out of the house William and I shared with just one single bag filled with as much of my and Emma\u2019s things that would fit inside of it, I\u2019ve second-guessed my decision. What kind of a mother takes a child away from her father? William always wanted a boy and the disappointment when we found out we were having a girl was evident. He never spent one-on-one time with her, never read her a bedtime story or did any other special things that a father should do with his daughter, but he still loved her in his own way. He hurt me, he bruised me and he broke me. After I left the hospital three days after that night, the only thing I could think about was \u2013 what if he would have killed me? Emma would be alone with him. What if he decided to use her as his punching bag in my absence? I knew if I stayed with him, he would eventually kill me and I couldn\u2019t bear the thought of leaving her at his mercy.</p><p>Emma sighs in her sleep, rolls towards me and burrows her face deeper into her pillow. I bite back tears as I slowly slide into bed next to her and rest my head on her pillow, wrapping my arm around her small body and pulling her closer to me. I breathe in the scent of Johnson\u2019s baby shampoo that lingers in her hair and I remind myself that I did what I had to do. I did what I thought was right to keep my baby safe, and I would do it all over again if I had the chance. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A knock at the door wakes me up at six and I rub the sleep from my eyes, glancing down to see that Emma is still asleep next to me. With a kiss to her head, I carefully get out of bed, closing her door behind me and heading out into the living room.</p><p>Looking out of the peephole, I don\u2019t see anyone there. A feeling of unease washes through me when I think about the letter that came in the mail and how William knows where I am now. Brady\u2019s apartment building is small, but it\u2019s secure. No one can come up to an apartment without being buzzed in first. Feeling like an idiot for being nervous when it\u2019s probably just the super dropping off the rent bill, I slide the chain off of the door and unlock the deadbolt, opening the door slowly.</p><p>Glancing down at the floor in the hallway, my blood runs cold and my hand flies to my mouth to cover up a sob. Standing in a row like little soldiers guarding the door are three crystal vases, overflowing with bunches of purple orchids. Their spicy, vanilla scent fills the hallway, overwhelming my senses until I feel like I might throw up. I quickly slam the door closed, my hands shaking as it takes me three tries to put the chain back on and secure the deadbolt. Once the door is locked, I back away; staring at the door like it will burst open at any moment and my worse nightmare will be standing in front of me. I keep walking backwards until my ass bumps into the wall next to the television and I slide down to the floor, pulling my knees up to my chest and wrapping my arms around them.</p> <p>I used to love purple orchids. Growing up, my mother kept vases of them in every room. It was the one good memory I have of being a little girl \u2013 going to the flower shop with her every Sunday and buying orchids to fill the house. We would pick out the plants with the prettiest blooms and the softest petals and then she would take me to the country club for lunch, just the two of us. She wouldn\u2019t nag me about sitting up straight, minding my manners or acting like a lady. We would talk about the beautiful flowers and how nice the house would smell as soon as we got home.</p><p>My head thumps back against the wall and I squeeze my eye shut to try and keep the tears from falling as I think about how much I loved orchids and Sundays alone with my mother.</p><p>I loved them until my mother told William they were my favorite flower. I loved them until he would buy them for me every time he hurt me as a way to absolve himself from the pain he inflicted, as if a bouquet of flowers could erase what he\u2019d done.</p><p>The smell of the flowers in the hall clings to my nose and my body shakes with the memory of each and every time I received a vase of those flowers.</p><p>Chapter 13</p> <p>Austin</p><p>She\u2019s late for work and she\u2019s not answering her phone. Is this how she \u201cforgets\u201d about what happened between us, by ignoring me and not coming to work?</p><p>That\u2019s just fucking great.</p><p>The office phone has been ringing off of the hook for the last hour and a half and even though I\u2019ve familiarized myself with Brady\u2019s current cases, I don\u2019t know what the fuck I\u2019m supposed to be doing with the new ones that roll in.</p><p>The bell above the door chimes and I look up to see a guy walk in. He\u2019s wearing a black suit and dark sunglasses and his look just screams \u201csecurity guard\u201d. Sliding the glasses off of his face, he looks at me in confusion. \u201cWhere\u2019s Gwen?\u201d</p><p>Ignoring the ringing phone, I shrug. \u201cBeats the fuck out of me. Who are you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDylan Callahan. I\u2019m a friend of Gwen\u2019s,\u201d he tells me with a smile, holding his hand out for me to shake.</p><p>I don\u2019t like the way he says her name, like he\u2019s entirely too familiar with her. It burns a hole in my gut and makes me want to punch the smile right off of his face. God dammit. One kiss from this woman and I already feel like a jealous asshole.</p><p>I begrudgingly grab his hand and shake it, squeezing it a little too hard just because I can. \u201cAustin Conrad. I\u2019m filling in for Brady.\u201d</p><p>He lets go of my hand and shoves his sunglasses into the front pocket of his suit coat. \u201cBrady mentioned something about you being here. I was working as Layla\u2019s body guard before he decided to get his head out of his ass and profess his undying love for her,\u201d Dylan explains with a laugh.</p><p>Now I remember him. Brady told me about how the night he went back for Layla she was about two seconds away from kissing this douche bag. Even though Brady worked out a plan with Dylan ahead of time so he could get some alone time with Layla, Dylan went off the rails a little to make Brady jealous.</p><p>I knew there was a reason I hated this guy on sight.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you need Gwen for?\u201d I ask, getting up from the desk and walking around to the front of it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve known her and Brady since high school. When I told her I was going to be in town, Gwenny told me to stop by so we could catch up.\u201d</p> <p>Gwenny? I\u2019m going to throat punch this motherfucker.</p><p>\u201cWell, she\u2019s not here so you\u2019re date is going to have to wait,\u201d I tell him, not even bothering to hide the irritation in my voice.</p><p>No wonder Gwenny was so gung-ho on forgetting about what happened between us. She\u2019s got this asshole waiting in the wings.</p><p>\u201cWell, can you let her know I stopped by? I\u2019ll be in Nashville for about two weeks, so we\u2019ll have plenty of time to get together,\u201d he informs me, pulling his sunglasses back out of his jacket and sliding them on his face. \u201cShe\u2019s got my number. Just have her call me.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, I\u2019ll get right on that.</p><p>Dylan turns and walks out of the office right when the phone starts ringing again.</p><p>Fuck this shit.</p><p>Grabbing my keys from the desk, I storm out the door, locking it behind me. If Gwenny wants to \u2018catch up\u2019 with Mr. Bodyguard, that\u2019s fine with me. She can get her ass into the office and take her own damn messages.</p><p>I cannot believe I\u2019m actually going back to the \u201cscene of the crime\u201d to tell Gwen her date was looking for her, yet here I am. She was quick to brush off what happened between us and it\u2019s not like I wanted to chat about it either, but now it looks like we\u2019re going to have to do just that if I want to restore some semblance of peace between us so she can get her ass back to work.</p><p>It\u2019s a good thing Brady not only gave me a key to his office, but to his apartment building\u2019s main door and his apartment as well. I\u2019d rather not have to buzz Gwen to let me up because I\u2019m pretty sure she would ignore that as well seeing as she\u2019s ignored the ten messages I\u2019ve already left on her fucking cell phone.</p><p>Stepping off of the elevator, I immediately see three vases of flowers sitting on the floor in front of the apartment door.</p><p>Mother fucking Dylan Callahan.</p><p>I\u2019m guessing the flowers are from him, unless Gwen has a string of other poor schmucks nipping at her heels.</p><p>Ignoring the flowers that I have an unnatural urge to kick down the hall, I bring my hand up to the door and pound on it. When there\u2019s no answer, I do it again and shout through the door. \u201cGwen! Open up!\u201d</p><p>My knock goes unanswered again so I do the mature thing and try yelling again. \u201cGwen, open up the fucking door!\u201d</p><p>Just then, the door across the hall opens and Karen pops her head out. \u201cIs there a problem?\u201d</p><p>I paste a smile on my face and pretend like I wasn\u2019t just about to kick the door down. \u201cJust trying to find Gwen. She didn\u2019t come in to work this morning. Any idea where she is?\u201d</p><p>Karen opens the door a little wider and steps out into the hall. \u201cI was supposed to watch Emma today but she called me earlier and said she didn\u2019t need me. I\u2019m guessing she decided to take the day off and do something with Emma.\u201d</p><p>Thanking Karen for her help, I wait until she goes back into her apartment before pulling the keys back out of my pocket. I saw Gwen\u2019s car downstairs in the parking lot so I know she\u2019s here. What the fuck is going on?</p><p>Unlocking the door, I slowly push it open and step over the flower vases, quietly closing the door behind me. I can hear the faint sound of a television coming from down the hall so I head in that direction. I stop short when I see Gwen sitting on the ground outside one of the bedrooms with her knees pulled up to her, staring at the wall opposite her.</p><p>\u201cWell, hey there, slacker. In case you were wondering, I opened the office today for you and handled all of your calls.\u201d</p><p>She doesn\u2019t acknowledge me, just continues to stare straight ahead. Stepping closer to her, I can see she\u2019s been crying. Her eyes and nose are puffy and red and there are tear tracks marking her cheeks. My thoughts immediately go to Emma and wonder if something happened to her.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Emma?\u201d</p><p>She finally speaks, her mouth quivering as she tries to keep herself from crying. \u201cShe\u2019s in her room, watching a movie.\u201d</p><p>She still doesn\u2019t look at me and her voice is so quiet I have to strain to hear her. Creeping closer, I squat down next to her, brushing some strands of hair off of her cheek that have gotten stuck from her tears.</p><p>\u201cI told her to stay in there. If she\u2019s in there, I know where she is and I know she\u2019s safe.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ve been around enough people who\u2019ve been in a state of shock to know that\u2019s exactly what\u2019s going on with Gwen right now. Something scared her enough for her to hole up in her apartment and not let Emma out of her sight.</p><p>\u201cHey, look at me,\u201d I tell her softly.</p><p>When she doesn\u2019t respond, I reach up and cup her chin in my hand, gently turning her face towards me. When her watery eyes meet mine, I lose my breath and I\u2019m thankful that I\u2019m not standing right now or my knees might have given out. She\u2019s no longer the fighter I\u2019ve been dealing with the past few days; right now she\u2019s scared to death and about two seconds away from breaking.</p><p>Sliding my arms around her waist, I pull her to me. She comes to me without a fight and I flop down on my ass, hauling her into my lap and holding her close. She sits sideways on my thighs, her hands wrapped around my bicep and her face buried in my chest. Leaning back against the wall, I run the palm of my hand down the back of her head and hold her close, listening to the sounds of her quiet sobs, knowing now what it feels like to have a knife jammed right through my heart.</p><p>She cries until she doesn\u2019t have any tears left and I\u2019m thankful that Emma likes movies and hasn\u2019t walked out into the hallway. I don\u2019t know how I\u2019d explain to her why her mother has been crying in my lap, especially after the girl just told me last night that she doesn\u2019t want her mom to cry anymore.</p><p>\u201cTell me what\u2019s going on, Gwen.\u201d</p><p>She pulls her face away from my chest and looks at me, our noses practically touching, her warm breath fanning over my lips.</p><p>Jesus Christ, I\u2019m an asshole. The woman just cried a river in my arms and I\u2019m thinking about kissing her again.</p><p>Without a word, she pushes herself off of my lap, reaching her hand down to help me up. Still clutching my hand as I stand, she turns and heads across the hall, pulling me with her into a bedroom.</p><p>When we get to the dresser, she lets go of my hand to pull open the top drawer, moving aside t-shirts and socks until she gets to the bottom. She pulls out a thick, manila folder, bringing it to her chest and hugging it for a few seconds before turning to face me. I watch as she swallows thickly before handing the file over to me. I take it out of her hands and she walks away from me, over to the bed to sit on the edge. I stare at her for a few seconds as she leans forward, resting her elbows on her knees and her head in her hands. She doesn\u2019t say anything, so I turn away from her and open the folder.</p><p>The full color photo on top steals the breath from my lungs and my heart beats out of my chest. It\u2019s a picture of Gwen \u2013 the old Gwen. Right here in living color is the woman she used to be \u2013 long blonde hair, her gray eyes filled with sadness and pain. The blonde hair isn\u2019t what shocks me though \u2013 it\u2019s the black eye, busted lip and other assorted bruises that mar the beautiful pale skin of her face.</p><p>I glance over at her for an explanation, but she still has her head in her hands, refusing to look at me. I don\u2019t want to look at this file, but I have to. She\u2019s giving me all of the answers, right here in this room and I have to know.</p><p>Turning my face back to the file, I slowly flip through each page. There are at least twenty pictures of Gwen in various states of damage from broken ribs and shattered bones to cuts and slices on several areas of her skin that required stitches. In between the photos are doctor\u2019s notes, detailing each \u201caccident\u201d that ranged from falling down stairs to being mugged. Each page I turn to leaves me feeling sick and furious. My hands are shaking by the time I get to the last page. After what Emma said to me, I just assumed Gwen\u2019s ex was verbally abusive. That alone made me want to kill him, but seeing this file and all of the damage he\u2019d done to her makes me want to tear him limb from limb.</p><p>\u201cMy name was Gwen Stratford.\u201d</p><p>I look up from the file to see Gwen studying me.</p><p>Stratford... each one of these doctor\u2019s notes were signed by Dr. William Stratford. Obviously not a coincidence.</p><p>\u201cJesus Christ,\u201d I mutter, tossing the file on top of the dresser and walking over to her.</p><p>\u201cNo, but he thought he was sometimes,\u201d she tells me with a sad smile.</p><p>The scar that I noticed on her shoulder the other day is once again peeking out from the top edge of her shirt. I move closer to her, reaching my hand out to run my fingertips over top of the mark. She doesn\u2019t move away this time, just closes her eyes and sighs.</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t like the new chairs I bought for the dining room, so he broke one. The piece he hit me with had a nail sticking out of it.\u201d</p><p>I move my hand away from her skin and take a step back, clenching my hands down at my sides. I\u2019m so God damn furious right now I\u2019m afraid of what I\u2019ll do, not the least of which is get in my car and drive to New York to put a bullet in this fucker\u2019s head. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter 14</p><p>Gwen</p><p>Austin has been pacing back and forth in the living room, making quiet phone calls on his cell since I showed him the file. I\u2019ve never shown anyone the contents of that thing, including Brady. I just wanted Austin to understand. I wanted him to see why I\u2019m such a mess and why I pushed him away. That file doesn\u2019t even contain half of the damage done to me over the years, just the worst of it. The night I left, I snuck into William\u2019s office to take some money out of the safe that he kept there for emergency purposes. I never expected to see that file nestled in between money, savings bonds, life insurance policies and our wills. I grabbed the file and shoved it into my bag before I woke Emma up, took her from her bed and fled from the home I\u2019d lived in for ten years. I\u2019ve never looked at the file again after that night. I got to Brady\u2019s and buried it at the bottom of my dresser drawer and pretended like it didn\u2019t exist. I didn\u2019t need to look at it to remember every single photograph and every single doctor\u2019s note. The contents are burned into my brain and I see the scars each time I look in the mirror.</p> <p>When I had to go to the hospital, William would sneak me in through a back door and take me to an unused room in an older part of the hospital. He would stitch me up himself, bandage my cuts or reset my broken bones and put on a cast. The entire time he was doing these things, he would tell me how much he loved me. While he gently poked a needle into my skin to numb the pain or dabbed wounds with gauze, he would tell me stories about the first time he saw me across the crowded room of the charity dinner or the first time he kissed me. He would speak with such love and devotion while he patched up the damage he had done to me. I don\u2019t even remember him ever taking photos while we were in the hospital. The fact that he did, and that he kept them, makes me sick.</p><p>\u201cI just talked to the florist. They have no idea who ordered the flowers. It was a busy day and the order was paid for in cash. They don\u2019t even remember if it was a man or woman who ordered them,\u201d Austin tells me as he shoves his phone in his pocket and sits down next to me on the couch.</p><p>Austin asked if the flowers outside the front door were the reason for my not coming in to work this morning and for the state he found me in when he got here. When I told him how William used to always give me orchids after he hurt me, Austin stormed out into the hall, picked up all three vases at once and chucked them into the garbage disposal shoot at the end of the hall, making sure to keep the card with the name of the florist on it.</p><p>\u201cThose were the ugliest fucking flowers I\u2019ve ever seen anyway,\u201d he told me when he came back into the apartment.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s him. I know it\u2019s him. He\u2019s still supposed to still be in New York,\u201d I mutter to myself on the couch, thinking about the message on the card that read, \u201cI hope these flowers bring back every memory of our time together.\u201d</p> <p>Austin puts his arm around my shoulders and I let myself lean into his comfort for just a few minutes.</p><p>\u201cMaybe he\u2019s not here. He could just have someone doing his dirty work for him. At this point, it\u2019s just a flower delivery and nothing else has happened,\u201d Austin reassures me.</p><p>I close my eyes and bow my head. \u201cIt\u2019s not just the flowers. Other things have happened too,\u201d I admit to him.</p><p>Feeling his arm tighten around me, I look up to see his nostrils flaring and a cold, hard look in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhat else?\u201d he asks through clenched teeth in a low voice.</p><p>I take a deep breath and tell him about the coffee mugs, the park and the drawing. When I\u2019m finished, he pushes up from the couch quickly and starts pacing the room, rubbing the back of his neck with one hand.</p> <p>He suddenly stops and looks at me. \u201cWhy the hell didn\u2019t you tell me any of this before now? I\u2019m supposed to be protecting you. How the fuck am I supposed to do that if you\u2019re not honest with me?\u201d</p><p>Without replying, I get up and walk past him into the kitchen, not wanting to wake Emma up. It\u2019s about to get loud in here and she doesn\u2019t need to hear any of it.</p><p>I hate that he\u2019s angry with me for not telling him what was going on and I hate that it bothers me. This is my life, these were my secrets and now he knows everything. It was hard enough accepting his help at the office, let alone admitting to all of my mistakes. Does he think it\u2019s a piece of cake to admit to someone else what a fool you were and to depend on another person again when everyone else has let you down?</p><p>I walk over to the sink, and rest my hands on the edge, staring down at the drain.</p><p>\u201cYou should have told me,\u201d Austin says from behind me, his voice much more calm than a few minutes ago.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want you to know,\u201d I tell him, turning around to face him.</p><p>He looks at me in confusion. \u201cWhy the hell wouldn\u2019t you want me to know about this? I can help you; I can keep you safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need a hero to come to my fucking rescue!\u201d I tell him indignantly.</p> <p>\u201cI saw what that bastard did to you for all those years and I\u2019m not about to let it happen again,\u201d he argues. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to be a hero, Gwen. This is my job, what I\u2019m trained to do.\u201d</p><p>I ignore the hurt I feel at his words. I don\u2019t want to be just a job to him.</p><p>\u201cGod dammit, don\u2019t you see? I HATE that you had to see that file. I hate that you\u2019re looking at me the way you are right now \u2013 like I\u2019m some weak, pathetic person who waited ten years before finally getting out of that hell. But most of all, I hate that it\u2019s true! I hate myself every fucking day for not leaving sooner,\u201d I admit, tears threatening to fall.</p><p>I dig the heels of my hands into my eyes to keep them at bay before dropping my arms to my sides and continuing. \u201cI hate the person I used to be and I tried so hard to leave her behind. I changed the way I dressed, I changed my hair... I changed everything about myself, but I can\u2019t change the past. I can\u2019t make the memories go away and it scares the hell out of me. I don\u2019t want-\u201d</p><p>Austin\u2019s hands frame my face and his lips are on mine, cutting me off mid-sentence just like I did to him the other night. Unlike that kiss though, this one is soft and slow. He takes his time coaxing my lips open before sliding his tongue gently through my mouth, his thumbs rubbing soothingly back and forth against my cheeks as he holds my face in his hands. I forget everything but the feel of his mouth on me and the way his tongue slowly circles around my own. He makes me forget why I\u2019m scared and he makes me forget why I have to be strong on my own. My hands move up to cover his on either side of my face and I let him take me away with his kiss. I float away to a place where there are no scars and no fear, where I don\u2019t have to look over my shoulder every second of the day and I can be whomever I want. I allow myself to let go and just drink in this man, memorizing the softness of his lips and the taste of his tongue as he works it through my mouth achingly slow.</p><p>Austin stops the kiss all too soon, placing one last soft peck on my lips before pulling his head away, his hands still holding onto my face.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get one thing straight here \u2013 I have never thought you were weak or pathetic and I sure as fuck don\u2019t think so right now. I can\u2019t even imagine half of the shit you went through. I\u2019ve seen SEALS break under a lot less. You did what you had to do for yourself and Emma, and that\u2019s all that matters.\u201d</p><p>Closing my eyes, I lean my head forward and he rests his chin on top.</p><p>\u201cNow, you\u2019re going to stop being so damn stubborn and let me help you. We\u2019re going to track down this bastard and throw his fucking ass in jail.\u201d</p><p>The sound of footsteps on the kitchen tile has me pulling away from Austin to see Emma standing there with a huge smile on her face.</p><p>\u201cOoooh, you said the BIG one. That will be ten dollars, please,\u201d she tells Austin with her hand out.</p><p>I smile for the first time since I opened the apartment door this morning and saw the flowers. Austin sighs, reaching into his back pocket and pulling out his wallet.</p><p>\u201cYou know, pipsqueak, I\u2019m going to be broke before long,\u201d he tells her, smacking a ten dollar bill into her waiting hand.</p><p>Emma shrugs, sticking the money into the front pocket of her pants. \u201cWell then, you should stop saying bad words.\u201d</p><p>Austin laughs and shakes his head at her, bending over and scooping her up into his arms. Emma squeals and begs for mercy as he tickles her.</p><p>The phone on the wall in the kitchen rings and I\u2019m still smiling as I walk over to answer it. \u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s silence on the other end of the line so I try again. \u201cHello? Is anyone there?\u201d</p><p>I turn away from Austin and Emma carrying on over by the door and strain to hear through the line. I think I hear something, so I plug one ear and listen harder.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I can\u2019t hear you. What was that?\u201d</p><p>The sounds of Austin and Emma laughing disappear as I hear the quiet, whispered words on the other end of the line. \u201cYou can\u2019t hide forever.\u201d</p><p>Quickly pulling the receiver away like it\u2019s a snake about ready to strike, I slam it back into its cradle so hard that the base cracks.</p><p>I stare at the phone as I hear Austin speak to Emma. \u201cHey, pipsqueak, how about you go back into your room and pick out a movie for us to watch together, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan we watch The Pretty Pink Princesses?\u201d Emma asks.</p><p>Austin groans. \u201cWhy can\u2019t they be blue or yellow? Fine, Pretty Pink Princesses it is.\u201d</p><p>Emma races out of the room and Austin walks over to me. \u201cWho the hell was that?\u201d</p><p>I wrap my arms around myself and rub away the goose bumps that formed as soon as I heard the whispered words. \u201cI think it was him. I don\u2019t know, I couldn\u2019t tell. He spoke in a whisper and I could barely hear him. He said I couldn\u2019t hide forever.\u201d</p><p>Just repeating the words out loud fills me with fear.</p><p>\u201cSon of a bitch. I\u2019m calling a cop friend of mine that lives in New York. He can find out when this dick left the city and then get me in touch with local law enforcement here in Nashville,\u201d Austin says.</p><p>Just then, the shrill ringing of the phone fills the kitchen once more. I immediately back away from the phone, not wanting anything to do with it now. Austin steps around me, yanks the receiver off the hook and shouts angrily into the phone.</p><p>\u201cI swear to Christ if you call here again you cowardly piece of shit, I will rip out... oh, my bad. Sorry about that, hold on just a second.\u201d</p><p>Austin turns and hands the phone out to me. \u201cSorry, it\u2019s that friend of yours, Ellie.\u201d</p><p>To say I\u2019m in shock is an understatement. I really didn\u2019t expect to hear from Ellie again any time soon after our disastrous meeting at the restaurant the other night. I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m still pissed at her or not. Right now though, I\u2019m scared for her. If William is trying to get to me, she\u2019s going to be caught in the middle and no matter how mad or disappointed I am in her, I don\u2019t want her to get hurt.</p><p>I reach out slowly and take the phone from Austin\u2019s hand and bring it to my ear.</p><p>\u201cEllie, I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d-\u201d</p><p>The sounds of her sobs through the line stop me. \u201cGwen, oh God, I\u2019m so sorry. I don\u2019t know what to do. I never meant for this to happen and now he\u2019s mad. He\u2019s so mad.\u201d</p><p>She starts crying harder and I look up at Austin, not knowing what to do.</p><p>\u201cEllie, calm down. What happened? Where are you?\u201d</p><p>Ellie takes hiccupping breaths and it breaks my heart. \u201cI\u2019m still in Nashville. He followed me here, Gwen. I\u2019m so scared.\u201d</p><p>No matter what happened between us, Ellie is still my oldest and dearest friend. I\u2019m not about to let the same thing happen to her that happened to me.</p><p>\u201cTell me where you are. I\u2019m coming to get you.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 15</p><p>Austin</p><p>I\u2019m getting attached. Son of a bitch, I\u2019m getting attached to these two girls and it\u2019s making me do stupid shit like kiss Gwen again and move her and Emma in with me.</p><p>The kiss can be easily explained away \u2013 I hated the way she was putting herself down. She\u2019s the strongest fucking woman I\u2019ve ever met after the shit she went through and I wasn\u2019t about to stand there and let her think otherwise. It was the only thing I could think to do to get her to stop feeling bad about herself.</p><p>The moving in thing? Well, obviously I had to do it. She and Emma couldn\u2019t stay at Brady\u2019s apartment when that asshole she\u2019s married to knows where she lives and could come after her at any time. It\u2019s not like it means anything or it\u2019s a permanent thing. I live in a rental house; I\u2019m not staying here forever and the girls will go back to their own place when all of this is done and I\u2019ll move on to the next thing. I\u2019m a SEAL; it\u2019s my job to protect people no matter who they are.</p><p>I absolutely do not want a ready-made family and I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll regret having them in my personal space in no time. I like being alone, I\u2019m used to being by myself and not having to answer to anyone and if anything, the two of them with all their girly pink shit all over the place will just make it easier to walk away when this is over.</p><p>Right, keep telling yourself that, buddy.</p><p>\u201cDid you really need to bring all of the Barbies and every single outfit they own?\u201d I ask Emma as she stands each of her dolls up against my couch cushions.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t leave them there, they\u2019d be sad all alone,\u201d Emma explains as she pulls the last doll out of her bag and places her on the coffee table, away from the others.</p><p>\u201cIs there a reason why that Barbie is duct-taped to a Barbie chair?\u201d Gwen asks, coming into the living room after making another call to Ellie.</p><p>Ellie was adamant that Gwen not come and get her. She was afraid for Gwen\u2019s safety and didn\u2019t want her anywhere near the hotel she was staying in just in case William came back. That was fine with me. It\u2019s not like I was going to let Gwen go alone and get her anyway. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I look over at Gwen and pretend like it doesn\u2019t feel right to have her in my place.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s an insurance, mom. Mr. Austin and I were trying to get her to talk,\u201d Emma answers.</p><p>Gwen looks at me in confusion and I laugh. \u201cIt\u2019s insurgent, pipsqueak. And yep, that Barbie went off the rails so we had to take extreme measures.\u201d</p> <p>Gwen shakes her head and I walk towards the kitchen, motioning for her to follow. \u201cWe\u2019ll be right back, pipsqueak. You keep working on Barbie over there and let me know if she gives up the goods.\u201d</p><p>When we get into the kitchen, out of earshot of Emma, I ask her about Ellie. \u201cSo, what\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>Gwen sighs and takes a seat at the table. \u201cShe still won\u2019t let me come and get her right now. She promised me she\u2019d move to another hotel and call me as soon as she got there. I told her to make sure she isn\u2019t followed; take lots of side streets and make a few wrong turns so she can watch in her mirror and make sure he isn\u2019t tailing her. She should be calling me back in a few minutes and then I\u2019m going to get her whether she likes it or not.\u201d</p><p>Folding my arms across my chest, I look down at her. \u201cYou aren\u2019t going anywhere. When she calls back, I\u2019ll go and get her.\u201d</p><p>Gwen opens her mouth to argue and I hold one of my hands up. \u201cNope. Don\u2019t even think about it, darlin\u2019. There is no way in hell I\u2019m letting you go anywhere by yourself when there\u2019s a chance that asshole could be there. He doesn\u2019t know where you are right now and we\u2019re keeping it that way.\u201d</p> <p>Gwen huffs, but she doesn\u2019t argue again, thank God.</p><p>A half hour later, after Emma has turned my living room into her own personal fucking Barbie Dream House, Gwen gets the call from Ellie. She made it to another hotel and she assures Gwen that she wasn\u2019t followed. With my firm instructions to Gwen that she isn\u2019t to open the door for anyone and a sarcastic reply from her that she isn\u2019t stupid, Gwen locks the door behind me and I head out to pick up Ellie.</p><p>On the ride over there, I call my friend on the force in New York.</p><p>\u201cHey, Mark, it\u2019s Austin Conrad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell shit, long time no talk! What are you doing calling me? Shouldn\u2019t you be somewhere in the middle of nowhere being Billy Badass and saving the world?\u201d Mark asks.</p><p>Mark and I went to high school together and we\u2019ve kept in touch over the years, trading favors back and forth.</p> <p>\u201cEh, I\u2019m doing a job for a friend in Nashville right now. Say, I need you to check on someone for me, guy by the name of William Stratford. He\u2019s a doctor in New York City,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know the guy. Well, I\u2019ve heard of him. We don\u2019t actually mingle in the same social circles,\u201d Mark says with a laugh. \u201cStratford\u2019s a big wig surgeon at Mount Sinai, gives a ton of money to charities, even gives a big chunk to the policeman\u2019s ball every year. Good guy, everyone loves him. I\u2019m pretty sure he\u2019s slated for sainthood or some shit.\u201d</p><p>Great. Just fucking great. This abusive douche has fooled everyone.</p><p>\u201cDo you have any contacts with the Nashville police department?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019ve talked to them a couple of times. Why, what\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>I pause, not sure how much I want to tell Mark. I trust him, but I don\u2019t want it getting out that I\u2019m asking about William in case it gets back to him and spooks the guy. I won\u2019t be able to beat his ass if he disappears.</p><p>\u201cI need you to call them and tell them to be on the lookout for Stratford. Tell them he\u2019s not in trouble, he\u2019s just wanted for questioning or some shit. I don\u2019t care what you have to tell them \u2013 just make sure they do it.\u201d</p><p>Mark is silent for a few long seconds. \u201cAustin, what the fuck is going on? And how do you know Stratford is in Nashville?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a long story. I promise I\u2019ll fill you in when I can, just tell me you\u2019ll do this for me.\u201d</p><p>Mark sighs as I pull into the hotel parking lot where Ellie moved. \u201cFine, no problem. But I\u2019m going to catch some slack for this you know. I\u2019m not kidding when I say everyone loves the guy. Money talks around here and he\u2019s one of the biggest contributors to the police force.\u201d</p><p>Of course he is. What better way to get people to look the other way when he beats the shit out of his wife?</p><p>Mark promises to call me back after he\u2019s talked to the Nashville PD and I end the call, sliding out of my car and heading to Ellie\u2019s room. I make sure to check the parking lot for anything suspicious. Luckily, the lot is pretty empty and I don\u2019t see anyone lurking around.</p><p>I walk up to room one-fifteen and knock on the door. \u201cEllie? It\u2019s Austin Conrad.\u201d</p><p>Gwen told Ellie who I was on the phone earlier and let her know I\u2019d be the one coming to get her so she\u2019d be expecting me. A few seconds later, the door is slowly pulled open and a woman with long, blonde hair peeks her head out, glancing nervously behind me into the parking lot.</p><p>She opens the door a little wider and when the sun streams into the room, I get a better look at her face. She\u2019s got a busted, bloody lip and a small cut on her left cheek that\u2019s starting to bruise.</p><p>Mother fucker.</p><p>\u201cDo you need a doctor?\u201d I ask her softly.</p><p>She shakes her head, picking up her purse from the floor and closing and locking the door behind her. She doesn\u2019t say a word to me as we walk out to my car and I have a feeling she\u2019s embarrassed. I think about all of those photos of Gwen in that file and I have to rub at a pain in my chest. Gwen was this person not that long ago. She was bruised and broken, scared to death and not knowing where to turn or who to trust. Thinking about the attitude she has now and the determination and fire in her eyes, I know I\u2019ll do whatever it takes to make sure she never has to go back to being like Ellie is right now.</p><p>The ride back to my place is quiet and I leave Ellie alone, waiting until she\u2019s with Gwen to find out what the hell happened. It\u2019s probably not easy for Ellie to be around some guy she doesn\u2019t know when someone she thought she could trust did that to her face.</p><p>Unlocking the front door, I hold it open and let Ellie walk in first.</p><p>\u201cAunt Ellie!\u201d Emma shouts excitedly, racing across the room and throwing herself against Ellie\u2019s legs.</p><p>\u201cOh my goodness, look how big you\u2019ve gotten!\u201d Ellie tells her, speaking for the first time since I picked her up.</p><p>She lifts Emma into her arms and hugs her tightly. Emma pulls back and looks at her face in confusion. \u201cWhy do you have boo-boos on your face?\u201d</p><p>Ellie places the palm of her hand over the cut on her cheek and smiles at Emma. \u201cOh, I just had a little accident. I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>Gwen steps into the room from the hallway and the two women stare at each other over Emma\u2019s head. I can see the anguish in Gwen\u2019s eyes as she takes in the cut on Ellie\u2019s lip and the quickly forming bruise on her cheek.</p><p>\u201cEmma, baby, why don\u2019t you grab your Barbies and go set them up in your room, okay? Aunt Ellie will come in and visit with you after she and mommy have a chance to talk.\u201d</p><p>Ellie sets Emma down and she races over to the couch, filling her arms with as many dolls as she can carry before running past Gwen to one of the back bedrooms.</p><p>After Emma is gone, Gwen slowly walks up to Ellie. \u201cHe did this to you.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s a statement, not a question. Ellie nods, her eyes filling up with tears. Gwen doesn\u2019t hesitate before pulling her into her arms. \u201cShhh, it\u2019s okay, everything\u2019s going to be okay.\u201d</p><p>Emma wraps her arms around Gwen\u2019s shoulders. \u201cI feel like such a fool. I saw what he did to you for all of those years. I really thought he had changed. I\u2019m so stupid.\u201d</p><p>Gwen pulls back and stares at Ellie. \u201cYou\u2019re not stupid. You thought you could trust him and he took advantage of that. You can\u2019t blame yourself; he\u2019s the one who did something wrong, not you. It\u2019s going to be okay, I promise.\u201d</p><p>Ellie wipes her tears and heads to the back bedroom to play with Emma. When she\u2019s gone, Gwen turns to look at me.</p><p>\u201cI feel so bad for yelling at her the other night at dinner. When she told me she was dating William, I lost it. I should have done more to convince her to stay away from him,\u201d Gwen says sadly.</p><p>I move towards her, wrapping my arms around her and pulling her against me. \u201cI think it\u2019s time for you to start taking your own advice. You can\u2019t blame yourself for the actions of other people. Ellie knew what she was getting into by hanging around William. She made her own choices and there\u2019s nothing you could have said or done that would have made a difference.\u201d</p><p>As I hold onto Gwen and listen to Emma\u2019s laughter coming from down the hall, I realize I\u2019m good and truly fucked.</p><p>Walking away from them is going to be impossible.</p><p>Chapter 16</p><p>Gwen</p><p>Standing in the doorway of Austin\u2019s spare bedroom, I watch silently as Austin lies in bed next to Emma and tells her a bedtime story. It\u2019s an elaborate tale about princesses storming a castle and taking people hostage and I have to smother my laughs so they don\u2019t notice me. Something tugs at my heart watching the two of them together and I\u2019m thankful for the vibration of my cell phone in my pocket that pulls me away from the scene in front of me.</p><p>It\u2019s stupid to get so choked up watching Austin with Emma. The most William ever did with her was pat her on the head or nod distractedly when she told him something.</p><p>Walking out into the living room, I pull my phone from my pocket and answer it.</p><p>\u201cGwendolyn, it\u2019s your father.\u201d</p><p>I haven\u2019t spoken to my father since two weeks before I left William. My mother has made it clear when we\u2019ve talked that he\u2019s very disappointed in my decisions. Hearing his voice right now is strange. I should be happy that he\u2019s finally reaching out to me, but I have a feeling this isn\u2019t going to be a pleasant conversation. For a moment though, I wonder if something happened to my mother. That would probably be the only reason he would ever call me on his own.</p><p>\u201cDad, is everything okay?\u201d I ask nervously.</p><p>Granted, my parents and I don\u2019t have the best relationship, but that doesn\u2019t mean I wouldn\u2019t be upset if something were to happen to one of them.</p><p>\u201cYour mother is fine. That\u2019s not why I\u2019m calling. I received a very troubling call from the chief of police today,\u201d he tells me.</p><p>Closing my eyes, I take a deep breath, knowing exactly what this is about. Austin has been calling some of his contacts all day trying to find out where William is. Looks like news travels fast. I should have warned Austin that my father plays golf with the chief of police.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been told there\u2019s some sort of manhunt going on for William,\u201d my father continues.</p><p>\u201cDad, it\u2019s not a manhunt. We\u2019re just trying to find out where he is, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>My explanation falls on deaf ears.</p><p>\u201cDo you have any idea how embarrassing this is for me, and for William? Chief Jackson called me out of courtesy, figuring I already knew what this is about considering it\u2019s my own daughter who has involved the police in her childish nonsense.\u201d</p><p>I shouldn\u2019t be surprised that my father is still taking William\u2019s side. No matter how many times I tried to go to my parents for help, they didn\u2019t want to listen. They didn\u2019t want to believe that the golden boy they loved more than their own son would be such a monster. It still hurts to hear my father so blatantly dismissive of my problems.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry you think that being abused by your husband for ten years is childish nonsense. But hey, don\u2019t worry about your granddaughter or me; you just keep on worrying about yourself and your fucking reputation. I\u2019ll take care of myself and my daughter on my own, just like I always have,\u201d I fire at him angrily.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t even know you anymore, Gwendolyn. I don\u2019t understand why you would do this; why you would turn into such an angry, foul person. You need to stop this foolishness once and for all. William is a good, hardworking man and he was a wonderful husband and father. He has been absolutely destroyed since you left him, and now this. If this gets out, he\u2019s going to be ruined. His career will be over. Do you really want to do that to him?\u201d</p><p>Gone is the anger I felt coursing through my veins just a moment ago. My father\u2019s words roll right off of me and I suddenly feel nothing. I\u2019m so tired of trying to plead my case with the people who should be supportive of me no matter what. I always thought my parents would stand by me and protect me. And then, one day when I needed them the most, they turned their backs on me. It\u2019s time for me to do the same.</p><p>\u201cGood-bye, dad,\u201d I tell him softly.</p><p>\u201cSo, you\u2019ll call this whole thing off? I knew if I spoke to you myself you\u2019d see reason,\u201d he informs me haughtily.</p><p>\u201cNo, I mean, good-bye. Don\u2019t ever call me again. If you can\u2019t stand up for your own daughter, then you can go to hell.\u201d</p><p>I pull the phone away from my ear and end the call before he can say anything in reply. Tossing my phone on the couch, I head back down the hall to see Austin tiptoeing out of the spare bedroom, pulling the door closed softly behind him.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s out like a light. Who knew little girls would be so excited listening to a story about princesses with AK-47\u2019s and stuffed animals being blown up by RPG\u2019s?\u201d Austin says with a quiet laugh. \u201cI washed the sheets on the bed. You can sleep in there and I\u2019ll take the couch.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head back and forth adamantly. \u201cOh, hell no. You are not sleeping on the couch in your own home. I\u2019m perfectly fine sleeping on the couch or with Emma.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t even my house, it\u2019s a rental,\u201d Austin argues. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cToo bad. I\u2019m not kicking you out of your own room,\u201d I tell him, walking around him to the linen closet at the end of the hall. When he left to drop Ellie back off at her hotel a little while ago, I found that the closet was stocked with pillows and blankets for anyone who rented the place.</p><p>Filling up my arms with two blankets and two pillows, I close the door with my hip and walk past him. Austin shakes his head at me in frustration as I walk by.</p><p>\u201cYou are too damn stubborn for your own good,\u201d he tells me as I turn the corner at the end of the hall and head over to the couch.</p> <p>Emma is a bed hog and I know within ten minutes of getting into bed with her, I\u2019ll be clinging to the edge trying not to fall off, so the couch it is.</p><p>I know I\u2019m stubborn and I like to get my own way. I spent so long doing what everyone else demanded of me that it feels good to put my foot down and do what I want, even if it\u2019s something as silly as sleeping on the couch when there\u2019s a perfectly good bed right down the hall with a very attractive man in it.</p><p>At two in the morning, I\u2019m sorely regretting the idea of sleeping on the couch. It\u2019s hard and uncomfortable and I\u2019ve been tossing and turning since I laid down, but I know that has nothing to do with why sleep is eluding me. The phone call from my father has been playing over and over in my head all night. I tried to block it out, to forget how hurtful his words were, but I couldn\u2019t. Why do I always put my trust in the wrong people? Looking across the dark room and down the hallway, my eyes gradually adjust to the blackness and I see the outline of Austin\u2019s door. Do I trust him? I know that he\u2019ll do whatever he can to keep Emma and me safe. I trust him with our lives, but what about my heart? Every time I\u2019m with him, I feel myself weakening where he\u2019s concerned. I feel myself drawn to him, wanting more and it scares the hell out of me. I\u2019ve grown accustomed to people in my life letting me down. Even Brady, who I trusted more than anyone else in the world, left me alone and he never looked back, never caring enough to find out about my life or the hell I was going through. I understand why he did it; he had to get away and make a clean break, leave before our parents turned him into someone he never wanted to be \u2013 them. Understanding it doesn\u2019t lessen the hurt, but he\u2019s done everything he could to make it up to me and I love him for that.</p><p>Austin is quickly worming his way into my heart and I don\u2019t know what to do about it. I can\u2019t stay away from him no matter how hard I try. The way he kissed me in the kitchen this morning was like nothing I\u2019ve ever felt before. I know he\u2019s not the type of man who would want to settle down with a single mom and I feel like a fool for even entertaining that thought. I don\u2019t want or need another man in my life complicating things, but I\u2019m a grown woman and I have needs that my own fingers just can\u2019t fulfill anymore. I know he wants me; I can see it in his eyes every time he looks at me and I\u2019ve felt the evidence of his need between my legs twice now. Just thinking about the night in Brady\u2019s kitchen when Austin pushed me up against the fridge has a tingle of desire blooming between my legs. Rubbing my thighs together, I think back to just how close I was to coming.</p><p>Sliding my hand underneath the blanket, I press my fingers to my clit over the top of my underwear and close my eyes, remembering the push of his tongue through my mouth and the hardness in his jeans rubbing against me. I touch myself with thoughts of Austin\u2019s hands and Austin\u2019s mouth on me, but after a few minutes, I yank my hand away in frustration. It\u2019s not the same and it\u2019s just not doing it for me.</p> <p>Without thinking about what I\u2019m doing, I fling the blanket off of me and push myself up from the couch. I quickly pad barefoot down the hall wearing nothing but a tank top and my lacy boy shorts, leaving my drawstring yoga pants draped over the arm of the couch. When I get to Austin\u2019s door, I hesitate with my hand on the knob. If I open this door it will change everything. Austin will either turn me down and it will be a huge mistake, or he\u2019ll give me what I\u2019m asking for... and it will still be a huge mistake.</p><p>Fuck it.</p><p>Chapter 17</p><p>Austin</p><p>I can\u2019t sleep.</p><p>And it\u2019s not because I know Gwen is just a few feet away sleeping on my couch, although that doesn\u2019t help. Hanging around a kid lately has made me think about the past. It\u2019s not something I ever willingly think about.</p> <p>Fifteen foster homes by the time I was eighteen and could get the fuck out. Never once did anyone read me a bedtime story, play with me or treat me with anything other than indifference. I look at Emma and think about what Gwen went through and I\u2019m so fucking amazed. Emma is happy and sweet... for a kid. Gwen made sure none of the horrors she went through touched Emma and she got her out of that house before it could.</p><p>I wish someone would have given two shits about me growing up and done something similar. Having Emma sleeping in my spare room and Gwen wandering through the house today makes me want things I never thought I would. It makes me tired of always being alone and never having anyone to come home to after a tiring mission. Gwen would never be satisfied with a man who came and went all the time; she deserves a man who will cherish her and be there for her every step of the way. I\u2019m a fucking idiot for even entertaining these thoughts.</p><p>The click of my bedroom door pulls me away from my pity party and the moonlight streaming in from my bedroom window illuminates the room just enough that I can make out Gwen standing in the doorway. Her legs are bare and the white tank top she\u2019s wearing practically glows in the dark. I can see it hugging tightly to her chest as my eyes take her in from head-to-toe.</p><p>I hold my breath and don\u2019t move, watching her as she quietly closes the door behind her and comes over to the bed. She hesitates for a moment at the edge and I wonder if she\u2019s going to turn and run out of the room. I have no idea what the fuck she\u2019s doing in here, but I can\u2019t form any words to ask her. My tongue is stuck to the roof of my mouth and my dick throbs as I stare at her standing next to my bed wearing practically nothing. I hear her take a deep breath and watch her bite her bottom lip. Slowly, so as not to freak her out, I lift up the edge of the blankets \u2013 a silent invitation for her to join me.</p><p>Gwen quickly slides into bed and turns away from me as I pull the covers up over her. I roll over to my side and slide my arm around her waist, my palm grazing the bare skin of her stomach where her tank top has ridden up.</p><p>She scoots backwards until her ass is nestled right against my dick and her back is pressed up against my front. We lie there like this for several quiet minutes. Right when I start to ask her what\u2019s going on, she presses her palm to the top of my hand and begins pushing it down. I hold my breath as she guides my hand down her taut stomach and stops when I\u2019m cupping the lace and heat between her legs.</p><p>I squeeze my eyes closed and bend my head down until it\u2019s buried in Gwen\u2019s hair. I hold my hand completely still even though it\u2019s killing me not to touch her more, to move her underwear to the side and feel her bare.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I finally whisper.</p> <p>She shifts her hips and presses down harder on my hand. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know anything anymore. I just need to feel something other than scared. I just want to forget about everything for a little while.\u201d</p><p>As much as it pains me, I remove my hand from between her legs and move it to her hip. \u201cWe\u2019re not doing anything just so you can forget what\u2019s going on. When it\u2019s all said and done, all that shit will still be waiting for you to deal with and taking whatever this is between us further is just going to complicate things more.\u201d</p><p>She turns her head on the pillow to look back at me over her shoulder. \u201cStop being so fucking stubborn, Austin.\u201d</p><p>Gwen throws my words back at me and I\u2019d laugh if I weren\u2019t suddenly overcome with the need to hear her say my name again.</p><p>I\u2019m such a fucking pussy when it comes to this woman.</p><p>\u201cI married William right out of college. I\u2019d never had sex with anyone before or after him. I forgot what it\u2019s like to have a man touch me without being afraid of saying or doing the wrong thing.\u201d</p><p>Her quiet admission guts me. How in the fuck can I ever deny her anything? She\u2019s been through hell and back and right now, she just wants me to take it all away. I may not be husband or father material, and I know I\u2019m absolutely not the guy for Gwen, but I can do this. I can give her what she needs right here, right now. I can do this for her and it doesn\u2019t have to mean anything... it can\u2019t.</p><p>Not taking my eyes off of her, I slide my hand back down between her legs, this time, inching my fingers under the lace waistband of her underwear. I watch as her mouth falls open with a gasp when my hand travels lower and my fingers slide through the lips of her pussy. I let out a groan when I feel how wet she is. Sliding my hand back, I let the tips of my fingers circle her clit slowly. Gwen closes her eyes and starts to turn her head away from me and I still my fingers.</p><p>\u201cOpen your eyes and look at me.\u201d</p><p>Gwen blinks her eyes back open and stares at my mouth as I start moving my fingers again. \u201cKeep your eyes on me. When you come, I want you to know it\u2019s me doing this to you.\u201d</p><p>She whimpers as I push my middle finger inside of her and use my thumb to rub her clit. The feel of her coating my fingers and the breathy sounds she makes as I pump my finger in and out of her makes me want to bury myself inside of her. I want to feel that heat wrapped around my cock. I want to feel her pussy throb around me when she loses control.</p><p>Gwen\u2019s arm comes back behind her and she wraps her hand around my neck, pulling me down to her mouth. I add a second finger to the first and easily slide in and out of her, my tongue swirling through her mouth in a matching rhythm.</p><p>Her hips start to move against my hand, pushing me deeper as she rides my fingers and helps me give her pleasure. Right when her breathing picks up and I know she\u2019s seconds away from coming, she pulls her mouth away from me and her free hand clutches onto mine, halting my movements.</p><p>\u201cStop. I don\u2019t want to come without you inside me,\u201d she mumbles, staring up into my eyes.</p><p>Her words shoot right to my dick and I\u2019m so hard right now I feel like I could break fucking glass. This was supposed to be just about her \u2013 giving her pleasure and ignoring whatever fucking needs I might have. She shifts her hips, pushing both of our fingers through her wetness and I\u2019m lost.</p><p>I quickly pull my hand out from under hers and shove my boxer briefs down as far as I can reach, immediately reaching for her lacy underwear and yanking them down her thighs so she can kick them the rest of the way off.</p><p>Gwen brings one of her legs up and hooks it back over my knee, opening herself up to me. I wrap my hand around my cock and guide it between her legs from behind, sliding the tip through her wetness until I find her entrance. I bring my arm back around her waist until my fingers find her clit again, working my fingertips in a circle, around and around and slowly inch my way inside of her.</p><p>She opens her leg wider, her body stretching to fit me while she pants softly as I work my way inside. I take my time, sliding in a little and then pulling back out before pushing in a little further than before, over and over until I\u2019m as deep as I can go.</p><p>\u201cJesus Christ you feel good,\u201d I mutter, bringing my head down to the side of her neck and nipping at her skin.</p><p>She answers me by pulling her hips forward until my cock almost slips out of her and then she quickly pushes her ass back against me until I\u2019m buried deep again, both of us moaning in unison.</p><p>I hold still, knowing if I don\u2019t keep this slow, I\u2019m going to hurt her with the force of my need for her. She\u2019s too hot, too wet and so tight I want to weep like a fucking baby.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d I breathe against her neck as my cock throbs inside of her.</p><p>She turns her head back towards me and kisses me, her tongue darting out to skim across my bottom lip before she whispers against my mouth. \u201cI\u2019d be better if you started moving.\u201d</p><p>Jesus Christ, I love her smart mouth.</p><p>Pushing myself up on my elbow so I can look down at her, I pull my hips back and quickly slam inside her, unable to control myself any longer. My fingers start moving over her clit again as I pump myself in and out of her, over and over until her body is sliding up and down the bed with the force of my thrusts. I know I should slow down; savor this moment and take my time with her, but I can\u2019t.</p><p>I knew fucking her would be the death of me. I want to stay inside of her forever and never come up for air. I want to pound away all of the bullshit baggage we both have until nothing else matters but what we\u2019re doing right now.</p><p>Her hips move against my hand and I use two fingers to rub her clit. I thrust into her body over and over until there\u2019s nothing left of my thoughts but how good it feels to be inside of her. The sounds of our bodies slapping together and Gwen\u2019s low, throaty moans fill the room and turn me on even more. She\u2019s so small and for a moment I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m going to break her in half with the force of my need for her, but her hips move with me, taking everything I have to give.</p><p>Her breath is coming out in gasps and I know she\u2019s close to coming. I thank God for that because I\u2019m not going to be able to hold off much longer. I move my fingers faster and fuck her harder.</p><p>\u201cOh fuck... fuck I\u2019m coming. Austin... oh my God...\u201d</p><p>Her whispered curses against mouth and the way she moans my name pushes me over the edge. She comes against my hand and I start thrusting harder until I explode, my orgasm barreling out of me with the force of a freight train. I come inside of her while her body shakes against me.</p><p>I thrust my hips a few more times, prolonging my release until I collapse behind her, both of us sweaty and panting heavily. When I\u2019m finally able to catch my breath, I pull out of her with a wince, wrapping my arms around her and pulling her back against me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I listen to the sound of her breathing as she drifts off to sleep and the only thought in my mind is that I didn\u2019t use a condom.</p><p>Son of a bitch.</p><p>Chapter 18</p> <p>Gwen</p><p>I awake in bed on my stomach, the feel of a hand skimming down my back. Blinking my eyes open, I stare out the window across from me and see that the sun is just coming up. It takes me a minute to remember where I am, but the ache between my legs brings everything back.</p><p>Turning my head on the pillow, I see Austin sitting up against the headboard. I swallow thickly when I get a look at his bare chest. It was so dark in the room last night that I could barely see him. His chest is smooth and cut with muscles, and there\u2019s a tattoo over his left pec.</p><p>I stare at the words for a few seconds before reading them softly out loud. \u201cAll gave some, but some gave all.\u201d</p><p>Austin\u2019s hand stills on my back and he watches me read the names listed underneath the quote. There are two men\u2019s names \u2013 first and last and their Naval rank.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re job is dangerous.\u201d It\u2019s a statement, not a question. When I realized Brady wasn\u2019t going to volunteer information about his work with the SEALS, I tried asking him a few times but he always changes the subject. I often wondered if he didn\u2019t want to talk because it was top-secret stuff I wasn\u2019t supposed to know about, or if there were things that happened that he didn\u2019t want to remember.</p><p>A cloud passes over Austin\u2019s face and I realize the latter is probably the truth.</p><p>Just as quickly, the haunted look in his eyes is gone, replaced by a lopsided smile. \u201cI\u2019m a SEAL, darlin\u2019. We live for danger.\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes at him and turn over in bed, pulling the sheet up with me as I shuffle up to the headboard next to him. \u201cYou can cut it with the flirting and panty-dropping smile. I\u2019m immune to your charms, Austin Conrad.\u201d</p><p>He chuckles, reaching over and sliding the sheet down until my breasts are exposed to him. He places the palm of his hand over one breast, his thumb moving back and forth over my nipple until it hardens.</p><p>\u201cImmune, huh?\u201d he whispers with a raise of his eyebrow.</p> <p>I swat his hand away, pulling the sheet back up to cover my chest. In the process, I have to lean away from him and my right arm is no longer pushed up against his. Too late I realize that everything that happened between us last night was done under the cover of night. The sun is up now and the light is streaming in through the windows. I quickly try to cover up the scar on my arm with my left hand, but Austin reaches out and stops me.</p><p>\u201cJesus Christ,\u201d he whispers, staring at the long red scar that goes from my elbow up to the mid point of my arm.</p><p>I look away from him, blinking back tears. This is why I should have gone with my gut instinct and not done this with him. I have scars marking so many different parts of my body, but this one is the worst. Each mark on my skin reminds me of what a coward I was for so long and now Austin can see all of them. He told me I wasn\u2019t weak or pathetic, but that was before he saw the evidence that I clearly was. I might as well shatter his illusions for good.</p><p>\u201cThis was from the last night I let him touch me,\u201d I begin quietly, staring down at my hands in my lap. \u201cWilliam was always insecure and jealous, accusing me of sleeping with everyone from one of his fellow surgeons to the UPS man. He called me a whore and a tease and then shattered my Humerus bone in three places. My radial nerve was torn and I had to have surgery to put everything back together, and now I have a wonderful reminder to look at every day of what an idiot I was.\u201d</p><p>Austin places his hand over my arm and rubs his palm up and down the scar that required twenty staples to keep it closed.</p><p>\u201cHow many times do I have to tell you to cut that shit out? Your scars do not define you. They\u2019re a badge of fucking courage and you should be proud of yourself for surviving. You\u2019re still alive, Emma is still alive and as far as I can tell, you\u2019ve done one hell of a job making sure none of this shit touched her. We all have scars, Gwen, some of yours just happen to be on the outside.\u201d</p><p>Leaning my head against the headboard, I reach out and run my fingers over the tattoo on his chest. \u201cIs this one of your scars?\u201d</p><p>I realize suddenly that I don\u2019t know that much about Austin\u2019s past. He\u2019s always so sure of himself and cocky, but I know he\u2019s seen things he wishes he could forget. He\u2019s been to war and he\u2019s been in countries where horrible things happen right in front of you and he\u2019s lost friends that he felt so strongly about he memorialized them on his skin forever. He told me he grew up in foster care and that it wasn\u2019t a picnic, but he never really elaborated. He knows everything about me now \u2013 all of my deep, dark secrets from my past and I barely know anything about him. Why did he join the Navy? What happened to his parents? Why hasn\u2019t he ever settled down and had children? Much to my amazement, he\u2019s been wonderful with Emma. He\u2019s patient with her, makes her laugh and she seems to adore him. There\u2019s more to him than the arrogant smile and cocky attitude and I want to know what made him the person he is.</p> <p>I trace each name on his skin and wait for him to respond. After a few seconds, he mirrors my pose with his head against the headboard and sighs.</p><p>\u201cNo, not a scar, just a way to honor some men who gave their lives without a second thought,\u201d he tells me.</p><p>Austin pulls my hand away from his chest and brings it up to his mouth, flipping it over and kissing my palm before bringing both of our hands back to rest against his warm skin. \u201cThis job, it means everything to me. Those men are my family and there isn\u2019t anything I wouldn\u2019t do for each and every one of them. I can never turn my backs on them and I can never let them down.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s so strong in his convictions that I can\u2019t help but wonder if he\u2019s trying to relay something else through these words. Even though I have no idea what this thing is between us and I have no idea what the future will hold, I would hope that he would know I would never ask him to give up something that important to him. I don\u2019t know if this was a one-time thing or if it\u2019s something more. Hell, I don\u2019t even know if I want something more right now. I know the kind of person he is; I know his job is his life and it doesn\u2019t matter if this thing ends right now or continues on after the mess of my life is cleared up, I would never try to make him into something he\u2019s not. I have too much experience with that to ever do it to someone else.</p><p>Before I can try to put my thoughts into words, Austin\u2019s cell phone rings on the nightstand. He lets go of my hand and reaches over to answer it.</p><p>While I listen to the one-sided conversation, I slip out of bed and fish my underwear out from the foot, buried under the covers. I walk over to the door and slowly open it, listening for sounds of Emma. When I\u2019m certain she\u2019s still asleep, I tiptoe out into the hall and go to the living room, grabbing my yoga pants off of the couch where I left them last night and slide into them. The gentle throbbing between my legs as I slide on my pants brings back memories of everything that happened last night. I\u2019ve never done something that crazy before. I\u2019ve never just thrown caution to the wind and begged a man to give me pleasure. In the beginning, William was the one with experience so he always took the lead when we had sex. After we were married, I lost my voice and all of my desires were pushed aside to make way for what William wanted, what William needed.</p><p>I knew as soon as Austin touched me that something was changing between us and I feel a twinge of insecurity wondering if it\u2019s just one-sided. I was a fool to think I could sleep with him just to scratch an itch. I\u2019m not that person. I\u2019ve only slept with one other man in my entire life and I did it because I loved him. I don\u2019t give myself to anyone easily and I barely gave it a second thought before I did just that with Austin.</p><p>He comes out of the bedroom a few minutes later wearing a pair of jeans and a t-shirt as I finish folding the blankets and stacking them with the pillow on top at the end of the couch.</p><p>\u201cThat was my contact at the police station in New York. He did some digging and found out William was registered for a conference in Chicago, but never showed up. No one has seen or heard from him in a week,\u201d he explains.</p><p>\u201cMy lawyer told me about the conference when I called her to check on his whereabouts after Karen called me that day in the park,\u201d I explain to him. \u201cSomeone is bound to find out something soon. Word is traveling fast over there. My father called last night and wasn\u2019t too happy that the police chief called him and told him I was staging some sort of \u2018manhunt\u2019 for William.\u201d</p><p>Austin curses and shakes his head. \u201cGod dammit, I told Mark to be discreet when he asked around. I\u2019m sorry about that.\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cIt\u2019s fine. I wouldn\u2019t have expected anything less from my father. My parents have never taken my side in any of this. They are convinced that William was a model husband and father and I should put an end to all this nonsense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus Christ,\u201d he mutters. \u201cHow in the hell did you turn out so normal?\u201d</p><p>I laugh and head into the kitchen to see if Austin has the makings for breakfast. Emma is going to be up soon and I want to make her something nice. After that, I\u2019m going to call Ellie to check up on her and try to convince her to stay here with us until William is found.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019d call myself normal,\u201d I tell him, pulling open the fridge. I glance at the contents and I\u2019m surprised to see it\u2019s stocked with food. I figured a single man, especially one who travels for a living, would just have mustard and expired cheese in here. I start pulling out eggs, milk, bacon, orange juice and cheddar cheese, stacking everything on the counter.</p><p>I turn to see Austin staring at me with a weird look on his face.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I ask in confusion.</p><p>He stares for a few seconds longer before shaking his head to clear his thoughts. \u201cNothing. I\u2019m just... I need to make some more phone calls. I\u2019ll be in the bedroom if you need me.\u201d</p><p>Austin turns and walks out of the kitchen and I get busy making omelets, forgetting about the expression on Austin\u2019s face and the way he hurried out of the kitchen and away from me.</p><p>Chapter 19</p><p>Austin</p><p>\u201cOkay, so, you\u2019ve got your 9mm, your .22, your .38 Special, and your .357. You probably can\u2019t handle anything more than that, so take your pick.\u201d</p><p>Crossing my arms in front of me, I take a step back as Gwen looks through the display glass at the firing range for a gun she\u2019ll like. After what happened yesterday, I\u2019m not taking any chances with her safety. Brady will probably kill me for teaching his baby sister how to use a gun, but too fucking bad. I\u2019ve left him a few messages and he hasn\u2019t called me back.</p><p>Given her nasty ass temper, arming Gwen with a weapon probably isn\u2019t the best idea, but I needed a distraction that only the shooting range can provide. I need to erase the picture of Gwen standing in my kitchen pulling the fixings for breakfast out of my fridge like she belonged there. I started thinking about lazy Sunday mornings and curling up on the couch with my two girls while we munched on pancakes.</p><p>And right there\u2019s the fucking problem \u2013 they\u2019re not my girls.</p><p>Even if they were, the lazy Sundays would be few and far between. There would just be two girls sitting at home alone wondering when the fuck I would be coming home from whatever mission I was on.</p><p>Time to think about something else, asshole.</p><p>We\u2019ve been standing in the show room of the gun shop, which is attached to the firing range, for thirty minutes. I\u2019ve gone over each firearm in detail ten times, and if she doesn\u2019t pick one soon, I\u2019m going to stomp my foot and throw a temper tantrum the likes of which even a woman with a kid has never seen.</p><p>\u201cI want a pink one, Austin,\u201d Gwen finally says, looking up from the case and straight at me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, what?\u201d</p><p>She huffs out an irritated breath and mirrors my pose with her arms crossed in front of her.</p><p>\u201cI said, I want a pink one. Where are the pink ones?\u201d</p><p>I bite my lip so I don\u2019t say something completely irrational like, \u201cAre you fucking kidding me with this pink shit? Just pick a fucking gun already!\u201d I take a deep breath and a step closer to her.</p><p>\u201cThis is a gun shop. A place where people come to pick out deadly weapons and then go out back to practice firing at deadly people. Pink does not equal deadly.\u201d</p><p>Gwen takes a step closer to me as well until she\u2019s right up in front of me with her hands on her hips and the subtle smell of her perfume is tickling my nose and making me want to lick her. My mind immediately fills with the sounds of her coming last night until I want to haul her into the closest room like a caveman and fuck her again. Unfortunately, the reminder that I didn\u2019t use a condom overshadows all those wonderful thoughts. I didn\u2019t use a fucking condom. What the hell was I thinking?</p><p>That nothing else mattered right then but getting inside of her.</p><p>Jesus Christ, what if she\u2019s pregnant? Fantasizing about having her and Emma in my life for good is a far cry from it actually happening, and with a screaming baby in tow. It suddenly feels warm in here and I have to wipe a bead of sweat off of my forehead.</p><p>\u201cI. Want. A. Pink. Gun,\u201d she says softly, enunciating each word with a fierce gleam in her eyes.</p><p>She\u2019s so tiny I could scoop her up with one arm and probably carry her in my pocket, but standing here right now, so determined with her hands on her hips and an attitude on her face, she looks ten feet tall. If I don\u2019t give her what she wants, she\u2019s going to find a fucking pink gun and shoot me in the balls with it.</p><p>\u201cHow about we just pick out a nice, shiny, black one for today, and when we\u2019re done, I\u2019ll order you a pink gun. I\u2019ll even order you a pink holster with sparkles on it,\u201d I beg her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Normally, I could spend all day in the gun shop talking weapons with the owner and testing out new items. Using the words \u201cpink\u201d and \u201csparkles\u201d in the same sentence at a fucking gun shop makes me want to puke in my mouth a little.</p><p>\u201cOoooooh, sparkles! Mommy, you should get a gun with sparkles!\u201d</p><p>We both turn and look at Emma standing a few feet away from us, brushing the hair of another damn Barbie in her hand. No matter where I go, I can\u2019t escape the Barbies. It\u2019s like I\u2019m in Barbie hell.</p> <p>\u201cGood idea, baby! Can I get a pink gun with sparkles too?\u201d Gwen asks.</p><p>\u201cJesus H...YES! We can bedazzle any fucking thing in this store you want, just pick one!\u201d I growl at her.</p><p>\u201cPay up, Mr. Austin,\u201d Emma pipes up from right next to me.</p><p>Fucking hell.</p><p>I look down and she\u2019s got her hand out, palm up, waiting for her payment. I pull my wallet out of my back pocket and take out a twenty.</p> <p>\u201cHere, pipsqueak, I have a feeling your mother is going to cost me a lot of money today,\u201d I tell her as she grabs the bill from my hand and shoves it into the front pocket of her jeans.</p><p>\u201cOkay, fine,\u201d Gwen finally says with a sigh. \u201cI guess I\u2019ll take that black and silver one right there.\u201d</p><p>I lean over her shoulder and see that she\u2019s pointing to a Kel-Tec 9mm.</p><p>\u201cGood choice,\u201d I tell her with a nod as I signal the owner so he can get it out of the case.</p><p>Gwen turns her face towards me and our noses are practically touching. I can feel her breath on my face and I know if I don\u2019t move away, I\u2019m going to be hard as a rock in two seconds. This woman drives me fucking insane, but she\u2019s also hot as hell and the strongest person I\u2019ve ever been around considering what her life has been like. Even though I don\u2019t like the direction of my thoughts lately where Gwen\u2019s concerned, there\u2019s nothing this woman does that can\u2019t turn me on.</p><p>\u201cSince I can\u2019t use a pink gun today, can I get a pair of those ear muff thingies in pink for when I\u2019m shooting? And do they have those with sparkles?\u201d</p> <p>I take that back.</p><p>\u201cIf you want to test it out, my wife\u2019s in the back room with a plate of fresh cookies. I\u2019m sure she wouldn\u2019t mind a little company,\u201d the owner tells us, nodding in Emma\u2019s direction.</p><p>Just then, a nice, older woman of about fifty steps out of that room with a warm smile on her face. \u201cI would love some company. I can\u2019t eat all of these cookies by myself.\u201d</p><p>Emma looks up at Gwen with a pleading look on her face.</p><p>\u201cOkay, but just for a few minutes. And not too many cookies or you won\u2019t eat your dinner,\u201d Gwen tells her.</p><p>Emma races around the counter and the woman smiles at Gwen. \u201cWe\u2019ll be right in here when you\u2019re finished, take your time.\u201d</p><p>Gwen thanks her and I grab her new gun off of the counter as well as a box of bullets. With a wink, the owner hands Gwen a pair of pink \u2018ear muff thingies\u2019 and we head out through the back door to the indoor range. I find us an empty booth and walk up to the counter, opening up the box of bullets and loading the gun.</p><p>\u201cThe first time you pull the trigger, it\u2019s going to scare the shit out of you. This gun is small, but it still has a lot of kickback when it fires. Don\u2019t try to aim with the first shot, just pull the trigger and get it over with,\u201d I explain to her as I finish loading the gun and hand it to her after she finishes putting the shooting muffs over her ears.</p> <p>\u201cIs this the trigger thingy?\u201d she asks, pointing to the safety.</p><p>\u201cNo, darlin\u2019. That makes it so you don\u2019t shoot someone in the face by accident,\u201d I tell her in a placating voice.</p><p>This is why I don\u2019t spend a lot of time with chicks after I sleep with them.</p><p>\u201cCan you show me how to hold this thing? I don\u2019t know how I\u2019m supposed to stand,\u201d she complains.</p><p>Walking behind her, I reach around and grab her elbows, bringing her arms up in front of her. I slide my hands down her arms until I\u2019m holding onto her wrists to keep her arms steady.</p><p>I bend my head down until my mouth is right by her covered ear. \u201cNow, spread your legs just a little.\u201d</p><p>She does as I tell her and her ass brushes against my crotch. I force myself to think about crying babies and shitty diapers and why sleeping with her again is a bad idea as she leans back into me.</p><p>Wrapping my hands around hers, I help her aim the gun at the target ten yards away.</p><p>\u201cThat paper looks so far away. I\u2019m never going to be able to hit that,\u201d Gwen complains.</p><p>I don\u2019t bother telling her that I can hit the bulls-eye every single time at twenty-five yards away; I don\u2019t want to make her feel bad.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be fine. Just take a deep breath and then pull the trigger when you let the air out,\u201d I instruct.</p><p>I keep my arms around her, trying to hold her arms steady for her so she can just concentrate on firing. Keeping one hand around hers, I slowly move the other one to the top of the gun and pull back the slide release to drop a bullet into the chamber. Moving my hand back around hers, I wait for her to pull the trigger.</p><p>I feel her take a deep breath and then the gun goes off, Gwen\u2019s body jerking back against mine. We both lower our arms and stare down the lane at the target. There isn\u2019t a hole anywhere on the paper, which means she completely missed the thing.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s alright. I didn\u2019t hit the target the first time I ever shot a gun either. You just need a little more practice,\u201d I tell her.</p><p>\u201cI want to try again,\u201d she tells me.</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to help you?\u201d I ask, moving closer to her and resting my hands on her hips.</p><p>Aiming the gun at the ground, she quickly pulls the slide release back like a pro and loads another bullet before bringing the gun back up in front of her. She looks over her shoulder at me and smiles. \u201cNope, I think I\u2019ve got it.\u201d</p><p>I warily take a step back and cross my arms, wondering how the hell she was able to pull that release back so perfectly the first time \u2013 those bastards can be tricky. She positions her legs shoulder-width apart, takes a deep breath and fires, the bullet ripping through the red bulls-eye in the middle.</p><p>My mouth drops open in shock and my hands fall to my sides as she quickly drops another bullet in the chamber, aims the gun and fires once more.</p><p>Just like before, the bullet hits the bulls-eye, this time a centimeter away from the first hole. She pulls the release back one more time and fires off a third shot, the hole from the bullet blossoming in between the other two.</p><p>\u201cJesus Christ,\u201d I mutter as she sets the gun down on the counter, takes off the pink muffs and turns around to face me.</p><p>\u201cYou totally just played me, didn\u2019t you?\u201d I ask her in awe.</p><p>Gwen laughs, walking up to me and patting me on the shoulder. \u201cDid you honestly think Brady wouldn\u2019t have taught me how to use a gun when I got here? My favorite color is pink, but that doesn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t shoot a fucking gun.\u201d</p><p>And just like that, my dick is hard. Again.</p><p>She walks away from me with a smile on her face and all I can do is shake my head.</p><p>Chapter 20</p><p>Gwen</p><p>After I shocked the hell out of Austin at the firing range, we went back to his place and I called Ellie to check up on her. I\u2019m glad she decided to stay in Nashville until we find out where William is; I want her close so nothing else happens to her.</p><p>Ellie drove back to Austin\u2019s house earlier and I tried to convince her over dinner to just stay here with us until William is found. She was adamant that she had caused enough trouble by bringing William closer to me and she didn\u2019t want to be in the way. Austin put his foot down and told her she was staying, end of story. Emma was over the moon about it and decided that she and Aunt Ellie were going to have a slumber party in her room tonight. I can hear them talking and laughing down the hall as I clean up the dinner dishes in the kitchen.</p><p>Austin\u2019s been acting a little strange since we got home. I tried teasing him about the shooting range again and he nodded distractedly instead of joining me in a verbal sparring match like he normally would. When Emma and Ellie disappeared to the bedroom, I walked up behind him in the living room where he was staring out the front window and I wrapped my arms around his waist. He immediately pulled away and said he had some phone calls to make. He hasn\u2019t come out of his bedroom since then.</p><p>I\u2019m not really used to the cold shoulder from him and I don\u2019t know what to make of it. Does he regret sleeping with me last night? Maybe he\u2019s decided all of my baggage is too much for him to handle. I hate feeling so conflicted and torn up over a man. I spent too many years like this and I\u2019m pissed at myself for heading down a path I swore I\u2019d never walk again.</p><p>I have enough going on in my life without adding this to the list of shit I have to worry about at the moment. Austin messes with my head and makes me forget the real world and I can\u2019t afford to do that right now no matter how much I want to.</p><p>\u201cI just got off the phone with Cole,\u201d Austin says, walking into the kitchen and interrupting my thoughts. \u201cI had him look up flight manifests for William. Turns out, he never even booked a flight to Chicago for that medical conference or one to come here. He\u2019s been off the radar for a week now.\u201d</p><p>Hearing this doesn\u2019t make me feel any better; it just means he\u2019s going to be even harder to track down. It also solidifies the fact that I have no business worrying about what\u2019s going on in Austin\u2019s head when there are more important things to worry about like keeping Emma safe.</p><p>\u201cHe probably drove. Can the police put out a bulletin to search for his license plate or something?\u201d I ask, turning around to face him.</p><p>\u201cMark had a hard enough time convincing them to be on the look-out for him since the guy isn\u2019t really wanted for any type of criminal behavior, even though he should be. There\u2019s no way they\u2019ll put out an APB for his car without a warrant. Fuck, I really wish you would have filed a report on him at some point,\u201d he complains, running his hand through his hair in frustration.</p><p>I can\u2019t stop the anger that ripples through me. How many times did I curse myself over the years for not doing that exact thing? I don\u2019t need it thrown back in my face right now.</p><p>\u201cDo you honestly think I don\u2019t know that? Do you think I haven\u2019t replayed every single moment of the last ten years over and over again and wished I had done things differently? You have no idea what it was like. There were so many good times mixed in with the bad \u2013 times when he acted like the man I fell in love with,\u201d I explain to him. \u201cDeciding to walk away from the only thing you\u2019ve ever known is not an easy thing to do. I\u2019m the one who has to live with those mistakes and I don\u2019t need a reminder, especially from you.\u201d</p><p>I move to walk out of the room and Austin grabs my arm to stop me. \u201cDammit, I didn\u2019t mean anything by that. I\u2019m just frustrated with the situation.\u201d</p><p>As if I\u2019m not. This is my daughter\u2019s life on the line here. I\u2019ve opened myself up to this man more than I have with anyone else. I\u2019ve told him things I never wanted anyone to know about me because I thought I could trust him.</p><p>Shrugging out of his hold, I head towards the living room.</p><p>\u201cGwen, come on. I\u2019m sorry. I shouldn\u2019t have said what I did.\u201d</p><p>I stop in the doorway and turn to face him while he continues. \u201cThis whole thing is just one big clusterfuck and I\u2019m not used to that. I\u2019m used to going into a situation, coming up with a plan and getting shit done. It doesn\u2019t help that I can\u2019t stop thinking about last night and wonder if we fucked up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow, I didn\u2019t realize sleeping with me would be considered a fuck up,\u201d I tell him sarcastically.</p><p>\u201cGod dammit! Once again, that\u2019s not what I meant. This is coming out all wrong. Sleeping with you wasn\u2019t a fuck up by a long shot. I just meant the fact that we didn\u2019t use any kind of protection was a fuck up.\u201d</p><p>Oh you have got to be kidding me. That\u2019s what his problem is right now?</p><p>\u201cFor your information, I have an IUD so you don\u2019t have to worry about any kind of fuck up like that happening,\u201d I tell him angrily.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to sound like an asshole. I\u2019m just not this person,\u201d he admits.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, what person?\u201d</p><p>He throws his hands up in the air in exasperation. \u201cThe kind of person who does the whole domestic bullshit. That\u2019s just not me. I\u2019m not a father and I\u2019m not a husband.\u201d</p><p>Shaking my head at him, I turn and walk out of the room. \u201cI don\u2019t remember ever asking you to be.\u201d</p><p>He calls out to me as I walk away. \u201cGwen.\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes and keep walking. \u201cScrew you.\u201d</p><p>I spent the rest of the night in the spare bedroom with Ellie and Emma watching a Disney movie on the small television on the dresser. I didn\u2019t even bother going out to the living room to sleep; I didn\u2019t want to run into Austin for fear I would tell him everything I was thinking.</p><p>Typical man naturally assuming that after he slept with a woman she\u2019d want more. What do I care if he thinks he\u2019s not husband or father material? It\u2019s not like I want that for myself again anyway. He was so freaked out about the possibility that I might have gotten pregnant after last night that he completely belittled what we shared. It meant something to me, dammit. I went into his room just wanting a release, just wanting to forget and I walked out of that room the next morning wishing I was a different person, wishing I had more to give because I thought he deserved it. It would be best for me to just forget it ever happened. My only concern right now is my daughter and doing whatever I can to give her a good life. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I drift off to sleep thinking about the choices I\u2019ve made, knowing they were the best I could have done at the time.</p><p>I raced around the room, stuffing as many things as I could into the navy blue duffle bag I found in the back of our closet. Having one arm in a cast and two broken ribs made hurrying next to impossible, but I had to do it. This was my only chance. When I left the hospital earlier, the doctor gave me strict orders that I was to stay in bed for the next week and heal the damage caused by my \u2018car accident\u2019.</p><p>After William left me crumpled up on the floor three days ago to play poker with his friends, I knew he wouldn\u2019t be taking me to the hospital to fix me up himself. With a call to Ellie to have her come over and watch Emma, I drove myself to a hospital in the next county \u2013 one in a bad neighborhood with a reputation for never asking questions, and one I hoped William would never find me in.</p> <p>Unfortunately, when William came home from playing Poker and found Ellie at the house, he threatened to make her life a living hell if Ellie didn\u2019t tell him where I was. She had no choice but to give him the name of the hospital; at that point, she feared him as much as I did. When I came to the next morning to find him leaning over my bed with a sick smile on his face, I knew my time was running out. If I didn\u2019t get away from him immediately, he would make sure I was taken away from Emma permanently.</p><p>When the doctor told me I was lucky they were able to repair the damage to my arm and that it was touch-and-go if I\u2019d ever be able to use it properly again, I knew I was done. I knew I would never be able to continue living like that. The day I came home from the hospital, I found a note from William that he had been called into an emergency surgery that would take most of the night. I didn\u2019t have time to think or hesitate \u2013 it was now or never.</p><p>After I finished packing my bag, I crept into Emma\u2019s room and added some of her clothes, a few Barbies and one stuffed animal. I tried not to let myself break down at the thought of taking my little girl away from everything she knew and loved.</p><p>\u201cBaby, wake up,\u201d I told her gently, running my hand down her head.</p><p>She grumbled in her sleep and slowly blinked her eyes open. \u201cHi, mommy.\u201d</p> <p>I smiled, pulling the covers off of her and helped her sit up. \u201cI\u2019m sorry baby, we need to go somewhere. I promise you can go back to sleep in just a little bit.\u201d</p><p>She yawned and got out of bed, rubbing the sleep from her eyes. \u201cAre we going on a trip?\u201d</p><p>I tried not to wince in pain as I got down on my knees to help her out of her pajamas and into a pair of leggings and a shirt. \u201cYep, we\u2019re going on a trip and we have to hurry so we can make it there in time.\u201d</p><p>It broke my heart to lie to her, but there was no way I could tell her that we needed to hurry and get the hell out of here before her father got home from his emergency surgery.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, mommy. I can dress myself since you\u2019ve got a boo-boo from the car,\u201d she told me, taking the outfit from my hand and getting undressed.</p><p>I swallowed past the lump in my throat thinking about all the half-truths I\u2019d told her over the years. For the most part, they went along with every single doctor\u2019s note William filled out: I fell, I tripped, I cut myself chopping vegetables, I was in a car accident... She always believed me without question and would hover close by, helping me with whatever I needed until I healed.</p> <p>I will make it up to her if it\u2019s the last thing I do. I will never lie to her ever again.</p><p>When she finished dressing, I handed her her coat, put the bag over the shoulder of my good arm and took her hand.</p><p>\u201cIs daddy coming with us?\u201d she asked, as we made our way down the stairs and towards the door.</p><p>I stopped in the foyer and bent back down so I was eye-level with her, wrapping my arm around her small body. \u201cNo, baby. Daddy isn\u2019t coming with us; he\u2019s got a lot of work to do. It\u2019s just going to be you and me.\u201d</p><p>She thought about this for a moment and then smiled at me, placing her hand against my cheek. \u201cThat\u2019s okay. I like it when it\u2019s just you and me.\u201d</p><p>My eyes watered and I wondered how I ever got so lucky to have this amazing little person in my life. \u201cI love you, baby girl.\u201d</p><p>She wrapped her arms around my neck and gave me a tight hug. \u201cI love you too, mommy. Let\u2019s go on our trip. Can we go to the ocean and see dolphins? Or to a princess castle?\u201d</p><p>I stood back up and grabbed her hand, taking one last look around before I opened the door. \u201cWell, we\u2019re going to visit your Uncle Brady in a place called Nashville. I don\u2019t think they have dolphins, but they have horses and cowgirls.\u201d</p> <p>As we walked out into the night, Emma chatted away about wanting to have a white horse just like a real princess. I only hoped that some day I would be able to make this up to her and give her everything her heart desired.</p><p>Chapter 21</p><p>Austin</p><p>It\u2019s been two days since Gwen and I fought in the kitchen \u2013 two long days of her giving me the cold shoulder and only speaking to me when Emma is around. I shouldn\u2019t have been such an asshole, but she needed to know where I stood on things. She needed to understand that whatever was going on between us couldn\u2019t be permanent. The way she glares at me whenever we\u2019re in the same room leads me to believe she got the message loud and clear. I wish I could be that person for her. More than anything I wish things were different, but they\u2019re not. I don\u2019t have happy childhood memories to pass on to a kid and there can never be family vacations or promises of togetherness over the holidays because I never know when I\u2019m going to be out of the country.</p><p>I just have to keep reminding myself what I told Gwen yesterday \u2013 I am not that person.</p><p>Walking out into the living room, I see Gwen pull her keys out of her purse and head towards the door.</p><p>\u201cWhere the hell are you going?\u201d I demand.</p><p>She stops and turns around. \u201cWork. I have the meeting with Mrs. Anderson to show her the pictures of her husband at the motel.\u201d</p><p>When she turns around and opens the door, I race up behind her, smacking my hand against the wood and slamming it closed.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going anywhere.\u201d</p><p>She whirls around with anger in her eyes, but pauses when she sees how close we are. My hand is still up on the door and I\u2019m caging her in. I can feel her breath on my face and I want to haul her body up against me and kiss away every shitty thing that\u2019s happened between us.</p><p>She shakes her head as if clearing her thoughts and stares me down. \u201cYou can\u2019t keep me here. I have a business to run and I\u2019ve already put off some of these clients long enough. In case you\u2019re forgetting, I have a gun and I know how to use it.\u201d</p><p>I know she\u2019s right, but that doesn\u2019t mean it makes it any easier to just let her walk out the door, not knowing if she\u2019ll be walking right into danger.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want anything to happen to you,\u201d I admit to her softly.</p><p>I watch as the anger leaves her face and she closes her eyes for a few seconds before opening them and looking at me again. She searches my face and I realize she\u2019s trying to see if I\u2019m telling the truth. I hate that she doesn\u2019t trust me, but it\u2019s my own damn fault.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine. I have my gun and I\u2019ll go straight to the office and straight back after I meet with Mrs. Anderson,\u201d she promises.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go with you.\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head at me and sighs. \u201cYou need to stay here with Ellie and Emma. Under normal circumstances, Ellie would love to stay here alone with her, but she\u2019s scared out of her mind. She\u2019ll tell you it\u2019s fine, but I know her. She\u2019s not going to want to be alone. I promise I\u2019ll call if I don\u2019t feel comfortable.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s right and there\u2019s nothing I can do but let her go. She\u2019s smart, she\u2019s strong and she\u2019s a survivor. I have to trust her to take care of herself; I won\u2019t be here forever to keep an eye on her.</p><p>As I take a step back and pull the door open for her, I watch her leave and pray to God nothing happens or I\u2019ll never be able to forgive myself.</p><p>\u201cGod dammit! Why the fuck isn\u2019t she answering her phone?\u201d I shout as I weave in and out of traffic at breakneck speeds.</p><p>Ellie is in the backseat with my cell phone in her hand, repeatedly trying to call Gwen and Emma is on her lap, crying hysterically.</p><p>I glance in the rearview mirror and my heart plummets to my stomach when I get another look at the blood running down the side of Emma\u2019s face.</p><p>I was in my room talking on the phone to Cole when I heard a thud from the living room, followed immediately by the sound of Emma crying. I\u2019ve never moved so fast in my fucking life. When I got to the living room, I saw Emma on the floor next to the coffee table holding her hand on her head, blood seeping between her fingers.</p><p>Ellie was bent down next to her trying to pry Emma\u2019s hand away from her head to get a look at the wound. \u201cShe tripped and smacked her head on the corner of the table. I tried to reach for her, but I wasn\u2019t fast enough.\u201d</p><p>With a sick feeling in my stomach, I stalked to the middle of the room, scooped a sobbing Emma up in my arms and packed her and Ellie into the backseat.</p><p>As I race to towards the hospital, Emma continues to cry and ask for her Momma. I\u2019m trying not to freak the fuck out that Gwen isn\u2019t answering her phone; I\u2019ve got enough to worry about right now \u2013 like making sure Emma doesn\u2019t bleed out in the back of my car before we get to the hospital.</p><p>I make it to the hospital in record time and pull up to the emergency room entrance. Putting the car in park, I quickly get out and open the back door, leaning in and pulling a sobbing Emma into my arms.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, pipsqueak, the doctor is going to make it all better, okay?\u201d I tell her as I race through the sliding doors.</p><p>I get to the registration desk and it suddenly occurs to me that I don\u2019t even know if Gwen has medical insurance for Emma and I know for a fact they won\u2019t treat her without a parent present.</p><p>\u201cOh no, it looks like you got a boo-boo,\u201d the nurse at the desk says to Emma in a soothing voice as she stands up and leans over the counter to get a closer look.</p><p>\u201cShe hit her head on the coffee table,\u201d I explain to her. \u201cShe won\u2019t let us look at it so I\u2019m not sure how bad it is, but it won\u2019t stop bleeding.\u201d</p><p>The nurse smiles at Emma as she pulls a clipboard off of a pile and sets it on the counter. \u201cHead wounds always bleed a lot, even if they aren\u2019t that bad. We\u2019ll get her into an exam room right away and have a doctor look at it. Are you her parents?\u201d</p><p>I notice the nurse looking next to me and turn to see Ellie standing there.</p><p>Jesus, I forgot she was even in the car. Awesome fucking protector I\u2019m turning out to be.</p><p>Ellie wraps her arm around my waist and smiles at the nurse. \u201cYes, I\u2019m her mother and this is her father.\u201d</p><p>I glance nervously down at Emma to see if she\u2019s going to contradict Ellie, but she\u2019s still softly crying with her face pressed into my chest and doesn\u2019t seem to notice.</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m her father,\u201d I tell the nurse quietly as I continue staring down at Emma.</p><p>I swallow past the lump in my throat when I say those words and look up as Ellie grabs the clipboard from the counter. \u201cWe just moved here for my husband\u2019s job transfer and his insurance hasn\u2019t kicked in yet. Is it okay if we just pay cash for whatever services my daughter needs?\u201d</p><p>She speaks so naturally, like she\u2019s been practicing this speech for a week. At least one of us has their head on straight right now.</p><p>The nurse tells her that\u2019s perfectly fine and then ushers us to one of the exam rooms. When I start to set Emma down on the exam table, her hands latch onto my shirt, clutching it tightly in her tiny hands and shaking her head back and forth.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to sit there. Can I just stay with you, Austin?\u201d Emma pleads.</p><p>I kiss the top of her head and move away from the table, going to one of the chairs against the wall. I sit down with Emma in my lap and keep my arms securely wrapped around her while Ellie fills out the paperwork in the chair next to us and we wait for the doctor to come in.</p><p>Forty-five minutes, three stitches, six-hundred dollars and two suckers later, Emma is all patched up and sitting in the back seat of my car next to Ellie, happily looking out the window and chatting about her exciting day.</p><p>I pull up to Brady\u2019s apartment and when I don\u2019t see Gwen\u2019s car, I realize we never tried to call her again once we got to the hospital. As Ellie and Emma get out of the backseat, I casually check my phone, not wanting to alert either of them to my panic.</p><p>I immediately see a text from Gwen apologizing for taking so long and explaining that Mr. and Mrs. Anderson both showed up to the meeting and all hell broke loose when Gwen showed Mrs. Anderson the photos of her cheating husband. She said she\u2019ll be home in ten minutes and I figure there\u2019s no point in calling her now and freaking her out. I might as well just wait until she gets home to tell her what happened.</p><p>Ellie takes Emma into the back bedroom to get her changed into her pajamas and I go into my bedroom and close the door behind me. I walk over to the dresser and stare at myself in the mirror, my eyes traveling down to my chest and the splotch of blood Emma left behind. The stain is right over my heart. I reach up and run my fingers over it, wondering why in the hell I feel like shit. Emma got hurt, but it wasn\u2019t that bad. I got her to the hospital and she\u2019s fine now.</p><p>With my hand still over my heart, I remember the way she clung to me in the exam room and the smile she gave me when the doctor told her she could have two suckers for being so brave. I turn away from the mirror and shake my head angrily.</p><p>What the fuck is wrong with me? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I\u2019ve seen men shot between the eyes and held my hands over bloody stumps when a leg was blown off by an RPG and I never felt like I would lose my mind with worry. This was one little girl with a tiny cut \u2013 not really that big of a deal considering the shit I\u2019ve been around in my career.</p><p>Reaching for the hem of my shirt, I yank it roughly off of my body and toss it into the trashcan next to the dresser. As I\u2019m reaching in one of the drawers for a clean shirt, I hear the door to the apartment open and close.</p><p>I turn and hurry out of the room, wanting to get to Gwen before she goes into the bedroom and sees Emma.</p> <p>When I get to the living room, Gwen looks up at me, pausing in the process of taking her shoes off when she sees my bare chest. I stop and put my hands on my hips and flex, just a little bit.</p><p>God I\u2019m such an asshole.</p><p>Gwen blinks and finally looks away, kicking off her shoes and then tossing her purse on the couch. \u201cYou do not even want to know the kind of day I had. I almost had to call the cops on those two idiots. They were screaming at each other so loudly I think they made one of my ear drums explode.\u201d</p><p>When I don\u2019t say anything, she looks up at me and her smile falls. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on? What happened?\u201d</p><p>Before I can explain, Emma comes racing down the hall and into the living room. \u201cMommy guess what? I was a big girl today and I got two suckers!\u201d</p> <p>Emma runs up to her and holds up the one sucker that she hasn\u2019t eaten yet. Gwen squats down and stares at the white bandage on her forehead right by her hairline.</p><p>\u201cBaby, what happened to your head?\u201d Gwen asks as she traces the bandage with the tips of her fingers.</p><p>\u201cI fell and hit the table. Austin carried me to the car like he was Superman! And we drove really fast to the hospital and I got shot in the head and then sewed up,\u201d Emma tells her happily.</p><p>I wait for Gwen to turn and scream at me and tell me I\u2019m the worst person in the world for letting something happen to her daughter. Instead, I hear Gwen chuckle. \u201cI don\u2019t think you got shot in the head, I think you got a shot in the head. Does it still hurt?\u201d</p><p>Emma shakes her head back and forth and Gwen pulls her into her arms and kisses her right on top of the bandage. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry I wasn\u2019t there, baby. Mommy was dealing with crazy people and I must not have heard my phone ring.\u201d</p><p>Figuring Gwen is just waiting until Emma is out of the room before she curses me out, I stand there and wait for my punishment. I deserve it. I should have never let Emma out of my sight.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, mommy. Austin gave me lots of kisses and he took good care of me. When I get hurt again, can Austin take me to the hospital?\u201d Emma asks.</p><p>Gwen squeezes Emma one last time and then pulls back to look at her. \u201cWell, of course he took good care of you, Austin is good at taking care of people. Let\u2019s just hope you don\u2019t have to go to the hospital again any time soon.\u201d</p><p>Gwen gives Emma one last kiss over her bandage and then sends her back to her room. She stands up and walks over to me and I have a sudden urge to cover my balls.</p><p>\u201cCome on, we need to talk,\u201d Gwen says before turning away from me and walking down the hall.</p><p>This is why I should never be a parent. I will just fuck everything up.</p><p>Chapter 22</p><p>Gwen</p><p>I feel horrible that Emma got hurt, today of all days when I wasn\u2019t there, but at least Austin and Ellie were here to take care of her. Austin looked like he was going to puke the entire time I was bent down talking to Emma while she explained what happened to her. As he follows me into his room and I close and lock the door behind him, I would almost swear this hard ass Navy SEAL is scared to death of me.</p> <p>Good lord, I just wanted to thank him for taking care of Emma, not chew his head off. I know the last few days have been difficult and I\u2019ve been a bitch towards him since he jumped to those stupid conclusions about my \u2018expectations\u2019, but does he really think after what happened today I\u2019m still going to hold a grudge about that?</p><p>Austin stands in the middle of the room with his hands in his pockets and his head down, staring at the floor.</p><p>I let him stew for a little bit, figuring he deserves a few more seconds of misery after the shit he pulled the other night.</p><p>When it\u2019s obviously he can\u2019t take the silence anymore, he heaves a big sigh and looks up at me. \u201cGo ahead, let me have it.\u201d</p><p>I take a step closer to him, resting my hands against his chest and look up at his face. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>He narrows his eyes at me in confusion. \u201cWhat the hell are you thanking me for? I was supposed to protect Emma and she got hurt on my watch. You should be beating shit out of me right now.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head in disagreement. \u201cBeing a parent isn\u2019t about keeping them in a bubble so nothing bad ever happens to them. Accidents happen; you can\u2019t prevent all of them. All you can do is be there for them when they do happen, which is exactly what you did. You may think you aren\u2019t father material, but I\u2019m pretty sure most parents in the world would disagree with you right now, and I\u2019m right there with them.\u201d</p><p>He closes his eyes and lowers his head, so I continue. Might as well lay it all out there for him so there isn\u2019t any more confusion between us. \u201cI know you don\u2019t think this is something you\u2019d be good at and I have no idea why. Even though I highly disagree with your opinion of yourself, I\u2019m okay with it. I meant what I said the other day \u2013 I never asked you to take on any kind of role in our lives. I don\u2019t need that from you.\u201d</p><p>Austin finally opens his eyes to look at me again.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you need?\u201d he asks softly.</p><p>With my eyes still locked on his, I slide my hands down his chest, around his sides and over his hips until I reach his hands. Lacing my fingers through his, I walk backwards, pulling him along with me. When we make it to the master bath attached to his room, I pull us inside, closing and locking the door behind him. I let go of his hands and walk over to the shower, turning the knobs until water is pouring out of the showerhead. Letting it warm up, I turn back around and start undressing.</p><p>His eyes never leave mine and I watch him swallow thickly as I strip in front of him, my clothes dropping into a pile by my feet until I\u2019m standing in front of him completely naked.</p><p>As steam begins to fill the small room and my heart starts beating faster, I open myself up a little further to him.</p><p>\u201cRight now, I just need you,\u201d I admit softly.</p><p>Austin lets out a groan and his arms are immediately around me, pulling my naked body against him before his mouth fuses to mine. I open my lips to him and let out my own soft groan when I feel his tongue against mine. It\u2019s only been two days since I last felt his lips on mine, but it feels like forever.</p><p>As we continue kissing, I reach between us, quickly unbuttoning and unzipping his jeans, pushing them, along with his boxer briefs, down over his hips. Austin pulls away from me long enough to shove them the rest of the way off and to kick them into the corner with my own pile of clothes.</p><p>\u201cJesus, you\u2019re so fucking beautiful,\u201d he whispers.</p><p>There\u2019s conviction and awe in his voice as he looks at every inch of my body. For the first time in years, I don\u2019t feel the need to cover myself, to hide my scars or look away in embarrassment \u2013 I feel beautiful with Austin.</p><p>He closes the distance between us, wrapping his arms around me and lifting me up against him. As my feet leave the ground, I clutch onto his shoulders, wrap my legs around his hips and let him walk us both into the shower.</p><p>The hot water cascades down my back as he closes the glass door behind us. I let my head fall back and allow the water to soak my hair and my face before bringing it back up to look down at him. With one hand on my ass holding me against him, he brings his other hand up to the back of my head, pulling my mouth down to his. The spray from the shower rains down on both of our faces as our tongues tangle together. I tighten my thighs around him as he turns and pushes my back against the cold tile wall, bringing his hand off of the back of my head to skim down the front of my wet body. His palm slides over my collarbone and down to my breast, lifting it in his hand as his thumb rubs back and forth over my nipple.</p><p>His large, rough hand combined with the warm water flowing over my skin creates a wild need inside of me and I cling to him tighter, trying to bring us as close as possible.</p><p>Austin abruptly takes his hand off of my breast, pulls his mouth away from mine and lets me slide down his wet body until I\u2019m standing in front of him.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you stop?\u201d I ask breathlessly, letting my hands skim down the hard, wet planes of his chest.</p><p>\u201cOh, I have no intentions of stopping, darlin\u2019,\u201d he tells me with a lopsided grin as he drops to his knees on the shower floor.</p><p>He slides his hands up the inside of my thighs, placing kisses against my skin there as he goes. Looking down at him, I run my fingers through his wet hair over and over until he slides his thumbs up through my sex and opens me to him.</p><p>My hands immediately clutch onto chunks of his hair as he keeps his mouth a centimeter away, his warm breath mingling with the water sliding down between my legs.</p><p>I want to tug him against me; I want to thrust my hips forward to bring his mouth where I need him, but I hold perfectly still while he stares at what he\u2019s doing between my legs. His thumbs move in slow circles, opening me to him over and over again until I just can\u2019t take it anymore. I feel like I\u2019m going to come just from watching him.</p><p>\u201cPlease, Austin,\u201d I whimper.</p><p>As soon as the words leave my mouth, he leans in and runs his tongue up through my center. I let out a moan as I close my eyes and let my head fall back to the shower wall. His tongue is firm and hot as it slides over me, circling the tip around my clit before sucking it into his mouth.</p><p>He brings his hands around to grab my ass, pulling me harder against his mouth while he licks and sucks, devouring me until all coherent thought leaves my mind and I can do nothing but moan and curse while he brings me closer and closer to the edge.</p><p>Austin moans against my sex and I feel the vibrations of his mouth deep inside. I need to see him. I need to watch what he does to me. Opening my eyes, I look down at him and I whimper, thrusting myself against him as his tongue plunges inside of me before moving back up to my clit. There really is nothing hotter than watching a man on his knees between your legs, bringing you to climax.</p><p>He flicks his tongue quickly against my clit, over and over until I feel the warmth of my orgasm start at my toes and work its way up my legs until it explodes from me. I hold Austin\u2019s head in place against me and move my hips faster against his tongue, my release stealing the breath from my lungs.</p><p>With a few tingles of my orgasm still spasming through me, Austin is up off his knees, lifting me up against him and pushing inside of me all at once. We both let out a groan as the wetness from my release and the water soaking our bodies makes him slide into me as deep as he can go on the first thrust.</p><p>Austin buries his face into the side of my neck as he pulls out and immediately drives back inside me, the force of his thrust pushing me up the shower wall.</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d Austin moans against my shoulder. \u201cWhat the hell are you doing to me, Gwen?\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t reply because I don\u2019t have an answer. I don\u2019t know why our bodies fit so well together and I don\u2019t know why I want him more than I ever thought possible, I just do.</p><p>Wrapping my arms around his shoulders, I hold him close and move my hips against him, letting him know I need him; letting him know I want whatever he has to give.</p><p>One of his arms slides around my back to keep it from slamming into the wall and his other hand clutches onto one of my thighs wrapped around his hip. He kisses his way up my neck until he reaches my mouth, grazing his lips against mine without kissing me. He stares into my eyes as he pulls out of me and plunges right back in. I whimper against his mouth and he does it again, and again, and again, each thrust of his cock inside of me pushing me towards another orgasm.</p><p>The water of the shower quickly turns colder as it rains down over us, dripping off of our noses and mingling with our kisses, but the heat from our bodies keeps us warm. Austin drives inside of me over and over until we\u2019re both panting and I\u2019m clawing against his shoulders.</p><p>\u201cJesus, you\u2019re killing me, Gwen. I could fuck you forever,\u201d Austin mutters against my lips as he pumps in and out of me.</p><p>His words shoot straight to my core and I explode around him, shouting his name as I come.</p><p>He quickly follows right behind me, pushing himself as deep as he can, holding himself still while he explodes inside of me. He curses over and over, his hand gripping my thigh tightly through his release, his cock pulsing inside of me.</p><p>We stay wrapped around one another until our wildly beating hearts slow and the cold temperature of the water finally starts making us shiver.</p><p>Without saying a word, Austin lets go of my leg, pulls out of me and reaches over to shut off the water. We exit the shower and he grabs two towels, wrapping one around his waist and the other around my shoulders, rubbing his hands up and down my arms over the towel to warm me up.</p><p>We finish drying off and leave the bathroom, neither one of us saying a word about his slip of the tongue, talking about forever.</p><p>Chapter 23</p><p>Austin</p><p>\u201cI could fuck you forever.\u201d</p><p>God dammit. What the hell was I thinking saying something like that to her? Right now, I\u2019m blaming it on my dick. That fucker makes all of my decisions for me when I\u2019m buried inside of this woman. Gwen never commented on it so maybe she didn\u2019t hear me.</p><p>After the best shower sex I\u2019ve ever had in my life, shit, the best sex I\u2019ve ever had in my life, Gwen went in to check on Emma and Ellie and hasn\u2019t come back out of the room yet. I decide to call Cole back and apologize for hanging up on him earlier when Emma got hurt. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Cole answers on the first ring. \u201cDude, what the fuck? One minute you were complaining about stubborn women and the next thing I know the call ends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, sorry about that. Gwen\u2019s daughter had an accident and I had to take her to the hospital,\u201d I explain, sitting down on the edge of my bed.</p><p>\u201cJesus, is she okay?\u201d Cole asks.</p> <p>\u201cYeah, she\u2019s fine, just bumped her head and had to get a couple of stitches. She was a trooper,\u201d I tell him, explaining to him about how she sweet-talked the doctor into giving her an extra sucker.</p><p>\u201cWell, well, well, listen to you,\u201d Cole says with a laugh.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Cole chuckles again at my expense. \u201cAustin Conrad is yammering on about a little girl like he\u2019s a proud parent. Never thought I\u2019d see the day.\u201d</p><p>I scoff at him and roll my eyes. \u201cYeah, I don\u2019t think so, asshole. We both know I\u2019d make the worst parent in the history of the world.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou may think you aren\u2019t father material, but I\u2019m pretty sure most of the fathers in the world would disagree with you right now, and I\u2019m right there with them.\u201d</p><p>Gwen\u2019s words from earlier echo in my mind, as well as the moment in the hospital when I told the nurse I was Emma\u2019s father and how it made me feel. I\u2019m so lost in thought I didn\u2019t realize Cole has continued talking to me.</p><p>\u201c...mentioned something about Dylan Callahan,\u201d Cole finishes.</p><p>I\u2019m confused for a minute until I remember that I asked him if he knew the guy from school and hung up on him before he could answer.</p><p>\u201cSo, you know the guy?\u201d I ask, pretending like I\u2019ve been following along the entire time.</p><p>I haven\u2019t told Gwen yet that he stopped by the office; I wanted to get some background information on the guy first. Keeping it from her has absolutely nothing to do with the fact that I might have been a little jealous.</p> <p>Right, keep telling yourself that.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know him. Well, I knew him. Haven\u2019t seen him in years. We didn\u2019t go to the same high school, but he was friends with Brady and then dated Gwen for a little while, so he was always hanging around,\u201d Cole explains.</p><p>Well, shit. Now I know I won\u2019t be able to pretend like I\u2019m not jealous because all I can think about at this moment is Gwen sucking face with that fucker and how she made plans to meet with him while he was in town.</p><p>Son of a bitch.</p><p>\u201cDude was kind of intense. Gwen broke it off with him after a few months, but the guy wouldn\u2019t leave her alone. Sent her flowers all the time, notes in the mail telling her they should always be together... shit like that. It really creeped her out until I gave him a talking to.\u201d</p><p>At the mention of flowers and notes in the mail a chill runs down my spine. What if William hasn\u2019t been the one doing this shit to Gwen lately? I really hate to give that asshole the benefit of the doubt, but I have to be smart about this. I can\u2019t go after a guy just because I know what he\u2019s done in the past. I have to look at all of the variables and, right now, the fact remains that aside from Ellie, no one has seen William around town or heard from him in a week. Could Dylan have been the one behind the flowers and the letter Gwen got in the mail? Maybe he was the one Karen saw watching her and Emma that day at the park.</p><p>It still doesn\u2019t make sense, though, that William would come all the way here from New York, rough up Ellie and then leave again without trying to make contact with Gwen or his daughter. Dylan might have had some stalker tendencies in the past, but William is a mean son of a bitch and I\u2019m not going to let my guard down and allow him to hurt my girls.</p><p>There I go again with the \u2018my girls\u2019 shit.</p> <p>\u201cBy \u2018talking-to\u2019, I\u2019m assuming you beat the shit out of him?\u201d I ask.</p><p>Cole laughs. \u201cObviously.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy the fuck would Brady hire him to keep an eye on Layla then?\u201d I question.</p><p>\u201cBrady didn\u2019t know everything that happened. Gwen came to me because she knew he and Brady were friends and she didn\u2019t want to fuck up their friendship. She made me promise not to tell him. Brady and Dylan kept in touch over the years and, according to Brady, the guy is the best at his job in private security. Twenty years is a long time to hold on to a high-school obsession.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t care if it\u2019s been ninety years, I still don\u2019t trust his ass.</p><p>\u201cCan you do me a favor and look into his records? He\u2019s here in town and stopped by Brady\u2019s office to see Gwen when she was out. I want to make sure he\u2019s on the up-and-up before I let him anywhere near her,\u201d I tell Cole.</p><p>Cole is the computer hacker on our team and if anyone can find the dirt on this guy, it will be him. Maybe we\u2019ll get lucky and the guy was popped for stalking at some point in the last twenty years.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think Callahan\u2019s the one behind the shit going on with Gwen, do you?\u201d Cole asks.</p><p>\u201cI have no fucking clue, but I\u2019m not about to make any mistakes when it comes to this.\u201d</p><p>I can already hear Cole clicking away on his computer through the line. \u201cI\u2019m on it. I\u2019ll call you as soon as I find anything.\u201d</p><p>I thank Cole and hang up the phone, tossing it next to me on the bed. I can hear female laughter coming from the bedroom across the hall followed by Emma\u2019s squeals and I can\u2019t help but smile, which immediately pisses me off. Wiping the smile from my face, I flop back on the bed.</p><p>It\u2019s strange for me to be in one place for so long. I\u2019m used to coming home from a mission, getting a few days rest and then heading right back out to do it all over again. When I\u2019m home, the only sounds I ever hear are whatever sporting event I\u2019m watching on TV or traffic outside. I like my privacy; I like my quiet. I like being able to walk through my own house bare-ass naked. I like being single and not having any attachments or anyone to answer to. It\u2019s who I am and it\u2019s who I\u2019ve always been.</p><p>\u201cI never asked you to take on any kind of role in our lives. I don\u2019t need that from you.\u201d</p><p>With a frustrated growl, I rub my hands over my face remembering Gwen\u2019s words. She made it clear she doesn\u2019t expect more from me. She seems to be fine doing whatever it is we\u2019re doing without making me feel guilty that I can\u2019t give her more.</p><p>I should be happy about that. It means that when this is all over, I can walk out of here with a clear conscience and move on.</p><p>So why in the fuck does it piss me off to know there isn\u2019t just a tiny part of her that wants me to stay?</p><p>Chapter 24</p><p>Gwen</p><p>Emma fell asleep at the foot of the bed a few minutes ago after a tickle fight. I don\u2019t want to disrupt her just yet by moving her, so Ellie and I stay where we are at the top of the bed, leaning against the headboard talking about nothing.</p><p>\u201cYou like working for your brother as a private investigator?\u201d Ellie asks.</p><p>\u201cI love it. It\u2019s exciting. William never let me have a job as you know so it\u2019s nice to be able to do something like this.\u201d</p><p>Ellie sighs and continues. \u201cIs it a big office?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s pretty small. There\u2019s an old restaurant next door that\u2019s been abandoned for a few months that Brady wants to buy eventually when we have the extra money. It\u2019s got a huge wine cellar in the basement that would be perfect for a file room, but Brady seems to think it should be a gym,\u201d I tell her with a roll of my eyes. \u201cHe has a heavy bag hanging in our tiny file room now that he uses all the time and Austin has already put it to use, so maybe he\u2019s got a good idea.\u201d</p><p>Ellie is quiet for a few minutes and I look over at her.</p><p>\u201cSo, you really like Austin, don\u2019t you?\u201d Ellie asks softly so she doesn\u2019t wake Emma.</p><p>I feel my face heat up as I think about what just happened in the shower \u2013 his head between my legs, his mouth on me...</p><p>\u201cUm, yeah, I like him. He\u2019s a good man,\u201d I admit, shaking the thoughts of shower sex out of my head.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re in love with him, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Ellie asks, smirking at me.</p><p>I scoff and roll my eyes at her. \u201cHardly. I haven\u2019t known him long enough to be in love with him and besides, I\u2019m not really in the market for love. My hands are full with this little one.\u201d</p><p>We both stare down at the foot of the bed as Emma sighs and burrows deeper into the blankets. I leave out the fact that I\u2019ve been obsessing about what Austin said to me in the shower ever since I walked out of his room. I\u2019m sure he didn\u2019t mean anything by it and it was just something that slipped out in the throes of passion.</p><p>It\u2019s not like I want to be with him forever. That\u2019s just silly. Right? He lights my body on fire and that\u2019s enough to make any woman question her judgment, but he also takes care of Emma and he\u2019s not afraid of my scars or what my past has done to me. He\u2019s protective and trustworthy and he makes me feel alive.</p><p>I\u2019m absolutely not in love with him, there\u2019s just no way.</p><p>I decide it\u2019s time to change the subject before I put too much thought into this and drive myself crazy.</p><p>\u201cSo anyway, how are you doing?\u201d</p><p>Ellie shrugs and picks a few pieces of lint off of her sweater. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I feel like such an idiot. I didn\u2019t want to say anything, but he\u2019s called me a bunch of times the last few days.\u201d</p><p>I look at her in shock and she quickly continues. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I haven\u2019t answered any of his calls. I let them go straight to voicemail and now I\u2019m just keeping my phone off.\u201d</p><p>Part of me wants to tell her to turn her phone back on and talk to him, find out where he is so we can put an end to this once and for all, but then I think about what it would sound like to her \u2013 like I didn\u2019t care about her safety, only mine.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not an idiot any more than I was. You made a mistake and trusted the wrong person. I just have to know how it happened? How did you even start talking to him?\u201d</p><p>Ellie sighs and leans her head back. \u201cHe came to my place looking for you and Emma a few days after you left. He was worried that someone had kidnapped you. As much as I hated him for what he did to you, I found myself feeling bad for him. He sat down on my couch and cried for hours. He told me he was a monster and that he needed help. He was ashamed of himself for what he did and he asked me if I would help him get better. He wanted to be a better person before he even attempted to contact you. At first I did it just as a way of making sure he stayed away from you and didn\u2019t try to find you. I started going with him to anger management classes twice a week. After about a month, we started going to get coffee after the classes. We would just sit there and talk for hours and he made me laugh, made me feel special.\u201d</p><p>Hearing this makes me sick to my stomach. William used to make me laugh too. He used to talk to me for hours and he used to tell me I was the most important person in his world. He made me feel loved and cherished... until he didn\u2019t.</p><p>Looking at Ellie\u2019s face, I see more than shame in her eyes, I see sadness. She really and truly believed that William had changed. She thought she was falling for a man who had gotten help and turned into a better person. It scares me to think that she might forgive him for what he did to her. I know that feeling well. You tell yourself you\u2019ll never let it happen again, you\u2019ll never be such a fool... and then he comes home with flowers in his hands and tears in his eyes and he reminds you so much of the man you fell in love with. He holds you like you\u2019re the most precious thing in the world and he makes you promises that you\u2019re sure he\u2019ll keep this time. It turns into a never-ending cycle until one day, it\u2019s ten years later and you\u2019re crumpled up on the floor of his office sobbing in agony and wishing to die because you know that\u2019s the only way you\u2019ll ever be free of him.</p><p>I can\u2019t let her make the same mistakes I did. I need to tell her what\u2019s been happening. She hasn\u2019t asked why Emma and I have been staying with Austin and it\u2019s obvious she assumes we\u2019re a couple. She has no idea that I\u2019m here because the man she thinks she loves has been terrorizing me.</p><p>\u201cI need to tell you something,\u201d I start, reaching for her hand and holding it in mine. \u201cEmma and I have been staying with Austin because there have been some strange things happening lately.\u201d</p><p>Her eyebrows furrow and she cocks her head. \u201cWhat do you mean strange things, like what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike someone watching Emma when she was with her babysitter and following them home, a creepy letter that came in the mail, hang-up calls and three bunches of purple orchards that were left on my doorstep,\u201d I tell her.</p><p>Ellie knows all about the orchids. After a while, she would come over and dispose of them for me when their smell made me nauseous.</p><p>Her eyes widen in shock. \u201cOh my God, are you serious? Gwen, why didn\u2019t you tell me about this?\u201d</p><p>I sigh and squeeze her hand. \u201cBecause, you\u2019ve had enough to worry about these last few days. I didn\u2019t want to overwhelm you with the idea that William has been stalking me and doesn\u2019t want to let me go.\u201d</p><p>She yanks her hand out of mine. \u201cHe let you go months ago, Gwen. He moved on. I\u2019m sure it hasn\u2019t been him doing these things to you.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m confused by her sudden anger, but not the fact that she\u2019s defending him. I used to do the exact same thing with her when she would tell me to leave him.</p><p>\u201cEllie, look what he did to you. He came all the way here to Nashville just to tell you he was angry that you told me about the two of you? Listen to yourself, that doesn\u2019t make sense,\u201d I argue.</p><p>\u201cOh, but it makes perfect sense that he\u2019s not over you and wants you back?\u201d she asks sarcastically. \u201cEven if he did do these things, it doesn\u2019t mean he can\u2019t let you go. Maybe it\u2019s just his way of saying he\u2019s sorry. He really wants Emma back in his life and maybe he just doesn\u2019t know how to talk to you about it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I realize quickly that I can\u2019t discuss this with her right now. She\u2019s hurt, confused and angry. Both of us are going to say things that we can\u2019t take back if I go on. She\u2019s so messed up in the head right now that she isn\u2019t thinking clearly and I totally get that. I understand how she feels, which is why I\u2019m leaving it alone for now.</p><p>\u201cYou know what, it\u2019s getting late,\u201d I tell her, scooting off of the bed. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for upsetting you. Get some rest and we\u2019ll talk more in the morning.\u201d</p><p>I walk to the end of the bed and pull the blankets up over Emma\u2019s shoulders before leaning down and kissing her on the cheek.</p> <p>Ellie doesn\u2019t say anything until I\u2019m across the room and my hand is on the doorknob.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Gwen.\u201d</p><p>I look back over my shoulder at my best friend and give her a smile. \u201cI know. It\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>I leave the room and walk across the hall to Austin\u2019s room, seeing him lying on his back in bed with his legs hanging off the edge and his arms thrown over his eyes. I quickly close the door behind me and creep over to the bed.</p><p>Climbing up his body, Austin doesn\u2019t open his eyes until I\u2019m straddling his hips. Leaning over him, I rest my hands on the bed on either side of his face, my hair falling around us like a curtain. Austin reaches up with one hand and brushes my hair away, tucking it behind one ear. Without saying a word, he puts both of his hands on my hips and pulls me snug against the erection I feel straining against his pants. I smile down at him before leaning back on my thighs and pulling my shirt up and over my head.</p> <p>Austin quickly sits up, wrapping his arms around me so I don\u2019t fall to the ground. He doesn\u2019t move, just sits there at the edge of the bed with my legs straddling him while he stares into my eyes. He looks sad and I wonder why. His arms tighten around me like he\u2019s afraid to let me go. Just when I start to ask him what\u2019s wrong, he leans forward and kisses me.</p><p>He kisses me softly and his hands caress every inch of my body before he gets up and places my feet on the floor. He finishes undressing me, making quick work of his own clothes before throwing back the covers and getting into bed, pulling me down on top of him.</p><p>We take our time tasting and touching every inch of one another\u2019s bare skin before Austin rolls me over onto my back and slowly enters me. He rocks into me gently, never taking his eyes off of me. I wrap my arms around his back and pull my legs up on either side of him so he can go deeper, loving the way he feels inside me.</p><p>I pull his body closer to mine until his chest is pressed against me and I can feel his heartbeat. Our eyes stay connected through my release and his own as I cling to him tightly, never wanting to this feeling to end.</p><p>After he moves away from me, curling up at my back with his arm securely around my middle, it doesn\u2019t take long before I hear the deep, even breaths signaling that he\u2019s asleep. Only then do I admit to myself that Ellie is probably right.</p><p>I\u2019m in love with Austin.</p> <p>Chapter 25</p><p>Austin</p><p>Gwen\u2019s going to kill me.</p><p>I should feel bad about what I just did, but I can\u2019t. The past two days have been nothing short of amazing \u2013 hanging out with Gwen and Emma, working together on some of the paperwork for her cases that she brought with her, playing Navy SEAL with Emma before bed and spending every night kissing every inch of Gwen\u2019s body, showing her what I just can\u2019t bring myself to tell her. I can\u2019t regret the choice I made tonight while Gwen and Ellie gave Emma a bath. When I leave, I need to know Gwen and Emma are safe and that nothing will happen to them ever again. The only way to make sure that happens is to put William Stratford behind bars for a very long time.</p><p>\u201cYou got all the pages I emailed over to you?\u201d I ask, as I pace back and forth in my room.</p><p>I can hear Mark shuffling papers through the line. \u201cYep, got everything \u2013 twenty photos and fifteen pages of notes. Jesus Christ, this guy is an asshole.\u201d</p><p>I close my eyes and do something I\u2019ve never done \u2013 I pray that Gwen will forgive me for violating her privacy. When she was busy packing up Emma\u2019s things to come and stay here with me, I went into her bedroom and took the file documenting her abuse out of her dresser and shoved it in the waistband of my jeans against my back and under my shirt.</p><p>Looking through all of those photos again as I scanned each one and sent it off to Mark, convinced me that I was doing the right thing. She should never have to look over her shoulder ever again and I need to know there will never be another photo to add to that pile after I\u2019m gone. The only way I\u2019ll be able to walk out that door is by knowing she\u2019s protected; that she and Emma can live a long, happy life.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll start filing the report against Stratford this morning, but you know Gwen\u2019s going to have to stop by the station in Nashville and sign off on it. I\u2019ll make sure to send them a copy of it, so you\u2019re going to have to convince her this is in her best interest and get her in there as soon as possible,\u201d Mark reminds me.</p><p>\u201cI know, I\u2019ll cross that bridge when I come to it.\u201d</p><p>I hear a muffled voice through the line and Mark telling someone to hold on before coming back to me. \u201cShit, I gotta go, there\u2019s a call on the other line I have to take.\u201d</p><p>I thank Mark for all of his help and end the call just as a knock sounds at my door. Pulling it open, I look down to see Emma standing there looking up at me with a smile.</p><p>\u201cCan you tuck me in, Austin?\u201d</p><p>Poking my head out of my room, I look down the hall and then back at her. \u201cWhere\u2019s your mom?\u201d</p><p>Emma grabs my hand and starts to pull me across the hall. \u201cShe\u2019s taking a bath and I\u2019m sleepy. Aunt Ellie already fell asleep.\u201d</p><p>I smile as she tugs harder on my hand, following her to the bedroom. She scrambles up in bed and gets under the covers.</p><p>She looks up at me expectantly and I\u2019m at a loss. What the fuck am I supposed to do now? How do you tuck someone in?</p><p>Leaning over her, I pull the covers up a little higher until they\u2019re under her chin. \u201cUh, so... have a good night.\u201d</p><p>I start to turn away when she giggles. \u201cAustin! You have to sit next to me until I fall asleep. That\u2019s what mommy always does.\u201d</p><p>Scratching my head and looking behind me to the door, I wonder how long Gwen\u2019s going to be in the bath.</p><p>Emma pulls one arm out from under the blankets and pats the bed next to her. With a sigh, I sit down on the edge of the bed. \u201cSo, how long does it take you to fall asleep?\u201d</p><p>Emma laughs and shakes her head at me. \u201cI don\u2019t know, silly. Put your feet up and lay down like me.\u201d</p><p>Figuring I might as well do as she says or it\u2019s going to be midnight before she finally falls asleep, I pull my legs up onto the bed. Emma scoots over away from me and pats her hand against her pillow, signaling me to lie next to her.</p><p>Once I\u2019m flat on my back, she moves closer to me, grabbing my arm and lifting it in the air. I hold it up for her with a confused look on my face until she slides closer and rests her head in the crook of my shoulder. I bring my arm down around her and wonder why this feels like the most natural thing in the world. I stare down at her face as she closes her eyes and wonder what she\u2019ll be like when she\u2019s ten, fifteen, twenty... I wonder if she\u2019ll still be this sweet and trusting. I wonder if Gwen will have remarried by then and if the lucky bastard will cherish every single moment with these two women. I wonder if Emma will remember the man she lived with for a week when she was six who taught her how to create a diversion to get the innocent Barbies out of harm\u2019s way.</p><p>A sad laugh bubbles out of me when I think about how Emma screamed at the top of her lungs that the couch was on fire so I could grab the dolls and chuck them into the kitchen. Gwen came running into the room with a cup of water from the bathroom in her hand, shouting about how she\u2019d put the fire out. Emma and I fell to the floor laughing until we couldn\u2019t breathe and Gwen stomped out of the room angrily when she found out it was a false alarm.</p><p>Emma shifts next to me trying, to get more comfortable, and brings her hand up to rest on my stomach. I can\u2019t help myself; I wrap my large hand around her tiny one and hold on tight.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Austin. Can you tuck me in to bed every night?\u201d Emma whispers sleepily.</p><p>Closing my eyes, I don\u2019t say anything in return. I\u2019m afraid if I open my mouth now, I\u2019ll cry like a fucking baby.</p><p>An hour later, the feel of my phone vibrating in my pocket wakes me up. I slowly slide out of bed, trying not to jostle Emma too much. She doesn\u2019t even stir when I pull my arm out from under her. I quickly exit the room and pull my phone out, not at all surprised when I see who\u2019s calling. He approved me taking some personal time off, but I knew he wouldn\u2019t be patient for very long.</p><p>\u201cConrad, how\u2019s civilian life?\u201d Captain Risner asks.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good, sir.\u201d</p><p>He gets right to the point. \u201cI know you said you\u2019d give me a call when things were wrapped up there, but we have an emergency in Kuwait that I could use you on. I need to know right now if you\u2019re in.\u201d</p><p>I lean back against the wall and bow my head. \u201cHow soon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need to be briefed before you fly out, so I\u2019d need you here in Virginia by oh-eight-hundred on Wednesday.</p><p>Two days from now.</p><p>\u201cSir, things aren\u2019t quite finished here yet. I\u2019m not sure if I could make it to Virginia in time,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>There\u2019s no way in hell I\u2019m leaving Gwen and Emma before Stratford is behind bars.</p><p>\u201cWell, get it done, Conrad. If this mission goes well, I\u2019ll be able to sign off on that Lieutenant paperwork you put on my desk three months ago.\u201d</p><p>Shit. I forgot all about that. It\u2019s what I\u2019ve been working my ass off for, the only thing I\u2019ve ever wanted \u2013 to be in charge of my own team. Cole was our lieutenant until he decided to take a leave of absence and Risner assured me the job would be mine if I kept my head in the game and kept doing what I\u2019ve always done \u2013 live, eat and breathe Navy.</p><p>\u201cI understand, sir. I\u2019ll make sure I\u2019m there,\u201d I tell him before ending the call.</p><p>I knew this moment was coming, I just didn\u2019t expect it to be here so soon. I\u2019ve been preparing myself to leave them from the moment I got here. This is the only dream I\u2019ve ever had and I seriously can\u2019t believe I\u2019m standing here in the hallway wishing for something else, something I can never have.</p><p>Without thinking about it, I place another call to Mark, telling him to get a BOLO out on Stratford immediately. This needs to be finished now so I can get on with my life the way I always planned.</p><p>Tomorrow, I\u2019ll talk to Ellie and get her advice on breaking the news to Gwen about the fact that I completely violated her trust and gave her personal file over to the police without her knowing. Tomorrow, I\u2019ll shut everything off and make myself remember what I\u2019m here for \u2013 to do a job.</p><p>But right now, I\u2019m going to spend one last night holding my girl close and memorizing the way she feels in my arms.</p><p>Chapter 26</p><p>Gwen</p><p>As I lie in bed waiting for Austin, I think about the scene I saw a half hour ago on my way in here and my heart constricts \u2013 my baby girl, snuggled up next to Austin, his arm around her, holding her tight. She told him she loved him. She never said those words to her own father, always keeping her distance from him as if she instinctively knew what kind of man hid underneath the perfectly styled hair, three piece suits and expensive gifts he showered her with week after week, trying to make up for the fact that he knew nothing about being a father. In just a week, she trusted Austin more than the man she lived with for six years.</p><p>I hope to God Austin realizes the magnitude of what she said to him. I know I told him I didn\u2019t expect anything from him, but at this point, how can I not? He\u2019s wormed his way into both of our hearts and I fear that we\u2019ll never be the same if he leaves. I can\u2019t ask him to stay; I would never put him in that position. I know he has a job to do that is very important to him and I respect that about him. It would be nice to know he wanted to stay, though; it would be nice to know that even if he had to leave, maybe he\u2019d come back to us. Austin thinks he has no idea how to be a father, but he has no idea that he\u2019s already twice the father William ever was.</p><p>I\u2019ve spent all this time fighting the feelings I have for him because I was afraid he would try to change me like William did. The thought of losing my independence that I just got back and having no control over my own life petrifies me. Austin is protective, but he would never hold me back. He wants me to be strong and he wants me to be who I want to be. He gives me strength I never knew I had. I just hope I\u2019m strong enough to let him go if that\u2019s what he chooses to do.</p><p>Closing my eyes and breathing in the scent of Austin on his pillows and blankets, I hear a muffled voice out in the hall. I drift off to sleep hoping that Austin can see what\u2019s standing right in front of him.</p><p>Reaching over in bed, my hand pats against a cold sheet instead of a warm body. Blinking my eyes open and glancing around the room, I see that I\u2019m alone. I felt Austin come to bed sometime in the middle of the night, sliding in next to me and pulling my body against his. I fell back to sleep immediately and had a dream where Austin kissed the side of my neck and whispered in my ear that he was sorry and that he loves me. It was a wonderful dream, but it\u2019s sad to know that\u2019s all it was.</p><p>Hearing Austin and Ellie talking in the main part of the house, I roll out of bed and throw on a pair of jeans and a sweater. Ellie slept on the couch last night when she saw Austin and Emma curled up in bed together. After I took a bath, I tried talking to her again while she was busy making up her bed in the living room, but she brushed me off. She apologized again for getting upset, but I could tell she didn\u2019t mean it. She wouldn\u2019t look me in the eye and she immediately changed the subject. All she wanted to talk about was Emma \u2013 how beautiful she\u2019d gotten, how much she\u2019d grown, how lucky I was to have her. I know she needs time to process everything and I don\u2019t want to push her. I just want her to be safe; I don\u2019t want her to make the same mistakes as me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When I get in the living room, I glance in the kitchen to see Emma sitting at the table eating a bowl of cereal, Ellie on the couch with her head in her hands and Austin pacing back and forth in front of her.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>Austin turns at the sound of my voice and Ellie looks up from her spot on the couch. I make my way over to him and reach for his hands, but he quickly slides them into the front pockets of his jeans. \u201cI just got a call from Mark at the police department in New York. The department in Bowling Green, Kentucky found William and they have him in custody.\u201d</p> <p>My mouth drops open in shock. \u201cHis parents live in Bowling Green. What happens now? Did he confess to everything?\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t believe they found him and actually brought him in. Part of me wondered if he had so many connections in New York that he\u2019d go back there and nothing would ever come of it. He\u2019s been paying off the city of New York for so long that at this point, I wouldn\u2019t put it past them to let everything slide.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. All I know is that they put a BOLO out for him and a cop pulled him over just outside of the city and brought him in,\u201d Austin explains.</p><p>\u201cWait, how were they able to do a \u2018be on the look-out\u2019? I thought you said charges needed to be filed against him or something for them to be able to do that?\u201d I ask in confusion.</p><p>Ellie scoffs from over on the couch and I look around Austin to see her stand up and cross her arms in front of her. \u201cYeah, Austin, why don\u2019t you tell her how the cops were able to bring him in?\u201d</p> <p>Austin squeezes his hands into fists at his sides and clenches his jaw.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you clue her in to the fact that you violated her trust,\u201d Ellie adds.</p><p>I look back and forth between the two of them and decide to go with Austin. Ellie is staring at him like she might rip his head off and I feel like I might get a straighter answer out of him.</p><p>\u201cAustin, what is she talking about?\u201d</p><p>I take a step closer to him and he takes a step back. He\u2019s putting distance between us and it\u2019s starting to make me nervous. I\u2019m happy William is in custody, but I\u2019m scared about what will happen next. I just want his arms around me, reassuring me that everything will be okay.</p><p>\u201cI told Ellie about something this morning while you were still asleep. I wanted her help convincing you it was the right thing to do, but obviously she\u2019s changed her mind,\u201d Austin tells me, shooting an angry look over his shoulder at Ellie.</p> <p>\u201cOh, please! You weren\u2019t thinking about anything but yourself. You just wanted to be the hero so you could move on to something bigger and better,\u201d Ellie accuses.</p><p>Austin turns around to face her. \u201cYou know what? I\u2019ve had just about enough of-\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you both cut it out?\u201d I interrupt. \u201cTell me what the hell is going on!\u201d I shout.</p><p>\u201cThis ought to be good,\u201d Ellie mutters.</p><p>\u201cEllie, can you take Emma back to the bedroom please?\u201d I ask her.</p><p>She looks at me in irritation like I just told her to run over a cat. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be kidding me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, Ellie. Just for a few minutes,\u201d I beg.</p><p>I raise my eyebrows at her and plead with her silently to understand. I need Austin to talk to me and he\u2019s not going to be comfortable doing that with Ellie in the room since she\u2019s obviously angry with him about something.</p> <p>After a few seconds, Ellie huffs angrily, throwing her hands up in irritation. \u201cFine. Whatever.\u201d</p><p>She marches into the kitchen and scoops Emma up in her arms, grabbing the bowl of cereal and carrying them both down the hall towards the room.</p><p>When we\u2019re finally alone, I try again. \u201cOkay, she\u2019s gone so you have no one bitching at you. Now tell me what she was talking about and why she\u2019s so pissed.\u201d</p><p>Austin doesn\u2019t show any kind of emotion as he stands in front of me. No cocky smile, no softness in his face... nothing. It\u2019s like he\u2019s put a shield over his face to keep me out. \u201cYou\u2019re right, the police couldn\u2019t bring William in just because we suspected him of stalking you. They needed proof of criminal activity.\u201d</p><p>I stare at him in confusion for a few minutes until it clicks into place. Proof of criminal activity. There\u2019s only one thing that would pass for that \u2013 my file.</p><p>\u201cOh my God, you gave it to them?\u201d</p><p>Austin doesn\u2019t say anything, he just continues to stand here staring at me.</p><p>\u201cThat was my personal information, you had no right to share it with anyone!\u201d I shout angrily.</p><p>I know I\u2019m being irrational, but I can\u2019t help it. It was hard enough for me to show those things to him, and now God knows how many other people will see them. William is a very big deal in New York; the police aren\u2019t going to be able to keep it quiet for long. Soon, everyone will see those pictures: my parents, Brady... everyone I\u2019ve ever known will see just everything I let William do to me for so many years.</p><p>\u201cHow did you even get it, did you go back to Brady\u2019s place since we got here?\u201d I demand.</p><p>He shakes his head and finally speaks. \u201cI took it when you were packing up Emma before we came here.\u201d</p><p>He says it so casually, like he didn\u2019t completely violate my privacy and my trust by taking that file and giving it to someone else. I turn away from him, not wanting to look at his face, so cold and business-like.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t be mad about this Gwen, it had to be done to make sure he stays locked up for a long time, and there was no other way.\u201d</p><p>I whirl back around angrily. \u201cHow about talking with me about it first? This isn\u2019t something you just take upon yourself because you think you\u2019re doing the right thing. This is my life, my past and now it\u2019s going to be broadcast all over the place for everyone to see. Oh, my God, Emma could see it! Did you even think about that when you handed it over?\u201d</p><p>At the mention of Emma he winces, but it doesn\u2019t stop him from trying to plead his case. \u201cGwen, this is my job, you know that. I do whatever is necessary to get it done, even if that means pissing a few people off.\u201d</p><p>His words are like a punch right to my heart. I\u2019m just \u201cpeople\u201d now to him. Maybe that\u2019s what I\u2019ve been all along.</p><p>\u201cWell, lucky for you it looks like the job is finished and you can be on your way to help out more people.\u201d</p><p>His face remains like a piece of stone \u2013 no emotion or reaction at all. \u201cYou knew this was going to happen from the very beginning. You knew I would be gone as soon as this was finished. I\u2019m not the type of guy who stays in one place long or has a family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod dammit, I am so sick and tired of you always going back to that! You\u2019re not the type of guy who\u2019s a father, you\u2019re not the type of guy who\u2019s a husband... did it ever occur to you that you are EXACTLY that type of person, but you\u2019re too fucking scared to admit it? I\u2019ve seen the way you are with Emma, I\u2019ve felt the way you are with me. How can you not see it?\u201d</p><p>Austin scoffs and shakes his head at me. \u201cYou don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>Even though I want to throttle him, I step closer. \u201cYou\u2019re right, I don\u2019t understand, so tell me!\u201d</p><p>He just shakes his head at me.</p><p>\u201cI have given you EVERYTHING! Every piece of myself that I thought I would never give to another person. Why is it so hard for you to open up to me?!\u201d</p><p>My voice is getting louder and louder, but I don\u2019t care. I just want him to hear me and to understand that I want to know every part of him.</p><p>He moves away and runs his hands through his hair in frustration before letting them smack down to his thighs.</p><p>\u201cFuck! You want to know about my scars? They\u2019re all on the inside, Gwen. I have no fucking clue what it takes to be the man you and Emma need and it fucking kills me! I had a shitty childhood. The Navy was like a fucking five star resort compared to some of the places I grew up in. The only parents I ever knew shoved me around and treated me like a worthless piece of shit until they got sick of me and sent me on to the next shitty family. Is that what you want to hear?\u201d he shouts angrily.</p><p>My heart breaks for him and I want to go to him and wrap my arms around him, but it\u2019s clear he\u2019s shutting me out and he\u2019s already made his decision.</p><p>\u201cYES! Is it so hard for you to understand that I want to know you? I want to know what made you the man you are today, the good and the bad. You\u2019ve seen every part of me. You know my fears and my weaknesses \u2013 why is it such a bad thing that I want to know yours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause that\u2019s not who I fucking am! I\u2019m a Navy SEAL, Gwen. I don\u2019t have time for fear and weakness and I can\u2019t make any mistakes or have any distractions. Something like that in my line of work will get me killed.\u201d</p><p>And just like that, my heart breaks in two. It\u2019s okay for me to be broken and afraid, but not him.</p><p>\u201cWow, it must be nice to be so fucking perfect,\u201d I throw back. \u201cLucky for you, this job is over and you can go on with your life. You don\u2019t have to worry about Emma and I ever being a distraction for you.\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t say a word to me as I turn away and walk out of the room to begin packing our things.</p><p>Chapter 27</p><p>Austin</p><p>One hour, eight minutes and twenty-seven seconds.</p><p>That\u2019s how long Gwen and Emma have been gone from this house. A little over an hour and it already feels like I haven\u2019t seen them in a year. I never meant to be such a prick to Gwen when I said good-bye. Fuck, that wasn\u2019t even a good-bye, that was a kiss-off. I\u2019m surprised she didn\u2019t flip me the finger as she was walking out the door. I wanted to sit her down and explain to her again my reasons for not being able to stay. I never wanted our last words to be spoken in anger and I never intended to cut her so deep she couldn\u2019t even bring herself to look at me before the door closed behind her and she walked out of my life.</p><p>At least Ellie spoke to me before they left. When I suggested driving them to the police station so Gwen could sign the report, she told me to fuck off. I wasn\u2019t about to let them go anywhere alone even if William was behind bars; there was still one loose end that needed to be tied up. Fortunately, or unfortunately depending on how you look at it, Cole called me as the girls were heading towards the door to tell me that Dylan Callahan came back clean. No record for stalking and when Gwen heard me say his name while I was on the phone, I had to come clean about him stopping by her office. If she were a cartoon character, there would have been smoke coming out of her ears. She told me in no uncertain terms that I was an asshole and that Dylan was a friend. They had indeed made plans to see each other for coffee while he was in town.</p><p>Right now, I feel like an asshole. I should have never hid the fact that I was planning on using her file to make sure William didn\u2019t get away what he\u2019d done to her. I thought I was protecting her by keeping things from her, but I should have known better. She\u2019s amazing, she\u2019s smart and she\u2019s a fighter. She had every right to be involved in all aspects of the plan to take down the man who terrorized her for most of her adult life.</p><p>The timer on my tactical watch goes off, signaling I need to leave if I want to catch my flight. In order for me to get to Virginia by eight tomorrow morning, I need to take a flight to Chicago tonight and then leave at five the following morning for Virginia. Standing in the middle of my living room, I can\u2019t make my feet move. Everywhere I look, I see Gwen or hear Emma. As soon as I walk out this door, it will all be gone \u2013 the smiles, the laughs, the kisses... it will all be pushed away into a dark corner of my mind so I don\u2019t have to think about it or wish for something I can\u2019t have. When I walk out that door, it will be like my time with them never existed.</p><p>This is what I live for \u2013 being called in at the last minute, not knowing what to expect or what kind of danger I\u2019ll be walking into... it\u2019s what I was meant to do. It\u2019s my life and fighting for something important has always made me happy.</p><p>So why the fuck am I standing here regretting the decision to go?</p><p>I should already have my go-bag in my hand and be out the fucking door leaving a cloud of dust in my wake, but Emma\u2019s words from the previous day echo through my head.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Austin. Can you tuck me in to bed every night?\u201d</p><p>I never wanted this to happen; I wasn\u2019t supposed to get attached. Stick around long enough to make sure Gwen and Emma were safe and then get the fuck out of here. I never expected sleeping with Gwen would stir up a shit storm of foreign emotions inside of me. I never expected to spend time with a kid and actually enjoy it. What the fuck is wrong with me?</p><p>You love them, you asshole.</p><p>Oh, fuck no. That\u2019s not it. I like spending time with them, that\u2019s all it is. It made me wish I had a different childhood and could be a different person. Gwen was wrong, I\u2019m not afraid; I just don\u2019t want that kind of life.</p><p>It\u2019s complete and total bullshit that I\u2019m actually contemplating calling Captain Risner back and telling him to find someone else. I am not this man. Gwen and Emma have spent enough time turning me inside out and my life upside down. It\u2019s time for me to get the fuck out of here before I do something stupid and completely fuck up my career.</p><p>William is in jail where his sorry ass belongs, Dylan isn\u2019t a creepy ass stalker with a twenty-year old obsession and Gwen and Emma are safe now; my job is done.</p><p>Grabbing my go-back from the floor by my feet, I toss it over my shoulder, determined to stick with the plan I\u2019ve had all along \u2013 leave when the job is finished and don\u2019t look back.</p><p>Of course the fucking flight is delayed. All I want to do is get out of this God forsaken town and now I\u2019m stuck here for who knows how long. At least my connecting flight doesn\u2019t leave until tomorrow morning so I have plenty of time. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDaddy!\u201d</p><p>Turning around at the sound of a little girl\u2019s shout, I see a man in military fatigues walk through the door from the gangway with a crowd of other passengers whose plane just landed. As soon as he sees the girl, his face lights up with happiness and his eyes fill with tears. He drops his go-bag to the ground and races towards her. It\u2019s like something out of a fucking Hallmak card or cheesy chick flick. The little girl, around Emma\u2019s age, throws herself into his arms and he scoops her up, cradling her to him as tightly as he can.</p><p>I had seen the little girl and her mom pacing back and forth nervously with a few airport personnel while I stood here. Since 9-11, if you don\u2019t have a ticket, you don\u2019t get anywhere near the gate, but when it involves a soldier coming home from war, the airlines make exceptions.</p> <p>Right now, I can\u2019t take my eyes off of the scene in front of me no matter how much I want to look away. The woman joins in on the tearful reunion, wrapping her arms around both of them. The man finally looks away from the little girl to kiss his woman, telling her he loves her, and apologizing for being gone so long and missing so much.</p><p>\u201cBaby, we were fine, you don\u2019t have to apologize. This is what you do and I\u2019m so proud of you. I\u2019m just happy to have you home again,\u201d the woman tells him through her tears.</p><p>\u201cDaddy, can you tuck me in to bed every night now?\u201d the little girl asks him.</p><p>My heart constricts like someone reached into my chest and wrapped their hands around it in a vice grip. It takes everything in me not to crumple to the floor in pain. If I didn\u2019t know any better, I\u2019d think I was having a heart attack right now, but I know that\u2019s not it. Standing here watching this family reunite after so many months apart and seeing strength and love shining in the woman\u2019s eyes, I realize what a huge mistake I made. Military families do this day in and day out. They say good-bye to a loved one and they do what they have to do to survive until they can be together again. It\u2019s hard and it\u2019s painful but if you love each other, anything is possible.</p><p>I love Gwen and Emma. I love the idea that when I leave to go on a mission, they\u2019ll be there waiting for me with open arms when I get back. I love seeing all the pink Barbie shit strewn throughout my house and I love teaching Emma how to be a soldier. I love that Gwen will tell me when I\u2019m being an ass and I can tell her when she\u2019s being stubborn. I love that they both accepted me in their life and saw something in me that I never saw in myself. I don\u2019t know how to be a husband or a father, but I can learn if Gwen and Emma will teach me. If anyone has the strength to be with a man who has a job like I do, it would be Gwen.</p> <p>With one last look at the family next to me, I turn and race as fast as I can out of the airport. It\u2019s time for me to get my head out of my ass and go get my girls; I just hope it\u2019s not too late.</p><p>Chapter 28</p><p>Gwen</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re coming with us to the police station,\u201d I tell Ellie as I make my way to Brady\u2019s apartment \u2013 my home. Funny how quickly being with Austin made me forget where I belong.</p><p>\u201cI just want to stop at the apartment real quick so Emma and I can change. We ran out of clean clothes yesterday.\u201d</p><p>Ellie has been quiet since she told Austin off before we left. She keeps running her hand through her hair nervously and turning around to check on Emma in the back seat. I know she\u2019s scared to file her own report against William and I hope she goes through with it. When she goes back to New York, she needs to be protected.</p> <p>\u201cSo, Emma, how would you like to come and visit Aunt Ellie in New York some time?\u201d Ellie asks, turning around to look at Emma.</p><p>I watch in the rearview mirror as Emma shrugs, staring out the window at the passing landscape.</p><p>\u201cMom, are we going back to Austin\u2019s house later?\u201d she asks, meeting my gaze in the mirror.</p><p>I put on a brave smile for her even though I my heart hurts just thinking about him. In the end, he didn\u2019t want us. As much as it pains me to admit it, we\u2019re better off without him. We deserve someone in our lives that will fight for us.</p><p>\u201cAustin has to go away for work, baby,\u201d I tell her, not wanting to elaborate right now. I\u2019ll save that for later when we\u2019re alone and I can wrap my arms around her and try to explain to her why we won\u2019t be seeing Austin anymore.</p><p>\u201cWill he be home soon? He was going to show me how to do push-ups like soldiers do so I can grow big and strong,\u201d she informs me.</p><p>Ellie rolls her eyes. \u201cEmma, Austin isn\u2019t coming back. You\u2019re better off without him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cELLIE!\u201d I scold, craning my neck to see Emma\u2019s lip quivering with emotion.</p> <p>I turn back around and shoot Ellie an angry look, keeping my voice low so Emma doesn\u2019t hear me even though I want to scream at my friend. \u201cWhy would you do that? She doesn\u2019t need to know anything about this right now.\u201d</p><p>Ellie huffs and shakes her head at me. \u201cYou can\u2019t always sugar coat things with her. She\u2019s a smart girl, she might as well find out now that men will always let you down.\u201d</p><p>Ellie is so bitter and angry that I don\u2019t know how to handle her, but I\u2019m not about to let her hurt my child.</p><p>\u201cEmma is my child and I will decide when and if she should know things. Please don\u2019t talk to her about something she\u2019s not going to understand,\u201d I inform her.</p><p>The car is quiet the rest of the drive to Brady\u2019s apartment and I\u2019m glad for that. I always thought Ellie and I would be friends forever, but there\u2019s a divide between us now that I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll ever be able to cross. She doesn\u2019t know how to forgive me for insinuating that William didn\u2019t really care about her, and I don\u2019t know how to forgive her for falling in love with him.</p><p>When we get to the apartment building, I help Emma out of the car and Ellie follows along behind us as we make our way upstairs. I pass Karen in the hallway and she gives Emma and me a hug before hurrying out to run some errands.</p><p>\u201cAlright, Emma, go on back and change your clothes, honey. I\u2019m going to put our bags in my room and change then after that we have to go and meet some people, okay?\u201d Emma nods and walks slowly out of the room towards her bedroom.</p><p>I don\u2019t say anything to Ellie as I follow behind Emma and go into my room. I don\u2019t know if I have anything left to say to her and it makes me sad \u2013 a lifetime of memories and friendship, gone in the blink of an eye. Throwing our bags on top of my bed, I decide to take a quick shower while Emma is changing, knowing that Ellie will keep an eye on her until I\u2019m finished.</p><p>I shower quickly, throwing on a pair of yoga pants, tennis shoes and a long-sleeved shirt. I don\u2019t hear any noise coming from the living room so I forego drying my hair to go out and see what Emma and Ellie are doing. When I step out from the hallway, what I see makes my blood run cold.</p><p>\u201cEmma? Baby, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d I ask, racing over to where she lies on her back on the carpet in the middle of the room with her eyes closed.</p><p>I fall to the floor next to her, grabbing onto her face and turning her towards me. \u201cEmma, baby, come on, wake up.\u201d</p><p>When she doesn\u2019t respond, my hands start to sweat and a knot of fear makes my stomach clench. I can see her chest rising and falling so I know she\u2019s still breathing, but it doesn\u2019t make me feel any better right now. I don\u2019t know if she fainted or if something else happened and it scares the hell out of me.</p><p>\u201cELLIE!\u201d I shout, frantically running my hands over Emma\u2019s body to check for injuries before patting her cheeks, trying to get her to respond.</p><p>Glancing around the room quickly, I don\u2019t see her in the living room or the kitchen. Looking back down at Emma, I wonder if she hit her head again. Checking under the bandage on her head, I see that her stitches are still in tact and I don\u2019t see any blood. I lean down over her and start places kisses all over her face. \u201cCome on, baby, wake up.\u201d</p><p>Reaching in my pocket for my phone, I realize I left it in the bedroom.</p><p>\u201cELLIE! CALL 9-1-1!\u201d I scream, continuing to check all over Emma\u2019s body for signs of some kind of trauma.</p><p>I don\u2019t know where Ellie is and right now I don\u2019t care. I quickly slide my hands under Emma\u2019s body to pick her up off of the floor and move her to the couch. When I get my arms under her, my fingers brush against something on the floor on the other side of her. Pulling my arms out, I lean over her and see a hypodermic needle on the carpet. With a shaking hand, I pick the needle up and stare at it in confusion.</p><p>\u201cOh, Jesus. Oh my God,\u201d I whisper, tossing the needle to the ground and pulling up the sleeves of Emma\u2019s shirt to check for needle marks on her skin.</p><p>It doesn\u2019t even register in my mind that I should be questioning how in the hell a hypodermic needle found its way into this house and anywhere near my baby. The only thing going through my head is getting Emma to wake up and look at me.</p><p>Running my fingers up and down the smooth skin of her arm, I see the red mark on the outside of her upper arm and a whimper flies from my mouth. \u201cNo, no, no, come on baby, come on!\u201d</p><p>Wrapping my arms around Emma, I pull her to my body and rock back and forth, the tears falling steadily down my face as I pray for her to wake up. Maybe Brady is diabetic and never told me. Maybe that was just his insulin. Maybe she\u2019s just in shock and she\u2019ll be fine after a few minutes. It can\u2019t be anything more serious than that... it can\u2019t.</p><p>I\u2019m so busy sobbing for Emma to wake up that it doesn\u2019t even occur to me that I should be worrying about someone else bringing that needle into this apartment.</p><p>\u201cOh stop crying, she\u2019ll wake up eventually, it was just a tranquilizer.\u201d</p><p>Too late, I look up just in time to see a hand holding the heavy, crystal candy dish from the coffee table flying toward my face. I have just enough time to scream before the dish cracks against the side of my skull and everything goes black.</p><p>Chapter 29</p><p>Austin</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean they never showed up?\u201d I shout into my phone as I press down harder on the accelerator and fly through an intersection.</p><p>\u201cI mean, I just got a call from my guy at the station in Nashville and he\u2019s been waiting there for a few hours for Gwen and Ellie to show up and sign that report and they haven\u2019t come in yet,\u201d Mark tells me. \u201cI called Gwen\u2019s phone a bunch of times, but she hasn\u2019t answered. Are you sure she was still willing to do this? The charges aren\u2019t going to stick if I don\u2019t get those signed forms immediately.\u201d</p><p>I know Gwen was pissed at me about handing that file over to the police, but there\u2019s no way she would flake out on this. She was on her way out the door to head straight to the police station the last time I saw her. She\u2019s not the type of person who just wouldn\u2019t show up when someone was expecting her. If she changed her mind about filing the report, she would have called the station.</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re absolutely certain you have Stratford in your custody right now?\u201d I question him, hoping that lines weren\u2019t crossed and William somehow wasn\u2019t where he was supposed to be.</p><p>\u201cActually, we couldn\u2019t get a transfer that quickly for him to come back to New York. The department in Bowling Green did all of the questioning and video conferenced me in on it. I\u2019m sorry, Austin, but he lawyered-up and they couldn\u2019t keep him any longer since Gwen never signed the forms.\u201d</p><p>The phone almost slips from my hands at Mark\u2019s words and I have to fight to concentrate on the road while he continues talking.</p><p>\u201cThat guy is the biggest asshole I\u2019ve ever seen. He adamantly denies ever being in Nashville or having any kind of contact with Gwen or Ellie. And I hate to say this, Austin, but the guy has a solid alibi. He decided not to go to the medical conference in Chicago and went to see his parents who live out that way instead. He\u2019s been staying with them for the last week. They verified this with written statements and we also have eyewitness testimony from people who saw him out and about at different restaurants in the Bowling Green area. Even though he\u2019s a pompous jerk, I don\u2019t think he\u2019s your guy that\u2019s been stalking Gwen.\u201d</p><p>That makes no sense. It can\u2019t be right. Who the hell else would have done those things to Gwen? She didn\u2019t imagine any of that shit. If it wasn\u2019t Stratford trying to get under her skin, then who the fuck was it? It\u2019s not just a coincidence that Gwen can\u2019t be reached now that he\u2019s no longer in police custody.</p><p>\u201cHe tried denying ever laying a hand on Gwen throughout their marriage until we threw that file you sent us down on the table in front of him. His face went completely white and I thought for sure he was going to throw up all over the table. His lawyer wouldn\u2019t let him say another word,\u201d Mark finishes.</p><p>\u201cSomething isn\u2019t right, Mark. Gwen would never be a no-show. How long has it been since they let Stratford go?\u201d I demand.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, maybe a few hours? Stratford\u2019s lawyer told us he\u2019d make sure to escort him immediately back to New York,\u201d Mark explains.</p><p>\u201cAnd you seriously fucking believed him? He\u2019s been out on the loose for the same amount of time that Gwen hasn\u2019t been able to be reached. That\u2019s not a Goddamn coincidence. I\u2019m going to her place now. Call your guy in Nashville and give him a head\u2019s up,\u201d I tell him as I change directions and head to Brady\u2019s apartment.</p><p>\u201cThis lawyer is a top notch guy. There\u2019s no way he\u2019d let Stratford out of his sight.\u201d</p><p>I scoff at Mark as I screech through another intersection. \u201cYou said so yourself \u2013 money talks and Stratford has a shit ton of it. Who the fuck knows how many people he\u2019s got in his pocket doing his dirty work?\u201d</p><p>Mark curses and I hear him shouting orders through the line. \u201cWe\u2019re calling Nashville now and the lawyer. Call me as soon as you get to her place,\u201d Mark informs me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ending the call, I weave in and out of traffic, hoping that this is all just a misunderstanding and Gwen and Emma are safe at home. Something doesn\u2019t feel right about any of this though and I\u2019m scared to death that they won\u2019t be there. Even though I don\u2019t like the guy, my gut is telling me Dylan doesn\u2019t have anything to do with this. Better to be safe than sorry and needing to cross one last suspect off of my list, I scroll through my phone and find his contact information that I programmed there just in case when he stopped by the office.</p><p>\u201cDylan Callahan,\u201d he answers.</p><p>\u201cCallahan, it\u2019s Conrad. Have you talked to Gwen at all today?\u201d I ask him as I pull into Brady\u2019s parking lot and find a spot right in front of the building.</p> <p>\u201cYeah, she called earlier and apologized for you, saying you never told her I showed up looking for her. I guess I should have expected that. You looked like you wanted to rip my head off when I told you we had plans to meet while I was in town,\u201d he says with a laugh.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d say I\u2019m sorry, but I\u2019m not,\u201d I tell him as I get out of my car and race into the building. \u201cAre you still in town? I think something might have happened to Gwen and I need your help.\u201d</p><p>Deciding to skip waiting for the elevator, I take the stairs two at a time.</p><p>\u201cJesus Christ, are you serious? No, I finished the job early and just left this morning, but I\u2019m only a few hours away, I\u2019ll turn around now and head back,\u201d Dylan promises. \u201cI\u2019ll call the chief at the Nashville PD too, he owes me a favor.\u201d</p><p>Even though this guy was most likely going to make a move on Gwen when he was in town, something tells me to trust him right now. I have a feeling I\u2019m going to need all the help I can get.</p> <p>I end the call with Dylan right when I get to Brady\u2019s door. Sticking my key in the lock, the door pops open before I even have a chance to turn the key. Dread overwhelms me as I push the door open and walk inside the apartment. Gwen would never leave her door unlocked, even if she was home.</p><p>Before I even have a chance to call her name, something on the floor in the middle of the room catches my eye. Rushing over to it, I bend down and see the ugly glass candy dish Brady had on his coffee table. Picking it up, my heart skips a beat when I see blood caked on the side of it. Even though I want to hurl the dish across the room in fury, I quickly set it back down where it was in case the police can dust it for fingerprints.</p><p>Standing up, I take off running through the rest of the apartment, calling for Gwen and Emma as I check each room. I know it\u2019s silly, I know they aren\u2019t here, but I have to do something. I keep having a fleeting thought that I\u2019ll open up a closet door and they\u2019ll both be in there laughing because they pulled a prank on me. It\u2019s the dumbest fucking thought in the world, but I can\u2019t stop hoping it will be true as I fling open the last door and find it empty.</p><p>As I run back out into the living room, my boot crunches down on something I must not have noticed when I first got here. Lifting up my foot, I see a broken needle crushed into the carpet and the airport food I had earlier threatens to come up.</p><p>No, no, no... this can\u2019t be happening.</p><p>I stare in horror at the hypodermic needle broken in half. I feel like I\u2019m living in a nightmare. I thought Gwen and Emma were safe. I left because I was sure they\u2019d be okay and now look what happened? Stratford hurt them; he took them and I\u2019m scared to death I may never see them again so I can tell them what an idiot I was. I should have told Gwen I loved her; I should have told Emma I had no idea how to be her dad, but that I hope she would give me a chance and teach me how. Right now, I would sit in a room filled with a thousand pink Barbies if it meant Emma was sitting next to me and I could hear her laugh.</p> <p>Hearing the sounds of police sirens outside, I\u2019m thankful that at least Dylan came through with help. We have to find them; they have to be okay. I\u2019ve been on plenty of missions that didn\u2019t go according to plan and lives were lost, but right now, failure is not an option. These girls are my whole life. If anything happens to them, I\u2019ll never forgive myself.</p><p>Chapter 30</p><p>Gwen</p><p>I can\u2019t believe what a fool I\u2019ve been. I let my guard down for the first time in months and now I\u2019m going to pay the ultimate price \u2013 the one person in my world that I love more than my own life will be taken from me in the blink of an eye because of my stupidity. I did everything I could to keep Emma safe; I hid, I lied and I worked my fingers to the bone, but it was all for nothing. This precious little being that came screaming into my world six years ago and gave me a reason to breathe every single day since then \u2013 I had failed her.</p><p>I watch in horror as my baby struggles to breathe through the tears and the thick, silver tape over her mouth. Her muffled whimpers are like a knife straight through my heart and I fight with everything inside of me to get loose from the bindings holding me in place. I scream and cry with a pain I\u2019ve never felt before as I try so hard to get free. The ropes cut into my wrists and ankles as I twist and turn, thrash and fight. I need to go to her, I need to wrap my arms around her and calm her fears, tell her everything will be okay, but I can\u2019t. How does a mother sit tied to a chair on the other side of the room from her child and just watch her suffer? The years of mental and physical abuse, broken bones and shattered spirit are nothing compared to this.</p><p>\u201cYou just couldn\u2019t leave well enough alone, could you? We were supposed to be a family and you ruined it all.\u201d</p><p>A fist connects with my cheek and for a moment, I close my eyes to ward off the pain. I don\u2019t have time to wallow in my own self-pity though. I quickly blink my eyes back into focus and my gaze immediately goes to my little one across the room, staring at me wide-eyed. My pain means nothing right now; the only thing that matters to me is making sure Emma is okay. It\u2019s been just the two of us against the world for months now. I had my brother, and I had Austin, but it\u2019s not the same. Their love doesn\u2019t even hold a candle to the love between a mother and daughter. There\u2019s a piece of my heart living and breathing outside of my body and for six years it\u2019s been the most amazing miracle to watch her grow and change. Now, I realize just how fragile that piece of my heart is; I can\u2019t protect her and I can\u2019t save her. I don\u2019t want her to see how scared I am, but I can do nothing to stop the sobs from escaping.</p><p>The fear and sadness I see on my daughter\u2019s beautiful, perfect little face makes my stomach cramp and hurts worse than any blow I\u2019ve ever taken to my body. I\u2019m accustomed to the agony and humiliation of abuse. I\u2019ve learned how to shut down my mind and my heart and pretend like it wasn\u2019t really happening to me, but Emma was never supposed to witness this horror. She was never supposed to know how weak I really am. I did everything I could to shield her from this awfulness \u2013 I fled in the middle of the night with nothing but the clothes on our backs, I made a new life for us and I showered my girl with enough love to make up for the missing parent in her life.</p> <p>I should have realized you could never outrun your past. It always has a way of catching up with you. My past and my present have collided and nothing will be able to heal the wounds from this devastation.</p><p>For a brief moment, I wish Austin was here. I tried so hard not to love him, not to trust him, but it was impossible. He was full of life and made me want things I knew I could never have. He made me promises I should have known he wouldn\u2019t keep and he made me want in things I had no business dreaming of. I should have known he\u2019d run the first chance he got. I always trusted the wrong people and it always came back to bite me in the ass.</p><p>\u201cYou took everything from me. I had a plan. It was going to be perfect.\u201d</p><p>I look at the person standing in front of me and can\u2019t believe this is really happening. When I was so frantically trying to get Emma to wake up earlier, I assumed Ellie had finally had enough and left to go back to New York without telling me. I didn\u2019t even notice that we weren\u2019t alone in the apartment. I didn\u2019t anticipate that someone I\u2019ve trusted my entire life would turn on me.</p><p>When I came to a little while ago, my head hurt so bad I thought I would throw up. I could feel blood dripping down the side of my face and knew from experience that I had a concussion. When I tried to reach up to wipe the blood off of my face, I realized I was tied to a chair. A whimper from across the room made my heart clench in fear and when I looked up, I saw Emma tied to a chair much like I was.</p><p>Soon after, the nightmare grew increasingly worse with each word that was spoken and each punch I took to my face and body when my answers weren\u2019t the ones expected. I don\u2019t know what to do; I don\u2019t know what to say to make this nightmare end. My heart shatters as I think about how we got here.</p><p>My eyes flew open and I ignored the pain in my head and the person standing in front of me with a gun aimed in my direction as I quickly scanned the apartment in search of Emma.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Emma? She\u2019s hurt. What did you do with her?\u201d I asked angrily, pressing a hand to my aching head.</p><p>I had to push aside the shock and confusion that filled my mind. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on and I don\u2019t care what happened to me. All that mattered was making sure Emma was okay. I am not the same weak, defenseless woman this person used to know. I am a fighter and I will fight to the death for my child.</p><p>\u201cEmma is tied up in the back of my car so don\u2019t think about doing anything stupid or I\u2019ll just shoot you now without letting you say good-bye,\u201d I was told as my arm was suddenly grabbed and I was pulled roughly up from the couch.</p><p>Maybe it was a lie. I couldn\u2019t believe this person would ever hurt Emma.</p><p>My head throbbed and my vision swam as I was dragged through the apartment and out the front door, the gun shoved roughly against my side.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you doing this?\u201d I demanded as I was pushed down the stairs and out the door into the parking lot.</p><p>Everything in me told me to run and scream for help. As soon as we got to the car though and I saw Emma with tape over her mouth and rope around her wrists and ankles, slumped against the door in the backseat, thoughts of causing a scene escaped from my mind and all I could think about was getting to my baby.</p><p>I flung open the back door and scrambled inside, sobbing as I pulled Emma onto my lap and started to remove her bindings.</p><p>The feel of hard metal against the back of my skull halted my movements and my hands froze.</p><p>\u201cPut her down and get in the front seat or I\u2019ll shoot you both right now.\u201d</p><p>If I were alone, I would have turned around and knocked the gun away. I would have put all of those self-defense videos Brady made me watch over and over after I moved here to good use and fought. But I\u2019m not alone. If something went wrong, my daughter could be caught in the crossfire. I had no choice but to do what was asked.</p><p>With a tearful kiss to the top of Emma\u2019s head, I gently laid her down on the seat and backed out of the car, moving to the front as the gun remained on me.</p><p>The entire drive to downtown was quiet. No matter how many questions I asked, they were refused an answer. When we pulled into the back parking lot behind Brady\u2019s office and I was forced towards the stairs of the walk-in basement to the abandoned restaurant next door, I tried to fight since Emma was still in the backseat of the car and out of harms way. I punched, I hit, I kicked \u2013 whatever I could do to try and change the outcome of this nightmare. I didn\u2019t care that there was a gun aimed at me, I didn\u2019t care if I was too weak to do any real damage, I had to try. In the middle of the scuffle, right when I thought I might get the upper hand, I lost my footing and was shoved down the hard, concrete steps. I landed at the bottom right on top of my bad arm. As soon as I heard the snap of bones breaking in my already fragile arm and the pain shot through me, I lost my battle with consciousness.</p><p>I don\u2019t know how long we\u2019ve been down here in this wine cellar, but I hope to God it\u2019s long enough for someone to be looking for us. I hate that my blind trust has put my daughter in harm\u2019s way. If anything else happens to her I\u2019ll never be able to forgive myself. She is the one perfect thing in my life and I can\u2019t stand the thought of what she must be thinking and feeling right now. She trusted me to keep her safe and I couldn\u2019t do it.</p><p>Austin would tell me to stop being such a damn martyr and suck it up. I hate that my thoughts immediately go to him when he walked away without a backwards glance. I wish he would have trusted me as much as I did him; I wish he would have known that I would take any part of him he could spare, just as long as he promised to come back to us when his job was finished.</p><p>My whole body aches and my spirit deflates as I stare across the room at my baby and come to the realization that we might not get out of this basement alive. The damage done to my arm when I was pushed down the stairs has left it completely useless. I can\u2019t even wiggle my fingers and any type of movement in my body, no matter how slight, is enough to have me seeing stars and swallowing down bile. The pain of having it pulled behind me and tied to a chair is so acute that I don\u2019t know how much more I can take before I pass out again. I force myself to smile at my girl and give her hope, even though I\u2019ve lost all of mine.</p><p>Chapter 31</p><p>Austin</p><p>\u201cYou son of a bitch! You had one fucking job. One job and that was to keep them safe!\u201d</p><p>I look up as the door to the apartment crashes open and Brady charges across the room at me. His fist slams into my cheek and I don\u2019t even bother fighting back when he punches me again. I\u2019m perfectly fine with letting him beat the shit out of me, but the police officers that fill the room have other ideas. They pull him off of me and drag him back over by the door as I cradle my jaw in my hand.</p><p>\u201cGod dammit, let me go! Let me fucking go!\u201d Brady shouts as he fights against their hold, his eyes wild and full of anger. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Dylan steps over to Brady and grabs onto the front of his shirt, yanking him close. \u201cDude, reel it the fuck in. I know you\u2019re pissed, but beating the hell out of one of your best friends isn\u2019t going to help Gwen and Emma. Calm your ass down right now.\u201d</p><p>Brady takes a couple of deep breaths and his shoulders sag, the fight finally leaving him. The three men holding onto him finally let go and step away when they realize he\u2019s calmed down. As they head into the kitchen with the rest of the team that have set up a make-shift command center at the table, Brady looks across the room at me, the disappointment on his face crystal clear and I completely lose it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m so fucking sorry,\u201d I tell him brokenly, my legs giving out as I slide down the wall into a heap on the floor.</p> <p>I let my best friend down and I let Gwen and Emma down. They weren\u2019t a job; they were more than a job. For the first time in my life, I don\u2019t know what the fuck to do. I don\u2019t know how to fix this. I\u2019m crawling out of my skin with fear and worry and now that Brady\u2019s here it makes everything worse. He trusted me to keep his family safe and I failed him.</p><p>Brady walks across the room to me and I\u2019m more than a little shocked that he slides down the wall to sit next to me instead of kicking my ass some more. Closing my eyes, I let my head thump back against the wall and we sit there in silence for a few minutes.</p><p>\u201cNext to Layla, they\u2019re my whole life, man,\u201d Brady says quietly. I keep my eyes closed as he talks, knowing if I look at him I\u2019m going to start crying like a fucking baby. \u201cI was the shittiest brother in the world. As soon as I turned eighteen I got the fuck out of dodge and left her alone there with our parents. I had no idea that asshole she married would turn out to be a monster. I had no idea what he\u2019d been doing to her all those years because I chose to shut her out. It was easier that way. It made me feel less guilty for leaving. And then one night she showed up on my doorstep with her arm in a cast, broken ribs and a black and blue face looking so small and helpless with Emma by her side and I knew right then and there that I would never let her down again.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t want to hear this, but I have to. It\u2019s my fault that Gwen was let down again. It\u2019s my fault that she\u2019s in danger.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. Jesus Christ I\u2019m so sorry,\u201d I mutter.</p> <p>\u201cWill you stop saying you\u2019re fucking sorry? It\u2019s not your fault.\u201d</p><p>I finally open my eyes and look at Brady in confusion.</p><p>He just rolls his head at me. \u201cI\u2019m scared out of my mind and I lost my temper, that\u2019s all. It would have happened even if I\u2019d been here. There\u2019s nothing you could have done to keep that fucker away from them. There\u2019s nothing either of us could have done.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head in denial. \u201cI left them, man. I just walked away. I got a call from Risner and I bolted. I thought it was best, I didn\u2019t want her to have any more baggage than she already did and we both know I\u2019ve got enough to fill a thousand suitcases.\u201d</p><p>Brady studies my face and after a few seconds he curses. \u201cGod dammit. You slept with her didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>At this point it\u2019s probably best not to answer him. My jaw still hurts from his punches and even though I deserve more, I\u2019m not in the mood for them right now.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re lucky I didn\u2019t know that when I first walked in here or your face would be a pile of ground meat right now,\u201d Brady mutters. \u201cWhat do the police know so far?\u201d</p><p>I fill him in what I found when I got here and how once the police arrived and they bagged up the needle and the dish, we started going over all of the information I\u2019d been collecting the past few weeks. Right before Brady got here, Mark called to tell me that Stratford\u2019s lawyer wasn\u2019t answering his phone so the two men were still MIA and another BOLO was issued for both of them.</p><p>\u201cWhat about Ellie?\u201d Brady asks when I finish.</p><p>\u201cSame. Calls to her phone are going unanswered so they\u2019re assuming Stratford has all three of them. Her car isn\u2019t in the parking lot so he must have taken them in it. The cops have her license plate and the description of her car and they\u2019re on the lookout for it now. They also put a call in to her parents back in New York and they haven\u2019t heard from her in a couple of days. They were surprised to hear she was in Nashville, she never told them she was going out of town,\u201d I explain to him.</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of calls, sorry for not returning the messages you left me right away. Living on a tour bus is fucking insane and who knows what city I lost my phone in,\u201d Brady tells me in irritation.</p><p>One of the officers comes into the living room from the hall with a cell phone in his hand. \u201cHey, we found this cell phone in the back bedroom. Anybody know who it belongs to?\u201d</p><p>Brady and I look up and Brady is the first to speak. \u201cYeah, that\u2019s Gwen\u2019s. Guess we know why it hasn\u2019t been answered all day.\u201d</p><p>Brady reaches for it, but I quickly push myself up from the ground and grab it out of the officer\u2019s hand. Something Gwen said to me the day Emma got hurt and I took her to the hospital nags at the back of my mind.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s weird, I didn\u2019t have any missed calls from you. Something must be wrong with my phone.\u201d</p><p>Brady stands up next to me as I quickly scan through all of her missed calls from that day. Not finding any from my phone to Gwen\u2019s from the time I was busy driving like a maniac to get Emma to the hospital, I pull out my own phone from my back pocket and search the outgoing call log. My heart fills with dread when I don\u2019t see one call made to Gwen\u2019s phone that day.</p><p>\u201cJust got a call from New York. Stratford and his lawyer just landed at LaGuardia so that\u2019s why the calls to him went unanswered. They\u2019ve been at the airport since they left the station earlier, we just confirmed it with the airlines,\u201d one of the officers shouts from the kitchen.</p><p>So Stratford couldn\u2019t have been the one to do this. Everything starts to quickly click into place. How could I have never thought it was odd that Ellie showed back up in Gwen\u2019s life right when strange things started happening to her?</p><p>\u201cSon of a bitch!\u201d I shout, shoving Gwen\u2019s phone back into the officer\u2019s hand and stalking towards the door where I left my go-back when I brought it in right before Brady got here. Reaching inside, I grab my 9mm and check to make sure it\u2019s loaded. I know exactly who has my girls and it fills me with rage. All this time the person we should have been looking at was right in front of our faces. Shoving my gun into my back waistband and turning around to face the room full of men with questions on their faces.</p><p>\u201cI know who has them and I think I know where they might be.\u201d</p><p>The place is suddenly a flurry of activity as phone calls are made and everyone scrambles around checking their weapons and making a plan.</p><p>\u201cI hope you\u2019re right about this, I need my girls back,\u201d Brady tells me as we rush out of the building.</p><p>Sliding behind the wheel of my SUV as Brady hops into the passenger seat, I look over at him before pulling out of the parking lot. \u201cNo, we need our girls back.\u201d</p><p>I peel out onto the street forcing another driver to slam on their brakes to make way for me.</p><p>Brady sighs as he grabs tightly to the door handle. \u201cWe\u2019ll discuss that later.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 32</p><p>Gwen</p><p>Ellie stalks over to Emma and rips the tape off of her mouth and I cringe as Emma cries out in pain.</p><p>\u201cPlease, don\u2019t do this! You love her, I know you love her. I\u2019m sorry the things I did hurt you, but please, don\u2019t take it out on her.\u201d</p><p>I can feel layers of my skin being ripped to shreds as I continue to use every ounce of strength left in me to get free. Blood drips down my palms and off the tips of my fingers to pool on the floor as the woman I spent my life trusting aims a gun at Emma\u2019s chest.</p><p>Oh God, this can\u2019t be happening. I can\u2019t live in a world where she doesn\u2019t exist.</p><p>\u201cWilliam should have been mine from the beginning,\u201d Ellie growls at me angrily as she starts waving the gun around. \u201cDid you know I saw him first that night at the charity event? We danced and we laughed and he asked me out to dinner. Then he saw you and forgot all about me.\u201d</p><p>I look at Emma again and try to hold her frightened gaze in my own. I want her to know that everything will be okay, but I don\u2019t know if it will. For the first time since she was born, I don\u2019t know how to protect her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Ellie, I had no idea. Just put the gun down and we can talk about it,\u201d I plead with her.</p><p>Ellie laughs manically and shakes her head at me. \u201cI\u2019m so sick and tired of talking to you. You think you\u2019re so much better than me. You get the man I was supposed to have and you get the daughter that was supposed to be mine. I thought once you finally left William that he and I could finally be together, but all he did was talk about you and his stupid, perfect little girl for the first month. I figured if you thought he was stalking you, you\u2019d be so preoccupied that I could come in and take Emma so that William and I could be a family. You had to go running to someone, didn\u2019t you? As soon as Austin started sticking his nose into everything, my plan went to shit.\u201d</p><p>After everything that\u2019s happened today, you would think that nothing Ellie says would surprise me, but that\u2019s not the case. She was the one behind the mugs and the letter and the flowers. All along it was Ellie terrorizing me, not William.</p><p>\u201cAnd you thought this was a better plan? What are you going to do now, Ellie? Do you honestly think you can take Emma away right now after everything you\u2019ve done?\u201d I shout.</p><p>Ellie paces back and forth in front of Emma and I want nothing more than for her to move away from my baby. I want her to focus on me and not my daughter.</p><p>\u201cI changed my mind, I don\u2019t want her after all. I mean, William didn\u2019t even want her anymore either. Did you know he was going to give you sole custody? He wanted the two of us to start fresh. I figured he would regret it so I wanted to surprise him by bringing his daughter back to him. But she\u2019s more trouble than she\u2019s worth. She used to be sweet when she was younger. She\u2019s spent too much time alone with you and now she has your attitude.\u201d</p><p>Emma looks up at Ellie and frowns. \u201cI don\u2019t like you anymore, Aunt Ellie, you\u2019re mean.\u201d</p><p>Ellie looks at her in disgust and rolls her eyes. \u201cSee what I mean? That child doesn\u2019t know her place. William could have taught her a thing or two about manners.\u201d</p><p>The idea that Ellie actually thinks having William discipline Emma in his own way is a good idea makes me sick. I need to keep her talking; I need to get her away from Emma.</p><p>\u201cWhat about your black eye and busted lip? Was William trying to teach you some manners?\u201d I ask her sarcastically.</p><p>I\u2019d rather she be mad at me than Emma. I\u2019ll take a hundred more punches as long as she leaves Emma alone.</p><p>\u201cWilliam was never here, you idiot. I did that to myself with the television remote from the hotel. He had no idea I was in Nashville, he\u2019s been visiting his parents for the last week,\u201d Ellie informs me, stepping away from Emma.</p><p>\u201cHey, Aunt Ellie!\u201d Emma shouts.</p><p>Ellie whips around and I shake my head frantically, trying to tell Emma to be quiet and not bring any attention to herself, but she doesn\u2019t notice.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Ellie asks in annoyance.</p><p>\u201cWhen Austin gets here, he\u2019s going to put you in jail with the bad Barbies,\u201d Emma tells her proudly.</p><p>I sob as Ellie walks closer to her. \u201cEllie, please!\u201d</p><p>Ellie ignores me as she squats down in front of Emma\u2019s chair. \u201cYour knight in shining armor doesn\u2019t give two shits about you, kiddo.\u201d</p><p>Ellie stands up and the click of a bullet being released into the chamber of her gun echoes around the room. Ellie points the gun at Emma again and stares right at her as she throws one last threat my way. \u201cNow it\u2019s your turn to lose it all.\u201d</p><p>I hold Emma\u2019s gaze in my own and try to tell her with my eyes how much I love her and how sorry I am. With a sinking feeling of dread that makes me nauseous, I know our time is up. There\u2019s nothing I can do now but pray that death happens quickly and painlessly for my beautiful baby girl \u2013 and that this asshole will show a tiny bit of mercy and put me out of my misery soon after.</p><p>Ellie starts to turn her head in my direction when Emma brings her attention back around with another statement. \u201cAustin will save us.\u201d</p><p>Emma opens her mouth and screams at the top of her lungs while Ellie stares at her in confusion.</p><p>The explosion of a gun going off happens without warning and I let out a blood-curdling scream.</p><p>Chapter 33</p><p>Austin</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re sure about this?\u201d Brady asks as we pull up to the front of the building.</p><p>\u201cGwen mentioned to me that she and Ellie talked about the old restaurant next to your office. Ellie isn\u2019t familiar with Nashville and the police already checked the two hotels where she\u2019s been staying. I can\u2019t think of any other place she would have taken them,\u201d I explain to him as we get out of my vehicle and head to the front door.</p><p>One of the officers comes running up from the back of building. \u201cWe got a positive on Ellie Larson\u2019s vehicle packed around back.\u201d</p><p>I turn towards Brady. \u201cWhat\u2019s the layout of this place? Should we go in the same way she did or try the front?\u201d</p><p>Brady looks up and down the sidewalk, thinking for a minute. \u201cThere\u2019s a walk-up basement that leads right into the wine cellar. If she parked back there, that\u2019s probably where she\u2019s keeping them. We won\u2019t be able to sneak up on them if we go through the back. I think we should go in through the front and take the stairs located off the bar. When you get to the bottom of the stairs, there\u2019s a long hallway that opens up to the cellar. That way we\u2019ll at least be able to get a bead on the situation first and go from there.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sending the rest of the officers around back in case Ellie tries to run, Brady and I make our way alone into the empty restaurant. Creeping quietly around boxes and overturned tables and chairs, I lead the way down into the basement.</p><p>Brady and I have done this a thousand times together. We\u2019ve walked into dangerous situations not being able to speak and make our presence known. We\u2019ve learned how to communicate with hand signals and one single look to tell the other what we should do, but this time is different. This time, people we love are depending on us to not make any mistakes. The only looks that pass back and forth between us right now are ones of worry and fear.</p><p>Stepping down off the bottom step, we stick to the wall of the hallway as we quietly make our way closer to the wine cellar. I pull my gun out of its holster at my back when I hear voices at the far end of the hallway. My heart jumps into my throat when I hear Gwen\u2019s sobs and it takes everything in me not to take off running the rest of the way to get to her as fast as I can. I can hear Brady\u2019s labored breathing behind me and I know he\u2019s feeling the exact same way as I am.</p> <p>I inch closer to the end of the hallway, trying to ignore the sounds of Gwen pleading and crying. When I get to the doorway that opens up into the main room, I slowly peer around the corner and the sight before me takes my breath away. Gwen is tied to a chair with her back to me and Emma is across the room from her, tied up in a similar manner. All of my SEAL training disappears and the only thing I want to do is scream in rage and do whatever it takes to get my girls away from the woman holding a gun on them. I have to swallow back the terror that will have me doing something irrational and getting them hurt worse. I need to be smart about this and remain calm.</p><p>Tearing my eyes away from the painful scene, I take a step back and whisper as quietly as I can to Brady. \u201cThey\u2019re both tied up. Ellie has a gun on Emma.\u201d</p><p>Even in the dark hallway I can see the same fury I\u2019m feeling wash over his face. He clenches his jaw and takes a few calming breaths before nodding once.</p><p>Turning away from him, I move forward a little more until I can slowly creep around the corner and into the room, careful not to alert Ellie that anyone else is here with them. The movement catches Emma\u2019s eye from across the room and I quickly raise a finger to my mouth when she looks at me, hoping she won\u2019t give my position away to Ellie before I\u2019m ready.</p><p>Just then, Ellie starts to turn away from Emma and I know she\u2019ll see me. I won\u2019t have time to back up and hide before that happens and I begin to panic.</p> <p>\u201cHey, Aunt Ellie!\u201d Emma yells suddenly.</p><p>I hold my breath as I watch Ellie quickly turn back towards Emma and I begin to move forward a little more. I need a clear shot at Ellie and I need her away from Emma to do that.</p><p>\u201cWhen Austin gets here, he\u2019s going to put you in jail with the bad Barbies,\u201d Emma tells Ellie confidently with a raise of her chin.</p><p>If I weren\u2019t scared out of my fucking mind right now I would laugh at Emma\u2019s assurance and bravery. Ellie moves closer to Emma and I take another step until I\u2019m a few feet behind Gwen. I want to whisper to her that I\u2019m right here and that I\u2019m not going to let anything happen to either one of them, but I have to remain quiet. I can hear Gwen sobbing and it rips a hole right through my heart.</p><p>Ellie mutters something to Emma and stands up, loading a bullet in place before pointing the gun right at her.</p><p>\u201cNow it\u2019s your turn to lose it all,\u201d Ellie states angrily as she begins to turn in my direction.</p> <p>God dammit! She\u2019s still too close to Emma. I can\u2019t risk taking the shot now and there\u2019s nothing I can do before Ellie sees me standing here.</p><p>As my brain goes through every single scenario and the possible outcomes, each one worse than the last, Emma speaks up again. \u201cAustin will save us.\u201d</p><p>Right then, this brave little girl looks directly at me and smiles before opening her mouth and screaming for all she\u2019s worth. It\u2019s enough of a distraction that Ellie moves back away from Emma a few feet and I have a clear shot at her. I pull the trigger, hitting Ellie in the shoulder. Her body flies backwards and the gun falls from her hand as she drops to the floor.</p><p>Gwen\u2019s terrified screams fill the room and I quickly rush to her, tossing my gun to the ground as I bend down in front of her and grab her face with my hands. Brady rushes past me to Emma\u2019s side and the police officers that were waiting just outside of the walk-up door come charging down the stairs. Within seconds they have Ellie surrounded with their guns pointed at her while Brady quickly unties Emma, muttering words of love and praise to her the entire time.</p><p>\u201cBaby, it\u2019s okay, it\u2019s all over, look at me,\u201d I plead to Gwen.</p><p>With a sob, Gwen opens her eyes, her head moving to the side to look around me at Emma. She\u2019s having a hard time taking in air as she continues to cry while I let go of her face and get the ropes off of her. She needs medical attention immediately. She\u2019s got a gash in her hairline that is steadily dripping blood down the side of her face and I know immediately the cause for the blood on the crystal dish I found in the apartment.</p><p>As soon as Gwen is free from the ropes, she stands quickly, but her legs give out from under her and she starts to fall. I wrap my arms around her and hold her steady as Emma is finally freed and races over to us.</p><p>\u201cOh God, oh baby, I\u2019m so sorry, I\u2019m so sorry,\u201d Gwen sobs as I help her down to the ground so she can wrap her arms around Emma.</p> <p>I have to choke back tears as Gwen holds tightly to Emma and rocks her back and forth. With my arm around Gwen\u2019s waist, I reach my hand up and smooth it down the back of Emma\u2019s head as she squeezes tight to her mother.</p><p>\u201cDid I do a good diversion, Austin?\u201d Emma suddenly asks, lifting her head from Gwen\u2019s shoulder and smiling at me.</p><p>I don\u2019t even bother fighting the tears at this point, I let them fall from my eyes as I lean over and kiss the top of Emma\u2019s head. \u201cYou did so good baby, I\u2019m so proud of you.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a flurry of activity around us as paramedics storm down into the basement and begin loading Ellie up on a stretcher while Brady shouts orders to everyone. One of the paramedics squats down next to us and starts looking over Gwen and Emma and I\u2019m not about to let go of either one of them so he better not expect me to or I\u2019ll kick his ass.</p><p>\u201cI knew you\u2019d come and save us, Austin. You\u2019re a soldier and you told me soldier\u2019s never leave a man behind,\u201d Emma tells me proudly. \u201cI know me and mommy aren\u2019t men, but I knew you wouldn\u2019t leave us behind.\u201d</p><p>Resting my forehead against Emma\u2019s, I close my eyes and thank God for this little girl. \u201cYou are so smart and so brave, Emma. You are the best soldier I\u2019ve ever worked with.\u201d</p><p>I hear Gwen moan softly and I turn to look at her and see that her eyes are starting to flutter closed.</p><p>\u201cMa\u2019am, we need to get you to the hospital right away,\u201d the paramedic tells Gwen, wrapping his arms around her and helping her to her feet.</p><p>Taking Emma out of Gwen\u2019s arms, I lift her up as I stand and Brady rushes over, helping the paramedic get Gwen to another stretcher.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to leave my daughter, please,\u201d Gwen begs as she\u2019s pushed back onto the stretcher and strapped in.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Gwen, I\u2019ve got her. We\u2019re going to be right here with you the entire time,\u201d I tell her, shooting the paramedic a threatening look in case he decides to argue and tell me that we can\u2019t ride in the ambulance. The man smartly smiles at me and nods.</p><p>Emma wraps her arms around my neck and I hold her close to me, wondering how in the hell I ever thought I could walk away from her and never feel her hugs again.</p><p>The paramedics lift the stretcher and lock the legs into place as Brady leans down and places a kiss on Gwen\u2019s forehead.</p><p>\u201cYou took ten years off my life today, little sis,\u201d he whispers.</p><p>\u201cGood, you were starting to look old as shit,\u201d Gwen mumbles.</p><p>\u201cYeah, she\u2019s going to be just fine,\u201d Brady says with a laugh.</p><p>When they get Gwen up the stairs and into the back of the ambulance, I climb inside with Emma in my arms and set her down in my lap on the bench along the side as Brady slides in next to us. The ambulance siren screams as the vehicle starts up and speeds out of the parking lot and the paramedic starts an I.V. in Gwen\u2019s arm.</p><p>I try to keep my fears at bay as I look Gwen over and all of the bruises and blood that mark her beautiful face.</p><p>Leaning forward with Emma in my arms, I kiss the top of Gwen\u2019s head as she fights to stay conscious.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Gwen, do you hear me? I love you so fucking much,\u201d I whisper in her ear.</p><p>\u201cAustin!\u201d Emma scolds, holding her small hand out in between us.</p><p>\u201cYou know what, how about I just write you a check for college?\u201d I ask as Brady chuckles next to me.</p><p>Gwen doesn\u2019t say a word, but I see a small smile tug at the corner of her mouth before she loses her battle and passes out.</p><p>Epilogue</p><p>Austin</p><p>Three months later...</p><p>My boots crunch through the snow on the sidewalk as I make my way to the front door and stick my key in the lock. As I quietly push the door open, I\u2019m met with the sight of a huge Christmas tree lit up in the corner of the room and stockings hung by the fireplace. I smile to myself as I close the door behind me, dropping my go-bag on the floor and kicking my boots off.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you even think of leaving your stuff there on the floor, I just cleaned the house.\u201d</p><p>Looking up, I can\u2019t stop the huge grin that spreads across my face when I see Gwen standing at the end of the hallway wearing nothing but one of my dress shirts with her arms folded, giving me a dirty look. I\u2019ve only been gone two weeks, but it felt like a lifetime. I never really cared much about going home in between missions before, perfectly fine with moving right on to something else without any down time, but things are different now.</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m home two days early, darlin\u2019, doesn\u2019t that earn me a few brownie points?\u201d I ask.</p><p>I watch as Gwen tries to keep a stern face, but quickly loses the battle. She lets out a squeal and races across the room. I have just enough time to brace myself as she throws herself into my arms and wraps her legs around my waist. Holding her tightly to me, I bury my face in the side of her neck and breathe her in while she runs her fingers through my hair. I was an asshole for ever thinking I could live without this woman. It\u2019s been a tough road getting to where we are now, but every single day has been worth it.</p><p>After a few days in the hospital to repair her arm from that day in the wine cellar three months ago, Gwen went through a really hard time, understandably. She couldn\u2019t stand to have Emma out of her sight for more than a few seconds at a time and after so many years of trying to be strong all on her own, it finally took its toll on her and she broke down. All I wanted to do was hold onto her and never let her go, try to make everything better, but she didn\u2019t want to have anything to do with me. She hated herself for allowing Ellie to fool her and she hated me even more for being the one to help rescue her and Emma when I had left them without looking back. She\u2019d tried for so long to be strong and independent and it killed her that once again she had to lean on someone else for help to save her.</p><p>Brady and I had been taking turns between standing watch over Gwen and being with Emma back at the apartment. I was climbing the walls and nothing made it better. If I was at the hospital holding Gwen\u2019s hand while she was under anesthesia in between surgeries, I was thinking about Emma and anxious to get home to her. If I was with Emma watching movies and tucking her in at night, I was thinking about Gwen and wishing I could be with her. Nothing would get better until both of my girls were back under the same roof and I could breathe again.</p><p>After Gwen\u2019s second surgery, I sat in my usual spot in an uncomfortable chair pulled up right next to her bed. With my elbows resting on the edge, I gently held the hand of her injured arm in both of mine, tracing the lines of her palm and talking to her softly. She had yet to wake up or give us any indication that she heard us ever since that hint of a smile in the ambulance. The doctors assured us that it was just her mind\u2019s way of healing after such a trauma, but I still didn\u2019t like it. I wanted to see her eyes, I needed to hear her voice... I just needed HER.</p><p>Five minutes before I needed to head home to relieve Brady from Emma duty, I pressed my lips to Gwen\u2019s cheek and whispered in her ear how much I loved her. When I pulled back, she was looking right at me.</p><p>\u201cOh my God it\u2019s so good to see those beautiful eyes again,\u201d I told her softly as tears pooled in my eyes.</p><p>I placed kisses all over her face, excited laughter bubbling out of me mixed with tears now that she was finally awake. I ran my hand over the top of her head, down her cheek and over her shoulder. I just couldn\u2019t stop touching her.</p><p>She didn\u2019t say anything, just continued to stare at me while I fussed over her. A few minutes later, she finally moved her uninjured hand up to her face and yanked the oxygen mask away. When she tried to speak, it came out raspy and garbled. I quickly moved to the other side of her bed and grabbed a cup of water with a straw that the nurse had placed on her bedside table earlier and held it to her lips.</p><p>After a few slow sips and a couple of coughs, she finally spoke. \u201cWhere\u2019s Emma?\u201d</p><p>I placed the cup back on the table and smiled down at her. \u201cShe\u2019s at home with Brady. We\u2019ve been taking turns being with her and being here with you. She\u2019s going to be so happy that you\u2019re awake.\u201d</p><p>I reached for her good hand, but she quickly pulled it away. I tried not to let it bother me, but I\u2019d be lying if I didn\u2019t say it hurt a little. I just wanted to pull her into my arms and tell her what an idiot I was. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI think you should go now,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>I glanced at the clock on the wall and nodded. \u201cYeah, I need to get back to Brady\u2019s place so he can have his turn up here with you.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, refusing to look at me. \u201cNo, I mean, you need to go. I don\u2019t want you here and I don\u2019t want you around Emma.\u201d</p> <p>My heart skipped a beat and I was afraid that I might start bawling like a baby if I didn\u2019t try to remain calm. She just woke up. She\u2019s confused and she\u2019s been through a lot. That was all this was.</p><p>Before I can speak and reassure her that I wasn\u2019t going anywhere ever again, she continued. \u201cYou made your choice to leave and now I\u2019m making mine. I don\u2019t want you anymore, I don\u2019t need you anymore, and my daughter sure as hell doesn\u2019t need someone like you in her life that thinks he can just walk away whenever he wants. Get. Out.\u201d</p><p>As her voice grew stronger and louder with each word, it garnered the attention of one of the nurses that was walking by. She immediately came into the room and asked Gwen if there was a problem.</p><p>Not wanting to make a scene, I walked out of the room wondering how in the hell I would ever be able to change her mind.</p><p>Even though she flat out told me not to come back, there was no fucking way I could listen to her. No matter how hard Brady and I tried to convince her that she wasn\u2019t alone and that she should lean on us, she didn\u2019t want to hear it, especially from me. In her mind, she had failed her daughter and it broke her heart.</p> <p>And it broke mine to see her like that. Everything about my life had changed the moment her and her attitude walked in the door and the first time Emma demanded that I give her money for her swear jar. It wasn\u2019t just about me anymore and about my future. The only thing I cared about was making sure these two women, who meant more to me than anything else in the world, were happy.</p><p>After Gwen got out of the hospital, I went to Brady\u2019s place every single day. And every single day, Gwen would lock herself in her bedroom and refuse to talk to me. I knew it would be hard to convince her that I wanted to be in hers and Emma\u2019s life and that I had made a horrible mistake by walking out on them, but as I\u2019ve said before, I\u2019m a Navy SEAL and we don\u2019t give up very easily.</p><p>Brady decided not to kick my ass for sleeping with his sister and instead gave me a few pointers. I knew showing up with flowers would never be a good fucking idea so instead, I just showed up.</p><p>Every day for a month.</p><p>I turned down the mission to Kuwait and took that month off to show Gwen that she couldn\u2019t get rid of me that easily. Since she wouldn\u2019t speak to me, I spent the time with Emma making sure she was healing okay from the day in the wine cellar, letting her teach me how to be a father and tucking her in every night. Eventually, Emma wouldn\u2019t let Gwen hide out in her room and forced her to interact with me. To say I was scared to death to finally talk to her is an understatement. I had so many things I wanted to say to her and I didn\u2019t want them to come out wrong. But most of all, I needed to know if she could handle a life with me. And if that\u2019s what she even wanted anymore.</p><p>As I hold Gwen in my arms and stare around my rental house at the Christmas decorations and other womanly touches that Gwen and Emma have scattered everywhere, I smile thinking about the day she finally gave in.</p> <p>Brady left a little while ago to finish up some paperwork at the office. I knew he did it to give Gwen and I some time alone together now that she\u2019s started to warm up to me a little more and I don\u2019t know whether to thank him or kick his ass. By the way Gwen is glaring at me over by the door, I\u2019m guessing she\u2019d have no problem doing the ass kicking.</p><p>\u201cThanks for tucking Emma in, you can go now,\u201d she said, pulling open the door and waiting for me to leave.</p><p>I took a deep breath and walked up to her, stopping when we were to-to-toe. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>Gwen scoffed and opened the door wider. \u201cLike I said, you can go now.\u201d</p><p>Reaching around her, I grabbed onto the door and shoved it closed. \u201cAnd like I said, I love you.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes and started to walk away from me, but I quickly grabbed her arm and pulled her against me. \u201cYou can\u2019t keep ignoring me.\u201d</p><p>She tried to struggle out of my arms, but I held tight, missing the feel of her against me so much it hurt.</p><p>\u201cOh believe me, I can definitely keep ignoring you. You can stop with the act any time. I know you have somewhere you\u2019d rather be and as you can see, Emma and I are fine now. You don\u2019t need to stick around anymore.\u201d</p> <p>She put up a brave front, but I could tell saying those words hurt her and it meant that she still had feelings for me. It gave me the courage I needed to lay it all out on the table.</p><p>\u201cFine, you can ignore me. I don\u2019t need you to talk anyway, just listen,\u201d I started. She huffed and crossed her arms between us since I refused to let go of her.</p><p>\u201cWalking away from you and Emma was the biggest mistake of my life. I didn\u2019t know until I was gone that everything I\u2019d ever wanted was right here in front of me. I was afraid. I was afraid to tell you how much I wanted you only to have you tell me that you couldn\u2019t handle a life with me because of the job I have. You and Emma are important to me, I love you both, but my job is also important. I don\u2019t want to let you and Emma down, but I also can\u2019t let my men down and I don\u2019t know how the fuck to have both. I don\u2019t know how to do this, but I want to try. I want to wake up to you every day when I\u2019m home and I want to play fucking Barbies with Emma every night before bed. I want to take away every one of your bad memories and replace them with good ones. I can\u2019t promise you when I\u2019ll be here or when I\u2019ll have to go away on a mission, but I can promise you that every second I spend with you, I will never let you forget how much you mean to me.\u201d</p><p>Gwen\u2019s eyes closed halfway through my speech and I had a moment of doubt that it was too much for her too soon. She was still healing from the nightmare of Ellie and she was knee-deep in getting the charges against William ironed out and here I was adding one more thing onto her shoulders.</p><p>After a few minutes, she looked up at me with tears in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cGod dammit,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>I figured the only way to fix this now was to backpedal. \u201cLook, I know it\u2019s a lot to take in but \u2013\u201d</p><p>My words were cut off when she unfolded her arms, grabbed onto the front of my shirt and pulled my mouth down to hers. As soon as our lips touched I was lost and forgot everything else I hadn\u2019t even told her yet. I deepened the kiss as her arms slid around my shoulders and I knew right then that no matter what, I would do everything I could to convince her that I meant what I said.</p><p>My hands slid up the back of her shirt and I groaned into her mouth as soon as I felt her smooth, warm skin. I\u2019d missed touching her so much. Being around her all these weeks and not being able to touch her was pure torture. She leaned her body into mine and forced me to walk backwards until my back slammed into the closed door, our kiss never breaking. Her palms slid down my chest until her hands found their way under the hem of my shirt and I shivered when I felt them against the skin of my stomach. I let go of her and grabbed onto her face with both of my hands, pulling her mouth away from mine so I could see her eyes.</p><p>\u201cDoes this mean you\u2019re going to start talking to me again?\u201d I whispered against her lips.</p><p>\u201cThis means I forgive you, but you\u2019re still an asshole for thinking I wouldn\u2019t understand how important your job is to you,\u201d she told me in irritation. \u201cI spent most of my life being told what to do and how to live, how could you ever think I would do that to you?\u201d</p><p>I rested my forehead against hers and closed my eyes. \u201cI know you would never try to change me, but how can you possibly be happy with a man who never knows when he\u2019ll have to leave? I can get a call in the middle of the night and be in another country by lunch time.\u201d</p><p>She pulled back and put her own hands on either side of my face, forcing me to look at her. \u201cIt\u2019s what you do. It\u2019s your job and it means everything to you. I know Emma and I do too, but it\u2019s different and I get it. We\u2019ll take any part of you we can, don\u2019t you understand that? I\u2019m not saying it won\u2019t suck sometimes, but we\u2019ve been through worse. In case you haven\u2019t noticed, we\u2019re some pretty kick ass women and I think we\u2019ll manage just fine on our own every once in a while. As long as you promise to come back to us.\u201d</p><p>Crashing my lips to hers, I pour everything I have into the kiss, letting her know that her words mean more to me than she\u2019ll ever know.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Austin,\u201d she whispered against my lips. \u201cBut if you ever do something stupid like that and walk away again, I will kick your ass.\u201d</p><p>I laughed as I pulled her against me, knowing I would do whatever it took to avoid pissing her off ever again.</p><p>With Gwen\u2019s legs still wrapped firmly around mine, I walk us over to the couch and sit down with her on my lap, straddling my legs.</p><p>Brady decided when Layla\u2019s tour was over a month ago that he was going to move out of his apartment and in with her. It only took a little bit of begging to convince Gwen to move her and Emma into my rental house until I could find something more permanent for us. Everything I\u2019ve ever wanted is here under this roof and I\u2019m never going to fuck that up again.</p><p>\u201cWelcome home, Lieutenant,\u201d she tells me with a smile as she runs her fingers through my hair.</p><p>I smile back at her when she uses my new title. Even though Captain Risner wasn\u2019t too happy about my decision to skip the mission in Kuwait, he granted my time off and surprisingly still gave me the promotion when I finally went back to work. I found out Cole was reinstated when the mess with Ellie was happening and I\u2019m pretty sure he had a hand in convincing our Captain that even though I have a family now, I could still do the job better than anyone.</p><p>Just the idea that I have a family makes my heart skip a beat as I stare up at Gwen\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I wasn\u2019t here to help you decorate the tree, but at least I made it home in time for Christmas,\u201d I tell her, sliding my hands up her bare thighs and swallowing thickly when I get to her ass and realize she\u2019s not wearing any underwear.</p><p>\u201cLucky for you, I didn\u2019t put the Barbie Dream House together yet. It\u2019s all yours, baby.\u201d</p><p>She lets out a gasp when my hand moves between her legs and my fingers slide through her sex.</p><p>\u201cLucky for Emma, I brought home a bunch of G.I. Joe guys to fill up the fucking Barbie Dream House,\u201d I tell her as I slowly push one of my fingers inside of her.</p><p>She lets out a moan and grinds herself against my hand, reaching between us to quickly undo my pants and wrap her hand around my dick that has been hard as a rock soon as I saw her standing in the doorway of the living room.</p><p>Lifting up her hips, I pull my hand out from between her legs as she guides my cock to her entrance and slowly pushes herself down on me until she\u2019s seated fully on me and we both groan.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019ve worn me down and I let you buy her army men,\u201d Gwen mutters as I grab onto her hips and move her up and down my length.</p><p>\u201cDarlin\u2019, my rental house is filled with Barbies and pink shit, I\u2019m pretty sure you\u2019re the one that\u2019s worn me down,\u201d I inform her as I thrust my hips up and pump myself in and out of her at a faster pace.</p><p>Her hands clench tightly into my hair and she whimpers against my mouth as she slams down on top of me until we\u2019re both sweaty and gasping.</p><p>\u201cFuck it, let\u2019s just call it a tie,\u201d she mumbles before letting out a breathy moan as her orgasm quickly rushes through her and I feel her tighten around me.</p><p>I never thought anything would be more exciting than going on missions. As I feel Gwen come apart and listen to her say my name over and over, I realize just how wrong I was. Half of my life is filled with combat, training, gathering intelligence and firing tactical weapons and the other half is filled with love, mind-blowing sex, Disney movies and Barbie Dream Houses.</p><p>Gwen\u2019s right, we can definitely call it a tie.</p><p>\u201cDeal,\u201d I groan as I come inside of her and she swallows my cries of pleasure with her mouth.</p><p>The End </p> </body></html>"]
