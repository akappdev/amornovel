And yet there I was, standing in the bustling kitchen of my busy Chicago restaurant, watching the vegetables on the prep table perform their own vaudeville act.</p> <p>When confronted by the comedic stylings of salad ingredients, most people would have maybe called it a night, taken a sick day. A normal person would have done exactly that. I was willing to admit that now, exiled from my kitchen and the city that I loved to the wilds of western Kentucky.</p><p>My only excuse was sheer exhaustion. The restaurant, Coda, had been overbooked since it opened four years before, far beyond even the wildest expectations of the owners. Six months in, the executive chef quit in a very loud, very public snit over farm-grown oysters, which I still didn\u2019t understand, so I\u2019d been promoted to the head position on the fly. Changes I\u2019d made to the menu caught the attention of some reviewers, which brought even more people through the door. The owners offered me a 5 percent share of the business because I\u2019d been working eighteen-hour days for nearly three years and hadn\u2019t yet called the labor board. Even when I did manage to get a night off, some crisis would call me back into the kitchen, and before I knew it, I\u2019d worked twenty-one days without a break.</p><p>I started making stupid mistakes, confusing sea bass with turbot and mistiming pasta. It was all fixable, but in my head, the mistakes compounded and made me a nervous, double-checking wreck. And yet I still kept up the schedule, only coming home to collapse for a few hours before rising again to scour the supplier markets for ingredients. Chefs who slept in missed the freshest produce and the choicest cuts of meat.</p><p>I ignored the signs that I was overworked every time I looked in the mirror. My hair was dark and thick but hung in a limp cloud around my face. It had no luster, no life. My skin was pale, pasty, and drawn. While I had a passably pert nose, my lips were far too wide and my blue eyes too large for my face, which was emphasized as my cheekbones became more prominent and the dark undereye circles spread.</p><p>I lost weight that I couldn\u2019t really afford to lose. I was short and small-boned but what one briefly employed busboy charmingly referred to as \u201cstacked like hell.\u201d As if I needed another reason for men not to take me seriously in the kitchen, the distraction of an above-average rack meant I had to work that much harder, which led to more hours, which led to my interactions with giggling vegetables.</p> <p>On top of the sleep deprivation, my vacation to London had been canceled because the restaurant\u2019s business manager, Phillip, booked a high-profile vintner\u2019s dinner for that week, deciding that I \u201cwouldn\u2019t mind\u201d putting off my trip for another year. That same manager, who also happened to be my ex-boyfriend, had asked me for \u201cspace\u201d three months earlier and then had gotten engaged to the woman who cleaned his teeth. Who also happened to be his ex-girlfriend, something I didn\u2019t find out until after their engagement. No wonder he spent all that time flossing. And because I worked such insane hours, the chances of meeting a new man I was attracted to and didn\u2019t work with\u2014trust me, I\u2019d learned my lesson there\u2014were practically nil. My rent was going up again, just as I was getting close to saving enough for a down payment on a townhouse. So if I wanted to buy my own home anytime soon, I was going to have to work more hours.</p><p>More. Hours.</p><p>I was contemplating how to bend the space-time continuum to make this possible, when the arugula shouted, \u201cKnock knock!\u201d When I answered, \u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d that seemed to upset my coworkers. Joining the veggies in a full-on George Burns soft-shoe ensured Tess Maitland\u2019s place in the chronicles of \u201cchefs who publicly flipped their shit.\u201d</p><p>The room tilted under my feet like a ship\u2019s deck, leaving me seasick and dizzy. I heard the disembodied voice of my mentor, Chef John Gamling, telling me that my hollandaise was gelatinous swill not fit to dress a McMuffin, which was weird, because I hadn\u2019t made hollandaise sauce that night. I tried to argue that I had people to do that for me, but then I collapsed on the floor in a heap.</p><p>And that\u2019s when the paramedics showed up.</p><p>Phillip, the ex-slash-manager, \u201cstrongly encouraged\u201d me to take some time off. I said, fine, I would take the weekend. And then he made a noise in his throat that made it clear that two days was not what he had in mind. And then he used the word \u201csabbatical,\u201d which was international culinary code for \u201clost her fricking mind.\u201d</p> <p>We cooks liked to pretend that our exiled brethren were touring northern Italy or southern France, collecting recipes and refining pastry techniques. But \u201con sabbatical\u201d usually meant they were drying out in a facility called Promises or Sunrises or some such thing.</p><p>I responded by inviting Phillip to commit indecent acts upon himself with a lemon zester. Phillip suspended me without pay for six weeks, which was, I felt, an overreaction. By the time a dishwasher drove me home, the urge to sing and dance with garnishes had worn off. I sat in my living room, staring at the blank beige walls, and I got pissed.</p><p>\u201cCoda\u201d meant a satisfying conclusion\u2014the slow build of a good meal brought to a delicious climax. Phillip had come up with the name. He could be a pretentious prick, but he knew about branding. Where was my coda? I loved my work. That kitchen was my life. But was I supposed to work myself into delirious zombiehood and then collapse dead on my stove?</p><p>The fact was, I needed a break. I needed to rest, to sleep, to have conversations with people that did not involve butter-fat ratios. I needed to get as far from Coda as possible so I wouldn\u2019t get sucked back into the kitchen and into that compulsive vortex of crazy. I made some arrangements online, packed a few essentials, and drove to Half-Moon Hollow, Kentucky, the only place I thought I\u2019d get a welcome. Also, I may or may not have driven to Phillip\u2019s apartment and thrown a honey ricotta cheesecake at his front door.</p><p>Chef Gamling and his life partner, George, had retired to Kentucky a year before to be near George\u2019s family. Chef, my mentor in culinary school, was the only family I\u2019d had in a long time. Never one to tolerate martyrs or kitchen drama, Chef had assigned himself the task of \u201cwhipping me back into shape.\u201d</p><p>Knowing Chef as I did, it was possible he would use a wire whisk.</p><p>So there I stood, on a dirt driveway in the middle of nowhere, outside the two-bedroom farmhouse I\u2019d rented from late September to late October. It looked as if someone had been building a sturdy little farmhouse and at the last minute decided that Victorian gingerbread and frills were an absolute necessity. The house was halfway to restored, with recently painted lemon yellow siding and bleached white trim. But there were no flowers in the yard, no silly wind chimes laced through the gingerbread eaves, and I found that sort of sad. There were carefully mulched beds surrounding the house, but no one had bothered to plant anything in them. The house seemed ancient but somehow half-finished, a pall of failure hanging over it like real estate B.O.</p><p>I would fit right in.</p> <p>My landlady, Lindy Clemson, had placed the house on a rental site after she and her husband filed for divorce. She\u2019d told me she wanted to get some income out of it before she put it on the market in late October, when the divorce was finalized. Lindy seemed nice enough, if a little tightly wound. It was a real stroke of luck finding a landlord willing to rent for a term as short as one month, particularly in such a small town.</p><p>I heaved a sigh and adjusted the messenger bag on my shoulder, blowing the stick-straight dark brown hair from my face. Resolved, I tugged open the rear door of my SUV and hauled out my suitcases and boxes of kitchen equipment. The thought of using someone else\u2019s pots, pans, and knives was just ridiculous. I\u2019d also packed coolers with the contents of my fridge\u2014organic eggs, cheeses from Meroni\u2019s, asparagus from Sal (my asparagus guy), and enough wine to sink a ship. And of course, my travel-sized spice kit.</p><p>None of the food talked to me during the drive, which I took as a good sign.</p><p>Unpacking didn\u2019t take long. I hadn\u2019t brought many clothes, and I left my pans and knives in their special linen wrappings in the packing boxes. I explored the house, but once you got past living room, kitchen, dining-room-turned-office, two bedrooms, and bath, there wasn\u2019t much to discover. The basement, Lindy had explained, was being used to store her ex\u2019s belongings and wouldn\u2019t be accessible under my rental agreement.</p><p>The rooms were clean but bare. Lindy had left only the most basic of furnishings, the kind of stuff older relatives pawn off on college students and newlyweds: an old brown plaid couch, a sprung pleather Barcalounger, a chipped pressed-wood coffee table. Not to mention the bold brass and black laminate dining-room table that may have belonged to a villain on Miami Vice.</p><p>A few pictures decorated the walls, but squares of unfaded wallpaper revealed where other frames had hung. Other rooms were freshly painted or, like the pretty little kitchen with its cheerful white and blue tile, had recently been refloored. The house smelled pleasantly of linseed oil and sawdust. I explored the rooms, pleased to find the odd window seat or corner bookshelf here and there.</p><p>While I was happy with the house, it didn\u2019t matter much. I could live without cubbies and comforts. I just wanted to do my time \u201con sabbatical\u201d and get back to the city to reclaim my life.</p><p>The main problem was, without the grinding routine of the restaurant, I had no flipping clue what to do with myself. There was TV, but it only had basic cable, and I didn\u2019t feel like sitting down for the farm report. I hadn\u2019t thought to bring any books with me, and the only selections to be found in the house were a bunch of John Jakes paperbacks. I wasn\u2019t even hungry. Ever since \u201cThe Incident,\u201d my stomach fought against anything but chamomile tea and toast. So I did something I hadn\u2019t done in almost ten years: I treated myself to more than four hours of sleep.</p><p>I put fresh sheets on the lumpy little double bed in the master bedroom, pulled the shades tight, and went to bed at 7:30 P.M. I slept deep and dreamless, even with the occasional creak of the house settling against a backdrop of blissful country silence.</p><p>The first order of business the next morning was to drop by my landlady\u2019s office with my deposit and rent for the month, then to visit Chef Gamling. It shocked me to find that Chef Gamling was well and truly retired. Like most of his students, I believed he would die with a spatula in one hand and an unruly saucier\u2019s collar in the other. Now he ambled around his house all day in yoga pants while George taught chemistry at the community college. He was taking up gardening and painting abstract watercolor landscapes that looked like extremely depressing Rorschach blots.</p><p>George, a sweet man with fading cornsilk-colored hair and shoulders as broad as a barn, insisted I was too skinny from the moment I walked through the door of their cute little ranch house. Before ushering me to the back porch, George loaded me down with a bowl of something called monkey bread (a local specialty, I assumed). It was basically blobs of biscuit dough shoved into a Bundt pan and doused in caramel syrup. I don\u2019t believe monkey was an actual ingredient. I didn\u2019t want to ask.</p><p>I think this lump of sucrose-soaked carbs was supposed to serve as a comforting buffer for when Chef lowered the boom on me. It did not work.</p><p>\u201cAny proper student of mine would know better,\u201d Chef growled without preamble, glaring down from his easel, a paintbrush hanging loose in his hand. Chef was a stocky, mustachioed bull of a man with salt-and-pepper hair and deceptively steely gray eyes. And because I knew he loved me and I deserved the ass chewing, I contritely sipped iced tea, trying not to feel like an ill-behaved third-grader called to the principal\u2019s office. The hint of a German accent made the admonishments seem even sterner than he intended.</p><p>\u201cA chef must be sharp, reacting to a multitude of crises with calm and confidence. In order to do that, you need rest and proper meals. Did I not tell all of my students that ignoring your body\u2019s basic needs was a one-way ticket to addiction, exhaustion, and disaster? How are you to maintain quality and prevent mistakes if you can\u2019t remember orders? What good are you to your staff if you have run yourself down like a soggy dishrag? How are staff to respect you if you are singing and dancing like the puppet show\u2014what\u2019s it called, with the chicken and the vampire?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSesame Street?\u201d I suggested.</p><p>\u201cYes, Sesame Street.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think Big Bird is a chicken,\u201d I grumbled petulantly.</p> <p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m so sorry. You clearly have the expertise in performing figments of one\u2019s imagination. And sassy-mouthing your mentor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to make me peel potatoes again, aren\u2019t you?\u201d I groaned.</p><p>Chef Gamling did not, in fact, make me peel potatoes, as he would have when I made a stupid mistake in school. He gave me several Tupperware containers full of his special maultaschen, a German dumpling dish that he only made for me when I was sick in school.</p><p>His eyes softened as I bobbled the containers. \u201cI worry about you, s\u00fc\u00dfe.\u201d My throat caught at his rare use of a German endearment. He pinched my cheek gently, as if gauging how much weight I\u2019d lost over the last year. \u201cI don\u2019t hear from you in months, and you show up at my door looking like this? Pale, skinny, big dark circles under your eyes. You look like you\u2019re going to drop at any moment. And George is no good with first aid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t be performing mouth-to-mouth on me in the \u2018dropping\u2019 scenario?\u201d I asked, squinting up at him.</p> <p>He shook his head and hugged me fiercely. \u201cI have heard the foul words that mouth is capable of producing. Lips that dirty shall never touch mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, you were the one who told the female students that professional chefs \u2018often season the food with salty language,\u2019 so we couldn\u2019t afford to become ladylike and offended.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but I didn\u2019t expect you to embrace the concept so wholeheartedly.\u201d He sighed.</p><p>And so I was instructed to go home, sleep, eat, and then sleep again. If I didn\u2019t finish the maultaschen within three days, he was going to add malted milkshakes to my \u201cregimen.\u201d Also, I was supposed to meet him at the HMH First Baptist Church the next Saturday. The last time I\u2019d seen the inside of a church, a funeral was involved, so this was not a good sign.</p><p>\u2014</p><p>George caught me on my way out of the house and gave me a tire-sized chunk of monkey bread to call my very own. I couldn\u2019t help but accept it, because the gesture was so sweet. So very, very sweet.</p> <p>George was a veritable font of information about local quirks and perks. When he heard where I was staying, he\u2019d clapped his hands together like a little kid and demanded to know all of the details. When I gave him nothing but a confused smile, he told me that \u201cthe Lassiter place\u201d had quite a reputation. \u201cEverybody knew\u201d that the house was rife with ghostly lights and strange noises. Before Lindy\u2019s husband bought the place, teenagers used to sneak out to the property and dare each other to knock on the door and call out for the original owner, John Lassiter.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re saying my house is haunted?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cMore like cursed,\u201d George told me. \u201cEver since poor John Lassiter built it for his wife-to-be in 1900. He was one of those confirmed bachelors who suddenly decide to get married in their fifties. His fianc\u00e9e was young and fickle. Elizabeth Early didn\u2019t really want to marry John, so she kept finding reasons that the house wasn\u2019t ready. She wanted the kitchen to be east-facing, she wanted a water closet, she wanted gingerbread and bits of flotsam all over the eaves. Finally, her father put his foot down and told her to quit stalling and put poor John out of his misery. The morning of their wedding, they woke up to find Elizabeth had run off with a peddler.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTacky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut effective,\u201d George conceded. \u201cJohn never heard from her again. He died a few years later, alone in that little house. He could have sold it. There were plenty of young men who would have given him good money for a pretty house to offer their brides. But he wouldn\u2019t budge. He didn\u2019t want a happy couple living in his house when he was so alone. And ever since he died, any couple who has lived together in that place has either died or had a marriage so miserable they wished they were dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo there\u2019s no such thing as divorce in backwoods ghost stories?\u201d I deadpanned.</p><p>\u201cLaugh all you want, smartass. The only reason you\u2019re renting the house is that Lindy Clemson\u2019s husband died unexpectedly. It\u2019s cursed, I tell you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLindy told me she was getting a divorce.\u201d</p> <p>George blanched, as if he regretted revealing the information. He cleared his throat. \u201cWell, in her case, it\u2019s a little bit of both.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow could it possibly be both?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThings are different here, honey. This is Kentucky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, fine, so my house is cursed.\u201d I sighed. \u201cWhat are the terms?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTerms?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvery curse has terms. You know, sleep a hundred years and kiss a prince, you\u2019re in the clear, that sort of thing. So what did John want from the couples who lived in his house? How can they get back in his good graces?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think he set any terms.\u201d</p><p>I sniffed. \u201cWell, then it\u2019s more of a jinx than a curse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSemantics.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will try not to provoke the spirits of the epically lovelorn while I\u2019m in town,\u201d I promised.</p><p>\u201cSee that you don\u2019t, sweetie.\u201d</p><p>The Travel Wok\u2014When Pepper Spray Just Won\u2019t Do</p><p>2</p><p>There it was again!</p><p>The soft thump down the hall had me sitting up in bed, blinking into the black quiet of my room. My sleep-blurred brain tumbled to George, his stories about poor, lovelorn Mr. Lassiter, and the possibility that said deceased bachelor could be wandering around my house in spectral form.</p><p>This was what I got for going to bed so early. My internal clock was all wonky. Thoroughly chastised and toting Tupperware and a bowling-ball-sized chunk of monkey bread, I\u2019d found myself back in my house with nothing to do. No dishes to prep. Nothing to chop or saut\u00e9. No pans to wash. No knives to sharpen. The highlight of the evening was tripping and falling flat on my face as soon as I walked into the living room. The coffee table seemed... off. I remembered it being a little farther away from the couch. Then again, I was still adjusting to, well, everything, so who was I to think I\u2019d already mentally mapped the living room?</p><p>I settled for more sleep. It seemed the more I slept, the more I needed to sleep. My body had been running on fumes for so long it was as if it was soaking up all the rest it could because I couldn\u2019t be trusted to sleep decently again when I went back to my life. The house was so quiet, a far cry from the traffic noises and sirens that bounced around my city apartment. I didn\u2019t need a white-noise machine here. The silence of the house seemed to wrap around me like a sweet cocoon, helping me ignore my ailing stomach and table bruises.</p><p>The only hitch in my \u201csleep the month away\u201d plan was that the extreme quiet made every creak, every groan, of every board echo like a gunshot. I didn\u2019t know much about old houses, but it seemed this one spent a lot of time settling. At times, it almost sounded like footsteps falling softly against the hardwood floors\u2014ridiculous, as I\u2019d triple-checked the locks myself, a habit I\u2019d carried with me from Chicago.</p><p>The Clemsons\u2019 debris was strewn across the house like broken toys. Lindy left a bunch of men\u2019s plaid flannels and Clemson Construction T-shirts in the closet. A manly bar of plain yellow Dial still occupied the little soap dish in the master bath. When I opened the coat closet, I had to dive out of the way to avoid the avalanche of blueprints and graph paper that came tumbling from the top shelf.</p><p>And now, on top of these depressing relics, I had to deal with things that went bump in the night? I tilted my head, like a dog listening for its master, and it happened again. The weird noise echoed down the hall. It didn\u2019t sound like the house creaking. This time, it really did sound like footsteps, distinct movements on the floor. As if someone was walking around in the kitchen.</p><p>Slowly, my hand slid down the side of the mattress, reaching for the Louisville Slugger I kept under the bed in my apartment. But of course, it wasn\u2019t there. Why would I bring a weapon to a nice, safe country cottage?</p><p>Something in the other room hit the floor with a muted thud, sending a cold, watery flash through my belly. I\u2019d seen Straw Dogs. I knew this scenario wouldn\u2019t end well for the out-of-towner.</p><p>I jumped out of bed, carefully moving to close the door with a soft click. I leaned against it, both palms pressed to the wood, as if my scrawny self could be any kind of barricade. Forcing myself to take slow, deep breaths, I stepped into my sneakers and a hoodie.</p><p>Options! I barked at my brain. Give me options. You can panic later.</p><p>I needed to call 911. But Lindy had taken all of the landline phones with her when she\u2019d moved out. My cell phone? In my bag, on the TV table next to the front door. The front door, which was right by the kitchen. That was very poor planning on my part.</p><p>I would kick myself later, I promised. OK, I couldn\u2019t call for help. I couldn\u2019t get to my car keys. Could I run? My nearest neighbors were three miles away, but if I cut across the cow pasture that bordered the property, I could make that distance pretty easily. I could run in my pajama pants. It would mean leaving my purse behind, but at this point, I was willing to live without my cell phone and the fourteen Chap-Sticks rattling around in my shoulder bag.</p><p>I crept over to the window and tried to shove the sash up. Nothing. It didn\u2019t budge a millimeter. Planting my feet, I tried again, shoving with all my might. Nothing. Being low to the ground gave me proper leverage, but I was also skinny, malnourished, with no weight-lifting regimen.</p><p>I leaned closer to the sill. \u201cWhat the hell?\u201d I hissed. The windows had been nailed shut from the outside. \u201cWho does that?\u201d</p><p>Were all of the windows nailed shut? Why would Lindy do that? I considered throwing my nightstand through the single-pane window and making a break for it, but having no idea who was in the house or why, I preferred to get away without calling attention to myself.</p><p>I need more options, Brain!</p><p>But Brain was ignoring me in favor of regurgitating random soup recipes. Because knowing the exact amount of mushrooms in the porcini bisque special from the previous week was super-useful at the moment. Stupid Brain.</p><p>OK, the back door was near the kitchen, which was clearly not a viable route. If I was very quiet, I might be able to sneak past the kitchen, grab my purse, and get out through the front door, calling the cops while I ran for the neighbors\u2019. It was better than cowering in my room, waiting for some unknown intruder to decide whether he wanted to add murder to his criminal r\u00e9sum\u00e9.</p><p>I listened at the door, unable to hear anything on the other side. I touched the knob with shaking fingers, forcing myself to grasp it and turn. I could do this, I told myself. I was a city girl. And I would not let some hillbilly housebreaker intimidate me. I eased the door open. This was my house, damn it, however temporary. I didn\u2019t let people intimidate me in my kitchen, much less my house. Giving up the relative safety of my room, I took a few resolute steps out into the hall.</p><p>I was Tess Maitland, terror of junior line cooks everywhere. I wasn\u2019t afraid of anything.</p><p>Except for heights. And sharks. And backwoods burglars.</p><p>My bravado deflated to nil as I neared the kitchen. If I could just sneak past unnoticed and slip out the front door... If I could grab my keys and make it to my car, all the better.</p><p>My favorite wok\u2014fourteen inches in diameter and carbon steel, nice and heavy\u2014sat on top of a box full of kitchen supplies I\u2019d left in the hallway. I slipped my fingers through the smooth wood handle. Now if he got in the way, the home intruder was going to get a nice, solid whack.</p><p>From the kitchen, I could now hear the low hum of the microwave. My arms fell to my sides, wok bumping against my leg.</p><p>Who the hell breaks into someone\u2019s house to use their microwave?</p><p>Believe it or not, this actually made me feel better. For one thing, someone who was warming up ramen in a stranger\u2019s house probably wasn\u2019t planning the dismemberment of said stranger. And the microwave had probably covered the sound of my approach. As long as I didn\u2019t\u2014 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I moved my left foot, wincing as the board beneath it squeaked.</p><p>Damn it.</p><p>The microwave stopped, and swift footsteps moved toward the kitchen door.

I brought the steel pan crashing down on his head.</p><p>\u201cOw,\u201d the shape growled, although he did not drop to his knees.</p><p>I shrieked and whacked him again, a nice uppercut swing that landed across his face. Enough moonlight spilled from the window that I could just make out the slim build, long limbs, dark hair, and darker eyes.</p> <p>\u201cStop that!\u201d he spat, sounding rather annoyed now. And I found the tone of his voice really pissed me off. He was in my house. He was skulking around in my kitchen, cooking what I assumed was my food, and he was annoyed with me for interrupting him? He grunted when I swung the pan down on the crown of his head, but he still didn\u2019t drop.</p><p>\u201cScrew this, I\u2019m going to get my knives,\u201d I hissed, stomping toward the kitchen.</p><p>This was stupid for two reasons. One, I could have just walked out of the house unscathed. Also, I\u2019d just broadcast my plans to my opponent. The moment I moved past him, his arm shot out and caught me by the hand, squeezing with enough force that I cried out. Twirling the wok with my free hand, I smacked his arm away with the edge of the pan.</p><p>\u201cStop hittin\u2019 me with Asian cookware!\u201d he shouted, shoving me away, sending me skidding into the fridge.</p><p>\u201cGet the hell out of my house!\u201d I shouted back.</p><p>He backed toward the doorway. \u201cLook, I\u2019m going to turn on the lights. And when I do, please don\u2019t swing any other kitchen stuff at my head.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDid you miss the part where I said \u2018Get the hell out of my house\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s the thing. It\u2019s not your house, it\u2019s mine.\u201d</p><p>I squinted as he flicked on the lights.</p><p>Holy hell.</p><p>My deluded burglar was sex in a pair of Levi\u2019s. He was tall and lean, with the exception of a well-developed chest and arms under a worn True Value Hardware T-shirt. His eyes were a warm teak color with dark chocolate centers around the pupils, which complemented the mussed dark hair nicely. He had high cheekbones, marked with a little triangle of freckles at the corner of his left eye, which shouldn\u2019t have been adorable on a burglar, but it was.</p><p>The most unusual thing about him was his skin, which was paper-pale. No one I\u2019d so far seen in this town was pale, particularly the young men. People here spent so much time outdoors, doing farm work or yard work or hunting or fishing\u2014everyone I\u2019d seen had a healthy windburned glow. But this guy\u2019s skin was like polished marble, smooth and white, with a faintly iridescent shine. He flashed me his best winning smile, a blinding white with prominent canines. I stepped back instinctively.</p><p>\u201cOh, come on! You\u2019re a vampire?\u201d</p><p>He grinned nastily, dropping his fangs.</p> <p>\u201cDamn it.\u201d</p><p>Contrary to popular legend, vampires didn\u2019t have to wait to be invited into your house. They could walk through any human\u2019s door any time they wanted. They just chose not to out of politeness. This was one of the many, many misconceptions that had been blown out of the water when vampires came out of the coffin in 1999.</p><p>Believe it or not, even living in a big city, I hadn\u2019t come into contact with vampires often. Unable to digest human food, they didn\u2019t exactly flood my restaurant with business. We had a vampire dishwasher for a while. The hours suited him perfectly, but being around that much silver, to which vampires were severely allergic, had him on edge for his entire shift, and he quit after three weeks. We tried to point out that our silverware was actually stainless steel, but Bruno couldn\u2019t be persuaded. It was a shame. He was the one guy we could count on to show up on time.</p><p>I\u2019d always figured that vampires had centuries under the radar to sink their teeth into anyone they wanted before the Coming Out, so why would they pick off random bystanders now that they were under media scrutiny? At least, that\u2019s what I thought before one of them slunk into my kitchen and used my microwave without permission.</p><p>What the hell did a vampire heat up in a microwave, anyway?</p><p>\u201cWhatsa matter?\u201d he asked, the faint bluegrass twang rising and falling like ripples in bourbon. \u201cCat got your tongue?\u201d</p><p>Despite the panty-dropping lilt of his voice, he touched the nerve that hadn\u2019t sparked since Phillip had uttered the word \u201csabbatical.\u201d I grabbed for the canvas carrying case that protected my ungodly expensive ceramic knives.</p><p>\u201cOh, put the knives down,\u201d he said, moving around me at lightning speed and pushing the case out of my reach. \u201cGosh darn hysterical female.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, pulse or no pulse, you are breaking and entering. You need to get out, right now, or I\u2019ll call the Council hotline.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall V-one-one,\u201d he said, referring to the nickname for the World Council for the Equal Treatment of the Undead\u2019s national hotline for humans with vampire problems. \u201cI have every right to be here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a rental agreement in my bag that says otherwise,\u201d I shot back.</p><p>\u201cMy name is Sam Clemson. I\u2019ve lived here for the last five years. My wife and I are in the middle of a divorce. Until it\u2019s final on October 28, I have the legal right to be here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTess Maitland. Wait\u2014\u201d I clapped my hand over my face. \u201cLindy\u2019s husband? George said her husband died!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, to be fair, he wasn\u2019t wrong,\u201d he admitted. \u201cI was turned about two years ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShow me some ID,\u201d I said, holding out my hand imperiously. I would think about exactly how stupid it was to order vampires around at a later date.</p><p>The corners of his lips quirked. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do I know you\u2019re not just some crazy who wandered into the house? All vampires are required by Council to register after they\u2019re turned and file for their vampire identification card.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCongratulations, you\u2019ve read USA Today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShow me the card, Mr. Clemson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSam, please. Mr. Clemson was my father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure about that?\u201d I retorted.</p><p>\u201cHaha, I\u2019m a bastard, clever.\u201d He grumbled as he pulled his wallet out of his back pocket and handed me the little green card. He was indeed Sam Clemson, and this was his address. And contrary to all laws of DMV logic, Sam took a damn fine ID picture.</p><p>\u201cSo, you\u2019ve been here this whole time? How? Where have you been sleeping\u2014\u201d I gasped. \u201cIs that why I can\u2019t get into the basement? You\u2019re locked in there during the day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I should tell you where I sleep during the day,\u201d he said, lifting an eyebrow.</p><p>My lips wanted to twitch into a smile, but I clamped them tightly together. I supposed I couldn\u2019t blame him for being cautious. Some paranoid humans spent the first year \u201cpostvampire\u201d finding any reason possible to drag vampires out into the daylight or push them onto handy pointy wooden objects. The Council formed to \u201cformally interact with human governments and facilitate open, cordial communication.\u201d In other words, they busted their way into the homes of presidents, prime ministers, and dictators around the world and told them, \u201cQuit killing us off for your twisted amusement, or we will FedEx you pieces of your beloved Robert Pattinson.\u201d</p><p>And then a thought occurred to me.</p><p>\u201cWait, did Lindy know you were still staying here?\u201d I demanded. He nodded, stepping away from me and my kitchen implements. \u201cShe rented this house to me knowing there was a vampire sleeping in the basement? That bitch!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he objected. \u201cThat\u2019s my\u2014well, my ex-wife you\u2019re talkin\u2019 about. Do you always cuss so much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you the least bit upset about this?\u201d I yelled.</p><p>\u201cOf course I\u2019m upset about it,\u201d he shouted back. \u201cDo you think I\u2019m happy that my wi\u2014Lindy thought it was OK to open our home up to some stranger, without tellin\u2019 me? I didn\u2019t even realize you were here until yesterday, when I tripped over your stupid box of kitchen stuff. How early have you been goin\u2019 to sleep, woman?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeside the point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was still tryin\u2019 to figure out how to get you out of the house without talking to you, when you came in here swingin\u2019 that wok. Who travels with a wok?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou, don\u2019t talk anymore,\u201d I snapped at him. I snatched up my purse from the hallway and grabbed my phone. I didn\u2019t feel bad about calling, despite the fact that it was after 11:00 P.M. Even if Lindy was in bed, I thought she owed me an explanation. She didn\u2019t pick up, and the call went to voice mail. I hissed out very specific instructions to call me as soon as she got my message, no matter what the time.</p><p>I slammed my phone onto the counter and let out a vicious stream of anatomically detailed curses.</p><p>He pulled those full, pale lips into a sneer. \u201cYou are just a big ol\u2019 ball of sunshine, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe better to melt your face with, my dear,\u201d I snapped. I took a deep breath and tried to remember that even if this guy was being a bit of a dick, it wasn\u2019t his fault that his ex-wife had taken the last of my cash reserves under false pretenses. I was ashamed that I\u2019d been conned by that little bumpkin bimbo. Clearly, a perky blond ponytail and a great big Jesus fish on one\u2019s car didn\u2019t make a person trustworthy.</p><p>I sighed. \u201cOK, calling the cops is out, because you apparently live here. And I really need to take full advantage of my lease. I\u2019m only here for a month.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will not leave my house for some random stranger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, I guess we\u2019re at an impasse,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cYeah, if \u2018impasse\u2019 means \u2018the foul-mouthed human moves out as soon as possible.\u2019\u201d</p><p>I crossed my arms under my chest... and realized that sort of pushed my boobs up into this weird cleavage popover. I dropped my arms. \u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, you don\u2019t have to leave,\u201d he said silkily as moved toward me. His body language suddenly shifted into a predatory lean, his tall frame looming over me, trapping me against the counter. \u201cBy all means, please stay. It gets so lonely out here when I\u2019m on my own. I could use some... companionship.\u201d He dropped his fangs and bared them dramatically.</p><p>And because the bad-decision-making lobes of my brain were in charge, I giggled instead of cowering against the counter. I stepped forward, into the cage of his arms.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. Are you trying to intimidate me?\u201d I scoffed. \u201cYou\u2019re about as threatening as the cornfield chorus on Hee Haw. Do you have any idea what it takes for a woman to work her way up to head chef at a fine-dining restaurant in a major city? Or what kind of bullshit I\u2019ve had to put up with over the years from chauvinist pigs who didn\u2019t think I should be able to tell them what to do because I lacked the requisite testicles? I\u2019m going to tell you the same thing I told them. I own thirty different types of extremely expensive knives. And I know how to put each of them to creative use. Try to intimidate me again, and you will wake up next to a beautifully plated medley of freshly saut\u00e9ed vampire bits.\u201d</p><p>Slightly boggled, Sam stared down at me, horrified, and backed away. \u201cYou\u2019re crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll find that all chefs are a little unstable.\u201d I offered him my scariest smile, the kind that made waiters cringe away like frightened deer. \u201cNormal people don\u2019t like to play with fire and raw meat all day.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He grabbed his mug of what I assumed was blood and stalked toward the basement door, glaring over his shoulder.</p><p>I grinned to myself. \u201cI think I won that one.\u201d</p><p>\u2014</p> <p>With the (disturbingly attractive) interloper holed up in his basement, I made a huge pot of coffee and retreated to my room. I threw my blinds up so the minute the sun rose, my room would be bathed in light, and crouched on my bed.</p><p>I had a vampire roommate. This was just the cherry on the crap sundae of my life.</p><p>Was this even legal? Could Lindy rent the house to me when it was already occupied? Vampire property rights were still a little vague. After the Great Coming Out, the Council wrangled with the human governments over financial issues. Vampires became the answer to a dwindling economy, an untapped taxable workforce capable of launching untold cottage industries\u2014blood banks, all-night shopping centers, fang-friendly dental clinics.</p><p>But there were problems. Recently turned vampires weren\u2019t eager to take back the credit-card balances they\u2019d left behind when they\u2019d \u201cdied.\u201d Other vampires hadn\u2019t paid taxes in centuries and deeply resented the idea that they\u2019d have to file 1040s. This reluctance led to some resentment from the humans, which led to some \u201cless than friendly\u201d policies toward the undead when it came to mortgages, leases, and probate laws. After all, vampires weren\u2019t technically alive, so how could they have property rights?</p><p>Even after the Undead Civil Rights Act, there were still loopholes of which humans took full advantage. Landlords suddenly aware of why some tenants only came out at night kicked vampires out of their apartments over the slightest infractions. Home loans to vampires came with outrageous interest rates. And when they divorced, they were lucky to get away with the clothes on their backs. I couldn\u2019t imagine a judge in semirural Kentucky giving Sam a fair shake against sweet little Lindy.</p> <p>Was this rental scheme some sort of revenge against Sam? They\u2019d been married for three years before Sam had been turned. Clearly, Lindy had skinned him in the divorce. She\u2019d taken all of the good furniture, whatever had been hanging on the walls. There wasn\u2019t anything in the kitchen cupboards but lint and the groceries I\u2019d brought. I was surprised she let Sam stay in the house.</p><p>I didn\u2019t have the luxury of sympathizing with Sam. Maybe it was selfish, but I wasn\u2019t in a very stable position myself. I\u2019d cleared out my checking account to put down the rent on this place. I had a healthy savings account, but it was earmarked for my new apartment. And I didn\u2019t know whether I had a job to return to after my \u201csabbatical.\u201d My contract with Coda was performance-based. I got a share in the business, but the owners didn\u2019t have to keep using me in the kitchen if I was unable to fulfill their expectations. If I didn\u2019t have a regular paycheck, I would need every penny when I got back to the city.</p><p>I didn\u2019t have the available cash to travel somewhere else. I couldn\u2019t go home. I lived right around the corner from Coda. The temptation to go back to check on my kitchen would be too great. I could stay with Chef Gamling and George, I supposed. But it would prick my pride. It was bad enough that Chef felt he had to nurse me back to health like some emotionally stunted kitten. Plus, Chef\u2019s house didn\u2019t even have a guest room. The second bedroom had been converted into Chef\u2019s painting studio. I would be reduced to a couch surfer. A big pathetic couch-surfing loser who talked to vegetables.</p><p>Still, I wouldn\u2019t stay in a house with a strange man, much less a man who saw me as his favorite food group.</p><p>I didn\u2019t want to leave the house. Hell, if I had the money for a vacation home in the sticks, I would buy the place. I liked the weird nooks and crannies in the design. I liked the quiet and the way the light came through the kitchen windows in the morning. I could sleep there, and I couldn\u2019t seem to sleep anywhere. I wasn\u2019t going to give that up. I needed the Lassiter place to get better. If Sam was going to get in the way of that, he would have to go.</p><p>Blinded by the Brine</p> <p>3</p><p>My new landlord did not appreciate my predawn call.</p><p>\u201cIs there a problem with the house?\u201d Lindy asked, all guilelessness and concern.</p><p>I huffed out an irritated sigh. She was honestly going to make me say it. She was going to plead ignorance, just in case I was calling about a leak in the roof or a plumbing problem.</p><p>\u201cYes, you didn\u2019t make it clear in the rental ad that the house came with a fully furnished vampire lair in the basement,\u201d I snapped.</p><p>\u201cOh, that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, that. Your vampire ex-husband is sleeping in the basement. That would be pertinent information to give a prospective tenant, I think, before renting out the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, this really isn\u2019t my problem, Tess.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou rented me a house that someone was already living in!\u201d</p><p>She yawned. \u201cTechnically, no one is living there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you argue semantics with me. You either get your vampire ex out of here, or you refund my money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll find I don\u2019t have to do either. You signed the paperwork. The house is livable. Besides, I don\u2019t have your money anymore.\u201d</p><p>It was all downhill from there. Lindy said the house was my problem now and told me I had to deal with it. I told her to do a lot of things, most of which were not anatomically possible. She called the cops and reported me for harassment.</p><p>It turned out that there was very little that local law enforcement could do to help me resolve my dispute with Lindy. Until the divorce was final, Lindy was technically entitled to rent out the space as she chose, according to Half-Moon Hollow Police Sergeant Russell Lane, although he said it in a tone that gave me the distinct impression that he was guessing. The good news was that as far as the police were concerned, I hadn\u2019t violated my rental agreement. I hadn\u2019t actually threatened Lindy, just annoyed her. So she couldn\u2019t force me to leave just because she was upset with me.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t I have the right to a house without undead occupants?\u201d I\u2019d asked Sergeant Lane.</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cYou are free to take her to small-claims court.\u201d</p><p>Considering that the case would likely be called months after I returned to Chicago, I decided against that. I also passed on Lane\u2019s suggestion that I could move into a motel in town if I was so uncomfortable with Sam\u2019s presence in the house. I saw a few of those establishments on my first drive through town. Unless I was an out-of-state fisherman or an adulterer, I didn\u2019t think I would be comfortable at the Lucky Clover Motel.</p><p>Given the choice between sticky sheets and bedbugs versus a vampire, I would take my chances with the vampire.</p><p>My day did not get better. Despite my extreme fatigue, I couldn\u2019t get any rest. I tossed and turned, but I was too keyed up from my visit from the fuzz. There was this weird gnawing sensation under my breastbone that kept me from relaxing.</p><p>How had I become so uncomfortable in my own skin? I used to be such a physical person. When I was in school, everything seemed easy. When I was hungry, I ate. If my body felt too soft, I exercised. And the sex. Everything you\u2019ve heard about the stove being a hotbed for sexual tension is completely true.</p><p>But when you reach a certain level of success in the kitchen, everything becomes so competitive\u2014who gets the best reviews, who gets their photos taken with celebrity diners, who gets guest spots on the Food Network. Because of my schedule, I rarely spent time with nonculinary \u201ccivilians.\u201d I couldn\u2019t date other chefs, because they became insecure if they felt they were the \u201cbeta\u201d in the relationship. Even Phillip, whose image and income depended on my success, seemed uncomfortable with the idea of a girlfriend who was \u201chigh-profile.\u201d He wanted to conduct the front of house like a maestro with his orchestra, not answer diners\u2019 questions about his girlfriend. No wonder he\u2019d gone back to the dental hygienist. No one wanted to discuss flossing in detail.</p><p>So for months, there had been no sleep and no sex. Clearly, I was lucky I hadn\u2019t taken out bystanders in my vegetable-based breakdown.</p><p>I stretched. I popped a few antacids. I opened my laptop, checked my e-mail, and was shocked to find a dozen or so messages from restaurant owners around Chicago. Most of them were the standard \u201cget well soon\u201d messages one would expect from a colleague, even a competitor. But others seemed to be fishing for information. Was I leaving Coda? Was I really having health problems, or had the gossip mill blown that out of proportion? What were my immediate plans when I got back into town? There were a few subtle hints\u2014that if my sudden decline was simply an excuse to get away from newly engaged Phillip, that several establishments would be more than willing to hire me.</p><p>The fact that I didn\u2019t immediately delete the e-mail was a bit shocking. For years, I\u2019d devoted every waking hour to Coda. Could I really leave the restaurant? I would have to move. It would be too awkward, living so close to the restaurant. If I was going to do this, I wanted a fresh start. I would need a new apartment\u2014maybe I\u2019d even indulge in something with a view of the Chicago skyline that didn\u2019t involve the guy across the street practicing nude yoga in front of an open window.</p><p>Before I\u2019d left, the owners at Coda had made it clear that if I wanted to sell out, they would be happy to reclaim stakes in their business from a potentially crazy woman. They\u2019d only offered the small share I held to appease me. If I sold out, I might have enough to put the down payment on a modest townhouse in a semisafe neighborhood.</p><p>I would check the apartments across the street for nude yoga enthusiasts before I moved in.</p><p>\u2014</p><p>That night, I sat at the kitchen counter with some jasmine tea and waited, feeling like a teenager on her first job interview.</p><p>I tried to focus on the positive steps I\u2019d taken that day\u2014unpacking, finding a store that sold Amish breads and sweets, buying a very large lock for my bedroom door at the hardware store. Lindy would just have to deal with the fact that her master bedroom now had a brand-new mental-hospital-quality deadbolt.</p><p>But I was about to have a potentially unpleasant conversation with my new vampire roommate, and I just couldn\u2019t seem to shake the feeling that it was going to end badly\u2014or bloodily\u2014for me.</p><p>The sun dropped behind the horizon, leaving the kitchen purpled and shadowed. Just as I flipped the light switch, I could hear footsteps lumbering up the basement stairs. I took a deep breath, willing myself to be calm, cool, civil.</p><p>At the very least, I would not threaten him with Asian cookware.</p><p>Sam stepped through the basement door, just as tall and broody as I remembered. Pulling a faded blue T-shirt over some pale but nicely defined abs, he started at the sight of a human sitting at his counter. He frowned, shifting the donor bag of blood between his hands. \u201cOh, you\u2019re still here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll of the awkwardness of a one-night stand without any of the fun,\u201d I said, trying desperately to look anywhere but at the half-buttoned jeans. It didn\u2019t work. It was as if there were some sort of vision magnet embedded in the little metal rivets. Don\u2019t look, Tess. Don\u2019t loo\u2014</p><p>Damn it. I looked. And he caught me.</p><p>Sam smirked, a devilish little dimple winking out at me as he crossed to the microwave and heated a mugful of synthetic blood. With his jeans still undone. At this point, I was pretty sure he was refusing to button them, just to mess with me. So I stared at the wall and forged ahead.</p><p>\u201cRemember that impasse we discussed? Well, I had a conversation with your ex this morning... and the police. And it would appear that Lindy doesn\u2019t have to repay my money, but she can\u2019t force me out, either. So I\u2019m here to stay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you just go back home? There\u2019s nothing for you here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m supposed to be \u2018recuperating.\u2019 If I go back to Chicago, I will end up somewhere I don\u2019t need to be.\u201d</p><p>He turned his head sharply, glaring at me. \u201cHold on, are you a drug addict?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The flinty tone of Sam\u2019s voice, the command, set my nerves on edge.

I took a deep breath, forcing myself to exhale slowly.</p><p>\u201cI am not a drug addict,\u201d I said through clenched teeth. \u201cI\u2019m a workaholic. You probably figured out from all of the kitchen equipment that I\u2019m a chef. I had a bit of a setback at my restaurant, and my boss put me on leave. If I go back before I\u2019m supposed to, my manager-slash-ex will probably fire me. I\u2019ll be humiliated, again, and probably won\u2019t be able to find work. My point is, I\u2019m not leaving. Can\u2019t you just go stay with one of your vampire friends for a while?\u201d</p><p>Sam scowled. \u201cI haven\u2019t been a vampire long enough to have a \u2018crash pad\u2019 in the undead community. And my wife got all my living friends in the divorce.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m sorry that your being antisocial has worked against you. But I am not going to share a house with you. And that\u2019s not because you\u2019re a vampire. It\u2019s because you\u2019re a strange male vampire, who could be a tutu-wearing serial killer for all I know.\u201d</p><p>His dark brows drew together as he shook off that visual. \u201cI guess one of us is just going to have to leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I guess one of us is,\u201d I shot back. \u201cIn case you missed it, \u2018one of us\u2019 translates to the one not freeloading.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cFreeloading?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m paying my way here. You have no job that I\u2019m aware of. You have no decent aboveground furniture. You\u2019re riding out the time left on a divorce settlement before Lindy puts this place on the market.\u201d</p> <p>I should not have said that. Even before the words came out of my mouth, I knew I shouldn\u2019t have called him out on his broken marriage. Why didn\u2019t I just go drop-kick a baby polar bear and then poke its mama with a stick?</p><p>He muttered something along the lines of \u201cShe\u2019s that sure I won\u2019t get the money, is she?\u201d</p><p>Given the sharp expression in Sam\u2019s dark eyes, I had no choice but to backtrack. \u201cLook, I\u2019m really sorry about your marital issues, but it doesn\u2019t change the fact that I\u2019m staying. I\u2019ve paid to stay the month, so I\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou may be paying your way, but that doesn\u2019t make this your home,\u201d he hissed, gripping the counter with those strong white hands. \u201cYou can pack up and leave anytime. And trust me, I\u2019m going to do everything I can to try to make that time come sooner than you expect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you threatening me?\u201d I asked, a sly grin spreading across my face as I looked up at him. I couldn\u2019t help it. I couldn\u2019t think of the last time a man challenged me like this. For the first time in a long time, I felt a frisson of... something there were no clean words for. \u201cI bet you I can make you run screaming from this house like something out of The Amityville Horror.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sound awfully confident for a mortal without superpowers.\u201d He growled, leaning ever so slightly closer. His nostrils flared as if he was taking in my scent. \u201cYou won\u2019t make me move an inch.\u201d</p> <p>I showed off my own teeth in a sharp, wicked smile. \u201cYou will run screaming into broad daylight like a little, tiny girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst one to fold leaves for good?\u201d he asked, licking his lips.</p><p>\u201cAgreed.\u201d</p><p>Sam offered his hand to shake on the deal. \u201cBring it on, cupcake.\u201d</p><p>I smirked, grasping his cool hand tightly. The slight wince he gave showed he didn\u2019t expect me to have much of a grip. \u201cSweetie, you\u2019re already standing in the middle of it, and you\u2019re too dumb to see it.\u201d</p><p>One Epiphany, Hold the Pimento Cheese</p><p>4</p><p>The next twenty-four hours were tense, the long, silent wait for the first shot in a battle.</p> <p>Sam\u2019s first efforts at \u201cpranking\u201d me were the stuff of summer camps and middle school sleepovers. While I was asleep, he sneaked into the bathroom and Saran Wrapped the toilet. He also switched all of the staples in the kitchen. There was salt in the sugar canister, baking soda in the can of baking powder, that sort of thing. It might have confused someone who hadn\u2019t taken professional baking courses.</p><p>After visiting an establishment called Bubba\u2019s Beer and Bait, I responded by drilling a little hole in the basement door and gently coaxing two containers of live crickets through a funnel and onto the basement steps. I corked the hole and wedged a towel into the crack under the door so they couldn\u2019t escape. The best part was that Sam would never find all of them. They would crawl under his bed and into corners, and he would drive himself nuts trying to find the source of their annoying little cheeps.</p><p>I was careful to lock myself in my room by sundown that night, just so I could listen to his irritated yelps as he woke up to hundreds of chirping bunkmates. The combination was downright musical.</p><p>I was having fun. For the first time in a long time, I felt challenged by a man, and not just in a \u201cYou can\u2019t tell me what to do!\u201d rebelling-against-Daddy sort of way. Sam was playing with me, sometimes in a mean-spirited, irritating fashion, but he was devoting a lot of time and effort to keeping me entertained. And that made me like him just the tiniest bit.</p><p>But then the sawing started. Nights at the house went from blissfully quiet to my own personal construction zone. Sawing, hammering, drilling, and some sound I could only identify as a cat getting stuck in a dishwasher. I never knew when it was going to start. And some nights, I would sit up until the wee hours of the morning, waiting for it, only to be treated to a quick fifteen minutes of audio torture before dawn.</p><p>I would wake up every morning, unlock my bedroom, and find some project half-completed that made my life more difficult. The tub was left stripped and half-caulked, meaning that I couldn\u2019t bathe without doing permanent damage to the surrounding drywall. The hardwood floors in the hallway were refinished, meaning that if I wanted to leave my room, I had to choose between climbing out the windows or walking across the fresh sealant and ruining his work. He knew I liked the house too much to want to hurt it. Damn him.</p><p>One morning, I found that he\u2019d removed all of the knobs from the house. All of the knobs. The faucets, the doorknobs, the drawer pulls for the bathroom vanity, the stove and oven knobs, and the volume knob for the TV. Yes, I was shocked that Sam\u2019s TV had a volume knob. Let\u2019s just say that Lindy didn\u2019t leave him HDTV-ready.</p><p>I launched a reciprocal offensive. I roasted a turkey and placed an oscillating fan so that it blew the delicious Thanksgiving fragrance toward the basement door. I baked fragrant cinnamon rolls and lasagnas redolent with garlic and herbs. This gastronomical warfare worked on two fronts, physical and emotional. One, human food smelled spoiled and rancid to vampires. They lacked the enzymes to process solids, so exposure to most \u201cregular\u201d food resulted in projectile vomiting. And two, Sam would be reminded of all of the things he missed about eating as a human and\u2014in my mind\u2014would wind up weeping in a little pile of soggy vampire on the kitchen floor.</p><p>It seemed to be having some effect on him. Every few days, I would find a cheap discount-store saucepan in the kitchen sink, burned black and coated with some unidentifiable oily substance. Was he trying to retaliate?</p><p>I supposed I went too far when I made my special peanut-butter-cup brownies and left them under a glass dome on the counter. I even left a little card next to the display that read, \u201cEnjoy!\u201d The next day, I woke up to find that he\u2019d shut off the gas connection to the stove, rendering it unusable. Clearly, he didn\u2019t expect me to know how to fix that.</p><p>Amateur.</p><p>While the pranks kept my mind active and distracted from the potential disasters looming when I returned to Chicago, the sleep deprivation from the constant power-tooling was taking a physical toll. I was getting even less rest than when I was living at home. I took naps in the afternoons, just to keep alert during Sam\u2019s active hours.</p><p>My routine was changing\u2014again\u2014and I was feeling it. What little progress I\u2019d made health-wise took a distinct slide in the opposite direction. Chef was pleased to see that I was keeping the weight I\u2019d gained from forced helpings of dumplings and milkshakes, but he tsked over the reemergence of dark circles under my eyes. I\u2019d looked forward to jogging on some of the green-canopied country roads that surrounded the house, but I didn\u2019t have the energy. I became snappish and grumpy, even with Chef, earning me a ten-pound bag of potatoes to peel.</p><p>After I\u2019d reconnected the stove\u2019s innards, I went back to bed and tried to think calm, happy thoughts. I needed to sleep if I was going to come up with an appropriate and painful rebuttal to this abuse of my domain. Striking at my stove was a new low for Sam. How would he like it if I went into his basement and melted down all of his precious tools?</p><p>Hmmmm.</p><p>\u201cOh, come on, Tess, where are you going to get a smelter?\u201d I said to myself, sighing and rubbing at the persistent ache in my middle. Perplexed, I sat up in my sad, lumpy bed and realized I was hungry. Not just a little peckish. I was seriously, feeling-my-belly-button-rub-against-my-spine starving. I hadn\u2019t been this hungry in years, certainly not this early in the morning. I was usually just hungry enough to need a snack by the end of a dinner shift, meaning a lot of midnight carbs. I usually skipped breakfast in favor of running five miles to make up for the late-night eating.</p><p>I thought back to the last time I\u2019d actually made breakfast for myself and couldn\u2019t remember what I\u2019d eaten. And now that I was hungry, what did I want? Waffles? Frittata? Crepes?</p><p>Those things were all well and good, but what I really wanted was Lucky Charms. I hadn\u2019t had sugary cereals since culinary school, when I\u2019d regularly carried those mini-single-serving boxes around for snacking between classes. My pastry instructor found a box of Sugar Smacks sticking out of my purse in class one day and embarrassed me so thoroughly for my \u201ctoddler palate\u201d that I\u2019d lost my taste for them. But now I wanted a bowl of marshmallowy, sugar-coated goodness\u2014badly. But what I had was fancy cheeses, eggs, and brioche.</p><p>So, instead of Lucky Charms, I had a spinach and feta omelet.</p><p>This just wouldn\u2019t do.</p><p>\u2014</p><p>On my safari into the Shop \u2019n Save, I grabbed my Lucky Charms, and some Cap\u2019n Crunch for good measure. I bought Oreos, Pop-Tarts, and the makings of Fluffernutter sandwiches\u2014things I\u2019d loved as a kid but had abandoned for the sake of refining my palate. After recovering from the shock of how little I\u2019d spent at the register, I tucked the grocery bags underneath the front seat of my car and cast a longing glance down the quaint little street. It was one of those old-fashioned Main Street arrangements, skinny two-story buildings all bunched up against one another\u2014a hardware store, an antiques store, one of those old-fashioned ice cream parlors, and a sandwich shop called the Three Little Pigs. The cars lining the parking lots were older but well maintained, and the people milling around did it pretty slowly. This was not the place for the Hollow\u2019s young and hip to do their errands.</p><p>Did the Hollow have a young and hip crowd?</p><p>I didn\u2019t want to go home just yet. So I walked. I window-shopped at the antiques store and browsed the selections at the ice cream parlor for later reference.</p><p>I walked past the Three Little Pigs, a snug little brick building with a ridiculously charming cartoon sign. Catching sight of a patron chowing down on a triple-decker ham sandwich through the front window, I seemed to be moving over the threshold before I could stop myself. I was just in time for a late lunch, and I was hoping that whatever I ordered incorporated cheese fries in some way. I hadn\u2019t had cheese fries in years.</p><p>The interior was done in dark panels and black-and-white hunting photos, presumably of the owner\u2019s family. The menu was scrawled on a chalkboard in bright colors. The smell was incredible, so many layers of scent\u2014fresh bread, frying bacon, melting cheese. I had to catch myself to keep from drooling all over the floor. This might be even better than Lucky Charms. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>With an emphasis on carnivorous delights, the Three Little Pigs seemed to be primarily a sandwich shop. If it once had a pulse, it could be grilled, fried, braised, or roasted, then slapped between two slices of bread and delivered to your table. I was trying to decide between the house specialty\u2014pork chop on wheat, topped with grilled ham and bacon\u2014or starting off small with a turkey club, when a dill pickle flew over the opposite side of my booth and smacked me square in the eye.</p><p>\u201cSonofa\u2014\u201d I yelped, turning to see the adorable strawberry blond toddler who had blinded me with dill brine. \u201cGun,\u201d I finished lamely.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry!\u201d a beautiful auburn-haired woman gushed, stepping around the booth and handing me a napkin to dab at my stinging, stinky eye. Her tinny country twang contrasted sharply with the fierce elegance of her face, but I doubted the sandy-haired man sitting with her minded all that much. \u201cWe\u2019re still workin\u2019 on hand-eye coordination and table manners. Trust me, they normally don\u2019t waste a bite.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat really stings,\u201d I marveled as she hovered.</p><p>\u201cI know, it\u2019s the vinegar,\u201d she said, clucking her tongue and offering more napkins. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>I snorted a little. \u201cThat\u2019s OK. \u2018Blinded by flying pickles\u2019 goes nicely with the rest of my week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Jolene Lavelle, and this is my husband, Zeb.\u201d She gestured to the sandy-haired man, who was currently scrubbing barbecue sauce from the boy twin\u2019s face. \u201cAnd these are our twins, Janelyn and Joe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you,\u201d I said, swiping at my eye one last time. \u201cTess Maitland.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou new in town?\u201d Jolene drawled.</p><p>\u201cYeah, how can you tell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe accent. You don\u2019t have one.\u201d</p><p>I chuckled. \u201cI\u2019m from Chicago. I\u2019m just visiting the area for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re not having a very good time?\u201d Zeb asked, his big brown doe eyes sympathetic. \u201cYou said a pickle to the eye went with the rest of your week. That can\u2019t be a good vacation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on over here, honey, and tell us all about it,\u201d Jolene said, dragging me out of my booth. Geez, this girl was crazy strong for someone so slight. As she pushed me into the seat opposite Joe the pickle flinger, she yelled for someone named Maybelline to bring her a \u201ctall blue.\u201d</p> <p>I really hoped that was some sort of home-brewed moonshine, because I could have used a drink right about then.</p><p>Imagine my surprise when a tall blue turned out to be a large blue glass bottle of homemade root beer, which Jolene swore would cheer me right up. It was tasty, with strong undertones of sassafras and ginger. The lack of carbonation was a little weird, but it settled my stomach almost instantly, and the lift in blood sugar helped my outlook considerably.</p><p>Jolene took the kids behind the counter and handed them off to two equally pretty waitresses, who bore a strong resemblance to my new friend. The ladies bobbed the babies on their hips and fed them bits of smoked sausage, which could not possibly be good for them. Then again, those kids seemed to have a lot of teeth.</p><p>Jolene snapped me out of my thoughts by sliding onto the bench seat next to me. \u201cOK, now you have my full attention. Let\u2019s hear it.\u201d I lifted my eyebrows at her commanding tone. \u201cOh, come on, you look like your head\u2019s about to pop off. You\u2019re dyin\u2019 to talk to someone. Now, spill.\u201d</p><p>I looked to Zeb, who smiled at his wife fondly. \u201cIt\u2019s best to just do what she asks. She\u2019ll get it out of you somehow.\u201d</p><p>I sighed. \u201cIt\u2019s just, this house I\u2019m renting, I have an \u2018unexpected\u2019 roommate. I would feel sorry for him, but he\u2019s kind of rude and prickly. And I can\u2019t get rid of him because I don\u2019t have superstrength.\u201d</p><p>On and on, I rambled about the house, which I loved, and Lindy, whom I didn\u2019t have any fond feelings for, about Sam and Phillip and talking arugula, until I finished with \u201cMy professional reputation is in shreds. I haven\u2019t had sex in six months, and I\u2019m starting to think that after a certain period of disuse, everything grows over down there. Plus, I don\u2019t know if I have a job or health insurance to go back to, so how am I going to afford the reconstructive hooha surgery?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d Jolene marveled. \u201cThat was an impressive rant.\u201d She shot a look to her husband. \u201cThat was a Jane rant.\u201d</p> <p>Zeb grinned and shrugged, as if answering some unspoken question from his wife. There was a nonverbal coziness to their communication that made my chest ache a bit. I\u2019d never had that kind of intimacy with any of my boyfriends.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all going to be just fine, Tess. You\u2019ll see. You just relax now, while I get us a little lunch.\u201d</p><p>Jolene returned to the table with two trays piled high with all sorts of foods that I didn\u2019t recognize\u2014colorful casseroles and fried mystery items and ribs.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no way the three of us could eat all this!\u201d I cried, rising to help her heft the trays. \u201cPlease let me know what the check total is, so I can cover my share.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPay?\u201d Zeb scoffed. \u201cMcClaines eat free at the Three Little Pigs. Otherwise, we wouldn\u2019t get access to Aunt Lulu\u2019s special seven-layer salad. She doesn\u2019t give that to just anybody.\u201d</p><p>Without responding, I poked at the mayonnaise-covered bowl skeptically. \u201cWhy don\u2019t I see any green vegetables in that salad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSurrounded by beautiful smartasses, that\u2019s my lot in life.\u201d Zeb sighed, lifting his eyes to the ceiling.</p><p>\u201cEverything you see here was made by my family, except for the pulled pork and the ribs,\u201d Jolene said, unloading her culinary treasures with a practiced hand. \u201cIt\u2019s on special, provided by the Volunteer Fire Department. They\u2019re hosting a barbecue booth at Burley Days, and they needed the practice. My uncles don\u2019t handle barbecue very well, which is why they don\u2019t usually serve it here. Something about the smokers and fire\u2014they get all wound up bein\u2019 manly men and end up overcookin\u2019 the meat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOutdoor cooking has been known to do that. So, seven-layer salad?\u201d I said, lifting a brow and staring at some well-disguised romaine lettuce that seemed to be topped with mayonnaise and bacon.</p><p>Jolene shook her head in a maternal fashion. \u201cHold on, sweetie, we have to start you out slow. We\u2019ll work you up to seven-layer salad. You\u2019re new to this whole Southern comfort food thing, and I don\u2019t want you to get sick off your first try.\u201d</p><p>I scanned the table to try to find something I recognized. \u201cHow is it that I grew up just a few hundred miles from here and I\u2019ve never heard of these dishes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have a recipe-hoarding border patrol at the Illinois state line,\u201d Jolene deadpanned.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t possibly eat all of this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust watch,\u201d Zeb muttered. \u201cJolene will mow through this in no time flat.\u201d</p><p>I wondered at the crack on Jolene\u2019s eating habits, particularly from Zeb, since she didn\u2019t have a spare ounce on her and she\u2019d recently given birth to his twins. But there was no malice in expression or tone. It was fond, as if he was just waiting for the word to run and get another tray full of food. The silly, love-struck look on his face made my heart ache a little.</p><p>Jolene began systematically loading my plate with little scoops of every dish. I sampled a few familiar things\u2014potato salad, corn casserole, three-bean salad. But when I got to the orangey-yellow substance that sort of resembled scrambled eggs with little red bits, I poked it with my fork. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. But what the hell is this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHomemade pimento cheese,\u201d Jolene said. I took a little bite. \u201cVelveeta, pimentos, and mayonnaise. Oh, and bacon. It\u2019s Aunt Vonnie\u2019s recipe.\u201d</p><p>I swallowed, then took a huge gulp of water to wash down the gelatinous mass of funk. \u201cIs Aunt Vonnie here?\u201d I asked. And when they shook their heads, I shuddered, wiping at my mouth with my napkin. \u201cWhy? Oh, my God, why would anyone do that to an innocent processed food product?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe that pimento cheese was invented as a practical joke by two mean old church ladies, but they died before they could get their laugh in,\u201d Zeb told me. \u201cWe are left with their legacy of mean-spirited hospitality.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going for the seven-layer salad,\u201d I told Jolene, aiming my fork for the bowl of lettuce, peas, bacon, shredded cheese, and purple onions, covered in a dressing consisting of mayonnaise, parmesan cheese, and sugar.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say I didn\u2019t warn you,\u201d she retorted as I forked a healthy sample into my mouth.</p><p>Seven-layer salad was freaking amazing. Simple, fresh, and green, with a series of flavors tumbling against my tongue like dominoes. \u201cThis should not be as good as it is,\u201d I told her, taking another huge bite.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the great mystery of Southern cuisine,\u201d Jolene intoned.</p><p>\u201cAnd what\u2019s that?\u201d I asked, stabbing through a cornflake crust to find a bubbling mixture of cheese and potatoes.</p><p>\u201cHash-brown casserole\u2014hash browns, cream of mushroom soup, cheddar cheese, and a couple of other things.\u201d</p><p>I put a scoop into my mouth. It was everything that was good about comfort food, warm and cheesy and gooey and savory. I tucked more into my mouth, moaning indecently.</p><p>\u201cWould you two like to be alone?\u201d Zeb asked, eyeing the casserole.</p><p>\u201cI think so,\u201d I said, sighing happily as I swallowed another bite.</p><p>\u201cEasy, girl.\u201d Jolene chortled. \u201cPulling the full Meg Ryan is not a good way to introduce yourself to Half-Moon Hollow society.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll try to contain myself,\u201d I promised.</p><p>This was what food was supposed to be. This was satisfying, filling, comforting. Food was supposed to feed you, body and soul. It was so simple that I felt stupid for not seeing it sooner. Pink Himalayan sea salt? Was just freaking salt. Black truffles? Stinky mushrooms, and I really never liked the taste of them anyway. Smoked extra-virgin olive oil? Well, that was pretty awesome. I couldn\u2019t really give that up.</p><p>Food could be simple. Food could be anything you wanted, whether the ingredients came from a farmer\u2019s market or a convenience store. Food could be fan-freaking-tastic.</p><p>I shook my head, as if to clear it, and took another bite of cheesy potatoes. Maybe Jolene had slipped some sort of hallucinogen into my portion.</p><p>I didn\u2019t care all that much.</p><p>Zeb unwrapped a steaming aluminum-foil packet the size of a basketball. \u201cNow, this is pulled pork shoulder. We\u2019re going to give it to you straight, no sauce, at first, because I figure you\u2019d appreciate it by itself. But there are three levels of sauce here in these little cups. Mild, which is basically ketchup, the sort of thing we give to the kids. Hot, which is more of a Tabasco-sauce level of heat. And nuclear, which I do not recommend, even if you enjoy spicy food. There are some intestinal consequences that cannot be undone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEw!\u201d Jolene squealed. \u201cZeb!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe ate pimento cheese in public. Her threshold for gross is pretty high,\u201d he said, shrugging.</p><p>\u201cHe has a point,\u201d I conceded, placing a small bite of the pink-gray smoked meat on my tongue. I gripped the picnic table for support as a shudder of pleasure rippled up from my throat. Everything that was good about meat was currently in my mouth.</p><p>I sincerely hoped I hadn\u2019t just said that out loud.</p><p>\u201cHow have I never had barbecue like this before?\u201d I demanded, forking more meat onto my plate. I could taste garlic, white pepper, paprika, the smoky essence of cumin. My mind immediately began scanning my internal wine list to select which vintage would offset the tangy hickory flavor. \u201cI thought barbecue was supposed to be all gloppy sauce and burned ends. But this is like a meat marshmallow, slightly caramelized on the outside, and bursting with soft, moist flavor inside. This is\u2014\u201d I paused to lick my fingers. \u201cHow do they do this? What temperature do they use? For how long? Are they just using hickory, or do I detect a note of applewood, too? The smoker, is it aluminum or cast-iron?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Because she had no answers for me, Jolene simply led me over to the booth where most of the Half-Moon Hollow Volunteer Fire Department was having lunch and introduced me to the cooks, Anna and Joe Bob. They were more than happy to discuss the ins and outs of the smokers, the hickory wood used to smoke and flavor the meat as it cooked, and the base for the sauces. Joe Bob promised to show me which cuts of pork shoulder worked best and how to keep the ribs from drying out before they cooked completely.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re firing up another batch at dawn if you wanna come by,\u201d Anna offered cheerfully, her round, cherubic cheeks smudged with soot from the smoker. \u201cYou could see the whole shebang from start to finish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would love to!\u201d I exclaimed, clapping and hopping up and down like a cranked-up game-show contestant.</p> <p>\u201cAre you going to keep doing that?\u201d she asked, lifting her eyebrow.</p><p>I bit my lip and stopped with the hopping. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll get along just fine, then.\u201d</p><p>Now, That\u2019s a Spicy Vampire!</p><p>5</p> <p>It was a matter of timing. Sam never left the basement door unlocked while he was awake. So in the window of time between his warming up his \u201cwake-up\u201d blood and showering, I managed to slip into the basement to do my dirty work and ducked out the front door before he saw me.</p><p>Jolene had invited me to join her book club for the evening, despite the fact that I hadn\u2019t read The Night Circus. I\u2019d expected a bunch of frustrated housewives slugging back wine in some well-appointed suburban living room. And while there was wine, the group was made up of open, friendly gals who met at a funky little bookshop called Specialty Books.</p><p>The interior of the shop was a cheerful mix of paperback pop culture and antique tomes. The walls were painted a cheerful midnight blue, with a sprinkle of twinkling silver stars. There were comfy purple chairs and caf\u00e9 tables arranged around the room in little conversation groups. The leaded-glass and maple cabinet that held the cash register displayed a collection of ritual knives and candles that I didn\u2019t quite understand. I was OK with not understanding.</p><p>The store had an impressive selection of cookbooks, everything from Introducing Variety to the Undead Diet to Food Gifts for Faerie Folk. I found a deeply discounted title on drinkable sauces for vampires, but Jane, the shopkeeper and book club organizer, warned me against it. It turned out the recently turned French chef\u2013author had not bothered to test his recipes, and his use of eggs, flour, and purees had made several hapless vampire customers quite ill. Jane only kept the book on the shelves because it was something of a cookbook cautionary tale.</p><p>Jane was a vampire, as were her manager, Andrea, and several members of the club. At first, I worried that it was a setup, that Sam had somehow managed to round up some of his undead friends to strong-arm me out of town. But then Jane referred to me as Jolene\u2019s \u201cpocket-sized new friend,\u201d and I figured that was more humor than one usually found in a paid assailant.</p><p>Jane and Andrea were funny, smart, and snarky as hell, having both been turned in the last five years and having a more human perspective than most vampires. Although they were obviously close, the ladies were polar opposites on the vampire fashion spectrum. Titian-haired Andrea was polished and perfect in a peach sweater set and pearls, while tousled brunette Jane was wearing jeans over her impossibly long legs and a T-shirt touting \u201cDick Cheney for President\u20142012.\u201d When I asked her about it, she grumbled that she\u2019d lost a bet with Andrea\u2019s husband.</p> <p>After paying lip service to the book of the month, the women broke up into smaller \u201cdiscussion groups,\u201d and I learned all about Jane\u2019s sordid history in the vampire community, including the fact that she\u2019d been turned after a local drunk mistook her for a deer and shot her. A vampire, Gabriel, to whom Jane was now married, saved her by turning her, and they lived happily ever after. Sort of.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that an unusual way to be turned?\u201d I asked, sipping the surprisingly tasty latte Andrea had prepared for me. \u201cI mean, you\u2019d think you guys would make it into the news more often if \u2018mistaken for a deer and shot\u2019 was the average vampire experience.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Jane is very unusual,\u201d Andrea said, rolling her eyes. \u201cBut she was given a choice about whether she wanted to be turned, which is the norm nowadays. Despite the fact that it\u2019s illegal to turn a human into a vampire against their will, some of us weren\u2019t afforded that luxury. But we make the best of it.\u201d</p><p>I noticed the slightly pained expression on Jane\u2019s face as she gave Andrea\u2019s shoulder a little squeeze. I got the feeling there were details about Andrea\u2019s transition that I was missing, but it would be rude to ask. Andrea shrugged and handed Jane what looked like a mochaccino.</p><p>\u201cWait a minute,\u201d I said. \u201cI thought you guys couldn\u2019t eat human food.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t. But Andrea and I have been experimenting for years with all those fancy coffees that folks can\u2019t seem to live without, trying to find ways to make them more palatable for vampires.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInteresting!\u201d I exclaimed. \u201cWould you mind if I asked you about your techniques?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTess is a chef,\u201d Jolene said proudly. \u201cIn one of those big-city restaurants where the paparazzi lie in wait for celebrities.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJolene made friends with a chef, color me shocked,\u201d Andrea said, smirking and shaking her head.</p><p>Again with the cracks about Jolene\u2019s eating? Had Jolene recently lost a bunch of weight? She\u2019d eaten a pretty hefty lunch at the Three Little Pigs, so she wasn\u2019t dieting. Either way, it was sort of shitty for her friend to poke fun at her.</p><p>I was about to jump to her defense when Jane piped up in a desperate tone, \u201cSo, Tess, I\u2019m always interested in how people ended up in their professions. Why did you start cooking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good at it,\u201d I said, shrugging.</p><p>Jane didn\u2019t seem satisfied with this and leaned a bit closer, staring into my eyes as if there were secret messages written on my corneas. \u201cBut you didn\u2019t know that until you started. And that\u2019s what I was asking, how did you start cooking?\u201d</p><p>A bit rattled by Jane\u2019s gaze and feeling very much like a lobster over a pot of boiling water, I blurted out, \u201cCooking made sense, even when I was a kid. You put eggs, milk, and cinnamon on bread, you got French toast. As long as I followed the rules, I knew what the outcome would be. It was one of the few areas of my life that was predictable. And most of the time, if my parents were eating something I made, their mouths were too full to bicker. It was quite the incentive.\u201d</p><p>My mouth snapped shut like a steel trap. I stirred my cappuccino, shocked that I\u2019d said so much. I rarely talked about my parents, even with Chef. Hell, in those two sessions of therapy I\u2019d attended, I hadn\u2019t said more than, \u201cMy parents were well-intentioned but selfish people who would probably be making each other\u2014and me by extension\u2014miserable today if they hadn\u2019t died.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you mind if I ask why you\u2019re so curious about vampires?\u201d Jane asked, sensing somehow that I needed a change in topics. \u201cJolene said you would probably have some questions for us.\u201d</p><p>I cleared my throat, commanding my brain to produce more polite conversation. \u201cOh, I live with one. Not quite voluntarily.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnyone we know?\u201d Andrea asked.</p><p>\u201cSam Clemson,\u201d I said.</p><p>Andrea and Jane both tilted their heads and gave me the \u201caw\u201d face. \u201cPoor Sam.\u201d Jane sighed.</p><p>\u201cWhy \u2018poor Sam\u2019?\u201d I asked. \u201cI mean, other than he\u2019s married to a ring-tailed bitch.\u201d</p><p>Silence. My comment was met with complete, stone-faced silence. I bit my lip, afraid that I\u2019d offended my new acquaintances. But then Jane burst out laughing and exclaimed, \u201cThank you!\u201d while Andrea rolled her eyes.</p><p>Andrea said, \u201cLindy\u2019s not that bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe tricked Tess into renting her house without telling her Sam was sleeping in the basement,\u201d Jolene informed her.</p><p>\u201cOh, then she\u2019s an evil she-beast,\u201d Andrea conceded. I chuckled, and she shrugged. \u201cMy opinions are very adaptable. They have to be when you\u2019re married to a vampire named Dick Cheney.\u201d</p><p>Jane\u2019s T-shirt made much more sense now.</p><p>\u201cI actually meant \u2018poor Sam,\u2019 as in he was one of the vampires we were talking about, the ones who don\u2019t get a choice about whether they were turned or not,\u201d Jane said. \u201cYou know Sam was a contractor, right?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cActually, I don\u2019t know anything beyond Sam\u2019s the cranky guy who lives in my basement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSam was pretty well known around here for being a trustworthy guy,\u201d Jolene said. \u201cHe did quality work at a fair price, and you didn\u2019t have to worry about him raiding your jewelry box while you were out. We hired him to finish up our house after some, uh, other companies failed to do the work they\u2019d been paid for.\u201d</p><p>Jane smirked but didn\u2019t elaborate. \u201cSam and Lindy moved here about six months before Sam took a job for an old-school vampire who\u2019d just moved into the area. The vampire\u2014his name was Hans something\u2014asked for a light-proof sleeping compartment to be added to his bedroom closet. When Sam finished it, the vampire decided he didn\u2019t want a human knowing where his evil lair was and drained him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought it was illegal to forcibly turn a human.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTechnically, he didn\u2019t turn him. Hans just drained him until it would be impossible for Sam to survive and dumped him in the woods behind his house to let nature take its course. Fortunately, Hans was already under surveillance for some suspicious feeding activity over in Murphy. When the head of the local Council, Ophelia, saw him tossing Sam\u2019s body, she stepped in and had one of her Council goons turn him. Ophelia would do just about anything to avoid scandal for the vampire community. Draining innocent human temp workers would qualify as a PR disaster.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, Lindy pitched a fit, told everybody in town that Sam had gone off the deep end, had an early midlife crisis, fooled around with some vamp-tramp, and got himself \u2018infected,\u2019\u201d Jolene said. \u201cOh, and because of the physical trauma he\u2019d been through, it took Sam nearly five days to transform into a vampire, which is practically unheard of. The Council admitted that it was possible that Sam might not make it through the transformation to vampire, and Lindy managed to get some judge to declare him too dead and/or incompetent to handle his own affairs, which was a legal first. There was no will, and Lindy got everything. She controls every bit of their money until the divorce goes through. Sam gets an allowance for his blood and utilities.\u201d</p><p>I mulled that over for a moment. Part of me felt sort of bad for him, in love with a woman who couldn\u2019t see him as the same person she\u2019d married, just because his diet and waking hours had changed. And then I remembered the previous Tuesday, when he\u2019d hidden every product I had that contained caffeine\u2014after keeping me up until 3:00 A.M. with the melodious screams of a jigsaw. My sympathy was short-lived.</p><p>\u201cHonestly, I think he just hasn\u2019t adjusted to unlife yet,\u201d she said. \u201cSam seems like a do-it-yourself kind of guy. And those first few months as a vampire, all you need is help. You feel like you\u2019re losing your connection to the human world and your place in it. You need someone to help you figure out your new schedule, how to feed without hurting your human donor, to vampire-proof your house. Sam went through all that alone.\u201d</p><p>A strange, hot sensation twisted in my belly. What if Sam felt like that? What if he was lost and alone? Here I was making life that much more difficult for him, taking away from what little time he had left in his own home. I felt something shift inside me, a little spark of empathy I\u2019d been missing for a while.</p><p>I jumped to my feet, nearly knocking over the little caf\u00e9 table and our coffees. \u201cI\u2019ve got to go.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat? Why?\u201d Jolene\u2019s surprised expression morphed into wary resignation. \u201cWhat did you do?\u201d</p><p>I cringed, thinking of the various traps I\u2019d left around the house for Sam. Suddenly, Jane burst out laughing and clapped her hand over her mouth.</p><p>My own jaw dropped. Could Jane read my mind?</p> <p>Jane winked at me and nodded.</p><p>I would worry about that later.</p><p>I dug my keys out of my bag. \u201cSomeone may have sprayed down the basement steps with high-viscosity cooking spray, making them superslick.\u201d</p><p>Jolene sighed as Jane struggled to cover her snickers with her hand. \u201cTess.\u201d</p><p>I held my hands, defenseless. \u201cNo, I said someone.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think you\u2019ve taken this prank thang a little too far?\u201d she asked. \u201cI mean, some of these tricks are sort of stupid and juvenile, not to mention sort of mean.\u201d</p><p>I dashed toward the door. \u201cThis was really the least stupid or juvenile idea I had. You should have seen what I had planned with a can of Sterno and a jar of pineapple jelly.\u201d</p><p>Jolene slapped her palm over her face as I opened the door. Over the tinkle of the little cowbell above the door frame, I heard Jane say, \u201cI really like her.\u201d</p><p>\u2014</p><p>After driving across town in record time, I dashed into the house just as Sam opened the microwave. The house was still standing, which was a good sign. Sam was in the kitchen, apparently uninjured, also a good sign. What was not good was that he was making his dinner, tossing a warmed bag back and forth between his hands to settle the red cells.</p><p>\u201cLook, I\u2019ve had a bad night at work, and I really don\u2019t want to deal with you right now.\u201d He sighed, his shoulders sagging underneath his faded John Deere T-shirt.</p> <p>Stalled midwarning, I raised an eyebrow. Work? Since when did Sam work? And where? Was that where he was all those nights when the construction noises didn\u2019t start until the wee hours? I thought he was slow-playing me, depriving me of sleep with the anticipation of torture. Had he been out on a job? This new perspective changed the way I\u2019d looked at a lot of the stunts I\u2019d chalked up to Sam\u2019s mean temper. Maybe he was leaving the chores around the house half-finished because he didn\u2019t have the time he needed, not because he wanted to the leave the house unlivable. Then again, that didn\u2019t explain the Saran Wrap. Or the stove.</p><p>\u201cSam, you really don\u2019t want to do that,\u201d I cautioned as he reached toward the cabinet where we kept the coffee mugs. In my haste, I bumped into a saucepan I\u2019d set on the stove. The handle came away in my hands, and the metal bowl clattered to the floor. I gasped in horror as the pieces of my dismantled darling came clattering to a standstill. I shot him a murderous look. He smirked at me, his dark eyes twinkling. I jerked open the drawer where I kept my pots and pans. Everything I touched came apart in my hands. Somehow Sam had managed to remove the rivets from my pans.</p><p>I whirled on him. \u201cYou no-good, undead douche!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, with those dulcet tones, it really is surprising that some lucky man hasn\u2019t snatched you right up,\u201d he said, smirking.</p><p>Snarling, I whipped the pan handle at him. He used his unnatural speed to duck out of the way, which was fortunate, because I threw it so hard that it broke through the plaster behind his head.</p><p>\u201cYou!\u201d I growled. \u201cWhat the hell is wrong with you? Do you have any decency? You wanna hide my stuff? Fine. Use sleep deprivation to drive me into a psychotic episode? All righty, then. But when you mess around with my pans, that\u2019s going just one step too freaking far!\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally, this is what pushed you over the edge?\u201d he asked blandly as he poured his warmed blood into a mug. \u201cI messed around with your cookware?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t touch a chef\u2019s pans!\u201d I shouted as he took a long drink, wincing as the blood rolled down his throat. I smiled sweetly, pulling a carefully wrapped dropper bottle from my pocket and placing it on the counter in front of me.</p> <p>\u201cWhat the?\u201d he asked, clearing his throat and pulling at the collar of his plaid work shirt. By now, he was feeling that tickle of discomfort near the back of his tongue, that feeling that something was definitely not right with his evening meal.</p><p>\u201cEver hear of something called the ghost chili?\u201d I asked, rolling the plastic-wrapped extract bottle between my thumb and forefinger. \u201cIn the pepper family, it\u2019s basically the crazy cousin who just got out of prison, around a million units on the Scoville heat scale.\u201d He gave me a confused frown, and if I wasn\u2019t mistaken, there was just the hint of sweat popping out on his upper lip. I didn\u2019t know vampires could sweat. \u201cThat\u2019s about four hundred times hotter than the average jalape\u00f1o pepper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you do?\u201d he demanded, rubbing at his throat. With the rush of spicy blood to his cheeks, I could see what he had looked like as a human, ruddy and virile, like something out of a \u201cHunky Farmhand of the Month\u201d calendar.</p><p>I cleared my own throat, forcing myself to focus. This was war, damn it. Dirty, nasty, nonsexy war.</p><p>\u201cWell, I called my friend Sakar, who works in my favorite spice shop, and asked him where I could find something special.\u201d I grinned nastily. \u201cFor my roommate. He just happened to know a store about forty miles from here that carries extract of ghost chili.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou put it in my blood bag?\u201d He grunted, coughing and spluttering as the capsaicin set flame to his tongue. He reached into the fridge, tore open another bag, and dumped the still-cold contents into his mouth.</p><p>I snickered. \u201cNot just that bag.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAugh!\u201d he cried, dropping the doctored bag and running for the faucet. He stuck the sprayer into his mouth and turned it on full blast. When that failed to quell the heat raging through his mouth, he ran for the shower.</p><p>\u201cDid I mention that water only makes the oil spread around?\u201d I called. I dropped the bottle into the trash. Thinking better of it, I fished the bottle out, emptied it, and buried it in the backyard so he couldn\u2019t use it against me later.</p><p>When I came back into the house, a very wet, very red Sam was practically vibrating with rage. His fangs were down, and he looked every inch the dangerous vampire. I suddenly wondered about the wisdom of this weird little war. And it occurred to me that I should have had those worries before I pranked someone with superstrength.</p><p>\u201cSo, no yelling?\u201d I asked, faking bravery as he glowered down at me. \u201cNo calling me names or making empty threats?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He scooped his hands under the lines of my jaw and dragged me to him. I squeaked as his mouth clashed with mine, pulling my tongue into his mouth to dance with his. I braced myself against his bare chest, fingertips digging into the cool flesh. His lips dragged across mine, and his tongue rippled over every ridge and bump of my mouth. He bit harshly down on my bottom lip, drawing just the tiniest bit of blood to the surface. I could feel my nipples blossoming into little points through my shirt as he pulled blood from the wound. It was like some warm thread was running directly from my thighs to the flow of blood, and every time he pulled on it, that thread drew across my nerves with a luxurious tension.</p><p>I was panting as if I\u2019d run a marathon by the time he pulled away.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell was that?\u201d I demanded.</p><p>He leered, halfway between self-satisfied smirk and impish grin. \u201cI just wanted to share.\u201d</p><p>And that\u2019s when the tingling started.</p><p>\u201cOh, motherf\u2014\u201d I gasped as the chili oil that now coated my lips and tongue began to burn. I clapped a hand over my aching, searing lips. \u201cYou!\u201d</p><p>Sam laughed while I ran for the fridge. I felt as if I\u2019d swallowed about a hundred yellow jackets and they were all stinging the absolute shit out of my tongue.</p><p>I reached into the fridge for the only solution I knew of: dairy and popsicles. I ripped the lid off a container of plain Greek yogurt and started licking the contents while I unwrapped a Fudgsicle. I alternated between the two, cursing at him the whole time.</p><p>Because cursing sounds superintimidating when it\u2019s muffled by a Fudgsicle.</p><p>\u201cGive up, you crazy woman,\u201d he growled out. \u201cAnd could you please, please watch the cursing? This isn\u2019t a truck stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I pulled the Fudgsicle out long enough to shout. \u201cYou apologize for dismantling my kitchen!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not your kitchen!\u201d he spat back. \u201cYou apologize for giving me doctored blood. No wonder you got fired. You\u2019re like some sort of evil comic-book villain. You\u2014you\u2019re the Joker!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, all I did was respond in kind. Look, I felt a little sorry for you earlier tonight, because of your bad luck and your tragic marriage. Clearly, empathizing with the enemy was a mistake. Now, either you fix my pans, or I will find brand-new places to put that chili extract, jackass.\u201d I growled, backing out of the room and stalking toward my bedroom.</p><p>He called after me, \u201cI\u2019d say this one was a draw, wouldn\u2019t you, sweetheart?\u201d</p><p>Here in Lunch Lady Land...</p><p>6</p><p>Jolene was not impressed with my vampire-provoking shenanigans.</p><p>\u201cHave I not explained how dangerous it can be to spend time with vampires when they\u2019re in a good mood?\u201d She sighed, frowning at me in that way that only mothers could master.</p><p>Jolene\u2019s powers of emotional concentration would have been more impressive had she not been staring me down while turning her van into a dry cleaner\u2019s parking lot. I was trying to treat the still-tingling nerves of my lips and tongue with a strawberry milkshake from the Dairy Freeze. I was starting to suspect that it was more than just physiological, because nothing was working. It wasn\u2019t even unpleasant anymore, just a lasting, warm tingle over my skin. This couldn\u2019t be normal. \u201cI thought you were goin\u2019 home to prevent your pranks from \u2018goin\u2019 off\u2019 on Sam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI tried to stop it,\u201d I said lamely, clutching the door frame for all it was worth, so I wouldn\u2019t smack my face into the window. \u201cAnd then he took apart my pans and said mean things to me, and I sort of stopped myself from stopping it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo he slipped down the basement steps?\u201d she said, cringing as she pulled to a screeching stop.</p><p>\u201cI forgot about that,\u201d I said. \u201cIt would explain the loud thump I heard before bed.\u201d</p><p>Jolene gave me a withering look.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I grumped, crossing my arms.</p><p>\u201cHave you thought about the fact that under the fangs and the bluster, there\u2019s a person with feelings?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t really care how he feels, Jolene,\u201d I protested. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for what he\u2019s going through. But he\u2019s not the only one out there in pain. I\u2014what is it we\u2019re doing here, again? I thought we were going to Jane\u2019s shop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to make a quick stop first. I work part-time for a vampire concierge service here in town. My boss, Iris, asked me to pick up some of her clients\u2019 dry cleaning. Vampires are hell on clothes, let me tell you. I\u2019ll just be a minute. Do you want to come in?\u201d</p><p>I glanced around the busy corner of Main Street, right off the memorial square of downtown Half-Moon Hollow. There was a classic white gazebo in the center, flanked by golden ginkgo trees and statues of Civil War soldiers. There was a huge plastic banner stretched across the street, advertising \u201cBurley Days! Food, Frolic, and Family Fun!\u201d starting in two weeks.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019ll just wander around, if that\u2019s OK. I\u2019ll meet you back here in a bit.\u201d</p><p>She glanced down the street at the small-town oasis drawing me in and grinned broadly. I was stunned for just a moment by the sheer brilliant expanse of that smile. There was a fierce quality to Jolene, something not quite human rippling under that beauty. I started to wonder whether the reason she was so comfortable with the supernatural was that she was something supernatural.</p><p>Not that I\u2019d let something like that get between us. Other than Chef and George, Jolene was the only real friend I\u2019d made in years. I was determined not to care about it. If she felt like it, she would tell me in her own time. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou do that,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll catch up to you.\u201d</p><p>As Jolene ducked into AAA Cleaners, I perused the posters for Burley Days hung in various shop windows. \u201cFamily Fun\u201d apparently included rides, game, a parade, street performers, and something called the \u201cFirst-Ever Faux Type O Bloody Bake-Off!\u201d which sounded absolutely disgusting. I would be skipping Burley Days.</p><p>I wandered down the street, staring at the old 1930s architecture. In Chicago, these buildings wouldn\u2019t be anything special. The Second City prided itself on preserving anything that had survived the Great Fire, the Depression, and both Richard Daleys. But it was clear that these old banks and general stores were the pride of the Hollow, lovingly restored and newly painted\u2014all except this white and pink two-story building wedged between what were now an antiques shop and a florist. The windows were blocked over with soap, but I could still make out the faded paint reading, \u201cHOWLIN\u2019 HANK\u2019S BBQ, Est. 1968.\u201d</p> <p>The white paint flaked off the brick front like falling snow. The door handle was damaged, as if someone had tried to kick it in. Someone had replaced the old faded Realtor sign with a new one: \u201cA Honey of a Deal! Call Sherry Jameson, Hometown Realtors!\u201d with Sherry\u2019s contact information spelled out in bold red print. Another poster for the Bloody Bake-Off had been tacked over a broken pane in the front door but was now hanging loose at the upper right corner, giving me a glimpse inside.</p><p>Someone had loved this place once but gave up a long time ago. The maroon pleather booths were cracked and peeling. The napkin dispensers consisted of paper-towel racks mounted against the oak paneling. The tables flanked a stout oak bar/counter. Old neon beer signs still hung on the walls, the tubing broken in places; one particularly ornate Budweiser sign was home to a rather large bird\u2019s nest. I could barely see the kitchen through the dining room, but I could make out a huge brick pit in the middle of the space.</p><p>I could see that the dusty tables had been intricately carved with messages. \u201cMarcy Loves Joe Lee, 1976,\u201d or \u201cPetey and Maybelline, First Date, 06/23/81,\u201d or a heart carved around the initials \u201cMH + DW, 1992.\u201d It was sort of sweet, all of these couples marking their lives together on the tables where they\u2019d shared meals. And I was sad that those people, who most likely still lived in the Hollow, couldn\u2019t come back there to visit their little milestone markers.</p><p>I rattled the doorknob, wondering if it counted as breaking and entering if the building was already \u201cbroken.\u201d The knob twisted in my hands, and\u2014</p><p>\u201cKind of sad, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p> <p>Jolene\u2019s voice sounded just behind me, making me jump and smack my head against the decorative rack of ribs hanging low over the doorway. \u201cOw!\u201d</p><p>Jolene continued as if I hadn\u2019t just beaned myself with plaster-of-Paris pork. \u201cThis place was a Half-Moon Hollow institution until about ten years ago. Hank Fowler died, and his kids just didn\u2019t have the business sense or the flair for the kitchen that their daddy did. They limped along until a couple of years ago. They just couldn\u2019t keep the doors open anymore. I don\u2019t know why they\u2019ve never sold the place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo many prospective buyers injured themselves on the low-hanging decorative pig?\u201d I said, rubbing my head. I nodded toward the poster. \u201cOK, explain this Burley Days thing to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the highlight of the Hollow social calendar,\u201d Jolene said, feigning distress at my ignorance. \u201cIt goes back to when burley tobacco was the big crop around here. Local farmers would bring their harvests to the brokers and get paid on one particular weekend each fall. They\u2019d have money to spend, so vendors and carnies showed up every year to take it. It became a big party. Farmers around here have moved on to soybeans and such, but we\u2019ve kept the tradition alive with funnel cake and ring toss. It\u2019s a hoot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow does a Bloody Bake-Off figure into this?\u201d I asked, cringing.</p><p>Jolene wrinkled her nose. \u201cJane says that Faux Type O is sponsoring some sort of cook-off, asking people to come up with recipes using synthetic blood.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy would the company want to do that?\u201d I asked as we ambled back toward the van.</p><p>\u201cNewer vampires miss human food,\u201d she said. \u201cThey want more variety in their diet. Rather than lose their audience, Faux Type O is lookin\u2019 for ways to incorporate its product into the sort of \u2018cravin\u2019 foods\u2019 that new vampires will want. They\u2019re going to put the winning recipes into a cookbook. So if you win, you\u2019re basically selling the rights to the recipe for your prize money.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re hosting the contests all over the country. Ophelia, the head of our local Council office\u2014she\u2019s really scary,\u201d Jolene said. \u201cShe has connections at the beverage company, and she\u2019s good at intimidating city officials. She said she wants to, quote, \u2018integrate the undead community into the Hollow\u2019s traditions.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe gets a cut from the company, doesn\u2019t she?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cProbably.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs Jane going to enter?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Jolene stopped in her tracks, spluttering and choking, nearly doubled over in laughter. When she finally straightened up and wiped at her eyes, she wheezed out, \u201cJane\u2019s first few solo attempts at serving coffee at the shop sent people into convulsions. I don\u2019t think she\u2019s willing to do that, even if it means winning twenty-five thousand dollars.\u201d</p><p>Now it was time for me to splutter. \u201cTwenty-five thousand dollars! You\u2019re telling me some vampire could win twenty-five thousand dollars just for making up a recipe?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t have to be a vampire,\u201d Jolene said, giving me a pointed look. When I scoffed, she cried, \u201cWhat? You cook all the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, for people with pulses and the ability to process solid foods,\u201d I said. \u201cThere are some dietary restrictions even I can\u2019t work with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, leave the vampire judges to deal with Jane\u2019s mama\u2019s Bloody Pot Pie.\u201d Jolene sighed as we climbed into the minivan. \u201cJane\u2019s mama seems to think she can force Jane into eating human food again if she just gives her enough pot pies. If she figures out a way to put Faux Type O in a pot pie, I pity those poor volunteers\u2014including Jane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would Jane volunteer for something like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I said, Ophelia is scary,\u201d Jolene said, shrugging. \u201cSo, are you ready for tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m droppin\u2019 these clothes off, and then you, me, Jane, and Andrea are goin\u2019 out for a girls\u2019 night. Jane hasn\u2019t made any of the plans, so we should be safe. Think you\u2019re up for it?\u201d</p><p>I snorted. \u201cI think I\u2019m ready for whatever nightlife Half-Moon Hollow can dish out.\u201d</p><p>\u2014</p><p>I was so not ready.</p><p>Girls\u2019 night, apparently, meant The Cellar, where it was \u201cCountry-Western Night,\u201d and Jane never paid for drinks, because she\u2019d rescued the owner-bartender during an attempted robbery a few years ago. So we had not only unlimited alcohol but also access to a mechanical bull.</p><p>One of the few things I could remember clearly about the evening was being grateful that Sam wasn\u2019t home when I stumbled through the front door around 2:00 A.M. and broke my fall with my face. But according to the pictures Andrea saved to my phone, I had not only ridden the mechanical bull, I\u2019d borrowed a stranger\u2019s cowboy hat to make my experience more authentic. I thought the hat went very nicely with Andrea\u2019s sparkly black tank top. And the western-wear lover\u2019s phone number appeared to be scrawled on my arm, next to \u201cCall me, Cowgirl!\u201d</p><p>Oh, well, at least he was cute, according to the picture that showed me returning his hat and giving him a big wet kiss on the cheek.</p><p>The rest of the pictures included various shots of Jolene attempting karaoke, Jane hugging Norm, the cuddly bartender whose life she\u2019d saved, and the four of us gathered at the bar, shot glasses in hand, giggling our asses off while Jolene tried to fit all of us into the frame.</p><p>At some point, my friends\u2019 husbands dropped by to scrape our inebriated asses off the barroom floor and drive us home. I\u2019d met Zeb before and liked him. Underneath his oily charm, the vampire Dick Cheney was a really sweet guy who clearly loved Andrea and his friends with the ferocity of a pissed-off honey badger. I sort of recalled that the one guy who tried to hit on me in his presence was given the scariest stink-eyed glare this side of a correctional facility. Jane\u2019s Gabriel was more of a mystery, all brooding silence and stiff upper lip, until Jane made some ridiculous joke and he smiled like a man seeing boobs for the first time. But in a really romantic, courtly way.</p><p>The final picture was a group shot taken by Norm. Somehow I ended up in the middle of all of those couples without sticking out like the sore single thumb. I looked happy. Not just drunk-giddy or relaxed but genuinely, no-holds-barred happy. I couldn\u2019t remember seeing that expression on my own face since... I couldn\u2019t remember seeing that expression on my face.</p><p>Still, it was the deepest night\u2019s (and most of the morning\u2019s) sleep I\u2019d had since I arrived in the Hollow. I rolled onto my back, and the reverberating pain in my head made me instantly regret moving. Zeb, my designated driver, had apparently left a glass of water and some Advil next to my bed when he\u2019d dropped me off. I lifted my head from the pillow, just barely, to look at my alarm clock and saw that I was supposed to be meeting Chef Gamling at the Half-Moon Hollow First Baptist Church in less than an hour. Moving gingerly, I eased up from the bed and reached for the water glass. It only took me three tries to pick it up.</p><p>After scrubbing off eau de barroom, I discovered that Sam not only had soaked all of my clean bras and put them in the freezer, but he had also destroyed yet another cheap pot and left it in the sink. After preparing my traditional hangover cure of a bacon, egg, and tomato sandwich, I barely had time to Super Glue Sam\u2019s car keys to the counter before I was due to meet Chef.</p><p>The Half-Moon Hollow First Baptist Church was one of those classic brick churches with stained-glass windows. I felt nervous walking through the back entrance of the fellowship, as if God would reject my hungover presence in his house like a faulty kidney. But he let me walk all the way into the industrial-sized kitchen unscathed, so figured I wasn\u2019t his top \u201csmiting\u201d priority.</p><p>Chef Gamling was already stationed at the counter, shredding cheddar from a block the size of a football. A gigantic stock pot boiled on the stove, while another pot held a huge batch of green beans with bits of bacon. I could smell ham baking and the cinnamon-spice mix Chef used for his special apple pie recipe.</p><p>\u201cAre we catering a party?\u201d I asked.</p><p>He turned and leveled a critical gaze at my clean jeans and T-shirt, the sensible shoes and tight ponytail. He tossed an apron at me. \u201cYou\u2019ll do.\u201d</p><p>My transition back to Chef\u2019s galley slave was made with alarmingly little force. He had me chopping veggies, straining pasta, making a roux for the basic white sauce he needed. Dealing with hot butter fats was particularly cruel given my hungover state, but I think that was probably the point to Chef\u2019s exercise.</p><p>\u201cWhat exactly are we making?\u201d I asked as he added the shredded cheese to the white sauce.</p><p>\u201cMacaroni and cheese,\u201d he said. \u201cHam. Granny Houston\u2019s famous green beans\u2014a recipe I had to barter a Le Creuset casserole for, thank you\u2014and apple pie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe church has Saturday-afternoon fellowship meals. Everybody from the community is welcome, whether they pay or not, whether they\u2019re members of the church or not. The pastor thinks it\u2019s important for everybody to gather for a good meal, for no other reason than to spend time together. Usually, they play board games or volleyball, depending on the weather. I think the plan for today is an Uno tournament.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to all this trouble\u2014aged cheddar, sauce from scratch, what appears to be green beans combined with bacon, butter, and brown sugar\u2014so you can feed a church crowd mac \u2019n\u2019 cheese before a card game?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThese people deserve good food, carefully prepared, whether it\u2019s simple fare or a wedding feast. They\u2019re going to share a meal, something to bring them closer together. That\u2019s the point of what we do, Tess. Not the reviews or the interviews. Good food. Happy diners. That\u2019s all there is.\u201d</p><p>He pinned me with that frank gray gaze, and I felt a little ashamed of myself. \u201cNow, be a good girl and stir the sauce.\u201d</p> <p>With that, he popped me on the butt with a dishtowel and returned to his nutritionally bankrupt green beans.</p><p>\u2014</p><p>When I was in college, I saw cafeteria serving as the last stop before culinary oblivion. I had nightmares in which I woke up patting my head to make sure the hairnet wasn\u2019t really there. But now I found that I liked greeting people as they came through the kitchen line for their lunches. I liked being able to talk to friendly faces as they moved by, complimenting the colors of the food or the delicious smells wafting up from the steam table.</p><p>I\u2019d never had this sort of contact with customers before. Phillip did his damnedest to make sure I was insulated from dealing with overenthusiastic customers. I rarely left my kitchen, just in case.</p><p>But because these diners liked Chef, I was accepted as his little helper, greeted warmly, and complimented for my addition of smoked paprika to the macaroni and cheese. After we\u2019d fed everyone, some of them twice, Chef made me sit at the counter and eat a huge helping of everything. I wasn\u2019t gaining weight back fast enough, in his opinion. Overall, it was a very pleasant way to spend an afternoon.</p> <p>I guessed Chef didn\u2019t have more Kitchen Yoda wisdom to impart, because he joined the Uno games\u2014leaving me with the dishes, thank you very much. I was up to my elbows in bubbles when a trilling feminine voice behind me cried, \u201cHi there!\u201d</p><p>Jumping and nearly dropping a sixty-four-ounce glass measuring cup on my foot, I turned to see a pretty, slender woman with a brown bob and mischievous hazel eyes. The shape of her mouth reminded me of someone.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you Tess?\u201d she asked, smiling broadly.</p><p>\u201cUm, ye\u2014gah!\u201d I yelped when the woman threw her arms around me and squished me to her bosom.</p><p>\u201cOh, honey!\u201d she exclaimed. \u201cI\u2019m so glad my Jane has a friend who goes to church!\u201d</p><p>Well, I was standing in a church building, so I guess she was technically right.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m Sherry Jameson, Jane\u2019s mama.\u201d She sighed, giving me one last squeeze. \u201cBut you can call me Sherry. All her little friends do. Jane told me you\u2019d be here today, and I just couldn\u2019t wait to meet you! Now, don\u2019t get me wrong, I love Andrea and Jolene, but it\u2019s just so good to know that my daughter spends time with a nice girl. I mean, just look at you, cooking up a storm in the Lord\u2019s kitchen.\u201d</p><p>Now was so not the time to whip out my phone and show her the pictures of Jane and me running tequila boat races. So I settled for a bland smile while Mrs. Jameson pressed a heavy Saran Wrapped package in my damp hands.</p><p>\u201cI made you my special peach cobbler. Jane mentioned you\u2019re a cook, so I knew you\u2019d appreciate a little something sweet. Don\u2019t you worry about sugar or calories, all right, honey? You need a little meat on your bones,\u201d she said. \u201cI used to make this for my Jane all the time, but you know, she doesn\u2019t eat anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I managed to say before Sherry crushed me into another hug, my arms flailing against her back.</p><p>I glanced down at the package in my hands. Mrs. Jameson had cooked for me. I didn\u2019t even know if it was any good. But it was thrilling to have someone else cook something for me, not because she was trying to impress me or drill me for information but for no other reason than that I was a friend of her daughter\u2019s and she thought I needed it.</p><p>Hungover or not, I was going to go home and eat every bite.</p><p>Somewhere in the back of my pickled brain, a switch labeled \u201cSherry Jameson\u201d flipped into place. Now I knew why Sherry\u2019s name sounded so familiar.</p><p>I smiled brightly, though it sort of hurt my cheeks. \u201cAren\u2019t you the Realtor selling Howlin\u2019 Hank\u2019s?\u201d</p> <p>\u2014</p><p>Two hours later, I was in love with the Howlin\u2019 Hank\u2019s building.</p><p>Miss Sherry was honest with me. Hometown Realtors had assigned her this building to test her newly official salesman skills. The agency had been trying to offload the place for years and hadn\u2019t had so much as a nibble. The idea that she could be the one finally to sell it had thrown Sherry into warp speed, as Jane put it.</p><p>Chef Gamling accompanied us as my \u201canti-life-ruining-decision lifeguard.\u201d Before she let me in the front door, Sherry went in to turn on all of the old beer signs and the jukebox. The current selection was a Hank Williams Jr. song made overtly off-key by the warped 45. That\u2019s right. The jukebox was so old it played actual records. Still, the electric display gave me a better idea of what the place had looked like in its heyday.</p><p>Chef Gamling didn\u2019t comment on the dilapidated condition of the building or the sheer amount of beer and/or NASCAR memorabilia on the walls. He simply wandered around the kitchen, his hands clasped behind his back, while he chewed on his lip. The kitchen was in surprisingly good shape, albeit seriously outdated. I would need to replace all of the appliances, but the traffic flow of the room was pitch-perfect for maximum efficiency from the stove to the pass to the dishwashing area.</p><p>The dining room\u2019s open floor plan, the old oak bar worn satiny smooth by countless hands, the wide, spacious booths\u2014it was the perfect setup for a small, informal restaurant. Before I\u2019d even put down my purse, I\u2019d started making plans in my head. I\u2019d keep some of the more retro beer signs, but I would paint the walls a soft denim blue. I would have to replace the tables. But I might be able to preserve the carved tabletops and use them as wall panels.</p><p>I would keep the view to the kitchen open, so the customers would get the feeling that they were just hanging out at a friend\u2019s place, waiting for their meals to be finished. I would replace the battered dartboards with photos of the original Hank\u2019s and maybe a few of the remodel\u2014something to show that I appreciated the history of this place and wanted to be part of it.</p><p>Oh, how I wanted to be part of it.</p><p>I rubbed at my sternum, praying for the acidic roll in my stomach to die down. Could I really do this? Could I stay in the Hollow and open up my own restaurant? Chef Gamling was here. My friends were here. What did I have waiting for me in Chicago?</p><p>I had acquaintances and colleagues in the city but nobody who would take me out for drinks and mechanical-bull rides. I had Phillip, who was waiting for his marriage-license paperwork, not for me. I had my reputation, but that wasn\u2019t exactly keeping me warm at night. It couldn\u2019t even give me the warm sense of fulfillment that it used to.</p><p>I sat down at one of the booths, leaning over to put my head between my knees. Across the table, I could hear the sound of old leatherette crackling. I looked up to squint at Chef, grimacing. \u201cAm I completely insane?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would this be insane?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019ve only cooked. I\u2019ve never managed a restaurant. Because of the risks involved. Because these are disastrous economic times to strike out on my own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is all true,\u201d he conceded. \u201cBut do you want this?\u201d</p><p>I chewed on my lip, nodding. It scared me how much I wanted this. I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d ever wanted something so badly in my life. Sure, I\u2019d wanted to leave my hometown. I\u2019d wanted to graduate. I\u2019d wanted the job at Coda. But this was a different level of desire. I had to have this place. I could feel the desperation down in my bones, crushing my stomach with the anxiety that I might not be able to make it happen.</p><p>I had a place in the city. I had a routine. But I could have a life here. I didn\u2019t exactly fit in, but I could love people here. I was well on my way to loving a few already. And those people could love me if I let them.</p><p>I could do this. I could make a life here. Hell, I already had a life here.</p><p>I wanted to feed people, not just because they had showed up for a business meeting or to be seen. I wanted them to leave my dining room happy. I wanted to cook and not think about whether the ingredients were exotic enough to please the customers. I wanted to serve food that nourished people, that made them feel comfort, whether it meant using Velveeta or ungodly expensive Jarlsberg cheese.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I whispered. \u201cI really want this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you are insane,\u201d Chef said, shrugging. \u201cBut it could be just the kind of insane needed to run this place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot helpful.\u201d I groaned, dropping my head back to the table.</p><p>I felt a cool, damp cloth pressed to the back of my neck and heard a fond tsking sound just in front of me.</p><p>Sherry pressed her handkerchief to my temples and smiled gently. \u201cJane felt the same way just before she decided to renovate her shop. She was so afraid of making a change, so afraid that she would fail. But she couldn\u2019t stand not to try to make a go of it. She\u2019s always been my brave one, you know. Though if you tell her that, I\u2019ll deny it just to keep her on her toes. The bottom line is, life is for living, sweetie. It\u2019s for taking chances and trying to grab up every little piece of happiness you can latch on to. And I say that as a mama and a friend and not someone who stands to make a very healthy commission if you agree to take this place on.\u201d</p><p>I laughed and handed the damp handkerchief back to Sherry.</p><p>I stood and took another look around the restaurant. While my savings were not enough for the real estate market in Chicago, I had more than enough for the down payment on the building. Heck, given Hank\u2019s kids\u2019 desire to unload the building, I might be able to buy it outright, if Sherry and I were clever enough. The problem would be the cost of renovating; I would have to figure out a way to pay for that.</p><p>I needed to make this change. I needed this town. I needed the slower pace, the quiet. I needed the people here. This was my place now.</p><p>I edged toward the dusty old chalkboard behind the bar, advertising the specials and \u201cpie du jour\u201d in place when Hank\u2019s had closed. I took the eraser and carefully swiped off the old chalk marks. The brittle white chalk nearly crumbled under my touch, but I was able to scratch out what I wanted. \u201cHoney-smoked pork with apples,\u201d I wrote. \u201cCorn fritters with spicy relish. Dessert of the day: raisin brioche bread pudding.\u201d</p><p>I stood back and admired my handiwork.</p><p>\u201cI would have served a chutney with the fritters,\u201d Chef said, sniffing.</p><p>My lips twitched. \u201cWell, it\u2019s not your restaurant.\u201d</p><p>He sighed, rolling his eyes heavenward. \u201cSassy-mouthing again.\u201d</p><p>Sherry grinned at my very first selection of specials. \u201cI take it you\u2019ve made a decision?\u201d</p><p>I turned and threw my arms around her and squealed, a very un-Tess-like squeal. She laughed again and patted my back. \u201cIs it OK to hug your Realtor?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Sherry gave me a very momlike little squeeze. \u201cI\u2019ll allow it this once.\u201d</p><p>Poaching Territory</p><p>7</p><p>I sat on the front porch, under a purpling sky, mulling over the paperwork for Howlin\u2019 Hank\u2019s. I teetered between giddy joy and abject horror over signing a letter of intent to buy the building. What was I thinking? What had I done? What would I serve? What would I call the place?</p><p>I should have considered that before I signed the papers.</p><p>I made calls to Chicago as I drove, shell-shocked, back to the house. Phillip was very gracious about accepting my resignation and agreed that it would be too awkward to work with me while planning his wedding to someone else.</p><p>As expected, Coda\u2019s owners jumped at the chance to buy me out and promised to deliver a cashier\u2019s check within forty-eight hours. While their offer was generous, considering the economy, it left me with two options: Take out a mortgage for the building and a second loan to cover the costs of renovating, or pay cash for the building and leave myself with a practically nonexistent budget for the facelift. Neither seemed like the ideal situation. While the building was structurally sound\u2014with the exception of some storm damage to the roof\u2014it would need some serious cosmetic work. Key changes usually translated to \u201cexpensive\u201d in construction-speak. The whole prospect made me nervous. Thanks to some youthful indiscretions with a Visa card, my credit wasn\u2019t stellar. Damn my addiction to fancy Belgian knives. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Giving up my apartment would be shockingly easy. I\u2019d barely spent enough time there over the years to make it a home. I hadn\u2019t decorated or added any personal touches. Everything was beige, for cripe\u2019s sake. But the thought of giving up the Lassiter place was singularly depressing.</p><p>Sherry had shown me the apartment above Howlin\u2019 Hank\u2019s and it was perfectly adequate. Or would be, after the renovations that would jack up my construction budget even further. But ultimately, I had enough on my plate taking on the restaurant. I wouldn\u2019t have the time, money, or energy to take on a fixer-upper house.</p><p>If I could find a way to stretch my budget another twenty thousand dollars or so, I\u2019d have enough breathing room to do what I hoped to with the restaurant. But I did not, in fact, have naked pictures with which to blackmail Bill Gates, and I didn\u2019t have anything else to sell, unless you counted my car or a kidney\u2014and I would need both.</p> <p>The sun slipped over the horizon, leaving long lavender shadows in its wake. I buried my face in my hands and groaned. I leaned against the porch railing and looked out over the velvety green lawn. I would miss this place. I would miss having my own quiet space. I would miss waking up every morning to plot revenge against Sam for his pranks, even if I did sort of regret dosing his blood with essence of third-degree tongue burn. Then again, that had led to receiving the hottest kiss of my life, in every sense of the word, so it couldn\u2019t have been a terrible plan.</p><p>A soft thump sounded behind me, making me turn toward the front door. Speak of the bewildering devil. Sam was standing there, framed behind the screen door, his dark hair tousled. He was staring at me, his head tilted at a quizzical angle. I simply stared back, unsure of what else to do. I supposed I should have been nervous, caught in the sights of an apex predator, but there was nothing threatening in his gaze. He seemed curious, a little irritated, as if he were looking at some overpriced abstract painting he couldn\u2019t figure out... because he probably wasn\u2019t supposed to. I tilted my head to mirror his posture, because, frankly, I doubted I\u2019d ever interpret Sam correctly, either. I wanted to. I just didn\u2019t know how to reset our relationship from minor domestic booby-trapping to \u201clet\u2019s be friends.\u201d</p><p>What could we have been, if we hadn\u2019t started off so badly? If we\u2019d just met walking down the sidewalk on Main Street, would we have been friends? Would he have asked me out for coffee, or whatever vampires did for awkward-first-date beverages? It was sad that I would never know. Part of me\u2014a teeny, tiny synapse in the dimmer region of my brain\u2014would even miss Sam when I moved out. Yes, he pissed me off. And yes, he had hurt my pans. But he kept things entertaining. And I couldn\u2019t deny that through the frustrations and near-injuries, we had chemistry. The sort of chemistry that seemed to be melting holes in the screen door at the moment.</p><p>Blinking slowly, Sam seemed to come to his senses and backed away from the screen, closing the front door behind him.</p><p>Well, that was weird.</p> <p>It struck me that it wasn\u2019t a great idea to start my new life in the Hollow with a local vampire pissed off at me. Maybe as a going-away present, I could make something nice for Sam, some variation of whatever he was trying to do with those burned-out saucepans, only edible. He obviously missed real food, and I had sort of tortured him with the lasagna and the brownies. That seemed less OK now that I would probably bump into him at Walmart at some point.</p><p>But where would I start? How did you make blood more palatable? Add other, tastier bloods? Herbs and spices? Make it into gravy? Blood pudding?</p><p>I slapped my hand over my face. How could I forget about something called the Bloody Bake-Off? If I entered the contest and won, the grand prize was $25,000. That would pad my construction budget considerably. And frankly, I didn\u2019t think any other gourmet chefs of my caliber would be entering. My chances of beating Jane\u2019s mom were pretty high. Plus, it couldn\u2019t hurt my reputation locally for word to get around that I was a good enough cook to make vampire food palatable.</p><p>I pulled out my phone and dialed the number listed in my contacts under \u201cJane, if you\u2019re not calling for bail $$.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Jane, it\u2019s Tess,\u201d I said. \u201cDo you know where I sign up for this vampire cooking contest?\u201d</p><p>\u2014</p> <p>My approach to the contest entries was simple. I wanted to make something that reminded the judges of their human days\u2014assuming they remembered them\u2014but still appealed to their vampire palates. Clearly, all of the ingredients had to be liquid. I didn\u2019t even want to risk purees after what Jane had told me about the French cookbook.</p><p>I tried to stay with familiar flavors, nothing too exotic. Hell, I even made a very thin marinara from tomato juice, but I needed some feedback before I decided which entry was the best. I tried tasting a few of my samples, but the weird metallic aftertaste of the Faux Type O overrode any other flavors.</p><p>This brought my favorite vampires, Jane, Gabriel, Andrea, and Dick, to the recently cleaned bar in the Howlin\u2019 Hank\u2019s building. (I was really going to have to come up with a name for the place soon.) The family was more than willing to let me \u201cplay\u201d in the space while the final sale paperwork was ironed out, as long as I paid cash. I was so confident in my ability to win the prize money that I\u2019d agreed. I bought the building outright, saving just a few thousand for the renovations and new equipment.</p><p>The dining room was still pretty beat-up, but I\u2019d done a thorough cleaning. I\u2019d found and washed some shot glasses, then used them to set up a tasting session at the bar.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure it\u2019s safe to eat anything prepared here?\u201d Gabriel asked, obviously trying to keep his tone in the \u201cnonpanic\u201d range as he eyed the defunct beer signs and broken chairs. \u201cDid you say you only had the electricity turned back on this morning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t cook this here,\u201d I assured him. \u201cI cooked it at home, but I didn\u2019t want to stir up my cranky roommate by inviting a bunch of people there. I thought this would be more fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe clearly has Jane\u2019s idea of fun,\u201d Dick muttered to Gabriel.</p><p>\u201cSo, when are you going to start work on this place?\u201d Jane asked, elbowing Dick as I poured shot glasses full of a warm, deep-red concoction.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure. I have to find a contractor who\u2019s willing to work with my budget.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you talk to Sam?\u201d Andrea asked as I sprinkled a tiny bit of rosemary oil over each shot.</p><p>\u201cBecause I don\u2019t want my lower lip nailed to the bar at some point during the construction process?\u201d I asked. \u201cI mean, I\u2019ve done things to him that the Geneva Convention would frown upon. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s going to give me a fair and accurate estimate, Andrea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI might know someone,\u201d Dick said before the other three cut him off with a chorus of \u201cNO!\u201d Dick huffed and crossed his arms over his chest. \u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJolene will help you find someone. If she doesn\u2019t have a cousin who will do it for you, she has a cousin who knows someone who will do it for you,\u201d Jane assured me, lifting a shot glass and sniffing. \u201cSo, what do we have here?\u201d</p><p>I wiped my hands on a dishtowel and did a small curtsy behind the bar. \u201cOK, this is a red-wine reduction with shallots\u2014well, shallot juice\u2014and a few other goodies, and, of course, Faux Type O. It\u2019s basically the go-to sauce for any chef auditioning for a job.\u201d</p><p>The vampires sniffed the glasses and then, giving one another subtly wary looks, knocked back the shots.</p><p>\u201cSo, what do you think?\u201d I said, bouncing up and down on my heels. \u201cShould I stick with this one as the contest entry, or do you want to taste more? Because I\u2019m pretty sure this is the best selection.\u201d</p><p>They stared at me, eyes unnaturally wide. That\u2019s when I noticed that they weren\u2019t smiling. Most people smiled when they were eating my food.</p><p>Dick swallowed heavily, grimacing. \u201cTaste more?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is the best one?\u201d Jane said, dabbing at her mouth with a napkin.</p><p>My eyes flicked to each vampire\u2019s face and their expressions of strained, polite discomfort. They hated it.</p><p>A cold flush of shock and panic skittered down my spine. My brain kept screaming, Impossible! I didn\u2019t make bad food. Even when I made blue-box macaroni and cheese, I did it with flair. And this was my red-wine reduction. Everybody loved my red-wine reduction, even Chef Gamling.</p><p>I\u2019d tasted this batch myself just before adding the blood. It was the perfect mix of sophistication and Southern comfort. Except it wasn\u2019t, because Dick seemed to be trying to scrape his tongue with a napkin without being obvious about it.</p><p>\u201cDoes synthetic blood curdle?\u201d I reached for the shot glass and sniffed. It smelled fine to me, a little coppery under the peppery tang of the sauce, but fine.</p><p>Gabriel cleared his throat. \u201cNo, no, it\u2019s fine. It just a little...\u201d</p><p>Dick murmured, \u201cHow can we put this delicately?\u201d</p><p>Jane took my hands in hers, looked me straight in the eye, and said, \u201cIt tastes like old sandals and feta cheese.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was delicately?\u201d I deadpanned.</p><p>\u201cFor Jane, yes, it was,\u201d Andrea informed me.</p><p>\u201cOK, what could I change?\u201d I asked, my voice hitching slightly. I took a deep breath to stave off the worst of my panic. \u201cShould I season it differently? Change the consistency?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Jane said. \u201cIt\u2019s not even an issue of spices or texture. It just tastes... wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK.\u201d I whisked another set of shot glasses off the counter, the one containing my second choice, an attempt at masking the taste of the blood in an Asian-inspired plum sauce. \u201cTry this one.\u201d</p><p>Dick couldn\u2019t hold the glass to his lips for more than two seconds before shuddering, giving me an apologetic look, and placing the glass back on my tray. When Andrea lifted the glass to her mouth, Dick\u2019s hand shot toward her and pulled the glass out of her grasp. Jane sipped, gagged, and spat the sauce back into her shot glass. Gabriel, who seemed to feel sorry for me, downed the sauce in one gulp. He paled, which was saying something, mumbled \u201cExcuse me,\u201d and ran for the bathroom.</p><p>\u201cWhat am I doing wrong?\u201d I exclaimed.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Jane said sympathetically. \u201cBut you\u2019ll get it. Don\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><p>But I was worried. I refused to subject my guests to further gastronomical torture. I went home to my kitchen and went over my recipes one by one. These were my tried-and-true recipes. I used versions of them at Coda every day. No one hated these. I\u2019d done my research. I\u2019d broken down the flavor profiles on a molecular level to match the right sauce to the right blood type.</p><p>If I didn\u2019t win this contest, I would barely have enough to make Howlin\u2019 Hank\u2019s habitable. I\u2019d been so stupidly confident in my skills, in my ability to blow the locals out of the water, that creating something inedible hadn\u2019t even crossed my mind.</p><p>I felt like such an idiot. Did vampire taste buds really change so much after death? Gabriel described the taste issue as the vampire body\u2019s method of digestive self-defense. The vampire\u2019s brain instinctually knew that solid food would make them sick, so it sent messages to the body that human food was rancid and disgusting. Maybe if I could trick the vampire\u2019s brain into thinking it was just enjoying another cup of blood, I wouldn\u2019t serve them something that tasted like the inside of Mike Tyson\u2019s gym bag.</p><p>\u201cI can fix this,\u201d I assured them. I grabbed the spices and herbal oils I\u2019d brought with me to garnish the shots and went to work doctoring the remaining entries. Dick grimaced but gamely stepped up to the bar. Gabriel rolled his eyes but clearly didn\u2019t want to be outdone in the chivalry department. He stepped forward, too.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t thrown up in more than a year,\u201d Andrea told me, taking her own shot glass in hand. \u201cYou break my streak, and I\u2019m going to be pissed at you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2014</p><p>I\u2019d broken Andrea\u2019s streak and then some. My poor ladies\u2019 room would never be the same.</p><p>Hours later, I sat at the Lassiter house\u2019s kitchen counter, my face buried in my hands. I\u2019d never cooked anything bad before. When I was a culinary student, I\u2019d gotten cocky with the seasonings and turned a simple roast chicken into a garlic-soaked mess. Even then, I\u2019d managed to turn the carcass into a palatable soup and gotten partial credit.</p> <p>\u201cWhat did I do?\u201d I groaned, thunking my head on the counter. I let it rest there as hot tears tracked down my cheeks. If I didn\u2019t come up with a prize-winning entry, I had no shot at the money I needed for renovations. Who would want to eat in a restaurant with a semiprivate bathroom?</p><p>A cool hand awkwardly patted my head, followed by an arm slipping around my shoulder. I glanced up through my hair to see Sam sitting next to me, stretching his body as far away from me as possible, as if he was cuddling up to an incendiary device.</p><p>\u201cThere, there,\u201d he said, his voice resigned and sheepish as he patted my head. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I hurt your pans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I exclaimed, snorting far too loudly as my head popped up.</p><p>Sam looked stricken, his cheeks pale(r) and his brown eyes clouded with concern. His lean frame was curved around mine almost protectively, and I found I didn\u2019t want to move away. Hell, I wanted to move closer. I sniffed, offering him a watery smile.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t flatter yourself. This is not about you.\u201d I waved a hand at my tear-stained cheeks. \u201cThis is just... everything. I\u2019ve been on this roller coaster, feeling like a failure, feeling almost normal, feeling I\u2019ve got it all figured out, and then right back at failure again. Only this time, I don\u2019t know if I can bounce back. I have hubris-ed myself right into a corner, and I don\u2019t even think that\u2019s a verb.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPsfff.\u201d He snorted, pulling a bar stool close to mine and sitting. \u201cFailure. Trust me, I know failure. Whatever this is, it\u2019s just a bump in the road. I moved here to try to save my marriage. And livin\u2019 here is what destroyed it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I said. \u201cI heard that Lindy didn\u2019t handle your, er, transition, very well.\u201d</p><p>He scoffed. \u201cYou know, her brother was one of my best friends. He warned me against her, and not just in that \u2018friends don\u2019t mess around with their friends\u2019 sisters\u2019 way. He told me Lindy was a \u2018wanter.\u2019 She planned and prayed, but then once she had whatever \u2018it\u2019 was, she didn\u2019t want it anymore. She got a degree in marketing but decided she wanted to be a medical coder. I rented us an apartment, but she wanted out of the lease by the third month. She went through three wedding dresses before I even proposed.</p><p>\u201cI thought she would settle down, be happy, once we were married. We were living in Nashville. I was workin\u2019 as a project manager for this big construction firm. Lots of hours, lots of travelin\u2019. I hardly ever saw Lindy. She\u2019s the one who pushed for us to move. This house, in this town, was supposed to save our marriage. A quieter life, less stress, more time together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd it didn\u2019t work?\u201d</p> <p>He grimaced, that cute little constellation of freckles disappearing into the creases under his eyes. \u201cIt turned out that not spending time together was what held our marriage together for so long in the first place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOuch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI fit right into the Hollow. There are nice people here. It was a good place if we wanted to raise a family. My business picked up faster than I expected. Lindy just sort of drifted, which was unusual for her. She couldn\u2019t find friends. It was too quiet for her. She didn\u2019t like livin\u2019 in a work in progress. When she saw how happy I was, I think it pissed her off. I think she decided that I was the latest thing she just didn\u2019t want anymore.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t perfect,\u201d he admitted when I made a derisive snorting noise. \u201cThe more Lindy tried to tell me what I should and shouldn\u2019t do, the more I dug in and did what I thought I needed. I thought that once the place was finished, it would get better. Livin\u2019 our life in this house, livin\u2019 up to its potential, was supposed to fix things. But then I took that job for Hans and got turned. I know it was scary for her, not knowing if I was dead or not, not knowing what it would be like, married to me. But hell, it was scary for me, too. I woke up, and she was gone. Our life together was gone. And when I tried to talk to her about it, well, she freaked out. Called me a monster, told me to stay away from her. And I... may have gotten Hulk-angry and thrown a couch through a window.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot my finest moment,\u201d he admitted, running his fingers through his unruly hair. His mouth formed a slanted, rueful grin. \u201cLindy, of course, insisted I was too dangerous to be around normal people. Called her family, our friends, my friends here in town, to \u2018warn\u2019 them about my new nature and how fast I could turn on humans. Damn near ruined the life I\u2019d built here, but she was scared and confused, and I guess I can\u2019t blame her.\u201d</p><p>I muttered, \u201cI can.\u201d He frowned at me, making me shrug. \u201cI\u2019m a grudge holder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s puttin\u2019 the house on the market on October 28,\u201d he said, his voice toneless and resigned. \u201cAll the property went to her when I died. But thanks to the Council\u2019s intervention, I got to stay here, and she had to return the holdings for my construction business\u2014the business account, the tools, equipment, and such\u2014and I have until October 28 to buy her out of the house. I\u2019ve been working a little, doing nighttime projects for one of our neighbors, Mr. Calix. He\u2019s added a fence, an outbuilding, and a finished basement to his house in the last few months. I think he\u2019s just doin\u2019 it because he\u2019s tryin\u2019 to help me out, but he\u2019s too nice to say anythin\u2019 about it. It hasn\u2019t been enough to save what I need.\u201d</p> <p>I muttered, \u201cThat explains why the drills didn\u2019t start until the wee hours some nights.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had to squeeze annoyin\u2019 you in where I could,\u201d he admitted, grinning sheepishly. \u201cI am sorry you got pulled into this mess. Lindy was using you, leasin\u2019 the house to you while I was still here. She was countin\u2019 on something called the Vampire Squatters\u2019 Act. Right after the Comin\u2019 Out, human mortgage companies and landlords got tired of newly turned vampires just walking away from their homes, figurin\u2019 that mortgages and leases didn\u2019t apply to them anymore. So the government declared that any vampire who left their property for more than thirty-two days had abandoned it.</p><p>\u201cShe must have a buyer lined up already. If I raise the money before the deadline, she has to sell me the house. That\u2019s why she rented it. She thought if some tenant annoyed me enough, I would move out for the length of the lease, and the house would be considered abandoned to her. She\u2019d be free to sell it without giving me a dime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I was her backup plan? I think that hurts my feelings,\u201d I mumbled, my face flushing hot with shame. No wonder Sam had put up such a fight against leaving, despite my campaign against him. I hated the idea that I\u2019d been helping Lindy, albeit unwittingly, try to drive Sam away from this place. The manipulative little wench would pay for that.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really sorry about the crickets,\u201d I said, my voice soft. \u201cAnd the ghost chili. And gluing your car keys to the counter. Well, I\u2019m pretty sure you deserved the chili thing, but\u2014this is not how a normal person behaves. I\u2019m sorry. I can\u2019t leave, but I don\u2019t want to be this crazy wok-swinging whackaloon anymore. If we could just find a way to share the house for just a little while longer, I swear I won\u2019t attack you again. I\u2019m supposed to be resting, not plotting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to do this anymore, either. I\u2019m afraid we\u2019re going to escalate to the point where one of us is left with a permanent limp,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd to my everlastin\u2019 shame, between the two of us, your pranks seem to be more effective, so I\u2019m all for a ceasefire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not even that I don\u2019t like you,\u201d I said, wiping at my dripping nose with my sleeve just as Sam tried to hand me a red bandanna from his back pocket. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing specific about you not to like. Other than your mere presence.</p><p>\u201cI will stay out of the basement,\u201d I swore. \u201cIf you agree to stay away from my cookware.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreed,\u201d he said, patting my shoulder again. \u201cWe\u2019re goin\u2019 to be OK. When I\u2019m not actively tryin\u2019 to get rid of someone, I\u2019m actually a very easygoin\u2019 roommate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, sure, you\u2019re a charmer.\u201d I lifted my head and looked directly at him for the first time since the conversation started. It amazed me that I could move it so easily. My neck felt as if it had had a bowling ball lifted off it.</p><p>\u201cIf we\u2019re going to make an honest go of this, we\u2019re going to have to abide by some rules.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore rules? I\u2019ve already agreed not to attack you with kitchen implements!\u201d I exclaimed, feigning indignation.</p><p>He gave me a withering, and somehow incredibly sexy, glare.</p><p>\u201cSuch as?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cI stay out of your room,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd you stay out of mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I wanted to visit your lair.\u201d I snorted.</p><p>\u201cI think a part of you is a little curious about it,\u201d he said, grinning cheekily.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a little curious about tattoos,\u201d I shot back. \u201cDoesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m going to get a tramp stamp.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019d look hot with a tramp stamp,\u201d he said, tilting his head and giving me a long, speculative look that made a shiver ripple up my spine. \u201cA cute little kitten... wavin\u2019 a very sharp knife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFunny,\u201d I retorted. \u201cAnd on that note, I promise that I won\u2019t threaten you with my knives anymore. No more hitting you with pans. No more tainting your blood with evil pepper juice. If you\u2019re civil to me, I\u2019m civil to you. It\u2019s what I should have said in the first place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreed. And I will stop callin\u2019 you a psycho.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou called me a psycho?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cNot to your face.\u201d He took a long pull from the bottle of synthetic blood, the faintest lines of a grimace crinkling the corners of his mouth.</p><p>\u201cNot as good as the real thing?\u201d I asked.</p><p>His brows drew up in surprise. \u201cYou offering?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said, shaking my head emphatically. \u201cNo, no, no. I\u2019m just curious about what that tastes like to you. What would make it taste better, that sort of thing. I\u2019m trying to enter this cooking contest for vampires\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Bloody Bake-Off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and I can\u2019t quite get a grasp on what I\u2019m supposed to be doing. It\u2019s more than that\u2014I\u2019m, aw hell, I\u2019m just sucking beyond the telling of it.\u201d I unwrapped the remnants of the red-wine reduction sauce and held it up for him to sniff. \u201cI\u2019ve done everything I can to cover up the taste of the synthetic blood, but all of my efforts made my vampire friends sick. And if I don\u2019t figure out what I\u2019m doing wrong, my life here in the Hollow is going to be... well, less than I\u2019d hoped.\u201d</p><p>He brought the sauce up to his face and winced. \u201cYou\u2019re probably lookin\u2019 at it from your own perspective, what tastes good to you. You make something that sounds good for a human palate and then add some blood. You need to think about what tastes good to a vampire, start with the blood, and work from there.\u201d He held up the half-empty bottle of synthetic blood. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t taste like anything. For vampires, it\u2019s not so much bein\u2019 hungry as bein\u2019 really, really thirsty. You can\u2019t think of anything else until you feed. Human blood, donated or live-fed, answers that thirst and lets you think clearly again. This? This is like drinkin\u2019 water when you could be havin\u2019 an ice-cold lemonade.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHmmph.\u201d</p><p>He snickered at my distaste. \u201cI take it that you\u2019ve never thought about being turned into a vampire?\u201d</p><p>I pulled a frown. \u201cWell, everything I cooked would taste spoiled and rotten to me. Not exactly a great career move.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGood point.\u201d He sighed, pushed to his feet, and wiped his hands on his jeans, as if his palms had been sweating. \u201cOK, get up, wash your face, and show me some of these samples that made your friends upchuck.\u201d</p><p>I sniffed, more than a little startled by his friendly tone and the way he stretched his long fingers toward mine. I was sure I\u2019d misheard him. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, I\u2019ve tried coming up with a contest entry of my own, but I can\u2019t boil water without startin\u2019 a fire. And you can\u2019t seem to grasp the whole vampire-taste-bud thing. But if we combine our efforts, we might have a chance at winnin\u2019 this thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019ve been finding the burned pans? You were cooking on your own?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSadly, yes.\u201d</p> <p>I cackled, making him pout a little. \u201cWhat temperature setting were you using on the stove?\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cThere are different settings?\u201d</p><p>I rubbed my temples. \u201cI weep for you, I really do. But I have plans for that prize money, as much as I want to help you stick it to Lindy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, you just bought Howlin\u2019 Hank\u2019s, and you need the money to fix it up,\u201d he said. When my jaw dropped, he added, \u201cIt\u2019s a small town. Word gets around, even to the hermits.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo if you know I need the money, why are you asking me to do this?\u201d</p><p>He dropped to bended knee in an exaggerated show of chivalry. He took my hand in his cool, slim fingers and pressed both over his still heart. His dark eyes twinkled as he looked up at me. \u201cBecause I have a proposal for you. I\u2019ll help you perfect the recipe for your entry. If you win, you give me the prize money so I can buy the house from Lindy. In exchange, I will do all of the renovations on your restaurant, for the cost of materials.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re screwing with me,\u201d I scoffed. \u201cIf I helped you, and I\u2019m not saying I will, you would run off with the money, leaving me with squat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t,\u201d he swore. \u201cI may be a lot of things, but I\u2019m a man of my word. And if it makes you feel any better, I\u2019d sign a contract with you, guaranteeing my services. We could file it with the Council office.\u201d</p><p>I pinched my lips into a prim expression to prevent the crazy grin that threatened to split my face. \u201cI have other vampire friends who are willing to be my guinea pigs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone of them can hang drywall like I can.\u201d</p><p>Why did that sound slightly dirty when he said it? I eyed him suspiciously. As much as I wanted to rain some sort of biblical vengeance upon Sam\u2019s snotty blond ex, I didn\u2019t really want to be pulled into their marital drama. I did not need to take on other people\u2019s stress when I was just learning to manage my own, and I found angry-married-people baggage to be particularly distasteful. But Sam had been honest with me, more honest than my last three boyfriends. And frankly, he did do some very nice work around the house. I would love to see what he could do for the restaurant.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Tess, what do you say?\u201d he said, the sound of my name on his lips making my stomach do strange, flippy things.</p><p>I shuddered but managed to maintain what little composure I had left as I said, \u201cI don\u2019t even know if I want to use you as a contractor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, come on, you can play dirty all you want, but don\u2019t play dumb,\u201d he countered, sounding miffed at the slight against his abilities.</p> <p>Snickering, I reached out my other hand for an official shake, then retracted it, narrowing my eyes at him. \u201cThis isn\u2019t another prank?\u201d</p><p>He dropped my hand and held up his own in a mockery of the Boy Scout oath. \u201cI promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to need some time to think about it.\u201d</p><p>He rose to his feet, standing a little closer to me than I was comfortable with. I backed up, only to bump against the counter. \u201cI understand. And while you\u2019re thinking, I just want you to consider one thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>He grinned at me with those sharp white teeth, making my knees wobble a bit. I held on to the counter for support as he leaned closer and whispered, \u201cHow much it\u2019s going to piss Lindy off when she realizes her \u2018renter\u2019 is helping to snatch the house out from under her.\u201d</p><p>Blending Oil and Water</p><p>8</p><p>Hey, Sam!\u201d I called. \u201cWould you come taste this?\u201d</p><p>I hovered over the rust-colored mixture bubbling merrily in my saucepan, waiting for just the right moment of consistency to remove it from the heat. I whisked the pan from the stove and stirred it carefully before noting the time and cooking temperature in my little recipe notebook.</p><p>On the other side of the house, I heard the whining peal of an electric drill. But this time, instead of attempting to drive me insane, Sam was putting up a heavy-duty curtain rod for sunproof shades.</p><p>In the last week or so, we\u2019d developed a routine at the Lassiter house. I would visit Jolene, nap, or experiment with new recipes during the day. Then I\u2019d make dinner and warm up some blood just in time for Sam to rise. We\u2019d eat together, hold completely ridiculous conversations about \u201980s music, our favorite tacky monster movies, and whether reality television would be the social factor that finally triggered the apocalypse.</p><p>Sam would work through the samples I\u2019d prepared that day, and\u2014depending on whether or not I\u2019d made him violently ill\u2014we\u2019d spend the rest of the night making small changes in the recipes.</p><p>While we talked about movies, music, food, sports, and any number of pop-culture phenomena, we rarely ventured into territory as personal as his revelations about his marriage to Lindy. It seemed to have made him uncomfortable, being that open, and he\u2019d retreated to safer topics. That was fine, as long as we kept talking. Now that we were on the same team, I was seeing a whole new side to Sam\u2014funny, laid-back, sensible, easy with a smile, and quick to admit when his cooking advice went horribly awry. I didn\u2019t feel I had to play down my accomplishments, as I had to with so many men I\u2019d dated before. I didn\u2019t have to pretend to be a delicate little flower who rarely ate more than a salad with dressing on the side. Because Sam knew I was neither delicate nor flowerlike. And he\u2019d seen me eat an entire quart of Three Little Pigs hash-brown casserole in one sitting. I could be myself with Sam, the unglossed, cooking-in-a-wife-beater-and-yoga-pants, \u201creal\u201d version of me that Phillip hadn\u2019t met until we\u2019d been dating for six months. We\u2019d barely lasted seven.</p><p>I would miss our evenings together when I moved into the apartment over my as-yet-unnamed eatery. Maybe we\u2019d arrange some sort of vampire-food-for-maintenance-work barter system after I opened, just so we could keep in touch.</p><p>I spent several afternoons helping Chef Gamling with the church dinners. On the rare evening I didn\u2019t spend with Chef or Sam, I was with Jolene and her friends. Jolene was very quickly becoming my first meaningful friendship outside of the kitchen. She was funny, warm, smart in a no-nonsense, \u201cdon\u2019t try to screw with me just because I\u2019m gorgeous\u201d way that sort of made me want to have her babies. Not that I would, because (a) science wasn\u2019t quite there yet, and (b) she seemed pretty attached to Zeb, for whom I also had very fond feelings.</p><p>I\u2019d found a circle of friends here. And I was really enjoying my time with them. Jolene had talked her uncles into letting me shadow them in their kitchen at the Three Little Pigs. Jane had invited me to one of her infamous girls\u2019 movie nights, which guaranteed that I would never look at Jane Austen adaptations ever again.</p><p>Sam\u2019s voice behind me drew me out of my musings. \u201cYou hollered?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you like Italian food when you were human? Because this has chicken stock and Marsala wine. The cooking process should have left a result that won\u2019t make you sick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould?\u201d he said, eyeing the shot glass suspiciously.</p><p>Without responding to his concerns, I added, \u201cJust try it.\u201d I pushed the shot glass toward his lips.</p><p>\u201cBut you said you weren\u2019t sure about it,\u201d he protested.</p><p>I took the shot glass out of his hand and pressed it to his lips.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not bad,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cNo nausea?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I have another?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry this one,\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s like barbecue sauce. Honey, liquid smoke, pork stock, and other by-products you may not want to know about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s pig\u2019s blood in here?\u201d he said, wrinkling his nose.</p><p>\u201cHow is it different from drinking human blood?\u201d I asked. \u201cBesides, if you ate bacon in life, it\u2019s a little hypocritical to turn your nose up at pig\u2019s blood now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d he said, sighing, after knocking back the shot. \u201cNow I just really miss ribs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy blender cannot handle rib bones,\u201d I told him.</p><p>\u201cThis,\u201d he informed me, lifting the barbecue sauce, \u201cis awesome. If you could bottle this, you would kick the crap out of Paul Newman and his salad dressings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPaul Newman\u2019s dead,\u201d I reminded him, narrowing my eyes. \u201cUnless there\u2019s something you and the vampire community have to explain to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not nice,\u201d he said. \u201cYou could be the first celebrity chef for vampires, like Rachael Ray or, if Mr. Gamling keeps giving you those dumplin\u2019s, that Paula Deen chick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you for reminding me why being nice to you is never a good idea, you ass.\u201d</p><p>He leaned in close, his brown eyes twinkling. \u201cOh, come on, Tess, I\u2019m sorry. You can be as nice to me and my ass as you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not touching that one.\u201d</p><p>He smirked. \u201cYou know you want to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to go back to cricket warfare again? Because I\u2019m feeling a trip to the bait shop coming on.\u201d</p><p>He shuddered, giving me the vampire puppy-dog eyes, which was just disturbing. \u201cPlease, ma\u2019am, don\u2019t unleash your biblical plagues of bitchery upon my household.\u201d</p><p>I laughed, shoving at his shoulder. He was so close, and my arm was pulled flush against his chest. I closed my eyes, enjoying the vibrations from his laughter traveling from his chest through my fingertips, all the way up my arm to my heart. It was like feeling the pulse he no longer had. I felt my lips part in a smile so wide my cheeks ached. This wouldn\u2019t do. I couldn\u2019t let him see that smile and know what a big part he played in it. I dipped my head, glancing down at the feet so closely arranged we could have been dancing. My forehead brushed against his shoulder. He tucked his fingertips under my chin and tilted my head toward his. His eyes were hooded and dark and stared right through me. His lips looked so soft, even turned into that slightly mocking grin he was giving me. I could stand up on my tippy-toes, or maybe on a chair, and kiss him so easily.</p><p>But I didn\u2019t.</p><p>Smiling awkwardly, I stepped away and took a deep breath. He wasn\u2019t ready. And no matter how loudly my raging hormones screamed, You moron, do you realize how long it\u2019s been since anyone has gone near your forbidden zones? I couldn\u2019t be the one to decide that he was over his ex-wife.</p><p>He was going to have to make the first move. And considering the fact that I was standing immediately lip-adjacent and he didn\u2019t give me a 20 percent lean-in, I didn\u2019t think he was going to be doing that anytime soon.</p><p>\u201cSo, the barbecue sauce, huh?\u201d</p><p>He nodded, taking a step back. \u201cThat\u2019s your winner.\u201d</p><p>\u2014</p><p>The nights went by faster than I imagined they could. We focused our efforts on perfecting the barbecue sauce. We experimented with cooking times, temperatures, spices, sauce bases, until Sam pronounced it almost as good as eating real food when he was human. Sam and I visited the restaurant and discussed the changes he would make, including improvements to the apartment upstairs. My calendar filled up with closings with the Realtor, appointments with the bank, and drinks with the girls. Before I knew it, we were bumping down the country road toward town in Sam\u2019s truck, with our contest entry carefully balanced on my lap. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t be nervous,\u201d Sam told me.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t help it,\u201d I said, leaning my head back against the seat rest. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason I hide in a kitchen all day. I\u2019m not good with crowds.\u201d</p><p>He nudged me with his elbow. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be fine.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLiar.\u201d I sighed.</p><p>Sam\u2019s truck smelled nice, like Murphy\u2019s Oil Soap and pi\u00f1a colada air freshener. This was a very different vampire from the one I\u2019d been pranking. He was relaxed, if not quite happy, as he hummed along to George Strait. He actually smiled at me when he emerged from the basement earlier and complimented me on the little red sweater I\u2019d paired with jeans. It felt natural driving along with him like this, almost like a date, if one\u2019s first date involved hauling several servings of synthetic blood around in a warmer.</p><p>Sam pulled the truck to a stop in front of an old bank building, near Howlin\u2019 Hank\u2019s. While I stared, bewildered by the sheer number of cars parked in front of the darkened buildings, he pulled me out of the truck and helped me with our parcels.</p><p>While parents hauled sunburned, exhausted children to their cars, the \u201cnight shift\u201d for Burley Days was arriving in droves. The town square was bustling with laughing humans and vampires toting an odd assortment of cheap stuffed animals. Red, white, and blue twinkle lights hung from every stationary object, giving the square a festive glow. Gleeful screams echoed over the insistent country and western music pumped over the PA system.</p><p>We carried our sauce samples in a foam chest lined with warming gel packs. As we walked, I noticed several people watching Sam, flashes of recognition flitting across their faces before they averted their eyes. They were human, I could tell by their tans, and they refused to make eye contact. They didn\u2019t exactly turn their backs, but they definitely weren\u2019t giving him manly fist bumps. Were these people Sam\u2019s friends and clients before he was turned? What had Lindy said to them that would make them retreat this way? My irritation with Sam\u2019s ex ratcheted up to \u201cbitch-slap on sight\u201d levels.</p> <p>When Sam took my hand to lead me through the crowd gathered in front of the dunking booth, I gave his a little squeeze. He dropped it as if I\u2019d burned him, but I tried not to take it personally. Earlier head patting aside, it must have been strange to have me touching him after I\u2019d done everything in my power to injure him.</p><p>We spotted the garish black and red Faux Type O booth near the center of the square. Two tall black columns flanked a long red-swathed table. A black banner proclaimed Half-Moon Hollow\u2019s historic participation in the first-ever Bloody Bake-Off. A handful of people, human and vampire alike, were lined up at the registration point, holding various containers. One woman, with heavy circles under her eyes and a cigarette dangling from her lips, seemed to be holding a pitcher of bloodred margaritas. She actually had me worried. But we registered our entry, which we were calling \u201cBlood Creek Barbecue Sauce,\u201d with little incident. A registration number kept our entry anonymous and prevented bias from the judges. That made me feel a bit guilty, considering that Jane had helped me taste-test. But she\u2019d never tasted the final sauce. Heck, the fact that she\u2019d tasted my lesser efforts would probably keep her from guessing which one was mine.</p><p>We were given a goodie bag courtesy of the local Council office, just for participating. The contents included a sample of Solar Shield SPF 500 Sunblock, iron supplements, a six-pack of Faux Type O, and a to-go-sized container of Razor Wire Fang Floss.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just going to let you hold on to that,\u201d I said, handing the tote to Sam.</p><p>\u201cProbably for the best,\u201d he said, peering into the bag. \u201cThey make mouthwash just for vampires?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have so much to learn about your own culture,\u201d I said.</p> <p>\u201cA bag full of blood and dental supplies is culture?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s some culture. Speaking of which, what do we do now?\u201d I asked. \u201cWe\u2019ve got an hour before the results are announced.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow we explore the magic and mystery of Burley Days.\u201d</p><p>Sam led me through the rows of food vendors and rigged games and a particularly bewildering antiques mall. We stopped in front of a table where a dozen grown men were participating in a Frito-Pie-eating contest. I watched in horror as they dove face-first into a combination of corn chips, chili, and cheese, lapping it up like ravenous dogs.</p><p>He chuckled, dragging me away from the carnage. \u201cThis must be hell for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but it will be when the first \u2018loser\u2019 sicks up his efforts,\u201d I said, shuddering. \u201cHaven\u2019t you people ever heard of fruit pies?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, laughing harder. \u201cI meant there are no fancy food emporiums, no Apple Stores, only one Starbucks within a fifty-mile radius. Growin\u2019 up around that sort of thing, you probably take it for granted until you end up in a place like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t grow up around it.\u201d I scoffed. \u201cI grew up in Hader\u2019s Knob, Missouri. Population five thousand thirty-four.\u201d</p> <p>He frowned as he seemed to mentally review all of the conversations we\u2019d had over the last few nights. \u201cI just assumed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never asked,\u201d I said, smirking. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t the greatest place to call home. The liquor stores and the pawn shops were the only businesses that did well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you ever go home to visit?\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cNo reason to. My parents were killed in a car accident when I was in college. Chef Gamling was the one who drove me home from school to help me arrange my parents\u2019 funeral. He was the one who helped me figure out how to handle their mess of an estate. And he\u2019s right here in the Hollow, so where else would I go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re a small-town girl,\u201d he said, eyeing me speculatively. \u201cBein\u2019 a small-town boy myself\u2014Mount Pleasant, Tennessee, thank you very much\u2014I can appreciate that. How\u2019d you end up in Chicago?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCulinary school,\u201d I said. \u201cMy dad thought it was nuts, but Mom said I should follow my dream, even when that dream led me about four hundred miles away from them... which was half of its charm.\u201d</p><p>He made a waving motion with his hand, as if to say, And? When I didn\u2019t respond, he nudged my ribs with his elbow. \u201cWoman, I\u2019ve seen you weepin\u2019 over maimed kitchen gadgets. You know about my torpedoed marriage. And I\u2019ve made out with you under the influence of evil peppers. We have no secrets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy parents didn\u2019t fight, exactly. They bickered a lot, but I can\u2019t remember them ever really raising their voices. They were locked in this bizarre constant battle for who was winning at the relationship. One of them was always leaving the other one, demanding apologies, demanding that I take sides one way or the other. They separated, they got back together, they separated, they got back together, over and over.\u201d The words seemed to rush out of my mouth like water. And when they\u2019d finished, I was a bit out of breath but felt lighter. I frowned, mulling over what it meant that I could say those things to Sam in the middle of a crowded street but not to my mentor or licensed psychiatric professionals.</p><p>\u201cThat must have been... confusin\u2019?\u201d he suggested, with a wary expression on his handsome face, as if he wasn\u2019t sure if I was joking, but he knew he wasn\u2019t supposed to laugh.</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cThey always said they were staying together for my sake. Because clearly, it would traumatize me if my parents got a divorce, but telling me every other month that \u2018this time it\u2019s over for good\u2019 was OK. Frankly, I would have been relieved if they\u2019d just made a clean break of it. Lived separate lives. Maybe they would have been happy apart. Maybe it was selfish of me to want to get away from that. And believe me, the fact that they died with so much between us unsettled\u2014there isn\u2019t a day that goes by that I don\u2019t regret that. But I had to have my own life. I just couldn\u2019t spend another minute mixed up in their drama. Either you love somebody enough to spend the rest of your life with them, or you don\u2019t. In my mind, there\u2019s not much room in between.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said, closing his hand around my shoulder and pulling me into a sort of side hug.</p><p>I nodded, once again marveling at the loose, relaxed feeling in my chest. \u201cAnd now the only real family I have is a cranky old German professor and his life partner, both of them trying to fatten me up with dumplings and monkey bread.\u201d</p><p>After a long, contemplative pause, he nodded and sagely observed, \u201cI thought I noticed a little more junk in your trunk.\u201d</p><p>I took a swat at his shoulder. \u201cJerk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOuch!\u201d He dodged and cackled at me, drawing the eyes of several curious bystanders. \u201cIt\u2019s not right that someone so small can hit so hard. I\u2019m going to miss your gentle, delicate mannerisms after you move out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, come on.\u201d I snickered. \u201cYou know you\u2019ll miss me.\u201d</p><p>His smile faltered. His lips parted as if to say something, but before he could, I heard Jolene cry, \u201cTess!\u201d from across the square. I turned to see her dragging a bemused Zeb in her wake. Jolene threw her arms around me in an enthusiastic, if slightly painful, hug. \u201cAre you excited about the contest?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNearly wetting myself,\u201d I assured her, patting her back. \u201cSam, I think you know Zeb and Jolene Lavelle. Zeb and Jolene, my, uh, roommate, Sam Clemson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice to see you again, Sam,\u201d Zeb said, holding out his hand.</p><p>Sam smiled, almost shyly, and shook it. \u201cGood to see you two. How are the kids?\u201d</p><p>As Zeb whipped out a cell phone full of photos, Jolene launched into a story about little Joe the pickle flinger and his attempts to chew his way out of his crib. Sam listened with interested amusement, oohing and aahing appropriately at the cuteness of my friends\u2019 offspring. This kept us all sufficiently distracted until we heard, \u201cLadies and gents, if you\u2019ll proceed to the center stage, we\u2019ll announce the results for the Hollow\u2019s First-Ever Bloody Bake-Off,\u201d from a human man in his forties shouting into the microphone near the Faux Type O booth. A teenage girl dressed in a red gingham picnic dress\u2014whom Jolene identified as the scary teen-vampire bureaucrat Ophelia\u2014shrank away from him, as if his loud \u201cyee-haw\u201d was going to make her ears bleed.</p><p>As the crowd milled over to the main (and only) stage, Ophelia snatched the mic out of his hands and eyed the poor, unsuspecting man in a way I\u2019d only seen diabetics case the dessert cart. She sighed and turned to the vampires wearing \u201cofficial judge\u201d sashes. All of them, including my hapless friend, Jane, had their arms crossed over their middles and looked slightly ill.</p><p>\u201cWe were very pleased to receive such a wide array of entries, everything from a Chum Cherry Slushie to a Bloody Pot Pie,\u201d Ophelia said, smirking at Jane, who sent her a hard look in return.</p><p>Even in this crowd, I could hear Sherry Jameson saying, \u201cWell, she used to love them when she was human!\u201d</p><p>Poor Jane.</p><p>I found it a little disturbing that Ophelia hadn\u2019t mentioned the barbecue sauce. Did that mean something? Did that mean that my entry hadn\u2019t been memorable enough to mention? I\u2019d felt pretty comfortable with my submission when I got here, but now, seeing those nauseated expressions on the judges\u2019 faces\u2014Oh, my God, what if I lost a cook-off in small-town Kentucky to a bunch of homemakers? What if I failed, leaving Sam without a house and myself without a construction budget? The sudden rush of cold, hard fear up my spine had me bending slightly, bracing my hands against my knees.</p><p>I felt cool, insistent pressure at the base of my neck. It rubbed in soft circles over my nape, and I realized it was Sam\u2019s hand. I peered up at him through the haze of hair that hung over my face.</p><p>\u201cIt will be OK,\u201d he promised. \u201cNow, suck it up, people are starting to stare.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGot it,\u201d I said, clearing my throat and straightening to my full (though not impressive) height. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>I rolled my shoulders and took a deep breath. I noticed that Sam\u2019s hand remained on the back of my neck, his thumb occasionally sweeping over my vertebrae. I shivered a bit, but Sam kept his hand there.</p><p>\u201cNow, before I announce the award winners, which will be included in the first-ever Faux Type O cookbook, Blue Ribbons with Bite, I\u2019d like to announce the honorable mentions. First, we have Rita Scott with her Chum Cherry Slushie, a delightfully pulverized mix of blood blended with cherry syrup and ice.\u201d</p> <p>A plump, pretty blond woman in a bright pink church dress squealed joyfully and went to the stage to accept her yellow ribbon and certificate. Jane turned slightly green around the gills. I gave her a sympathetic look but then started to giggle. She made a very rude gesture behind the thin shield of her left hand. When Ophelia announced the second honorable mention as Ginger Lavelle with her Bloody Mary Margarita, the haggard chain-smoker I\u2019d seen earlier launched herself at Ophelia and snatched her victory ribbon, waving it like a war banner. Ophelia stepped out of range, an unimpressed grimace twisting her young features.</p><p>\u201cLavelle?\u201d I looked to Jolene. \u201cAny relation?\u201d</p><p>Jolene huffed out an irritated sigh. \u201cThat would be my mother-in-law.\u201d</p><p>We watched as Ginger Lavelle did a victory shimmy that looked like something from a burlesque performance. \u201cWow,\u201d I marveled.</p><p>\u201cWell, she stuck with her area of expertise,\u201d Jolene grumbled. \u201cBooze.\u201d</p> <p>I expected Zeb to take offense at this, but he just nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s possible she would have stumbled upon this recipe without the contest.\u201d</p><p>Ophelia moved on to the prize winners. Third place and a thousand-dollar check went to a blood-and-beef-broth concoction created by Martha Hackett, a sweet-looking elderly lady I\u2019d assumed was human until she grinned and flashed her fangs at the crowd. The fact that another name was called filled me with equal parts dread and hope. If I hadn\u2019t placed third, it was likely that I\u2019d placed second or first. Then again, I might not have placed at all. I imagined the humiliation of explaining to Chef Gamling that I hadn\u2019t... and there I was, bent over hyperventilating again.</p><p>\u201cWould you stop that?\u201d Sam exclaimed, pulling me upright and pressing me against his side.</p><p>Second place went to Lulu McClaine\u2019s Thinned Blood Pudding, a \u201ccharming drinkable dessert that tickled each judge\u2019s palate.\u201d Jolene whooped and cheered for her aunt before giving me an apologetic look. \u201cSorry, family loyalties.\u201d</p><p>I groaned. I knew I should have made blood pudding!</p><p>\u201cThis is what we want,\u201d Sam reminded me. \u201cWe\u2019ve still got a shot. And if you throw up on me, I will get seriously pissed at you.\u201d</p> <p>I kept my face buried in my hands as Ophelia built up to the announcement of first place, describing the fabulous photo spread each prize winner would receive in the cookbook, the cash prize, and, of course, \u201cthe knowledge that the winner had helped new vampires adjust to their new diet.\u201d Finally, Ophelia felt that she\u2019d tortured us enough and exclaimed, \u201cEvery judge was pleased with the first-prize winner. For our recently turned panelists, it was everything good about summer cookouts, without the regrets of solid food on the vampire digestive system. Ladies and gentlemen, the winner of the Faux Type O Bloody Bake-Off and the twenty-five-thousand-dollar grand prize\u2014Blood Creek Barbecue Sauce by Tess Maitland and Sam Clemson!\u201d</p><p>If there was applause, I couldn\u2019t hear it. I was frozen, unable to move or see anything beyond Sam\u2019s face and its elated expression. His bright, unearthly smile lit up the town square. We\u2019d done it. We had the money to buy the house out from under Lindy. I could stay in the Hollow and live in the place I loved. For the first time, everything I really wanted was in my grasp.</p><p>Jolene hugged me, and I shrieked, hopping up and down like a maniac. Sam laughed, watching with amusement as I seemed to lose my mind. I threw my arms around him and squeezed until he made a wheezing uhf sound. I beamed up at him.</p><p>Well, maybe not everything I wanted. But it was a good start.</p><p>\u201cYou put my name on the entry slip?\u201d Sam asked as we made our way to the stage. \u201cI didn\u2019t see you do that.\u201d</p><p>As an overenthusiastic well-wisher slapped me on the back, nearly bowling me over, Sam caught my elbow and shot the guy a dark look. I laughed, waving off the back-slapper\u2019s apologies. \u201cOf course I did. You were just as much a part of the creative process as I was. Without you, the vampire judges might have ended up in the hospital with food poisoning.\u201d</p><p>He gave my arm an affectionate squeeze. \u201cThanks, Tess. I mean it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI meant it, too,\u201d I countered. Sam leaned in closer to me, his eyes intent on my upturned mouth. I smiled up at him, my hand slipping over the fingers gripping my arm.</p> <p>From the stage, we heard a none-too-subtle throat clearing. Ophelia stood there, holding an oversized novelty check, her eyebrows arched. I blushed, and Sam gave her an apologetic shrug. We crossed the stage and claimed the giant check and the blue ribbon. We shook the judges\u2019 hands. And while Jane was clearly trying to maintain the appearance of objectivity, the excited squeeze she gave my hand nearly brought me to my knees.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know it was yours, I swear,\u201d she whispered. \u201cAfter all, your first efforts were so... uh, raw. I thought you\u2019d made the Valentine\u2019s Day Massacre Marinara Sauce.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s so wrong,\u201d I whispered back.</p><p>Jane shuddered. \u201cYes, it was.\u201d</p><p>Ophelia motioned for me to join her and Sam at the mic. I blinked at the sheer number of people gathered in front of me. Oh, hell. This was why I hid out in the kitchen at work. I was not great in front of crowds. Ophelia gave me another nudge toward the mic, where I spluttered, \u201cUm, th-thanks. Thanks so much for this. I\u2019m thrilled.\u201d</p><p>Ophelia looked less than impressed with my oratory skills, and when I tried to back away from the mic, she looped her arm through mine and kept me in place. \u201cTess is a recent addition to Half-Moon Hollow. One of our judges has informed me that our winner will be opening a restaurant here in town soon. And I\u2019m sure she will have a wide selection of vampire menu items.\u201d</p><p>Ophelia gave me a pointed smile, which I supposed deserved a response. \u201cUh, sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to call your establishment, Tess?\u201d Ophelia asked.</p><p>I floundered, my cheeks hot. I couldn\u2019t believe I still hadn\u2019t come up with a name for the place yet. Stricken, I looked up to Sam, who leaned into the microphone and announced, \u201cMiss Maitland\u2019s new restaurant will be called Southern Comforts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I squeaked. \u201cSouthern Comforts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m sure we\u2019re all looking forward to the opening,\u201d Ophelia said, smirking. The crowd applauded, and I waved halfheartedly. Ophelia leaned closer and whispered, \u201cYou should go now.\u201d</p><p>Still a bit rattled, I nodded, and Sam led me offstage. Ophelia\u2019s assistant gave us paperwork to sign and details about collecting our winnings. We also received a large cast-iron pot full of Faux Type O products to \u201ccontinue our experimentation.\u201d</p><p>After we thanked Jane again, she warned us to beware the unexpected gift basket and the potential trouble it could bring into our lives. Explaining that Jane had \u201cissues\u201d with gift baskets, Jolene and Zeb helped us lug the check and the cast-iron albatross to the truck. Then they insisted on taking us for drinks over at the Fraternal Order of Police beer garden. I noticed that Sam snagged one of the \u201cspecial occasion\u201d bottles of Faux Type O High Life before walking back with us.</p><p>\u201cThanks for naming my restaurant for me,\u201d I told him as we took our seats at a picnic table near an improvised stage, where the night-shift sergeants picked out old country-western standards on acoustic guitars.</p><p>Sam grimaced. \u201cYeah, sorry. You just had this frozen deer expression, and I didn\u2019t know how long it would take you to snap out of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr Ophelia could have snapped on you,\u201d Zeb observed.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s OK, I like it,\u201d I said. \u201cSouthern Comforts has quite the ring to it. And it fits with the theme I\u2019d planned.\u201d Sam sipped his drink, looking pleased, so I added, \u201cOf course, you\u2019re going to have to be my guinea pig.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled, then straightened his expression into a frown. \u201cI never agreed to that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019ll be willing to renegotiate,\u201d I said, arching my eyebrows into a supervillain expression. \u201cOr I will lace every bottle of blood in that gift basket with ghost chili oil.\u201d</p><p>He narrowed his eyes at me. \u201cYou are the most twisted, evil little thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy does that sound all sexy when he says it?\u201d Zeb asked his wife.</p><p>Shaking her head, Jolene raised her cup of beer in a toast. \u201cHere\u2019s to your first Burley Days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo far, it hasn\u2019t sucked,\u201d I added, clinking my cup against hers. I caught Sam\u2019s eye before repeating the gesture against his blood bottle. \u201cTo ceasefires.\u201d</p><p>Sam\u2019s lips quirked into a grin. \u201cTo ceasefires.\u201d</p><p>\u2014</p><p>A few beers later, Sam decided it was time to leave. I kept lingering, discussing plans for the restaurant with Jolene, until Sam and Zeb shared a determined \u201cmanly men together\u201d look and dragged us away from the table.</p><p>\u201cYou know, if you make too much of a show of this, some very ugly rumors about vampire brutality on tourists will start spreading around town,\u201d I told Sam, snickering as he slung me under his arm like a football and carried me down the darkened sidewalk to his truck.</p><p>\u201cYeah, because I have such a great reputation.\u201d He grunted as he hauled me toward the truck. \u201cMy God, woman, how much funnel cake did you eat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice.\u201d I barked out a laugh while he opened the truck door for me. He grinned down at me, giving me a boost as I climbed into the passenger seat. His hands were resting on my hips, and I had the strangest urge to map that little constellation of freckles on his cheekbone with my tongue. His lips parted, and I leaned forward just in time to hear\u2014</p><p>\u201cSammy?\u201d</p><p>Breaking a Few Eggs</p><p>9</p><p>The spell broke as we turned to find Sam\u2019s ex-wife standing on the sidewalk, gaping at us.</p><p>\u201cSammy, what are you doing here?\u201d Lindy demanded, shrugging off the insistent arm of a blond, tan man in jeans and pink polo shirt. The guy was in his midthirties and had intentionally popped his collar.</p><p>An unfiltered expression of pain flashed across Sam\u2019s face, particularly when he saw Mr. Popped Collar\u2019s arm around Lindy\u2019s shoulders.</p><p>\u201cYou know it\u2019s not a good idea for you to be out in public.\u201d Lindy sighed, as if she were scolding a small child. \u201cYou know how you are. What if you hurt someone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d Sam growled, ever so subtly stepping away from me. I looked to Popped Collar, to gauge how he felt about interloping in the Clemsons\u2019 bizarre marital drama. He appeared to be playing Angry Birds on his phone.</p><p>\u201cStill, maybe I should take you home,\u201d Lindy fussed. \u201cYou know how you get around humans. This has to be pushing your control to the limit. Let\u2019s just get you home before you hurt someone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you worry about me!\u201d Sam barked. \u201cYou owe Tess here an apology for dragging her into our mess. How could you rent the house without even talkin\u2019 to me? That\u2019s out-there, even for you, Lindy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSammy, I didn\u2019t want to rent out the house, but I needed the money,\u201d she said, her voice rising to a wheedling, babyish tone that grated on my nerves. \u201cYou know how expensive it is to start up with a new apartment. I just need a little extra to put down the security deposit.\u201d</p><p>I huffed. \u201cOh, come on!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sam turned to me with a weird, glazed expression, as if he\u2019d almost forgotten I was there, despite the fact that he\u2019d just spoken about me. \u201cCould you just give me a minute?\u201d he asked.</p><p>I sighed. \u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>I climbed into the truck and slammed the door. Unfortunately, Sam\u2019s windows were pretty solid, and I couldn\u2019t hear what was being said on the other side of the glass. That was a shame, because Lindy appeared to be wailing like a banshee, and Sam was waving his arms to an invisible orchestra.</p> <p>Sam\u2019s fangs kept popping down, which was a problem for new vampires not quite in control of their emotions. Of course, every time it happened, Lindy flinched dramatically, which only made Sam more upset. Popped Collar remained blissfully uninvolved.</p><p>When Lindy started screaming, her face flushing red while she jabbed her finger toward Sam\u2019s face, I\u2019d had enough. I didn\u2019t want to get pulled into the middle of this, but damn it, she didn\u2019t get to talk to Sam that way. Not after what she\u2019d pulled, not after leaving him without money or friends or the house he loved. I threw the truck door open, hauling the heavy cast-iron pot with me, just in time to hear Sam exclaim, \u201cYou\u2019re going to have to deal with it!\u201d</p><p>The next five seconds were a balletic comedy of errors. Sam slammed the truck door just as I started to climb out, shutting it on my foot. I yowled in protest, and when he realized that he\u2019d hurt me, he turned toward me, which irritated Lindy. She swung her purse at his head. Sam ducked just as I pushed my way out of the truck and stepped right into Lindy\u2019s swing. Her (fortunately, very soft) quilted Vera Bradley handbag landed broadside across my cheek, leaving me with a resounding thud bouncing around my skull.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d I said, and handed the pot to Sam\u2019s ex. She blinked at me, confused, as I drew my hand back as if I was going to slap her. She shrieked, dropping the handles to cover her face with her hands. The heavy iron pot crashed down on Lindy\u2019s foot with a clang. She howled, hopping up and down on her good foot.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s for screwing me over on the lease!\u201d I shouted.</p> <p>Lindy lunged for me, claws out. Sam threw me over his shoulder, turning to plop me back into the truck, only to smack my forehead across the edge of the door. I yelped, he spun around too quickly to see what had happened, and my sneaker whacked Lindy across the mouth. Lindy wailed, but I was too busy nursing my aching temple to laugh.</p><p>\u201cYour vampire reflexes suck.\u201d I groaned as Sam threw me unceremoniously into the passenger seat while Lindy continued to berate us both.</p><p>Sam rounded the truck, jumped into the driver\u2019s seat, and gave me a long, incredulous look. \u201cDid you just drop a pot on my ex-wife\u2019s foot?\u201d</p><p>As he turned the key in the ignition, I shook my head, wincing at the pain in my temple. \u201cTechnically, she dropped the pot on her foot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a scary woman.\u201d</p><p>And through it all, Popped Collar continued to kill those little green pigs.</p> <p>\u2014</p><p>I stood at the back door, sipping jasmine tea and watching the late-afternoon sky shift into an angry, bruised green. The trees danced so violently in the wind that I was afraid the limbs would snap off and come crashing into the house.</p><p>With that in mind, I stepped back from the windows a few paces.</p><p>It had been a very productive couple of days. The beverage company had wired the prize money into Sam\u2019s account, allowing Sam to file papers with the bank. Sam and I had finalized blueprints for the changes to the restaurant. I had started making arrangements to move out of the house.</p><p>Somehow the sky went even darker, casting the house in purpling shadows as roiling clouds gathered overhead. I was wondering whether I should go look for a flashlight when the electricity winked off with a snap of ozone.</p><p>I groaned. Perfect timing.</p><p>There were no flashlights, of course. Lindy had probably run off with them when she left. I lit a \u201cRelaxing Seascape\u201d pillar candle on the mantel.</p><p>\u201cYep, I\u2019m more relaxed already,\u201d I muttered.</p> <p>The house was getting darker and darker as sheets of rain lashed against the windows. Even though we were reaching \u201chouse sucked away by a cyclone\u201d levels of interior shade, Sam wasn\u2019t due to wake up for a few more hours.</p><p>I was trying to figure out what my dinner options would be without power or a manual can opener when I heard a strange thumping noise from the side of the house. I rushed to the window and saw that one side of the in-ground double door to the cellar had come loose and was flapping in the wind like a particularly heavy flag. Had the latch slipped out of place?</p><p>Oh, shoot. The cellar, where Sam was sleeping. Rain was pouring into the open door.</p><p>The second I stepped outside, my brain shouted, Error! Error! Get your ass back inside!</p><p>The rain felt like being slapped around by quick, icy hands, soaking through my T-shirt and stinging my skin. A wind gust knocked me back against the porch railing. I tried to take a step toward the banging noise, but I couldn\u2019t keep my eyes open against the force of the wind and the water.</p><p>I scrambled back through the door, slamming it behind me. I flicked my hair out of my face, slinging water across the room. I looked out the window, and through the blurred, rain-spattered glass, I saw that the other door was now waving back and forth. \u201cWell, that was stupid.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t just leave it like that. I didn\u2019t know where the cellar door opened in relation to Sam\u2019s resting place. The storm could pass through quickly, and if Sam was sleeping anywhere near the door and sunlight suddenly broke through the clouds, he could end up a little pile of dust. Candle in hand, I traipsed through the darkened kitchen. The basement door wasn\u2019t locked, which I thought was a nice sign of trust.</p><p>The candle was warming in my hand, the wax softening and releasing its strange sharp-clean scent, as I carefully made my way down the stairs. While the walls were lined with neatly hung tools and clean, orderly worktables, the floor space was open. At least I wouldn\u2019t trip over anything. The noise of the door flapping was deafening, but I couldn\u2019t see Sam anywhere. There was another door at the other end of the cellar, a solid metal door surrounded by new brick. It reminded me of one of those old-fashioned walk-in bank safes.</p><p>Of course, Sam had built himself an actual lair. I laughed, shoving my hair back from my face and setting the candle aside on a worktable. It took me a few tries to get the doors shut, particularly when I found that the latch had broken off. I had to secure it with a shovel through the door handles. And thanks to additional rain battering, my white T-shirt and khakis were now completely transparent, which was a fun look for me.</p><p>I took the still-burning candle, and I swear, I meant to just walk out, but there was that door at the end of the room. Beckoning. A mental itch I couldn\u2019t ignore. All these nights, I\u2019d been staying in this house, and I\u2019d never seen where Sam slept. It couldn\u2019t hurt to look, right? I mean, he was technically dead at the moment. He\u2019d never find out.</p><p>By the time I\u2019d reached the door, I\u2019d rationalized it seven different ways. The vault door featured a traditional combination dial, set to the combination and therefore unlocked. It made me feel equal parts guilty and happy that he trusted me enough to sleep unguarded.</p><p>The space was small. Sam had bricked in just enough room for a bed and a dresser. Now that I\u2019d opened that door, it felt so intrusive and wrong. But I couldn\u2019t help but look at the slim form sprawled across the bed. It was one of those lovely old-fashioned wrought-iron numbers with curlicues in the headboard and a feather tick mattress. How had Lindy missed this? Had Sam sneaked it down here before she started her ransacking of the house?</p><p>I moved closer, the small flame from the candle casting a dancing orange light across Sam\u2019s pale face. He was handsome when he was awake. He was absolutely beautiful in sleep, all white angles and smooth skin. His long lashes rested against high cheekbones. He was relaxed, not quite innocent, but definitely not the angry, sad guy I\u2019d met weeks ago.</p><p>Also, Sam slept naked.</p><p>Panic bloomed in my chest. This was so wrong. He was lying there, naked and vulnerable, and I was peeping at him. I was going to be listed on some sort of Council sex-offender list. Just then, hot wax dripped down the side of the pillar candle and burned my fingers. I hissed in pain, bobbling the candle and spilling even more wax, dripping it right onto Sam\u2019s chest.</p><p>And that was the moment I remembered the story about Cupid and Psyche. I\u2019d become painfully familiar with Greek mythology while planning a \u201cthemed meal\u201d for one of my culinary-school projects. I\u2019d chosen \u201cA Feast for the Gods.\u201d Spanakopita. Never again.</p><p>Psyche was told never to bother Cupid while he was sleeping, but she couldn\u2019t help her curiosity and sneaked into his room with an oil lamp, dripping oil on his shoulder and burning him. He was furious and left her shortly after, and she had to perform several dignity-defying tasks for the gods before he would come back.</p><p>Shit.</p><p>Sam didn\u2019t seem to be stirring. I stepped back, slowly pulling my arm and the candle out of reach. A hand shot out to clamp around my wrist. Sam\u2019s eyes were open, hungry, and dark. I pulled frantically at my wrist, barely keeping the candle upright as he dragged me down to the mattress.</p><p>\u201cSam, I\u2019m sorry, I just wanted to make sure you\u2019re OK. There\u2019s a storm\u2014mmph!\u201d</p><p>His mouth closed over mine, pulling my bottom lip between his teeth and nibbling it. He pulled the candle from my hand and placed it on a bedside table. He yanked me close, rolling over me and pressing me into the mattress, plucking the buttons of my wet shirt like guitar strings. His hips pressed into mine, pinning me down. He was so solid, so sure, over me, when my head seemed to be running on its own roller-coaster track.</p><p>He pushed the wet shirt from my shoulders, running his hands under my back until they cupped my butt, and rocked his hips. I groaned shamelessly, throwing my head back against the pillow. He rained kisses down the line of my throat. I could feel his wicked smile against my skin when I didn\u2019t so much as tense when his teeth skimmed over my jugular.</p><p>His fingers worked over my collarbone, tickled the rim of my belly button, and traced my hips. Somewhere in the course of this, my pants seemed to have disappeared. I glanced down, transfixed by the sight of Sam\u2019s hard length slipping between my thighs.</p><p>I gasped. I would worry about the pants later.</p><p>\u2014</p><p>The storm died down. I had no idea when, but by the time I collapsed back against the mattress, sore, sweaty, and a little dizzy, the wind had dwindled to a dull roar. We could still hear the rain spattering against the siding. It was nice, sprawling out on the bed, the light low, and what sounded like ocean waves beating against the walls.</p><p>Sam\u2019s arm was thrown over me, his face pressed into the mattress. I didn\u2019t want to brag, but I was pretty sure I\u2019d broken him. Toward the end, I\u2019d taken his power of speech and the ability to control his eyelids. But he\u2019d done his damage, too. The pretty iron curlicues on the headboard now looked like something from a Tim Burton movie.</p><p>His head rose, and his eyelids twitched slightly as he gave me a lazy smile. He grabbed me and pulled me close.</p><p>\u201cI was wonderin\u2019 how long it would take you to come down here,\u201d he murmured against my mouth. \u201cReally, woman, how many hints do I have to give you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cH-hints?\u201d I sputtered</p><p>\u201cI left the doors unlocked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not a hint. That\u2019s inattention to personal safety.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSays the woman who spilled candle wax on a sleepin\u2019 vampire,\u201d he whispered, biting lightly at the place where my neck met my jaw. \u201cKinky girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice.\u201d I rolled my eyes and made myself more comfortable, balancing carefully on his chest. My knee hit the mattress wrong, and the bed sagged in the middle. As pretty as it was, the mattress was lumpy as hell, and the springs squeaked every time we moved. But I was so comfortable. And I loved the feeling of Sam\u2019s hands slipping along my spine, tracing each vertebra with his fingertips. I lay there, my head tilted sweetly against the ridge of his collarbone, completely relaxed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo, what happens now?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI think that\u2019s my line,\u201d I said without looking up.</p><p>\u201cYou know what I mean,\u201d he said, poking my ribs. \u201cWhen you move out, will I see you again, or will I just be part of the Half-Moon Hollow welcome wagon package?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll give you a good review on Yelp, if that will make you feel better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you\u2019re funny, you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI try.\u201d I was so tempted to tell him I was staying right there with him, in this very house, as long as he wanted me. And I would be willing to sleep in this freaky Tim Burton bed if he would keep rubbing my back like that. But for now, that sounded a little psycho. So I gave him a Cheshire Cat smile and said, \u201cI\u2019m not quite sure yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s mean.\u201d He groaned.</p><p>I slid my arms around his neck and rolled over him. \u201cMaybe I should take another spin on the welcome wagon before I decide.\u201d</p> <p>I nipped along the line of his throat, leaving a deliberate mark on his collarbone with my teeth. It faded in seconds. I was going to have to find a way to make those stick.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s so wrong.\u201d he said, sighing.</p><p>\u201cYou want more genteel pillow talk, get a more genteel girl.\u201d</p><p>\u2014</p><p>The next thing I knew, I startled awake in the bed, alone. I could hear footsteps above me, making the floorboards creak. Sam was pacing upstairs in the living room, and I could hear his hushed tones even in the basement. I blinked blearily at the alarm clock on the bedside table. It was after 10:00 P.M. Who would be visiting here at this time of night?</p><p>I slipped into my shirt and jeans and crept quietly up the stairs. The kitchen was dark, but the lights in the living room were blazing. I could hear Sam yelling, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t have to explain that to you!\u201d followed by tinny babbling. Was he talking on the phone? I hovered near the door, watching as Sam paced back and forth over the worn rug.</p> <p>\u201cLindy, that was the amount agreed upon in the settlement. I have a promissory note to show the court. I\u2019ve made the deadline. If you\u2019re not happy with the payment, talk to the judge about it.\u201d</p><p>More squawking on the other end of the line.</p><p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t have the right to ask that,\u201d he spat. \u201cBecause it\u2019s none of your\u2014no!\u201d He sighed. \u201cNo. I\u2019m not sleepin\u2019 with her. Lindy, she\u2019s not even my type...</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a friend!\u201d he yelled in response to something Lindy had asked. \u201cShe\u2019s just a friend. She\u2019s a nice girl you took advantage of. I felt sorry for her after what you did, so we made an effort to get along. Stop gettin\u2019 away from the point. I\u2019m gettin\u2019 the house fair and square. You need to deal with it...</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t want to meet up to talk about it!\u201d he barked. After a long pause, his voice softened as he said, \u201cLook, Lindy, please don\u2019t cry. Please, just stop. No, I don\u2019t hate you. No, I\u2019m not mad anymore... You know I do.\u201d</p><p>I backed away from the door, feeling as if I\u2019d been punched in the stomach. Was that really how he felt? I was just a friend? He felt sorry for me? Was I a \u201cfriend with benefits\u201d now? A rebound lay? I didn\u2019t want to be boxed into some \u201cfriend zone\u201d category of women Sam liked enough to sleep with but not enough to date. And I wanted a relationship with Sam, a real one. I hadn\u2019t realized that until I heard him describe me in such bland terms.</p><p>Why would he say I was \u201cjust a friend\u201d? Because he didn\u2019t want to hurt Lindy? Did he still love her, despite everything? Was he going to end up going back to his ex like Phillip? Would I get sucked into another bizarre cyclical marriage trap like my parents\u2019 relationship hell? Would any progress I made die as Sam yo-yoed back and forth between the two of us?</p><p>My breath came out in a painful little hiccup as I found my shoes and purse. I threaded my fingers through the handle of my bag. I couldn\u2019t be here for this. I couldn\u2019t listen to him talk this way. I couldn\u2019t stay in the house, knowing that he might come down the stairs and find some gentle, \u201cfriendly\u201d way to ask me to go upstairs to my own bed. The rational, reasonable part of my brain seemed to be on vacation\u2014again\u2014while the more primal portions yelled for me to get out. Get out now! Get out before he gives us the \u201cI need space\u201d speech!</p> <p>My keys jangled slightly, and I caught them before Sam overheard. I approached the living room. His back was turned to me as he growled into the phone, \u201cFine, call your lawyer! He wrote the agreement in the first place!\u201d Hands shaking, I slipped from the kitchen to the front hall in a few steps, launching out the door as if I were on a catapult. As I revved my engine and sped down the drive, I glanced back in the rearview mirror and saw Sam framed in the doorway.</p><p>\u2014</p><p>That night, I cried the whole thing out to Jolene, curled up on her couch.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just so embarrassing.\u201d I sighed. \u201cI don\u2019t get caught up this way, all emotional and crazy and snotting all over my friends\u2019 sofas. It\u2019s not the first time I\u2019ve slept with a man who didn\u2019t love me. Hell, Phillip made it clear he didn\u2019t even like me toward the end of our relationship. But it\u2019s never hurt this badly before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe that\u2019s because you didn\u2019t care about any of those guys before,\u201d Jolene said, offering me a tall glass of liquor, the origin of which I chose not to question. \u201cAnd you may be overreacting, you know. You never actually heard him say he still wanted her around. All he said was that he didn\u2019t hate her. It\u2019s not exactly a declaration of love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one likes a smartass, Jolene,\u201d I informed her, wiping at my wet cheeks.</p><p>Zeb, who had disappeared like a cartoon coyote when he\u2019d opened the door and saw my tearstained face, crept quietly into the living room, placed a beer and a plate of chocolate-chip cookies in front of me, and dashed to the safety of the twins\u2019 room.</p><p>\u201cI hope that\u2019s not true, for your sake,\u201d she muttered. \u201cSo, what are you going to do now?\u201d</p><p>I swiped at my cheeks. \u201cGo ahead with my plans. This doesn\u2019t really change anything, except that I need to move out of Sam\u2019s place ahead of schedule. I think we both need to figure out what we want. I don\u2019t think we can do that if I\u2019m living in his back pocket. I\u2019ll just have to find a new contractor. And a bank willing to give me a very low-interest loan\u2014or maybe I\u2019ll just rob a bank, I haven\u2019t decided.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have some cousins who work construction,\u201d Jolene offered.</p><p>\u201cOf course you do.\u201d I snorted into a tissue. \u201cSo, Jolene\u2014my best friend, my right hand, the only person I know who loves food as much as I do\u2014would you like a job?\u201d</p><p>Jolene frowned at me. \u201cI will not track Lindy down and kill her for you. I mean, I know how to hide a body, but I\u2019ve got kids now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I exclaimed. \u201cI mean a job at the restaurant. Would you like to manage it for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I already work part-time for Beeline, and I work some days at my uncle\u2019s shop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly. You know how a restaurant works, and you know the people here much better than I do. If you see me doing something stupid, you\u2019ll tell me, loudly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you actually listen to me?\u201d she asked dryly.</p><p>\u201cAt least half the time,\u201d I promised. \u201cCome on, how would you feel about dropping the part-time jobs and working for me? I can offer you a pitiful salary and all of the free food you can eat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou may want to rethink that!\u201d Zeb called from the back of the house.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think my uncles would like me working for the competition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s just it. I don\u2019t plan on competing with your uncles\u2019 place. They do beautiful sandwiches and deli selections, mostly lunch and breakfast. I\u2019m aiming more for comfort foods, slightly upscale, but not so much that you wouldn\u2019t be comfortable there in jeans. A lunch and dinner crowd.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d still want to check with them first. And my dad.\u201d</p><p>I raised an eyebrow.</p><p>She nodded. \u201cWe\u2019re a close family.\u201d</p><p>I muttered, \u201cMust be a Southern thing.\u201d</p><p>\u2014</p><p>Jolene helped me get the apartment above Southern Comforts into a somewhat livable condition over the next few days, cleaning and making small repairs. After retrieving my stuff from Sam\u2019s house, Jane and Andrea showed up with an enormous care package stocked with housewarming gifts such as a new shower curtain, cleaning supplies, and a great big bottle of vodka. I loved Jane and Andrea. I really did.</p><p>Sam called, but I didn\u2019t pick up the phone. His messages were increasingly apologetic, which just made me feel worse for hurting him. He was sorry I woke up to his conversation with Lindy, he said. He didn\u2019t know what I\u2019d heard, but he wished I would talk to him so we could work this out. One message had him sounding so worried, so lonely, that I nearly hit \u201cend\u201d so I could dial Sam\u2019s number, but then he said, \u201cI thought we were friends.\u201d And that kept me from checking my messages for the next two days.</p><p>By day three, the words \u201cjust a friend\u201d kept running through my head on a loop, making me cringe and cry and occasionally throw a pot at a wall.</p><p>I was really going to have to stop doing that.</p><p>On October 28, the day Sam was supposed to reclaim his house, I sat in my new restaurant with a perfectly nice lager resting on the bar in front of me. Jolene had finally agreed to take the job at Southern Comforts. But her uncles had warned me that if they caught me duplicating from their menu, I would be in for an old-fashioned ass-whupping. But I hadn\u2019t had any luck finding a contractor to do the repairs I needed. I was having trouble narrowing down which human and vampire menus I wanted to use for the restaurant. I couldn\u2019t even decide on a color scheme for the menu.</p><p>For the first time in my life, I truly had no clue what to do. Even when I had my meltdown, I\u2019d had a plan\u2014visit Chef Gamling, get my life back in order. But now, even though I knew what I was doing in the long term, I was completely paralyzed by indecision over what to do in the next few days, in the next few hours.</p><p>I toyed with the cap from a Faux Type O bottle. There were so many things I could do with this place, but I wasn\u2019t sure of any of them now. Did I really want to save the tabletops as wall displays? Could I refinish the bar to its original oaken glory? How much additional storage space could I allow myself in the kitchen? I wanted Sam\u2019s input in these decisions, his sensible contractor\u2019s brain. But it seemed that John Lassiter\u2019s curse had killed my pseudo-relationship before it even got off the ground, taking my construction plans down with it.</p><p>I took a deep breath and a deeper draw from my beer. This stopped now. The time for useless pouting and self-flagellating was done. I was a homeowner, sort of. I owned my own restaurant. I had friends, real friends who liked me, despite my basket-case tendencies. I\u2019d managed a semifunctional relationship for a few days, which was a personal record. My life was so much better than it was when I\u2019d rolled into town.</p><p>The first order of business was turning off this playlist, because Adele\u2019s gorgeous emo postbreakup music was killing me.</p><p>I scrolled through the lists on my iPod until I found some Lynyrd Skynyrd and filled my kitchen with the sounds of \u201cSweet Home Alabama.\u201d I pulled out a notebook and pen and began painstakingly writing text and printing instructions for the menu of my new restaurant.</p><p>Coda</p><p>10</p><p>Jolene, put the green down, and step away from the wall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s so cheerful!\u201d Jolene protested, holding up the paint can labeled \u201cNew Leaf.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s neon!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is rather, er, bright,\u201d Chef Gamling told her gently.</p><p>Jolene chucked a fork at my head. \u201cIt is not!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYipe!\u201d I cried, ducking out of the way. \u201cHey, you left the kids at home to limit the number of items thrown at my head tonight. And giving me a fork-related head contusion will not change the fact that our color scheme is white and blue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, we left the kids at home because we\u2019re spending the evening in a construction zone,\u201d Zeb said. \u201cA construction zone with a bar in it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust give the green a chance!\u201d Jolene begged.</p><p>\u201dAre you going to be this stubborn about everything?\u201d I groaned.</p> <p>I shot a pleading look at Zeb, Jane, Gabriel, Dick, and Andrea, who were sitting at the bar, watching the exchange gleefully. Apparently, whatever instinct they may have had to protect the \u201cnew girl\u201d in the group had evaporated over Halloween, when I beat Jane at quarters while dressed as Wonder Woman. Vampires seemed to take drinking games very seriously.</p><p>My eyes narrowed. \u201cOh, you guys are no help whatsoever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust be glad it\u2019s not peach,\u201d Gabriel said.</p><p>Jane cackled when she saw my confused expression. \u201cSomeday, I\u2019ll show you pictures of the bridesmaids\u2019 dresses from Jolene and Zeb\u2019s wedding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t even pick out that color!\u201d Jolene retorted. \u201cThat\u2019s not fair.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m just here for the free eats,\u201d Dick said, raising a shot glass full of the Blood Creek Barbecue Sauce. Although Faux Type O technically owned the recipe, the company was so impressed with my plan to open a vampire-friendly restaurant that they\u2019d let me keep the rights to serving it. We were calling the special menu Southern Comforts Blood Shots, to prevent confusions with the liquor menu or the human menu. My resident vampire friends were helping me tweak the recipes with another taste-testing.</p><p>Chef Gamling, who had agreed to work part-time in my kitchen when the restaurant opened, was leading them through the \u201cappropriate tasting process\u201d and recording their comments.</p><p>Since he didn\u2019t drink blood, Zeb was content to sample the various pie concoctions we\u2019d come up with\u2014caramel apple, peppermint cream with a crushed Oreo crust, and a mixed fruit involving strawberries, cranberries, and raspberries. And, of course, he enjoyed my attempts to control his wife\u2019s horrendous decorating skills. Is there a color-sense equivalent to being tone-deaf?</p><p>With the endless details I was juggling, I worried that I would be too busy to maintain my newfound connections with the group. But they simply wouldn\u2019t let me quietly fade into my work as I had in Chicago. Jolene was with me at every step of setting up shop, whether I wanted her opinions or not. Dick had offered to help me find dishes and equipment through his \u201cconnections,\u201d while Gabriel stood behind him and shook his dark head vehemently. Jane had offered her advice on starting a small business in the Hollow, the chief of which was to avoid the local Chamber of Commerce like the plague. Andrea\u2019s help had been invaluable while I waded through the complicated licensing process for blending and serving human donor blood. I supposed it shouldn\u2019t be easy to serve human blood to an unsuspecting public, but the red tape was a serious pain in the ass.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it premature to start picking paint colors when you have so much structural work to do around here?\u201d Gabriel asked, a concerned expression wrinkling his brow.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you just ask Sam to help you?\u201d Jane asked.</p> <p>\u201cYou know why,\u201d I shot back, making her raise her hands defensively.</p><p>\u201cI tried to help Tess find a contractor,\u201d Dick protested. While the girls tried to nurse me through my confused post-Sam feelings with ice cream and Jane Austen movies, Dick\u2019s method was taking me to The Cellar and getting me hammered. Which made Dick my new favorite guy ever.</p><p>I shot my new drinking buddy the stink-eye. \u201cDick, it only took me two \u2018laying pipe\u2019 innuendos from your handsy plumbing guy to decide that I will only use contractors I find through the Yellow Pages.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d Dick exclaimed. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t my guy, that was a cousin of my guy. Doesn\u2019t count! And didn\u2019t he come back to apologize?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, black and blue, he came back to apologize, which meant I ended up feeling guilty because you beat the tar out of him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGabriel helped!\u201d Dick protested. \u201cIf I knew he would go in for a boob grab in lieu of a handshake, I never would have recommended him. The beatin\u2019 was deserved.\u201d</p><p>Dick turned as the battered cowbell above the door jangled and Sam stepped through.</p><p>Well, I could at least take comfort in the fact that he looked as bad as I felt. The last two weeks of radio silence had not been kind to Sam Clemson. He looked as if Dick and Gabriel had gotten a piece of him, too\u2014dark bruiselike circles under his eyes, paler-than-usual cheeks, and thin, pinched lips. Something seemed lodged in my throat, a weighty lump that kept me from breathing or swallowing.</p> <p>Seeing him, all wretched and drawn, made me feel a bit ridiculous for being so angry with him. He hadn\u2019t hurt me intentionally. The f-word he\u2019d used wasn\u2019t an insult. And he wasn\u2019t the first guy to have lingering feelings for his ex-wife. Don\u2019t get me wrong. The fact that I seemed to feel more for him than he felt for me still hurt. But I didn\u2019t feel the urge to damage him or my drywall, which felt like progress.</p><p>I finally choked out a profound \u201cSam?\u201d</p><p>The awkward silence continued for a few more agonizing seconds before Jane announced, \u201cWell, kids, I think we should be going now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut we\u2019ll miss the fireworks,\u201d Dick protested, then saw Andrea\u2019s stern expression. He sighed. \u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>Jane edged Gabriel off his stool while Andrea bumped Dick out the door. Jolene was so busy glaring at Sam that Zeb had to walk around the bar and literally drag her out. Chef Gamling gave Sam a long, speculative look before following the thundering herd out the door. I heard it shut just as Dick said, \u201cIf she throws knives and we miss it, I\u2019m going to be pissed.\u201d</p><p>Sam looked around the ruins of the dining room. \u201cI like what you\u2019ve done with the place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ve had a little trouble finding reliable contractors,\u201d I said, crossing my arms over my chest protectively. I wanted to round the bar, sit next to him on the stools. But I needed space. I needed a physical barrier to keep from making a complete fool of myself.</p><p>He nodded and picked up a shot glass from Andrea\u2019s plate. He smiled. \u201cYou\u2019re really going through with it, huh? The vampire menu?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see why not. I want to feed people. Whether they have a pulse is irrelevant,\u201d I said, fidgeting with a dishtowel.</p><p>\u201cSo, I\u2019ve been callin\u2019 you. A lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cOh, so there wasn\u2019t some tragic fire that destroyed your phone... which means you\u2019ve just been ignorin\u2019 me. That makes me feel better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t been ignoring you. I\u2019ve been giving you space,\u201d I countered.</p><p>\u201cThe difference is that when you give someone space, you tell them ahead of time. Otherwise, it\u2019s just ignorin\u2019 them. Look, I know you overheard me talkin\u2019 to Lindy. I don\u2019t know what I said that upset you, but I take it back. I take it all back. I just want you to talk to me again. I tried stayin\u2019 away... after the eighth straight day of you not returnin\u2019 my calls. But the house is just empty without you. There\u2019s no light, no music, no weird smells coming from the kitchen. I can\u2019t take it anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou told Lindy I was just a friend. You told her you felt sorry for me. You said you didn\u2019t hate her.\u201d</p><p>And yes, I did realize how lame that last bit sounded, but I wasn\u2019t about to weaken my position with logic.</p><p>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t hate her. I never hated her. I just don\u2019t want to be married to her anymore.\u201d Sam rounded the bar, advancing until his hand ghosted down the length of my arm, never quite touching. He smirked down at me. \u201cBesides, what was I supposed to say? \u2018Hey, Lindy, I know we still have a real estate and divorce settlement pending, but I want to let you know that I just had awesome sex with that woman who whacked you with a cast-iron pot. Yes, the same woman who helped me swipe the house out from under you, ruining your plan to sell it and keep the money for yourself. And by the way, I also think she\u2019s prettier and far more interesting than you\u2019? Lindy was already ranting and raving like a crazy woman about you, saying you\u2019d ruined her plans to sell the house to some doctor from Louisville. The last thing I wanted to do was give her more reasons to hate you. The fact that I couldn\u2019t wait to get back downstairs because your skin was soft and warm and smelled like honeysuckle was definitely going to make her hate you.\u201d</p><p>I glared up at him, but inside, I was doing the tiniest victory dance. \u201cBut what about \u2018You know I do\u2019?\u201d I asked.</p><p>He blinked a few times, as if trying to operate on the same insane wavelength as my brain. \u201cYou mean the part where she said, \u2018Are you sure you want to go through with this divorce?\u2019 And yes, I do. It was just like her to ask that right before the divorce was final. This is just another case of Lindy getting what she wanted and then not wanting it anymore. So, am I glad the divorce is final? Yes, I am. Am I glad the bank papers are signed and the house is mine? Yes, I am. And am I willing to call Lindy right now and describe our awesome sex in detail? Yes, I am.\u201d</p><p>My lips twitched as I squinted up at him. \u201cYou know, when I was a little girl and I dreamed of a man declaring his love for me, it did not involve the words \u2018Let\u2019s call my ex-wife and give her details about our awesome sex life.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say I was declaring my love for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, please.\u201d I snickered, rolling my eyes. \u201cI\u2019ve owned your ass since the moment you kissed me.\u201d</p><p>He pulled me closer, settling his hands at the small of my back. \u201cOh, you mean the night you tainted my food supply with a dangerous substance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh,\u201d I said, grinning, pressing my lips to his. His whole body seemed to relax, to sag against mine as he pulled me closer. I murmured against his chest, \u201cI think you need some time to be alone, to get over Lindy. I don\u2019t want to be that rebound girl who helps you heal up for your next \u2018real relationship.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoney, it doesn\u2019t get any more real than the girl who pepper-sprays my insides and drips hot candle wax on me while I sleep. Frankly, I have to make up with you. I\u2019m afraid of what would happen if you were angry at me much longer. I don\u2019t need to get over Lindy. We were over a long time ago. I\u2019ve been ready for a new life for a while now. I just needed everything else to catch up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to rush.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe won\u2019t,\u201d he promised. \u201cWe\u2019ll take it slow.\u201d Then he added under his breath, \u201cAs soon as we move your stuff back in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was thinking, it\u2019s pretty silly for you to live here, in a crappy little apartment, when there\u2019s plenty of room at the house. Besides, we should do it just to prove Lassiter wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo we should live together to break a hundred-year-old curse? That\u2019s a line I haven\u2019t heard before.\u201d I rolled my eyes at him. \u201cSo have you told Lindy I\u2019ll be moving in?\u201d</p><p>He ducked his head. \u201cNot important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe hit you with cookware, too, didn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot important,\u201d he insisted.</p><p>\u201cCan I hit her with cookware?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cIf you keep doing that to people, someone\u2019s going to file charges against you.\u201d He sighed into my neck. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to do anything to Lindy. She\u2019s not an issue for me anymore, and she shouldn\u2019t be one for you. We\u2019re not going to devote any more energy to her. And swinging that wok of yours takes a lot of energy.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body>  <p>I supposed that was fair. But I would keep my wok handy.</p><p>I laughed as he squeezed me tight. \u201cWell, I have to warn you, there will need to be some rules.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuch as?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPersonal space is overrated. I want to be able to see you at least a few hours a night, even if we have to move around our work schedules.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds reasonable,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I promise, I will only remove parts from the doors and cabinets when they need to be fixed, not just to amuse myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery reasonable,\u201d I told him. \u201cI will only threaten you with pans and pepper extracts when you really deserve it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the vampire issue,\u201d he said. \u201cAny idea where you stand on that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I admitted. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll be able to give you an answer anytime soon. But for right now, I want to be with you. Bad furniture and all. Besides, I need a contractor, and you\u2019re the only one I know who doesn\u2019t make my skin crawl.\u201d</p> <p>He gave me a quick flash of a grin, then covered it with a mocking frown. He slid his arms around me. \u201cI don\u2019t know if you can afford me.\u201d</p><p>I kissed him, pinching his butt just a little bit. \u201cI think we can work out a barter system.\u201d </p>  </body></html>"]
