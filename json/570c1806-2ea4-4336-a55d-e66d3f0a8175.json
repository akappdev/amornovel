She pulled her light sweater tighter around her and looked for traffic before crossing the street to the diner where she worked.</p><p>Not that there was ever much traffic in Clyde, and certainly not this early in the morning, but later, the sleepy town would come alive and a host of regulars would filter into the diner for their morning coffee, breakfast and, more importantly, the day\u2019s gossip.</p> <p>The bell jangled when she entered the front door. It was a sound she never heard when the small diner was filled with customers, but in the morning, it seemed jarringly loud and it always startled the quiet peace that blanketed the tiny mountain town.</p><p>Her town.</p><p>It had taken her months to settle in and truly feel as though she belonged here. It was a far cry from the hustle and bustle of New York City, and a year ago, if someone had told her that she\u2019d end up taking refuge here, in a place that still hadn\u2019t caught up to the rest of the world, she would have laughed and said never.</p><p>She was, or at least she had been, a total city girl. She loved the conveniences of living in one of the world\u2019s largest cities. Everything was at her fingertips. A walk, or a subway ride away. Sometimes a cab ride if she was in a hurry.</p><p>Max, her older brother, had found his way to Clyde when he\u2019d fallen in love with Callie. Her family had lived here for decades. They were as much a part of this small town as the fixtures and buildings themselves.</p> <p>Lauren had always assumed she\u2019d stay in the city. Settle down with a businessman who shared the same interests as she. Have two children, a boy and a girl, and complete the American dream.</p><p>The problem with that fantasy was that she\u2019d chosen the wrong man, and now she could never return to her old life. She didn\u2019t want to return to her old life.</p><p>She\u2019d found more than just sanctuary in Clyde. She\u2019d found the family she\u2019d always longed for in the Colters. She understood well why Max had been willing to give up his wanderlust and settle in these mountains, surrounded by the family who\u2019d pulled him\u2014and Lauren\u2014into their arms.</p><p>For the first time in months, she was starting to regain some of her old confidence. More importantly, she was learning to forgive herself for the choices she\u2019d made. She could now go to sleep at night without cringing over her na\u00efvet\u00e9. Or at least most nights.</p><p>The first step for her had been moving out of Max and Callie\u2019s home and into her own apartment in town. It hadn\u2019t been easy to convince her protective older brother\u2014or the Colters for that matter\u2014that she was ready to be out on her own. They\u2019d grown used to having her close and watching over her, and while she adored them for their unconditional love and protection, she\u2019d been thrilled to take that step.</p><p>She had a place of her own, and she had a job. So it wasn\u2019t the career she\u2019d planned, nor was it a job worthy of her college degree, but it was a job that paid well. She made enough to get by on, and she wasn\u2019t depending on her brother\u2019s fortune to support her.</p> <p>She went into the kitchen, where she found Clark warming up the fryers and the grill and Evie brewing the coffee. She reached for one of the aprons and quickly tied it around her waist.</p><p>After smiling and offering her good morning to Clark and Evie, she headed out front to make sure the tables were in order and that the sugar and spice containers were filled.</p><p>It was a routine she followed daily. Same schedule. Same time. In her previous life, she would have been bored and ready to go stir-crazy. Now she found the routine predictable and soothing.</p><p>It was safe.</p><p>There was no constant fear that she\u2019d do or say the wrong thing. No worrying endlessly over what kind of mood Joel was in. No blaming herself when he took his temper out on her.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t realized just how far she\u2019d been beaten down by the man she was involved with, until she\u2019d been away for months and was able to objectively look back at just how stupid she\u2019d been.</p><p>She sucked in a deep breath and chastised herself for going back. She couldn\u2019t undo the past, but she could sure as hell make certain she didn\u2019t make the same mistakes again.</p><p>New life. New chance. New opportunity to be a different person. Or at least to find the person she\u2019d been before she\u2019d allowed Joel to change her.</p> <p>At six A.M. sharp, she flipped the switch to the neon Open sign and made sure she had an order pad and a pen in her apron pocket.</p><p>She and Evie worked the morning shift with Clark manning the grill. The diner closed at two because Dillon Colter\u2019s pub opened at lunch and the pub usually attracted the evening crowd.</p><p>Lauren liked the hours because it left her with the entire afternoon off, and her workday was behind her. She often spent the afternoons with Callie and Max or when they were gone, she\u2019d visit with Holly and Lily Colter.</p><p>They tended to stop in to visit Lauren more often now that she\u2019d moved into town. Lauren knew they still worried about her and that none of them had been thrilled with the idea of her moving out on her own so soon.</p><p>Except Holly.</p><p>Of all of them, Holly understood Lauren the best, and Lauren loved the older woman for her willingness to give Lauren room to breathe.</p><p>She needed to regain her confidence and reassert herself. Make her own decisions and live her own life. She may not be ready to take on the entire world yet, but she could safely say she was ready to take on the town of Clyde.</p><p>She smiled when the bell jangled, signaling the first customer of the day. She turned, already having a good idea of who it would be, and she was right.</p><p>Seth Colter, the sheriff, strode into the diner and took his usual seat by the window.</p><p>\u201cMorning, Seth,\u201d she said as she approached his table.</p><p>Seth looked up, giving her a warm smile that made her insides squeeze. All of the Colters had been so good to her.</p><p>\u201cMorning, Lauren. Everything okay today?\u201d</p><p>It was the same question he asked her everyday.</p><p>\u201cYep. How is Lily doing? You want your usual?\u201d</p><p>Seth\u2019s entire face softened at the mention of his wife.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s doing great. More tired than usual, but we\u2019re taking good care of her. And yeah, my usual will be great. Keep the coffee coming if you don\u2019t mind. Had a late call last night and I\u2019m operating on three hours\u2019 sleep.\u201d</p><p>Lauren winced. \u201cOuch. Anything major?\u201d</p><p>Seth laughed. \u201cAs major as it ever gets here. Lost hiker. His girlfriend got worried when he didn\u2019t show up for dinner. Turns out he was over in the next town with another woman.\u201d</p><p>Lauren shook her head and then turned in the direction of the kitchen. \u201cI\u2019ll be right back with your coffee.\u201d</p><p>She grabbed the freshly brewed pot of coffee and poured a cup, adding two sugars and one cream. She quickly scribbled Seth\u2019s order, tore off the paper and then slid it across the divider to Clark.</p><p>Then she went back to Seth\u2019s table with his cup of coffee.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a goddess,\u201d Seth said, grabbing for the cup before it left her hand. \u201cHey, before I forget, I\u2019m supposed to tell you that Callie is coming over to visit Lily this afternoon and Lily wanted me to tell you that you should stop over after your shift.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. I just might do that,\u201d Lauren said.</p><p>\u201cHow are you liking the new place?\u201d Seth asked, peering at her intently over his coffee. \u201cYou having any problems?\u201d</p><p>She smiled at the concern in his eyes. It was nice to have people who cared about her.</p><p>\u201cThe place is great. Just perfect for me. It\u2019s cozy and it\u2019s right here in town. I know Max worries, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe all worry,\u201d Seth corrected gently.</p><p>\u201cYes, I know, but you shouldn\u2019t. I\u2019m fine. The apartment is great. I love the job. It\u2019s nice to be around people again without . . .\u201d</p><p>She trailed off, embarrassed by where she\u2019d nearly gone with the conversation.</p><p>\u201cWithout?\u201d Seth prompted.</p><p>\u201cWorrying that they\u2019ll hurt me,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>Seth reached over and squeezed her hand. \u201cNow that you don\u2019t have to worry about here. You have me and Max plus the dads and Dillon and Michael to watch out for you. Not to mention Callie, Lily and my mother, and between you and me, someone would be a damn fool to ever cross my mother. She\u2019s pretty scary when it comes to protecting her babies, even if her babies are grown damn men and women.\u201d</p><p>Lauren chuckled. \u201cShe\u2019s the best.\u201d</p><p>Seth nodded. \u201cThat she is. She\u2019s currently on a tear about the arrival of her first grandchild. Dillon, Michael and I just try to stay out of her way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Seth,\u201d she said solemnly, when he lifted his hand away. \u201cI appreciate your kindness more than you know. I don\u2019t know what I would have done without all of you and especially your mom.\u201d</p><p>His expression was serious. \u201cYou\u2019re family now, Lauren. We take family very serious. You can come to us for anything, anytime. We want you to be happy here.\u201d</p><p>She raised her head when another customer came in. \u201cLet me go get this customer. Your food should be up in just a sec and I\u2019ll get it out to you.\u201d</p><p>Seth smiled and nodded and then called out a greeting to the person who\u2019d walked in. Lauren was still learning the people of the town, but she prided herself on knowing most of their faces, even if she hadn\u2019t put names to everyone yet.</p><p>Small-town life wasn\u2019t ever anything that had appealed to her in the past, but she\u2019d grown to love Clyde and all its inhabitants. They\u2019d embraced her. Made her feel welcome. She\u2019d only been here since just before Christmas and already it was like she\u2019d lived here all her life.</p><p>She sighed a little as she walked away from Seth and warmly greeted the man at the next table. Seth was a good man. As were both his brothers Dillon and Michael.</p><p>The Colters were . . . Well, they were different. There were no two ways about it. Seth\u2019s parents, or \u201cthe dads\u201d as he called them, were not that standard set of parental figures. Holly Colter was married to three brothers and in turn their three sons were married to one woman. Lily.</p><p>Callie, the baby of the bunch, was the only one who had what could be deemed a traditional relationship. She was married to Lauren\u2019s brother, Max.</p><p>The hell of it was that Lauren envied all three women with all her heart. Holly, Lily and Callie. Maybe even especially Holly and Lily.</p><p>Each woman had three men completely and utterly devoted to their happiness and well-being. They loved Holly and Lily, and their devotion ran so deep that sometimes it hurt Lauren to look at them.</p><p>What would it be like to be cherished and adored by three men? To have that kind of relationship where she would be the heart and foundation, the very core of it all. She couldn\u2019t even fathom being so loved, but she wanted it with all her heart.</p><p>Old feelings of insecurity crept to the surface. And with it, accompanying shame and humiliation. She\u2019d been so desperate to find love that she\u2019d found herself in a relationship she never should have been involved in. Worse, she\u2019d remained in it when it had been clear that she didn\u2019t belong.</p><p>She had only herself to blame for remaining. She couldn\u2019t be blamed for his actions, but she sure as hell could take responsibility for not standing up for herself sooner.</p><p>Shaking off the cloud of sadness that hovered over her, she busied herself with the rapidly filling diner. For the next few hours, she barely had time to breathe, much less dwell on her past mistakes.</p><p>Besides, she was beyond that now. The future was what she made it. Here in this tiny Colorado mountain town, she\u2019d found her niche. A new life. A brand new beginning where the mistakes of the past wouldn\u2019t continue to haunt her.</p><p>Chapter 2</p><p>NEW YORK CITY</p><p>WE\u2019VE been at this for months and still don\u2019t have a single goddamn lead,\u201d Liam Prescott bit out.</p><p>His partner, Noah Sullivan, grimaced. \u201cYou aren\u2019t telling me anything I don\u2019t know. But here\u2019s the thing. We didn\u2019t imagine those bruises on Lauren. And we damn sure didn\u2019t imagine how terrified and ashamed she was. Still gets my gut all into a knot every time I think of how she looked the first day we met her.\u201d</p><p>Liam\u2019s lips drew back into a snarl as he pulled the SUV into a tight parking spot outside of a brownstone divided into apartments. He sat for a long moment, his big hands curled around the steering wheel as he stared up at the number above the archway to the front door of the building.</p><p>\u201cThis better turn up something,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve exhausted all our options. It\u2019s like this guy doesn\u2019t exist.\u201d</p><p>Noah got out and Liam followed. They walked up the steps and Noah buzzed the apartment. They waited a long moment and Noah buzzed again.</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t look like she\u2019s home,\u201d Liam muttered.</p><p>Noah blew out his breath. \u201cOkay, let\u2019s go wait in the car. We\u2019ll hang out for a while and see if she shows.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The men retreated, climbing back into the SUV. Noah propped his elbow against the window and frowned. Then he glanced in Liam\u2019s direction.</p><p>\u201cDo you think she was straight with us? With her brother?\u201d</p><p>Liam\u2019s brow creased and he turned, angling his body so he leaned against the driver\u2019s side door. \u201cYou think she lied? You saw her, Noah. She sure as hell didn\u2019t make that shit up.\u201d</p><p>Noah held up his hand. \u201cDon\u2019t get all pissed off. I know she didn\u2019t lie about what the bastard did to her.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen what the hell do you think she lied about?\u201d</p><p>Noah hesitated. \u201cI\u2019m not sure, but I don\u2019t think we got the full story. This guy is a ghost. No one knows a damn thing about him. No prints in the system, and I doubt Lauren was the first woman he beat up. Assholes like him usually have a few run-ins with the law.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think she\u2019s protecting him?\u201d Liam asked incredulously.</p><p>There was a hint of anger to his voice and his scowl deepened.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Noah said quietly. \u201cI think she\u2019s scared out of her mind.\u201d</p> <p>Liam\u2019s expression darkened even further and he gripped the steering wheel until his knuckles went white. \u201cI want that bastard.\u201d</p><p>Noah nodded because he felt the same way. When they\u2019d taken the job from Max Wilder, they\u2019d expected a stereotypical rich-girl scenario. An overprotective brother who wanted a babysitter for the sister he didn\u2019t have time for.</p><p>Nothing could have been further from the truth.</p><p>Lauren Wilder was a shy, sweet woman who\u2019d been badly abused by a man she\u2019d trusted. From the moment Noah had laid eyes on her, he\u2019d ached to hold her. To wipe away all the hurt and show her that all men weren\u2019t abusive assholes.</p><p>Liam had reacted even more strongly than Noah had. He\u2019d taken one look at Lauren and had been so furious that he\u2019d ended up scaring the holy hell out of her.</p><p>The two men had worked together for a hell of a long time. They\u2019d seen and done it all. But they\u2019d never fallen for the same woman, and Noah still wasn\u2019t sure what the hell they were supposed to do about it.</p> <p>For now, they existed in denial, and they only discussed her in a professional context. Anytime it started to get personal, Liam clammed up and got that look in his eyes that meant the subject was closed.</p><p>Noah sighed. \u201cI want him too, but I\u2019m starting to think we\u2019re barking up the wrong tree.\u201d</p><p>Liam\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cWhat the hell does that mean?\u201d</p><p>Suddenly Noah straightened, his gaze fixed on a tall blond woman walking down the sidewalk.</p><p>\u201cI think that\u2019s her,\u201d he said.</p><p>Liam\u2019s hand went to the door handle, but he waited, tense and silent.</p><p>Both men watched as she turned up the walkway to the apartment. A moment later, she took her keys out and unlocked the door.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d Noah said.</p> <p>He and Liam got out of the car and hurried up the walkway just as the woman swung open the door and stepped inside the foyer.</p><p>\u201cMs. Jennings?\u201d Noah called.</p><p>The woman whirled around, fear immediate in her eyes.</p><p>Noah held out a placating hand. \u201cMy apologies for startling you. My name is Noah Sullivan and this is my partner, Liam Prescott. I was hoping for a moment of your time. We\u2019re looking for someone, and it\u2019s very important that we find him. We\u2019d just like to ask you a few questions if that\u2019s all right.\u201d</p><p>She stared suspiciously at them, her hand still gripping the edge of the door.</p><p>\u201cAre you cops?\u201d</p><p>Noah shook his head. \u201cNo, ma\u2019am. We\u2019re not cops. I guess you could say we\u2019re investigators of sorts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike a P.I.? I always thought those weren\u2019t real. Just stuff you see on cop shows and in the movies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not private investigators,\u201d Liam said gruffly. \u201cWe were employed to keep a woman safe from the jerk who beat on her. We want to find this asshole so we can put him away. We need your help to do that.\u201d</p><p>She blinked at Liam\u2019s bluntness but her stance relaxed and she was clearly conflicted about whether to allow them into her building. Finally she took a step back, opening the door wider.</p><p>\u201cCome in,\u201d she murmured. \u201cMy name is Susan, but my friends call me Suki. Long story, but you can call me Suki.\u201d</p><p>Noah could tell the woman was as nervous as a cat backed into an alley. He didn\u2019t want to frighten her, but he had Liam with him and Liam was . . . Well, he was Liam. Blunt. Overwhelming. And growly.</p><p>Especially when it came to Lauren.</p><p>Once they walked up to her second floor apartment and were seated in the living room, Noah pulled out a photo of Lauren and slid it across the coffee table toward Suki.</p><p>\u201cCan you tell me if you\u2019ve ever seen this woman?\u201d</p><p>Suki went completely still. Noah wasn\u2019t even sure she was breathing. Her hands shook as she reached for the photo and fear crowded her eyes.</p><p>Then she turned with a fake, too-bright smile and said, \u201cNo, sorry I haven\u2019t. Did something happen to her? Is she . . . dead?\u201d</p><p>The last was asked fearfully and Liam frowned, leaning forward.</p><p>\u201cNow why would you assume she\u2019s dead or that something\u2019s happened to her?\u201d</p><p>Panic flared on her face. \u201cI just assumed. I mean something had to have happened to her if you\u2019re looking for her, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe aren\u2019t looking for her,\u201d Noah said calmly. \u201cWe just asked if you\u2019ve ever seen her.\u201d</p><p>Suki shook her head. \u201cNo. Sorry. Don\u2019t know her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you lying?\u201d Liam asked bluntly.</p><p>The woman vibrated with fear. Most people would have been pissed at blatantly being called a liar. Not this woman. She looked like she was going to be ill.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s try another question,\u201d Noah said. \u201cDo you know who this woman was seeing? Know his name? What he looks like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish I could help you,\u201d she croaked. \u201cBut he\u2019d kill me.\u201d</p><p>Liam and Noah exchanged quick glances. Noah\u2019s pulse sped up and he leaned forward, scooting to the edge of his seat in anticipation. Finally, they were getting somewhere.</p><p>\u201cWho, Suki? Who would kill you?\u201d</p><p>When she looked up, tears shone in her eyes. \u201cHe hurt her. We all knew it. He always kept her on a very short leash. He told her how to dress, how to act, where to be and if she didn\u2019t fall into step accordingly, she always wore bruises the next day.\u201d</p><p>A low growl emanated from Liam\u2019s throat. Noah shot him a warning look. The last thing they needed was to terrify Suki further and have her shut down and refuse to talk.</p><p>\u201cWho did this to her?\u201d Noah asked softly. \u201cI need your help, Suki. I want to nail his ass to the wall and make damn sure he never does this to another woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust give us his name,\u201d Liam urged. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to tell us anything else. Just give us enough to find him.\u201d</p><p>She laughed, a raw, hysterical sound that was abrasive to Noah\u2019s ears.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t stop him. He has cops on his payroll. He won\u2019t ever be punished.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are other ways of getting justice that don\u2019t necessarily involve cops,\u201d Liam bit out.</p><p>At that she went quiet and stared intently back at Liam. For a long moment she looked between the two men as if grappling with her decision to confide in them.</p><p>Finally she drew in a deep breath. \u201cHis name is Joel Knight. It\u2019s all I\u2019ll say, and I won\u2019t testify. I won\u2019t give a statement. I\u2019ll deny ever seeing you, talking to you or even that I know who the hell you are.\u201d</p><p>Liam\u2019s eyes narrowed to slits. \u201cJoel Knight? Are you sure?\u201d</p><p>Noah shook his head. He\u2019d known that Lauren was holding out on them. What he hadn\u2019t realized was that she\u2019d blatantly lied. She\u2019d made up some other name of some fictitious guy and they\u2019d spent the last four months wasting their fucking time searching out nonexistent leads.</p><p>\u201cOf course I\u2019m sure,\u201d Suki said, an edge to her voice. \u201cI\u2019m one of his girls.\u201d</p><p>Noah lifted an eyebrow. \u201cWhat does that mean exactly?\u201d</p><p>She pressed her lips together. \u201cIt\u2019s time for you to go. I have an appointment in an hour and I have to get ready. I\u2019d like you to leave. I\u2019ve said all I\u2019m going to say.\u201d</p><p>Liam opened his mouth to argue, but she\u2019d already risen, her agitation evident as she stalked to the door to open it. Her hand gripped the edge of the door, and she was pale as they walked past. She looked like she was going to be ill at any moment.</p><p>As soon as they were over the threshold, the door slammed behind them. Noah winced. \u201cDamn, you get the idea we aren\u2019t welcome any longer?\u201d</p><p>Liam made a noise that sounded like a snort, and the two men returned to the parked SUV.</p><p>It was quiet in the vehicle as Liam drove away. Noah wasn\u2019t entirely certain where he was going. He hadn\u2019t gone back in the direction of their offices.</p><p>After a moment, Noah pulled out his cell and started to put in a call to his buddy who worked for the NYPD. He hesitated, Suki\u2019s words floating back to his mind. Then he cursed and put the phone back.</p><p>She was making him paranoid. For all he knew she was talking out her ass.</p><p>\u201cProblem?\u201d Liam asked.</p><p>\u201cI was going to call Johnny. See what he could dig up on this Joel Knight dude.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd? Why didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Noah grimaced, already feeling a little stupid. \u201cBecause Suki said he had cops on his payroll.\u201d</p><p>He thought Liam would tell him what an idiot he was being. Out of the hundreds of cops in the city, what were the odds that it would involve their contact?</p><p>But Liam merely nodded. \u201cBetter to be safe. We can do some digging on our own, but I\u2019d rather go straight to the source.\u201d</p><p>Noah\u2019s brows drew together. Liam pulled into a parking place that was half a block down from a pub they frequented.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201d Noah asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you over a drink,\u201d Liam said.</p><p>If Liam was actually going to hit a pub so they could sit and talk, this had to be serious. Liam was more of an act-now-think-later kind of guy. Elaborate planning wasn\u2019t one of his stronger points. That was Noah\u2019s job. Noah thought out issues. Liam carried out the plan. It was a combination that had worked well for them over the years.</p><p>They ambled in and instead of sitting at the bar, they took a seat at one of the tables in the far corner, and Liam held up two fingers to the waitress.</p><p>Nodding, she offered a hello in greeting and then hurried off to get their order. They were here regularly enough that the staff was well acquainted with their preferences.</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s going on in that head of yours?\u201d Noah pressed.</p><p>\u201cI think we should go see Lauren,\u201d Liam said in a low voice.</p><p>Noah frowned. \u201cThat\u2019s not what we were hired to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck what we were hired for. We can\u2019t do the job unless we have all the information from Lauren. And we don\u2019t have it. We\u2019ve been chasing our tails because Lauren was too afraid to tell us or her brother the truth about who abused her. If we confront her, we\u2019re less likely to get the brush-off. If we call her up, she\u2019s not going to just offer us this information over the phone.\u201d</p><p>Noah sighed because . . . shit. This was going to open a whole damn can of worms.</p><p>\u201cYou know this isn\u2019t a good idea,\u201d Noah said bluntly. \u201cWe both obviously have feelings for her. We can\u2019t do our job if we\u2019re too busy fighting over who gets the girl.\u201d</p><p>The waitress appeared, and Liam clammed up while she plopped the cold bottles down on the table. Once she left, Liam took a sip before carefully setting it back down. Noah waited. There was definitely something on Liam\u2019s mind.</p><p>Liam stared directly at Noah, his gaze intent, jaw tight. \u201cYou ever wonder why I just let Lauren go so easily?\u201d</p><p>Noah\u2019s brow crinkled. \u201cMax came to get her and brought her home with him. What could you have possibly done?\u201d</p><p>Liam simmered with impatience. \u201cCome on, Noah. Are you telling me you didn\u2019t care when she left? That it didn\u2019t bother you that we had to trust in the fact that her brother could keep her safe? That you didn\u2019t want to tell him he was making a huge fucking mistake so that we could keep her close to us at all times so we\u2019d make sure no one ever hurt her again? Quit pretending you don\u2019t care. This is me you\u2019re talking to. I know better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what?\u201d Noah snapped. \u201cWhat the fuck was I supposed to do? I couldn\u2019t damn well make a move on her. Not after that shithead did what he did to her. We were strangers to her, and we scared her shitless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt brings me back to my original question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t damn well know why you let her go so easily,\u201d Noah said impatiently. \u201cDo enlighten me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe few times we got her to actually talk to us, she spoke about the family her brother married into. That her sister-in-law had three fathers\u2014all married to the same woman\u2014and that her brothers were also hooked up with the same woman.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Noah nodded. \u201cYeah, I remember it. Sounded a little bizarre, but whatever.\u201d</p><p>Liam\u2019s eyes gleamed. \u201cI wanted her to go back with Max because I wanted her to be around that kind of relationship. See how it worked. Become comfortable with it. Maybe even be able to view it as not so unorthodox.\u201d</p><p>Realization crept into Noah\u2019s mind, grabbed hold and shook him until he was staring at Liam in astonishment.</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t saying what I think you\u2019re saying are you?\u201d</p> <p>Liam cocked one eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cAt what point were you going to ask me how I felt about it?\u201d Noah demanded.</p><p>\u201cAre you saying you\u2019re against it? Are you saying you\u2019ll back off if I tell you I want Lauren?\u201d</p><p>Anger nipped at Noah\u2019s heel. It prickled his nape until he was gripping his beer bottle so tight, he feared it would break.</p><p>\u201cThink about it, Noah,\u201d Liam said softly. \u201cThink real hard about it. We\u2019ll get on a plane and go talk to Lauren about the guy who beat her up. After you see her again, you tell me what you want to do. Because I\u2019m not backing off. I\u2019m going to wait for as long as it takes, but when she\u2019s ready, I\u2019m going to be there.\u201d</p> <p>Chapter 3</p><p>LAUREN finished tidying the tiny living room of her efficiency apartment and stared around in satisfaction. It was small, but it was filled with furniture and knickknacks, and was decorated to look homey and cozy.</p><p>Max had been so helpful in her getting back on her feet, but she owed the most to Holly, Lily and Callie. The three women had dragged her shopping and they\u2019d spent a tireless amount of time making sure Lauren\u2019s apartment was one she was comfortable and happy in.</p><p>It was her day off from the diner, and while she had standing invitations to drop in on her brother and sister-in-law or any of the Colters, today she just wanted a quiet day in her apartment reading.</p><p>Later she\u2019d take a walk down Main Street and do some windowshopping. It amused her that window-shopping in Clyde consisted of looking into the one women\u2019s boutique that sold everything from lingerie to accessories and everything in between.</p><p>There was a small, used bookstore at the end, and she always looked forward to scanning the new stock to see what struck her fancy. Callie had been after her to buy an e-reader so she could just download books from the online retailers without ever leaving her house, but there was something about the trip to the bookstore and returning home with a bag of books she couldn\u2019t wait to dig into.</p> <p>And there was the simple fact that she couldn\u2019t afford the e-reader right now. It had taken every penny to move in and buy what was needed for the apartment. If she splurged and bought the reading device, she\u2019d be uncontrollable with buying e-books.</p><p>For now, she\u2019d have to stick with gently used and savor every book. Besides, she couldn\u2019t trade in a digital book when she was finished.</p><p>She perused her bookshelf and finally selected the newest Jaci Burton book she\u2019d purchased. Just as she settled down to indulge, there was a knock at her door</p><p>Frowning, she pushed herself up from the couch and went to the front door. It was probably one of the Colter women. It could even be Max, but he was usually better about calling to let her know he was stopping by, whereas the Colter women\u2014especially Holly\u2014just dropped by whenever they got the urge.</p><p>But when she opened the door and saw who was standing there, her jaw went completely slack as she gaped at Noah Sullivan and Liam Prescott.</p><p>They didn\u2019t belong here. They represented a part of her past she wanted to forget. They were a world away, in a city she\u2019d fled.</p><p>\u201cLauren,\u201d Noah acknowledged with a tight nod. \u201cYou\u2019re looking good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou look great,\u201d Liam amended softly.</p> <p>She still couldn\u2019t find her tongue. What were they doing here?</p><p>\u201cCan we come in?\u201d Noah asked. \u201cWe need to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA-about w-what?\u201d</p><p>She clutched the door tighter and pulled it so it narrowed the gap.</p><p>Liam frowned. \u201cLauren, we aren\u2019t going to hurt you. We just need to talk to you. It\u2019s important.\u201d</p><p>Her pulse was racing fast enough to make her light-headed. She knew Noah and Liam posed no danger to her. Or at least she thought she knew. It wasn\u2019t them she feared as much as why they were here.</p><p>\u201cOpen the door, Lauren,\u201d Noah said in a quiet tone.</p><p>Realizing how much attention they were likely attracting, she finally opened the door and let them walk into the living room.</p><p>If it had seemed small to her before, now it was tiny with the two big men filling it.</p><p>She had a love seat and an armchair, and she quickly took the armchair so the two men would be left with the love seat.</p><p>Perched on the edge, she waited while they made themselves comfortable. Or at least as much as they could, trying to fit their large frames on her small piece of furniture.</p><p>She balled up her fingers together and stuck her hands between her knees to prevent them from shaking. Their presence unnerved her for too many reasons to list.</p><p>And yet she drank in the sight of them, unable to tear her gaze from the two men who\u2019d once been hired to protect her.</p><p>They were the complete antithesis of Joel, and maybe that was why she\u2019d allowed herself to relax around them and trust them. In the beginning she\u2019d thrown up every barrier she could, anything to prevent them from getting close.</p><p>But they\u2019d broken every wall she\u2019d placed between them. They\u2019d bullied her mercilessly, making sure she ate, that she took care of herself. They couldn\u2019t possibly know just how much she\u2019d softened toward them, because she\u2019d been too intent on shutting them out and treating them indifferently.</p><p>When Max had arrived at her apartment, determined to take her home with him and Callie, part of her was hugely relieved while the other part of her was reluctant to let go of the two men she\u2019d come to rely on.</p><p>Having them near her just made her feel safe in a world where she was anything but. If they knew what she\u2019d done and all she\u2019d kept from them, they\u2019d be pissed as hell.</p><p>She\u2019d made some horrifically stupid choices. She could admit that now. But at the time, she\u2019d been a scared-out-of-her-mind woman who desperately wanted a way out of her situation. She hadn\u2019t been thinking straight. But who could blame her?</p><p>She blamed herself enough without anyone else knowing the extent of her stupidity.</p><p>\u201cLauren?\u201d</p><p>She looked up quickly at the sound of Liam\u2019s voice. She realized that one or both men had been talking to her, and she had no idea what they\u2019d been saying.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she blurted. \u201cYou should have called. You caught me completely off guard.\u201d</p><p>Noah\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cAnd would you have been here if we\u2019d called? Or would you have been conveniently somewhere else?\u201d</p><p>Heat scorched her cheeks. He couldn\u2019t possibly know that\u2019s what she would have done. And yet he\u2019d called her out on it as if he\u2019d reached right into her head and plucked out her thoughts. Was she so easily read?</p><p>Liam cleared his throat. \u201cWe\u2019re here to discuss Joel Knight.\u201d</p><p>The blood rushed from her face. Her stomach knotted into a tight ball. She swayed precariously in her seat before making a grab for the arms with each hand so she didn\u2019t humiliate herself.</p><p>\u201cI want you to leave,\u201d she blurted out.</p><p>Liam leaned forward, those vivid blue eyes pinning her in place. His hair hung to his shoulders, in varying lengths, as if he didn\u2019t worry too much over how it was cut. It had a slight curl, making it look unruly. The ends flipped up this way and that. She could remember her fingers itching to reach out and smooth it.</p><p>It suddenly occurred to her why she\u2019d eventually grown to trust these two men. Why she\u2019d relaxed her guard toward the end of their business relationship.</p><p>They were nothing like Joel, and while she\u2019d always recognized this, it really hit home with her now.</p><p>Joel was polished. Never a hair out of place. Expensive clothing. Only the best suits. A tie. Perfectly shined shoes. Fake tan. He never walked out of his home unless he looked his best. He\u2019d never be caught dead with men like Liam and Noah.</p><p>Liam and Noah were . . . Well, they didn\u2019t give a shit. With them it was either take it or leave it, and your loss if you left it.</p><p>They both had dark hair, though Liam\u2019s was more of a true, midnight black and Noah\u2019s was such a dark brown that it was nearly black. Alone one might think his hair was black, but standing next to Liam, it was obvious that Noah\u2019s hair was lighter.</p><p>Liam\u2019s eyes were a shock of blue. Startling and vibrant. He was a man that drew stares from women and men alike. Noah\u2019s eyes were dark, like Lauren\u2019s own, only he had flecks of green and gold mixed in with the brown. In the right light, the different colors shone, lightening his eyes and making them mesmerizing to look at.</p><p>Both sported tattoos. Noah had what looked to be a Japanese symbol on his right arm and then a bracelet tattoo on his right wrist. Liam had intricately, colorfully rendered sleeves on both arms. Lauren had often stared when he wasn\u2019t looking, studying the designs. There was so much detail that she couldn\u2019t imagine how long it had taken the artist to complete the tattoos or how patient Liam had to have been through the process.</p><p>Separately, the men were forces to be reckoned with. But together? Complete badasses. No one in their right mind would cross them.</p><p>Except, she had. Crossed them. Or at least lied to them. And now they knew she\u2019d lied.</p><p>Liam was still staring holes through her. She wanted to crawl underneath her chair and stay there until they were gone. Until she forgot why they\u2019d come. She just wanted to put it all behind her. Them, Joel, everything.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not going anywhere,\u201d Liam said grimly. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a hell of a lot of explaining to do.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to be the weak, pathetic woman she\u2019d been such a short time ago. But them being here made her want to run for cover. She wanted to barricade herself in her bedroom and shut the world out.</p><p>But isn\u2019t that what she\u2019d done for so very long? She\u2019d existed in a haze of denial, too stupid, too cowardly to face the truth, and to act.</p><p>\u201cDamn it, Lauren, we\u2019re not going to hurt you,\u201d Noah said. \u201cStop looking at us like we\u2019re that bastard who abused you.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed and then lowered her head to put her hands over her face.</p><p>It was automatic to flinch away when she felt the hand on her shoulder. She heard a soft curse, but the hand was quickly removed.</p><p>\u201cLauren, look at me.\u201d</p><p>It was Liam, his voice as soft and warm as the first rays of spring sunshine. She was compelled to do as he said, even before she realized she had raised her head.</p><p>He took a deep breath, letting it blow out long and slow. It was a sigh that expressed a lot. Exasperation. Pity. She hated the pity. People who were truly victims deserved pity and kindness. She was someone who\u2019d allowed bad things to happen to her because she was too much of a coward\u2014and an idiot\u2014to get herself out of it. And on top of it all, she\u2019d lied to her brother, the one person who loved her in this world. She\u2019d lied to the Colters, not overtly. She\u2019d never voiced the lie, but it had been one of omission, which made it just as bad.</p><p>And she\u2019d lied to the two men who\u2019d vowed to protect her. She hadn\u2019t given them the information they\u2019d needed in order to do their job, because she\u2019d been afraid of what might happen to them.</p><p>None of the reasons made sense now. She was honest enough with herself to admit that. She hadn\u2019t known what she was doing or saying all those months ago. She\u2019d just reacted.</p><p>Now those lies were coming back to haunt her. Just when she\u2019d finally made peace with the choices she\u2019d made.</p><p>\u201cWe know about Joel Knight,\u201d Liam said quietly. \u201cThe question is why didn\u2019t you tell us about him? Why weren\u2019t you honest about who hurt you? Were you protecting him?\u201d</p><p>There was a note of fury that accompanied his last question, one she was forced to respond to.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d she said fiercely. \u201cI wasn\u2019t protecting him. I hate him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why?\u201d Noah demanded. \u201cWhy send us on a wild-goose chase trying to find a man who didn\u2019t exist? Do you have any idea how much time we\u2019ve wasted looking for the son of a bitch who beat you up? We had the local police involved. We pulled so many goddamn strings trying to find this man so he could be arrested, so he\u2019d never hurt another woman. And the entire time, we were looking for a ghost.\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes. \u201cI can understand why you\u2019re angry. I\u2019m sorry I wasted your time.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes popped open again when Liam let out an expletive that singed her ears.</p><p>\u201cYou have no idea why we\u2019re angry,\u201d Liam snapped.</p><p>Her hands were shaking again. Hell, her knees were too. Suddenly both men were close. Way too close. They\u2019d vacated the love seat and were on either side of her armchair. Big and hulking. She should be terrified, but she\u2019d never been afraid of them. They\u2019d always made her feel safe, from the moment they\u2019d accompanied Max to the apartment he\u2019d moved her to. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAsk us why we\u2019re angry, Lauren,\u201d Liam continued. \u201cIf you want the truth, then ask us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cW-why are you angry?\u201d she stammered out.</p><p>\u201cBecause we care about what happens to you,\u201d Noah said. \u201cAnd while we were off looking for the wrong guy, Joel Knight could have gotten to you. He could have hurt you and we would have never seen it coming. We\u2019re pissed because we were put in a position where we couldn\u2019t do our job. And our job is to make sure nothing happens to you.\u201d</p><p>Liam shook his head impatiently. \u201cYou aren\u2019t just a damn job to us, Lauren. Use your head. You have to see that we\u2019re attracted to you. That it makes us fucking insane knowing what this asshole did to you and when we think of what could have happened because you didn\u2019t tell us the truth, it makes me crazy. What if he\u2019d come after you? Did you ever think about that?\u201d</p> <p>She glanced rapidly between the two men, her mind in such turmoil that she couldn\u2019t even comprehend the meaning of what Liam had just blasted her with.</p><p>It was crazy. All of it. But even crazier? She\u2019d thought that she was alone in her fascination with these two men. She\u2019d been bewildered by the fact that she could even look at Noah and Liam and entertain the thoughts she\u2019d had.</p><p>He was wrong. She hadn\u2019t seen it. She hadn\u2019t even entertained the notion that they were attracted to her. All she\u2019d seen in their eyes was pity and rage, two things she would have thought they would feel for any woman in her situation. They were honorable men. Their job was to protect people. Whoever hired them. Why on earth would they feel anything more for her than anyone else they were assigned to protect?</p><p>She shook her head, denying it even as they sat in front of her, bluntly laying it out. She\u2019d allowed a man to walk all over her. She\u2019d allowed Joel to manipulate her, dictate to her. How could anyone look at that woman she\u2019d been and feel anything more than disgust?</p><p>She was an intelligent woman with a college degree. She had common sense, had always prided herself on being able to stand on her own two feet. And it had only taken Joel a few weeks before he\u2019d completely taken over her life.</p> <p>What shamed her most was that she\u2019d so easily fallen into the life that Joel had built for her. Before, she would have laughed at anyone who would have told her she would fall into a relationship with someone who controlled her every movement down to what she wore and what she ate.</p><p>Everyone around her had been able to see the truth of her relationship with Joel, but she\u2019d been so rooted in denial that she convinced herself they were wrong. She didn\u2019t think she\u2019d ever be able to forget the humiliation of having that veil lifted away and finally being able to see herself for what she was.</p><p>Gullible. Na\u00efve. Stupid.</p><p>It pricked her pride. It gutted her and made her feel the kind of worthlessness she never wished on anyone else.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you thinking?\u201d Noah asked in exasperation. \u201cWhat kind of hell are you putting yourself through right now? I can see the shame in your eyes. It\u2019s in your body language and written clearly on your face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t possibly understand what I\u2019m thinking or feeling,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cThen make us understand,\u201d Liam challenged. \u201cWhat could possibly motivate you to lie about the man who did this to you? If you weren\u2019t protecting him, then who the hell were you protecting?\u201d</p><p>She surged to her feet, her fingers fisted into tight balls. She honest to God wanted to hit someone, something. Anything to vent the rage building inside her. But that made her no better than the monster who\u2019d done the same to her.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t afraid for me!\u201d she yelled. \u201cI was afraid for Max. I was afraid for you!\u201d</p><p>Chapter 4</p><p>LIAM exchanged glances with Noah before rising to stand in front of Lauren. She wasn\u2019t angry, as her tone might indicate. She was terrified. It was evident in her body language and in her eyes.</p><p>He took a chance and reached out to her, his hands sliding gently down her arms and then back up again to cup her shoulders. Finding no resistance, he tightened his grip, and then he simply pulled her into his arms.</p><p>For a moment she was as stiff as a board. He couldn\u2019t even feel her breathe. But she didn\u2019t fight him or try to push him away. And then she finally relaxed, melting into him all soft and sweet.</p><p>He wrapped both his arms around her, enjoying the feel of her so close. He could smell her, could feel the warmth of her skin right through his clothing.</p> <p>\u201cTell me why you were afraid for us, Lauren,\u201d he said gently. \u201cWho is this man you think you need to protect us from?\u201d</p><p>She pulled away and glanced warily at him, and then in Noah\u2019s direction. Noah was scowling, and Liam didn\u2019t know if it was because Lauren was in his arms or if he was still pissed over the idea that she was trying to protect them from Joel Knight.</p><p>She looked as though she was still waging the battle with herself over whether to divulge the information they needed.</p><p>\u201cIf you want to protect us, then tell us what we\u2019re dealing with,\u201d Noah cut in.</p><p>She sank back into the chair, slumping in defeat. She looked miserable, and Liam hated that look. Lauren had a beautiful smile. Full of warmth and vibrancy that just made others stop and stare when she laughed. Liam wanted her to smile again, and he\u2019d do anything it took to make that happen.</p><p>\u201cJoel is a pimp,\u201d she said with a visible shudder. \u201cHe\u2019d never call himself that. He\u2019d likely kill anyone for insulting him that way. But it\u2019s what he is. No matter how he sugarcoats it, he\u2019s a glorified pimp.\u201d</p><p>Liam frowned, dread skating up his spine. His stomach went immediately sour and the meal he\u2019d had hours before churned.</p><p>\u201cDid he force you to . . .\u201d He couldn\u2019t even choke the words out but Lauren immediately understood what he was trying to ask.</p><p>Lauren looked up, horrified. \u201cNo! I didn\u2019t work for him. God no. But others did. He called them his girls.\u201d</p><p>Liam immediately looked over at Noah. \u201cSuki,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>Suki had said she was one of his girls, but at the time they hadn\u2019t known what it meant.</p><p>Noah settled back on the love seat and gazed over at Lauren. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you start from the beginning, honey. Tell us everything you know. How you got involved with him. How you know about what he does.\u201d</p><p>For a moment, Liam thought she\u2019d refuse. Her cheeks tightened and her eyes went dull with shame. He reached for her hand, determined that she not feel that way with him and Noah.</p><p>\u201cWe aren\u2019t judging you, Lauren. We just need the facts. Tell us what you know, okay?\u201d</p><p>Whether she intended to or not, she curled her fingers tightly around his, gripping as she glanced back at Noah.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t bore you with the details of my relationship with Joel. Let\u2019s just say that I was forced out of denial when I saw him rough up one of his \u2018girls\u2019 one night. I had no idea he was involved in anything like prostitution. I assumed he was the businessman he professed to be. Legitimate business.\u201d</p><p>Noah frowned. \u201cYou said you saw him rough up a girl. How rough are we talking? Did he kill her?\u201d</p><p>Lauren paled and shook her head. \u201cNo. But he beat her. I mean he was so cold about it. He accused her of pocketing money and holding back on him. He reminded her that she worked for him and that she was nothing without him. He kept going on and on about all he\u2019d done for her and all the girls, and he was pissed that this was the way she repaid him.\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes for a long moment and swallowed visibly. Her hand shook in Liam\u2019s, and this time he was the one to squeeze her fingers, offering her reassurance.</p><p>\u201cHer nose was bleeding. Her lip was split. And Joel was pissed because he\u2019d lost his temper. Her face was a valuable asset. She wouldn\u2019t be on her back doing her job if a man had to put a paper bag over her head. His words, not mine,\u201d she added hastily.</p><p>Noah nodded. \u201cGo on. You\u2019re doing fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen he calmed down and realized what he\u2019d done, he had Ron, the person I thought was his business partner, break three of her fingers. On her left hand, so she could still give a man a hand job. Oh God,\u201d she sobbed. \u201cHe broke fingers on her left hand so it wouldn\u2019t interfere with her pleasuring a man.\u201d</p><p>Liam raised her hand and folded his other one over the back so it was completely encased between his palms. He rubbed gently, silently urging her on.</p><p>\u201cI was so sickened by what I saw, but what hit me the hardest was that I realized that I was that woman. That I\u2019d just been watching a cold-blooded man ruthlessly hurt another woman, and that I\u2019d allowed that and more behind closed doors. No, I didn\u2019t \u2018work\u2019 for him, but I was as solidly under his control as those women were. If I was so outraged on her behalf, then why the hell wasn\u2019t I upset over what I\u2019d allowed him to do to me? I was heartsick. Scared. Angry. So many things. It was like flipping a light switch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened next?\u201d Liam asked quietly.</p><p>\u201cI confronted him.\u201d She broke off laughing a dry, hoarse laugh that made Liam\u2019s chest tight. \u201cLike an idiot, I confronted him. What I should have done was gotten out of there as fast as I could and never look back. But I was so pissed and so ashamed, that I was compelled to confront him. It was as if I had to let him know that I wasn\u2019t that stupid, cowardly woman he\u2019d been pushing around for so long. It was so dumb of me, but I wasn\u2019t thinking logically. I wasn\u2019t smart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that how you got the bruises you had when Max hired us?\u201d Noah asked with a growl.</p><p>She lowered her eyes in shame. \u201cNo, that didn\u2019t come until later. I was so stupid,\u201d she said with a sob. \u201cHe told me that I was nothing but a dumb bitch and that I\u2019d better keep my mouth shut and forget what I saw. I was so afraid of what he might do if I pushed him that I kept silent. And I stayed with him. Even after that. How foolish was that? I lived in constant fear of him, but I didn\u2019t know what to do. So I stayed. At least for a little while. It wasn\u2019t until a short time after that episode that I finally wised up and got out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus,\u201d Noah muttered. \u201cAnd you wouldn\u2019t tell us about him, why?\u201d</p><p>Liam didn\u2019t like the darkness in Lauren\u2019s eyes or the knowledge that whatever pushed her to that final decision must have been bad. He wanted to ask her what the hell the bastard had done to make her finally snap, but now wasn\u2019t the time. She was tortured enough relating what she was. But Liam wouldn\u2019t forget. He\u2019d find out exactly what had happened to push her over the edge. And he knew he damn well wasn\u2019t going to like her answer.</p><p>She sucked in a deep breath, almost as if she were trying to hold on to the last thread of her control. Liam sent Noah a dark look, silently telling him to back off, but Noah\u2019s lips were set into a fine line. He was well and truly pissed off now. Not at Lauren, but at Joel Knight.</p><p>\u201cI heard the things he said to the woman he hurt and to Ron, his enforcer. What I never realized is that Ron is sent in to fix situations so that Joel doesn\u2019t have to get his hands dirty. Except Joel wanted to set an example of this woman. He wanted to scare her, and so he handled it himself. He has cops on his payroll. He didn\u2019t say who. But he taunted the woman with the fact that if she went to the cops, nothing would happen because she was just a whore nobody cared about and he had enough people on his payroll to make any problem go away.\u201d</p><p>Her voice had lowered to a whisper, and a tear slid down her soft cheek. Liam reached up to wipe it away and she flinched away from him. Not in fear, but in shame. It bothered her that she\u2019d cry in front of them.</p><p>Rage made his hand shake and he pulled it away so it wouldn\u2019t upset her more.</p><p>\u201cHe talked about \u2018others\u2019 he\u2019d had taken care of. So I knew when I finally got the courage to call Max for help that I couldn\u2019t tell him the truth. And then he called in you two, and it got so complicated. Max wanted to swear out a warrant. He wanted to punish whoever hurt me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnderstandably so,\u201d Noah said tightly.</p><p>\u201cAnd let Joel murder my brother?\u201d she asked in horror. \u201cOr you and Liam? How is that supposed to make anything better? How would I be able to live with myself knowing that I got one of you killed? I\u2019ve made stupid decisions, but wanting to keep my brother and you two alive isn\u2019t one of them.\u201d</p><p>Liam sighed. There was no way for him and Noah to win this argument or sway her from the belief that she\u2019d done the right thing. He wanted to shake her, but that didn\u2019t solve anything.</p><p>He wanted to ask her why the hell she ever got involved with Knight anyway. What on earth could she possibly have seen in the smarmy asshole?</p><p>Before leaving New York City, they\u2019d pulled Knight\u2019s record. Squeaky-clean. Not even a parking ticket. Which would certainly lend credence to Lauren\u2019s assertion that he had influential people on his payroll.</p><p>He made frequent donations to charity. Hosted political fundraisers, though he never officially allied himself with either the Democratic or Republican Parties. He was more into causes. Causes that elevated his own profile and made him look like the all-American good guy. Hell, looking at his merits, he had all the traits of someone looking to get into politics himself. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And wouldn\u2019t Lauren be one hell of a skeleton in the man\u2019s closet come election time?</p><p>That scared the hell out of Liam. If politics were in this guy\u2019s future, it would give him even more motivation to silence Lauren so she was never a thorn in his side.</p><p>\u201cLauren\u2014\u201d</p><p>Before he could get out what he was going to say, there was a loud knock on the door. Followed by a guy\u2019s bellow.</p> <p>\u201cLauren! Open up. It\u2019s Seth. Are you okay? If you don\u2019t answer in thirty seconds, I\u2019m coming in.\u201d</p><p>Lauren scrambled to her feet. Noah and Liam were instantly on guard. Noah was already reaching for his gun while Lauren made a mad dash for the door.</p><p>She threw it open and before she could say a word, she was yanked out the door and shoved behind a man wearing a policeman\u2019s uniform.</p><p>Gun up in one hand, the other pushing Lauren farther behind him, the cop advanced into the room.</p><p>\u201cPut your weapons down and your hands up where I can see them,\u201d the cop snarled. \u201cDon\u2019t give me any reason to shoot.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSeth, listen to me,\u201d Lauren pleaded. \u201cThey aren\u2019t here to hurt me.\u201d</p><p>Seth held up a hand to silence Lauren.</p><p>\u201cWho the hell are you and what are you doing in Lauren\u2019s apartment? And you better damn well have a permit to carry those guns, otherwise you\u2019ll be spending the night in my jail. If you so much as laid one finger on Lauren, I\u2019ll make sure I lose the damn key.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa, dude, you need to chill out and listen to what Lauren\u2019s trying to tell you,\u201d Noah said, even as he carefully set the gun down on the coffee table.</p><p>\u201cHands up,\u201d Seth barked.</p><p>Noah complied and Liam tossed his weapon onto the floor, then carefully raised his hands up and laced his fingers behind his head.</p> <p>Seth slowly advanced, his gun never lowering and his gaze never moving from Liam and Noah. When he was close enough to get to the weapons Liam and Noah had discarded, he bent carefully and retrieved them. Then he motioned for Liam to move to the couch where Noah stood.</p><p>\u201cSit down. Both of you.\u201d</p><p>Liam blew out an exasperated breath. Damn it, they didn\u2019t have time for this shit.</p><p>Seth backed toward the door where Lauren still stood, wide-eyed, taking it all in.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d Seth asked in a low voice.</p><p>She nodded vigorously. \u201cSeth, they aren\u2019t here to hurt me. Max hired them. I mean before, when I was in New York. He hired them to protect me after what happened. They\u2019ve been investigating and they came because they needed to ask me some questions.\u201d</p><p>Seth glanced back and forth between the two men on the couch and Lauren, almost as if trying to gauge whether Lauren was acting and speaking of her own free will.</p><p>Evidently satisfied that she was, he slowly lowered his weapon and holstered it. He turned back to Lauren. \u201cOne of my deputies reported seeing two badass-looking guys forcing their way into your apartment. He hightailed it into the office to report to me. I told him to call Max, and then I got over here as fast as I could.\u201d</p> <p>Lauren groaned. \u201cDid you have to call Max, Seth? You could have waited to see what was going on before you got him all worked up.\u201d</p><p>Seth\u2019s eyebrow went up. \u201cWe all look out for you, Lauren. Max would kick my ass if I didn\u2019t let him know about this. Besides, if he hired them, then he ought to be happy they\u2019re doing their job.\u201d</p><p>Then he turned to Noah and Liam and held out his hand. \u201cSeth Colter. I\u2019m sheriff here. Lauren is family, and we take family very seriously. We watch out for her.\u201d</p><p>Liam stood and shook Seth\u2019s hand, and then Noah did the same.</p><p>\u201cNo hard feelings,\u201d Noah said mildly. \u201cI\u2019m glad she has plenty of people watching out for her safety. She needs it since she wasn\u2019t exactly truthful about what danger she\u2019s in.\u201d</p><p>Seth frowned and looked back at Lauren. \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d</p><p>Lauren\u2019s face went red and her eyes gleamed with a murderous light.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t think you\u2019re getting off scot-free,\u201d Noah warned. \u201cMax has to know. Seth sure as hell needs to know. He\u2019s the sheriff here and he has responsibility for far too many lives to be kept in the dark.\u201d</p><p>Seth scowled. \u201cSomebody mind telling me what the hell is going on here?\u201d</p><p>Lauren glanced behind her through the still-open door, and when she turned back, her lips were pulled down into an expression of unhappiness</p><p>\u201cYou may as well hold off on any explanation,\u201d she said, displeasure evident in her tone. \u201cMax is here, and he\u2019s going to want to hear everything.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 5</p><p>HOW had everything so quickly spiraled out of control? Lauren wanted to do nothing more than order everyone out of her apartment and bar the door. But she knew that wasn\u2019t going to solve anything.</p><p>It was bad enough she was going to have to explain to her brother that she\u2019d lied to him. But now Noah and Liam were here. In the flesh. In her tiny living room. And she was going to have to confess everything in front of Seth, and while he was family, she was uncomfortable with so many people knowing just how badly she\u2019d screwed up.</p><p>\u201cLauren? Seth?\u201d Max called.</p><p>She could hear the anxiety in his voice, and she squeezed her eyes shut.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Max. Come on up,\u201d Seth called down. \u201cLauren is fine.\u201d</p><p>A few moments later, Max burst into the room, his gaze immediately seeking Lauren out. He went to her and pulled her into his arms. She sighed and absorbed the hug, resting her head against his chest. She was just waiting for the bubble to burst and for reality\u2014and her past\u2014to rudely intrude.</p><p>Max pulled her away, palming her shoulders. Then he glanced beyond her to where Noah and Liam now stood just a few feet away.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Why are you two here? Is Lauren in danger?\u201d</p><p>Liam shot her a look of sympathy. Noah had less mercy, however.</p><p>\u201cLauren lied to us about who hurt her,\u201d Noah said bluntly. \u201cWhen we found out, we came here immediately to question her.\u201d</p><p>Max frowned, and Lauren could see the wheels turning in his head as he grappled with what Noah had just thrown at him. His jaw went tight, a sure sign of anger, and he started forward, but she put her hand on his arm.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t, Max,\u201d she said in a low voice. \u201cI did lie.\u201d</p><p>He jerked his gaze from Noah and Liam, his eyes wide with astonishment. \u201cWhy on earth would you lie? I don\u2019t understand. I saw what you looked like, Lauren. You can\u2019t tell me that son of a bitch didn\u2019t put those bruises on you.\u201d</p><p>Her lips turned down again, and she glanced away, tears stinging the lids of her eyes. But she gulped them back. She wasn\u2019t going to use a dirty trick to get out of this. It was time to own up to what she\u2019d done.</p><p>\u201cShe made up a name and description of someone else,\u201d Liam said.</p><p>He took a step toward Lauren until he was close enough that she could feel the warmth emanating from him. His hand slid up her back and remained between her shoulder blades. No one could see where his hand rested, but she appreciated the show of support more than she could possibly verbalize.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Max demanded.</p><p>Seth frowned and leaned against the doorway that separated the living room from the small kitchen area. \u201cI\u2019m lost.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was afraid,\u201d Liam said quietly. \u201cJoel Knight is the asshole\u2019s name and he\u2019s involved in prostitution. According to Lauren, he has quite a few people on his payroll, including several members of law enforcement.\u201d He sighed hard and glanced sideways at Lauren. \u201cShe was trying to protect you . . . and us.\u201d</p><p>Max stared at Liam for a long moment as if he thought Liam had lost his mind. Then he turned his gaze to Lauren. \u201cIs this true?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cWhat else did you lie about?\u201d Max asked bluntly. \u201cWhat did he do to you, Lauren? You said he hit you. That he slapped and punched you. What else did that son of a bitch do to you? What else haven\u2019t you told me?\u201d</p><p>The blood drained out of her face, and she could no longer meet her brother\u2019s gaze. Liam slid his arm around her, uncaring that Max was mere feet away, and Liam squeezed her shoulders, pulling her underneath his arm until she was flat against him, one shoulder lodged solidly underneath his.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need to have this discussion in front of so many people,\u201d Liam said in a low voice. \u201cLauren\u2019s embarrassed and scared enough as it is.\u201d</p><p>She wanted to hug him and never let go. But at the same time, she was ashamed of the fact she was still hiding, only this time she was hiding behind Liam.</p><p>Max blew out a deep breath and then scrubbed a hand through his hair. \u201cI just want to know what the hell is going on. First question. Is Lauren in any immediate danger? Is this asshole coming after her?\u201d</p><p>Noah held up his hand. \u201cWe have no reason to believe he has any idea where she is. We sure as hell haven\u2019t told anyone. We came because we needed to confirm what our source told us so that we can do some more digging on this guy.\u201d</p><p>Max\u2019s lips tightened. \u201cYou should have contacted me first. You work for me.\u201d</p><p>Liam nodded. \u201cYeah, we do. But we weren\u2019t going to you with the possibility that Lauren had held back information unless we knew that to be true. And the only way to find that out was to ask her.\u201d</p><p>Max looked long and hard at Lauren, and then his gaze softened. \u201cAre you all right? I wish to hell I knew what you were thinking or why you just wouldn\u2019t tell me the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she croaked, and cringed at how easily she lied to her brother now. The truth was she wanted to crawl into a hole and die. But she couldn\u2019t very well say that.</p><p>\u201cWhat do we need to do?\u201d Max directed at Noah and Liam. \u201cAre there any precautions that Lauren needs to take? How likely is this guy to come after her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard to say,\u201d Noah said grimly. \u201cWe need to find out everything we can about him.\u201d</p><p>Lauren trembled against Liam and his grip tightened on her.</p><p>\u201cWe aren\u2019t going to let anything happen to you, Lauren,\u201d Liam murmured.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want her left alone,\u201d Max said sharply. \u201cIs this the sort of thing you can have others do for you?\u201d Then he shook his head. \u201cI think you should move back in with me and Callie, Lauren.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMax, no,\u201d Lauren pleaded. \u201cI like it here. I just got moved in. My job\u2019s just across the street. Clyde is a world away from New York City. You heard Noah. They haven\u2019t told anyone where I am. How on earth would he find me, and who says he even cares what I\u2019m doing now?\u201d</p><p>Max looked torn. Seth was frowning.</p><p>\u201cI hate to upset you, Lauren, but I\u2019m in agreement with Max on this one,\u201d Seth said. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be alone. Especially until we\u2019ve had time to investigate this guy. I\u2019m assuming from your tone that you have no desire to press charges?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head emphatically. \u201cHe\u2019d be out of jail in an hour. He\u2019d never do time. I just want to forget he ever existed. I don\u2019t want to give him any reason to care about me one way or another.\u201d</p><p>Seth didn\u2019t look happy, but he didn\u2019t try to talk her into it.</p><p>\u201cShe won\u2019t be alone,\u201d Noah said. \u201cLiam and I would stick to her until we are absolutely certain this guy poses no threat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want to do, Lauren?\u201d Max asked.</p><p>He was staring hard at Liam\u2019s arm wrapped protectively around her. His gaze swept up and down the bigger man as if trying to figure out what it was he was missing in the big picture.</p><p>Lauren sucked in a breath and then glanced at each of the occupants of the room.</p><p>If she swore off any protection, A) she\u2019d be the world\u2019s biggest dumbass; and B) Max would have her moved back in with him and Callie in an hour flat. So much for asserting any sort of independence.</p><p>\u201cI want to stay here. In my apartment,\u201d she finally said.</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re okay with Noah and Liam shadowing you twenty-four hours a day?\u201d Max asked.</p><p>She snuck a quick glance at Noah. Liam, she was relatively sure of. His hold on her spoke volumes. Noah . . . well, she didn\u2019t know if he was still pissed or if he would be even more so once he got stuck babysitting her on a full-time basis again.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you looking at me that way?\u201d Noah asked, his eyes narrowing.</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s fair to ask you to take on the job of babysitting me again,\u201d she said bluntly. \u201cI lied to you. I made your job more difficult. I wouldn\u2019t blame you if you couldn\u2019t wait to see the back of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about you let me worry about what I consider difficult,\u201d Noah said softly. \u201cWhether you move in with your brother or you stay here in this apartment, you\u2019re stuck with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd me,\u201d Liam interjected.</p><p>\u201cAnd Liam,\u201d Noah agreed. \u201cSo you better just get used to it. Until we know exactly who and what we\u2019re dealing with, you\u2019re going to be tripping over us on a daily basis.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t want any trouble,\u201d Seth said, straightening his stance. \u201cI need to be kept in the loop on everything.

I need to know whatever threat there is because you can damn well bet my wife, mother and sister will be in the thick of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnderstood,\u201d Liam said, his hold never loosening on Lauren. \u201cWe\u2019ll give you whatever information we uncover as soon as we get it. We\u2019ll get some of our people digging immediately and we\u2019ll let everybody know what we come up with.\u201d</p><p>Max looked reluctantly toward the door and then back at Lauren. \u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t want to come home with me?\u201d</p><p>She broke loose from Liam and went to her brother. She hugged him tightly and then leaned up on tiptoe to kiss his cheek. \u201cThank you for worrying about me, and I\u2019m sorry I lied to you, Max. I didn\u2019t know what else to do at the time. I was just scared. But I\u2019m fine now. Promise.\u201d</p> <p>He didn\u2019t look a hundred percent certain, but he nodded anyway. \u201cOkay. I\u2019ll go back home.\u201d Then to Noah and Liam, he said, \u201cI expect a report the minute you find out anything further.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get on out of here too,\u201d Seth said. \u201cKeep me posted. Holler if you sense anything out of the ordinary. Things stay pretty much the same around here. People pay attention when they see new faces in town. Get me a description of Knight. A photo. Any pertinent information on people who work close with him. I\u2019ll distribute it to my deputies so we can all be on the lookout.\u201d</p><p>Liam extended his hand to shake Seth\u2019s. \u201cThanks. We\u2019ll definitely keep you posted.\u201d</p><p>Seth shook Liam\u2019s hand and then nodded at Lauren. \u201cTake care, Lauren.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she managed to get out.</p> <p>Max leaned forward, kissed Lauren on the forehead and then trailed behind Seth out her front door.</p><p>She damn near wilted on the spot as soon as the door closed behind Max. But the look in Noah\u2019s eyes halted her in her tracks.</p><p>Her brow furrowed, she glanced at him in question.</p><p>\u201cNow that they\u2019re gone, we have a hell of a lot else to discuss,\u201d Noah said in a determined voice. \u201cStarting with me. You. And Liam.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 6</p><p>NOAH stared at Lauren\u2019s pale face and for a moment considered backing off. Giving her time and space to deal with the fallout of their arrival. It was obvious she was on shaky ground.</p> <p>But fuck it all. This whole situation was burning a hole in his brain. Liam had already made his move. And if Noah didn\u2019t do some serious catching up, he was going to get left in the dust.</p><p>Liam had said for Noah to come back and see Lauren and then make up his mind. Hell. As soon as he\u2019d laid eyes on her again and saw the shame and vulnerability in her gaze, he knew there was no goddamn way he was walking away from her. And Liam, the bastard, probably knew it.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d Lauren said in a faltering tone.</p><p>When Noah looked at Liam, his friend\u2019s gaze was mocking. Challenging. It made Noah want to wipe the smug smile right off his face.</p><p>\u201cCome sit down,\u201d Liam said, gently herding Lauren to the love seat.</p><p>He settled her down beside him and then glanced expectantly back up at Noah. Noah had no choice but to take the armchair Lauren had sat in earlier.</p><p>Once he was settled and staring at Lauren, who was looking at him, expecting him to say what was on his mind, he struggled to find the words. How the hell was he going to explain this one when he didn\u2019t fully understand it himself?</p><p>Son of a bitch, but he hated this uncertainty. He was a decisive person. He didn\u2019t second-guess himself or his decisions, but he was paralyzed by the enormity of the situation. He and Liam hadn\u2019t even fully come to terms with this . . . whatever the hell it was. How could he be expected to make Lauren understand what he wanted? What Liam obviously wanted.</p> <p>\u201cLauren, will you excuse us for a moment?\u201d Noah said bluntly.</p><p>Liam\u2019s brows drew together, and then Lauren\u2019s brow furrowed in confusion.</p><p>Noah stood and motioned for Liam. \u201cWe\u2019re just going to go across the street.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd leave her?\u201d Liam demanded.</p><p>Noah blew out his breath in frustration. \u201cCome on, Lauren. You\u2019re going with us. We\u2019ll take her into the sheriff\u2019s station.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat on earth is going on?\u201d Lauren asked in bewilderment.</p><p>Her brown eyes were cloudy with confusion, and her mouth opened and shut as she glanced between the two men.</p><p>Liam put his hand over hers. \u201cNoah and I need to work out a few things . . . privately. It won\u2019t take long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut why do I need to leave?\u201d</p><p>Liam touched her cheek. \u201cRemember everything that was just said when your brother was here? That wasn\u2019t just talk, Lauren. For the next while, where we go, you go, and vice versa.\u201d</p><p>She looked as though she wanted to argue, but then she closed her mouth and gave a resigned sigh. \u201cOkay. Let\u2019s go then. Let me get my book so I\u2019ll have something to do. I\u2019m going to feel pretty stupid just sitting in the sheriff\u2019s station.\u201d</p><p>As she walked to her bedroom, Noah leveled a stare at Liam. He was itching to say something. To break the building tension. He was ready to explode, but he didn\u2019t want to have this conversation in front of Lauren. Not until he and Liam hashed this out between them. There were so many ways to fuck this up before they even had a chance with her. And that was assuming that Lauren wouldn\u2019t run screaming in the opposite direction as soon as they leveled with her.</p><p>When Lauren returned, Noah abruptly got up and strode for her front door. Liam brought up the rear, placing Lauren in between the both of them. But then wasn\u2019t this what it was all about? Lauren in between them?</p><p>He was going to need something stronger than the diner served for this occasion.</p><p>Traffic had increased on Main Street. Old pickups making stops at the feed store. Cars pulling into the grocery store at the corner.</p><p>Most noticeably was the crowd at the diner.</p><p>There was no way in hell he was going to have a conversation about Lauren in the middle of a crowded diner.</p><p>He glanced back at Liam and then headed for the sheriff\u2019s station. When he pushed in, there was a woman manning the front desk with the phone surgically attached to her ear. She held up one finger and mouthed I\u2019ll be with you in a second.</p><p>Noah waited patiently for her to finish her call, and then she looked up, a bright smile on her face.</p><p>\u201cHow can I help you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to see Seth Colter,\u201d Noah said.</p><p>He reached behind him, took Lauren\u2019s hand and pulled her up to stand beside him.</p><p>\u201cI need to leave her with the sheriff.\u201d</p><p>The woman blinked, and then her eyes widened. \u201cWhat\u2019s she done, sir?\u201d</p><p>Noah stared at her in confusion. \u201cShe hasn\u2019t done anything. Can you get the sheriff for me?\u201d</p><p>When he glanced sideways at Lauren, he saw her face was beet red, and she looked as though she wanted the floor to swallow her up.</p><p>Hell.</p><p>The awkward moment was saved from growing even more awkward when Seth walked out of his office. He frowned when he saw them and came to a full stop.</p><p>\u201cIs something wrong?\u201d Seth asked. \u201cNoah, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Noah nodded and then shook his head. \u201cNothing\u2019s wrong. We need to leave Lauren with you until we get a few things straightened out.\u201d</p><p>Seth blinked. \u201cHere?\u201d</p><p>Lauren made a strangled sound. \u201cThis is so ridiculous. Let me go to Lily\u2019s. You can drop me off there. I\u2019ll spend the afternoon with her.\u201d</p><p>Seth frowned. \u201cNo, it\u2019s fine. Just caught me off guard. You can sit in my office if you like. If I\u2019m called out, there will be plenty of other people here to keep an eye on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel like a damn criminal,\u201d Lauren muttered.</p><p>Liam leaned over, kissed her temple and then pushed her in Seth\u2019s direction. \u201cWe\u2019ll be back for you in just a bit. Sit tight, okay?\u201d</p><p>She sent an unhappy look in Liam and Noah\u2019s direction before she walked toward Seth. Seth put his hand on her shoulder and guided her back toward his office.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d Noah muttered, heading back out the door.</p><p>Instead of walking toward the diner, he crossed the street back to Lauren\u2019s apartment, leaving Liam to follow. He jogged up the steps and went in, pacing around the living room while Liam closed the door and went to sit on the love seat.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m guessing you\u2019ve made your decision,\u201d Liam drawled.</p><p>Noah stopped pacing and spun around, pinning his friend with a glare. \u201cNo, the hell I haven\u2019t. How am I supposed to make that kind of decision in a split second? Have you even considered the difficulties in what you\u2019re proposing? Have you thought past the fact that you want her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you so pissed off?\u201d Liam asked mildly. \u201cYou didn\u2019t want to talk about it when we could have in New York, when Lauren wasn\u2019t anywhere around. You wanted to wait. Well here we are. So talk.\u201d</p><p>Noah gripped the back of his neck and took in several deep breaths. Then he hunched down in the armchair, shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cThis is some kind of goddamn joke to you, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>At that, Liam surged forward, his eyes darkening with anger. His jaw bulged and Noah realized he\u2019d gone too far. His friend was close to ripping Noah\u2019s head off.</p><p>\u201cLauren isn\u2019t a joke to me,\u201d Liam said through tightly clenched teeth. \u201cYou\u2019re the one with your head up your ass. I was trying to do the right thing. I knew you had feelings for her and you\u2019re my friend. I also know that we can protect and take care of Lauren. Together. I don\u2019t want her to come between us. We\u2019ve been through too much and we have history. Your friendship means a lot, but I\u2019m not going to let you fuck things up for me with Lauren. With or without you, I\u2019m here for the long haul. What you decide is up to you. I shot you straight. I leveled with you. I gave you time to think it over.\u201d</p><p>Noah stared at him in astonishment. \u201cAll bullshit aside, you really think this can work? You really think that just because people she knows are in a nontraditional relationship that she\u2019ll be all okay with it for herself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf we can\u2019t decide between us that it\u2019ll work, we\u2019ll never convince her that it will,\u201d Liam said quietly. \u201cMaybe it won\u2019t. But how will we know unless we try? She does it for me, man. I can\u2019t explain it. I\u2019ve heard all kinds of stories about how when a man sees a woman he just knows she\u2019s it. But I\u2019ve never experienced it until now. I\u2019ve met plenty of women that I was interested in. That I was attracted to. Women I enjoyed spending time with and having sex with. But I\u2019ve never met a woman who I\u2019ve had a more powerful reaction to than Lauren. I can\u2019t even describe to you what I felt when I saw her the first time. I wanted to go find the asshole who hurt her and take him apart. And then I wanted to take her in my arms and swear to her that nothing bad would ever touch her again, and that I\u2019d spend the rest of my life making sure she was happy. Now if that sounds stupid to you, so be it, but it was like that for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not stupid,\u201d Noah murmured. \u201cIt\u2019s not stupid because it\u2019s the same way I felt. Even when I told myself I was being ridiculous.\u201d</p><p>Liam nodded. \u201cNow you tell me this. With you having that strong of a reaction, are you really contemplating stepping aside?\u201d Then his eyes narrowed and he stared hard at Noah. \u201cUnless you\u2019re expecting me to.\u201d</p><p>He leaned forward on the couch, his expression suddenly dark and formidable.</p><p>\u201cNot this one, Noah,\u201d he said tersely. \u201cI\u2019ve stepped aside before when I knew you were interested in the same woman I had my eye on. But I didn\u2019t feel this way about them. I\u2019ve never felt so strongly about a woman that I\u2019d risk our friendship over, but I\u2019m telling you right now, I\u2019m not bowing out, and if you can\u2019t or won\u2019t accept what I\u2019m proposing, that\u2019s fine. But don\u2019t expect me to sit back and watch you and Lauren together.\u201d</p><p>Noah knew he had to find a way to defuse a potentially explosive situation. Liam was getting worked up, and if he wasn\u2019t careful, the entire thing would blow up in Noah\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cJust tell me this, Liam. Do you really think this can work? Forget the bullshit about not wanting to step aside. Put away your emotional reaction and think about this logically. Do you honestly think we can share the same woman without getting jealous or too demanding or getting pissed when things don\u2019t go our way?\u201d</p><p>Liam pursed his lips and then slowly nodded. \u201cYeah, I do. I can only speak for me, but I\u2019m willing to do whatever it takes to make it work. Can you say the same? I\u2019m not going into this with a hidden agenda. I\u2019ve put my cards on the table. I can\u2019t be any more blunt than I\u2019ve been. But so far I\u2019ve been the one doing all the talking.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>If anyone else were questioning him the way Liam was, the fight would already be on. But Liam knew him. Liam was the closest thing Noah had to a family. Hell, Liam\u2019s family had all but adopted Noah when he was just a teenager.</p><p>He\u2019d spent more time in the Prescott household than he had his own, and by the time he was sixteen, he\u2019d moved in and the Prescotts had pursued legal custody through the courts. Noah\u2019s mother hadn\u2019t even bothered to show up.</p><p>The two boys had graduated from high school together. They\u2019d joined the military together, and even though the Army had taken them in separate directions, they\u2019d always stayed in touch. Noah had spent his leave time with the Prescotts, and one Christmas, he\u2019d spent with them when Liam hadn\u2019t gotten leave.</p><p>\u201cWhat about your folks?\u201d Noah asked grimly. \u201cHow are they going to take this?\u201d</p> <p>Liam shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m sure they\u2019ll wonder if we\u2019ve lost our minds. But they\u2019ll love Lauren. Mom will love her and so will Dad. I think, as with anything, they\u2019ll just need time to adjust. When the time comes, we\u2019ll take her to meet them and we\u2019ll explain the situation. They aren\u2019t going to disown us over it, Noah. You know them better than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just don\u2019t want to hurt them,\u201d Noah said. \u201cThey\u2019ve done too much for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand that. But you\u2019re not giving them enough credit. They just want us to be happy. If Lauren makes us happy and you and I are at peace with it, then everything else will fall into place.\u201d</p><p>Noah shook his head. \u201cYou\u2019re disgustingly levelheaded about this whole thing. I\u2019m usually the one having to talk you around on things.\u201d</p><p>Liam shrugged. \u201cI know what I want, and I\u2019m willing to do whatever is necessary to get it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOkay then we give it a try. I don\u2019t even know where the hell to start.\u201d</p><p>Liam laid his forearms across his knees and stared intently at Noah. \u201cWe start by being honest with Lauren about what we want, and then we ask her what she wants.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 7</p><p>AFTER reading the same paragraph five times, Lauren gave up on trying to enjoy the book she\u2019d taken with her into Seth\u2019s office. Seth was in and out and thankfully hadn\u2019t tried to engage her in conversation. He was kept busy with various calls, but it was one from his wife, Lily, that made Lauren\u2019s heart melt.</p><p>It was so obvious how adored Lily Colter was. By all three of the men she called husband. Seth\u2019s entire face lit up when he realized it was her on the phone, and his eyes had grown so soft with love that Lauren found it hard to watch.</p><p>They\u2019d spoken about the baby and how Lily was feeling. Evidently Dillon was home with Lily and it was also obvious that Seth would rather be there instead of stuck in his office. Babysitting Lauren.</p> <p>It had made Lauren uncomfortable because she felt as though she was intruding on something private and deeply emotional.</p><p>She turned away to stare out the window, wondering when Noah and Liam would return and what was so important that they\u2019d had to dump her so they could speak privately. Noah had acted strangely ever since the two had arrived while Liam had acted . . . like he cared about her. Or maybe it was wishful thinking on her part.</p><p>She\u2019d never wished for anything as much as she wished she could go back and redo the past year. So much of her time had been spent lamenting the choices she\u2019d made, but she\u2019d compounded bad decision making with yet more bad decisions. Would it ever end for her?</p><p>There was more she hadn\u2019t told Noah and Liam. Or Max. Or anyone else. But she knew the moment she gave up her secret that she\u2019d be forced to act on it, and she wasn\u2019t ready to face her past. Maybe she\u2019d never be ready.</p><p>She was a coward. She readily admitted that. But in no way did she ever want to see Joel again, and were she to confess to anyone what she\u2019d taken away when she ran from Joel and begged her brother for help, there would be no way around having to face him.</p><p>Just the thought was enough to strike fear in her heart and send a chill down her spine. She shivered and rubbed her arms.</p><p>\u201cAre you cold?\u201d</p><p>Seth\u2019s question jerked her from her thoughts. She yanked her head up to see that he\u2019d returned to his office again and was staring at her.</p> <p>She stilled her hands so they rested on her arms, and shook her head. \u201cNo, I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>He took a seat behind his desk and riffled through a stack of papers, evidently finding what he was looking for. He sat back, studying it for a long moment, and then he glanced her way again.</p><p>Then he put the paper down and leaned forward so his forearms rested on his desk.</p><p>\u201cYou know if you ever need help, with anything, that you only have to ask.\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>Seth hesitated a moment, fiddled with a pen on his desk and then looked back at her again, as if he was trying to figure out the best way to broach the subject he wanted to discuss.</p><p>\u201cNoah and Liam . . . are these guys you\u2019re comfortable with? I can talk to Max. We can work out something else if you\u2019d rather they go back to New York.\u201d</p><p>She surged forward. \u201cNo! I mean no, it\u2019s okay, they\u2019re fine, I mean. It\u2019s just that I was caught off guard. But really, they\u2019ve been great. They were so sweet to me right after . . . you know, when what happened happened. Thank you, though. I appreciate what you and all your family have done for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re family, Lauren. And the Colters always look after family.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cI know. It\u2019s one of the things I love the most about all of you. Max and I didn\u2019t have that. I mean, we did, but it was just us and Mom for so long, and then we lost her. I was in awe of all of you when I first came here. To have such a large, close-knit family is pretty special.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a part of that now,\u201d Seth said. \u201cDon\u2019t forget that.\u201d</p><p>Warmth filled her heart. It felt good to be a part of something as loving and wonderful as the Colter family.</p><p>Seth glanced toward the door and then turned back to her. \u201cLooks like Noah and Liam are back for you. They\u2019re out front. Come on, I\u2019ll walk you up.\u201d</p><p>She stood. \u201cNo need. Thanks for letting me stay and I\u2019m sorry to be such a bother. Please give Lily my love and tell her I\u2019ll see her when I can. I\u2019m not sure how much freedom I\u2019m going to have going forward,\u201d she added ruefully.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll make it happen. She enjoys spending time with you and Callie. She won\u2019t be able to go that long without getting together with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks again. See you later,\u201d she said as she exited his office.</p><p>Down the hall she saw Noah and Liam standing in the small reception area. They looked relieved when they saw her. Where did they think she\u2019d go?</p><p>Noah reached for her hand as soon as she got close enough. To her surprise, he laced his fingers through hers, squeezed and then pulled her toward the door.</p><p>Liam followed them across the street, and Noah never let loose as they climbed the steps to her apartment. When he pushed inside, he kept ahold of her hand and led her to the love seat.</p><p>He seemed nervous. Ill at ease. Even Liam looked a little . . . unsure.</p><p>\u201cIs something wrong?\u201d she blurted. \u201cYou both look worried. Is it Joel?\u201d</p><p>Liam got up, shoved her coffee table out of the way and dropped down onto one knee in front of her.</p><p>\u201cNo, baby. I don\u2019t want you to worry about Joel, okay? We\u2019re going to do everything in our power to make sure you never have to see him again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe wanted to talk to you about something personal,\u201d Noah said.</p><p>Her gaze swung to him and her heart began to race. She licked her lips nervously because she knew that whatever they wanted to discuss was going to be . . . huge. It was there to read in their expressions. They were focused intently. On her. Like she was the most important person in the world.</p><p>\u201cO-okay,\u201d she breathed out.</p><p>Liam slid his big hand over hers, warm and soothing. Noah took her other hand and turned it palm up, his finger tracing the lines to her fingers.</p><p>\u201cThe thing is . . .\u201d He trailed off then ran his free hand over his head. \u201cHell, I\u2019m making a total mess of this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it, Noah?\u201d she asked softly.</p><p>\u201cDo you have feelings for us?\u201d Liam asked bluntly. \u201cOr are we way off base here.\u201d</p><p>Heat seeped into her cheeks and she was mortified. Had she been so transparent? She\u2019d tried her best to be indifferent toward them. She hadn\u2019t even truly sorted out what she felt for them. They intrigued her. She\u2019d allowed herself to fall into the fantasy that she wasn\u2019t just a job to them, that their protection came not from their job description, but from a need that sprang from their attraction to her.</p><p>She\u2019d gone back and forth with herself over whether she was genuinely attracted to two men or whether it was just a product of going from a man who abused her to men who treated her like she was . . . special. Like she meant something to them, and that they genuinely cared about her. Wouldn\u2019t any woman fall for a man in the same situation? But did it make her feelings real?</p><p>Noah reached up to softly caress her cheek. \u201cPlease don\u2019t be embarrassed by the question. We wanted\u2014needed\u2014to know because we have feelings for you, Lauren. And before we can proceed, we need to know if those feelings are returned.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed hard, her pulse thundering in her temples. \u201cYou both have feelings for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, we do,\u201d Liam said in that same matter-of-fact tone.</p><p>She licked her lips, and suddenly Liam was there, his mouth covering hers in a heated rush. For a moment she had no idea what to do, but then she found herself responding, returning his kiss, opening her mouth to the thrust of his tongue.</p><p>There was nothing perfunctory about the kiss. She loved the roughness, how unsteady and eager he seemed. Almost like he was doing everything he could to hold himself in check. Joel had rarely kissed her, and when he had, it felt more like a punishment than a gesture of affection.</p><p>When he pulled away, his breath hiccupped over his lips and his eyes glowed warm and dark. He smoothed a thumb over the fullness of her bottom lip, now swollen from his kiss.</p><p>\u201cI could so easily fall in love with you,\u201d he said in a near whisper.</p><p>Her heart clenched and she soaked in the words like a parched desert soaking up rain.</p><p>Noah made a sound and she jerked toward him, suddenly numb with guilt. He immediately shook his head.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t look at me like that, sweetheart. You have nothing to feel guilty over. This is what we want to talk to you about. The thing is, we both care about you. We both want to see where our relationship will take us. But we have to make sure you\u2019re on board for something like that. Plus, this isn\u2019t the most ideal time to embark on any relationship, much less one with our particular elements. Our first priority has to be keeping you safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want to have the sort of relationship that the Colters have,\u201d she said, her mind whirling with the implications.</p><p>She\u2019d known of the \u201cdifferent\u201d marriage that Holly and Lily Colter had with each of their three husbands even before she\u2019d ever met them. She\u2019d learned of it from Max. She\u2019d known what to expect, so when she\u2019d witnessed firsthand the bond between the women and their husbands, she hadn\u2019t been taken aback.</p><p>No, she wasn\u2019t shocked. She\u2019d been curious and more than a little envious because it was so obvious that the Colter men adored their wives. She\u2019d often wondered what it would be like to be the center of such a relationship, the very heart and the core in which the arrangement was centered on.</p><p>Never in a million years would she have dreamed that such a relationship would find her.</p><p>Noah nodded. Liam squeezed her hand.</p><p>\u201cWould you even consider such an arrangement?\u201d Liam asked. \u201cI know we\u2019re asking for a lot. We\u2019re nowhere near the permanent commitment stage. We haven\u2019t even had what qualifies as a date. All we want is a chance. We want to open your mind to the possibility and see where it takes us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is a lot to take in,\u201d she murmured. \u201cI had no idea. I mean that you returned my interest.\u201d</p><p>Noah\u2019s eyes gleamed in sudden triumph. \u201cSo you are attracted to us.\u201d</p><p>Her cheeks flamed, but she nodded. They\u2019d given her the truth, and while she\u2019d certainly started their acquaintance with lies, she didn\u2019t want to continue that path.</p><p>Liam leaned in and kissed her again. Long and sweet until she was breathless. This time she slid her hand around the back of his neck and buried her fingers in his long hair. He groaned against her mouth and then pulled back, his eyes blazing.</p><p>\u201cIf I had my way, we\u2019d bypass the dating stage altogether and I\u2019d have you in my bed every damn night.\u201d</p><p>She gaped at his bluntness and nearly glanced in Noah\u2019s direction, but remembering his admonishment the last time she\u2019d looked his way to gauge his reaction, she forced herself not to peek at him.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll take things slow,\u201d Noah said. \u201cWe\u2019ll go whatever pace you need, Lauren. You\u2019ll take the lead and we\u2019ll do whatever we need to for you to be comfortable. We want this to work.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she said in a shaky voice.</p><p>Noah touched his finger to her cheekbone and ran it down to her jaw and then over to trace a line around her mouth.</p><p>\u201cI want very much to kiss you,\u201d he said huskily.</p><p>\u201cThen kiss me,\u201d she whispered.</p> <p>He leaned in, slowly, angling his head so their mouths aligned. And then he pressed his lips to hers. Lightly at first. Then he deepened the kiss, tentatively seeking entrance with his tongue.</p><p>It was sweet and slow, like the first kiss between lovers. A kiss to be remembered for the way it made her feel when things were all shiny and new and emotions were still running high.</p><p>His hand fell to the side of her neck and then, as she\u2019d done to Liam, his hand crept upward, into her hair.</p><p>He broke away but rested his forehead against hers, his chest heaving as he rested there a moment, their mouths so very close.</p><p>\u201cI want this,\u201d he whispered. \u201cI didn\u2019t think I did, but God, I want this, Lauren. I want you, and I\u2019ll make any sacrifice for this to work.\u201d</p> <p>His words opened a part of her soul that hadn\u2019t been previously opened. He and Liam had reached a part of her she\u2019d closed off, a protective measure so that Joel couldn\u2019t reach the very core of her and damage it.</p><p>It was scary and exhilarating all at the same time to open up and allow herself to trust again. But mostly it terrified her because she knew she hadn\u2019t made good decisions in the past. How was she supposed to know if she was making the right ones now?</p><p>Chapter 8</p><p>LAUREN sat between Noah and Liam at her small dinette set that accommodated four people. Four normal-sized people. Noah and Liam weren\u2019t exactly normal sized. They made her apartment seem overstuffed and crowded, where before she\u2019d relished the warm, cozy feel of it.</p><p>They\u2019d ordered dinner from Dillon Colter\u2019s pub, and Liam had gone out to get it, leaving Lauren and Noah alone for a time in the apartment.</p><p>Lauren still wasn\u2019t sure of herself in this strange, new environment she existed in, so she\u2019d excused herself to take a shower and get into more comfortable clothing for lounging. By the time she\u2019d returned, Liam was back with the food, and she\u2019d sighed in relief.</p> <p>\u201cI meant what I said before,\u201d Noah said around a bite of steak.</p><p>Lauren raised her eyebrows. \u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout not letting our relationship interfere with our primary objective, which is keeping you safe and finding out any and all information we can uncover on Joel Knight. As discreetly as possible.\u201d</p><p>She lowered her head and picked at her food.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do that, honey,\u201d Noah said softly. \u201cStop beating yourself up over him. Put the bastard in the past where he belongs. It\u2019s time to move forward. With me and Liam. And we\u2019re damn sure never going to give you reason to believe that we\u2019re anything like that asshole. Don\u2019t give him that kind of power over you.\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cI know. Logically I do. I\u2019m smart enough to know that he can\u2019t control me anymore. But it\u2019s hard to shake that off, you know? When I think of what I allowed him to turn me into, I\u2019m so ashamed, I can barely stand it. I\u2019m supposed to be smarter than that, and I never saw him for what he was until it was nearly too late.\u201d</p><p>The phone rang, interrupting the conversation. Lauren walked over to where her cell phone was charging and quickly unplugged it.</p><p>\u201cHey Max,\u201d she greeted.</p> <p>\u201cHow are things with you?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cFine. We\u2019re just enjoying a quiet dinner in the apartment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good. I wanted to make sure you were still comfortable with the arrangements. I can always do something different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re too good to me, Max. But I\u2019m fine. I promise. I\u2019m going to be okay this time. I\u2019ve learned from my past mistakes. I don\u2019t want to make them again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re too hard on yourself,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cWe all make mistakes, Lauren. I fucked up royally with Callie. Not once, but twice.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cYou sure did. It\u2019s a wonder she took you back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was lucky,\u201d he said in a somber tone. \u201cI didn\u2019t deserve the second chances she gave me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe loves you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I love her. And speaking of Callie and her family. Holly wants you to come to dinner tomorrow and bring Noah and Liam with you. You know Mama C. She gets all nervous about her chicks, and you are definitely one of them now. She wants to eyeball these two men herself before she signs her approval to the whole plan.\u201d</p><p>Lauren chuckled. \u201cThat sounds exactly like her. I\u2019d love to come. It\u2019s been a few days since I\u2019ve seen her, and right now I could use her company.\u201d And her wisdom and insight. There was nothing more that Lauren wanted to do than run to her with the situation she\u2019d found herself in. Of all people, Holly would understand. She\u2019d been a rock during the time that Lily was finding her way with Holly\u2019s three sons. Always offering wisdom and advice. Maybe she could help Lauren sort out how she was going to make a relationship with two very demanding alpha men work.</p><p>After all, she was married to three of the most demanding alpha men on earth. Adam, Ethan and Ryan Colter. It had certainly been passed onto their three sons and to an extent their only daughter, Callie.</p><p>Callie was strong-willed, independent and had been raised by a houseful of overprotective men who thought nothing of spoiling the women they loved completely rotten.</p><p>Just thinking of the Colters made Lauren wistful.</p><p>Hope crowded in as she peeked up at Liam and Noah, who were enjoying the takeout from the Mountain Pass Bar and Grill.</p><p>Here was her shot at a relationship that mimicked the ones the Colters had. She had two very protective badass men determined to keep her safe from anything that threatened her. And they wanted a chance to make a relationship work between the three of them.</p><p>\u201cThen we\u2019ll see you tomorrow?\u201d Max asked.</p><p>\u201cHang on just a moment. Let me ask Liam and Noah what they think.\u201d</p><p>She had pulled the phone away from her ear and had started to ask permission, of all things, when it dawned on her what she was doing. She was acting as though she were with Joel. Always needing his approval for everything she did. She no longer had to do that. She made her own decisions. If she wanted to go visit with the Colters, then Noah and Liam could either come or stay behind. But she wanted to go.</p><p>With a quick frown, she pulled the phone up to her ear again, ignoring the raised eyebrows of Noah and Liam.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be there. I\u2019ll text Holly to let her know to expect us.\u201d</p><p>She ended the call, angry with herself for being such a damn wuss.</p><p>\u201cAny particular reason you look mad at the world?\u201d Noah asked mildly when she returned to the table.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m disgusted with myself,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Liam demanded.</p><p>\u201cBecause I told my brother I was going to ask you if I could go, like I need your permission or something. It\u2019s absolutely what I would have done when I was with Joel. I did nothing without his say so. I didn\u2019t even go to the bathroom without telling him what I was doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d Noah said carefully. \u201cBut Lauren, you do see the difference here, don\u2019t you? We care about what happens to you. We care that there\u2019s a threat out there that\u2019s as of yet unresolved. We\u2019d never stop you from doing something you wanted to do. Unless it was determined that the risk was too great. I need you to understand that now so that if the time ever comes that we shut you down, it won\u2019t be because we\u2019re controlling dickheads. It\u2019ll be because your safety comes first, and we\u2019d much rather have you alive and pissed off than dead and appeased.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand. I do. Just give me time, Noah. This is all very new to me. I wish I could just let go of the past and resolve to not let it affect me so much now. But it\u2019s not that easy. God, I wish it were. I\u2019d give anything to be able to wipe him from my memory and go on like he never existed. But it\u2019s like he\u2019s there, a shadow in my mind, and he pops out at the most inopportune times. He makes me doubt myself, and I hate that most of all.\u201d</p><p>Liam\u2019s eyes softened and he reached over to squeeze her hand. \u201cI get it, baby. I do. Cut yourself some slack. You\u2019ll get there, and Noah and I will be helping you every step of the way.\u201d</p><p>She smiled tremulously. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I take it we\u2019re going out tomorrow?\u201d Noah said. \u201cI just need to know details so I can plan accordingly.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cYes, up the mountain to where the older Colters live. Seth\u2019s parents. Callie and Max live just across the meadow from them. Seth and his brothers and their wife, Lily, live closer to town, but their home is still out of the way and secluded. It\u2019s very beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re very beautiful,\u201d Liam said, his voice gruff and husky.</p><p>Befuddled by the abrupt change in direction, she went silent, not knowing how to respond.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not used to compliments, are you?\u201d Noah asked. \u201cDid the bastard never tell you that you were beautiful? Wait. Don\u2019t answer that. I\u2019m sorry I brought him up.\u201d</p><p>Lauren slowly shook her head. \u201cIn the beginning he did. I mean he said and did all the right things when we first met. But they were just . . . words. He didn\u2019t mean them. It was all very perfunctory. The way he kissed me. The way he touched me. Looking back, I have no idea why he even bothered. It was obvious he wasn\u2019t attracted to me. Physically I mean. Or emotionally for that matter. It was like I was a thing to him.\u201d</p><p>A low growl emanated from Liam\u2019s throat.</p><p>\u201cFor men like him it\u2019s about control. Not how attracted he is to you. It\u2019s about having someone he can control. It\u2019s a high. It makes him feel powerful,\u201d Noah said grimly.</p><p>\u201cAnd I was such an easy mark,\u201d Lauren said sadly.</p><p>Liam ran his hand over her face, brushing his thumb in a gentle caress over her cheekbone. \u201cHe played you, Lauren. He sold you something you wanted by pretending he cared. It\u2019s not a crime to want someone to love you or to be in love or to want a relationship. Isn\u2019t it what we all want at the end of the day?\u201d</p><p>She reached for his hand and leaned her head further into his hold. For a moment she closed her eyes, savoring the contact. There was nothing threatening in Liam\u2019s touch. He was so very careful with her.</p><p>She brushed her cheek along his palm as she raised her gaze to meet his. \u201cAnd why do you want me?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He frowned, his eyes darkening. He looked . . . angry.</p><p>She withdrew immediately, wary of his body language. It was automatic for her to stiffen her posture and put her hands down in her lap, averting her gaze.</p><p>Beside her she heard Noah curse, and she flinched, closing her eyes as she waited for the impending outburst.</p><p>When she felt the hand on her skin, it was instinctive to shrink away and make herself a smaller target. It shocked her. Logically, she was denying that either of these men would hurt her, but it was as if her mind was paying no heed to what she knew. It only knew that she had to protect herself.</p><p>But the hand slid soothingly over her shoulder, up and down, the touch so light it could only be his fingertips.</p><p>\u201cLauren, look at me please,\u201d Liam said hoarsely.</p><p>Slowly she raised her head until she met his tortured gaze. There was pain in his eyes and so much regret.</p><p>Noah scooted his chair over and carefully reached into her lap where her fingers were tightly laced. He gently pried them apart and lifted her hand, pulling it to his mouth. She was visibly shaking, and she hated having such weakness so evident.</p><p>\u201cBaby,\u201d Liam said softly. \u201cListen to me, okay? I have so much to say right now and I\u2019m fighting a hell of a lot of conflicting emotions, so be patient with me. The first thing you need to know is that I will never hurt you. Do you understand that? I don\u2019t expect you to believe it right away, but I want you to file it away in your mind and I want you to pull it out every time you get afraid. I will never, ever, hurt you physically. I can\u2019t promise that I won\u2019t fuck up and hurt you emotionally. Believe me when I say it\u2019s the very last thing I want to do, but I\u2019m a guy, and we do stupid shit. We say stupid shit. I don\u2019t always think before I speak. That\u2019s going to happen, okay? But you have nothing to fear from me physically.\u201d She gave a jerky nod.</p><p>\u201cThe second thing you need to know is that I don\u2019t have a grand explanation for why you do it for me. But I knew from the moment I met you that I was gone in a pretty serious way. You were different from the other women I\u2019ve been involved with. Not different in a bad way, but in a very, very good way. You filled the void that was left by my other relationships. I can only explain it by saying that it was like finding a missing piece to a puzzle. You fit. I hope to hell we fit. I hope this isn\u2019t one-sided, and I\u2019m willing to play a little dirty and try my best to convince you that I\u2019m someone you need. I want you to depend on me, and not in a fucked-up way like Joel wanted you to depend on him. This isn\u2019t about control. I just want you to know that you can count on me. For anything. And that good or bad, I\u2019m in it for the long haul. I can\u2019t be any more blunt than that.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Noah remained silent, but his hold on her hand never loosened. He continued to press tiny kisses to her fingers, and he gradually opened her palm and pressed his mouth to her open hand.</p><p>\u201cYou reacted to my anger,\u201d Liam continued. \u201cI can\u2019t promise never to get angry. It was like a kick in the balls to watch you with those big brown eyes look at me and ask why on earth I would want you, as if you were somehow unworthy. God, Lauren. Unworthy? Noah and I are just hoping like hell to prove ourselves worthy of you. I\u2019m not mad at you, baby. I\u2019m mad at the son of a bitch who has made you question yourself as a woman.\u201d</p><p>Tears stung her eyelids, and she turned her head but found herself staring into Noah\u2019s eyes. There was no escape from them.</p><p>Noah leaned forward and tenderly kissed the corner of her eye where a tear had escaped.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t cry, sweetheart. Liam\u2019s usually not so damn eloquent, but in this case, I couldn\u2019t have said it better myself. We want you to relax. It\u2019s not going to be easy as we fumble and feel our way around a very delicate relationship. I have no experience in this kind of arrangement. Neither does Liam. We just both want to make you happy, and we want you to eventually be able to trust us. Everything else will work itself out. We\u2019ll take it one step at a time and figure it out as we go.\u201d</p><p>She nodded and then impulsively wrapped her arms around Noah\u2019s neck, hugging him tightly.</p><p>Noah felt her go tense against him. She went so still, he was sure she was holding her breath. Waiting. For what? Did she expect a reprimand? Fuck that.</p><p>He wrapped his arms around her and hauled her into his lap, hugging her fiercely. He kissed the top of her silky hair and she gradually relaxed in his arms, melting sweetly against him.</p><p>\u201cHe never was affectionate with me,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI hated that. I hated what I became. I\u2019ve always been a demonstrative person, and he took that away. He hated for me to touch him.\u201d</p> <p>Noah\u2019s lips tightened as he met Liam\u2019s surly gaze across the table. God, he wanted to kick Joel Knight\u2019s ass. Men like him didn\u2019t deserve to breathe.</p><p>Carefully he pulled Lauren away and pushed the hair from her face.</p><p>\u201cYou can touch me anytime you feel like it, sweetheart. I guarantee I won\u2019t complain. And you can bet that I\u2019m going to want to touch you often. I won\u2019t be able to resist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome here, Lauren,\u201d Liam said.</p><p>Noah kissed her temple and then helped her to her feet so she could walk around the table to Liam.</p><p>Liam opened his arms and she went willingly, and soon Liam had her nestled on his lap, his arms snugly around her. She cuddled into his embrace like a kitten seeking warmth, and Noah realized that what she needed most was comfort. She was starved for the things that most people took for granted. Affection. Tenderness.</p> <p>Love.</p><p>\u201cAnytime you want a hug, you come to me,\u201d Liam said gruffly. \u201cI\u2019d happily spend all damn night holding you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make mistakes,\u201d Lauren said painfully. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to have a normal relationship, but I want to learn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to make mistakes too, Lauren. We\u2019ll just be patient with each other,\u201d Noah said.</p><p>She straightened in Liam\u2019s lap and looked directly into Noah\u2019s eyes, her expression fierce and determined.</p><p>\u201cI want this,\u201d she said in a rush, almost as if she\u2019d been afraid to admit it before. \u201cI want it more than I can say. I\u2019m just so afraid of screwing up.\u201d</p><p>Noah\u2019s heart melted. If there had been any lingering doubt on his part about the viability of entering a relationship that involved sharing a woman with his best friend, it was swiftly removed as he stared into Lauren\u2019s eyes.</p><p>She was starkly vulnerable. She was afraid and she was still beaten down by a man whose hold on her had yet to be fully broken. But he saw hope in her eyes. He saw fierce determination to make things work between the three of them.</p> <p>If she could take such a huge step and put her trust in him and Liam, then he could certainly do the same.</p><p>It was time to stop overthinking all the what-ifs and maybes and focus on the only thing he could control. His contribution.</p><p>\u201cI want this too,\u201d Noah said honestly.</p><p>There was relief in Liam\u2019s eyes, and his hold tightened around Lauren.</p><p>Liam\u2019s gaze met and held with Noah\u2019s as silent understanding passed between them.</p><p>For better or worse, they were in this together.</p><p>Chapter 9</p><p>WHEN Noah and Liam had inserted themselves into Lauren\u2019s life\u2014and apartment\u2014they obviously hadn\u2019t given a lot of thought to sleeping arrangements. The one bedroom was tiny, and Lauren had a daybed instead of a regular bed. There was barely room for the small chest of drawers she\u2019d crammed into the room so she\u2019d have a place for her clothing.</p><p>The men certainly weren\u2019t going to fit on the love seat, so after much discussion, Liam went down the street to buy sleeping bags at the sporting goods store.</p><p>It was decided that one of them would sleep in the living room, and since there wasn\u2019t room for two sleeping bags unless they moved furniture out, the other would roll out his sleeping bag on the floor directly below where Lauren slept on the daybed.</p><p>She felt guilty until she remembered that she hadn\u2019t asked for this, and yes, they were helping her. They were protecting her. She was extremely grateful. But there was no definite timeline on how long they would need to shadow her every movement. If she knew it was only for a few days or even a week or so, she would be willing to move to a hotel or consider other accommodations, but it could be much longer. She had a job. It was a job she liked and one she couldn\u2019t afford to lose.</p><p>Sure, Max would help her. She wouldn\u2019t even have to ask. But it was important to her that she stand on her own two feet and stop relying on her big brother to bail her out of trouble.</p><p>He was married now. He had Callie. It wasn\u2019t fair to saddle him with the responsibility of his younger sister when he should be focused on his new family.</p><p>The men decided to alternate nights in her bedroom, and Liam claimed the first night. Lauren felt ridiculously nervous about having him in her bedroom, but he acted as though it was an ordinary occurrence.</p><p>He paid her no attention when she went into the bathroom to change into pajamas, brush her teeth and brush her hair. She spent longer than necessary and then realized he or Noah would likely need to use the bathroom before they went to bed.</p><p>But when she reentered her bedroom, Liam was already in his sleeping bag, one of the cushions from the couch tucked underneath his head.</p><p>At first she thought he was already asleep, but when she turned off the light and began to make her way toward the bed, he said, \u201cBe careful. Don\u2019t fall.\u201d</p><p>She stepped over him and then crawled onto the bed. He\u2019d pulled back the covers for her. The sweetness of the gesture made her want to hug him. It was a simple thing, but it showed his thoughtfulness and his determination to make her comfortable.</p><p>She settled underneath the covers and turned on her side, edging closer to the outside so she could peer over at Liam on the floor.</p><p>\u201cLiam?\u201d she called softly. \u201cYou still awake?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, baby. You okay?\u201d</p><p>She smiled at the soft endearment and the concern in his voice. It was nice having someone other than family care about her. It filled a void that had long been empty.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m fine. I just wanted to say thank you.\u201d</p><p>There was a rustle and movement and suddenly Liam was staring her in the eye. He\u2019d pushed up and leaned in close until their faces were just inches apart.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t thank me for protecting someone I care about. I don\u2019t give a damn about your brother hiring us. That\u2019s not why we\u2019re here. He could fire us tomorrow and we\u2019d still be right here. With you. We aren\u2019t going anywhere.\u201d</p><p>She lifted her head, shifting so she could rest it in her palm, her elbow dug into the mattress.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t going to thank you for protecting me, though I am grateful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what were you thanking me for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor being so patient and understanding. For knowing all the right things to say to ease my fears. I know they\u2019re irrational, but you never got annoyed. I\u2019m still taking it all in. That you and Noah both care about me when I was already struggling to understand the feelings I had for both of you.\u201d</p><p>Liam got to his knees and propped his arms on the mattress just in front of her. He rested his chin so their noses were nearly touching, and then he pushed forward, the barest of inches, and brushed his lips across hers.</p><p>She could barely make out in the dim light that shone from the streetlights through her window that Liam was shirtless. She wished there were more light, because she wanted to see if he had more tattoos or how far up his arms the sleeves extended.</p><p>Who was she kidding? She just wanted to see his body. Wanted to touch him. He stirred feelings of desire that she\u2019d sworn she\u2019d never feel for a man again.</p><p>He kissed her again and smoothed a hand over her face.</p><p>\u201cI love the feel of your skin,\u201d he said. \u201cI could keep touching you forever. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever grow tired of it.\u201d</p><p>She gathered her courage and held it tightly to her. Joel had taught her that rejection was pain. It was humiliation. It meant feeling completely alone. He\u2019d rejected her advances at every turn until she\u2019d numbly fallen into the robotic routine of only doing what pleased him and never acting spontaneously. Did she dare risk being rejected by Liam?</p><p>She closed her eyes, her pulse accelerating. It was such a simple thing and yet she was terrified that he\u2019d back away.</p><p>\u201cHey, are you okay?\u201d Liam asked. \u201cYou just went incredibly tense. You know I\u2019m not going to hurt you, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI was going to . . .\u201d She swallowed hard. \u201cI was going to ask you . . .\u201d</p><p>He trailed a finger down her cheek and then back up again. \u201cWhat do you want to ask me, baby?\u201d</p><p>Bracing herself for crushing disappointment, she held her breath and voiced her request.</p><p>\u201cI was going to ask if you\u2019d hold me. There\u2019s enough room,\u201d she hastily added before he could respond. \u201cAnd I understand if you\u2019d rather stay where you are. I know the bed is small\u2014\u201d</p><p>He hushed her with a deep, hungry kiss. His mouth covered hers and for a long moment, there was complete silence. Only the light sounds of his tongue, moving hot over hers. The harsh exhalation of breaths. And then he pulled away, his chest heaving audibly.</p><p>He didn\u2019t issue a response. Didn\u2019t say a single thing. He simply rose and then lifted her into his arms. Then he maneuvered his way onto the bed and settled her in the crook of his arm between him and the wall. They were both on their sides, pressed tight against each other. She wondered if he had any room or if he was on the very edge of the bed.</p><p>And then she realized she didn\u2019t care. She was in his arms.</p><p>Nothing had ever felt so right. So perfect.</p><p>Peace settled over her as he cuddled her closer, fitting their bodies together. He reached down to pull the covers over the both of them, and then he hooked one leg over hers.</p><p>He was just wearing boxers. And she could feel his erection against her leg. She should feel trapped. He was wrapped completely around her. But what she felt was safe.</p><p>\u201cBetter?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cBetter,\u201d she agreed, nuzzling closer still.</p><p>She could smell him, loved the sensation of his chest against her chin and lips. She inserted her hand between them and smoothed from his belly upward to his chest and then upward over his shoulder.</p><p>His muscles quivered and jumped beneath her touch. She just wanted to soak him in. Savor this moment and the closeness between them.</p><p>He rubbed his hand up and down her back, and then he slipped his hand underneath the hem of her pajama top and slid his palm over her bare back.</p><p>She shivered in reaction and closed her eyes. She was very nearly lulled to sleep when his chest rumbled and his words broke the silence.</p><p>\u201cLauren, how badly did he hurt you?\u201d he asked softly.</p><p>She stiffened but he kept rubbing her back and pressed a kiss to her temple.</p><p>\u201cHe can\u2019t hurt you, baby. You\u2019re here with me, in my arms. I\u2019m wrapped around you, and to get to you, someone has to go through me. I\u2019m a mean son of a bitch when I\u2019m riled. No one\u2019s going to fuck with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy is it important to know?\u201d she asked, her throat closing in as she remembered that last night when her world had been shattered. Her faith. Her belief in Joel. He\u2019d become real to her then. No longer a fantasy she\u2019d created in her denial. He\u2019d hurt her. But sometimes she wondered if he hadn\u2019t done her a favor by losing control. If he hadn\u2019t would she still be under his thumb? Would she still be trying to please him by losing more of herself every single day?</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019ve never told anyone. Or at least you didn\u2019t tell Max and you didn\u2019t tell me or Noah. You were vague and let the bruises do most of the talking for you. You let us draw our own conclusions about what happened, but you\u2019ve never talked about it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cH-he snapped,\u201d she said falteringly. \u201cTo this day I can\u2019t remember what made him lose his temper. He came home in a mood. I knew it and I tried my best to fade into the background. Become invisible. I knew he wouldn\u2019t want me in the way. I remember going into the kitchen. I was nervous and scared and I kept thinking, this is wrong. This is so wrong. Why am I with a man who terrifies me? Why am I tiptoeing around? I dropped a glass and I panicked. Had he heard it? I got the broom and a dustpan but when I turned around to clean it up, he was there.\u201d</p><p>She was shaking against Liam. Cold. She no longer felt warm and safe. She was back in that cold, sterile environment that had suddenly erupted in violence.</p><p>\u201cHe dragged me into the bedroom, shoved me face down on the bed. I remember his hand in my hair and his knee in my back and the sound of his zipper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh God, baby,\u201d Liam said as he hugged her tighter to him.</p> <p>\u201cI always wore dresses or skirts. He liked thin, feminine material. He liked easy access. He shoved up my dress, yanked my underwear down, and then he was on top of me. I-inside me. Oh God, I hated it, Liam. I hated him.\u201d</p><p>Liam rocked her back and forth, his body so rigid that there was absolutely no give in him.</p><p>\u201cThat son of a bitch.\u201d</p><p>Lauren yanked away from Liam and scrambled up as she heard Noah\u2019s explosive outburst from the doorway of the bedroom.</p><p>\u201cGoddamn it, Noah!\u201d Liam bit out. \u201cYou scared her to death. What the fuck, man?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIs it all right if I turn on the bathroom light, Lauren?\u201d Noah asked, his voice still tight.</p><p>\u201cY-yes,\u201d she stammered out.</p><p>A moment later, light poured into the bedroom, illuminating the bed where Liam lay and she sat, her knees hunched to her chest and her back against the wall.</p><p>She glanced warily at Noah, who stood at the end of the bed. Her bedroom was getting crowded with three people. It was hard to breathe. Her chest felt tight and constricted.</p><p>Liam pushed himself upward into a sitting position, and it was then she saw the tattoos that swirled over his shoulders and to his chest. She\u2019d been right. He had more than just the ones on his arms.</p><p>\u201cLauren?\u201d Noah asked softly.</p> <p>She glanced back up at him.</p><p>He sat on the very end of the bed, and she wondered if the bed would bear up under the weight of all three of them.</p><p>\u201cCome here, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>She flew into his arms and wrapped hers around his neck. He held her tightly for what seemed like forever. Just holding her. He buried his face in her hair and smoothed his hand up and down her back much like Liam had done.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry if I startled you,\u201d he said against her hair. \u201cI wasn\u2019t trying to eavesdrop. I got up to come to the bathroom and I heard you and Liam talking. I heard what that bastard did to you. I couldn\u2019t just walk away and pretend I hadn\u2019t heard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t fight him,\u201d Lauren said in a small voice. \u201cI was in shock. He wasn\u2019t that rough. He was punishing me. But I wasn\u2019t ready. I mean how could I have been? It hurt. A lot. But more than the physical pain was how violated I felt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you want him to do that to you?\u201d Liam asked.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d she said, shocked by the question.</p> <p>\u201cDid you say no?\u201d Liam prodded further.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI said no. I sobbed it. I begged him to stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen goddamn it, he raped you. He forced himself on you,\u201d Noah said fiercely. \u201cIf you said no. If you even thought no. If you had no power to make him stop, then how could it be anything else? You sure as hell didn\u2019t give him your consent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one else would see it that way,\u201d she said, tears welling in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t give a fuck how anyone else sees it,\u201d Noah bit out. \u201cHe took the choice from you, Lauren. He had absolute power over you. He held you down and forced you to have sex with him. How can that be anything but rape? And worse, he made you believe you deserved it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like it that way,\u201d she said, her voice cracking.</p><p>\u201cWhat way, baby?\u201d Liam asked gently.</p><p>\u201cIt was the way he always had sex with me. He held me facedown and he took me from behind. I hate it. I feel so helpless.\u201d</p><p>Noah found her lips and kissed her. It wasn\u2019t an overwhelming kiss meant to dazzle her senses or overcome her with passion. It was a tender, sweet kiss that she felt all the way to her soul.</p><p>He framed her face in his hands and pulled away so she was forced to look into his eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhen the time comes that you\u2019re ready to make love to us, we will do nothing that frightens you or makes you uncomfortable. We\u2019re not to that point yet. Yes, we want to hold you. Touch you. Kiss you as many times as we can get away with it. But making love is a big step and it\u2019s not one we need to take before you have absolute trust in the fact that we\u2019re not going to hurt you. But you know what? It\u2019ll come. Maybe not next week or next month. But we\u2019ll get there and I\u2019m willing to wait for as long as it takes you to heal from what that bastard did to your confidence and your heart and your mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could so easily fall in love with you both,\u201d she whispered, mimicking Liam\u2019s earlier words.</p><p>\u201cThat makes us very happy to hear, sweetheart,\u201d Noah murmured. \u201cNow why don\u2019t you try to get some rest. Today\u2019s been one hell of a day for you. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re exhausted mentally and physically.\u201d</p><p>She glanced up at him, touched his cheek. \u201cDoes it bother you . . . I mean, are you okay with . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust spit it out, honey. You don\u2019t have to pull your punches with me,\u201d Noah said gently.</p><p>\u201cWill it make you angry that I\u2019m sleeping next to Liam? That I asked him to hold me?\u201d she asked hesitantly.</p><p>Noah smiled. \u201cNot at all. Because you know what? Tomorrow night it\u2019ll be me in here, holding you and sleeping next to you.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 10</p><p>LAUREN had always been a little overwhelmed by the Colter family. Not in a bad way. They\u2019d been nothing but loving and accepting of her from the very start.</p><p>But they were just so . . .</p><p>Everything. They were everything she\u2019d imagine in the perfect American family. What most people dreamed of. Closeness. Tight-knit. Fiercely loyal.</p><p>Except that they hardly fit the picture of the typical American family.</p><p>When Max had first begun to tell her of Callie\u2019s family, Lauren had thought he was playing a joke on her. How ironic that now Lauren found herself in a similar situation, and moreover, it was one she wanted to be in.</p><p>The Colters had opened her eyes to a whole new world. One that was filled with love and acceptance. It was a world she much preferred over her old one.</p><p>As she and Liam and Noah got out of the rental they\u2019d driven from Denver to Clyde, Lauren grew nervous. Would it be evident to everyone that Liam and Noah were more than just bodyguards hired by her brother?</p><p>Liam whistled. \u201cNice place they have here. It looks like a postcard.\u201d</p><p>And indeed it did.</p><p>The log cabin was nestled against the mountain, surrounded by aspens and pine and afforded a beautiful view in every direction.</p><p>She pointed to the meadow in the distance where a stream cut through the land. Spring had come, bringing with it bountiful flowers and lush greenery. It was a place that calmed the senses and signaled peace. She took a deep breath, sucking in the pine scented cool air.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s where Max and Callie live. Across the meadow in the house Max built for Callie. It\u2019s not a long walk and there\u2019s a worn trail that leads to their property. Callie\u2019s property,\u201d she amended.</p><p>The land had been a bone of contention between Max and Callie. It had once belonged to Lauren\u2019s stepfather, the man who\u2019d raised her and Max, and after he passed, her mother had sold it to the Colters. Max had believed the elder Colter brothers had taken advantage of her mom and had fully intended to do whatever necessary to get the land back. Even if it meant deceiving Callie in the process.</p><p>She shook her head. Her brother had very nearly screwed up the best thing that had ever happened to him. He was at peace now. Maybe it was what the land and the Colters had done for him. Maybe it was what would do the same for her.</p><p>The front door opened, and Ethan Colter stepped out, a smile broadening his features.</p><p>\u201cHello, Lauren! Come on in.\u201d</p><p>Lauren relaxed, smiling back at the older man. She hurried toward the door, eager to be back in the bosom of the Colter family. She always looked forward to her visits here, no matter how frequently she came.</p><p>Liam and Noah followed closely behind, and when she got to the porch, Ethan enfolded her in a huge hug.</p><p>In the beginning she\u2019d been hesitant around the loving, demonstrative family, even though it was in her nature to be just as affectionate. But Joel had taught her reserve and it was a hard lesson to forget.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good to see you, honey,\u201d Ethan said.</p><p>She squeezed back. \u201cAnd you.\u201d</p><p>She turned to Noah and Liam standing a few steps back. \u201cEthan, this is Noah Sullivan and Liam Prescott. Noah and Liam, this is Ethan Colter.\u201d</p><p>Ethan immediately extended his hand to Noah and then to Liam.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a pleasure to meet you, sir,\u201d Noah said.</p><p>\u201cCome on in, all of you. Holly is dying to get her hands on you. I\u2019ll warn you now. Just take whatever comes. My wife is used to getting her own way. She\u2019ll likely interrogate you and then smother you with hugs.\u201d</p><p>He smiled indulgently, his love for his wife softening his eyes and expression.</p><p>Lauren pushed by Ethan, eager to be inside. As soon as she stepped into the living room, it was like coming home. Memories of the previous Christmas when she\u2019d been so unsure of her place in the world, and in this family came to mind.</p><p>Warmth, love and peace washed over her, cradling her in their soothing embrace.</p><p>\u201cLauren!\u201d</p><p>Holly Colter surged up from her place on the couch between Adam and Ryan Colter, and she rushed over, pulling Lauren into a fierce hug that was even bigger than the one Ethan had given her.</p><p>Behind her, Adam and Ryan rose, their gazes drawn to Noah and Liam. There was wary reserve and sharp appraisal in their stares. Lauren smiled as the force that was Holly Colter surrounded her, making her feel love and concern that had extended to one who wasn\u2019t Holly\u2019s own. Not that Holly would ever draw that distinction. She\u2019d made it clear from the day she\u2019d come to see Lauren, when Lauren had still been in seclusion at Max and Callie\u2019s home, that she considered Lauren one of her children.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s so good to see you, baby,\u201d Holly whispered. \u201cHow are you? Are you okay?\u201d</p><p>Lauren pulled away. \u201cI\u2019m fine. Truly. You don\u2019t need to worry about me. Noah and Liam have promised to take care of me.\u201d</p><p>Holly frowned a little as she looked past Lauren to the two men behind her. Then she pushed past Lauren, and Lauren turned to see what was in store for Noah and Liam.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Holly Colter,\u201d she said. \u201cMax told me about you, but I wanted to set eyes on you myself and make sure that you were the kind of men I can trust to take care of my baby.\u201d</p><p>Liam\u2019s lips twitched into a smile while Noah looked a little more wary.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m very pleased to meet you, ma\u2019am,\u201d Liam said solemnly. \u201cAnd I promise to take very good care of Lauren. Noah and I are going to make sure that no one ever hurts Lauren again.\u201d</p><p>There was a flicker of response in the Colter brothers\u2019 eyes. Adam\u2019s eyebrows went up a notch while Ryan\u2019s eyes narrowed.</p><p>Holly stared at them for a long time, and then she smiled broadly. Then she pulled the much larger Liam into a huge hug and patted him on the back.</p><p>\u201cI think I like you, Liam.\u201d</p><p>Then she turned to Noah as if she hadn\u2019t yet made up her mind about him.</p><p>\u201cAnd what have you got to say, young man?\u201d</p><p>At that Ethan chuckled while Adam and Ryan smothered their smiles of amusement. Noah looked befuddled as the much smaller woman took him to task.</p><p>He looked like he\u2019d rather take on a group of terrorists than answer to her.</p><p>\u201cI care very much about Lauren\u2019s safety,\u201d Noah finally said. \u201cAnd as Liam said, we\u2019re here to protect her. You can trust us with her safety. Someone will have to go through us to get close to her.\u201d</p><p>Holly gave him the same frank appraisal she\u2019d given Liam and then she smiled.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll do.\u201d</p><p>Then she hugged him just as enthusiastically as she had Liam and then promptly ordered him and Liam to have a seat.</p><p>Once satisfied that Noah and Liam were taken care of, she turned back to Lauren.</p><p>\u201cLily and the boys are on their way over now, and I expect Max and Callie at any moment. I prepared lunch today,\u201d she said proudly.</p><p>Adam gave her an indulgent smile.</p><p>Ryan took his seat on the couch across from where Liam and Noah had taken their seats. And sent them both a look of amusement.</p><p>\u201cAfter more than thirty years, our wife has taken it upon herself to learn how to cook. She made Christmas dinner for us all without burning the kitchen down, so we\u2019ve agreed to turn her loose on occasion. What\u2019s she\u2019s prepared is anyone\u2019s guess, so I hope you brought the antacid.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Holly sent a glare in Ryan\u2019s direction. \u201cOh hush. You\u2019re going to scare them and have them thinking I\u2019m going to poison them.\u201d</p><p>Ethan ruffled her hair affectionately. \u201cNot too long ago, that would have been the truth. I have the fire extinguishers on standby.\u201d</p><p>Noah and Liam both wore peculiar expressions, as if they weren\u2019t sure how seriously to take the bantering. Lauren just laughed and hugged Holly again.</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re a wonderful cook, Mama C. I\u2019ll be happy to eat whatever you fix.\u201d</p> <p>Holly beamed and patted Lauren\u2019s arm. \u201cI always knew you were my favorite child. Come into the kitchen with me. We can talk while I finish up and we\u2019ll leave the men out here to do whatever it is men do when they\u2019re together.\u201d</p><p>Then she sent another glare in her husbands\u2019 direction. \u201cYou don\u2019t say another word about my cooking. You\u2019ve liked what I\u2019ve cooked just fine.\u201d</p><p>Ethan put his arm around her. \u201cSweetheart, you\u2019ve only cooked twice more since Christmas. Give us time to adjust. We\u2019re too used to having the fire department on standby when you venture into the kitchen.\u201d</p><p>Holly shook her head then reached for Lauren\u2019s hand. \u201cCome on. I\u2019ve got nothing left to say to these men.\u201d</p><p>Lauren allowed herself to be dragged into the kitchen, though she felt a brief moment of guilt for pitching Noah and Liam to the wolves. They\u2019d probably get grilled by the Colter men. Hopefully the others would arrive soon. At least Noah and Liam knew Max and Seth already.</p> <p>But on the other hand . . . If she was truly going to entertain having a relationship with Noah and Liam, the Colter family was going to be something they would have to get used to, because the Colters were too important to Lauren.</p><p>They were her family.</p><p>\u201cSit and keep me company,\u201d Holly said, steering her toward the L-shaped bar that curved from the kitchen counters.</p><p>Lauren slid onto one of the leather stools and propped her elbows on the counter.</p><p>\u201cSo what are you cooking today?\u201d Lauren asked.</p><p>Holly grinned, her eyes twinkling mischievously. \u201cI\u2019m totally cheating. Lily brought me three pans of lasagna yesterday, premade. All I have to do is pop them in the oven and voila, a mouthwatering Italian dinner. I have bakery rolls from town and bag salad from the store.\u201d</p> <p>Lauren laughed. \u201cI won\u2019t breathe a word.\u201d</p><p>Holly took the lasagna from the fridge and slid them into the double-wall oven, set the timer and then came back to the bar and peered across it at Lauren.</p><p>\u201cSo tell me about Noah and Liam. I sense there\u2019s more to this whole thing than their being some random strangers Max hired to protect you.\u201d</p><p>Heat crept into Lauren\u2019s cheeks and she fidgeted nervously on the stool.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you say that?\u201d Lauren asked curiously.</p><p>Holly smiled. \u201cBaby, the way those men look at you tells its own story. And the way Liam talked about people going through him and Noah to get to you? If you were just a job, they would have had some polished spiel they regurgitated for every client. There was passion in his voice and I absolutely believed him when he said he wouldn\u2019t let anyone hurt you.\u201d</p><p>Lauren sighed. \u201cI wanted to talk to you about them.\u201d She dug her fingertips into her temples and rubbed.</p><p>Holly\u2019s look turned to one of concern. \u201cWhat is it, Lauren? You know you can talk to me about anything.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey want a relationship with me. Like the one you have with your . . . husbands.\u201d</p><p>Holly\u2019s eyes widened a bit and then her brow furrowed. \u201cIsn\u2019t it a bit soon? Didn\u2019t they just arrive?\u201d Then she broke into a wry smile. \u201cLike I can talk. Adam, Ethan and Ryan took one look at me and decided I was the one. They never looked back. It was the same when Seth first laid eyes on Lily. People laugh at the idea of love at first sight, but I\u2019ve certainly witnessed it firsthand. Over thirty years later, here I am, still just as much in love with those old fools as I was as a starry-eyed na\u00efve girl in my twenties.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love hearing about you and the dads,\u201d Lauren said wistfully.</p><p>Holly leaned across the bar and took Lauren\u2019s hands in hers. \u201cBack to Noah and Liam. You\u2019ve talked about this? Already I mean?\u201d</p><p>Lauren shook her head. \u201cYes, we\u2019ve talked, but it\u2019s not like I just met them. Max hired them when I was still in New York City. Before he and Callie came to bring me here. They started out a giant pain in my butt.\u201d</p><p>Holly laughed. \u201cSounds like a typical start to a relationship to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAccording to them, the attraction was there from the beginning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what about you?\u201d Holly asked softly.</p><p>\u201cI noticed them,\u201d Lauren hedged.</p><p>Holly laughed again. \u201cKind of hard not to notice those two. They tend to stand out in a crowd. I figure Dillon\u2019s going to get along with them just fine. They\u2019ll be comparing tattoos and earrings. I swear I don\u2019t know where that child of mine got his tastes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow hard is it, really?\u201d Lauren asked in a quiet voice. \u201cI\u2019m scared of messing up. I\u2019m drawn to both of them. I love the idea of having these two wonderful men both devoted to me. But I\u2019m using your husbands and Lily\u2019s husbands as measuring sticks. I don\u2019t want to go in with unrealistic expectations. Am I crazy for wanting this? To agreeing to try it with them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, sweetie, you\u2019re overthinking this. There\u2019s really one question to ask. Do you love them?\u201d</p><p>Lauren dropped her gaze. \u201cI don\u2019t know. It\u2019s so soon after Joel. What if I\u2019m just latching on to the first opportunity after a really bad relationship? I don\u2019t want to use them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, let me rephrase the question. Could you see yourself eventually falling in love with them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yes,\u201d Lauren breathed.</p><p>Holly squeezed her hands. \u201cDo they love you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think they could. Maybe they do. I\u2019m not sure. But they act like I\u2019m the most important person in the world to them. They\u2019re so loving and patient and gentle. They aren\u2019t trying to rush me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen that\u2019s all that\u2019s important. If you can see yourself falling in love with both men and they both care about you, everything else will work itself out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou make it sound so easy,\u201d Lauren said. \u201cI just keep thinking of everything that can go wrong. What if one of them gets jealous? What if I don\u2019t spend exactly the same amount of time with both of them?\u201d Her face went beet red with heat. \u201cWhat if I have sex more with one than the other? It all makes my head hurt.\u201d</p><p>Holly walked around the bar and slid onto the stool next to Lauren.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re taking far too much on your shoulders, baby. Listen to me. You can only control what you do. You can\u2019t be responsible for how they react or what they do. In a lot of ways, the relationship is much harder on the men than it is the woman, and in some aspects it\u2019s more difficult for the woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re confusing me,\u201d Lauren said in amusement.</p><p>\u201cThe men have to form a bond. I know it sounds silly. In my case, the men were brothers. Trust was already there. Trust is very important between the men so they\u2019re working on the same page. When you have a case like with Noah and Liam, that friendship and trust has to be there so that jealousy doesn\u2019t become an issue or they\u2019re not always wondering if the other is trying to get you to agree to kick one out of the relationship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat makes sense,\u201d Lauren agreed.</p><p>\u201cAnd the way it\u2019s more difficult for a woman, is that she has multiple personalities to learn and work around. The men are working with one woman. She\u2019s their focus. But the woman\u2019s focus is split between two, or in my case, three men. She has to know what makes each of them tick. And sometimes it\u2019s a delicate balance juggling those different personalities because each man has his own set of desires, and what he wants from the relationship. One might need one thing from you while the other needs something entirely different. It can be exhausting, especially in the beginning when you\u2019re learning.\u201d</p><p>Lauren nodded again. \u201cI knew I could count on you to make perfect sense, Mama C. But you know, it\u2019s kind of exciting when everything is all shiny and new and when the mere thought of a relationship makes you breathless. They give me . . . hope. I\u2019m almost afraid to believe, because I don\u2019t know what I\u2019ll do if it doesn\u2019t work out.\u201d</p><p>Holly cupped Lauren\u2019s face in her hands. \u201cJust take it one day at a time, baby. It\u2019s all you can do. But let me tell you. Those two men are the luckiest guys on earth to have you and they don\u2019t need to forget it. You are a beautiful, intelligent, loving young woman and one I\u2019m very proud to call my daughter. And you are, you know. You may not bear the Colter last name, but that\u2019s the only thing that sets you apart from one of my own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Mom!\u201d</p><p>Lauren whirled around to see Callie burst into the kitchen, a sunny smile on her face.</p><p>Holly\u2019s expression softened, and she hopped off the stool to go hug her youngest child. Except that according to Holly, Lauren was one of her brood, which actually made Lauren the youngest.</p><p>It did heart-stopping things to Lauren to fully comprehend that she had a place in this wonderful family. God, it made her want to tear all up, and if that wasn\u2019t just stupid after so many months, she didn\u2019t know what it was.</p><p>As Callie was hugging her mom, Lily Colter walked in behind them. Seven months pregnant, Lily still moved gracefully despite the bulge on her small frame. She was a petite woman with delicate features.</p><p>As Lauren glanced around at the women gathered in the Colter kitchen, she realized that this was a room full of women who\u2019d survived unimaginable tragedies, dangerous situations and heartbreak. It was one thing they all had in common.</p><p>Lily had been married before she\u2019d met Holly\u2019s sons, and she\u2019d suffered a terrible loss when her newborn baby had died of sudden infant death syndrome. Her husband had blamed her and divorced Lily. Devastated and grief stricken, Lily had walked away, living on the streets, homeless, until Seth, who\u2019d then worked as a police office in Denver, had spotted her at a soup kitchen where he volunteered.</p><p>He\u2019d taken her home and when his brothers had met her, they\u2019d had the same instant recognition that Seth himself had felt. They all knew that she was the one.</p><p>Lauren firmly believed that Max had also known instantly that Callie was the one, but he\u2019d been a lot more hardheaded than the Colter men, and the result had been nearly losing Callie forever.</p><p>It had never really occurred to Lauren how drastically her own life would have changed if Max and Callie hadn\u2019t been able to work things out. Lauren would have never come to know the Colters. Never would have been a part of the family she now considered her own.</p><p>After Holly hugged and fussed over Lily, Lily broke away and came to give Lauren a quick hug. Concern darkened her blue eyes as she struggled to get onto the bar stool next to Lauren.</p><p>\u201cSeth told me a little of what happened. Are you okay?\u201d Lily asked anxiously.</p><p>Lauren smiled and nodded. \u201cI\u2019m fine. Noah and Liam won\u2019t let anything happen to me.\u201d</p><p>Lily\u2019s eyes lightened but then gleamed, and she pursed her lips. \u201cAnd speaking of Noah and Liam, you\u2019ve got to give me the dirt on those two gorgeous hunks. God, they remind me of Dillon. Well him and Michael both. It\u2019s like taking Dillon and Michael and producing their offspring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh God, Lily. Really? I so don\u2019t need that image branded into my brain,\u201d Callie said with a groan as she took the stool on the other side of Lauren.</p><p>\u201cAll that long dark hair and tattoos on Liam?\u201d Lily said. \u201cThat man is gorgeous and so dangerous looking.\u201d</p><p>Lauren grinned and preened under the praise from the other woman. And she could even see how Lily made the comparison. Dillon Colter was the wild child. The one that seemingly broke the mold in the Colter family. He looked like a total badass but he had a heart of gold. He sported tattoos and an earring, but his hair was cut short and spiked on top. Michael was certainly more conservative, but his one rebellion seemed to be his hair, which he wore shoulder length. Liam seemed a good combination of both men.</p><p>\u201cAnd Noah isn\u2019t bad to look at either,\u201d Callie broke in. \u201cI\u2019d certainly lick those arms of his. They\u2019re huge! You can\u2019t tell me those two don\u2019t lift weights to have biceps that big. His tats are cool too. Definitely more subtle than Liam\u2019s, but it just works for him. He has that quiet badass look to him.\u201d</p><p>Holly chuckled as she walked back to the fridge. She pulled out the bag of lettuce, two tomatoes, a cucumber and a packet of shredded carrots.</p><p>\u201cBetter not let Max hear you talking about licking another man\u2019s anything, Callie.\u201d</p><p>Callie made a face. \u201cIt\u2019s not like I really would. But it\u2019s certainly tempting.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo what\u2019s the story on those two?\u201d Lily asked. \u201cAm I the only one in the dark here? Seth said very little. Just that they were here to protect you. He nearly gave me a heart attack and then he had to spend the next half hour assuring me that someone wasn\u2019t trying to kill you or something.\u201d</p><p>Lauren put her hand over Lily\u2019s. \u201cI\u2019m sorry he worried you. It\u2019s really nothing. I\u2019m more than a little embarrassed over it all. I kept important information from Max and from Noah and Liam. Max hired them months ago. Before I came here at Christmas. It was when I got the nerve to leave . . . Joel . . . and finally called Max for help. But I didn\u2019t tell them the truth about who I was involved in.\u201d</p><p>Callie wrinkled her nose. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Lauren sighed. \u201cI know it sounds stupid.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, no,\u201d Lily rushed to say. \u201cWe don\u2019t think you\u2019re stupid at all, Lauren. I\u2019m so proud of you for having the guts to walk away from that jerk. But why would you protect him?\u201d</p><p>Lauren shook her head emphatically. \u201cI was never protecting him. I was trying to protect Max. And Noah and Liam. I knew if Max knew the truth, he\u2019d go after Joel. He was furious at the time. And Joel was\u2014is\u2014involved in illegal activities. I doubt I even know the extent of it. He has many people on his payroll, including cops. If Max or Noah and Liam were to threaten him in any way, who\u2019s to say he wouldn\u2019t have them killed? It sounds dramatic and over the top, but you have to understand the kind of man Joel is. I honestly just wanted as far away from him as possible and I want to forget he exists.\u201d</p><p>Callie wrapped her arm protectively around Lauren and squeezed fiercely. \u201cOf course you do and I don\u2019t blame you a bit. Besides, who wouldn\u2019t want to be protected by two hunks like Noah and Liam?\u201d she added cheekily.</p><p>Lily laughed and Lauren relaxed. She was surrounded by dear friends. Family. Women she cared deeply about and who loved her in return. This was what she loved most about being with the Colters. The freedom to be herself. To confide, discuss, laugh and joke.</p><p>No one told her how to act. Hugs were given as freely as breathing. Someone was always touching, showing affection. No one blinked an eye over it.</p> <p>The ache inside her grew until she rubbed her chest to alleviate the discomfort.</p><p>How wonderful would it be if she and Noah and Liam could live right here in these mountains, surrounded by the family who\u2019d made Lauren one of their own?</p><p>Chapter 11</p><p>ON the drive home, Lauren stared out the window as dusk settled over the mountains. She\u2019d enjoyed herself. She always did. Any time she was feeling down, she could count on a visit with the Colters to pick her up.</p><p>They made her believe that things would get better. They always did.</p><p>But one thought that had passed through her mind, sitting in Holly\u2019s kitchen, haunted her.</p> <p>She\u2019d wished for a happily ever after with Noah and Liam, right here in these mountains, surrounded by her family and the people she loved.</p><p>How realistic was that?</p><p>The stark truth was that it wasn\u2019t at all realistic. Noah\u2019s and Liam\u2019s lives were in New York. Their business was in New York. And when they had ascertained that there was no longer a threat to her, whether they remained in a relationship with her or not, they\u2019d move on to another job, guarding other people. Providing personal security. In New York City.</p><p>The mere thought of being in the same city as Joel Knight, no matter how huge the city was or how unlikely it was that they\u2019d ever cross paths, sent her into complete panic.</p><p>What if he knew, even now, what she\u2019d done? She hadn\u2019t been that careful. She didn\u2019t know enough about computers to know if what she\u2019d done could be discovered. He might have known that she\u2019d been through his files the moment she disappeared.</p><p>As much as she\u2019d tried not to focus on him, as much as she\u2019d tried to shove him from her mind and move on with her life, how did she know that he wasn\u2019t looking for her?</p><p>She\u2019d made a big deal to the other women that she\u2019d wanted to protect Max and Noah and Liam, and that was true, but she also feared coming into contact with him again in case he knew what she\u2019d stolen.</p><p>It was laughable that she\u2019d even done such a stupid thing. Especially when she had no plans to do anything with the information she\u2019d copied from his computer. At the time, in her fragile mind, it had been an insurance policy. So that if he did ever come after her, she could threaten him.</p> <p>Which made her the biggest idiot in the world. Threaten a man like Joel Knight? He could squash her like a bug and never blink an eye. She was nobody. Certainly not someone strong enough to stand up to him and back him into a corner.</p><p>She\u2019d vowed to herself that she\u2019d stop beating herself up over her past mistakes, but it was hard sometimes when she thought back on just how brainwashed she\u2019d been; and then when she\u2019d finally been gutsy enough to get out, she\u2019d all but ensured that if he discovered what she\u2019d taken, he\u2019d never simply let her go and forget about her.</p><p>It was something she needed to confide in Noah and Liam. She knew she needed to tell them, but the words simply wouldn\u2019t come. Maybe they were right in that she didn\u2019t fully trust them yet. Maybe in time she\u2019d feel at ease with confessing her stupidity. She just knew that right now wasn\u2019t the time. She had to be more sure of them\u2014of her and them.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re quiet, baby,\u201d Liam said from the backseat.</p><p>She started, suddenly aware of just how zoned out she\u2019d been, immersed deeply in her thoughts and recriminations.</p><p>Noah reached over from the driver\u2019s seat to take her hand, and he laced their fingers together.</p><p>\u201cEverything okay?\u201d Noah asked. \u201cDid you enjoy your visit?\u201d</p><p>Lauren smiled. No question there. \u201cI love the Colters. Being with them always makes me happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll admit, I wasn\u2019t sure what to expect,\u201d Liam said. \u201cIt sounds pretty incredible when someone explains the kind of relationship the Colter men have with their wives. But then when you see them together, you don\u2019t even question it. It\u2019s so obvious they belong together and that it works for them.\u201d</p><p>He broke off for a long moment, and then he leaned forward, resting his elbows on the edges of Lauren\u2019s and Noah\u2019s seats.</p><p>\u201cI want that for us, Lauren. That sense of rightness. The closeness. I want for people to look at us and say the same things we say about the Colters.\u201d</p><p>Lauren turned as much in her seat as the seat belt allowed. Noah was focused on the road, but it was apparent that he was tuned in completely to the conversation.</p><p>She sighed, allowing her earlier unhappiness to escape. It was impossible to keep her mouth from turning down.</p><p>\u201cHey, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d Liam asked, concern in his voice. \u201cAre you having second thoughts? Did someone say anything to you today to change your mind?\u201d</p><p>She slowly shook her head. \u201cNo. Holly was extremely supportive. I didn\u2019t talk to Callie or Lily about you. Not for any other reason than this is still new and I\u2019m not one to air my private life to everyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what\u2019s made you unhappy?\u201d Noah asked. \u201cYou\u2019ve been in another world ever since we left, and it\u2019s obvious you have something on your mind you\u2019re not telling us about.\u201d</p><p>She glanced nervously between them, not because she feared a physical response. She feared the confirmation of her realization and the bursting of her created fantasy. The intrusion of reality was not always welcome. The problem was, she\u2019d lived outside the realm of reality for too long.</p><p>Denial didn\u2019t change the outcome of anything.</p><p>\u201cI was sitting at the bar with the other women, and we were all talking and I was reminded, as I always am, how much I love the Colters. And then I was struck by the thought of how wonderful it would be to live here . . . with you . . . to be with both of you and be so close to my family.\u201d</p><p>She sucked in another breath while Liam and Noah both waited expectantly for her to continue.</p><p>\u201cAnd as we drove away, I realized how impossible that is. Your lives are in New York. I realize you have feelings for me that go above and beyond me being a job to you, but once whatever threat is determined and eliminated, you\u2019ll go on to another job. In New York. And whatever relationship we attempt would also have to be in New York. I realized how afraid I still am to be in the same city, no matter how vast, that Joel\u2019s in. This has become home to me, and I hate the thought of having to leave it.\u201d</p><p>There, she\u2019d said it. She held her breath, not wanting to hear what they would say. She hated having reality intrude when things were new and exciting and hope had sprung.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know that we\u2019ve even given that a thought,\u201d Noah said honestly.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s certainly something we would need to discuss and work out between us,\u201d Liam said in a careful tone. \u201cMy primary focus was you. And somehow getting you to accept what we proposed. Beyond that hurdle, I\u2019ve given little thought to anything else, except to realize that we have to take it as it comes, one day at a time.\u201d</p><p>She nodded her understanding, but the issue was still there, like a giant roadblock, and it was one she didn\u2019t see a way around.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t expect them to sacrifice everything they\u2019d worked to achieve for her. What did she have to offer them here anyway? She was a waitress. In a diner. She made barely enough to pay her rent and get by on. And there wasn\u2019t a high demand for personal protection in Clyde.</p><p>For that matter what could she offer them in New York? She\u2019d quit her job at Joel\u2019s demand. He\u2019d wanted her available to him at all times and he wanted nothing to interfere in his schedule.</p><p>Stupidly\u2014God, she used that word a lot to describe her actions\u2014she\u2019d thought it romantic that he\u2019d wanted her to quit so he could take care of her. She\u2019d been too na\u00efve to realize it was the first step in putting her squarely under his complete control.</p><p>A year without work didn\u2019t do wonders for the resume. When asked by employers to explain the gap in employment, what could she say? Oh, I was a na\u00efve twit who quit my job to allow a man to take over my life, but hey, I\u2019ve got my crap together now so you should feel absolutely comfortable in giving me a job.</p><p>Yeah. Not happening.</p><p>Her degree was useless in Clyde. There was about as much need for someone with marketing experience as there was for personal protection.</p><p>\u201cLauren?\u201d Liam called softly.</p><p>She turned in the direction of his voice and met the vivid blue of his gaze.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll work it out, okay?\u201d</p><p>She nodded again, not trusting herself to speak.</p><p>Noah pulled her hand onto his lap, almost as if he were sending her the message that he wasn\u2019t letting go and he wasn\u2019t giving up.</p><p>Maybe she was being too fatalistic. It wasn\u2019t as if their only two choices were Clyde or New York. While she\u2019d grown very attached to where she lived and to the Colters, there was nothing to say that she couldn\u2019t be happy somewhere else.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t planned to live here forever before, had she?</p><p>Or maybe that\u2019s precisely what she\u2019d planned. To spend the rest of her life hiding, never really living. Just existing.</p><p>Noah and Liam were giving her the opportunity to live a full, rich life filled with love. They wanted to make her happy, had sworn to do everything in their power to make her happy.</p><p>Maybe they could even live out of the city and they could commute. She doubted they\u2019d ever travel in the same circles that Joel did. They\u2019d probably never encounter him in their lifetime.</p><p>You have the power to put him away.</p><p>The insidious whisper stole through her mind.</p><p>With the information she\u2019d copied from Joel\u2019s computer, she had the power to make Joel a nonissue for a very long time. But in order to do that, she had to have courage she didn\u2019t currently possess.</p><p>And more importantly, she\u2019d have to be willing to face Joel Knight again.</p><p>Chapter 12</p><p>LAUREN dressed for bed in the tiny bathroom and took longer than normal to brush out her hair and clean her teeth. Noah was in her bedroom, also undressing for bed, while Liam was settling into the living room.</p><p>There was no way this arrangement could last long term. Not that she\u2019d minded sleeping in Liam\u2019s arms last night, but he couldn\u2019t have been comfortable on the bed. They\u2019d been forced to remain on their sides, locked together the entire night. Even she\u2019d woken up stiff and with a crick in her neck. She couldn\u2019t imagine how Liam must have felt.</p><p>Should she extend the same invitation to Noah to sleep with her? She\u2019d needed comfort the evening before. The day had exhausted her and left her feeling uncertain. Or at least that was the excuse she\u2019d used to whisper the shy request to Liam.</p><p>But if she didn\u2019t, would Noah think she preferred Liam over him?</p><p>Pain throbbed at her temples and she reached up to massage them, closing her eyes as she took deep, steadying breaths.</p><p>To her surprise the bathroom door opened. Her eyes flew open to see Noah standing in the doorway, worry reflected in his gaze. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Before she could speak, he moved in, carefully lowering her wrists so that her fingers no longer dug into her temples.</p><p>\u201cHead hurt?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She was still trying to find words. His sudden appearance had taken her completely off guard.</p><p>\u201cSorry to barge in on you like that, but you had me worried. I called your name three times and I couldn\u2019t hear a damn thing going on behind the door. I was worried you\u2019d fallen or passed out.\u201d</p> <p>She grimaced. \u201cSorry. I was just lost in thoughts. So much going on and it\u2019s still kind of hard to take in.\u201d</p><p>He gently pulled her into his arms, pressing his lips to her forehead.</p><p>\u201cCome to bed. Want me to get you something for the headache?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019ll be fine. Really.\u201d</p><p>He laced his fingers with hers and pulled her into the bedroom. His bedroll was carefully made on the floor, but he directed her to the bed.</p> <p>To her surprise, he crawled onto the mattress, positioned himself so his back rested against the rail at the head of the bed, and then he spread his legs and patted the space between them.</p><p>\u201cCome here and I\u2019ll rub your head and neck.\u201d</p><p>Relieved that she didn\u2019t have to tackle the issue of whether she should invite him to the bed or not, she put her knee up on the bed and scooted toward him.</p><p>When she turned, he immediately wrapped his arms around her and pulled her back against him so she was flush against his chest.</p><p>For a moment she let her head fall back against his shoulder and turned her face into his neck, savoring the intimacy of the position.</p><p>His hands glided up her bare arms and then over the thin spaghetti straps of her cami pajama top. Then he slid his fingers into her hair from her nape, traveling upward to the top of her head. He was careful not to pull her hair, and he worked his fingers gently over her scalp, exerting subtle pressure at various intervals.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s nice,\u201d she breathed.</p><p>He let one hand fall briefly and leaned down to press his lips against the side of her neck just below her ear. It sent a cascade of chills over her bare arms until she shivered in reaction.</p><p>Her breasts tingled and swelled, her nipples tightening against the thin material. It was instinctive to raise her arms to shield the obvious reaction her body had to the simple kiss.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t hide from me, sweetheart,\u201d Noah whispered.</p><p>He reached around and took her arms, lowering them back to her lap.</p><p>\u201cI like seeing how you react to me, that you want me. It\u2019s nothing to be ashamed of.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her again, grazing his teeth lightly over her skin, and then he let his mouth wander lower to the curve of her neck.</p><p>Then he went back to rubbing her head, massaging her temples and then down to her shoulders, those big hands working their magic. Tension leaked from her, leaving her limp in his arms.</p> <p>\u201cCan I ask you something?\u201d she said in a low voice.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>She shifted and attempted to turn around so she could face him. After awkwardly maneuvering her legs and body, she knelt between his legs, sitting back on her heels so she was at eye level with him.</p><p>Maybe it would have been better to ask him when she was facing away, because now as he stared intently back at her, courage fled and her tongue felt tied in a dozen knots.</p><p>He reached up, tracing her mouth with his thumb. \u201cWhat\u2019s on your mind, sweetheart?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is kind of awkward,\u201d she mumbled.</p><p>He didn\u2019t say anything. He simply waited, patient, as she gathered her thoughts.</p><p>\u201cWill you and Liam want . . .\u201d</p><p>Heat suffused her cheeks and she couldn\u2019t get the words past her lips. She felt like a complete moron. How on earth were they going to be able to have an honest and open relationship between the three of them if she couldn\u2019t even broach the subject of sex without breaking out into hives?</p><p>\u201cWill Liam and I want what?\u201d he prompted.</p><p>\u201cTo have sex with me . . . at the same time,\u201d she finally blurted out. \u201cYou know, like a threesome.\u201d</p><p>Noah blinked in surprise, but then his eyes went dark, smoldering with enough heat to cause an odd flutter deep in her chest.</p><p>He leaned forward, wrapping his arms around her, crushing her to his chest until their noses touched and she could feel the warmth of his breath on her chin.</p><p>\u201cTo be perfectly honest, it\u2019s not something we\u2019ve discussed. You\u2019re what\u2019s important to us. Not sex. Don\u2019t get me wrong, honey. I want you in my bed, you wrapped around me so tight and me deep inside you. But I want to give you the time you need to adjust to the idea. As for a threesome, I\u2019ve never had one, but the idea is hot as hell and I\u2019d love to try it. But first? I want you. Just you. Not an audience. Not someone else in the picture. Just your mouth wrapped around my dick. My tongue between your legs. I want to taste you so badly that I ache. I want to touch you, learn you. I want to discover what excites you and how to please you. But yeah, a threesome would be pretty damn cool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she breathed out, her entire body tingling and hyperaware as he whispered the blunt words.</p><p>\u201cDoes that excite you?\u201d he murmured. \u201cThe idea of me and Liam taking you at the same time? Do you like the idea of us both touching you and filling you, kissing you, making you mindless with pleasure?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, not trusting herself to speak.</p><p>Then she swallowed and asked the other question burning a hole in her brain.</p><p>\u201cWill you make love to me? Tonight?\u201d</p><p>His entire body tightened against her. His breathing changed and his eyes darkened, making him so damn dangerous looking. And sexy as hell.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready for that?\u201d he asked, his tone wary. \u201cI don\u2019t want to rush this, Lauren. The very last thing I want to do is to hurry into something that we\u2019ll regret. I\u2019m willing to wait for as long as it takes for you to trust that I\u2019m never going to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>She slid her fingers over his jaw until her palms cradled his face so very close to hers.</p><p>\u201cI want to try,\u201d she said honestly. And she did. She wanted it more than she could explain. \u201cI do trust you. My heart trusts you. My mind is a little more cautious, but my heart tells me that I want this.\u201d</p><p>He let out a groan and briefly closed his eyes.</p><p>\u201cNoah?\u201d</p><p>The hesitancy in Lauren\u2019s voice made Noah open his eyes. It was obvious she was nervous about something. Her teeth were dug into her full bottom lip, and her eyes were shadowed where just moments ago, they\u2019d been alight with desire.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it, honey?\u201d</p><p>She glanced over her shoulder to where the bedroom door was closed, a barrier between them and Liam. He knew what her worry was before she even voiced it.</p><p>\u201cIf I make love with you tonight . . . What about Liam? Will it hurt him that we had sex first? He slept here with me last night. He held me. But we didn\u2019t make love. And it\u2019s not that I trust you more than him. It\u2019s just that I was still too nervous.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her to stop the flow of anxious chatter. So sweet and soft. He hated the worry and anxiety in her voice. He wanted to sweep her away, take her in his arms and make her forget everything but this moment.</p><p>This was a huge step in their newly forming relationship, one he hadn\u2019t anticipated taking so soon. He\u2019d been fully prepared to wait weeks, if not months, if that was what it took for her to give him such a precious gift.</p><p>\u201cBaby, listen to me,\u201d he said when he pulled away so he could look her in the eye. \u201cDon\u2019t make yourself crazy keeping score. I swear to you that Liam and I aren\u2019t keeping up and don\u2019t expect you to divide your time fifty-fifty with us. If Liam had made love to you last night, it would have been okay with me because I know that eventually it will be me. Just like if you and I take that step tonight, when you\u2019re ready you\u2019ll take that step with Liam.</p><p>\u201cAm I glad it\u2019s me? Hell yes. I\u2019m not going to lie. I\u2019m sure if Liam were the one sitting here with you between his legs looking at him with those beautiful brown eyes, he wouldn\u2019t give one damn about what I thought. He\u2019d be on his knees grateful that you trusted him enough to give him that same gift.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just don\u2019t want to ever hurt either of you,\u201d she said in a somber voice.</p><p>He touched her face, stroking his fingers down her cheek. He couldn\u2019t get enough of simply touching her. The idea that she was here, so close, asking him to make love to her. It was more than he could stand.</p><p>He\u2019d been so very right. He could fall in love with her so easily. Maybe he\u2019d already fallen. Maybe this is what it felt like, sort of like plunging over the side of a cliff in a free fall. Exhilarating. Magnificent. Scary as hell.</p><p>\u201cCan I ask you something now?\u201d he said.</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>He took a breath, not believing he was about to do this when all his instincts screamed to take the gift she offered and make love to her as tenderly and gently as she deserved.</p><p>He\u2019d just told her moments earlier that he wanted the first time with her to be just the two of them, just like he was sure that Liam would feel the same and want his first time with her to be without company.</p><p>But it was evident that she was worried\u2014a lot\u2014about the ramifications of making love to one before the other and how the other would feel.</p><p>He shoved aside his preference, because more than anything he wanted for the first time to be all about her. All for her. And he\u2019d do anything at all she wanted.</p><p>\u201cWould you prefer that Liam and I make love to you together the first time? Would it make you more comfortable and remove any fear of showing favoritism?\u201d</p><p>Her cheeks went pink and he could see the wheels turning in her head. Her blush grew darker and her breathing shallowed and became more rapid.</p><p>Then slowly, almost in slow motion, she nodded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like Liam here, yes,\u201d she said softly. \u201cI\u2019m not sure it\u2019ll ever feel right no matter which of you I made love with first. And maybe it\u2019ll never be an issue for you or for Liam. But I don\u2019t want these doubts.\u201d</p><p>He cupped her cheek, wanting to ease any concern she had about the way they embarked on the physical side of their relationship.</p><p>\u201cThen maybe we should call Liam in here and see what he has to say on the matter.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 13</p><p>LAUREN tried to calm her racing pulse as Noah got up and went to the door. She rocked back on her heels in the middle of the daybed and then glanced around in mortification.</p><p>How on earth were they going to pull this off in her bedroom?</p><p>She had little time to contemplate the matter before Noah returned with Liam behind him.</p><p>Liam\u2019s hair was unkempt, in a sexy, bed-rumpled kind of way. His eyes were alert, though, as if he hadn\u2019t yet been to sleep. His gaze immediately homed in on Lauren, warming her as it glided up her body to her face.</p><p>Noah climbed onto the bed, pulled one knee up and let his other leg hang off so his foot was planted on the floor. Liam took a seat at the opposite end and turned in a nearly identical position as Noah so he could look at Lauren.</p><p>\u201cNoah said you wanted to talk to us about something,\u201d Liam said, his deep voice rumbling out of his chest.</p><p>Her gaze swung to Noah in panic. She hadn\u2019t expected that she\u2019d have to repeat it all.</p><p>Noah reached for her hand and squeezed. Then he turned to Liam.</p><p>\u201cLauren is afraid that if she makes love to me tonight that it will hurt you. Or if she were to make love to you first, that I\u2019d be hurt.\u201d</p><p>Liam frowned as he glanced between her and Noah. Maybe she\u2019d been right to worry.</p><p>\u201cLet me back up to an earlier point in our conversation,\u201d Noah said. \u201cBefore this was brought up, Lauren asked if you and I would want to have sex with her at the same time.\u201d</p><p>At that Liam\u2019s eyebrows went up and his eyes widened. Before Noah could continue, Liam\u2019s expression became serious and he turned to take Lauren\u2019s other hand.</p><p>\u201cI only want what you\u2019re comfortable with, baby.\u201d</p><p>Noah cleared his throat. \u201cWhen she brought up her fear of making love with me before you, I asked her if she would be more comfortable if we made love to her . . . together . . . the first time.\u201d</p><p>Understanding registered in Liam\u2019s eyes. His eyes went smoky blue and he reached his hand up to cup her cheek, stroking his thumb lightly over her skin.</p><p>\u201cIs that what you want?\u201d he asked softly.</p><p>She nodded, nuzzling her cheek further into his palm.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t trust you and Noah not to get angry or jealous. But I don\u2019t like the way it makes me feel to leave one of you out. I think it bothers me more than it does either of you. I want to start things . . . right. I don\u2019t want to worry that I\u2019ve hurt you or worry about what you\u2019re thinking. I just want to be with you both.\u201d</p><p>Liam leaned forward to kiss her forehead. \u201cYou have to know I\u2019d do anything in the damn world for you, baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how to do this,\u201d she admitted. \u201cI\u2019m a little scared.\u201d</p><p>Liam smiled. \u201cI have zero experience in threesomes. I guess we\u2019ll learn together won\u2019t we? I\u2019ll tell you right now, I\u2019m not down with another guy seeing me naked, but if it\u2019s going to be, at least it\u2019s a guy I\u2019ve known almost my entire life.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Noah snorted. \u201cI\u2019ll be looking at Lauren, thank you very much.\u201d</p><p>The lighthearted banter did a lot to ease Lauren\u2019s nerves. Her shoulders relaxed. But she still peeked at both of them because now that they\u2019d had the discussion, how on earth did they proceed? Surely sex wasn\u2019t usually this orchestrated.</p><p>\u201cCome here, Lauren,\u201d Liam said, extending his hand.</p><p>Apparently he had no such issues about where to begin.</p> <p>As soon as she slid her fingers through his, he pulled her toward him and into his lap until she straddled it.</p><p>\u201cThe first thing I\u2019m going to do is undress you,\u201d Liam said, his voice deep and husky, whispering over her skin like the most glorious of caresses. \u201cBut I wouldn\u2019t deprive Noah of the pleasure, so we\u2019ll split the duty.\u201d</p><p>She shivered with anticipation.</p><p>He ran his fingers underneath the thin straps of her top and slid them upward until they perched atop her shoulders. Slowly, he pulled them downward and then leaned his dark head over to kiss the curve of her neck.</p><p>\u201cSo beautiful,\u201d he murmured.</p> <p>As if changing his mind about the way he wanted to undress her, he reached for the hem of her cami and carefully began to lift it, uncovering her bare skin as the material slid upward.</p><p>\u201cRaise your arms,\u201d he said huskily.</p><p>She lifted her arms, and he pulled the top upward until it skimmed over her face and finally came free of her head. She lowered her arms so he could pull the straps away, and then he dropped the shirt to the floor.</p><p>She was bare. Starkly vulnerable. His gaze feasted on her, and then he leaned in to kiss the side of her neck. His teeth grazed lightly, and then he nipped with a little more force until she moaned and swayed in his lap.</p><p>Then his hands covered her belly and slowly moved upward to cup her breasts. She sucked in her breath, overwhelmed by her body\u2019s response to his hands covering her flesh.</p><p>Her nipples hardened painfully and when he brushed his thumbs over them in tandem, she let out a breathy sigh and arched toward him, her head going back.</p> <p>And then Noah was there, his hands gathered in her hair as he leaned in to kiss her neck on the opposite side of where Liam\u2019s mouth had just been.</p><p>He nuzzled up to her ear and then licked the lobe before sucking it into his mouth. A full-body shiver erupted, and then Liam\u2019s mouth found one of her nipples.</p><p>Electric. Oh God, her body was supersensitive to their every touch. Anticipation heightened her senses. She could smell them, their rich masculinity. She could hear and feel every breath that passed their lips. Hot on her skin.</p><p>Noah slid his hands underneath her armpits and gently lifted upward just as Liam curled his hands around her legs to propel her upward.</p><p>She was on her feet, in front of them both. Noah turned her to face him, and he reached for the tie of her pajama bottoms, unlacing it slowly. So slowly it was driving her insane.</p><p>When it was undone, he paused, found her gaze and stared intently into her eyes.</p><p>\u201cBefore we go any further, Lauren, I want you to promise me that if we do anything you\u2019re uncomfortable with, you\u2019ll tell us immediately. It\u2019s not going to piss us off. We want this to be perfect for you. We don\u2019t want to frighten or overwhelm you.\u201d</p><p>Her heart ached at the sincerity in his voice. She trembled in front of him, overwhelmed\u2014yes, overwhelmed\u2014by the moment. But she wouldn\u2019t tell them that, because it was the best kind of being overwhelmed.</p> <p>\u201cI promise,\u201d she said, not recognizing her voice.</p><p>It was hoarse and husky, the sound of a satisfied woman confident in her lovers\u2019 ability to pleasure her.</p><p>Noah pulled at the bottoms and eased them down her legs, leaving her in just a lacy pair of panties. Then he pulled her to him, his arms encircling her as his mouth found her breast.</p><p>He sucked gently at one taut nipple and it hardened even further. Then he moved to the other and drew a lazy circle around it with his tongue before sucking it into his mouth as he\u2019d done the other.</p><p>His hands slid down the small of her back, delving underneath the band of her underwear. And then lower, dragging the silky material downward. He let it drop to her feet, and she was completely bare to both men\u2019s gazes.</p><p>\u201cGet onto the bed, honey,\u201d Noah said in a low voice.</p><p>Even as he spoke, he guided her to where he wanted her. Right between where he and Liam still sat on the edge of the bed.</p><p>He got up then as she sat, and Liam loomed over her, easing her down to her back.</p><p>\u201cSpread your legs,\u201d Noah whispered. \u201cI want to taste you so bad, I ache.\u201d</p><p>She hesitated a moment, suddenly self-conscious at the idea of being laid out and spread wide. Liam\u2019s hand glided down her belly and she tensed when it brushed softly over the apex of her legs and then between them, gently parting her thighs.</p><p>\u201cRelax, baby,\u201d Liam encouraged. \u201cLet us make you feel good.\u201d</p><p>She let her thighs fall open, aided by Liam. When she looked down, Noah had gone to his knees between her splayed legs.</p><p>Liam shifted farther up her body, and his hand left her thigh and smoothed up her belly to cup one breast and then the other. He caressed and toyed with her nipples, teasing them to rigid points.</p><p>And then Noah\u2019s fingers gently parted her folds, opening her further to him. He brushed over her clit, down to her entrance and then back up again.</p><p>Liam leaned over her, his dark head obscuring her view of Noah as he licked at her nipple. Her body tightened, bowed. She flexed and arched. It seemed she was going in a dozen different directions and had no control over her body.</p><p>The moment Noah\u2019s mouth touched her, she cried out. Her hand flew to Liam\u2019s head, twisting in his hair. Soft and silky, the wild mane of hair flowed over her fingers.</p><p>Liam sucked and nipped, alternating between her breasts. Noah\u2019s tongue glided over her clit, teasing and bringing her closer to the edge.</p><p>He moved lower, bestowing tiny kisses to every part of her pussy, and when he reached her opening, he licked delicately at first and then grew bolder, plunging his tongue inside, sucking and tasting her intimately.</p><p>\u201cNoah!\u201d she cried.</p><p>Even as she called out his name, she pulled at Liam\u2019s hair in a silent beg for him to stop. She was already on the brink of her orgasm and she didn\u2019t want it to end. Not this soon!</p><p>Liam and Noah both halted simultaneously.</p><p>\u201cDid I hurt you?\u201d Noah demanded.</p><p>She could barely pull together her thoughts. She was so painfully on edge that if he so much as touched her again, she was going to come. She sucked in steadying breaths, her hand still tightly fisted in Liam\u2019s hair.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said hoarsely. \u201cGod no. I\u2019m about to come. It\u2019s too soon!\u201d</p><p>Noah laughed softly. \u201cWe\u2019ve got all night, sweetheart. Let yourself come. Then we\u2019ll start all over again.\u201d</p><p>Liam lifted his head and she loosened her hold. He moved upward, capturing her mouth in a heated kiss that told her just how aroused he was. For several long moments, he ravaged her mouth, tasting every inch of her lips, delving deep with his tongue until she was breathless.</p><p>\u201cI promise there\u2019ll be another,\u201d Liam said as he dragged his mouth away. \u201cBecause I want a taste of what Noah\u2019s getting right now.\u201d</p><p>She went limp, helpless against the seduction of their words.</p><p>\u201cI like your hand in my hair,\u201d Liam said as he lowered his head back to her breast.</p><p>She was only too willing to thrust her fingers back into the silken mass as his mouth closed around her nipple. Noah slid one finger inside her and she arched into it, wanting more, wanting deeper.</p><p>Then his mouth returned to her clit and he rolled his tongue in a lazy circle around the rigid bud.</p><p>Her free hand curled into the sheets, digging into the mattress as she fisted the material. Her breathing sped up, and the hand in Liam\u2019s hair tightened until she knew she had to be causing him pain.</p><p>He only sucked harder.</p><p>Noah added a second finger, sliding deep. But he was so gentle. There was no roughness to his penetration.</p><p>Her breath caught and held. The dual sensation of their mouths on her most sensitive pleasure points was devastating and exquisite. The most wonderful kind of torture.</p><p>Tension built. Every muscle tightened. Pleasure radiated through her body. Hot. Swelling. Building. Higher and higher.</p><p>Noah increased the pressure of his tongue, withdrew his fingers and plunged again. Liam nipped more sharply at her nipples.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t stop!\u201d she begged.</p><p>\u201cNever,\u201d Liam growled.</p><p>Her hips rolled and she bowed painfully upward to meet Noah\u2019s mouth, wanting more. Her body was begging for release, and they were determined to give her all she could take.</p><p>Just when she didn\u2019t think she could take any more, her orgasm flashed, swelling and rushing through her like a windstorm.</p><p>She knew she cried out. She was thinking their names. It was all that was in her mind except for pleasure so sweet she thought she could die of it.</p><p>She arched one last time and then fell back to the bed, her strength gone, her body so limp and sated that it was impossible to move.</p><p>She moaned softly when Noah withdrew his fingers and then replaced them with his mouth. He slid his tongue inward, working her slowly down from the explosion of her release. He continued to lick and kiss her softly until she sighed and quivered.</p><p>So boneless she thought she might never move again, she stroked her fingers through Liam\u2019s hair before letting her arm fall limply to the bed.</p><p>Liam drew away, propped on his elbow and then looked down at her as he rubbed his hand over her belly. Noah crawled onto the bed on the other side of her and positioned himself similarly to Liam, his hand joining Liam\u2019s to caress her.</p><p>\u201cHow was that?\u201d Noah asked in a husky voice.</p><p>\u201cMmm,\u201d she managed to get out.</p><p>Liam chuckled. \u201cThat good, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm hmm.\u201d</p><p>Noah leaned over to kiss her, his lips curved into a smile. She could taste herself on him, an odd experience, but she found she didn\u2019t mind.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s only the beginning,\u201d he whispered against her mouth.</p><p>Chapter 14</p><p>LAUREN lay back atop the mattress, Noah and Liam on either side of her, caressing her with gentle motions.</p><p>After a moment, Liam shifted, pushed himself upward and then off the bed. Her eyes widened when he lifted her feet to prop her heels on the metal bedframe for leverage. The position allowed her thighs to spread wider and then he knelt, as Noah had done so that her pussy was right on level with his mouth.</p><p>She moaned, a sound that started more vocal and ended in a long, breathy sigh. She was still sensitive from the first mind-bending orgasm and at the first touch of his tongue, her muscles jerked and locked, stiffening her legs.</p><p>She reached blindly upward and came into contact with Noah\u2019s shoulder. He lowered himself over her upper body and slid his palm over her rib cage toward her breasts.</p><p>\u201cBeautiful,\u201d he whispered just as he closed his lips around one nipple.</p><p>The room grew hazy around her. She floated in a sea of pleasure, her body tightening as she began the long, slow climb to release once more.</p><p>The sounds of satisfaction that Liam made heightened her arousal. His mouth vibrated against her most intimate flesh while his tongue danced wickedly over her clit and then down to slide inside her opening.</p><p>It was odd that she could tell the two men apart and how different their styles of making love were. She wouldn\u2019t have imagined there being such a difference and yet she could tell instantly by the way they touched her or kissed who was who, and yet both were deliciously talented at making her respond.</p><p>Liam rocked upward, his mouth pressing to her belly, and he kissed a line toward her chin. Noah pulled away and Liam captured her mouth, his tongue delving deeply.</p><p>\u201cI want to be inside you, baby,\u201d he growled in a low whisper. \u201cYou make me crazy.\u201d</p><p>She smiled faintly. After one orgasm, and she was precariously close to another, she could safely say that they made her crazy. She couldn\u2019t even think. Only feel. And she loved the way they made her feel.</p><p>Protected. Cherished. Cared for.</p><p>They silenced the ghosts of her past when they were near. They put themselves between her and those painful memories, a buffer to anything that would hurt her.</p><p>\u201cLet me get a condom,\u201d Liam whispered against her mouth.</p><p>She touched his face, kissed him back and then slowly let him go, his gaze burning into her as he withdrew. He hastily pulled his shirt over his head, leaving her to admire his ink again. He was just as quick to peel his jeans down and take off the remainder of his clothing. A moment later he was between her thighs again, his fingers testing her readiness.</p><p>He teased the line from her opening to her clit and then back down again, feathering around her entrance.</p><p>Noah drew one nipple into his mouth, sucking firmly until it was a rigid peak. Then he gave the other equal treatment until her breasts were plump and swollen, her nipples erect and puckered. Then he kissed the valley between her breasts and gently worked his mouth up to her neck as Liam positioned himself between her legs.</p><p>The head of Liam\u2019s cock breached her entrance and for a moment he remained still, allowing her to adjust to his size. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She hadn\u2019t gotten a look at him from her position on the bed. All she\u2019d been able to see was his chest and the intricate tattoos on his upper body. She had no idea of his size, but he felt enormous as he pushed in farther, stretching her with every movement.</p><p>She wiggled, angling her lower body so she could take him deeper. It was instinctive to wrap her legs around his waist even though it wasn\u2019t something Joel ever allowed. He preferred that she lay motionless while he did as he liked.</p><p>She shook off the fleeting memory, determined not to let it intrude here where it didn\u2019t belong.</p><p>\u201cHow does it feel, Lauren?\u201d Noah asked in a husky voice.</p> <p>Her eyelids flickered and she looked up to meet his gaze, overwhelmed by the moment. The sheer magnitude of having these two men . . . worship her. They treated her like she was . . . precious.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>His brow crinkled in confusion. \u201cWhy what, honey?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy me?\u201d</p><p>He smoothed his fingers over her brow, easing the lines. Then he kissed her, long and sweet, until she knew nothing but the sensation of Liam deep inside her body and Noah deep inside her mouth.</p> <p>\u201cBecause there can\u2019t be anyone else for us,\u201d Noah said as he pulled from her lips.</p><p>Liam\u2019s hands slid underneath her ass, lifting as he pushed even deeper. He leaned over her, holding her close to his body before finally releasing her to plant his hands on the mattress on either side of her hips.</p><p>He thrust harder, and she closed her eyes, reaching for Noah again. Just wanting to touch him. With her other hand, she slid her fingers over the top of Liam\u2019s hand where it rested on the bed. And she held on to them both while Liam continued to power into her body.</p><p>She knew he was holding back. There were stress lines on his face. His jaw was tight and his thrusts became more measured.</p><p>She smiled and reached up to touch his face.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t hold back, Liam. I want to see you when you come.\u201d</p> <p>He groaned and let out a long breath. \u201cOh God, baby, I wanted to make you come again. I didn\u2019t want it to be over so soon. But you feel so damn good and I\u2019ve waited so long for this.\u201d</p><p>She put a finger to his mouth. \u201cWe have all night. Isn\u2019t that what Noah said? We\u2019ll do it all over again.\u201d</p><p>He smiled when she turned the words back on him. Then he lowered himself even further as Noah pulled back, allowing him the room. Liam gathered her tightly in his arms and then flexed his hips, driving deep.</p><p>Faster and harder. He picked up speed and thrust more forcefully. He hugged her tighter, holding her so close she could barely breathe, but she\u2019d never felt safer or more . . . loved.</p><p>Then he buried himself deep and remained there, his entire body quivering, his hips jerking spasmodically. He nuzzled into her neck and his breath exploded against her skin as he lay there panting softly.</p><p>Even as Liam covered her, completely possessing her, Noah\u2019s hand found hers where it was sprawled away from Liam. And he curled his fingers around hers, stroking over her palm. Letting her know that he was there. With her. Just as Liam was.</p><p>She was touched beyond measure at the gesture. It was symbolic. A silent promise. Tears gathered in her eyes. Had she finally found what she\u2019d searched for for so long?</p><p>Liam kissed her cheek and then the corner of her mouth before finally pushing himself upward so she no longer bore his weight. Then he carefully withdrew and stepped aside to discard the condom.</p> <p>Her gaze immediately went to Noah. She wanted to give him that same pleasure. She wanted it for herself. Their gazes connected and he leaned in to kiss her again, almost as if offering her reassurance.</p><p>He crawled off the bed. She watched as he undressed, determined to get a better view of him than she had Liam. She propped herself up on her elbows so she was able to see.</p><p>The ripple of muscles was impressive. He wasn\u2019t as thick or as large as Liam, but he was every bit as muscled and toned. Just different body structure and build. Damn but he was so very nice to look at.</p><p>When he got his pants off and tore off his boxers, she took his erection, mentally comparing him to Liam. Liam had certainly felt . . . huge. But Noah? Looked huge.</p><p>The two men stood at the edge of the bed, Liam\u2019s gaze soft and satisfied while Noah\u2019s glittered with hunger. She shivered, licking her lips in anticipation.</p><p>To her surprise, Noah reached for her, turning her over onto her belly. Her cheek brushed over the sheet and for a moment she was too stunned to react.</p><p>This wasn\u2019t what she\u2019d expected.</p><p>Unease stole over her. For a moment she was too muddled to even realize why she was gripped by such discomfort.</p><p>It was instinctive for her to be wary, and to fight. Her first instinct was to fight?</p><p>Noah\u2019s hands slid up the backs of her legs and he kissed the cheek of her ass, and then the other, nipping playfully.</p><p>She tried to reason with herself. Tried to be calm. This was Noah. Noah would never hurt her.</p><p>But the position was a symbol of helplessness to her. And she hated that feeling above all others. She didn\u2019t want to be scared when Noah made love to her.</p><p>Then he spread her thighs, and all reason fled. There was no fighting the surge of panic. Her throat swelled with it until she nearly choked.</p><p>His grip tightened and in her disoriented state, all she could process was that she was being held down. Pinned. Helpless.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d she choked out around a sob.</p><p>Even as the word exploded into the quiet, she was already kicking. The hands left her and she rolled away, against the wall. She put her back to it and curled her knees protectively against her chest.</p><p>She put her head down until her forehead touched her knees. All her most vulnerable parts were covered. Her stomach and ribs. Her face was hidden.</p><p>Because she knew what happened when she said no. There was always instant retaliation. It was a testament to just how afraid she\u2019d been that the word had even escaped her lips.</p><p>Chapter 15</p><p>NOAH stared down in horror\u2014and shock\u2014as Lauren curled herself into a protective ball and huddled as far away from him as she could on the bed.</p><p>Her back was to the wall. It was a practiced move. It gutted him that this was something she\u2019d obviously had to do before.</p><p>He honest to God wanted to puke.</p><p>Liam started forward but Noah put his hand out. When Liam turned to glare at him, Noah shook his head.</p><p>\u201cI did this,\u201d Noah said in a low voice he doubted Lauren even heard.</p><p>\u201cGoddamn it, Noah,\u201d Liam bit out. \u201cYou heard what he did to her that last time. He put her on her belly so she couldn\u2019t fight him off, and then he held her down and raped her. She told us she hated that position. What were you thinking?\u201d</p><p>Noah closed his eyes. He understood Liam\u2019s anger. Noah was furious with himself. But this wasn\u2019t the time to hash it out with his friend. Not when Lauren was in a protective ball because she was afraid of being hurt.</p><p>He held up his finger to Liam and shook his head once more. Then he crawled onto the bed, his gut in knots.</p><p>He hesitated, his hand hovering over her shoulder, afraid to touch her. He couldn\u2019t bear for her to flinch away. The idea that she was expecting pain and humiliation instead of the pleasure he\u2019d so wanted to give her made him sick to his soul.</p><p>\u201cLauren,\u201d he whispered. \u201cHoney, look at me please. I\u2019m not going to hurt you. I\u2019d never hurt you.\u201d</p><p>Gingerly, he let his hand rest on her shoulder. She tensed but she didn\u2019t flinch away or recoil. Her hair completely hid what little of her face that would have been visible, and he pushed it back, trying anything to calm her panic.</p><p>Liam sat on the bed and scooted until he was opposite Noah. His hand shook when he lifted it to Lauren\u2019s dark head. He rested it on the back of her head and let it glide down to her nape.</p><p>\u201cLauren?\u201d Noah prompted again. \u201cWill you please look at me?\u201d</p><p>Gradually, she lifted her head from her knees. Liam smoothed her hair back with both hands. He pulled it away from her face and made gentle, repetitive motions as if he were forming a ponytail, but Noah knew he was soothing her much like he would a wounded animal.</p><p>When she lifted her gaze to meet his, her eyes were dull with embarrassment and the remnants of fear. It made his chest ache.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she whispered hoarsely. \u201cI just panicked. I couldn\u2019t make it go away. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>Noah swallowed back the rage that threatened to explode out of him. Now wasn\u2019t the time. He had to handle this just right or he\u2019d never get her back. She\u2019d never trust him. He couldn\u2019t afford to fuck this up.</p><p>\u201cWill you let me hold you?\u201d he asked softly.</p><p>She hesitated a moment\u2014the longest moment of Noah\u2019s life\u2014before she finally made a move toward him.</p><p>It was shaky and hesitant, but with Liam\u2019s help, she uncurled herself and then got to her knees. But she didn\u2019t launch herself into Noah\u2019s arms. She simply knelt there, glancing anxiously at him.</p><p>\u201cCome here, sweetheart,\u201d he said, pulling her into his arms.</p><p>He gathered her naked body against his and wrapped as much of himself around her as he could get. He held her tightly against his heart, rocking back and forth as he kissed every inch of her face.</p><p>\u201cYou will not apologize to me for this,\u201d he said fiercely. \u201cIt\u2019s my goddamn fault and it\u2019s me who needs to be on my knees in front of you begging you to forgive me and give me another chance. I\u2019m so sorry, Lauren. I wouldn\u2019t frighten you for the world. I\u2019d do anything at all for you to never be afraid again.\u201d</p><p>He kissed the top of her head, her hair. He couldn\u2019t get enough of her. He wanted to absorb her right into his soul.</p><p>\u201cPlease look at me. Say something. Just as long as it\u2019s not an apology.\u201d</p><p>She lifted her head again and stared back at him, tears swimming in her eyes. His stomach plummeted. It felt like someone kicked him right in the balls. He certainly deserved it.</p><p>\u201cLauren, I\u2019m sorry. Me. I ruined what was the most beautiful moment I\u2019ve ever experienced. I ruined it for you. I ruined it for Liam. And I damn sure ruined it for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was the one who let him back in,\u201d she said painfully. \u201cI was so determined to keep him out, to keep the past in the past and not let it intrude on tonight. I knew you wouldn\u2019t hurt me, Noah. Please believe that. I never once thought that you would do anything I didn\u2019t want. But even knowing that, panic took over and I couldn\u2019t control what I did. My heart screamed that you would never hurt me and my mind just took over and shut me down.\u201d</p><p>Noah positioned her so that she straddled his lap and he could look her in the eyes. He cupped her face, stroking her soft, sweet skin as he searched for just the right thing to say.</p><p>Fuck it all, but he didn\u2019t know what to say. He could only be honest. He screwed up.</p><p>\u201cHoney, you can not blame yourself for this. I did a stupid thing. It would be one thing if I hadn\u2019t known what happened, but you told us. I just didn\u2019t think. I wanted you so badly and I wanted to touch every inch of you. I wanted my hands and mouth on you and I wanted my dick inside you. And maybe in the back of my mind I thought I could replace those bad memories with good ones, that I could show you how it could be with someone who cares about you. It was arrogant and stupid of me. I was too caught up in the moment and I didn\u2019t stop to think how it was affecting you. I\u2019m sorry. I should have made damn sure you were with me every second of the way.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed and her gaze went all shiny and wet again.</p><p>\u201cI wanted all of that too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you did,\u201d he said gently. \u201cI fucked up. Not you.\u201d</p><p>She leaned until her forehead met his. Her mouth was tantalizingly close, but he reined himself in, refusing to make a single move until she issued the invitation.</p><p>Then she wrapped her arms loosely around his neck. He put his own around her waist, resisting the urge to haul her up against him until neither of them could breathe.</p><p>\u201cGuess we have a lot to learn about this threesome thing,\u201d she breathed.</p><p>He smiled. \u201cYeah, honey, I guess we do. But you know what? We\u2019ll figure it out. Together.\u201d</p><p>She turned then, her gaze seeking Liam out. He was perched on the edge of the bed, his gaze intently focused on what was going on between Noah and Lauren.</p><p>She extended her hand to him and he readily took it.</p><p>Then she glanced back to Noah. \u201cAre you both sure this is what you want? Me? Us? Together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn straight,\u201d Liam growled before Noah could respond.</p><p>Noah took more time, gauging the expression on Lauren\u2019s face. He searched for reluctance or regret. Second thoughts. Anything to hint that she was looking for a way out.</p><p>He touched her cheek, rubbing his knuckle down to her jaw.</p><p>\u201cI think the more important question is whether you\u2019re sure this is what you want.\u201d</p><p>She nodded solemnly. \u201cIt is. I am. Just be patient with me. I can\u2019t promise not to freak out again. I don\u2019t want to. I don\u2019t want to give that bastard any power over me, but it doesn\u2019t appear that I have a choice.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The sadness in her voice was Noah\u2019s undoing. He gathered her in his arms, forcing her to break contact with Liam. He held her so tightly he was probably hurting her, but he wanted to tell her with more than just words what he felt.</p><p>\u201cI promise we have all the time in the world,\u201d he said gruffly. \u201cOne day at a time. There\u2019s no hurry, honey. We\u2019ll get that bastard out of your head. Just give it time. And give us time. You talk about us being patient with you, but sweetheart, I\u2019m the one fucking up over here. Promise that you\u2019ll be patient with me, and I\u2019ll do my damnedest to make you happy.\u201d</p><p>She lay her head against his shoulder and buried her face in his neck.</p><p>\u201cI think we\u2019ll both make our share of mistakes. I just have to recondition myself not to expect violence as a result of a mistake I make.\u201d</p> <p>Noah closed his eyes, his teeth clenched so tightly that his jaw hurt. When he reopened them, he saw the same rage in Liam\u2019s expression.</p><p>How could anyone hurt such a beautiful, sweet woman? Any woman? What kind of an asshole got off on controlling someone weaker than himself?</p><p>More than ever, Noah wanted to hunt that little bastard down and make him suffer for all the women he\u2019d ever hurt. He doubted Lauren was the first or that she\u2019d be the last.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll never receive violence from either of us,\u201d Noah said in a low voice. \u201cI may get mad as hell. Liam\u2019s got a black temper and he can be a moody son of a bitch.\u201d</p><p>Liam scowled at Noah in response.</p> <p>Noah chuckled. \u201cMy point is we can fight and argue and I\u2019m sure we will. But you don\u2019t ever have to worry about either of us physically retaliating. I\u2019m more of an air-my-grievance-and-get-over-it guy.\u201d</p><p>Lauren nodded, and he gently pried her away from his neck so that she could once more see him and Liam.</p><p>Liam reached forward to claim the hand he\u2019d held before, and Noah slid his hand up her arm to squeeze her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you understand, sweetheart? You\u2019re going to have us both so wrapped around your little finger, that I doubt there\u2019ll ever be that much disagreement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe plan to spoil you rotten and give you everything you could possibly ever want or need,\u201d Liam added gruffly.</p><p>Lauren smiled, chasing away the shadows in her eyes. Her gaze sparkled once more. No ghosts haunting from the past. No remnants of pain or shame.</p> <p>\u201cIs it wrong that I love the idea of having both of you wrapped around my finger?\u201d she asked, her voice so sweet that it made Noah want to groan.</p><p>Liam lifted her hand to kiss each finger in turn.</p><p>\u201cNot a damn thing wrong with that,\u201d Liam said, his tone resolute. \u201cIt\u2019s good you like the idea, because that is one thing you aren\u2019t going to have a single say in. We\u2019re going to spoil you rotten and we\u2019re going to enjoy every damn minute.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 16</p><p>TO Lauren\u2019s surprise, when she got out of the shower the next morning, both men were up, dressed and waiting in the living room for her.</p><p>Dawn hadn\u2019t even broken yet and the apartment was cloaked in darkness except for the lamp one of the men had turned on in the living room.</p><p>\u201cStill have half an hour before you have to show up for work. Want some breakfast here? Thought you might be tired of the same ole stuff at the diner,\u201d Noah said when she walked out of her bedroom.</p><p>She smiled. \u201cHonestly I don\u2019t normally eat the food there. I did at first, but you\u2019re right, it got old fast. It\u2019s good, don\u2019t get me wrong. But different is definitely better.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI make a mean breakfast taco,\u201d Noah said with a grin. \u201cI don\u2019t figure you have that on the diner menu.\u201d</p><p>Lauren laughed. \u201cNo, can\u2019t say we do. A breakfast taco sounds . . . intriguing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on then. Come sit at the table while I make it. Then Liam and I will take you to work. We\u2019re going to have a look around town today. We\u2019ll be checking in on you periodically. I also programmed both our cell numbers into your phone while you were in the shower. If you have any trouble, if you even think something\u2019s off or wrong, you call one of us immediately. Okay?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>Noah headed for the kitchen and Liam followed behind, taking Lauren\u2019s hand on his way by. She settled at the table with Liam while Noah banged around in her tiny kitchen for the stuff he needed.</p><p>Ten minutes later, he presented her and Liam with a flour tortilla shell he\u2019d fried brown in butter, filled with scrambled eggs, seared ham, and cheese with jalapenos and salsa.</p><p>Knowing it would be afternoon before she\u2019d get the opportunity to really talk with them, she spoke up while they were eating.</p><p>\u201cI handled last night all wrong,\u201d she said firmly.</p><p>They were going to argue. She could see it in their eyes. Especially Noah\u2019s. He got this fierce look on his face and his eyes filled with self-condemnation all over again.</p><p>She sighed and held up her hand to stop the flow before it began.</p><p>\u201cYou guys did everything right. I overreacted. I did. You were very honest and up front with me. You told me explicitly that if you did anything I wasn\u2019t comfortable with to tell you and that you\u2019d stop immediately. It should have been that simple. All I had to do was tell you I didn\u2019t like what was happening.\u201d</p><p>Noah shook his head, but she held up her hand again.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to turn it into another huge ordeal. I just thought that I owed you that at least. I got scared. I overreacted in the moment. That doesn\u2019t mean that you did anything wrong. It just means that we hit a bump in the road. And as you said, we\u2019ll get past it. I promise not to beat myself up about it, if you promise not to beat yourself up over it,\u201d she said pointedly, staring Noah down as she spoke.</p><p>Liam\u2019s lips twitched and he stuffed a bite of taco in his mouth, probably to stanch his laughter.</p><p>Noah opened his mouth, then promptly shut it. Then he nodded. \u201cDeal.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cOkay, I need to get to work now.\u201d</p><p>Noah rose, quickly clearing the plates away while Liam headed into the living room. He had his back to her when she came in on his heels, and when he turned, he was putting on a shoulder harness with a pistol. He reached for his leather jacket draped over the back of the armchair and pulled it on to cover the gun.</p><p>It was a sharp jolt of reality. She may be immersed in the fantasy of having two hot guys in her bed and in her life, but the reality was that they were here to protect her from a man who had no compunction about hurting her.</p><p>It was a sobering thought, and some of her good mood evaporated.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t look like that, baby,\u201d Liam said. \u201cIt\u2019s only here for your protection. So Joel Knight can never touch you again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cI guess I just want to be able to forget about him for a while, and every time I think I can, I\u2019m reminded in some way of why I\u2019m here and why you\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>He pushed into her space and pulled her into his arms.</p><p>\u201cI hate the circumstances that put us together, but baby? I don\u2019t regret the result for one minute. I wish we could have met under other conditions, but I\u2019ll take you however I can get you. And if it means having to keep a close watch over you, I\u2019ll just count that as a bonus.\u201d</p><p>She hugged him to her, her mood lightening once more. Liam had a way of reaching in and wiping away the darkness that occupied certain portions of her mind.</p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d Noah asked from the doorway to the kitchen.</p><p>Lauren pulled away and turned in his direction. \u201cReady.\u201d</p><p>IT was a busy morning in the diner. Mondays typically were. It was as if everyone wanted to get out to see what the weekend gossip was. Tuesday mornings were always dead. Definitely her worst tip day of her schedule for sure.</p><p>The Colters and even her own brother usually made it in on her shift at least once a week, and they always left ridiculously large tips. After the first couple of times of arguing with them, she finally had saved her breath.</p><p>They loved her and they used any opportunity they found to take care of her. It was nice to have that kind of unconditional support.</p><p>Liam and Noah had garnered much attention. The townspeople hadn\u2019t even bothered trying to be subtle. They stared while Noah and Liam had a cup of coffee at the start of Lauren\u2019s shift. They stared when the two men left and returned a couple of hours later.</p><p>And when Seth ambled in close to eleven for a cup of coffee, two people made a beeline for him to warn him about the big strangers lurking at the diner. Lauren had stifled her laughter as Seth had patiently explained that Noah and Liam were good men and that Seth knew them personally.</p><p>\u201cEverything going okay, Lauren?\u201d Seth asked as she set his coffee down at his table.</p><p>She smiled. \u201cJust fine. Typical Monday.\u201d</p><p>Seth rolled his eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re telling me. Your protectors have made quite a stir in town. They\u2019ve been spotted all over Clyde and now the good denizens are convinced that they\u2019re hit men. Believe me when I say, our receptionist has been fielding calls all morning and I\u2019ve been stopped on the street, been flagged down in my patrol car and have even gotten calls on my cell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh I\u2019m sorry, Seth,\u201d Lauren said. \u201cThis has to be a giant pain in your butt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not complaining, honey. I want you safe. It\u2019s just life in a small town, and it should make you feel better that so many people are concerned about you. It should also make you feel better to know that if some stranger shows his face here, we\u2019ll definitely know about it.\u201d</p><p>She gave him a rueful smile. \u201cThat\u2019s true. Joel would arrive in his flashy sports car and before he got out, the entire town would know about it.\u201d</p><p>Seth laughed. \u201cYou\u2019re so right there. There are drawbacks to living in such a small community, but the plusses far outweigh the minuses. We have good people here,\u201d he said seriously. \u201cI\u2019ve known them all my life. I wouldn\u2019t want to live anywhere else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love it here too,\u201d she said wistfully.</p><p>She looked up when the bell over the front door jangled, and then she lit up. \u201cOh look! Callie and Lily are here!\u201d</p><p>Before Seth could respond, Lauren hurried to greet the other two women.</p><p>They hugged her as soon as she got close.</p><p>\u201cAre you here for lunch?\u201d Lauren asked her friends.</p><p>\u201cI see my husband is here,\u201d Lily murmured. \u201cFigures when I make an escape with Callie, he has to be here instead of at work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t look now, but here he comes,\u201d Callie said with a snicker. \u201cHe has a frown. You know, one of those concerned husbandly frowns.\u201d</p><p>Lily sighed. \u201cSeat us, Lauren. Far, far away from wherever Seth is sitting, please.\u201d</p><p>Lauren giggled and pulled the two women in the opposite direction as Seth. She settled the two women in a booth that only accommodated two people and overlooked the street. It was a beautiful, sunny spring day and the sun was shining against a brilliant blue sky.</p><p>The town square and Main Street truly were beautiful in the spring. Flowers lined the square and the street, and there was a quaintness that spoke to Lauren\u2019s longing for a place to call home.</p><p>\u201cLadies,\u201d Seth said as he approached.</p><p>He leaned down to kiss his wife, and then he brushed his lips across Callie\u2019s cheek.</p><p>\u201cHow are you feeling, baby?\u201d he asked Lily softly.</p><p>She smiled up at her husband. For all her exasperation, it was obvious she adored him, and well, Seth always looked at Lily like the sun rose and set at her feet.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. Dillon cooked breakfast but I knew I was eating with Callie, so I didn\u2019t eat much. I left him at the house grumbling because I wouldn\u2019t take him along, so he went into the office to do some stuff for work. I\u2019ll ride back home with him when I\u2019m done.\u201d</p><p>Seth nodded approvingly. \u201cGood. You shouldn\u2019t be driving up and down the mountain alone. You\u2019re not that far from your delivery date.\u201d</p><p>Lily snorted. \u201cTwo months, Seth. Believe me when I say two months is an eternity when you\u2019re as big as a house.\u201d</p><p>Callie and Lauren laughed.</p><p>\u201cHave you taken a break yet, Lauren?\u201d Lily asked. \u201cCan you sit with us a few minutes?\u201d</p><p>Lauren checked her watch, then scanned the crowd. It was starting to quiet just a bit. The people of Clyde liked their lunch early, and so there was always an initial rush at eleven when lunch was starting to be served, but things usually quieted down by eleven thirty.</p><p>\u201cLet me check with Clark and Evie and make sure there\u2019s someone to cover my tables. I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p><p>Seth leaned over to kiss Lily again. \u201cI\u2019ve got to get back to the station. I\u2019ll see you later.\u201d</p><p>Lily and Callie waved Seth off as Lauren hurried to the back. She nearly ran into Evie as she walked into the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cHow are things looking back here?\u201d she asked Clark.</p><p>\u201cGetting the last two dinners up. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas going to take my break if we\u2019re caught up.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Evie shooed her away. \u201cGo on and take it. I\u2019ll hit your tables for any refills. You\u2019re caught up on your deliveries. As soon as I take my two out, I\u2019ll be caught up and I\u2019ll take any newcomers that walk in.\u201d</p><p>Lauren flashed a grin. \u201cThanks, Evie. You\u2019re the best.\u201d</p><p>Clark gave them both indulgent smiles. \u201cYou two are the best waitresses I\u2019ve ever had. Can\u2019t begrudge you a break. You\u2019ve earned it. We\u2019ve been busting ass since opening time this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTypical Monday,\u201d Evie said with a shrug.</p> <p>Lauren turned and hurried back to where Lily and Callie sat. She snagged a chair from a nearby empty table and parked it at the end of the two-person booth.</p><p>\u201cSo what are you two up to today? Just doing lunch? And where is Mama C?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s baby shopping. In Denver,\u201d Callie added. \u201cWhich means the dads went with her because they still won\u2019t let her drive pretty much anywhere by herself. She\u2019s decided she needs to outfit an entire nursery at her house for when the baby stays over.\u201d</p><p>Lauren chuckled. \u201cI can only imagine.\u201d</p><p>Lily smiled. \u201cShe\u2019s been so wonderful to me. She\u2019s already explained that she\u2019s coming to stay with me for the entire week after the baby is born and that I won\u2019t have to lift a single finger. She\u2019s barked orders at the men. Dillon is on cooking duty. Michael and Seth are sharing diaper changing and bottle-feeding when I need a break from breast-feeding.\u201d</p> <p>Lily grew misty eyed. \u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do without her. Or the entire Colter family. Even the dads have volunteered to come over so Seth, Dillon and Michael can get some rest. I can\u2019t even explain how much just knowing that they\u2019ll be right there, for however we need them, means to me. It\u2019s like a huge weight off my shoulders.\u201d</p><p>Callie reached over to squeeze her hand. \u201cAnd you forget me and Max. We\u2019ll be right here whenever you need us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd me,\u201d Lauren piped up.</p><p>Lily smiled. \u201cYes of course. You\u2019ll be right here in the middle of all of us. It\u2019s a pretty wonderful place to be, you know.\u201d</p><p>Callie turned a purposeful stare in Lauren\u2019s direction. \u201cOkay, so, I\u2019ll fully admit, Lily and I came here with a purpose, and we also waited until Noah and Liam left before we came in because we wanted to corner you and interrogate you mercilessly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-oh,\u201d Lauren muttered.\u201d</p> <p>Lily laughed. \u201cYou have to tell us what\u2019s going on with those two. And don\u2019t give us the cock-and-bull story about how they\u2019re just protecting you until things are resolved with Joel. Because the way they look at you? Makes me shiver. There\u2019s definitely more to this story than you\u2019re letting on.\u201d</p><p>Lauren blushed, her face warming under their scrutiny.</p><p>\u201cI knew it!\u201d Callie crowed. \u201cLook at her face! Totally busted.\u201d</p><p>Lauren sighed. \u201cOkay, okay. Yes, there\u2019s something more than just a professional relationship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich one?\u201d Lily said, pouncing on the subject. \u201cMy money is on Liam. He\u2019s so dark and broody and delicious. And those tattoos. Yum. He totally reminds me of Dillon.\u201d</p><p>Callie shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m betting Noah. His gaze never leaves her. He\u2019s constantly watching her. Always looking for any kind of threat to her. But when he looks directly at her, I swear that man\u2019s eyes just smolder. If you could bottle that look? We could make millions. He is sex in a can, I\u2019m telling you.\u201d</p><p>Lauren burst out laughing. \u201cOh my God, you two are killing me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo which is it?\u201d Lily demanded.</p> <p>\u201cUhm, well . . . both,\u201d she said, dropping her voice so there was no chance of being overheard.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Callie squeaked. \u201cOh my God, you lucky bitch.\u201d</p><p>Lily\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cReally?</p><p>Lauren nodded.</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d Callie breathed. \u201cI swear I\u2019m the only one who took on one man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, can you imagine two of Max?\u201d Lily pointed out.</p><p>Callie rolled her eyes. \u201cNo kidding. I\u2019d never survive. Max is like having three men. Still, there are times when I look at you and I look at mom and I think, wow, that must be so awesome to have three men who absolutely worship and adore you. And now you, Lauren. You have two drop-dead gorgeous, stacked guys who want to spend every waking moment cherishing and protecting you? Jealousy is going to eat me alive.\u201d</p><p>Lauren blushed again. \u201cWe\u2019re still working through some stuff. I mean this is completely brand new to all three of us. None of us have experience in this and we\u2019re having to feel our way around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone of us had experience with it either,\u201d Lily said in a serious tone. \u201cI know it sounds crazy because of the way Seth, Michael and Dillon grew up, but they never considered for a moment that they\u2019d have the same kind of relationship their parents had. So when they met me, they had things they had to work out and we definitely had to be careful in the beginning. We\u2019re still working at it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it hard and stressful?\u201d Lauren asked.</p><p>Lily smiled. \u201cAt times it can be, but the good times far outweigh the bad, and I can\u2019t tell you how wonderful it is to have the love and devotion of three of the most terrific men I\u2019ve ever met. I feel like I\u2019m the luckiest woman in the world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel that way too,\u201d Lauren said quietly. \u201cIt scares me to death and yet it\u2019s thrilling all at the same time. I don\u2019t want to mess this up and for it not to work out.\u201d</p><p>Callie and Lily both reached for her hands.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll do just fine,\u201d Callie said, her expression fierce. \u201cThey\u2019re lucky to have you.\u201d</p><p>Lauren grinned. \u201cThat\u2019s what I love most about you guys. Even when I\u2019m wrong, you still take my side.\u201d</p><p>Callie sniffed. \u201cColters are never wrong. Just ask my mother.\u201d</p><p>They all laughed. Evie brought out Lily\u2019s and Callie\u2019s plates, and the two women began eating.</p><p>After a moment, Lauren reluctantly rose, knowing she needed to get back to her tables so Evie wasn\u2019t stuck covering the whole diner.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you two later, okay?\u201d</p><p>Callie and Lily both waved a fork at her, and Lauren headed back to her section of tables.</p><p>Chapter 17</p><p>LAUREN knew something was wrong the moment Liam and Noah entered the diner at the end of her shift. She met them just a few feet inside the doorway, anxious as she surveyed their expressions.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Liam touched her elbow. \u201cAre you finished?\u201d</p><p>She hesitated. \u201cI just need to go in back, put my apron up, collect tips and clock out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo on and get done,\u201d Noah said. \u201cWe\u2019ll wait for you here.\u201d</p><p>She hurried away, dread tightening her chest. She hated the flutter of anxiety that bubbled in her stomach. What could possibly have happened in the short time they\u2019d been gone?</p><p>She hastily untied her apron and threw it on the hook behind the kitchen door. Evie was already in the back counting out the totals, when Lauren hurried up.</p><p>\u201cIt was a good day, Lauren!\u201d Evie exclaimed.</p><p>Lauren tried to smile. \u201cI\u2019m going to clock out, okay? Think you\u2019ll be done by then?\u201d</p><p>Evie frowned. \u201cIs everything okay, hon?\u201d</p><p>Lauren nodded. \u201cYeah, just need to go. I, uh, have plans. That\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>Evie\u2019s expression eased and her eyes gleamed. \u201cAnything to do with those two hunky men who\u2019ve been hanging around all day?\u201d</p><p>Lauren pretended she didn\u2019t hear as she went to do her time card. She called out a good-bye to Clark and hoped that Evie would be done with the tips when she got back.</p><p>Evie pushed a stack of bills across the small counter when Lauren returned.</p><p>\u201cThere you go. Have fun and I\u2019ll see you tomorrow!\u201d</p><p>Lauren smiled brightly and pocketed the bills, not even bothering to count as she usually would.</p><p>\u201cSee you tomorrow,\u201d she said and headed out of the kitchen.</p><p>Liam and Noah were where she\u2019d left them. She didn\u2019t even worry over the scene they were causing. Every single person in the diner was staring hard at the two men, and even more so when they directed Lauren out the door to the street.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll talk in your apartment,\u201d Noah said grimly.</p><p>They flanked her as they crossed the street and she noted that their gazes were scanning the sidewalks in both directions as they hustled her toward the steps to her apartment.</p><p>Only when she unlocked her door and they were inside did they seem to relax. But even then she could feel the tension radiating off them in waves.</p><p>Noah paced a circle in the tiny living room. Liam just stood to the side, his face so tight she could bounce a brick off it.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re scaring me,\u201d she said.</p><p>Noah immediately stopped his pacing and then pulled her into a fierce hug.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. Sit down and we\u2019ll talk.\u201d</p><p>He guided her toward the couch and then took the seat next to her. Liam hunkered down into the armchair, but his expression hadn\u2019t eased.</p><p>Noah ran a hand through his hair. \u201cWe made some calls today. Just trying to discreetly get some information. We have to be careful with who we trust because of what you\u2019ve said about Joel having people on his payroll.\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cThe thing is, the whole reason we found out about Joel and that you\u2019d . . . misled us in the beginning was because we talked to a woman who I\u2019m guessing is one of his girls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe knew about me?\u201d Lauren whispered.</p><p>\u201cShe knew enough that you and Joel were an item. She ID\u2019d your photo and told us who Joel was. But she clammed up after that. Didn\u2019t want anything to do with us. That\u2019s when we came here to confront you with what we\u2019d learned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s wrong now?\u201d she asked with a frown. \u201cI don\u2019t understand. Does he know where I am?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s dead,\u201d Liam said bluntly.</p><p>All the blood drained from Lauren\u2019s face, and she swayed. Beside her, Noah cursed and wrapped his arm around her to steady her.</p><p>\u201cDamn it, Liam,\u201d Noah growled.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to her?\u201d Lauren whispered.</p><p>\u201cI spoke to a buddy of ours who\u2019s a detective at NYPD. We took a risk, but we feel he\u2019s trustworthy. In the course of our conversation, he informed us that this woman was found dead in her apartment. Someone beat her to death. It wasn\u2019t pretty. Time of death puts it a day after we spoke to her in her apartment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh God,\u201d Lauren moaned. She put her face in her hands, Noah\u2019s words echoing over and over in her mind.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean he knows where you are,\u201d Liam said. \u201cWhat it means, though, is that he likely knows we were asking questions about you and Joel Knight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe died because of me,\u201d Lauren said bleakly.</p><p>\u201cBullshit,\u201d Liam bit out.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cYou don\u2019t understand. I could have prevented this. It should have never happened.\u201d</p><p>Noah took her shoulders in his hands and turned her to face him. His expression was hard and focused. \u201cHow was it your fault, Lauren? Is there something you\u2019re not telling us? Now is not the time to be holding back anything. If you have information, then we need to goddamn well know about it.\u201d</p><p>She shook away his hands and stood. \u201cPlease. Just leave me alone for a minute. God, I need to think.\u201d</p><p>Without waiting for a response, she bolted from the living room into her bedroom. She closed the door and leaned heavily against it, her heart beating like the roar of a freight train.</p><p>Then she flew to the bed and lifted the mattress, reaching her hand frantically underneath it, reaching for the small memory card she\u2019d taped to the underside.</p><p>She tore at it, the tape finally giving away. The plastic chip fell into her hand and she shakily peeled the tape away, staring at it in her palm.</p><p>Oh God. This was her fault. That woman had died because Lauren hadn\u2019t had the courage to do what she should have done. How many other women had suffered because Lauren had only wanted to escape and to forget Joel Knight ever existed? And how selfish did it make her that she\u2019d been so wrapped up in her own survival that she hadn\u2019t given a single thought to women she could have protected and saved?</p><p>Poor little Lauren. So helpless and na\u00efve. So damn stupid. This time she wouldn\u2019t shake off the blame and tell herself that she\u2019d made mistakes and that everyone made them. She couldn\u2019t say that everything would be all right if she\u2019d only had a fresh start and could forget her past.</p><p>Her past was there. Unchangeable. No matter how much she might wish differently. And it was affecting the lives of others. Her own. The women Joel used and abused. Murdered.</p><p>Revulsion gripped her.</p><p>She could have prevented this if she\u2019d only been willing to stand up and do the right thing. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>How ashamed would her family be? The Colters were all about doing the right thing. Standing up against injustice. They\u2019d offered her unconditional support, but what had she offered them except lies and deception? What had she offered the women left to Joel\u2019s abuse and mistreatment?</p><p>How could she ever look them in the eye again?</p><p>She looked down again at the disk in her hand and she closed her fingers, gripping the plastic card until it cut into her palm.</p><p>It was time to get her damn head out of the sand. Joel wasn\u2019t going away. He wasn\u2019t going to stop what he was doing until someone stood up and took him down.</p> <p>No matter how terrified she was or how ashamed, it was time for her to be willing to bring him to justice. Even if it meant risking her own life to do it.</p><p>How could she move on with Liam and Noah, or immerse herself in the Colter family and surround herself with their support and her brother\u2019s support if she knew it was at the expense of so many other women?</p><p>There was no future for her until she laid her past to rest. And there was no way to put her past behind her until she faced her demons and had the courage to do what it was she needed to do. What she had to do.</p><p>Chapter 18</p><p>LIAM stared at Lauren\u2019s closed door, worry gnawing a hole in his gut. He glanced at Noah to see his friend\u2019s expression wasn\u2019t any better.</p> <p>\u201cWhat the fuck was that?\u201d Liam asked in a low voice.</p><p>Noah blew out his breath. \u201cShe\u2019s holding back something. She hasn\u2019t told us everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoddamn.\u201d He took a steadying breath. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t trust us yet.\u201d</p><p>Noah shot him a disgruntled look. \u201cDo you expect her to this quickly? It may not be so much an issue of her trusting as it may be something big. Something that terrifies her. Look at it from her perspective. We barge back into her life, bust her for lying to us, and \u2018oh by the way, we want a relationship with you.\u2019 It\u2019s a lot to take in such a short period of time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I get it,\u201d Liam muttered. \u201cWhat the fuck do we do now?\u201d</p><p>Before Noah could respond, the bedroom door opened and Lauren stepped out, her face drawn and blotchy. There was a look in her eyes that Liam didn\u2019t like. He couldn\u2019t even put his finger on what it was exactly, but the woman who\u2019d bolted into her bedroom was not the woman walking out right now. And that scared the shit out of him.</p> <p>\u201cLauren?\u201d he began hesitantly. Hell, he was at a loss for words. Not an affliction he usually suffered.</p><p>Her gaze skittered to him, and he was taken aback by the pain in her eyes. Worse than the pain was the fear that reflected in those soft brown eyes.</p><p>She was scared to death.</p><p>\u201cI have to go back to New York,\u201d she said, in a flat, emotionless voice.</p><p>Noah\u2019s complete what the fuck? look mirrored Liam\u2019s own reaction.</p><p>\u201cWhoa, wait a minute here,\u201d Liam said. \u201cWe need to talk, baby. Tell us what\u2019s going on.\u201d</p><p>She took a deep breath, squared her shoulders and then glanced to Noah, then back at Liam again.</p><p>\u201cI have to go back. Immediately.\u201d</p> <p>Noah finally found his tongue.</p><p>\u201cTell us why,\u201d he said bluntly.</p><p>Her lips trembled, and it was evident that she was clinging to her composure by the barest thread. One hand was fisted into a tight ball at her side and the other was shaking, her fingers quivering even when she tried to press it to her leg.</p><p>\u201cI have to go to the police,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cI know he has cops on his payroll, but I have to try. I can no longer stand here and do nothing. Someone has to stop him.\u201d</p><p>Liam could stand it no longer. He crossed the room and gently grasped Lauren\u2019s shoulders. \u201cCome sit down. Please? We\u2019ll talk it out. You tell us why you need to go to the police and we\u2019ll figure it out together, okay?\u201d</p><p>For a moment he thought she\u2019d argue, but then she sighed and let him walk her to the couch. Noah still stood by the coffee table, his brows drawn together in confusion\u2014and worry\u2014as Liam seated Lauren and then sat next to her.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is going on, Lauren?\u201d Noah asked.</p><p>Her balled fist was now in her lap, and slowly, she opened it until Liam could see a computer memory disk in her hand.</p><p>\u201cI took this from him,\u201d she said in a near whisper. \u201cOr rather, I copied information from his laptop before I left.\u201d</p><p>Oh shit. Liam glanced up at Noah to see the same grim fear in his friend\u2019s eyes. This didn\u2019t sound good. Not good at all.</p><p>Noah shoved the coffee table out of the way and knelt in front of Lauren. He didn\u2019t try to take the disk from her hand, but he took her other one and rubbed it between his palms.</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of information?\u201d Noah asked.</p><p>\u201cContacts. Records. Business and financial records. Entries detailing his client lists. When and where they met with what girls. Remember the whole hoopla over the high-profile madam case several years ago? This is basically the same thing, only it proves Joel for the pimp he is. And he has some big-name clients. Politicians. Doctors. Lawyers. Famous people. He runs a very big business peddling . . . women.\u201d</p><p>She nearly choked on the last word and it ended in a quiet sob.</p><p>\u201cWomen like the one he killed for talking to you about me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, baby, we can\u2019t prove that,\u201d Liam began.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cYou and I both know that\u2019s exactly why she died. It\u2019s not a coincidence that the day after she talks to you she gets beat to death. You know it and I know it. Let\u2019s not try to make it what it isn\u2019t. The simple fact is, if I\u2019d gone to the police with this information instead of running like a scared rabbit, that woman would be alive.\u201d</p><p>Liam swallowed hard. This was going south fast, and he had no idea how to get things back on track.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell us about this before?\u201d Noah asked. \u201cI get why you didn\u2019t when we were in New York. But why didn\u2019t you tell us when we got here? When we found out the truth about Joel?\u201d</p><p>She raised her head, her gaze so dull and filled with self-condemnation that it made Liam hurt.</p><p>\u201cBecause I was afraid that you\u2019d want to do the right thing, and I was too self-absorbed and afraid to do it myself. I had this hope that I could just move on with my life, pretend Joel never existed and continue to live in denial. If I didn\u2019t think about what he did or the other women he\u2019s hurt, then it wasn\u2019t real.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why did you take the time and the risk to copy this information if you never intended to do anything with it?\u201d Liam asked. \u201cIf he found out\u2014hell, if he knows you took something from him like that\u2014you have to know he\u2019ll come after you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I wasn\u2019t thinking!\u201d she burst out. \u201cI was in complete panic. I wanted to get as far away from him as possible but at the same time I wanted an insurance policy. It sounds so stupid now, but at the time I was only thinking that if he tried to come after me, if he tried to find me, I could pull out my trump card and blackmail him into getting out of my life forever.\u201d</p><p>Noah sighed. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t work that way, sweetheart. Men like Joel don\u2019t just go away when they know someone has incriminating evidence. If what you say is on that disk, it could topple his entire network and put him behind bars for a very long time. Not to mention the people implicated in his prostitution ring. I don\u2019t think you realize how far reaching the ramifications are for this. If he killed a woman for talking to someone, what do you think he\u2019d do to someone who threatened everything he\u2019s worked to build?\u201d</p><p>She went completely pale. Liam couldn\u2019t even reprimand Noah for being so blunt, because it was what Lauren needed to hear. He hated to see the fear in her eyes, but he needed her to be afraid and to be aware of just what she\u2019d stepped in.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t pretend anymore,\u201d she said hoarsely. \u201cI can\u2019t pretend I never had this information. If I had done the right thing, that woman would still be alive. Who knows who else might still be alive. Who\u2019s to say he hasn\u2019t killed other women? Or that he hasn\u2019t done to other women what he did to me?\u201d</p><p>She turned to include Liam in her passionate speech.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t look at myself in the mirror any longer knowing the mistakes I\u2019ve made and the chances I\u2019ve had to rectify them. I don\u2019t like that person. I don\u2019t like who I\u2019ve become. I\u2019m someone who has lied to her family and to the men hired to protect her. I\u2019m someone who has information that could bring down a man who deserves to be behind bars, but was too cowardly to hand it over to the police. I\u2019m someone I don\u2019t even recognize anymore,\u201d she said painfully. \u201cAnd if I don\u2019t like myself, how can I expect either of you to ever love me?\u201d</p><p>Liam reached for her, pulling her into his arms. \u201cYou made mistakes, baby. You were desperate, scared and alone.\u201d</p><p>She pulled away, her expression fierce. \u201cBut I\u2019m not alone anymore. I have family who loves me. I have you and Noah, if you can still stand to be around me. It\u2019s time that I do something besides hide and act like a helpless victim.\u201d</p><p>Noah\u2019s expression grew fierce. \u201cThat\u2019s bullshit. You damn well do have us and you\u2019re stuck there. We aren\u2019t going anywhere, and we sure as hell aren\u2019t angry with you for doing what you thought was necessary to ensure your safety and well-being.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019ll help me?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes were hopeful as she looked pleadingly at them.</p><p>\u201cHelp you do what, baby?\u201d Liam asked softly.</p><p>\u201cGo with me to New York to turn the disk over to the police.\u201d</p><p>Liam and Noah both went silent. Liam\u2019s mind was buzzing like a chainsaw. This was huge. Not to mention dangerous. Lauren\u2019s life wouldn\u2019t be worth a shit the minute it got out that she\u2019d turned evidence on Joel Knight.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not quite that simple,\u201d Noah began.</p><p>She frowned. \u201cWhy not? If I give them the disk, there\u2019ll be no question as to what Joel\u2019s involved in. They\u2019ll arrest him and bring him to trial.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have to remember that he has people on his payroll,\u201d Liam said carefully. \u201cWe can\u2019t just waltz into the precinct and announce we have evidence implicating Joel Knight and various other people of distinction.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what can we do?\u201d she asked in frustration. \u201cI can\u2019t turn my back again. He has to be stopped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe first thing we need to do is have a look at what\u2019s on the disk,\u201d Liam said. \u201cWe need to make a list of all the people mentioned. Figure out what we\u2019re dealing with. You have to understand that anyone listed as a client would go a long way to make sure that information never comes to light. Once we see what\u2019s there, then we have to decide who we think we can trust. There is no way in hell I\u2019m allowing you to trot off to New York and put your welfare into the hands of just anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019ll help me?\u201d she asked hopefully.</p><p>Noah touched her face. \u201cYou don\u2019t seriously think we\u2019re going to let you do this alone, do you?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t answer, and Noah let out a curse.</p><p>Liam took her hand and squeezed. \u201cWhat he\u2019s trying to say is that you belong to us, Lauren. And we\u2019re not going to do anything that puts you in danger. We\u2019ll take a look at the disk and then we\u2019ll go from there. We\u2019ll find a way to do this with the least amount of risk to you.\u201d</p><p>A tear rolled down her cheek followed by another and then another. She hastily wiped them away only for more to come. It was as if the last secret she\u2019d so desperately guarded had finally broken free, and a huge weight had been lifted.</p><p>\u201cDo you have a computer?\u201d Noah asked.</p><p>She shook her head.</p><p>\u201cWhat about Seth? They live the closest to town, right?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, still wiping at the tears rolling down her cheeks.</p><p>\u201cCan you call him and ask if we can come over to use his computer?\u201d Liam asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she said in a quivery voice. \u201cI\u2019m sure he wouldn\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeth needs to know anyway,\u201d Noah said grimly. \u201cHe\u2019ll be able to offer some ideas from a law enforcement perspective.\u201d</p><p>Lauren lowered her head, closing her eyes.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re your family, baby,\u201d Liam said. \u201cYou\u2019ve always told us how wonderful the Colters are. They\u2019re not going to judge you. They\u2019re just going to want you safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI let them down,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cI let myself down.\u201d</p><p>Noah reached for her hand, squeezing it as Liam had done. \u201cThen it\u2019s time to make it up to yourself.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 19</p><p>THE drive to the house Seth shared with his two brothers and Lily was silent except for Lauren giving them directions where to turn off once they got out of town.</p><p>Dusk had already descended when they pulled in next to the parked vehicles in front of the house. The porch lights were on, and Seth appeared in the doorway as they got out of the vehicle. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Concern reflected on his face as he watched them approach. Dread pitted deep in Lauren\u2019s stomach because she knew that before it was over with, everyone would have to know. Max. The Colters. And they would all know what a selfish coward she\u2019d been.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t meet Seth\u2019s gaze when they stopped on the porch.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Seth asked quietly.</p><p>\u201cWe need access to a computer,\u201d Noah said. \u201cAnd depending on what we find on the disk we brought, we\u2019ll need to discuss our options with you.\u201d</p> <p>Seth turned to Lauren. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go in and visit with Lily. I don\u2019t want her upset. I\u2019d rather her believe this is a social visit and that Noah and Liam need the computer for work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t say anything to her,\u201d Lauren said in a low voice.</p><p>She started by Seth, but he caught her arm.</p><p>\u201cI never thought you\u2019d do anything to intentionally upset her, honey. But the look on your face speaks volumes right now. She\u2019ll take one look at you and know something\u2019s wrong right away.\u201d</p><p>Lauren nodded her understanding. It was hard to pretend nothing was wrong when she knew she was responsible for a woman\u2019s death. More than anything, she wanted Holly Colter. She was the closest thing Lauren had to a mother since her own had passed on. And right now, she really needed a mom.</p> <p>Seth let her go and she walked into the living room, very nearly colliding with Michael Colter.</p><p>\u201cWhoa there,\u201d Michael said with a laugh.</p><p>Lauren forced a smile and willed herself not to outwardly show her internal devastation. \u201cWhere\u2019s Lily?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll be right out. Everything okay?\u201d</p><p>Lauren nodded. \u201cYeah. Noah and Liam had some work stuff and I didn\u2019t have a computer so Seth offered to let them borrow yours.\u201d</p><p>On cue, the men walked into the living room. Dillon walked out of the kitchen and immediately dropped a kiss on the top of Lauren\u2019s head.</p> <p>\u201cHey kiddo. How you doing?\u201d</p><p>She kept the smile on until her face ached. \u201cI\u2019m good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you going to dump the diner and come to work for me?\u201d</p><p>It was a running joke between her and Dillon. He\u2019d been mortally offended that she hadn\u2019t come to him for a job, but she\u2019d wanted to find work on her own and she liked the diner. While Dillon operated a great bar and grill, the bar scene wasn\u2019t really her thing. She liked the quietness of the diner and getting to know the locals who came in regularly.</p><p>\u201cWhen you buy the diner,\u201d she said with a genuine grin.</p><p>He laughed. \u201cYou never know. I may yet add it to my growing list of real estate.\u201d</p><p>Dillon Colter owned several businesses in Clyde, including the sporting goods store that was previously owned by a man Lauren only knew as Riley. He\u2019d retired some time ago and had sold the business to Dillon.</p><p>Lily came into the living room, her belly looking tight as a beach ball. She smiled when she saw Lauren and came over to hug her.</p> <p>\u201cHave you eaten?\u201d Lily asked.</p><p>Lauren blinked. She hadn\u2019t. Hadn\u2019t even thought about it.</p><p>\u201cNo, she hasn\u2019t,\u201d Liam said bluntly. \u201cShe\u2019s probably starving.\u201d</p><p>Lauren nearly groaned. So much for subtlety.</p><p>Lily grabbed Lauren\u2019s hand and dragged her toward the kitchen. \u201cDillon made the most awesome pasta dish. I already ate, but I swear I\u2019m hungry again. I\u2019ll make us both a plate.\u201d</p><p>Then she looked over her shoulder to where Noah and Liam stood. \u201cWould you like something to eat too?\u201d</p><p>Both men shook their heads.</p><p>Lily shrugged. \u201cMore for us,\u201d she said with a grin in Lauren\u2019s direction.</p><p>Noah watched as the women disappeared into the kitchen, and then he was immediately cornered by three large men who obviously had questions.</p><p>\u201cIs Lauren in danger?\u201d Dillon asked bluntly.</p><p>\u201cMost likely, yes,\u201d Liam said just as bluntly.</p><p>Seth swore. \u201cWhat happened? Has that bastard shown his face here?\u201d</p><p>Noah held up his hand. \u201cLook. I really need that computer. Lauren has a disk with information she says she copied from Joel Knight\u2019s computer. If what she says is on this disk is actually on it, we\u2019ve opened one big-ass can of worms. But first I need to see exactly what\u2019s on here, and then we can discuss what the hell we do with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d Michael muttered. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t sound good at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get the laptop,\u201d Dillon said as he turned to walk away.</p><p>\u201cHow serious is this looking?\u201d Seth asked in a low voice after Dillon had left the room.</p><p>\u201cVery,\u201d Liam said shortly. \u201cLauren is devastated. The woman Noah and I questioned, who led us to Joel Knight and then eventually here to confront Lauren with what we\u2019d found out, was found dead in her apartment. She was beaten to death the day after we spoke to her. Lauren\u2019s taking it very hard. She blames herself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSon of a bitch,\u201d Seth bit out.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Noah said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know about the disk. Another surprise, and not a good one. She\u2019s determined to go back to New York with the evidence she has so she can put Joel away, and she blames herself for not having the courage to do it before. She feels guilty for running away and hiding behind her brother and your family. She feels like she\u2019s let you all down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s bullshit,\u201d Michael said, his face drawn in anger.</p><p>\u201cI want to shake her,\u201d Liam said. \u201cI\u2019m pissed that she kept something this heavy from us. Or even you. Someone needed to know. I\u2019m pissed that she blames herself. I\u2019m pissed that she\u2019s taking responsibility for everything that bastard has done.\u201d</p><p>Dillon had returned for the tail end of the conversation and he scowled openly at Liam. \u201cYou didn\u2019t hurt her, did you?\u201d</p><p>Liam\u2019s brows drew together in an angry cloud. \u201cWhat the fuck? You think I\u2019d hurt her? You think I\u2019d do anything to make her afraid of me?\u201d</p><p>Seth held up his hands. \u201cEnough. I don\u2019t want Lily or Lauren to overhear us. Dillon, you didn\u2019t hear the whole story and we don\u2019t have time to repeat it. Noah and Liam are protecting Lauren\u2019s best interests.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is our best interest,\u201d Noah said flatly. Let them make what they wanted of that statement. He was staking a claim now so that when the shit hit the fan, there was no way the Colters or her brother were stepping in and taking over. Over his dead body would he and Liam simply step aside.</p><p>Michael\u2019s eyebrow went up as he stared between the two men. \u201cI suppose coming from me, surprise would be hypocritical.\u201d</p><p>Liam snorted. \u201cYeah, you could say that.\u201d</p><p>Dillon wasn\u2019t quite ready to back down, though.</p><p>\u201cEither of you do anything to take advantage of her or hurt her, and I\u2019ll make you both very sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not fighting with you over Lauren unless you do something to interfere in our relationship or her safety,\u201d Noah said calmly. \u201cWe both want the same thing. What\u2019s best for Lauren. And we want her out of danger.\u201d</p><p>Dillon relaxed. \u201cSounds like we\u2019re on the same page then. We care about her a lot. She\u2019s like a little sister to us. When she came here from New York, she . . . Well, she was a different woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe know,\u201d Liam said quietly. \u201cWe were there just a few days after that bastard worked her over. We had to bully her to get her to eat, and she couldn\u2019t stand the sight of us for a long time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go into the office,\u201d Seth said when Dillon held up the laptop. \u201cI don\u2019t know how long the girls will be, but I\u2019d rather not hash this out in front of them. Besides the upset it\u2019s obviously causing Lauren, Lily will worry, and we\u2019re trying to make sure she has absolutely no stress during this pregnancy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand,\u201d Noah said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry we had to bother you. If it wasn\u2019t so important, we would have waited, but this is potentially explosive and I don\u2019t want to be caught unprepared when it comes to Lauren\u2019s safety.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d be pissed if you hadn\u2019t come to me,\u201d Seth said.</p><p>He motioned them into an office just off the living room. The room smelled strongly of cedar. Fresh cedar. The room had a newness to it that the rest of the house lacked.</p><p>\u201cIs this an addition?\u201d Noah asked.</p><p>Dillon nodded. \u201cWe\u2019ve added on quite a bit since Lily came to us.\u201d His expression softened as he spoke of his wife. Noah doubted he even realized it. \u201cExtra bedrooms. We gave Lily space for her painting and we added this office that we all use. Michael runs a veterinary clinic, I run several businesses, and Seth needs space at home to work as well.\u201d</p><p>Seth motioned for Noah to take the seat behind the desk. He put the laptop down and opened it up as Noah maneuvered his way behind the desk.</p><p>When he put the disk in, Liam pushed his way in to look over Noah\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>Once he opened the drive for the disk, he clicked on the file that was only labeled by a date. The date Lauren had left Joel and called her brother for help.</p><p>Once inside, there were several different files, and he clicked on the first, which was a spreadsheet. He quickly scanned over it, noting the categories. It was remarkably detailed with the name of the client, his sexual preferences, everything down to specific kinks. Deal breakers were listed for each client. Prices were different depending on which client it was, and the charges ranged from hourly to entire weekends.</p><p>There was a list of his \u201cgirls,\u201d but they didn\u2019t look like real names. Each client had a detailed list of past girls with notes rating each woman on her performance.</p><p>Disgust boiled in Noah\u2019s gut. The bastard had basically done a follow-up every time one of the women serviced a client. There were marks of the times one of the girls was \u201cdisciplined\u201d for not satisfying the client properly, and Noah could only imagine what that punishment entailed.</p><p>Once he got past the initial astonishment of how detailed the information was, he focused in on the client names.</p><p>\u201cHoly fuck,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Seth demanded.</p><p>\u201cAre you seeing what I\u2019m seeing?\u201d Liam asked in disbelief.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Dillon and Michael both bit out.</p><p>\u201cI doubt the names would mean anything to you,\u201d Noah explained. \u201cWell, some of them would. There are quite a few celebrities listed. Movie stars, pro athletes, entertainers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d Dillon asked, shoving in so he could see the screen.</p><p>Noah pointed to several well-known names.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be damned,\u201d Dillon murmured. \u201cThese are the asshole\u2019s clients? Men who used women for sex?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWomen they paid for sex,\u201d Liam said grimly. \u201cThough I doubt the women pocketed nearly what Knight charged. His fees are exorbitant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m more interested in these names,\u201d Noah said, tapping the top of the screen.</p><p>\u201cThat one\u2019s a judge.\u201d He dropped his finger down two lines. \u201cThat one\u2019s an aide to the mayor. This one is a state senator from New York. And this one is the one who most concerns me. This one is the police commissioner. Lauren said he had several cops on his payroll. It\u2019s more likely he has blackmail material, and they make damn sure nothing touches Knight because if he goes down, he brings them all with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck.\u201d</p><p>The expletive exploded from Liam as he stood bristling with anger next to Noah.</p><p>\u201cThis sounds big,\u201d Michael muttered.</p><p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s huge,\u201d Seth said grimly.</p><p>Noah opened another of the files, and there was a list of the women on Knight\u2019s payroll. Real names, social security numbers, addresses, phone numbers and background information.</p><p>What drew Noah\u2019s alarm was that there was a list of family members, friends, even neighbors. Detailed information on the women\u2019s personal lives, where they liked to vacation, hang out, the salons they used. It was clear that Knight kept his women firmly under his thumb and that once they went to work for him, there was no escaping.</p><p>As he studied it closer, his mouth dropped open. There were notations out to the side of some of the women\u2019s names that sounded ominous.</p><p>Situation taken care of.</p><p>No longer poses a problem for the organization.</p><p>Went to police. Threat eliminated.</p><p>Noah turned to Seth. \u201cIs there any way you can discreetly run these names and details of the women with these notations and see if they\u2019re still alive? And if they aren\u2019t, find out date of death and circumstances? Because it sure as hell looks to me like he made notes on the women he killed or had killed.\u201d</p><p>Seth\u2019s expression was grim. \u201cYeah, print it off for me. I\u2019ll do what I can.\u201d</p><p>Dillon perched on the edge of the desk, angled so he could see Noah and Liam.</p><p>\u201cWhat does this do for Lauren\u2019s safety?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt damn sure doesn\u2019t help,\u201d Liam growled.</p><p>\u201cShe wants to go to New York and turn in the disk. She wants to nail Joel Knight\u2019s ass to the wall,\u201d Noah said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShit,\u201d Seth swore.</p><p>\u201cShe took Suki\u2019s death very hard,\u201d Noah continued.</p><p>\u201cSuki?\u201d Michael asked.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s the woman Liam and I talked to and who was beaten to death the day after,\u201d Noah replied. \u201cLauren blames herself. Said that if she\u2019d gone to the police when she left Joel instead of running here to hide that Suki would be alive.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s crazy,\u201d Dillon bit out. \u201cShe\u2019d probably be dead herself. He would have gotten to her before Max ever got there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly,\u201d Liam said. \u201cBut she has it in her head that she\u2019s to blame and she wants to rectify the situation by going to New York and handing over the disk to the authorities.\u201d</p><p>Seth rubbed a hand over his hair. \u201cDoes Max know about any of this?\u201d</p><p>Noah shook his head. \u201cWe came straight here. I wanted to see what was on the disk before I made any decisions with regard to Lauren.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s going to flip out,\u201d Michael said.</p> <p>Liam leveled a stare at Seth. \u201cWhat do you think, Seth? What are our options here? We have to be careful who we trust. We can\u2019t just ignore the issue. It\u2019s not going to go away. And the minute we relax our guard, that\u2019s when that bastard will show up. For all we know he has someone looking for Lauren now. It\u2019s obvious by looking at his records that he doesn\u2019t take kindly to women leaving the fold. I can only imagine how personally he took it that a woman he considered his possession walked out on him.\u201d</p><p>Seth nodded his lips drawn into a grim line. \u201cI agree. From everything you\u2019ve told me about him and from what Max has said, I\u2019m inclined to agree that he\u2019s not going to just forget about Lauren and move on. Which means you\u2019ll always have to be looking over your shoulder unless something is done to stop him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think we should contact the district attorney and set up a meeting,\u201d Noah said. \u201cOn our terms. We name the place and we prepare for the worst-case scenario, which is that the D.A. is dirty and the meeting is a setup to take Lauren out. We make damn sure she\u2019s protected and that he\u2019s on the up-and-up before we let him talk to her. And at no time do we give him any details about where Lauren is now or give him any of her family\u2019s names.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMax wouldn\u2019t be hard to track down,\u201d Dillon pointed out. \u201cIf someone does any digging, they\u2019ll discover Max and they\u2019ll come here looking for her.\u201d</p><p>Seth shook his head. \u201cNo, that\u2019s not true. Max is a cagey bastard. I did some checking up on him when all that shit was going down between him and Callie. All I was able to discover about him was his connection to the business he owned. Apparently he\u2019s always been big on privacy, because the only link was to the corporation, and the headquarters lists an address in New York City. I highly doubt that changed after he hooked up with Callie. He\u2019s very protective of her, and he\u2019s a wealthy son of a bitch. He wouldn\u2019t want any risk to her whatsoever and she\u2019s a free spirit, so putting her under lock and key wouldn\u2019t exactly work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, well, that\u2019s a good thing,\u201d Liam said. \u201cNo one but Max and your family knows that she\u2019s here or that she came from New York. I assume the locals only know she\u2019s Max\u2019s sister and not much else.\u201d</p> <p>Seth nodded. \u201cExactly. I don\u2019t think you should take her anywhere near New York.\u201d</p><p>Noah frowned. \u201cHell no. If the D.A.\u2019s interested in talking to her, he\u2019ll have to meet us someplace that isn\u2019t connected to here or New York.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure Max would fly you out on his jet,\u201d Seth said. \u201cNo paper trail that way. No IDs. No way to trace you back here. Have Lauren either dye her hair or wear a wig. Alter her appearance as much as possible for the meeting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like the way you think,\u201d Liam said.</p><p>\u201cAnd I don\u2019t think you should go alone,\u201d Seth added quietly.</p><p>Noah lifted his brow again. \u201cMeaning what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think some of us should go with you as backup.\u201d</p><p>Liam sent Noah a worried glance. The last thing they wanted was to involve the Colters. But he also recognized that he and Noah were only two people, and while they\u2019d risk their lives to protect Lauren, if they went down, who would be left to protect her?</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know . . .\u201d Noah hedged.</p><p>\u201cSeth and I can go,\u201d Dillon said firmly. \u201cMichael can stay with Lily. We can talk to the dads. Max is going to have to know. We really need to let everyone in on what\u2019s going on so we can plan Lauren\u2019s meeting with the D.A. but also make sure that mom, Callie and Lily aren\u2019t left unprotected here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is going to devastate Lauren even more,\u201d Liam said. \u201cShe looks at you and your parents as her family. She loves all of you and she feels like she\u2019s let you down and that she\u2019s not worthy of the unconditional support you\u2019ve offered her. She\u2019s going to hate that it\u2019s all going to come out this way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom will nip that in the bud,\u201d Michael said confidently. \u201cThe important thing is that we get the family together and decide what\u2019s best for Lauren.\u201d</p><p>Seth nodded his agreement. \u201cLauren is family. There\u2019s no way in hell we\u2019re just going to stand by on this. No offense to you and Noah. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re damn good at your job, and it\u2019s obvious you care a lot about her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo offense taken. We could use the help,\u201d Noah said bluntly. \u201cWe need people we can trust, and I feel like we can trust you and your family absolutely.\u201d</p><p>Seth checked his watch. \u201cIt\u2019s late and I hate to drag everybody out tonight for a family meeting. But I think we should do it first thing in the morning so we can get rolling on what needs to be done. You take Lauren back home and try to get her to rest. Michael, can you call Doc Burton and ask him to call in something for Lauren to take to help her sleep tonight?\u201d</p><p>Noah shook his head. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about Lauren. Liam and I will handle things with her. Just tell us when and where to meet you tomorrow. I\u2019ll make sure she calls into work. There are things we need to get worked out between us before we bring in the rest of her family.\u201d</p><p>Seth nodded his understanding. \u201cWe\u2019ll meet at Mom and the dads\u2019 place first thing in the morning at eight. I\u2019ll go into work early and see what I can find out on those women on the printout. I\u2019ll call Dad and let him know we\u2019re coming. And then I\u2019ll call Max.\u201d</p><p>Noah rose from the chair he was seated in and extended his hand in Seth\u2019s direction. \u201cAppreciate the help. I know Lauren will too once she\u2019s gotten over her fear and upset.\u201d</p><p>Seth took his hand, shaking it. \u201cYou just watch out for our girl. She\u2019s one of us even if her last name isn\u2019t Colter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Lily?\u201d Michael said in a low voice. \u201cFor that matter, what about Mom and Callie? This is going to upset them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLauren is going to need their support,\u201d Dillon said. \u201cLily would be pissed if we tried to keep this from her. Mom would kick all our asses. We\u2019ve been through tough times before. Our women can handle it. We can\u2019t protect them from everything. Besides, they need to know what we\u2019re dealing with so they aren\u2019t blindsided. They need to know to be on the lookout and to be careful until things are resolved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree,\u201d Seth said. \u201cWe can\u2019t not tell them. They need to stick together and make sure they don\u2019t go anywhere alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay then. We\u2019ll take Lauren home and we\u2019ll meet you at your parents\u2019 place tomorrow at eight,\u201d Noah said.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go get our girl,\u201d Liam said gruffly.</p><p>Chapter 20</p><p>LAUREN was doing her best to do justice to the wonderful-tasting pasta Lily had plated for her, but every bite felt like a rock in her stomach.</p><p>In the other room, the guys were talking. Deciding her fate. As if she had absolutely no control over her own choices.</p><p>But then could she blame them when she\u2019d done nothing but make bad decisions? Over and over, at every turn, she\u2019d chosen wrong.</p><p>This time she knew what she needed to do. It was clear in her mind and heart. Yes, it scared the holy hell out of her. She wasn\u2019t so stupid that she thought it would be a simple matter of turning over the evidence to the police, and then Joel would spend many years behind bars and cease to be a threat to her.</p><p>Doing the right thing wasn\u2019t easy. It wasn\u2019t supposed to be easy. If it were, then everyone would always go that route and the world would be a much better place.</p><p>But it wasn\u2019t, because men like Joel Knight continued to grow and prosper at the expense of the women he owned and controlled, threatened and intimidated.</p><p>That was no longer going to be her, and if she could help it, it would no longer be the women he peddled to men willing to pay Joel\u2019s price to use their bodies.</p><p>\u201cIs everything all right, Lauren?\u201d</p><p>Lily\u2019s anxious voice cut through Lauren\u2019s thoughts. Her smile was automatic as she stared back at the other woman. But the longer she stared at Lily, the more she knew she couldn\u2019t lie to her friend\u2019s face.</p><p>There\u2019d been too many lies as it was.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know yet,\u201d Lauren said in a low voice. \u201cLiam and Noah are talking to Seth about it.\u201d</p><p>Lily put her hand over Lauren\u2019s and squeezed. \u201cYou know that we\u2019re here for you. All of us.\u201d</p><p>This time Lauren\u2019s smile was genuine. \u201cI do know that and thank you. You can\u2019t possibly know what your support means to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh but I do know,\u201d Lily said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t so long ago that I was in a terrible situation. The Colters were wonderful to me. I\u2019ll never forget what that felt like after living with so much pain and regret. You\u2019ll get there, Lauren. You just have to give yourself time to heal.\u201d</p><p>They were interrupted when the group of men walked into the kitchen. Lauren immediately pushed her plate away, relieved to have an excuse to be done with it.</p><p>Liam came to stand beside her and slipped his hand over her shoulder. \u201cYou ready to go? It\u2019s getting late.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, examining each of the men\u2019s faces in turn, looking for some sign of . . . condemnation. But all she saw was steady resolve. Determination.</p><p>She slid from her chair and rubbed her hands down her pants in a nervous gesture. Noah reached for one of her hands and laced his fingers through hers. His hold was comforting and strong. He tucked her into his side and ushered her toward the door amid good-byes from the Colters.</p><p>The cool night air was a much-needed balm for her senses. She breathed it in deeply, savoring the crispness. For a moment she hesitated, staring up to the blue-black sky. Stars cascaded across the expanse, like glitter tossed carelessly from the hand of a child.</p><p>The mountain loomed over them, silhouetted against the sky, and the moon was just visible between two peaks. Around her, the pines, furs and aspens swayed with the gentle breeze, bringing to her the spicy scent of pine.</p><p>What was most remarkable was the quiet. Silence had settled over the land with the blanket of night. Only the occasional rustle wrought by the wind stirred any sound.</p><p>It was a peaceful place. The most beautiful place Lauren had ever experienced. She wanted it to be her home. Her haven.</p><p>A lifetime away from the hustle and bustle of her former life in the city. The shopping, lattes, delis, busy streets, honking horns, every other business a different restaurant, cell phones, traffic lights, constantly going, going, going and never pausing to simply breathe.</p><p>Here she could walk down the sidewalk in Clyde and never bump into another person. There wasn\u2019t a single traffic light in the town, and only one stop sign, at the intersection of Main and Maplewood.</p><p>People smiled when she made eye contact. The citizens here were always willing to lend a helping hand.</p><p>On the day she\u2019d moved into her apartment, though she\u2019d had the help of Max and the entire Colter clan, they\u2019d had no less than a half a dozen offers from passersby to get her furniture up the stairs.</p><p>And Margery, one of the regulars at the diner, had fried chicken and made potato salad and homemade rolls along with a pitcher of fresh-squeezed lemonade, and she\u2019d brought it all to Lauren\u2019s apartment so everyone could eat.</p><p>She felt . . . relevant . . . here. Like she mattered. She wasn\u2019t just another number in a massive population. Here, she was one in a small crowd.</p><p>\u201cLauren?\u201d</p><p>Liam\u2019s voice drifted to her and she realized that she was still staring up at the sky, a dreamy expression on her face. And maybe she was dreaming. Or wishing on the scattering of stars glowing brightly in the distance.</p><p>\u201cYou ready, baby? We need to get you home.\u201d</p><p>Reluctantly she tore herself away from the beauty surrounding her and climbed into the SUV.</p><p>\u201cWhat did they say?\u201d she asked softly as they drove back toward town. \u201cAnd did you look at the disk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe did,\u201d Noah said grimly. \u201cYou\u2019re right. There\u2019s definitely enough information to put him\u2014and several others\u2014away for a long time.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThey\u2019ll cut a deal and roll on him,\u201d Liam said.</p><p>\u201cAs for what the Colters said, they only voiced their unconditional support for you. They\u2019re concerned for your safety, and they threatened to kick mine and Liam\u2019s asses if we ever hurt you.\u201d</p><p>Warmth traveled through her chest, squeezing her heart.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going out to their parents\u2019 tomorrow morning first thing,\u201d Liam said.</p><p>He angled in the front seat so he could see her where she sat in the back.</p><p>\u201cSeth\u2019s doing some checking for us, and we\u2019re going to meet so that in essence as a family we can put our heads together and come up with the best plan of attack.\u201d</p><p>Lauren blew out her breath. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>Noah glanced in the rearview mirror and met her gaze. \u201cYou going to be all right with it?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s me who has the problem. I do them a great disservice by thinking they\u2019ll be disappointed in me. The truth is I\u2019m disappointed in myself, and so I\u2019m projecting that viewpoint on everyone else. They\u2019ve been nothing but wonderful to me.\u201d</p><p>A moment later, Noah pulled onto the side street of her building and then into the small parking lot in the back that was mostly used for the clinic. At the end, there was a designated spot for her use, but most of the time, if the clinic got busy, someone always took it anyway.</p><p>Liam opened her door, helped her out and immediately pulled her into his side, wrapping his arm protectively around her as they walked around to the side facing the street. They mounted the steps, Noah following closely behind and Liam waiting as she unlocked the door.</p><p>She flipped the wall switch, flooding the living room with light. Liam left her long enough to turn on the lamp in the corner and then he returned, turning the main light back off again.</p><p>\u201cI like it better this way,\u201d he murmured as he pulled her into his arms.</p><p>His mouth found hers in what was at first a tender kiss. But he grew more forceful, more demanding, taking her breath as he deepened the kiss.</p><p>He cupped her jaw in his hands as he stared intently down at her.</p><p>\u201cTonight, you tell us how you want it, Lauren. We\u2019ll only do what you want. How you want. Show us.\u201d</p><p>It required a lot of courage to be so bold. She was suddenly shy and self-conscious. Images flashed through her mind, tempting, tantalizing her. Was it possible? Was any of it possible?</p><p>Noah came up behind her, his hands closing over her shoulders. He leaned in to kiss her neck, moving her hair out of the way as his lips nuzzled her skin.</p><p>\u201cThis is what I want,\u201d she whispered. \u201cBoth of you. Touching me. At the same time.\u201d She turned into Noah, the warmth of his body wrapping around her slow and sensual. \u201cI want you inside me.\u201d</p><p>He let out a low groan. \u201cI want to be there, honey. More than you can possibly know.\u201d</p><p>Liam maneuvered her toward the bedroom. She was reaching for the fly of her jeans, when the three of them crowded in. Before courage deserted her, before she could overthink this, she began undressing, determined to take an active part in their lovemaking.</p><p>She pushed down her pants, and when she stood again, Noah was there, his hands sliding underneath her shirt, his palms warm and erotic on her skin.</p><p>Emboldened by desire flooding her veins, she began to undo his pants. One particular fantasy had taken hold, and she wanted it to come true. They\u2019d given her the power. All she had to do was speak up.</p> <p>Her movements were clumsy, not at all practiced. It frustrated her that she couldn\u2019t be elegantly smooth and composed.</p><p>As she struggled with Noah\u2019s pants, her frustration got the best of her.</p><p>\u201cI feel like such a damn amateur,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>Noah captured her wrists and pulled her abruptly against him, his eyes fiery.</p><p>\u201cI like that you want me so much that your hands shake. Honey, I don\u2019t give a damn how much finesse it\u2019s done with. All I care is that the end result is me and you naked.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cThen would you please get the rest of your clothing off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHappy to accommodate,\u201d Noah growled.</p><p>She turned to Liam and held up her arms. Needing no further encouragement, he pulled her shirt over her head and then immediately turned her so he could unfasten her bra.</p><p>Left in only her panties, she took a quick peek at Noah, who was down to his underwear, and then she glanced back at Liam, who was still fully dressed.</p><p>\u201cThis won\u2019t do at all,\u201d she murmured in a husky, seductive tone she didn\u2019t recognize.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t have that,\u201d Liam said. \u201cWe can\u2019t have you not pleased. By all means, tell me how you want me, baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNaked,\u201d she said bluntly. \u201cI want to feel you. Touch you. Kiss you. Taste you.\u201d</p><p>It was a heady sensation to be so bold and seductive. She loved the reaction in Liam\u2019s eyes. Loved the way he began stripping away his clothing with no finesse or patience.</p><p>He yanked down his jeans along with his underwear, freeing his cock from constriction. It bobbed free, long and already hard.</p><p>It was instinctive to drop to her knees in front of him, her hands circling his length. He moaned and slid his hand roughly through her hair, fisting the strands in his fingers.</p><p>Even as she lowered her mouth, she reached for Noah, wanting him close. He stepped forward so that she could grasp him in her free hand. Her fingers curled around the thick erection, and she rolled upward and then back down again, satisfied when he hardened even further in her hold.</p><p>She licked around the broad tip of Liam\u2019s dick and then turned her head to give Noah equal treatment. She teased him a moment, bestowing tiny licks and kisses before taking him deep inside her mouth.</p><p>He let out a strangled sound and his hands joined Liam\u2019s in her hair. She let her mouth slide back again, until the head popped free of her lips, and then she turned to Liam and sucked him in just as deeply.</p><p>\u201cGoddamn,\u201d Liam bit out.</p><p>She smiled and pulled away, turning back to Noah as she rose. He reached out to help her, grasping her arms for support. She put both hands on his chest and pushed back until he came in contact with the bed.</p><p>\u201cCondom?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cIn my pocket,\u201d he said hoarsely.</p><p>She reached down to fumble with his pants and then retrieved one of the packets. Before returning, she hastily shoved her panties down, kicking them away when they tangled at her feet.</p><p>\u201cLie back,\u201d she directed, when she returned to Noah.</p><p>He settled back on the bed, his legs hanging over the edge, feet planted on the floor. She rolled the condom carefully down his length, and then she motioned for Liam.</p><p>\u201cI want you here, beside Noah,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to get up on the bed so you\u2019ll reach my mouth.\u201d</p><p>Lust flared in Liam\u2019s eyes. He didn\u2019t need to be told anything further. He obviously got where she was going with this.</p><p>She\u2019d honestly never been on top before. Joel would have never allowed it, and the very few sexual partners she\u2019d had before Joel had been more of a quick, awkward experience. But she was determined to rock Noah\u2019s\u2014and Liam\u2019s\u2014world tonight. They\u2019d certainly rocked hers the night before.</p><p>She eased on top of Noah, straddling his muscular thighs. He reached for her waist, helping her as she positioned herself over him.</p><p>\u201cMake sure you\u2019re ready, honey,\u201d Noah said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to hurt you. I\u2019ll be deep this way.\u201d</p><p>She wanted him inside her so badly that it was a physical ache.</p><p>Curling her hand around his latex-encased erection, she dug her knees into the mattress on either side of his hips and carefully positioned him at her opening.</p><p>They both gasped at the first touch.</p><p>She let go of his cock so she could brace her palms on his firm, flat belly, and she slowly began to lower herself, taking more and more of him inside her.</p><p>Noah\u2019s hands flew to her hips, his fingers digging into her flesh. His eyes were closed, head thrown back, and his expression was one of intense pleasure.</p><p>That look fascinated her. She was glued to his every reaction. She loved that she had this kind of power over him. He wanted her. He desired her. There was no disputing that.</p><p>He was thick inside her. It was different taking him this way than when Liam had pushed inside her the night before. Noah was right. He was deeper this way. He just felt bigger.</p><p>She hesitated, a little worried that he was too big.</p><p>\u201cLiam, help her,\u201d Noah rasped out. \u201cShe needs to be wetter to take me. She wasn\u2019t ready.\u201d</p><p>The bed dipped, taking Liam\u2019s weight. And then he was pressed against her upper body, his lips finding hers. But then his mouth slid downward to her breasts, and as he took one rigid peak between his lips, his hand slid down her belly, between her and Noah, his fingers finding her clit.</p><p>It was a shock to her senses. The two men were in a precariously intimate position. Liam\u2019s fingers were right there! His hand had to be touching Noah in order to touch her the way he was.</p><p>Her gaze flew to Noah, to see his reaction, but his eyes were hooded and focused solely on her. It was as if he wasn\u2019t even aware of the proximity of Liam\u2019s hand to his own body. He only seemed concerned about her. Her pleasure.</p><p>Her physical reaction to the sheer eroticism of being astride one man while another pleasured her in other ways was explosive. It was suddenly a lot easier to move around Noah\u2019s rigid cock. She\u2019d gotten wetter, but she didn\u2019t want Liam to move his hand away, so she held herself upward, still not fully taking Noah as deeply as she could.</p><p>She loved having Liam at her breasts, his fingers between her and Noah. It somehow fit. It just came together for her. That they\u2019d be comfortable enough in their own sexuality to focus only on her pleasure, without worry that they were somehow making contact, touched her deeply.</p><p>With a last sigh as Liam sucked strongly at her nipples and his fingers stroked over her clit, she put her hand on his shoulder and squeezed to get his attention.</p><p>\u201cI want you up on the bed,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI want you in my mouth while Noah\u2019s inside me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh hell yes,\u201d Liam breathed.</p><p>He pushed further up on the bed, his hand pulled away from her and Noah. In the end, he had to almost stand on the bed and duck to keep from hitting the ceiling, but he threaded a hand through her hair and helped guide himself to her waiting mouth.</p><p>Noah\u2019s hands tightened around her hips. She needed his help and he seemed to realize it. Between the two men, they worked in a gentle, steady rhythm, enabling her to ride atop Noah while working her mouth around Liam\u2019s cock.</p><p>It was the most exciting, crazy, hot, lusty experience she\u2019d ever imagined. No, she couldn\u2019t even say she\u2019d imagined it. Nothing could have prepared her for the reality of having these two powerful men for all purposes at her mercy.</p><p>She reached one hand for Liam, curling her fingers around the base of his erection while she pressed her other hand against Noah\u2019s hip to keep her balance.</p><p>\u201cI want to taste you,\u201d she said as she pulled her mouth away for a brief moment. \u201cI want you to come inside my mouth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take care of you, baby,\u201d Liam said, his voice hoarse and strained. \u201cConcentrate on Noah. Keep your hands down. I\u2019ll take care of what you want.\u201d</p><p>Noah reached for her hand as she lowered it, twining his fingers with hers. He was so deep and huge inside her. Each time she moved forward, the pressure of his pelvis against her clit sent streaks of sharp pleasure through her body.</p><p>She wanted more.</p><p>She found her rhythm just as Liam framed her face and took control, sliding his cock deep inside her mouth and then withdrawing. She rocked and rolled over Noah, finally finding just the perfect amount of pressure for her to orgasm.</p><p>Never before had she been able to orgasm without clitoral stimulation. Joel simply hadn\u2019t cared, and he\u2019d refused to allow her to use her fingers to satisfy herself during the act. With the men she\u2019d been with before Joel, she\u2019d simply taken it upon herself to take care of her own orgasm.</p><p>Who gave a shit what Joel allowed? This was here and now. She was with two men who seemed determined to give her the world. They weren\u2019t so insecure in their sexual prowess that her pleasuring herself would be seen as an insult.</p><p>She slipped her free hand down, arching up just a bit so she could slide her fingers between her and Noah to find her clit.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it, honey,\u201d Noah encouraged. \u201cI want you to come too.\u201d</p><p>Even as he spoke, he lifted his hands to her breasts, toying with her nipples.</p><p>\u201cDo you like that?\u201d Noah asked. \u201cDoes it make you feel good?\u201d</p><p>She moaned around Liam\u2019s cock, her body tightening all over as she began to stroke her clit while Noah applied gentle pressure to her nipples.</p><p>She began to move faster and harder. Her breathing sped up and she knew she was close.</p><p>Liam thrust deep and then performed several more shallow thrusts to allow her to catch her breath. But she was beyond simple coherency. She no longer was aware of what she was doing or what they were doing. She could only feel their hands, their cocks. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou first,\u201d Liam said gruffly. \u201cCome for us, baby.\u201d</p><p>With a sharp cry, she gave in to the rising tide. Her orgasm billowed over her, cracking like ice under pressure. It was sharp and unrelenting. It was the most oh-my-God pleasure she\u2019d ever felt in her life.</p><p>She sagged and then realized they were now holding her up. She was limp and boneless, so sated that all she wanted to do was curl up on Noah\u2019s chest and sleep.</p><p>But first, she wanted them to feel as good as she did.</p><p>Liam tilted her head back, allowing his cock to slide from her mouth. Then with his hand, he began pumping, the pace wild and frantic. He angled the tip of his cock to where it lined up with her mouth and a split second later, she felt the first hot burst of semen hit the inside of her cheek.</p><p>She remained completely still as he directed more into her mouth. His fist pulled to the end, and then the tip of his cock brushed over her lips, leaving a warm, wet trail.</p><p>She stuck her tongue out, licking around the head and removing the remnants of his orgasm from his skin. He moaned softly and then pulled away. He lowered himself and brushed a kiss across her forehead.</p><p>\u201cFinish Noah,\u201d he whispered. \u201cI\u2019ll go get something to clean you up with.\u201d</p><p>She righted herself and then leaned forward, planting her hands on Noah\u2019s broad chest. His face was tight, his jaw bulging. She realized then what it must have been like to watch the scene between her and Liam play out right in front of Noah.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m close, honey,\u201d he bit out. \u201cI\u2019m feeling a little crazy right now. I don\u2019t want to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>She smiled and then began to ride him hard. Fast. Furious. She wanted to take him to the very edge and then let him plummet over the side.</p><p>His breath hissed from his lips. He gripped her hips and began to power upward to meet her downward movements. After a moment, she let him take over. Her attempts at maintaining the pace were fruitless. He was much stronger, and he seemed to have lost what little control he had left.</p><p>The sound of flesh smacking flesh was loud and filled the small room. Each upward thrust jolted her clit, sending an aftershock of pleasure through her groin. She was hypersensitive after the roaring orgasm she\u2019d experienced, and each time his pelvis slapped against hers, she moaned, nearly undone by the sensation.</p><p>And then he tensed, bowed under her, arched in a supremely uncomfortable-looking position as he pulsed inside her. Finally he collapsed onto the bed, and he wrapped his arms around her, taking her down with him.</p><p>They both lay panting, trying desperately to catch their breaths as Noah caressed her back with both palms. He moved lower, cupping her buttocks, squeezing them possessively.</p><p>The gesture made her tighten around his cock, which was still buried deep inside her, and she moaned softly again.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d he murmured close to her ear.</p><p>She turned her lips to the side, turning just enough that she could kiss his chest.</p><p>\u201cPerfect,\u201d she said on a sigh.</p><p>She closed her eyes in utter contentment. It was true. The moment was absolutely perfect.</p><p>No matter what happened tomorrow, tonight she was at peace. Noah and Liam made her feel cherished and protected. They made her feel like she mattered.</p><p>Tomorrow\u2014and the future\u2014would work itself out. She had to believe that. All she could do was take it one day at a time and going forward make intelligent decisions she hadn\u2019t made in the past.</p><p>The important thing was that she wouldn\u2019t be alone. Noah and Liam would be with her every step of the way.</p> <p>Chapter 21</p><p>LAUREN slept with Liam that night while Noah slept in the living room. She woke the next morning, curled into his embrace, him tightly wrapped around her. She was spooned against him, her back molded to his chest. One of his legs was thrown over hers and his palm was flat against her belly.</p><p>She smiled, sighing in utter contentment. It was a nice way to wake up. It was a nice way to sleep. So far they\u2019d alternated nights, but what would happen when they had better sleeping arrangements? If she were in a place that could actually accommodate a king-sized bed, then it would be possible for them both to sleep with her and one wouldn\u2019t always have to take a separate room or bed.</p><p>She wiggled slightly, working free of Liam\u2019s embrace so that she could look at him. He was beautiful. Not many would say so. He\u2019d probably always been judged because of the hair and the tattoos. Most people likely cut a wide path around him.</p><p>But his heart was gold. He was so loving and so protective. There wasn\u2019t a mean bone in his body. Not when it came to her.</p><p>She let her palm glide over the intricate artwork on his arm, taking in the bright colors and the patterns. There wasn\u2019t a set rhythm. It wasn\u2019t a specific scene or even a recognizable symbol. It was quite simply a work of art. Eclectic. Vibrant. It made him stand out in a crowd, but then he was the kind of man who would with or without the colorful tats.</p><p>He was a man impossible to overlook.</p><p>While she was staring, his eyelids opened and he gave her a sleepy look, his blue eyes cloudy.</p><p>\u201cGood morning,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>Without a word, he wrapped his arm around her waist and hauled her to him, kissing her lightly on the lips. He didn\u2019t seem to care about issues like morning breath. She could only imagine what hers was like.</p><p>\u201cYou look . . .\u201d His eyes narrowed as he studied her.</p><p>\u201cI look what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cContent,\u201d he finally said.</p><p>She smiled. \u201cI am. Maybe I\u2019m making peace with things. Finally. Or maybe you and Noah just make me so happy and confident that I don\u2019t care about anything else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad,\u201d he said softly. \u201cI love you, Lauren. I want you to be happy. I want you to fly. Whatever makes you happy, I want it for you.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed, her features frozen. Her heart fluttered in her chest like an injured butterfly.</p><p>He loved her.</p><p>Oh, she knew he cared about her. But love?</p><p>He sounded so very serious that she knew this wasn\u2019t an instance where he got carried away in the moment and tossed out careless words that had no meaning.</p><p>And she realized something else too. She loved him. Completely. Without reservation.</p><p>She touched his face, wanting the words to be taken as seriously as she\u2019d taken them from him.</p><p>\u201cI love you too, Liam.\u201d</p><p>The relief in his eyes was crushing. It was as if his entire body had been locked in tension and had suddenly been set free. He wrapped both arms around her and pulled her to him in a fierce embrace.</p><p>\u201cDo you mean it?\u201d he asked gruffly against her ear.</p><p>She withdrew immediately, propping up on her elbow so they could see eye to eye.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d she said. \u201cI mean every word. You aren\u2019t some passing fancy for me. I don\u2019t have the whole damsel-in-distress thing going on where the weak woman falls for her protector. If you want me to explain it, I\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t. I just do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to explain it,\u201d Liam said. \u201cI just want to hear it again and know you mean it. I never thought . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever thought what?\u201d she asked gently.</p><p>His mouth twisted and discomfort registered in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI never thought a girl like you would give a guy like me a second look.\u201d</p><p>She blinked, completely at a loss for words. \u201cGirl like me? Guy like you? What on earth do you mean? Liam, you\u2019re beautiful,\u201d she blurted. \u201cYou\u2019re successful. Confident. You have a heart of gold. You\u2019re striking to look at. Any woman would count herself lucky that you\u2019d give her a second glance. On the other hand, I\u2019m a cowardly nitwit. I\u2019ve trusted the wrong people. I\u2019ve made bad decision after bad decision. I\u2019ve lied to you,\u201d she said painfully. \u201cI\u2019m weak. I gave up my identity and all I was to a man I never should have looked at twice. And you actually think that you somehow don\u2019t deserve my love? Good God. I\u2019m the lucky one here. I not only have you but also Noah, and you both care about me. I can\u2019t wrap my head around it, but I\u2019m not questioning it, because I don\u2019t want anything to persuade you differently.\u201d</p><p>He smiled and twisted his fingers in her long, dark hair. \u201cStriking to look at, huh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re gorgeous,\u201d she murmured as she leaned in to kiss him. \u201cYou\u2019re also mine. Any woman looking at you better keep her distance. I\u2019m very possessive with my man.\u201d</p><p>His grin broadened. \u201cYour man. I like that. And I am, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I do. Now I really need to get up and brush my teeth before we start kissing again.\u201d</p><p>He laughed and rolled out of bed, taking a moment to stretch before relaxing his broad shoulders again.</p><p>She was struck by how magnificent his body was. He was standing naked in front of her, and she hadn\u2019t lied. He was simply beautiful. She\u2019d never grow tired of watching him.</p><p>He was semihard with his morning erection and it made her want to coax it to further rigidity.</p><p>Was she bold enough to make an overture? What if he turned her down? She hated the anxiety that crept up her neck at the thought of propositioning him.</p><p>She closed her eyes. She was being an idiot.</p><p>She stretched languidly, giving him a good view of her naked body. His eyes darkened and his cock twitched, going from semi-erect to three-quarters in two seconds flat.</p><p>\u201cThink you could find a condom in the time it takes me to brush my teeth?\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cHow fast can you brush your teeth?\u201d he growled.</p><p>She smiled and rolled to the edge. She got up and brushed against him, her hand sliding down to cup his balls. She fondled the heavy sac for a long moment before allowing her fingers to dance up his erection to the tip.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p><p>She ducked into the bathroom, grinning the entire time. Hurriedly she brushed her teeth and then worked some of the wildness out of her hair so she didn\u2019t look quite the hag.</p><p>Three minutes later, she was out of the bathroom, and Liam was standing where she left him, only he was already sheathed in a condom and he was enormously aroused.</p><p>Worked for her.</p><p>While she loved the attentive foreplay they always gave her, what she really wanted was a down-and-dirty quickie. And she told him as much.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give you whatever you want, baby,\u201d he said.</p><p>Sucking in a deep breath and gathering her courage to face her fears, she got on the bed, positioning herself on her hands and knees.</p><p>\u201cLauren?\u201d</p><p>Liam\u2019s voice was unsure and concerned. She turned so she could look at him over her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cI want to try,\u201d she said firmly. \u201cBesides, it\u2019s not the same. I\u2019m not flat on my belly pinned by a body so I\u2019m powerless. And . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what, baby?\u201d Liam prompted.</p><p>\u201cI want to get over this fear,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to ever make Noah feel badly about the other night. Help me get through this, Liam. I want it quick and dirty.\u201d</p><p>He moved in behind her, his palms gliding softly over her behind. He parted her thighs further, his fingers caressing the sensitive flesh of her pussy.</p><p>\u201cI can promise you quick,\u201d he said. \u201cBut not dirty, baby. Never dirty. You\u2019re too beautiful for that.\u201d</p><p>Her heart melted. Her fingers curled into the sheets until her hands were tightly fisted balls. She closed her eyes and pictured Liam behind her. Liam pushing into her.</p><p>And then he did.</p><p>NOAH pushed himself up from the floor and glanced at his watch. Damn but they were going to be late. He listened for any noise coming from the bedroom, the sound of a shower, anything to let him know Liam and Lauren were awake and moving.</p><p>He was going to have to wake them up so they could get moving if they were going to make it out to the Colters\u2019 by eight.</p><p>He opened the door to her bedroom and was greeted by the sight of Lauren on her hands and knees and Liam pounding into her from behind. Lauren\u2019s head was thrown back and Liam\u2019s big hands gripped her hips as his cock disappeared into her pussy over and over.</p><p>Noah\u2019s own cock hardened painfully. It was an erotic sight to behold and an unwanted stab of jealousy pierced his chest. She trusted Liam enough to let him fuck her from behind.</p><p>Liam looked up, his gaze locking with Noah\u2019s. Then he lowered his big body over Lauren\u2019s much smaller one and said close to her ear, \u201cNoah\u2019s going to take you now, baby. You wanted quick and hot. How about two men taking turns fucking you from behind?\u201d</p><p>Lauren\u2019s eyes flew open and she found Noah, her eyes glowing with lust and desire. Noah\u2019s initial jealousy disappeared, leaving him faintly ashamed. It was clear she wanted both and that she was working hard to overcome her fears.</p><p>Liam withdrew, his cock heavy and stiff and he looked expectantly at Noah. All thoughts of time and being late fled. He moved toward her, his hand fumbling with the fly of his jeans. Liam tossed him a condom and Noah rolled it on, leaving his jeans pushed down to his hips.</p><p>Lauren\u2019s pussy was swollen from Liam\u2019s hard fucking, and Noah twitched with impatience to drive just as deep inside her as Liam had been. He leaned down to press a gentle kiss to the small of her back, just so she\u2019d know he was here and what was about to happen. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Then he positioned himself between her slim thighs, fit his cock to her small opening and pushed inward, forcing her to accommodate his width and length.</p><p>\u201cHarder,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He pushed down his own fears of hurting her or frightening her and let himself go, doing what he\u2019d wanted to do from the moment he\u2019d met her. Mark her. Make her his own. Possess her and own her.</p><p>He pounded into her, his need for her all consuming. His orgasm rose, edgy and sharp. It took everything he had to pull out, but he didn\u2019t want it to end this quickly and he was a second from exploding.</p> <p>Liam pushed in, taking Noah\u2019s place. Lauren moaned and dropped her head a little as Liam thrust inside her again. She angled her upper body downward until her cheek rested against the mattress, but the entire time, she was pushing herself back to meet Liam\u2019s thrusts.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m coming, baby,\u201d Liam ground out. \u201cYou wanna do yours now or wait for Noah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll wait,\u201d she said.</p><p>Liam let out a roar and thrust into her so hard that it shook her and the entire bed. Then for a long moment, he rested against her, buried deep inside her, his eyes closed, his hands resting possessively on her body.</p><p>Finally he withdrew, leaving her opened, her pussy a darker pink and still swollen.</p> <p>Noah couldn\u2019t resist running his fingers over the puffy lips. So soft and silken. She moaned and twisted restlessly as he fingered her clit.</p><p>\u201cUse your hand, honey,\u201d he whispered huskily. \u201cI\u2019m not going to last long and I want you with me.\u201d</p><p>Her hand slid through her tight curls, bumping against his, as she found the sensitive nub he\u2019d fondled. Satisfied that she was prepared, he positioned himself against her damp opening and pushed in, relishing the feel of her snug heat surrounding him, enveloping and swallowing him whole.</p><p>Remembering her request before, he thrust harder and faster. He closed his eyes as sweet pleasure worked over every inch of his body. His balls drew up, tightening until he thought they might explode. Tension built.</p><p>She cried out and went liquid around him. She was slick and hot as her orgasm made it easier to get deeper inside her.</p><p>His mind went blank. He had no awareness of anything but the overwhelming ecstasy of being inside her. And then finally, finally the building tension released.</p> <p>He shuddered with mind-numbing pleasure. He strained into her, wanting deeper, not wanting the moment to end. Only the knowledge that she\u2019d be extremely sensitive after her orgasm kept him from continuing to push into her over and over until he was incapable of doing so.</p><p>Reluctantly he withdrew from her quivering body. He was so sensitive that he couldn\u2019t bear the condom on for another second. He stripped it off, tossed it into the trash can beside her bed, and then he and Liam helped her into a sitting position.</p><p>\u201cQuick enough for you, baby?\u201d Liam drawled.</p><p>Her lips curled with amusement. \u201cThat was amazing. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>She turned to face Noah, her fingers going to his jaw in the lightest of touches. \u201cI wanted to try again. I won\u2019t allow him to control my mind when I\u2019m with you and Liam. You both mean too much to me to allow anyone else to intrude on our time together.\u201d</p><p>He captured her fingers and kissed the tip of each one. \u201cAnd to think I was on my way in here to hurry you two up.\u201d</p><p>She laughed softly. \u201cAre we late?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, we are,\u201d Noah said. \u201cBut for that, I\u2019ll be late every damn day from now on.\u201d</p> <p>Chapter 22</p><p>IT was nearly eight thirty when Lauren, Noah and Liam pulled up to the Colters\u2019 home. Max and Callie as well as Lily, Seth, Michael and Dillon were already there.</p><p>Butterflies stumbled around her stomach as she sat in the front seat, staring through the windshield to the front porch. Liam reached across the seat and squeezed her hand.</p><p>\u201cReady for this? It\u2019s not too late to back out. No phone calls have been made.\u201d</p><p>It shamed her that for a brief moment, she considered doing just that. It was instinctive to want to run and hide, but then that\u2019s what she\u2019d been doing for far too long.</p><p>Taking a calming breath, she shook her head. \u201cNo, I need to do this. Not just for the women he\u2019s brutalized and murdered, but I need to do it for me.\u201d</p><p>Noah shifted forward from the backseat. \u201cJust remember that Liam and I are behind you. Always. No matter what goes on in here, no matter if emotions run high. We support you one hundred percent, no matter what you choose to do.\u201d</p><p>She turned, allowing her love for both men to shine in her eyes. She only hoped he could see it. That he knew it and felt it. The words had come easily with Liam because he\u2019d given them first. She needed to give them to Noah. And she would, as soon as they got through the meeting with her family.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she choked out.</p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d Liam said as he opened his door.</p><p>Taking one more deep breath, she opened her door and stepped into the sunlight, allowing it to remove the chill deep inside her chest.</p><p>Noah and Liam flanked her as they walked toward the porch. The door was opened by Holly, who immediately pulled Lauren into her firm embrace.</p><p>\u201cHow are you, baby?\u201d Holly asked in her sweet, motherly voice that always made Lauren feel as though she\u2019d come home.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, Mama C. Or I will be,\u201d she amended.</p><p>Holly pulled away, her eyes worried and dark. \u201cMax is upset. I thought you should know so you don\u2019t get blindsided.\u201d</p><p>Lauren\u2019s stomach somersaulted, and she glanced anxiously up at Noah and Liam.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be fine, honey,\u201d Noah soothed. \u201cWe\u2019ll get through this together.\u201d</p><p>Holly took her hand and pulled her into the house, leaving the men to follow.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re right,\u201d Holly said. \u201cWe\u2019ll get through this together. Just like we always do. Max was just caught off guard and he\u2019s not taking it well.\u201d</p><p>As they entered the living room, everyone turned to look in Lauren\u2019s direction. Max, who\u2019d been sitting beside Callie on the couch, shot to his feet, his expression dark.</p><p>Callie put her hand up to his arm and murmured something to him, but he shook her off and advanced toward Lauren. But it wasn\u2019t her he was intent on questioning. He stopped a short distance away, his angry gaze finding Noah and Liam.</p><p>\u201cDo one of you want to explain why I\u2019m getting information from Seth and not either of you? Last time I checked, I was signing your checks. Your job is to protect my sister and report to me. I didn\u2019t know of any of this and I should have been the first to know,\u201d he seethed.</p><p>Even as he spoke, he pulled Lauren into his side, wrapping a protective arm around her. She could feel the anger\u2014and the tension\u2014vibrating from him.</p><p>Noah\u2019s eyes narrowed and Liam\u2019s lip curled into a snarl.</p><p>\u201cWhen have you received a bill from us ever?\u201d Noah snapped. \u201cBetter check your records, Wilder, because we haven\u2019t asked you for a cent. Lauren isn\u2019t a damn job to us. Our priority is keeping her safe, not keeping you posted on every detail we have before we even know if it\u2019s an issue. We spoke to Seth last night and then set up this morning\u2019s meeting so we could plan accordingly.\u201d</p><p>Max stiffened even further, apparently not appeased by Noah\u2019s explanation.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you saying?\u201d Max asked softly. \u201cJust what is the nature of your relationship with my sister? I damn sure didn\u2019t hire you to take advantage of her.\u201d</p><p>Lauren jerked away from Max\u2019s hold. \u201cMax, stop it. Please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d say that\u2019s none of your damn business,\u201d Liam said in an equally soft, dangerous tone.</p><p>\u201cThe hell it\u2019s not!\u201d Max burst out.</p><p>\u201cMax, enough, son,\u201d Adam Colter said firmly as he inserted himself between Max and where Noah and Liam stood. \u201cWe aren\u2019t going to get anywhere with you and Noah and Liam snarling at each other like a bunch of pit bulls.\u201d</p><p>Holly put her arm around Lauren and led her beyond Max and farther into the living room where the others sat.</p><p>Dillon and Michael were both perched on the hearth, while Lily sat next to Callie on one of the sofas. Seth, Ryan and Ethan occupied the other couch, and two armchairs were vacant. Chairs from the dining room had been brought into the living room to accommodate more people and were staggered between the couches and armchairs.</p><p>Holly led Lauren to the couch to sit with Lily and Callie. Lauren settled next to Callie, who immediately took her hand, holding tightly in support. Holly took position on Lauren\u2019s other side and wrapped an arm around Lauren\u2019s shoulders.</p><p>Lauren couldn\u2019t help but smile. The Colter women had closed ranks around her. Not even Max would dare to take on Mama C, much less her and Callie and Lily.</p><p>\u201cHave a seat,\u201d Adam instructed Noah and Liam. \u201cAccording to Seth, we have a lot to discuss.\u201d</p><p>Noah and Liam walked past Max, who was still standing and seething with anger. Max\u2019s jaw was drawn tight when he turned to follow the others into the living room. He glanced toward the couch where the women sat, clearly not happy that he was being blocked by both his wife and his mother-in-law.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll get over it,\u201d Callie murmured. \u201cHe\u2019s just worried about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Lauren whispered back.</p><p>When Max had settled onto one of the dining room tables\u2014across from where Noah and Liam had taken their seats in armchairs\u2014Adam turned one of the wooden chairs around and straddled it so he could take in everyone.</p><p>Seth leaned forward, his hands clasped together as his elbows pressed into his knees. \u201cI took the liberty of bringing everyone up to date on what we discussed last night. I figured it would save time so that we could move forward once you all arrived.\u201d</p><p>Noah and Liam both nodded their agreement.</p><p>\u201cI waited for you to arrive to give you the rundown on the women you wanted me to run through the system.\u201d Seth\u2019s lips thinned as he continued. \u201cIt\u2019s not good.\u201d</p><p>Lauren\u2019s heart plummeted. \u201cAre they dead?\u201d she choked out.</p><p>Seth grimaced. \u201cYes, honey, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>All the blood drained from her face. Noah and Liam swore.</p><p>\u201cWhat women?\u201d Ryan Colter demanded. \u201cWhat are we talking about here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe disk that has the information Lauren copied from Knight\u2019s computer has a list of the women who work or worked for him. Some had notations by their names that sounded ominous,\u201d Noah said. \u201cWe had Seth check to see if he could find any information about them. Mainly whether they were still alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did they die?\u201d Liam asked bluntly.</p><p>Seth merely shook his head. His silence spoke volumes, and it was obvious he didn\u2019t want to go into details in front of Lauren and the other women.</p><p>Callie\u2019s hold on Lauren\u2019s hand tightened, and Holly hugged her closer to her side.</p><p>\u201cSomething has to be done about this bastard,\u201d Max said grimly. \u201cI won\u2019t allow a threat to my family to exist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am doing something,\u201d Lauren said softly, drawing the attention of every occupant of the room.</p><p>She was done having Seth or even Noah and Liam do her talking for her. This was on her. She was the only person who could stand up and take Joel Knight down. Not Liam. Not Noah. Not her brother. Not Seth or any of the other Colters.</p><p>Max\u2019s stare hardened, and he paled as he took in the determination in Lauren\u2019s voice.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean by that, Lauren?\u201d Max asked, alarm clear in his voice.</p><p>The older Colter men frowned. Ryan and Ethan sat forward, casting worried glances in her direction. Callie had a death grip on Lauren\u2019s hand, and she could feel the same worried gazes from the women on either side of her.</p><p>Her nostrils flared as she inhaled sharply. She glanced at Noah and Liam, bolstered by the support in their eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to turn in the evidence I have and testify if necessary, which I\u2019m sure it will be.\u201d</p><p>The explosive responses were immediate.</p><p>\u201cThe hell you are!\u201d Max shouted, bolting to his feet.</p><p>\u201cLauren, I\u2019m not sure you should make that decision so quickly,\u201d Adam said, a frown marring his face.</p><p>\u201cDo you think that\u2019s best?\u201d Ryan asked, his expression a mirror of Adam\u2019s.</p><p>There were more questions. Exclamations of worry. A volley of conversation between the dads and Seth, and then Max and Noah and Liam. It was all a dull roar that made her head ache.</p><p>Only the women remained quiet. Callie gripped Lauren\u2019s hand so tightly that her fingers were starting to tingle. Holly had gone completely still next to Lauren, and Lily leaned forward, her worried gaze seeking out Lauren\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m scared for you, Lauren,\u201d Callie whispered.</p><p>\u201cSo am I,\u201d Lily said just as quietly.</p><p>Holly reached across Lauren\u2019s lap, holding out her hand to both Lily and Callie until all four women were connected. Lauren allowed the quiet strength of these women\u2014survivors\u2014bleed into her soul.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m scared too,\u201d Lauren admitted. \u201cBut the one thing you\u2019ve all taught me is that I have to do the right thing. A woman\u2014women\u2014are dead because of me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She shook her head when they would have refuted her statement.</p><p>\u201cNot because of me. I know that I\u2019m not responsible for Joel\u2019s actions. But I could have prevented at least some of their deaths. Maybe I could have only prevented one. But how many more will die or be abused or degraded because I\u2019m afraid? I don\u2019t want to spend the rest of my life hiding. I don\u2019t want to forever be looking over my shoulder. I just want . . . peace.\u201d</p><p>It was only at the end of her impassioned speech that she realized her voice had carried beyond the scope of the other women, and that everyone else had quieted to listen to what she was saying.</p><p>As she glanced up, every single one of the Colters\u2014and Max\u2014were staring at her with gentle understanding, worry, fear and . . . pride.</p> <p>She swallowed, and then again as the knot swelled in her throat and tears burned her eyelids.</p><p>\u201cI want to be somebody you can all be proud of,\u201d she choked out. \u201cAnd right now I\u2019m not proud of myself, so how can I expect anyone else to be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh honey,\u201d Holly said, emotion clouding her voice.</p><p>She hugged Lauren to her and rocked back and forth, stroking her hair.</p><p>\u201cListen to me, baby. I want you to look at me.\u201d</p> <p>Lauren reluctantly lifted her gaze to the older woman and was taken aback at the pride and consternation in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cWe are proud of you. So very proud. Now it\u2019s time to forgive yourself for the mistakes you\u2019ve made. You can\u2019t continue to beat yourself up over choices you\u2019ve made. You have to be willing to let go and forgive yourself. No one else blames you. Only you. I look at you and see a beautiful, kind young lady with a heart as big as these mountains. I couldn\u2019t be more proud of you even if I\u2019d given birth to you. You\u2019re one of mine. Never doubt that. And as anyone will tell you, what\u2019s mine is mine, and I love what\u2019s mine fiercely and without reserve or condition.\u201d</p><p>Tears slid down Lauren\u2019s cheeks and a sob hiccupped from her throat. \u201cI love you too,\u201d she whispered. \u201cAll of you.\u201d</p><p>Holly hugged her again, squeezing her until she was breathless. After a moment, she gently separated herself from Lauren and stroked the hair from Lauren\u2019s face. Then she turned to Noah and Liam, all business.</p><p>\u201cWhat is your plan for this?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>Chapter 23</p> <p>IT was hard for Liam not to charge over and take Lauren in his arms. It damn near broke his heart to listen to her break down in front of the people she loved most. He wanted to shield her from any hurt or stress, but her decision meant that hurt\u2014and stress\u2014were inevitable.</p><p>When Holly Colter turned her determined stare on him and Noah, and demanded to know what the plan was, he glanced at Noah and then at Seth.</p><p>Seth spoke first.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have one yet, Mom,\u201d he said gently. \u201cIt\u2019s why I called the family together, so we plot out the best course and make damn sure Lauren is protected.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s our first and only priority, ma\u2019am,\u201d Noah said in a serious tone.</p><p>\u201cI still want to know what that means exactly,\u201d Max growled. \u201cI\u2019m having serious issues with the fact that you took advantage of Lauren during a time she was emotionally and physically at a disadvantage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt means that I love her and I\u2019m not going to stand by while someone is a threat to her,\u201d Liam all but roared. He was pissed and growing more pissed by the minute. Now wasn\u2019t the time to bring this shit up. \u201cFurthermore, you don\u2019t call the shots. Noah and I don\u2019t work for you. We haven\u2019t accepted one goddamn cent from you and it\u2019s going to stay that way. Lauren is ours and what that means is that we don\u2019t take orders from anyone when it comes to her safety and well-being. Is that clear enough for you?\u201d</p><p>Holly rounded on Max, her mouth tight and her eyes shooting holes through Lauren\u2019s brother. \u201cThat\u2019s enough out of you, young man. This isn\u2019t the time or the place to bring up a personal matter that is none of your concern. What\u2019s important here is what we do going forward to make sure Lauren is protected.\u201d</p> <p>Liam wanted to give Holly Colter a high five. She was a little scary when she got pissed off. She was like a mama lion protecting her cubs, and look out if anyone messed with them.</p><p>When Liam glanced back at Lauren, she was staring at him, her eyes filled with love and gratitude. Warmth traveled through his body as surely as if she were in his arms.</p><p>She sent the same expression of love in Noah\u2019s direction, and Liam saw that his friend was just as affected as Liam had been.</p><p>\u201cMy wife has a very good point,\u201d Ethan said, speaking up for the first time. \u201cWhat\u2019s important here is what we do to ensure Lauren\u2019s safety. Seth? Do you have ideas, son?\u201d</p><p>Dillon scowled. \u201cOther than making a trip to New York City and ensuring the asshole takes a fall down a long flight of stairs. Twice?\u201d</p><p>Michael smothered a smile. Liam had to cover his own smile when Holly Colter nodded her agreement vigorously.</p><p>\u201cOur first step has to be to decide on a meeting place and conditions,\u201d Noah said.</p><p>\u201cI agree,\u201d Seth said.</p><p>\u201cWe make contact, but we have to make it clear we call the shots,\u201d Liam interjected. \u201cThat includes the meeting place but we also have to be prepared that the D.A. may not follow our set of rules, so we have to be in place well ahead of him, monitor his arrival and not put Lauren in front of him until we\u2019ve determined it\u2019s safe to do so.\u201d</p><p>Adam nodded at that.</p><p>\u201cAnd we need to decide who goes,\u201d Seth said as he surveyed the room.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going,\u201d Max said flatly.</p><p>\u201cNo, you aren\u2019t,\u201d Ryan Colter said just as flatly.</p><p>Everyone turned in surprise that the older man had shut him down so quickly.</p><p>\u201cWhy the hell not?\u201d Max demanded. \u201cLauren is my sister. I\u2019m not going to sit here while someone else is charged with protecting her.\u201d</p><p>Liam remained quiet as he waited for Ryan to speak again. He\u2019d been about to tell Max there was no way in hell he was going, when Ryan had beat him to it.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re too much of a hothead and you\u2019re too pissed off,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cThat\u2019s the very last thing we need in an already volatile situation.\u201d</p><p>Seth nodded his agreement. \u201cAt the risk of pissing you off, man, I agree with Dad.\u201d</p><p>Noah stepped in, his tone placating. \u201cWe don\u2019t want any possible way to trace Lauren back here. You\u2019re a visible guy, Mr. Wilder. The very last thing you want is to bring trouble back to where your family lives. If they can connect Lauren to you, they\u2019ll find her through you.\u201d</p><p>Max looked as though he\u2019d been ready to argue, but he conceded to Noah\u2019s logic.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d he said in a low voice. \u201cThe very last thing I want is to put her in further danger or for anything to threaten the rest of my family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDillon and I will go,\u201d Seth said. \u201cMichael stays here with Lily. At least one of the dads will need to stay as well. I don\u2019t want any of the women to be alone.\u201d</p><p>Liam and Noah both nodded at that.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll want to put her in protective custody,\u201d Adam said in a grim voice.</p><p>Lauren looked up in alarm.</p><p>Adam cast an apologetic look in her direction. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to scare you, sweetheart. The fact of the matter is, you\u2019re a key witness, and this case has far-reaching implications and involves some very high-profile people. They\u2019re going to want to keep you close and put you in the witness protection program until you testify.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNoah? Liam?\u201d Lauren asked in a shaky voice.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve considered that possibility,\u201d Noah said soothingly. \u201cWe\u2019re only going to allow you to do this if it\u2019s on our terms. We want certain things in writing or the D.A. doesn\u2019t get to talk to you. Period. It might get our asses thrown in jail, but you\u2019ll be on your way back here with Seth and the others where you\u2019ll be protected.\u201d</p><p>Her face went white and her eyes widened in alarm.</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t happen, baby,\u201d Liam said calmly. \u201cWe\u2019ll work it out. Trust us.\u201d</p><p>She sucked in her breath and slowly relaxed.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll need use of your jet, Mr. Wilder,\u201d Noah said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want a paper trail, anything with Lauren\u2019s name on it. We don\u2019t want her showing ID, using a credit card. Nothing. We\u2019re going to alter her appearance for her meeting with the D.A. so that if something does go wrong, they won\u2019t have an accurate description of her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were unable to locate any photographs of Joel Knight and Lauren together,\u201d Liam interjected. \u201cNor could we find any people who knew of Lauren. The only people who are likely to know what she looks like are Joel Knight and the people who worked closest with him. One of the women who worked for him ID\u2019d Lauren, but she\u2019s dead now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe kept me isolated,\u201d Lauren said in a low voice. \u201cWe didn\u2019t make many public appearances together and it was always very low key. And I was expected to be the consummate companion. Well dressed, perfectly submissive. In other words a pretty ornament to compliment him. He tried to keep me separate from his \u2018business\u2019 and anyone associated with it. I was basically a plaything he pulled out when it was convenient.\u201d</p><p>The bitterness and self-loathing in her voice ate at Liam. He wanted nothing more than for her to be able to forget the bastard ever existed. They were in for a rough road in the next months. Hell, this thing could stretch out for years.</p><p>\u201cI brought up the witness protection issue because I wanted to advise you to keep her close,\u201d Adam broke in. \u201cDon\u2019t let them separate you. Make sure that if that\u2019s what has to happen, you\u2019re able to stay with her.\u201d He glanced at Holly as he spoke, pain darkening his eyes. \u201cMy wife was once in the same position, and she stayed away from me and my brothers to protect us. That separation was hell for us. If you love her, then make damn sure she stays with you.\u201d</p><p>There was instant agreement from both Ethan and Ryan. Holly\u2019s gaze softened as she stared at her husbands.</p><p>\u201cWe aren\u2019t letting her go, sir,\u201d Noah said, resolve hardening his voice.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so many of you should go,\u201d Holly spoke up.</p><p>Seth\u2019s eyebrow rose.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t give me that look, young man,\u201d she said in exasperation. \u201cHave you looked at the men in this room? There\u2019s no way a whole horde of you are going to go unnoticed when you roll into town. I realize that more is good when it comes to protecting Lauren, but if you\u2019re trying not to gain notice, you\u2019re going to fail miserably if two of my husbands go and two of Lily\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>Michael\u2019s eyes gleamed with amusement. \u201cShe\u2019s got you there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot all of us will be visible,\u201d Seth said patiently. \u201cIn fact, the whole point is to stay out of sight. We\u2019ll fly in at night. Have one person check into a hotel. It means we\u2019ll all have to stay in the same room, but I\u2019d rather not broadcast how many are in our party and as Mom so eloquently put it, if we\u2019re out in broad daylight, we\u2019re not going to go unnoticed. One person goes to the meeting with the D.A., however, we place two of us in the same location in case the situation goes south or it\u2019s a setup. The other three will remain with Lauren with strict instructions that if they aren\u2019t contacted at a prearranged time, they\u2019re to cut and run with Lauren and get the hell out.\u201d</p><p>Lauren lowered her face to her hands and rubbed tiredly. \u201cI can\u2019t allow you all to risk this. It\u2019s starting to scare the hell out of me. All the what-ifs and the possibilities are making me crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t allowing us to do anything,\u201d Dillon said mildly. \u201cYou\u2019re a part of this family. That means we go with you. End of story.\u201d</p><p>Holly nodded approvingly. \u201cThat\u2019s my boy.\u201d</p><p>Seth snorted. \u201cUntil the next time you disown him.\u201d</p><p>Holly silenced him with a quick glare.</p><p>\u201cOkay so we\u2019re agreed on who goes and who stays,\u201d Noah said, sharply bringing the subject back on target. \u201cThe next step is to make contact with the D.A. and see if he bites.\u201d</p><p>Liam sought Lauren\u2019s gaze, waiting until she felt his stare and looked back at him.</p><p>\u201cYou ready to do this?\u201d he asked softly, giving her one last opportunity to back out.</p><p>She slowly lifted her chin and straightened her shoulders. Callie tightened her grip on Lauren\u2019s hand and Lily reached across Callie\u2019s lap to add her own. Holly wrapped her arm around Lauren\u2019s shoulders, lending her strength as the other women had done.</p><p>There in the tight hold of her family, Lauren nodded. Her voice was firm and full of resolve.</p><p>\u201cYes. I\u2019m ready. Make the call.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 24</p><p>SWEETIE, you\u2019ve got to stop pacing,\u201d Holly soothed from her perch at the bar. \u201cYou\u2019re going to wear a hole in my floor.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Lauren paused and sighed. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. This is making me crazy. How long can it possibly take to make a phone call?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot just any phone call,\u201d Callie pointed out.</p><p>\u201cCome sit,\u201d Lily urged. \u201cAll this anxiety can\u2019t be good for you. I know it\u2019s not good for me.\u201d</p><p>Lauren plopped onto the stool next to Holly, wanting the comfort and guidance of the older woman.</p> <p>\u201cWhat made you decide to stand up to your ex-husband? I can\u2019t imagine the strength it took to separate yourself from the Colter men and be alone through that whole process.\u201d</p><p>Holly sighed. \u201cIt\u2019s not as courageous as you make it sound. The truth was, I was terrified. I had just been horribly attacked by a man hired by my ex-husband to kill me. Ryan had been shot trying to protect me. I thought he was dead.\u201d</p><p>Her voice quivered and pain filled her eyes.</p><p>\u201cAll I could think was that Ryan had been hurt because of me, and I didn\u2019t want to lose the men I loved more than anything. I also knew that they\u2019d never agree to let me go, so I made the decision for them. I contacted the D.A. in San Francisco. I arranged for him to come to the hospital to talk to me, and then I left the hospital in protective custody and remained so for several months. It was during that time that I learned I was pregnant.\u201d</p><p>Her lips turned up into a rueful smile.</p> <p>\u201cThe best and worst time of my life. I was overjoyed at the thought of having their child and devastated because I was isolated from them with no definitive timeline. Thank God my ex-husband pled out, which meant I didn\u2019t have to testify. I was only gone for a little over five months, but I swear it felt like an eternity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to be separated from Liam and Noah,\u201d Lauren said in a low voice. She glanced over at the women sitting at the bar. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be separated from any of you either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t want you to go either,\u201d Callie said fiercely. \u201cThis will work out, Lauren. It has to. You\u2019ll be safer here with us than in any witness protection program. There\u2019s no way the dads or my brothers or Max and Liam and Noah are going to let someone come into our home and hurt you.\u201d</p><p>Lauren sighed again. \u201cThat\u2019s a nice thought and it sounds good to say, and I have no doubt that the intention is certainly sincere. But how realistic is it to say that I\u2019m untouchable? We have no way of knowing what Joel will do. As afraid as I am, I could not bear the thought of something happening to one of the dads or to one of Lily\u2019s husbands or my brother.</p><p>\u201cOr the men I love,\u201d she added quietly.</p><p>\u201cOh honey,\u201d Holly said, squeezing her hand tightly. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to stop taking on so much. You aren\u2019t to blame if something happens to one of our men. That blame lies squarely on the shoulders of Joel Knight.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd is that what you thought when you decided to go away from the dads?\u201d Lauren asked pointedly.</p><p>Holly flushed, her cheeks going pink. \u201cThe point is, I wasn\u2019t thinking at the time. I was scared out of my mind. I\u2019d gone through a traumatic experience and I was acting on instinct. My instinct was to protect them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy instinct is to protect the people I love,\u201d Lauren said.</p><p>\u201cWe understand,\u201d Lily said. \u201cReally, we do, Lauren. But let them help you. Our strength is in our family. Not one individual.\u201d</p><p>Holly beamed at her daughter-in-law. \u201cMy daughters are extremely smart women. And Lily is exactly right. Our strength doesn\u2019t come from one person. It\u2019s from our bond. Our willingness to go to bat for one another.\u201d</p><p>They immediately went quiet when Liam entered the kitchen, his expression grim. Lauren\u2019s heart dropped to her toes and she reached blindly for Holly\u2019s hand, needing her support more than ever.</p><p>Holly grabbed her hand and gripped it with bruising force.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened, what did he say?\u201d Lauren blurted.</p> <p>\u201cHe wants to talk to you,\u201d Liam said.</p><p>Her eyes widened. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe just wants to make sure we\u2019re not jerking him around. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s anything to worry about. Just don\u2019t tip your hand in the phone call. No names. He can say what he wants, but keep your responses to the minimum. Yes or no answers are best. If there\u2019s anything you\u2019re unsure of, you put him on hold and run it by us. Okay?\u201d</p><p>She swallowed and nodded. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>He held out his hand to her. Holly disentangled her hand from Lauren\u2019s and urged her forward. Liam wrapped his arm around her, squeezing her briefly before guiding her into the living room, where the others sat.</p><p>Noah was sitting on the couch, his hand curled around a cordless phone. When he saw Lauren, he put the phone back on the base and hit the button for the speaker. He held up one finger to his lips to signal to Lauren not to mention that everyone was listening in. Then he pointed at her to begin the conversation.</p><p>\u201cH-hello?\u201d Lauren began hesitantly.</p><p>\u201cWith whom am I speaking to?\u201d</p><p>The man\u2019s voice was sharp and distinct, and it made Lauren instantly nervous.</p><p>She glanced up at Liam, who nodded that she should answer.</p><p>\u201cLauren Wilder,\u201d she responded.</p><p>\u201cAnd, Ms. Wilder, would you be so kind as to provide a few simple pieces of information to verify your identity?\u201d</p><p>She frowned, her brow furrowing tightly. Noah held up a hand and nodded and then motioned for her to answer.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she reluctantly agreed.</p><p>\u201cCan you give us your last known address?\u201d</p><p>She frowned harder. Technically her last address was her apartment here in Clyde and no way in hell she was giving this man that information. And before that, there was the apartment that Max had moved her into after she\u2019d left Joel. Again, no way she was giving that out either. But neither of those addresses were ones the police would have any knowledge of, so they wouldn\u2019t expect either.</p><p>Liam was furiously scribbling something on a piece of paper and then he held up a notebook that said, give him the address of the residence you lived with Joel.</p><p>In a halting voice, she gave the man on the phone the address of the penthouse where she and Joel had spent a year.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d the man said. \u201cCan you also verify your date of birth and the town you were born in?\u201d</p><p>All the questions were making her uncomfortable, but Noah and Liam were telling her to answer, so she provided the requested information, wishing they could just get on with it.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Ms. Wilder. I can\u2019t tell you how glad we are to hear from you. My office has been looking for you for quite some time.\u201d</p><p>The relief was obvious in his voice, but his words sent alarm shrieking through her system. She yanked her head upward, fearfully seeking out Noah and Liam once more.</p><p>Noah reached over and squeezed her knee in a gesture meant to soothe her, but the fact that there were even more people looking for her freaked her out.</p><p>\u201cNow that her identity has been established, you\u2019ll speak to me about the arrangements,\u201d Noah inserted bluntly.</p><p>\u201cYes, of course Mr. . . . What did you say your name was again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>There was a lengthy pause, and then Noah motioned for Liam to take Lauren away again. She frowned, wanting to hear what was said, but Noah punched the speakerphone off and picked up the phone again.</p><p>\u201cCome on, baby,\u201d Liam murmured.</p><p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t I hear?\u201d she asked as they walked back to the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cBecause we\u2019d rather whatever is decided on to come from me and Noah,\u201d Liam said frankly. \u201cHearing suggestions or bits and pieces is just going to cause you unnecessary stress. Noah won\u2019t agree to anything that isn\u2019t in your best interest, and he damn sure won\u2019t put you in a position we feel is unsafe.\u201d</p><p>She went into his arms, wanting and needing his hug. She looped her arms around his waist and rubbed her cheek against his chest.</p><p>\u201cI know you won\u2019t. I\u2019m just scared, Liam. Not just for me. I\u2019m scared for all of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on, Liam?\u201d Holly demanded. \u201cWe\u2019re all dying to know here. If someone doesn\u2019t tell me soon, I\u2019m going to hurt someone.\u201d</p><p>Liam grinned. \u201cSorry, Mrs. C. As soon as I know, you\u2019ll know. I promise. Noah is shoring up the details now. The D.A. was leery about proceeding without knowing whether he was actually talking to Lauren or not. Apparently they\u2019ve been searching for her, which means they\u2019ve wanted to question her for a while. If that\u2019s the case, he\u2019s going to want to talk to her immediately. He\u2019ll be beside himself over the evidence that Lauren has.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just take care of my baby,\u201d Holly said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do my best to make sure nothing ever hurts her again,\u201d Liam said in a somber voice.</p><p>\u201cLily, are you okay?\u201d Lauren asked, alarmed at Lily\u2019s paleness.</p><p>Holly and Callie both jerked around, their worried gazes locking immediately onto the heavily pregnant woman. Holly hurried toward the bar, putting her arm around Lily\u2019s shoulders.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d Lily protested.</p><p>\u201cIf my boys see you looking as pale as you are right now, it\u2019s all over but the cryin\u2019,\u201d Holly said grimly. \u201cThey\u2019ll have you home and in bed, worrying their fool heads off. Talk to me. Are you feeling okay? Is it the baby?\u201d</p><p>Lily shook her head. \u201cI didn\u2019t sleep well last night. I\u2019m worried about Lauren. Nothing else. Honest. Baby is sleeping right now and not trying to two-step on my ribs.\u201d</p><p>Lauren\u2019s lips turned down in unhappiness. Everyone in the Colter family was affected by her situation. She wished now that it was just her, Noah and Liam going and the others didn\u2019t have to be involved.</p><p>Lily was about to have a baby, and she had to worry herself over the fact that two of her three husbands were off with Lauren going blind into a situation where the worst could happen.</p><p>\u201cIf you say one word about what I think you\u2019re thinking, I\u2019m going to hurt you,\u201d Lily said menacingly.</p><p>Lauren\u2019s eyebrows went up as she realized Lily was talking to her.</p><p>Lily got clumsily off the bar stool and walked over to where Lauren stood. She took Lauren\u2019s hand and held it between them.</p><p>\u201cSeth is the sheriff. Protecting people is what he does. He\u2019s called out at all times of the night. There\u2019s never one of them I don\u2019t worry about him. There\u2019s no way he\u2019d ever allow a threat against his family to go unresolved. It\u2019s just who he is.\u201d</p><p>She smiled softly and glanced at Holly. \u201cI think he has a lot of his fathers in him. They all do.\u201d</p><p>Love for her husbands and her sons shone like a beacon in Holly\u2019s eyes. She turned that loving gaze on Lauren and her daughter-in-law.</p><p>\u201cSeth has the very best of his fathers,\u201d Holly said, her voice rich with emotion. \u201cMy boys have never once disappointed me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my job,\u201d Callie said dryly.</p><p>Holly chuckled. \u201cI\u2019ll admit, I like it that for the most part your days of wanderlust and restless spirit are in the past. I like having you here, at home where you belong. You and Max both. But baby, you\u2019ve never disappointed me.\u201d Her tone was firm even as love and pride shone in her gaze. \u201cNone of my babies, whether biological or not, have ever disappointed me. I can be disappointed in the fact that you aren\u2019t home where you belong and still be as proud of you as I can be.\u201d</p><p>She pulled Lauren into a fierce embrace. \u201cAnd now maybe you\u2019ll be home where you belong too. Having you all right here where I can fuss over you and mother you endlessly would make me the happiest woman in the world.\u201d</p><p>Lauren didn\u2019t dare peek at Liam, because this was still a painful subject for her and one she tried not to broach with Noah and Liam too often.</p><p>They may have strong feelings for each other. They may have made a sincere commitment. But at the end of the day, Clyde, Colorado, was a long way\u2014a lifetime away\u2014from New York City and the life she\u2019d once led there.</p><p>A life she no longer wanted.</p><p>Chapter 25</p><p>NOAH hung up the phone and eyed the other men gathered in the room. \u201cOkay, well you heard the details. Anyone have something I didn\u2019t cover in the conversation?\u201d</p><p>Seth shook his head. \u201cI think we should get to Raleigh at least a day ahead of Castanetti, if not two. I want to be there when he checks into the hotel, and I want to monitor his movements, phone calls, whatever we can get a lead on.\u201d</p><p>Noah had wanted the D.A. to think that Lauren had fled further down the East Coast. A logical place for someone in the New York City area to go. He\u2019d purposely dropped several innuendos to make Castanetti think that Lauren was even now along the Eastern Seaboard.</p><p>\u201cI can have the jet ready whenever you need it,\u201d Max said. \u201cI\u2019ll file it as a golfing trip for executives of my company. The flight will originate officially from New York City, so I\u2019ll have it moved immediately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll travel to Denver together,\u201d Noah continued. \u201cI don\u2019t want Lauren alone or unattended for any length of time, no matter how short. I don\u2019t even want her going to the bathroom alone. Once we arrive in Raleigh, I\u2019ll meet with Castanetti, but Liam and Seth will be in the same restaurant a few tables away.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He turned to the older Colters and Dillon. \u201cI\u2019ll want the three of you to remain with Lauren at the hotel we choose. We\u2019ll have a set time to report in and if you don\u2019t hear from us, if we\u2019re so much as a minute late, you\u2019re to cut and run with her. Get her to the airport as fast as possible and get the hell out of there. The only priority is her safety. If something happens to me and Liam, I\u2019ll want you to take her home and take whatever steps are necessary to ensure her protection.\u201d</p><p>The others nodded their understanding.</p><p>\u201cOkay then, I\u2019d like to take Lauren back home so Liam and I can talk to her privately,\u201d Noah said. \u201cWe\u2019ll check back in before we take out for Raleigh. If we leave in three days, that gives us plenty of time to arrive ahead of the D.A. and set up.\u201d</p><p>Adam, Ryan, Dillon and Seth nodded their agreement.</p> <p>To Ethan, Michael and Max, Noah grew more serious. \u201cYou\u2019ll need to be on guard while we\u2019re gone. We have no idea how far reaching this is or what Joel Knight will do in order to keep Lauren quiet. You\u2019ll need to watch Holly, Callie and Lily like a hawk. Don\u2019t let them go anywhere alone, and make sure one of you is always with them.\u201d</p><p>The other men scowled and crossed their arms over their broad chests. Their body language said all they didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll keep in touch,\u201d Noah said quietly. \u201cRight now I want to take Lauren home. She\u2019s upset and shook up. I want a chance to explain what\u2019s happening to her privately so she\u2019s not considering the potential danger to her family. She\u2019s very reluctant to do anything that causes any of you harm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s ours,\u201d Adam said simply. \u201cIt\u2019s what we do for family.\u201d He paused a long moment and then looked to both Liam and Noah, taking them both into his intent gaze.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re family now too. That protection extends to you.\u201d</p> <p>Noah swallowed, blindsided by the surge of emotion he felt at the older man\u2019s words. Noah knew he had family. Liam\u2019s parents. They were as much his parents as if he\u2019d been born to them.</p><p>But as soon as he\u2019d walked into the Colter home, as soon as he\u2019d met Seth and Seth\u2019s brothers and knew how fiercely protective of Lauren they were and of their own women, there\u2019d been a part of him that had selfishly wanted that connection himself.</p><p>Since he was a teenager, Liam and Liam\u2019s parents had been Noah\u2019s only support. The only people he had to turn to. And now, through Lauren, an amazing, beautiful woman, he had even more extended family. Good people. The kind he\u2019d always wished for.</p><p>\u201cThat means a lot to me, sir,\u201d Noah said, his voice cracking.</p><p>Adam smiled, his eyes full of understanding as if he knew every part of Noah\u2019s past.</p><p>\u201cAnd you can stop calling me sir, son. I\u2019m proud Lauren has men who know the meaning of respect, but you\u2019re family now, so you can either call me Dad like everyone else, or you can call me Adam. And if I know my wife, if you call her Mrs. Colter, she\u2019ll have a kitten. She has a lot of names but all of them are said with love. You can call her Mom, Mama C, Mrs. C, but not Mrs. Colter. She gets persnickety about that.\u201d</p> <p>The knot grew bigger in Noah\u2019s throat and he glanced automatically to Ethan and Ryan Colter to see if they shared Adam\u2019s opinion.</p><p>Ryan Colter stuck out his hand and merely said, \u201cWelcome to the family. I expect you to take good care of our little girl. She\u2019s the baby now. We care a lot about her. She\u2019s been through a rough time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe will,\u201d Liam spoke up from a few feet away as Noah shook Ryan\u2019s hand. \u201cThis isn\u2019t some passing fling for us, sir. I love Lauren. She\u2019s been it for me since the moment I set eyes on her. I didn\u2019t want to let her go when Mr. Wilder came to get her, but I knew she needed time with her family and that she needed time to heal. But there was never a question of me coming for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame goes,\u201d Ryan said gruffly. \u201cYou can call me Ryan or Dad. I\u2019ll answer to either. Mr. Colter just makes me sound old and stuffy.\u201d</p><p>Max cleared his throat and rose. \u201cI need a moment alone with Liam and Noah if the rest of you don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>Ethan glanced sharply at Max, speaking up for the first time. \u201cThat depends on what you plan to say. I don\u2019t want any trouble, and the last thing your sister needs is more turmoil. You upset her and it\u2019s not us you\u2019ll have to worry about, because you\u2019ll have one very pissed-off Holly Colter to contend with.\u201d</p><p>Max shook his head. \u201cThere are some things we need to get aired out. That\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we\u2019ll be in the kitchen,\u201d Adam said. \u201cYou boys come get Lauren when you\u2019re done. I\u2019m sure you have a lot you need to work out between you when you get back to her apartment. But before we go, I do want to extend an invitation for you three to come stay out here. It\u2019s a hell of a lot more isolated. It\u2019s private. And it would be a lot safer than being in town. Those locks on Lauren\u2019s apartment aren\u2019t worth a damn. I\u2019d planned to get in there and fix them once she got moved in, but with everything that\u2019s been going on, there hasn\u2019t been time.\u201d</p> <p>Liam and Noah exchanged glances. Liam lifted his eyebrow and nodded.</p><p>Noah turned back to Adam. \u201cIt\u2019s not a bad idea, sir\u2014Adam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll talk to Lauren about it and get back with you,\u201d Liam added. \u201cI like the idea of having her out of the diner where anyone can see her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust give me a call. We have plenty of room,\u201d Adam said.</p><p>The older Colters filed out of the living room toward the kitchen, leaving their sons to follow. Max remained and Noah braced himself for the confrontation.</p><p>When they were alone, Max glanced sharply at the other two men.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like the speed in which this \u2018relationship\u2019 has progressed,\u201d he said with a frown. \u201cLauren is extremely vulnerable right now.\u201d</p><p>Liam\u2019s lips twitched and he glared at Max. \u201cJust because you had your head up your ass where Callie was concerned doesn\u2019t mean the rest of us do when it comes to our woman.\u201d</p><p>Max\u2019s face flushed a dull red, and then he sighed. \u201cSit down, both of you. I\u2019m not going to try to kick your ass. I just want some answers.\u201d</p><p>Noah took his seat in one of the armchairs. Liam was more reluctant to sit down but perched on the edge of the other armchair.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. I made my share of mistakes with Callie. I fought the inevitable. I\u2019m damn lucky I didn\u2019t lose her and that she has such a loving, generous, forgiving nature.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen perhaps you understand why we\u2019re not willing to do anything to risk Lauren. Physically or emotionally,\u201d Noah said in a low voice. \u201cWe aren\u2019t fighting anything. We want her. No matter how long it takes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, it\u2019s hard for me to wrap my head around the kind of relationship you\u2019re wanting with my sister,\u201d Max said painfully. \u201cThere are so many reasons why, it makes my head spin. I realize the Colters have a very atypical relationship and family. No one blinks an eye over them. It\u2019s just part of the Colter package. You don\u2019t even really question it because you look at them and it\u2019s who they are. And it\u2019s so apparent that those men love their wives and that the women love each man equally. But it\u2019s also like looking at a fantasy. Something that isn\u2019t real. Lauren is my sister. I love her dearly and she\u2019s been hurt far too much in her young life. I want to protect her and I want her to be happy. And while a relationship like the Colters have is just fine for them, the idea of Lauren being involved with both of you concerns the hell out of me.\u201d</p><p>Liam cleared his throat, but Max held up his hand.</p><p>\u201cLet me finish. Let me get it out so that we can clear the air.\u201d</p><p>Noah nodded and gave Liam a quick glance to make him stand down.</p><p>\u201cThe Colters live here. In Clyde. A town they\u2019ve been a fixture in forever. Their son is the sheriff. The dads have friends dating back over thirty years. They live a very isolated existence in a very small population that accepts their unusual arrangement. This isn\u2019t the rest of the world, though. Have you given any thought to where you\u2019ll live with Lauren? Have you considered if you\u2019ll ever have children and what kind of life they\u2019ll have?\u201d</p><p>Max\u2019s words didn\u2019t come out in an angry torrent. He was passionate and obviously concerned for his sister, something Noah could well understand.</p><p>\u201cWhat about your families?\u201d Max added quietly. \u201cAre they going to accept and understand the relationship you and Lauren have?\u201d</p><p>Noah glanced to Liam because it had been the same question he\u2019d had in the beginning.</p><p>\u201cNoah doesn\u2019t have family,\u201d Liam said quietly. \u201cMy family is his family. They\u2019ll love Lauren and as long as Noah and I are happy, they\u2019ll be happy for us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy point is you can\u2019t protect her from everything,\u201d Max said. \u201cThere\u2019ll always be someone who questions or doesn\u2019t understand or openly reviles you and Lauren because of who you love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe understand that,\u201d Liam said gruffly. \u201cAnd we don\u2019t have all the answers right now. The only thing that occupies our mind is getting Lauren through this thing with Joel Knight safely. Once she\u2019s free of that threat, then the choice will be hers to make as to whether she wants a life with us. From there we\u2019ll take it one day at a time, but she\u2019ll never be alone. She\u2019ll always have us. And she\u2019ll always have you and the Colters.\u201d</p><p>Max nodded. \u201cI understand and I appreciate your devotion to her safety. I apologize for some of my earlier remarks. Lauren is very dear to me. After our mom passed, it was just the two of us, and I feel like I failed her because I wasn\u2019t around to see the kind of man Joel Knight was. I was too locked in my own private hell over Callie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cApology accepted,\u201d Noah said.</p><p>Max stared hard at Noah, as if trying to see deeply inside Noah\u2019s head. \u201cDo you love her?\u201d he asked bluntly. \u201cLiam\u2019s been very adamant about his feelings, but you haven\u2019t had anything to say.\u201d</p><p>Noah didn\u2019t need any time to think about his response. He just wasn\u2019t as comfortable about throwing the words around publicly. To him they were intimate, private words and if used too much, they lost their meaning. He coveted them, never having heard them growing up. To him, they were the most precious gift to give to another person.</p><p>\u201cThose words are for Lauren only,\u201d Noah said in a soft voice. \u201cShe means more to me than any other person has ever meant to me. I wouldn\u2019t be here if she didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Apparently satisfied with Noah\u2019s response, Max rose and extended his hand to shake Noah\u2019s. Noah shook it and then Max turned to Liam to do the same.</p><p>\u201cIf you need anything, anything at all, don\u2019t hesitate to contact me,\u201d Max said. \u201cGive me a go date and I\u2019ll make sure the jet is ready.\u201d</p><p>Noah nodded, then he turned to Liam. \u201cLet\u2019s go get Lauren. We have a lot to go over with her.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 26</p><p>WHAT did he say?\u201d Lauren asked anxiously as they pulled away from the Colter house.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s very eager to talk to you,\u201d Noah said. \u201cApparently they\u2019ve been looking for you for some time. They were worried that you\u2019d met a similar fate as some of the other women of Knight\u2019s association.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey thought I was dead?\u201d Lauren gasped.</p><p>\u201cThey weren\u2019t sure what to think. Only that you\u2019d disappeared and they were very interested in talking to you. They\u2019ve been investigating Knight for over a year, but he\u2019s squeaky clean and no one inside his organization will talk. They\u2019ve been looking for any way in they can find.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo he believed you? I mean about the information we have?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t go into that kind of detail,\u201d Liam said grimly</p><p>She frowned. \u201cI don\u2019t understand. What did you tell him then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust that we had incriminating evidence, detailed evidence, that he would be interested in,\u201d Noah said. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to tip our hand this soon. He jumped on the opportunity. I could practically hear him drooling through the phone.\u201d</p><p>Lauren went quiet, Holly Colter\u2019s words echoing through her head.</p><p>\u201cThis could take a long time,\u201d she finally murmured, her gaze sliding sideways so she could take in Noah\u2019s and Liam\u2019s expressions. \u201cI was talking to Holly about when she was in protective custody. It was months before she saw Adam, Ethan and Ryan again, and it could have been much longer except her ex-husband pled out at the last minute instead of going to trial.\u201d</p><p>Liam\u2019s hand slid over her shoulder and squeezed reassuringly. \u201cNo matter how long it takes, we\u2019re going to be right there with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about your family, though?\u201d she asked anxiously. \u201cThis seems like an awful lot to spring on them. Not only are you and Noah involved with the same woman . . . me . . . but now you may have to disappear for months or longer because of what I\u2019m doing.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll call them before we go meet Castanetti,\u201d Liam said. \u201cI\u2019ll explain everything to them then.\u201d</p><p>Lauren twisted her hands in agitation. \u201cI don\u2019t want them to hate me before they ever even meet me.\u201d</p><p>Noah smiled. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine the Prescotts hating anyone, and certainly not someone as sweet and beautiful as you are. They\u2019re going to love you, Lauren. I admit, I was worried at first, but I was doing them a huge disservice. They\u2019re some of the most loving, giving people I\u2019ve ever met. I was fortunate enough to be able to call them my family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re very lucky,\u201d Liam said in a low voice. \u201cWe have your family solidly behind us and they\u2019re obviously hugely loyal, and we have my family who I expect nothing less from. With families like ours, we can\u2019t possibly lose.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d like to meet them,\u201d she said wistfully.</p><p>Noah pulled her hand up to kiss it. \u201cAs soon as we can arrange it, we\u2019ll absolutely take you to meet Liam\u2019s parents. But you come first.\u201d</p><p>When they reached town, Noah parked in front of the clinic in one of the on-street parking slots. He left the SUV running and Liam got out and opened Lauren\u2019s door for her.</p><p>She frowned. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Where are you going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s where we\u2019re going,\u201d Liam said, taking her hand. \u201cYou and I are going to run up to your apartment so you can pack a bag. We\u2019ll tell you all about it and the plan. I promise.\u201d</p> <p>The blood drained from her face. \u201cDo you think we\u2019re in danger here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe just don\u2019t want to take any chances, honey,\u201d Noah said gently. \u201cNow that we\u2019ve made the call to the D.A., we have to prepare for any eventuality. Now go on. I\u2019ll wait here. Liam will go up with you.\u201d</p><p>She turned and numbly allowed Liam to lead her up the stairs to her apartment door. Once there, he took the key from her hand and inserted it into the lock.</p><p>\u201cStay glued to my back,\u201d he ordered tersely.</p><p>She pressed herself to his back as he pushed open the door. He drew his pistol and did a quick sweep of the room.</p><p>\u201cShut the door but don\u2019t lock it,\u201d Liam ordered. \u201cNot yet. You stay here by the door and don\u2019t make a move, while I check the other rooms. If I yell at you to get out or if you hear anything that sounds off, you hightail it back to Noah. Understand?\u201d</p> <p>She nodded.</p><p>He disappeared into her bedroom and returned mere seconds later, his gun down by his side.</p><p>\u201cOkay, go in and get your bag packed. I\u2019ll have mine and Noah\u2019s stuff ready in just a few seconds.\u201d</p><p>It was hard deciding what to pack and what to leave. What if she never came back to this apartment again? It was a hysterical thought, but it wasn\u2019t out of the realm of possibility.</p><p>Her decision had the power to alter the course of her entire life. Not only hers but Noah\u2019s and Liam\u2019s too. Her family\u2019s as well.</p><p>She closed her eyes. Oh God, please let her have made the right decision. The right choice. Just once.</p><p>\u201cLauren?\u201d</p><p>Liam\u2019s call from the living room galvanized her to action. She hurriedly went through her closet and pulled several outfits from the hangers. She only had one suitcase, but she had a duffel bag that could carry quite a bit, so she used that for shoes, underwear and socks, and all her toiletries.</p> <p>In the suitcase, she piled jeans, slacks, two skirts and all the tops she\u2019d chosen. Her stomach churned when she realized that she would most certainly be expected to make a court appearance.</p><p>She went back to her closet and took three dresses from the end, and then made sure she had the matching shoes. How ironic would it be for her to wear one of the dresses Joel had bought for her to testify in the trial to convict him?</p><p>In the end, she couldn\u2019t get her suitcase to zip. Frustrated, she leaned and pushed but couldn\u2019t budge it. Knowing she needed help, she called for Liam.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t get it closed,\u201d she said, flipping her hand impatiently at the open suitcase on her bed.</p><p>Liam\u2019s eyebrow went up. \u201cI can see why.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t sure what to pack,\u201d she said defensively. \u201cI mean packing for an indeterminate amount of time is kind of daunting, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShhh, baby,\u201d he soothed. \u201cIt\u2019s fine. We\u2019ll take what you\u2019ve packed and if you need something later or if you figure out you\u2019ve forgotten something, Noah and I will get it for you. Don\u2019t let this stress you out.\u201d</p><p>She took a deep breath. \u201cI know, I know. I\u2019m sorry. I am kind of freaked out right now.\u201d</p><p>He tugged her into his arms and kissed her brow. After a quick, fierce hug, he gently pulled himself away and went to close her suitcase.</p><p>His muscles bulging, he pushed down on it enough to get it zipped, and then he hefted it upward so he could get it off the bed and onto the floor so it could be rolled.</p><p>\u201cAll ready?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She glanced around the room one last time and then nodded.</p><p>\u201cGet your bag. I\u2019ll take the suitcase. Once I get you into the car with Noah, I\u2019ll come back up for mine and Noah\u2019s bags.\u201d</p><p>She grabbed the oversized duffel and hoisted the strap over her shoulder, and then followed Liam back through the living room and down the stairs to the street.</p><p>Noah got out to help put her bags in the back, and then he guided Lauren to the passenger seat while Liam sprinted back up the stairs for the other bags.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d Lauren asked as they waited for Noah.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to stay tonight in a hotel so we can talk about everything that\u2019s going to go on and so you\u2019re comfortable with the plan. Tomorrow we\u2019ll drive back out to the Colters\u2019, where we\u2019ll stay until we fly out to Raleigh.\u201d</p><p>Liam opened the door to the backseat and slid inside. \u201cAll set. Let\u2019s roll.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou two don\u2019t mind staying at the Colters\u2019,\u201d she asked as Noah pulled out of the parking spot.</p><p>Noah shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s isolated. It\u2019s private. It comes with a hell of a lot of built-in protection. And they\u2019re your family. That\u2019s good enough for me.\u201d</p><p>She smiled.</p><p>\u201cBut for tonight, we wanted you to ourselves,\u201d Liam said from the backseat. \u201cWe have a lot to talk about, yes, but we also want a night with you where we aren\u2019t concerned with what your family can or can\u2019t hear or who\u2019s right down the hall.\u201d</p><p>Her cheeks grew warm, but she couldn\u2019t control the shiver of delight at the veiled promise in his voice.</p><p>Noah reached for her hand and laced his fingers through hers.</p><p>\u201cWe wanted one night\u2014this night\u2014to show you just what you mean to us before we have to deal with what\u2019s coming down the road.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 27</p><p>NOAH went inside the hotel to check them in while Liam waited in the car with Lauren.</p><p>\u201cI hope you and Noah aren\u2019t expecting much with this hotel,\u201d Lauren hedged. \u201cClyde doesn\u2019t have much in the way of fine hotels or lodging. Those are all over in the ski resort towns to the north.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe aren\u2019t concerned with how nice the room is,\u201d Liam said. \u201cAs long as you\u2019re in it, we\u2019re fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d she said quietly, testing the newness of the words on her lips.</p><p>He looked surprised, but then his eyes burned with heat, leaving her no doubt as to the satisfaction she\u2019d brought him.</p><p>\u201cI love you too, baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never told anyone that before,\u201d she blurted. \u201cI mean except Max and family.\u201d</p><p>He reached up to touch her hair, stroking his fingers through the strands. \u201cThen I\u2019m glad that Noah and I get to be the first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the first in a lot of ways,\u201d she admitted. \u201cYou\u2019re the first men I\u2019ve ever actually made love with. I haven\u2019t been with that many, but love certainly wasn\u2019t a factor in the sex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou understand that we intend to be the last,\u201d Liam said with a low growl. \u201cThis isn\u2019t something we take lightly. As far as I\u2019m concerned, this is forever.\u201d</p><p>She smiled ruefully at the irony. \u201cJoel used to say that he and I were forever, and God, I hated that word. He would tell me that I\u2019d never get away from him. But when you say it, it sounds . . . wonderful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNoah and I will always put you first, baby. Your wants, your needs, whatever it is that makes you happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI used to believe that the Colters and my brother were the only good men, and that they were some kind of aberration. I was so jealous of Holly and Lily that I ached with it. I never thought I would find someone to love me like their husbands love them.\u201d</p><p>She turned her smile up to Liam, allowing her love to openly shine.</p><p>\u201cI was wrong. You and Noah are my white knights.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t go that damn far,\u201d Liam grumbled. \u201cWe\u2019re pretty tarnished knights. We aren\u2019t perfect, Lauren, and I don\u2019t want you going into this thinking we are. We\u2019ve made mistakes. We\u2019re rough around the edges. And we\u2019ll screw up. I guarantee we\u2019ll screw things up. Just promise me\u2014and us\u2014that you\u2019ll be patient and stick it out because I guarantee you, no one will ever love you more than me and Noah.\u201d</p><p>Her heart melted, and she wanted to reach over the seat and grab him into a huge hug.</p><p>\u201cWell, just in case you and Noah ever have any doubts, there is no one who will ever love you more than me,\u201d she said fiercely. \u201cDon\u2019t even think about browsing anywhere else.\u201d</p><p>Liam grinned and then leaned forward to kiss the tip of her nose. \u201cYou sound mighty possessive, Miss Wilder. I like it. You can be possessive of me anytime. I guarantee I won\u2019t mind a bit.\u201d</p><p>Noah slid into the car and handed Lauren and Liam each a keycard. \u201cAll set,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll drive around to the parking spot outside our room.\u201d</p><p>Liam dug in the bag on the seat next to him and pulled out a zip-up hoodie. He thrust it over the seat to Lauren.</p><p>\u201cPut this on, baby. Hood up. Cover up as much of you as possible. I\u2019d rather not broadcast the fact that you\u2019re staying here.\u201d</p><p>As Noah pulled into one of the back parking spaces, Lauren thrust her arms into the sweatshirt and pulled the hood securely over her head, making sure her hair was hidden from view.</p><p>\u201cGo on inside,\u201d Noah instructed. \u201cLiam and I will get the bags.\u201d</p><p>Lauren got out of the car and hurried to the door. She inserted her keycard and then pushed inside.</p><p>She took in a deep breath, gratified that it didn\u2019t smell smoky or musty. It smelled clean and the furnishings weren\u2019t threadbare.</p><p>She blushed when she took in the fact that there was only one bed. It was plenty big for the three of them, but it was obvious they had no intention of her sleeping away from them.</p><p>A few moments later, Liam and Noah came through the doorway, their arms full of her luggage and their own bags. They dropped them inside the door and then shut it behind them.</p><p>\u201cFirst order of business is what you\u2019d like to eat for dinner,\u201d Noah said as he pulled Lauren into his side.</p><p>He kissed her temple, brushing his lips over her skin.</p><p>\u201cDillon has offered to do delivery service for us from the pub. Anything he has on the menu, he\u2019s said he\u2019ll deliver personally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love a club sandwich,\u201d Lauren said.</p><p>\u201cI can handle that,\u201d Noah said with a smile. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go get changed and relax. Put on some comfy pajamas and I\u2019ll order our food. We can eat and talk when the food gets here.\u201d</p><p>That sounded perfect to her. She was ready to wilt after the emotional twists and turns of the day.</p><p>She hurried in the bathroom, wanting to get back to her guys. There was nothing she wanted more than to curl up against them and just . . . be.</p><p>They had a lot to plan. Her entire life was going to change. But they\u2019d sworn to stay with her every step of the way. If she\u2019d had any doubt about their love, she couldn\u2019t possibly doubt it or them now. They were making huge sacrifices and putting their own lives on hold. For her.</p><p>When she was dressed in pajamas and hastily ran a brush through her hair, she ventured out of the bathroom to see Liam sprawled in one of the chairs in the living section of the hotel suite. His cell phone was to his ear and he seemed relaxed. Noah was seated by the window, occasionally sticking his fingers behind the blinds to pull them out enough to see the parking lot.</p><p>When Liam saw her, he slipped his hand over the end of the phone and mouthed, my parents.</p><p>Lauren\u2019s eyes widened and she went to sit in the armchair directly across from Liam so she could listen in on the conversation.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s amazing,\u201d Liam said softly, his gaze riveted to Lauren as he spoke. \u201cYou\u2019ll both love her.\u201d</p><p>Lauren blushed and squirmed under his tight scrutiny. It was odd to hear herself being talked about in such glowing terms.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something else you should know, Mom and Dad,\u201d Liam said, his voice growing serious. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Even Noah turned from his perch by the window. When he saw Lauren, he got up and crossed the room. He extended his hand down to Lauren to pull her up, and then he sat and tugged her down into his lap.</p><p>\u201cNow comes the fun part,\u201d Noah murmured.</p><p>Lauren fought the smile. Yes, she was nervous about how Liam\u2019s parents were going to take the explanation of their relationship, but she wasn\u2019t so uptight that she couldn\u2019t appreciate the humor in such an unexpected and somewhat awkward conversation with his parents.</p><p>Liam looked nervous. He wiped his free hand down his jeans repeatedly.</p> <p>\u201cOur relationship is not exactly . . . traditional,\u201d Liam said, unease apparent in his voice.</p><p>Then he blanched, his eyes widening and he immediately began to sputter. \u201cMom, no, I\u2019m not gay and Lauren isn\u2019t a cover name for a man. Yes, I know you\u2019d understand and that you aren\u2019t judging me, but that\u2019s not what it is.\u201d</p><p>Lauren started giggling and Noah shook with laughter against her. Liam sighed and closed his eyes as he listened to what apparently was a long stream of conversation from his mother.</p><p>\u201cMom, I appreciate that you\u2019re so understanding, but will you listen to me please? I\u2019m not coming out of the closet here. I\u2019m trying to tell you that Noah and I both are involved with Lauren.\u201d</p><p>There was a long period of silence on Liam\u2019s end, and there must have been on his parents\u2019 end too because Liam said, \u201cMom? Dad? Are you still there?\u201d</p> <p>He gripped the phone a little tighter and then took a deep breath. \u201cIt\u2019s really not that complicated when you look at it. We met her because her brother hired us to protect her, and we both fell in love with her. It\u2019s really that simple. She makes us happy and we\u2019re going to do our damn best to make her happy.\u201d</p><p>He glanced toward Noah and Lauren. \u201cYes, Noah\u2019s here. He and Lauren both are. Uh okay, hang on a minute.\u201d</p><p>He held the phone toward Noah. \u201cMom wants to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh hell,\u201d Noah muttered.</p><p>Lauren got up so Noah could lean forward and get the phone from Liam, and Liam pulled Lauren back toward him so she could switch spots from Noah to him.</p><p>\u201cHi, Mom,\u201d Noah said.</p> <p>Even though Lauren knew he was nervous, he seemed to relax the moment he spoke to Liam\u2019s mother.</p><p>\u201cYour family really is Noah\u2019s family, aren\u2019t they?\u201d Lauren murmured to Liam.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Liam said quietly. \u201cNoah didn\u2019t have an easy childhood. He was a burden to his parents. He was an oops baby to extremely selfish, self-absorbed people who didn\u2019t have time for a child nor the desire for one. He spent more time at my house than he did at home. I can remember times when they\u2019d literally drop him off at my parents with a note saying they were going to be gone for two weeks. Sometimes longer. They\u2019d send one change of clothes in a plastic grocery sack. It pissed my parents off to no end, but they knew if they interfered they\u2019d likely never see Noah again, and by then they considered him their son as much as I was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat can\u2019t have been easy for Noah,\u201d Lauren said sadly. \u201cNo one wants to feel like they\u2019re unwanted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it was hard for him when he was younger, but by the time he hit his teen years he just seemed to accept it. He loved my parents and they loved him. One day he came to our house with everything he owned in a duffel bag. My dad went outside to talk to him and when they came back in, my dad simply announced that Noah would be moving in with us and would become a permanent member of our family. I never saw or heard from his parents after that day, and I don\u2019t know that he has either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow, just wow,\u201d Lauren said in shock. \u201cI can\u2019t fathom that kind of emotional disconnect between parents and their child. That couldn\u2019t have been easy for your parents to take in another child.\u201d</p><p>Liam shook his head. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t. My dad did shiftwork at the local paper mill, and my mom worked in the school cafeteria. They didn\u2019t make a lot of money and it was a struggle to make ends meet with just the three of us. We lived in a two-bedroom wood-frame house, and Noah and I had to share a bedroom. But they always seemed to manage. They had a lot of pride too. I\u2019ll never forget when Noah and I were seniors in high school, we came home one day. It was a Friday, Dad\u2019s off day from work, and he and Mom were pissed. Not upset. Just extremely angry.\u201d</p><p>Lauren\u2019s brow furrowed. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cApparently Noah\u2019s parents had a brief moment of guilt, but not a big enough one that they actually tried to see Noah or come to visit him. They sent my mom and dad a check to cover his expenses. My dad hit the roof. And you\u2019d have to understand. Not much makes my dad angry. He\u2019s a very laid-back, mild-mannered man. But that day, he was livid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can imagine,\u201d Lauren murmured.</p><p>\u201cHe gave the check to Noah and told him it was rightfully his to do what he wanted, but that he and my mom wouldn\u2019t accept a dime for doing what was right. My dad told Noah that he loved him like a son and he didn\u2019t take him in to get some check in the mail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid Noah take it?\u201d Lauren asked.</p><p>Liam shook his head. \u201cHe told my dad to tear it up and return it to sender. Then he told my mom and dad that they were his parents, and that they\u2019d given him something way more valuable than a check with a lot of zeroes. They\u2019d given him love and acceptance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a beautiful story,\u201d Lauren said with a sniff.</p><p>\u201cMy parents are pretty special folks,\u201d Liam said seriously.</p><p>\u201cAnd what did they say when you told them about us?\u201d</p><p>Liam smiled. \u201cThey were surprised, of course. And they wanted to talk to Noah. I\u2019m their son, but to them so is Noah, and they want to make sure he\u2019s happy with the arrangement and isn\u2019t settling.\u201d</p><p>Lauren glanced back toward Noah, who was smiling as he spoke into the phone.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll bring her to meet you as soon as it\u2019s possible. It may be a while before you hear from us again, and I don\u2019t want that to worry you. We have some things to take care of and it\u2019s very likely Lauren is going to have to testify in a criminal trial. Once we\u2019re sure that the threat to her has been eliminated, then we can lead a normal life together. You\u2019ll like her family. They remind me a lot of you and Dad.\u201d</p><p>He paused a moment and found Lauren\u2019s gaze, his eyes warming as he stroked over her features.</p><p>\u201cYes, they\u2019re fine with it. It\u2019s not exactly an unusual arrangement in her family. But we\u2019ll explain it all to you when we bring her to meet you. Promise.\u201d</p><p>Noah smiled again. \u201cLove you both. I\u2019ll give you back to Liam now.\u201d</p><p>He handed the phone back to Liam, and Liam put it to his ear.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll talk soon,\u201d Liam promised. \u201cLove you both.\u201d</p><p>Liam hugged Lauren to him a little tighter as he said his good-byes. Then he punched the Off button and set the phone down on the little end table set up between the two armchairs.</p><p>\u201cSo it went well?\u201d Lauren asked tentatively.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d both Noah and Liam said at the same time.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re very eager to meet you,\u201d Noah said. \u201cThey\u2019re pretty mystified over the kind of woman it would take to get mine and Liam\u2019s attention so fiercely. They\u2019ve despaired of us ever settling down and providing them grandchildren.\u201d</p><p>Lauren flushed but she was taken with the image of her round with child, like Lily, and the two men fussing endlessly over her. And of having a tiny baby and the expressions on Noah\u2019s and Liam\u2019s faces the first time they saw their child.</p><p>She wanted it so much that she ached. She wanted them. Wanted a life with them, full of love and companionship.</p><p>A knock on the door interrupted her fantasy.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019ll be Dillon with food,\u201d Noah said, as he rose from his chair. \u201cGet comfortable, honey, and we\u2019ll dig in.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 28</p><p>AFTER the three ate dinner, Lauren excused herself to go shower in the small bathroom. She\u2019d closed her eyes and stuck her head under the hot spray, when a warm body pressed to her naked back.</p><p>Noah.</p><p>She smiled, her eyes still closed. She didn\u2019t need to look to know which of the two it was. She loved that she could tell them apart merely by touch. Smell. The sensation each of them caused against her skin.</p><p>His mouth nuzzled up the side of her neck, inciting a full-body shiver even under the heat of the shower.</p><p>\u201cHope you don\u2019t mind me joining you,\u201d he said huskily. \u201cLiam and I thought you would enjoy a little pampering. I get to wash, and he gets to dry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmmm.\u201d</p><p>It came out as a soft moan, and she leaned further back into him, molding her wet body to his. His hands slid around her waist to her belly and then upward to cup her breasts. He thumbed her nipples until they were puckered ridges.</p><p>She gave a whispery sigh when his hands left her to pick up the shampoo bottle. After squeezing the liquid into his hand, he began to lather her hair, taking his time and working his fingers over every part of her head.</p><p>She was nearly in a coma from the bliss of the massage. Her shoulders relaxed and the coiled tension in her muscles fled under Noah\u2019s soothing touch.</p><p>\u201cFeel good?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yes,\u201d she breathed.</p><p>He kissed the spot just below her left ear. \u201cGood. Tonight is for you.\u201d</p><p>He turned her so he could rinse her hair, and when he\u2019d made sure all the soap was gone, he set about washing the rest of her body with slow, methodical strokes that had her crazy with desire.</p><p>She was so boneless by the time he reached up to turn the shower off, that she wasn\u2019t sure she\u2019d be awake for whatever came next.</p><p>When the shower curtain was swept aside, she saw that Liam waited, a large towel in his hands. He opened it to her as she stepped out of the tub and immediately enfolded her in the warm softness.</p><p>Noah dried himself off in the shower while Liam toweled Lauren completely dry. Afterward, he wrapped her in a thick robe and nudged her out of the bathroom toward the bed.</p><p>Collecting a brush from her suitcase, he followed her to the bed and directed her to sit between his spread legs. To her surprise and utter delight, he began to comb out her damp hair.</p><p>\u201cYou two are so spoiling me,\u201d she said with absolutely no real regret.</p><p>Liam paused a moment and then leaned forward to brush his mouth over her ear.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the plan. We have to do what we can to ensure you want to keep us around for the long run.\u201d</p><p>There was a teasing note to his voice but she responded in all seriousness.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll never grow tired of being with you.\u201d</p><p>It was a statement that sounded new. At the beginning of a relationship when emotions are high and optimism is in abundance. When no one thinks of the potential pitfalls in a relationship. And yet, she believed it with all her heart. How could she possibly ever grow weary of two men who put her above all else?</p><p>Noah came from the bathroom, just a towel wrapped low around his hips. He was the sexiest thing she\u2019d ever seen in just that towel. His chest glistened with moisture and the whorl of hair in the hollow of his chest curled damply against his skin.</p><p>All it would take was the slightest nudge to bring that towel down . . .</p><p>Noah paused, seemingly aware of her avid gaze. He cocked one eyebrow and stared back. \u201cYou want something?\u201d he drawled.</p><p>She licked her lips and Noah\u2019s eyes darkened until they smoldered.</p><p>\u201cI want you,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Noah slowly pulled at the towel until it slid down his muscular legs to hit the floor. She caught her breath and her pulse ratcheted up, hammering through her veins.</p><p>He was . . . beautiful.</p><p>All masculine. Muscled. Lean.</p><p>As Noah stalked closer to the bed, Liam pulled at the towel wrapped around Lauren until she too was nude.</p><p>\u201cLean back against me,\u201d Liam murmured next to her ear.</p><p>He pulled her back even as she leaned into him, her back molding to his chest. He angled them both so that they lay on the bed, her between his legs and her body nestled into his.</p><p>As Noah crawled onto the end of the bed and between her legs, Liam\u2019s hands wandered up and down her upper body, caressing, petting, cupping and molding her breasts in his palms.</p><p>On his knees, Noah lowered his head between her splayed thighs and she caught her breath and held it in anticipation of the first touch of his mouth.</p><p>Using his fingers to part the delicate folds of her pussy, Noah gently pressed his mouth to her clit.</p><p>The contact sent an electric current arcing up her body, nearly short-circuiting every nerve ending. Her legs shook spasmodically and her belly heaved as she tried to catch her breath.</p><p>Liam nuzzled her neck, his teeth grazing the sensitive skin. Marking her. Teasing. Sending shivers of delight to collide with the wave of electricity wrought by Noah\u2019s ministrations.</p><p>Her entire body was an out-of-control tidal wave that was on a collision course with a mountain.</p><p>Noah\u2019s tongue delved deep, licking and sliding inward, tasting her. She made insensible sounds, completely victim to the pleasure the two men gave her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Liam\u2019s hands were cupped over her breasts, his mouth on her skin. Noah\u2019s hands gripped her hips as he used his mouth and tongue to drive her beyond her limits.</p><p>Erotic images flashed in her mind, heightened by her burgeoning arousal. Things that she\u2019d never before imagined were now succinct in her mind. Both men, entering her at the same time. Stroking deep. Her securely positioned between them.</p><p>Her breathing sped up and her vision swayed drunkenly. She was high on passion. Drugged on their caresses. Intoxicated by their kisses.</p><p>Oh, but she wanted it, and she wasn\u2019t even sure how it could be done, but she wanted them both inside her. She wanted it as she\u2019d wanted nothing else.</p> <p>\u201cNoah, Liam!\u201d she cried.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here, baby. I\u2019m right here,\u201d Liam soothed.</p><p>\u201cWant you both so much,\u201d she gasped out.</p><p>Noah raised his head to seek out her gaze. \u201cTell us how you want us, honey. You know we\u2019ll do anything you need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth inside me,\u201d she said, taking the plunge. \u201cI want you both. Together.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d Liam asked hoarsely.</p><p>\u201cOh God yes. Please.\u201d</p><p>Liam lifted her off him and maneuvered from underneath her. Then he caught her face in his hands and stared earnestly into her eyes.</p><p>\u201cStop us if it\u2019s too much.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cPromise.\u201d</p><p>But she knew it wouldn\u2019t be too much. It would never be enough. She wanted them too badly. Need consumed her. They consumed her.</p> <p>Noah positioned himself on the bed so he was lying flat on his back with his legs over the edge, feet planted on the floor. Liam helped Lauren climb astride Noah, and after Noah rolled on a condom, Lauren lowered herself, taking him deeply inside her.</p><p>They both let out a low moan when she took his full length.</p><p>Then Noah reached for her, pulling her forward so she was angled in a way that Liam could penetrate her. She swallowed nervously, but she was riding so high on anticipation that it didn\u2019t even cross her mind to back out.</p><p>A moment later, Liam cupped her backside and boldly massaged and caressed the cheeks before spreading them. The movement drew her tighter around Noah\u2019s cock, and she closed her eyes, allowing the sensation to wash over her.</p><p>Butterflies danced and fluttered in her belly when Liam fit himself to her tight opening. He seemed enormous. No way for him to fit, especially with Noah already stretching her so tight.</p><p>Liam pushed forward, and she felt the slickness of the lubricated condom as she opened around him. He was thick and broad. He seemed to go on forever as he eased more of his length into her.</p><p>\u201cOkay?\u201d Liam rasped.</p><p>\u201cYesss. Please don\u2019t stop.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBaby, I have no intention of stopping. Give me one more thrust and I\u2019ll be all the way inside you.\u201d</p><p>His words incited her to greater arousal. The burn of his entry eased and a warm haze surrounded her, immersing her in a dreamlike fog. His pelvis met her ass and pressed even harder against her, flattening her cheeks against his body.</p><p>Oh God, they were both completely inside her.</p><p>She began to shake, tremors quaking over and through her body at supersonic speed. She was never going to be able to hold on. She was beginning to unravel and had no way to control her release.</p><p>Liam began to thrust. Withdrawing and then surging forward. Noah gripped her hips, and when Liam would ease back, Noah slid deep, filling her, until all she was cognizant of was being stretched and filled by two men. Owned. Possessed. Branded.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t . . . Oh God . . .\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t even collect her thoughts. Had no idea what she was saying or what she needed.</p><p>Hands glided up and down her waist, soothing and calming even as her body spasmed and contorted with the force of their thrusts.</p><p>Then Noah\u2019s hands left her hips and cupped her breasts, rolling the points between his fingers. He pinched lightly, just enough to exert delicious pressure. A tiny bite of pain that sent her spiraling into the abyss.</p><p>She yelled their names, reached for Noah, something to hold on to while Liam drove relentlessly into her from behind. Noah caught her against him, holding her tightly while Liam surrounded her.</p><p>Caught between both men. Loved. Cherished. Protected and pleasured. She sagged against Noah, eyes closed, her breaths coming in tiny puffs as the room swirled crazily around her.</p><p>He kissed the top of her head as Liam carefully withdrew from her body, leaving her still connected intimately with Noah.</p><p>A moment later, Liam returned with a warm washcloth and he gently soothed the tender, swollen flesh. When he was done, Noah carefully rolled, holding on to Lauren so she went with him. They landed on their sides, and Noah slid from her body.</p><p>He rolled away a quick moment to discard the condom, and then he was back, pulling her into his arms. Liam climbed onto the bed on her other side and pressed his body to her back, his legs twining with hers.</p><p>She let out a huge sigh of utter contentment. Had she ever been as happy or secure as she was right at this very moment? Snuggled between two strong men who\u2019d do anything to make her happy. If only she could stop time and savor this night forever.</p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>Liam\u2019s whisper against her ear was faint but unmistakable. She turned so that his lip met her cheek, and she closed her eyes, basking in those wonderful words.</p><p>Chapter 29</p><p>LAUREN lay sprawled over Noah\u2019s chest, her legs tangled with Liam\u2019s. Noah idly ran his hand up and down her back, gliding lower to cup her behind before smoothing back up her body again.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d Noah murmured.</p><p>\u201cIf I was any better, I don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do with myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDitto,\u201d Liam said in a sleepy, contented growl.</p><p>\u201cIt was new for us too, Lauren,\u201d Noah said softly. \u201cI\u2019ve never done anything like that before, and I\u2019m a little surprised that it came so naturally. And that it was so powerful. I\u2019m at a loss as to how to even describe it. I\u2019ve never experienced anything like it.\u201d</p><p>Lauren pushed herself upward so she could see Noah\u2019s eyes. They were utterly serious, warm and glowing with so much else he\u2019d left unsaid. Like her, he hadn\u2019t said the words yet, but she didn\u2019t doubt for a moment that he loved her every bit as much as Liam did.</p><p>The words would come in time, when they weren\u2019t forced. When they were as natural as breathing and completely sincere. She looked forward to that day when they could be so comfortable with each other. When there was no threat from Joel or any other quarter.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2014I\u2014didn\u2019t hurt you, did we?\u201d Liam asked gruffly.</p><p>She went soft at the concern in his voice and pushed herself upward more so that she was sitting cross-legged between them. She leaned over to kiss his firm mouth and let her lips linger over his, enjoying the simple act of affection between two lovers.</p><p>\u201cYou both were wonderful,\u201d she said huskily. \u201cPerfect. I never imagined something so . . . powerful.\u201d</p><p>He touched her cheek, stroking his fingers down her jaw as he kissed her again.</p><p>\u201cHow much time do we have?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Already the curtains were illuminated with the pale shade of dawn, and though they were going to a place where Lauren felt completely at home, she also knew that it would bring to a temporary end the intimacy between her and Liam and Noah. She felt its loss already and they hadn\u2019t even left the warmth of their bed yet.</p><p>Noah slid his hand up her back, letting it rest at the small, just above the curve of her buttocks.</p><p>\u201cWe have time yet. A few hours more.\u201d</p><p>Liam pulled one of the pillows up to prop behind her back and the headboard so she\u2019d be more comfortable while the two men continued to rest on their sides.</p><p>Lauren wanted the quiet, comfortable time between them to discuss the future. It was all still so new and exciting in her mind that she could speak of little else for the next weeks.</p><p>\u201cCan I ask you two something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything,\u201d Liam said firmly.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Noah said at the same time.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you see in our future?\u201d she asked. \u201cDo you see us together long term?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a crystal ball,\u201d Noah said in a serious tone. \u201cI can\u2019t predict what will happen a year or five years down the road. But if you ask me what I want? I want forever. With you. And I\u2019m going to do everything in my power to see that forever is what we share.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see you with us for as long as either of us is breathing,\u201d Liam said, his lips set into a determined line.</p><p>\u201cAnd children?\u201d she asked hesitantly. \u201cWhat are your thoughts on children and a family?\u201d</p><p>Both men were angled so they could see her face and she could see theirs. Light warmed Noah\u2019s eyes. He looked . . . hopeful. And happy.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love a family one day,\u201d Noah said.</p><p>She could hear the yearning in his tone.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d want everything that I was denied as a child. And I\u2019d never do to our children what my parents did to me,\u201d he said fiercely.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d make a great father,\u201d she said in just as fierce a tone.</p><p>Liam smiled, warmth traveling to the very depths of his blue eyes. \u201cI could see a few rug rats.\u201d</p><p>Her breath caught in her throat as she was struck by a longing so powerful that she simply couldn\u2019t breathe.</p><p>\u201cDo you want children, Lauren?\u201d Noah asked.</p><p>\u201cOh yes,\u201d she breathed. \u201cMy own family. It\u2019s all I\u2019ve ever wanted.\u201d</p><p>She touched both men, letting her hands creep over their arms so she had contact with them both.</p><p>\u201cHow would we do it?\u201d she asked hesitantly. \u201cI mean if we were trying to have a baby\u2014down the road of course\u2014would it matter to you if we didn\u2019t know which of you fathered the child? Or would you want to make sure you each had a son or a daughter?\u201d</p><p>Anxiety had crept into her voice and she glanced between them nervously.</p><p>\u201cI can only speak for me,\u201d Liam began in a low tone. \u201cBut for this kind of relationship to work, we\u2019d both have to accept and love any child we bring into the world. Whether it\u2019s my biological child or Noah\u2019s. Honestly I wouldn\u2019t care, because either way I\u2019d consider that baby mine. I\u2019d never treat a child differently because it was Noah\u2019s biological child and not mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmen,\u201d Noah said. \u201cI completely agree. If you\u2019re asking if we want to ensure that a child you bear is ours biologically, then no. I say when the time comes, we both try as hard as possible to knock you up and let the seed fall where it may.\u201d</p><p>Liam chuckled. \u201cYou certainly have a way with words. But I agree completely. Not knowing allows us both to believe that the child is ours. And it will be ours no matter who fathers it. You\u2019re their mother and for me that\u2019s enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did the Colters do, do you know?\u201d Noah asked curiously. \u201cHolly had four children.\u201d</p><p>Lauren laughed. \u201cIt\u2019s a running joke in the family that no one knows where Dillon came from. Holly swears he was switched at birth. But no. She doesn\u2019t know\u2014or care\u2014who the biological fathers were for her children. Neither do any of her kids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think that\u2019s the best way,\u201d Liam said softly.</p><p>\u201cDo you know how overwhelming it is for me to be sitting here between you two contemplating a normal life, a normal relationship and things like family and children?\u201d Lauren asked, her voice choked with emotion.</p><p>Noah grinned. \u201cWell, I\u2019m not sure you could consider our relationship normal, but I get what you\u2019re saying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care what anyone else thinks,\u201d Lauren said in a determined voice. \u201cAll I care about is what you two think and what you want and that I\u2019m able to make you happy.\u201d</p><p>Liam reached up to pull her down into a kiss. \u201cYou make me very happy, baby. Never doubt that for a minute.\u201d</p><p>She melted into him, kissing him back with the same fervor. Against her back, Noah\u2019s lips pressed into her flesh as he kissed a trail down her spine.</p><p>\u201cDo we have time before we go out to the Colters\u2019?\u201d she asked in a husky voice.</p><p>Liam\u2019s eyes gleamed with purpose just as Noah\u2019s hands slid to her hips. \u201cWe\u2019ll make time.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 30</p><p>LIAM and Noah packed the back of the SUV with their bags and then went back to the hotel room to get Lauren. Both men were wearing shoulder harnesses with pistols holstered and light leather jackets to cover both holster and gun.</p><p>\u201cYou ready?\u201d Noah asked in a low voice.</p><p>She took a deep breath and nodded. Though they were just going up to the Colters\u2019\u2014a place she felt very much at home\u2014the knowledge that in just two days she\u2019d leave that shelter and make a trip into the unknown was playing havoc with her nerves.</p><p>Liam offered her a quick hug and a kiss, and then ushered her out the door and to the SUV. He put her in the front seat and then climbed in behind her while Noah walked around to the driver\u2019s side.</p><p>As they pulled out of the hotel parking lot, she glanced down Main Street with the quaint shops, the bustling diner, her old apartment and the Mountain Pass Bar and Grill that Dillon Colter owned. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It was hard to leave behind everything that was familiar and achingly comforting. Thank goodness for Liam and Noah. How could she possibly face doing this alone? But then if it weren\u2019t for Noah and Liam, she wouldn\u2019t have the knowledge she now possessed, nor would she have had the courage to stand up and face the devil.</p><p>They turned out of town and she stared out the window, absorbing the beauty of the mountains. The Colters didn\u2019t live very far, distance wise, but it was a drive up the mountain that had several switchbacks, and the going was slow.</p><p>But it was a drive she didn\u2019t mind, because it had views that were breathtaking. Views she couldn\u2019t see anywhere else in the world.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got company,\u201d Noah said tersely.</p> <p>Liam immediately swiveled to stare out the back. Lauren\u2019s heart did a flip in her chest and she yanked her gaze to the side-view mirror to see a truck bearing down on them.</p><p>\u201cMoving too fast just to be another person on the same road,\u201d Liam said grimly. \u201cLauren, does anyone else live on this road?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, her horrified gaze still glued to the mirror. \u201cOnly the Colters and Max and Callie. The doctor in town makes house calls and sometimes they have groceries delivered, but mostly they go into town for what they need because they don\u2019t like their privacy intruded on.\u201d</p><p>Just then the truck rammed them and Lauren was thrown forward, her seat belt cinching tight around her to prevent her from crashing into the dash.</p><p>\u201cSon of a bitch!\u201d Noah cursed.</p> <p>He hit the accelerator, lurching forward, but the road turned into gravel less than a quarter mile ahead, and there was no way to have a race up the mountain without killing themselves in the process.</p><p>\u201cHold on,\u201d Noah ordered grimly as he sped up.</p><p>They hit the dirt road, fishtailed slightly before Noah corrected and hit the first switchback going as fast as he dared.</p><p>As soon as they rounded the bend, putting a little distance between them and the car pursuing them, Noah barked back to Liam, \u201cGet on Lauren\u2019s phone and call the Colters. Tell them we\u2019re coming in hot. We have no choice but to go up because we sure as hell can\u2019t get back down.\u201d</p><p>Lauren hastily fumbled with her phone, shoving it over the seat toward Liam.</p><p>They got to the second switchback, and Noah spun out as he rounded the sharp curve. Liam was punching the button to connect the call to the Colters, when Noah swore a blistering streak that singed Lauren\u2019s ears.</p> <p>When she stared ahead and realized what Noah was reacting to, cold fear paralyzed her.</p><p>\u201cNoah, look out!\u201d Liam yelled, dropping Lauren\u2019s phone.</p><p>Hurtling down the mountain road on a direct collision with them was a Hummer with a reinforced steel grille.</p><p>Lauren recognized the direness of the situation. She knew they were going to be pulverized between the two vehicles. Neither had any intention of avoiding the inevitable collision.</p><p>\u201cHold on,\u201d Noah said tightly. \u201cThere\u2019s only one way to avoid this, and I have to hope to hell we survive it.\u201d</p><p>When she realized his intention, her pulse exploded in her veins. She squeezed her eyes shut just as he turned the SUV and dove right over the edge of the mountain.</p><p>For less than a second, but what seemed like an eternity, they were airborne, and then they landed with a jolt that shook Lauren to her bones. She heard shattering glass, the crunch and groan of metal giving way.</p><p>And then they were rolling. Over and over until the world was a crazy Tilt-A-Whirl flashing before her eyes. They bounced and slid and then rolled some more, until finally the SUV landed hard on its wheels and the front smashed into a huge pine.</p> <p>It was instinctive to throw her arms in front of her face to shield her from the air bag, but it never deployed. Glass sprayed her, and she screamed when a branch shot through the windshield and drove itself into the seat a mere inch from where her shoulder rested.</p><p>Oh God, just a few inches over and it would have impaled her.</p><p>She took mental stock, trying to determine if she had any injuries. But she felt no pain. She couldn\u2019t feel anything. She was numb from head to toe. For all she knew she\u2019d broken every bone in her body, but she had no way of knowing.</p><p>She looked down and then over at Noah. Her cry of horror was muffled by her hand as it flew to cover her mouth. The dash had caved in, pinning him in his seat.</p><p>Liam. She had to see about Liam. Her hands fumbled with her seat belt, but it wouldn\u2019t come lose. She yanked and pulled, nearly screaming with frustration. Finally it came free and she awkwardly tried to maneuver in the much smaller space.</p><p>She managed to hoist herself high enough to see that Liam was sprawled in his seat, his head resting against a shattered window. Blood streamed down his cheek and he wasn\u2019t conscious.</p><p>Then she heard a sound from Noah.</p><p>Her gaze flew to him and she pulled herself above the limb that was embedded in her seat.</p><p>\u201cNoah? Noah? Can you hear me? Please talk to me. Oh God, I\u2019m so scared. Liam\u2019s unconscious. I don\u2019t know how badly he\u2019s hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen to me,\u201d Noah said hoarsely. \u201cCan you reach Liam\u2019s gun?\u201d</p><p>She froze, staring at Noah in confusion.</p><p>\u201cGet the gun, Lauren. We only have a few minutes before they arrive. They\u2019ll drive back down the mountain and they\u2019ll come looking for us. They\u2019ll kill us. Do you understand? They\u2019re after you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you move?\u201d Lauren asked anxiously. \u201cCan you get out on your side? We could take Liam with us. We have the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen to me, honey,\u201d Noah said, his voice calm, a direct contradiction to the screams echoing inside Lauren\u2019s head. \u201cI can\u2019t move. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m badly injured, but I can\u2019t tell. I\u2019m probably in shock and can\u2019t feel pain. But my legs are trapped. There\u2019s no way I can get out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey want me,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said bluntly.</p><p>The haze lifted and suddenly she was sharply focused on the matter at hand. These assholes were after her, and if they found her with Noah and Liam, they\u2019d kill them. But if they thought Noah and Liam were already dead and she was nowhere in the vicinity . . .</p><p>They\u2019d come looking for her and not waste the time on Noah and Liam.</p><p>She hauled herself over the seat and fumbled with Liam\u2019s jacket. She grasped the stock of the gun and yanked it out of the holster.</p><p>\u201cGood girl,\u201d Noah praised. \u201cNow listen to me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you listen to me,\u201d she said fiercely. \u201cI\u2019ve got a lot to say and not much time. I love you. I love you and Liam so damn much and I\u2019m not giving either of you up without a fight. I\u2019m sorry I haven\u2019t told you before now. It just never seemed like the right time. Not saying now is either, but I\u2019m not going to die without you knowing how much I love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you too, honey,\u201d Noah said. \u201cNow please, listen to me.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cThis is what\u2019s going to happen, Noah, and I swear to God if you argue with me or if you don\u2019t do exactly as I say and you end up dead, I\u2019ll kill you all over again.\u201d</p><p>His eyes widened in surprise.</p><p>\u201cCan you reach your gun?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>\u201cOkay take it out and keep it hidden. Don\u2019t use it unless you absolutely have to. I\u2019m taking Liam\u2019s gun and I\u2019m taking off. These assholes want me. If you pretend to be dead and Liam is unconscious and seems dead and I\u2019m not here, they\u2019re not going to waste a lot of time with either of you because neither of you are any good to them. It\u2019s me they want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa, what the fuck? No fucking way, Lauren.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s not a damn thing you can do to stop me,\u201d she said calmly. \u201cIt\u2019s a good plan and you know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the dumbest plan I\u2019ve ever heard!\u201d he roared. \u201cI love you, goddamn it. I\u2019m not letting you take off on your own with no protection.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I love you!\u201d she roared back. \u201cI love both of you, which is why I\u2019m going to protect both of you by getting the hell out of here. Liam still has my phone. You can call for help once the dickheads figure out I\u2019m gone and go after me. I\u2019m going to try to make it to the Colters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoddamn it, Lauren, please don\u2019t do this.\u201d</p><p>Noah was begging her, his eyes glossy with unshed tears. There was stark terror reflected in those shiny pools. Terror for her.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d she whispered. \u201cIf I stay here, they\u2019ll kill us all. We\u2019ll be sitting ducks. You\u2019re pinned, Liam\u2019s unconscious, and there\u2019s just me with Liam\u2019s gun. I have to give us a fighting chance, Noah. If we make it out of this alive, you can yell at me all you want.\u201d</p><p>Before he could argue further, she turned to try to open her door. She could barely budge it, and the metal creaked and groaned as she attempted to push it far enough open to get out.</p><p>\u201cUse the butt of the gun and break out the glass,\u201d Noah said. \u201cAnd hurry. You don\u2019t have much time. I want you as far away from those bastards as possible when they get here.\u201d</p><p>Bolstered by his grudging support, she broke out the glass with Liam\u2019s pistol and pulled away enough of the shards that she could get through without cutting herself.</p><p>Still holding tight to the gun, she hoisted herself out of the window and prayed that she didn\u2019t have injuries that would prevent her from running like hell.</p><p>When her feet hit the ground, she very nearly went down in a heap. Her knees shook horribly and reaction was setting in. Her hands shook. Her entire body quivered.</p><p>She had to get it together. Not only for herself but for Liam and Noah too. She needed to put as much distance between her and them for their safety. If her pursuers thought she was escaping, they would lose all interest in Noah and Liam and come after her.</p><p>She turned and ran.</p><p>Chapter 31</p><p>NOAH held his breath when he heard the sound of a vehicle nearby. Liam hadn\u2019t stirred, which concerned Noah. But what scared the hell out of him the most was the fact that Lauren hadn\u2019t gotten that big of a head start.</p><p>She was alone on the mountain with only Liam\u2019s gun for protection, and Noah was trapped in the goddamn car, unable to move his legs.</p><p>Sitting duck was right. Lauren had certainly been accurate on that count. He and Liam were completely defenseless and as much as he hated to admit it, Lauren\u2019s plan was a sound one for drawing attention away from him and Liam. But Noah couldn\u2019t live with the results if her life were to be sacrificed for his.</p><p>The engine stopped, and then Noah heard voices as they drew closer. He leaned against the door and slid the hand holding the gun between the seat and the door so it was out of sight. He closed his eyes to narrow slits so it would appear he was unconscious. He tried to make his breathing as shallow as possible and to calm the fear and adrenaline churning like a tornado inside him.</p><p>\u201cHere it is!\u201d</p><p>The shout went up, and Noah heard at least two responses, which meant there were at least three men. His heart sank. Three men who\u2019d shortly turn their attention on hunting Lauren down. He had no idea what their orders were. Shoot her on sight? Take her into custody? Who knew what Joel Knight wanted? He was a twisted son of a bitch who got off on having absolute control over a woman.</p><p>It took every ounce of discipline he had not to betray himself. He wanted a shot at the sons of bitches. If he could take them out here and now, they wouldn\u2019t pose a threat to Lauren.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you see?\u201d one of the men asked.</p><p>They were still a short distance away and they were obviously being careful to avoid an ambush. Too bad they had to be smart.</p><p>\u201cThe woman\u2019s not with them. Looks like they\u2019re dead or nearly so. One of them\u2019s pinned in the driver\u2019s seat. Doesn\u2019t look good. The other cracked his head open on the window in the backseat and he\u2019s either dead or unconscious. The passenger window has been busted out. Looks like she took off.\u201d</p><p>There was a round of swearing, and then the next words sent a chill snaking down Noah\u2019s spine.</p><p>\u201cCome on, you two. How hard can this be? We\u2019re talking one defenseless woman running around the mountain like a chicken with her head cut off. This\u2019ll be the easiest job we\u2019ve ever had. Spread out and let\u2019s go find her. The sooner we find her and dump her on Knight, the quicker we get paid.\u201d</p><p>Noah heard Liam stir in the backseat. The fact that his friend was alive sent a surge of relief through him that weakened him momentarily. The problem was, the last thing he needed was Liam coming around right now and making a scene that would get them both killed.</p><p>\u201cLiam, if you can hear me, stay completely still and keep your eyes closed,\u201d Noah said in a low voice. \u201cI\u2019ll let you know when it\u2019s okay to move.\u201d</p><p>The sound immediately quieted and Noah knew Liam had heard and understood.</p><p>Another good sign.</p><p>The sound of the vehicle starting made Noah open his eyes to mere slits, and he surveyed the area around the crash site. In the distance, two men were disappearing into the trees in opposite directions, while the other had apparently taken the vehicle to move it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLiam, can you get to Lauren\u2019s phone?\u201d Noah asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is going on?\u201d Liam asked in a foggy voice laced with confusion and pain.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have time to explain right this moment. If you can move and reach Lauren\u2019s phone, I need you to hand it up to me. Lauren\u2019s life\u2014and ours\u2014depends on it.\u201d</p><p>Liam let out a low groan and then a moment later, Liam leaned forward to hand Noah the phone.</p> <p>\u201cWhere the hell is Lauren?\u201d Liam demanded.</p><p>\u201cGive me a minute, okay?\u201d</p><p>He pulled up the address book on the phone and his first call went to the older Colter men. They were closest, and he needed people out to help Lauren and for someone to get out to free him from this damn vehicle.</p><p>His second call would be to Seth to pull out all the stops and have every available man on this mountain to hunt these bastards down and make sure they didn\u2019t get their hands on Lauren.</p><p>Chapter 32</p> <p>LAUREN stopped and bent over, holding her side and gasping for breath. Each expulsion of breath was painful and she didn\u2019t know if it was because of her desperate flight through the woods or if it was the result of the crash.</p><p>Her head hurt. Her side hurt. Every muscle in her body ached.</p><p>A sound to her right had her jerking around, pistol up. A squirrel scurried up a tree and the gun wobbled precariously in her grasp.</p><p>She was losing her mind and she was rapidly losing any strength she had remaining. The brief adrenaline burst she\u2019d experienced directly after the crash had long since fled, and she was barely existing on fumes.</p><p>She had no idea if she was heading in the right direction or not. The crash had completely rattled her and she hadn\u2019t logically thought about direction when she\u2019d fled the crumpled SUV.</p><p>What bolstered her spirits was that she hadn\u2019t heard any shots fired. She hoped that her supposition would be correct in that they would come after her and not bother with Liam and Noah. She just prayed that neither were seriously injured in the crash.</p> <p>After catching her breath, she took off in a jog again, determined to keep on the move and her attackers at a distance. After one particularly steep climb up a rocky incline, she realized that she was back on the road.</p><p>Jubilation filled her and she set off in a dead sprint. When she heard an approaching vehicle, she turned, relief making her weak-kneed. Her relief turned to paralyzing fear when she recognized the Hummer that had forced them off the road. The Hummer skidded to a stop, kicking up a cloud of dust. The driver was out and rushing toward her before it had fully stopped.</p><p>It was time for payback. She raised the hand holding the pistol and took aim. It was a peculiar moment of disconnect for her. The person wasn\u2019t real. The situation wasn\u2019t real. The gun wasn\u2019t real and neither were the bullets.</p><p>It took her back to some of the dreams she had when she was being pursued and she would point the gun and it either wouldn\u2019t fire, or it would be out of bullets. She\u2019d awakened, frightened and frustrated by her inability to shoot her attacker.</p><p>It would indeed be over her dead body if she wasn\u2019t able to pull the trigger this time.</p><p>And evidently, the man charging her didn\u2019t think she had the balls to do it either because he never let up. She waited until he was only six feet away, and then she calmly pulled the trigger.</p><p>The explosion was deafening. The gun jerked in her hand, the recoil so much that she feared she\u2019d missed her target all together.</p><p>But then she saw the bloom of red on his chest. The faint shock that registered on his face. He staggered, barely keeping himself up right.</p> <p>She shot him again, this time right through the forehead.</p><p>He went down like a rock.</p><p>Before she could register any relief or satisfaction, pain exploded in her head and she went sprawling to the ground. The gun flew from her hand and through the foggy haze of her semiconscious state, she heard the rapid exclamations from other men.</p><p>\u201cHoly shit, the bitch shot Mark! We should kill her and be done with it,\u201d he said, his voice full of shock and rage.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be stupid,\u201d the other man said, in a voice that suggested he thought his accomplice was just that. \u201cIt\u2019s one less person to share the bounty we\u2019re being paid to bring the bitch in to Knight. We split two ways now instead of three and the boss is happy. Now let\u2019s get the hell out of here before the cops start showing up.\u201d</p><p>Her stomach twisted into a vicious knot. She\u2019d been so focused on the threat in front of her that she hadn\u2019t heard the two men behind her.</p><p>Realization of her circumstances sent terror through her veins.</p><p>Joel Knight wanted her back.</p><p>He\u2019d hired these men to do whatever was necessary to bring her to Joel.</p><p>They hadn\u2019t blinked an eye over their fallen accomplice. It was a financial transaction for them and nothing else.</p><p>She was so fucked if they got her off this mountain and back in Joel\u2019s world where he made the rules and nothing could touch him.</p><p>But at the same time, they hadn\u2019t been ordered to kill her. Joel wanted her back. Alive. At least for the short term. Could he not know of what she\u2019d done? Was this all about the blow to his ego because she\u2019d dared to walk out on him?</p><p>If he didn\u2019t know that she\u2019d stolen incriminating evidence from his computer or that she\u2019d spoken to the district attorney, she might manage to stay alive long enough for Liam and Noah to find her.</p><p>Most important she\u2019d led these bastards away from Noah and Liam. She clung tenaciously to that thought. They were alive. They would come for her.</p><p>She was barely clinging to consciousness when the two men yanked her to her feet and dragged her toward the truck driven by the man she\u2019d shot.</p><p>They merely left him on the road, lying in a pool of his own blood.</p><p>At least Noah and Liam and the Colters would find the body, and they would know what had happened to her.</p><p>It was her only hope.</p><p>They took a roll of duct tape and roughly wound tape around her head and over her mouth. Then one taped her hands together, winding the tape around and around her wrists. Once that was accomplished, they tossed her into the back of the Hummer and grabbed her ankles, bruising her skin with the force of their grip.</p><p>After securing her legs with the same tape, they tossed the roll over their shoulder and slammed the back door shut. Without sparing another glance in her direction, they got into the cab of the Hummer.</p><p>The driver began the awkward task of turning around on the narrow road and several times sent rocks tumbling over the edge of the sharp incline.</p><p>After a moment, he had them turned in the way they\u2019d come, and he floored the accelerator. She bumped painfully all over the backseat, the seat belt buckles digging into her skin and hitting her ribs.</p><p>They were bringing her to Joel and what he planned for her she had no idea. She could no longer deny the sort of man he was. The blinders had been off for a very long time now.</p><p>She knew what he was capable of. She knew what he\u2019d already done to numerous women.</p><p>What was one more woman\u2019s blood on his hands?</p><p>Chapter 33</p><p>WHEN Noah heard a shout in the distance, he breathed a huge sigh of relief. Liam had left, taking Noah\u2019s gun with him, as soon as he\u2019d learned that Lauren had struck out on her own.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t wanted to let Liam go. Liam was obviously injured and fighting his hold on consciousness. He was bleeding steadily from his head wound.</p><p>But what choice had either of them had? How could Noah hold him back when Liam was all the help Lauren could expect so soon?</p><p>Liam had been terrified the moment Noah had told him what she\u2019d done. And it was obvious that he was torn between leaving Noah in such a horrible situation and going after Lauren.</p><p>Noah had quietly pointed out that there was nothing Liam could do for him. Noah was stuck until help arrived. But Liam could go in search of Lauren and hopefully reach her in time.</p><p>Noah had never felt so helpless in his life than he did now, pinned in the SUV while Lauren was out there fighting for her life and Liam was somewhere in between.</p><p>Relief made him temporarily weak, and it took a second for him to muster the strength to shout back upon hearing Adam Colter\u2019s call. A moment later, the older Colter brothers appeared at the vehicle, their expressions worried and grim as they took in the wreckage.</p><p>\u201cAre you hurt, son?\u201d Adam asked. \u201cWhere are Lauren and Liam?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, sir, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m injured that badly. Just can\u2019t move my legs but I can feel them.\u201d</p><p>Then he quickly related the events that occurred right after the wreck, and Liam\u2019s departure to go after Lauren.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call Seth and give him the update,\u201d Ryan said grimly.</p><p>\u201cI did,\u201d Noah said. \u201cHe was on his way out. I told him to get everyone in the damn town out if that\u2019s what it takes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay then. We just need to concentrate on getting you out of there,\u201d Ethan said. \u201cI have some tools in the truck. I\u2019m calling for a wrecker just in case we can\u2019t get you out of this. I know you don\u2019t want to be stuck here when Lauren is out there and her fate has yet to be determined. We\u2019ll do our best, son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Noah said, his fingers flexing and then curling in agitation. It was killing him to have to sit there, unable to move, while others searched for Lauren.</p><p>Ethan and Ryan turned and ran in the direction of their vehicle while Adam stayed with Noah. Adam put his hand on Noah\u2019s shoulder and squeezed.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to panic. I know you\u2019re worried. I won\u2019t tell you not to worry because in your shoes, I\u2019d be pissing my pants and freaking out. But I want you to know that not one of us will rest until we get Lauren back.\u201d</p><p>Noah nodded, not trusting himself to speak. The more time that passed, the sicker at heart he became. Liam hadn\u2019t returned and neither had Lauren.</p><p>He yanked his head back up to stare at Adam. \u201cLauren said she was going to try to make it to your place. Did you leave Holly there alone? They could both be in trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI called Max and Callie to go stay with Holly. He was fit to be tied but we told him we didn\u2019t have any details and that we needed him there. I can understand his anger. Lauren is his sister and by rights he should be right here with us, but he doesn\u2019t know this mountain like we do and the last thing we need is for someone to get lost while our focus is on Lauren.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did the right thing,\u201d Noah said. \u201cWe need level heads right now.\u201d</p><p>Even as he spoke, his fingers formed tight fists and he pounded the caved-in dashboard in frustration.</p><p>\u201cSeth and the others are nearly here,\u201d Ryan said when he returned. \u201cThey\u2019ve set up a roadblock at the bottom of the road, and they\u2019re coming up the mountain balls to the wall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you get me out?\u201d Noah demanded.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re sure as hell going to try,\u201d Ethan said as he held up a crowbar.</p><p>Ryan held a sledgehammer and an axe.</p><p>\u201cStand back, Adam,\u201d Ethan said. \u201cCover your head as best you can, Noah.\u201d</p><p>The entire vehicle shook as the two men tore into the door and the frame. Several times, the pressure on his legs made him wince, but he was just grateful to be able to feel anything at all. He was damn lucky he hadn\u2019t crushed both legs.</p><p>Using the crowbar to pry the dashboard up off Noah\u2019s legs, Ryan strained, muscles bulging.</p><p>\u201cAs soon as I loosen this enough, pull him out,\u201d Ryan said through gritted teeth.</p><p>Ethan and Adam scrambled to get into place. As Ryan pulled back away from Noah, Adam and Ethan grabbed for his shoulders and they hauled upward.</p><p>Noah bit back a bellow of pain when he came free.</p><p>The Colters lowered him to the ground when in the distance they heard, \u201cDad! Dad! Damn it, where are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOver here!\u201d Adam yelled.</p><p>Then he knelt back down by Noah.</p><p>\u201cOkay, talk to me, son. You hurt anywhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHelp me up,\u201d Noah said, extending his hands to Adam and Ryan. \u201cThere\u2019s only one way to find out.\u201d</p><p>They grasped his hands and hauled him to his feet. For a moment, the two men pressed close to Noah\u2019s side, offering him support until they were certain he could stand on his own.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d Noah said. \u201cNothing feels broken. Just bruised and cut.\u201d</p><p>Ethan nodded. \u201cYeah, you\u2019re bleeding in half a dozen different places.\u201d</p><p>All four men looked up when Seth barged onto the scene, two of his deputies on his heels.</p><p>\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you looking for Lauren?\u201d Noah demanded.</p><p>Seth gave him a look that sent a shock of fear hurtling down his spine. \u201cWe came to get you. Liam tracked Lauren\u2019s route back to the road where he found one of the men dead. Two gunshot wounds. Looks like Lauren shot one of the assholes and then got hit from behind. There was a depressed area of grass with a small amount of blood. A good distance from the other body, so it wasn\u2019t his. We also found a roll of duct tape with several hairs that match Lauren\u2019s. Half the roll had been used. There are fresh tire tracks that aren\u2019t a match to one of ours leading away. If I had to guess, judging by the pattern and the disturbance to the area off the road, the truck was coming up the mountain when Lauren came into view. I think the guy she shot was driving. The other two were tracking her on foot and came in behind her while she was distracted by the first guy. They knocked her down, subdued her and then tossed her in the truck, turned around and hauled ass off the mountain, getting away before we arrived with the roadblock.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Noah went numb. His mouth went dry. His pulse pounded painfully in his head.</p><p>He\u2019d failed her. He and Liam both had failed her in a huge way.</p><p>They\u2019d planned in detail. They\u2019d taken into account so much. They\u2019d made a plan of action. None of it did a damn bit of good, because those bastards had gotten to Lauren faster than Noah could have ever imagined.</p><p>How?</p> <p>He put a hand to the back of his neck and rubbed, trying to alleviate the knotted tension coiled in his muscles.</p><p>\u201cHow in the hell could they have put this kind of plan into motion that damn fast?\u201d Noah demanded. \u201cWe only called the D.A. yesterday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you make it on your own or do we need to carry you out?\u201d Seth asked. \u201cWe can talk on our way back up. Liam is with my brothers and volunteers and first responders. They were combing the area where the body was found to make sure we weren\u2019t missing anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can make it,\u201d Noah said in a determined voice.</p><p>He took a step forward, falling into stride with Seth as Seth\u2019s fathers followed behind. Seth\u2019s deputies went ahead of the men, one of them talking into the radio.</p> <p>\u201cHow did they manage this, Seth?\u201d Noah asked again.</p><p>\u201cI think Joel Knight had already made her,\u201d Seth said grimly. \u201cHe may not even know about the meeting with the D.A. If he\u2019s had people looking for her all these months, it\u2019s possible they were finally able to locate her and were just waiting for an opportunity to make their move.\u201d</p><p>Noah swore long and hard. \u201cAnd the very thing we thought we were doing right\u2014taking her to a more isolated area\u2014proved to be their golden opportunity. They couldn\u2019t make this kind of attack in town, even one as small as Clyde. But on a lonely mountain road that\u2019s only traveled by the people who live on the mountain? Son of a bitch. We may as well have just gift wrapped her and delivered her to the bastard, complete with a bow.\u201d</p><p>Seth put a hand to Noah\u2019s shoulder as they completed the climb back to the road, where a string of police cars and SUVs were parked.</p><p>\u201cBeating yourself up over the what-ifs and maybes doesn\u2019t do you or Lauren any good right now,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cWhat we have to focus on is getting her back.\u201d</p><p>Noah nodded, his jaw tight, and determination so fierce that he wouldn\u2019t entertain any other option took firm grip of his insides.</p> <p>\u201cI heard them talking,\u201d Noah said as they continued to walk toward Seth\u2019s SUV. \u201cThey came looking for her and thought Liam and I were dead. They didn\u2019t waste any time going after her, but they didn\u2019t say a word about killing her. They specifically talked about dumping her on Knight and getting paid. Knight wants her alive, and so if we find Knight, we\u2019ll find Lauren.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 34</p><p>THE entire Colter family along with Max, Noah and Liam, plus most of Seth\u2019s police force and assorted first responders, were crowded into Clyde\u2019s small police station.</p><p>Holly was fussing over Liam and attempting to bandage the wound on his head. She was exasperated because every time something was said, Liam raised his head, upsetting her hold on the dressing.</p><p>Max was pacing back and forth, agony in his eyes and lines of worry etched deep in his forehead. Callie and Lily\u2019s faces were blotchy and tear-stained and they were huddled together on one of the benches, arms wrapped around one another.</p><p>Noah had just put a call into the New York City D.A. and was waiting impatiently to be put into contact with the other man. Seth was standing next to him, murmuring in a low voice for Noah to remain calm and not to accuse the district attorney of anything until they could be sure of what was going on.</p><p>Noah figured they\u2019d know soon enough if the D.A. was involved. It would be evident by how much help he was willing to give them now that Lauren had been abducted.</p><p>\u201cMr. Sullivan, my secretary said it was urgent. What can I do for you?\u201d Richard Castanetti said, his voice tense.</p> <p>\u201cJoel Knight got to Lauren,\u201d Noah said bluntly.</p><p>Noah\u2019s eyebrows rose at the string of curses that blew through the phone.</p><p>\u201cHow? When?\u201d Castanetti demanded.</p><p>\u201cWhen is a short time ago. The how is what we\u2019re wanting to know.\u201d</p><p>There was a long pause. \u201cYou think I had something to do with it? You think I\u2019m dirty?\u201d</p><p>There was more incredulity than anger in the other man\u2019s voice.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what to think,\u201d Noah said quietly. \u201cWe have reason to believe that he\u2019s been searching for her ever since she left him. If that\u2019s the case then the timing could have just been a huge coincidence. It\u2019s possible they\u2019ve been watching her, waiting for the right opportunity to present itself and today was that day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you know? Do you have any leads? What about the local law enforcement? I have a few contacts in Raleigh. I can make some phone calls for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe aren\u2019t in Raleigh,\u201d Noah bit out. \u201cWe\u2019re in Colorado. But if you want to help, you can help us and Lauren and your eventual case by turning over whatever information you have on Knight. His residences, the places he frequents. Any hidey-holes he has. We need to run a fine-tooth comb over his entire life and we need it done yesterday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think he has her? Alive?\u201d Castanetti asked skeptically.</p><p>\u201cWe think it\u2019s likely that Knight doesn\u2019t yet know about the deal she struck with you. He\u2019s an obsessed, controlling bastard whose ego took a blow when Lauren walked out on him and didn\u2019t return. I overheard the assholes who took her talking about delivering her to Knight, so if we can find him, there\u2019s a good chance we\u2019ll find her, and then you can add kidnapping and attempted murder to his charges when you file.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing I\u2019d like more,\u201d Castanetti said in a tone that made Noah believe the man was sincere. \u201cGive me an hour and I\u2019ll pull every piece of information I have on Knight plus put in a few calls to contacts I have with the state attorney general and the FBI. They\u2019re all going to want Miss Wilder to make it out alive. Right now she\u2019s the one person who can take him down. I will tell you this. He rarely leaves the Northeast. It might save you and yours a hell of a lot of time if you get on a plane and start this way while I work out things on my end.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll keep that in mind,\u201d Noah said. \u201cIn the meantime, let me give you a couple of numbers so that one of us can be reached at all times.\u201d</p><p>He gave the D.A. his own cell number, Liam\u2019s and Seth\u2019s before ringing off.</p><p>As he lowered the phone, he met the expectant stares of everyone gathered in the room.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think he did it,\u201d Noah said honestly. \u201cAside from the fact that it just wasn\u2019t feasible for Knight to act on information that Castanetti just received less than twenty-four hours ago, he seems as anxious as we are to nail Knight\u2019s ass to the wall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope to hell you\u2019re right,\u201d Liam said grimly. \u201cOnce Knight discovers that Lauren copied information from his computer and planned to turn it over to the district attorney, her life isn\u2019t going to be worth two cents. The only thing working in our favor right now is that he desperately wants to save face with the people who surround him, and he wants Lauren back under his control. That may buy us enough time to go in and take him down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo who\u2019s going and who\u2019s staying?\u201d Dillon Colter asked. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing when we\u2019re talking about something local. We tend to do things our own way here on the mountain. New York City is a whole different story, and we could all end up getting our asses hauled to jail if we don\u2019t handle this just right.\u201d</p><p>Seth nodded, his lips tight and turned down into a frown. He glanced over at Max. \u201cHave you ever had any face-to-face dealings with Knight?\u201d</p><p>Max\u2019s lips curled in disgust. \u201cHell no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat could work in our favor. You fit in well with the posh, business crowd. You wouldn\u2019t stick out like a sore thumb. We could use you for this.\u201d</p><p>Relief was stark in Max\u2019s eyes. \u201cI\u2019ll go,\u201d he said with no hesitation.</p><p>Seth turned to his brother and one of his dads. \u201cMichael, I still think you and Ethan should stay here with the women. Preferably in one place so you aren\u2019t spread out. You\u2019ll have Mom, Lily and Callie to look after.\u201d</p><p>Holly crossed her arms over her chest, her glare as ferocious as her frown. \u201cWhy can\u2019t we go? My baby is going to need me when we get her back from that asshole. A girl always needs her mother at a time like that.\u201d</p><p>Liam\u2019s gaze softened and he impulsively gathered Holly Colter into his huge embrace. She seemed delighted with the spontaneous hug and gave him one of her own that rivaled his in ferocity.</p><p>\u201cI appreciate you being willing to be there for Lauren, and there\u2019s no doubt she\u2019ll need you. But we want you safe, Mrs. C. All of you. Lauren loves you all so much and she\u2019d be devastated if something happened to you. I promise to bring Lauren home to you where she belongs just as soon as we have her back.\u201d</p><p>Holly patted Liam on the cheek and then leaned up on tiptoe to kiss the spot she\u2019d patted. \u201cSee that you do. Home is important when you\u2019re hurt and scared. I know from personal experience,\u201d she added quietly.</p><p>\u201cHow soon can you have the jet ready to go, Max?\u201d Seth asked. Even before Max could respond, Seth turned to one of the younger deputies and slapped him on the shoulder. \u201cYou\u2019re in charge while I\u2019m gone. Don\u2019t let me down.\u201d</p><p>The deputy looked befuddled but didn\u2019t argue. He stammered out a \u201cyes sir\u201d and then promptly took a seat to contemplate his temporary promotion.</p><p>\u201cBy the time we drive to Denver, Castanetti should have had plenty of time to dig up the info he promised us,\u201d Noah said. \u201cI vote we roll out now and work it out on the way to New York City.\u201d</p><p>The others readily agreed and there was an instant exodus from the sheriff\u2019s station as everyone began to file out. Noah hung back, motioning Liam over.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay, man?\u201d Noah asked in concern.</p><p>His friend had been mostly quiet throughout the entire process and planning session. It was obvious that he was in pain and that he\u2019d suffered a pretty severe head wound.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d Liam said firmly. \u201cNothing a few painkillers won\u2019t solve. I\u2019ve had far worse and still got the job done. This time, it\u2019s not a job, though. It\u2019s personal. I\u2019m going to get her back, Noah, or I\u2019ll die trying. I can\u2019t stand the thought of her having to spend a single minute in his presence, of his hands on her. Of him touching her. Frightening her. Making her doubt even for a moment what a wonderful, sweet, loving woman she is.\u201d</p><p>He stared at Noah for a long moment, pain burning brightly in his eyes. He lowered his voice even more. \u201cWe have to get her back, Noah. I can\u2019t live without her.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 35</p><p>IT was dark when the harrowing ride in the back of the Hummer came to an end. Lauren ached from head to toe from the accident, and being thrown in the backseat without care hadn\u2019t helped her screaming muscles.</p><p>The back door opened, and she tensed when the two men dragged her roughly from the seat. Tears burned her eyelids when her ribs were jostled. Pain shot through her chest and abdomen, and for a moment she felt as though she couldn\u2019t breathe.</p><p>It took a minute for her to realize where she was. Forced to stand on shaking legs between her two abductors, she tried to make sense of her surroundings. As they shoved her forward and her feet came into contact with hard pavement, lights turned on a short distance away, and then came the explosive sound of a jet engine starting.</p><p>They were at a regional airport, though it looked more like a privately owned airstrip, but it was clearly designed for commercial jets to land and take off.</p><p>The cabin door opened, sliding downward to reveal four steps leading into the plane. A figure loomed at the top of the steps, and through the haze of pain and fear, recognition seared through her mind.</p><p>Her stomach balled into a painful knot and her already tense muscles tightened automatically. A defensive gesture associated with the person standing and staring down at her as she was hauled to the bottom step.</p><p>Joel Knight met her in front of the open doorway, his eyes glittering dangerously. She recognized that look. He was furious and high on a power trip. It was a mood where he felt challenged and forced to prove himself to those around him. She\u2019d learned to avoid him at all costs when he got this way.</p><p>He backhanded her without a single word. Her head flew sideways and agony flashed through her face. If the two men hadn\u2019t been holding her arms, she would have tumbled to the ground. Tears leaked from her eyes and slid down over the duct tape still wrapped around her head and mouth.</p><p>She sagged precariously and Joel looked at her in disgust. Then he dug into his pocket, pulling out two ten-thousand-dollar wraps. He handed one each to the two men and then called over his shoulder into the plane. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCome get the bitch.\u201d Then to the two men he\u2019d just paid, \u201cGet lost.\u201d</p><p>The two men didn\u2019t waste any time. They dropped their hold on Lauren and she staggered to keep her footing as they took off for the Hummer.</p><p>A second later, Ron appeared behind Joel. She recoiled when Ron moved past Joel and put his hands on her. This wasn\u2019t happening. She wouldn\u2019t go back to her old life. Not that her current reality would bear any resemblance to the past. Joel had never treated her well, but he wouldn\u2019t show any restraint now. He felt betrayed by her and he\u2019d want revenge. He\u2019d want to save face. Losing her had been a blow to his ego.</p><p>She\u2019d walked out on him. She\u2019d refused to recognize her good fortune in landing a man like him. He\u2019d never forgive her for that transgression.</p> <p>Ron hoisted her up and tossed her over his shoulder. As soon as his body made contact with her ribs, she screamed in agony. The sound was horrible, muffled by the tape over her mouth, but it was the sound of agony that couldn\u2019t be disguised.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell did you do to her?\u201d Joel demanded as Ron climbed the steps into the plane.</p><p>\u201cNot a damn thing,\u201d Ron defended.</p><p>Ron tossed her down onto the couch in the back of the plane, and she let out another garbled sound, nearly passing out. She couldn\u2019t get enough air in through her nose.</p><p>\u201cBe careful damn it,\u201d Joel barked. \u201cI don\u2019t know what those dumbasses did to her. Swear to God if they touched what is mine, I\u2019ll cut their dicks off and force-feed them to each other.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to find out much until you get the tape off her mouth,\u201d Ron said dryly.</p><p>\u201cGive the order to take off,\u201d Joel said tersely. \u201cThen find me something to cut the damn tape off.\u201d</p><p>Hysterical laughter bubbled in Lauren\u2019s throat. He\u2019d just nearly knocked her teeth out and he was pissed because the assholes he\u2019d hired may have hurt her. Apparently only he was allowed to abuse her.</p><p>She rolled back against the couch when the plane started forward. Ron returned a second later, holding a knife out to Joel.</p><p>Joel pulled her over onto her belly and panic blew up. It was worse because she had no way to fight. She hated being pinned down this way. Hated it!</p><p>He sawed at the tape around her wrists and finally worked it free. Her arm flopped forward, falling over the edge of the couch, and her shoulders protested the sudden change in position. She moaned against the tape over her mouth and tried valiantly to keep the tears at bay.</p> <p>Next he freed her ankles, and then he began working on extracting the sticky tape from her hair. She was surprised he didn\u2019t grow impatient and just hack her hair off, but then her hair has always been something he liked and hadn\u2019t wanted to change about her.</p><p>She braced herself to have half her skin and lips taken off when he ripped the tape from her flesh, but he was surprisingly gentle, working it a little at a time until finally it came free.</p><p>She automatically licked her cracked, dry lips. Then she pushed herself upward, refusing to remain in so vulnerable a position.</p><p>Joel assisted her, nothing forceful in his touch. It only made her fear him more, because she knew how quickly the pain could come. It was almost as if he liked to keep her aware at all times that he could do as he chose. He liked to follow tenderness with brutality, and then he\u2019d always follow up pain with a caress.</p><p>\u201cWould you like some water?\u201d he asked, frowning at her appearance.</p><p>She nodded, not trusting her voice not to crack, and the last thing she wanted was to demonstrate her terror. She wouldn\u2019t give him that satisfaction.</p><p>Ron appeared with bottled water, and Joel took it from him and carefully held it to her lips, refusing to let her hold it.</p><p>She drank greedily, closing her eyes as the cool liquid soothed the rawness of her throat.</p> <p>When Joel took it away, she lifted her gaze warily, waiting for whatever came next.</p><p>Joel frowned. \u201cWhat happened to you? What did those idiots do to you?\u201d</p><p>Since he seemed concerned, at least on the level that someone had possibly damaged something he viewed as a possession, and he was exceedingly possessive of things that belonged to him, Lauren didn\u2019t provoke him and instead played his game.</p><p>\u201cThey forced my vehicle off the side of a mountain,\u201d she said in a low voice.</p><p>Joel\u2019s frown turned to an all-out scowl. \u201cThey caused you to wreck?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cFucking morons,\u201d Joel exploded. \u201cThey had explicit orders to deliver you to me. Alive. How the hell could they possibly be certain you\u2019d survive a plunge over the side of a mountain?\u201d</p><p>She lowered her gaze as questions bit at her lips. She wanted to ask him if he was the idiot since he didn\u2019t seem to get that she wanted nothing to do with him. But she was hurt and the last thing she wanted was to enrage him to the point he got violent. At the moment, he seemed genuinely concerned\u2014or at least inconvenienced\u2014over her injuries.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you hurt? I heard you cry out when Ron carried you onto the plane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy ribs,\u201d she said slowly. \u201cHurts to move. Hurts to breathe. I\u2019m worried they\u2019re broken.\u201d</p><p>Joel swore and then bellowed for Ron to return. When the man appeared in the sitting area, Joel said, \u201cCall ahead and have my personal physician waiting for us when we arrive. Give him the rundown on Lauren\u2019s condition and tell him she needs pain medication and X-rays.\u201d</p><p>Ron nodded and disappeared once more.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not happy with you, Lauren,\u201d Joel said coldly. \u201cLook at me when I\u2019m talking to you!\u201d</p><p>Swallowing back the rage building in the pit of her belly, she slowly lifted her gaze to meet the eyes of a demon.</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t be in your present condition if you hadn\u2019t been stupid and tried to walk away from me. No one walks away from me. Do you understand that? There is not a place on this earth you can hide from me. I will find you. I\u2019ll never stop looking. And I\u2019ll kill anyone who helps you, who is with you, who interferes in any way. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re mine, Lauren. You belong to me. You\u2019re my property. I make all the decisions regarding your well-being, your life, your very existence. The sooner you accept that, the more peaceful your life will become.\u201d</p><p>Oh God. She couldn\u2019t bear it. She wanted to scream Noah\u2019s and Liam\u2019s names and keep screaming until they came for her. They had to find her.</p><p>\u201cNow get down on your knees and prepare to apologize,\u201d he ordered.</p><p>Her eyes widened and she stared at him in horror. His face reddened with rage at her reaction and before she could defend herself, his hand was in her hair, twisting the strands in his fist. He yanked her from the couch and she landed on the floor, the jolt sending pain racing through her midsection.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t learn,\u201d he ground out. \u201cYour defiance will bring you nothing but misery. I guarantee it, Lauren. Now get up on your knees.\u201d</p><p>He let go of her hair, his hand going to the fly of his pants. Tears sliding endlessly down her cheeks, she pushed herself upward until he cupped her chin in his merciless grip.</p><p>She closed her eyes and forced herself out of her body, to a place where Joel couldn\u2019t hurt or humiliate her. She focused on Noah and Liam and their love for her.</p><p>Joel might control her body, but he\u2019d never control her heart or her mind.</p><p>For the men she loved, she could and would endure anything Joel forced on her. She just had to hold on and do whatever it took to survive until they came for her.</p><p>Chapter 36</p><p>NOAH\u2019S cell rang as he and the others were boarding Max\u2019s jet. Recognizing the number as an NYC area code, he hastily answered.</p><p>\u201cNoah, this is Rick Castanetti. I have something for you. We just got a huge break.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou found him? Did you find Lauren?\u201d Noah demanded. \u201cIs she okay?\u201d</p><p>Around him, everyone went completely silent. Liam pushed in next to Noah and put his ear close to Noah\u2019s head so he could hear the conversation.</p><p>Noah punched the button to put Castanetti on speaker and then held the phone in front of him so everyone could listen.</p><p>\u201cWe just got a tip from an informant that Knight\u2019s personal physician got a call to meet Knight at his lake house in upstate New York to treat Miss Wilder\u2019s injuries.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat injuries?\u201d Liam demanded. \u201cWhat the hell did that bastard do to her?\u201d</p><p>Noah held up his hand to silence Liam before he blew completely up. \u201cWe don\u2019t know if she was hurt in the accident or not. Let\u2019s not assume the worst. He can\u2019t have had her in his possession that long yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re flying to a private airstrip owned by Knight. He typically takes his helicopter and lands it on the property, but this is where you catch a break. The airstrip he owns is a good forty-five minutes from his house. There\u2019s a commercial field ten minutes away you could land at, and it will even the odds on time. With the head start he got on you leaving Denver, there\u2019s a good chance you\u2019ll get there not long after he does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is this lake house?\u201d Noah bit out.</p><p>\u201cYou have to know that you can\u2019t be the first in,\u201d Castanetti said in a low voice. \u201cI have to go through the channels on this one.\u201d</p><p>Noah sucked in his breath and hoped like hell he wasn\u2019t trusting the wrong man. \u201cYou can\u2019t call this in.\u201d</p><p>There was a long silence over the line.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d Castanetti demanded. \u201cYou don\u2019t want me to ensure that the police get there to prevent any harm coming to Miss Wilder? Are you crazy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t call it in because Knight would know about it and then we\u2019d lose Lauren. Right now we know where he\u2019s going. That gives us the edge. If you arrange a sting, he\u2019s going to disappear, taking Lauren with him, and we\u2019ll have lost our one chance to get to her and take Knight down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like what you\u2019re insinuating,\u201d Castanetti said in an angry, pissed-off tone.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not insinuating anything. I know damn well that he has some dirty cops on his payroll. I\u2019ve seen the information on the disk Lauren copied from Knight\u2019s computer. And this goes all the way to the top. I\u2019m taking a huge fucking risk even talking to you.\u201d</p><p>There was another long silence, and then a string of curses from Castanetti.</p><p>\u201cI want what\u2019s on that disk, especially if what you\u2019re saying is true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if we get Lauren back, you\u2019ll have it,\u201d Noah said smoothly. \u201cShe\u2019s our top and only priority right now.\u201d</p><p>There was a sigh, and then Castanetti mumbled his agreement and provided specific addresses and locations as well as the airport for them to land.</p><p>Noah motioned for one of the others to copy down the details as Castanetti gave them.</p><p>\u201cHe better not be dead when this is all over with,\u201d Castanetti said when he finished supplying the location.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t guarantee you anything,\u201d Noah said in a low voice.</p><p>If Lauren was threatened in any way, Noah wouldn\u2019t think twice about taking out the bastard.</p><p>\u201cJust don\u2019t get yourselves killed,\u201d Castanetti said in a somber voice. \u201cKnight\u2019s been responsible for too many lost lives as it is. I hope Miss Wilder makes it out of this okay, and I\u2019m not just saying that because I want her on the witness stand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. We\u2019ll keep in touch,\u201d Noah said.</p><p>\u201cSee that you do.\u201d</p><p>Noah hung up as the plane lifted into the air, and grimly surveyed the group of men who\u2019d listened in on the call.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got some time to make up. Knight got a head start, and Lauren\u2019s life depends on us getting to that lake house as quickly as possible.\u201d</p><p>LAUREN huddled on the sofa of the plane and moaned softly when she was jostled by the aircraft touching down. Fear was immediate, because she had no idea where they were or how Noah and Liam would ever be able to find her.</p><p>It was time to be real and not solely rely on someone else to rescue her. She\u2019d escaped Joel once. She\u2019d just have to do it again.</p><p>Only, the first time he hadn\u2019t been expecting it. Now he\u2019d watch her constantly, keep her more firmly under his thumb than he had ever before.</p><p>Despair settled heavy and bleak. Then she grew angry at the defeat that nagged at her. She\u2019d survived Joel once and she was stronger now. She\u2019d survive again.</p><p>\u201cLift her and be careful with her,\u201d Joel ordered. \u201cIf you hurt her, it\u2019ll be your ass.\u201d</p><p>Rough hands slid underneath her, lifting her in one motion as Ron settled her roughly against his chest. It made her furious that Joel was such a nauseating hypocrite. That he acted like he gave a flying fuck about whether she was hurt or not. She thought it more likely that he was so insanely controlling that in his mind she was his to torment, much like a favorite toy a child jealously guards from use by other children.</p><p>She was still numb from the violent episode of earlier. He\u2019d used her. Not for sexual release, but to humiliate and degrade her. He was proving a point and chipping away at her rebellion. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He was trying to break her.</p><p>He had no way of knowing that unlike before, she was infused with purpose. Resolve. She knew her worth. Knew she was loved for who she was. She knew the difference between love and control.</p><p>If he thought he was getting back the same na\u00efvely stupid Lauren Wilder, he was wrong. Dead wrong.</p><p>She was placed in the back of a waiting car and then Joel slid onto the seat next to her, his hand going immediately to her head. It wasn\u2019t a tender gesture. It was a warning. An expression of his dominance and control.</p> <p>She curled herself into a tighter ball and closed her eyes, shutting out his presence. The car pulled away, the seat vibrating against her cheek. She didn\u2019t try to rise. She didn\u2019t move a single muscle.</p><p>Her face was bruised and throbbing from when he\u2019d struck her and then from his rough handling of her later. And her entire midsection ached fiercely. Though she\u2019d played up her injuries to try to get Joel to lay off her, more and more she thought that she may well have broken her ribs in the wreck. It scared her, this faux concern from Joel. He was like a bubbling cauldron just waiting to explode, and she waited for it at any moment.</p><p>The drive took forever, and she was desperately tired but afraid to let herself fall asleep even for a minute. She didn\u2019t want to be put in a position where she was vulnerable and not on her guard.</p><p>When the car finally ground to a halt, she automatically tensed. Joel\u2019s hand tightened on her head.</p><p>\u201cYou should be wary,\u201d he murmured.</p> <p>His voice was calm, but the threat was there. She\u2019d have to be an idiot not to sense the thinly veiled violence that radiated from him.</p><p>\u201cDo as you\u2019re told, Lauren. Don\u2019t make me angry. I\u2019ll have a doctor look at your injuries and determine whether you\u2019re able to accommodate me. If you defy me, I\u2019ll hold you down and fuck you whether you have broken ribs or not.\u201d</p><p>Her stomach lurched and her pulse accelerated. Her hands grew clammy and her forehead was dotted with cold sweat.</p><p>She had no doubt that he\u2019d carry out his threat. When she lifted her head to glance warily at him, she saw that the idea of raping her, knowing she had injuries, excited him.</p><p>As much as she wanted to defy him, to tell him to fuck off and go to hell, she knew she had to be smart and wait for her opportunity.</p><p>He cupped her jaw, holding it painfully tight, his fingers pressing into the bruise he\u2019d put on her earlier.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re mine, Lauren. You belong to me. You don\u2019t walk away. You don\u2019t make the decision that it\u2019s over. Only I make that decision, and I\u2019m not finished with you yet.\u201d</p><p>When she didn\u2019t respond, he squeezed harder until a whimper escaped her lips.</p><p>\u201cDo you understand?\u201d he demanded. \u201cSay it. Say the words. You belong to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m yours,\u201d she croaked.</p><p>His hold lessened and tears stung her eyelids. She inhaled sharply, determined not to give him the satisfaction of seeing how much he\u2019d hurt her.</p><p>\u201cTake her into the house,\u201d he ordered Ron.</p><p>Then Joel got out of the car and strode toward the walkway to the front door, leaving Ron to deal with Lauren.</p><p>As Ron pulled her from the backseat, she quickly surveyed the terrain and considered whether now was the time to try to make her escape. It would take her being able to get free of Ron, but where would she go? They were in a heavily wooded area, and she couldn\u2019t see any highway or lights from other residences.</p> <p>Panic scurried up her spine, and she had to work hard to keep herself calm and focused. Ron obviously didn\u2019t like being saddled with the responsibility of packing Lauren around. His brows were drawn together in a disgruntled expression as he carried her up the walkway.</p><p>\u201cTold him he should have just gotten rid of you a long time ago,\u201d Ron muttered.</p><p>At first she thought she hadn\u2019t heard him correctly.</p><p>\u201cTold him you were a silly bitch. Too easy and too dumb. And now you\u2019re just a pain in the ass. He has a business to run and shouldn\u2019t be wasting time chasing you all over the damn place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be sure to let him know you think so,\u201d she said through her teeth.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll keep your mouth shut or I\u2019ll come at you,\u201d he said coldly. \u201cJoel likes to watch when I fuck a woman. He says it inspires him. Because I don\u2019t give a shit if I break them. I\u2019ll shove my dick up that tight ass of yours and I\u2019ll enjoy making you scream. If you think Joel will protect you, then you\u2019re wrong. He\u2019ll get off watching me work you over and then he\u2019ll fuck you while you lay there and cry.\u201d</p><p>He strode through the open door while she lay rigid in his arms, his words echoing over and over in her horrified mind. It was a threat, yes, but he sounded so certain. There was knowledge in his tone, as if he\u2019d done just as he\u2019d described to other women Joel had been with.</p><p>They were both twisted, fucked-up psychopaths whose hatred for women ran soul deep.</p><p>He entered the living room and dumped her onto the couch, earning him a frown from Joel, but Joel didn\u2019t reprimand him.</p><p>When Lauren straightened herself, she saw another man about Joel\u2019s age standing beside Joel, arms crossed over his chest.</p><p>This must be the physician Joel had summoned to meet them.</p><p>\u201cSee to her,\u201d Joel said. \u201cShe was in an accident. She may have broken her ribs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t be sure without X-rays,\u201d the doctor began.</p><p>\u201cI only want to know if she\u2019s okay to fuck,\u201d Joel said coldly.</p><p>Lauren was utterly appalled, humiliation sucking her into its dark embrace. The doctor hesitated but then made his way over to Lauren.</p><p>He went to one knee on the couch in front of her.</p><p>\u201cLie down, please,\u201d he said in a stiff voice that told her he was uncomfortable with the situation.</p><p>Slowly she lowered herself until her head met the cushions. She went tense when his hands lifted the hem of her shirt and started to pull it up over her breasts.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t hurt you,\u201d he said in a low voice. \u201cI\u2019ll do my best to be gentle.\u201d</p><p>He splayed his hands over her rib cage and then began to press in a series of areas with his fingertips.</p><p>\u201cTell me if at any point you feel more pain when I apply pressure,\u201d he said.</p><p>When he reached the lower part, she winced and let out a gasp. He paused there and then worked his fingers into the area around the tender spot.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said when she let out another cry.</p><p>He probed another few moments and then lifted his gaze to meet hers. \u201cCan you tell me what happened? Did anything hit you in this area? Have you had any difficulty breathing?\u201d</p><p>She recounted the events of the accident in a halting voice.</p><p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t remember hitting anything,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was all a blur. We rolled several times and it was just so fast. And afterward, it didn\u2019t hurt because . . .\u201d</p><p>She broke off, refusing to say she hadn\u2019t felt pain because of the adrenaline of running for her life away from the men pursuing her. Joel\u2019s men. It would only piss him off more.</p><p>But Joel had stepped to the side and was having a rather animated conversation with Ron. She used that moment of distraction to whisper her plea to the doctor.</p><p>\u201cPlease, help me,\u201d she begged. \u201cHe did this to me. And you heard what he wants to do. He wants to rape me. I\u2019m not here willingly. Can you at least call the police when you leave?\u201d</p><p>His face remained expressionless, but his eyes were heavy with regret and he could no longer hold her gaze. He dropped his eyes and continued his examination.</p><p>Finally he rose and turned in Joel\u2019s direction.</p><p>\u201cShe most assuredly has broken ribs. It\u2019s important you take care with her. I can bind them until you can take her to the hospital. They\u2019ll need to do X-rays, give her proper pain medication and supervise her medical treatment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I pay you to do,\u201d Joel snapped. \u201cI thought you said there was no way to tell if her ribs were broken without an X-ray. And now you\u2019re so sure they are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is bruising in the lower rib cage. Tenderness to touch and at least one feels displaced. If there are breaks higher, she risks puncturing a lung if she isn\u2019t careful.\u201d</p><p>Joel scowled. \u201cYou write her the script for painkillers. I\u2019ll see how things are in the morning before I worry over X-rays.\u201d</p><p>The doctor sighed and turned, casting an apologetic look in Lauren\u2019s direction. He\u2019d tried and she knew he was afraid to do more. She didn\u2019t know what hold Joel had on him, but it was obvious the doctor was captive to Joel\u2019s demands.</p><p>The doctor spent a few seconds scribbling out a prescription from his pad, and then he pulled the top page off and held it out to Joel, who shoved it at Ron.</p><p>\u201cGo have this filled.\u201d</p><p>Then he focused his attention on the doctor and told him to get out. The doctor was only too eager to disappear. He nearly stumbled in his haste to get to the front door.</p><p>When both Ron and the doctor were gone, Joel walked to the couch where Lauren still lay, and he stared down at her, a malicious gleam in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s how this will go, Lauren. Cooperate and please me and I won\u2019t touch your ribs. Piss me off and be difficult and I\u2019ll make you wish you were never born.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 37</p><p>LAUREN lay there frozen, so terrified that she couldn\u2019t think of what she should do. She had no doubt that he would indeed make her very sorry if she fought him, but how could she not? How could she lie there and allow him to use her body as he\u2019d already used her mouth?</p><p>What if she became pregnant? Joel hadn\u2019t ever used condoms with her. He refused. And after she\u2019d left him, she\u2019d gone off birth control because she couldn\u2019t imagine wanting to become involved in a sexual relationship with anyone. She hadn\u2019t counted on Noah and Liam.</p><p>How could she force herself to have sex with him for the sake of survival? It was rape. Even if she didn\u2019t fight him, because her mind and heart was screaming no. She didn\u2019t want this!</p><p>And how could she ever face Noah and Liam if Joel raped her and she\u2019d done nothing to prevent it? Would they even want her anymore? Could they look at her without disgust in their eyes, and could she ever look at them without shame in hers?</p><p>Joel stopped next to the couch, unzipped his fly and shoved his pants just to his hips so that his erect cock came free. It disgusted her that he was so turned on after hearing how injured she was, that he\u2019d actually get off on the idea of forcing her to endure the humiliation of his possession in addition to the pain forced on her because she wasn\u2019t ready or willing. And he knew she wasn\u2019t willing and that she had no desire for him.</p><p>He stroked his erection, the action menacing. He reached with his free hand to knock her thighs apart but then he backed away, his gaze hard.</p><p>\u201cGet up and take your pants off,\u201d he ordered. \u201cI want you completely nude. Be quick about it.\u201d</p><p>Oh dear God. She was out of time. What could she do except obey?</p><p>She pushed herself up before he could find fault and take her hesitancy for disobedience. When her feet hit the floor, she rose shakily, her hands going clumsily to the button of her pants. All the while, she kept her gaze glued to Joel, hoping desperately for an opportunity.</p><p>And then it presented itself.</p><p>Apparently impatient over the time it was taking her, he advanced, releasing his grip on his cock, his hands outstretched as if he\u2019d tear her clothing from her himself.</p><p>Instinct took over. Before she even realized what she was doing, she lunged forward, her hand reaching for his dick and twisting with all her strength.</p><p>Joel\u2019s howl of pain was instantaneous, and he struck out at her face to ward her off. Pain exploded in her jaw, but she hung on tenaciously, determined to do as much damage as she could. She doubled her other fist and struck him repeatedly in the jaw.</p><p>She released him and then drove her knee right into his balls, ignoring the pain in her ribs.</p><p>Joel dropped like a stone onto the floor and she wasted no time turning and running toward the back patio door. She couldn\u2019t go out the front because Ron was suddenly there. She had no access to a vehicle now, but she\u2019d take her chances in the woods, because anything was better than the fate Joel had planned for her.</p><p>She heard Joel\u2019s roar of anger and his instant call for Ron. She flung open the door and bolted into the night, running as fast as her legs would carry her toward the tree line in the distance.</p><p>Almost there. Almost there.</p><p>It was a chant in her mind, a never-ending litany that made her push on even though agony ran like a river through her body.</p><p>Oh God, she was going to make it. She was almost there.</p><p>She was hit from behind with the force of a train. She went sprawling, screaming in agony when she hit the ground, a heavy body atop her.</p><p>Ron.</p><p>He\u2019d caught her.</p><p>Tears of frustration coursed down her cheeks. She\u2019d nearly made it into the cover of the woods. She could have hidden.</p><p>\u201cStupid bitch. You really do have a death wish,\u201d Ron snarled in her ear. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His groin was pushed into her behind and she could feel his enormous erection. The sick bastard was getting off on her helplessness and the chase.</p><p>He pumped his hips forward, mimicking the motion of fucking her from behind.</p><p>\u201cNow I get you,\u201d he said with savage satisfaction. \u201cYou should have let Joel fuck you. He\u2019s much easier to take than I am, but now you\u2019ve pissed him off and he\u2019s going to let me punish you, and I assure you, I\u2019m going to enjoy every minute of making you cry.\u201d</p><p>He pushed himself off her and then dragged her upward. One hand curled tightly into her hair and the other gripped her arm with bruising force as he propelled her forward.</p> <p>Moments later, he pushed her back into the house where Joel was waiting in the living room, his face nearly purple with rage. His eyes were so black that she shivered.</p><p>As soon as they appeared, he stalked over and backhanded her across the face. If Ron hadn\u2019t been holding her so tightly, she would have instantly gone down.</p><p>Then Joel looked up at Ron. \u201cShe\u2019s yours. Bend her over the couch and tie her there. Use her for as long as you want. I don\u2019t care what you do with the bitch, but make sure she suffers.\u201d</p><p>Ron\u2019s eyes gleamed in satisfaction. \u201cShe might be a little loose by the time you get to her.\u201d</p><p>Joel shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t plan to keep her long anyway.\u201d</p> <p>A chill blew over her body at the finality in his tone. He meant to kill her. He wanted to punish her and then he\u2019d kill her for her rebellion.</p><p>Ron tore at her clothes while she stood there, numb, so scared that she couldn\u2019t even think. And then she was naked and he was shoving her toward the couch, his hands mauling her and making her cry out in pain.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t do this. She couldn\u2019t face what was about to happen. She just wanted to die.</p><p>Her mind went blank and she blocked out her reality, retreating to a place where no one could hurt her. She didn\u2019t feel the pain when Ron shoved her over the end of the couch and wrenched her arms back to tie them in place. She closed her eyes and withdrew, blanking everything until she was floating in a soothing sea of nothingness.</p><p>Chapter 38</p><p>LIAM was about to come out of his skin as they raced down the winding drive of Joel Knight\u2019s lake home. Every beat of his heart was magnified ten times until it felt like his chest would explode with the pressure.</p> <p>He was terrified. Lauren had been in Knight\u2019s hands for hours. If Knight hadn\u2019t already killed her, Liam could only imagine what he\u2019d done to her.</p><p>The tension inside the SUV was tangible. Noah\u2019s hands gripped the steering wheel while Seth and Dillon were in the second row, stiff and ready to bolt into action. In the back, Adam and Ryan looked worried, their brows creased with anxiety as they imagined Lauren\u2019s fate.</p><p>Max was on the floor in between Seth and Dillon, his hands knotted together, his knuckles white. Liam wasn\u2019t sure if he was praying or plotting vengeance. Probably a little of both.</p><p>Noah turned off the headlights as they made the last turn and the house came into view. He slammed on the brakes and turned off the engine a good distance from the house and then motioned everyone out.</p><p>There was a car parked in the front. A sleek black Mercedes. Only one light burned from within the house, a beacon for Noah and Liam.</p><p>Seth drew his weapon while Noah and Liam both pulled their guns as well. Then Seth turned to his brother, his dads and Max.</p><p>\u201cYou stay behind us. This isn\u2019t time to play hero and get yourself killed. Let us go in first and take care of any threat. We don\u2019t want this to get bloody unless it\u2019s necessary.\u201d</p><p>They nodded their agreement, but Noah and Liam were already starting across the gravel drive to the house. Liam broke into a run, not willing to wait a second longer to get to Lauren. Noah caught up to him and they charged toward the front door.</p> <p>It was the view from the picture window that stopped them in their tracks. There were no curtains or blinds on the large window looking into the living room, and what they saw made Liam\u2019s blood run cold and then instantly molten with rage.</p><p>Lauren was bent over a couch\u2014naked\u2014and the welts on her back were visible even from a distance. The son of a bitch had beaten her! It looked as if someone had taken a belt to her back. Joel Knight stood to one side, his face set with satisfaction as another man roughly parted Lauren\u2019s legs as he prepared to rape her.</p><p>Liam hurtled to the front door, throwing it open. He barreled into the living room, gun raised.</p><p>\u201cGet away from her!\u201d he roared. \u201cHands up, asshole!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiam, look out!\u201d</p><p>He heard Noah\u2019s shout and then several things happened at once. One gunshot. Then two. Pain bloomed in his left shoulder. The man who\u2019d been abusing Lauren dropped and rolled, and Liam could see he was going for the gun lying beside his discarded pants.</p><p>Liam tried to move to cut off the man\u2019s access, but his reaction time was ridiculously slow and part of his body felt encased with lead.</p><p>Seth stopped in between Liam and the man on the floor and all Liam could get out was, \u201cNo!\u201d He didn\u2019t want Seth Colter to go down for him.</p><p>Seth dove low, tackling the man while Max surged forward and kicked the pistol away from the man\u2019s grasp.</p><p>Knowing that threat had been eliminated, Liam turned his attention to Lauren. Noah was also rushing toward Lauren, and they reached her at the same time.</p><p>Noah worked furiously at the ropes around her wrists, while Liam knelt by the couch and gently turned her head in his direction. Her eyes were closed and his heart nearly stopped in his chest.</p><p>\u201cLauren?\u201d he asked softly. \u201cLauren, baby, it\u2019s okay now. Noah and I are here.\u201d</p><p>Even as he spoke, he put his trembling fingers to her neck, feeling for a pulse. His left arm hung uselessly at his side, but he shut out everything but the woman in front of him.</p><p>As Noah got the ropes free, Max pushed in with a blanket to cover Lauren\u2019s naked body. Noah pulled her upward, wrapping her in the blanket, ignoring Max\u2019s demands that he see to his sister\u2019s well-being.</p><p>Ryan and Dillon tried to pull Liam back, their questions urgent about his wound. They tried to get him to sit down, but he shook them off, only wanting to get to Lauren. He pushed Max aside, uncaring of his own injuries or that Max was her brother and by all rights should be the one seeing to her. Lauren was Liam\u2019s. His and Noah\u2019s, and Liam wasn\u2019t leaving her side.</p><p>Noah eased onto the couch, holding Lauren in his arms. Liam knelt in front of Noah, his shaking hand going to Lauren\u2019s bruised and bloodied face.</p><p>Behind them Seth was on the phone, his voice low and urgent. Liam had no idea what happened to Joel or how he himself had been shot, or if Seth had the other man under control, but he wouldn\u2019t allow himself to do anything but focus on Lauren.</p><p>\u201cLauren, honey, you\u2019re safe now,\u201d Noah said in a choked voice. \u201cOpen your eyes. You\u2019re safe, I swear it.\u201d</p><p>Her eyelids fluttered sluggishly and then opened. She stared sightlessly at Liam, almost as if she didn\u2019t recognize him.</p><p>\u201cLauren?\u201d Liam whispered. \u201cIt\u2019s me, baby. It\u2019s Liam.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes were dull and she didn\u2019t react to his voice. It was apparent that she\u2019d retreated to somewhere far away from where she was.</p><p>Noah lowered his head to kiss her brow, but she didn\u2019t stir. She continued to stare lifelessly at Liam, but it was as if she looked beyond him. Into nothing.</p><p>Tears burned Liam\u2019s eyelids. His fingers curled into tight balls. Helpless rage fired through his body. He\u2019d allowed this to happen. She\u2019d been taken by this bastard because she\u2019d protected him and Noah.</p><p>As he lifted his gaze to his friend\u2019s, he saw the same answering grief and rage in Noah\u2019s eyes.</p><p>Liam leaned into Lauren, resting his forehead against hers. \u201cFight this, baby. Don\u2019t let that bastard win. Come back to us. Come back to me and Noah where you belong.\u201d</p><p>He turned, searching out Knight with fury in his heart. He wanted to kill the son of a bitch with his bare hands. But Knight was lying on the floor in a pool of blood, his eyes glassy and fixed in death. He glanced back to Noah, question in his gaze.</p><p>\u201cHe shot you,\u201d Noah said in a low voice. \u201cYou barged in, intent on saving Lauren, and you never even saw him pull his gun. I had to put him down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Liam said savagely.</p><p>Then he put his forehead to Lauren\u2019s once more.</p><p>\u201cHe can\u2019t hurt you anymore, baby. He\u2019ll never hurt you again.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t stir, and fear gripped Liam\u2019s throat. He glanced up at Noah again, grief so thick he had to swallow back the knot in his throat.</p><p>\u201cWhat did he do to her?\u201d he asked in an agonized voice.</p><p>He touched her bruised face again in a whisper soft touch. He was afraid of causing her more pain. He had no idea what Knight had done to her before he and the others had arrived.</p><p>Noah\u2019s mouth tightened and his throat worked up and down as though he were fighting the same overwhelming grief that consumed Liam.</p><p>\u201cWe were too late,\u201d Noah whispered. \u201cHe hurt her. The son of a bitch put his hands on her. Did you see the marks on her back? The bruises on her face? Not to mention the bruises and marks we can\u2019t see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNoah, Liam.\u201d</p><p>Seth\u2019s grim voice broke into their conversation. Liam turned to see the other men standing right behind them, worry reflected in their gazes. To the side, the man who\u2019d been about to rape Lauren when they arrived was bound hand and foot, forced to sit upright against the wall.</p><p>\u201cThe ambulance just pulled up,\u201d Seth continued. Then he looked at Liam. \u201cYou and Lauren both need to go to the hospital. You\u2019ve been shot and you\u2019re still losing blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not leaving her,\u201d Liam said fiercely.</p><p>Adam held up his hand. \u201cNo one said you had to, son. We\u2019ll all be there. She won\u2019t be alone. Let\u2019s get you patched up so you can be with her that much sooner. The quicker you let them take a look at that arm, the quicker you can be back with her. She needs to be in the hospital.\u201d</p><p>Noah nodded his agreement. A moment later, the paramedics entered the living room, followed closely by the local police. It was a madhouse of endless questions. To Liam\u2019s frustration he was separated from Lauren as one medic tended her and the other bandaged his arm.</p><p>When they began to wheel her away on a stretcher, Noah walking beside it holding Lauren\u2019s hand, Liam bolted up from the couch and strode after them. Over his dead body were they leaving without him.</p><p>Max was about to climb into the back with Noah and Lauren when Liam shoved him out of the way and hauled himself up to sit beside Noah on the bench next to the stretcher. When Max would have protested, Adam put his hand on his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cThink what you would do if it was Callie and her brothers were trying to be at her side. They love her. Just like you love Callie. You\u2019d never allow yourself to be parted from her, just like Noah and Liam won\u2019t allow themselves to be away from her. Let them go. We\u2019ll follow behind and you can see her at the hospital.\u201d</p><p>Max sighed, but Liam could see that Adam\u2019s words had hit the mark. Liam sent Adam a grateful look. The last thing Liam wanted was a confrontation with Max Wilder when the priority had to be on getting Lauren the care she needed.</p><p>The other medic closed the doors and then hurried to get into the cab. Liam reached down for Lauren\u2019s hand, pulling it up so he could twine their fingers together.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re with you, baby,\u201d he whispered. \u201cWe won\u2019t leave you.</p><p>He leaned down to brush his mouth across her delicate hand.</p><p>\u201cI love you. Don\u2019t leave me, Lauren. Hang in there and be strong. We\u2019ll guide you back home.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 39</p><p>DOES it make me a complete bastard that I\u2019m not sorry you had to shoot that asshole?\u201d Liam muttered in a low voice as he waited for the nurse to return so he could get out of this goddamn room.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Noah said simply. \u201cIt simplifies matters. Lauren won\u2019t have to testify against him now that he\u2019s dead. We turn over the disk to the D.A. and let him do the clean up.\u201d</p><p>Liam nodded and glanced impatiently toward the door. Max was with Lauren, a concession he and Noah had been willing to make only because she currently slept, and they\u2019d been assured by the doctor that she would remain so for a few hours yet. When she awoke, Liam and Noah would be by her side, and Max would just have to deal.</p><p>But first he had to get the hell out of this damn exam room.</p><p>\u201cWhere the fuck is she?\u201d</p><p>Noah sighed. \u201cChill, man. You took a bullet. It\u2019s a wonder they haven\u2019t tied your ass to the bed. You should be lying down and taking it easy, not running all over the damn place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou saw her,\u201d Liam said in a quiet voice. \u201cWould you have her wake up and us not be right there? She was out of it, Noah. She\u2019d retreated to God knows where, and at this point I\u2019m worried we\u2019re not going to get her back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll get her back,\u201d Noah said firmly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His arms were folded tightly over his chest and his jaw was set in a tight line. There was a hard glint to his eyes and his face was set in determination.</p><p>Then Noah\u2019s gaze settled on Liam\u2019s bandaged arm.</p><p>\u201cYou know that\u2019s going to hurt like a son of a bitch when the adrenaline wears off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt already hurts like a son of a bitch,\u201d Liam muttered.</p> <p>Noah shook his head. \u201cThen take the goddamn pain medication.\u201d</p><p>Liam\u2019s lips twisted into a mutinous line. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be fucking fuzzy-headed when we see Lauren. There\u2019ll be plenty of time to take that shit later. She\u2019s what\u2019s important.\u201d</p><p>He turned his head toward the door again.</p><p>\u201cWhere the fuck is the nurse? What could possibly be taking so long?\u201d</p><p>He would have slid from the exam table and stalked out, but Noah stepped in front of him and shoved him back. Hard.</p> <p>\u201cSit your ass down. She\u2019s only been gone a few minutes. Adam and Ryan are outside Lauren\u2019s room, and they promised to let us know the minute she begins to come around.\u201d</p><p>Liam bit out a string of expletives but settled back on the exam table, his injured arm tight against his body. He wouldn\u2019t admit it, but it was killing him. Nausea coiled low in his belly and sweat beaded his forehead. But he wouldn\u2019t admit it, because he didn\u2019t want to chance any delay in getting to Lauren.</p><p>He was still haunted by the scene he and Noah had witnessed. He was tortured by what had happened before they arrived. He\u2019d seen the marks and bruises from Knight\u2019s abuse, but how many more were inside Lauren where no one could see?</p><p>A heavy ache settled into his chest, more pressing than even the pain in his arm. Lauren had withdrawn. A self-defense mechanism to protect her from her terrible reality. Liam just wanted her back. In his arms. But he\u2019d failed her in a big way. He\u2019d sworn that he\u2019d do everything possible to keep her safe, but had he?</p><p>He bolted more upright when the nurse came back into the room. She glanced warily at him and he supposed he couldn\u2019t blame her after the way he\u2019d acted. He\u2019d threatened all sorts of things if he wasn\u2019t released soon.</p><p>Feeling regretful, he tried to ease his expression and relax while she went over his discharge instructions with Noah. She gave everything to him and not Liam, as if she didn\u2019t want to get close enough to Liam to risk potential harm.</p> <p>That put a knot in his stomach. Yeah, he wanted to get back to Lauren, but intimidating women was something Knight got off on, and it didn\u2019t make Liam feel good to be in the same vein.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Liam said gruffly.</p><p>The nurse looked startled, and then she offered a tentative smile, her face softening.</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re worried about her,\u201d the nurse said in a quiet voice. \u201cShe hasn\u2019t awakened yet from the sedative and she\u2019s resting comfortably, in no pain, I promise.\u201d</p><p>Noah let out a whoosh of air in relief and Liam nodded, murmuring his thanks again.</p><p>\u201cTake care of yourself,\u201d the nurse said. \u201cNo way you should be leaving this soon. I gave your scripts to your friend, and you need to make sure you take them or you could end up very sick and in the hospital, and I\u2019m sure you don\u2019t want that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo ma\u2019am, I don\u2019t,\u201d he said meekly. \u201cThank you. I appreciate your help. And your understanding.\u201d</p><p>She offered a bigger smile and then said, \u201cYou\u2019re free to go. Miss Wilder is in room eight just down the hall.\u201d</p> <p>Liam slid from the exam table and winced when he bumped his arm. He\u2019d refused even a sling or for them to immobilize it against his body. He needed his arm to be free just in case. He could hardly protect Lauren tied up and one-handed.</p><p>He followed eagerly behind Noah, simmering with impatience as they strode down the hall. When they got to Lauren\u2019s room, they saw the Colters outside the doorway, leaning against the door frame and across the hall against the wall.</p><p>Adam frowned when he got a look at Liam.</p><p>\u201cShould you be up, son?\u201d</p><p>Ryan held up his hand to Adam. \u201cI know how he feels. And for that matter, if it were Holly and you were the one shot, would you stay away from her?\u201d</p><p>Adam\u2019s lips tightened but he remained silent. Liam sent Ryan a grateful look.</p><p>Ryan put his hand down over Liam\u2019s uninjured shoulder. \u201cShe\u2019s still resting and Max is sitting with her now.\u201d</p><p>Liam nodded and then found Seth\u2019s gaze. \u201cWhat happened with the police?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing yet,\u201d Seth said. \u201cThey\u2019ve been by of course. Surprised they hadn\u2019t made it down to you yet, but their primary focus is Lauren of course. Castanetti is on his way. He wants that disk badly. They\u2019re going to want statements from everyone involved. They\u2019ve already questioned us and we\u2019ll have to go down to make official statements, but we told them we weren\u2019t going anywhere until we knew for certain how you and Lauren were doing.\u201d</p><p>Noah sighed. \u201cDamn it, I don\u2019t want to have to deal with this mess right now. I just want to take Lauren home.\u201d</p><p>Dillon cleared his throat. \u201cAnd where is home?\u201d</p><p>Liam and Noah exchanged looks and then glanced back at the Colter men, whose eyes all mirrored the question in Dillon\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s family,\u201d Dillon continued. \u201cShe\u2019s come to mean a lot to us. She\u2019s like a sister to me and my siblings. She\u2019s like a daughter to our mom and dads. She was . . . happy . . . in Clyde, or at least she was beginning to be. She\u2019d come a long way from the frightened, vulnerable young woman who arrived before Christmas. We just don\u2019t want to see her unhappy again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t discussed it,\u201d Noah said in a quiet voice. \u201cWe have a lot we still have to discuss. All we care about right now is that she\u2019s okay. Not just physically. Everything else can wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right about that, son,\u201d Adam said in a serious tone. \u201cEverything will work itself out. Just focus on Lauren and making sure she has what she needs. Be there for her. She\u2019s going to need you now more than ever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll need us all,\u201d Liam said.</p><p>Even as he spoke the words, he knew them to be true. No matter what may have been in the back of his and Noah\u2019s minds about where they would make their home with Lauren, Liam realized that Lauren would need time. She hadn\u2019t fully healed from her relationship with Knight, much less her abduction and abuse at his hands. It wasn\u2019t something that would be resolved in days or even weeks.</p><p>There was no way he and Noah could take her from a place she felt safe and a family who loved her and offered her invaluable support.</p><p>A sudden commotion from down the hall made them all jerk around, alert and wary.</p><p>\u201cWhere are my sons?\u201d an imperious tone demanded.</p><p>It was a voice that instantly warmed Liam and terrified him all at the same time, because if there was one person he toed the line with, it was his mother.</p><p>Chapter 40</p><p>LIAM\u2019S eyes widened and then narrowed as he swung back around to pin Noah with his glare.</p><p>Noah shrugged. \u201cShe needed to know and I wasn\u2019t about to get my ass in a sling by not telling her you got shot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell,\u201d Liam muttered.</p><p>It was at that moment that Lisa Prescott stalked down the hall, her husband close on her heels.</p><p>\u201cLiam!\u201d she cried when she saw him.</p><p>He braced for impact and in the next moment was enfolded in her fierce embrace. It was automatic to smile, because how could he not?</p><p>She let go of Liam and then pushed by him to drag Noah into her arms.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right, son?\u201d his father asked in a serious tone.</p><p>Liam\u2019s mom, who by now had finished making sure that Noah was unharmed, tuned back just in time for Liam\u2019s dad\u2019s question.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you up?\u201d she demanded. \u201cShouldn\u2019t you be in a hospital bed? What kind of hospital are they running here?\u201d</p><p>Liam held up his hand. \u201cMom, I\u2019m fine. Just a flesh wound. It\u2019s been taken care of. I\u2019m more worried about Lauren.\u201d</p><p>Lisa Prescott\u2019s eyebrow went up. \u201cLauren was hurt? What happened?\u201d</p><p>Dillon Colter coughed discreetly and then said, \u201cWe\u2019re just going to go down and get something to drink. We\u2019ll be back in a little while to check in on Lauren.\u201d</p><p>Before introductions could be made\u2014and really, they could certainly wait\u2014the Colters walked by Liam, Noah, and their parents and disappeared around the next corner.</p><p>\u201cWhat is going on, Liam?\u201d his mom asked. \u201cNoah scared the life out of me when he called to say you\u2019d been shot. I know your job isn\u2019t the safest job in the world, but someone shot you?\u201d</p><p>Liam sighed and then sent Noah a look to say that he wasn\u2019t going to do this alone.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t we walk down to the waiting area,\u201d Noah suggested. \u201cWe can talk more privately there.\u201d</p><p>Liam hesitated, not wanting to leave Lauren, even for a short length of time. He still hadn\u2019t even been able to get in to see her!</p><p>\u201cGive me just a minute,\u201d Liam finally said.</p><p>He pushed Lauren\u2019s door open, and Max swung around to see who entered.</p><p>\u201cHow is she?\u201d Liam asked in a whisper as he approached the bed.</p><p>\u201cResting,\u201d Max said.</p><p>He didn\u2019t offer more and Liam didn\u2019t press. He simply stood at the bed, staring down at Lauren\u2019s bruised face. A harsh growl echoed through the room, and for a moment, Liam thought he\u2019d made the sound, but then he realized it came from Noah, who\u2019d followed him into the room.</p><p>\u201cMy parents are here,\u201d Liam said to Max. \u201cWe\u2019ll be down the hall with them. Lot to explain. We\u2019ll be back soon. Please let us know if she awakens. I don\u2019t want . . . I don\u2019t want her to wake up and for us not to be here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand,\u201d Max said. \u201cI\u2019ll let you know.\u201d</p><p>Liam leaned down and pressed a gentle kiss to her forehead. \u201cCome back, baby,\u201d he whispered. \u201cIt\u2019s safe now and we love you.\u201d</p><p>He stepped away and let Noah have a moment with Lauren before he walked from the room to meet his parents back in the hallway.</p><p>They were both staring at him with concern in their eyes, but there was also curiosity as they watched Noah come out behind Liam.</p><p>Liam\u2019s mother hugged him again and whispered against his chest. \u201cYou scared me. Never do that again!\u201d</p><p>Then she turned to Noah. \u201cAnd you! Don\u2019t think you\u2019re off scot-free. Thank God you weren\u2019t hurt too.\u201d</p><p>Noah hugged her again, a broad smile on his face.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go sit down,\u201d Liam\u2019s dad said. \u201cLiam doesn\u2019t need to be standing.\u201d</p><p>They walked down the hall to a small waiting area, and Liam sank onto one of the chairs. He\u2019d never admit it in a million years, but sitting down felt pretty damn good at the moment.</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s going on?\u201d Lisa Prescott asked bluntly. \u201cYou explained about Lauren on the phone, but I thought it was a matter of her testifying and that there would be lots of protection. I never imagined that either of you would be taking such a huge risk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe man who abused Lauren found her in Colorado,\u201d Noah said in a quiet voice. \u201cThey forced our vehicle off the road and took Lauren. I don\u2019t even know what all has been done to her yet. When we found her, it didn\u2019t look good.\u201d</p><p>Lisa\u2019s expression turned to one of sympathy, her eyes darkening. \u201cAnd do the both of you still feel . . . the same? I mean that you both want to be with her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d Liam said with no hesitation.</p><p>\u201cHave you thought this through?\u201d Carl Prescott asked in a somber voice. \u201cI mean really thought it through your initial attraction and feelings? Is this something you really believe is going to work out long term?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want a woman to come between you,\u201d Lisa cut in, her expression pained. \u201cThat\u2019s my only concern with your . . . arrangement. I don\u2019t want this to put a wedge in our family. You boys are too important to me.\u201d</p><p>Liam reached over and squeezed his mother\u2019s hand. \u201cI understand your concern, Mom. I do. I can\u2019t even explain it, but this is . . . right. For all of us. We love her. She loves us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope for your sake she does,\u201d she said softly. \u201cI want you to be happy.\u201d She looked to Noah, including him in her gaze. \u201cI want you both to be happy. I always imagined a slightly different future, though.\u201d</p><p>Her face twisted into a rueful smile as she said the last. But there was also acceptance in her gaze, and it warmed Liam\u2019s heart. His mom was the best. Always looking out for her boys. She wanted the best for them. And Lauren was the best thing that ever happened to either him or Noah.</p><p>Carl just shook his head, obviously puzzled by the whole situation.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll love her,\u201d Noah said. \u201cJust as much as we do. I\u2019m sure of it. No one can be around Lauren without falling in love.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMom?\u201d Liam queried.</p><p>She\u2019d gone silent, and he wasn\u2019t entirely certain what she was thinking. The last thing he wanted was to cause either his mother or his father worry or pain, but he couldn\u2019t give Lauren up. He loved her. Lauren was his future.</p><p>She gave him a genuine smile. \u201cI\u2019m sure we\u2019ll adore her. How could we not when she\u2019s shown such good judgment in loving not one but both of my sons? You\u2019ll just have to give me\u2014us\u2014time to understand. This isn\u2019t something you come across every day. It\u2019s going to take some adjustment in my thinking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat means a lot to all three of us,\u201d Liam said.</p> <p>She reached over to pat his leg. \u201cWill you at least promise me you\u2019ll rest and take it easy until you\u2019re healed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll try,\u201d he conceded.</p><p>\u201cNoah, Liam, she\u2019s coming around,\u201d Seth said from the doorway.</p><p>Both men\u2019s heads came up, and then they surged upward from their chairs.</p><p>Ignoring the pain in his arm, Liam hurried to the door. His mom caught his other arm, causing him to turn back momentarily.</p> <p>\u201cLiam,\u201d she said, her brows drawn together. \u201cYour father and I want to meet her, but we realize this isn\u2019t the time. We\u2019ll try to understand, but what you have to understand is that this is hard for me. A mother wants so much for her children, and this arrangement scares me because you or Noah could so easily be hurt.\u201d</p><p>Liam\u2019s heart went soft as he stared back at his mom. He pulled her against his chest with his good arm and squeezed tightly.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Mom. But please don\u2019t worry. Noah and I have given this a lot of thought. This is what we want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd is it what she wants?\u201d Lisa asked quietly.</p><p>\u201cGod I hope so,\u201d Liam breathed.</p><p>She patted his face and then reached over to give Noah\u2019s hand a quick squeeze. \u201cGo on. I know you two are anxious to see her. We can talk later.\u201d</p> <p>Liam needed no further urging. He strode down the hall to Lauren\u2019s room and saw the Colters congregated outside her door. They looked up as Liam and Noah approached.</p><p>\u201cHow is she?\u201d Liam asked anxiously.</p><p>Seth gave him a look that sent Liam\u2019s hopes plummeting.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s awake. Max is trying to get her to talk. She still seems like she\u2019s in shock or at least unaware.\u201d</p><p>Noah cursed and then, without another word, pushed past the Colter men and walked into Lauren\u2019s room. Liam hurried behind him.</p><p>Max looked up when they walked in, his gaze hopeful. He got up, leaving Lauren\u2019s bedside, and strode over to intercept them.</p><p>\u201cMaybe she\u2019ll respond to you,\u201d Max said in a low voice. \u201cI\u2019ve been talking to her but it\u2019s like I\u2019m not even here.\u201d</p><p>Noah and Liam glanced toward the bed and then left Max. They took either side, both reaching for her hands. Liam brought her fingers to his lips. They were so cold.</p> <p>He blew his breath over the tips to warm them and then captured her hand between his palms, rubbing to generate heat. Then he lowered himself to put him in the path of her sight.</p><p>\u201cLauren, baby, can you hear me?\u201d</p><p>He waited a moment, and when she didn\u2019t so much as blink, he brushed his hand across her forehead and trailed his fingers down the curve of her cheek. He followed his hand with his mouth and inhaled her scent as he pressed his lips to her temple.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re here, honey,\u201d Noah said, his voice cracking under the weight of his emotion. \u201cYou\u2019re safe now. That bastard can\u2019t ever hurt you again.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes flickered and slowly she turned her head so she focused on Noah.</p><p>\u201cIs he dead?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Joy and hope exploded in Liam\u2019s mind. He gripped her hand tighter, his urge to pull her into his arms overwhelming.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Liam said with savagery.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>The simple word conveyed a wealth of relief.</p><p>\u201cHow are you?\u201d Noah asked. \u201cAre you hurting? Did he . . .\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t finish because Lauren flinched and looked away, her body immediately tense. Liam wanted to put his fist through the wall. He and Noah exchanged fierce glances even as they tried to maintain their composure.</p><p>\u201cMy ribs,\u201d she said faintly. \u201cI think I must have broken some in the accident. Hurts.\u201d</p><p>Noah turned toward the door where the others were standing. \u201cGet the doctor in here. Or a nurse. Someone who can tell us what her condition is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn it,\u201d Dillon said before disappearing.</p><p>\u201cListen to me,\u201d Liam said in a low voice, his head close to hers. \u201cI want you to rest and focus on feeling better and the fact that Noah and I love you. Joel Knight can never hurt you again. You\u2019re free.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes filled with tears and it nearly broke his heart right in two. They tracked down her cheeks in silver streams as she stared sightlessly toward the ceiling.</p><p>\u201cI want to go home,\u201d she choked out.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll take you home,\u201d Noah promised. \u201cAs soon as the doctor says it\u2019s safe for you to travel, we\u2019ll take you back home.\u201d</p><p>Even as Noah made the quiet vow, Liam knew that it was the right thing to say. Whatever sacrifices he and Noah had to make to ensure Lauren\u2019s happiness was worth it. She belonged in Colorado with her family and the two men who loved her surrounding her. She needed them all. Now, more than ever.</p><p>Somehow he and Noah would have to make it work. Love was about sacrifices, and Liam would sacrifice anything and everything to be with Lauren and to see her smile again.</p><p>Chapter 41</p><p>WHEN the nurse came in, Liam told her that Lauren was in pain, and as the nurse administered the pain medication, Lauren drifted off, her eyelids fluttering closed.</p><p>Her lashes were dark against her cheeks and bruises shadowed her beautiful face. As Noah stood there staring down at her, he was struck by the enormity of what she\u2019d survived and escaped.</p><p>He knew there was more. He knew she\u2019d endured the worst, but he was so goddamn relieved to have her back that he was weak with it.</p><p>\u201cThe doctor will meet you outside,\u201d the nurse said in a quiet tone. \u201cHe\u2019ll be able to give you the X-ray results as well as tell you how long she needs to remain in the hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Noah said.</p><p>He leaned down to press his lips against her forehead and closed his eyes for a long moment.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d he said against her skin. \u201cI love you so goddamn much. We\u2019ll get through this, sweetheart. I swear there\u2019s nothing we can\u2019t beat together.\u201d</p><p>She sighed and turned her face upward as if seeking the comfort of his voice. He ran his fingertips over the delicate lines of her face before finally retreating.</p><p>Liam waited at the door and when the two men stepped out, the doctor walked down the hall toward them. His step was brisk, and he stopped in front of the group of men, his gaze sweeping over them.</p><p>\u201cWhich of you are Miss Wilder\u2019s family?\u201d the doctor asked.</p><p>Every single man spoke up.</p><p>The doctor cleared his throat and glanced skeptically at the assembled group.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re her family,\u201d Adam said in a grave tone. \u201cWe\u2019re her fathers and brothers.\u201d</p><p>Max nodded his agreement.</p><p>\u201cHow is she?\u201d Noah blurted, no longer able to be patient. \u201cWhen can she go home? She\u2019s been asking.\u201d</p><p>The doctor sighed. \u201cI see all manner of things through this emergency room. Some you wouldn\u2019t believe. One would think as often as I see the results of violence that I would be immune to it. And yet it still pisses me off every single time a woman comes through these doors because some bastard used her for a punching bag.\u201d</p><p>The others simmered and seethed, their anger a tangible thing that hovered over them like a cloud.</p><p>\u201cShe fractured two lower ribs and has extensive bruising in that area, whether from the car accident or from abuse. It\u2019s hard to say, and it\u2019s likely that it\u2019s from both.\u201d</p><p>He paused a moment before continuing.</p><p>\u201cConsidering what she\u2019s been through, her physical condition is better than I would have expected. Quite frankly, it\u2019s her mental state that has me the most concerned and why I\u2019m hesitant to release her from the hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe needs to be home where she feels safe and surrounded by the people who love her,\u201d Liam said.</p><p>\u201cI agree,\u201d Max interjected. \u201cI think the sooner we get her back home, the sooner she\u2019ll come around.\u201d</p><p>Noah faced the doctor, his chest tightening with dread. \u201cBesides the fractured ribs, did she sustain any other injury?\u201d</p><p>The doctor folded his arms over his chest, trapping his clipboard against his body. \u201cIt\u2019s my opinion that she wasn\u2019t sexually assaulted. She\u2019s bruised and she\u2019ll be sore for several days, but given the circumstances, she fared far better than one might expect. She\u2019s a tough young woman.\u201d</p><p>Noah let out his breath, nearly light-headed from holding it. \u201cSo can we bring her home? How long will you want her to stay?\u201d</p><p>The doctor seemed to consider the request for a moment. \u201cIf you are indeed going to take her home and see that she gets the proper rest and care, then I\u2019ll discharge her as early as tomorrow morning. I want her to stay at least one night for observation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll have the best care possible,\u201d Max said in a terse voice. \u201cAnd she won\u2019t so much as lift a finger.\u201d</p><p>Noah and Liam both nodded their agreement with Max\u2019s statement.</p><p>Movement behind Adam and Ryan made Noah\u2019s gaze veer in that direction. Liam\u2019s parents had come to stand just behind the assembled group and were listening as the others spoke.</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll have her moved to a private room so she can rest overnight. If all looks well in the morning, the on-call doctor will see her when he makes rounds and he\u2019ll discharge her.\u201d</p><p>Noah extended his hand. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>The doctor shook Noah\u2019s hand and nodded at the others. \u201cWe\u2019ll get her up to a room as soon as possible.\u201d</p><p>When the doctor turned to leave, Noah motioned for Lisa and Carl Prescott to move forward. He introduced them to Max and the Colters and saw Lisa\u2019s eyes widen when the Colter familial situation was explained.</p><p>\u201cIs Lauren all right?\u201d Lisa asked after pleasantries were exchanged.</p><p>Liam sighed. \u201cNo. Not really. But then she shouldn\u2019t be expected to be all right. She was kidnapped by a monster and subjected to God knows what.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe will be, though,\u201d Noah said with determination. \u201cLiam and I are going to take her back to Colorado. Home.\u201d</p><p>Noah saw the knowledge in Liam\u2019s mother\u2019s eyes. To her credit she didn\u2019t argue or try to persuade them differently. Her face softened, as only the love of a mother can soften a woman\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019ll both take good care of her.\u201d</p><p>Carl stepped forward. \u201cIf you need anything, don\u2019t hesitate to let us know. And, Liam, don\u2019t forget in all of this to take care of yourself as well. Your mother worries about both of you. A bullet wound is no small thing so don\u2019t treat it as such.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will, Dad,\u201d Liam said as he was pulled into his mom\u2019s arms.</p><p>Lisa pulled Noah closer until she stood between the two men she called her sons. The Colters and Max had discreetly moved farther down the hall, affording Liam and his parents privacy.</p><p>\u201cWhen she\u2019s better, I\u2019d like you to bring her to visit and to meet us,\u201d Lisa said in a low voice. \u201cI don\u2019t want to burden her right now and I think it better if we leave. I just wanted to be sure you were okay, Liam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d like that,\u201d Noah said. \u201cI think Lauren would like it too.\u201d</p><p>Liam nodded his agreement. \u201cAs soon as she\u2019s up to it, we\u2019ll bring her for a visit. Promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood enough,\u201d Carl said.</p><p>Liam\u2019s father pulled Liam into a bone-crushing hug and then did the same to Noah. Noah winced. Liam got his size and build from his father. Carl Prescott was no slouch at sixty years old. He was a former mixed martial arts fighter and had served in the Marines before going to work in the paper mill he\u2019d retired from. Even so, it was amusing to see that Lisa Prescott had the big man in the palm of her hand.</p><p>This was what Noah wanted. He wanted what Liam\u2019s parents had. He wanted what the Colters had. He wanted Lauren and her love, and wanted to shower her with his love and devotion so that one day their children could look at them and think that they wanted the same.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll let you two get back to her,\u201d Carl said in a gruff tone. \u201cCall us when you get back to Colorado and let us know how things are going. Your mother will worry if she doesn\u2019t hear from you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill do, Dad. Love you,\u201d Liam said.</p><p>\u201cLove you too, son. Both of you.\u201d</p><p>Lisa kissed them both and gave them one last hug before she and Carl headed down the hallway toward the exit.</p><p>Liam turned to Noah, blowing out his breath. \u201cWell. That went a little better than I thought it might.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter 42</p><p>LAUREN laid her head back against the seat and closed her eyes as the plane lifted into the air. On either side of her were Liam and Noah, both touching her in some way whether it was a leg against hers or a hand on her arm. It was a silent reminder that they were there. Just as they\u2019d been every minute since they\u2019d burst into the lake house where Joel had died.</p><p>The last day had been a blur. Constant flow of people in and out of her hospital room. Noah and Liam had been determined that they were taking her back to Colorado at the very first opportunity, despite requests for them to remain in the area for further questioning.</p><p>She\u2019d been questioned at length by the investigator assigned to the case as well as the district attorney whom Noah had turned the disk over to. In truth, she\u2019d paused briefly, considering whether she should give the information now that Joel was dead. It shamed her that she feared reprisal from other quarters once the investigation was launched.</p> <p>But Castanetti had guaranteed her anonymity and that she wouldn\u2019t even have to testify since all she\u2019d done was collect information from Joel\u2019s computer. They\u2019d have to launch their own investigation based on the information she\u2019d provided. She\u2019d given the disk to the D.A. and had immediately felt a weight lifted from her shoulders.</p><p>It was something she should have done from the start. It was hard to come to terms with the fact that, had she not done so much wrong, she wouldn\u2019t have been abducted and subjected to Joel\u2019s abuse, and Liam wouldn\u2019t have been shot rescuing her.</p><p>She shivered and her stomach coiled into a knot. Just being on a plane brought back the memory of what Joel had done to her. What he\u2019d forced her to do. Tears burned her eyelids and she bit into her lip to maintain control.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right, baby?\u201d</p><p>Liam\u2019s concerned voice reached her from what seemed a huge distance. She tried to respond, but she couldn\u2019t even suck in a breath.</p> <p>Panic clawed at her throat, squeezing and knotting. Her chest burned. She was paralyzed with fear.</p><p>There were muffled curses, the sound of seat belts clicking as they were thrown off. Then she was lifted from her seat and carried toward the back where the lounging area was.</p><p>A cold cloth was pressed to her face and strong arms surrounded her.</p><p>\u201cBreathe, honey,\u201d Noah said gently. \u201cTake a breath for me. Can you do that? Look at me. Like this.\u201d</p><p>He inhaled deep and slow through his nose and then let it out through his lips. His gaze bore into hers, willing her to follow his lead.</p><p>She reacted sluggishly, the effort taking every bit of strength she had. Noah framed her face with his hands, forcing her to look only at him and the way he breathed. Liam\u2019s hand smoothed up and down her back, offering comfort, and gradually her chest loosened and the choking sensation was gone.</p> <p>Tears streamed down her face, bathing Noah\u2019s hands. She tried to lower her head, to shrink away from his and Liam\u2019s scrutiny, but Noah held firm and then pulled her into his warm embrace.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got you now,\u201d Noah murmured as he rocked back and forth, his arm securely around her.</p><p>She clutched at his shoulders as she buried her face in his neck. He kissed her hair, her forehead, stroked his fingers through the strands and rubbed up and down her back. His voice was pitched low in a soothing, nonsensical rhythm almost as if he were calming a child.</p><p>Eventually the sobs faded and she lay limply against him, exhausted by the panic attack and emotional breakdown.</p><p>\u201cTell me he\u2019s dead,\u201d she whispered. \u201cTell me again.\u201d</p><p>Noah kissed her forehead and Liam reached for her hands, enfolding them in his much larger ones.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s dead, baby,\u201d Liam said. \u201cHe can\u2019t hurt you again. You\u2019re free now.\u201d</p><p>Tears clouded her eyes and she felt the warm trickle down her face but was too exhausted to call them back.</p> <p>\u201cHe forced me . . . on the plane . . .\u201d</p><p>She could hear her voice rise with hysteria, could feel the panic returning even as Noah\u2019s hold on her tightened.</p><p>\u201cOh God,\u201d she choked out. \u201cHe pushed me to my knees and he forced himself into my m-mouth.\u201d</p><p>Even as she spoke, she wiped at her lips with the back of her hand, over and over as if she could remove the memory.</p><p>\u201cHe used me,\u201d she sobbed. \u201cI\u2019m dirty. I feel so dirty. How could you possibly want to be with me knowing the things he made me do?\u201d</p><p>Liam went to his knee in front of Noah so that she was trapped between them, touching them both. His expression was so fierce that her eyes widened. He tipped her chin with his fingertip and then slid his fingers down her jaw to make sure she was looking at him.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t say it doesn\u2019t matter what he did to you,\u201d Liam bit out. \u201cIt would be bullshit and I\u2019m not going to say shit I don\u2019t mean to try to make you feel better. Of course it matters. He hurt you. He violated you. He took your choices away from you and he forced himself on you. But if you think what he did changes one goddamn thing about the way we look at you or feel about you, then you\u2019re wrong.\u201d</p><p>She stared back into his eyes, seeing the burning sincerity in his gaze. Noah rumbled his agreement, his body so tense against her it was like resting against brick.</p><p>\u201cBut it changes the way I feel,\u201d she said, her voice cracking.</p><p>Liam\u2019s expression went soft, his eyes full of love and understanding.</p><p>\u201cGive yourself some time, baby,\u201d he said gently. \u201cWe\u2019ll get through this together. One day at a time. Noah and I will be with you every step of the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d she said, injecting as much conviction into her voice as she could.</p><p>Liam\u2019s eyes went even softer and he stroked her face with his hand. \u201cI love you too, baby. So much.\u201d</p><p>She turned so she could slide her hand up over Noah\u2019s shoulder, and she hugged him to her. Her face was buried in his neck, his scent surrounding her, filling her. She breathed deep, content here in his arms.</p><p>The panic that had so firmly gripped her just moments earlier had receded, and calm had wrapped her in its soothing embrace.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d she said against Noah\u2019s neck.</p><p>He put his hand to the back of her head and stroked through her hair. \u201cOh honey, I love you so damn much I ache with it. We\u2019re going to get through this together. You, me and Liam. No hurry. We have all the time in the world.\u201d</p><p>The words slid sweetly over her ears and loosened the tension in her chest.</p><p>\u201cWe do, don\u2019t we?\u201d she said in wonder.</p><p>Noah pulled her away from his chest, his smile tender and warm. \u201cWe have nothing but time.\u201d</p><p>She reached for Liam, wanting that contact with him. Noah slid his hand possessively up her back as she curled into Liam, laying her head on his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cI love you both so much and I was so afraid to let myself. But fighting it didn\u2019t feel right. I was afraid to trust myself again after I made so many terrible mistakes, but this time I\u2019m right. I know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn time you won\u2019t question yourself or your decision,\u201d Liam said in a solemn voice. \u201cI plan to convince you on all points that you\u2019ve absolutely made the right decision this time.\u201d</p><p>She kissed him, wanting the deeper intimacy, wanting to show him that she had no doubts. That she loved him. That she wanted a life with him and Noah no matter how difficult the road.</p><p>She slowly retreated from the warmth of his mouth and his touch to turn her face up to Noah. His lips came down in a heated rush to meet hers, and she sighed in contentment.</p><p>Noah pulled back, his hand going to her face in a gentle caress. \u201cWe\u2019re taking you home . . . to stay.\u201d</p><p>Hope soared through her chest, lighting up every part of her soul that was still steeped in darkness. But then just as quickly, reality crept in, her euphoria deteriorating.</p><p>\u201cBaby, don\u2019t look like that,\u201d Liam said, his voice filled with tenderness.</p><p>\u201cWhat will you and Noah do in Clyde?\u201d she asked. \u201cIt\u2019s not fair for you both to have to rearrange your entire lives . . . for me.\u201d</p><p>Noah smiled and leaned his forehead in until it touched hers. \u201cThat\u2019s what you do for the person you love. And it\u2019ll be worth every single change if it means that you\u2019ll be happy, feel safe, and that we\u2019ll be with you every single day for the rest of our lives.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened and Liam scowled. It was a gruff look of annoyance that made him look . . . adorable.</p><p>\u201cDid you honestly think we weren\u2019t in this for the long haul?\u201d Liam demanded. \u201cYou\u2019re it for us, Lauren, and I hope to hell we\u2019re it for you because if not, you\u2019re going to have two surly-ass, love-sick men following you around like damn puppies.\u201d</p><p>She laughed softly, joy filling her heart.</p><p>\u201cWe want forever,\u201d Noah said. \u201cTo be honest, I wanted our proposal to be romantic and in the perfect setting, but fuck it. I just want your promise. Marry us, Lauren. We\u2019ll figure it out. The Colters can give us advice. They\u2019ve made it work for over thirty years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll make it work too,\u201d Liam said, his voice full of conviction.</p><p>There was no doubt in their expressions or their eyes. No hesitancy. They were offering her all she could ever hope for.</p><p>Love.</p><p>Forever.</p><p>Happily ever after.</p><p>All the things she thought she\u2019d never have because she\u2019d made all the wrong choices.</p><p>Laughter bubbled up through the tears burning her eyelids.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d Noah asked, his brows drawn together.</p><p>\u201cI was just thinking about all the bad decisions I made, but then it occurred to me that if I hadn\u2019t made those exact choices, I would have never found the two of you. I guess in a way I have to be grateful for Joel because he was what led me to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck him,\u201d Liam growled. \u201cI like to think we would have found you anyway, and I\u2019m damn sure not going to thank him for anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have an answer for us?\u201d Noah gently prompted.</p><p>It was then that she could see their nervousness. They were worried over her answer. Her heart melted and her chest ached from the overwhelming surge of love.</p><p>\u201cOh yes,\u201d she breathed. \u201cI\u2019ll be with you, marry you, try my best to make you happy for the rest of our lives.\u201d</p><p>Triumph flashed hot and vibrant in Liam\u2019s eyes. Relief was stark in Noah\u2019s gaze. They converged on her, surrounding her as they enfolded her in their embrace.</p><p>Their lips were on hers, taking turns at her mouth, sliding down her cheek. Kisses pressed to her forehead, her temple. Whispers of love in her ear.</p><p>She closed her eyes, savoring every moment. Forgotten was the past, and even the present to an extent. Before her lay the promise of tomorrow, precious and beautiful. Noah and Liam were her future and she was theirs.</p><p>As the plane descended over the Colorado mountains, she was gripped by the rightness of being back . . . home. In a place where she\u2019d first learned the importance of family and unconditional support.</p><p>She was returning. Much stronger this time. Ready to reach forward instead of looking back.</p><p>The Colters were her family, and she very much belonged to them, but now she belonged to Noah and Liam as well. They belonged to her. All that she could ever want was right here in her hands and in her heart. </p> </body></html>"]
