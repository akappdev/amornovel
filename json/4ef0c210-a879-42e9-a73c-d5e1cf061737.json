All he had to do was stride into the Bull and Blossom, claim a bar stool, glower into a pewter tankard and keep his broad, hulking back to the room. And without a word . . . without so much as a glance . . . he had poor Miss Elliott\u2019s fingers trembling as she laid them to the pianoforte keys.</p><p>\u201cOh, I can\u2019t,\u201d the girl whispered. \u201cI can\u2019t sing now. Not with him here.\u201d</p><p>Yet another music lesson ruined.</p><p>Kate never had this problem until a year ago. Before then, Spindle Cove had been chiefly inhabited by ladies, and the Bull and Blossom was a quaint tea shop serving iced cakes and jam tarts. But ever since a local militia had been organized, the establishment had become both the ladies\u2019 tea shop and the gentlemen\u2019s tavern.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t opposed to sharing\u2014but there could be no \u201csharing\u201d with Corporal Thorne. His stern, brooding presence took up the whole room.</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s try again,\u201d she urged her pupil, striving to ignore the intimidating silhouette looming in her peripheral vision. \u201cWe almost had it that time.\u201d</p><p>Miss Elliott blushed and knotted her fingers in her lap. \u201cI\u2019ll never get it right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will. It\u2019s only a matter of practice, and you won\u2019t be alone. We\u2019ll keep working at the duet, and we\u2019ll be ready for a trial performance at this Saturday\u2019s salon.\u201d</p><p>At the mere word \u201cperformance,\u201d the girl\u2019s cheeks went crimson.</p><p>Annabel Elliott was a pretty young lady, delicate and fair\u2014but the poor thing flushed so easily. Whenever she was flustered or nervous, her pale cheeks blazed as though they\u2019d been slapped raw. And she was flustered or nervous far too much of the time.</p><p>Some young ladies came to Spindle Cove to recover from shyness, or scandal, or a debilitating bout with fever. Miss Elliott had been sent in hopes of a different cure: a remedy for stage fright.</p> <p>Kate had been tutoring her long enough to know that Miss Elliott\u2019s difficulty had nothing to do with a lack of talent or preparation. She only needed confidence.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps some new sheet music would help,\u201d Kate suggested. \u201cI find a folio of crisp, new-smelling music to be even better for my spirits than a new bonnet.\u201d An idea struck. \u201cI\u2019ll go into Hastings this week and see what I can find.\u201d</p><p>In truth, she had been planning to visit Hastings for a completely different purpose. She had a call to pay there\u2014one she\u2019d been putting off. Purchasing new music made an excellent excuse.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why I\u2019m so stupid,\u201d the blushing girl lamented. \u201cI\u2019ve had years of excellent instruction. And I love to play. Truly, I do. But when others are listening, I always freeze. I\u2019m hopeless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are not hopeless. No situation is ever hopeless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy parents . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour parents don\u2019t believe you\u2019re hopeless, either, or they wouldn\u2019t have sent you here,\u201d Kate said.</p><p>\u201cThey want me to have a successful season. But you don\u2019t know the pressure they\u2019ve put on me. Miss Taylor, you can\u2019t possibly understand what it\u2019s like.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d Kate admitted. \u201cI suppose I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Miss Elliott looked up, stricken. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. So sorry. I didn\u2019t mean it that way. How thoughtless of me.\u201d</p><p>Kate waved off the apologies. \u201cDon\u2019t be silly. It\u2019s the truth. I\u2019m an orphan. You\u2019re absolutely right\u2014I can\u2019t possibly know what it\u2019s like to have parents with such high expectations and soaring hopes.\u201d</p><p>Though I\u2019d give anything to experience it, just for one day.</p><p>She continued, \u201cBut I do know what a difference it makes to know you\u2019re among friends. This is Spindle Cove. We\u2019re all a bit unusual here. Just remember, everyone in the village is on your side.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone?\u201d</p><p>Miss Elliott\u2019s wary gaze slid to the enormous, solitary man seated at the bar.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s so big,\u201d she whispered. \u201cAnd so frightful. Every time I start to play, I can see him wince.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mustn\u2019t take it personally. He\u2019s a military man, and you know they\u2019re all addled by bomb blasts.\u201d Kate gave Miss Elliott an encouraging pat on the arm. \u201cNever mind him. Just hold your head high, keep a smile on your face, and continue playing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll try, but he\u2019s . . . he\u2019s rather difficult to ignore.\u201d</p><p>Yes. He was. Didn\u2019t Kate know it.</p><p>Even though Corporal Thorne excelled at ignoring her, she couldn\u2019t deny his effect on her own composure. Her skin prickled whenever he was near, and on the rare occasion that he looked her way, his glare had a way of slicing deep. But for the sake of Miss Elliott\u2019s confidence, Kate set her personal reactions aside.</p><p>\u201cChin high,\u201d she quietly reminded Miss Elliott, and herself. \u201cKeep smiling.\u201d</p><p>Kate began playing the lower half of the duet. But when the time came for Miss Elliott\u2019s entrance, the younger lady faltered after just a few bars.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I just . . .\u201d Miss Elliott lowered her voice.</p><p>\u201cDid he wince again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, worse,\u201d she moaned. \u201cThis time he shuddered.\u201d</p><p>With a little gasp of indignation, Kate craned her neck to view the bar. \u201cNo. He didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Miss Elliott nodded. \u201cHe did. It was terrible.\u201d</p><p>That sealed it. For him to ignore her pupils was one thing. Wincing was another. But there was no excuse for shuddering. Shuddering was beyond the pale.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll speak with him,\u201d Kate said, rising from the pianoforte bench.</p><p>\u201cOh, don\u2019t. I beg you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d Kate assured her. \u201cI\u2019m not afraid of him. He might be brutish, but I don\u2019t believe he bites.\u201d</p><p>She crossed the room and came to a stop just behind Corporal Thorne\u2019s shoulder. She almost gathered the courage to tap the tasseled epaulet of his red uniform.</p><p>Almost.</p><p>Instead she cleared her throat. \u201cCorporal Thorne?\u201d</p><p>He turned.</p><p>In all her life she\u2019d never known a man who could look so hard. His face was stony\u2014composed of ruthless, chiseled angles and unyielding planes. Its stark terrain offered her no shelter, nowhere to hide. His mouth was a grim slash. His dark brows converged in disapproval. And his eyes . . . his eyes were the blue of river ice on the coldest, harshest winter night.</p><p>Chin high. Keep smiling.</p><p>\u201cAs you might have noticed,\u201d she said lightly, \u201cI\u2019m in the middle of a music lesson.\u201d</p><p>No response.</p><p>\u201cYou see, Miss Elliott is anxious when it comes to performing for strangers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want me to leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Kate\u2019s own reply surprised her. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t want you to leave.\u201d</p><p>That would be letting him off too easily. He was always leaving. This was their standard interaction, time after time. Kate screwed up her courage and attempted to be friendly. He always found some excuse to promptly leave the room. It was a ridiculous game, and she was weary of it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not asking you to leave,\u201d she said. \u201cMiss Elliott needs practice. She and I are going to play a duet. I\u2019m inviting you to lend us your attention.\u201d</p><p>He stared at her.</p><p>Kate was accustomed to awkward eye contact. Whenever she made new acquaintances, she became painfully aware that people saw only the bold, port-wine splash on her temple. For years she\u2019d tried to obscure her birthmark with wide-brimmed bonnets or artfully arranged ringlets of hair\u2014to no avail. People always stared straight past them. She\u2019d learned to ignore the initial hurt. In time, she went from being just a birthmark in their eyes, to being a woman with a birthmark. And eventually they looked at her and just saw Kate.</p><p>Corporal Thorne\u2019s gaze was altogether different. She didn\u2019t quite know who she was, in his eyes. The uncertainty set her on a razor\u2019s edge, but she kept struggling to find her balance.</p><p>\u201cStay,\u201d she dared him. \u201cStay and listen while we play our best for you. Applaud when we finish. Tap your toes to the rhythm, if you like. Give Miss Elliott a bit of encouragement. And shock me to the fingernails by proving you\u2019ve a smidgen of compassion.\u201d</p><p>Eons passed before he finally gave his succinct, gravelly response.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll leave.\u201d</p><p>He stood, tossed a coin on the counter. And then he walked out of the tavern without looking back.</p><p>When the red-painted door swung shut on its oiled hinges, mocking her with a loud slam\u2014Kate shook her head. The man was impossible.</p><p>At the pianoforte, Miss Elliott resumed playing a light arpeggio.</p><p>\u201cI suppose that solves one problem,\u201d Kate said, trying, as always, to see the bright side. No situation was ever hopeless.</p><p>Mr. Fosbury, the middle-aged tavern keeper, arrived to clear Thorne\u2019s tankard. He pushed a cup of tea in Kate\u2019s direction. A wafer-thin slice of lemon floated in the center, and the aroma of brandy drifted toward her on a wave of steam. She warmed inside before she\u2019d even taken a sip. The Fosburys were good to her.</p><p>But they still weren\u2019t a substitute for a true family. For that, she would have to keep searching. And she would keep searching, no matter how many doors slammed in her face.</p><p>\u201cI hope you don\u2019t take Thorne\u2019s crude manners to heart, Miss Taylor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho, me?\u201d She forced a little laugh. \u201cOh, I\u2019m more sensible than that. Why should I take to heart the words of a heartless man?\u201d She ran a fingertip around the teacup\u2019s rim, thoughtful. \u201cBut kindly do me a favor, Mr. Fosbury.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever you ask, Miss Taylor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe next time I\u2019m tempted to extend an olive branch of friendship to Corporal Thorne . . . ?\u201d She arched one brow and gave him a playful smile. \u201cRemind me to whack him over the head with it instead.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>\u201cMore tea, Miss Taylor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you.\u201d Kate sipped the weak brew in her cup, masking her grimace. The leaves were on their third use, at least. They seemed to have been washed of their last vague memory of being tea.</p><p>Fitting, she supposed. Vague memories were the order of the day.</p><p>Miss Paringham put aside the teapot. \u201cWhere did you say you\u2019re residing?\u201d</p><p>Kate smiled at the white-haired woman in the chair opposite. \u201cSpindle Cove, Miss Paringham. It\u2019s a popular holiday village for gently bred young ladies. I make my living offering music lessons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am glad to know your schooling has provided you with an honest income. That is more than an unfortunate like yourself should have hoped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, indeed. I\u2019m very lucky.\u201d</p><p>Setting aside her \u201ctea,\u201d Kate cast a surreptitious glance at the mantel clock. Time was growing short. She despised wasting precious minutes on niceties when there were questions singeing the tip of her tongue. But abruptness wouldn\u2019t win her any answers.</p><p>A wrapped parcel lay in her lap, and she curled her fingers around the string. \u201cI was so surprised to learn you\u2019d settled here. Imagine, my old schoolmistress, pensioned just a few hours\u2019 ride away. I couldn\u2019t resist paying a call to reminisce. I have such fond recollections of my Margate years.\u201d</p><p>Miss Paringham raised an eyebrow. \u201cReally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes.\u201d She stretched her mind for examples. \u201cI particularly miss the . . . the nourishing soup. And our regular devotionals. It\u2019s just so hard to find two solid hours for reading sermons nowadays.\u201d</p><p>As orphans went, Kate knew she\u2019d been a great deal happier than most. The atmosphere at Margate School for Girls might have been austere, but she hadn\u2019t been beaten or starved or unclothed. She\u2019d formed friendships and gained a useful education. Most important of all, she\u2019d been instructed in music and encouraged in its practice. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Truly, she could not complain. Margate had provided for her every need, save one.</p><p>Love.</p><p>In all her years there, she\u2019d never known real love. Just some pale, thrice-washed dilution of it. Another girl might have grown bitter. But Kate just wasn\u2019t formed for misery. Even if her mind could not recall it, her heart remembered a time before Margate. Some distant memory of happiness echoed in its every beat.</p> <p>She\u2019d been loved once. She just knew it. She couldn\u2019t put a name or face to the emotion, but that didn\u2019t make it any less real. Once upon a time, she\u2019d belonged\u2014to someone, somewhere. This woman might be her last hope of finding the connection.</p><p>\u201cDo you remember the day I arrived at Margate, Miss Paringham? I must have been such a little thing.\u201d</p><p>The old woman\u2019s mouth pursed. \u201cFive years at the oldest. We had no way to be certain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Of course you wouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>No one knew Kate\u2019s true birthday, least of all Kate herself. As schoolmistress, Miss Paringham had decided all wards of the school would share the Lord\u2019s birthday, December 25. Supposedly they were to take comfort from this reminder of their heavenly family on the day when all the other girls had gone home to their own flesh-and-blood relations.</p> <p>However, Kate always suspected there\u2019d been a more practical motive behind the choice. If their birthdays were on Christmas, there was never any need to celebrate them. No extra gifts were warranted. Wards of the school made do with the same Christmas package every year: an orange, a ribbon, and a neatly folded length of patterned muslin. Miss Paringham did not believe in sweets.</p><p>Apparently she still didn\u2019t. Kate bit a tiny corner off the dry, tasteless biscuit she\u2019d been offered, then set it back on the plate.</p><p>On the mantel, the clock\u2019s ticking seemed to accelerate. Only twenty minutes before the last stagecoach left for Spindle Cove. If she missed the stage, she would be stranded in Hastings all night.</p><p>She steeled her nerve. No more dithering.</p><p>\u201cWho were they?\u201d she asked. \u201cDo you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever do you mean?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy parents.\u201d</p><p>Miss Paringham sniffed. \u201cYou were a ward of the school. You have no parents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do understand that.\u201d Kate smiled, trying to inject some levity. \u201cBut I wasn\u2019t hatched from an egg, was I? I didn\u2019t turn up under a cabbage leaf. I had a mother and father once. Perhaps I had them for as many as five years. I\u2019ve tried so hard to remember. All my memories are so vague, so jumbled. I remember feeling safe. I have this impression of blue. A room with blue walls, perhaps, but I can\u2019t be certain.\u201d She pinched the bridge of her nose and frowned at the knotted carpet fringe. \u201cMaybe I just want to remember so desperately, I\u2019m imagining things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiss Taylor\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember sounds, mostly.\u201d She shut her eyes, delving inward. \u201cSounds with no pictures. Someone saying to me, \u2018Be brave, my Katie.\u2019 Was it my mother? My father? The words are burned into my memory, but I can\u2019t put a face to them, no matter how I try. And then there\u2019s the music. Endless pianoforte music, and that same little song\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiss Taylor.\u201d</p><p>As she repeated Kate\u2019s name, the old schoolmistress\u2019s voice cracked. Not cracked like brittle china, but cracked like a whip.</p><p>In a reflexive motion, Kate snapped tall in her chair.</p> <p>Sharp eyes regarded her. \u201cMiss Taylor, I advise you to abandon this line of inquiry at once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can I? You must understand. I\u2019ve lived with these questions all my life, Miss Paringham. I\u2019ve tried to do as you always advised and be happy for what good fortune life has given me. I have friends. I have a living. I have music. But I still don\u2019t have the truth. I want to know where I came from, even if it\u2019s difficult to hear. I know my parents are dead now, but perhaps there is some hope of contacting my relations. There has to be someone, somewhere. The smallest detail might prove useful. A name, a town, a\u2014\u201d</p><p>The old woman rapped her cane against the floorboards. \u201cMiss Taylor. Even if I had some information to impart, I would never share it. I would take it to my grave.\u201d</p><p>Kate sat back in her chair. \u201cBut . . . why?\u201d</p><p>Miss Paringham didn\u2019t answer, merely pressed her papery lips into a thin slash of disapproval.</p><p>\u201cYou never liked me,\u201d Kate whispered. \u201cI knew it. You always made it clear, in small, unspoken ways, that any kindness you showed me was begrudged.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well. You are correct. I never liked you.\u201d</p><p>They regarded one another. There, now the truth was out.</p><p>Kate struggled not to reveal any sign of disappointment or hurt. But her wrapped bundle of sheet music slipped to the floor\u2014and as it did, a smug little smile curved Miss Paringham\u2019s lips.</p><p>\u201cMay I ask on what basis was I so reviled? I was appropriately grateful for every small thing I was given. I didn\u2019t cause mischief. I never complained. I minded my lessons and earned high marks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrecisely. You showed no humility. You behaved as though you had as much claim to joy as any other girl at Margate. Always singing. Always smiling.\u201d</p><p>The idea was so absurd, Kate couldn\u2019t help but laugh. \u201cYou disliked me because I smiled too much? Should I have been melancholy and brooding?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAshamed!\u201d Miss Paringham barked the word. \u201cA child of shame ought to live ashamed.\u201d</p><p>Kate was momentarily stunned silent. A child of shame? \u201cWhat can you mean? I always thought I was orphaned. You never said\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWicked thing. Your shame goes without saying. God Himself has marked you.\u201d Miss Paringham pointed with a bony finger.</p><p>Kate couldn\u2019t even reply. She raised her own trembling hand to her temple.</p><p>With her fingertips, she began to idly rub the mark, the same way she\u2019d done as a young girl\u2014as if she might erase it from her skin. Her whole life, she\u2019d believed herself to be a loved child whose parents met an untimely demise. How horrid, to think that she\u2019d been cast away, unwanted.</p><p>Her fingers stilled on her birthmark. Perhaps cast away because of this.</p><p>\u201cYou fool girl.\u201d The old woman\u2019s laugh was a caustic rasp. \u201cBeen dreaming of a fairy tale, have you? Thinking someday a messenger will knock on your door and declare you a long-lost princess?\u201d</p><p>Kate told herself to stay calm. Clearly, Miss Paringham was a lonely, warped old woman who now lived to make others miserable. She would not give the beastly crone the satisfaction of seeing her rattled.</p><p>But she would not stay here a moment longer, either.</p><p>She reached to gather her wrapped parcel of music from the floor. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to have disturbed you, Miss Paringham. I will leave. You needn\u2019t say any more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I will say more. Ignorant thing that you are, you\u2019ve reached the age of three-and-twenty without understanding this. I see I must take it upon myself to teach you one last lesson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, don\u2019t strain yourself.\u201d Rising from her chair, Kate curtsied. She lifted her chin and pasted a defiant smile on her face. \u201cThank you for the tea. I really must be going if I\u2019m to catch the stagecoach. I\u2019ll see myself out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cImpertinent girl!\u201d</p><p>The old woman lashed out with her cane, striking Kate in the back of the knees.</p><p>Kate stumbled, catching herself in the drawing room entryway. \u201cYou struck me. I can\u2019t believe you just struck me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould have done it years ago. I might have knocked that smile straight from your face.\u201d</p><p>Kate braced her shoulder on the doorjamb. The sting of humiliation was far greater than the physical pain. Part of her wanted to crumple into a tiny ball on the floor, but she knew she had to flee this place. More than that, she had to flee these words. These horrible, unthinkable notions that could leave her marked inside, as well as out.</p><p>\u201cGood day, Miss Paringham.\u201d She placed weight on her smarting knee and drew a quick breath. The front door was just paces away.</p><p>\u201cNo one wanted you.\u201d Venom dripped from the old woman\u2019s voice. \u201cNo one wanted you then. Who on earth do you think will want you now?\u201d</p><p>Someone, Kate\u2019s heart insisted. Someone, somewhere.</p><p>\u201cNo one.\u201d Malice twisted the old woman\u2019s face as she swung the cane again.</p><p>Kate heard its crisp whack against the doorjamb, but by then she was already wrestling open the front latch. She picked up her skirts and darted out into the cobbled street. Her low-heeled boots were worn thin on the soles, and she slipped and stumbled as she ran. The streets of Hastings were narrow and curved, lined with busy shops and inns. There was no possible way the sour-faced woman could have followed her.</p><p>Still, she ran.</p><p>She ran with hardly a care for which direction she was going, so long as it was away. Perhaps if she kept running fast enough, the truth would never catch up.</p><p>As she turned in the direction of the mews, the booming toll of a church bell struck dread in her gut.</p><p>One, two, three, four . . .</p><p>Oh no. Stop there. Please don\u2019t toll again.</p><p>Five.</p><p>Her heart flopped. Miss Paringham\u2019s clock must have been slow. She was too late. The coach would have already departed without her. There wouldn\u2019t be another until morning.</p><p>Summer had stretched daylight to its greatest length, but in a few hours, night would fall. She\u2019d spent most of her funds at the music shop, leaving only enough money for her passage back to Spindle Cove\u2014no extra coin for an inn or a meal.</p><p>Kate came to a standstill in the crowded lane. People jostled and streamed about her on all sides. But she didn\u2019t belong to any of them. None of them would help. Despair crawled its way through her veins, cold and black.</p><p>Her worst fears had been realized. She was alone. Not just tonight, but forever. Her own relations had abandoned her years ago. No one wanted her now. She would die alone. Living in some cramped pensioner\u2019s apartment like Miss Paringham\u2019s, drinking thrice-washed tea and chewing on her own bitterness.</p><p>Be brave, my Katie.</p><p>Her whole life she\u2019d clung to the memory of those words. She\u2019d held fast to the belief that they meant someone, somewhere cared. She wouldn\u2019t let that voice down. This sort of panic wasn\u2019t like her, and it wouldn\u2019t do a bit of good.</p><p>She closed her eyes, drew a deep breath, and took a silent inventory. She had her wits. She had her talent. She had a young, healthy body. No one could take these things from her. Not even that cruel, shriveled wench with her cane and weak tea.</p><p>There had to be some solution. Did she have anything she could sell? Her pink muslin frock was rather fine\u2014a handed-down gift from one of her pupils, trimmed with ribbon and lace\u2014but she couldn\u2019t sell the clothes off her back. She\u2019d left her best summer bonnet at Miss Paringham\u2019s, and she\u2019d rather sleep in the streets than retrieve it.</p><p>If she hadn\u2019t cut it so short last summer, she might have tried to sell her hair. But the locks barely reached below her shoulders now, and they were an unremarkable shade of brown. No wig maker would want it.</p><p>Her best chance was the music shop. Perhaps if she explained her predicament and asked very nicely, the proprietor would accept his music back and return her money. That would afford her enough for a room at a somewhat respectable inn. Staying alone was never advisable, and she didn\u2019t even have her pistol. But she could prop a chair beneath her door and stay awake all night, clutching the fireplace poker and keeping her voice primed to scream.</p><p>There. She had a plan.</p><p>As Kate started to cross the street, an elbow knocked her off balance.</p><p>\u201cOy,\u201d its owner said. \u201cWatch yerself, miss.\u201d</p><p>She whirled away, apologizing. The twine on her parcel snapped. White pages flapped and fluttered into the gusty summer afternoon, like a covey of startled doves.</p><p>\u201cOh no. The music.\u201d</p><p>She made wild sweeps with both hands. A few pages disappeared down the street, and others fell to the cobblestones, quickly trampled by passersby. But the bulk of the parcel landed in the middle of the lane, still wrapped in brown paper. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She made a lunging grab for it, desperate to save what she could.</p><p>\u201cLook sharp!\u201d a man shouted.</p><p>Cartwheels creaked. Somewhere much too near, a horse bucked and whinnied. She looked up from where she\u2019d crouched in the lane to see two windmilling, iron-shoed hooves, big as dinner plates, preparing to demolish her.</p> <p>A woman screamed.</p><p>Kate threw her weight to one side. The horse\u2019s hooves landed just to her left. With a squalling hiss of the brake, a cartwheel screeched to halt\u2014inches from crushing her leg.</p><p>The parcel of sheet music landed some yards distant. Her \u201cplan\u201d was now a mud-stained, wheel-rutted smear on the street.</p><p>\u201cDevil take you,\u201d the driver cursed her from the box, brandishing his horsewhip. \u201cA fine little witch you are. Near overset my whole cart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I\u2019m sorry, sir. It was an accident.\u201d</p> <p>He cracked his whip against the cobblestones. \u201cOut of my way, then. You unnatural little\u2014\u201d</p><p>As he raised his whip for another strike, Kate flinched and ducked.</p><p>No blow came.</p><p>A man stepped between her and the cart. \u201cThreaten her again,\u201d she heard him warn the driver in a low, inhuman growl, \u201cand I will whip the flesh from your miserable bones.\u201d</p><p>Chilling, those words. But effective. The cart swiftly rolled away.</p><p>As strong arms pulled her to her feet, Kate\u2019s gaze climbed a veritable mountain of man. She saw black, polished boots. Buff breeches stretched over granite thighs. A distinctive red wool officer\u2019s coat.</p> <p>Her heart jumped. She knew this coat. She\u2019d probably sewn the brass buttons on these cuffs. This was the uniform of the Spindle Cove militia. She was in familiar arms. She was saved. And when she lifted her head, she was guaranteed to find a friendly face, unless . . .</p><p>\u201cMiss Taylor?\u201d</p><p>Unless.</p><p>Unless it was him.</p><p>\u201cCorporal Thorne,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>On another day, Kate could have laughed at the irony. Of all the men to come to her rescue, it would be this one.</p><p>\u201cMiss Taylor, what the devil are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>At his rough tone, all her muscles pulled tight. \u201cI . . . I came into town to purchase new sheet music for Miss Elliott, and to . . .\u201d She couldn\u2019t bring herself to mention calling on Miss Paringham. \u201cBut I dropped my parcel, and now I\u2019ve missed the stage home. Silly me.\u201d</p> <p>Silly, foolish, shame-marked, unwanted me.</p><p>\u201cAnd now I\u2019m truly stuck, I\u2019m afraid. If only I\u2019d brought a little more money, I could afford a room for the evening, then go back to Spindle Cove tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve no money?\u201d</p><p>She turned away, unable to bear the chastisement in his gaze.</p><p>\u201cWhat were you thinking, traveling all this distance alone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hadn\u2019t any choice.\u201d Her voice caught. \u201cI am completely alone.\u201d</p><p>His grip firmed on her arms. \u201cI\u2019m here. You\u2019re not alone now.\u201d</p><p>Hardly poetry, those words. A simple statement of fact. They scarcely shared the same alphabet as kindness. If true comfort were a nourishing, wholemeal loaf, what he offered her were a few stale crumbs.</p><p>It didn\u2019t matter. It didn\u2019t matter. She was a starving girl, and she hadn\u2019t the dignity to refuse.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d she managed, choking back a sob. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to like this.\u201d</p><p>And with that, Kate fell into his immense, rigid, unwilling embrace\u2014and wept.</p><p>Bloody hell.</p><p>She burst into tears. Right there in the street, for God\u2019s sake. Her lovely face screwed up. She bent forward until her forehead met his chest, and then she heaved a loud, wrenching sob.</p><p>Then a second. And a third.</p><p>His gelding danced sideways, and Thorne shared the beast\u2019s unease. Given a choice between watching Miss Kate Taylor weep and offering his own liver to carrion birds, he would have had his knife out and sharpened before the first tear rolled down her face.</p><p>He clucked his tongue softly, which did some good toward calming the horse. It had no effect on the girl. Her slender shoulders convulsed as she wept into his coat. His hands remained fixed on her arms.</p><p>In a desperate gesture, he slid them up. Then down.</p><p>No help.</p><p>What\u2019s happened? he wanted to ask. Who\u2019s hurt you? Who can I maim or kill for distressing you this way?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said, pulling away after some minutes had passed.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor weeping all over you. Forcing you to hold me. I know you must hate it.\u201d She fished a handkerchief from her sleeve and dabbed at her eyes. Her nose and eyes were red. \u201cI mean, not that you don\u2019t like holding women. Everyone in Spindle Cove knows you like women. I\u2019ve heard far more than I care to hear about your\u2014\u201d</p><p>She paled and stopped talking.</p><p>Just as well.</p><p>He took the horse\u2019s lead in one hand and laid the other hand to Miss Taylor\u2019s back, guiding her out of the street. Once they reached the side of the lane, he looped his horse\u2019s reins about a post and turned his sights toward making her comfortable. There wasn\u2019t anywhere for her to sit. No bench, no crate.</p><p>This disturbed him beyond reason.</p><p>His gaze went to a tavern across the street\u2014the sort of establishment he\u2019d never allow her to enter\u2014but he was seriously considering crossing the lane, toppling the first available drunk off his seat, and dragging the vacated chair out for her. A woman shouldn\u2019t weep while standing. It didn\u2019t seem right.</p><p>\u201cPlease, can\u2019t you just loan me a few shillings?\u201d she asked. \u201cI\u2019ll find an inn for the night, and I won\u2019t trouble you any further.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiss Taylor, I can\u2019t lend you money to pass the night alone in a coaching inn. It\u2019s not safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no choice but to stay. There won\u2019t be another stage back to Spindle Cove until morning.\u201d</p><p>Thorne looked at his gelding. \u201cI\u2019ll hire you a horse, if you can ride.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI never had any lessons.\u201d</p><p>Curse it. How was he going to remedy this situation? He easily had the money to hire another horse, but nowhere near enough coin in his pocket for a private carriage. He could put her up in an inn\u2014but damned if he would let her stay alone.</p><p>A dangerous thought visited him, sinking talons into his mind.</p><p>He could stay with her.</p><p>Not in a tawdry way, he told himself. Just as her protector. He could find a damned place for her to sit down, as a start. He could see that she had food and drink and warm blankets. He could stand watch while she slept and make certain nothing disturbed her. He could be there when she woke.</p><p>After all these months of frustrated longing, maybe that would be enough.</p><p>Enough? Right.</p><p>\u201cGood heavens.\u201d She took a sudden step back.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>Her gaze dropped and she swallowed hard. \u201cSome part of you is moving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not.\u201d Thorne conducted a quick, silent assessment of his personal equipment. He found all to be under regulation. On another occasion\u2014one with fewer tears involved\u2014this degree of closeness would have undoubtedly roused his lust. But today she was affecting him rather higher in his torso. Tying his guts in knots and poking at whatever black, smoking cinder remained of his heart.</p><p>\u201cYour satchel.\u201d She indicated the leather pouch slung crossways over his chest. \u201cIt\u2019s . . . wriggling.\u201d</p><p>Oh. That. In all the commotion, he\u2019d nearly forgotten the creature.</p><p>He reached beneath the leather flap and withdrew the source of the wriggling, holding it up for her to see.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just this.\u201d</p><p>And suddenly everything was different. It was like the whole world took a knock and tilted at a fresh angle. In less time than it took a man\u2019s heart to skip, Miss Taylor\u2019s face transformed. The tears were gone. Her elegant, sweeping eyebrows arched in surprise. Her eyes candled to life\u2014glowed, really, like two stars. Her lips fell apart in a delighted gasp.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She pressed one hand to her cheek. \u201cOh, it\u2019s a puppy.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. Lord, how she smiled. All because of this wriggling ball of snout and fur that was as likely to piss on her slippers as chew them to bits.</p><p>She reached forward. \u201cMay I?\u201d</p><p>As if he could refuse. Thorne placed the pup in her arms.</p><p>She fawned and cooed over it like a baby. \u201cWhere did you come from, sweeting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA farm nearby,\u201d Thorne answered. \u201cThought I\u2019d take him back to the castle. Been needing a hound.\u201d</p><p>She cocked her head and peered at the pup. \u201cIs he a hound?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPartly.\u201d</p><p>Her fingers traced a rust-colored patch over the pup\u2019s right eye. \u201cI\u2019d suppose he\u2019s partly many things, isn\u2019t he? Funny little dear.\u201d</p><p>She lifted the pup in both hands and looked it nose-to-nose, puckering her lips to make a little chirping noise. The dog licked her face.</p><p>Lucky cur.</p><p>\u201cWas that mean Corporal Thorne keeping you in a dark, nasty satchel?\u201d She gave the pup a playful shake. \u201cYou like it so much better out here with me, don\u2019t you? Of course you do.\u201d</p><p>The dog yipped. She laughed and drew it close to her chest, bending over its furry neck.</p><p>\u201cYou are perfect,\u201d he heard her whisper. \u201cYou are just exactly what I needed today.\u201d She stroked the pup\u2019s fur. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Thorne felt a sharp twist in his chest. Like something rusted and bent, shaking loose. This girl had a way of doing that\u2014making him feel. She always had, even years upon years in the past. That long-ago time seemed to fall beyond the reach of her earliest memories. A true mercy for her.</p><p>But Thorne remembered. He remembered it all.</p><p>He cleared his throat. \u201cWe\u2019d best be on the road. It\u2019ll be near dark by the time we reach Spindle Cove.\u201d</p><p>She tore her attention from the dog and gave Thorne a curious glance. \u201cBut how?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll ride with me. The both of you. I\u2019ll take you up on my saddle. You\u2019ll carry the dog.\u201d</p><p>As if consulting all the concerned parties, she turned to the horse. Then to the dog. Lastly, she lifted her gaze to Thorne\u2019s. \u201cYou\u2019re certain we\u2019ll fit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust.\u201d</p><p>She bit her lip, looking unsure.</p><p>Her instinctive resistance to the idea was plain. And understandable. Thorne wasn\u2019t overeager to put his plan into action, either. Three hours astride a horse with Miss Kate Taylor nestled between his thighs? Torture of the keenest sort. But he could see no better way to have her swiftly and safely home.</p><p>He could do this. If he\u2019d lasted a year with her in the same tiny village, he could withstand a few hours\u2019 closeness.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t leave you here,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019ll have to be done.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth quirked in a droll, self-conscious smile. It was reassuring to see, and at the same time devastating.</p><p>\u201cWhen you put it that way, I find myself unable to refuse.\u201d</p><p>For God\u2019s sake, don\u2019t say that.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she added. She laid a gentle touch to his sleeve.</p><p>For your own sake, don\u2019t do that.</p><p>He pulled away from her touch, and she looked hurt. Which made him want to soothe her, but he didn\u2019t dare try.</p><p>\u201cMind the pup,\u201d he said.</p><p>Thorne helped her into the saddle, boosting her at the knee, rather than the thigh, as might have been more efficient. He mounted the gelding, taking the reins in one hand and keeping one arm about her waist. As he nudged the horse into a walk, she fell against him, soft and warm. His thighs bracketed hers.</p><p>Her hair smelled of clover and lemon. The scent rushed all through his senses before he could stop it. Damn, damn, damn. He could discourage her from talking to him, touching him. He could keep her distracted with a dog. But how could he prevent her from being shaped like a woman and smelling like paradise? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Never mind the beatings, the lashings, the years of prison . . .</p><p>Thorne knew, without a doubt, the next three hours would be the harshest punishment of his life.</p><p>Chapter Three</p> <p>The strangest thing happened during their first hour on horseback. Before Kate\u2019s eyes, Corporal Thorne transformed into a completely different man.</p><p>A good-looking one.</p><p>The first time she stole a glance at him, letting her gaze make the slow, perilous climb from his lapel to his face\u2014she found his appearance just as hard and intimidating as ever. The planes of his face were lit with harsh, late afternoon sun. She cringed.</p><p>But then, a few hundred yards farther down the road, she glanced up again as they passed beneath a stand of trees. This time she caught him in profile, and his features were touched with shadow. She fancied him to look . . . not so much forbidding as protective. Strong.</p><p>The wall of heated muscle at her back only reinforced this impression. So did the massive arm braced around her middle and the effortless manner with which he guided his horse. No shouting or flicking the crop\u2014just gentle nudges of his heels and the occasional quiet word. Those words shivered through her bones like cello notes, each one settling to a low, arousing thrum at the base of her spine.</p> <p>She closed her eyes. Deep voices touched her in deep places.</p><p>From that point on she kept her gaze stubbornly trained on the road ahead. Nevertheless, her mental image of Thorne continued to change. In her mind\u2019s eye he went from forbidding and stern, to protective and strong, to . . .</p><p>Handsome.</p><p>Wildly, improbably, outrageously handsome.</p><p>No, no. It just couldn\u2019t be. Her imagination was playing tricks. Kate knew many of the working-class women in Spindle Cove fancied Corporal Thorne, but she\u2019d never understood why. His features just didn\u2019t appeal to her\u2014probably because he was usually employing them to send a frown or a glare in her direction. On those rare occasions when he looked in her direction at all.</p><p>By the time they traveled another few miles, the puppy had fallen asleep in her arms. Kate had rummaged through her many unpleasant encounters with the man and succeeded in reminding herself that she did not find him attractive.</p> <p>One more look, she told herself\u2014just to confirm it.</p><p>But when she did glance up, the worst possible thing happened.</p><p>She found him looking down at her.</p><p>Their gazes locked. The piercing blue of his eyes invaded her being. To her distinct horror, she gasped aloud. And then she hurried to look somewhere, anywhere else.</p><p>Too late.</p><p>His features were seared on her imagination. When she closed her eyes, it was as though the back of her eyelids had been painted with that same intense, transfixing blue. Now the idea came to her that he was perhaps the most handsome man she\u2019d ever seen\u2014an assessment with no rational basis whatsoever. None.</p><p>Kate realized she had a grave problem.</p><p>She was infatuated. Or mildly insane. Possibly both.</p> <p>Mostly, she was miserable. Her heartbeat was a frantic trill, and close as they were situated on this saddle, she knew he must feel it. For God\u2019s sake, he could likely hear it. That racing, prattling beat was spilling all her secrets. She might as well have piped up and said, I am an affection-starved, addle-brained fool who has never, ever been this close to a man.</p><p>Desperate to create some small buffer between them, she straightened her spine and leaned forward.</p><p>Just then the horse stepped into a rut, and Kate lurched perilously to one side. She knew the brief, helpless sensation of falling.</p><p>And then, just as quickly, she was caught.</p><p>Thorne corrected the horse with a flex of both thighs. He pulled on the reins with one hand, and his other arm contracted about her waist. The motions were fluid, strong, and instinctive\u2014as if his whole body were a fist, and he\u2019d gripped her tight with everything.</p><p>\u201cI have you,\u201d he said.</p><p>Yes, he did. He had her so tight and so close, her corset grommets were probably leaving small round marks on his chest.</p><p>\u201cAre we almost there?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>She stifled a plaintive sigh.</p><p>As the sun dipped toward the horizon, they stopped at a turnpike. Kate waited with the puppy while Thorne purchased a tin pail of milk and three loaves of hot, crusty bread from a cottager. She followed him as he carried this picnic out over a stile and onto a nearby slope.</p><p>They sat near one another in meadow ablaze with flowering heather. The fading sunlight touched each tiny purple blossom with orange. Kate folded her shawl into a square, and the puppy circled it several times before settling down to attack its fringe.</p><p>Thorne handed her one of the loaves. \u201cIt\u2019s not much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s perfect.\u201d</p><p>The loaf warmed her hands and made her stomach growl. She broke it in two, releasing a cloud of delicious, yeasty steam.</p><p>As she ate, the bread seemed to fill some of the yawning stupidity inside her. Sensible behavior was a great deal easier to manage on a full stomach. She could almost bear to look at him again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m grateful to you,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not certain I said that earlier, to my shame. But I\u2019m very thankful for your help. I was having the most miserable day of my year, and seeing your face . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cMade it that much worse.\u201d</p><p>She laughed in protest. \u201cNo. I didn\u2019t mean that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs I recall it, you burst into tears.\u201d</p><p>She ducked her chin and gave him a sidelong glance. \u201cCan this be a flash of humor? From the stern, intimidating Corporal Thorne?\u201d</p><p>He said nothing. She watched him feed the puppy scraps of bread dipped in milk.</p><p>\u201cMy goodness,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat will be your next trick, I wonder? A blink? A smile? Don\u2019t laugh, or I may faint dead away.\u201d</p><p>Her tone was one of mild teasing, but she meant every word. She was already suffering these fierce pangs of infatuation on the basis of his looks and strength alone. If he revealed a streak of sharp wit in the bargain, she might be in desperate straits.</p><p>Fortunately for her vulnerable emotions, he responded with his usual absence of charm. \u201cI\u2019m the lieutenant of the Spindle Cove militia in Lord Rycliff\u2019s absence. You\u2019re a resident of Spindle Cove. It was my duty to help you and see you home safe. That\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d she said, \u201cI\u2019m fortunate to fall within the scope of your duty. The mishap with the cart driver truly was my fault. I\u2019d dashed into the lane without looking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened beforehand?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you think something happened beforehand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like you to be that distracted.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s not like you.</p><p>Kate chewed her bread slowly. He was correct, perhaps, but what an odd thing for him to say. He avoided her like a sparrow avoids snow. What right had he to decide what was and wasn\u2019t like her?</p><p>But she had no one else to talk to, and no reason to hide the truth.</p><p>She swallowed her bite of bread and wrapped her arms about her knees. \u201cI went to pay a call on my old schoolmistress. I was hoping to find some information about my origins. My relations.\u201d</p><p>He paused. \u201cAnd did you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. She wouldn\u2019t help me find them, she said, even if she could. Because they don\u2019t want to be found. I\u2019d always believed I was an orphan, but apparently I . . .\u201d She blinked hard. \u201cIt seems I was abandoned. A child of shame, she called me. No one wanted me then, and no one will want me now.\u201d</p><p>They both stared at the horizon, where the oozing egg-yolk sun topped the chalky hills.</p><p>She risked a glance at him. \u201cYou have nothing to say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing fit for a lady\u2019s hearing.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cBut I\u2019m no lady, you see. If I know nothing else of my parentage, I can be certain of that.\u201d</p><p>Kate lived in the same rooming house as all the Spindle Cove ladies, and a few were true friends, like Lady Rycliff or Minerva Highwood, lately the new Viscountess Payne. But many others forgot her when they left. In their minds, she fit the same pigeonhole as governesses and companions. She would do for company in a pinch, but only if no one better was available. Sometimes they wrote to her for a while. If their valises were too full, they gave her their cast-off frocks.</p><p>She touched the muddied skirt of her pink muslin. Ruined, beyond repair.</p><p>At her feet, the puppy had crawled halfway into the milk pail and was happily licking his way back out. Kate reached for the dog, turning him on his back for a playful rub.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re kindred spirits, aren\u2019t we?\u201d she asked the pup. \u201cNo proper homes to speak of. No illustrious pedigrees. We\u2019re both a bit funny-looking.\u201d</p><p>Corporal Thorne made no attempt to contradict her statement. Kate supposed it was what she deserved, going fishing for compliments in a desert.</p><p>\u201cWhat about you, Corporal Thorne? Where were you raised? Have you any family living?\u201d</p><p>He was quiet for an oddly long time, given the straightforward nature of her question.</p><p>\u201cBorn in Southwark, near London. But I haven\u2019t seen the place in almost twenty years.\u201d</p><p>She scanned his face. Despite the gravity in his demeanor, she wouldn\u2019t put him much older than thirty. \u201cYou must have left home quite young.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot so young as some.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow that the war is over, you\u2019ve no desire to go back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone.\u201d His gaze caught hers for a moment. \u201cThe past is better left behind.\u201d</p><p>Point taken, Kate supposed, given the disaster that had been her day. She plucked a long blade of grass and dangled it for the puppy to nip and bat. His long, thin tail whipped back and forth with joy.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean to call him?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Patch, I suppose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s horrible. You can\u2019t call him Patch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not? He has a patch, doesn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and that\u2019s exactly why you can\u2019t call him that.\u201d Kate lowered her voice, gathering the pup close and smoothing the splash of rust-colored fur around his right eye. \u201cHe\u2019ll be self-conscious. I have a patch, but I shouldn\u2019t like to be named for it. It\u2019s not as though I need a reminder it\u2019s there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is different. He\u2019s a dog.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean he has no feelings.\u201d</p><p>Corporal Thorne made a derisive noise. \u201cHe\u2019s a dog.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should call him Rex,\u201d she said, tilting her head. \u201cOr Duke. Or Prince, perhaps.\u201d</p><p>His gaze slid sideways. \u201cWhat about that dog says \u2018royalty\u2019 to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, nothing.\u201d Kate set the pup down and watched him scamper through the heather. \u201cBut that\u2019s the point. You\u2019ll balance his humble origins by giving him a grand-sounding name. It\u2019s called irony, Corporal Thorne. As if I were to call you \u2018Cuddles.\u2019 Or if you were to call me Helen of Troy.\u201d</p><p>He paused and frowned. \u201cWho\u2019s Helen of Troy?\u201d</p><p>Kate almost betrayed her surprise at his question. Fortunately, she caught herself just in time. She had to remind herself that \u201ccorporal\u201d was an enlisted officer\u2019s rank, and most of the army\u2019s enlisted men had only a basic education.</p><p>She explained, \u201cHelen of Troy was a queen in Ancient Greece. They called hers the face that could launch a thousand ships. She was so beautiful, every man wanted her. They fought whole wars.\u201d</p><p>He was quiet for several moments. \u201cSo calling you Helen of . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cHelen of Troy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Helen of Troy.\u201d A small furrow formed between his dark eyebrows. \u201cHow would that be ironic?\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cIsn\u2019t it obvious? Just look at me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am looking at you.\u201d</p><p>Good heavens. Yes, he was. He was looking at her in the same way he did everything. Intensely, and with quiet force. She could all but feel the muscle in his gaze. It unnerved her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Out of habit, she raised her fingers to her birthmark, but at the last moment she used them to sweep locks of hair behind her ear.</p><p>\u201cYou can see for yourself, can\u2019t you? It\u2019s ironic because I\u2019m no legendary beauty. No men are fighting battles over me.\u201d She gave a self-effacing smile. \u201cThat would require at least two men to be interested. I\u2019m three-and-twenty years old, and so far there hasn\u2019t even been one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou live in a village of women.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSpindle Cove\u2019s not entirely women. There are some men. There\u2019s the blacksmith. And the vicar.\u201d</p><p>He dismissed these examples with a gruff sound.</p><p>\u201cWell . . . there\u2019s you,\u201d she said.</p><p>He went stone still.</p><p>So. Now they came to it. She probably shouldn\u2019t have put him on the spot, but then again\u2014he was the one pressing the topic.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s you,\u201d she repeated. \u201cAnd you can scarcely bear to share the same air I breathe. I tried to be friendly, when you first arrived in Spindle Cove. That didn\u2019t go over well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiss Taylor\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd it\u2019s not that you\u2019re uninterested in women. I know you\u2019ve had others.\u201d</p><p>He blinked, and the small motion made her uneasy in her skin. Amazing. His blink had the same effect as another man pounding his palm with his fist.</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s common knowledge,\u201d she said, quietly grinding her toe in the dirt. Digging for courage. \u201cIn the village, your . . . arrangements . . . are the subject of far too much speculation. Even if I don\u2019t want to hear about them, I do.\u201d</p><p>He rose to his feet and began walking toward the road. His massive shoulders were squared, his heavy paces measured. There he went again, walking away. She\u2019d had enough of this. She was tired of shrugging off his rejections, dismissing the wounded feelings with a good-natured laugh.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t you see?\u201d She rose and waded through the heather, hurrying to catch the border of his long, monumental shadow. \u201cThis is exactly what I mean. If I smile in your direction, you turn the other way. If I find a seat toward your end of the room, you decide you\u2019d rather stand. Do I make you itch, Corporal Thorne? Does the scent of my dusting powder make you sneeze? Or is there something in my demeanor that you find loathsome or terrifying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be absurd.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen admit it. You avoid me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well.\u201d He drew to a stop. \u201cI avoid you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow tell me why.\u201d</p><p>He turned to face her, and his ice-blue eyes burned into hers. But he didn\u2019t say a word.</p><p>Kate\u2019s breath left her lungs in a sigh, and her shoulders fell. \u201cCome along,\u201d she coaxed. \u201cSay it. It\u2019s all right. After all these years, I think it would be a mercy to hear someone speak the truth. Just be honest.\u201d</p><p>In an impulsive move, she reached for his hand and brought it to her face, touching his fingertips to her birthmark. He tried pull back, but she wouldn\u2019t let him escape. If she had to live with this mark every day, he could bear to touch it just this once.</p> <p>She stepped closer, pressing her pigment-stained temple to his palm. His hand was cool.</p><p>She said, \u201cThis is the reason. Isn\u2019t it? The reason you don\u2019t take an interest. The reason no men take an interest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiss Taylor, I\u2014\u201d His jaw tensed. \u201cNo. It isn\u2019t like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what is it?\u201d</p><p>No reply.</p><p>Her face burned. She wanted to beat at his chest, crack him open. \u201cWhat is it? For God\u2019s sake, what is it about me you find so intolerable? So wretchedly unbearable you can\u2019t even stand to be in the same room?\u201d</p><p>He muttered an oath. \u201cStop provoking me. You won\u2019t like the answer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to hear it anyhow.\u201d</p><p>He plunged one hand into her hair, startling a gasp from her lips. Strong fingers curled to cup the back of her head. His eyes searched her face, and every nerve ending in her body crackled with tension. The sinking sun threw a last flare of red-orange light between them, setting the moment ablaze.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s this.\u201d</p><p>With a flex of his arm, he pulled her into a kiss.</p><p>And he kissed her the way he did everything. Intensely, and with quiet force. His lips pressed firm against hers, demanding a response.</p><p>Acting out of pure instinct, Kate shoved at his chest. \u201cRelease me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will. But not yet.\u201d</p><p>His grip kept her immobile. She had no escape.</p><p>Nevertheless, she didn\u2019t fear him. No, she feared whatever was rapidly filling the space between them. The raw hunger in his eyes. This heat welling between their bodies. The sudden heaviness in her limbs, her abdomen, her breasts. The mad acceleration of her pulse. The air around them seemed charged with intent. And not all of it was on his side.</p><p>He bent to kiss her again, and this time her instincts were different.</p><p>She stretched to meet him halfway.</p><p>When his strong lips touched hers, she went soft everywhere. He pulled her close, wrapping his other arm about her waist. She didn\u2019t even try to resist. The voice of her conscience went mute, and her eyelids fluttered in exquisite surrender. She sighed into the kiss. A shameless confession of longing.</p><p>His lips were so warm. And for all his cool, stony appearance, he tasted delicious and comforting. Like freshly baked bread, mixed with some faint memory of bitters by the pint. She had a vision of him earlier that day, drinking in a dimly lit tavern. Alone. The poignant solitude of that image made her want to hold him. She had to settle for clutching his coat lapels, nestling close to his chest.</p><p>She let her lips fall apart, the better to breathe him in. He caught her top lip between his, then sipped at the lower. As though he craved the taste of her, too.</p><p>He brushed firm kisses to the corner of her mouth, her jaw, the pounding pulse in her throat. Each press of his lips was swift and strong. She could feel each kiss\u2019s imprint linger like a fiery brand on her skin. He was marking her with stamps of his approval.</p><p>Her passion-swelled mouth . . . Wanted.</p><p>Her softly arching neck . . . Desired.</p><p>The sweep of her cheekbone . . . Lovely.</p><p>And last\u2014the wine-splashed mark at her temple . . . Sweet.</p><p>His kiss lingered there for several moments. His breath moved in and out, stirring her hair. Standing like this, pressed so close to him, she could feel the barely restrained power coursing through his body. His whole being shuddered with palpable desire.</p><p>Then he pulled away.</p><p>She clung to his coat, dizzied. \u201cI\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be concerned. That won\u2019t happen again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why did it happen in the first place?\u201d</p><p>He put a single fingertip under her chin, tilting her face to his. \u201cDon\u2019t ever\u2014ever\u2014think no man wants you. That\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s all?</p><p>She stared up at the hardened, handsome, impossible man. He would kiss her at sunset in a field of heather, make her feel beautiful and desired, set her whole body throbbing with sensation . . . only to set her back on her feet and say, \u201cThat\u2019s all\u201d?</p><p>His weight shifted, as though he would retreat.</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d She tightened her grip and held him in place. \u201cWhat if I want more?\u201d</p><p>Chapter Four</p><p>More.</p><p>Thorne braced himself. That word shook the ground beneath him. He could have sworn the hillside rolled and swayed.</p><p>More. What did it mean to her, that word? Certainly something different from the visions his own mind supplied. He saw the two of them, tangled in the heather and the rucked-up muslin of her skirts. This was why he sought out experienced women who shared his definition of \u201cmore\u201d\u2014and had no qualms about telling him exactly when and where and how often they\u2019d like it.</p><p>But Miss Taylor was a lady, no matter how she denied it. She was innocent, young, given to foolish dreaming. He cringed to imagine what \u201cmore\u201d meant in her mind. Sweet words? Courting? A vinegar jar had more sweetness in it than he did. His experience with courting had been limited to courting danger.</p><p>That wrongheaded kiss had been just one more example.</p><p>Stupid, stupid. His own mother had said it best. Your head\u2019s as thick as it is ugly, boy. You never will learn.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t just walk away from me,\u201d she said. \u201cNot after a kiss like that. We need to talk.\u201d</p><p>Brilliant. This was worse than sweetness, more fraught with danger than courting. She wanted talking.</p><p>Why couldn\u2019t a woman let an action speak for itself? If he\u2019d wanted to use words, he would have used them.</p><p>\u201cWe have nothing to discuss,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cOh, I beg to differ.\u201d</p><p>Thorne stared at her, considering. He\u2019d spent the better part of a decade on campaign with the British infantry. He knew when his best option was retreat.</p><p>He turned and whistled for the dog. The pup bounded to his side. Thorne was pleased. He\u2019d been divided as to whether to leave him with the breeder so long, but the extra weeks of training seemed to have paid off.</p><p>He walked toward the place where he\u2019d left the horse grazing, near a wooden stile that served as the only gap in the field\u2019s waist-high stone border.</p><p>Miss Taylor followed him. \u201cCorporal Thorne . . .\u201d</p><p>He vaulted the stile, putting the fence between them. \u201cWe need to get back to Spindle Cove. You\u2019ve missed lessons with the Youngfield sisters this evening. They\u2019ll be wondering where you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know my schedule of lessons?\u201d Her voice carried an interested lilt.</p><p>He cursed under his breath. \u201cNot all of them. Just the irritating ones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. The irritating ones.\u201d</p><p>He tossed the pup a scrap of rabbit hide from his pocket, then began checking over the horse\u2019s tack.</p><p>She placed both hands on the evenly mortared top of the stone fence and boosted herself to sit atop it. \u201cSo my lessons and your drinking sessions just happen to coincide. At the same times and on the same days, to the point that you know my schedule. By heart.\u201d</p><p>For God\u2019s sake. What heart?</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cDon\u2019t tell yourself some sentimental story of how I\u2019ve been pining for you. You\u2019re a fetching enough woman, and I\u2019m a man with eyes. I\u2019ve noticed. That\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>She gathered her skirts in one hand, lifted her legs, and swung them to his side of the fence. \u201cAnd yet you\u2019ve never said a word.\u201d</p><p>With her sitting on the stone wall, they were almost equal in height. She crooked one finger and swept a curling lock of hair behind her ear\u2014in that graceful, unthinking way women had of pushing men to the brink of desperation.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a smoothly spoken man. If I put my wants into words, I\u2019d have you blushing so hard your frock would turn a deeper shade of pink.\u201d</p><p>There. That ought to scare her off.</p><p>She colored slightly. But she didn\u2019t back down.</p><p>\u201cDo you know what I think?\u201d she said. \u201cI think that maybe\u2014just maybe\u2014all your stern, forbidding behavior is some strange, male form of modesty. A way to deflect notice. I\u2019m almost ashamed to say it worked on me for the better part of a year, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally, Miss Taylor\u2014\u201d</p><p>She met his gaze. \u201cBut I\u2019m paying close attention now.\u201d</p><p>Damn. So she was.</p><p>He\u2019d been avoiding precisely this for a year now\u2014the possibility that she\u2019d someday catch sight of him in church or the tavern, hold that glance a beat longer than usual, and then . . . remember everything. He couldn\u2019t let that happen. If Miss Kate Taylor, as she existed now, were ever connected with the den of squalor and sin that had served as her cradle, it could destroy everything for her. Her reputation, her livelihood, her happiness.</p><p>So he\u2019d stayed away. Not an easy task, when the village was so small and this girl\u2014who wasn\u2019t a girl anymore, but an alluring woman\u2014had her toes in every corner of it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And then today . . .</p><p>A year\u2019s worth of avoidance and intimidation, all shot to hell in one afternoon, thank to that wrongheaded, stupid, goddamned glorious kiss.</p><p>\u201cLook at me.\u201d</p> <p>He leaned forward and braced his hands on the stone wall, confronting her face-to-face. Daring her; daring fate. If she was ever going to recognize him, it would be now.</p><p>As she took him in, he did some looking of his own. He drank in the small details he\u2019d denied himself for long months. Her sweet pink frock, with ivory ribbons threaded through the neckline like little dollops of confectioner\u2019s icing. The tiny freckle on her chest, just below her right collarbone. The brave set of her jaw, and the way her pink lips crooked fetchingly at the corners.</p><p>Then he searched those clever, lovely hazel eyes for any hint of awareness or flash of recognition.</p><p>Nothing.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know me,\u201d he said. Both a statement and a question.</p> <p>She shook her head. Then she spoke what were quite possibly the most foolish, improbable words he\u2019d ever heard. \u201cBut I think I\u2019d like to.\u201d</p><p>He gripped that stone wall as if it were the edge of a precipice.</p><p>She said, \u201cPerhaps we could\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. We couldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t finish my thought.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter. Whatever you meant to suggest, it won\u2019t happen.\u201d He pushed off the wall and gathered his gelding\u2019s lead, loosing it from the stile.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to talk to me sometime. We do live in the same tiny village.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot for long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m leaving Spindle Cove.\u201d</p><p>She paused. \u201cWhat? When?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a month\u2019s time.\u201d A month too late, it would seem.</p><p>\u201cAre you being reassigned?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m leaving the army. And England. That\u2019s what I was doing in Hastings today. I\u2019ve booked passage to America on a merchant ship.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy.\u201d Her hands fell to her lap. \u201cAmerica.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe war\u2019s over. Lord Rycliff\u2019s helping me arrange for an honorable discharge. I\u2019ve a wish to own some land.\u201d</p><p>She moved as though she\u2019d hop down from the wall. By reflex, he took her by the waist, slowly lowering her to the ground.</p><p>Once there, she showed no inclination to leave his embrace.</p><p>\u201cBut we\u2019re only just getting to know one another,\u201d she said.</p><p>Oh, no. This stopped right here and now. She didn\u2019t truly want him. She was overwrought from the day, clinging to the only soul in reach.</p><p>\u201cMiss Taylor, we kissed. Once. It was a mistake. It won\u2019t happen again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you certain?\u201d She laced her arms around his neck.</p><p>He froze, stunned by the intent he read in her eyes.</p><p>Sweet merciful God. The girl meant to kiss him.</p><p>He could tell the exact moment she dared herself to do it. Her gaze lingered on his lips, and he heard her sharp intake of breath. She stretched up, and as her lips neared his, he marveled over every fraction of an instant in which she didn\u2019t change her mind and turn away.</p><p>Her eyelids slipped shut. He might have closed his eyes, too, but he couldn\u2019t.</p><p>This, he needed to see to believe.</p><p>She pressed her lips to his, just as the last wash of sunlight ebbed. And the world became a place he didn\u2019t recognize.</p><p>She smelled so good. Not just pleasant, but good. Pure. Those light hints of clover and citrus were the essence of clean. He felt washed by that scent. He could almost imagine that he\u2019d never lied, never stolen, never shivered in prison. Never marched into battle, never bled. That he hadn\u2019t killed four men at distances so intimate, he could still recall the colors of their eyes. Brown, blue, another blue, then green.</p><p>This is wrong.</p><p>A dark growl rumbled in his chest. He kept his hands on her waist, but he fanned his fingers wide.</p><p>His thumbs skimmed upward, skipping from rib to rib until they just grazed the soft undersides of her breasts. With the little finger of each hand, he touched the gentle flare of her hip. His hand span was stretched to its limits. This was as much of her as he could possibly hold.</p><p>He needed every bit of that leverage to push her away.</p><p>When they broke apart, she gazed up at him. Waiting.</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have done that,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to. Does that make me loose?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It makes you soft in the head. Young ladies like you don\u2019t pass time with men like me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMen like you? You mean the sort of men who rescue helpless young ladies in the street and carry puppies in their satchels?\u201d She gave a playful shiver. \u201cLord preserve me from men like you.\u201d</p><p>A timid smile played at the corner of her mouth. He wanted to devour it. To catch her in his arms and teach her the consequences of teasing a fiercely lusting, barely civilized beast.</p><p>But saving this girl was the one decent thing he\u2019d done in all his life. Some nineteen years ago, he\u2019d sold the last bits of his own innocence to purchase hers. He\u2019d be damned if he\u2019d ruin her now.</p><p>With firm motions, he unlaced her arms from around his neck. He held her by the wrists, making his hands tight as manacles.</p><p>She gasped.</p><p>\u201cHave a care for yourself, Miss Taylor. I\u2019ll take blame for the kiss. It was a liberty and my mistake. I let a carnal impulse distract me from my duty. But if you\u2019re imagining tender feelings on my side, they\u2019re just that\u2014imaginings.\u201d</p><p>She twisted in his grip. \u201cYou\u2019re frightening me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d he said evenly. \u201cYou should be scared. I\u2019ve killed more men than you\u2019ll kiss in your lifetime. You don\u2019t want anything to do with me, and I don\u2019t feel a damned thing for you.\u201d</p><p>He released her wrists. \u201cI\u2019m finished discussing it.\u201d</p><p>He was finished discussing it.</p><p>Kate only wished she were finished living it.</p><p>Sadly, she had another two hours on horseback in which to recline, mortified, against his chest and savor her full humiliation. What a horrid, horrid day.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t used to riding horseback. As the miles wore on, her muscles began to knot. Her backside hurt as though it had been paddled. And her pride . . . oh, her pride smarted something fierce.</p><p>What was wrong with the man? Kissing her, telling her he wanted her, and then so callously pushing her away? After living with his standoffish treatment for an entire year, she supposed she should have known better. But today she\u2019d fancied that maybe she\u2019d found his hidden emotional side. Perhaps, she\u2019d thought, the hardened beast had a tender underbelly\u2014a soft spot, just for her. She couldn\u2019t resist giving it a poke.</p><p>He\u2019d all but snapped her finger off.</p><p>So mortifying. How could she have misread his intentions so completely? She should have refused his offer of a ride home and spent the night singing for pennies in the Hastings streets instead. It would have been less degrading.</p><p>I don\u2019t feel a damned thing for you.</p><p>The only consolation was that he\u2019d be leaving Spindle Cove in a matter of weeks, and she need never speak to him again.</p><p>Erasing him from her thoughts would be a more difficult trick. No matter how long she lived, this man would always be her first kiss. Or worse, her only kiss.</p><p>The cruel, teasing ogre.</p><p>Eventually they reached familiar bends in the road. The scattered amber lights of the village appeared on the horizon, just below the silvery stars.</p><p>Kate had a quiet laugh at her own expense. She\u2019d left the village early this morning with a heart full of foolish hopes and dreams. Tonight, she returned with her spine wilted from six kinds of humiliation and her arms full of mongrel dog.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re still taking suggestions, I\u2019d name him Badger,\u201d she said when the silence became too much. \u201cIt suits him, I think. He\u2019s all nose and teeth and tussle.\u201d</p><p>His reply was a long time in coming. \u201cCall the pup whatever you wish.\u201d</p><p>She bent her head and nuzzled the dog\u2019s fur. \u201cBadger,\u201d she whispered, worrying the soft flap of his ear, \u201cyou\u2019d never spurn my kisses, would you?\u201d</p><p>The pup licked her fingertip. She blinked away a silly tear.</p><p>As they neared the church and the heart of the village, she looked to the Queen\u2019s Ruby. Lights burned in nearly every window. The sight kindled a warm glow in her heart. Badger\u2019s tail began to wag, as if he sensed the lift in her spirits. She did have friends, and they were waiting up for her.</p><p>Thorne helped her dismount and loosed the horse to graze on the village green.</p><p>\u201cDo you plan to come in and eat something?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He shrugged back into his coat. \u201cThat\u2019s a bad idea. You know there\u2019s talk about me. I\u2019m bringing you home well after dark. Your frock\u2019s torn, and your hair\u2019s a shambles.\u201d</p><p>She cringed at the blow to what remained of her vanity. \u201cMy hair is a shambles? Since when? You might have said something.\u201d</p><p>Tucking Badger under one arm, she plucked at her hairpins with her free hand. His concern for appearances wasn\u2019t unfounded. Small villages were buzzing hives of gossip. She knew she must keep her reputation unsoiled if she wanted to continue living in the Queen\u2019s Ruby and tutoring the gently bred ladies who summered there.</p><p>\u201cJust give the dog here, Miss Taylor, and I\u2019ll be on my way.\u201d</p><p>In an instinctive reaction, she hugged the puppy close to her chest. \u201cNo. No, I don\u2019t think I will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe get along, he and I. So I\u2019m going to keep him. I believe he\u2019d be happier that way.\u201d</p><p>The severity of his frown seemed to slice through the darkness. \u201cYou can\u2019t keep a puppy in a rooming house. Your landlady won\u2019t allow it, and even if she would\u2014a dog like that needs space to run.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe also needs love. Affection, Corporal Thorne. Are you telling me you can provide it?\u201d She playfully tugged at Badger\u2019s scruff. \u201cTell me right now that you love this dog, and I will return the pup at once.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer her.</p><p>\u201cFour little words,\u201d she taunted. \u201c \u2018I . . . love . . . the . . . dog.\u2019 And he\u2019s yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI own the dog,\u201d he said tersely. \u201cHe is mine. I paid coin for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll pay you back. But I will not surrender this sweet, defenseless little creature to a man with no feeling, no heart. No capacity to care.\u201d</p><p>Just then the front door of the Queen\u2019s Ruby burst open.</p><p>Mrs. Nichols came running out from the inn\u2014as much as the poor old dear could run. Her hands were flapping. \u201cMiss Taylor! Miss Taylor, oh, thank goodness you\u2019re here at last.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry to have worried you, Mrs. Nichols. I missed the stagecoach home, and Corporal Thorne was good enough to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been waiting and waiting.\u201d The older woman put her arm through Kate\u2019s and pulled her toward the door. \u201cYour visitors have been here for hours. I\u2019ve run through three pots of tea, exhausted all possible topics of conversation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVisitors?\u201d Kate was stunned. \u201cI have visitors?\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Nichols gathered her shawl about her shoulders. \u201cFour of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFour of them? Whatever do they want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey won\u2019t say. Except that they\u2019ve insisted on waiting for you. It\u2019s been hours now.\u201d</p><p>Kate paused in the threshold, scraping the mud from the soles of her boots. She couldn\u2019t imagine who these visitors might be. Perhaps a family seeking music lessons. But at this hour of night? \u201cI\u2019m so sorry I\u2019ve put you to such trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a trouble, dear. It\u2019s an honor to have a man of such rank and stature in my parlor.\u201d</p><p>A man? Of rank and stature?</p><p>\u201cMight I just nip upstairs and see to my appearance first? I\u2019m all mussed from the road.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo, no. That won\u2019t do, my dear.\u201d The inn\u2019s landlady tugged her inside. \u201cOne can only keep a marquess waiting so long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA marquess?\u201d</p><p>While Mrs. Nichols closed the door, Kate turned to catch her reflection in the looking glass. She jumped in her skin when she found herself nose-to-button with Corporal Thorne instead.</p> <p>\u201cI thought you weren\u2019t coming in,\u201d she accused his lapel.</p><p>\u201cI changed my mind.\u201d When she finally dared look up, she found his eyes narrowed in suspicion. He asked, \u201cDo you know any marquess?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cThe highest-ranking man I know is Lord Rycliff, and he\u2019s an earl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go in with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure that\u2019s not necessary. It\u2019s a parlor, not a crime den.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll go anyway.\u201d</p><p>Before they could argue it further, Kate found herself being hustled into the parlor. Thorne followed close behind. Several of the rooming-house guests lined the corridor. They gave her wide-eyed, speculative glances as she moved past.</p><p>When they reached the parlor, Mrs. Nichols pushed Kate through the door. \u201cHere\u2019s Miss Taylor at last, my lord and ladies.\u201d</p><p>With that, the landlady shut them in. Kate could hear her on the other side of the door, chasing the residents away from the corridor.</p><p>There seemed to be a dozen guests in the parlor, though a quick count assured Kate they numbered just four. Wealth and elegance crammed the room. And here she stood in a torn, dirt-streaked frock. Her hair wasn\u2019t even pinned.</p><p>A dark-clad gentleman rose to his feet and bowed. Kate had barely managed a slight dip of a curtsy when a loud, collective gasp nearly guttered the candles.</p> <p>\u201cIt is her. It must be her.\u201d</p><p>Kate swallowed hard. \u201cEr . . . I must be who?\u201d</p><p>A pretty young woman rose from a chair. She looked a few years younger than Kate, and she wore a frock of spotless, snowy muslin and an embroidered jade-green shawl. As she came to the center of the room, her expression was one of pure wonderment. She regarded Kate as one might a ghost, or a rare species of orchid.</p><p>\u201cIt must be you.\u201d The girl raised her hand and stretched two fingertips to the birthmark at Kate\u2019s temple.</p><p>Kate flinched out of instinct. She\u2019d already been called a witch and a child of shame for that mark today.</p><p>Now she found herself wrapped in a warm, impulsive hug.</p><p>Caught between the two of them, Badger yipped.</p><p>\u201cOh, dear.\u201d Kate pulled back, flashing an apologetic smile. \u201cI\u2019d forgotten him.\u201d</p> <p>The young woman in front of her laughed and smiled. \u201cThe pup is right to object. Where are my manners? Let\u2019s begin again. Introductions first.\u201d She stuck out her hand. \u201cI\u2019m Lark Gramercy. How do you do?\u201d</p><p>Kate clasped the proffered hand. \u201cDelighted, I\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>Lark turned and indicated her companions in turn. \u201cHere we have my sister Harriet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarry,\u201d the woman in question said. She rose from her chair and pumped Kate\u2019s hand firmly. \u201cEveryone calls me Harry.\u201d</p><p>Kate tried not to stare. Harriet, or Harry, was the most stunningly beautiful woman she\u2019d ever seen. Without a trace of adornment in the form of rouge or jewels, her face was a symphony of perfection: pale, luminous skin, wide eyes, wine-red lips. A small beauty mark on one cheekbone added a sultry punctuation to the sweep of her dark eyelashes. She wore her jet-black hair parted to the side and pulled back in a severe chignon that emphasized the swannish curve of her neck. And despite all her classic feminine beauty, she was dressed in what seemed to be men\u2019s attire. A chemisette with hardly any frill at the neck, a waistcoat cut in the style most gentlemen wore, and\u2014most shocking of all\u2014a divided skirt of gray wool, hemmed several inches too short for modesty.</p><p>Good heavens. Kate could see the woman\u2019s ankles.</p><p>\u201cMy brother Bennett is off traveling the Hindu Kush, and our other sister, Calista, is married and living up North. But we have with us Aunt Marmoset.\u201d Lark patted the shoulder of a seated woman in her later years.</p><p>Kate blinked. \u201cI\u2019ve heard you wrong. I thought you said Aunt\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarmoset. Yes.\u201d Lark smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s properly Millicent, but as a child, I could never pronounce it. It always came out Marmoset, and the name just stuck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI resemble the name more every year,\u201d Aunt Marmoset said good-naturedly.</p><p>\u201cYes, old dear,\u201d said Harry dryly. \u201cI was just complaining the other day, if I have to pluck you down from one more tree\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, hush. I meant I\u2019m small and spry and infectiously adorable.\u201d The diminutive older woman stretched a bony hand toward Kate. Her grip was warmer and stronger than Kate would have expected. \u201cIt\u2019s remarkable to see you, child.\u201d</p><p>Before Kate could puzzle out the old woman\u2019s meaning, Lark was making her final introduction.</p><p>\u201cAnd this is our brother Evan. Lord Drewe.\u201d</p><p>Kate turned to the gentleman standing near the window. The marquess, she presumed.</p><p>Lord Drewe made a deep, formal bow, which she tried to repay with her best curtsy. Here was a man, as they said, in his prime of life. Handsome, assured, worldly, and though he was doubtless responsible for hundreds, if not thousands, of tenants and dependents, he appeared to be in command of no one more than himself.</p><p>Kate found herself rather awed in his presence. She could understand Mrs. Nichols\u2019s excitement now.</p><p>\u201cThe ancestral home is in Derbyshire. But we have a property over near Kenmarsh,\u201d Lark explained. \u201cIt\u2019s called Ambervale. Just a cottage, really. We\u2019ve been summering there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a pleasure to meet you all.\u201d Kate dropped into a chair so the marquess might be seated. \u201cAnd you\u2019ve come to Spindle Cove for . . . ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor you, Miss Taylor,\u201d Lark said, taking a seat nearby. \u201cNaturally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Were you wanting music lessons? I offer instruction in voice, pianoforte, harp . . .\u201d</p><p>All the Gramercys laughed.</p><p>Behind her, Thorne cleared his throat. \u201cMiss Taylor has had a long day. Surely your business can wait for the morning.\u201d</p><p>Lord Drewe nodded. \u201cYour concern is duly noted, Mister . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cThorne.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCorporal Thorne,\u201d Kate put in. \u201cHe\u2019s in charge of our local militia.\u201d</p><p>She might have embellished the introduction, she supposed. He\u2019s good friends with the Earl of Rycliff, or He served honorably on the Peninsula under Wellington. But she wasn\u2019t feeling particularly charitable toward him at the moment.</p><p>She lifted Badger. \u201cHe gave me a puppy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd it\u2019s a lovely puppy,\u201d Aunt Marmoset cooed.</p><p>Lark clapped her hands with impatience. \u201cCorporal Thorne is right. It\u2019s ungodly late. Harry, just show her the painting.\u201d</p><p>Harry rose and came forward, bearing a rectangular, paper-wrapped parcel.</p><p>As her sister removed the paper covering, Lark chattered away. \u201cI needed a summer project, you see. Ambervale is quiet, and I do go a bit mad without something to occupy my hands. So I decided to go through the attic. Just old crockery, mostly. A few moldering books. But tucked back under the rafters, I found this canvas wrapped in a tarpaulin.\u201d Her voice pitched with excitement. \u201cOh, do hurry, Harry.\u201d</p><p>Harry continued at the same pace. \u201cSettle your feathers, pigeon.\u201d</p><p>At last she had the thing unwrapped and held it up in the lamplight.</p><p>Kate gasped. \u201cOh my Lord.\u201d</p><p>She clapped a hand over her mouth, horrified by her accidental blasphemy. Cursing, in front of a marquess?</p><p>The Gramercys didn\u2019t seem perturbed, however. They all sat quite calmly and quietly as Harry revealed a painting of a reclining, flagrantly nude woman tangled in white bedsheets and a red velvet counterpane. Swollen, ruby-tipped breasts rested like twin pillows atop a rotund, creamy belly. The woman in the portrait was obviously pregnant.</p><p>And she looked like Kate. She looked a great deal like Kate, save for some differences about the eyes and chin, and the absence of any birthmark. The resemblance was uncanny, disturbing, and readily apparent to everyone in the room.</p><p>\u201cOh my Lord,\u201d Kate breathed.</p><p>Lark beamed. \u201cIsn\u2019t it gorgeous? When we found it, we just knew we had to search you out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPut that away.\u201d Thorne stepped forward. \u201cIt\u2019s vile.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI beg your pardon,\u201d Harry replied, proudly propping the nude painting on the mantelpiece and standing back to admire it. \u201cThe female form is beautiful in all its natural states. This is art.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPut it away,\u201d Thorne repeated in a low, threatening tone. \u201cOr I will make it kindling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s just being protective,\u201d Aunt Marmoset said. \u201cI think it\u2019s sweet. A little savage, but sweet.\u201d</p><p>Harry yanked Lark\u2019s jade-green shawl from her shoulders and draped it over half the painting, obscuring most of the nudity. \u201cThis backward little village. Philistines, all. When we showed it to the vicar, he developed a stammer and visible hives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou . . .\u201d Kate swallowed hard, staring at the painting now boldly displayed above the fire. \u201cYou showed this to the vicar?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut of course,\u201d Lark replied. \u201cThat\u2019s how we found you.\u201d</p><p>Kate crossed her arms over her chest, feeling unaccountably exposed. She leaned forward and peered at the face of the woman in the painting. \u201cBut it can\u2019t be me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Miss Taylor. It\u2019s not you.\u201d With a long-suffering sigh, Lord Drewe stood and addressed his siblings. \u201cYou\u2019re making a right hash of this, I hope you know. If she wants nothing to do with us after tonight, you\u2019ll have only yourselves to blame.\u201d</p><p>What on earth could he mean? Kate\u2019s brain made a lazy twirl in her skull.</p><p>The corporal addressed the room in a deep, commanding voice. \u201cI\u2019m giving you one more minute to start making sense. Otherwise, I don\u2019t care if you are lords and ladies\u2014you\u2019ll be leaving. Miss Taylor\u2019s under my protection, and I won\u2019t have her treated ill.\u201d</p><p>Lord Drewe turned to Kate. \u201cI\u2019ll make this brief. As my youngest sister has attempted to explain, I am the much-beleaguered head of this traveling circus. And we\u2019ve been waiting for you, Miss Taylor, because we believe you may be a part of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI beg your pardon,\u201d she said. \u201cA part of what, precisely?\u201d</p><p>He gestured with one hand, as though it should be obvious. \u201cA part of the family.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Five</p><p>The room swam in Kate\u2019s vision. Badger scampered to the floor, and she made no effort to stop him. All around her, the Gramercys argued.</p><p>\u201cI told you we shouldn\u2019t have sprung it on her this way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been sprung on us all. It wasn\u2019t as though we knew, starting out this morning . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, dear. She\u2019s so pale.\u201d</p><p>They were such a . . . such a family. Kate could scarcely believe that she might be a part of it. The temptation to hope was so great, and optimism came to her too easily. But she didn\u2019t want to make a fool of herself. She had to make some sense of this first.</p><p>While the rest of them talked, Aunt Marmoset came and sat next to her. She pulled a small, paper-wrapped candy from her pocket. \u201cHave a spice drop, dear.\u201d</p><p>Kate accepted it numbly.</p><p>\u201cGo on,\u201d the old woman urged. \u201cEat it now.\u201d</p><p>Uncertain how to refuse, Kate unwrapped the sweet and popped the hard lozenge into her mouth.</p><p>Oh . . . blazes.</p><p>Her eyes watered instantly. The disc of pure, sugared fire burned on her tongue. It took everything she had not to spit it out.</p><p>\u201cStrong, isn\u2019t it? A bit overwhelming at first. But with patience, and a bit of work, you\u2019ll arrive at the sweetness.\u201d Aunt Marmoset patted Kate\u2019s arm. \u201cThis family\u2019s like that.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Then the old woman sharply addressed the room. \u201cAll of you, be calm.\u201d</p><p>They were all of them instantly calm. Even the one who was a marquess.</p><p>\u201cThe only way to tell this is as a story, I think.\u201d Aunt Marmoset\u2019s papery, age-spotted hand clasped Kate\u2019s. \u201cOnce, there was a man named Simon Gramercy, the young Marquess of Drewe. Like all Gramercys, he tended toward tempestuous, inappropriate passions. Simon\u2019s particular interests were art, and the charms of a highly unsuitable girl. The daughter of a tenant farmer from his Derbyshire estate, can you imagine?\u201d</p> <p>Kate shook her head, her tongue still puckered around the evil spice drop.</p><p>\u201cSimon\u2019s mother, the dowager, was scandalized. The girl\u2019s parents disowned her. But Simon would hear no censure. He set up a love nest with his muse at Ambervale. They lived ensconced there for several months, merrily painting and posing and making passionate\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAunt Marmoset.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally, after the portrait, I don\u2019t think it can come as a shock.\u201d The older woman continued, \u201cAnyhow, poor Simon\u2019s health took an ill turn. The next the family heard of him, he was dead. Suddenly, tragically, dead. And no one knew what had become of the farmer\u2019s daughter. She seemed to have vanished completely. Perhaps she\u2019d taken ill, as well . . . Perhaps she\u2019d gone on to be another man\u2019s muse. No one could guess. The title passed to Simon\u2019s cousin, my brother-in-law. And then, on his death, to Evan.\u201d She waved in Lord Drewe\u2019s direction.</p><p>\u201cAre you confused yet?\u201d Lark asked.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll draw you a chart later,\u201d said Harry.</p><p>Kate stared at the painting. \u201cWe do look rather alike, I\u2019ll admit, but I\u2019m only twenty-three. And I have this.\u201d She raised her hand to her birthmark.</p><p>\u201cOh, but that\u2019s a family trait,\u201d Lark said. \u201cSeveral of the Gramercys have something like it. Harry has only the small beauty mark, and most of mine is covered by my hair. Evan\u2019s is behind his ear. Show her, Evan.\u201d</p><p>Lord Drewe gamely turned to display the side of his neck. Yes, he did have a port-wine mark that disappeared beneath his crisp, immaculate cravat.</p><p>\u201cIs it making sense now?\u201d Lark asked. \u201cWhen we found this painting in the attic, we knew she must be Simon\u2019s lover. But no one ever knew she was pregnant. The question was, what became of the child?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDead, we assumed,\u201d Harry said. \u201cOtherwise we surely would have heard something. But Lark couldn\u2019t resist the chance to investigate.\u201d</p> <p>Lark smiled. \u201cI do love a mystery. If the babe had been born from Ambervale, we knew some record of the birth ought to exist. So we went to the local parish, but there we learned that the church had burned in 1782 and not been rebuilt for a decade. Some sort of accident with a censer and a tapestry . . .\u201d</p><p>Lord Drewe cleared his throat. \u201cKeep to essentials, Lark. For Miss Taylor\u2019s sake.\u201d</p><p>Lark nodded. \u201cSo there were no records. During those years, the parish was divided between the three neighboring churches. We decided to make family outings, visiting one per week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly in this family,\u201d said Harry, \u201cwould we consider it high entertainment to go searching musty parish registers for a stillborn cousin.\u201d</p><p>Lark ignored her sister. \u201cWe started at St. Francis, the closest. No luck there. This week was a choice between St. Anthony in the Glen and St. Mary of the Martyrs. I must admit, I was lobbying for St. Anthony\u2019s, because I liked the pastoral sound of it, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut our resident martyr had his way, and St. Mary\u2019s it was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, thank goodness. The book, Evan?\u201d</p><p>Lord Drewe withdrew a large volume that looked to be a well-thumbed parish register. Kate was surprised he would have been allowed to remove it from the church. But then, he likely paid the vicar\u2019s living. She supposed any requests from the local marquess would be difficult to deny.</p> <p>He opened it to a previously marked page, found a line with his fingertip, and read aloud, \u201cKatherine Adele, born February the twenty-second, in the year seventeen hundred and ninety-one. Father, Simon Langley Gramercy. Mother, Elinor Marie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKatherine?\u201d Kate\u2019s heart began to pound. \u201cDid you say Katherine?\u201d</p><p>Lark bounced in her chair with excitement. \u201cYes. We scanned the next several years\u2019 worth of records\u2014no death listing. No christening either, but no death. We asked the vicar if he knew of any Katherine living in the area who might be the right age now. He replied that he didn\u2019t. However, he said he\u2019d recently received a letter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA letter?\u201d Badger nosed at Kate\u2019s shins, and she lifted the pup into her lap. \u201cMy letter?\u201d</p><p>For the past several years, she\u2019d played the organ for Sunday worship at St. Ursula\u2019s. She asked no financial compensation for the service. Only a favor. Each week, Mr. Keane gave her an hour in the vicar\u2019s office. She chose a parish from his enormous Church of England directory and penned a letter, requesting a search of parish registers for any female children born between 1790 and 1792, given the Christian name Katherine, who had since fallen from the local record. She\u2019d begun with the parishes nearest Margate and worked outward.</p><p>Slowly. Over weeks and months and years.</p><p>The vicar signed and posted the letters for her. He also did her the favor of keeping them secret. Most of the villagers would have laughed at her for spending so much time and effort on a fruitless enterprise. In their eyes, she might as well have spent her time sticking notes in bottles and heaving them into the ocean.</p><p>But Kate hadn\u2019t been able to let the idea go. She\u2019d made hope her weekly habit. Every time the post brought another crushing \u201cNo\u201d\u2014or worse, when months passed with no reply at all, letting her know a perfectly good stone had gone unturned\u2014she listened to that voice inside her heart: Be brave, my Katie.</p><p>And now . . .</p><p>Now Aunt Marmoset\u2019s spice drop had nearly dissolved in her mouth\u2014and the older woman was right. A thick, delicious sweetness coated her tongue.</p><p>Kate savored it.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Lark said. \u201cIt was your letter. And I just knew in my heart, our Katherine must be you. We set off at once, traveled all afternoon, and arrived here a few hours ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe showed your vicar this\u201d\u2014Harry indicated the painting\u2014\u201cand once he recovered from his small apoplexy, he told us that Miss Kate Taylor did indeed bear a remarkable resemblance to the portrait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom the neck up, of course.\u201d Lark directed this comment\u2014and a timid smile\u2014at Corporal Thorne.</p><p>\u201cSo there you have it, my dear.\u201d Aunt Marmoset patted Kate\u2019s knee. \u201cThe tale has a miraculous ending. We have found you. And by all evidence, you seem to be the long-lost daughter of a marquess.\u201d</p><p>The words hit Kate like an avalanche. In the aftermath, her emotions were frozen, scattered things. It was all too much. She had parents named Simon and Elinor. She had a birthday. She had a middle name.</p><p>If . . .</p><p>If this could all be believed.</p><p>\u201cBut I never lived anywhere near Kenmarsh,\u201d she said. \u201cI was raised as a ward of Margate School until just four years ago. That was when I came here to teach music lessons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd before Margate, where were you?\u201d Lord Drewe asked.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t any clear memory, unfortunately. I asked my schoolmistress for details.\u201d Goodness, had her horrid interview with Miss Paringham only been that afternoon? \u201cShe told me I was abandoned.\u201d</p><p>Kate stared at the woman in the portrait. Her mother, if this could be believed. Had she died? Or given her baby up, unable to care for a child on her own? But it was plain from the way the woman\u2019s hand draped affectionately over her rotund belly, she\u2019d loved that infant in the womb. How amazing, Kate thought, to think she could be in that painting, underneath the skin of it, fetal and wriggling and . . .</p><p>Loved.</p><p>\u201cYou poor thing,\u201d Lark said. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine how you must have suffered. We can\u2019t undo those years, but we will do our best to make up for them now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Drewe agreed. \u201cWe must install you at Ambervale as soon as possible. When I\u2019m home tonight, I\u2019ll send a lady\u2019s maid to help with your packing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure that won\u2019t be necessary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you already have your own lady\u2019s maid?\u201d</p><p>Kate laughed, astonished. \u201cNo. I haven\u2019t that many belongings to pack. What I meant was, it\u2019s not appropriate for you to invite me to your home.\u201d</p><p>Lord Drewe blinked. \u201cOf course it\u2019s appropriate. It\u2019s a family home.\u201d</p><p>A family home.</p><p>The words made her breath catch painfully. \u201cBut . . . wouldn\u2019t I be an embarrassment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d Harry said. \u201cOur brother Bennett holds the position of family embarrassment, and he jealously guards it against all would-be usurpers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would you embarrass us, dear?\u201d asked Aunt Marmoset.</p><p>\u201cEven if all you say is true . . . I\u2019m your illegitimate second cousin, by a tenant farmer\u2019s daughter.\u201d</p><p>Kate waited for the import of her words to sink in. Surely people at the Gramercys\u2019 level of society didn\u2019t associate with bastard relations?</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re concerned about scandal, don\u2019t be,\u201d Lark said. \u201cScandal comes with the Gramercy name\u2014along with enough wealth that no one much cares. If there\u2019s one lesson Aunt Marmoset instilled in us from our youth, it\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeware of spice drops,\u201d said Harry.</p><p>\u201cFamily above everything,\u201d countered Lord Drewe. \u201cWe may be a motley assortment of aristocrats, but we stand by one another through scandal, misfortune, and the rare triumph.\u201d He pointed to the parish register. \u201cSimon claimed his daughter and gave her the family name. So if this infant is you, Miss Taylor . . .\u201d</p><p>A dramatic pause thickened the air in the room.</p><p>\u201c. . . then you are not Miss Taylor at all. You are Katherine Adele Gramercy.\u201d</p><p>Katherine Adele Gramercy?</p><p>Like hell she was.</p><p>Thorne clenched his jaw. He wasn\u2019t a man of words. This situation called for eloquence, but he could only think of action. Chiefly, he wanted to fling open the door and turn all these queerly chattering aristocrats out on their arses. Then he\u2019d lift Miss Taylor in his arms and carry her upstairs to have the restful lie-down she\u2019d been needing for the past several hours. Her cheeks were deathly pale.</p><p>He would want to lie down next to her, but he wouldn\u2019t. Because unlike these presumptive intruders, he had restraint. Thorne had heard of aristocratic inbreeding being to blame for imbecility and bad teeth. This family seemed to have contracted a sort of verbal cholera. Everything they spouted was rubbish.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t believe these people proposed to take Miss Taylor away. He couldn\u2019t believe she\u2019d consider going with them. She had sense.</p><p>And she promptly displayed some of it.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so kind. But I\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t leave Spindle Cove so hastily. I have obligations here. Lessons, pupils. Our midsummer fair is just a week or so away, and I\u2019m responsible for all the music and dancing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I love a fair.\u201d The youngest one bounced in her seat again. She had an irritating way of doing that, Thorne noticed.</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t much, but we have a good time with it. It\u2019s a children\u2019s festival, mostly\u2014up at the ruined castle. Corporal Thorne and his militiamen are helping, too.\u201d After throwing him a hesitant look, Miss Taylor continued, \u201cAt any rate, surely you\u2019d wish for this . . . connection . . . to be more official before inviting me to your home? If we find that your suppositions are wrong, and I am actually not your relation . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut the portrait,\u201d the young lady protested. \u201cThe register. Your birthmark.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMiss Taylor is right,\u201d Lord Drewe said. \u201cWe must prove it\u2019s not merely coincidence. I\u2019ll dispatch men to interview at the school, canvass the local area around Ambervale. I\u2019ve no doubt we\u2019ll find the link between your infancy and Margate easily enough, with a bit of digging.\u201d</p><p>Thorne knew Lord Drewe\u2019s men would find no link between that parish register and Margate school. He could have cleared his throat and informed them precisely where Kate Taylor had spent her early years. She could see how eager these people were to claim her as a Gramercy then. There was high-class scandal, and then there was immoral squalor.</p><p>He said, \u201cMiss Taylor isn\u2019t going anywhere with you. All you\u2019ve presented are suspicions of her identity. And we don\u2019t even know who you are.\u201d</p> <p>Miss Taylor bit her lip. \u201cCorporal Thorne, I\u2019m sure\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no,\u201d the mannish one interrupted. \u201cThe good corporal is absolutely right, Miss Taylor. We could be a gang of white slavers, or bloodthirsty cannibals. Or occultists looking for a virgin sacrifice.\u201d</p><p>Thorne did not believe the Gramercys to be white slavers or cannibals or occultists\u2014though they seemed to him the genteel version of bedlamites. And though he knew something of Kate Taylor\u2019s childhood, he had to admit\u2014he could not say with certainty that they were not her cousins. It was possible, he supposed. She hadn\u2019t been born in that place. And she had the right name, the right year of birth. Those facts, plus the portrait and birthmark, made an argument that couldn\u2019t be easily dismissed.</p><p>Still, the odds remained against it, and he didn\u2019t trust these people. There was something wrong about them and their story. Perhaps they were mistaken about the connection\u2014in which case Miss Taylor would end up dismayed and potentially the object of ridicule. Alternatively, they were her relations and had somehow misplaced her for the better part of twenty-three years, allowing her to languish in cruel, isolating poverty.</p><p>They were careless, at best. Criminal, at worst.</p> <p>He didn\u2019t trust them with the next five minutes of Miss Taylor\u2019s future, much less the entirety of her life.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not leaving with you,\u201d he repeated. \u201cI won\u2019t allow it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemind me,\u201d Drewe said coolly, \u201cexactly who you are. In relation to Miss Taylor, I mean.\u201d</p><p>Thorne saw the choice before him, clear as a fork in a road. He either spoke the words hovering on the tip of his tongue\u2014words he would never have dared to dream, let alone give voice. Or he let Miss Taylor go with the Gramercys, surrendering any claim on her safety and happiness. Forever.</p><p>There was no choice at all. He spoke the words.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m her betrothed,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re engaged to be married.\u201d</p> <p>Chapter Six</p><p>Kate startled in her chair. Surely she\u2019d misheard him.</p><p>Engaged? To be married?</p><p>\u201cCongratulations, dear.\u201d Aunt Marmoset squeezed her hand. \u201cHave another spice drop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTruly,\u201d Kate said, finally finding her voice. \u201cI\u2019ve no\u2014\u201d</p><p>Before she could get the words of protest out, Thorne\u2019s big hand landed on her shoulder. And squeezed, hard. It was a concise, unmistakable message:</p><p>Don\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cNo one mentioned that you were betrothed,\u201d Lord Drewe said, looking suspiciously from Kate to Thorne and back. \u201cNot the vicar, not the landlady . . .\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe hadn\u2019t told anyone yet,\u201d Thorne replied. \u201cIt\u2019s recent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow recent?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe accepted me today, on the way home from Hastings.\u201d Thorne lifted his hand from Kate\u2019s shoulder and smoothed a stray wisp of her hair, subtly calling attention to its unbound state.</p><p>Kate\u2019s cheeks burned as his implication spread through the parlor, working as a joist to lift eyebrows in every corner of the room.</p><p>Lark beamed. \u201cOh, I knew there was something between you. Why else would you have come home so late, looking so . . .\u201d Her voice trailed off as her gaze wandered to Kate\u2019s bedraggled hem and her mussed hair. \u201c . . . so natural.\u201d</p><p>Her chair legs screeched as Kate shot to her feet. \u201cCorporal Thorne, might I have a word?\u201d</p><p>She excused herself with a nervous smile in the Gramercys\u2019 direction.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you on about?\u201d she whispered, once he\u2019d followed her to a corner near the pianoforte. Kate knew from experience they could speak quietly there without being overhead. \u201cHours ago you told me you don\u2019t feel a . . . a dratted thing for me, and now you declare that we\u2019re engaged?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m looking out for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLooking out for me? You just implied that we . . . that we\u2019ve been . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey were already thinking it,\u201d he said. \u201cBelieve me. I brought you home late at night, looking like you\u2019ve been tumbled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then you told them I gave you a puppy. What else are they going to conclude?\u201d</p><p>Her cheeks blazed and she looked away.</p><p>\u201cAll that blushing doesn\u2019t help, either.\u201d</p><p>How could she keep from blushing? Her face heated further as she thought of his fingertips teasing that lock of her hair so presumptively.</p><p>\u201cWe won\u2019t go through with it,\u201d he said. \u201cMarriage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe won\u2019t?\u201d In the ensuing silence, Kate worried that she\u2019d sounded disappointed. \u201cI mean, of course we won\u2019t. I\u2019ve no desire to marry you. I\u2019m going to tell the Gramercys so right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be a mistake.\u201d His hands went to her shoulders, keeping her in place. \u201cHear me now. You\u2019re overwhelmed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not over\u2014\u201d</p><p>Her voice broke. She couldn\u2019t even find the strength to complete the objection. Of course she was overwhelmed. Overwhelmed, exhausted, confused. And it was at least partly his fault. Perhaps mostly his fault.</p><p>To his credit, he didn\u2019t deny it.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the end of a very long day,\u201d he said. \u201cYour schoolmistress treated you ill. The cart driver treated you ill. I treated you worst of all. Then these people show up with their fairy tale, their pockets full of candy and riches. You want to see the best in them, because that\u2019s your nature. But I tell you, there\u2019s something not right about them and their story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you say that?\u201d</p><p>A long hesitation. \u201cIt\u2019s a feeling.\u201d</p><p>She opened her eyes and regarded him keenly. \u201cA feeling? I thought you didn\u2019t possess those.\u201d</p><p>He ignored her baiting comment. \u201cYou can\u2019t be sure what they\u2019re after. They\u2019re not yet sure of you. This is a risky situation, and you have no guardian or relations to safeguard your interests. That leaves me. But I can\u2019t claim an interest in your well-being without making some claim on you.\u201d</p><p>A claim on you. Kate didn\u2019t know how to take those words. Her whole life, no one had ever tried to make any claim on her. Now two in one night.</p><p>The entire situation had an air of unreality about it. The lateness of the hour, the string of coincidences, the sheer strangeness of the Gramercys. She didn\u2019t know whom or what she could trust at the moment\u2014after the foolish way she\u2019d thrown herself at Thorne that afternoon, her own desperate heart seemed the least reliable thing of all.</p><p>She needed an ally. But him?</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re honestly suggesting we pretend to be engaged? You. And me.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cI don\u2019t do playacting, Miss Taylor. There\u2019d be nothing pretend about it. I\u2019m proposing a real betrothal, so that I can offer you real protection. As soon as your situation is more certain, you can release me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRelease you,\u201d she echoed.</p><p>\u201cFrom the engagement. A lady can break an engagement at any time, and her reputation suffers no ill effects. If you\u2019re proved to be a Gramercy, no one would expect you to go through with marrying me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if I\u2019m not proved to be a Gramercy?\u201d</p><p>His brow quirked. \u201cNo one would expect you to go through with it then, either.\u201d</p><p>She supposed they wouldn\u2019t. As all of Spindle Cove knew, she and Thorne were the social equivalent of oil and water. They didn\u2019t mix.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you doing this?\u201d she asked, searching his hard expression for clues. \u201cWhy do you care?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do I\u2014\u201d With a gruff sigh, he released her. \u201cIt\u2019s my duty to look out for you, Miss Taylor. In the next fortnight I\u2019ll be seeing Lord Rycliff about my honorable discharge. If I\u2019ve just handed his wife\u2019s closest friend to the custody of questionable strangers, he might not look so favorably on my request.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she said. \u201cI see. That does make sense.\u201d</p><p>Well, at least his stone-hearted, emotionless response was a touch of the familiar.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said, turning to the Gramercys. \u201cI should have mentioned the engagement earlier.\u201d She reached for Thorne\u2019s hand and tried to gaze affectionately into his eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s only so new. We haven\u2019t even had time to tell our friends, have we . . .\u201d Her voice trailed off as she realized she didn\u2019t even know his Christian name.</p><p>Use a pet name, she told herself. An endearment. Dear, darling, sweetheart, pet, love. Anything.</p><p>\u201c . . . have we, Cuddles?\u201d she finished, smiling sweetly.</p><p>Ah. Now there was a crack in the ice sheeting those blue eyes. His grip tensed around her palm. Kate felt oddly comforted by these overt signs of his annoyance. Somehow, needling him made this all seem normal again.</p><p>Lord Drewe stood tall in the center of the room, radiating nobility and command. \u201cHere is what will happen.\u201d</p><p>And Kate had sudden, complete confidence that whatever Lord Drewe said next would indeed happen. Even if he announced that spice drops would rain from the sky.</p><p>\u201cMiss Taylor, I can see that we\u2019re rushing you. You have this midsummer fair in the offing, personal affairs to attend. And naturally, you\u2019re reluctant to leave when you\u2019re so newly betrothed.\u201d</p><p>She leaned into Thorne\u2019s arm. \u201cYes, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cObviously, we can\u2019t ask you to leave Spindle Cove at this time.\u201d</p><p>She exhaled with relief. Thank goodness. Lord Drewe was a clear-headed man, and he understood. He would return with his family to Ambervale, undertake his investigations, and notify her of the result. In writing, perhaps, rather than with a midnight visit.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re busy,\u201d Lord Drewe went on, \u201cwhereas we are merely on holiday. But there\u2019s no reason we can\u2019t spend our holiday here.\u201d</p><p>Kate swallowed hard. \u201cY-You mean to stay here in Spindle Cove? In the Queen\u2019s Ruby? All of you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there some other inn in the village?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cBut this one doesn\u2019t accept male guests.\u201d</p><p>Lord Drewe shrugged. \u201cI noticed a tavern across the green. Surely the proprietor has a room or two for let. I don\u2019t require anything special.\u201d</p><p>Oh, of course not. You\u2019re only a marquess.</p><p>This was an unforeseen complication. It was one thing to tell these people she was engaged to Thorne, and another thing altogether to live so here, in Spindle Cove.</p><p>Heavens. No one in the village would believe it.</p><p>Drewe said, \u201cI\u2019ll speak with Mrs. Nichols about securing rooms for the ladies, and I\u2019ll send the coaches for our things straightaway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSurely this isn\u2019t necessary,\u201d Kate said.</p><p>\u201cHolidays rarely are,\u201d said Aunt Marmoset. \u201cThat\u2019s the beauty of them, dear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to inconvenience you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s no inconvenience. Spindle Cove is a seaside resort for unconventional ladies, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Lord Drewe spread his hands, indicating his sisters and aunt. \u201cI happen to have three highly unconventional ladies in tow, all of whom will be glad for the amusement. As for myself, I conduct all my affairs through correspondence. I can do that from anywhere.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m dying to see the fair,\u201d Lark said.</p><p>\u201cA little sea-bathing would set me up nicely,\u201d said Aunt Marmoset.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m quite keen on the idea of a stay in Spinster Cove,\u201d said Harry, tugging her waistcoat straight as she rose from her chair. \u201cIt will make Ames deliciously jealous.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo you see, Miss Taylor, it\u2019s ideal. This way, we needn\u2019t take you from your friends, but we\u2019ll have ample time to grow acquainted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, about that . . .\u201d Kate bit her lip. \u201cThis is a small village. Might I ask that we keep this potential kinship to ourselves? I should hope to keep speculation and gossip to a minimum, in case . . . in case it all comes to naught.\u201d</p><p>She could only hope that there weren\u2019t three girls pressing their ears to the parlor door this moment.</p><p>\u201cYes, of course,\u201d Lord Drewe said, pausing a moment to consider. \u201cWe have a hearty dislike of gossip, too\u2014one bred from familiarity, sad to say. As far as people outside this room are concerned, we are engaging your services as Lark\u2019s personal music tutor. Will that suffice?\u201d</p><p>Lark moved to her side. \u201cIn truth, I could use the lessons. I\u2019m a disaster on the pianoforte, but perhaps I\u2019d take to the harp.\u201d</p> <p>The young lady\u2019s warm smile touched Kate\u2019s heart. So did Harry\u2019s reassuring nod, Lord Drewe\u2019s confident demeanor, and the lingering taste of Aunt Marmoset\u2019s spice drop on her tongue.</p><p>They were a family, and they wanted to spend time with her. To know her. Even if it only lasted a few days, that alone was worth anything\u2014even suffering a bit more awkwardness with Thorne. Here was one benefit to his cruel rejection in the heather. Now she knew better than to imagine any feelings on his side.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Kate said, turning a guarded smile from one Gramercy to the next. \u201cI suppose it\u2019s all settled.\u201d</p><p>Settled.</p><p>As she crawled into bed some time later, Kate felt anything but settled.</p><p>When last she slept between these linen sheets, she\u2019d been an orphan and a spinster. During the course of this wild day, she\u2019d managed to accumulate four potential cousins, a mongrel puppy, and a temporary betrothed.</p> <p>\u201cSettled\u201d did not describe her state. Quite the opposite. Her mind was abuzz with excitement, possibility . . .</p><p>And that kiss.</p><p>Even after all that happened with the Gramercys, she still couldn\u2019t forget that kiss.</p><p>This was horrible. She was bone weary and mentally exhausted. She desperately wanted to fall asleep. But every time she closed her eyes, she felt the heat of his strong lips on hers.</p><p>Every. Time.</p><p>If only she\u2019d kept her eyes open for the kiss, maybe she would have avoided this association. But no. The connection was drawn: eyes shut, kiss recalled. The instant her eyelashes fluttered against her cheeks, her lips plumped and her whole body throbbed with heady, unwanted sensation.</p><p>She should have taken more pains to be kissed years ago, so the feeling wouldn\u2019t be so novel now. Really, what self-respecting girl had her first kiss at the age of twenty-three?</p><p>She didn\u2019t even like him. He was a horrid, unfeeling man.</p> <p>Think of family, she admonished herself, staring wide-eyed up at the ceiling beams. Think of birthdays in February. Think of that unabashedly naked woman in the portrait, lovingly patting her swollen belly. She might have been your mother.</p><p>If she was going to lie abed sleepless, it ought to be these thoughts that kept her awake. Not a kiss that had meant nothing, given by a man who didn\u2019t feel a damned thing for her, who saw engagement to her as a means of career advancement.</p><p>She would not think of him any longer. Would not.</p><p>She grabbed the pillow, put it over her face and growled into it. Then she clutched the same pillow to her chest and hugged it very tight.</p><p>\u201cSee the garden of blossoms so fair. Roses in bloom, orchids so rare.\u201d</p><p>She whisper-sang the familiar words into the darkness, letting the melody curl around her like a blanket. The silly nursery song was Kate\u2019s earliest childhood memory. The lilting tune always calmed her nerves.</p><p>\u201cLilies tall and sweet,\u201d she continued. \u201cRounder mums, too. All of them dancing, dancing for you.\u201d</p><p>As the last note faded, her eyelids slipped shut and stayed there.</p><p>She dreamt of a hot, stormy kiss that lasted all night long.</p><p>Chapter Seven</p><p>\u201cOh, Miss Taylor! I was so hoping you\u2019d come in this morning.\u201d</p><p>Kate froze in the entryway of the All Things shop.</p><p>Sally Bright, the village shopgirl and gossip, looked up from her ledger and cast her a sly smile. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to hear everything.\u201d</p><p>Oh, please. Please, don\u2019t let word have gotten around.</p><p>Kate herself could scarcely believe last night\u2019s interview with the Gramercys, much less be pressed to explain it. \u201cHear everything about what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything about you and Thorne, of course. Miss Taylor, you must tell me. I\u2019ll forgive your entire line of credit, but I want to hear every detail. I heard you\u2019re betrothed.\u201d The girl hopped for emphasis. \u201cBetrothed!\u201d</p><p>Kate closed her eyes. Oh. That. The girl wanted to hear about her and Thorne. She was having a hard time crediting those events, too.</p><p>\u201cDid you say betrothed?\u201d In her peripheral vision she saw a lace cap swivel.</p><p>Kate adjusted the heavy basket on her arm. Mrs. Highwood, a matron in her middle years, stood at the far corner of the shop, accompanied by the eldest of her three daughters, Diana.</p><p>\u201cWho is betrothed?\u201d the older woman demanded.</p><p>Mrs. Highwood was a woman of advancing age\u2014but when it came to the subject of matrimony, her hearing was positively canine in its acuity. Between her voracious interest in all things nuptial and Sally\u2019s love of gossip . . .</p><p>Well, at least this would be over quickly.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Miss Taylor and Corporal Thorne,\u201d Sally jumped to inform her. \u201cIt happened just yesterday, on their way home from Hastings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you even know all this?\u201d Kate asked, marveling.</p><p>\u201cYour new music pupil came in the shop. Lady Lark, is it? She popped in first thing this morning for tooth powder and told me everything.\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Highwood crossed to the counter. \u201cMiss Taylor? Betrothed to Corporal Thorne? I cannot believe it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this true, Kate?\u201d Diana asked. \u201cI must admit, that\u2019s . . . rather a surprise.\u201d</p><p>Of course it would be a surprise. She and Diana were friends, and not only had she never said a thing to the eldest Miss Highwood about liking Corporal Thorne\u2014she\u2019d given every indication of despising the man.</p><p>Because she did despise him. He was horrid and cold and unfeeling and now . . .</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true,\u201d Kate said, inwardly cringing. \u201cWe\u2019re engaged.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s all right, she reminded herself. It\u2019s only temporary.</p><p>\u201cBut how did this happen?\u201d Diana asked.</p><p>\u201cVery suddenly.\u201d Kate swallowed. \u201cI\u2019d gone into Hastings for new music, and I missed the last stagecoach home. I chanced across Corporal Thorne in the street, and he offered me a ride home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then . . . ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then we stopped to rest the horse near a turnpike. We . . . discussed the past and the future. By the time I settled in for the night at the Queen\u2019s Ruby, we were engaged.\u201d There, all of that was the truth.</p><p>Sally pouted. \u201cThat is the worst recounting I\u2019ve ever heard! You owe us more than that. Did he go down on one knee, declare mad love for you? Was there a kiss?\u201d</p><p>Kate didn\u2019t know how to answer. Yes, there had been a kiss. And her first kiss should have been an occasion to bubble over with excitement and regale all her friends with breathless details. Instead, she just wanted to conceal her humiliation.</p><p>\u201cLook at your face,\u201d Sally said. \u201cRed as sealing wax. It must have been a very good kiss indeed. The man\u2019s no kind of monk. You\u2019ll be a lucky bride, Miss Taylor. I\u2019ve heard such tales . . .\u201d She scribbled in her ledger.</p><p>Mrs. Highwood snapped open a fan and worked it vigorously. \u201cInsupportable. My Diana\u2019s poor health has us confined to this seaside hamlet, while all England celebrates the allied victory. Here we stay, doomed to watch her chances of marriage sail by, like so many ships viewed from the shore. And now Miss Taylor is engaged?\u201d</p><p>Diana gave Kate an apologetic smile. \u201cMama, I believe what you mean to say is that we are thrilled for Kate, and we wish her much joy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMuch joy,\u201d the older lady muttered. \u201cYes, Miss Taylor may have much joy, but what of us? I ask you, Diana, where is our joy? Where?\u201d She drew the last word into a wavering lament. \u201cEveryone who is anyone is in Town this summer. Including your sister, who\u2014I remind you\u2014has recently married a viscount.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Mama. I do recall.\u201d Diana coughed pitifully into a handkerchief. \u201cIt\u2019s so unfortunate my health has taken a sudden turn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do look very pale today,\u201d Kate said.</p><p>Diana and Kate exchanged knowing looks. Minerva Highwood\u2019s recent marriage to Lord Payne was the entire reason for this subterfuge. Left to her own devices, Mrs. Highwood would have descended on the newlyweds within a day of their arrival in Town, demanding introductions be made and balls be held. Diana wanted her sister to have a quiet honeymoon\u2014hence the mysterious and sudden \u201cdecline\u201d in her health.</p><p>\u201cI tell you,\u201d the older woman muttered, \u201cin my youth, I should not have let consumption, malaria, and typhoid put together keep me from the celebrations of the Glorious Peace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you would not have been much fun at parties,\u201d Kate couldn\u2019t help but say. \u201cAll that hacking and shivering with fever.\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Highwood sent her a sharp look.</p><p>Just then Sally Bright slammed her ledger shut. \u201cThere, that\u2019s done. Now, Miss Taylor, spill everything.\u201d</p><p>What Kate spilled were the contents of her hamper. Inside it, Badger startled at the crack of the ledger closing. The pup leapt from the wicker basket, then darted about the shop, rocketing from one corner to another.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a rat!\u201d Mrs. Highwood cried, displaying the spryness of a woman ten years her junior as she climbed a nearby stepladder.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a rat, Mrs. Highwood.\u201d</p><p>The puppy scampered under a bank of shelves.</p><p>Kate ducked and scouted under the cupboards. \u201cBadger! Badger, do come out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven worse,\u201d the matron moaned. \u201cIt\u2019s a badger. What sort of young woman carries a badger in a handbasket? It\u2019s like a harbinger of the End of Days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe it\u2019s a puppy, Mama,\u201d Diana said. Crouching, she joined Kate in the search. \u201cNow where\u2019s the dear thing gone?\u201d</p><p>Down on hands and knees, Kate peered under the cupboard. Badger was there, wedged far at the back. She stuck her hand into the gap and groped for a handful of scruff. Drat. Just out of her reach.</p><p>Diana knelt beside her. \u201cPoor dear. He must be frightened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere. Try this.\u201d Sally joined them, holding out a bit of salted bacon she\u2019d taken from a barrel in the storeroom. \u201cBefore he leaves a puddle under there.\u201d</p><p>Kate blew out a swift breath, lifting a lock of hair that had fallen over her brow. The puppy had already left two puddles in her room at the Queen\u2019s Ruby. One on the floorboards, and another in her bed. By the time she\u2019d returned from breakfast with a slice of ham and a roll tucked in her pocket, the little beast had chewed up the handle of her good fan and one half of her most comfortable pair of slippers.</p><p>\u201cCome now, Badger. That\u2019s a good boy.\u201d Kate pursed her lips and made encouraging noises. The pup sniffed and advanced a little, but not quite far enough.</p><p>Recalling Corporal Thorne whistling for the dog yesterday, she pressed her lips together and gave a short, chirping whistle. That did the trick. The pup came darting out\u2014a furry bullet shooting straight into her lap. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Kate fell back on her backside with an oof. She laughed as Badger devoured the bacon from her hand, then set about licking every trace of salt from her palm and fingertips.</p><p>\u201cYou will get me into so much trouble,\u201d she whispered. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve no strength to chide you.\u201d</p><p>Badger knew it, too. He cocked his head. Then his ear. Twitched his nose. Wagged his tail. As if to say, Look upon my arsenal of adorable behaviors . . . and tremble.</p> <p>\u201cThis naughty little dear is Badger,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s the reason I came in today, Sally. I was hoping you\u2019d have something I can use as a leash. Carrying him in the basket obviously won\u2019t do. And perhaps you\u2019d have some stray bits of something for him to chew? Last night, I let him destroy a copy of Mrs. Worthington\u2019s Wisdom.\u201d</p><p>Sally crossed her arms. \u201cI might have a dog lead in back. As for things to gnaw . . .\u201d She considered a moment, then snapped her fingers. \u201cI know. What about Finn\u2019s old leather foot? He\u2019s been fitted with a nicer prosthetic now.\u201d</p><p>Kate shuddered at the thought of Badger gnawing away at a human limb, even a false one. How macabre. \u201cThat\u2019s a . . . creative . . . thought, but perhaps we\u2019ll just stick with Mrs. Worthington\u2019s Wisdom. It is a very useful book.\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Highwood came down from the stepladder and examined the dog. \u201cWherever did you acquire such a mongrel, anyhow?\u201d</p><p>She gave Badger a brisk rub. \u201cCorporal Thorne picked up the little urchin from a farmer.\u201d</p> <p>Sally perked up. \u201cThat\u2019s Thorne\u2019s dog?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, he\u2019s my dog now.\u201d She covered Badger\u2019s ears, lest he hear himself being disparaged. \u201cIt\u2019s only a mongrel pup he took in on a whim.\u201d</p><p>Kate knew she couldn\u2019t offer a growing puppy the most suitable of homes. But she could give Badger love, and that was what he needed most.</p><p>Sally shook her head. \u201cAre you certain? Rufus told me Corporal Thorne\u2019s been wanting a coursing hound. He\u2019s had one on special order from a breeder. The pups come quite dear, I understand.\u201d</p><p>Kate stared at the dog in her arms. Valuable? Badger? Such a funny-looking thing, all long, thin limbs and patched fur that was not quite straight, not quite curly. He was like an animated heap of cowlicks.</p><p>And if Thorne prized him, surely he would have told her so.</p> <p>\u201cSally, I think you must have your puppies confused.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor the love of St. Ursula!\u201d Mrs. Highwood cried. She\u2019d moved to the window. \u201cThis, I\u2019ll have you know, is why this place is called \u2018Spinster Cove.\u2019 While you featherbrained girls carry on about mongrel dogs, there is a gentleman walking down the lane. A tall, marvelous-looking one, carrying an expensive walking stick. I detect no hint of marriage in his demeanor.\u201d</p><p>Diana laughed. \u201cMama, you cannot determine a man is single just by viewing him from across the lane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I can. My intuition has never failed me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis name is Lord Drewe,\u201d Kate said. \u201cHe\u2019s here on holiday with his two sisters and an aunt.\u201d She prolonged the suspense another moment. \u201cAnd he\u2019s a marquess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA marq\u2014\u201d Mrs. Highwood swayed on her feet. \u201cAn unmarried marquess. Oh, my nerves. I will faint.\u201d</p><p>The men of the Spindle Cove militia were not particularly interested in a visiting marquess. And the addition of a few more female oddities to the Queen\u2019s Ruby coterie was simply the normal course.</p><p>But it wasn\u2019t every day they had a chance to needle their commander.</p> <p>\u201cEngaged to Miss Taylor?\u201d Aaron Dawes exclaimed, once drill was finished for the morning.</p><p>Thorne ignored the question. He stretched his neck to one side until it cracked.</p><p>\u201cThought you went to Hastings for a hunting dog,\u201d Dawes said, \u201cnot a wife.\u201d The blacksmith shook his head. \u201cI must say, never saw that coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone of us saw this coming,\u201d said Fosbury. \u201cExactly how did you woo her, Corporal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is Thorne we\u2019re discussing,\u201d Dawes said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t woo. He commands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that wouldn\u2019t work on Miss Taylor. She\u2019s got spirit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd humor,\u201d said the vicar. \u201cAnd good sense.\u201d</p><p>Yes, Thorne silently agreed. All that, plus distracting beauty and a mouth so lush and sweet, he\u2019d spent the whole night dreaming about it and woken with a rod of forged steel between his legs.</p><p>\u201cYes, Miss Taylor\u2019s a very sweet girl,\u201d Fosbury said. He eyed Thorne with good-humored curiosity. \u201cMakes a man wonder . . . What\u2019s she see in you?\u201d</p><p>Nothing. Nor should she.</p><p>\u201cEnough,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have a great deal to make ready before the ladies have their fair. My personal affairs are none of your concern.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t think we\u2019re concerned for you,\u201d Dawes said. \u201cWe\u2019re concerned for her. Miss Taylor has a great many friends in Spindle Cove. None of us want to see her hurt. That\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>Thorne cursed silently. If all Miss Taylor\u2019s friends knew the truth, they\u2019d thank him. He was only trying to protect her from a far more dangerous threat.</p><p>The Gramercys.</p><p>It made no sense that the family would so eagerly take up residence in Spindle Cove, and even less sense that Lord Drewe himself would remain. Thorne could only conclude the marquess was reluctant to let Miss Taylor out of his sight. Why would he feel so protective of an illegitimate second cousin?</p><p>Higher mathematics might not be his strength, but he knew when something didn\u2019t add up.</p><p>\u201cCorporal Thorne!\u201d Rufus Bright called down from the turret. \u201cMiss Taylor\u2019s climbing up the path.\u201d</p><p>Thorne dismissed the men with a curt nod. \u201cThat will be all. Go assist Sir Lewis with the trebuchet.\u201d</p><p>The men groaned. But they obeyed, crossing through an arch and wandering out to the bluffs where Sir Lewis Finch had his monstrosity erected.</p><p>Spindle Cove denizens whispered a prayer whenever the aging, eccentric Sir Lewis approached a trigger, a fuse, a powder charge\u2014or in this case, a medieval catapult designed to lay whole cities to waste. However, instead of launching flaming balls of pitch over fortified walls, this trebuchet\u2019s sole purpose was lobbing melons out to sea. Just a bit of show for the midsummer fair.</p><p>The mechanics of the ancient weapon were apparently more sensitive and twitchy than a virgin\u2019s inner thigh. A great many test runs were needed before it would be ready.</p><p>Sir Lewis\u2019s sonorous baritone carried over the castle ruins. \u201cReady, men! Three . . . two . . .\u201d</p><p>A great whomping and whooshing noise coincided with the count of one, as the men released the trebuchet\u2019s counterweight. The sling made its groaning orbit upward, then lurched to a halt and sent its missile soaring in the direction of the sea.</p><p>In the direction of the sea. Not all the way there.</p><p>From the loud squelch that followed, the thing couldn\u2019t have flown more than fifty feet before smashing to pulp on the rocks.</p><p>\u201cCorporal Thorne?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiss Taylor.\u201d She\u2019d appeared out of nowhere while he was distracted, Badger nosing at her heels.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve a matter to discuss with you. Can we have a private word?\u201d</p><p>He led her through the remains of a crumbled archway and around a low sandstone wall. It was a place apart, but not enclosed. The armory was no place for her, and he damned well couldn\u2019t take her into his quarters alone.</p><p>If he got her anywhere near a bed . . . this temporary engagement could all too easily become permanent.</p><p>God, just look at her this morning. The sunlight gave her hair hints of cinnamon and threw gold sparks in her eyes. The exertion of a steep climb up the bluffs showed her slight figure to its best advantage. And the heart-shaped mark at her temple . . . it was the worst and best of everything. It made him painfully aware she wasn\u2019t some unearthly apparition, but a flesh-and-blood woman who\u2019d warm in his embrace.</p><p>None of this was for him, he reminded himself. Not the careful curl of her hair, nor the spotless new gloves that gave her hands the look of bleached starfish. She wore a pale blue frock that seemed more froth than muslin. A border of delicate ivory lace trimmed the low, squared neckline. He shouldn\u2019t be noticing that lace. Much less staring at it.</p><p>He wrenched his gaze up to her face. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? What do you need?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing\u2019s wrong. Except that I\u2019m not accustomed to having a puppy for a roommate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReady to give him back, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a chance. I adore him.\u201d She bent to give the dog a brisk rub. \u201cBut how do I keep him from chewing things?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t. It\u2019s what he\u2019s born to do\u2014chase down small animals and rip them apart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy. What a little savage.\u201d</p><p>He pulled a handful of rabbit hide twists from his pocket. He tossed one to the dog, then offered the rest to her. \u201cGive him these, one at a time. They should last a few days, at least.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I buy more at the shop when these are gone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t know. I don\u2019t purchase them.\u201d</p><p>He expected her to give the knotted bits of scraped hide a faintly disgusted look, now that she knew just where they\u2019d originated. Instead, she regarded him with the same soft, liquid eyes she used on the pup.</p><p>\u201cYou had all those prepared? She must have been right. You do value this dog.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Who must be right?\u201d</p><p>She pocketed the extra rabbit hide scraps. \u201cSally Bright told me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSally Bright says a lot of things.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014that you had a puppy on order from a breeder. Bred from some kind of superior hunting stock. She said the pups come very dear. Corporal Thorne, if Badger means something to you, I\u2019ll give him back. I just need to know he\u2019ll be cared for.\u201d</p><p>Not this again. \u201cThe dog is mine. That\u2019s all I should need to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s so horrible about admitting a fondness for the creature? I\u2019m a music tutor, as you well know, and music is just another language. Unfamiliar phrases come easier with practice. Say it with me now, slowly: \u2018I care about the dog.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t say a thing.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a very intimidating scowl,\u201d she teased. \u201cDo you practice that look in the mirror? I\u2019ll bet you do. I\u2019ll bet you glare into the looking glass until it shatters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen be a clever girl and turn away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately, I can\u2019t. I came up here to talk privately because we need to make our stories straight. The whole village has heard of our betrothal already. Everyone\u2019s asking me how we came to be engaged, and I don\u2019t know what to tell them. Aren\u2019t the men asking you the same? What have you said?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. How could I forget? No one expects you to talk. You\u2019re Corporal Taciturn. But it\u2019s different with la\u2014\u201d</p><p>Shouts from the other side of the wall interrupted. \u201cReady, men! Three, two . . .\u201d</p><p>Thunk. Creak. Whoosh.</p><p>Then, a few seconds later, splat.</p><p>\u201cMore sand in the counterweight,\u201d Sir Lewis shouted to the men. \u201cWe almost have it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s different with ladies,\u201d Miss Taylor said, continuing where she\u2019d left off. \u201cYou don\u2019t understand. When a girl gets engaged, they want to know everything. Every glance, every touch, every whispered word. I can\u2019t abide lying to them, so I\u2019d prefer we hold to the truth. We became engaged yesterday. Our first kiss was on the way home from Hastings. We\u2019ve\u2014\u201d</p><p>He held up a hand, halting her mid-sentence. \u201cWait. You\u2019re telling people about the kiss?\u201d</p><p>She blushed. \u201cI haven\u2019t really, not yet. But I think I must. They\u2019re skeptical as it is. No one believes we\u2019ve been courting. Because we haven\u2019t been.\u201d Her gaze dropped to the turf. \u201cOh, this is miserable. I should have never agreed to the idea.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIf it\u2019s causing you that much anguish, release me from the engagement.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened. \u201cI couldn\u2019t do that so fast. I would look fickle, even mercenary. What kind of woman would engage herself to a man one evening, then throw him over the very next day just because her circumstances changed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA great many women would do that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m not one of them.\u201d</p><p>Thorne knew very well she wasn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cThe Gramercys might be my relations,\u201d she went on. \u201cI want them to like me\u2014and to know me\u2014for who I truly am. I\u2019m not the kind of woman to marry for convenience. Unless we lie a little bit, I\u2019ll feel dishonest.\u201d</p><p>Thorne frowned. Was she asking him to behave like an interested suitor? He\u2019d made concealing his attraction to her such a habit, he wasn\u2019t sure he knew how to do the reverse.</p><p>He opened his mouth to speak, but from beyond the wall came another shout: \u201cReady!\u201d</p> <p>Another count: \u201cThree, two . . .\u201d</p><p>Another shot from the trebuchet. This time, after several seconds of silence, he heard a distant, watery splash.</p><p>\u201cBetter,\u201d Sir Lewis called. \u201cThe force is right, but the aim is off. I need to adjust the mechanism.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur stories,\u201d Thorne said, once the men had gone quiet again. \u201cLet\u2019s make them matching, as you say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst, what are our plans after the wedding? Supposedly you\u2019re going to America.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am going to America. So supposedly you\u2019re coming with me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAre we headed for New York? Boston?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPhiladelphia, but only to gather supplies. I\u2019ve a plan to claim some land in Indiana Territory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndiana Territory?\u201d She scrunched up her face. \u201cIndiana. That sounds very . . . primitive.\u201d</p><p>Thorne shifted his weight. Through the lacy castle ruins, he could see the glistening, aquamarine cove and the expansive Channel beyond. Clearly the prospect of wide-open spaces didn\u2019t appeal to her the way it called to him. He\u2019d been planning this for some time now\u2014his own tract of land. He\u2019d been clinging to the idea so long, he could feel the grit under his fingernails. There\u2019d be rich soil to till, game to hunt and trap. Ample timber for the felling.</p><p>True freedom, and the chance to make his own life.</p><p>\u201cWhere would we live?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d build a house,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cHow would I continue with my music? I couldn\u2019t give it up. Not plausibly. This is me we\u2019re talking about. Everyone knows I\u2019d never have agreed to marry you\u2014or anyone\u2014unless music was part of the bargain.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll see that you have a pianoforte.\u201d He had no idea how one would be transported to the middle of the woodlands, but the logistics hardly signified.</p><p>\u201cAnd pupils?\u201d</p><p>He gestured impatiently with one hand. \u201cThere\u2019d be children, eventually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve tutored the daughters of dukes and lords. And now I\u2019d be teaching frontier neighbor children?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I meant ours. Our children.\u201d</p><p>Her eyebrows soared. A rather long time passed before she said, \u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>He made no apology for the insinuation. \u201cThis is me we\u2019re talking about. Everyone knows I wouldn\u2019t offer marriage to you\u2014or anyone\u2014unless bedding were part of the bargain.\u201d</p><p>Her cheeks colored. Thorne had a vivid, sudden vision of the two of them in a rough-hewn log cabin, tucked between a straw-tick mattress and a quilted counterpane. Nothing but heat and musk between their bodies. He\u2019d curl his strength around her softness, keeping out the cold and howling wolves. The scent of her hair would lull him to sleep.</p><p>That picture looked damn near paradise to him\u2014which meant it was unattainable. And he could imagine she wouldn\u2019t see the charms.</p><p>\u201cWhat about love?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He jerked his head, surprised. \u201cWhat about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you mean to love me? What about all these children you mean for us to create? Am I to believe you\u2019ll laugh and play with them, be open with them, let them into that stony thing you call a heart?\u201d</p><p>He stared at her. If he thought he could ever give her those things, he would have offered to do so. Months ago.</p><p>He said, \u201cNo one needs to believe love\u2019s involved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course they do. Because I would need to believe it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiss Taylor . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis will never work.\u201d She rubbed her brow with one hand. \u201cNo one will credit that I\u2019ve agreed to leave my friends, my work, my home, and my country behind. And for what? To cross the ocean and take up residence in a remote wilderness cabin with a man who can\u2019t fathom the meaning of love? In Indiana?\u201d</p><p>He took her by the shoulders, forcing her to face him. \u201cWe\u2019re ill suited. I know that. I could never make you happy. I know that, too. I\u2019m so far beneath you, the best I could ever offer would be a paltry fraction of what you deserve. I\u2019m aware of all of this, Miss Taylor. You don\u2019t have to remind me.\u201d</p><p>Regret softened her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. So sorry. I shouldn\u2019t have said\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSave the apologies. You spoke the truth. I was only agreeing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no. I can\u2019t stand for you to believe that I\u2019d . . .\u201d She reached for him.</p><p>Holy God. She reached for him, and before he could duck or step back or fall on his sword to prevent it, her gloved hand was on his cheek. Her palm flattened there, warm and satiny. Sensation jolted through his body.</p><p>When she spoke, her voice was quiet, but strong. \u201cYou\u2019re not beneath me. I\u2019d never think that.\u201d</p><p>Yes, you are beneath her, he reminded himself, bracing against the forbidden bliss coursing through his veins. And don\u2019t dare imagine you\u2019ll ever be atop her. Or curled behind her. Or buried deep inside her while she\u2014</p><p>Bloody hell. The fact that he could even think such a thing. He was crude, disgusting. So undeserving of even this slight caress. Her gesture was made out of guilt, offered in apology. If he took advantage, he would be a devil.</p><p>He knew all this.</p><p>But he flexed his arms anyway, drawing her close.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re worried you\u2019ve hurt my feelings,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>She nodded, just a little.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have those.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI forgot.\u201d</p><p>Amazing. He marveled at her foolishness. After all he\u2019d said to her, she would worry about him? Within this small, slight woman lived so much untapped affection, she couldn\u2019t help but squander it on music pupils and mongrel dogs and undeserving brutes. What was it like, he wondered, to live with that bright, glowing star in her chest? How did she survive it?</p><p>If he kissed her deeply enough and held her tight\u2014would some of its warmth transfer to him?</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d came a call, echoing vaguely in the distance. \u201cHold still! Not yet!\u201d</p><p>Perhaps the voice belonged to his conscience. He couldn\u2019t bring himself to pay it any mind. All he knew was her touch and her caring and the raw, trembling force of his own need.</p><p>He drew her closer still. Her eyes went wide. Larger and more lovely than he\u2019d ever seen them before. A whole world of possibility was opening in those dark pupils.</p><p>And then . . . Her gaze drifted up and a little to the side. Her lips fell apart in wonder.</p><p>A strange shadow appeared on her face.</p><p>A shadow that was round, and growing larger by the instant. As though some projectile were rapidly approaching from above.</p><p>Jesus, no.</p><p>Thorne had been here before, many times. Battle, sieges, skirmishes. Thought ceased, and instinct took over. His grip tightened on her shoulders. His already thundering heart pumped faster, powering strength to his limbs.</p><p>The word \u201cDown!\u201d tore from his throat.</p><p>He threw himself forward, wrapping her body in his arms and flattening her to the ground\u2014</p><p>Just as the explosion hit.</p><p>Chapter Eight</p><p>It took Kate several seconds to register what had happened.</p><p>One moment she\u2019d been staring, incredulous, as an object plummeted toward her from the sky. She\u2019d stood transfixed by the sheer absurdity of it. This strange, roundish thing silhouetted against the sun, growing larger and closer . . . and greener.</p><p>The next thing she knew, she was on the ground. Corporal Thorne was on top of her. And they were both covered in wet, sticky melon pulp. Shards of rind littered the ground nearby. A pungent sweetness filled her heightened senses. Evidently, Sir Lewis\u2019s adjustments to the trebuchet had gone awry.</p><p>Really, there was nothing else for it. She had to laugh. Softly at first, but soon her whole body shook with mirth.</p><p>Thorne didn\u2019t share her amusement. He didn\u2019t rise or roll to the side. He kept her in his arms, covering her with his body. His muscles had gone rigid, everywhere. When she sought his gaze, she found his blue eyes searching and unfocused. His nostrils were flared and his breaths were harshly won.</p><p>\u201cThorne? Are you all right?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer. She didn\u2019t think he could answer.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t there.</p><p>It was the only way she could think to describe it. His body lay atop her, heavy as sacks of grain. She knew he was alive, from the way his heartbeat slammed against hers. But mentally, he wasn\u2019t there. He was somewhere else. On some scorched, smoking battlefield, she imagined, where round objects falling from the sky had a great deal more destructive force than the average overripe melon.</p><p>She touched his face, just lightly. \u201cThorne? It\u2019s all right. It was only a melon. I\u2019m not hurt. Are you?\u201d</p><p>His arms flexed, squeezing her until she winced with pain.</p><p>He forced a strange growl through his clenched teeth. The sound was inhuman. Each hair on her arms stood tall, as if to wave a tiny flag of surrender, and her pulse drummed in her ears. She was truly afraid now. For him, and for herself. She lay small and defenseless beneath him. If he\u2019d mistaken her for the enemy on his phantom battlefield, he could do her true harm.</p><p>She caressed his face with trembling fingers, reaching to sweep the hair back from his brow. Between the velvet of his thick, soft hair and the wetness of the melon pulp, it felt like stroking a newborn foal. Tenderness swelled in her heart.</p><p>\u201cAll\u2019s well. We\u2019re unharmed. This is Rycliff Castle. Spindle Cove.\u201d Kate tried to keep her voice low and steady, aiming to soothe them both. \u201cYou\u2019re home. And it\u2019s only me. Miss Taylor. Kate. I\u2019m the music tutor, remember? I\u2019m your . . . I\u2019m a friend.\u201d</p><p>His jaw tensed. And not in a friendly way.</p><p>She\u2019d never been more aware of the brute power contained in a man\u2019s body. If he wished, he could snap her in two. Though perhaps not very cleanly\u2014which was all the more reason to avoid the experience, she thought. Somehow, she needed to remind him of his humanity. The gentleness these same bones and tendons and muscles could produce.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Miss Taylor,\u201d she repeated. \u201cYesterday, you came to my rescue in Hastings. You brought me home on your horse. We stopped to take bread, and\u2014and you kissed me. In a field of heather, just at sunset. I\u2019ve tried so hard to forget it, but I\u2019ve thought of little else since. Can you recall it?\u201d</p><p>She brushed a thumb across his lips.</p><p>His mouth softened a little and a shaky exhalation rushed over her fingertips. She thought she glimpsed a spark of awareness returning to his eyes.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said, encouraging him. \u201cYou\u2019re well. We\u2019re both safe. It\u2019s only me.\u201d</p><p>A shudder racked his body. He blinked hard, and his gaze began to focus on her face.</p><p>From his throat came a raspy, \u201cKatie?\u201d</p><p>She half sobbed with relief. \u201cYes. Yes, it\u2019s me.\u201d</p><p>He stared blankly at the melon pulp splattering her shoulder. \u201cYou\u2019re hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. No, I\u2019m fine. It\u2019s not blood. The militiamen were adjusting Sir Lewis\u2019s trebuchet, and there was a mishap. You took a melon for me.\u201d She smiled, even though her lips trembled. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He trembled, too. All over.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t so far away anymore\u2014but he wasn\u2019t quite home yet, either.</p><p>She raked her fingers through his hair, desperate to bridge that last divide. Perhaps she could have wriggled free of his grip now. But she couldn\u2019t leave him wandering in that shadow world, with bombs and blood and whatever other unimaginable horrors it held.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s safe now,\u201d she whispered. \u201cIt\u2019s safe to come back. I\u2019m here.\u201d She stretched her neck and pressed a light kiss to the corner of his mouth. \u201cI\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>She kissed his mouth again. Then again.</p><p>Each time their lips met, his mouth warmed a degree. She prayed his heart was warming back to life, too.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she murmured. \u201cCome back to me.\u201d</p><p>And he did. Oh, he did.</p> <p>The change in him was swift, abrupt. And it meant a complete inversion of her world.</p><p>Once again Kate found herself breathless, scarcely understanding what had happened. Last she\u2019d known, she\u2019d been pressing chaste kisses to his lips.</p><p>Now his tongue was in her mouth, and hers seemed to be partly in his. Her fingers were tangled in the sticky mess of his hair.</p><p>They were fused together. One creature. And all she could think was . . .</p><p>Sweet. He\u2019s so sweet.</p><p>The sugar-musky tang of melon was everywhere. She kissed him with abandon, thirsty for more of it\u2014and just so happy to know he was here again, and not worlds away. She still sensed all that raw, frightening power coiled in his body. Only now it wasn\u2019t marshaled to the task of survival, but another instinctive, basic drive.</p> <p>Desire.</p><p>\u201cKatie,\u201d he moaned again, pulling her closer still. Her breasts flattened beneath his broad chest. As he kissed her deeply, his muscled firmness rubbed and chafed against her nipples. The teasing sensation was unbearably exquisite. It drove her wild in her skin, made her forget everything.</p><p>His leg snaked between hers, pressing her thighs apart. When he thrust his tongue deep into her mouth, his hips rocked against hers, setting off a cascade of unprecedented pleasure. She moaned, mindlessly craving more.</p><p>Then he stopped abruptly, gasping for breath. Raised his head. Swore.</p><p>And then Kate realized what she couldn\u2019t have noticed, in her single-minded determination to bring him back from shadow and hold him skin close.</p><p>Everyone was watching them. Sir Lewis Finch. The entirety of the Spindle Cove militia. Oh, heavens . . . even the vicar. They\u2019d all come running to track the melon\u2019s trajectory. And they\u2019d come upon her and Thorne, tangled on the ground. Kissing like lovers.</p><p>Thorne rolled to the side, blocking her from their view. She tried her best to evaporate into the air. Meanwhile, he gruffly scolded the men for the mishap and ordered them back to work.</p><p>When they were gone, Badger came out of hiding and attacked Kate with puppyish vigor, licking the melon juice from her wrist and cheek.</p> <p>Thorne stood and paced the small area. \u201cDamn it.\u201d His hands were still faintly trembling. He balled them in fists. \u201cAre you well? I didn\u2019t hurt you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re certain? I want to know the truth. If I hurt you in any way, I\u2019d . . .\u201d He didn\u2019t complete the statement.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m unharmed. I promise. But how are you?\u201d</p><p>He kept pacing, dismissing her question with a small flick of his hand. As if his own well-being were completely irrelevant.</p><p>\u201cHas . . . that ever happened before?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not mad,\u201d he said. \u201cIf that\u2019s what you\u2019re thinking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not. Of course not. It was an absurd accident. I mean, what are the chances? A melon, of all things. A soldier is trained to react to bombs, grenades, cannon fire. No one\u2019s prepared for a melon. I understand completely.\u201d</p><p>He drew to a halt. He wouldn\u2019t look at her.</p><p>She closed her eyes, frustrated with herself. \u201cThat was a thoughtless thing for me to say. I don\u2019t understand at all. I can\u2019t possibly imagine what it is to go to war.\u201d She approached and laid a tentative touch to his sleeve. \u201cBut if you\u2019d ever want to tell someone, Thorne, I am a good listener.\u201d</p><p>His cold blue eyes held hers for a long moment, as though he were considering. \u201cI\u2019d never burden you with that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt might as well be me. I am your betrothed, for the time being.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. There was no denying that something between them had changed. They\u2019d survived a battle together\u2014even if it had been an imaginary siege. The fearful pounding of her heart had been very real, and the same was true of the cold sweat on his brow.</p><p>She had long been accustomed to thinking of Thorne as an enemy, but after that incident . . .</p><p>They were on the same side.</p><p>The two of them, against the melons of the world.</p><p>Kate smiled. With her fingertips, she flicked a seed from his sleeve. \u201cYou have to admit, this solves one problem. They\u2019ll all believe the engagement now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s one problem solved, perhaps. But several more created.\u201d</p><p>She gathered his meaning. Her pristine reputation was now spattered in melon pulp. Unless she were proved to be a Gramercy and offered a living outside Spindle Cove\u2014it would be nearly impossible for Kate to call this betrothal off.</p><p>Kate declined Thorne\u2019s offer of an escort home and hurried back to the rooming house. By the time she arrived at the back entrance, the late morning sun had dried the moisture from her sticky frock. She took the back stairs two at a time, ducking into her room to wash and change.</p><p>Exhausted from the morning\u2019s excitement, Badger made a nest of her discarded gown and curled up to sleep.</p><p>When Kate had made herself presentable, she went downstairs and found the Gramercys assembled in the parlor. As she entered the room, she stopped dead in the doorway.</p><p>Oh, Lord.</p><p>The painting. It was still there, on the mantelpiece. Half draped, at least, to conceal all the flesh. She hoped no one else had taken notice of it. She would take it up to her room later.</p><p>\u201cWhy, Miss Taylor!\u201d Lark looked up from a book. \u201cWhat a pleasant surprise.\u201d</p><p>Lord Drewe, being a conscientious gentleman, rose to his feet and bowed. \u201cWe weren\u2019t expecting you yet. We thought you\u2019d be occupied with music lessons, over at the Bull and Blossom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot just now. I thought I\u2019d come and . . . sit with you, if you don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be silly.\u201d Aunt Marmoset patted an empty section of divan. \u201cWe\u2019re in this village for you, dear. We don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut please don\u2019t let me interrupt,\u201d Kate said. \u201cJust be as you are, and go on as you were.\u201d</p><p>From her seat at the escritoire, Harry laughed. She set her quill aside and sprinkled a letter with blotting powder. \u201cWe\u2019re hardly busy. Lark\u2019s reading quietly. Aunt Marmoset\u2019s aging quietly. I\u2019ve just finished venting my spleen with a scathing letter to Ames. As for Evan\u2014\u201d She swept a hand toward her brother, who\u2019d taken a seat by the fire. \u201cEvan\u2019s sitting with his precious agricultural newspapers and trying to pretend he\u2019s not a tightly wound ball of seething passions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Evan lowered his newspaper and regarded his sister over it. \u201cI do not seethe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you seethe. You seethe the way other men drink brandy. A little bit daily as a matter of habit, and more than\u2019s good for you when you think no one\u2019s looking.\u201d</p><p>With a bored sigh, Lord Drewe turned his gaze to Kate. \u201cDo I have the appearance of a man who seethes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all,\u201d Kate answered, studying his calm expression and unperturbed green eyes. \u201cYou look the picture of equanimity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere, Harriet. Satisfied?\u201d He raised his newspaper again.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t let appearances fool you, Miss Taylor,\u201d Lark whispered. \u201cMy brother only looks even-tempered. He has fought no fewer than five duels in his life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFive duels?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes.\u201d Lark\u2019s eyes brightened. She counted them down her fingers. \u201cLet\u2019s see. There was the one for Calista. Before that, three for Harry\u2014\u201d</p><p>Kate looked to Harry, who was dressed today in the same divided skirt and tailored waistcoat. The outfit was something like a riding habit, only . . . there were no horses about.</p><p>\u201cMy goodness, Lady Harriet. Three?\u201d</p><p>Harry shrugged as she folded and sealed her letter. \u201cMy season was eventful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd one for Claire,\u201d Lark finished, reaching her little finger.</p><p>\u201cClaire?\u201d Kate asked. \u201cWho is Claire?\u201d</p><p>Aunt Marmoset lifted her brows. \u201cWe don\u2019t talk about Claire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo the contrary,\u201d Lord Drewe said from behind his paper. \u201cYou all talk about Claire a great deal. I refuse to join the discussion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you prefer seething,\u201d said Harry.</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s not kind to speak ill of the dead.\u201d The tone of his voice told everyone the conversation was finished. A snap of newspaper served as punctuation.</p><p>The ensuing silence was awkward.</p><p>\u201cOh, dear,\u201d said Lark. \u201cI was hoping to avoid it. But Harry, I think you had better acquaint Miss Taylor with the truth.\u201d</p><p>The truth?</p><p>\u201cWhat is the truth?\u201d Kate asked. Her heart pounded in her chest. Perhaps Thorne was right, and they\u2019d been hiding something from her.</p><p>Harry put away all her ink and paper. \u201cThe truth is . . . as aristocratic families go, we Gramercys aren\u2019t what you might call\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCivilized,\u201d Aunt Marmoset suggested.</p><p>\u201cTypical,\u201d Harry finished. \u201cIt goes back to our childhood, I think. We spent the entirety of it up North, at Rook\u2019s Fell. Enormous old place, more cobweb than mortar in its walls. Our father suffered with a very prolonged, debilitating illness, and our mother was devoted to his care. The servants couldn\u2019t make us mind, and no thought was ever given to school. No one expected Evan would inherit the title, of course. It was to stay in your father\u2019s line. So we simply ran wild, like vines in a neglected garden. Until Aunt Marmoset came to mind us, and even then it was too late for us older ones. Except for dear, sweet Lark there, we\u2019ve all of us grown up twisted in some way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwisted?\u201d Lark echoed. \u201cHarry, you do make it sound so perverse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf Kate is to associate with us, she should know. The plain fact of it is, we are not really \u2018good society.\u2019 But we are obscenely rich, highly ranked, and so utterly fascinating the ton cannot look away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s going to change,\u201d Lord Drewe said. \u201cThe \u2018good society\u2019 part. I am determined that Lark will have the debut she deserves. I have failed twice to bring out my sisters with any success. Harriet\u2019s season was an unmitigated debacle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly if you judge by Society\u2019s standards.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is the entire point of a season. To be judged by Society\u2019s standards. And by the end of your season, we were not only judged by Society, but convicted, sentenced, pilloried, and exiled for the better part of a decade.\u201d Lord Drewe folded his papers, set them aside and massaged the bridge of his nose. \u201cCalista never even made it to London.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t want to,\u201d Lark said. To Kate, she explained, \u201cShe fell in love with Mr. Parker, the stable master. Now they live together at Rook\u2019s Fell, and we cleared out this summer to give them run of the place. Calista always did love horses, and she and Parker have turned their efforts to breeding.\u201d</p><p>Aunt Marmoset tittered with laughter. Kate tried not to join her.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Lark looked around, bemused. \u201cWhat have I said now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d Harry assured her. \u201cDo not think on it, chicken. You are everything good and pure, that\u2019s all.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Lark turned to Kate and gave her an uncertain smile. \u201cThere you have it. To be a Gramercy is to be embroiled in one scandal after another, it seems. Do you despise us already? Do you want us to leave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all.\u201d She looked around the room. \u201cI\u2019m so happy, I can\u2019t tell you. I\u2019m delighted that you\u2019re not fusty and proper, or I don\u2019t know how I\u2019d ever fit in. I\u2019m in heaven just sitting here, listening to you talk and tease and turn the pages of your newspapers. You can\u2019t know what a pleasure it is for me, to be in the presence of a family. Any family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are not just any family,\u201d Lark said. \u201cWe may be your family.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf you\u2019ll have us,\u201d Harry said. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t blame you if you won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Kate looked around at their earnestly hopeful faces. \u201cIn all my life, there\u2019s never been anything I wanted more.\u201d</p><p>But as she spoke the words, they had the faintly acid taste of a lie. Earlier that day, she\u2019d craved a man\u2019s touch with a fierce, primal intensity. She\u2019d wanted it more than comfort, more than family. More than breath. Beneath her skin, her muscles still yearned and ached.</p><p>She closed her eyes and willed the forbidden feelings away. \u201cI only wish there was some way we could be certain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve begun inquiries,\u201d Lord Drewe said. \u201cI\u2019ve already sent letters directing my man of business to Margate, to see what he can stir up there. We\u2019re also exploring other avenues.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t suppose it\u2019s too much to hope that you might . . . remember something?\u201d Lark asked. \u201cI don\u2019t want to pressure you, but we thought that perhaps after seeing the portrait and being around our family, some forgotten detail might shake loose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps it will in time. But truly, I have so few memories.\u201d Kate let her eyes go unfocused. \u201cI\u2019ve tried, so many times, to recall. It\u2019s as though I\u2019m traveling down a dark, endless corridor, and my past is at the end of it. And I know . . . I just know . . . if I could open the door at the end of that corridor, I\u2019d remember everything. But I never quite get there. I only hear pianoforte music, and I have some memory of the color blue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps it\u2019s the pendant,\u201d Lark said. She fetched the portrait from the mantelpiece. \u201cThe one about her neck, see?\u201d</p><p>Kate looked closely. She\u2019d noticed the pendant before\u2014but in the dark last night, it had appeared to be black. Now she could see that it was actually a deep, almost indigo blue. Too dark to be a sapphire. Perhaps lapis?</p><p>She lifted her head, excited. \u201cI suppose that could be the blue I recall. Especially if my mother wore it always.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe must have done,\u201d said Harry. \u201cShe even wore it when she wore nothing at all.\u201d</p> <p>Kate startled. \u201cOh. And there\u2019s a little song. A song about flowers.\u201d</p><p>She sang it all the way through for them, beginning with, \u201cSee the garden of blossoms so fair . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been lodged in my memory all my life, but in all my years of teaching music, I\u2019ve never met anyone else who knew that song. I always fancied my mother sang it to me. Is it familiar to any of you?\u201d</p><p>The Gramercys shook their heads.</p><p>\u201cBut the fact that we don\u2019t know the song doesn\u2019t mean anything,\u201d Lark said. \u201cWe never would have met your mother at all.\u201d</p><p>Kate\u2019s shoulders relaxed. \u201cIt would be nice if that could have been the link. The proof. But I suppose it was too much too hope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing is too much to hope.\u201d Aunt Marmoset patted her hand. \u201cAnd dear, we really must decide what to call you. If you\u2019re family, \u2018Miss Taylor\u2019 just doesn\u2019t seem right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not even my name at all,\u201d Kate admitted. \u201cThe surname Taylor was assigned to me at Margate. Really, I\u2019d love it if you\u2019d call me Kate. All my friends do.\u201d</p> <p>Even though her full name had been listed as Katherine, she\u2019d always gone by Kate. It simply fit. \u201cKatherine\u201d sounded too refined and regal. \u201cKitty\u201d brought to mind a flighty young girl. But \u201cKate\u201d sounded like a sensible, clever young woman with lots of friends.</p><p>She was a \u201cKate.\u201d</p><p>Except to someone, somewhere, she\u2019d once been \u201cKatie.\u201d</p><p>Be brave, my Katie.</p><p>And today, when Thorne had pinned her to the ground, acting with courage to guard her life with his own\u2014even if the threat was a wayward fruit, rather than a mortar shell\u2014he\u2019d called her \u201cKatie,\u201d too. So strange.</p><p>\u201cWill you show us the local sights?\u201d Lark asked. \u201cI\u2019m dying to explore that old castle on the bluffs.\u201d</p><p>Kate bit her lip. \u201cPerhaps we should save that for tomorrow. The militia are undertaking some drills. But I\u2019d be delighted to give you a tour of the church.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHold that thought.\u201d Lord Drewe held back the curtain. \u201cI believe our things have arrived.\u201d</p><p>Kate watched, amazed, as a caravan of one, two . . . three carriages pulled up before the Queen\u2019s Ruby, all of them bursting with valises and trunks. They must have contained enough belongings and supplies to launch a small colony.</p><p>\u201cThank the Lord,\u201d said Aunt Marmoset. \u201cI\u2019m down to my last three spice drops.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Nine</p><p>Thorne was a man of habit.</p><p>That evening, after all the men had left, he returned to his solitary quarters\u2014one of the four turrets that comprised the Rycliff Castle keep. He brushed the dust from his officer\u2019s coat and polished his boots to a fresh shine, so they\u2019d be ready the next day.</p><p>Then he sat down at the small, simple table to review the day\u2019s events.</p><p>This, too, was routine. In the infantry, he\u2019d served under then-Lieutenant Colonel Bramwell, now Lord General Rycliff. After every battle, Rycliff would sit down with his maps and journals to painstakingly recreate the order of events. Thorne would help him to recall the details. Together, they laid it all out before them. What had happened, exactly? Where had key decisions been taken? Where had ground been gained, lives been lost?</p><p>Most importantly, they asked themselves this: Could anything have been done differently, to achieve a more favorable outcome?</p><p>In most cases, they arrived honestly at the same answer: no. Given a chance, they would do the same again. The ritual dampened any whispers of guilt or regret. Left unchecked, such whispers could become echoes\u2014bouncing off the walls of a man\u2019s skull. Growing louder, faster, more dangerous over weeks and months and years.</p><p>Thorne knew the echoes. He had enough of them rattling around his brain already. He didn\u2019t need any more. So tonight he poured himself a tumbler of whiskey and reviewed the events of his most recent conflict.</p><p>The Melon Siege.</p><p>Could he have reasonably predicted the danger to Miss Taylor?</p><p>He didn\u2019t think so. The trebuchet had been firing reliably seaward, if with varying degrees of strength. Sir Lewis had said afterward he could not have replicated that trajectory if he tried. A freak accident, nothing more.</p><p>Had he acted rightly to tackle her?</p><p>Again he could not regret his actions. Even if he\u2019d been aware that the missile was a melon, he likely would have done the same. Had the fruit been any less ripe, it might not have exploded on contact. She could have been seriously injured. Thorne\u2019s head was still pounding from the impact.</p><p>No, it was everything that came afterward. That was where he\u2019d gone wrong. The shock had rocketed him to some other place. A place filled with smoke and the stench of blood. He\u2019d found himself crawling on his belly toward the sound of her voice. For miles, it seemed, collecting scrapes on his knees and hands. Until he found the source\u2014a clear, calm pool of water amidst the ugliness, with her face reflecting up at him instead of his own. He\u2019d lowered his face to drink from it, lapping up that cool, refreshing peace. But it wasn\u2019t enough. He\u2019d wanted to bathe in her, drown in her.</p><p>That kiss . . .</p><p>Even when he came to his senses, he hadn\u2019t pulled back. Not immediately, as he should have done. He\u2019d never forgive himself for that. He could have truly hurt her.</p><p>But Lord. She\u2019d been so sweet.</p><p>He lifted\u2014and swiftly gulped\u2014the tumbler of whiskey. Didn\u2019t help. Even a second dose of liquid fire couldn\u2019t burn her taste from his lips. He let his pounding head fall back until it met with the uneven stone wall.</p><p>So sweet. So soft in his arms. Christ, she\u2019d been under him, every bit as warm and alive as he\u2019d known she would be. Stroking his face and his hair, murmuring gentle words. The recollection made his chest ache and his groin tighten.</p><p>Good God. Good God.</p><p>He sipped the liquor again. As he forced the swallow down, a groan of raw pain and longing rose in his chest. All the whiskey in the bottle couldn\u2019t numb this ache.</p><p>But he knew one thing.</p><p>This lusting stopped here. With these queer, mysterious Gramercys in the picture, she needed his protection. He needed to keep his wits sharp. If he came too close, he risked compromising her and losing his own focus. So there could be no more closeness. Only the bare minimum of contact. Handing her down from carriages and the like. Perhaps he\u2019d be pressed to offer his arm on occasion.</p><p>But on this, he was resolved\u2014</p><p>There would be no more kisses. Ever.</p><p>Someone pounded on the door.</p><p>\u201cCorporal Thorne! Corporal Thorne, come out.\u201d</p><p>Thorne\u2019s heart kicked into a gallop. He thrust his feet into his boots and punched to a standing position. As he made for the door, he snagged his coat from its hook.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d He flung open the door to view a red-faced, out-of-breath Rufus Bright.</p><p>The young man\u2019s eyes were serious. \u201cSir, you\u2019re needed down in the village at once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere? What\u2019s happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Bull and Blossom. And I can\u2019t describe it, sir. You\u2019ll see when you get there.\u201d</p><p>That was all Thorne needed to hear. He broke into a run. From there it was a footrace with trouble\u2014which particular kind of trouble, he hated to imagine. Was she sick? In danger? Had the Gramercys heard about the melon incident and departed in disgust, leaving her heartbroken and alone?</p><p>Damn, damn, damn.</p><p>Walking from the castle to the village normally took about twenty minutes. Going this direction, he had the advantage of the downslope\u2014but with the light fading, a man had to watch his step.</p><p>Nevertheless, Thorne would venture no more than five minutes had passed by the time he reached the bottom of the path and plunged into the village lanes. A few moments later he was tearing across the green and throwing open the tavern door.</p><p>Bloody hell. It seemed that every soul in Spindle Cove was packed into the place. He saw villagers, militiamen, ladies from the Queen\u2019s Ruby. Like fish in a net they were, just a mass of wriggling bodies with gaping mouths.</p><p>To a one, they turned and hushed as he burst through the doorway. Thorne could imagine why. He was panting, sweating, growling, and furious with the need to know just what the hell was going on.</p><p>But he was so winded, he hadn\u2019t the breath for extensive questioning. Only three words mattered, in his mind. He used the last of his air to bark them out.</p><p>\u201cWhere is she?\u201d</p><p>The crowd rustled and sorted itself, pushing Miss Taylor forward as if she were the wheat amid the chaff.</p><p>He swept his gaze up her body, then studied her face. She was whole, and not bleeding. Her eyes were clear, not red with tears. That alone was enough to make her the most beautiful thing he\u2019d ever beheld. As far as he was concerned, her low-cut, fitted yellow gown was merely in the way. She had better not be bruised or broken under all that shimmering silk.</p><p>\u201cSurprise,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA . . .\u201d He worked for breath. \u201c . . . A party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. An engagement party. For us.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He swept a look around the crowded tavern. This might have started as a party. It was going to end as someone\u2019s funeral.</p><p>\u201cWasn\u2019t it a nice idea?\u201d She forced a smile. \u201cYour militiamen planned it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, did they?\u201d</p> <p>Thorne turned to the bar, where his militiamen stood in a lazy, substandard line. Pursing their lips like buglers, to keep from laughing aloud.</p><p>He wanted to murder them all. One by one by one. Unluckily for them, he\u2019d left his pistol at the castle. But there had to be knives in this place.</p><p>She took a few steps closer. With every labored breath he drew, he now got a dizzying lungful of her lemon-clover scent. It calmed him in some ways and inflamed him in others.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t my idea,\u201d she murmured at the floorboards. \u201cI can see you were frightened. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot frightened,\u201d he replied curtly.</p> <p>Just ready to fight. And she needed to stop looking so pained, or he\u2019d be seriously tempted to put his fist through the wall.</p><p>Fosbury, the tavern keeper and confectioner, came out from the kitchen wearing an embroidered apron and bearing a large tray. \u201cCome along, Corporal Thorne. Even you have to celebrate sometime. Look, I made you a cake.\u201d</p><p>Thorne looked at the cake.</p><p>It was baked in the shape of a melon, iced with green. There were letters swimming on it\u2014they spelled out congratulatory wishes, he supposed\u2014but he was too angry and exhausted to push them together into words. Heaped atop all his other frustrations, that last insult to his pride was enough to turn his vision red.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a fly on it,\u201d he said.</p><p>Fosbury bristled. \u201cNo, there\u2019s not.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere is. Look close. In the center.\u201d</p><p>The tavern keeper bent his head and peered closely at the center of the cake.</p><p>Thorne grabbed him by the hair and pushed downward, mashing his face straight into the icing. The man came up blinking and sputtering through a mask of green, sugary scum.</p><p>\u201cDo you see it now?\u201d Thorne asked.</p><p>A thick glob of piped icing fell from Fosbury\u2019s brow. It landed with an audible plop. The entire room had gone silent.</p><p>They were all staring at him, aghast. What\u2019s the matter with you? their horrified looks said. We\u2019re your neighbors and friends. Don\u2019t you know how to enjoy a party?</p><p>No. He didn\u2019t.</p><p>No one had given him a party before. Never in his life. And the way everyone was staring at him, it was clear that no one would ever dare to give him one again.</p> <p>Then it started. Just a light ripple of musical sound, coming from Miss Taylor\u2019s direction. It grew louder, gained strength, until it was a full-force cascade.</p><p>She was laughing. Laughing at him, laughing at the stupid cake, laughing at Fosbury\u2019s green-covered face. Her peals of melodious, good-natured laughter rang from the exposed ceiling timbers and shivered through his ribs.</p><p>Before Thorne\u2019s heart could remember its rhythm, everyone else was laughing, too. Even Fosbury. The mood went from black to some iridescent color only found in rainbows and seashells. The party was a party again.</p><p>Damn. If only he had it in him to love, to give her what she needed\u2014he would claim her for his own and keep her so very close. To tease him, to kiss him back from the shadows, to laugh merrily when he terrorized his friends. To make him feel almost human, every once in while.</p><p>If only.</p><p>\u201cFor goodness\u2019 sake,\u201d she said, still laughing behind her cupped hand. \u201cSomeone fetch the poor man a cloth.\u201d</p><p>A giggling serving girl handed a rag over the counter, and Miss Taylor took the cake from Fosbury\u2019s hands so he could wipe his face clean.</p><p>She stuck her finger in the mussed icing, then held Thorne\u2019s gaze while she sucked it clean. \u201cDelicious.\u201d She held the cake out. \u201cCare to try?\u201d</p><p>God above. No man could resist that. He had to take at least this much.</p><p>He reached\u2014not for the cake, but for her wrist. While she stared at him, wide-eyed, he dipped her finger in the icing and brought it to his own mouth.</p><p>He sucked the creamy, sugary confection from her finger, and then he sucked the sweeter treat that was her bare fingertip, working his tongue up, down, and around it. The same way he would savor her nipple, or that hidden nub between her legs.</p><p>She gave a little gasp, and he fancied he heard pleasure in it. If she were his, he\u2019d have her making that sound every night.</p><p>He released her hand and pronounced, \u201cDelicious indeed.\u201d</p><p>A raucous whoop went up from the assembled crowd.</p><p>She gave him a chastening look. Her cheeks were as red as his coat.</p><p>He shrugged, unapologetic. \u201cIt\u2019s our engagement party. Just giving them what they came to see.\u201d</p><p>Sometime later, Kate was seated at a corner table with Thorne and the Gramercys. Slices of half-eaten cake sat before each place.</p><p>She was having a difficult time attending conversation\u2014not only because the tavern had only grown louder after two rounds of drinks, but because her thoughts were entirely absorbed by a tongue.</p><p>His tongue.</p><p>She\u2019d gained a great deal of familiarity with that tongue today. It was nimble, impertinent, and had a way of ending in places she wasn\u2019t expecting. It also gave her an inordinate amount of pleasure, when he wasn\u2019t employing it to send her harsh words.</p><p>But right now, perhaps his tongue was fatigued from the day\u2019s exertions, because he wasn\u2019t using it. At all. He\u2019d been sitting at this table for a half hour, at least, and hadn\u2019t spoken a word.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you tell us how you and Corporal Thorne met,\u201d Aunt Marmoset said.</p><p>Kate sent a nervous glance in Thorne\u2019s direction. \u201cOh, no. It\u2019s a boring story.\u201d</p><p>Harry lifted her wine. \u201cIt can\u2019t be a more boring topic than estate management and agriculture, and that\u2019s all we ever hear from Evan.\u201d</p><p>Beneath the table, Kate twisted her fingers in her lap. There was no way she could spin a plausible tale of courtship. She didn\u2019t want to lie to the Gramercys at all, and Thorne\u2019s taciturn presence across the table would only undermine any tales of romance she might concoct.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a year,\u201d she said. \u201cSo long ago. Truthfully, I\u2019m not even sure I could remember the time and place of our first\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was here.\u201d</p><p>The reply came from Thorne. The silent oracle had spoken. The collective surprise was such that the glassware rattled on the table.</p><p>Even more astonishing\u2014he appeared to have yet more to say.</p><p>\u201cI arrived with Lord Rycliff last summer, to help assemble the local militia. Our first day in the village, we entered this tea shop.\u201d</p><p>Lord Drewe looked around. \u201cI thought this was a tavern.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a tea shop then,\u201d Kate explained. \u201cCalled the Blushing Pansy. But since last summer, it\u2019s been the Bull and Blossom. Part tea shop, part tavern.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo go on,\u201d urged Aunt Marmoset. \u201cYou came in to the tea shop, and . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd it was a Saturday,\u201d Thorne said. \u201cAll the ladies were here for their weekly salon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d said Lark with excitement. \u201cI see where this is going. Miss Taylor was playing the pianoforte. Or the harp.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSinging. She was singing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe sings?\u201d Drewe looked to Kate. \u201cWe must have you perform.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a rare thing to hear her,\u201d Thorne said. \u201cToo often, she\u2019s accompanying one of her pupils instead. But that first day, she was singing.\u201d</p><p>Dreamy-eyed, Lark propped her chin with one hand. \u201cAnd right there, that first moment, you were struck by her celestial voice and rare, ethereal beauty.\u201d</p><p>Kate cringed. Celestial? Lark was taking it much too far. Surely he\u2019d balk at confirming that.</p><p>Thorne cleared his throat. \u201cSomething like it.\u201d</p><p>Lark sighed. \u201cSo romantic.\u201d</p><p>Of all the words Kate had never expected to hear applied to Thorne, \u201cso romantic\u201d had to rank near the very top. Right beneath \u201ctalkative,\u201d \u201cdainty,\u201d and \u201cchoirboy.\u201d She had to admit, he was doing an admirable job of making this sound believable, without resorting to lies. He must have worried she\u2019d give away the truth, with all her hesitant stammering on the subject.</p><p>\u201cWhat was she wearing?\u201d This question came from Lord Drewe. It had the sound of a quiz, not friendly curiosity. As if he didn\u2019t believe Thorne was telling the truth.</p><p>\u201cLord Drewe, it was a year ago,\u201d Kate interjected lightly, trying to divert this line of questioning. She was lucky they\u2019d progressed this far without a misstep. \u201cEven I don\u2019t remember what I was wearing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhite.\u201d Thorne regarded Lord Drewe across the table. \u201cShe was wearing white muslin. And an India shawl embroidered with peacocks. Her hair was dressed with blue ribbons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that true?\u201d Lark asked Kate.</p><p>\u201cI . . . If Corporal Thorne says so, I suppose it must be.\u201d</p><p>Kate struggled to conceal her shock. She remembered that shawl. It had been on loan from Mrs. Lange. Since she was angry with the husband who\u2019d given it to her, she\u2019d let Kate have use of the shawl all last summer. But Kate never imagined that Thorne would recall it. Much less the matching peacock ribbons in her hair.</p><p>She stole a glance at him as the serving girl removed the empty glasses. Had he truly been \u201cstruck by her\u201d that day, the way Lark said?</p><p>\u201cSo he clapped eyes on you right here in the Spindle Cove tea shop,\u201d Lark said dramatically, \u201cand he knew at once\u2014he must make you his own.\u201d</p><p>Kate\u2019s cheeks burned with embarrassment. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know nothing of men, goose,\u201d Harry said. \u201cIt\u2019s been a whole year. Corporal Thorne is a man of action. Just look at him. If he\u2019d made up his mind to have her, he would have done so long before now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee, he didn\u2019t like me,\u201d Kate said. \u201cNot at first. Perhaps there was some superficial attraction, but no emotions were involved.\u201d She looked at him over her wineglass. \u201cHe didn\u2019t feel a thing for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I won\u2019t believe that.\u201d Aunt Marmoset unwrapped another spice drop. \u201cI think he liked you too well, dear. And he made up his mind to stay away.\u201d</p><p>Kate looked to Thorne. She found him staring back at her with unnerving intensity.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d Lark asked him. \u201cDoes my aunt have it right?\u201d</p><p>Does she? Kate asked him silently.</p><p>She didn\u2019t know what answer to read in those ice-blue eyes, but she discerned there was a great deal going on behind them. For a man who claimed to feel nothing . . . the \u201cnothing\u201d went very deep.</p><p>\u201cMiss Taylor, are you going to keep our new friends all to yourself?\u201d</p><p>Kate shook herself back to the present. Mrs. Highwood stood behind her, Diana and Charlotte in tow.</p><p>\u201cIntroduce us, dear,\u201d the matron said through a clenched smile.</p><p>\u201cYes, of course.\u201d She rose, and so did the men at the table. \u201cLord Drewe, Lady Harriet, Lady Lark, and Aunt Marmoset, may I introduce Mrs. Highwood and her daughters, Diana and Charlotte.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a third daughter,\u201d Mrs. Highwood said loftily, \u201cbut she is lately married. To the Viscount Payne of Northumberland.\u201d The older woman turned and made a strange, awkward motion with her fan.</p><p>\u201cCongratulations,\u201d Lark said, smiling at the matron and her daughters. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen you in the rooming house, but it\u2019s a pleasure to be properly introduced.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course,\u201d said Mrs. Highwood. \u201cWhat a boon it is to have a family of your caliber in Spindle Cove. We are quite starved for society this summer.\u201d Once again she turned and made the same swoop of her fan.</p><p>\u201cAre you swatting a wasp?\u201d asked Aunt Marmoset.</p><p>\u201cOh, no.\u201d Mrs. Highwood flicked an agitated gaze toward the same corner of the room. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing. Will you excuse me for just a moment?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As Kate\u2014and all the Gramercys\u2014looked on, the matron turned away, walked two steps, and hurled her closed fan with such force that it smacked an unsuspecting man on the back of the head.</p><p>\u201cMusic,\u201d she half growled. \u201cNow.\u201d</p><p>The man rubbed his head, offended, but he drew out a fiddle and began to saw a few creaky strains of a dance. Around the tavern, guests came to their feet to clear tables and chairs.</p> <p>\u201cOh, look,\u201d said Mrs. Highwood, turning back to the Gramercys with an innocent smile. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be dancing. What a happy surprise.\u201d</p><p>Kate shook her head, dismayed. Of course the woman would do anything in her power to engineer a dance between her eldest daughter and Lord Drewe. But dancing wasn\u2019t a good idea for Diana. The last time she\u2019d danced with a lord in this tavern, Diana had suffered a serious breathing crisis.</p><p>\u201cLord Drewe, I do hope you will honor us with a dance,\u201d said Mrs. Highwood. \u201cSpindle Cove offers no shortage of lovely partners.\u201d She nudged Diana a step forward. \u201cAhem.\u201d</p><p>Kate began to grow truly panicked. She didn\u2019t know how to stop this. Even if he had no interest, Lord Drewe would not embarrass Diana with a refusal. And Diana was too shy and sweet to countermand her mother in company.</p><p>She cast a frantic, pleading glance at Thorne. He must understand what was going on. But unlike the others involved, he wasn\u2019t the sort to let etiquette stop him from doing something about it.</p> <p>Standing tall, he lifted his voice and called to the fiddler. \u201cNo dancing. Not tonight.\u201d</p><p>The music died a quick, plaintive death. Around the room, guests muttered with discontent. Once again Thorne had single-handedly destroyed the celebratory spirit.</p><p>Only Kate knew the true reason, and it wasn\u2019t surliness. Neither was it a lack of empathy.</p><p>Quite the opposite. There was good in him. Raw, molten goodness, bubbling deep in his core. But he didn\u2019t possess the charm or manners to control it. It just erupted periodically in volcano fashion, startling anyone who happened to be nearby. Whether they were neighbors he prevented from dancing or teary-eyed spinsters he kissed in fields of heather.</p><p>He recalled the color of her hair ribbons on the first day they met. And she\u2019d been blind to his essential nature all this time.</p><p>\u201cOf course we can\u2019t have any dancing,\u201d Diana said, restoring peace with a smile. \u201cHow could we think of it, when we haven\u2019t yet raised a glass to the happy couple?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d someone called. \u201cThere must be a toast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll say something. I\u2019m the host.\u201d Fosbury raised a glass from behind the bar. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be speaking out of turn to say this betrothal came as quite the surprise to everyone in Spindle Cove.\u201d</p><p>Kate glanced at Lord Drewe, worried he\u2019d suspect something was amiss.</p><p>Fosbury continued, \u201cFor a year, we\u2019ve all been watching these two square off on opposites of every argument. I had it on good authority that Miss Taylor had diagnosed Corporal Thorne as possessing a stone for a heart and having rocks in his head.\u201d</p><p>A wave of laughter rippled through the crowd.</p><p>\u201cAnd considering these infirmities\u201d\u2014the tavern keeper stretched his glass in Thorne\u2019s direction\u2014\u201cwho would have thought the corporal could make so wise a choice?\u201d He smiled at Kate. \u201cWe\u2019re all terrible fond of you, m\u2019dear. I think I speak for the entire militia when I say\u2014we wouldn\u2019t let you go to anyone less worthy. Or less capable of calling us up on court-martial.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHear hear!\u201d</p><p>Everyone laughed and drank, and the collective affection in the room created a knot in Kate\u2019s throat. But it was another emotion that made her chest ache.</p> <p>Fosbury was right. Over the past year, she\u2019d abused Thorne thoroughly, to his face and behind his back, when he\u2019d done nothing more egregious than ignore her. After tonight, she suspected all that neglect had been his clumsy attempt at chivalry.</p><p>Here she was, surrounded by friends\u2014and possibly family\u2014who believed her to be in love with the man. Engaged to marry him. But in reality, she knew she\u2019d treated him ill.</p><p>He told her he had no feelings to hurt, but no one could be completely without emotion. And if all Thorne\u2019s brusqueness had goodness beneath . . .</p><p>What sort of heart was hidden under all those staunch denials?</p><p>She regarded him now: arms crossed, face hard, eyes glazed with ice. He was a living suit of armor. If she listened hard enough, she might even hear him creak as he walked.</p><p>He wouldn\u2019t surrender any secrets willingly. If she wanted to know what was truly inside the man, she would have to crack him open to find out. It seemed a dangerous proposition, and a sensible, clever young woman\u2014a \u201cKate\u201d\u2014would turn and run the other way.</p><p>But she wasn\u2019t a \u201cKate\u201d to him. He\u2019d called her Katie. And Katie was a courageous girl, even in the face of her fears.</p><p>Be brave, my Katie.</p><p>Yes. She would need to be.</p><p>Chapter Ten</p><p>\u201cI must say, that\u2019s a true disappointment. He hasn\u2019t any phallus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Kate asked, laughing.</p><p>When they\u2019d reached their picnic spot, Harry placed her hands on her hips, clenched her teeth around a cheroot, and regarded the immense green slope a few pastures distant.</p><p>\u201cNo phallus at all.\u201d She exhaled a puff of smoke. \u201cAnd here I had such high hopes, considering he\u2019s known as \u2018the Long Man\u2019.\u201d</p><p>Kate exchanged amused glances with Lark. They both turned to regard the giant outline of a man carved into the chalk hillside. The ancient figure ranged over the entire slope, standing out in white lines against green.</p><p>\u201cAmes and I went to see the Cerne Abbas carving in Dorset,\u201d Harry went on. \u201cThe giant depicted on their hillside is magnificently pagan. He has a horrific grimace on his face, and he\u2019s waving a big, knobby club in his hand. Not to mention, sporting a monumental erection.\u201d</p><p>Lord Drewe frowned. \u201cReally, Harriet. That\u2019s enough discussion of phalluses. I don\u2019t see why you and Ames should even care.\u201d</p><p>Harry sent her brother a look. \u201cIt\u2019s an artistic appreciation.\u201d She gestured at the ancient carving on the slope. \u201cThis one\u2019s just an outline. No facial expression whatsoever. Rather rigid and staid-looking, isn\u2019t he? And confined, locked up between those two lines.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think they\u2019re staffs,\u201d Kate suggested. \u201cSo perhaps that\u2019s some consolation. He\u2019s missing the monumental erection, but he does have two impressive staffs.\u201d</p><p>Harry took the cheroot from her mouth and gave her a shocked look. \u201cWhy, Miss Kate Taylor.\u201d</p><p>Kate knew a moment of pure distress. What had she been thinking, to overstep and speak so crudely? The Gramercys were the aristocracy. She was their poor relation at best, and a complete stranger at worst. Just because Harry could make scandalous jokes, that didn\u2019t mean she should do the same.</p><p>Harry turned to her brother. \u201cI like her. She can stay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe stays, whether you like her or not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose that\u2019s right,\u201d Harry said. \u201cIf amiability were a requirement for inclusion in this family, Bennett should have been handed his permanent exile years ago.\u201d</p><p>Kate breathed a sigh of relief. She couldn\u2019t cease marveling at the notion that she might be a part of this. This wild, impolitic, eccentric, creative assortment of individuals. They liked her.</p><p>Now, if only Thorne would join in. The pagan figure carved on the distant hillside was a more active participant in the conversation.</p><p>He\u2019d separated himself from the group, on the excuse of letting Badger tumble through the heather. As she looked closely, Kate thought he had the dog engaged in a training exercise. However, she couldn\u2019t follow quite what he was training Badger to do, because she kept getting distracted by the flexing of his thighs whenever he crouched to praise or correct the pup.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t only his physical firmness that drew her attention. His character was solid, too. She\u2019d long known him to be stern and immutable, but since their engagement party, Kate was beginning to glimpse the good qualities his silence masked. Patience, confidence, steadfastness. Such traits didn\u2019t clamor for attention. They just quietly . . . existed, waiting to be noticed.</p><p>She\u2019d made it her hobby these past few days\u2014noticing. And the more she noticed, the more she yearned to know more.</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s a lovely view for a picnic,\u201d Aunt Marmoset said, joining them. \u201cI do enjoy gazing upon a well-carved man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s called \u2018the Long Man of Wilmington,\u2019 Aunt Marmoset.\u201d Lark scribbled in her journal.</p><p>\u201cHow odd. I\u2019d been under the impression his name was Corporal Thorne.\u201d Aunt Marmoset came and put her hand in Kate\u2019s pocket. \u201cMy dear, hold onto that one. Tightly, and with all four limbs.\u201d</p><p>Kate blushed. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you do. We have similar tastes.\u201d</p><p>The old lady withdrew her hand, leaving Kate\u2019s pocket oddly heavier\u2014full of spice drops, she assumed.</p><p>\u201cRemember what I told you,\u201d Aunt Marmoset whispered. \u201cStrong. Overwhelming at first. But with a bit of work, you arrive at the sweetness.\u201d</p><p>Kate had to laugh. \u201cI am coming to adore you, Aunt Marmoset. Even if you\u2019re not truly my aunt.\u201d</p><p>Over the past few days, she had begun to sort out the web of Gramercy family relationships. She knew Harry had meant it as a joke the first night, but she secretly had made herself a chart. Aunt Marmoset was Evan\u2019s mother\u2019s sister, come to live with the family when their father took ill. Therefore, the old lady was not a Gramercy and no potential blood relationship to Kate whatsoever. But that fact didn\u2019t seem to diminish Aunt Marmoset\u2019s efforts to welcome her with warmth and good humor and a great many spice drops.</p><p>All the Gramercys had blended in with Spindle Cove life. Drewe had rightly pointed out that the village was a haven for unconventional ladies\u2014and Harry, Lark, and Aunt Marmoset certainly met the standard. They\u2019d been enjoying regular activities with the other ladies: country walks, sea-bathing, making decorations for the fair.</p><p>But today the family had decided on an outing\u2014not only to satisfy Harry\u2019s curiosity about the Long Man, but to give them time alone. In the village, they\u2019d still kept the possibility of kinship a secret. Here, they could speak freely.</p><p>Kate haltingly approached Lord Drewe. As always, his aristocratic presence and sheer male splendor humbled her. His gloves alone . . . they held her rapt. They were things of seamless, caramel-colored perfection, encasing deft, elegant hands.</p><p>\u201cAny news from your men of business?\u201d She hated to pry, but she knew from Sally that he\u2019d had several expresses since arriving in Spindle Cove.</p><p>\u201cNo information of value at Margate,\u201d he said regretfully. \u201cNo information at all.\u201d</p><p>Kate only wished she could claim surprise.</p><p>\u201cBut now they\u2019re canvassing the area around Ambervale, looking for any servants from Simon\u2019s time. Perhaps one of them would remember Elinor and the babe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds like a possibility.\u201d If a slim one.</p><p>His gloved fingertips touched her elbow, drawing her gaze up to his face. \u201cI know the uncertainty is difficult to bear. For us all. Lark, in particular, is growing very attached to you. But today we should simply enjoy the outing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course.\u201d</p><p>On the flat green, two liveried servants had been working hard to erect a canvas pagoda, topped with red banners gaily striping the blue sky.</p><p>The Gramercys did nothing without a certain degree of pageantry, Kate was coming to understand. From the carriages, the footmen unloaded two large hampers stocked with a variety of savory dishes and freshly baked sweets provided by the Bull and Blossom. This might be a picnic, but it wasn\u2019t a rustic affair. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As she and Lark helped unpack and arrange a tray of jewel-bright jam tarts, Kate realized there was one question her charts hadn\u2019t helped her settle. \u201cWho is this Ames that Harry\u2019s always talking of? Another cousin? A family friend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Harriet called back, overhearing them. \u201cNot a cousin and certainly no kind of friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, Harry,\u201d Lark said. \u201cJust because the two of you had a little argument . . .\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA little argument?\u201d Aunt Marmoset scoffed. \u201cMore like a waterless reenactment of the Battle of Trafalgar, with saucers and teacups launched in place of cannonballs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmes must have been playing Lord Nelson, then,\u201d Harry replied. \u201cBecause she has been dead to me ever since.\u201d</p><p>\u201c \u2018She\u2019?\u201d Kate had been picturing someone male.</p><p>Lark sighed and drew her into confidence. \u201cWhen my sisters and I were younger, Miss Ames was our paid companion. And now . . . now she is simply Harriet\u2019s companion. Her life companion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Kate said. And then, more slowly, as the import sank in\u2014\u201cOh.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know it\u2019s not very usual. But nothing is in this family. Are you terribly scandalized?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not . . . terribly.\u201d Though the revelation certainly put a few things in perspective. \u201cBut what of all those engagements? The duels Lord Drewe fought?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarry tried her best during her season, and she loved the drama of suitors battling for her attention. But she could never go through with the weddings,\u201d Lark explained. \u201cHer heart was with Miss Ames all along. Don\u2019t let her ranting mislead you. They\u2019re devoted to one another. They\u2019ve had a falling out, but they always mend it in time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard that,\u201d Harry said. \u201cAnd you\u2019re wrong, Lark. This time, we\u2019re through. If we were true companions, as you say, she would have allowed me to accompany her to Herefordshire.\u201d</p><p>Lark tilted her head. \u201cOh, Harry. You know Miss Ames\u2019s family isn\u2019t nearly so understanding as ours.\u201d</p><p>Very few families were, Kate imagined.</p> <p>\u201cI know it well. They\u2019re horrid to her.\u201d Harry kicked at a tent pole with the squared toe of her boot. \u201cAlways have been, or else she wouldn\u2019t have needed to be a paid companion in the first place. If she\u2019d let me go along, I could have protected her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m certain she misses you sorely,\u201d Lark said.</p><p>Harry looked off at the horizon and released a sigh. \u201cI\u2019m off for a ramble. Perhaps the Long Man\u2019s phallus is embarrassingly small and only visible on closer inspection.\u201d</p><p>As Harry started off across the pastures, legs striding free in her divided skirt, Kate watched her with a twinge of sadness. Obviously, it pained her to be parted from someone she loved.</p><p>And what pained Harry, pained Kate. She was truly coming to care for these people. To lose them now would devastate her.</p><p>As if he knew her spirits needed a lift, Badger came shooting up from the meadow, attacking Kate\u2019s skirts with muddy paws, sniffing around all the refreshments and smothering her in delightfully cold, tickling kisses.</p><p>Thorne approached soon after, but offered no pawing or kisses. A keen disappointment.</p><p>Aunt Marmoset tapped Kate\u2019s shoulder and pointed. \u201cThere\u2019s a picturesque church in that direction. I noticed it as we drove by, but I couldn\u2019t make out the name. Be a dear, Kate, and satisfy my curiosity. Corporal Thorne,\u201d she added, \u201ckindly escort her.\u201d</p> <p>Kate smiled and rose to her feet, glad of the excuse to walk. She pocketed a few meat pies for Badger, and the three of them set off across the field, walking in the direction of the church.</p><p>Once they were safely out of earshot, Kate said gently, \u201cYou could try to be a little more sociable, you know.\u201d</p><p>He made a gruff noise. \u201cI\u2019m never sociable.\u201d</p><p>True enough, she supposed. \u201cWhy do you dislike the Gramercys so much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m looking out for you.\u201d He looked over his shoulder at the picnicking group. \u201cThere\u2019s something not right about those people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re unusual, I\u2019ll grant you. But it\u2019s only eccentricity. It\u2019s what makes them so amusing and interesting and lovable. It\u2019s what gives me hope that they might accept and love me. They value family bonds above scandal, disagreements, convention. Just because they\u2019re a bit odd, I don\u2019t see any reason for suspicion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do. I don\u2019t trust them or their story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d she said, hurt. The more agitated she became, the faster she walked. By now they were hurrying toward the church, and Badger ran to keep up. \u201cBecause you don\u2019t think I could possibly be related to lords and ladies?\u201d</p><p>He pulled to a halt, turned and fixed her with an intense look. \u201cIf I hadn\u2019t spent the last year thinking of you as a lady, I promise you\u2014things would be different between us.\u201d</p><p>Her face heated. Other parts of her heated, too. She hadn\u2019t regarded him this closely or directly in days, and now . . .</p><p>He was so stunning it hurt.</p><p>For a man with few manners and little grace, she now saw he was always immaculate in his attire, be it full uniform or what he wore today\u2014crisply fitted breeches and a simple, dark coat that stretched capably across his broad shoulders. Nothing was fussy, just precise. It was as though fabric didn\u2019t dare rumple in his presence. No button would be so bold as to fall out of line. His boots were polished to a blinding gloss.</p><p>And his face . . . Almost a week now since he\u2019d seen her home from Hastings, and every time she looked at him, she still found his face to be that inexplicable, unbearable degree of handsome.</p><p>\u201cMust you make this so difficult?\u201d she asked. \u201cYou must know I\u2019m all nerves, purely on the Gramercys\u2019 account. They\u2019ve been so kind. I want to be open and honest, and yet I\u2019m afraid of letting my hopes soar too high. I don\u2019t know my place with them, and that\u2019s difficult enough without feeling confused about you, too. I\u2019m pulled in too many directions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not pulling you anywhere. I\u2019m staying close enough to look out for you, without interfering.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you\u2019re interfering. You interfere with my breathing, you teasing man. I can\u2019t just ignore you, Thorne. I\u2019ve never been able to ignore you, even when I disliked you. Now I\u2019m a toy on your string, dangling on your every move and word. One minute, you\u2019re paying me no mind at all, and the next . . . you\u2019re staring at me the way you\u2019re doing now. As though you\u2019re a voracious, starving beast and I\u2019m . . .\u201d</p><p>His jaw tightened.</p><p>She gulped and finished in a whisper, \u201cEdible.\u201d</p><p>His exhalation was prolonged, measured. An impressive display of restraint.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d she prompted. \u201cYou can\u2019t deny it. There\u2019s something between us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere isn\u2019t nearly enough between us, and that\u2019s the danger. Don\u2019t you have a modest frock in your wardrobe? For God\u2019s sake, just look at that gown.\u201d</p><p>She cast a glance downward. She\u2019d dressed for the outing in her best traveling frock\u2014a handed down dove-gray silk. The hues were modest enough, and the sleeves rather long for summer. But from the direction of his gaze, she supposed he\u2019d taken an interest in the row of ribbon bows that marched down the front of the bodice, holding two edges of gray silk together across a thin slice of white lace. It was all part of the gown\u2019s design, of course, but the garment was cleverly stitched to create the illusion that just a few ribbon ties stood between demure modesty and a state of undress.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re like a gift,\u201d he said, his voice rough. \u201cAll wrapped up for someone else. A man can\u2019t look at you, but think of loosing those bows, one by one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re false bows,\u201d she stammered. \u201cThey\u2019re sewn together.\u201d</p><p>His gaze never left her bodice, surveying. Strategizing. \u201cI could rip them with my teeth.\u201d</p><p>And then what? a foolish part of her longed to ask.</p><p>They stood like that, facing one another. Saying nothing, breathing hard, and imagining far too much.</p><p>Eventually Badger nosed at her boots, impatient to be on with things. They couldn\u2019t stand here and look at each other all day. No matter how exhilarating it was.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s only physical,\u201d he said, walking on. \u201cIt will pass. You\u2019ll be able to release me soon enough.\u201d</p><p>It would have been comforting to believe so, but Kate wasn\u2019t convinced.</p><p>\u201cI need to know something of you,\u201d she said as they neared the church. \u201cLark is always asking me questions about you. About us. And I don\u2019t know how to answer. What\u2019s your birthday, to begin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t know it.\u201d</p><p>Kate felt a twinge of sadness for him, but then\u2014she\u2019d survived without a proper birthday for twenty-three years.</p><p>\u201cHow about your favorite color?\u201d</p><p>He threw a careless, sidelong glance at her frock. \u201cGray.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe serious, please. I\u2019m engaged to you, temporarily, and I know nothing of you. Nothing of your family, your history, your childhood.\u201d And after their engagement party, Kate knew he\u2019d been paying a great deal of attention to her.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to tell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat can\u2019t be true. I was raised at a miserable girls\u2019 school, but even I have amusing stories from when I was a child. There was the time it was my turn to help in the kitchens, and I decided to be creative with the seasonings for our evening soup. I accidentally dumped the entire contents of the pepper pot into the broth, and I was too afraid to own up to it. And then it was supper, and I still couldn\u2019t say a word. I\u2019ll never forget watching all my friends and teachers take that first mouthful of soup\u2014\u201d</p><p>She broke off, laughing. \u201cOh, I caught so much trouble. Everyone went to bed hungry, of course. They had me copying out Proverbs for days.\u201d</p><p>She waited for him to dredge up some similar story of youthful foolishness. Everyone must have at least one. Everyone. But she waited in vain.</p><p>Before she could ask him another question, Badger suddenly perked to attention. His funny little ears stood straight up, pointing skyward like twin church steeples. Then they flattened and he was off like a flash of lightning, streaking toward the church.</p><p>\u201cBadger, wait,\u201d she called, rushing after the pup.</p><p>Thorne paced her in easy strides. \u201cDon\u2019t call him back. He\u2019s got his sights on a hare or a rat, most likely. Chasing is what he\u2019s bred to do.\u201d</p><p>The dog darted toward the small churchyard tucked behind the main buildings. Evidently, the pup\u2019s quarry had escaped through a small hole in the bottom of the stone wall. Badger wriggled through the crack, disappearing from their view.</p><p>\u201cDrat,\u201d Kate said, breathless. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to go around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis way.\u201d</p><p>They quickly skirted the circumference of the small cemetery until they came to the wrought-iron gate. Thorne opened it, and she rushed past him, into the crowded jumble of the high-walled churchyard. Mossy, timeworn monuments tilted at various angles, like rows of rotten teeth.</p><p>\u201cBadger! Badger, where have you gone?\u201d Kate started down a row of monuments, ducking and peering at the uneven ground. Remembering the meat pie in her pocket, she fished it out and held it as a lure. \u201cHere, darling. I have a lovely treat for you.\u201d</p><p>Thorne skirted the slab of an aboveground sepulcher and came to a halt in the center of the churchyard. He whistled.</p><p>After a brief pause, Badger came bounding out from behind a bit of crumbled stone.</p><p>\u201cThank goodness. Did he catch something?\u201d Kate was almost afraid to look.</p><p>\u201cNo. But that\u2019s good. He\u2019ll run faster next time.\u201d</p><p>There was real pride in his voice. And genuine affection in the way he rubbed the dog\u2019s scruff and ears. He must care about that dog, despite all his disavowals. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>There was so much more to him than he was allowing anyone to see. Right now they were secluded from the Gramercys, the Spindle Cove gossips . . . from the rest of the living world. This might be her only chance to get at it.</p><p>\u201cGive me something,\u201d she pleaded. \u201cYour father\u2019s trade, or the names of your siblings. The house where you were raised. A friend, your favorite plaything. Anything.\u201d</p><p>His face hardened as he rose to his feet.</p> <p>\u201cFor goodness\u2019 sake, Thorne. Do you realize, I don\u2019t even know your Christian name? I\u2019ve been stretching my brain to recall it. Surely someone in the village would have used it, at least once. It would be in Sally\u2019s ledger of accounts in the shop, maybe. Or Lord Rycliff would have mentioned it sometime. Perhaps in church. But the more I think on it, the more I\u2019m certain . . . no one else in Spindle Cove knows it, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course it is.\u201d She grabbed him by the sleeve. \u201cYou are important. And you need to let someone know you.\u201d</p><p>His eyes bore into hers, nailing her in place. His voice sank to a low growl. \u201cStop pushing me.\u201d</p><p>When a powerful, unpredictable man loomed over a girl and glared at her that way, her every instinct was to back down. He knew that, and he was using it against her.</p> <p>\u201cI won\u2019t give up,\u201d she said. \u201cNot until you give me something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d He spoke in a remote voice, utterly devoid of emotion, as if rattling off a list of drill commands or ordering up a list of dry goods. \u201cI never knew my father. Never wanted to. He got my mother with child too young, out of wedlock, and then abandoned us both. She turned whore, found a place in a bawdy house. I could sleep in the attic, so long as I worked for my keep and stayed out of the customers\u2019 sight. I never went to school. Never learned a trade. My mother came to like her gin, and she came to hate my face, the more I grew to resemble my father. Never missed a chance to tell me I was useless, stupid, ugly, or all three. If she had anything solid to hand, she\u2019d beat the message in for good measure. I left when I had the chance, and I never once looked back.\u201d</p><p>Kate couldn\u2019t respond. Words failed her.</p><p>\u201cThere,\u201d he said, taking the forgotten meat pie from her hand and tossing it to the waiting dog. \u201cCharming story for the breakfast table.\u201d</p><p>Her own silence mocked her. She\u2019d asked for the truth. She\u2019d pushed him for information, and now she was allowing him to push her away.</p><p>Kate willed her tongue to work. Say something nice. Anything.</p> <p>\u201cI . . .\u201d She swallowed hard. \u201cI find you unbearably handsome.\u201d</p><p>He stared at her. \u201cMiss Taylor . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do. I find you unbearably, painfully handsome. I didn\u2019t always.\u201d The words spilled from her lips, unconsidered. \u201cBut ever since Hastings . . . it\u2019s hard for me to even look at you sometimes. It can\u2019t come as much surprise. You must be aware how many women are attracted to you.\u201d</p><p>He made a derisive sound. \u201cIt\u2019s not for my fine looks.\u201d</p><p>Kate went silent, suddenly keenly aware of all his other attractions. His strong body, that air of command, the fiercely protective instincts. The talents that must fuel those \u201ctales\u201d Sally Bright mentioned in the All Things shop.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m certain women are attracted to you for a host of reasons,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I can only speak for myself. And I find you unbearably handsome.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cWhy are you saying this? I don\u2019t need this from you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps you don\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>But I think you do.</p><p>She might not be able to comprehend the horrors he\u2019d faced on a battlefield, but she knew how it felt to be an unwanted child. She understood how it felt to be deemed worthless and ugly by the very person charged with her care. She knew how each and every unkind remark worked on a child\u2019s confidence for weeks, months, years. Bruises faded from the skin, but insults worked like weevils, burrowing into a person\u2019s soul.</p><p>She knew it took dozens of kindnesses to counteract just one slight, and even then\u2014she knew how she\u2019d come to dodge compliments, even well into adulthood, dismissing them as mere pity or insincerity. Because how could they be true? The ugly words were still there, deep inside, and they outlasted everything. They were the bones in this churchyard. No matter how much soil was heaped atop them, no matter how many cheerful flowers were planted over the grave\u2014they would always be there.</p><p>Those hateful words could outlive dirt.</p><p>She knew. And she couldn\u2019t watch him hurting and not do something to counteract it.</p><p>\u201cI find you unbearably handsome,\u201d she said. \u201cI know you\u2019re modest and guarded and you don\u2019t need to hear it. But I need to say it. So there it is.\u201d</p><p>She touched her fingertips to his cheek. He flinched, and his Adam\u2019s apple bobbed in his throat.</p><p>\u201cStop that.\u201d</p><p>Make me.</p><p>Reveling in the thrill of disobedience, she framed his face in her hands, letting the tips of her longest fingers graze the dark fringe of his hair. The icy chips of his eyes sent a shiver down her spine.</p><p>So she let her gaze fall to his lips, wondering\u2014not for the first time\u2014how that grim slash of a mouth could transform into something so passionate and warm when they kissed. She touched the pad of her thumb to the hollow of his cheek. Where a dimple might appear, if he could ever be coaxed to smile.</p><p>She very much wanted to see him smile. She wanted to make him laugh, long and loud.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re handsome,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re absurd.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I am speaking absurdities, it must be your fault. This hard angle of your jaw\u201d\u2014she traced it with a fingertip\u2014\u201cquite scrambles my thoughts, and your eyes . . . There\u2019s some puzzle in them I want to solve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t try. You don\u2019t know me.\u201d His voice was harsh, but his gaze was stark with hunger. Open, naked hunger.</p><p>Yes. Triumph surged through her veins. She was getting somewhere now.</p><p>\u201cI know you took a melon for me.\u201d She smiled. \u201cThat\u2019s a start. And when you look at me the way you\u2019re doing right now, I scarcely know myself. I feel womanly, to a degree I\u2019ve never felt before. But then I feel girlish, too. I have to remind myself not to do something silly, like twirl my hair or bounce on my toes. I think that\u2019s quite definite proof that you\u2019re handsome, Thorne. At least, to one woman.\u201d</p><p>And if she was right\u2014and that small spark in his eyes was a deeply buried yearning . . .</p><p>Kate thought she could live with being beautiful to just one man.</p><p>He took her by the waist, pulling her close. She gasped at the suddenness and strength in the motion. She suspected her shock was his purpose.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t fear you,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYou should fear me.\u201d He tightened his hold on her waist. In a matter of three paces he had her backed against the nearest wall. A lush green curtain of ferns and ivy framed her hair and face. \u201cYou should fear this. Every minute we\u2019re in this churchyard together, you\u2019re risking ruin. You could lose everything you\u2019ve wanted most.\u201d</p><p>She knew he spoke the truth. Just a few hundred yards away were four people who offered the human connection and family love she\u2019d grown up dreaming of and hoping to find. The Gramercys represented her heart\u2019s desire.</p><p>And yet she was here, with him. Sharing a highly improper embrace on sacred ground, with only the dead to chaperone. Had she lost her mind?</p><p>Perhaps.</p><p>Or perhaps she\u2019d found another heart\u2019s desire.</p><p>Was there some limit on them? Couldn\u2019t a girl have more than one?</p><p>The Gramercys made her feel accepted. But Thorne made her feel desired. Needed. In her youth, she never could have known to wish for this.</p><p>She murmured, \u201cWhat have you done to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a fraction of what I\u2019d like to do.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. There it was again\u2014a flash of that dry, disarming wit. Oh, she was in so much trouble. Wringing affection from this man would be like squeezing honey from a stone. But he\u2019d brought her this close, and she couldn\u2019t resist reaching for something more.</p><p>Don\u2019t hide from me, she willed. Don\u2019t pull away.</p><p>\u201cHandsome,\u201d she whispered, taking a chisel and hammer to the stone. Chipping away as best she knew how. \u201cFine-looking. Attractive. Striking. Noble. Body-thrilling. Swoon-inducing. Beauti\u2014\u201d</p><p>His kiss made a liar of her.</p><p>She\u2019d blithely told him she didn\u2019t fear him\u2014but that was before his lips came crushing down on hers. Before his tongue invaded her mouth. Plunging deep, and then deeper still. Exploring, stroking, demanding. Stirring up emotions she didn\u2019t know how to control.</p><p>A low growl rose from his chest. He moved forward, pressing his hard, masculine body to hers, and together they burrowed into the ivy covering the wall. The air was a dark, glossy green in her senses. Tiny, grasping tendrils pulled at her, scratched like small fingernails along her skin. They made her feel wild and part of something larger than herself, something elemental and natural and old as time.</p><p>As they kissed, his strong hands began to roam her body, shaping and claiming her in ways that must be wrong, but felt so necessary.</p><p>She wondered\u2014if she were a woman with more experience, where would she be touching him? Stretching her arms about his waist, perhaps? Might she work her hand inside his coat, to feel the sculpted contours of his chest?</p><p>She wasn\u2019t that daring. Instead, she touched her hand to his jaw, robustly formed and rough with new whiskers when the hour was barely noon. She slid her hand around the strong column of his neck, letting her fingertips graze the shorn hair at his nape. She stroked him there, softly. Tenderly. Because everyone deserved a bit of tenderness, and she was so very hungry for it herself.</p><p>What he gave her was something far more primal.</p><p>He clutched her tight, moaning into the kiss and holding her fast against him. The thrill of power was immediate. It shot through her, forking into every limb and electrifying her senses as he ravaged her mouth.</p><p>He muttered a curse as his lips slid to her neck, as though he kissed her unwillingly, against all morals and reason. She thrilled to that bit of blasphemy. It excited her to know that here, in this tiny, walled churchyard, she\u2019d torn down his barriers. He\u2019d lost all sense of duty or restraint, and she\u2019d done this to him.</p><p>And then . . .</p><p>Then there was what he was doing to her.</p><p>His kisses worked lower along the left side of her throat, and his right hand worked higher from her waist, and the two seemed destined to meet at a specific point. That reddish, round, helpful point that now puckered and jutted against her garments, presenting itself as an eager target.</p><p>I should put a stop to this.</p><p>She watched the idea pass through her mind. It came, and it went, and she did nothing about it.</p><p>When his hand stroked over her fabric-cloaked breast, she nearly fainted with pleasure and relief. His palm ironed the modest globe flat, and then his thumb found the taut, straining peak of her nipple, chafing back and forth in a delicious manner. Her body throbbed with a deep, sweet ache. He kissed the sensitive skin over her pounding heart, then pushed her breast higher, nuzzling the overflowing scoop of warm feminine flesh in his palm.</p><p>Nuzzling. Who could have known this cold, ruthless man had it in him to nuzzle? At all?</p><p>\u201cKatie.\u201d He groaned. \u201cI burn for you.\u201d</p><p>Just a few husky words, but coming from a man so taciturn, she thought they must equal reams of poetry.</p><p>I burn for you.</p><p>So hot, those words. So dangerous. Their effect was incendiary.</p><p>The potent heat of his desire changed her everywhere. Her stockings itched. She wanted them off. Between her legs, she swelled and ached. Her breasts challenged the corset\u2019s limits with her every fevered, panting breath. They rose impatient and quivering, begging for more of his skillful attention. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He hooked his finger beneath the fabric of her bodice and ran it up toward her shoulder, loosening her gown just enough to slide it over one shoulder and down. With his thumb, he eased her neckline lower, all the while kissing and sucking lightly at her neck.</p><p>He was going to touch her bare breast.</p><p>She was going to let him.</p> <p>It would happen. Soon.</p><p>Please. Now.</p><p>He kissed her lips, just as his fingers curled inside her bodice, cupping the slight handful of her breast. She tasted his dark, sensual moan. The pleasure was so intense, she arced off the ivy-covered wall, mindlessly thrusting her hips against him. Her belly met with the hard, pulsing ridge of his arousal.</p><p>My goodness.</p><p>Someone notify Lady Harriet. There was a monumental erection to be found in Wilmington, after all.</p> <p>He growled against her lips as he kneaded and fondled her flesh, teasing her nipple with the pad of one finger. Rolling it under his touch, chasing round and round. Kate thought she would go out of her skin with pleasure.</p><p>\u201cI must\u2014\u201d He broke the kiss, gasping. \u201cKatie, I want to taste you. I have to taste you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she urged. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>She worked a hand between them, reaching for the ribbon bow just at the top of her bodice. She hadn\u2019t lied to him earlier\u2014the bows on the gown were ornamental, sewn together.</p><p>All except this one.</p><p>She watched his eyes widen as she grasped the edge of the ribbon and teased the bow loose. It was like she\u2019d given him a lifetime of Christmas and birthday gifts, all at once. And any self-consciousness she\u2019d ever felt about her smallish breasts and dark nipples . . . it all disappeared in an instant when he pulled the fabric down, exposing her to the cool air and his hot, hungry gaze.</p> <p>She might not be perfect, but he liked what he saw.</p><p>At least, she supposed that was what it meant when a man whispered, \u201cSweet God above.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, still staring rapt at her naked breast. \u201cThis can\u2019t happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes. It\u2019s happening.\u201d She hoped more would be happening rather soon.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t use women. Ever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not using me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I don\u2019t take advantage of innocent girls. Ever.\u201d</p><p>For goodness\u2019 sake. He wasn\u2019t taking advantage of her, and she wasn\u2019t a girl. Would it help if she begged?</p> <p>The longer he delayed, the tighter her nipple puckered. It looked like a raspberry now, jutting out from a scoop of blancmange. Ready to be devoured.</p><p>\u201cThorne.\u201d She wriggled, pressing her breast into his hand. \u201cI need . . . something.\u201d</p><p>He looked up, pinning her gaze with his. \u201cI know precisely what you need.\u201d The deep richness of his voice melted and spread over her skin.</p><p>\u201cThen please.\u201d She tugged at his coat, trying to pull him closer. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>After a long hesitation he pulled her sleeve back up over her shoulder, then covered her breast.</p><p>\u201cYou need more than a moment\u2019s stolen pleasure,\u201d he said. \u201cYou need care and affection. Tenderness and love.\u201d</p><p>With jerky motions, he retied the ribbon bow, then stepped away. \u201cYou need a different man. A better man than me.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Eleven</p><p>No sooner had Thorne stepped away, loins throbbing with unspent lust, than Lady Lark Gramercy came dashing into the churchyard.</p><p>He quickly moved behind a stone cross, which was conveniently waist high. There was no concealing his labored breathing, however. Nor Katie\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cOh, there you two are,\u201d Lark said, smiling. \u201cFor a moment, I worried you were having some sort of tryst. I should hate for anything to tempt Evan to a sixth duel.\u201d The young woman laughed. \u201cFive is impressive, but six . . . ? Six would just look predictable.\u201d</p><p>Katie\u2014Miss Taylor, he scolded himself\u2014plucked a bit of ivy from her hair as she stepped away from the wall. Her cheeks and throat were washed with pink.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve had a time of it,\u201d she said. \u201cBadger dashed into the churchyard through a hole in the wall and we\u2019ve been searching.\u201d</p><p>Bloody hell. Thorne scanned the rows of graves. The pup was missing again.</p><p>What a blackguard he was. Not only had he been moments away from desecrating Miss Taylor\u2019s virtue in a churchyard and ruining her future of wealth and comfort\u2014he\u2019d neglected the damn dog. He scrubbed a hand through his hair, furious with himself.</p><p>\u201cGo on with Lady Lark,\u201d he told Miss Taylor. \u201cI\u2019ll find him.\u201d</p><p>He needed a few minutes to bring his lust into submission anyway.</p><p>Once the ladies had left, he whistled. The dog came running straightaway.</p><p>And then Thorne spent a quarter hour or so reading the inscription on every last monument in the churchyard, at his usual painfully slow rate. Might as well get acquainted with the people he\u2019d given such a salacious show.</p><p>Four rows of dead Wilmingtonians later, his loins had calmed and he believed he might be able to think clearly again. As he left the churchyard, Badger at his heel, he ran both hands through his hair.</p><p>What the devil was he doing? Hadn\u2019t he resolved there would be no more kisses? He knew how to withstand purely physical temptation, but her sweetness . . . this was a force unlike any he\u2019d faced before.</p><p>If he hadn\u2019t chosen that moment to stop . . . If Lady Lark had arrived just a few seconds earlier . . . Katie\u2014Miss Taylor\u2014would have been caught with her bosom hanging out of her dress. With him hulking and slavering over her like a randy youth getting his first flash of tit.</p><p>Thorne had meant what he\u2019d told her. He didn\u2019t use women. Growing up in a whorehouse had left him with contempt for any man who paid for pleasure. And an exchange of coin wasn\u2019t the only way a woman could be used. He\u2019d seen men wield power, privilege, circumstance, and physical violence to have their way.</p><p>Sometimes\u2014many times\u2014it all made him disgusted to be a man.</p><p>But he was a man. One like all the others, rank with dark cravings and base needs. So he took lovers\u2014but only when he knew the relationship would be mutually satisfying, uncomplicated, and brief.</p><p>Nothing with Miss Taylor could be uncomplicated. As for brief . . . ? They had a connection spanning decades.</p><p>Today he\u2019d been tempted to use her anyway. Oh, she would have argued that she was willing enough. But he knew what she truly wanted from life. And it sure as hell didn\u2019t involve reclining against a churchyard wall and offering her breast to a crude, uneducated convict. If he\u2019d given in to her pleadings and his own lust, he would have only been using her. To make himself feel stronger, more powerful.</p><p>More human.</p><p>You are important, she\u2019d said. You need to let someone know you.</p><p>When it came to his emotions, no one could get past the stalwart defenses he had erected. No one, that was, until her. She\u2019d been close to him long before all those fortifications were completed. And though she didn\u2019t remember his face or his name, she seemed to recall her way through the network of tunnels. She was gaily skipping past all his Keep the Hell Out barricades, working her way to the center of his soul.</p><p>Where all the demons lurked.</p><p>He had to find some way to fence her out, before she got hurt. He\u2019d said too much about the past already, and he could never let her know more.</p><p>It would ruin her life.</p><p>As the Gramercys\u2019 ridiculous picnic pagoda came into view, he drew to a halt in the middle of the meadow and stared at the thing. It seemed that wherever these people went, they built a queer little kingdom of their own\u2014and he was always outside its borders.</p><p>Badger sat at his heel, waiting on further direction.</p><p>Thorne tossed the pup a bit of dried beef from his pocket, rewarding his patience.</p><p>He\u2019d been waiting a long time for a hound like this. While noblemen kept purebred greyhounds and such for their fancy fox hunts, the lurcher was a common man\u2019s hunting dog\u2014a coursing hound specially bred for speed, sight, and intelligence. A good lurcher could chase down rabbits, fowl. Even foxes and deer.</p><p>A dog like Badger would make a fine companion in the American wilderness. He was perfectly bred to be obedient, swift, and ruthless in pursuit of the kill.</p><p>Miss Taylor couldn\u2019t care less about any of that. She wrung her hands at the idea of Badger catching a vole.</p><p>Yet she claimed to love the creature. And for what? The too-long nose, or unevenly patched fur? The pup\u2019s propensity to chew her belongings to bits?</p><p>The longer he stared at the dog, the less sense it made.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell does she see in you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Badger. What do we see in that man?\u201d</p><p>As Kate curled up with the puppy that night, she found and plucked a hidden burr from his undercoat.</p><p>\u201cYou like him, too,\u201d she said to the pup. \u201cDon\u2019t try to deny it. I can tell you do. Your eyes go all melty when he tosses you the smallest scrap of affection, and when he\u2019s near, you have a tendency to pant.\u201d</p><p>She sighed, cupping the puppy\u2019s cone-shaped muzzle in her palm. \u201cDo you want to know a secret? I\u2019m afraid I have the same reaction, and it\u2019s every bit as obvious.\u201d</p><p>Badger pawed at a bit of loosened leather binding from a copy of Mrs. Worthington\u2019s Wisdom for Young Ladies.</p><p>\u201cGo on, destroy it,\u201d she urged. \u201cThere are several hundred more where it came from.\u201d</p><p>Copies of the insipid, damaging etiquette book littered the village in scores\u2014and very few of them remained anywhere else in England. As the original patroness of Spindle Cove, Susanna Finch\u2014now Lady Rycliff\u2014had made it her personal mission to remove every possible copy of Mrs. Worthington\u2019s Wisdom from circulation.</p><p>Badger was welcome to chew his way through them, one by one. Because right now, Kate had no use for proper, ladylike behavior. She flopped back on the mattress and stared up at the ceiling, giving in to the temptation to remember.</p><p>Her nipples peaked beneath her nightrail. With each rise and fall of her breath, the thin linen teased them harder still. She wanted his hands on them. His mouth on them. His body atop hers, heavy and strong.</p><p>She wanted that yearning look in his pale blue eyes, and the sweet, sweet taste of his kiss.</p><p>Oh, Thorne.</p><p>She lifted one hand to the valley between her breasts and lightly stroked up and down her sternum, dragging the muslin with her touch.</p><p>If only he hadn\u2019t suffered that attack of conscience in the churchyard.</p><p>Well . . . she had to be honest. Considering the timing of Lark\u2019s appearance, she was rather glad Thorne had stopped when he did.</p><p>But if he were here with her right now, he wouldn\u2019t need to stop at all.</p><p>Kate slipped loose one button of her nightrail. Then two. She closed her eyes and summoned the green, earthy scent of moss and ferns, blended with a more masculine smell of leather and musk. She recalled the scrape of his whiskers against her palm.</p><p>She slipped her hand inside her nightrail, trying to relive the experience through his senses. How did she feel, to him?</p><p>Soft, she decided.</p><p>So soft. Like warm satin\u2014or the well-worn palms of her oldest, dearest kid gloves. A little springy, like bread dough, in a way that tempted fingers to knead and squeeze. At the areola . . . amusingly wrinkled. A rosette of tightly ruched silk.</p><p>She rolled that pursed bud of her nipple beneath her fingertip, trying to recapture the excitement and pleasure of his touch. Imagining his mouth and his wicked, skillful tongue.</p><p>It felt good. Very good.</p><p>But nowhere near the same. If there was one thing she\u2019d learned over the course of her life, it was that no amount of imagining could make her forget she was alone. If she wanted to recapture that intense, forbidden thrill, Thorne would have to be involved.</p><p>She sighed and brought her hand out from the nightrail, flinging her arm above her head.</p><p>In the next moment, she was seized by a paroxysm of torment. Badger had found something interesting to nose and lick on the underside of her arm.</p><p>\u201cStop.\u201d Kate convulsed with helpless, ticklish laughter. \u201cStop, you little imp.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His cold nose burrowed into the crook of her elbow, rooting and sniffing. She had to clap a hand over her mouth to keep from yelping aloud. It was torture of the sweetest, furriest kind.</p><p>Once she\u2019d managed to turn on her side and restore order, the dog leaped down from the bed and began circling and sniffing at the carpet.</p><p>Kate sat bolt upright.</p> <p>Oh, no. Oh, no you don\u2019t.</p><p>Kate jumped out of bed and jammed her feet into a pair of slippers. She grabbed her dressing gown and pulled it on over her nightrail, hastily knotting the belt at her waist.</p><p>\u201cJust wait, Badger darling. Just hold it one minute more . . .\u201d</p><p>Scooping up the dog in one arm and taking a candlestick with the other, Kate shouldered open the door of her bedchamber and padded softly down the corridor. The hour was well past midnight, and she didn\u2019t want to wake anyone.</p><p>After descending the stairs, she opened the front door of the rooming house a crack. Cool night air rushed over her exposed throat. She set Badger on the ground and pulled her dressing gown closed at the neck.</p> <p>\u201cGo on.\u201d She shooed him with a hand. \u201cDo your business and come back. I\u2019ll just wait here.\u201d</p><p>As Badger scampered across the front garden to have his choice of the hitching posts, a light caught Kate\u2019s eye.</p><p>There was a lamp burning in the Bull and Blossom.</p><p>Odd.</p><p>To be sure, the Bull and Blossom was a tavern, but this was the country\u2014Fosbury always closed up shop by nine or ten at the latest. Village life began with the crack of dawn. What man would be up drinking at this hour?</p><p>Perhaps a man occupied by the same thoughts that kept her awake, when all the other ladies were asleep.</p> <p>It had to be Thorne.</p><p>And she simply had to see him.</p><p>Kate rewrapped her dressing gown, tying it as modestly as possible. Anyway, it was dark. No one could see much. She blew out her candle, leaving it on the small entry table. Then she shut the door behind her and moved into the garden, summoning Badger to her side with a little chirping noise.</p><p>\u201cCome along,\u201d she told him. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have an adventure.\u201d</p><p>A chill crawled down her spine as she crossed the dark, shadowy village green, but having the dog at her heel was some comfort. Badger might not be fully grown, but he could tickle an attacker into submission, if nothing else.</p><p>When she reached the red-painted front door of the Bull and Blossom, she put a hand to the door latch and tested it. It was unlocked.</p><p>And vibrating.</p><p>She held her breath and opened her ears. From inside the tavern, she detected soft strains of pianoforte music. But they sounded as if they were coming from a long distance away.</p> <p>The faint chords threw her back to those first hazy memories. She was in that long dark corridor again. Pianoforte music played from somewhere. From below? In her memory, she felt the distant strains of music shivering up through her heels. The arches of her feet tingled.</p><p>\u201cSee the garden of blossoms so fair . . .\u201d</p><p>The corridor was cramped and dark. Endless. But in the darkness, there was something blue.</p><p>Be brave, my Katie.</p><p>Kate awoke from her trance with a gasp, sucking breath into air-deprived lungs. Her white-knuckled hand remained clasped on the door latch.</p><p>She gathered Badger with her other arm, then opened the door and entered.</p><p>What she found inside surprised her.</p><p>Lord Drewe.</p><p>He was seated at the pianoforte, and he had not noticed her entrance.</p><p>Light from a small lamp revealed him to be dressed in an open shirt with rolled cuffs and a dark pair of trousers. His feet were hard to see through the shadows, but Kate thought they were bare\u2014just long, pale wedges against the dark floorboards.</p><p>He was playing the pianoforte, but with the top closed and the damper pedal pressed to the floor. The result was that no matter how vigorously he attacked the keys\u2014and he was going at them with true fervor\u2014only a faint, music-box sound escaped the instrument.</p><p>She could have laughed, if she weren\u2019t so afraid of being caught. Watching a powerful marquess play the pianoforte in this fashion . . . Well, it was a little like watching a side of beef being butchered with a penknife.</p><p>Badger wriggled free of her grip.</p><p>Kate held her breath, mortified, as he hit the floor with a clatter of tiny claws.</p><p>Lord Drewe\u2019s hands froze on the keys and he looked up sharply. He peered hard toward the shadows that concealed her.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d His voice had a rough, end-of-day quality to it, and his jaw had a dark sprinkling of whiskers. For the first time, he seemed less of an elegant marquess and more of a . . . man.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s only me,\u201d she managed to whisper. \u201cKate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d In an instant he\u2019d mastered his shock. He rose from the bench and waved her forward. \u201cPlease come in. What a surprise.\u201d</p><p>She hated for him to see her in her dressing gown, but it seemed a greater sin to remain hidden. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. I just took Badger out for a minute, and then I saw the light burning. I was curious. I didn\u2019t mean to interrupt your . . .\u201d She bit her lip. \u201cYour seething.\u201d</p><p>He smiled and laughed a little.</p><p>Kate released her breath, relieved. \u201cI\u2019m so glad you laughed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you thinking I wouldn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t sure. To tease you felt like a risk, but I couldn\u2019t resist.\u201d She approached the pianoforte. \u201cI didn\u2019t know you played.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes. My brother Bennett does as well\u2014or at least, he used to. Oddly enough, none of my sisters show much inclination for it. It seems to be a trait confined to the Gramercy men.\u201d A half smile tugged at his mouth. \u201cThat is, on our side of the family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know if my\u2014if Simon Gramercy played?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe he did.\u201d Lord Drewe slid down the bench and gestured for her to sit. \u201cShall we try a duet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like nothing more.\u201d</p><p>She choose a simple piece\u2014one of those easy duets that all novice pianists learn with their tutors. Kate had played the lower part of it countless times with her students. Today, she took the upper part, and Lord Drewe quickly entered with the bass.</p><p>He was good. Very good. Within a few measures, she could discern his skill. He had long, deft fingers and a reach that she envied. But his talent went deeper than mere skill\u2014he possessed a natural musicality that even a gifted teacher could not impart. Seldom did she have a pupil who could match her for training, but occasionally one came close.</p><p>This was the first time in years she\u2019d felt herself truly bested.</p><p>But it was marvelous. As they played, she felt him making her better. She soon left the proscribed boundaries of the exercise, taking the melody down different paths. He followed her lead, occasionally made his own suggestions with a new, surprising chord. It would have been difficult to explain to anyone who didn\u2019t play\u2014but the duet was a conversation. They responded to one another, adjusting tempo and dynamics. They finished one another\u2019s phrases. They even told each other jokes.</p><p>His technique was flawless; his style, restrained. But she sensed true passion beneath it all.</p><p>When they ended the duet with a playful flourish and one final, muted secret of a chord, they looked to each other.</p><p>\u201cWell, then,\u201d he said. \u201cThat seals it. You must be part of the family.\u201d</p><p>Her heart missed a beat. \u201cWhat are you saying? Did you have some news, some result from the inquiries . . . ?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cNot yet. But there\u2019s so much indirect evidence. We\u2019ve spent the whole week with you, and we\u2019re all agreed. You simply fit in, Kate. This\u201d\u2014he indicated the pianoforte\u2014\u201cis just one more reason. In my mind, the investigation is concluded. Don\u2019t you feel it, too?\u201d</p><p>Kate didn\u2019t feel certain of anything\u2014except that she was most certainly going to cry. She tried to hold the tears back, but a few spilled over. She swiped at them with the side of her wrist.</p><p>A few moments passed before she could speak. \u201cLord Drewe, I don\u2019t know how to thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo begin with, you must call me Evan now. And no thanks are necessary.\u201d</p><p>Kate drew up her legs beneath her dressing gown and angled to face him on the piano bench. If he was truly her cousin, she now had the right to fuss over him. \u201cWhy are you up so late, Evan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI might ask you the same thing.\u201d One dark eyebrow arched. \u201cI won\u2019t believe it was only the dog.\u201d</p><p>When she stammered a bit in response, he waved off her explanations.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right. You needn\u2019t manufacture excuses. We\u2019re all a bit haunted, we Gramercys. Each of us has a passion. My sister Calista\u2014you\u2019ll meet her soon\u2014has always been wild for nature. Harriet lives for drama, and Lark loves a puzzle. Our brother Bennett would tell you his passion is vice, but he once had nobler pursuits.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo your passion is music?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI enjoy music, and I often take refuge in it. But music is not what makes me . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeethe,\u201d she finished.</p><p>He smiled. \u201cPrecisely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what is it? Or whom?\u201d The moment the words left her mouth, she regretted them. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s not my place to ask.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it is your place. Because you\u2019re part of it now. My passion is the family, Kate. This title I\u2019ve inherited, the responsibilities of managing several estates. Being a good steward of the land. Taking care of those in my protection. Guarding my siblings from themselves.\u201d</p><p>He stared into the corner, and Kate took the opportunity to study him. She noted the small creases at the corners of his eyes. Here and there she could glimpse a thread of silver in his dark hair. But these subtle signs of age looked well on him. They harmonized with his worldly demeanor, as though his body were learning to reflect the maturity of the soul inside. He was a fine-looking man by any standard, but she suspected his most handsome years were yet to come.</p><p>He pushed a hand through his hair. \u201cCorporal Thorne does not like me.\u201d</p><p>She startled at the abrupt change of topic. \u201cOh, please don\u2019t believe that. If you go by appearances, Corporal Thorne doesn\u2019t like anyone. He\u2019s very . . . reserved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps. But he resents me in particular, and for good reason. He believes that I should have known of your existence, and that I should have tried harder to find you. I know he\u2019s right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou couldn\u2019t possibly have known. You were only a youth when you inherited.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you were just a girl, living penniless and alone.\u201d He rubbed his temple. \u201cAs you might have gathered . . . a violent temper is one of my worst faults. I have no patience for those who cross my family.\u201d</p><p>A rather grave understatement, Kate thought, given the five duels. His having walked away unscathed from one or two such confrontations would be impressive enough, but . . .</p><p>Five.</p><p>Evan sighed heavily. \u201cThis is what Corporal Thorne does not appreciate. No one can be angrier with me than I am with myself. You\u2019ve been wronged, Kate, and I have no one to call out. No malfeasance to blame but my own inattention. Someday, I will ask you to forgive me. But not tonight.\u201d</p><p>Kate leaned forward, boldly placing her hand on his arm. \u201cThere is no need. Please believe me when I tell you I have no room for bitterness or rancor in my heart. It\u2019s too full of joy and gratitude. I\u2019m so happy to have a family at long last.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am soothed to hear it.\u201d He took her hand in his and regarded it carefully. Thoughtfully. \u201cDo you care for him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThorne? I . . .\u201d She hesitated, but only to choose her phrasing. The answer was instinctive. \u201cI do care. I care very much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you love him?\u201d</p><p>Now here was something she\u2019d been avoiding asking herself. But she couldn\u2019t let pass the opportunity to unburden her heart. Evan was family. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI think I could come to love him,\u201d she said. \u201cIf he would let me.\u201d</p><p>Evan\u2019s thumb rubbed a lazy circle on the back of her hand. \u201cIt\u2019s plain you have a brave and generous heart. I imagine you could love just about anyone, if you made up your mind to do it. But you deserve a man who can love you in return.\u201d</p><p>Kate smiled a little, nervously.</p> <p>His grasp on her hand was warm and firm. \u201cI mean to take care of you. I want you to know this. If there\u2019s no legacy allotted in the terms of Simon\u2019s estate, I will ensure that you have one. You will be an independent woman of significant wealth. A woman with choices.\u201d He leaned meaningfully on that last word.</p><p>She swallowed. \u201cEvan, you needn\u2019t do that for me. I\u2019ve never had any expectation of\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have expectations of myself, Kate.\u201d His eyes glittered in the dark. \u201cI have a passion for protecting this family. And that passion now extends to you.\u201d</p><p>A silence opened between them. As they regarded one another, Kate\u2019s curiosity grew.</p><p>He had a \u201cpassion\u201d for her. The insides of her elbows tingled. What did that mean, exactly?</p> <p>\u201cCorporal Thorne is a good man,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps. But is he the best man for you?\u201d He looked down at where their hands remained linked. \u201cKate, it\u2019s possible we won\u2019t accumulate enough evidence to satisfy the courts of your identity. But that\u2019s not the only way I can give you the family name.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him through the flickering shadows. Surely he didn\u2019t mean that the way it sounded. He couldn\u2019t possibly be hinting at\u2014</p><p>A floorboard creaked, and Kate startled.</p><p>Evan released her hand. \u201cJust the dog. Don\u2019t be alarmed.\u201d</p><p>Relief washed over her. Nothing improper had passed between the two of them. At least, she didn\u2019t think it had. But she cringed to imagine how the scene could have looked to a gossip-minded villager. That would be a juicy rumor for Sally Bright to stock in the All Things shop\u2014Miss Taylor holding hands with Lord Drewe, when she was engaged to Corporal Thorne?</p> <p>But no one would believe that rumor, Kate assured herself. A girl like her, courted by two virile, powerful men\u2014and one of them a lord? She felt silly for even entertaining the idea herself.</p><p>Wrapping her dressing gown tight around her chest, she rose from the chair and gathered Badger.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d best go back to the rooming house,\u201d she said. \u201cPlease don\u2019t stay up too late seething on my account.\u201d</p><p>He gave her an intent look and a cryptic smile. \u201cI make no promises.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twelve</p><p>By Spindle Cove custom, the midsummer fair was a children\u2019s festival. But readying the crumbling Norman castle for its annual day of merriment required all the foresight and strategy of a military campaign.</p><p>There were so many preparations to complete. Music, dancing, food, displays, general amusement. Kate was responsible for the first two items on that list, and she\u2019d worked hard toward the success of the latter three as well.</p><p>By mid-morning, however, she seemed doomed to fail at them all.</p> <p>First Miss Lorrish brought distressing news about the decorations. \u201cMiss Taylor, we\u2019ve tried three times now. The swags simply won\u2019t stay put on the southeastern turret.\u201d</p><p>Kate shaded her brow with one hand and gazed up at the limp purple bunting dangling sadly from the crenellated parapet. \u201cI\u2019ll ask the militiamen to climb up and secure it.\u201d</p><p>Next, it was Miss Apperton\u2019s turn for a crisis. \u201cOh, Miss Taylor. I\u2019ve broken the last good string for my lute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou may borrow mine,\u201d she offered.</p><p>Another hour smoothed most of the wrinkles, as children and families began to stream in from the countryside and village.</p><p>But then there was Miss Elliott. Poor, petrified Miss Elliott. The hapless young lady came skittering to Kate\u2019s side moments before the ladies were to sing the madrigal.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d Beneath her bonnet\u2019s wide brim, her cheeks blazed scarlet. \u201cI just can\u2019t do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t be alone,\u201d Kate assured her. \u201cWe\u2019re all singing together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut there are so many people. I didn\u2019t realize\u2014\u201d Her voice broke. \u201cPlease don\u2019t force me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t weep.\u201d Kate drew her into a tight hug. \u201cOf course I won\u2019t force you. Just as long as you understand, I\u2019m not giving up on you, either. We\u2019ll hear you sing another day.\u201d She pulled back and tilted her head to view under Miss Elliott\u2019s bonnet. \u201cNow, then. Chin high, keep smiling. Right?\u201d</p><p>Miss Elliott sniffed and tried to smile. \u201cYes, of course.\u201d</p><p>Poor girl.</p><p>When Kate considered that she might have been reunited with exacting relations like Miss Elliott\u2019s, she felt the magnitude of her good fortune.</p><p>Her gaze slid to the Gramercys, seated under the canopy reserved for guests of honor. In the center were two flower-bedecked thrones. Kate had asked Evan to sit as ceremonial king of the fair, with Diana Highwood playing the part of his regal, placid queen.</p><p>After the dancing, Kate had a short break while the children\u2019s hoop race went off. She made her way toward the canopy, meaning to check on Aunt Marmoset\u2019s comfort.</p><p>Mrs. Highwood intercepted her, however, and drew her quickly aside. \u201cDon\u2019t they make a handsome couple?\u201d she said. \u201cI always knew Diana would do better than Minerva. Minerva might have caught herself a viscount, but now Diana will be a marchioness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMrs. Highwood,\u201d Kate whispered through her teeth. \u201cPlease. They\u2019re sitting just a few feet away.\u201d</p><p>But the matron went on, undeterred. \u201cLord Drewe must fancy her. Why else would he have stayed in the village so long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been giving Lady Lark music lessons.\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Highwood erupted in laughter. \u201cOh, Miss Taylor. Do you expect me to believe a man of Lord Drewe\u2019s fine looks, intelligence, manners, and stature would remain in this tiny village just for you?\u201d</p><p>Kate sighed. No, she didn\u2019t expect Mrs. Highwood to believe it.</p><p>She didn\u2019t expect anyone to believe it.</p><p>Two days had passed since the night she came upon Evan playing the pianoforte in the Bull and Blossom, but those days were wholly consumed with preparations for today\u2019s festivities. There hadn\u2019t been any quiet opportunity to talk.</p><p>She kept thinking back to his cryptic comments that night. \u201cThat isn\u2019t the only way I can give you the family name.\u201d</p><p>Never in her life would she have dreamed that a marquess would hint at marrying her. And Mrs. Highwood was right\u2014no one else would believe it, either.</p><p>It didn\u2019t matter, anyhow. Kate was otherwise engaged. Her public intentions, private attention, and, increasingly, tender emotions were all engaged by the man now taking the green.</p><p>The hoop race finished, and the militiamen claimed the center of attention for a short rifle drill. As they marched forward in formation, Kate delighted in the opportunity to stare. Pride swelled in her heart.</p><p>Thorne was a sight to behold. He wore his best officer\u2019s coat, of course. The uniform was designed to make any man look tall and fit, and when the man in question was already tall and fit, it made him look positively godlike.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d said Mrs. Highwood, \u201cyou should not feel bad, Miss Taylor. You have snagged yourself a corporal, and that is nothing to sniff at. For a young woman in your circumstances, a corporal is a fine catch indeed. Though I do think you could have managed a lieutenant. That would have been better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould it?\u201d</p><p>Kate couldn\u2019t imagine any man looking fitter, stronger, or more attractive than Thorne appeared to her eyes right now. She would not have traded him for a prince.</p><p>Lately, everyone\u2014Mrs. Highwood, Evan, even Thorne himself\u2014kept telling Kate she belonged with a different man. Perhaps common sense would argue the same.</p><p>But her heart was saying otherwise, and she couldn\u2019t ignore it any longer. There was a connection between them. Some bond she simply couldn\u2019t give up.</p><p>As the militia review concluded and Sir Lewis prepared for the grand finale\u2014his demonstration with the trebuchet\u2014Kate couldn\u2019t stay away.</p><p>She left the canopy and plucked the shiny brass helmet from a displayed suit of medieval armor. Jogging across the green, she presented it to Thorne. She just had to be near him.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d she said, breathless but smiling. \u201cIn case of melons.\u201d</p><p>He took the helmet and gave it a stern glare.</p><p>\u201cStill no laugh?\u201d She ducked and tilted her head, trying to catch his attention. \u201cI was hoping you\u2019d smile, at least. Well, I suppose I\u2019ll just have to keep trying.\u201d</p><p>His icy eyes met hers. \u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>She winced at the curt rejection. It seemed that whatever progress they\u2019d made in Wilmington had vanished. He was shutting the door again.</p><p>She would find a window. \u201cI mean to stay after the fair, to help put things to rights. We need some time to talk. Alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need to talk. It\u2019s important.\u201d</p><p>She took his silence as reluctant agreement.</p><p>\u201cMiss Taylor!\u201d</p><p>Kate turned to see Lark careening at her like a lawn bowl. Laughing, she grabbed Kate by the hand. \u201cI\u2019m stealing her, Corporal. Don\u2019t try to stop me.\u201d</p><p>Little did Lark know, she wasn\u2019t likely to encounter much resistance from Thorne\u2019s quarter. He looked only too pleased to see her go.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Kate asked as Lark tugged her away to a quiet corner of the ruins.</p><p>\u201cOh, Kate.\u201d The young lady flung her arms wide and captured her in an effusive hug. \u201cI\u2019ve been dying to talk to you alone. This is the perfect time, while everyone\u2019s paying attention to the demonstration.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing\u2019s the matter. Everything\u2019s perfect. Evan tells me we\u2019re going to consider it official. He has solicitors coming down to meet you and make everything right. We\u2019re going to claim you as a Gramercy.\u201d Lark gave a little squeal. \u201cWe\u2019re cousins. Isn\u2019t it wonderful?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Kate agreed, grinning. \u201cIt is.\u201d</p><p>Lark clasped Kate\u2019s hands, swinging them back and forth a bit. \u201cOur holiday will be ending soon. We\u2019ll be leaving Spindle Cove.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Oh, I\u2019ll miss you all very much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoose.\u201d Lark squeezed her hands. \u201cYou\u2019ll come with us to Town, of course. I need you. I have ever so much shopping to do for my season, and it will be so much more fun if you\u2019re there. Harry couldn\u2019t care less about plumes and bonnets. I suppose I should have some actual music practice, too.\u201d</p><p>Kate turned her head and blinked hard.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, dear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI . . .\u201d She tried to smile. \u201cIt\u2019s too much to believe. I only wish I knew why you want me.\u201d</p><p>Lark put her hands on Kate\u2019s shoulders. \u201cBecause you\u2019re you. And because you\u2019re family. Family above everything.\u201d She cast a glance toward the bailey. \u201cHonestly, I\u2019m not sure why you\u2019d want us, either. We\u2019ve little to recommend ourselves, save pots of money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Kate said, earnestly shaking her head. \u201cNo. I would want to be a Gramercy even if you were poor pig farmers on the Isles of Scilly.\u201d</p><p>Lark laughed. \u201cWell, Evan does pay a great deal of mind to agriculture. It\u2019s rather a bore sometimes. Don\u2019t worry about anything. There may be a touch of gossip, but this family has weathered many a scandal. Once the ton has a chance to meet you, you will only improve our overall standing, I suspect.\u201d</p><p>Kate couldn\u2019t quite believe that, but living with the Gramercys was social acceptance enough. When it came to the ton, she would simply do her best to stay out of the way. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh!\u201d Lark exclaimed. \u201cI\u2019m so stupid, I forgot. That\u2019s the entire reason I wanted to speak with you today. Evan says we must keep it all quiet a few days longer. But you\u2019ll be wanting to tell Corporal Thorne, of course. Now that you\u2019re part of the family, he\u2019ll be marrying into the Gramercys, too.\u201d</p><p>Kate\u2019s breath left her. \u201cI hadn\u2019t even thought of that.\u201d</p><p>Goodness. If ever a man needed the acceptance of a family, it was Thorne. And despite his rocky start with Evan, if the Gramercys would so happily bring her into the fold, they would surely accept Thorne, too. Why would he want a cold, lonely cabin in the American wilderness when he could be a part of this?</p> <p>But that would mean marrying him. And staying married to him, so long as they both should live. No simple prospect.</p><p>\u201cShould you like to have the wedding at Ambervale?\u201d Lark asked. \u201cI thought it might be nice, since your parents were so happy there. It\u2019s your birthplace, you know. Your true home. I know you have your own plans, but promise me you\u2019ll discuss it with Corporal Thorne.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promise you,\u201d Kate said. \u201cWe\u2019ll discuss it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you been letting the dog chew books?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Miss Taylor smiled. \u201cThorne, when I asked to speak to you alone, it wasn\u2019t about Badger\u2019s discipline. I told the Gramercys I\u2019d be down to join them for dinner. We don\u2019t have much time.\u201d</p> <p>Thorne glanced around the rapidly emptying castle grounds. The fair was over, and daylight was fading. Everyone had gone down to the village for drinks and refreshments at the Bull and Blossom.</p><p>He pulled a small green volume from his pocket and waved it at her. \u201cI had to pull this away from the dog yesterday. It\u2019s Lord Drewe\u2019s, you know.\u201d He displayed the chewed binding. \u201cNow it\u2019s ruined. I don\u2019t know what to do about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, don\u2019t concern yourself overmuch. Lord Drewe has other books to read, I\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>Thorne snorted. Didn\u2019t he know it. Fosbury had told him the marquess had two full crates of books delivered to the village, along with all his other belongings.</p><p>Two crates of books. What possible use could a man have for them all? The sheer puzzle of it irritated him.</p><p>And the books themselves weren\u2019t even useful. He glared at the shredded volume. \u201cWho the devil is . . .\u201d He blinked and frowned at the letters again. \u201cAr . . .\u201d</p> <p>She took the book from him and peered at the chewed spine. \u201cAristotle. It\u2019s a Greek name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore Greeks? I don\u2019t suppose he was one of the men fighting over that Helen of Troy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was a philosopher.\u201d She sighed. \u201cIt\u2019s not important right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is important. You shouldn\u2019t be letting Badger chew on these.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, I know. He must have gotten that one when I wasn\u2019t looking.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cWe can get a replacement. Evan won\u2019t be angry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvan?\u201d Thorne jerked his head in surprise. A bright red burst of irrational jealousy pulsed through him. \u201cSo he\u2019s \u2018Evan\u2019 now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. That\u2019s what I needed to tell you. It\u2019s the most wonderful news. Lord Drewe has\u2014\u201d</p><p>She broke off abruptly and clapped a palm over her mouth.</p> <p>A quick glance down told him why. A freshly killed rat had just been dropped at her feet, its hairless, wormlike tail still twitching.</p><p>As for the puppy who\u2019d proudly delivered the kill\u2014his furry tail was wagging like mad. A pink tongue dangled loose from a canine grin.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t scream,\u201d Thorne warned her in a low, calm voice. As he spoke, he crouched beside the puppy and gave him a firm, affectionate rub. \u201cDon\u2019t scold him, either. You\u2019ll only confuse him. This is a good thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis?\u201d she squeaked through her cupped palm, gesturing toward the lifeless rat with her free hand. \u201cThis is a good thing? I think I\u2019m the one who\u2019s confused.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter the fair, people will have left refuse everywhere around the castle. Apple cores, little morsels of cake. Draws the vermin. Badger chased down a rat, caught it, and denied himself the pleasure of eating it. That\u2019s precisely what he\u2019s been bred and trained to do, and now he deserves praise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do I do?\u201d she asked, still staring wide-eyed at the lifeless rat. \u201cDon\u2019t ask me to touch it. I can\u2019t possibly touch it. It\u2019s only just stopped moving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to touch it. Just act like it\u2019s the best, most charming thing Badger\u2019s done in all his furry little life. And distract him, so I can toss the bleeding thing over the cliff.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cAll right.\u201d</p><p>While she fawned and cooed over the pup, Thorne found a shovel and disposed of the rat. Once he\u2019d finished the work and rinsed his hands, he returned to find her cupping the pup\u2019s funny face in both her hands.</p><p>She made kissing noises. \u201cYou are the most clever puppy in all Sussex, Badger. Did you know that? So very brave. I just adore you.\u201d</p><p>Thorne watched her, quietly amazed. It just came so easily to her\u2014loving encouragement. He supposed this quality was what made her a successful tutor.</p><p>She\u2019d handled the shock of the rat quite well. Better than most ladies would, he imagined. She deserved some encouraging praise of her own\u2014someone to frame her lovely face in his hands and tell her she was clever, beautiful, brave, adored.</p><p>But Thorne just didn\u2019t have that talent. It wasn\u2019t born in him, and he\u2019d never had lessons, either. If love were music, he would be tone deaf.</p><p>\u201cSo what was your wonderful news?\u201d he asked. \u201cFrom \u2018Evan.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes.\u201d With one final loving pat, she released the dog and stood. \u201cLord Drewe says the family will claim me as their cousin.\u201d</p><p>Thorne\u2019s insides clenched. Wonderful news, indeed.</p><p>\u201cHave they found some proof?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cBut Evan says there\u2019s proof enough for him. The birthmark, the parish register, the painting. And . . . I simply seem to fit. So they\u2019re making me part of the family. They want me to come with them to Town, to Ambervale . . . everywhere.\u201d</p><p>As she spoke of it, her face lit up. There she went again, glowing with happiness. Like a star, only further out of his reach.</p><p>He told himself not to be churlish. Perhaps this was the best possible outcome. The Gramercys . . . maybe they truly were just odd, not sinister. If they would accept her, with no further inquiries into her past . . . Katie could have a glittering new life. She would never be forced to face the horrid truth.</p><p>This was good for her. And for him. He could go to America and not worry for her. He would think of her, always. But he wouldn\u2019t have to worry.</p><p>\u201cThorne,\u201d she whispered, \u201cyou should come. They\u2019re expecting it.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cTime\u2019s growing too short. My ship leaves from Hastings in just a few weeks. I suppose I could escort you as far as\u2014\u201d</p><p>Her hand clasped his. \u201cI\u2019m not asking you escort me,\u201d she said gently. \u201cI\u2019m asking you to come with me. And stay with me. With the family.\u201d</p><p>Stay? With the family?</p><p>He gazed at her in disbelief. \u201cIf you don\u2019t feel safe with them on your own, you needn\u2019t go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel perfectly safe. That\u2019s not my meaning.\u201d She paused. \u201cI want you there, too. I know your own childhood was . . . less than idyllic.\u201d</p><p>He harrumphed. \u201cSomething less than it. Yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, perhaps this can be your chance to feel a part of something larger than yourself. Part of a strange, delightful, loving family. Don\u2019t you want that, deep inside? Just a little?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could never be a part of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>He blew out a breath. \u201cYou don\u2019t know me.\u201d</p><p>She bit her lip. \u201cBut I do. I do know you. Because I know myself. And I\u2019ve been a lonely person, too.\u201d She took another step toward him, speaking softly. \u201cI know how it wears on a soul. How it eats little pieces of your heart at unexpected times. How you can go whole weeks happily occupied, feeling no melancholy or deprivation, and then the smallest thing . . . Someone opens a letter, perhaps. Or stitches up a ripped garment that belongs to someone else. And it makes you realize how . . . adrift you are. Not tied to anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd don\u2019t try to tell me that you have no emotions. That you\u2019re incapable of feeling anything at all. I know there\u2019s a heart in there.\u201d</p><p>It would seem there was. The cursed thing was pounding like a damned drum.</p><p>\u201cThink this through,\u201d he said sternly. \u201cYou\u2019re not making sense. If the Gramercys make you part of their family, you will move in new circles of society. You could have a gentleman for a husband.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA gentleman who wants me for connections and money? Perhaps. I\u2019d rather have the man who wants me.\u201d She slid her arms around his neck. \u201cYou said you wanted me once.\u201d</p><p>Her nearness tormented him. Like all the ladies, she\u2019d taken a great deal of care with her appearance today. Embroidered flowers covered the overskirt of her lavender gown. The high waistline of her bodice plumped her breasts like twin pillows\u2014pillows edged with gold lace. She wore ribbons and flowers carefully braided into her hair.</p><p>It was far too quiet. They were much too alone.</p><p>\u201cOf course I want you,\u201d he said roughly. \u201cEvery thought in my head is of you. Tasting you, touching you, taking you in ways your innocent mind can\u2019t even fathom. I don\u2019t know a cursed thing about art or music or Aristotle. My every thought is crude and base and so far beneath you, it might as well be on the opposite side of the earth.\u201d</p><p>Her cheeks colored. \u201cI\u2019ve told you, you\u2019re not beneath me.\u201d</p><p>Damn it. How could he make her understand?</p><p>\u201cI own four books. Four.\u201d</p><p>She laughed a little. \u201cWhat on earth does that signify?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt signifies everything. Your life is about to change, forever. I won\u2019t let you cling to me just because you\u2019re scared. It\u2019s not right. It\u2019s not what\u2019s best.\u201d</p><p>She moved closer. \u201cWe could marry, Thorne. I\u2019m not asking for much. You can just . . . be yourself, and I\u2019ll amuse myself trying to make you happy. I know it\u2019ll be a challenge, but I\u2019m strangely keen to try.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor God\u2019s sake, Katie. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how to explain it.\u201d Her gaze searched his face. \u201cHave you ever known true hunger, Thorne? Not just a missed meal or two, but prolonged deprivation. No proper food for days on end.\u201d</p><p>He let a few seconds pass before affirming it. \u201cWeeks.\u201d</p><p>Years.</p><p>\u201cThen you must understand. Even now, surrounded by plenty, food looks different to you than it does to others, doesn\u2019t it? It tastes richer, means more. Years later, and you can\u2019t bring yourself to let the smallest scrap go to waste.\u201d</p><p>He nodded tightly.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s not waste this,\u201d she whispered, reaching for him. \u201cI don\u2019t know what it is between us, but I know I\u2019ve hungered for it all my life. Maybe other women could walk away, but not me. Never me.\u201d She touched his cheek. \u201cI think you\u2019re hungry for it, too.\u201d</p><p>She could have no notion. None. His heart was starved to a wasted shadow, with nothing left to offer now.</p><p>A smile spread across her face, broad with mischief. \u201cJust think of all we could have. Two unwanted orphans, taking on London society. We\u2019d wring more pleasure from every moment than people like the Gramercys can find in a year. Can you tell me honestly that you want no part of that life?\u201d</p><p>Staying here in England and living on Lord Drewe\u2019s charity? Enduring endless balls and dinners and hunting parties? Always feeling like the outsider; forever knowing he was so much less than she deserved? He wouldn\u2019t even be able to support her like a real man. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He looked her in the eye. \u201cI want no part of that life. It\u2019s time for you to release me.\u201d</p><p>Her lovely hazel eyes softened and her gaze fell to his lips.</p><p>\u201cI just can\u2019t,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not letting you go.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Thirteen</p><p>Kiss me, Kate willed silently.</p><p>Please. I\u2019ve just laid my heart at your feet. Kiss me now, or I\u2019ll die of disappointment.</p><p>She knew he was tempted. He stared at her mouth so intently, she could taste the softness and strength and heat of his lips. Her own jaw softened in response. She could see it so clearly, in her mind\u2019s eye. Just how that kiss would go. She would be yielding and open, inviting him in. The boldness of his possession would shock and excite her. She would cling to him, and his big hands would roam every bit of her body. Their kiss would be frenzied at first, and then slow, sweet.</p><p>\u201cThorne.\u201d</p><p>She caught his gaze. His pupils were so dilated, his eyes were almost entirely black. Even so, that thin orbit of blue was so intense, so piercing\u2014she felt it inside her.</p><p>A sudden realization gave her a thrill. In her imagination, they were kissing. In his mind, they were doing something much more intimate. More animal, with far fewer clothes.</p><p>The thought enflamed her. Inexperienced as she was, she knew enough to sense her feminine power in the situation. He might say no to family and comfort and connection. But could he truly refuse this?</p><p>She leaned forward until her cheek met his. Just a simple press of skin to skin, and it was like nothing she\u2019d ever felt.</p><p>\u201cIs it . . .\u201d She forced herself to ask, \u201cIs it always like this? With your other women?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head slowly. The scrape of his whiskers against her jaw\u2014oh, it made her wild. But it wasn\u2019t enough.</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d she prompted. She had to hear him say it. She had to hear him say something. His voice could stroke her, so very deep.</p><p>At last he gave her what she craved. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>That dark, thrilling syllable whispered hot against her ear and sank into her very bones.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d she asked, breathily. \u201cShouldn\u2019t we do something about it?</p><p>He groaned and shuddered, and she suspected he was mentally thumbing through a whole catalog of things he would like to do about it. Some sort of lovemaking drill book with all possible positions and maneuvers clearly defined. The precise contents would be a mystery to her\u2014but she was ready and willing to learn.</p><p>Shameless, she tugged on his neck and pulled him forward until she could kiss his ear.</p><p>He sighed. \u201cI can\u2019t give you what you need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I think you can.\u201d She caught his earlobe in her teeth and worried it.</p> <p>With a husky groan, he gave in. He dipped his head, and his strong lips brushed her pulse.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t see yourself,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re around the Gramercys, it\u2019s like a flame comes to life inside you.\u201d He marched a column of kisses down her neck. \u201cYou don\u2019t light up for me.\u201d</p><p>She pressed her body to his. \u201cI burn for you, Thorne. I\u2019ve never felt this way. I never knew I wanted to feel this way.\u201d</p><p>She pulled at his neckcloth, unknotting the fabric and tugging it free. She pressed a kiss to the dark notch at the base of his throat, then nuzzled there, inhaling the arousing musk of his skin. His raspy breathing gave her hope.</p><p>She was getting to him. Delving through the layers, uncovering the man beneath.</p><p>All those buttons of his coat must come next. She worked the top one loose with trembling fingers.</p><p>\u201cYou called me scared,\u201d she said, \u201cand I am frightened. But not the way you think. I\u2019m terrified that I\u2019ll part ways with you, and I\u2019ll live my whole life without feeling this again.\u201d</p><p>She chanced a look at him then, pleading with her eyes. Begging him to give in to her, to take control of this . . . just do something, before she was forced to rip open her bodice and say something truly embarrassing like, Make me a woman.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s only desire you\u2019re feeling.\u201d His brow was heavy, disapproving. \u201cCuriosity. If I give in to it, you\u2019ll despise me afterward.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could never despise you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you could. You spent a full year doing just that.\u201d</p><p>She cursed under her breath. He would have to point that out. \u201cI was a fool. I didn\u2019t know you. I didn\u2019t know my own heart.\u201d</p><p>His gaze sharpened. \u201cWhat makes you think you know it now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she said honestly. \u201cI don\u2019t know. But this afternoon, Lark Gramercy came to me and offered everything I ever thought I wanted. A family. A home. Security, friendship, society. More wealth than I\u2019d ever dreamed. And at that moment, I knew in my heart it still wouldn\u2019t be enough. Either I\u2019m the most greedy, ungrateful woman in England, or I\u2019m . . .\u201d</p><p>God, could it be true?</p><p>Her heart told her it must be. Nothing else made sense.</p><p>\u201cThorne, I think I\u2019m falling in love with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKatie.\u201d He took her face in his hands. Roughly, and with a possessive power that thrilled her. A brooding divot formed between his eyebrows. \u201cKatie, you\u2019re so\u2014\u201d</p><p>She wondered what delightfully misanthropic word he would choose this time. Wrongheaded? Foolish? Stubborn?</p><p>Kissable, apparently.</p><p>He gave up on words and claimed her mouth instead, kissing her with more passion and fire than she would have ever dared to hope. One of his hands slid down her back, coasting over silk and sweeping hot sensation all the way to the base of her spine. But he didn\u2019t stop there. His touch dipped farther. He spread his fingers to cup her backside, then lifted and squeezed, pulling her pelvis flush against his. Pleasure sparkled through her veins. She moaned into his kiss and clutched his neck so hard, her fingernails would surely leave marks. He didn\u2019t seem to mind.</p><p>He kissed her deeply, pushing her jaw wide and swallowing her desperate gasps of pleasure. She writhed against him, pressing close to feel the abundant evidence of his lust for her. The solid ridge of his arousal pulsed against her belly. She wanted to feel that heat where it belonged\u2014against her sex. As they kissed, she twined one leg around his booted calf, grasping his shoulders to work herself higher . . . closer . . .</p><p>Drat.</p><p>Badger pulled them back from the brink of paradise. Some yards away, the puppy started barking like a creature possessed.</p><p>\u201cIgnore the dog,\u201d she murmured, tugging Thorne back to the kiss. Catching and sipping at his bottom lip. \u201cHe\u2019s perfectly fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s fine,\u201d he echoed. \u201cIt\u2019s just another rat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Yes.</p><p>His hand swept over her curves, lingering for a brief, delicious squeeze of her backside before dipping to caress her thigh. He gathered a large fistful of her skirt and tugged, drawing her body just as tight and close as she craved and exposing her ankles to the cooling afternoon air.</p><p>With one hand, he delved under her skirts and petticoats, encircling her thigh in his grip. The feel of his work-roughed palm against her stockinged leg inflamed her. And her desire only mounted as he swept his touch higher still. Over her ribbon garter, up the sensitive slope of her bare inner thigh, and . . .</p><p>There.</p><p>It amazed her, how easily he claimed her most intimate, untouched places, and how little timidity she felt. His fingertips traced the cleft of her sex, slipping easily over her aroused flesh.</p><p>\u201cSo wet,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>The words shocked her. She wanted to hear more.</p><p>He stilled, resting his temple against hers. His breath stirred her hair as he traced her intimate flesh in slow, tantalizing strokes.</p><p>\u201cFor me?\u201d he whispered. The vulnerable rasp in his voice undid her.</p><p>She kissed his jaw. \u201cFor you. Only you.\u201d</p><p>He rewarded her boldness. Deftly parting her folds, he slipped one broad, callused fingertip inside.</p><p>A startled cry of joy escaped her.</p><p>\u201cHush,\u201d he soothed. \u201cHush. I won\u2019t take too much. Only let me ease you this once.\u201d He nibbled lightly at her ear and neck, stroking deeper. \u201cYou\u2019ll feel better afterward, see matters clearer. It will be enough.\u201d</p><p>Enough? What foolishness. She\u2019d never known such an exquisite blend of sensual relief and desperate hunger for more. He claimed her lips in a kiss, and their moans mingled as he cupped her sex in his clever, wicked hand. His tongue and his finger thrust in unison, moving deeper by gentle yet steady degrees. She gripped his shoulders, rocked by wave after wave of devious pleasure.</p><p>Yes. Oh, yes. She wanted this. Him inside her. The two of them, joined in every way. And it would never be enough. She would always crave more.</p><p>More.</p><p>His hand stilled.</p><p>Kate panted for breath. Was something wrong?</p><p>Apparently so. He withdrew his touch completely, letting her skirts fall loose to the ground, and Kate\u2019s muddled senses finally gathered why.</p><p>It was Badger again. More barking. More dashing about. More ruining everything.</p><p>Drat, drat, drat.</p><p>With a muttered curse, Thorne turned to follow the dog with his eyes. \u201cHe\u2019s got his sights on something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly a rat, surely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps.\u201d</p><p>The dog disappeared around a corner of the castle ruins, growling and snarling as he went.</p><p>\u201cBut perhaps not.\u201d Thorne released her with a sigh of obvious regret. \u201cIt\u2019s not like him to behave that way.\u201d</p><p>That was it, then. The moment was gone.</p><p>Thorne strode off in pursuit. Resigned to it, Kate picked up her skirts and followed after both dog and man.</p><p>They rounded the corner of a crumbling sandstone wall.</p><p>Badger had his quarry cornered in a shadowy niche. The puppy stood at attention, growling at whatever it was he\u2019d captured.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see any rat,\u201d Kate said, drawing nearer. \u201cPerhaps it\u2019s only a tiny vole?\u201d She moved closer to investigate.</p><p>Thorne caught her by the arm, holding her back. \u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Kate froze. When uttered in that tone, it wasn\u2019t a command she could refuse.</p><p>Then she saw the reason for his sudden change in demeanor. It wasn\u2019t a rat or a vole Badger had cornered, but a snake. A long, thick adder curling in on itself and weaving figure eights in the matted grass\u2014less than a yard from her slippers. A thin tendril of tongue flickered out, and the snake\u2019s hiss crawled down her spine.</p><p>The puppy\u2014brave, foolish thing\u2014stood his ground at her feet, still snarling and preparing to pounce.</p><p>She could see very easily what would happen. The snake was backed into a corner, and the creature no doubt knew\u2014in whatever way snakes knew these things\u2014its only chance of escape was to strike.</p><p>\u201cOh. He\u2019ll be bitten.\u201d Kate struggled against Thorne\u2019s grip. \u201cBadger, no. Come away from that horrid thing.\u201d</p><p>She attempted to reach for him, but Thorne held her back.</p><p>\u201cShush,\u201d he said firmly. \u201cI\u2019ll see to him. Just don\u2019t move.\u201d</p><p>He released her arm. Kate clenched her fists at her sides to keep still. Her fingernails bit into her palms.</p><p>Thorne planted his boots in the grassy turf. Then, moving with excruciating slowness, he stretched his right arm as he leaned forward, spreading his fingers wide. As he leaned, the full length of his hard thigh pressed against the back of her leg. She could feel the leashed power in his every small motion.</p><p>Just a little farther. A few inches more and he\u2019d be able to snatch the puppy by the scruff, deliver him up and away.</p><p>Oh, hurry, she pleaded inwardly, even though she knew sudden movements would be disaster.</p><p>Thorne ceased moving altogether. His outstretched right arm went ramrod straight, and she could feel the energy tensing in his muscles. It made the hairs on her arm lift. Like quiet thunder rumbling through a cloud.</p><p>Then came the lightning strike.</p><p>With a powerful lunge forward, he reached out\u2014 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And grabbed the snake.</p><p>Five seconds and it was over. Once Thorne had the adder in hand, he doubled the length and snapped its spine. The writhing coil of green-sheathed muscle fell lifeless to the ground.</p><p>Badger kept right on barking.</p> <p>Kate fell to her knees, scooping up the dog, clutching him to her chest and peppering his fur with kisses.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you do that?\u201d she asked Thorne. \u201cYou might have just reached for Badger and pulled him out of harm\u2019s way.\u201d</p><p>Thorne shook his head. \u201cThat snake was going to strike when I did,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I\u2019d reached for the dog, those fangs would have found your ankle instead.\u201d</p><p>Good Lord. He\u2019d never had any intention of reaching for Badger. He just grabbed for the snake with his bare hand, rather than risk it biting her. How exceedingly reckless and stupidly brave.</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have done that.\u201d</p> <p>Leaning against the stone wall, he turned his hand this way and that. \u201cI reckoned I could weather it.\u201d</p><p>Kate\u2019s heart stalled. \u201cWhat do you mean? Were you bitten?\u201d</p><p>When he didn\u2019t answer, she released Badger and scrambled to her feet.</p><p>\u201cLet me look.\u201d She reached for his wrist, and he did not fight her as she raised his big, roughened hand to the light for examination. \u201cOh, no.\u201d</p><p>There they were. Two neat, round punctures just where the heel of his hand met his wrist. The area around the bite was already puffing with blood.</p><p>\u201cWe must go to your quarters. Do you have a medical kit? This needs to be treated, and quickly.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s only an adder bite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly? Only an adder bite?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cJust a scratch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA scratch infected with venom.\u201d She pulled on his sleeve, tugging him back toward the castle keep.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of me. It would take more than a few drops of poison to bring me down.\u201d</p><p>Nevertheless, he walked with her to the corner of the keep that served as his personal quarters. As he nudged the door open with his left shoulder, she saw him misjudge his step and stumble against the door.</p><p>\u201cAre you dizzy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust . . . a misstep.\u201d But he stayed there, leaning against the door, his eyes unfocused. \u201cGive me a minute.\u201d</p> <p>Absolutely not. At the rate his hand was swelling, she wouldn\u2019t give him another second.</p><p>She found a stool beside the lone, small table and braced it against the turret\u2019s interior stone wall.</p><p>\u201cSit down,\u201d she ordered. He might be a big, intimidating infantry officer, accustomed to having men march, load, and fire at his command\u2014but she would not be countermanded on this score. She grabbed his good arm and pulled with all her might.</p><p>Oof. He barely budged. Goodness, he was just an enormous lump of masculinity, all muscle and heavy boots. There was a lot of him, as he\u2019d said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m well,\u201d he protested.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m worried. Humor me.\u201d</p><p>Kate coaxed him to the stool and made sure he sat with his back well braced against the wall. Badger came to his heels, sniffing about his boots and making small whining noises.</p><p>Once Thorne was seated, she began tugging at his sleeve. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. We have to remove your coat.\u201d</p><p>She began with the sleeve of his injured right arm, carefully drawing the red wool sheath down until he could pull his entire arm free. She eased a hand behind his shoulder to help him out of the sleeve. An involuntary tremor passed through his sculpted shoulder muscles\u2014a whispered confession of the danger he faced, despite his impressive size and strength. Kate shivered in response.</p><p>While she propped his wounded wrist on the table for examination, he twisted his torso and shook the garment down his left arm. The red coat slid to the floor.</p><p>He gave the discarded coat a regretful look. She knew it must pain him to see the uniform crumpled on the ground. But he didn\u2019t bend to retrieve it.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps I\u2019m not so well,\u201d he said.</p><p>Her pounding pulse accelerated. If he admitted it, he must be very bad off indeed.</p><p>A serrated knife lay on the table. She reached for it.</p><p>\u201cBe still,\u201d she warned.</p><p>With clumsy swipes of the blade, she laid open the linen sleeve of his shirt, rending it all the way up to the elbow. Angry streaks of red blazed from the adder bite. She could follow those streaks halfway up his thick, muscled forearm, even through the covering of dark hair. She needed a tourniquet.</p><p>When she raised her head to ask Thorne where one might be, she saw that his face had gone pale. A thin sheen of perspiration covered his brow, and his breathing was uneven. She reached for his unknotted cravat and worked it loose with trembling fingers. He tilted his head back to assist her. As her fingers brushed the freshly shaven skin of his throat, she could see the pulse beating beneath his jaw, as though a butterfly were trapped under his skin.</p><p>His Adam\u2019s apple bobbed. \u201cYou\u2019re undressing me,\u201d he said thickly.</p><p>\u201cIt can\u2019t be helped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWasn\u2019t complaining.\u201d</p><p>Once she had the cravat free, she doubled the arm\u2019s-length strip of fabric and wound it around his arm, just below the elbow. She took one end of the fabric and clenched it in her teeth, then pulled the other end with both hands. Her efforts wrenched a groan of pain from his throat. By the time the thing was in place, she was huffing for breath and sweating just as much as he was.</p><p>\u201cWhere is your medical kit?\u201d she asked, already scanning the room for likely places.</p><p>He slid his gaze toward a battered wooden chest on a high shelf.</p><p>Kate hastened to the shelf and stretched up on her toes to retrieve the box.</p><p>When she turned back, she nearly dropped it. Thorne had the knife in his left hand. His sweat-covered brow was furrowed with concentration and he was pressing the serrated blade against the angry, swollen skin at his wrist.</p><p>\u201cOh, don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>He grimaced and twisted the knife. A growl of pain forced through his clenched teeth, but his hand didn\u2019t falter. Before she could reach his side, he\u2019d turned the blade a quarter turn and slashed through the distended flesh again. Blood flowed freely from the crossed incisions.</p><p>He let the knife fall to the table and slumped back against the wall, breathing hard.</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019d you do that?\u201d she asked, carrying the kit to the table.</p><p>\u201cSo you wouldn\u2019t have to.\u201d</p><p>Kate was thankful. She knew he\u2019d done the right thing. Releasing the blood\u2014and venom\u2014from the swollen area was necessary, lest it travel to other parts of his body. But the sight of so much blood stunned her motionless for a moment. She had helped Susanna a time or two when she\u2019d treated the villagers\u2019 illnesses and injuries. But that was offering a bit of assistance to a skilled, competent healer. This was the two of them, alone with desperate measures.</p><p>He could die.</p><p>A wave of nausea passed through her. She rode the crest of it, then put a hand to her belly and willed herself to be calm.</p><p>Kate opened the chest and found a clean-looking length of gauze in the medical kit. She used it to dab blood from the seeping wound.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t bind it,\u201d he said. \u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI know. What do we do next?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou go back to the village. I either live or I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>The words were so absurd, she choked on a wild laugh. \u201cAre you mad, Thorne? I\u2019m not leaving you.\u201d</p><p>She rifled through the bottles and jars in the medical kit, straining to read the faded labels. None of the contents looked familiar. \u201cYou said you own four books. I don\u2019t suppose any are books of physic?\u201d</p><p>He nodded toward a shelf. Kate dashed to it and found a well-thumbed military drill book, a Bible coated in dust, a bound collection of geographical magazines . . .</p><p>\u201cAha.\u201d She seized on a large black volume and peered at the title. \u201cTreatment of Ailments and Injuries in . . .\u201d Her hope dwindled as she read the remainder aloud. \u201c . . . in Horses and Cattle? Thorne, this is a veterinary book.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been called a beast.\u201d He closed his eyes.</p><p>Kate decided she didn\u2019t have the time to be particular. She quickly paged through the book until she found the section on bites and stings. \u201cHere we are. Adder bites. \u2018The sting of the adder is rarely fatal.\u2019 Well, that\u2019s reassuring.\u201d</p><p>Although she would have felt a great deal better had it read \u201cthe sting of the adder is never fatal.\u201d To say adder bites were \u201crarely fatal\u201d seemed to her the same as saying \u201cadder bites are occasionally fatal,\u201d and Thorne did pride himself on being an exception to ordinary conduct.</p><p>But there was a lot of him, she reminded herself. And all of it was young, healthy, and strong. Very strong.</p><p>There were several possible remedies suggested in the text.</p><p>She read aloud, \u201c \u2018First, squeeze out the blood.\u2019 We\u2019ve done that, haven\u2019t we? Good.\u201d She made an impatient swipe at a lock of hair dangling in her face and continued. \u201c \u2018Take a handful of the herb crosswort, some gentian and rue, boil together in a thin broth with Spanish pepper and some ends of broom, and when that is done, strain and boil with some white wine for about an . . .\u2019 \u201d She growled. \u201cAbout an hour?\u201d</p><p>Drat. She didn\u2019t have time to go scouting for a dozen different herbs, much less boil them for an hour. She didn\u2019t even dare leave Thorne for the time it would take to run to the village for help.</p><p>She glanced at his face again. God, he was so pale. And his arm was entirely swollen now. Despite the tourniquet, those streaks of red had reached his elbow and beyond. His fingers were purple in some places.</p><p>\u201cDo be calm,\u201d she said, even as anxiety pitched her voice. \u201cI\u2019ve several more remedies to go through.\u201d</p><p>She went back to the book. The next suggested remedy was to wash the affected area with salt and . . .</p><p>Urine.</p><p>Oh, good Lord. At least that substance was obtainable, but still. She couldn\u2019t. She couldn\u2019t possibly. Or perhaps she could, to preserve a man\u2019s life. But she\u2019d never be able to look at the preserved man again.</p><p>She sent up a fervent prayer that the third remedy would prove suitable to save both his life and their combined dignity. She read aloud with rapidity. \u201c \u2018Lay a plaster to the area, with a salve made of calamint pounded with turpentine and yellow wax. And give the animal some infusion of calamint to drink, as a tea or mixed in milk.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>Calamint. Calamint sounded perfect. If only she had some.</p><p>Kate went back to the medical kit and peered at all the contents of the bottles. She uncorked a vial stuffed with a dried herb that looked promising. When she held it to her nose and sniffed, she supposed it smelled as much like calamint as anything.</p><p>She looked around the room. There was a great deal to be done. Light a fire, boil water, melt wax, pound the salve, make a tea. And Thorne was tilting dangerously on that stool she\u2019d given him. At any moment he\u2019d topple the small pedestal table and crash to the floor.</p><p>She decided his wound had bled long enough. The extreme swelling had slowed the blood flow to an ooze, anyhow. She wrapped a bit of linen about his wrist as a loose bandage, then made her way to his good side.</p><p>\u201cUp,\u201d she directed, sliding her shoulder beneath his unbitten arm. \u201cWe\u2019re going to take you to the bed.\u201d</p><p>As she helped him to his feet, she could feel his eyes on her. His stare was heavy and intent.</p><p>\u201cAm I causing you pain?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cAlways. Every time you\u2019re near.\u201d</p><p>She turned her face away to hide her wounded reaction. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot what I meant.\u201d He sounded drunk. With his healthy hand, he nudged her jaw until she faced him. \u201cYou\u2019re too beautiful. It hurts.\u201d</p><p>Wonderful. Now he was hallucinating.</p><p>Together, they shuffled toward his narrow bed. It was only a distance of a half-dozen feet, but it felt like miles. Her spine hunched under his formidable weight. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>At last they reached the edge of the mattress. She managed to turn them so that when she removed her support, he sat down on the edge of the bed. Without much urging from her, he reclined onto his back.</p><p>There. That took care of head, shoulders, and torso. Now, to get his legs on the mattress, too.</p><p>\u201cI feel strange,\u201d he said dreamily. \u201cHeavy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou are heavy,\u201d she muttered, straining to lift one of his massive boots from the floor and heave his leg onto the bed. Goodness, lifting him felt like lifting a statue carved of granite. Once she had the first leg in place, the second came easier. Badger leapt onto the bed and curled between his boots.</p><p>She leaned over him to place the pillow under his head.</p><p>\u201cI can see down your bodice,\u201d he remarked.</p><p>A thrill shot down her spine, leaving her body through the soles of her feet.</p><p>Really, Kate. This isn\u2019t the time.</p> <p>She laid the back of her hand to his forehead. Hot to the touch.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re feverish. I need to strip the rest of your shirt, to cool your body and ease your breathing.\u201d</p><p>She reached for the knife, wiped it clean of blood, and used it to make a notch in the neckline of his shirt. Then she grabbed both sides and ripped it straight down the front, pushing the halves to either side and working the remaining sleeve down his good arm.</p><p>When she\u2019d bared his chest, she startled. He didn\u2019t seem to notice her shock, and she wasn\u2019t sure whether his insensibility was a fortunate thing or a very bad sign.</p><p>But since he didn\u2019t notice . . . she openly stared. His chest was hard, sculpted muscle covered with tanned skin. She saw a liberal sprinkling of dark hair, a few healed scars . . .</p><p>And tattoos. Several tattoos.</p> <p>Kate had heard of such things. She knew many sailors had patterns or pictures inked into their skin, but she\u2019d never seen an example in person, to her recollection. Definitely not this close.</p><p>Not all of Thorne\u2019s tattoos were patterns or pictures. There was an abstract design of some kind on his upper right chest, encircled by a medallion just smaller than her palm. On his shoulder was a tiny, crudely drawn flower\u2014rather like a Tudor rose. A row of numbers marched up the underside of his left arm. And on the side of his rib cage, she found a pair of letters: B and C.</p><p>So primitive. So fascinating. She couldn\u2019t help but lay her fingers to those letters and wonder what they meant. The initials of some former sweetheart, perhaps? She knew he\u2019d had lovers, but the notion of Thorne with a sweetheart seemed absurd. Almost as absurd as the spike of jealousy twisting in her chest.</p><p>But when she touched his skin, the scalding heat reminded her of the larger task at hand. Keeping this immense, stubborn, tattooed man alive.</p><p>She tried to rise from the bed, but his good arm shot out to catch her. He still had some strength in him, apparently, and he used it to pull her close.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYou smell so good.\u201d His eyes were closed, and his voice was a low, rummy drawl. \u201cLike clover.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed. \u201cI don\u2019t even know what clover smells like.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen you need a good roll in it.\u201d</p><p>She laughed a little. If he was making jokes, he couldn\u2019t be beyond hope.</p><p>Then his muscles seized and his eyes rolled back as he thrashed on the mattress. She put her hands to his chest and leaned all her weight on them, holding him to the bed.</p><p>He fell limp, panting. His hand found and tangled in her loosened hair. \u201cKatie. I\u2019m dying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not dying. Adder bites are rarely fatal. That\u2019s what the book said. But I need to make you some salve, and a tea.\u201d</p><p>He held her fast, forbidding her to move. \u201cI\u2019m dying. Stay with me.\u201d</p><p>Desperation pressed on her, but Kate forcibly held it at bay. She reminded herself of what Susanna had once told her\u2014big, strong men always made the worst, most infantile patients when forced to a sickbed. If they took sick with a cold, they moaned and complained as though they were at death\u2019s door. Thorne was simply overreacting. She hoped.</p><p>She stroked a touch over his perspiring brow. \u201cYou\u2019ll be fine. I\u2019ll just go make you some\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do. I know you far better than you give me credit for. I know you\u2019re brave and good and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t know. You don\u2019t recall me. But it\u2019s best. When I first arrived, I worried. Feared you might place me. At times, I almost hoped you would. But it\u2019s . . .\u201d He drew a raspy breath. \u201cIt\u2019s best this way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Kate\u2019s every nerve jumped to attention. \u201cIt\u2019s best what way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve done so well for yourself, Katie. If she could see you, she\u2019d be . . . so proud . . .\u201d His voice trailed off and he closed his eyes.</p><p>What did he just say?</p><p>She shook his arm. \u201cWho? Who\u2019d be proud?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSing for me,\u201d he whispered. \u201cYour sweet voice will be the last thing I hear. I\u2019ll carry a little echo of heaven with me, even when they drag me down to hell.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t know what to make of any of his rambling. Perhaps he was simply delirious. That had to be the explanation.</p><p>\u201cI have to pound the herbs,\u201d she choked out. \u201cThere\u2019s a salve you need, and then some tea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSing.\u201d His grip on her hair went slack, and he pulled his fingers through her loosened curls. \u201cOnly not . . . not the garden. Not the blossoms so fair. Don\u2019t sing that verse for me.\u201d</p><p>She froze, stunned. \u201cHow do you know that song? When did you hear me sing it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways hated . . . hearing it from your lips.\u201d</p><p>She searched her memory, trying to recall if she\u2019d ever sung that verse in his presence. She didn\u2019t think so. Even if she had, why would he hate it? \u201cHave you been following me? Spying on me?\u201d</p><p>He made no answer.</p><p>Well, Kate needed answers, and she was going to have them. She extricated herself from his grasp. \u201cLie still in that bed and let me make you some salve. We will talk about all this when you\u2019ve recovered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKatie, just sing to me. I\u2019m dy\u2014\u201d</p><p>She grabbed him by the jaw and gave his head a brisk shake, forcing him to open his eyes. His pupils were so wide, there was almost no blue in them.</p><p>\u201cYou are not dying,\u201d she told him. \u201cDo you hear me, Thorne?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye.\u201d His eyes slowly focused on her face. \u201cBut just in case . . .\u201d</p><p>He pulled her mouth down to his, catching her in a kiss.</p><p>A wild, feverish, dangling-on-the-brink-of-death kiss.</p><p>He\u2019d caught her unawares, lips parted. The result was a passionate, open-mouthed tangle of tongues and teeth. There was nothing tender in this kiss, nor even seductive. It was hot, possessive, fierce, and it held nothing back for tomorrow. As his tongue swept deep into her mouth, again and again, she could taste his hunger and desperation. His need resonated as a deep ache in her bones.</p><p>And she found herself answering. Out of pure instinct, she was kissing him back. Letting her tongue rub against his. With each slide of that sweet friction, desire spiraled through her. He moaned against her mouth and gripped her so tightly it hurt.</p><p>When the kiss broke apart, Kate was left reeling.</p><p>Which put her better off than Thorne, who slumped back onto the bed, unconscious.</p><p>\u201cNo. No.\u201d</p><p>Frantic, she put a hand to his throat and felt for his pulse. It was there. Steady, if rather fast.</p><p>She had to act quickly. She rose from the bedside. From the table, she gathered up the vial of calamint.</p><p>Salve first. Tea, second. Prayers, third.</p><p>Extensive questioning later on.</p><p>As she took the tinderbox to the hearth, she spoke to him. \u201cYou are not going to die, do you understand me? I will not allow it. I am going to save your life if I have to barter with the devil for it.\u201d</p><p>Whatever information Thorne was hiding, she\u2019d be damned if she let him take it to his grave. She needed answers.</p><p>And she needed him.</p><p>Chapter Fourteen</p><p>He dreamt of a giant serpent. A thick rope of ominous power, sliding down the narrow alleys of London. Twining through gardens and thickets in Kent. Last, snaking over the low, rolling hills of Sussex . . . tracing the scent of salt all the way to the ocean. It had followed him here, to this ancient castle, where it slithered in through the turret\u2019s smoke vent and dropped to the bed. It wound its length again and again about his arm.</p><p>It squeezed.</p><p>Devil take me.</p><p>The pressure was so intense, Thorne sensed his very bones pulverizing. Then, as if inflicting that flesh-grinding pain wasn\u2019t enough, the dream snake settled on his chest. Each breath felt like a struggle to lift a hundredweight with his ribs.</p><p>Thorne wrestled the scaly beast for untold hours, thrashing and grappling with the pain. Finally, mercifully, it faded into blackness.</p><p>Sometime later he woke with a start.</p><p>All was dark, save for firelight. He couldn\u2019t move. Repeated efforts to draw up his legs or rise to a sitting position came to naught. His limbs wouldn\u2019t obey his commands.</p><p>He stared up at the ceiling, panting for breath. A bead of sweat trickled from his brow to his ear. The room was thick with the scents of herbs and tallow.</p><p>How much time had passed? Hours? Days?</p><p>He heard someone rustling over by the hearth.</p><p>\u201cKatie?\u201d he croaked.</p><p>She didn\u2019t hear him. As she went about stirring the fire, she hummed a little tune.</p><p>He closed his eyes and went back to that very first day. He\u2019d entered the Bull and Blossom and there she\u2019d been. Singing.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t recognized her, not at first. How could he? She was a woman now, near twenty years older than when he\u2019d seen her last. And her profile was to him\u2014the unmarked side. To his battle-weary eyes, she was just a fresh-faced girl in white.</p><p>To his ears, she was some sort of angel.</p><p>She hit this note\u2014a soft, plaintive trill\u2014and that was it. He was done for.</p><p>That note found the vulnerable slot between his plates of armor, wriggled in deep and sank in teeth. Her voice was the sweetest venom. It was in his blood, his heart, pumping all through his body before he could muster any defense. All sorts of impulses swelled in response: affinity, desire, protectiveness. An intense, sudden hunger for her approval.</p><p>Naturally, a well-bred lady of accomplishment would not look at a man like him. Nor should she. He\u2019d formed no plans or expectations. But simply to know he could feel such things was a source of true wonder. He\u2019d been numb for so long.</p><p>She\u2019d struck the last chord, and the music eased into a full, vibrating silence. He would not have noticed a powder blast in the lane.</p><p>Then she\u2019d risen from the pianoforte to take her seat. He saw the mark at her temple, and the truth detonated.</p><p>Good Lord. It was her. Katie.</p><p>Waifish, sweet-faced Katie, all grown up. Now it all made sense. There was a reason he felt a strong sense of recognition\u2014because he did know her. He felt protective toward her because she\u2019d once been in his keeping. And that hunger for her approval . . . it too had its roots in a time long past, when she\u2019d looked up to him with something akin to worship in her eyes.</p><p>All these impulses inside him . . . they were echoes of something he\u2019d lost long ago. Some memory of the humanity that had long since been beaten, starved, and flogged out of him.</p><p>She didn\u2019t know him, of course. She couldn\u2019t have remembered\u2014she\u2019d been too young, and now they were too different. They\u2019d started in the same low trough of their youth but climbed opposites sides of the valley. Now there was a chasm between them, and even if she shaded her brow and peered hard, she\u2019d probably never recognize him across it. But what mattered was that she had survived. She\u2019d forged a new life well apart from that squalid misery they once shared. And he\u2019d vowed to himself then and there\u2014no matter how alluring he found her, he would never do anything to jeopardize her happiness. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A year of mostly successful avoidance. And then he made the idiot mistake of letting her hold his dog. A lurcher pup bred too well for his own good, cornering the first snake he happened to meet.</p><p>Badger lay curled at the foot of the bed. Thorne glowered at the sleeping ball of fur. This is all your fault, I hope you know.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re awake.\u201d Soft footfalls crossed to the bedside. A cool hand pressed to his brow. \u201cI\u2019m here.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow long have I been insensible?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince yesterday afternoon. It\u2019s a few hours yet before dawn, I think.\u201d She stroked the hair back from his brow. \u201cThank God your fever\u2019s broken. And the swelling\u2019s much improved.\u201d</p><p>He let his head fall to one side and surveyed his condition. Most of his body was draped with a clean white linen sheet, save for his injured right arm, which lay atop the bedclothes. The tourniquet was gone. A fragrant plaster covered his wound, held in place with strips of flannel. His entire arm had been washed clean, and the swelling had abated. The discoloration remained, however\u2014red streaks and purple-black bruises covered his skin. It looked as though his arm had been caught in a clothespress.</p><p>He\u2019d lived through worse. His arm scarcely hurt anymore. Instead, it felt numb. He flexed his muscles, attempting to make a fist. His fingers gave a feeble twitch.</p><p>Then he tried once more to draw up his legs. Nothing. That worried him.</p> <p>\u201cDrink this.\u201d</p><p>She brought a cup of tea to his lips. He bent his head and sipped. The infusion had an herbal, faintly familiar taste. He thought he recalled her spooning it through his cracked lips sometime during the night.</p><p>\u201cYou stayed by me,\u201d he said. \u201cAll night.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI could not have done otherwise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in your debt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll think of ways you can repay me.\u201d She gave him a wry, cryptic smile.</p> <p>He glanced down at his uncooperative limbs and hesitated. \u201cI . . . I can\u2019t move. I can\u2019t move my body below the neck.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t show quite the concern or dismay he might have expected. \u201cOh, I know you can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He frowned with confusion.</p><p>She reached for the edge of the linen and lifted it, so he might peer beneath. Several lengths of bedsheet and neckcloth were tied about his torso and left arm, lashing him to the bed.</p><p>Bindings. Now that he understood they were there, he could feel similar restraints on his legs. All the knots were well out of reach.</p><p>\u201cWhy would you do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt first, because you were thrashing so much.\u201d</p><p>Damn it. If he\u2019d lashed out at her while he was insensible, he\u2019d never forgive himself.</p> <p>\u201cDid I\u2014\u201d The words stuck. He cleared his throat with a harsh, desperate cough. \u201cDid I hurt you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Thank God.</p><p>\u201cBut you were delirious, and I worried you\u2019d do yourself more harm. So I bound you. And then I left the bindings on because\u201d\u2014she replaced the linen sheet, brought a chair to the bedside and fixed him with a challenging look\u2014\u201dyou have some explaining to do.\u201d</p><p>His heart began to pound. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you? When you fell ill yesterday, you did a great deal of talking. About you and me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMust have been delirious.\u201d He eyed the cup in her hand. \u201cI\u2019ll take some more of that tea, if you will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot just yet.\u201d She balanced the pewter mug between her hands and twisted it back and forth. \u201cYou seemed to think we knew each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe do know each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the past,\u201d she said. \u201cAs children.\u201d</p><p>A knot formed in his throat. He struggled harder against his bindings. \u201cYou must be confused. I don\u2019t recall saying any such thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought that might be the case.\u201d She set the mug aside and reached for a sheet of paper. \u201cFortunately, I wrote it all down.\u201d</p><p>Damn it.</p><p>She smoothed flat the creases in the paper.</p><p>He strove to look bored.</p><p>She made her voice comically deep and gruff. In an imitation of him, he supposed. \u201c \u2018You\u2019ve done so well for yourself, Katie. If she could see you, she\u2019d be so proud.\u2019 \u201d She lowered the paper. \u201cWho were you speaking of? Who would be proud?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cYou need to release me from these bindings so I can see you home. You\u2019re overtired. You\u2019re imagining things.\u201d</p><p>She waved the paper at him. \u201cI\u2019m not imagining this!\u201d</p><p>At her loud protest, the pup came awake.</p><p>\u201cThere was something about how you\u2019d worried I might place you, remember you,\u201d she went on. \u201cYou also mentioned that you could see down my bodice, and you told me I smelled like paradise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiss Taylor\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo now we\u2019re back to \u2018Miss Taylor.\u2019 What happened to \u2018Katie\u2019?\u201d She peered at him. \u201cThat\u2019s another odd thing, you know. My name is Katherine. My friends call me Kate. No one calls me Katie. At least, no one has since I was a very small child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRelease me.\u201d He mustered his voice of command. \u201cI\u2019ll see you home. It\u2019s not proper for you to be here with me. Most certainly not alone, at this hour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere until you give me some answers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019ll be here a very long time.\u201d</p><p>She could keep him here a month, and his resolve wouldn\u2019t crumble. He\u2019d endured much harsher prisons, with much less comely captors. He could hold out for years.</p><p>\u201cHow does your arm feel?\u201d she asked, changing the subject.</p><p>\u201cHow does it feel? It feels like wood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did some more reading while you were asleep. You can expect it to be numb for a few days, at least.\u201d Her skirts rustled as she swept to the other side of the bed. She produced a vial of oil and pulled out the stopper. Tilting the bottle, she poured a shilling-sized pool of liquid into her palm. \u201cThis will help with the stiffness, the book said. It\u2019s only plain oil from your cooking stores. I\u2019ll fetch something aromatic from Summerfield later.\u201d</p><p>She set aside the vial and rubbed her hands together, spreading the oil over both palms. Then she laid her hands to his bare skin and began to massage his deadened flesh. Her deft fingers kneaded him, chasing away the stiffness in his forearm.</p><p>Unfortunately, the stiffness wasn\u2019t leaving his body altogether. No, it was merely relocating\u2014to his groin. Beneath the bedsheet a familiar heaviness gathered and swelled.</p><p>He groaned. \u201cStop that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it too painful?\u201d</p><p>No. It feels too good.</p><p>\u201cWill it help if I sing to you?\u201d she asked coyly. \u201cThe way you begged me to sing to you last night?\u201d She hummed a lilting melody, then sang the words that he already knew. \u201c \u2018See the garden of blossoms so fair . . .\u2019 \u201d</p><p>He sighed and closed his eyes. God, he hated that song.</p><p>\u201c \u2018Roses in bloom,\u2019 \u201d she sweetly sang on, \u201c \u2018orchids so rare.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201cStop,\u201d he growled at her. \u201cEnough.\u201d</p><p>Her massaging hands swept down the length of his arm, all the way to the bandage at his wrist. She turned his arm palm side up and simply laid her fingers across his hand.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been staring at you all night. Searching what few memories I have from my earliest years. The more I look at you, the more I feel like there\u2019s a puzzle I should be solving. But the pieces just won\u2019t come together in my mind. And if you won\u2019t volunteer any information . . .\u201d</p><p>He sucked in his breath.</p><p>\u201c . . . then I have no choice but to bring out my most ruthless means of extorting it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re threatening me with ruthlessness,\u201d he scoffed.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think I have it in me?\u201d</p><p>She caught the hemmed edge of the bedsheet and whisked it all the way down to his waist. His bare chest was exposed to the firelight. Every mark, every tattoo, every ridge of scar tissue. He burned with the sensation of exposure. She didn\u2019t appear shocked, however. Only curious, in a markedly sensual way. No doubt she\u2019d had a good view of him earlier. He hated that tending his physical infirmity had robbed her of yet more innocence.</p><p>But the way she unconsciously wet her lips as she regarded him . . .</p><p>He didn\u2019t have it in him to hate that.</p><p>She uncorked the vial again and held it over his chest, tilting it by slow degrees until a trickle of oil poured forth. She drizzled the slick liquid in a lazy line down the center of his chest. Bisecting his chest and abdominal muscles, skipping over the linen binding him to the bed, tracing the furrow of dark hair that arrowed straight for his groin.</p><p>Holy God. The image was perversely sensual. Just what mischief did she intend? If she dragged her soft hands down his bared, oiled chest, he would not have to worry about forced confessions. He\u2019d combust on the spot, leaving behind nothing more blameworthy than ash.</p><p>\u201cI have a way of getting you to talk.\u201d Her mouth quirked in a cold smile. \u201cPrepare yourself for my secret weapon.\u201d</p><p>Thorne steeled his loins.</p><p>\u201cHere he is.\u201d</p><p>Christ.</p><p>She caught the pup in both hands, lifting him to a position directly above Thorne\u2019s glistening abdomen. That twitching dog nose hovered just an inch above his oil-filled navel.</p><p>Thorne\u2019s abdominal muscles flinched. So this was her grand, malevolent plan. She was going to tickle the truth from him. With the dog.</p><p>\u201cLittle Badger has been here all night with us. With nothing to eat save an old rind of cheese he sniffed out in your cupboard.\u201d She screwed up her face and spoke to the dog. \u201cYou\u2019re very, very hungry, aren\u2019t you, dear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t,\u201d said Thorne.</p><p>\u201cOh, just watch me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKatie, don\u2019t you dare.\u201d</p><p>Her eyebrows soared. \u201cAh. Now we\u2019re back to Katie? My tactic is working already.\u201d</p><p>He firmed his jaw and glared at her. \u201cIf you had any idea the torments I\u2019ve endured in my life, you would know\u2014I will not be done in by a puppy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just try it and see.\u201d</p><p>Thorne inwardly cursed. He could not be done in by a puppy, but this woman . . . she was a true danger.</p><p>She made eye contact with him, direct and honest. \u201cMy whole life, I\u2019ve searched for answers about my past. My whole life, Thorne. I will not rest until you tell me the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>She lowered the pup another half inch.</p><p>A quiver pulsed through Thorne\u2019s belly.</p><p>\u201cBadger, no,\u201d he commanded, even though he knew the futility of warning a dog off such behavior.</p><p>The dog was a dog. He barked. He chewed. He chased.</p><p>God have mercy.</p><p>He licked.</p><p>Kate kept her first bout of torture brief. She lowered Badger for just a few seconds of enthusiastic tickling.</p><p>Thorne growled like an animal. An enraged animal. His nostrils flared. The muscles of his abdomen tensed in staggered rows, hard as cobblestones beneath his skin. Tendons stood out on his neck, and his good arm was solid flexed muscle, embossed with thickly pulsing veins.</p><p>Heavens.</p><p>Kate\u2019s own breathing quickened. He was massive and strong and furious and utterly at her mercy. A beast, but a beautiful one.</p><p>Near giddy with power, she momentarily restrained the pup. \u201cHad enough?\u201d</p><p>His breathing was heavy, his voice a hoarse rasp. \u201cStop this. Stop this now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeg me for mercy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe devil I will.\u201d</p><p>She lowered the pup again. This time he strained and arched beneath the ropes so hard, he had the bed frame rocking to and fro. The entire bed scooted several inches across the floor. Beads of sweat dotted his forehead.</p><p>She gave him another brief reprieve. \u201cHow about now?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDevious woman. You\u2019re going to regret this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt that.\u201d She lowered the dog once again, letting him lick Thorne\u2019s side now, just beneath his lowest rib. He seized and gasped.</p><p>\u201cVery well,\u201d he finally growled. \u201cVery well. You win. Just get him off me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ll tell me everything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Victory surged in Kate\u2019s breast. \u201cI knew you\u2019d surrender.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not asking mercy for me,\u201d he panted, staring up at the ceiling. \u201cJust for the dog. With all that oil, you\u2019ll make him sick.\u201d</p><p>She smiled to herself, knowing she\u2019d found his Achilles\u2019 heel. \u201cI knew you cared about him.\u201d</p> <p>She brought Badger close to her chest and praised him extravagantly before setting him on the floor. Then she gave Thorne her full attention. Oh, the look on his face was murderous.</p><p>She said, \u201cI\u2019m listening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRelease me from these bindings first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you\u2019re fuming at me so darkly? I may be brave, but I\u2019m not stupid.\u201d She reached for the tea. \u201cBut I will offer you some of this.\u201d</p><p>She moved close to the head of the bed and raised the mug to his lips, putting one hand behind his head to help him drink. As he lowered his head to the pillow, she swept her fingers through his bed-mussed hair, taming it. \u201cGo on.\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cYes, I knew you as a child. You were just a little thing when we saw each other last. Four years old, perhaps. I was older. Ten or eleven. Our mothers\u2014\u201d</p> <p>At the word \u201cmothers,\u201d a lump rose in her throat.</p><p>\u201cOur mothers?\u201d She clasped his good hand. \u201cYou must tell me everything. Everything, Thorne.\u201d</p><p>He sighed reluctantly. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you more. I swear it. But release me first. The tale warrants a bit of dignity.\u201d</p><p>She considered. \u201cAll right.\u201d</p><p>From the table, she retrieved the knife. With careful sawing motions, she cut loose each of the bands of linen holding him to the bed. Some of the bindings she\u2019d wrapped over his breeches-clad legs. Others cinched against the bare skin of his chest and abdomen. To lift and cut them, she had to run her hands along his warm, oiled skin. She tried to maintain a businesslike demeanor, but it was difficult.</p><p>When she had the last binding cut, he propped his good elbow under him and slowly curled to a sitting position. A sleeping giant coming awake.</p><p>His boots hit the floor with twin thuds. She\u2019d never bothered to try removing them.</p><p>He rubbed his squared, unshaven jaw, then pushed a hand through his hair. His gaze dropped to his bare, oil-coated chest. \u201cHave you a sponge or damp cloth?\u201d</p> <p>She handed him a moistened towel from the bedside table.</p><p>He accepted it with his left hand and dragged the square of fabric over his throat and then around to his nape. As he tilted his head to either side, Kate stared at his sculpted shoulders, transfixed by the limber stretch of his tendons and the defined contours between each muscle. There was nothing soft on him, anywhere.</p><p>And then there were those intriguing tattoos.</p><p>When he dropped his hand and began to swab his chest, Kate\u2019s mouth went dry. She looked away, suddenly conscious that she\u2019d been staring.</p><p>A shirt. She really ought to find him a shirt. A narrow cupboard near the turret\u2019s entry seemed to serve as his closet. It was where she\u2019d hung his red officer\u2019s coat last night, once the danger had passed. She went to it now and found him a freshly laundered shirt of soft linen.</p><p>He discarded the damp towel, and she averted her eyes as she handed him the shirt. After a few moments she looked back. He\u2019d managed to get his head through the wide, open collar and his good arm into the left sleeve. But she could tell he was struggling with his wounded side.</p><p>She went to him. \u201cLet me help.\u201d</p><p>He flinched away. \u201cI\u2019ll manage.\u201d</p><p>Chastened, she let him be. \u201cWell. I\u2019m glad to see you survived the ordeal with your stubborn pride intact. I\u2019ll take Badger out for a few minutes.\u201d</p><p>The morning was chill and wet with dew, and she hurried Badger about his business, not wanting to risk an encounter with another snake.</p><p>When she returned, she found Thorne seated at the table with an open flask. His hair was damp and combed. He\u2019d put on a coat.</p><p>\u201cWould\u2019ve shaved and donned a neckcloth, but . . .\u201d He nodded at his right arm, dangling limp and useless at his side.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be silly.\u201d She sat with him and propped an elbow on the table. \u201cThere\u2019s no need. I can\u2019t imagine how I look at the moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLovely.\u201d He spoke the word without equivocation. His intense gaze caught hers. \u201cYou are lovely, always.\u201d He reached out to catch a stray lock of her hair. \u201cHer hair curled like this, but it wasn\u2019t so dark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere was this?\u201d She swallowed the lump in her throat. \u201cWhere did we live?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSouthwark, as I\u2019ve told you. Near the prison. The neighborhood was rough and very dangerous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you called me Katie then.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cEveryone did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did I call you?\u201d</p><p>His chest rose and fell slowly. \u201cYou called me Samuel.\u201d</p><p>Samuel.</p><p>The name struck a chime inside her. Memories heeded the summons, crowding the periphery of her mind. If she tried to look straight at them, they vanished. But she could sense that they were there, waiting\u2014misty and dark.</p><p>\u201cOur mothers took rooms in the same house,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cBut you told me your mother turned whore.\u201d</p><p>His mouth set in a hard line. \u201cShe did.\u201d</p><p>Oh no. Kate\u2019s breath caught painfully. The implications were too horrible to contemplate. \u201cIs my . . . Could she still be living?\u201d</p><p>Solemnly, he shook his head. \u201cNo. She died. That\u2019s when you went to the school.\u201d</p><p>Kate blinked, staring unfocused at a groove on the tabletop. Rage built within her, swift and sudden. She wanted to scold, scream, cry, pound something with her fists. She had never known this sort of raw, helpless anger, and she didn\u2019t know just what it might cause her to do.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Katie. The truth isn\u2019t pleasant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not. It\u2019s not pleasant. But it\u2019s my truth.\u201d She pushed back from the table and punched to her feet. \u201cMy life. I can\u2019t believe you kept this from me.\u201d</p><p>He rubbed his face with one hand.</p><p>\u201cLet me be certain I understand this,\u201d she went on. \u201cWhen you arrived in Spindle Cove last summer, are you telling me that you recognized me at once?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy this.\u201d She touched her birthmark.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you immediately knew me as an acquaintance from your childhood. And in the present, you found me . . .\u201d She churned the air with her hand. \u201c \u2018Fetching enough\u2019 was how you once phrased it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore than fetching.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow much more?\u201d She stood and flung her arms wide, taunting him. \u201cPretty? Beautiful? Rapturously stunning beyond all words and comprehension?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe third,\u201d he shot back. \u201cSomething like that third. When you\u2019re not flapping like an outraged chicken, I sometimes think you\u2019re the most beautiful woman in the world.\u201d</p><p>She let her arms drop.</p><p>After an awkward pause, she said, \u201cI\u2019m not, you realize. I\u2019m not even the most beautiful woman in Spindle Cove.\u201d</p><p>He held up a hand. \u201cLet\u2019s just go back to desirable. I found you very desirable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. So you recognized me and found me desirable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYet rather than speak to me about any of this, you decided to intimidate and avoid me for an entire year. When you knew I thought myself to be an abandoned orphan. When you must have understood how desperate I was for any connection to my past. How could you do that to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it was best. Your dim memories are a blessing. We lived in a place most would wish to forget. I didn\u2019t want to inflict that unpleasantness on you now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was not your choice to make!\u201d She gestured angrily toward the unseen ocean beyond the castle walls. \u201cI can\u2019t believe this. You would have left for America, having never said a word. Leaving me to wonder forever.\u201d</p><p>As he looked on, she paced back and forth. Badger chased the flounce of her skirt from one end of the room to the other.</p><p>\u201cIf the Gramercys hadn\u2019t found that painting and come looking for\u2014\u201d A horrid thought struck her. \u201cOh, God. Were they looking for me? Did my mother look like the portrait? Did she wear a pendant of deep blue stone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t say. My memories of her aren\u2019t a great deal more reliable than yours. When I saw her, she was usually made up with rouge and kohl. Later on, pale with illness. Ellie Rose was\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cEllie Rose.\u201d Kate took a pouncing step in his direction. \u201cMy mother\u2019s name was Ellie Rose?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what she went by. I don\u2019t think it was her real name.\u201d</p><p>Ellie Rose. Could she have been the same woman as Elinor Marie, or was she some other unfortunate soul?</p><p>Oh, Lord.</p><p>Who was Kate? The daughter of a marquess? The child of a whore?</p><p>Both?</p><p>She crumpled to the floor, numb everywhere. Badger pounced in her lap, as though he\u2019d won whatever game they were playing. She ignored him. Not even puppy kisses could make this moment better.</p><p>Out of habit, her fingers went to the mark at her temple. A child of shame, Miss Paringham had called her. A child of shame who ought to live ashamed.</p><p>Be brave, my Katie.</p><p>At her loneliest, most despairing moments, that voice had given her hope. She couldn\u2019t abandon that hope now. Someone, somewhere had loved her. Even if that someone had been a fallen woman, and that somewhere had been a seedy brothel\u2014it didn\u2019t change the essence of love.</p><p>Thorne said, \u201cDo you see? This is why I tried to protect you from the truth. Leave the past forgotten, Katie. Look at your life now. All you\u2019ve accomplished, all the friendships you\u2019ve made. You\u2019ve found a family to accept you.\u201d</p><p>The Gramercys.</p><p>\u201cOh God,\u201d she breathed. \u201cI have to tell them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Thorne tapped the table with his good fist. \u201cYou can\u2019t tell them anything of this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I must! Can\u2019t you see? This could be the link. If Ellie Rose was Elinor . . . then they would know for certain I\u2019m Simon\u2019s daughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, and they\u2019d know for certain that you spent your first four years in a bawdy house. They\u2019d cast you out. They\u2019d want nothing to do with you then.\u201d</p><p>Kate shook her head. \u201cThe Gramercys would never do that. Family above everything. That\u2019s what they always say. They\u2019ve weathered many a scandal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s high-class scandal, and then there\u2019s this. It\u2019s not the same.\u201d</p><p>She knew he was right. It wasn\u2019t the same. If her mother had been an elite courtesan, then maybe the scandal wouldn\u2019t be too much. But coming from a low-class Southwark brothel?</p><p>Nevertheless . . .</p><p>\u201cI owe the Gramercys the truth. I can\u2019t let them accept me into their family if there\u2019s a chance it\u2019s all a mistake.\u201d</p><p>A new thought struck her. She caught and seized it.</p><p>She rose to her feet. \u201cMaybe you\u2019re mistaken, Thorne. Have you thought of that? So you knew a little girl with a birthmark once. But that was twenty years ago. You can\u2019t be sure it was me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the song, Katie?\u201d</p><p>She crossed her arms and lifted her chin. \u201cThe song is just a silly little song. What of it?\u201d</p><p>Never mind that in all her years at Margate, all her years of music instruction, she\u2019d never met another soul who knew it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>For a moment he looked as though he\u2019d argue the same point. But then he seemed to reconsider.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d he said, lifting his good shoulder in resignation. \u201cYou\u2019re right. I must be mistaken. I never knew you as a child. You were never the daughter of a whore. All the more reason why you shouldn\u2019t tell the Gramercys anything about this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I have to,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI must. They deserve to know. They\u2019ve been so kind to me, offered me so much faith. I have to tell them. Today.\u201d</p> <p>He struggled to his feet. \u201cThen I\u2019ll go with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She sniffed. \u201cI don\u2019t want you there. I don\u2019t want you anywhere near me.\u201d She jabbed a finger to her breastbone. \u201cI tried to see the best in you, despite all your surliness. I defended you in my heart, even in the face of your callous rejections, and yesterday . . . I was ready to marry you, you heartless man. I foolishly thought I was coming to love you.\u201d</p><p>Her voice broke. \u201cAnd you were lying to me. All along, from the very moment you walked into this village and saw me singing in that borrowed India shawl. You lied to me. You forced me into this joke of a betrothal. You made me a fool in front of all my friends, as well as the people I hoped to call family. All this, when you knew\u2014you knew how much it meant to me. I can\u2019t keep letting you hurt me, Thorne. You were right, that day in the churchyard. I need someone capable of sympathy and caring. I need a better man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKatie\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t call me that. Don\u2019t ever call me that again.\u201d</p> <p>He caught her by the arm. \u201cKatie, I can\u2019t let you walk away. Not like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2014\u201d</p><p>Her racing pulse stumbled. If he told her he loved her, right here and now, she wouldn\u2019t be able to leave. Even after all he\u2019d done, she wouldn\u2019t have it in her to walk away. He had to know that.</p><p>Go on, she silently urged. Just say three words and I\u2019m yours.</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019ve spent the night here,\u201d he said.</p> <p>She narrowed her eyes. Coward.</p><p>\u201cYou spent the night alone in my quarters,\u201d he said. \u201cIf anyone notices that, you\u2019ll be ruined. Completely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take my chances. I\u2019d rather be ruined than be with you.\u201d She wrested out of his grip and went to the door. \u201cOur engagement is over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, it is over,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll be married today.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Fifteen</p><p>Thorne had known all along that this would happen. He\u2019d warned her, again and again, that if she knew him, she\u2019d want to get as far away as possible.</p><p>He watched her now, inching toward the door, wearing an expression of pure disgust.</p><p>\u201cMarry you? Today?\u201d She shook her head. \u201cYou\u2019ve gone mad. Perhaps it was the adder venom.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d never claim to be a learned man, but I have my wits about me.\u201d He crossed the room slowly, learning his new balance with a leaden right arm. \u201cYou\u2019ve spent the night with me. Alone. In my personal quarters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you were ill. I couldn\u2019t leave you. I had no choice. And besides, nothing happened.\u201d A blush touched her cheeks. \u201cWell, almost nothing.\u201d</p><p>A shudder went through him as he recalled the sweet flicker of her shy, velvet tongue and the soft heat of her sex. And all those naive, starry-eyed promises\u2014offers to keep him and love him and give him a home, as if he were another stray pup she\u2019d adopted.</p><p>Evidently, those offers were rescinded now.</p><p>He said, \u201cYou know as well as I, it doesn\u2019t matter what did or didn\u2019t happen. It\u2019s what people will assume.\u201d He hadn\u2019t removed her from a whorehouse all those years ago just to make her look the slattern now. \u201cWe must marry. You\u2019ve no choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I have a choice. Watch me make it.\u201d She wrenched open the door and dashed through it. He watched her disappear in the direction of the village\u2014running with all the haste of a bat fleeing dawn.</p><p>With a wistful thought that he\u2019d have preferred to do this with some bread and ale in his stomach, Thorne set off in pursuit. Badger happily joined the parade, ears flattened against his head.</p><p>As she hurried down the path that led from the castle bluffs to the village, she threw him a look over her shoulder. \u201cStop following me. I\u2019m not marrying you, Thorne. You\u2019re going to America. I mean to stay here in England. With my family.\u201d</p><p>The path straightened onto a gentle downslope. Thorne forced his weary limbs into a sprint, gaining ground until he could stretch out his left hand and catch her by the arm.</p><p>Ignoring her cry of outrage, he wheeled her to face him. Her hair escaped its pins, tumbling about her shoulders in heavy waves. She stared at him, breathing hard.</p><p>He found himself equally starved for air. What was it she\u2019d said earlier?</p><p>Rapturously stunning beyond all words and comprehension.</p><p>Yes, that about summed it up.</p><p>He said, \u201cYou need to ask yourself one important question. If that family is truly your family and they\u2019re so very understanding . . . why did your mother never go to them? Before Simon died, why didn\u2019t he tell anyone about his child?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps there wasn\u2019t time. And like Aunt Marmoset explained, their parents never approved of their love. But Evan was only a boy then. Times are different now. These Gramercys are different. They will not abandon me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if they do? If you\u2019re turned out of the Queen\u2019s Ruby\u2014and after spending the night with me, you likely will be\u2014you\u2019ll have no living whatsoever. How will you support yourself?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cI do have friends. That may be a foreign concept to you, but there are people who will help me. Susanna and Lord Rycliff would take me in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m certain they would. But Rycliff\u2019s my superior officer. If I acquaint him with the circumstances, he\u2019ll agree we must wed.\u201d</p><p>She turned and stared out over the green-blue sea, looking desperate and forlorn. His chest ached.</p><p>\u201cKatie,\u201d he said, \u201cI am trying to do the honorable thing.\u201d</p><p>She swung a fierce glare on him. \u201cWell, you\u2019re a year too late!\u201d</p><p>He knew he deserved that. \u201cIt\u2019s unfair. I know it. You were too softhearted to leave me last night, and now you have to pay for it with your future. It\u2019s the way of things. Acts of kindness come with costs attached.\u201d</p><p>This was one lesson life had taught him well.</p><p>But he\u2019d do it all again. He\u2019d swallow an entire nest of live adders if it meant sparing her a moment\u2019s pain.</p><p>He tried to put something soothing in his voice, rather than the usual blend of sawmill grist and impersonal authority. \u201cCome. Let me take you home. You\u2019re tired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am tired. Tired of secrets, tired of lies. But most of all, I\u2019m weary of living with uncertainty, feeling pulled between two pasts, two futures. I\u2019m going to speak with Evan and tell him everything. Exactly what happened and didn\u2019t happen last night. I\u2019ll tell him all about Ellie Rose and the Southwark brothel. We\u2019re going to have this all out in the open, and then I\u2019ll hear what he has to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy should you trust Drewe to make the decisions? You\u2019ve only known him a few weeks. He hasn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said, I\u2019ll hear what he has to say,\u201d she replied. \u201cI will make my own decisions. I\u2019ve allowed you to decide far too much ever since the Gramercys arrived in my life. I\u2019m paying the price for it now, but I will not make the same mistake again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve only been\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLooking out for me? Oh, yes.\u201d She spread her arms and indicated her rumpled gown. \u201cAnd a fine job you\u2019ve done of it, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy intentions were decent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d She jabbed a finger in the center of his chest. \u201cYou betrayed me, Thorne. You lied to me. You can\u2019t fathom how to love me. I am not marrying you. Not today. Not ever.\u201d</p><p>He exhaled slowly.</p><p>Not ever.</p><p>Once a woman made her wishes that clear, a man would be a villain to keep pursuing her. She understood the risks. She did have friends, if she needed help. If she wanted him out of her life, Thorne would leave it. Today.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going home to the rooming house now.\u201d She backed away. \u201cDon\u2019t follow me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve arrangements to make in London,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll leave this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d She crossed her arms over her chest, turned and strode off down the pathway. The wind gusting in from the open sea whipped her hair and gown in all directions, but her own path never swerved.</p><p>Thorne watched her go\u2014until a high-pitched canine whimper drew his attention.</p><p>Badger stood waiting at his heel, tail thumping. The dog whined anxiously as he looked to Miss Taylor\u2019s retreating form, then back to Thorne.</p><p>\u201cGo on,\u201d Thorne said, releasing Badger to chase. \u201cWatch over her for me.\u201d</p><p>As Kate walked back to the village, she reached a forked pathway. The left-hand path continued into the village, and the right led out to the main road.</p><p>She turned right and stared into the distance. Perhaps she should just keep walking\u2014make her way to some other village and start over. She could look for music pupils again, or become a governess. She could board a ship and go anywhere in the world. Surely braving Australia would be easier than sitting down with Lord Drewe and explaining the events of last night.</p><p>No, no. She muzzled the irrational voice urging her to flee. Starting over in a strange place wasn\u2019t a prudent idea for a single, unprotected woman.</p><p>Ellie Rose, whoever the poor soul was, had probably fostered high hopes of taking her baby and doing just that. And look where she\u2019d ended.</p><p>Kate took the left-hand path, trudging toward the Queen\u2019s Ruby in the early light of dawn. She couldn\u2019t stomach any further evasion, deception, or half-truths. It was time to make a clean breast of it with everyone and hope for the best.</p><p>As she neared the center of the village, a hiss from an alleyway startled her.</p><p>\u201cKate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d</p><p>A figure darted out from the shadows, blanketing her with an immense, dark cloak. The heavy fabric suffocated Kate and she flailed instinctively. She felt attacked.</p><p>Oh, what an irony it would be if not twenty minutes after refusing Thorne\u2019s protection, she were kidnapped and held for ransom. He might finally laugh at that.</p><p>\u201cStop struggling,\u201d a voice told her. \u201cAlmost have it . . .\u201d</p><p>Kate\u2019s head finally emerged through the top of the cloak. She could breathe again. And see.</p><p>\u201cHarry?\u201d Stunned, she blinked at the beautiful, unconventional woman she\u2019d come to think of as a cousin.</p><p>Harry put her arm around Kate, steering her back onto the street.</p><p>\u201cOh, Miss Taylor!\u201d she proclaimed loudly. \u201cWhat a lovely walk we\u2019ve had this morning. So invigorating, marching all over the Downlands. The dog enjoyed it, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat on earth are you talking of?\u201d Kate whispered.</p><p>\u201cJust play along,\u201d Harry murmured back, draping the cloak about Kate\u2019s shoulders. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. Unless they see you\u2019re wearing yesterday\u2019s gown, no one will even suspect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one will suspect what?\u201d</p><p>Harry lifted her voice as they neared the Queen\u2019s Ruby entrance. \u201cReally, what a lovely ramble. The weather\u2019s glorious. If I were the sort to gather flowers, I should have plucked dozens.\u201d</p><p>As they entered the rooming house, Mrs. Nichols came to greet them. The older woman wore an expression of true concern.</p><p>\u201cOh, Miss Taylor. How good to see you this morning. Are you feeling better, dear?\u201d</p><p>Kate stammered. \u201cI\u2014I . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course she\u2019s feeling better.\u201d Harry plucked Badger into her arms. \u201cJust look at those roses on her cheeks. I\u2019ve always said, there\u2019s nothing that a good brisk walk through open country can\u2019t cure.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Before Kate could even begin to object, a smiling Harry nudged her toward the staircase.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll just go freshen up for breakfast, Mrs. Nichols. I do hope we\u2019ll be treated to some of your delicious currant bread this morning.\u201d</p><p>When they reached the top of the stairs, Harry steered them both to Kate\u2019s bedchamber. She followed Kate inside, set the puppy loose, and flopped dramatically against the closed door.</p> <p>\u201cThere now.\u201d She gave Kate a conspiratorial grin. \u201cThat was satisfying. And just as I told you, no one suspects a thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d Kate sank onto the edge of her narrow bed. Hers was a small bedchamber, tucked under a far corner of the eaves. The bigger rooms were reserved for the visiting ladies with larger wardrobes and more accommodating purses.</p><p>\u201cI lied for you, of course,\u201d Harry said. \u201cI used to do it for Calista all the time. It was obvious enough why neither you nor Thorne showed up at the tavern last night. So when someone remarked on your absence, I volunteered to go check. I told everyone you were wretchedly ill and resting in your room. I even went to the trouble of waking Mrs. Nichols for a headache powder.\u201d Her lips curved in a smug smile. \u201cI\u2019m very good at these things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvidently,\u201d Kate said. Her head was spinning.</p><p>\u201cI must say, it almost makes me jealous. When two women want to be alone, the sneaking around is far too easy.\u201d She came to sit near Kate on the bed. \u201cI do hope you enjoyed your night. But next time, be a dear and give me some advance warning?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, Harry.\u201d Kate let her head drop into her hands. She knew her cousin\u2019s interference was well-meant. But it was poorly timed. Just when she\u2019d vowed to make a clean breast of things. \u201cIt\u2019s not at all how you think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to make excuses to me, Kate. Of all people, I\u2019m not going to judge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. But I\u2019m being truthful. I swear, nothing like that happened. In fact\u2014\u201d She broke off, overwhelmed.</p><p>Harry clucked her tongue and patted Kate\u2019s shoulder. \u201cDid you and Corporal Thorne have a row? Tell me what the scoundrel did. Don\u2019t worry, you can abuse him to me thoroughly. When you two make things right again, I\u2019ll never let on. I say the most horrid things about Ames when I\u2019m vexed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think this will ever be made right.\u201d Kate raised her head. \u201cI ended the engagement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Harry moved closer and put her arm around Kate\u2019s shoulders. \u201cOh, no. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAre you? I didn\u2019t think any of you liked him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, no. But you liked him, so we were trying our best.\u201d</p><p>Kate smiled, even as tears welled in her eyes.</p><p>Harry handed her a handkerchief from her waistcoat pocket. In her typical style, the linen square was gentlemanly\u2014unadorned with lace or fancy monograms.</p><p>Kate\u2019s heart twisted as she traced the neatly hemmed border of the handkerchief. She hated to think their family bond might all be a lie, a misunderstanding.</p><p>Harry asked, \u201cYou didn\u2019t break off with Thorne for our sakes, did you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. No, it was something else altogether.\u201d Kate sniffed and dabbed at her cheeks. \u201cI must speak with Evan right away. This morning, if possible. I need to explain to him about last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no.\u201d Harry\u2019s eyes flew wide. \u201cKate, you can\u2019t. You can\u2019t tell Evan anything about last night. He\u2019ll go into one of his . . . episodes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHis episodes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve seen the man seethe. But you haven\u2019t seen him explode. And nothing sets him off like knowing one of his female relations has been compromised. It wasn\u2019t only for your sake that I lied last night. I\u2019ve grown fond of this little village, and I should hate to see it laid waste.\u201d</p><p>Laid waste? Surely Harry had to be exaggerating.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d believe me if you\u2019d been there when Calista was discovered with Parker,\u201d Harry said. \u201cGood Lord, it was like something from a didactic medieval tapestry. One duel, two outbuildings burnt to the ground, at least a half-dozen valuable horses running wild on the moors. Took the grooms days to retrieve them all.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cIt made Evan\u2019s efforts on behalf of my honor look like a few friendly bouts at the club.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what about Claire?\u201d Kate couldn\u2019t help but ask.</p><p>\u201cThe less said about Claire, the better. Let\u2019s just say there\u2019s a gentleman somewhere who\u2019s missing parts. Vital parts.\u201d</p><p>Goodness. Kate tried to reconcile these accounts with the Evan Gramercy she knew and had come to admire. He seemed so collected and elegant. When they\u2019d played together that night, she had sensed the depth and intensity of emotion beneath the surface. But violence?</p><p>\u201cI must risk it anyway,\u201d she said. \u201cIn truth, my virtue has not been compromised. My conscience is clean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKate,\u201d Harry said sternly. \u201cI am not one for social convention. But even I know, if you spent the night with Thorne, you are compromised. It doesn\u2019t matter what happened or didn\u2019t happen.\u201d</p><p>That was exactly what Thorne had said. If two human beings as completely opposite as Thorne and Harry agreed on something, Kate could only conclude it must be true.</p><p>Harry squeezed her hand. \u201cI beg of you. Unburden your heart to me, if you wish\u2014or find a way to tell Evan part of the truth. But unless you wish true harm upon Corporal Thorne, do not let Evan know about last night. And for the love of everything, change your frock before you speak with him.\u201d</p><p>There was a knock at the door.</p><p>Kate sucked in a deep breath and hastily dabbed at her eyes. \u201cWho is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s me.\u201d The door opened a crack, revealing Lark\u2019s sweet countenance. When she laid eyes on Kate, she flung the door open wide. \u201cKate, what is it? Are you still ill?\u201d</p><p>Kate shook her head. \u201cNo. I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve just been telling her a very sad, tragic story,\u201d Harry said, rising to her feet. \u201cAnd she was deeply moved by the moral of the tale.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarriet. Don\u2019t provoke her so. At least not until she\u2019s stuck with us for good.\u201d Lark turned to Kate and smiled. \u201cEvan has visitors at the tavern. The solicitors, I think. He\u2019s asking to see you.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Sixteen</p><p>As many times as she\u2019d been in the public room below, Kate had never visited the rooms above the Bull and Blossom.</p><p>At Fosbury\u2019s direction, she made her way up a narrow staircase and emerged into a long, windowless corridor. She froze, struck again by that same familiar image.</p><p>She was in an endless, shadowy tunnel, and her future lay at the other end. Pianoforte music came up through the floor, tingling in the soles of her feet. She closed her eyes, and blue flashed behind her eyelids.</p><p>\u201cKate, is that you?\u201d Evan\u2019s voice carried out from the first room on the left.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She shook herself and smoothed a hand over the skirt of her fresh sprigged muslin before entering the room.</p><p>\u201cCome in, come in.\u201d Evan waved her forward. \u201cI trust you\u2019re feeling better this morning.\u201d</p><p>She stepped into a small yet comfortably furnished sitting room. She knew at once it had to be the Fosburys\u2019 private parlor. They must have vacated it to offer Evan a full suite of rooms, worthy of a marquess.</p><p>\u201cMiss Kate Taylor, I\u2019d like you to meet two of the family solicitors, Mr. Bartwhistle and Mr. Smythe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you do.\u201d Kate curtsied to the two men, who were dressed in brown coats so similar as to be nearly identical.</p><p>\u201cAnd this\u201d\u2014Evan turned her attention to an older woman in a faded indigo day dress several years past its peak of fashion\u2014\u201cis Mrs. Fellows.\u201d</p><p>Kate smiled and nodded, but was dismayed when Mrs. Fellows made no acknowledgment in return. Instead, the older woman remained seated in the tufted armchair, facing the window and staring straight ahead.</p><p>\u201cCataracts,\u201d Evan whispered in her ear. \u201cPoor old dear\u2019s nearly blind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Understanding the remoteness of her demeanor now, Kate moved forward to take the woman\u2019s hand. \u201cMrs. Fellows, it\u2019s a pleasure to make your acquaintance.\u201d</p><p>Evan closed the parlor door. \u201cMrs. Fellows was just telling us about her tenure as housekeeper at Ambervale, twenty years ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmbervale?\u201d Kate\u2019s heart skipped an alarming number of beats. Evan had told her in Wilmington that they meant to canvass for former Ambervale servants, but he\u2019d never mentioned it again.</p><p>He pulled up a chair for Kate, and she accepted it gratefully.</p><p>He took a seat as well. \u201cTell me, Mrs. Fellows. Did you keep a large house staff in my cousin\u2019s time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, my lord. Just me and my man. Mr. Fellows is gone now, some eight years. We had a cook in those days, and a girl came in daily for scullery. We sent the laundry out. Most of the house was closed up, you see. There were never any guests. His lordship and Miss Elinor liked their privacy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I would imagine.\u201d Evan smiled at Kate. \u201cAnd then Miss Haverford became pregnant, is that right?\u201d</p><p>The frankness of the question obviously pained Mrs. Fellows. But she answered. \u201cYes, my lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd she gave birth to a child. Was it a son or a daughter, do you recall?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA baby girl.\u201d Mrs. Fellows still faced the window, and she smiled at the dust motes whirling in the sunlight. \u201cThey named her Katherine.\u201d</p><p>From the other side of the room, Mr. Bartwhistle cleared his throat. His keen gaze fell on Kate\u2014or more particularly, on the birthmark at her temple. \u201cMrs. Fellows,\u201d he asked, \u201cdo you recall whether the infant had any . . . distinguishing marks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes. Unfortunate little dear had a birthmark. Right on her face.\u201d</p><p>Unfortunate little dear? For the first time in her life, Kate blessed that mark on her temple. If she could have stretched her lips like India rubber, she would have kissed it.</p><p>She leaned forward in her chair, training her ears so hard, she felt her eardrums bending under the strain.</p><p>\u201cIf you ask me,\u201d said Mrs. Fellows, \u201cit was the wine. If I told Miss Elinor once, I told her a hundred times\u2014a woman shouldn\u2019t be drinking aught of claret while she\u2019s breeding. It\u2019s unseemly. But she had a taste for a sip from time to time, and sure enough, when the babe came, there was a great splash of it on her temple.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you describe the mark in any further detail?\u201d Evan asked. \u201cI know it\u2019s been many years.\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Fellows shifted in her chair. \u201cBut I remember it, clear as day. It was just here.\u201d She lifted an age-spotted hand to her own temple. \u201cHad almost the shape of a heart. I\u2019ll never forget that, because they laughed about it, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey laughed about it?\u201d Kate asked, forgetting that she wasn\u2019t the one conducting the interview.</p><p>\u201cLaughed with each other, yes. They were like that, always laughing with each other about everything. I heard the lady tell his lordship, \u2018We know she\u2019s yours, don\u2019t we?\u2019 That was on account of his having a birthmark, too. But the late Lord Drewe insisted the mark was from Miss Elinor\u2019s side. Because she wore her heart on her face, and so the child must as well.\u201d</p><p>On the other side of the room, Bartwhistle and Smythe were furiously scribbling, taking down every word.</p><p>Evan reached for Kate\u2019s hand and squeezed it. \u201cI knew it. I knew you were ours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt sounds as though Simon and Elinor were very much in love,\u201d Kate said, choked with emotion.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes.\u201d The old housekeeper smiled. \u201cNever seen a couple so madly devoted to one another.\u201d Her smile faded. \u201cAnd after his lordship died, so sudden and so soon . . . oh, she took it so hard.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Evan asked.</p><p>\u201cWe never knew,\u201d Mrs. Fellows replied. \u201cThe doctor said mayhap the midwife brought in a contagion. I always suspected the painting, myself. Can\u2019t be healthy, staying shut up all day with those horrid vapors.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cHowever it happened, he was gone. We were all desolate, and Miss Elinor was beside herself. Alone in the world, with a newborn babe? And there was no money. None. His lordship had never kept much in the house, and we hadn\u2019t any way to keep purchasing goods on credit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you do?\u201d Kate asked.</p> <p>\u201cWe closed up the house. Miss Elinor took the babe and left. Said she\u2019d go back home to Derbyshire.\u201d</p><p>Evan leaned toward Kate and murmured, \u201cI suppose she never made it that far, or certainly someone would have heard. If only we could know what happened between the closing of Ambervale and your arrival at Margate.\u201d</p><p>A sense of desperate bewilderment settled on Kate. She was heartily sick of lies and deceit. She wanted to do\u2014and say\u2014the right thing. But she didn\u2019t know what the right thing was.</p><p>How could she explain to Evan about \u201cEllie Rose\u201d and the Southwark bawdy house\u2014in front of two solicitors and the housekeeper who\u2019d held her mother in such obvious regard? Did it even matter? Perhaps Thorne\u2019s story was irrelevant. The little girl he\u2019d known might have been someone else.</p><p>The most maddening thing of all was knowing that her own brain was holding the truth hostage. The memories were in there. She knew they were. But she could never quite reach the end of that corridor.</p> <p>\u201cI wish I could tell you,\u201d Kate said. \u201cI wish, more than anything, that I had some clear memory of that time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe good Lord must have taken her to heaven,\u201d Mrs. Fellows said. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine Miss Elinor would part with her child for anything less. I\u2019ve six of my own at home, and I\u2019d go to war with the devil for each of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you would, Mrs. Fellows,\u201d Evan said.</p><p>Impulsively, Kate reached forward and squeezed the aging housekeeper\u2019s wrist. \u201cThank you,\u201d she said. \u201cFor taking such care of her. And of me.\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Fellows fumbled for Kate\u2019s hand. \u201cIs it you, then? Are you Katherine? You\u2019re his lordship\u2019s daughter?\u201d</p><p>Kate looked to Evan, and then to the solicitors. \u201cI . . . I think so?\u201d</p> <p>Mrs. Bartwhistle and Mr. Smythe conferred. In the end, Mr. Bartwhistle answered for them both.</p><p>\u201cBetween the parish register,\u201d he said, \u201cthe striking physical resemblance, and the statement of Mrs. Fellows with regards to the birthmark\u2014we feel it safe to conclude in the affirmative.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d Kate asked.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d said Mr. Smythe.</p><p>Kate sank into the depths of her armchair, overwhelmed. The Gramercys had burst into her life less than a fortnight ago. Evan, Lark, Harry, Aunt Marmoset\u2014each of them had accepted her into the family, individually. But there was something about the dry, actuarial \u201cYes\u201d from the solicitors that made the brimming cup of emotion overflow. She buried her face in her hands, overcome.</p><p>She was a lost child, found. She was a Gramercy. She had been loved.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t wait to pay another call on Miss Paringham.</p><p>Mr. Bartwhistle went on, \u201cWe will draw up a statement for your signature, Mrs. Fellows. If you will be so kind as to offer a few more details. Were you present at the birth?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, yes,\u201d the housekeeper said. \u201cI was present at the birth. And at the wedding.\u201d</p><p>The wedding?</p><p>Kate\u2019s head whipped up. She sought Evan\u2019s face, but his expression was unreadable. \u201cDid she just say \u2018the wedding\u2019?\u201d</p><p>After Mrs. Fellows and the solicitors had gone, Kate sat with Evan in the small upstairs parlor. The musty parish register lay open before her on the table, flipped to a page just two leaves prior to her birth record.</p><p>\u201cSimon Langley Gramercy,\u201d she read aloud in a quiet voice, \u201cthe fifth Marquess of Drewe, married to Elinor Marie Haverford, the thirtieth day of January, 1791.\u201d</p><p>No matter how many times she read the lines, she still found them hard to believe.</p><p>Evan rubbed his jaw. \u201cCutting it a bit close, weren\u2019t they? Whatever scandal they began in, it seems Simon wanted to make things proper when it counted.\u201d</p><p>Kate looked up at her cousin. \u201cHave you known this all along?\u201d</p><p>He regarded her steadily. \u201cCan you forgive me? We always meant to tell you, of course, once we\u2019d\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe? So Lark and Harry and Aunt Marmoset . . . they all know, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe all saw it together, that day at St. Mary of the Martyrs.\u201d He reached for her hand. \u201cKate, please try to understand. We needed to be sure of your identity first, to avoid disappointing you, or . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr tempting me to stretch the truth.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know you at all. We had no idea what kind of person you might be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand,\u201d Kate said. \u201cCaution was necessary, and not only on your side.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why you pretended an engagement to Corporal Thorne?\u201d</p><p>She warmed with a guilty flush. How had he guessed? \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a pretense. Not exactly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it was a convenience. Invented on the spot, right there in the parlor of the Queen\u2019s Ruby. He wanted to protect you.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, unable to deny it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve long suspected as much. Don\u2019t feel badly, Kate. When I think of how we surprised you that night . . . It was the strangest, most unpredictable situation. For us all. Both of us held information back. But we were only guarding ourselves and our loved ones as best we could.\u201d</p><p>His words made her think of her argument with Thorne. She\u2019d been so furious with him for withholding what he knew\u2014or thought he knew\u2014about her past. Hadn\u2019t Evan committed the same exact transgression?</p><p>But she wasn\u2019t leaping from her chair and shouting at Evan. She wasn\u2019t heaping insults on Evan\u2019s character. Nor was she flouncing from the room in an airy huff of indignation, vowing to never see Evan again.</p><p>Why the distinction? she asked herself. Were the two men\u2019s actions so fundamentally different? Perhaps smoothly spoken Evan just explained his reasons more deftly than Thorne.</p><p>Or maybe it was merely this: Evan had concealed happy news, while Thorne\u2019s story represented a painful \u201ctruth\u201d she\u2019d prefer to reject. If so, she had dealt with him most unfairly.</p><p>But it was too late for regrets now.</p><p>With one long, elegant finger, Evan tapped the parish register. \u201cYou do realize what this means, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>She swallowed hard. \u201cIt means they married before my birth. It means I\u2019m legitimate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. You\u2019re the legitimate daughter of a marquess. Which means that you are a lady. Lady Katherine Adele Gramercy.\u201d</p><p>Lady Katherine Adele Gramercy. It was too much to be believed. The title felt like a too-large gown, borrowed from someone else.</p><p>\u201cYour life is about to change, Kate. You will move in the highest circles of Society. You must be presented at court. And then there is an inheritance. A significant inheritance.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, faintly horrified. \u201cBut I don\u2019t need all that. Being your illegitimate cousin already felt like a fairy tale come true. As for an inheritance . . . I don\u2019t want to take anything away from you.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cYou will not be taking anything. You will have what was rightfully yours all along. We\u2019ve merely had it on loan, these three-and-twenty years. I still keep the title, naturally. The marquessate cannot pass to a female child.\u201d</p><p>He patted her hand. \u201cThe solicitors will sort it all out. Of course, you\u2019ll have a great deal to discuss with Corporal Thorne.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she blurted out. \u201cI can\u2019t tell him. He\u2019s gone to London on business. And before he left, we . . . I broke the engagement.\u201d</p><p>Evan exhaled in a slow, controlled fashion. \u201cI am sorry, Kate\u2014gravely sorry\u2014for any hurt this has caused you. But for myself and for our family, I cannot pretend to be disappointed. I\u2019m glad it ended before today\u2019s interview, rather than after.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou needn\u2019t have worried,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s not mercenary. He wanted no part of marriage to me, even once he knew you were planning to claim me as a Gramercy. If he hears I\u2019m a true lady, it will only drive him further away.\u201d</p><p>Thorne\u2019s words echoed back to her:</p><p>If I hadn\u2019t spent the past year thinking of you as a lady, I promise you\u2014things would be different between us.</p><p>\u201cEvan, you must be relieved on all counts,\u201d she said. \u201cNow that the solicitors have accepted me, there\u2019ll be no need for you to . . . devise another way of giving me the family name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy marrying you, you mean?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. It was the first time either of them had admitted the idea aloud.</p><p>\u201cThe relief should be on your side, I think.\u201d A smile warmed his eyes. \u201cFor my part, I would not have viewed it as a hardship.\u201d</p><p>She cringed, hoping she hadn\u2019t caused any offense. Evan didn\u2019t seem to love her romantically, but then . . . After yesterday, what did she know of reading men\u2019s emotions?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to suggest that I . . . that we . . .\u201d</p><p>He took her bumbling apology and waved it smoothly away. \u201cKate, you will have so many options now. Every door will be open to you. Corporal Thorne may be a fine enough fellow. He troubled himself to protect you, and that speaks well of his character.\u201d</p><p>You\u2019ve no idea, she thought.</p><p>He\u2019d taken a melon for her. And a snakebite. He\u2019d given her his dog.</p><p>\u201cBut,\u201d Evan continued, \u201cyou can do better in your choice of a husband. You deserve better.\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cI\u2019m not so sure that\u2019s true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCorporal Thorne! Here you are, at last.\u201d</p><p>Thorne made a bow. \u201cMy lady.\u201d</p><p>Lady Rycliff herself welcomed him at the door of a new, lavish Mayfair town house.</p><p>\u201cYou know you can dispense with all that.\u201d Stray wisps of copper floated about her smiling face as she hurried him inside. \u201cIt\u2019s good to see you. Bram\u2019s been so looking forward to your visit. Now that the baby\u2019s arrived, he\u2019s outnumbered by females again.\u201d</p><p>The piercing wail of an infant drifted down from the upper floor.</p><p>Lady Rycliff bowed her head and pinched the bridge of her nose. When she lifted her face, her mouth twisted in a wry smile. \u201cEvidently, little Victoria is eager to meet you, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid I wake her?\u201d he asked, worried.</p><p>\u201cNo, no. She scarcely sleeps.\u201d Lady Rycliff showed him into a parlor. \u201cWill you mind waiting here for Bram? I\u2019m so sorry to abandon you when you\u2019ve just arrived. We\u2019re between nursemaids.\u201d</p><p>She disappeared, and Thorne stood awkwardly in the center of the room, surveying the evidence of genteel disorder. A few pillows lay scattered on the floor. The room smelled . . . odd.</p><p>He could scarcely believe that this was Lord and Lady Rycliff\u2019s home. Rycliff had been born and raised in the military. Order came as naturally to him as breathing. And as for his wife . . . she\u2019d been quite the managing sort, in Spindle Cove.</p><p>Shouldn\u2019t they at least have servants?</p><p>As if reading his mind, someone said from the doorway, \u201cGood God. This house is in upheaval. How is it that no one\u2019s offered you a drink?\u201d</p><p>Thorne turned to see that Rycliff had joined him.</p><p>He bowed. \u201cMy lord.\u201d</p><p>Rycliff brushed off the honorific. \u201cIt\u2019s just Bram in this house.\u201d</p><p>He offered Thorne a tumbler of brandy with one hand and a firm handshake with the other. \u201cIt\u2019s good to see you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Thorne accepted the brandy and made excuses for the handshake. His right arm was still numb from the elbow down, though he was slowly regaining sensation.</p><p>As he drank, he sized Bram up, noting the changes a few months\u2019 time and new fatherhood had made on the man. One thing was clear\u2014he ought to dismiss his valet. Only late afternoon, and Bram was dressed in a waistcoat and a rumpled, uncuffed shirt. To Thorne\u2019s eyes, he looked exhausted\u2014but he\u2019d venture to deem it a contented exhaustion, quite different from the grim fatigue of campaign.</p><p>Lady Rycliff reappeared, her arms full of wailing infant. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d she called over the din. \u201cShe\u2019s a very fretful baby, I\u2019m afraid. She cries with everyone. Our first nursemaid\u2019s already left us. No one under this roof is getting much sleep.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe sleeps for me,\u201d Rycliff said. \u201cGive her here.\u201d</p><p>His wife did so, with obvious relief. \u201cTwo months old, and she\u2019s already Papa\u2019s darling. I fear we\u2019re in for a time of it.\u201d She looked to Thorne. \u201cI do hope you weren\u2019t planning on a quiet, restful stay in Town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, my lady,\u201d Thorne said. \u201cJust business.\u201d</p><p>And when he wasn\u2019t occupied with business, he imagined he\u2019d be spending long hours engaged in self-castigation and regret. Distraction of any kind would be welcome\u2014even if it came in the form of a wailing infant.</p><p>\u201cGo on ahead,\u201d Bram told his wife. \u201cI have her. I know you\u2019ve dinner to oversee.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAre you certain you don\u2019t mind? I\u2019ll just check on the corporal\u2019s rooms upstairs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe always sleeps for me,\u201d Bram said. \u201cYou know that. Come along, Thorne. We can discuss our business in my library.\u201d</p><p>Squalling daughter in one arm and brandy in the other, Bram backed out of the parlor. Thorne followed him across the corridor to a richly paneled library.</p><p>Bram kicked the door shut behind them, placed his brandy on the desk blotter, and readjusted baby Victoria\u2019s weight in his arms. He paced the floor back and forth, jouncing the wailing baby as he went. His persistent limp from a war injury gave his steps an uneven rhythm.</p><p>When he caught Thorne\u2019s inquisitive look, he said, \u201cSometimes the walking helps.\u201d</p><p>Not every time, apparently.</p> <p>When the babe\u2019s crying still didn\u2019t abate, Bram swore quietly and pushed his rolled sleeve to mid forearm. He fixed Thorne with an authoritative look. \u201cI\u2019m still your commanding officer. You are never to tell Susanna I did this. That\u2019s an order.\u201d</p><p>He dipped the tip of his little finger in the brandy, then popped it into the babe\u2019s mouth. Little Victoria went quiet instantly, contentedly suckling.</p><p>\u201cGod help me,\u201d Bram muttered down at her. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be a handful when you\u2019re sixteen.\u201d</p><p>He released a heavy breath and looked to Thorne. \u201cSo. Are you certain you want this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant what?\u201d Thorne asked, wary.</p><p>\u201cAn honorable discharge from the army. Not the infant. Loud as she might be, I\u2019m not willing to part with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not.\u201d He cleared his throat. \u201cTo answer your question . . . Yes, my lord. I\u2019m certain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnough with the \u2018my lord,\u2019 Thorne. I\u2019m not asking you lord to servant, or even commander to soldier. I\u2019m asking you friend to friend.\u201d The baby released his finger, falling into a shallow sleep. He lowered his voice and resumed pacing the room, slowly this time. \u201cI want to make sure this is really your desire. You could make a good career for yourself in the army. I\u2019m well enough placed now, I could easily grant you a commission, if you wished.\u201d</p> <p>The words gave Thorne a moment\u2019s pause. What Rycliff offered was no small favor. If he accepted a commission, he could be assured higher standing in Society and a steady income for the rest of his life. Enough to support a family.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s very generous of you to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not generous at all. It\u2019s piss-poor compensation. You saved my life and my leg, and you served under me faithfully for years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was my duty and an honor. But I don\u2019t belong in England anymore, if I ever did. I need someplace bigger. Less civilized.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re going to America. To be a farmer?\u201d</p><p>Thorne shrugged. \u201cThought I\u2019d start with trapping. I hear there\u2019s good money in it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo doubt. And I can\u2019t deny it would suit your talents.\u201d Bram bounced his daughter. \u201cI\u2019ll never forget that time in the Pyrenees, when you used nothing but a bayonet to skin and gut that . . . What was it, again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA marmot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, marmot. A tough, greasy bastard. Can\u2019t say I\u2019ll be requesting marmot stew on the menu anytime soon, but it tasted fine when it was the first fresh meat in a fortnight.\u201d Rycliff nodded at his ledgers. \u201cCan\u2019t I lend you some funds? Let me do that much. We can call it a loan.\u201d</p><p>Thorne shook his head. \u201cI have money set aside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see you\u2019re determined to be stubborn and self-sufficient. I can respect that. But I insist you accept a gift, friend to friend.\u201d He tilted his head at a long, gleaming rifle from the mantel. \u201cTake that. It\u2019s Sir Lewis Finch\u2019s latest design.\u201d</p><p>When Thorne\u2019s eyebrows knitted in skepticism, Rycliff hastily added, \u201cProfessionally manufactured, of course. And thoroughly tested.\u201d</p><p>Thorne lifted the weapon with his good left hand, testing its balance. It was a fine rifle. He could see himself out tramping the woods with this gun in his hand. Of course, to make the picture complete, he\u2019d need Badger at his heel.</p><p>Damn it. He would miss that dog.</p><p>Thorne watched with curiosity as his friend gently rocked the sleeping baby in his arms. \u201cYou love her,\u201d he said. \u201cThe baby.\u201d</p><p>Bram looked at him like he\u2019d gone mad. \u201cOf course I do. Yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s my child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot every father loves his child. How do you know you love yours?\u201d</p><p>Thorne knew this strayed beyond the normal boundaries of their conversation, but if Bram wanted to do him a favor . . . this was a favor he could use.</p><p>Bram shrugged and looked down at his sleeping daughter. \u201cI suppose it\u2019s a fair enough question. I mean, as of yet she doesn\u2019t do much, does she? Except deprive me and her mother of sleep, food, peace of mind, and sexual congress.\u201d</p><p>Bram lowered his weight into the desk chair. Slowly, so as not to wake the babe. \u201cWhen she\u2019s freshly washed, she smells better than opium. There\u2019s that. And even though I know it\u2019s not statistically likely, no one could convince me she\u2019s not the most beautiful infant in Britain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo she\u2019s pretty. And she smells good. That\u2019s all you have?\u201d If that was all there was to love, Thorne thought, he would have been chest-deep in it for ages.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I say? She\u2019s not much of a conversationalist yet.\u201d Bram shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m no philosopher, Thorne. I just know how I feel. If you require a definition, read a book.\u201d</p><p>Sliding his daughter to his left arm, he reached for his brandy and drew a healthy swallow. \u201cDoes this line of questioning mean there\u2019s truth to the rumor? You\u2019ve taken up with Miss Taylor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTaken up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSusanna\u2019s had some very strange letters from Spindle Cove. There\u2019s some talk of an engagement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s only talk,\u201d Thorne said. \u201cNo truth to it.\u201d Not anymore.</p><p>\u201cIf there\u2019s no truth to it, then how would the rumor be started?\u201d</p><p>Thorne set his jaw. \u201cI\u2019m not certain what you mean.\u201d</p><p>Bram shrugged. \u201cMiss Taylor is Susanna\u2019s good friend. I just want to be certain she\u2019s been treated well.\u201d</p><p>A white flare of rage rose in Thorne\u2019s chest. He worked hard to conceal it. \u201cMy lord, when will this discharge go into effect?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve permission to speak freely now, if that\u2019s what you mean.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cThen I\u2019ll thank you to mind your own affairs. If you make any further insinuations that disparage Miss Taylor\u2019s virtue, we\u2019ll have more than words about it.\u201d</p><p>Bram stared at him, surprised. \u201cDid you just threaten me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe I did.\u201d</p><p>He broke into low laughter. \u201cGood God. And here Susanna and I were placing wagers on whether you even liked her. Now I see she has you utterly tied in knots.\u201d</p><p>Thorne shook his head. She did not have him tied in knots. She hadn\u2019t held him tied in knots for at least . . . fifteen hours.</p><p>Bram raised a brow. \u201cDon\u2019t take offense. Stronger men than you have been brought to their knees by Spindle Cove women.\u201d</p><p>Thorne harrumphed. \u201cWhat stronger men would those be?\u201d</p><p>A knock sounded at the study door.</p><p>\u201cHow do you do it?\u201d Lady Rycliff asked, marveling at the sleeping babe in Bram\u2019s arms. \u201cFor a gruff old soldier, you charm lambs and babies with remarkable ease. Corporal Thorne, what is his secret?\u201d</p><p>Bram gave him a stern look. Don\u2019t tell. It\u2019s an order.</p><p>Thorne wouldn\u2019t disobey an order. But neither could he let that \u201cstronger men\u201d remark go unanswered. \u201cIt must have been the . . . the lullabies, my lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLullabies?\u201d Lady Rycliff laughed and turned to her husband. \u201cI\u2019ve never heard him sing a note. Not even in church.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, well,\u201d Thorne said. \u201cHis lordship sang them very softly. And then he made little kissing faces. There might have been a story about fairies and ponies.\u201d</p><p>Bram rolled his eyes. \u201cThanks for nothing.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Seventeen</p><p>After the midsummer fair, activities in Spindle Cove returned to the usual routine. Still nursing an adder-bitten heart, Kate embraced the familiarity as some comfort.</p><p>The ladies of the rooming house followed a predictable schedule during the summer. On Mondays they had country walks. Tuesdays were sea bathing. On Wednesdays they turned their hands to gardening.</p><p>And Thursdays were their day to shoot.</p><p>On this particular Thursday\u2014a rather overcast, gloomy sort of morning\u2014Kate had invited the Gramercys to join the ladies\u2019 target practice at Summerfield, Sir Lewis Finch\u2019s estate.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to learn this,\u201d Aunt Marmoset said. \u201cIt\u2019s so exciting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWatch first, shoot later.\u201d Kate demonstrated the proper loading of a single-barrel pistol. \u201cYou must measure out the charge carefully with the powder horn,\u201d she said. \u201cThen the ball and a patch. Like this, see?\u201d</p><p>As she tamped down the bullet, Kate could sense Aunt Marmoset\u2019s impatience.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all very interesting, dear, but when do I make it go bang?\u201d</p><p>Kate smiled. \u201cLet\u2019s shoot together this first time, shall we?\u201d</p><p>She moved behind the older woman and helped her raise the pistol in both hands, bracing her arms straight as they aimed at the target.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll want to close one eye,\u201d she said. \u201cFor precision. Then cock the hammer like so. And once you have it aimed and steady, gently squeeze the\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d cried one of the other ladies, \u201chere comes Lord Drewe!\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvan\u2019s here? Where?\u201d Aunt Marmoset swung around, turning Kate with her. Together they pivoted with the loaded pistol braced in their outstretched hands\u2014like a compass needle veering toward north.</p><p>All the ladies gasped and ducked.</p><p>\u201cGet down!\u201d Kate cried, struggling to regain control.</p><p>\u201cEvan, look!\u201d the Aunt Marmoset called. \u201cI\u2019m learning to shoot!\u201d</p><p>Realizing he stood in the line of fire, Evan froze in place. \u201cBrilliant.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>With a flick of her thumb, Kate uncocked the hammer.</p><p>\u201cAunt Marmoset, please.\u201d She gripped the old woman\u2019s frail wrists and pulled downward, until the pistol was safely pointed at the ground. Despite her racing heartbeat, she made her voice calm. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we set this aside for now? Lord Drewe looks as though he has something to say.\u201d</p><p>Evan recovered himself. \u201cIndeed I do.\u201d He clapped his hands together and rubbed them briskly. \u201cI have exciting news for everyone.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Charlotte Highwood asked.</p><p>\u201cSir Lewis has agreed to loan me Summerfield\u2019s great hall for an evening next week. My sisters and I . . .\u201d He paused for effect. \u201c . . . will be hosting a ball.\u201d</p><p>All the ladies went dead quiet. Nervous glances were exchanged. Kate thought she heard someone mutter a prayer.</p><p>\u201cDid you . . .\u201d She cleared her throat. \u201cYou did say a ball, Lord Drewe? Here at Summerfield?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, a ball. It will be our way of thanking Spindle Cove for all the warm hospitality we\u2019ve been shown during our holiday. We\u2019ll invite the militia, all the rooming house residents. We\u2019ll have a grand time.\u201d</p> <p>The ladies\u2019 silence clearly wasn\u2019t the reaction Evan had been expecting. He looked around at the somber young women, nonplussed. \u201cI don\u2019t understand. Do you not like balls?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe do,\u201d Kate assured him. \u201cIt\u2019s just that Summerfield balls . . . well, the last two both ended in violence and mayhem. Last summer, the ball was over before it even started, due to a tragic explosion. And then at Christmas, a French smuggler crashed into the ballroom and held poor Miss Winterbottom hostage all night. So we\u2019ve developed a bit of a superstition, you see. About Summerfield balls. Some people say they\u2019re cursed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, this one will be different.\u201d Evan pulled up to his most lordly, commanding stature.</p><p>\u201cOf course it will be,\u201d Lark said, \u201cif the Gramercys are hosting it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes,\u201d Harry added. \u201cWe are known for always showing our guests an unforgettable time.\u201d</p><p>Kate might have argued that the first two Summerfield balls had been unforgettable in their own ways.</p> <p>Diana Highwood smiled, saving them all with her ever-affable nature. \u201cMama will be very pleased. And I can scarcely wait myself. A ball is a lovely idea. Lord Drewe, you and your sisters are very good to us.\u201d</p><p>Evan bowed. \u201cThank you, Miss Highwood. It is our pleasure.\u201d To Kate, he added, \u201cMiss Taylor, will you take a turn with me and my sisters in the garden? We\u2019d like to solicit your advice with regards to the music.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well,\u201d Kate said. She disarmed and disassembled the pistol and stored it safely away. To Diana, she whispered, \u201cPlease don\u2019t let their aunt anywhere near another weapon.\u201d</p><p>Diana laughed a little. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Before heading for the garden, Kate collected Badger from the Summerfield groundskeeper. While she supposed a top hunting dog should theoretically be inured to gunfire, she hadn\u2019t thought it wise to have him underfoot during target practice.</p><p>Once they\u2019d rounded a hedge and disappeared from the other ladies\u2019 view, Kate addressed the whole family. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry for that incident just now with the pistol. So very sorry. It was unforgivable of me to even put the weapon in her hand. I\u2019d no idea the old dear would prove so strong. Or enthusiastic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever mind that,\u201d said Evan. \u201cSir Lewis just finished showing me his medieval hall. Believe me, no humble pistol could chill my blood after viewing his collection of ancient torture devices. That\u2019s not what we called you aside to discuss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not?\u201d She arched a brow. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe ball,\u201d Lark whispered excitedly. \u201cWe need to talk about the ball. You do realize, it\u2019s for you. It\u2019s all for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe ball is for me?\u201d</p><p>Lark vibrated with excitement. \u201cYes, of course.\u201d</p><p>Harry cut in. \u201cWhat Evan said about showing our appreciation . . . that was true, too. But we want to bring you out, Kate. Give the debut you never had.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m twenty-three. That\u2019s much too old for a debut.\u201d</p><p>Evan said, \u201cA debut, a come-out . . . they\u2019re just words that mean \u2018introduction to Society.\u2019 That\u2019s precisely what\u2019s in order here. We need to tell all England about you, Kate. But it only seems right to begin here. In Spindle Cove. All your friends will be so happy for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suggest a dramatic announcement at midnight,\u201d Harry said. \u201cMake them all tingle with anticipation.\u201d</p><p>Kate tingled with some other feeling. She thought it might be dread.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t understand why this idea made her uneasy. Being announced as a long-lost lady, at a ball held in her honor\u2014it ought to sound like a dream. A moment of fairy-tale triumph for a girl who\u2019d grown up feeling outcast and alone. Her friends would be thrilled for her, to be sure. Except for perhaps Mrs. Highwood, who would likely go apoplectic with envy.</p><p>Still, she couldn\u2019t imagine the moment without feeling a flutter of anxiety. If she was going to stand before all her friends and neighbors and be announced as Lady Katherine Gramercy . . .</p><p>Kate wished she could be certain she believed it herself. Remembered it, in some undeniable fashion. Any small detail would do. With each passing day, she felt more certain that the memories were there, closer to the surface than ever before. She just needed to find the courage to unlock them.</p><p>As they turned into another section of the garden, Badger lunged at a wandering peafowl, scampering across a bed of herbs. Kate broke away from the group. She leaned down to touch a teacup-sized pink rose blossom, sliding her finger along the velvety petal. The delicate texture held her transfixed, and a melody rose in her, instinctive as breath.</p><p>See the garden of blossoms so fair . . .</p><p>There was something in that song. Something important. She wouldn\u2019t have remembered it all her life otherwise.</p><p>She ground her slipper heel into the manicured white gravel. \u201cWill you excuse me? Please go ahead back to the village. I\u2014I\u2019ve forgotten something. And Badger needs to have his run for the day.\u201d</p><p>Without even waiting for an answer, she turned and began walking in the other direction. The puppy followed at her heel.</p><p>She had no particular destination. But she had forgotten something.</p><p>She would walk and walk, and keep walking until she recalled it. Until she finally reached the end of that long dark corridor.</p><p>And when she arrived there\u2014this time, she would open that door.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be long, Kate!\u201d Lark called after her. \u201cThe sky looks like rain.\u201d</p><p>Thorne could not have picked a worse day for overland travel. He hadn\u2019t made it very far south before the sky darkened with ominous clouds. A few hours later he met with the rain.</p><p>It hadn\u2019t let up since.</p><p>These damned Sussex roads took no more than a sprinkle of rain to go from \u201cpassable packed dirt\u201d to \u201cmuddy pig wallow.\u201d His progress was slow, and wet. This all would have been easier if he could have skipped returning to Spindle Cove at all and proceeded straight to America after gaining his discharge papers. But he needed to collect his personal belongings and arrange for transfer of the militia command.</p><p>And he needed to see Katie. Just one more time, even if from a distance. Conversation wouldn\u2019t be necessary. He just wanted to lay eyes on her and assure himself she was happy and safe and loved.</p><p>She deserved to be loved, by people who\u2019d read enough books to understand what the hell \u201clove\u201d meant.</p><p>At last he turned off the main road and took the spur toward Spindle Cove. At that point the moors and meadows were more passable than the rutted roads, so he turned his horse off the lane and continued overland.</p><p>Through a cloud of swirling fog, the ancient specter of Rycliff Castle appeared on the distant bluffs, seeming to shift and change with every gust of wind. Beyond that the sea was obscured by a wall of gray mist. All the usual sounds of country life\u2014sheep bleating, birds singing\u2014were muted by the steady rain. The entire scene was unearthly. Beneath the many sodden layers of his coat, waistcoat, cravat, and shirt, his skin crawled.</p><p>Watch sharp.</p><p>At the meadow\u2019s lowest point\u2014just before the rocky bluffs began to rise on the other side\u2014Thorne slowed his horse to a walk. He scouted carefully for the appropriate crossing place. Centuries ago there\u2019d been a deep moat carved here. An extra layer of protection for the castle above.</p><p>Over hundreds of years the moat had mostly filled in\u2014but there were still pockets here and there where the meadow dropped out from beneath a man\u2019s feet, and boulders waited to catch him a few yards below.</p><p>A strange sound came to him, piercing through the thick felt blanket of rain noise. He recognized it at once.</p><p>\u201cBadger?\u201d</p><p>Thorne left his horse. The gelding was on familiar ground now; he\u2019d spent a year grazing these meadows every day.</p><p>Whistling in this downpour would be futile. He cupped his hands around his mouth and shouted for the dog. \u201cBadger! Here, boy.\u201d</p><p>The pup\u2019s barking came from one of the deep hollows in the meadow. What was he doing down there?</p><p>\u201cThis had better not be another snake,\u201d Thorne muttered, advancing to investigate.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t a snake. It was a woman.</p><p>His Katie, tucked beneath a bit of overhanging turf, soaked to her skin and shivering in a muddy hole in the ground.</p><p>\u201cJesus Christ.\u201d</p><p>He stepped down into the pit, bracing his boot on a ledge of stone and stretching his free hand toward her. \u201cKatie, it\u2019s me. Take my hand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re here.\u201d Her face was so pale, and her voice was frayed. \u201cI knew you\u2019d find me. You always find me.\u201d</p><p>Her arm looked positively ghostly as she reached up to him. He worried he\u2019d make a grab for her hand and discover she\u2019d dissolved to mist. Lost to him forever.</p><p>But no. When he tightened his fingers, they seized on real flesh and blood. Treacherously chilled flesh and blood, but he would take her any way he could have her, so long as she was alive.</p><p>With a few tugs and a bit of cooperation on her end, he had her out of the hole. She fell against him, and he caught her in his arms.</p><p>\u201cKatie.\u201d He stared down at her, horrified. Her thin muslin frock was soaked through, clinging to her skin in mud-streaked tatters. \u201cAre you injured? Are you broken anywhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Just c-cold.\u201d</p><p>He released her\u2014steadying her on her feet so he could strip out of his coat. The damn sleeves were fitted too well, and the fabric was damp. He had to struggle, and every moment he wasted was a moment she shivered with cold. By the time he finally had the thing off, he\u2019d rattled through every blasphemy in his vocabulary.</p><p>\u201cWhat the devil are you doing out in this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI . . . I didn\u2019t mean to be. I took Badger out for a run, and we were caught in the rain. I didn\u2019t realize how much he\u2019d hate it. I thought dogs loved the rain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot sight hounds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cS-So I\u2019ve learned. At the first sprinkle of rain, he darted down into the hole. I couldn\u2019t make him leave, and I wouldn\u2019t leave him. I decided we\u2019d just take shelter and wait the downpour out. But then it went on and on. By the time it eased a little, I was so very c-cold.\u201d</p><p>He threw his coat around her shoulders and drew it closed. For a summer rain, this one was cold, and God only knew how long she\u2019d been out in it. Her lips were a distressing shade of blue, and now she wasn\u2019t making a damn bit of sense.</p><p>\u201cI had to go walking, you see. I had to keep walking until I found the answer. Even if it t-t-took all day and all night. I had to know. But now I do.\u201d Her teeth chattered and she stared blankly into the distance. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI need to get you inside. We have to get you warm.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes met his, suddenly lucid and piercing. \u201cI remembered, Samuel.\u201d</p><p>God. When she said his name, his heart made a mad, frantic attempt to escape his chest.</p> <p>She collapsed against his body, curling her fingers into the fabric of his shirt. Her breath was a puff of warmth against his skin.</p><p>\u201cI remembered you,\u201d she whispered. \u201cYou, the music, the song. That night. I remembered everything.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Eighteen</p><p>I remembered everything.</p><p>Thorne refused to think about the implications of her words. He needed to get her to dry shelter as soon as possible. Everything else could wait.</p> <p>The castle was barely a quarter mile off. He could have put her up on his horse, but the beast was exhausted from slogging through mud all afternoon. Thorne would have needed to walk alongside, which meant there\u2019d be no speed advantage over simply carrying her himself.</p><p>So that was what he decided to do. At least she\u2019d be able to borrow his heat.</p><p>Thorne wrapped one arm around the small of her back and slid the other beneath her thighs. With a flex of his muscles and a grunt of effort, he plucked her off her feet and settled her weight against his chest. She was a good bit heavier than when he\u2019d done this last. But then, he was bigger and stronger, too.</p><p>He ducked his head, using his sleeve to wipe the raindrops from his face, and started walking. His boots squelched through the muddy flat, slowing his progress. When he finally reached the bluffs, he had firmer rock beneath his feet.</p><p>Of course, he also had to trudge uphill.</p><p>He paused to rebalance her weight. \u201cCan you put your arms around me?\u201d</p> <p>She obeyed, sliding her chilled arms free and reaching to lace them around his neck. It helped. If nothing else, the secret thrill of her touch against his skin made his heart beat faster, powering a new surge of strength to his limbs.</p><p>He made the final climb in determined strides, carrying her straight to the heart of the castle\u2014the keep, where his personal quarters were.</p><p>Once he had her inside, he lit a lamp and assessed her state more carefully. Her damp, chilled condition appalled him, but it also gave him something to do. He made a mental list. First, dry clothing and blankets. Second, a fire. Third, nourishment. Then he\u2019d see about restoring her gown to rights.</p><p>Badger shook himself, spraying muddy droplets everywhere. Thorne threw him an old quilt, and the dog nosed and rolled in it.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019ll have to do for you,\u201d he said to the dog. \u201cShe comes first.\u201d</p><p>He rolled up his sleeves and went to work. There was nothing sensual in the way he helped her out of the sodden, mud-spattered frock. He moved briskly, willing himself not to notice anything of her bare body save the pale, bluish tinge of her skin and the way her muscles quivered. To take any pleasure from this would be disgusting and base.</p><p>As she sat on the hearth rug and hugged her knees to her chest, he toweled dry her hair and helped her into one of his own clean, dry shirts. For modesty\u2019s sake, he draped it over her head and shoulders before reaching beneath to unbutton and remove her chemise. He tried his best to keep his cold, coarse fingers from scraping against her bare flesh. He averted his eyes from the flash of her red, turgid nipple as he switched one garment for the other. As he pulled the folds of crisp, soap-scented lawn down her midriff, he tried to ignore the way lamplight cast her slight, nubile form in silhouette.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t, not entirely. What a beast he was.</p> <p>He would rather let her tend to such things herself, but she seemed incapable at the moment.</p><p>Once he laid a fire, she stared dully into it, mute and shivering. He wondered if it was the shock of remembering the Hothouse, and the squalid conditions there. Perhaps her mother\u2019s loss had suddenly become real to her, and she was suffering the pangs of grief.</p><p>In any event, he didn\u2019t want to rush her or press her to talk. He just relished the chance to take care of her, here and now\u2014where this was his right, his responsibility, and no one else\u2019s. He was happy for her to stare into the fire. When she came back to herself, those hazel eyes would no doubt turn on him and fill with loathing. It might be the last time she looked at him, ever again.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d he said, crouching beside her and offering her a steaming mug of tea, well-doctored with sugar and brandy. \u201cDrink this. It will help you get warm.\u201d</p><p>He put it in her hands, wrapping her fingers around it. She held it, but only stared blankly at the contents.</p><p>\u201cI c-can\u2019t seem to stop shivering.\u201d</p><p>He reached for another blanket.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Her head turned, and her eyes focused on his face. \u201cI want you, Samuel. I want you to hold me. Pl-Please.\u201d</p><p>Those words\u2014just the words alone\u2014found some aching chasm in his soul and filled it. But damn it, he was trying to be honorable. If he took her in his arms, he wasn\u2019t sure he could keep his thoughts protective.</p><p>\u201cI should tend to your frock,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s almost dry, but it needs\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe frock can wait.\u201d With trembling hands, she set the mug of tea on the floor. \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d Another chill racked her body. \u201cI need you.\u201d</p><p>Reluctantly, he sat beside her on the small, threadbare rug. He stretched one of his legs behind her, propping her up with his bent knee. His other leg sprawled toward the fire. And then he put both arms around her, and she sank into his embrace, nestling close to his chest. Her cool cheek rested against his pounding heart.</p><p>\u201cTight,\u201d she whispered. \u201cHold me tight.\u201d</p><p>He obeyed, flexing the muscles in his arms.</p><p>Her discomfort was his enemy. Any chills that dared rack her frame would have to rattle him, too. He had heat and strength enough for them both.</p><p>He bent his head, burying his face in her curling hair and letting his breath warm her ear and the back of her neck.</p><p>Her fingers gathered a fistful of his shirt and clung tight. They remained like that several minutes. He kept a close watch on her bottom lip. When it pinked and ceased quivering, a stupid surge of triumph rushed to his head. He had the brief, idiot notion he\u2019d done something good for her.</p><p>Then he remembered who she was, and who he was, and precisely why they were here. And he reminded himself that this would be the end.</p><p>He pressed his face into the curve of her neck and inhaled deeply of her lemony clover scent. He\u2019d hold her while he could.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she whispered. \u201cThat\u2019s better.\u201d</p><p>When he lifted his head, she relaxed her grip on his shirt.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve remembered it for you,\u201d she murmured. \u201cThe amusing story from your childhood. It\u2019s like I told you, everyone has one. You see, there was this girl who shared your attic. A pestering little thing who tugged at your sleeves when you would have rather been running loose with the neighborhood boys. But late at night, sometimes, when she couldn\u2019t sleep, you took it on yourself to make her laugh and laugh\u2014with games and shadow puppets and sweets nicked from the kitchens downstairs. One night, you bundled her up in every cloak and cape and muffler she had, and told her it was time to play gypsies. We were going to have a grand adventure, you said.\u201d</p><p>She looked up at him, eyes wide in the dim firelight. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me everything? You told me the truth of my mother, but you neglected to tell me the truth about you.\u201d She touched his cheek. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me that you saved my life?\u201d</p><p>He swallowed hard. \u201cI didn\u2019t save your life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you did. Or something close to it. I told you, I finally remembered.\u201d</p><p>She gazed into the fire, contemplative. \u201cAll my life, I\u2019ve kept this shadowy recollection in my thoughts. I\u2019m in a long, dark hallway, and I can feel pianoforte music coming up through the floor. I hear the song, that same little verse about the garden. There\u2019s something blue flashing in the darkness, and someone says, \u2018Be brave, my Katie.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>A knot stuck in his throat. He couldn\u2019t speak.</p><p>\u201cIt was you, wasn\u2019t it? We were up in the attic, and we were escaping that place.\u201d</p><p>He forced out a reply. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou took my hand and opened the door. We hurried down the stairs, and we never went back. You delivered me to Margate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was what your mother wanted. Before she died, she made her wishes clear. You were clever, and everyone could see it. She\u2019d read about Margate in some subscription magazine and knew they took in foundlings. She wanted you sent to that school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I wasn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cAfter Ellie Rose died\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t I remember her?\u201d she interrupted, distressed. \u201cI remember you now, in little bits and pieces. But no matter how I search my brain, I still have nothing of her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps you\u2019ll recall more, in time. It\u2019s not your fault. We had to stay out of our mothers\u2019 way, for the most part. Else we would have been branded as troublesome, and landed ourselves on the streets. Anyhow, after your mother died, weeks passed. Then months. I knew they never meant to send you to that school. They never meant to let you go at all. They would have kept you there, made you one of them far too soon. For God\u2019s sake, they were already teaching you the song.\u201d His stomach turned, just thinking of it.</p><p>\u201cThey taught me the song?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe place . . .\u201d He blew out his breath. He hated telling her these sordid details, but they\u2019d come this far. She needed to know everything. \u201cIt was an opera house, mainly, with music and dancing girls cavorting on stage. But all manner of other things went on abovestairs. They named it the Hothouse, and all the dancers were called \u2018blossoms.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201cLike Ellie Rose,\u201d she said, understanding. \u201cInstead of Elinor Haverford.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLily Belle. Pansy Shaw. Molly Thorne.\u201d He winced. \u201cThat verse you remember . . . it\u2019s what they sang for the gentlemen at the start of every performance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo they were teaching me . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo be part of it, yes. They\u2019d dress you up like a doll, push you out on the stage. At first, just as a poppet to sing and smile for the crowd. But the devil only knew how long it would take, before they wanted something more of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d As his meaning sank in, her face twisted. \u201cOh, God. That\u2019s horrible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know it\u2019s horrible. I know. That\u2019s why I had to take you out of that place. That\u2019s why I never wanted you to hear this.\u201d He ran a hand through his hair in agitation. \u201cKatie, don\u2019t ask me about it anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right. We\u2019ll speak of other things.\u201d She reached for his right wrist. \u201cHow is your arm healing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s better. Still clumsy, but improved. If I ever did save your life, I think you returned the favor that afternoon. We\u2019re even now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt that.\u201d Her fingers found their way to the border of his open collar. She pulled the gaping shirtfront to the side, exposing the hardened surface of his chest.</p><p>She stroked her fingertips over the most prominent of his tattoos. He sucked in his breath, trying not to let her touch affect him. Too late. His groin was already rock hard. So disgusting. So wrong, that he should be aroused by her, so soon after relating that tale.</p><p>\u201cThese make me so curious,\u201d she whispered. \u201cWhere did you get them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDifferent places,\u201d he answered dismissively. \u201cNone of them worth your notice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I want to know.\u201d</p><p>She pulled away from his embrace. A fresh gleam of determination lit her eyes. She ran her hand down his shirtfront, then gathered the linen hem and began hiking it, exposing his belly.</p><p>His abdominal muscles flinched and went rigid. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t you call me Katie? I like it when you do. Something about your voice when you say it, in that low, dangerous growl.\u201d She gathered the folds of his shirt in both hands now and raised it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cKatie . . .\u201d he groaned.</p><p>She smiled. \u201cYes. Like that. It makes me warm and tingly all over. Now raise your arms.\u201d</p><p>He could deny her nothing, and she knew it. She meant to make use of it.</p> <p>She drew the gathered shirt over his head and down his arms, then cast it gently aside. Swiveling her body, she angled to face him. Her gaze roamed over his bared chest, and the look in her eyes was a mix of fascination and fear. He felt the urge to hide the truth, the unpleasantness. But it was better that she see this and understand.</p><p>She said, \u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want to know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich was the first?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis one.\u201d He turned his shoulder to her, to point out the small rose inked there.</p> <p>\u201cHow did you get it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter I left London\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith me. After you left London with me, and delivered me to Margate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He swallowed. \u201cI couldn\u2019t go back to the Hothouse, of course. Even if I\u2019d wished to return, and I didn\u2019t. I roamed the countryside, doing odd work here and there, but mostly sleeping in haystacks and living off what small game I could snare. I found I had a knack for it, the coursing. It was as if I lived so wild, I developed an animal way of thinking. I sensed where the hare would be before it appeared, knew which direction it would flee. And the open land and fresh air . . . I think it did me good, after all those years of London soot. I was a dirty, scraggly thing, but I think those months were the closest to happiness I ever came.</p><p>\u201cI fell in with a poaching gang, once winter arrived. I brought them game to sell, they made sure I had a barn to sleep in and a warm coat and boots. This mark\u201d\u2014he rubbed the crudely drawn flower\u2014\u201cwas how the members knew one another. No names.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo friendships,\u201d she said. \u201cNo real human connections.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI did have a dog.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d She smiled. \u201cWhat was his name?\u201d</p><p>He hesitated. \u201cPatch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Samuel.\u201d She pressed a hand to her cheek and shook her head. \u201cI was so thoughtless. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cDon\u2019t be. Badger suits him.\u201d</p><p>She found the row of numbers inside his left forearm. \u201cAnd this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. Those mark the next stop in a poacher\u2019s career. Prison.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrison? Oh, no. How old were you then?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFifteen. I think.\u201d</p><p>She rubbed the tattoo. \u201cWas this some sort of identification number they gave to all the prisoners?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI did it myself, the first month. It\u2019s the date I was due to be released. Didn\u2019t want to risk it being forgotten.\u201d</p><p>\u201cForgotten by the gaolers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cForgotten by me.\u201d</p><p>Neither had he been willing to prolong his sentence by accepting any comforts in prison. Bedding, meat rations, the keys to the irons\u2014all of it came at a price, and the gaolers tallied it in ledgers. Sixpence a week for this, a shilling for that. By the time a man\u2019s sentence was served, he might have accrued debt in the tens of pounds\u2014and he wouldn\u2019t be released until he came up with the funds to pay it. Rather than face that madness, he had refused any extra food or blankets.</p><p>\u201cHow long were you imprisoned?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI was sentenced to seven years. But in the end, I only served four.\u201d</p><p>The word \u201conly\u201d contained all sorts of lies. Only four years of sleeping on straw so old it had turned to dust, and so thick with vermin that the dust seemed alive. Only four years of surviving on a penny\u2019s worth of bread a day. Only four years of shivering in irons that never were adjusted, even though he grew bigger and taller every month.</p><p>Yes, \u201conly\u201d four years of violence, hunger, ugliness, and animal treatment that haunted him to this day.</p><p>\u201cThe courts took mercy on you?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cMercy? Hardly. England needed soldiers more than she needed prisoners. They released me on the condition that I enlist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo this . . .\u201d She touched the medallion on the right side of his chest. \u201cIs this the symbol of your regiment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPartly.\u201d His chest lifted in a humorless chuckle. \u201cDon\u2019t go fishing for deep meaning in that one. Just too much rum in a Portuguese tavern one night, soon after we shipped to the Peninsula.\u201d</p><p>Her hand slipped down his rib cage and to the left, passing right over his heart. He winced at the ripples of pure pleasure.</p><p>\u201cAnd this . . . ?\u201d she asked. \u201cB.C. Who was she? Did you meet her in the same tavern? Was she exotic and big-breasted and terribly beautiful? Did you . . . care for her?\u201d</p><p>He stared at her, struggling like the devil not to laugh.</p><p>\u201cI hope she was a good person, for your sake. But however well she treated you, I must admit that I\u2019ve formed an irrational, intense dislike of her already. In my mind, I\u2019ve named her Bathsheba Cabbagewort.\u201d</p><p>Now he lost the struggle. He bent his head and laughed, long and low.</p><p>\u201cWell, there\u2019s something good come out of it,\u201d she said, eyes misty. \u201cI\u2019ve been growing quite desperate to hear you laugh. And it\u2019s just as I suspected.\u201d She touched his cheek. \u201cYou do have a dimple, just here. Tell me Bathsheba never saw that.\u201d</p><p>He put his hand over hers and drew it downward. He traced the letters on his side with her fingertip.</p><p>\u201cB.C.,\u201d he said. \u201cNot a woman. It stands for \u2018Bad Character.\u2019 It\u2019s what they mark on soldiers who are drummed out of their corps for criminal offenses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCriminal offenses? What did you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat didn\u2019t I do would be the better question. Looting, thieving, fighting, shirking duty, insubordination. Everything short of rape, murder, and desertion\u2014and I was primed to attempt the last. So far as I was concerned, His Majesty\u2019s government had beaten and starved everything human from me already. Then they\u2019d sent me to die on the battlefield. Nothing mattered to me anymore, Katie. I had no loyalty, no honor, no morality. I was truly more beast than man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you changed, obviously. And you did stay in the army, or you never would have come to Spindle Cove.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cAfter my drumming out, I was sent to Lord Rycliff. He was Lieutenant Colonel Bramwell then. It was his to say what to do with me\u2014prison, death, worse. But he took one look at me and said he\u2019d be a fool to send away any man with my fitness and strength. So he kept me on, made me his personal batman. His valet, in essence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was very good of him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t know. It was the first time in years that someone had entrusted me with anything. Rycliff wasn\u2019t much older than me, but he was comfortable with command. And he was nothing like my sergeants. He cared about the men in his regiment. He took pride in our mission. I worked so close to him, I guess some of that rubbed off on me. I started to see that there was honor to be found in doing a task well, no matter how small. Starching collars, mending seams, replacing buttons. But mostly the boots.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe boots?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cWorth more than my life\u2019s wages, his boots were. Worth more than my life itself, I\u2019d guess. This was the infantry. Every day, all day\u2014we marched, dug, fought. Come nightfall his boots would be covered in dust, muck, blood, worse. I slaved for hours to make them shine again. So he\u2019d look at them in the morning and know there was something worth saving beneath it all. And when I\u2019d finished with his boots, I still didn\u2019t sleep\u2014not until I\u2019d done the same with mine.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t loyal to the army or England so much as I was loyal to him\u2014or maybe even just to those boots. When he took a bullet to the knee\u2014I couldn\u2019t let him lose that leg, you know. No leg, no boot. Would have been giving up half my purpose in life.\u201d He rubbed his face and stared into the fire. \u201cHe\u2019s offered to grant me a commission now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLord Rycliff has?\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>\u201cWhat an honor, Samuel. Don\u2019t you want it?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m not made for that. I don\u2019t have Rycliff\u2019s ease with military politics. The open country is where I was best suited, even as a youth. It\u2019s where I belong now. Out in the wilderness, with the creatures that howl and claw and snarl. No social graces necessary.\u201d</p><p>There. He\u2019d laid it all out before her. His checkered past, his history of crime and violence. All the reasons he needed to leave England and stay far away from her.</p><p>And in response she said the most horrible thing he could imagine.</p><p>\u201cWould you take me with you?\u201d</p><p>Chapter Nineteen</p><p>\u201cTake you with me?\u201d he echoed. \u201cTo America?\u201d</p><p>Kate nodded. It seemed more than reasonable to her. He\u2019d suffered twenty years of violence and misery to pay the cost of her dreams. She could handle living in a cabin.</p><p>His brow furrowed. \u201cNo. No.\u201d</p><p>As she watched, he rose from the carpet and went to the opposite side of the small room, pulling her gown from the screen where he\u2019d hung it to dry and filling a pressing iron with hot coals.</p><p>Well. That wasn\u2019t quite the response she\u2019d been hoping for.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t leave me,\u201d she said. \u201cThe world will only push us back together. Haven\u2019t we learned that much? We\u2019re meant to be with each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re meant to be no such thing. You are the daughter of a marquess. You always were, even then. And I was always a lowborn cur. There\u2019s nothing we have in common. Nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you want me to be happy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I do.\u201d</p><p>He spread her frock over the table, carefully layering it between pressing cloths. The muscles of his left arm bunched and flexed as he skimmed the hot iron over fabric, working with care and confidence. She never could have dreamed how arousing this would be\u2014the sight of a massive, shirtless man pressing a gown. All she could think of was those hands roving over her body, warming and smoothing her own frayed edges.</p><p>\u201cKatie, I want you to have everything you\u2019re entitled to\u2014wealth, connections, Society. The family you always dreamed of finding. It\u2019s all yours now, and I\u2019ll be damned if I\u2019ll ruin that for you.\u201d He put the iron aside. \u201cYou can\u2019t be with someone like me. Look at me. That cousin of yours wouldn\u2019t hire me on as a footman.\u201d</p><p>If Thorne was this reluctant already, she wasn\u2019t about to tell him the truth of her inheritance. Not yet. He wouldn\u2019t see it as a convenience, only as one more factor widening the gulf he perceived between them.</p><p>Which wasn\u2019t a gulf at all. All that separated them was an imaginary line. But someone must take the first step across it, and Kate knew it would have to be her.</p><p>\u201cThis is about us, Samuel. No one else.\u201d She drew the blanket about her shoulders and rose to her feet. His stubbornness was a thing to be conquered, and she felt her courage rising. \u201cI\u2019m just me. Just Katie. Your Katie, as you called me once. I know you have feelings for me.\u201d</p><p>He set the iron down, agitated. \u201cI\u2019ve told you, time and again, it\u2019s only\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly desire. Yes, I know you\u2019ve told me that. And I know you\u2019re lying to me. Your feelings go much deeper than lust.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel nothing.\u201d His nostrils flared. He beat his fist against his chest. \u201cNothing. Do you understand me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that\u2019s not tr\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook. These letters.\u201d He pointed to the B.C. marked on the left side of his torso. \u201cDo you know how they make these marks?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head no.</p><p>\u201cThey take a board, about so big.\u201d He measured with his hands. \u201cAnd on it are protruding nails, forming the shapes of the letters. They press the points of those nails to your skin, and then they give the board a smart whack. With a fist, perhaps. Or maybe a mallet.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Kate winced. She stepped forward, but he held her off with an open hand.</p><p>\u201cAnd then, when they\u2019ve made all those tiny punctures, they take black powder\u2014you know enough about weaponry to know that it\u2019s corrosive stuff\u2014and rub it in the wounds to make the mark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat must have been torture.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t feel a thing. Just like I didn\u2019t feel these.\u201d</p><p>He turned, showing her his back. Kate\u2019s stomach turned as she viewed the lattice of twisted, branching scars that covered his skin.</p><p>\u201cFloggings,\u201d he said. \u201cA hundred lashes, for my countless offenses. They laid open my flesh to the muscle, and I swear to you, I didn\u2019t feel a stroke. Because I\u2019d learned how to deaden myself. To pain, to sorrow, to sentiment. To everything.\u201d</p><p>Tears stung at the corners of her eyes. She couldn\u2019t decide whether he deliberately told her falsehoods or had convinced himself of these untruths, but she hated hearing him speak this way.</p><p>This man felt, and he felt deeply.</p><p>\u201cSamuel . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I know what you\u2019re thinking. Today, you\u2019ve remembered some boy you once knew. He was fond of you and kind to you, and he did you a good turn, once. That boy doesn\u2019t exist anymore. The man I am . . . well, you can read for yourself.\u201d He pointed out the marks on his skin, one by one. \u201cThief. Prisoner. Drunken soldier. Bad character, through and through. I went dead inside long ago. And I feel nothing now.\u201d</p><p>She approached him slowly, in small increments, just as she would approach a cornered wild animal she didn\u2019t want to frighten away.</p><p>\u201cDo you feel this?\u201d She tilted her head and leaned in to kiss his neck. The scent of him made her pulse with longing.</p><p>\u201cKatie . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat of this?\u201d She stretched to kiss his cheek, allowing her lips to linger on the hard edge of his jaw. \u201cOr\u2014\u201d</p><p>He seized her by the arms, pushing her back. \u201cStop.\u201d</p><p>She dropped her gaze to his chest, surveying all the marks and scars he\u2019d collected since they parted in her childhood\u2014all of them incurred, in part, for her. The enormity of what those marks represented eclipsed any fear or sorrow she\u2019d ever known. She could scarcely comprehend the magnitude of his suffering, but she forced her mind to stretch, to try. He\u2019d sacrificed everything, including the only home he ever had. He\u2019d bought her a bright, shiny future at the cost of his own freedom.</p><p>How could she not love him? How could he deny loving her?</p><p>\u201cMy whole life,\u201d she began, her voice faltering, \u201cI clung to just a few scraps of memory. No matter how bleak my surroundings, those vague recollections gave me hope that someone, somewhere, had cared for me, once. And I always believed, to the very center of my being, that one day someone would love me again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell now you\u2019ve found the Gramercys. They will\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou. I found you.\u201d She put her hands on his chest. \u201cThe Gramercys are wonderful people. I\u2019m so fond of them now, and they\u2019re fond of me. But they never knew I existed. My poor mother . . . she seems to have been too preoccupied, and then too sick to give me much love. None of them were that force I carried all along, that hope that sustained me for years. That was you. All you.\u201d</p><p>A tear spilled down her cheek. \u201c \u2018Be brave, my Katie.\u2019 I remembered you saying that. You can never know what those words meant to me, and it was your voice, all along. And if\u2014\u201d</p><p>He closed his eyes and pressed his brow to hers. \u201cKatie, I beg you. For your own good, stop this.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd if you deny it now . . .\u201d She worked her hands high enough to frame his face. \u201cIf you deny that you care for me, you\u2019ll make my whole life a lie.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cYou\u2019re dreaming. Or confused. Overwrought by the day, perhaps. You can\u2019t mean to suggest you\u2019d give up everything here. The Gramercys, the wealth, all your friendships.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo be with the man I love? Absolutely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d His arm whipped around her and he turned, pressing her against the wall. \u201cDon\u2019t say it. You can\u2019t love me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you doubting my sincerity? Or are you forbidding me to love you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth.\u201d</p><p>He pinned her with a glare that was stern and fierce and ice-cold blue. So blue it made her heart sing. At last she knew why she\u2019d carried that memory of blue in her heart.</p><p>It was him. It had always been him.</p><p>His jaw tightened. \u201cI have nothing to offer you. Nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s true, it\u2019s only because you\u2019ve already given me everything a man could give. You saved me, Samuel. Not just the once, but so many times. You stepped in front of a horse whip. You took a melon to the head. You caught an adder in your bare hand, you dear, foolish man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did that for the dog.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy dog. Which you let me keep, even though you prized him yourself.\u201d She stroked his cheek, trying to soften his expression. \u201cI know you care. And I know you want me.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t try to deny that part. The desire in his eyes was knee-melting.</p><p>\u201cWhen you look at me that way, I feel so beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are beautiful.\u201d He sighed deep in his chest. His hands slid up and down her arms, caressing her roughly. \u201cSo damned beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo are you.\u201d She put a hand to his bare chest, tracing the defined ridges of his musculature. \u201cLike a diamond. Hard and gleaming, and cut with all these exquisite facets. Inside . . . pure, brilliant fire.\u201d</p><p>She slid her hands to the back of his neck, plunging her fingers through the velvety nap of his short hair. The clipped ends teased the webs between her fingers, setting off sparks of sensation throughout her body. She drew his head down to hers until his lips\u2014so strong, so sensual\u2014filled her vision. And then she closed her eyes and explored those lips with her own. Pressing slight, tender kisses to each corner of his mouth. Capturing his top lip between both of hers, and then giving the lower its due.</p><p>Nothing separated her breasts from his chest but a single layer of linen, which quickly heated and softened between them. A heavy ache settled in her breasts, and her nipples came to tight, desperate points. She rubbed them against his chest, hoping to soothe the ache, but only inflaming her desire.</p><p>And his, apparently.</p><p>His good left arm rested around her waist. He flexed his arm muscles, lifting her off her feet and drawing her pelvis flush with his. The hard ridge of his arousal pressed against her sex. The pleasure was blinding. Deafening. Numbing. It was as though all her senses sank inward, downward, the better to concentrate on that source of solid, delicious pressure between her legs.</p><p>She ground her hips against it. She could not have done otherwise. And when she\u2019d done so once, all she wanted was to do it again.</p><p>He groaned and nipped her earlobe. \u201cKatie, I want you. I can\u2019t make it poetry. I can\u2019t make it sound anything other than crude, because it is. I want you in my bed. I want you under me, holding me. I want to bury my cock so deep inside you.\u201d</p><p>The carnal words made her blush and stammer. \u201cI\u2014I want those things, too.\u201d</p><p>She wished she could have managed a more sophisticated reply. But the words worked well enough to earn her a kiss\u2014a wild, passionate storm of a kiss\u2014and then she was lost in the tempest of heat and longing.</p><p>His tongue thrust deep into her mouth, possessive and hot, coaxing her instinctive response. Her heartbeat quickened, and a matching pulse beat at the juncture of her thighs.</p><p>When he broke the kiss, he was breathing hard. \u201cYou should go. Leave me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you stay, I\u2019m taking you to my bed. And once I bed you, you\u2019re mine. Always. You must know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d A thrill shot through her. \u201cI want nothing more.\u201d</p><p>She gasped as he plucked her from the floor and carried her to the mattress. One-armed, as though she weighed nothing.</p><p>While she lay there, he stood back and began wrestling with the closures of his breeches. He worked left-handed, and clumsily. After a few moments she couldn\u2019t bear the suspense.</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t you let me help?\u201d She sat on her knees and reached for the buttons. The buckskin was butter-soft and stretched taut as a drum. Her mouth dried as she worked one row of buttons loose, freeing one side of the falls. Then she reached for the small row of closures in the center. She slid one fingertip beneath the waistband to aid her efforts. When her touch grazed his belly, he flinched, ticklish.</p><p>Kate smiled. She loosed one button, then another, exposing the dark line of hair that widened and thickened as she moved lower. It seemed she couldn\u2019t look her fill\u2014until the moment when she grasped the final button, and then she couldn\u2019t bear to look at all.</p><p>She tilted her face upward and found him staring down at her. His face was grim with restraint and his eyes dark with hunger. She slipped the last button free and watched his face as she slid her hand inside his breeches, exploring the hot, hard flesh within.</p><p>She marveled. He was so solid, so sleek, so intriguingly textured.</p><p>And so big.</p><p>Goodness. She was meant to take all this inside her?</p><p>As Kate watched him, his eyes fluttered closed and his head fell back. He pushed into her grasp with a strangled moan. She loved the sensual abandon in his expression, but she worried about the physical dimensions of his ardor. With every inch her sliding fingertips explored, he seemed to grow longer still\u2014and she grew increasingly doubtful about the logistics involved in this enterprise.</p><p>Perhaps her sense of touch was misleading her. Maybe if she looked the organ head-on, it wouldn\u2019t seem so intimidating.</p><p>She dropped her gaze and pushed his breeches down over his hips. Up it sprang from a thatch of dark hair. A thick, dusky curve of pure impossibility.</p><p>Were all men like this?</p><p>She put her hand on him again, since he seemed to enjoy it. He filled her grip, and then some. Kate suddenly had the urge to call a temporary halt to this entire interlude and pay a hasty call on a few of her married friends. Then she\u2019d return wiser, worldlier, and prepared with some kind of soothing poultice for afterward.</p><p>He gripped her hand, squeezing tight. \u201cEnough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid I do something wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. No. It\u2019s too right. Too good. I won\u2019t last.\u201d</p><p>Since she didn\u2019t suppose she could implement her first plan to dash out for education and herbal remedies, having this over with quickly didn\u2019t seem like a bad alternative.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind if it\u2019s fast,\u201d she said shyly.</p><p>For the second time in an hour she heard him laugh. It was such a lovely, gruff sound, she didn\u2019t even mind that he was laughing at her.</p><p>\u201cYou should mind.\u201d He stepped out of his breeches and set them aside.</p><p>She felt so stupid. He\u2019d been with many women, and no doubt all of them had been accomplished in a way that actually mattered. Proficient in bed sport, rather than arpeggios.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I haven\u2019t any useful experience to draw on. I just hope you\u2019ll tell me what pleases you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou please me.\u201d He sat next to her on the mattress and drew the fabric of the borrowed shirt aside to bare her shoulder. His lips traced the slope of her neck.</p><p>\u201cI mean, I should hate to suffer by comparison.\u201d</p><p>His lifted his head. His eyes flashed. \u201cThere is no comparison. None.\u201d</p><p>He slid his hand beneath the shirt to cup her breast. His strong fingers molded and shaped her.</p><p>She moaned as he teased her nipple, rolling it under his thumb. \u201cSamuel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d His voice was husky as he drew the shirt up and over her head. \u201cGive me my name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSamuel,\u201d she whispered, glad that he\u2019d given her this one way to please him. \u201cSamuel, I missed you every day that you were gone. I\u2019ve missed you so much.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He stretched his body over hers, covering her with his weight. She loved the feel of his body\u2014hard and heavy and covered in dark hair. So very different from her own. As he kissed her, he slid one thigh between hers. It excited her to feel his bare skin against her most intimate flesh.</p><p>His tongue swirled lazy patterns over her breast, painting her with delicious, silky heat. He fastened his mouth over her nipple and suckled hard, drawing the whole peak into his mouth. She cried out with the sharp joy of it, shamelessly rubbing and bucking against the firm slope of his thigh.</p><p>As he transferred his attentions to her other breast, he adjusted his weight to the side. She whimpered at the loss of friction against her sex, but his fingers skimmed down her belly and found her cleft. He sifted through the soft curls, stroking over her swollen folds before parting her gently and sliding a finger inside. Just an inch at first, then working deeper in smooth, blissful plunges. The sense of fullness was exquisite. His thumb found that sensitive bud at the crest of her sex and worked it in devilish circles. Soon she was rolling her hips to meet each deep slide of his finger, loving the way his palm slapped lightly against her flesh.</p> <p>\u201cSamuel, it\u2019s too . . . I can\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>The climax took her, fast and hard. She arched off of the bed, grinding down on his hand and crying out with pleasure. Her intimate muscles grasped at his invading finger, shamelessly begging for more.</p><p>As the last waves of joy rippled through her, he withdrew his touch. He settled his hips in the cradle of her thighs. His erection wedged hard and hot against her still-pulsing core.</p><p>\u201cDo you want me?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cMore than anything.\u201d</p> <p>He positioned himself at her entrance. \u201cYou want this? You\u2019re sure of it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She tilted her hips, eager to welcome him in. \u201cNow. Please. Just take me.\u201d</p><p>He took.</p><p>His first thrust was shallow\u2014she burned a bit as her inner walls stretched, but nothing too terrible.</p><p>This might not be so bad, she thought.</p><p>\u201cKatie,\u201d he moaned. \u201cYou feel like heaven.\u201d</p> <p>Not so bad at all.</p><p>But then the second plunge\u2014it was pure, stabbing misery. She buried her face in his shoulder to conceal her sob. As he rooted deeper in rhythmic, gentle thrusts, the pain eased a bit. But not so much that she could manage a convincing reply when he asked if she was well.</p><p>He swore.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d she asked. \u201cHave I done something\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re perfect. I just hate that I\u2019ve hurt you. I hate that it\u2019s done and I can\u2019t take it back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t hate any of it. The pain\u2019s better already. I love the feel of you inside me. I love knowing I can hold you like this, so close.\u201d She smoothed the hair from his brow and stared deep into his eyes. \u201cSamuel, I love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say that.\u201d But even as he resisted, he began to move again. Slowly, deeply. In ways she found tantalizing, rather than tormenting.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d She gave him a teasing smile. \u201cAre you afraid you might say it back?\u201d</p> <p>He flexed his thighs and slid deep, deep inside.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He pulled back, frowning. Hesitating. As though he were weighing the pleasure another thrust would bring him against the pain of facing words he didn\u2019t wish to hear.</p><p>She wouldn\u2019t let him intimidate her with those stormy looks. This was the bargain. If he wanted her body, he would have to accept her heart, too.</p><p>He grit his teeth and pushed into her, hard.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d she gasped, clutching his arms.</p><p>He increased his tempo, battering her with desperate motions. As though he would force her to break, to recant.</p><p>Not a chance.</p><p>She wrapped her legs around his hips and clung stubbornly to his neck. The words became a chant in time with his thrusts. She would chip away at the stone all night, if that\u2019s what it took to break down his walls.</p><p>\u201cLove you,\u201d she moaned. \u201cLove you. Love . . . you.\u201d</p><p>His face twisted into a tortured mask\u2014of agonized pleasure, or perhaps pleasurable agony. His eyebrows rose in anticipation, then crashed down into a fierce, determined line.</p><p>And then he broke away.</p><p>He pulled free of her body, turned aside, and gave those last, beautiful moments of abandon to the linen sheets instead. She tried not to feel hurt. For a whole host of reasons, a pregnancy would be ill-timed. It was good of him to think of her health and reputation, even in that wild, passionate moment.</p><p>But she couldn\u2019t hold back a whisper of disappointment. She wanted him all.</p><p>Spent and weakened, he slumped on the mattress. She turned and gathered him in her arms. She stroked his scarred, beautiful back, waiting to hear whatever he could bring himself to say.</p><p>After long moments he rose up on one elbow. He stared at her, still breathing hard. His eyes were dark and fathomless as he stroked the hair from her brow and trailed a gentle touch down her cheek.</p><p>Finally, he repaid all her nervous waiting with just one deep, resonant word.</p><p>\u201cKatie.\u201d</p><p>And it was enough. Enough to make her heart soar and her eyes burn with blissful tears. Enough to make her desperate for his kiss. She tugged him close, dragging his mouth to hers and reveling in the sweet possession.</p><p>With this man, there would never be poetry. Very few parties, and even less dancing. They\u2019d never sit down to the pianoforte and play clever duets.</p><p>She could wait her whole life, and he might never find the words to say he loved her.</p><p>But the truth of it was written all over his skin. And that was enough.</p><p>Chapter Twenty</p><p>Afterward, she slept.</p><p>Thorne didn\u2019t.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t have slept, even if he\u2019d wished to. Too many thoughts rioted in his skull. He lay awake, keeping one arm curled protectively around her shoulders and watching the smoke from the fireplace draw upward and disappear into the darkness overhead.</p><p>It was done now. There could be no undoing it. Now he was resolved to give her everything she deserved. As close to it as he could manage, anyway.</p><p>Beside him, she stirred, rousing halfway from sleep. She rolled toward him, nestling close and throwing her arm over his chest. Her fingers toyed idly with the hair there, sifting through the springy tufts and lifting them playfully.</p><p>Then her touch swept downward. If he hadn\u2019t been already hard before she started petting him, he was rock solid now.</p><p>She whispered, \u201cMake love to me again?\u201d</p><p>He stared at her, amazed, and stroked a wayward lock of hair from her face.</p><p>Was that what they\u2019d done, just an hour or so ago? Make love? She\u2019d certainly uttered the word enough times, like some kind of incantation. The idea was in him now, and he didn\u2019t know what to make of it.</p><p>He rather liked her phrase for bedding, though: \u201cmake love.\u201d It made the emotion sound concrete. Comprehensible. Like a product that could be manufactured from whole cloth. Take two lusting, yearning bodies and rub them briskly together, and this substance called love would simply result\u2014simple as striking two flints to make a spark.</p><p>Unfortunately, Thorne didn\u2019t think it worked quite that way.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too soon,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ll be tender. I don\u2019t want to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am tender, I\u2019ll admit. But aren\u2019t there other ways?\u201d</p><p>He lifted a brow, skeptical. \u201cWhat could you know of other ways?\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cReally, Samuel. Women do talk among themselves. And more than one risqu\u00e9 novel has made the rounds of the Queen\u2019s Ruby.\u201d</p><p>Thorne choked back a derisive noise. There were heroes of novels, and then there were men like him. Whatever those bawdy stories had taught her, no doubt it was some genteel, delicate imagining of lust\u2014as evidenced by the way she trailed light, sweet caresses up and down his stiffened cock right now.</p><p>He fought the urge to take her hand, take control. He could show her how to grip him tight. He could guide her into stroking him hard and fast, relentlessly, until he snarled and bucked like a wild beast. He could put her on all fours and take her like an animal, savagely pumping her from behind.</p><p>He doubted any of those scenes were in her risqu\u00e9 novels. They certainly had nothing to do with \u201cmaking love.\u201d</p><p>His own crudeness concerned him, as it never had in the past. Unlike any other woman he\u2019d bedded, Katie had a way of demolishing his self-control. When he\u2019d been inside her, pushing closer and closer to release\u2014he\u2019d felt himself slipping closer and closer to some precipice, too. That was the reason he\u2019d withdrawn. He\u2019d come too close to that divide, and he didn\u2019t know what waited on the other side. It might be a dark, shadowy place. If he fell into it, he worried he could lose himself.</p><p>He could hurt her.</p><p>He folded his arms behind his head and laced his fingers together, just to forbid them from wandering. Her light, teasing touch was already more than he should hope for. He\u2019d content himself with this.</p><p>\u201cGo back to sleep,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t. I\u2019m a newly engaged woman, and I\u2019m too busy making plans. Do you think we can be married in St. Ursula\u2019s? It\u2019s such a beautiful church. I always dreamed of being married there.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose I was the man standing at the altar with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not certain. Maybe you were. His face was always rather shadowy. But exceedingly handsome.\u201d She propped herself up on one elbow and faced him, eyes bright and inquisitive. \u201cDid you ever dream about me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes,\u201d he admitted reluctantly, only because it was obvious she hoped to hear him say yes. \u201cI tried not to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would you try not to?\u201d</p><p>He stared into the darkness overhead. \u201cBecause my dreams didn\u2019t have anything to do with marriage or church.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she said, drawing a coy touch down the center of his chest.</p><p>\u201cIt didn\u2019t seem right, to use you that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s absurd.\u201d</p><p>She flipped atop him, belly-to-belly, stacking her arms on his chest and replacing his view of the looming shadows with her own radiant, smiling face. Her hair tumbled about them both, making a draped, hidden room to house their kiss.</p><p>God. He couldn\u2019t believe this was real. That she was here, and his. He was almost afraid to touch her for fear she\u2019d vanish, so he kept his hands tucked beneath his head and allowed her to kiss him, just as long and as deeply as she wished.</p><p>\u201cSamuel,\u201d she said at length, \u201cyou have my express permission to dream about me however and whenever you like.\u201d She sat tall, straddling his torso, and jabbed one fingertip into his breastbone. \u201cWith one condition\u2014you must tell me all about it when you wake up, so I can make the fantasies real.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say that. You\u2019ve no idea the depravities a man\u2019s imagination can supply.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen enlighten me.\u201d</p><p>She braced her hands on either side of his body and leaned on them. Her slight breasts swung forward, taunting him, and the downy curls between her thighs brushed against his belly. His cock arched and strained upward, seeking her softness and heat. With one brisk tug on her hips, he could have her sex cradling his. Then sinking down to sheathe him, so very tight.</p><p>He groaned a little. But he kept his hands firmly pinned beneath his head.</p><p>\u201cTell me.\u201d Her voice was a smoky whisper. \u201cTell me your every last depraved, wicked, carnal desire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d be here a week.\u201d</p><p>A coy smile tipped her mouth. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. No matter how smugly pleased she looked with herself, he knew she was just a few hours past the first blush of innocence.</p><p>She sat up straight, tossing her hair back over her shoulders and looking down at him. \u201cI\u2019m serious, Samuel. I won\u2019t have you treating me like some untouchable, delicate lady. Saving your truest, deepest cravings for dreams that feature someone else. I\u2019m jealous. I don\u2019t want to merely appear in your dreams. I want to be the only woman in them, from this day forward.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He stared up at her, fingers woven behind his head. He\u2019d never considered the matter that way.</p><p>If she was truly that determined to learn something of his darkest desires . . . he supposed he could oblige her. But he would keep to the fantasies that didn\u2019t put her in any sort of risk.</p><p>Ones that placed her in control.</p><p>He unhooked his hands from behind his head. Beginning at her shoulders, he skimmed a touch down her arms until he clasped her hands in his. He took and lifted them to the level of her torso, then fitted her palms over her own pale, smooth breasts.</p><p>\u201cHold these for me,\u201d he said.</p><p>Then he reclined to the pillow, once again lacing his hands beneath his head.</p><p>She gave him a quizzical look. Then she turned that quizzical expression on her own breasts, plumping them lightly in her hands. \u201cWhat am I to do with them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever feels good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re just going to lie there and watch?\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>Her brow wrinkled. \u201cTruly. This is something men fantasize about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith regularity.\u201d</p><p>She laughed and blushed a little, as women did when they were embarrassed. He simply lay there, waiting, and offered no excuse.</p><p>Eventually, she shrugged. \u201cAs you wish, then.\u201d</p><p>With her palms, she gently lifted and shaped the modest swells of creamy flesh. She ran her fingertips around the circumference of each breast. And then she balanced them carefully, like two weights on either side of a scale, and pressed her thumbs to her hardened nipples.</p><p>\u201cLike this?\u201d she asked. \u201cAm I doing it right?\u201d</p><p>He nodded, unable to answer aloud. His tongue had plastered itself to the roof of his mouth.</p><p>As she rolled her own nipples beneath her thumbs, a wash of pink spread across her chest and worked its way up her throat. Her lips fell apart, swollen and red, and she moistened them with her tongue.</p><p>\u201cPinch them,\u201d he scraped out.</p><p>She gasped faintly as she obeyed, catching the puckered, berry-red nubs between her thumbs and forefingers. As she pinched and plucked, she closed her eyes and arched her back, thrusting those luscious breasts forward for his view. Her pelvis rocked against his tensed abdomen.</p><p>She was already so wet. He was painfully hard.</p><p>\u201cI did this once,\u201d she whispered, opening her eyes. Her gaze was dark and glittering, and a shy smile played about her lips. \u201cThat night after the outing to Wilmington. I touched myself just like this and tried to imagine your mouth on me.\u201d</p> <p>Holy God. He\u2019d never heard anything so arousing in his life. His fingers curled like talons, biting into his scalp, but he didn\u2019t move. He didn\u2019t dare reach for her\u2014or before she could whisper a word of caution, he\u2019d be ballocks-deep in her tender flesh, rutting like a beast.</p><p>Still, he couldn\u2019t resist wanting more.</p><p>\u201cBring them here,\u201d he said. \u201cBring them to me. Let me taste.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cYes, Corporal.\u201d</p><p>Her pert response made him wild. Normally, Thorne didn\u2019t care for those power games in the bedchamber. He hated any implication that he would trade on his rank for pleasure.</p><p>But she wasn\u2019t ceding to his will. She was poking fun at him for resorting to a stern, military tone. She knew he was desperate. She knew she\u2019d made him that way, and she was already learning to relish her sensual power.</p><p>Damn, but she was a quick study. A clever, clever girl.</p><p>And he was a lucky, lucky man.</p><p>With one hand, she gripped the headboard for balance and support. She cupped her breast with the other, leaning forward until her taut nipple hovered an inch above his lips. The scent and warmth of her skin were palpable, intoxicating. She was teasing again, waiting for him to stretch and bridge that last distance.</p><p>Minx. He could tease, as well.</p><p>He pursed his lips and blew, sending a current of air rushing over her nipple. Her skin erupted in gooseflesh, and a delicious shudder traveled through her body and straight into his.</p><p>He stretched his tongue\u2014just the very tip of his tongue\u2014and flicked over just the very tip of her nipple.</p><p>Then he pursed his lips and blew again.</p><p>\u201cSamuel.\u201d</p><p>He ached for contact and physical release, but the needy edge in her voice was satisfying in a different way. A deeper way.</p><p>She lowered her breast, rubbing its silky weight against his unshaven cheek. He closed his eyes as the sweet, tender berry of her nipple traced his bottom lip. He smiled\u2014a rarity for him\u2014just to stretch his lips and give her more distance to cover.</p><p>They spent several minutes like this\u2014teasing, lightly tasting. Each baiting the other in turn. As if acknowledging they had a lifetime to enjoy this, so there was no reason to rush just now.</p><p>He lazily mouthed her breasts\u2014first one, then the other. She braced both hands on the headboard and leaned close, so he might alternate at will. Her breathing went ragged and a heady musk filled the air. As he licked at her nipples, she began to rock in a slow, steady rhythm, grinding against his belly. He drew one peak into his mouth and suckled hard, until she gave a low moan.</p><p>She responded to him so naturally. He might have been able to make her come this way. But that couldn\u2019t be enough for him now. That moan pushed him past some breaking point, and he craved more.</p><p>He let his head fall back against the pillow, releasing her glistening breast to the dark, cool air. He unlaced his hands from beneath his head and grasped her by the waist.</p><p>And then he pulled forward, drawing her toward his mouth.</p><p>She tensed. \u201cSamuel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou claimed to know there are other ways.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wanted to know my every dark, depraved fantasy.\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cI know. It\u2019s just\u2014\u201d</p><p>Her words broke off as he lifted her by the waist, resettling her so her knees rested on either side of his broad shoulders. The pose spread her wide. She was pink and dewy and beautiful. Perhaps he shouldn\u2019t push her this far, this soon. But he was out of his mind with lust, couldn\u2019t rest now until he tasted her. All of her.</p><p>\u201cHold the headboard,\u201d he commanded.</p><p>\u201cAre you certain this is right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s perfect.\u201d Then, more hoarsely, \u201cYou\u2019re perfect.\u201d</p><p>He parted her with his thumbs, opening her to his kiss. He needed to get his mouth on her, and then she\u2019d warm to the idea.</p><p>He began slowly, just as he had with her breasts. First teasing her with his breath, then sweeping light, flickering passes of his tongue all along her crease. He explored her every ridge and fold. When he focused his attentions on the swollen pearl at the crest, he heard a little sob of pleasure catch in her throat.</p><p>Yes.</p><p>Triumph pulsed through his veins. He gripped her hip, holding her still and close for his attentions. With his other hand, he reached for his own throbbing staff.</p><p>Easier this way, he thought. If he tended to matters himself, he wouldn\u2019t be tempted to paw at her afterward. By taking himself in hand, he\u2019d keep his baser needs under control.</p><p>It wouldn\u2019t take long, for either of them. As he stroked his eager cock, he kept up a brisk, relentless rhythm with his tongue. With a bit of trial, he found the angle and rhythm that pleased her\u2014one that had her gasping and arching against his open-mouthed kiss.</p><p>Yes. Move with me. Come for me.</p><p>Her mewling sighs of pleasure drove his own excitement to a dizzying peak. He\u2019d never known anything so arousing in his life. She was so trusting, so completely spread open and vulnerable. So damned delicious against his tongue, positively molten with desire for him. For him. Perhaps he would never make her light up from within, but he could make her burn.</p><p>He could make her pant. And sigh. And moan.</p><p>This was a fantasy indeed. Lifting his eyes, he could watch her breasts sway and bounce. Her thigh muscle gave a sweet quiver against his jaw, and he knew whatever thin cord of restraint was left to him would surely snap. Soon. Raw, animal need chased beneath the surface of his skin, seeking release.</p><p>He gripped his cock tighter, pumped faster. So close.</p><p>\u201cSamuel,\u201d she gasped. \u201cSamuel, I can\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>She cried out and bucked against his mouth, shaking the headboard with the force of her crisis.</p><p>Hearing his name on her lips, in that lusty voice . . . it sent him over the edge. His own climax erupted, wrenching his hips off the mattress. He came growling and shuddering, spilling his seed in forceful jets.</p><p>In the aftermath, the only sounds were the crackle of the fire, the muted patter of rain, and the hoarse, open-mouthed rasps of their breathing.</p><p>Well. She\u2019d wanted carnality.</p><p>As soon as he could regain some strength in his limbs, he guided her aside and helped her settle onto the mattress. She curled next to him with her eyes closed, still working for breath.</p><p>She was so quiet for so long, he began to worry. Damn it. He must have shocked her too greatly. She was having regrets, wondering just what sort of beast she\u2019d tethered herself to.</p><p>He stroked her hair, teasing out the rain-induced tangles with his fingers. \u201cAre you well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she replied. \u201cI\u2019m well indeed. I\u2019m just not sure how to look at you after that.\u201d</p><p>After a moment\u2019s thought, he suggested, \u201cWith pride?\u201d</p><p>She laughed into her pillow.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious. You were perfect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have such a wicked sense of humor. You always make me laugh at the most unlikely moments.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that a good thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a wonderful thing.\u201d She propped her chin on his chest. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the things I love most about you. And it\u2019s what assures me we\u2019ll be happy together. We\u2019re neither of us perfect people, but we can laugh together and admit our mistakes. And there\u2019s this.\u201d She eyed the mussed bed linens, blushing.</p><p>There was \u201cthis\u201d indeed.</p><p>\u201cAfter what we just did,\u201d she said, \u201cI don\u2019t suppose I could have a single secret from you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI pressed you too far just now. It\u2019s your first time. I should have been more tender, more\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease. Don\u2019t apologize for giving me unfathomable pleasure. It\u2019s just . . . for a fantasy girl, I didn\u2019t even do much of anything.\u201d Smiling, she touched his flagging erection. \u201cI\u2019d like to help with this part next time.\u201d</p><p>A hoarse chuckle lifted his chest. \u201cThat can be arranged. Shortly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo we have a little time to talk first?\u201d</p><p>He sat up in bed, pushing a hand through his hair before reaching for his flask. \u201cA few minutes, at least. I\u2019m not a youth anymore.\u201d</p><p>At her chirping call, Badger abandoned his quilt and leaped onto the bed. The pup circled a good five times before finally wedging into a space between them. His tail whipped furiously.</p><p>\u201cThere we are,\u201d she said. \u201cJust like a little family. We\u2019ll be very cozy in America.\u201d</p><p>Thorne took a casual draught off his flask. Best not tell her that with those simple words she\u2019d gone and made his wildest, most depraved and outrageous fantasy come true. He\u2019d keep that information to himself. Until after a few more rounds of pleasure, at least.</p><p>She dropped her gaze and picked at an edge of the bedsheet. \u201cI\u2019m legitimate.\u201d</p><p>He choked on his mouthful of whiskey. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvan and the solicitors found a marriage record. It seems Simon and Elinor\u2014my parents\u2014were married in secret. And the housekeeper from Ambervale identified me by my birthmark. So it seems I\u2019m not just a Gramercy, I\u2019m . . .\u201d</p><p>Oh, Jesus. Don\u2019t say it.</p><p>She lifted her head and looked at him. \u201cI\u2019m a lady.\u201d</p><p>The room tilted. Then the walls began to spin around him.</p><p>A lady.</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t look so overset,\u201d she begged. \u201cIt won\u2019t change a thing between us.\u201d</p><p>A cloud of frustration blurred his vision. She was the legitimate daughter of a marquess. A lady. How could that not change everything? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>God damn it. It was as though every time he dared to reach for her, some cruel, vengeful deity pulled her just a little further out of his grasp. If he found a way around this hurdle, what would be next? She\u2019d be revealed to be a princess? A mermaid?</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re still going to marry and go to America,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s all I want, is to be with you. To be your wife.\u201d</p><p>A marquess\u2019s legitimate daughter, living as a trapper\u2019s wife in a humble, rough-hewn cabin. In Indiana.</p> <p>Lady Katherine of the Prairie. Right.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not angry with me, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAngry with you? Why would I be angry with you?\u201d Even as he spoke the words, he was aware that they sounded . . . well, angry.</p><p>He forced himself to take a deep breath and then exhale slowly.</p><p>She was right; it didn\u2019t matter. Not after what they\u2019d just shared. They must marry, whether she was a charwoman or a fairy queen. He couldn\u2019t waste time feeling worthless or counting all the ways he wasn\u2019t good enough for her.</p> <p>Whatever sort of woman she was . . . he had to be the man she needed.</p><p>Thorne scrubbed a hand through his hair, trying to fit his brain around the notion.</p><p>\u201cOf course you\u2019re a lady,\u201d he said finally. He reached for her hand. \u201cYou always were, to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey haven\u2019t told anyone yet,\u201d she said. \u201cOnly the family and the solicitors know. Evan\u2019s made arrangements with Sir Lewis to host a ball at Summerfield next week. It\u2019s supposed to be the Gramercys\u2019 parting gift to Spindle Cove, but they secretly plan to introduce me as their cousin that night. From there, we were meant to go to London.\u201d She reached for his hand. \u201cBut I\u2019ll explain to them that we\u2019ve reconciled and plan to marry, as soon as possible.\u201d</p><p>He held up a hand for silence and listened. \u201cThe rain has slowed. The hour isn\u2019t even that late. We can dress, and I\u2019ll take you down to the rooming house. Then I\u2019ll explain matters to Drewe.\u201d</p><p>She paled. \u201cOh, no. We can\u2019t go to him like this. Not tonight. He has a famous temper. There\u2019s no telling how he\u2019ll react if he knows we\u2019ve\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf he\u2019s any sort of man, he\u2019s out searching for you already. They could be pounding at the door any moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I must go.\u201d She scrambled from the bed, wrapping one of the sheets about her torso for modesty.</p><p>He rose from the bed as well\u2014making no such modesty attempts. \u201cKatie, I won\u2019t let you walk home alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must. Otherwise, it will be obvious what\u2019s happened between us, and Evan would . . .\u201d She pulled her shift over her head. \u201cSamuel, there\u2019s a very real chance he would try to kill you.\u201d</p><p>Kill him? Thorne couldn\u2019t help but chuckle at that. His lordship was welcome to try.</p><p>\u201cJust let me break the news gently,\u201d she said. Her fingers worked desperately to do up her buttons. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>He swore, despising himself for causing her such obvious distress. Of course she wanted to break the news gently, because there was no way in hell a family of aristocrats\u2014no matter how eccentric and unconventional\u2014would rejoice to see their legitimate cousin marry a man like him.</p><p>Even he couldn\u2019t rejoice at the idea. The two halves of his being were at war\u2014the half that wanted the best for her, against the half that simply wanted her.</p> <p>He gathered a pair of loose trousers and pulled them on.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ll have a little money,\u201d she said, rolling a woolen stocking up her leg and tying it off with a simple garter. \u201cThat\u2019s the good news. We can buy ourselves a fair slice of America.\u201d</p><p>Smiling, she reached past him to take her frock from the screen. He took the garment from her hands.</p><p>\u201cTurn away,\u201d he said. \u201cArms up.\u201d</p><p>He helped her into the frock, taking time with all the buttons and laces. His right hand was still clumsy, so several moments passed.</p><p>When he\u2019d finished, he put his hands on her slender waist. \u201cKatie, how can you truly want that life? How can you want me?\u201d</p><p>She swiveled to face him. \u201cHow could I want anyone else?\u201d</p><p>To be sure, she said such sweet things now. But in time, he worried she\u2019d come to resent him. A solitary life on the American frontier would give her far too many quiet hours to ponder all she\u2019d left behind. A comfortable, lavish home and every convenience money could purchase. Her pupils, her friends. The family she\u2019d waited her whole life to find.</p><p>\u201cYou will miss them.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI will miss them. And I\u2019ll be happy with you. The two conditions can coexist.\u201d</p><p>Not knowing what to say without contradicting her, he instead bent his head and took her mouth in a kiss.</p><p>What started out tender quickly became passionate, feverish. He clutched her tight against his body and swept his tongue between her lips. She opened to him readily, no hint of shyness or restraint, and he kissed her as deeply as he could. Probing, searching. Desperately seeking the reassurance that would give his guilt-stricken soul some peace.</p><p>Convince me. Make me believe I can make you happy.</p><p>Light up for me.</p><p>When they broke apart, her cheeks were flushed and her eyes were glassy. But he couldn\u2019t exactly say that she glowed. Damn.</p><p>\u201cSamuel, I won\u2019t claim loving you is easy. But it\u2019s scarcely the hardship you\u2019re making it out to be, either.\u201d She stretched to touch his face, rubbing the spot between his eyebrows with a single fingertip. \u201cI want to iron this flat. Stop fretting so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not fretting. Men don\u2019t fret.\u201d</p><p>Men acted. If he saw a problem, a real man addressed it. He took bold risks, made life-altering changes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll let you go home to the Gramercys tonight,\u201d he said, \u201con one condition. Don\u2019t tell them anything just yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019ll have to\u2014\u201d</p><p>He shushed her by placing two fingertips to her soft pink lips.</p><p>\u201cNot a word of this. Not yet.\u201d He caressed her cheek. \u201cI want to ask for you properly. I must speak to Drewe myself, Katie. Man-to-man. You cannot deny me that.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed and nodded. \u201cI understand. Will you come down to the village tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI need to return to London. I need some time to make arrangements first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you be long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA few days, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes shimmered. \u201cPromise you\u2019ll return?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have my word.\u201d</p><p>She had his word, his heart, his soul, his life. Always.</p><p>And he had a few days. A few days\u2019 time\u2014to change his life and place a wild, reckless wager on the future.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-One</p><p>Kate stood before a mirror in the Queen\u2019s Ruby.</p><p>Fretting.</p><p>It was all very well and good for Samuel to say men didn\u2019t fret. But he was cruel to give her so much reason to fret herself. Nearly a week had passed since their night at the castle, and she hadn\u2019t heard a word. While she had no reason to doubt his intentions, the longer she went without breaking the news to the Gramercys, the more of a liar she felt.</p><p>All week long the Gramercys had gone about making plans for Ambervale and Town. Parties they would host, places they would take her to see, people to whom she would be introduced. Kate tried to limit her responses to noncommittal nods and polite smiles, but she knew she was giving them the impression that she meant to come live with them forever.</p><p>Now it was the night of the ball. In a matter of hours she would be introduced as Lady Katherine Gramercy to all of Spindle Cove. To be sure, this was not exactly English high society\u2014but word would spread to London, and soon. When she eloped to America with an enlisted man just weeks thereafter\u2014wouldn\u2019t that be a public embarrassment for the Gramercys?</p><p>And if her connection to the Hothouse ever became public . . . if the gossips of London ever learned that a onetime Marchioness of Drewe had lived as a Southwark opera dancer . . .</p><p>That would be a scandal of the worst order. It could affect the entire family\u2019s standing and destroy Lark\u2019s prospects.</p><p>Kate knew she could spare them pain by leaving quietly with Thorne. The inheritance didn\u2019t matter to her. But it must be done before they made her identity public.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t wait for Samuel any longer. She needed to speak with Evan, tonight.</p><p>She twisted and turned before the small mirror, judging her reflection. The color had been Lark\u2019s suggestion\u2014a lush cobalt-blue silk with a lace overlay in a darker, midnight shade of indigo. The hue seemed rather daring for an unmarried lady, but they wanted her to stand out. And she always felt her best in blue.</p><p>\u201cOh, Kate. Aren\u2019t you lovely.\u201d</p><p>Aunt Marmoset entered the room. The older woman was dressed in a long, draped violet gown and matching gloves. An ostrich plume adorned her wispy, upswept hair.</p><p>Kate fidgeted with a curl at her temple, trying to arrange it just over her birthmark. \u201cI can\u2019t make this curl cooperate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me try.\u201d Aunt Marmoset plucked a hairpin from the dressing table, beckoning Kate to duck her head. \u201cThere now.\u201d</p><p>Kate stood and looked in the mirror again. Aunt Marmoset had pinned the curl back, smoothing it away from her face entirely.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t hide the mark, dear. It\u2019s what makes you one of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s an old habit, and I can\u2019t help being nervous tonight,\u201d she confessed.</p><p>The older woman came to stand beside her in the mirror, sliding an arm about her waist. The ostrich feather barely grazed Kate\u2019s shoulder. \u201cLark always likes it when I stand beside her,\u201d Aunt Marmoset said. \u201cShe says I make her look tall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know about tall, but I do feel stronger when you\u2019re near.\u201d In the mirror, Kate watched a tentative smile spread across her own face.</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d said Aunt Marmoset. \u201cI knew your appearance wasn\u2019t quite complete, but I couldn\u2019t place the deficiency. That smile was missing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you for helping me find it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou might wish I hadn\u2019t. I was on the verge of giving you this instead.\u201d</p><p>Aunt Marmoset unclenched one frail, knobby hand. From it unfurled a slender gold chain. And at the end of the chain dangled a pendant.</p><p>The pendant.</p><p>\u201cOh my goodness,\u201d Kate gasped.</p><p>A quick glance toward her mother\u2019s portrait confirmed it. It was the same teardrop of dark blue stone, veined with amber and white. So distinctive, that stone, with its lacy, scalloped layers of light and dark. It reminded her of when Sir Lewis showed the ladies a bit of butterfly wing under a magnifier.</p><p>\u201cWhere did this come from?\u201d Kate asked, amazed.</p><p>\u201cI asked the servants to pack my jewelry from Ambervale and send it down for the ball. Evidently, the maid found this hidden away in the dressing table and assumed it was mine. But it isn\u2019t mine at all, is it? It\u2019s yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow wonderful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s have it on.\u201d Aunt Marmoset fixed the chain about Kate\u2019s neck.</p><p>Kate turned to view it in the mirror. The indigo-blue pendant dangled just at her breastbone.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s lovely,\u201d Aunt Marmoset said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a miracle.\u201d Kate turned to the older woman and, bending low, kissed her on the cheek. \u201cYour kindness is worth more to me than any jewelry, Aunt Marmoset. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve thanked you properly for helping me feel at home in this family, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBosh.\u201d Aunt Marmoset waved off the remark. \u201cYou are at home in the Gramercy family. When will you accept that?\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t know, Kate thought. I don\u2019t know.</p><p>In her heart, she did believe that she was Katherine Adele Gramercy. She also knew herself to be the daughter of an unfortunate Southwark prostitute, as well as an impoverished orphan who\u2019d been raised as the ward of a school. Perhaps all these things could eventually be reconciled into one existence, but . . . </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But mostly, she was just a girl named Kate, in love for the first time in her life.</p><p>She loved Samuel. She missed him, terribly.</p><p>From the corridor, a call went up. \u201cThe carriages, ladies! They\u2019re here.\u201d</p> <p>As they emerged into the corridor, Kate was startled by the sight of a ravishing woman in red emerging from a side room. She was quite sure she\u2019d never seen this lady before. Her dark hair was piled high in a profusion of sensual curls. A thick rope of gold and rubies encircled her elegant neck.</p><p>The woman turned.</p><p>Kate gasped with recognition. \u201cHarry? Harry, is that truly you?\u201d</p><p>Her cousin smiled. \u201cOf course, dear. Did you think I\u2019d wear trousers to your grand introduction ball?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t ask you to be anyone but yourself,\u201d Kate said, hoping her cousin would feel the same toward her.</p> <p>Harry shrugged. Her ruby-red lips curved in a seductive smile. \u201cI do enjoy a lavish gown on occasion. Sometimes I like to remind them all just what it is they\u2019re missing.\u201d</p><p>Lark appeared at her sister\u2019s side, looking fresh and pretty in diaphanous white.</p><p>\u201cOh, Lark. I didn\u2019t know if you\u2019d be joining us, since you\u2019re not yet out.\u201d</p><p>The young lady smiled and blushed. \u201cEvan\u2019s making an exception tonight. So long as I don\u2019t dance.\u201d</p><p>Their loyalty was so touching. Look at all they\u2019d done for her, Kate thought, tonight alone. Harry had put on a gown, and Lark was willing to undercut the excitement of her own debut. All this, at the end of a summer holiday they\u2019d completely rearranged for the sake of spending time with her.</p><p>Little did they suspect that she was planning to bid them farewell in a matter of days. Forever. Would the Gramercys be able to understand her reasons for leaving, or would they feel betrayed?</p> <p>She\u2019d miss them, no question. But she had to be with Samuel, and he couldn\u2019t stay here in England. He needed open land and the sort of opportunities England couldn\u2019t\u2014or wouldn\u2019t\u2014afford a man of low birth and criminal background. After the way he\u2019d suffered, it was her turn to make the sacrifices, and she would do so gladly.</p><p>She owed that man everything. Everything. If not for him . . .</p><p>She couldn\u2019t bear to contemplate her life if not for him.</p><p>Samuel, where are you?</p><p>Instead, it was Evan who stood in the Queen\u2019s Ruby entryway, watching them come down the stairs. He pressed a hand to his chest and pretended to stumble. \u201cWhat a stunning collection of ladies.\u201d</p><p>Evan was rather stunning himself. Dressed in a black tailcoat and a waistcoat of embroidered gold silk, he looked every inch the marquess. And his black gloves . . . My, but the man always had the most elegant, exquisitely fitted gloves. They made his hands look ready for all manner of deeds\u2014charitable, sensual, ruthless.</p><p>As Kate reached the bottom of the stairs, he offered her an arm. \u201cAll the other ladies have gone ahead in Sir Lewis\u2019s carriages. There\u2019s just the two family coaches left.\u201d</p><p>They walked out into the front garden. Indeed, the two coaches emblazoned with the Drewe crest stood waiting at attention, drawn by perfectly matched teams of warmbloods.</p> <p>Evan handed Aunt Marmoset, Harry, and Lark into the first of the coaches, then signaled the driver to be on his way.</p><p>\u201cWill it be just the two of us, then?\u201d she asked, surprised.</p><p>\u201cDo you mind?\u201d He handed her into the second coach, then followed and sat opposite on the rear-facing bench, out of deference to her skirts. \u201cI was hoping we could talk alone. Before the ball.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Kate said as the carriage rolled into motion. \u201cOh, good. I was hoping the same.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cI\u2019m glad we\u2019re in accord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been thinking\u2014\u201d</p><p>They both uttered the words at once, speaking over each other. And then they both laughed.</p><p>He motioned with his gloved hand. \u201cPlease. You first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvan, I\u2019m not sure you should announce me as your cousin tonight.\u201d</p><p>He was silent for several moments, and Kate was sure she\u2019d ruined everything.</p><p>\u201cI agree,\u201d he finally said.</p><p>\u201cYou do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d prefer to introduce you as my future wife.\u201d</p><p>Pure astonishment stole Kate\u2019s breath. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the reason I wanted this time alone. I meant to ask you to marry me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut why? You can\u2019t be\u2014\u201d She tried again. \u201cEvan, you don\u2019t seem to have those kind of feelings for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m very fond of you, Kate. We have interests in common, and we get on well. If I didn\u2019t think we could make a happy life together, I would never suggest it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut there\u2019s something else,\u201d she intuited. \u201cSome other reason you\u2019re proposing now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t insult you with a denial.\u201d He leaned toward her. \u201cKate, I\u2019ve told you there would be an inheritance.\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cBut I haven\u2019t told you the precise size of that inheritance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, what size is it?\u201d She scanned his worried expression. \u201cPrecisely?\u201d</p><p>He looked her in the eye. \u201cYou\u2019ll have everything, Kate. Everything. I\u2019ll keep Rook\u2019s Fell\u2014the one entailed property that comes with the marquessate. Aside from that, the entire Gramercy family fortune is yours. Eight properties. Several hundred thousand pounds.\u201d</p><p>Kate gripped the edge of the seat. \u201cBut . . . I don\u2019t want all that. What would I even do with such wealth? A fortune like that is a full-time occupation, and you\u2019re the one who has always managed everything.\u201d She blinked hard. \u201cWhat of Harry\u2019s income? Lark\u2019s dowry? Aunt Marmoset\u2019s living?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll yours as well. I set the money aside in trusts, but they\u2019ll no longer be valid. Legally, the money was never mine to give away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh dear. Oh, Evan.\u201d</p><p>He rubbed the bridge of his nose. \u201cSo now you understand, this is the quandary that\u2019s kept me up nights.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeething,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cYes, seething.\u201d He lowered his hand and gave her a bittersweet smile. \u201cI will no longer make pretensions otherwise. I have been exceedingly worried over the future of the family. Not for myself, but for my siblings. The Gramercys have always been a queer lot, but we\u2019ve been wealthy enough that we\u2019re forgiven our eccentricities.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that won\u2019t be the case anymore.\u201d</p><p>Kate was no solicitor, but she understood Evan\u2019s dilemma. If she married Thorne, the entire fortune would be out of Gramercy hands. Evan would have no means to protect and support his family. They would all be her dependents\u2014or if she married him, Thorne\u2019s.</p><p>That would be an awkward situation.</p><p>\u201cIf I\u2019d only known about you,\u201d he said, staring out the window. \u201cWe had other properties from my mother\u2019s side. Foreign land holdings, mostly. In India, the West Indies. But then Bennett went to view them, and he came back . . . changed. I sold all the land at a loss years ago, wanting nothing more to do with plantations or slaving. The land here in England was more than enough, I thought.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou thought right,\u201d Kate said. \u201cYou did right. And you needn\u2019t fear. I won\u2019t abandon you. We\u2019ll find some way. Can\u2019t I just refuse the inheritance, or give it all back?\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s not that easy, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if I went away?\u201d This might be the answer to both their problems. She could go to America with Thorne, and Evan would remain the head of the family. \u201cI could leave the country. Or stay here in Spindle Cove. No one needs to know I exist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will know you exist. We all know, and it wouldn\u2019t be right. Kate, I want to secure my siblings\u2019 future, but I refuse to destroy our souls in the process. We can\u2019t simply deny your existence. To do so would be to deny your parents\u2019 love for each other, to deny their love for you. You can\u2019t want that.\u201d</p><p>No. She supposed she didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cWe wouldn\u2019t want that, either,\u201d Evan went on. \u201cAnd what\u2019s more, Kate, the solicitors know about you. Legal proceedings have been set in motion. If you were to disappear now . . . we\u2019d have to wait seven years with everything tied up in court, and then petition to have you declared dead.\u201d He made a grimace. \u201cSo please don\u2019t think of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s just so unfair,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019ve been so generous and welcoming to me, and now you must pay this terrible price.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are the one who has suffered unjustly,\u201d he argued. \u201cNever think otherwise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you know all along? Even when you first came to find me, did you know that I could be taking the entire fortune?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI suspected.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you came to find me anyway. With no hesitation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course.\u201d His intelligent brow lifted. \u201cFamily above everything. That\u2019s the Gramercy way.\u201d</p><p>He was so very decent and good, and under different circumstances, she should have been overjoyed to marry a man like him. But she was in love with Samuel. She was committed to Samuel. She\u2019d been intimate with Samuel. There was no way she could marry Evan now.</p><p>He took her hand. \u201cKate, if you\u2019ll marry me, I swear\u2014I will devote everything to giving you the life you deserve. The life you always deserved. And together, we will help our family.\u201d He gave her a half-joking smile. \u201cIf you won\u2019t have me, I\u2019ll be forced to pursue some obnoxious heiress with social-climbing parents.\u201d</p><p>But would he be able to find social-climbing parents who\u2019d eagerly support unconventional Harry, or decrepit Aunt Marmoset, or Bennett, off wandering the Hindu Kush? And poor Lark, losing her dowry just months from her debut.</p><p>Kate cast a desperate glance out the carriage window as they pulled up in the Summerfield drive. This was intolerable. To have found her family after all this time, to feel so loved and accepted by them . . . only to destroy their lives and happiness?</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d he said, preparing to exit the carriage, \u201cwhich will it be? At midnight, will I be introducing you as Lady Kate? Or may I introduce you as the future Lady Gramercy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvan, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need some time,\u201d he finished for her. \u201cOf course, I understand. I\u2019ll come find you before the midnight set.\u201d</p><p>And then he was out of the carriage and extending his hand to help her alight, and there was no privacy to discuss it any longer. Before them, the golden candlelit splendor of the Summerfield great hall beckoned. They were being watched by many sets of curious eyes.</p><p>\u201cSmile,\u201d he whispered, offering his arm. \u201cAnd be happy. This is your night.\u201d</p><p>As she entered the Summerfield ballroom, Kate scanned every corner and alcove of the hall. Her heart skipped every time she caught a flash of red. There was one militiaman she was particularly hoping, against all odds, to see.</p><p>She didn\u2019t find him, but she found the next best thing.</p><p>\u201cKate!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s us. Over here.\u201d</p><p>She whirled on the heel of her slipper, heartened by the familiar voices.</p><p>\u201cSusanna. Minerva. Oh, it\u2019s so good to see you.\u201d She embraced her friends warmly. Until Susanna\u2019s arms went around her, Kate couldn\u2019t have realized how desperately she needed a hug.</p><p>She could use some friendly advice, as well.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d no idea you\u2019d be here.\u201d She looked from one friend to the other\u2014Susanna, now Lady Rycliff, with her flame-red hair and freckles, and Minerva, the darker, bespectacled middle Highwood sister, recently married to Lord Payne.</p><p>\u201cWe all came down from London together,\u201d Susanna said. \u201cPapa was growing desperate to see his first grandchild.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Minerva added, \u201cAnd I knew I couldn\u2019t deprive Mama of her new son-in-law much longer, either. But in truth, it was our husbands who suggested we make the trip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTruly?\u201d Kate asked, incredulous. \u201cLord Rycliff and Lord Payne wanted to come? To Spindle Cove?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think they secretly miss this place, though they\u2019d never let on,\u201d Minerva said.</p> <p>Susanna winced a little.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Kate asked.</p><p>\u201cOh, nothing. I\u2019m just a bit achy, that\u2019s all. When the baby hasn\u2019t nursed for a few hours, it\u2019s uncomfortable.\u201d She looked to the ceiling. \u201cPerhaps I\u2019ll just slip upstairs to the nursery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan we come with you?\u201d Kate asked. \u201cI\u2019m dying to meet little Victoria myself, and . . . and I\u2019d very much appreciate the chance to talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s so beautiful,\u201d Kate whispered. \u201cHer hair is just like yours.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis is the only time she\u2019s quiet,\u201d Susanna said, gazing down at her suckling babe. \u201cUnless her father is holding her. Bram has some secret method of calming her that he refuses to share, the impossible man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so glad Colin\u2019s happy to wait on the childbearing score,\u201d Minerva said. \u201cHe\u2019s recently taken control of his estate. I\u2019ve so many scholarly works in progress. We\u2019re not at all ready for parenthood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, Min, how . . .\u201d Kate lowered her voice. \u201cHow can you be sure you won\u2019t conceive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, one can never be completely sure. But we take precautions. Colin\u2019s had some experience on the male side of things. You see, when a man spends his seed\u2014\u201d</p><p>Susanna gave her friend a look. \u201cMin,\u201d she whispered, \u201cperhaps we could save the specifics for another occasion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Minerva said apologetically. \u201cYou know me, I speak of natural topics at all manner of inappropriate times. Anyhow, Kate\u2014there are ways. Susanna\u2019s given me some herbs. Those help, too.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow clever of you both,\u201d Kate said.</p><p>She was glad for Samuel\u2019s caution the other night. It wasn\u2019t as though she disliked the idea of bearing his child. Nothing would make her happier, someday. Thinking of him as a father, cradling a tiny babe in the crook of his arm . . . it made her heart float. But with so much uncertainty now with the Gramercys, a pregnancy would be ill-timed.</p><p>Especially since the father of the child had disappeared.</p><p>\u201cKate, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d Susanna asked. \u201cYou look so troubled.\u201d</p><p>Kate paused, biting her lip. And then she took a deep breath and told them everything. All about the Gramercys. All about Thorne. The portrait, the melon, the snakebite, the inheritance, her night with Samuel, and Evan\u2019s proposal just now in the coach. Everything.</p><p>\u201cMy goodness, Kate,\u201d said Minerva, adjusting her spectacles. \u201cYou\u2019ve been busy.\u201d</p><p>Kate laughed at the absurdity of the statement, and it felt so good. This was what she\u2019d been needing\u2014her best, closest friends to listen and help her see everything clear. Susanna and Minerva would not be on Thorne\u2019s side, or the Gramercys\u2019 side.</p><p>They were on her side, unequivocally.</p> <p>\u201cI always knew that someday you\u2019d have your fairy tale,\u201d Susanna said. She called in the nursemaid and handed her the now-sleeping babe. \u201cI didn\u2019t predict this, of course. But we all adored you so. I knew you couldn\u2019t go unnoticed for long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never did go unnoticed,\u201d she said. \u201cNot really.\u201d</p><p>Samuel had noticed her, even that very first day in the Bull and Blossom, when she pulled her India shawl tight around her shoulders and turned the other way. He\u2019d always been looking out for her, asking nothing in return.</p><p>She cast a wistful glance at the darkened windowpane. Where was he now?</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what to do,\u201d she said. \u201cSamuel has vanished. The Gramercys are depending on me to save them all. Evan wants to know whether he can introduce me as Lady Kate or his soon-to-be Lady Gramercy. Meanwhile, I feel like a maid who pilfered her mistress\u2019s gown and stole into the ball. I don\u2019t know how I\u2019ll manage as a lady of any sort.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe same way we do,\u201d Minerva said. \u201cLook at Susanna and me. A year ago we were confirmed spinsters, never the belle of any ball. Now she is Lady Rycliff and I am Lady Payne. And we may be a bit awkward in the roles, but society will just have to struggle on despite it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll form our own club, Kate. The League of Unlikely Ladies.\u201d Susanna came to sit beside her. \u201cAs for what you should do . . . I\u2019m certain you already know, in your heart.\u201d</p><p>Of course she did. She loved Samuel and wanted nothing more than to be his wife. But if at all possible, she must find some way to help the Gramercys, too. They were her family, and she couldn\u2019t abandon them.</p><p>Minerva bent over and stared Kate in the bosom. \u201cI\u2019m admiring your pendant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know what sort of stone it is?\u201d Kate asked eagerly. \u201cI\u2019ve been wondering, but I\u2019d never seen its like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is an easy identification.\u201d After peering for a moment through her spectacles, Minerva released the teardrop-shaped stone. \u201cIt\u2019s called blue john. A form of fluorite. Quite a rare formation, only found in one small area of Derbyshire.\u201d</p><p>Kate clutched the pendant. \u201cIt was my mother\u2019s. She was from Derbyshire. She must have worn it always to remind herself of home.\u201d</p><p>How strange, then, that Elinor would have left it behind at Ambervale. Perhaps she\u2019d worried it would be lost during travel.</p><p>Minerva patted her arm. \u201cKate, I don\u2019t think you should worry overmuch. I have a strong suspicion your problems will work themselves out, and in hasty fashion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope you\u2019re right,\u201d Kate said. But despite her natural bent for optimism, this was one situation where she had a difficult time seeing an easy solution.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Susanna said, standing. \u201cI suppose we\u2019ve hidden ourselves up here as long as we dare. We had better go find our men before they create some mischief.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is a Summerfield ball,\u201d Kate agreed. \u201cThere seems to be something in the ratafia that makes male passions . . . explosive.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Two</p><p>Thorne\u2019s patience was nearing the end of its fuse.</p><p>Tucked away in the Egyptian-themed library of Sir Lewis Finch, he paced a small square of carpet, patrolling back and forth. His new boots pinched his feet. His starched cuffs chafed his wrists. Sheer agony was his companion.</p><p>And the agony had a name: Colin Sandhurst, Viscount Payne.</p><p>\u201cLet me give you a bit of advice,\u201d Payne said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want any more of your advice. Not on this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to admit you want it,\u201d Payne replied smoothly. \u201cBut I shall talk to myself, and you can merely be nearby, not listening.\u201d</p><p>Thorne rolled his eyes. He\u2019d spent the better part of the past several days \u201cnearby, not listening\u201d to Payne. Through shopping trips, appointments with solicitors, lessons on . . . an activity Thorne hated to acknowledge in thought, let alone speak aloud.</p><p>Payne tossed back a swallow of his drink and propped one boot on an inscribed sarcophagus. \u201cBefore I found Minerva, I\u2019d passed nights with more than my share of women.\u201d</p><p>Thorne groaned. Don\u2019t. Just don\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve passed time with duchesses and farm girls, and it doesn\u2019t matter whether their skirts are silk or homespun. Once you get them bare\u2014\u201d</p><p>Thorne drew up short. \u201cIf you start in on rivers of silk and alabaster orbs, I will have to hit you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEasy, Cinderella,\u201d Payne said, holding up his hands. \u201cAll I meant to say is this. Beneath the trappings, all women crave the same thing.\u201d</p><p>Thorne made a fist and clenched it until his knuckles cracked.</p><p>\u201cWhat? I\u2019m speaking of tenderness.\u201d</p><p>From his chair behind the desk, Bram rubbed his temple. \u201cI think what my cousin is trying to say is, just because she\u2019s Lady Katherine Gramercy now and not Miss Taylor, that doesn\u2019t mean that she\u2019s changed inside.\u201d</p><p>Thorne resumed pacing. Perhaps he shouldn\u2019t have told them everything. He\u2019d needed their help, but he hated that they knew he needed it. Feeling weak wasn\u2019t something he was accustomed to, and he didn\u2019t like it. His impulse was to crash through the doors, find his Katie, pick her up in his arms, and carry her away someplace warm and small and safe.</p><p>But he couldn\u2019t take her away. That was the whole point of tonight. She had a family now. Not only a family, but a place among the English peerage.</p><p>This new life of hers . . . it meant she could never be entirely his. No matter the promises she made about leaving everything behind and sailing with him for America, he knew it couldn\u2019t work that way. As a Gramercy, she was part of a family. As the daughter of a marquess, she would have obligations and duties here. As a lady, she would always be above him\u2014the reminder of it would sit before her name on every letter she received or penned.</p><p>He didn\u2019t want to share her. But he must, if he wanted to be a part of her new life. Most of all, he was utterly resolved: He would not bring shame to her, ever.</p><p>So tonight he was pacing the library carpet, waiting for his chance. He was hardly Cinderella, but at least he\u2019d wedged his scarred body and ashen soul into a smart new outfit.</p><p>From behind the desk, Bram regarded Thorne. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you went to my cousin.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t believe it, either.</p><p>\u201cIf you needed anything, Thorne, I would have helped. You need only have asked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re busy.\u201d</p><p>Payne smiled wryly. \u201cYes, and I was only on my honeymoon. I had nothing better to do than scrub up a noble savage, take him shopping, and teach him to dance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Bram looked at Thorne in astonishment. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Thorne turned away.</p><p>Bram\u2019s smug inquiries pursued him. \u201cYou danced? And Colin gave you lessons?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou act as though the pleasure should be mine,\u201d Payne said. \u201cIt was rather a trial on my part, I\u2019ll have you know. But thanks to my darling wife\u2019s influence, I\u2019m learning to embrace my academic duty. I\u2019ve long been a scholar of the female sex. Since I\u2019m now happily married and devoted to one particular woman, it would be miserly of me to hoard such accumulated knowledge for myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo doubt.\u201d Bram laughed. To Thorne, he said, \u201cGood God. If you put up with this for a week, you must really love that girl.\u201d</p><p>Payne resumed his suave, professorial demeanor. \u201cIt\u2019s like this, Thorne. If you mean to ask for a woman\u2019s heart, you have to be willing to take risks of your own. Real ones. Not just dancing lessons.\u201d</p><p>Thorne set his jaw. He\u2019d given up his home for Katie. He\u2019d spent years hungry in the countryside, then hungry in prison, then hungry and marching in the army. \u201cI\u2019ve sacrificed for her. I\u2019ve given her as much as a man like me can give.\u201d</p><p>Payne chuckled. \u201cYou may think so. But they want everything, man. You can empty your pockets and lay down your body, and they still won\u2019t be satisfied. Not until you serve up your heart, still beating.\u201d</p><p>Bram sighed. \u201cOnce again, I will translate for my cousin. Just tell Miss Taylor you love her. That\u2019s all they really want to hear.\u201d</p><p>Love. It all kept coming back to that word. It would be easy enough to tell Katie he loved her. Speaking the words wasn\u2019t any great task. But to tell her so in a way that made them both believe it . . . that was the challenge.</p><p>\u201cDid you want to practice again?\u201d Payne asked.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind taking the lady\u2019s part. I\u2019m secure enough in my masculinity.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI said no.\u201d</p><p>Payne straightened his cravat. \u201cReally, Thorne. I\u2019m only trying to help. \u2018No, thank you\u2019 might be more polite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEtiquette isn\u2019t my strong point.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, but that\u2019s why I\u2019m here, isn\u2019t it? It\u2019s why you came to me for help. If you mean to win that woman\u2014that lady\u2014and make her your wife, you\u2019ll have to make it your strong point. And quickly.\u201d</p><p>Thorne shushed him. The small orchestra had struck up a new tune, and he strained to hear.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the waltz,\u201d Payne confirmed. \u201cYou\u2019re on.\u201d</p><p>Bram clapped Thorne on the shoulder. \u201cGo to it, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo pressure,\u201d Payne said. \u201cIt\u2019s only your one chance at happiness, you know. It\u2019s only the rest of your life.\u201d</p> <p>Thorne cut him a glare as he shouldered open the door. \u201cNot helping.\u201d</p><p>As he made his way through the connecting door and down the short stretch of corridor to the ballroom, nerves danced in his gut. But once he spied her at the opposite end, all his anxiety disappeared\u2014replaced by awe.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t laid eyes on her in nearly a week.</p><p>And he\u2019d never seen her looking like this.</p><p>Good God, she was beautiful. She stood in profile to him, deep in conversation with Minerva Highwood, the new Lady Payne. He stopped in his paces a moment, just to drink in the sight of her. And to remember how to breathe.</p><p>She wore deep blue silk, the color of fathomless oceans and dark night skies. Set off by the lush fabric, her shoulders were smooth, pale perfection. Tiny brilliants spangled her dark, upswept hair, and satin gloves sheathed her arms to the elbow. He heard the sparkling melody of her laughter float high above the music.</p> <p>She was too elegant for him, too beautiful for words.</p><p>But he\u2019d come this far. He would dare to ask for her anyway.</p><p>He started to move. The crowd shifted around him. Across the hall, Katie shifted her weight and swept the room with an unfocused gaze. She looked right through him, with no hint of recognition\u2014then went back to her conversation.</p><p>He strode toward her, moving with purpose now.</p><p>When he\u2019d covered half the distance, her eyes darted to him again. Once, fleetingly. Then a second time, narrowing. As though she were trying to place him. The wrinkle of her brow was one of mild concern. He could almost hear her thoughts. Who was that hulking, overdressed brute across the ballroom, staring her down?</p><p>God. She didn\u2019t know him.</p><p>It\u2019s me, Katie. You know me.</p><p>Their gazes connected. He felt it in his bones, the moment recognition struck. That sweet jolt of affinity shot down his spine.</p> <p>Then a waltzing couple twirled between them, blocking his view.</p><p>Damn it.</p><p>Damn, damn, damn. He had to see her reaction. That was his entire purpose in coming here and making an entrance. How would she greet him? Would it happen this time, at long last?</p><p>By the time the waltzers passed, the whole crowd had shifted. He pushed his way through the throng, scanning for her. His heart pounded so fiercely, he thought it would burst.</p><p>\u201cSamuel!\u201d</p><p>He turned on his boot heel.</p><p>There she was, poised on tiptoe, her neck elongated like a swan\u2019s, the better to call over the crowd.</p><p>He changed course, veering for her. And stopped, two paces away.</p><p>Waiting, with his heart in his throat, to see if she\u2019d light up for him.</p><p>She didn\u2019t glow. Her eyes didn\u2019t twinkle. No small flame of joy flickered to life behind her expression.</p><p>No, this was so much better than that. It made everything worthwhile\u2014not just the past week, but the lifetime before it.</p><p>She went incandescent with the brilliance of a thousand fiery stars.</p><p>\u201cSamuel. It\u2019s you.\u201d</p><p>Kate struggled to compose herself. He had a lot of nerve, keeping her waiting all this time and then showing up looking like this. He was still his unbearably handsome self, only . . . he was more.</p><p>More, in every way.</p><p>She could have sworn his new, fashionable Hessians made him a full inch taller. The tight fit of his black tailcoat made his shoulders look a touch more broad. She couldn\u2019t begin to articulate what the clinging buff breeches did for his thighs, or she might suffer an attack of light-headedness.</p><p>His hair was clipped with precision, glossed with a touch of pomade. Even from an arm\u2019s length he smelled wonderful\u2014like leather and cologne and clean linen, blended with the essence of raw, manly strength.</p><p>Most of all, there was an air about him. It wasn\u2019t quite elegance or refinement, but perhaps . . . self-possession. Purpose. Oh, his face was still hard, and his eyes remained chips of ice. But beneath it all, there was fire.</p><p>\u201cMight I have this dance?\u201d he asked. So suavely. The velvet darkness of his voice sent a thrill coursing all the way to her toes.</p><p>\u201cI suppose you may.\u201d</p><p>What was this game they were playing? Were they supposed to pretend they didn\u2019t know one another? All she wanted to do was fly into his arms.</p><p>But she put her hand in his. As he led her to the dance floor, her heart fluttered.</p><p>They faced one another, and he fit his hand between her shoulder blades. The expression on his face was so stern.</p><p>\u201cYou look magnificent,\u201d she whispered. \u201cSo handsome.\u201d</p><p>She waited for him to compliment her gown or her hair, but she waited in vain. The expression on his face was both intent and somehow uncertain. What did it mean?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve missed you so much.\u201d</p><p>He swung her into the waltz. They moved through several bars of the dance, haltingly. He never said a word.</p><p>\u201cSamuel, are you . . . Have you changed your mind?\u201d</p><p>He blinked. \u201cAbout what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout me.\u201d</p><p>He frowned at her, as if chiding her for the question. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>She waited for further assurances. He didn\u2019t give them. Her heart began to pound. She didn\u2019t know what it was, but something was wrong.</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t want to be here,\u201d she said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to force you.\u201d</p><p>He made no reply. Except to curtly sigh with impatience and stare at the orchestra.</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t you speak to me? I\u2019ve been waiting for you all week. Hoping all night. I couldn\u2019t believe you would leave me feeling so abandoned, and now you\u2019re finally here\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been here for hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why did you take so long to come find me? Were you ashamed? Uncertain?\u201d Her voice broke. \u201cAt least look at me.\u201d</p><p>He came to a halt. \u201cBlast. I can\u2019t do this.\u201d He looked about the room, his eyes searching out every possible exit. \u201cWe need to talk somewhere, alone.\u201d</p><p>Kate struggled to keep her worst fears tightly leashed, but they had tenacity. And sharp teeth.</p><p>Perhaps her new identity as a lady was too much for him. Maybe he\u2019d decided he couldn\u2019t be part of her life.</p><p>\u201cThis way,\u201d he said.</p><p>She followed him out the nearest set of doors and down a long paneled corridor, until they passed into Sir Lewis\u2019s famed medieval hall, where the aging antiquarian\u2019s collection of arms and armor was most impressively displayed.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s quiet here,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd safe.\u201d</p><p>Kate supposed it was. On either side of the long, narrow hall a half-dozen suits of ancient armor stood sentry. Like an escort of Arthurian knights, solemnly standing guard on either side of a plush, rose-red carpet.</p><p>A pair of wall sconces at either end provided the hall\u2019s only illumination. Candlelight quietly gleamed off the polished suits of centuries-old armor, limning the edges of their swords and the points of their staves.</p><p>The setting was either wildly romantic or vaguely threatening.</p><p>Samuel motioned for her to sit on a bench nestled into an alcove. The cool stone beneath her thighs made her shiver.</p><p>He sat next to her. \u201cKatie, you have to let me explain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease do. If you\u2019ve been here at Summerfield for hours, why didn\u2019t you come to me at once? Why did you make me wait all night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want the truth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I can\u2019t dance. I only had time to learn the waltz. I couldn\u2019t come claim you for the gavotte or the sarabande. I had to stand in the library like a damned fool and wait for the orchestra to play the one dance I knew.\u201d</p><p>Her heart twisted in her chest. \u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I couldn\u2019t even manage it. For Christ\u2019s sake, it shouldn\u2019t be more difficult than marching, should it? Payne told me not to stare at my feet, but . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Samuel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you looked so lovely. Every thought went right out of my head.\u201d</p><p>Now everything made sense. This explained his stern, uncertain expression and his refusal to speak or look at her. He\u2019d been trying so hard to keep step with the dance, he hadn\u2019t been able to spare concentration for niceties.</p><p>And did he say Lord Payne had advised him? Samuel despised Lord Payne. But he\u2019d sought the man\u2019s help. He\u2019d asked for dancing lessons.</p><p>Heavens. He could have spelled out his love for her in fifty-foot letters, right on the hillside beside the Long Man of Wilmington, and it wouldn\u2019t have been any more obvious.</p><p>Those clear blue eyes sought hers, shining true through the dark. \u201cLook at me. This is who you\u2019ll be stuck with, Katie. A clumsy oaf who can\u2019t count to three in his head and tell you you\u2019re beautiful at the same time. What the hell are you doing with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in love with you, you foolish man. Falling deeper every moment.\u201d She let her brow fall to his chest and listened sharp for the deep, steady beat of his heart. \u201cI know you love me. You don\u2019t have to say it. I can feel it. I know.\u201d</p><p>He drew a ragged breath. \u201cKatie, you know the life I\u2019ve led. It\u2019s been brutish and bloody and cruel, and I don\u2019t know that I can ever give you the kind of tenderness you deserve. You tell me I love you . . . but I couldn\u2019t be sure. I didn\u2019t understand what the word even meant, or how a man like me could ever feel such a thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t need the words.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI brought some words anyhow.\u201d He stared into her eyes. His gaze was a breathtaking, penetrating blue. \u201c \u2018Love is composed of a single soul, inhabiting two bodies.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201cSamuel, that\u2019s . . .\u201d Her voice broke. \u201cThat\u2019s absolutely beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Aristotle. I did some reading.\u201d</p><p>Oh. He\u2019d done some reading. Kate\u2019s heart was doing some wrenching and aching.</p><p>\u201cI never thought Greek philosophy could make a damn bit of sense to me. And most of it didn\u2019t, but those words just seemed right. \u2018Love is composed of a single soul, inhabiting two bodies.\u2019 \u201d He took her by the shoulders, drawing her close. \u201cIt rang true for me, in a way nothing else did. Whatever soul I had, Katie, I think I placed it in your keeping twenty years ago. And now, it\u2019s as if . . . every time we kiss, you give a little piece of it back.\u201d</p><p>She nuzzled his smoothly shaven cheek, inhaling the rich fragrance of his skin. Shaving soap and his natural musk and just the slightest hint of cologne.</p><p>He raised his head. \u201cBut I don\u2019t want you giving anything up for me. I want you to have this life. This family. Your birthright. You are a lady, and I\u2019m no gentleman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d she protested, feeling a sudden stab of panic. \u201cIt will never matter. You\u2019re a good man. The best man I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need a husband who is a gentleman. One who understands your new life, and all its demands. A man who can be your partner in society and help manage your inheritance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t want any\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean to be that man, Katie. Or I mean to become him, as best I can.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her heart swelled in her chest. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe waltzing was only a part of it. I\u2019ve spent the past several days in London, with Lord Payne. He\u2019s arranged for me to have some instruction from his land stewards at Riverchase. I understand game and horses and the run of the earth, but I need to learn how to manage crops, handle tenants. I thought you might have some property come to you, and I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cEight,\u201d she said. \u201cEvan told me just today. I have eight properties, scattered all over England. I\u2019m terrified.\u201d</p><p>He swallowed hard. \u201cI suppose I\u2019d better learn fast.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI think we both had better.\u201d She tried to smile.</p><p>He pulled away, putting distance between them, and withdrew something from his pocket, wrapped in a bit of black velvet. As he unfolded the small square of fabric, his fingers were unsteady. Finally, his thumb and forefinger closed on a slender edge of metal and he shook his treasure loose from one last fold of velvet.</p><p>He held it out to her. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what to choose for you, but I didn\u2019t want another man choosing for you, either. So I just looked through the trays until I saw one that looked fine enough for your finger.\u201d</p><p>She looked down at the gold band in his hand, embedded with small round diamonds. In the center was mounted a square-cut, faceted stone in the palest shade of pink.</p><p>\u201cWill it do?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>\u201cOh, Samuel. It\u2019s too much. This must have cost a fortune.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a fortune.\u201d His mouth pulled to the side in a self-effacing way. \u201cJust most of what I had left to my name, after the commission and this.\u201d He indicated his new coat and boots.</p><p>\u201cThe commission?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA captaincy. Rycliff\u2019s arranged for me to purchase one. He offered to pay for it himself, but I couldn\u2019t accept that. Katie, I\u2019ll give you everything I can\u2014all that I am, and all I possess\u2014but you must take me at my own worth.\u201d</p><p>Kate found herself without words. His own worth? This man was priceless.</p><p>If she\u2019d tried, she could not have written a more perfect ending to this evening. They would be married and stay in England. She would be able to live with Samuel and help her new family.</p> <p>He went down on one knee before her. The ring glittered on his palm. His face was grim with uncertainty. \u201cWill you wear it? Will you marry me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Yes, of course.\u201d She tugged off her gloves. \u201cPut it on for me, please. My fingers will tremble.\u201d</p><p>His hands were none too steady, either. But he took her hand and slid the gold band over her finger.</p><p>\u201cIt fits perfectly,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cAnd it looks almost deserving of you.\u201d He took her hand in both of his and stroked it gently. \u201cI\u2019ve only ever seen one proper wedding. What\u2019s that word, in the vows . . . to cherish? I will cherish you, Katie. Every day of my life. You\u2019re the most precious thing I\u2019ve ever held.\u201d</p><p>He brought her hand to his lips and kissed it. \u201cI will cherish every inch of you.\u201d</p><p>With tender, careful brushes of his lips, he kissed each of her fingers. He turned her hand palm up and placed a warm, open-mouthed kiss to the center. His lips brushed the pulse at her wrist, then worked slowly higher. By the time he progressed halfway up her forearm, she was trembling with pleasure and a lifetime of need.</p><p>\u201cSamuel? If you wanted to stop cherishing and start ravishing . . . I\u2019d be most amenable.\u201d</p> <p>He froze, lips pressed to her skin. \u201cAfter the wedding,\u201d he told the inside of her elbow.</p><p>She reached for him, putting her fingers under his smooth-shaven jaw and pulling his gaze to hers. \u201cI\u2019d prefer now.\u201d</p><p>She bent at the waist, catching his stunned, parted lips in a kiss. But she couldn\u2019t get close enough this way. So she slid from the bench and joined him on the carpet, twining her fingers into his freshly clipped hair as she kissed him deep.</p><p>He moaned with pleasure, and she slid her hands beneath the lapels of his coat, running her palms over the cool silk of his waistcoat. She found the closures in front. Such tiny buttons for such a large, powerful man. How did he ever manage them?</p><p>But they were no trouble for her fingers. She dispatched them with all the ease of a nursery rhyme. One, two, three . . . four.</p><p>Then she divided the sides of his waistcoat and placed her hands flat on his shirtfront, rubbing the crisp linen between her palms and his hardened, muscled chest. His heartbeat thudded against her palm, and she pressed her hand there, holding it close.</p><p>When they\u2019d been together the first time, there was something he\u2019d held back. Tonight, she needed to know he could give her everything. That here, in this hall lined with suits of armor, he\u2019d lain down all his own shields. She wanted . . . she wanted something that sounded pagan and savage. To hold his heart\u2014his warm, beating, pure and good heart\u2014in her hands.</p><p>He dropped his head, nuzzling her throat and slipping his tongue into the valley between her breasts.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t stop,\u201d she begged.</p><p>It was the wrong thing to say. He stopped and lifted his head.</p><p>\u201cWe should go back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she insisted, pressing her body to his. \u201cNot yet. Please.\u201d</p><p>Kate\u2019s own brazenness shocked even her. He\u2019d given her such lovely words, but she needed to feel the strength and purpose behind them. \u201cI want you so badly, Samuel. I want you to make love to me.\u201d</p><p>After a thoughtful moment, he placed a hand to her cheek. He tilted her face to receive his kiss. \u201cThat I can do.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her sweetly, once.</p><p>That was all the sweetness he had left. The second kiss was deep, demanding, thorough, and wild. Their tongues clashed and dueled as they fought to get closer.</p><p>While Thorne explored her mouth, he laid her back on the plush velvet carpeting and worked his hand under her skirts. They were on the floor, in the middle of Sir Lewis Finch\u2019s medieval hall, while a ball went on mere steps away.</p><p>The wise man would have hurried, or put a stop to this entirely. But he meant to take his time. This wasn\u2019t a hasty, scandalous tryst.</p><p>This was making love.</p><p>As he lifted her blue silk skirts, he took care to arrange the folds carefully so they wouldn\u2019t wrinkle any more than necessary. He bunched the petticoats strategically, baring her legs.</p><p>Thank God. She wore no drawers.</p><p>He needn\u2019t have removed her stockings, but he couldn\u2019t resist. The garters taunted him with neat ribbon bows.</p><p>He undid them with his teeth. After easing one silk stocking down her smooth, taut thigh and shapely calf, he was filled with sorrow to reach her neatly turned toes. Then his spirits were buoyed when he realized he could immediately repeat the experience with her other leg.</p><p>Once he had the second bared, he placed a kiss to the tender arch of her foot. He worked his way upward, ignoring her little twitches and protestations when he licked the inside of her knee or the slope of her inner thigh. He had some tickling to repay.</p><p>By the time he reached the cleft of her sex, she was writhing, eager for his kiss. Her folds glistened in the dim light. He loved knowing anticipation worked just as well as application. He rewarded her patience with a single, lazy, savoring pass of his tongue. She whimpered, arching in a plea for more.</p><p>He sat back on his haunches, hurriedly unbuttoning his trouser falls while he drank in the view of her pale, sprawled legs and the dark triangle of curls guarding her sex. There was something unspeakably arousing about this perspective. From her waist up she was poised, elegant, perfect. A lady. From the waist down she was nothing but pure, natural woman.</p><p>And she belonged to him. All of her.</p><p>He freed his erection, already rock-hard and pulsing.</p><p>She bent one leg at the knee, opening herself in invitation.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t refuse.</p><p>With care not to crush her skirts, he settled into the cradle of her thighs and positioned himself at her warm, wet entrance. He told himself to go slow, to not hurt her. But she tilted her hips, and he slid straight in.</p><p>Sweet mercy.</p><p>She was tight, yes. But not guarded or clenching in pain. She was perfect, and he fitted himself deep, sinking in all the way to the root. The soft welcome he found made him want to never leave.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she sighed.</p><p>He began to thrust slowly, steadily\u2014knowing that this was a race more easily won at a walk than a gallop. Drawing on all the self-control he possessed, he kept his pace unhurried, reveling in each easy glide, every silken inch.</p><p>Beneath him, she sighed and moaned, climbing closer and closer to release.</p><p>All too soon, Thorne felt himself approaching that dangerous edge. Slipping closer and closer to the unknown. If he fell over the brink, he wasn\u2019t sure what he\u2019d do.</p><p>Panic built in his chest. He should withdraw. He should protect her.</p><p>She seemed to sense his struggle. One of her warm, slender legs wrapped over his.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t leave me,\u201d she said. \u201cI want all of you. Everything you have to give.\u201d</p><p>Her words spurred him faster. Soon his hips were bucking with force, slapping against her thighs. The edge was near, and he raced toward it\u2014for good or ill, determined not to hold anything back.</p><p>She cried out and clung to his neck, arching her back in the throes of bliss. He felt the sharp bite against his nape. Not her fingernails, no. His ring, on her finger. A razor edge of bliss.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t last long now. The climax built in his loins and the base of his spine. Pleasure surged through his veins as he pumped hard and fast. He was wild to get closer, deeper. So deep, where it would be safe.</p><p>He forced himself to keep his eyes open, focused on her face. She would be his anchor if he found himself flung somewhere else.</p><p>\u201cGod, Katie. Hold on to me. Tight.\u201d</p><p>She held him, and the climax seized him, too. And he did find himself flung somewhere else. But it wasn\u2019t a land of shadows and smoke and explosion. Instead, he found a landscape of luminous skin and perfect pink lips and eyes so wide and so deep, they were seas of love. Here, he was reasonably certain hearts had wings. He intended to make many return trips.</p><p>Above all, it was beautiful. It was so beautiful, he could have wept.</p><p>He wouldn\u2019t have wept alone. As he slowed to a stop, a few tears glistened on her cheeks. He didn\u2019t worry about them, just kissed them away.</p><p>\u201cI love you, too,\u201d she said.</p><p>He lifted his head, surprised. \u201cDid I say it?\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cOnly several times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Then good.\u201d He kissed her again. \u201cI felt it enough for a thousand.\u201d</p><p>She stroked his hair, and he allowed himself a few moments\u2019 rest, nestled close to her bosom. If he had to be a broken, fragmented man, liable to slip into strange territories from time to time and be unaware of his actions\u2014he was glad to know he could do something good and loving on occasion.</p><p>\u201cWe should be getting back,\u201d he said, withdrawing from her embrace. \u201cI should speak with Drewe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKate?\u201d The deep, masculine voice came from the corridor. \u201cKate, are you down here?\u201d</p><p>Damn, damn, damn. Speak of the devil.</p><p>Thorne didn\u2019t panic. He rose and pulled Katie to her feet, moments before Drewe entered the room. As she stood, her carefully draped skirts fell naturally to the floor. No one would have known what had just gone on beneath them.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re in here, Drewe,\u201d Thorne called, trying to make his voice nonchalant.</p><p>\u201cWe?\u201d Drewe asked, striding into the room.</p><p>Thorne tried to be calm as he buttoned his falls. He knew the shadows would hide him for a few moments, as Drewe\u2019s eyes adjusted to the candlelight.</p><p>Just one more closure . . .</p><p>Then the coat buttons. Drewe was halfway to them now.</p><p>One more button. There.</p><p>\u201cDrewe.\u201d Thorne bowed. \u201cI was looking for you.\u201d</p><p>The marquess eyed him warily. \u201cKate, what\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, nothing. Nothing.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her protests were a little too strenuous for Thorne\u2019s liking, and Drewe was definitely suspicious. But he was reasonably certain they\u2019d managed to cover any real evidence.</p><p>That was, until Drewe\u2019s gaze fell to the two discarded stockings on the floor.</p><p>Damn.</p> <p>In the dark, his eyes flashed with unholy rage. \u201cYou rutting bastard,\u201d he seethed. \u201cI\u2019ll kill you.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Three</p><p>\u201cEvan, stop. Stop!\u201d Kate grabbed her cousin by the sleeve, wrenching him away. \u201cDon\u2019t do this. I\u2019ll explain. We\u2019re going to be married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarried?\u201d Evan\u2019s face twisted. \u201cTo him?\u201d</p><p>Thorne approached and placed one hand at the small of her back. \u201cI meant to come speak with you, Drewe. I meant to ask for her hand properly, but\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut what? You decided to defile her in a darkened room first? You bastard.\u201d</p><p>Evan lunged at him again, and Kate jumped between the two men just in time.</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d she called out. \u201cWe need to talk. All of us. But we\u2019ll never manage it if you\u2019re leaping at each other\u2019s throats.\u201d</p><p>She put one hand on either man\u2019s chest and pushed them toward opposite sides of the hall. \u201cJust give me a few moments.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well,\u201d Evan said. He added ominously, \u201cA few moments.\u201d</p><p>More voices reached them from the shadowed corridor. \u201cKate? Evan? Is everything all right?\u201d</p> <p>Harry, Lark, and Aunt Marmoset stepped into the candlelit entryway of the long narrow hall.</p><p>\u201cThe dancing\u2019s been paused for supper. We were hoping to make the announcement soon,\u201d Harry said, eyeing the men\u2019s furious expressions and Kate\u2019s disheveled gown. \u201cBut it looks as though you\u2019re . . . busy. Corporal Thorne, what a surprise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll just pop back inside,\u201d Lark offered.</p><p>Aunt Marmoset smiled. \u201cI hear there\u2019s a fresh bowl of punch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, stay,\u201d Kate said. \u201cPlease, stay. All three of you. This concerns you, too.\u201d She laid a hand flat on her belly, just as she did when she needed support to sing loud and clear. \u201cCorporal Thorne and I have reconciled. We\u2019re going to be married.\u201d</p><p>From his side of the hall, Evan fumed. \u201cKate, you can\u2019t. Do you have any idea who this man is? I had him investigated, you know. Back when we first arrived in Spindle Cove.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou had him investigated?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I had your welfare in mind. And that of the family. I wanted to know just whom you were marrying. And it\u2019s a damned fortunate thing I made those inquiries, too. This man is a convicted felon, Kate. He spent years in prison.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know that. He\u2019s told me everything. He was convicted of poaching as a youth, but he was released to join the army.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere he committed even more villainous offenses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that, too. But then he mended his ways and served honorably under Lord Rycliff for years. Like I said, he\u2019s told me everything.\u201d She turned to Thorne. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to do so much speaking for you. Would you rather defend yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter what I say,\u201d Thorne replied. \u201cHe\u2019ll see in me what he wants to see. My lord, I don\u2019t much care what you think of me, so long as Katie\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow dare you.\u201d A wash of red pushed from the line of Evan\u2019s crisp cravat all the way to his hairline. \u201cHow dare you speak of her in such a familiar fashion? She is Lady Katherine to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe may speak to me however he wishes,\u201d Kate said, taken aback by the fury in Evan\u2019s voice. \u201cWe are in love. We\u2019re going to marry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKate, you haven\u2019t even heard the worst of it yet. Do you know where this man came from? His mother was a harlot in some disgusting, low-class bawdy house in Sou\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn Southwark,\u201d Kate finished. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe told you that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I know because I remember it. Because I lived there, too.\u201d</p><p>The ladies gasped. Kate hated to shock them by bringing it up at this time and place, but could such an announcement ever come as anything less than shocking?</p><p>Evan said, \u201cYou lived together? The two of you, in a . . . ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were children, both of us. It seems that\u2019s where Elinor ended, after leaving Ambervale. She lived under a new name, Ellie Rose, and yes\u2014I spent my first four years in a bawdy house. All my memories of it were hazy until just the last few days, but with Samuel\u2019s help I\u2019ve pieced them together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s lying,\u201d Evan said, eyeing Samuel with a dangerous glare. \u201cHe\u2019s convinced you of something that isn\u2019t true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish for my mother\u2019s sake that it weren\u2019t true. But I remember it, Evan. I can\u2019t imagine why she ended there. Perhaps she was too afraid to seek help. Perhaps, as a farmer\u2019s daughter, she felt unequal to the task of living as a lady.\u201d On that score, Kate could sympathize.</p><p>She approached her cousin with caution. \u201cPlease don\u2019t worry about the family. We\u2019ll find some way. I\u2019ll . . . I\u2019ll simply sign everything over to you before the wedding. All the properties, all the money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike the devil you will,\u201d Thorne said. \u201cYour inheritance is your birthright, Katie. You grew up alone, with nothing. You deserve this now. That\u2019s why I came here tonight. I won\u2019t let you give it up. Not for me, and most definitely not for a puling reptile like him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I won\u2019t let a convicted felon destroy what remains of my family\u2019s name,\u201d Evan interjected. \u201cIf you care for her at all, why would you connect her with that place again? Marry her, and the truth will come out. All England will know her as the marquess\u2019s daughter who was raised in a whorehouse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care,\u201d Kate said. \u201cI don\u2019t care about idle gossip, and neither does Samuel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I care,\u201d Evan said. \u201cI shall have no choice but to care. To have any hope of salvaging Lark\u2019s prospects, I would have to sever all acquaintance with you both. Publicly and completely. There would be no more outings or balls. No family holidays at Easter and Christmas.\u201d His voice lowered to a hoarse rasp. \u201cKate, we would be forced to cut you in the street. It would eviscerate me, no question. But I would do it, to protect my siblings.\u201d</p><p>Kate knew he would. He\u2019d do anything for them. Her stomach knotted. \u201cBut you\u2019ve already told me I can\u2019t simply disappear. Even if I don\u2019t marry Samuel, I\u2019ll be the subject of public scrutiny. I don\u2019t see how the revelation can be avoided.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do. You\u2019ll marry me, and we\u2019ll conceal all this ugliness from public view.\u201d</p><p>Samuel swore. \u201cWhat the hell is this? She\u2019s not marrying you.\u201d</p><p>Evan ignored him and spoke directly to Kate. \u201cIf we marry, there will be no need for any court proceedings. Anything that\u2019s yours would legally become mine once we wed. No property needs to change hands. The Drewe title and Gramercy fortune will remain united. Then we can avoid all court inquiries and scandal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Evan . . .\u201d She tried to put the words kindly. \u201cYou and I don\u2019t love each other. Not that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove.\u201d Evan snorted. \u201cLove is a fierce and intoxicating thing, but I will tell you from bitter experience, it cannot balance the loss of fortune, reputation, and family. On this, Kate, I suspect your own parents would agree.\u201d</p><p>For the first time, her cousin\u2019s words gave Kate pause.</p><p>And Evan knew it.</p><p>\u201cSimon and Elinor were in love,\u201d he said softly. \u201cPassionate, desperate love. They scorned the rules of Society and disobeyed the wishes of their families to be together. Look how their story ended.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt hasn\u2019t ended yet,\u201d Samuel said. \u201cBut I\u2019ll tell you how it will end. With their daughter being rightfully restored as Lady Katherine Gramercy, heiress to property and fortune.\u201d</p><p>Evan spoke only to her, levelly and forcefully. \u201cKate, think of the family.\u201d</p><p>Samuel tightened his arm about her middle. \u201cIf there\u2019s any tarnish on the Gramercy name, then be a gentleman, Drewe, and own it. You, or someone in your family, threw her mother to the streets. This convicted felon did what he could to save her from that. And I\u2019ll protect her to the grave now. If you ever\u2014ever\u2014try to shame her for what she could not help, with the aim of keeping your own life gilded and comfortable . . . ? You will answer to me, and there will be blood.\u201d</p><p>Evan lunged in anger.</p><p>\u201cStop this!\u201d Kate cried. \u201cStop this, please.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t know what to say or do. They were both misunderstanding each other\u2019s intentions so badly, and so willfully. Neither man was interested in hearing reason. They just wanted an excuse to hate each other, and she was it.</p><p>This was disaster in the making.</p><p>But there was one way she could end this entire argument. Much as it pained her to announce it to the group at large, she could see no alternative.</p><p>\u201cEvan,\u201d she said, \u201cI cannot marry you. Surely you must understand . . . Samuel and I have been intimate. I must marry him.\u201d</p><p>Evan was silent for a torturous eternity, simply breathing in and out. \u201cNo. You don\u2019t need to marry him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut didn\u2019t you hear me? I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need to marry someone, yes.\u201d He raised his head and turned a murderous look on Samuel. \u201cThat someone will be decided at dawn.\u201d</p><p>In unison, Harry, Lark, and Aunt Marmoset groaned.</p><p>\u201cOh, Evan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSix? Truly? Six? Five was impressive, but six is the setup for a bad joke.\u201d</p><p>Evan quelled the objections with a look. \u201cBy the rules of dueling, Thorne\u2014I suspect you may not be so familiar with them, not being a gentleman\u2014I issued the challenge, so the choice of weapons is yours.\u201d</p><p>Kate was in turmoil. Weren\u2019t pistols the traditional choice? But Samuel\u2019s right hand was still weakened from the adder venom. His aim with a pistol would be disastrous. He wouldn\u2019t have a chance in hell.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s made her choice,\u201d Samuel said. \u201cThere\u2019s not going to be any duel.\u201d</p><p>Oh, thank heaven. Thank God.</p><p>Evan strode about the hall, swinging his arms. \u201cYou\u2019re right, Thorne. A duel isn\u2019t necessary.\u201d</p><p>Truly? He would give up on the idea that easily? To Kate, this turn of events seemed too good to be true.</p><p>It was.</p><p>Evan stopped before one of the mounted suits of armor and drew the sword from the grasp of the phantom knight\u2019s gauntlet. \u201cWhy wait for the morning, when we can settle this tonight?\u201d</p><p>Kate took back her prayers of thanksgiving and exchanged them for desperate pleas for deliverance.</p><p>Evan hefted the sword in his right hand, testing its balance. Though the weapon must have been centuries old, it was well cared for and polished to a mirror gleam.</p><p>He said, \u201cTakes you back to the era of true chivalry, doesn\u2019t it, Thorne? The days when a man cared something for a lady\u2019s reputation.\u201d</p><p>Harry spoke up. \u201cEvan, don\u2019t be ridiculous. Everyone here cares for Kate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want anyone fighting over me,\u201d Kate said. \u201cIt\u2019s not worth it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike hell it\u2019s not.\u201d Samuel turned to her. \u201cDon\u2019t ever say you\u2019re not worth it, Katie. You\u2019re worth epic battles. Entire wars.\u201d</p><p>Her heart pinched. \u201cSamuel . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Helen of Troy?\u201d She thought she saw him wink as he backed away, reaching for a sword to match Evan\u2019s.</p><p>After all this time . . . he would choose this moment to be charming.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d Lark soothed, drawing her aside. \u201cIt\u2019s all a bit of show to preserve honor and save face. You know how gentlemen are.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It didn\u2019t matter how gentlemen were. Samuel wasn\u2019t a gentleman. He was not the sort of man to take up arms in a show of honor. He would fight.</p><p>Worse, any given blow might send him to that other place\u2014that shadowy battlefield where he knew nothing but instinct and survival. Even if he wished to back down, he might be unable to do so in the heat of the struggle.</p><p>She saw no way this could end but badly\u2014bloodily\u2014for everyone concerned.</p> <p>\u201cStop this,\u201d she cried. \u201cBoth of you, please. Evan, you don\u2019t understand. Samuel cares for me. He sacrificed everything to save me from that awful place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe stole your virtue. He\u2019s a blackguard.\u201d</p><p>Kate wanted to argue that she\u2019d given herself willingly, and that the idea of a woman\u2019s virtue as a possession one man could steal from another was straight from the Dark Ages. But judging by the scene before her, accusations of medieval behavior would fall on deaf ears.</p><p>The men circled one another in the center of the hall, like two wild beasts bristling and snarling in warning. The bloodred carpet they trod upon did little to calm Kate\u2019s fears or ease the men\u2019s thirst for violence.</p><p>\u201cYou really want to do this, Thorne?\u201d Evan asked.</p> <p>\u201cNo. Because when I kill you, it will be sad for Katie and a mess for Sir Lewis\u2019s house staff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI spent four years fencing at Oxford.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChild\u2019s play,\u201d Samuel scoffed. \u201cI spent a decade fighting my way through enemy lines, using nothing but a bayonet.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m sure you did, Kate thought. But that was with a strong, healthy arm, not a grip weakened by snake venom.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t surrender her,\u201d Samuel said. \u201cYou can\u2019t convince me you\u2019re the better man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well. Then I\u2019ll let my blade do the talking.\u201d</p> <p>Kate cringed as Evan swung his sword, but Thorne parried the blow capably. They clashed several times in quick succession. The ringing clangs of metal against metal shivered through her bones.</p><p>Just as suddenly, they broke apart and retreated, each breathing hard. The ritual of mutual, animalistic circling began again.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do this, Samuel,\u201d she pleaded. \u201cHe\u2019s only desperate to save the family. It\u2019s his passion. He wants so much to take care of his siblings and for Lark to have\u2014\u201d</p><p>Samuel laughed bitterly. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing noble in this. Can\u2019t you see he\u2019s had this planned? He\u2019s been maneuvering you into marrying him all along. That\u2019s why he hasn\u2019t let you out of his sight since they arrived in Spindle Cove. He cares, all right. He cares about the money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you don\u2019t?\u201d Evan stopped circling and leveled his sword at Samuel. \u201cThose American ambitions disappeared rather quickly once you learned of her inheritance. You want her money so badly, you\u2019re willing to drag her name through the gutter to get it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe gutter you left her in.\u201d Holding his blade pointed at Evan\u2019s chest, Thorne looked around the room, from one Gramercy to the next. \u201cI will never believe that no one knew of her. That you could not have found her and saved her years of degradation and misery. You\u2019re either liars or fools.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSamuel, look sharp!\u201d</p><p>Evan took advantage of his opponent\u2019s distraction and made a slicing blow that caught Samuel\u2019s sword and sent it spiraling away, into the darkest corner of the room. But before Evan could even demand his surrender, Samuel shifted his weight back and made a full-force kick at Evan\u2019s wrist. Evan cried out in pain and dropped his sword. Rather than reach for it, Samuel kicked the weapon out of reach.</p> <p>Both men were disarmed.</p><p>\u201cOh, thank heaven,\u201d Kate whispered. \u201cMaybe now it will be over.\u201d</p><p>Harry shook her head. \u201cYou don\u2019t know my brother very well.\u201d</p><p>Evan turned to the next suit of armor in the row. This one held not a sword, but a shield and a long, slender javelin. He wrenched both shield and weapon from the pedestal. \u201cAlways fancied a go at this.\u201d</p><p>Across the hall, Thorne turned to the armored figure\u2019s counterpart and began to do the same.</p><p>Once they were identically armed, the men backed toward opposite ends of the hall, as if preparing for a joust.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt you\u2019re a lady now,\u201d Harriet said to Kate. \u201cThey\u2019ve organized a full tournament for your affections.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is ridiculous!\u201d Kate cried. \u201cThe midsummer fair was over weeks ago. What\u2019s next, squaring off with crossbows?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t give them any more ideas,\u201d Lark whispered.</p><p>\u201cOn three, Thorne,\u201d Evan called, raising his shield with his left hand and balancing the javelin with his right. He planted his boots firmly in the plush red carpet. \u201cThree . . . two . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Kate plucked her discarded stockings from the floor and dashed into the center of the hall, waving them like white, streaming banners of surrender. \u201cStop!\u201d</p><p>The men stopped.</p><p>Everything stopped. Suddenly, the hall was completely, unearthly quiet. Because from the ballroom, they heard music. Not orchestral music. Just the gentle strains of the pianoforte and a familiar voice, lifted in song.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Kate gasped, recognizing the tune. \u201cIt\u2019s Miss Elliott. At last, the brave dear. She\u2019s finally performing for her friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMozart,\u201d Evan said, recognizing the aria. \u201cExcellent choice, Kate. It suits her voice very well. Do you attend the opera frequently, Thorne?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Samuel replied tightly.</p><p>Without taking his eyes from his opponent, Evan spoke to Kate. \u201cDo you see? I will be good for you. I can give you not only the protection you need, but the companionship you deserve. We converse on politics and poetry, play brilliant duets.\u201d He waved his javelin at Thorne. \u201cHe might make your blood pound with illicit thrills, but he can\u2019t give you those things.\u201d</p><p>Kate slid her gaze to Samuel, worried. She knew Evan\u2019s words poked at his deepest feelings of unworthiness.</p><p>\u201cWhat can you possibly offer her?\u201d Evan demanded, as Miss Elliott\u2019s voice soared to operatic heights. \u201cYou\u2019ve no breeding. No education. Not even an honorable trade. You can\u2019t provide her with a home befitting a lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Samuel\u2019s expression hardened to that veneer of impenetrable stone.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re beneath her,\u201d Evan said, \u201cin every possible way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that, too.\u201d</p><p>Don\u2019t agree with him, Kate shouted in her mind. Don\u2019t ever believe it.</p><p>Evan sneered. \u201cThen how can you dare to ask for her hand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I love her,\u201d Samuel replied in a low, quiet voice. \u201cI have more love and devotion to give that woman than there is gold in England. And I have the manners not to prattle on while her pupil is singing.\u201d He made a menacing thrust with his javelin. \u201cShut it, or I\u2019ll skewer you.\u201d</p><p>After that, every soul in the room remained quiet and still until Miss Elliott sang her last, sweetly pure note. Kate\u2019s chest swelled with pride in her pupil and happiness for her friend.</p><p>Best of all, she had hope for the men\u2019s reconciliation.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she told the men, alternating her gaze from one end of the hall to the other. \u201cI know you understand what that meant to me. How hard Miss Elliott worked.\u201d</p><p>She let her arms drop to her sides and retreated to the border of the hall, leaving them to regard one another. Surely now they must comprehend\u2014no matter their differences as men, they both wanted what was best for her.</p><p>\u201cNow,\u201d Kate asked, \u201ccan we put away Sir Lewis\u2019s artifacts and discuss this like rational people?\u201d</p><p>Apparently not.</p><p>\u201cOne,\u201d Evan said.</p><p>The two men rushed at each other and collided in the center of the hall with an ugly crunch. The impact of javelins on shields sent them bouncing back, repulsed by the force of the impact. No one had been seriously hurt\u2014which pleased Kate, but evidently frustrated the men. They threw their javelins aside.</p><p>Evan reached for a battle-axe next, but in pulling it down from its wall rack, he misjudged the weight. The horrific weapon crashed to the floor, narrowing missing his foot and sinking two inches into the parquet.</p><p>By now Lark, Harriet, and Aunt Marmoset had joined in the shouting. \u201cStop! Both of you, stop! This is absurd.\u201d</p><p>But apparently there were yet loftier heights of male absurdity, just begging to be explored. Both of them had moved to some place beyond logic or reason, where only male pride and bloodlust held sway.</p><p>Thorne plucked a quarterstaff from a rack. It was a long, wooden pole weighted at either end for the purpose of inflicting bone-crushing blows.</p><p>For his part, Evan now reached for a morning star\u2014a heavy, spiked ball dangling at the end of a chain. He lifted the mace\u2019s handle with two hands and began to swing the menacing projectile in circles over his head. It made a fearful whistling noise as it picked up speed.</p><p>Everyone stared at it, rapt. The image was transfixing\u2014this instrument of death swinging faster and faster through its drunken orbit.</p><p>Evan\u2019s face told her even he was wary of what he\u2019d unleashed\u2014and uncertain how to control or stop it. He shot Kate a bewildered look. His eyes seem to say, Did I truly do this? Fight your betrothed with javelins and broadswords and then lift a bloody medieval mace over my head and start swinging it recklessly about in a room full of people?</p><p>Yes, Evan. You truly did.</p><p>She was glad he\u2019d finally come to his senses about this entire ridiculous battle.</p><p>But it was too late.</p><p>When he released that thing, it was going to fly fast and hard and wreak destruction in whatever direction it chose.</p><p>He said, in a very polite, calm, aristocratic voice, \u201cI can\u2019t hold it much longer, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKatie,\u201d Samuel barked. \u201cGet down.\u201d</p><p>All the ladies obeyed, diving into corners and taking cover under chairs. Kate ducked behind one of the discarded shields.</p><p>Thorne positioned himself as her human guard, lifting his quarterstaff in both hands and keeping his eye on the circling morning star. He looked like a cricketer, readying to bat\u2014and in essence, he was. Brave, stupid man.</p><p>\u201cSamuel, please! Just take cover!\u201d</p><p>With a savage shout, Evan released his grip on the mace. Kate ducked instinctively, unable to watch any further.</p><p>She both heard and felt the horrific crash. The initial impact was sharp and jolting, then almost musical, with the plink and crack of shattered glass.</p><p>The ball must have found a window and taken its bloodthirsty spikes soaring out into the garden. She could not speak for the hedgehogs, but with luck, it would seem no people had been hurt.</p><p>Drawn by the sound of calamity, guests began pouring in from the ballroom. Several carried candles or lamps.</p><p>\u201cWhat the devil\u2019s going on here?\u201d Lord Rycliff demanded.</p><p>A good question. Sucking in what seemed to be her first proper breath in an hour, Kate emerged and assessed the scene.</p><p>Evan remained standing, staring at the broken window. On his brow, blood oozed from a small razor-thin cut. Otherwise, he appeared unharmed.</p><p>As for Samuel . . .</p><p>Oh no. Her worst fears were realized. He wasn\u2019t physically harmed, but mentally . . . His eyes were dilated. his nostrils flared. He wasn\u2019t there. Just the same as with the melon siege, with one important difference.</p><p>This time he was armed.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Four</p><p>As Kate watched in horror, Samuel tightened his grip on the quarterstaff. He held it in two hands, braced across his chest, parallel to the floor.</p><p>An inhuman growl originated somewhere low in his gut, building strength as it clawed its way up through his chest.</p><p>He was going to charge Evan. And dazed, unarmed, unwitting Evan wouldn\u2019t have a chance.</p><p>\u201cSamuel, no!\u201d Kate dashed to intercept him, gripping the quarterstaff with both hands. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She made eye contact, hoping he\u2019d know her.</p><p>It\u2019s me. Come back.</p><p>Something flashed in his blue, unfocused gaze\u2014but what it was, she couldn\u2019t tell.</p> <p>The primal growl building deep in his chest now erupted from his throat. With a hoarse cry he lifted the quarterstaff, swinging both weapon and Kate with violent force, slamming her against the nearest wall.</p><p>Several ladies screamed.</p><p>Kate couldn\u2019t have screamed if she\u2019d tried. The impact knocked all air from her lungs. For a moment she floated loose in her own body\u2014robbed of sensation, of presence. She didn\u2019t feel any pain\u2014not yet. But she was certain it must be coming. An impact that strong must have broken her somewhere. Her spine, perhaps. A few ribs at the very least.</p><p>Then a dizzying rush of air entered her lungs. Her vision sharpened. She could breathe again, freely. The pain still hadn\u2019t arrived.</p><p>After a moment\u2019s reflection she understood why. He\u2019d slammed her not against the flat wall, but into a niche. As the quarterstaff was much wider than the recessed alcove, the beams on either side had taken the impact. She was unharmed.</p> <p>Unharmed, but shaken to her marrow.</p><p>If he\u2019d thrown her mere inches to either side, the full force of the quarterstaff would have crashed into her rib cage\u2014wounding her, surely. Killing her, possibly. But even in his darkest, most unthinking moment, Thorne had protected her from himself.</p><p>He\u2019d saved her. Now she had to return the favor.</p><p>She ignored the room packed with onlookers. She ignored the quarterstaff holding her pinned into the narrow niche. She kept her gaze locked with his. He was far away, and she had to bring him home.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d she said, speaking in the lowest, most soothing tone she could manage. \u201cSamuel, it\u2019s me. Katie. I\u2019m unharmed, and so are you. You were having a disagreement with Lord Drewe here at Summerfield. But it\u2019s over now. It\u2019s all over. There\u2019s no danger anymore.\u201d</p><p>She caught a flicker of awareness in his eyes. He drew a sharp breath.</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d she encouraged him. \u201cYes, that\u2019s it. Come back. Back to me. I love you.\u201d</p><p>If only she could touch him, it might make all the difference. But the quarterstaff kept them apart.</p><p>\u201cLet her go.\u201d Evan appeared at Samuel\u2019s side, pressing a blade to his throat and undoing all Kate\u2019s efforts of the past minute.</p><p>\u201cEvan, don\u2019t. Please. You\u2019ll make it worse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet the hell away from her,\u201d he growled at Thorne.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t understand, Evan. He didn\u2019t hurt me. He would never hurt me.\u201d She ignored her cousin then and focused on Thorne again, staring deeply into his eyes. \u201cSamuel, you must come back to me. Now. I need you here.\u201d</p><p>That did it.</p><p>His breathing steadied and recognition smoothed the creases in his brow. His eyes focused\u2014first on her face, then on the quarterstaff and their position against the wall.</p> <p>\u201cOh, Jesus,\u201d he breathed. Anguish tweaked his voice. \u201cKatie. What did I do to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d she assured him. \u201cNothing but remove me from the path of harm. I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBollocks,\u201d said Evan. \u201cYou could have killed her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t believe him,\u201d Kate said. \u201cI know the truth. You didn\u2019t hurt me at all. You\u2019d never hurt me.\u201d</p><p>Bram appeared then, reaching for the quarterstaff. \u201cStand down, Thorne. The fight\u2019s over.\u201d</p><p>Samuel nodded, still clutching the weapon tight. \u201cYes. It\u2019s all over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say that,\u201d Kate pleaded, pushing against the staff that kept her pinned. She needed to touch him, to hold him tight. If only she could get her arms around him, she could change his mind.</p><p>He seemed to know it, too.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t risk it,\u201d he whispered, holding her off. \u201cI can\u2019t. I love you too much. I thought I could make myself into the man you need\u2014a husband fit for a lady\u2014but . . .\u201d His face twisted as he swept a tormented gaze down and then up her body. \u201cLook at this. I don\u2019t belong in this world anymore. If I ever did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we\u2019ll go find another world,\u201d she said. \u201cTogether. I\u2019d give up everything for you.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, still holding her off. \u201cI can\u2019t let you do that. You say this life doesn\u2019t matter, but if I take you from it . . . you\u2019ll come to resent me, in time. I\u2019ll resent myself. Family means so much to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrewe,\u201d he said, still staring into Kate\u2019s eyes, \u201chow soon could you marry her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTomorrow,\u201d Evan answered.</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019ll protect her? Against rumor, scandal. Against those who would treat her ill or use her for her fortune.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSamuel, no.\u201d Kate fought back tears.</p><p>He nodded, still looking at her. \u201cThen do it. I\u2019ll leave England as soon as I know it\u2019s done. As soon as I know she\u2019s safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t marry him,\u201d Kate objected. \u201cAnd Samuel, you won\u2019t let it happen. You say this now, but do you mean for me to believe you\u2019ll sit in the pews of St. Ursula\u2019s tomorrow morning and watch, while I walk down the aisle with another man?\u201d</p><p>At that, he hesitated.</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t let it happen. I know you wouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>The argument seemed to make some inroads.</p><p>But unfortunately, they took him in the wrong direction.</p><p>\u201cBram,\u201d he called.</p><p>\u201cStill here,\u201d Lord Rycliff answered.</p><p>\u201cWhen you were shot in the knee, you made me swear, right there on the battlefield, that I wouldn\u2019t let them take your leg.\u201d Samuel spoke in a firm, controlled voice. \u201cNo matter what the surgeons said, no matter if you hovered at death\u2019s threshold. Even if you lost your mind with delirium. I swore I wouldn\u2019t let them amputate, and I didn\u2019t. I sat by your bedside with a pistol cocked, scaring off anyone with a saw. When they threatened me with court-martial, even when my own powers of reason argued against it . . . I stayed true to my word.\u201d</p><p>Bram nodded. \u201cYou did. I\u2019m forever in your debt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to repay me now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLock me in the village gaol. In irons, tonight. And no matter what happens\u2014even if I rage or plead\u2014give me your word right now that you won\u2019t release me until she\u2019s married. Swear it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThorne, I can\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>Samuel turned to him. \u201cDon\u2019t question. Don\u2019t look at anyone else. This is you and me, and a debt you owe. Just do as I ask, and swear it.\u201d</p><p>Lord Rycliff relented. \u201cVery well. You have my word. You can release her now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet the irons first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor goodness\u2019 sake, Samuel!\u201d Kate struggled again. \u201cWhat are the chances that a pair of irons are just hanging about?\u201d</p><p>She had forgotten to consider that in Sir Lewis Finch\u2019s house, the chances were apparently quite good. Someone produced a pair of iron cuffs, connected by a heavy chain.</p><p>Lord Rycliff opened one manacle and fitted it around Samuel\u2019s wrist.</p><p>Samuel stared deep into her eyes. \u201cThank you,\u201d he whispered. \u201cFor lighting up for me, just the once. That was worth everything.\u201d</p><p>Kate growled and kicked him in the shin\u2014not that her bare foot could do much damage. \u201cDon\u2019t pretend this is romantic, you stubborn, foolish man! If I didn\u2019t love you so much, I\u2019d vow to hate you forever.\u201d</p><p>In response, he pressed an infuriating kiss to her brow.</p><p>Once the other cuff was fastened, he let go of the quarterstaff and released her.</p><p>Then he walked away in chains.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t let it happen.\u201d</p><p>Lark stood in the center of the Queen\u2019s Ruby parlor, looking as firm-chinned and resolute as Kate had ever seen her.</p><p>\u201cKate,\u201d she said, \u201cI love you dearly, but if you try to marry my brother today, I will stand up in the middle of St. Ursula\u2019s and object.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChicken,\u201d Harry soothed, \u201cit\u2019s not yours to say. Evan and Kate are adults. Besides, the vicar will only be interested in your objection if it presents a legal impediment. There is none.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s an emotional impediment,\u201d Lark argued. \u201cKate can\u2019t marry Evan. She\u2019s in love with Corporal Thorne.\u201d</p><p>Kate squeezed her eyes shut. Of course she was in love with Thorne. If she weren\u2019t completely, eternally in love with him, she wouldn\u2019t feel so miserable sitting here this morning, discussing the possibility of marrying another man.</p><p>Her heart ached. Somewhere nearby, Samuel was in irons, locked up like an animal in a cage. He\u2019d spent the entire night in gaol.</p><p>She knew how he\u2019d suffered as a youth in prison. He should never have been subjected to confinement again, not even for one night. She was desperate to see him released, and he must have known she\u2019d feel this way. He was holding himself ransom, and the price he demanded was her wedding to another.</p><p>The stubborn, impossible man. And to believe common wisdom, women were the sex prone to dramatics?</p><p>Lark continued, \u201cWhat\u2019s more, Evan can\u2019t marry Kate. What about Claire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cClaire?\u201d Harry echoed. \u201cMy dear pigeon, Claire is several years in the grave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he loved her once. That\u2019s all I\u2019m saying. He might fall in love again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s hope not,\u201d Harry muttered.</p><p>Lark confronted her sister. Anger burned red on her cheeks. \u201cReally, Harriet. Our brother defended you when you broke three loveless engagements. He has supported you in your attachment to Ames. And this is how you repay him? By encouraging him to enter a marriage of convenience and hoping he never loves again?\u201d</p><p>As she absorbed Lark\u2019s censure, Harry\u2019s eyebrows rose. \u201cMy my, starling. You are growing up so fast.\u201d She drummed her fingers on the arm of her chair, then stood. \u201cVery well, I\u2019ll object, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour objections won\u2019t be necessary, I hope.\u201d Kate lifted Badger into her lap and drew him close. \u201cI\u2019ve no intention of marrying Evan, if it can possibly be helped. There must be some other way.\u201d</p><p>But even as she spoke the words, she doubted them. What other way could there be? All night long she\u2019d been thinking on the dilemma. She\u2019d exhausted all her powers of logic, imagination, and desperation, and still no solution had come to her.</p><p>\u201cHarry and I tried appealing to Evan,\u201d Lark said. \u201cIf he withdrew his offer to Kate, Corporal Thorne would have to back down. But he won\u2019t budge, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe feels too guilty,\u201d Harry said to Kate. \u201cHe\u2019s determined to give you the life you deserve, he says.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you all have given me so much already,\u201d she said. \u201cYou sought me out and welcomed me with open arms, even knowing it would change your lives in uncertain ways. Your kindness and faith in me has been remarkable, and I . . . I love you all for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, dear.\u201d Across the room, Aunt Marmoset pressed a hand to her chest. \u201cOh dear, oh dear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAunt Marmoset, what is it? Not your heart?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no. My conscience.\u201d The old woman looked to Kate with red, teary eyes. \u201cI must tell you the truth. It\u2019s my fault. It\u2019s all my fault that you were lost, dear. You mustn\u2019t feel beholden to us. I shouldn\u2019t blame you if you took all the family money and cast us out in the cold.\u201d</p><p>Kate shook her head, utterly confused. \u201cI don\u2019t understand. Cast you out in the cold? I\u2019d never do such a thing.\u201d</p><p>Lark patted her aunt\u2019s hand. \u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019s not as bad as all that, Aunt Marmoset.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it is. It is.\u201d The old woman accepted a handkerchief from Harry. \u201cAfter Simon died and your father inherited the title, I came to Rook\u2019s Fell. My sister needed me. You weren\u2019t even born yet, Lark. But Harry\u2014surely you must remember that time. How difficult it was.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Harry nodded. \u201cIt was the year Father\u2019s illness began. There were so many doctors, coming and going. I remember Mother\u2019s face was always grim.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour lives had changed so much, so swiftly. A new home, new titles, new responsibilities. I took over the running of the household. I oversaw the servants, attended to correspondence. I received any guests to the house . . .\u201d She paused meaningfully. \u201cSo I was there the day Simon\u2019s lover came back, babe in arms. And I sent her away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>At the words, Kate felt as though she\u2019d been dunked underwater. The air felt slow and thick around her. Cold. Her vision went wavy and a dull pulse throbbed in her ears.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t breathe.</p><p>\u201cYou sent her away?\u201d Lark\u2019s voice echoed from a great distance. \u201cAunt Marmoset. How could you do such a thing?\u201d</p><p>Kate forced herself to surface, to listen.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve no idea,\u201d Aunt Marmoset said. She wrung Harry\u2019s handkerchief. \u201cYou\u2019ve no idea how many charlatans crawl out of every ceiling crack after a marquess dies. Every day, I was chasing another away. Some came claiming his lordship owed back wages or gambling debts, others said that his lordship had promised them a living. More than one girl showed up with an infant in her arms. Liars, all. When Elinor arrived and claimed to have married him . . . I didn\u2019t believe her. A marquess, marry a tenant farmer\u2019s daughter? Preposterous. I never suspected, until the day we found the parish register, that the girl might have been telling the truth.\u201d</p> <p>Kate\u2019s fingers went to the pendant dangling at her breastbone. She skimmed her fingertips over the polished teardrop of stone, begging the glossy smoothness to calm her emotions. \u201cSo that\u2019s why you had her pendant. You took it from her. You had it all along.\u201d</p><p>Aunt Marmoset nodded. \u201cShe offered it as some sort of proof. I didn\u2019t see what meaning it should have, just a chip of stone. I did save it, however, in case she came back. But she never did. She never went to the solicitors. She disappeared.\u201d</p><p>Lark paced the room, clearly struggling to contain her emotions. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell us the truth weeks ago?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was ashamed,\u201d the old woman said. \u201cAnd what was done was done. I didn\u2019t see how it could do any good to relate the story now. We all agreed to make it right for Kate. We were going to welcome her to the family, give her all she was due. But then last night, when you told us about the bawdy house . . .\u201d Aunt Marmoset\u2019s tears renewed. \u201cOh, it was my fault. I was so sharp with the girl. When she asked me where she should go or how she should live, I . . . I told her she wouldn\u2019t get a penny from us, and she should go live like the slattern she was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no.\u201d Kate covered her mouth with her hand. \u201cYou didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Kate stared at Aunt Marmoset, uncertain what to say or do. In the past weeks, she\u2019d come to think of this woman as . . . as the closest thing to a mother she would likely ever know. And now to learn she\u2019d been turned away, even as an infant.</p> <p>For a moment she was back in Miss Paringham\u2019s sitting room, swallowing dishwater tea and dodging blows from a cane. No one wanted you then. Who on earth do you think will want you now?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d Aunt Marmoset said. \u201cI know you may never forgive me, and I\u2019ll understand if you don\u2019t. But I\u2019m so fond of you, dear.\u201d She sniffed. \u201cI truly am. I love you like one of my own. If I\u2019d only known that my moment of peevishness would have such dire consequences . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t know,\u201d Kate found herself saying. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t have known. I don\u2019t blame you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head honestly. \u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Miss Paringham\u2019s scornful words that day hadn\u2019t altered the course of her life. She doubted a few moments\u2019 ugliness from Aunt Marmoset had been enough to determine her mother\u2019s entire future. For Elinor to grow so desperate, more than one door must have been closed in her face. Or perhaps she\u2019d simply been unwilling to live by others\u2019 rules. Kate would never know.</p><p>Aunt Marmoset clasped Kate\u2019s hand. \u201cDo you know how she responded that day, when I turned her away?\u201d</p><p>Kate shook her head. \u201cTell me, please. I want to know everything.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe lifted her chin, bade me a good day. And she walked away, smiling. She kept her dignity, even after I\u2019d lost mine.\u201d The older woman\u2019s papery hand squeezed Kate\u2019s. \u201cYou have so much of your mother\u2019s fire.\u201d</p><p>Your mother\u2019s fire.</p><p>At last, Kate had a name for that small flame warming her heart. She did have something of her mother. She\u2019d carried it inside her all along, and it was more precious than a memory of her face or a verse her mother might have sung. She had the courage to smile in the face of cruelty and indifference\u2014to clutch her dignity tight when she had nothing else. That inner fire was how she\u2019d survived.</p><p>She would find an answer to this situation, and it would not involve marrying anyone. Anyone other than Samuel, that was.</p><p>\u201cShould we tell Evan this?\u201d she asked. \u201cPerhaps he\u2019d feel less obligated to marry me if he knew that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLess obligated?\u201d Harry cried. \u201cSurely you know him better than that, Kate. If Evan hears of this, he\u2019ll have us scraping your shoes in penance. He\u2019ll dress Lark in sackcloth and ashes for her debut. He will certainly not feel less obligated.\u201d</p><p>Kate chewed her lip, knowing Harry was right.</p><p>She did have one last source of hope, however. Susanna. Perhaps Susanna could make Lord Rycliff see sense and release Samuel from the gaol.</p><p>Just then, Susanna and Minerva entered through the parlor door. Badger scampered to the floor as Kate stood to welcome them.</p><p>Susanna wasted no time on pleasantries. \u201cIt\u2019s no good, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t be moved?\u201d Kate asked, deflating back into her chair. \u201cOh no.\u201d</p><p>Susanna shook her head with so much agitation, her freckles blurred. \u201cWhat good is a \u2018code of honor\u2019 if it flies in the face of all common sense? Bram insists that he\u2019s bound to do as Thorne asks, even if he personally disagrees. He won\u2019t hear any argument. It\u2019s all wrapped up in pride and brotherhood and his wounded leg. I tell you, whenever that dratted leg is concerned, Bram\u2019s impervious to reason. If the man ever had a sensible bone in his body, it must have been his right kneecap.\u201d</p><p>She sat down next to Kate. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. I tried my best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you did.\u201d</p><p>Minerva added, \u201cI considered asking Colin speak to him, as a last resort. But I worried it might work against us.\u201d</p><p>Kate tried to smile. \u201cThank you for the thought.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSurely one of them can be worn down, over the course of days,\u201d Susanna said. \u201cThis can\u2019t last forever.\u201d</p><p>But even if it lasted days, it would be too much. No one could understand just what it meant for Samuel to be confined. Here was a man who\u2019d etched the date of his release on his own arm, working carefully despite the teeth-gritting pain, because he knew he was in danger of losing all hope and forfeiting his last shred of humanity. Accepting chains must be torture for him.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll find another way,\u201d Susanna said. She looked around the parlor at Lark, Harry, Aunt Marmoset, Minerva . . . finally coming back to Kate. \u201cThis is Spindle Cove. Here we have six intelligent, resourceful, strong-willed women in one room. We will not be thwarted by a few unreasonable men and their silly toy-soldier games.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Minerva said. \u201cLet\u2019s go through all the alternatives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t run away,\u201d Kate said, ticking them off on her fingers. \u201cMarrying Evan is out of the question, as is marrying anyone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know!\u201d Lark said. \u201cKate, you could take religious vows, so you\u2019re forbidden to marry anyone.\u201d</p><p>Aunt Marmoset coughed on her spice drop. \u201cA Gramercy woman, sent to a nunnery? That would be unspeakably cruel\u2014to the abbess, most of all.\u201d</p><p>Harry wagged a finger, eyes keen. \u201cWait a moment. Perhaps she could marry Evan just for a few minutes, and then apply for a dissolution or annulment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t do that,\u201d Kate said. \u201cI did think of it, but the vicar told me annulments aren\u2019t easy to obtain. Plus, it would be dishonest. Evan\u2019s been so good to me\u2014I couldn\u2019t lie to his face that way, reciting vows I\u2019ve no intention to keep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSusanna had the right idea,\u201d Minerva declared. She adjusted her spectacles. \u201cIn this village, we beat the men at their own games. If they want to play soldiers, we\u2019ll assemble our own army of ladies. We\u2019ll have at them with bows, pistols, rifles\u2014even a trebuchet, if Sir Lewis will lend it\u2014and stage a jailbreak by force.\u201d</p><p>Aunt Marmoset perked up. \u201cMy dear, I like the way you think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no,\u201d Kate said. \u201cThat\u2019s certainly an . . . exciting . . . idea, Min. But we can\u2019t. There\u2019d be too much chance of someone getting hurt, and the last thing Samuel needs is another siege.\u201d</p><p>His unpredictable reaction to blasts was at the very heart of the problem.</p><p>\u201cBesides, even if we were to break him out of the gaol, that wouldn\u2019t change his mind. We\u2019d just be back where we were last night.\u201d</p><p>Kate believed, with all her heart, that she and Samuel could build a happy life together. But when he\u2019d made that bargain with Evan last night, he revealed his own doubts. He\u2019d passed her into someone else\u2019s keeping, the same way he\u2019d left her at Margate two decades ago. He doubted his own worth. And he didn\u2019t believe her when she said she\u2019d give up everything for him. She had run out of ways to convince him with words.</p><p>And there was still the problem of public scandal. She couldn\u2019t adopt the family name, then turn around and drag it straight through the seediest lanes of Southwark. Even after Aunt Marmoset\u2019s confessions, she wouldn\u2019t wish that on any of the Gramercys\u2014and she didn\u2019t want that cloud hanging over a marriage to Samuel.</p><p>In a nervous gesture, she twisted the ring on her finger, turning the pale pink stone this way and that to catch golden flashes of sun. So beautiful. She couldn\u2019t imagine ever removing it. Samuel had chosen it especially for her.</p><p>The stone had inner fire. So did she.</p><p>\u201cWell, we must do something,\u201d Minerva said. \u201cPrint pamphlets. Stage a hunger strike in the green. Go without our corsets until someone relents. This is Spindle Cove. Heaven forbid we let etiquette and convention carry the day. Just look at your dog. Even he agrees with me.\u201d</p><p>Kate looked down at Badger, who was happily gnawing his way through yet another copy of Mrs. Worthington\u2019s Wisdom for Young Ladies.</p><p>She bent and scratched him behind one funny, half-cocked ear and whispered, \u201cThis is all your fault, you know.\u201d</p><p>If not for Badger, she might never have pulled the truth from Samuel after the adder bite. She might never have come to know his softer side, and grown to love him for it. Melons would have far less meaning in her life.</p><p>In her mind, the wisp of an idea began to coalesce. Maybe . . . just maybe . . . Badger could be the key to this problem, too.</p><p>\u201cI think I may know just what to do,\u201d she said, growing excited as she looked around the room at her family and friends. \u201cBut I\u2019ll need help getting dressed.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Five</p><p>So this was Spindle Cove\u2019s excuse for a gaol.</p><p>Thorne had always wondered about this tiny building settled on the village green, not far from St. Ursula\u2019s. At first he\u2019d assumed it to be a well house for a spring that had long dried up. Then someone told him it used to be a baptistery for the original church.</p><p>At any rate, now it was the gaol. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The structure was small, round, and fashioned of windowless sandstone walls. It must have been built during the same era as the original Rycliff Castle\u2014in other words, forever ago. The wood ceiling, of course, had long since rotted away. Instead, a lattice of iron bars overhead kept prisoners confined while admitting fresh air and golden shafts of sunlight. Here and there a bit of moss or fern sprouted from a crack in the wall.</p><p>As with all things in this village, it was a little too quaint and charming. But it would be effective enough. The only break in the stone walls was the single forged metal door. The handiwork of Aaron Dawes, no doubt, and Thorne knew him to be a capable smith.</p><p>A heavy set of iron cuffs encircled his wrists, linked by a chain. The shackles were genuine, taken from Sir Lewis\u2019s collection. The only keys to both cell door and irons were in Bram\u2019s possession, and he\u2019d given his word.</p><p>Thorne was well and truly confined.</p> <p>The night hadn\u2019t been easy. Sitting chained in the dark . . . the silence poked at the wild, feral creature in him. But the restraints were good, and the walls were solid. Even if he went a bit mad and his resolve crumbled, he wouldn\u2019t be muscling his way out of this cell.</p><p>Which was fortunate, because if he did muscle his way out of the cell, taking on the guards would be no difficulty.</p><p>\u201cTell me again how is it that you two,\u201d he asked, \u201care the village gaolers?\u201d</p><p>Finn and Rufus Bright sat outside the cell\u2019s grated door with a pack of cards. They were twins, just nearing sixteen years old, and Thorne didn\u2019t like trusting them with a few hours\u2019 watch from the southeast turret of Rycliff Castle. He would have never set them to guard a dangerous criminal.</p><p>\u201cUsed to be our despicable sot of a father\u2019s duty,\u201d Rufus said. \u201cHe was the riding officer, before he switched sides of the law. Better money in smuggling, I suppose.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOnce he was gone,\u201d Finn said, \u201cthe task fell to Errol, as his eldest son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Errol\u2019s gone to Dover this week.\u201d Rufus split and shuffled the deck of cards. \u201cSo lucky you, you get us.\u201d</p><p>Lucky them, the youth surely meant. As much hell as Thorne had given Spindle Cove\u2019s youngest militiamen over the past year, he could only imagine they were enjoying this.</p><p>He heard Bram\u2019s voice. \u201cFinn, Rufus. I hope you\u2019re treating your prisoner well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Lord Rycliff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThorne?\u201d Bram peered through the door grate. \u201cNot yet wasted to bones, I gather.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot even close.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t think this isn\u2019t costing me. My wife is not pleased. And in case you\u2019re wondering, Miss Taylor\u2014Lady Kate, I suppose I should call her now\u2014is not pleased, either.\u201d</p><p>Thorne shrugged, indifferent.</p><p>Katie would be pleased, eventually. In time, she\u2019d see that this was best. Drewe could keep her safe and make her happy. She might have put on a brave face for him last night, told him she\u2019d leave behind everything to be with him\u2014but he knew her too well. She\u2019d longed for a family all her life, and he couldn\u2019t offer her anything to replace the Gramercys. And after last night, he knew he wasn\u2019t fit to be a lady\u2019s husband. He couldn\u2019t even keep her safe.</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s happening?\u201d Thorne asked. \u201cHave they seen the vicar for a license yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure,\u201d Bram said. \u201cBut she\u2019s just come through the front door of the Queen\u2019s Ruby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow does she look?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike she\u2019s about to be married.\u201d</p> <p>A black, bottomless pit opened up in Thorne\u2019s chest. He contemplated jumping into it.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s walking toward the church,\u201d Bram said. \u201cAll the rooming house ladies are following her. The Gramercys, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me what she\u2019s wearing.\u201d</p><p>Bram cut him an annoyed look. \u201cWhat do I look like to you? The Society columnist for the Prattler?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIvory frock. Two flounces and a great deal of lace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs she smiling?\u201d</p><p>Stupid question. Her smile wouldn\u2019t give any clues to her inner emotions. His Katie would be bravely smiling, even if she were walking to a guillotine.</p><p>\u201cHer hair,\u201d Thorne asked. \u201cHow is she wearing her hair?\u201d</p><p>Bram growled. \u201cGood God, man. I agreed to imprison you, not provide fashion reports.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer hair is up. You know how the ladies fix it\u2014mass of curls on top, wound with ribbons. Someone\u2019s stuck little blossoms between the curls. Don\u2019t bother asking me what kind of flower. I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever mind,\u201d Thorne scraped out. \u201cThat\u2019s enough.\u201d</p><p>He could see her in his mind\u2019s eye. Floating in a lacy cloud, tiny stars of jasmine studded in her dark, shining hair. So feminine and beautiful. If she\u2019d taken that much care with her appearance, she must be approaching her wedding with joy, not unwillingness or dread.</p><p>This was good, he told himself. The best possible outcome. He\u2019d worried she might hold out longer, strictly for the sake of being stubborn. But she must have seen the wisdom of it, once she had a few hours to reflect.</p><p>\u201cSusanna\u2019s with her,\u201d Bram said. \u201cI\u2019ll go inquire about their plans.\u201d</p><p>Restless, Thorne paced the small round cell. He lifted and spread his arms, pulling against the irons. Every primal instinct in his body wanted to break free. He\u2019d been prepared for this. This was why he\u2019d exacted the promise from Bram\u2014because when the time drew close, he knew only physical restraints could keep him from going after her.</p><p>Less than an hour now, surely, and it would be over. A matter of minutes, perhaps. When the church bells sounded, he\u2019d know it was done.</p><p>Instead of church bells, however, he heard a scraping of metal in the lock. In response, his body screamed, Make ready. Prepare to bolt.</p><p>He turned his back on the door, clenching his hands in fists. \u201cDevil take you, Bram. I told you not to open that door. You gave me your word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not releasing you,\u201d Bram called. \u201cI have a new prisoner, so you\u2019ll have to share the cell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA new prisoner?\u201d Thorne glared hard at the wall as the door clanged shut. \u201cI\u2019m the first prisoner this gaol has seen in years. Now two in one morning? What\u2019s the offense?\u201d</p><p>A soft, melodic voice answered him. \u201cPossession of a nuisance animal. Destruction of property.\u201d</p><p>No.</p><p>His iron chains seemed to double in weight, and they pulled directly on his heart. He turned.</p><p>Of course it was Katie.</p><p>She was here, in gaol with him. And Bram had no future in Society columns, because his account of her appearance was a mere ghost of the reality. A man might as well witness a comet streaking across the sky and describe it as something resembling a glowworm.</p><p>Her frock was gauzy\u2014sweet and revealing, all at once. Her hair was piled in dozens of intricate coils and twists, and her skin could have made angels weep. She was radiant.</p><p>A bit of fire flashed on her finger.</p><p>Sweet mercy. She was still wearing his ring.</p><p>Thorne pushed down the unwelcome surge of hope. His spirits shouldn\u2019t be buoyed by her presence. He shouldn\u2019t want her here at all. She didn\u2019t belong with him in a gaol of any sort\u2014not even a relatively quaint and charming one.</p><p>\u201cWell . . . ?\u201d She twisted, trying to catch his approval. \u201cI wanted to look my best for my wedding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be here,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat the hell sort of game is Bram playing at?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a game, unfortunately. I\u2019m under arrest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d</p><p>She pulled a thick black book from beneath her arm. \u201cYou were right. Letting Badger chew books was horrendous neglect on my part. Just look what the little beast has done.\u201d</p><p>Thorne couldn\u2019t risk drawing any closer to her, but he cocked his head and peered at the book. It was old, thick, bound with black leather . . . the gold leaf letters on the spine had been mostly destroyed, and most of the pages were shredded.</p><p>\u201cJesus,\u201d he breathed as realization dawned. \u201cTell me that\u2019s not what I think it is.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s the St. Mary of the Martyrs parish register.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot the one that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cContained my birth record. Yes. As well as the record of my parents\u2019 marriage.\u201d</p><p>Thorne couldn\u2019t believe this. \u201cYou allowed Badger to do that. On purpose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t really signify how and why it happened, does it? It\u2019s done.\u201d She squared her shoulders. \u201cThere\u2019s no paper record of Katherine Adele Gramercy. Not any longer.\u201d</p><p>The enormity of her words swamped his mind for a moment. He groped for some cord of reason or logic in the vast, nonsensical sea.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d he said. \u201cDestroying that book doesn\u2019t change who you are. You\u2019re still Lady Katherine Gramercy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I know who I am. And the Gramercys know it, too. But this mishap\u201d\u2014she held up the mangled register\u2014\u201cmakes my identity more difficult to prove. Evan says we\u2019ll need more witnesses before we even can approach the courts. It could take us years to have it all sorted out\u2014until well after Lark\u2019s season, I expect, and after Evan has a chance to arrange the finances and prepare me to inherit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re saying . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m saying I\u2019m free, for now, to do as I please.\u201d She approached him slowly. \u201cI\u2019m saying that someday I\u2019ll take the Gramercy name, legally and publicly. But in the meantime . . . I\u2019m hoping to share yours.\u201d Her voice went husky with emotion. \u201cI told you I\u2019d give up everything, Samuel. I can\u2019t fathom any life without you in it.\u201d</p><p>Thorne stared at her a moment. Then he went to the door of the cell. \u201cBram!\u201d He rattled the bars. \u201cBram, open this gate. Now.\u201d</p><p>Bram shook his head. \u201cNot a chance. I gave my word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo hell with your word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCurse me all you like. Rattle your cage as you please. You asked for this. You told me to keep you in gaol until Miss Taylor is married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, she can\u2019t get married while she\u2019s locked in here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn the contrary,\u201d she said. \u201cI believe I can.\u201d</p><p>He turned to find her gazing at him from beneath lowered lashes. A shy smile played about her lips.</p><p>\u201cNo. Don\u2019t think it. It\u2019s not going to happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor God\u2019s sake, I\u2019m not going to marry you in a gaol.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you rather we do it in the church?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He growled with frustration.</p><p>She tilted her head and regarded the sunlight streaming through the lattice of iron overhead. With her fingertips, she brushed a bit of ivy curling through the wall. \u201cAs prisons go, it\u2019s rather a romantic one. This is consecrated ground, so there\u2019s no difficulty on that score. We did have the banns read over the past few weeks. I\u2019m all dressed for the occasion, and you\u2019re still wearing that devastating suit. There\u2019s no impediment whatsoever.\u201d</p><p>No, no, no. This was not going to happen.</p><p>\u201cLord Rycliff, would you kindly send for the vicar?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d Thorne ordered. \u201cDon\u2019t. I won\u2019t go through with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you might say that.\u201d Katie dropped onto the room\u2019s only bench\u2014a simple wood plank. \u201cVery well.

So that\u2019s how she meant to play this. A war of wills.</p><p>Well, she\u2019d made the first fatal mistake in battle\u2014underestimating her opponent.</p><p>He leaned against the wall\u2014as far away from her as he could possibly put himself, in the small round cell.</p> <p>\u201cYou can\u2019t wear me down,\u201d he told her. \u201cYou cannot outlast me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll just see, won\u2019t we?\u201d She looked up at the shards of blue sky. \u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201d</p><p>Kate stayed true to her word. She didn\u2019t go anywhere.</p><p>Neither did he.</p><p>Of course, that didn\u2019t stop all Spindle Cove from coming to them. Over the course of the day it seemed every man, woman, and child in the village had a turn at peeking through the barred door and sharing words of encouragement or wisdom.</p> <p>The vicar came to offer counsel. The Gramercys came to call. Evan gave them his blessing, in case Samuel was waiting on it. Samuel made it clear he wasn\u2019t. Aunt Marmoset passed Kate spice drops through the bars.</p><p>Mrs. Highwood dropped by to suggest, in rather obvious fashion, that if Lord Drewe were still interested in getting married today, her Diana would be available.</p><p>At suppertime the Fosburys brought over some food. Kate offered Thorne a morsel of cake with her fingertips, but he warned her off with a stern glare.</p><p>She popped it in her own mouth instead, making a show of licking her fingers clean.</p><p>Don\u2019t think you\u2019re hiding that flash in your eye.</p><p>He was so stubborn. After the fight last night, he\u2019d thrown everything he had into building up one last fortified wall. But she would break it down. She\u2019d be damned if she\u2019d let him live in that cold, unfeeling prison he\u2019d constructed. Not now, when she knew how much love and goodness he had to give.</p> <p>And as Kate saw it, she was simply repaying a favor. All those years ago, he hadn\u2019t left her behind. His conscience hadn\u2019t let him leave the Hothouse without her. She would not leave this gaol without him.</p><p>By evening the whole village had gathered on the green. Kate and Samuel\u2019s standoff had turned into an impromptu festival. Ale was flowing freely, thanks to the Bull and Blossom. The militiamen organized a betting pool, placing wagers on how long the couple\u2019s imprisonment would last.</p><p>As the sun was setting, Badger came by. After depositing the gift of a limp church mouse just outside the door, he settled down in the grass and propped his head on his paws. Waiting. For hours. Until moonlight poured through the gaps overhead, like streams of quicksilver.</p><p>\u201cThink of the dog,\u201d she crooned. \u201cLook at him. You know he won\u2019t leave. He\u2019s going to sit there all night long. Out, exposed in the elements. Poor little pup, shivering in the cold.\u201d</p><p>Thorne made a dismissive noise. \u201cThis is all his doing.\u201d</p><p>Well, if concern for the dog wouldn\u2019t move him . . .</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m cold.\u201d She trembled for effect. \u201cWon\u2019t you come sit beside me, or are you just going to let me shiver, too?\u201d</p><p>At last she\u2019d found the argument to move him. With obvious reluctance, he came and sat beside her on the small, unyielding bench.</p> <p>She caught his wrists by the iron manacles, still chained together, and ducked her head to slip into the circle of his arms. He didn\u2019t fight her as she leaned against his chest, snuggling into his warmth. Pressing her ear to his shirt front, she found his heartbeat, strong and steady.</p><p>\u201cYou should go,\u201d he murmured. \u201cGo back to the Queen\u2019s Ruby and sleep in a warm bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA warm bed sounds lovely indeed. But only if you\u2019re in it. I\u2019ll wait to go home with you.\u201d</p><p>His hands flattened against her back, pulling her close. With his thumb, he stroked light caresses up and down her spine.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not leaving this place without you, Samuel. You didn\u2019t leave the Hothouse without me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was decades ago. We were children. There\u2019s nothing you owe me now.\u201d</p><p>She laughed wryly. \u201cOnly my life, health, happiness, and all the love in my heart.\u201d She slid her arms around his waist and looked up at him. \u201cThis isn\u2019t about the past, Samuel. It\u2019s about our future. I can\u2019t imagine being happy without you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKatie, you must know . . . it\u2019s only because of you that I can imagine being happy at all.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed back a lump of emotion. \u201cThen why are you resisting me now, after everything? Is it solely a matter of your bull-headed pride?\u201d</p><p>A half smile tugged at his lips. \u201cIf my \u2018bull-headed pride\u2019 is inconvenient, you should know that any pride I have is entirely your fault.\u201d</p><p>He closed his eyes and pressed his brow to hers.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all your fault.\u201d His voice was rough with emotion. \u201cYou listened when I needed it. Laughed when I needed that. You wouldn\u2019t go away, no matter how I scowled or raged. You loved me despite everything, and you made me look deep inside myself to find the strength to love you in return. I\u2019m a different man because of you.\u201d</p><p>Her heart swelled with joy.</p><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s not enough. I\u2019m not enough. What if I\u2019d hurt you last night? What if it happens again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t hurt me,\u201d she insisted. \u201cYou\u2019ve never hurt me. Even when you\u2019ve . . . slipped away in the heat of the moment, you\u2019ve always come back. You\u2019ve always kept me safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if . . .\u201d His voice trailed off. He cleared his throat and continued. \u201cThere\u2019d be children. I worry about children.\u201d</p><p>She hugged him tight. \u201cWe needn\u2019t be in any rush to start a family. You\u2019ve been one year back in England, after spending a decade on campaign. Give yourself some time to heal. You don\u2019t have to quarantine yourself to some uninhabited wilderness. The darkness will ebb eventually. When it does, I\u2019ll still be here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have to wait. You deserve someone who\u2019s not broken and brutish and . . .\u201d He exhaled roughly and gripped her tight. \u201cThere are better men, Katie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? I\u2019ve yet to meet one.\u201d</p><p>As she pressed her lips to his in a sweet, tender kiss, Kate could taste victory. The battle was nearly won.</p><p>She kissed the stubble-roughened edge of his jaw and made her voice a sultry whisper. \u201cYou know, we could be starting our honeymoon in less than an hour.\u201d</p><p>She twisted in his embrace just a little, letting her breasts rub against his chest. Teasing them both with the exquisite sensation. He moaned deep in his chest.</p><p>\u201cDo you know what Aunt Marmoset told me once? She compared you to a spice drop. Overpowering and hard at first, but all sweetness at the center. I\u2019ll admit, I\u2019ve been desperate to try an experiment.\u201d She gave him a teasing look. \u201cHow many times do you suppose I could lick you before you crack?\u201d</p><p>His every muscle tightened.</p><p>Smiling, she tucked her face into the curve of his neck and ran her tongue seductively over his skin. \u201cThere\u2019s one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKatie.\u201d The word was a low, throaty warning. It made her toes curl.</p><p>She nuzzled at the notch of his open shirt, pushing the fabric aside. The familiar musk of his skin stirred her in deep places.</p><p>With a teasing swirl of her tongue, she tasted the notch at the base of his throat. \u201cTwo . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cFinn,\u201d he called in a booming voice, lifting his head. \u201cSend for the vicar.\u201d</p><p>She pulled back, shocked. \u201cTwo? That\u2019s all, truly? Two? I\u2019m not sure whether to feel proud or disappointed.\u201d</p><p>Finn\u2019s face appeared in the grate. \u201cIf it\u2019s all the same to you, Corporal, do you mind holding off another half hour? I\u2019ve got midnight in the betting pool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I do mind. Fetch the vicar. Now.\u201d</p><p>Kate smiled. That was her future husband. When he finally made up his mind to do a thing, no one had better stand in his way. Thank God.</p><p>She smiled at Samuel in the dark. \u201cI hope the blossoms in my hair aren\u2019t too wilted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re perfect.\u201d His blue eyes roamed her face. \u201cYou\u2019re so beautiful, Katie. I haven\u2019t words.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t need words. What woman could want flattery, when she could have such pure, raw adoration? The pride and love in his gaze were palpable.</p><p>She stroked his unshaven jaw. \u201cYou are unbearably handsome, as always. I couldn\u2019t have dreamed a more perfect wedding. All our family and friends are already gathered outside. With a few candles, this funny little building will make a romantic chapel. But do you think Lord Rycliff would remove the irons before we say our vows? I\u2019ve heard men call matrimony \u2018getting shackled,\u2019 but this is a bit extreme.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExtreme? This from the woman who tied me to a bed.\u201d</p><p>She laughed softly, ducking her head to rest against his chest.</p><p>His chin settled, square and heavy, on her crown. In the silence, she could feel him thinking, pondering. When he spoke again, his voice had that thoughtful tone\u2014the one he could never seem to muster unless she\u2019d turned her gaze away. She kept her face buried in his sleeve, unwilling to break the spell.</p><p>\u201cBram should leave the irons,\u201d he said, \u201cuntil after. That\u2019s the oath he swore, and it seems fitting, somehow. For other men, marriage might be a trap or a prison. Not for me, Katie. Not for me.\u201d He pressed a kiss to the top of her head. \u201cWhen I marry you, I\u2019ll walk free.\u201d</p><p>Epilogue</p><p>Several years later</p><p>\u201cHush! That\u2019s his horse in the drive.\u201d</p><p>Kate took a surreptitious peek from behind the blue velvet drapes. There he came, riding his gelding up the white gravel lane at a brisk canter.</p><p>He dismounted in one swift, agile motion and handed the reins to a waiting groom. Through the lingering twilight, she could make out the familiar, stern lines of his face. With every passing year, life etched those lines a little deeper, engraving his handsomeness as a permanent, eternal thing. And each time she glimpsed him after a separation, her heart still gave a girlish hop in her chest.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s arrived.\u201d</p><p>With one hand, she gathered her heavy silk skirts and hastened down the corridor in a smooth, practiced glide. It wasn\u2019t seemly for a lady to run, but a lady with three children had to learn to move fast.</p><p>But she wasn\u2019t the first to meet him at the door. Badger, even old as he was, raced her to the entrance hall, nails clicking over the travertine. He nosed around his master\u2019s boots, sniffing out the story of his journey.</p><p>As she watched the two old friends reunite, Kate smiled. \u201cI see I\u2019m not the first to welcome you home.\u201d</p><p>With a final rub to the dog\u2019s ear, Samuel straightened. \u201cYou\u2019re the loveliest.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d brought in with him a gust of cool, autumnal air. The woodsy-scented wind clung to his greatcoat. He shrugged out of the garment and removed his gloves.</p><p>Kate took both, and in exchange pressed a kiss to his chilled, weathered cheek.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Williams?\u201d he asked, scanning the entryway for the butler.</p><p>Kate bit her lip. \u201cOh, he\u2019s . . . elsewhere.\u201d</p><p>She turned away and took her time hanging the coat, afraid to look at him, worried he\u2019d take the servants\u2019 absence as cause for suspicion. But his actions soon made it clear that he wasn\u2019t going to take the servants\u2019 absence as cause for suspicion. He meant to take it as an opportunity.</p><p>His hands framed her waist and he pulled her backward, drawing her tight against the firm expanse of his chest. With wind-chilled lips, he pressed kisses to her nape, sending ripples of cool and hot sensation down her spine.</p><p>Kate\u2019s eyelids fluttered with sensual abandon. She leaned against his chest and let her head roll to the side, offering more of herself to his kiss. Oh, how she\u2019d missed him.</p><p>\u201cHow was Wimbley Park?\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cA shambles.\u201d His teeth grazed her collarbone. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThe south fields again?\u201d</p><p>He growled an affirmative answer as he suckled her earlobe. \u201cFlooded ankle deep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, dear,\u201d she sighed. \u201cWhat about the drainage canals from last year? I thought\u2014\u201d</p><p>With a brisk push, he whirled her around to face him. The intensity in his eyes told her there\u2019d be no more talk of drainage canals just now.</p> <p>\u201cKatie.\u201d</p><p>He pulled her into a deep, stormy kiss. It told her everything another woman might wish to hear in words: I want you. I need you. I love you. The whole time we were apart, I thought of no one but you.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go upstairs.\u201d He fisted his hand in the back of her dress. \u201cIt\u2019s been an eternity.\u201d</p><p>She laughed against his lips. \u201cIt\u2019s been since Tuesday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I said. An eternity.\u201d He lifted her off her feet, as though he meant to simply toss her over his shoulder and haul her to the nearest mattress.</p> <p>She put her hands to his chest, stopping him. \u201cWe can\u2019t. Not right now.\u201d</p><p>The gravity in her expression didn\u2019t escape his notice. As he set her back on her toes, his brow furrowed with protective concern. \u201cWhat is it? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing, just . . .\u201d She swallowed hard. \u201cPlease don\u2019t be angry.\u201d</p><p>He took her by the shoulders. \u201cTell me. Now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. No one\u2019s ill or bleeding.\u201d Yet. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not really something I can explain. You\u2019ll have to see for yourself.\u201d</p><p>She took him by the hand and led him down the corridor. They walked slowly, quietly. He looked like a man marching toward his own funeral.</p> <p>\u201cI know how you hate these things,\u201d she said in an advance apology. \u201cBut the boys have been asking ever since last summer, and then Bryony seized the idea and wouldn\u2019t let go.\u201d They came to a stop just outside the drawing room.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too quiet,\u201d he suddenly noted. \u201cKatie, I don\u2019t like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t even know how it happened. It all spiraled out of control. But please know they had the best of intentions.\u201d</p><p>With a final, silent prayer for courage, Kate pushed open the double doors.</p><p>The drawing room erupted in color and noise.</p><p>\u201cSurprise!\u201d came the shout from several dozen of their closest family, servants, neighbors, and friends.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a party,\u201d she said. \u201cFor you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBloody hell.\u201d</p> <p>She cringed, watching him as he surveyed the room, filled to bursting with people. She\u2019d invited all the landowners from neighboring estates, and as many old friends as she could lure to Ambervale. Lord Rycliff and Lord Payne had brought their families. Calista and Parker were there, and Harry and Ames. As always, Evan greeted Samuel with a warm handshake. They\u2019d long been close friends.</p><p>\u201cThe children wanted to give you a birthday,\u201d she whispered, waving in Aunt Marmoset\u2019s direction. \u201cLast summer they were asking why we never celebrate it, and I didn\u2019t know what to say. I just plucked a date from the air, because I thought they\u2019d forget. But they didn\u2019t. They\u2019re stubborn, like their father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re clever,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s entirely your fault.\u201d</p><p>The children stood waiting in the center of the room. All three of them just bursting with self-satisfaction, knowing they\u2019d managed to rattle their formidable papa.</p><p>Bryony Claire, almost eight years old now.</p><p>Brent Christopher, a few years behind.</p><p>The smallest, Benjamin Charles, tottered across the room and attached himself to his papa\u2019s boot.</p><p>They\u2019d given all of them the initials B.C. With the first child, she\u2019d talked Samuel into it. He\u2019d suggested Simon or Elinor, for her parents, but she desperately wanted to give those letters inked beneath his heart a different meaning.</p><p>There was nothing of Bad Character in him now, if there ever had been. Only Doting Father, Fair-minded Employer, Loyal Friend . . . and Loving Husband. There wasn\u2019t a soul in this packed, unruly drawing room who didn\u2019t admire him.</p><p>But Kate didn\u2019t think anyone could love the man more than she.</p><p>She put a hand to her belly. If her suspicions of the past few queasy weeks proved true, they\u2019d soon be racking their brains for another set of names. As virile as the man seemed to be, she only hoped they could stop short of using Bathsheba Cabbagewort.</p><p>When she caught his gaze, his eyebrow arched into a chastening bow. But she\u2019d developed a talent for reading the subtle changes in his stony expression, and she could tell he wasn\u2019t angry.</p><p>He scooped little Benjamin off his feet and put him on his shoulders.</p><p>\u201cCome see your cake!\u201d Bryony tugged at her father\u2019s sleeve, pulling him toward a table laden with refreshments. In the center was a lumpy, slightly listing cake.</p><p>\u201cBryony iced it herself,\u201d Kate said.</p><p>Bryony went up on her toes with pride. \u201cThere\u2019s apricot preserves inside. We\u2019re going to sing for you later. Mama\u2019s taught us a new song.\u201d She twisted to and fro, swirling the skirts of her best gown. \u201cDo you like your party, Papa?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t like it.\u201d</p><p>Kate sent him a pleading look. Samuel didn\u2019t care for fuss\u2014much less cake\u2014but she hoped he could bear it for the one evening.</p><p>With a big, weathered hand, he cupped his daughter\u2019s chin and tilted her hopeful face to his. \u201cI love it. And I love you.\u201d </p> </body></html>"]
