A little after eight a.m. Jett Mayfield sat in his office overlooking the busy street below. The people and yellow taxis looked like ants in constant motion: always hurried, always tense. Like the city, Jett had once been abuzz with life\u2014or his former interpretation of it: live hard, work even harder. Until he met her. There was something about Brooke Stewart that had changed something inside him. It wasn\u2019t her beautiful chestnut eyes, nor the way she moved\u2014confident and yet reserved. She had talked to him on a deeper level, touching something he had thought untouchable. His initial intention had been different though. His agenda had been to make her fall for him, not through words, but through actions and sex, lots of the latter, because he had wanted something she had. Not for himself, but for the man and for the company to which he owed everything. But events took a couple of turns he didn\u2019t expect.</p><p>When the plan backfired, she disappeared.</p> <p>A shadow belonging to the past: gone but not forgotten.</p><p>For the past hour he had been staring at the cell phone, leaving him a tangled mess of fury and frustration. And more pain, which caused even more anger.</p><p>How stupid of her to go and not listen to him.</p><p>How stupid of her to turn off her phone so he couldn\u2019t reach her. And no matter how many times he called and how many messages he texted, Jett knew instinctively none reached her because if they had, she would feel his agony. She would feel just how important it was that she listen to what he had to say. It wasn\u2019t about his feelings. Fuck them. There was something else he needed to tell her; something that had rendered him sleepless at night, always worried for her, for them, for everything he believed in. And if his suspicions were true, then they needed each other just as much as they needed air to breathe.</p><p>\u201cMr. Mayfield\u2014Jett?\u201d Emma\u2019s head appeared in the doorway, jerking him out of his thoughts. He rewarded her with a frown. It wasn\u2019t like him to be rude, but the girl was a receptionist temporarily promoted as his personal assistant until he could find someone more suitable. As such, she wasn\u2019t yet accustomed to his preferences, which included not bothering him when he didn\u2019t want to be bothered.</p> <p>Wide-eyed like a deer caught in the headlights, she made no sign to get to the point and then fuck off again, leaving him to the darkness clouding his thoughts and the unusual soreness in his chest. He sighed impatiently. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>Emma seemed to remember how to speak again, but her wide eyes continued to mirror her insecurity. Jett liked his employees like that. Even if they thought he was a real son-of-a-bitch, they worked harder in order to please him.</p><p>\u201cSomeone\u2019s here to see you. I told him that you\u2019re busy and to arrange an appointment, but he won\u2019t go away. He\u2019s been here for half an hour.\u201d Emma\u2019s words rained down on him like a waterfall. All he caught was something about a guy being here to see him when he was indisposed.</p><p>\u201cTell him I\u2019m not available.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said it\u2019s important.\u201d</p><p>They all did. \u201cThen tell him you came to see me and I specifically told you I\u2019m not available.\u201d</p> <p>Emma\u2019s eyes widened just a little bit more, if that was even possible. Her frantic glance swept over him in fear. Obviously she wanted to keep her job, but the visitor seemed to frighten her even more than the possibility of displeasing Jett. He had two options: send the girl back out and risk her coming back, interrupting his obsessing about Brooke, or deal with the visitor. In the end, he decided option two was a tad more appealing.</p><p>\u201cShow him in.\u201d</p><p>Emma\u2019s expression relaxed instantly and she almost bounced out of his office. Glowering, Jett sat back in his chair and began to massage his temples to get rid of the increasing throbbing behind them. If he knew where Brooke was he wouldn\u2019t have to deal with this crap, and everything and everyone else could just go screw themselves. But as things stood, he had to maintain a fa\u00e7ade of normalcy before things blew completely out of proportion.</p><p>\u201cJett, my man.\u201d The familiar voice coming from the door jerked Jett back to reality. His attention snapped to his life-long friend, and some of the pressure weighing him down lifted. As usual, Kenny had managed to dodge any dress code and looked like he was about to step into a bar\u2014or jail\u2014rather than into the office of the realty business\u2019s hotshot of the year. Ripped jeans, short sleeved black tee, tattooed upper arms, and pierced eyebrow. Then again, that had been Jett\u2019s style, minus the piercing, for many years before he traded Kenny\u2019s wild lifestyle for his father\u2019s business. He still had the tattoos and the almost faded scars to prove it.</p><p>Jett closed the door, briefly registering the curious glances from his employees staring at both him and Kenny. They probably wondered what a man like Kenny was doing in one of the most successful companies in real estate, meeting with no other than the CEO. His employees didn\u2019t know the true Jett. No one did. If they did, they\u2019d run. But not Brooke. She had sensed his dark side and fallen in love with him nonetheless.</p><p>\u201cYou said you wanted to talk and it was urgent,\u201d Kenny began as soon as Jett had closed the shutters, leaving them sheltered from prying eyes.</p><p>\u201cI never said here.\u201d</p><p>Kenny shrugged and slumped into Jett\u2019s chair, propping his legs up on the polished oak desk, expertly ignoring the brown leather couches set up near the door, chosen for such an occasion. Jett\u2019s eyes narrowed but he didn\u2019t comment. \u201cI assumed you needed me and that you knew what you were doing,\u201d Kenny said. \u201cYou should\u2019ve specified a place. Not my fault you\u2019re being incautious, bro.\u201d</p> <p>Fuck it. He was right, of course, but the knowledge didn\u2019t stop Jett from glowering. To hide his irritation, he poured two glasses of double malt whiskey from the carafe on the coffee table and pushed one toward Kenny.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s barely morning,\u201d Kenny remarked, his fingers clutching at the glass with remarkable eagerness.</p><p>\u201cWho the fuck cares?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoint taken.\u201d</p><p>The whiskey tasted like expensive honey. A bit too sweet, with smoky and earthy undertones. He hated it, but it was the beverage that went down best with his clients and as such he always had a bottle available in his office. In his five years working for Mayfield Realties he had never touched it\u2014until today.</p><p>\u201cI need you to find someone because my private investigator\u2019s doing a shit job, and you\u2019re the only person I trust,\u201d Jett said, barely noticing his friend\u2019s half full glass.</p><p>Kenny didn\u2019t blink. \u201cHow urgent is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMajor deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA good hookup and can\u2019t find her number?\u201d Kenny grinned. He had no idea how close he was to the truth.</p><p>\u201cSomething like that,\u201d Jett remarked dryly as he retrieved a brown Manila envelope from his cabinet and tossed it to Kenny. \u201cHere\u2019s everything you need to know about her. And there\u2019s something else you need to get me.\u201d</p><p>Kenny\u2019s brow shot up as he flicked through the envelope and Brooke\u2019s details. His stare remained glued to Brooke\u2019s sleeping face with her wavy hair spread across the pillow like a halo. The picture had been taken with Jett\u2019s cellphone in his luxurious Manhattan apartment, on the last day they spent together. Jett had been sitting in the chair opposite from the four-poster bed, torn whether to spill his secret because she had opened up to him a few days previously, telling him about her painful past and why she didn\u2019t want a relationship. He felt he owed her the truth, but in the end he decided not to spoil the moment. It had been a big mistake because the next thing he knew they had a fight, and she was gone.</p><p>Missing without a trail. And he never had the opportunity to explain things.</p><p>\u201cHey, you still with me?\u201d Kenny said, observing Jett, assessing him. \u201cWhy did she leave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI dunno. Ask me something else!\u201d Jett grimaced and refilled their glasses. He swigged down the golden liquid in one gulp while Kenny stared at his, leaving it untouched this time. The whiskey burned down Jett\u2019s throat and probably messed with his brain. The beauty of oblivion. If he couldn\u2019t find her, then that was the state he was aiming for.</p><p>Kenny just shook his head and pointed at the now closed envelope, his look devoid of emotion. \u201cShe\u2019s pretty.\u201d He had always been good at not saying what he thought. It was the reason why he stayed out of trouble\u2014unlike Jett.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen did you last see her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwenty-four hours ago.\u201d</p><p>Kenny\u2019s pretend frown barely hid the beginning of a sarcastic grin. \u201cThat\u2019s a really long time.\u201d</p><p>Jett knew what he sounded like. Desperate. But it didn\u2019t matter.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious.\u201d His voice was cold. Menacing even. He didn\u2019t like it when people made fun of him. \u201cI need to find her. You have a problem with that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus. What happened to you, man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI fucking messed up. I fucked up. I wouldn\u2019t have called you if it wasn\u2019t important.\u201d</p><p>Kenny leaned back. He didn\u2019t seem in the least bothered by Jett\u2019s outburst\u2014they had remained friends through tougher shit than that.</p><p>\u201cDo you have any idea where she could be? Friends? Family? An ex or a secret boyfriend?\u201d Kenny asked.</p><p>If I did I wouldn\u2019t be here wasting my time with you, would I?</p><p>\u201cI was the secret boyfriend.\u201d Jett\u2019s hand shot through his dark hair as he tried to calm down the angry voice inside him. No good in lashing out at the people around him. They weren\u2019t to blame.</p><p>\u201cI tried calling her mother who didn\u2019t seem particularly worried, but claimed she had no idea,\u201d Jett said. \u201cThe roommate\u2019s gone with her, so I can only assume they both took a road trip. The detective and his team called every hotel in the state of New York.\u201d Jett frowned at the memory. He was no professional, but even he knew no woman and her best friend would move out of their cozy apartment and into a hotel for no reason. Talk about wasting precious hours. \u201cI can only assume she\u2019s staying with her friend\u2019s family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour guy checked credit card companies?\u201d</p><p>Jett nodded. \u201cLast time she used it was at some grocery store across from her building.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat can you tell me about her friend?\u201d</p><p>Jett shook his head grimly, signaling that was a dead end. \u201cI know nothing about her. Only that her phone\u2019s switched off, too.\u201d</p><p>Kenny nodded and for a moment silence ensued. Jett\u2019s heart began to beat a million miles an hour, though whether it was from the amount of alcohol coursing through his blood or from the seriousness of the situation, he couldn\u2019t tell.</p><p>\u201cMaybe she\u2019s left the country.\u201d Kenny eventually resumed the conversation.</p><p>Jett had thought about it and discarded the option quickly. \u201cHow could she have paid for it without her credit card? I need you to dig deeper than that.\u201d He looked down at Kenny who remained silent, his displeasure clearly visible in the frown line on his forehead. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m out of the business, Jett. You know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t ask if it wasn\u2019t important,\u201d Jett whispered.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re my best friend and I\u2019d do anything for you, bro. But last time I barely got away with it. I vowed to stay out of trouble.\u201d</p><p>Kenny\u2019s hesitation reflected in his dark eyes, and for a moment Jett was sure his friend would leave him hanging. And then his gaze met Jett\u2019s and Jett knew he had won.</p> <p>\u201cYou like her, don\u2019t you?\u201d Kenny asked.</p><p>\u201cMore than I care to admit.\u201d It was the truth.</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll do it. Just promise to have my back if the wrong people come knocking on my door.\u201d</p><p>Jett smiled, and for the first time since the fight with Brooke he almost felt enthusiastic. Hopeful. Because Kenny always knew what to do. He wasn\u2019t one of the most feared hackers for no reason.</p><p>\u201cThanks, man. I appreciate it,\u201d Jett said.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll call once I have a lead.\u201d Kenny stood and Jett walked him to the door.</p><p>At 11.45 a.m the cell\u2019s screen buzzed to life with an unknown caller. Jett had been stuck in a meeting for the last two hours, barely paying attention to his father\u2019s endless rambling about a few new acquisitions and the consequent profits the company could make.</p><p>Jett excused himself and shot out of the room, pressing the cell to his ear but not speaking until he reached the men\u2019s restroom. The faint scent of roses wafted past as Jett peered into each cubicle, making sure it was empty.</p><p>\u201cShe boarded a plane to Europe,\u201d Kenny said as a means of introduction.</p><p>Had the private detective missed the credit card charge?</p><p>\u201cWait until you hear the next part,\u201d Kenny coaxed. \u201cYou sure you were the only secret boyfriend? Because it looks like someone else paid for the tickets.\u201d</p> <p>Brooke wasn\u2019t like that. And yet did he really know her?</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d Jett\u2019s voice was a layer of ice.</p><p>\u201cKen Clarkson. He\u2019s a lawyer from London. Owns a successful firm. Not married.\u201d</p><p>Why the heck did he need to know the last part? Was he supposed to feel better about the fact that Brooke might be seeing a not married guy? When did they meet and why did she trust him enough to let a stranger whisk her away on vacation? Could he be an ex?</p><p>\u201cJett?\u201d Kenny\u2019s tone was strained with something. Certainly not worry. More like humor.</p><p>\u201cGive me a sec.\u201d</p><p>The pressure behind Jett\u2019s eyes intensified at the thought of Brooke in the arms of another man, claiming what should be Jett\u2019s. He moistened a hand under the cold water tap and ran it over his feverish nape. The cool moisture provided enough diversion to help him gather his thoughts through all the brain fog. And that\u2019s when he began to put two and two together. A lawyer. Paid-for tickets. Europe.</p><p>\u201cWhere exactly in Europe?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLet me check.\u201d The sound of flicking papers carried down the line an instant before Kenny said, \u201cSome place called Bellagio. Never heard of it.\u201d</p><p>He had found her in\u2014</p><p>Bellagio\u2014Italy.</p><p>Fuck!</p><p>That wasn\u2019t good. On a scale from one to ten, this was a hundred. A disaster.</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLast night,\u201d Kenny said. \u201cShe landed earlier this morning.\u201d</p><p>Jett\u2019s heart began to thump just a little bit harder. If he jumped on a plane now, he\u2019d be there in eight hours. The actual work would begin now but he wasn\u2019t worried about that. He\u2019d never been scared of giving his best\u2014be it working at his job or getting a woman. What worried him was that he could be too late. He had to get to her, and quickly.</p><p>\u201cDo you need me to find out more about the lawyer?\u201d Kenny asked.</p><p>\u201cI need something else.\u201d Jett paused as he looked around to make sure no one could hear him. The restroom was still empty, but he lowered his voice nonetheless to be on the safe side. \u201cFind me a gun dealer in Bellagio.\u201d</p><p>A pause then, \u201cYou\u2019re not going to kill her? Or the lawyer?\u201d He could sense Kenny\u2019s doubt.</p><p>What the fuck?</p><p>Jett had done many stupid things in his life, but he had never been even remotely inclined to harm a woman. He took a deep breath to steady the waves of anger rushing through him. \u201cJust find me the right guy, Kenny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was just\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d Jett said, interrupting him. He had no time for questions. It was getting late and he had to get the company jet ready. \u201cJust do what I said.\u201d</p><p>His father\u2019s meeting was still going strong as Jett returned to the conference room. He wasn\u2019t keen on wasting any more time, but as a CEO he couldn\u2019t just leave without notice\u2014or without anybody noticing. It wouldn\u2019t bode well with his reputation. As Jett slipped back into his seat, Robert Mayfield\u2019s stare fell on Jett and his brows shot up. The old man didn\u2019t like to entertain the idea that something else might be more important. Jett scribbled \u2018business meeting in Europe\u2014critical\u2019 on one of the notepads carrying the company logo and pushed it across the table toward his father. Signaling Emma to approach, Jett instructed her to gather his stuff, get the company pilot on the phone, and cancel all appointments for the week. He drove home to change and get his passport, then straight to the airport where the company\u2019s private plane would take him all the way to the place he visited not that long ago. With her.</p><p>Chapter 1</p><p>BROOKE</p><p>Love happens in the blink of an eye. One moment your heart is yours, and the next it belongs to someone you never intended to give it to. There is no transition. No earning on his part. Just foolish trust and hope for a future of happiness and emotional fulfillment. As much as we all hope for a happily ever after, life doesn\u2019t work that way.</p><p>Love\u2019s a bitch. I had to learn that lesson the hard way in the form of a green-eyed, sexy as sin, six foot two sex god.</p><p>Jett.</p><p>My first and only foray into love, and the second biggest mistake of my life.</p><p>I smirked as I adjusted my sunglasses so my best friend, Sylvie, wouldn\u2019t catch the telltale signs of betrayal in my eyes. God knows I had shed enough tears over Jett. You would have thought they were depleted by now. Fat chance. It seemed I still had a few left, whether I wanted it or not. Not only did I realize that love can grow in the absence of the person you love, but so does the pain resulting from a broken heart.</p><p>It was funny, really, because I couldn\u2019t figure out why I started loving him in the first place. Was it his good looks? Or the way he made me feel? The sex? He sure as hell didn\u2019t deserve it.</p><p>It was barely ten a.m. but the sun stood high on the horizon, bathing the Malpensa Airport building in a glow. Already I could tell it was going to be a hot day, which wasn\u2019t surprising given that we were in one of the most beautiful and expensive vacation spots in Italy.</p><p>\u201cLet me help you,\u201d Sylvie said decisively, snatching my suitcase out of my hand before I could argue. I watched her in silence as she heaved it into the taxi trunk, ignoring the driver\u2019s awkward attempts at helping her. She had been protective and caring for the last two days, ever since the thing with Jett blew up. She had been tripping over her own feet to help me \u2018survive\u2019 the raging storm within my heart. In the last forty-eight hours I had been served and massaged, had my hair brushed, my bags packed, and my makeup done by her. I drew the line at having her feed and carry me. Sylvie had always been a good friend, but being caring didn\u2019t come naturally to her. So the sudden attention scared the crap out of me. I didn\u2019t know whether to run away or hug her.</p><p>\u201cHey, Brooke?\u201d Sylvie tapped my shoulder to get my attention. I turned to face her, realizing I had been spaced out. Again. My brain just switched off momentarily like a computer on standby and needed to be tapped back into work mode. It wasn\u2019t natural for a twenty-three-year old. I knew it. She knew it. The whole world probably did. I wished I could make it stop. Get my old life back where I was just \u2018Brooke\u2019\u2014an overworked, underpaid college graduate na\u00efve enough to hold on to her dreams.</p><p>Just forget.</p><p>If only I could.</p><p>\u201cGet in,\u201d Sylvie said, holding the taxi door open for me. I nodded thanks and slumped onto the backseat. Sylvie joined me and grabbed my hand, giving it a firm squeeze, while her smile said everything there was to say. My best friend was here to support me. She\u2019d take care of me until my heart mended and the pieces of my world glued back together.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re awesome. You know that?\u201d I whispered to Sylvie.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what friends are for.\u201d She moistened her lips and her expression clouded over, as though she wanted to say more but decided against it. I scanned her flawless face and long blond hair. Her outward, gentle beauty revealed none of the hard shell coating her heart. Just like me, she had been bent and broken by men but, unlike me, Sylvie never gave up on love. She kept jumping into the next relationship, only to have her heart broken once more. We were different in this respect. I certainly wouldn\u2019t make the same mistake twice.</p><p>\u201cDid Clarkson say when you\u2019re going to meet the old man?\u201d Sylvie asked, changing subject.</p><p>I shook my head as I thought back to the English lawyer I had met with in New York. \u201cHe said he\u2019d call once we landed.\u201d Absentmindedly, I began to play with the metal clasp of my handbag\u2014a birthday gift from Sylvie\u2014and traced my fingers over the soft faux leather. At that time I had been reluctant to accept it because it had been so damn expensive and I wasn\u2019t used to luxury. To think that I had just inherited a multi-million dollar estate from a relative I didn\u2019t even know I had completely blew my mind. To think that Jett had tried to trick me into selling the estate so he could build luxury lake-side accommodations for the rich and famous blew my mind even more\u2014and not in a good way. I smirked and leaned back against the smooth leather seat.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the plan?\u201d Sylvie asked.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s showing me the property first, then we\u2019ll move on to the next step.\u201d</p><p>She nodded slowly. \u201cWhich is looking at the estate\u2019s accounting to make sure the old man\u2019s not passing any debt to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was just a reminder, Brooke, in case you forget.\u201d</p><p>I shot her a dirty look and she smirked back. I never forgot anything and Sylvie knew it. This was her way to tell me that I was playing in a completely different league here. Basically, well over my head, while she was the one who knew everything about high society, and she was determined to take the role of mentor.</p><p>Not that I had ever asked her for her guidance. Or that I needed a mentor. But I let her do and say as she pleased because every now and then Sylvie\u2019s advice hit the spot. I had no idea what to do with a mansion and thousands of acres of land, with an entire legal firm on speed dial, and a bank director wanting to meet me personally to commence our \u2018business relationship.\u2019 The coming days would be tough, and I was thankful to have someone like Sylvie by my side.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll do okay, chica,\u201d Sylvie said, misinterpreting my silence. \u201cI don\u2019t doubt you for a second.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I smiled. It was easier to let her think I was nervous because of my first meeting with Alessandro Lucazzone. I couldn\u2019t tell her that my heart was fluttering like a delicate butterfly throwing itself against its prison because the hour-long drive to Lake Como brought on more pain than I cared to acknowledge. And now my demons were officially out of the cage and I had to face them.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll be here eventually. You know that, right?\u201d I whispered.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Sylvie said. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t matter. You won\u2019t have to talk to him if you don\u2019t want to. You don\u2019t have to see him ever again. He\u2019s part of your past and he\u2019ll stay that way.\u201d</p><p>Taking a deep breath, I propped my head against the window and stared out at the stunning display of sparkling blue water and mountaintops, wondering whether I could really stay away from the one man who broke my heart.</p> <p>Chapter 2</p><p>Tiny gravel stones crunched beneath the tires as the taxi came to a halt around the corner and parked neatly in the vast driveway of the Lucazzone estate. I paid the driver and exited the car, barely paying attention as he helped with the luggage. He took off down the unpaved private terrain that seemed to be the only way to reach the Lucazzone mansion, unless you didn\u2019t mind a rocky boat ride across the lake on the other side of the estate. Both were secluded areas.</p><p>I knew I shouldn\u2019t gawk and yet I couldn\u2019t help myself. From up front, the magnificent building stretching three stories into the sky looked like a miniature of a Venetian palace, stuck in the middle of the countryside. The grand three-opening loggia with pillars and dovecotes on the roof was reminiscent of the fortress-like villas of the early 1500s, but it had a personal flair to it: a beauty that transcended place and time. A warmth that instantly made me feel at home, and at the same time a soft shiver ran down my spine because I realized that one day everything would be mine.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s so beautiful.\u201d Arms stretched out, I resisted the urge to spin in a slow circle. Instead, I inhaled the fragrant air. It wasn\u2019t just beautiful\u2014it was haunting, mesmerizing. So silent I could hear the chirping birds and the soft wind rustling the leaves. Sylvie didn\u2019t answer. I shot her a sideway glance and caught the drawn brows. I didn\u2019t dwell on it because old houses and nature weren\u2019t exactly Sylvie\u2019s thing. A margarita and a nightclub were more her locale.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s ring the bell,\u201d I said, grabbing her arm and pulling her up the stairs to the front door.</p> <p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t the lawyer be expecting us?\u201d Sylvie asked.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s probably inside and didn\u2019t hear the taxi. It\u2019s a huge house.\u201d</p><p>Sylvie mumbled something that resembled a \u2018maybe.\u2019 I paid her no attention as I pressed the bell. A moment later the door opened and Clarkson\u2019s tall figure blocked the view inside.</p><p>\u201cMiss Stewart.\u201d He reached out his hand, and the lined skin beneath his eyes crinkled as though he was genuinely pleased to see me. I shook his hand briefly, then moved aside to introduce Sylvie.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the lady who wouldn\u2019t open the envelope,\u201d Clarkson said good-humoredly.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the gentleman who wouldn\u2019t stop pestering me about it,\u201d Sylvie returned. I laughed because they both nailed it. I had been in Italy when Clarkson first called to inform me that I was about to inherit the Lucazzone estate. Naturally, he didn\u2019t disclose that information to Sylvie, but his secretary had sent a form letter, which Sylvie was too scared to open.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s lovely to finally make your acquaintance,\u201d Clarkson said. I could tell he was smitten with her by the way his eyes seemed to linger on her, taking in every detail of her designer-clad body. He seemed like a nice guy\u2014genuine, well-mannered and, judging from the lack of a wedding ring or tan line on his finger, definitely not married. He was too old for her though, at least twenty years her senior, and that gave me peace because I wouldn\u2019t want my best friend to date my lawyer.</p><p>\u201cThanks for inviting us,\u201d I said, drawing his attention back to me. A flicker of disappointment appeared in his eyes and disappeared just as quickly.</p><p>\u201cIt was Mr. Lucazzone\u2019s wish to meet his heir before\u2014\u201d He dies, I mentally filled in the blank. Clarkson cleared his throat. \u201cAnyway, he\u2019s still in hospital and cannot be with us for another day or two, until his tests are performed. But he\u2019s instructed me to show you to your rooms and make your stay a pleasant one.\u201d</p><p>Clarkson helped with the luggage as we followed him down the hall and up the stairs, past several closed doors into what looked like a large drawing room. He tried to maintain a light conversation, asking about our flight and drive over. I let Sylvie handle it as I took in the house.</p><p>Outside I had described it as beautiful, but the word did it no justice. It was magnificent and huge with cream marble floors, expensive paintings adorning the walls, and a huge staircase leading to the second and third floor balustrades. Suiting the Mediterranean style, several vases with flowers were set up in the corners, brightening up the minimalist look. It was my style: no clutter, everything neat and orderly, just the way I liked my life.</p><p>\u201cThis is the west wing. It\u2019s all yours. You\u2019ll find all rooms have a spectacular view of both the lake and the mountains behind,\u201d Clarkson said, keeping up the small talk. \u201cI\u2019ll let you settle in. We can go over the financial reports in the next few days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds perfect.\u201d</p><p>He nodded and his eyes twinkled again. I figured many people would have felt at least a pang of jealousy for my unexpected windfall, but not Clarkson. He seemed genuinely pleased for me.</p> <p>\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d he said. \u201cAll members of the staff will gather later this afternoon to introduce themselves. They come and go as they\u2019re needed so you\u2019ll have the house all to yourself until Mr. Lucazzone\u2019s back. If you need anything, please don\u2019t hesitate to call. I\u2019m staying in Bellagio, which is a stone\u2019s throw away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you for everything,\u201d I said, meaning every word.</p><p>\u201cMy pleasure,\u201d he said, opening the first door. \u201cI hope the ladies will have a pleasant stay.\u201d His look swept from me to Sylvie and lingered there a bit too long as he handed me what looked like a leather pouch with a silver ring dangling from it, which I assumed were the keys to the house. I nodded a \u2018thanks\u2019 and Clarkson reached out his hand to shake mine. And then he was gone and the house was silent. For a few seconds I felt disoriented\u2014surreal. We were in Italy. Alone. In a huge house that would soon belong to me.</p><p>\u201cYou still have time to run,\u201d Sylvie whispered. I smiled at her weak attempt at humor to ease my nerves.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ll stay.\u201d I smiled and pointed at the open door. \u201cNow, have your pick before I change my mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d I asked Sylvie as soon as we had unpacked our suitcases and opened the balcony doors to let in the fragrant air of the nearby woods. We were sitting on the expensive lounge chairs, soaking up the warm rays of sun as we stared onto the lake. The sun caught in the sparkling water and reflected in a million facets. I sighed with pleasure as I relaxed into the soft pillows, figuring the only thing missing was a big hat, orange lemonade, and an umbrella straw.</p><p>She hesitated. \u201cI like it. You\u2019ll be fine. Big old house, plenty of silence and a lake to swim. Let\u2019s hope you have internet, so we can stay in touch when I\u2019m back in New York.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes were closed and her face a perfect mask of indifference, but I didn\u2019t fail to catch the slight bitter tone in her voice. She didn\u2019t want to lose her best friend, which was understandable given that we had known each other for so long. I felt uneasy at the thought of not seeing her every day, but I wanted to give this new development in my life a chance. It wasn\u2019t going to be forever; just for a while\u2014until the Jett episode blew over and I managed to get a job I liked\u2014far away from him and his world. How could I make this clear to her?</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not the city life we\u2019re used to but I agree it\u2019ll be a nice change for a while.\u201d Emphasis on while. \u201cYou could stay with me. Explore the country. Do all the things people do. You\u2019ve got to admit it\u2019s an amazing opportunity.\u201d</p><p>Her head inclined to the side. \u201cWe could learn Italian. Maybe attend a cooking course. Get married. Have four kids. And talk about diapers and skin rashes the entire day.\u201d</p><p>I groaned, ignoring the sudden urge to roll my eyes. As usual, she was being sarcastic at the outlook of not visiting a club every night. She wasn\u2019t a country girl. She loved the fumes, the stress, the constant mental activity, and lack of sleep. Me? Not so much. If I wanted her to stay with me, I needed a different tactic.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard Italian guys are hot.\u201d</p><p>Now I had her attention. Sylvie\u2019s eyes snapped open and her lips curled into a smile. \u201cYou\u2019re back on the game? I wouldn\u2019t mind one of those charming, sultry, suave Latinos who can set the room on fire with a single sway of his hips. Imagine the passion, the drama, the intensity.\u201d She threw her head back and took a deep breath, fanning herself with her manicured fingers.</p><p>I knew I might be letting the she-wolf out of the cage with my casual remark, and yet I honestly didn\u2019t expect so much enthusiasm coming from her. In Sylvie\u2019s world there was only success, sex, parties, and variety\u2014and any combination of those. No doubt Lake Como could provide any of those but was I really keen on it?</p><p>Sensing my hesitation, Sylvie pulled a face, misinterpreting my silence. \u201cNo club? What about a bar? I don\u2019t even mind a bit of walking or a long drive, as long as there\u2019s any sort of music and alcohol.\u201d She pouted.</p><p>Lie, Stewart.</p><p>If I lied and said there were no bars or clubs, Sylvie would leave me hanging within the week. I just knew it. If I told her about Bellagio\u2019s nightlife, I doubted we\u2019d get to see any sights, other than the bottom of a tequila shot.</p><p>\u201cTo get to a club we\u2019d need to cross the lake, walk up the hill, and then take a taxi to the city,\u201d I said slowly. It wasn\u2019t the shortest way but certainly not a lie.</p><p>Sylvie jumped up and regarded me with a smug smile that told me I had just lost the battle.</p><p>\u201cOr we could go the way we came. I don\u2019t mind the extra miles.\u201d She pulled a card from her back pocket and waved it in the air, inches from my face.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is that?\u201d I tried to grab it out of her hand but she pulled it away and stepped back, pressing it against her chest like a piece of treasure.</p><p>\u201cOur very own personal taxi service. I figured it wouldn\u2019t hurt asking the driver whether he offered private trips. Turns out he does. How cool is that?\u201d Her eyes sparkled again and I knew I had, indeed, lost the battle.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that expensive?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>The girl came from a rich background; she grew up as part of the upper class society. Of course she had no objections to throwing money out the window\u2014unlike me.</p><p>\u201cCome on, chica. My treat.\u201d She rolled her eyes. \u201cNot that you need it.\u201d</p><p>I sighed. Just because I\u2019d inherit an estate didn\u2019t mean it came with a bank account set up for nights out. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBrooke.\u201d Her blue eyes bore into mine and she pouted again. \u201cLet\u2019s go out. Only tonight. You know me. I can\u2019t be this.\u201d She smirked and pointed around her at the stunning house and the setting, like it was a bad thing. \u201cI honestly don\u2019t mind a long drive or a huge taxi bill. Any small club is better than no club. Please.\u201d</p><p>Puppy eyes again. My hesitation faltered because, first, I knew a lost cause when I saw one. And second, come to think of it, a bit of fun wasn\u2019t such a bad idea. I was single\u2014I cringed inwardly at the thought\u2014and in one of Europe\u2019s most famous vacation spots. I had sworn off alcohol for good but I could at least dance the night away.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be back by midnight?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d Sylvie shrugged and averted her gaze, which was a dead giveaway that she was lying. In that moment, I knew I wouldn\u2019t be able to pry her away from the clubs with a crowbar\u2014unless the bouncers threw us out.</p> <p>With a strange sense of dread gathering in the pit of my stomach, I watched Sylvie pull out her cell and dial the number on the card. A moment later she had agreed on a time and hung up.</p><p>We hadn\u2019t even fully unpacked our bags yet, and she had already secured a trip to a local nightclub. Talk about priorities!</p><p>I followed her inside as she began to rummage through her suitcase, and I sat down on the bed, watching the mess she was about to unleash upon her room. Soon her clothes were scattered all over the floor and bed. Judging from the half full suitcase, there was more to come.</p><p>Back home Sylvie insisted we pack everything we might need, which in Sylvie\u2019s dictionary was the equivalent to cramming everything from her overflowing closet to the contents of her bathroom cabinets into the oversized suitcase she wanted to take with her. Needless to say, we had paid the price for extra baggage at customs. But at least she knew how to dress. I stared open-mouthed at one designer dress after another, some barely resembling a dress at all. More like pieces of sheer fabric that left nothing to the imagination.</p><p>\u201cYou need to get laid,\u201d Sylvie said as she pulled out two short dresses and compared them. \u201cAnd pronto. Jett might have been hot, but newer is always better.\u201d</p> <p>Where the hell did that come from?</p><p>\u201cI never said I wanted to get laid,\u201d I said through gritted teeth.</p><p>\u201cOf course you didn\u2019t.\u201d She smirked and tossed one dress aside, then picked up another. \u201cBut I know you want to. Or at least that\u2019s the way to go if you want to rid your heart of him once and for all.\u201d</p><p>I slumped against the pillows as I regarded the dress in her hands. She was right about that. In her own way. Ever since I came back from my trip with Jett, she seemed to have recovered from her own heartache. If I wanted to move on, all I had to do was be like her. Forget the world. And just have fun, even if that meant dating lots of men within a very short time. She wasn\u2019t cheap. She didn\u2019t sleep with most of them\u2014she just liked soaking up the attention and then moving on to the next.</p><p>She winked. \u201cWhatever you do in Italy, stays in Italy. I promise my lips are sealed.\u201d</p><p>Oh, Lord.</p> <p>She tossed the first dress to me. I caught it in mid-air. \u201cTry this.\u201d</p><p>I held up the strapless dress and eyed it suspiciously. The black material felt soft in my hands, almost weightless. It was so tight and thin, I had no doubt people would see my underwear\u2014particularly under the neon lights of a club. Definitely not the kind of dress I had in my wardrobe.</p><p>Under normal circumstances I\u2019d have objected to wearing something that daring, but today was different. I wanted to be someone else, preferably someone that wouldn\u2019t remind me of my old boring self.</p><p>What do you want to prove, Stewart?</p><p>Ignoring my rational mind, I shrugged out of my jeans and casual shirt. Sylvie dangled a pair of black pumps in front of my face.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be able to walk in them,\u201d I said, slipping into the shoes nevertheless. The heels were so high I almost toppled over and had to hold on to the dresser for support.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t say no to Jimmy Choo. It\u2019d be a sin. Plus, you look hot. If I were a guy I\u2019d totally do you.\u201d Her dead serious expression told me she wasn\u2019t kidding.</p><p>I inspected myself in the large mirror. This was a dress I\u2019d never wear back home, but we weren\u2019t back home. No one knew me here. Besides, Sylvie was right, I looked hot. The dress hugged my body in all the right places, emphasizing my curves, of which I had always been ashamed until college when I realized men liked them. The heels made my legs appear thinner and sky-high. Maybe not as long as a model\u2019s, but I could certainly see the benefit in wearing them.</p> <p>\u201cTold you,\u201d Sylvie said, grinning. \u201cNow, let\u2019s rock this town.\u201d</p><p>Biting my lip, I nodded and averted my gaze. How could I tell her that Bellagio wasn\u2019t exactly a town? More like a village. I was yet to find out just how tiny it actually was.</p><p>Chapter 3</p><p>Sitting in the backseat of the taxi with my arms wrapped around me, I realized Sylvie\u2019s dress choice had seemed a good idea in the privacy of our four walls. Not so much in public. I kept pulling the hem in the hope of giving it more fabric, or length\u2014anything that would help me feel less naked.</p><p>\u201cYou look so hot,\u201d Sylvie whispered, probably misinterpreting my fidgeting. \u201cI bet every guy in that club will be all over you the moment you enter the door.\u201d</p><p>Did I want that?</p><p>Not really.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t the attention seeking type or the one who wanted to be in the spotlight, but I couldn\u2019t share that with Sylvie. She wouldn\u2019t understand.</p><p>\u201cNo, I bet they\u2019ll be all over you.\u201d I pointed at her little black dress, which seemed to ride even shorter than mine. Or maybe it was the effect of her long and toned legs stretching up forever.</p><p>\u201cYou think?\u201d Sylvie\u2019s face lit up like a Christmas candle. Not only was she stunning, she also had a constant need to be reminded of it.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I said, happy to no longer be the topic of the conversation.</p><p>I stepped out of the taxi into the balmy night air. My curls framed my cheeks and brushed my naked shoulders like soft butterfly wings, making my skin tingle. Club 66\u2014the only club in the nearby area\u2014was a tall, tower-like building with a glass front. The front doors were open and the faint beats of some Top Forty song carried over. A broad shouldered big guy stood to the side, eyeing us. I wasn\u2019t sure whether he was supposed to be some kind of bouncer or just a guest waiting for his date, lighting up a cigarette or looking for phone reception.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all you could find?\u201d Sylvie glared at me from under heavily mascaraed eyelashes.</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cWant me to quote you? Like you said, \u2018better than sitting at home, growing roots.\u2019 If you don\u2019t like it, we can still grab a pizza on the way back home and watch reality TV.\u201d</p><p>Actually, I wouldn\u2019t have minded that.</p><p>Just thinking about it\u2014sitting around in pajamas, eating ice cream and watching a really sad movie, preferably where the male main character died, because Jett was as good as dead to me\u2014sounded like the perfect night to me.</p><p>Sylvie scoffed and walked through the doors into what resembled a dimly lit reception area, leaving me behind smiling. With her it was all a matter of priority. Any sort of club was better than no club. At times I wondered how the heck we managed to stay friends for so long when we had so little in common.</p><p>The reception desk also served as a coat counter, which was obvious from the few jackets dangling from hangers and a lady standing there, cashing in. Sylvie and I weren\u2019t wearing jackets, but we paid the cover charge and our hands were stamped, and then we entered the actual club area.</p><p>Being one of the few entertainment opportunities for those aged eighteen and up within a fifty-mile radius of Bellagio, the room was filled to capacity, overflowing with dancing girls and young men vying for their attention. The walls were covered in mirrors. Manufactured smoke wafted in the air, creating a dreamlike haze. Surreal but also a bit tacky. In the middle of the room was a huge staircase leading to a second story that, gazing up from my position, looked like it was bathed in darkness. I could already tell the music\u2014the same fast beat I had heard outside\u2014would make any sort of conversation hard. I mentally prepared myself for a long silent chat with the bottom of my glass as Sylvie and I maneuvered around the gathered crowds of people, heading for Sylvie\u2019s most preferred spot: the bar.</p><p>\u201cYou order while I\u2019m looking for a table,\u201d I yelled at Sylvie so she\u2019d hear me over the background noise.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she yelled back, her gaze fixed on her right where three people worked behind the bar, mixing and serving at a fast speed. I couldn\u2019t tell whether she was so transfixed by the outlook of getting hammered, or the music was indeed way too loud. Tugging at her arm to get her attention, I leaned in to repeat in her ear and watched her flinch. Nope, it wasn\u2019t the music. Just the anticipation of an alcohol-infused night.</p><p>I didn\u2019t wait for her reply. Making my way past the staircase with a rope running across it and marked as \u2018VIP area\u2019, I scanned the tables and chairs lining the walls. They were all occupied, apart from one table. I dashed for it like a maniac, eager to \u2018claim\u2019 it before someone else spied me and beat me to it. I didn\u2019t even care that my dress exposed way more of my thighs than was acceptable as I slumped onto the plush leather settee and bumped my knee against the table in front of it.</p><p>Long pangs of pain shot up my leg. I cringed to hold back a startled yelp, already missing my jeans, which would have provided a layer of protection.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d Sylvie said, sliding next to me.</p><p>I nodded and grabbed a drink from her outstretched hand, realizing she had made the effort to remember I had sworn off alcohol for good because every time I so much as took a sip, something bad happened.</p><p>Like me waking up half-naked in bed next to a man who turned out to be my boss.</p><p>Or revealing all the things I wanted to do with said boss, which reminded me that I was jobless now, and probably had bad references. Talk about stupid!</p><p>I took a sip of my water with a slice of lemon, and placed the glass on the table as I watched Sylvie gulp down half of her margarita while searching the area for prospective male targets. Half a minute later they had spied her, and the first suitor found his way to our table. I looked away and tuned out because I knew he most certainly wasn\u2019t going to offer me a drink, ask for a dance, or whatever he was about to say.</p><p>\u201cYou okay if I go for a dance?\u201d Sylvie whispered in my ear. \u201cHe\u2019s quite cute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave fun.\u201d I smiled at her encouragingly. In all the years we had known each other, I had grown used to guys probably thinking I was the less hot friend, the baggage, at times even the gatekeeper of the hot tall blonde.</p><p>For a few minutes I just sat there listening to the club music; my mind wandered off to the estate and my own life plans. I had no job but would inherit a property that was worth quite a bit of money. Not that losing a job had happened to me before, but it wasn\u2019t my style to live off someone else\u2019s cash. As soon as I figured out how long I\u2019d be staying I knew I\u2019d find employment, even if just for a few weeks. The language barrier might be a problem, but I hoped in a tourist area someone might have something for me that wouldn\u2019t require fluent Italian language skills. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThanks for saving our spot,\u201d Sylvie said, sliding back into her seat. I looked from her to the full margarita glass in her hand. It was at least the second drink and that barely twenty minutes within our arrival.</p><p>\u201cYou should slow down a bit. We\u2019re not in New York where we know the place.\u201d I wasn\u2019t usually the voice of reason\u2014or a buzz kill\u2014but we were in a different country.</p><p>She waved her hand and shot me a dazzling smile. \u201cRelax, Brooke. You weren\u2019t this boring when you were still guzzling down tequila shots with me.\u201d</p><p>I smirked. Granted, she had a point, but still. Nothing wrong with being careful. Better safe than sorry, right?</p> <p>\u201cLook at that hot Italian guy.\u201d Sylvie pointed past a group of dancing girls to a guy with a tattoo on his neck and a black leather jacket draped across the stool beside him. He looked like he belonged to a gang. I couldn\u2019t really judge whether he was hot, or not. Obviously I didn\u2019t have Sylvie\u2019s hawk eyes when it came to spying an attractive specimen of the other gender in a dimly lit club. From the distance I could barely make out more than his height and cropped hair, ripped jeans, and what looked like lots of ink covering his bare arms. For all I knew, he could be between twenty and fifty years of age, with a hideous face.</p><p>\u201cHe looks like a drug dealer,\u201d I remarked dryly.</p><p>Sylvie laughed that tinkling laughter of hers that told me she had probably heard the opposite of what I just said, and she grabbed her glass. \u201cTime to get acquainted.\u201d</p><p>Oh, god. Not him.</p><p>I grabbed her arm and yanked, forcing her to face me. \u201cPlease don\u2019t hook up with the local mafia. I don\u2019t want them knocking on our door, or burning down the house the moment they realize you go through men like others change their underwear. He looks like trouble and trust me, I have a keen eye when it comes to spotting trouble.\u201d I raised my brow, not stating the obvious.</p> <p>Something flickered in her blue gaze. First I thought it was a spark of realization that I was right\u2014and then her mouth pressed into a tight line and I knew it was determination. She was about to try to prove me wrong.</p><p>\u201cOh, come on, Sylvie. That\u2019s so stupid.\u201d I rolled my eyes. Sylvie yanked her arm away.</p><p>\u201cJust because he looks like a bad boy doesn\u2019t mean he is one. Besides, I\u2019m not interested in dating him. Just in having a drink and then chatting for a few minutes. You know, meet new people, and maybe improve my Italian.\u201d</p><p>Sylvie didn\u2019t speak one word of Italian. During our flight she had been using her meager Spanish and French vocabulary, think \u2018muchas gracias\u2019 and \u2018merci\u2019 when talking to the flight attendant.</p><p>\u201cChatting? Really? Do I need to remind you that\u2019s what you always say?\u201d I crossed my arms over my chest and regarded her coolly.</p><p>\u201cChill, Brooke. I know what I\u2019m doing. Besides, we\u2019re here to have fun. You might as well start having it.\u201d She shot me her most reassuring smile, which wasn\u2019t reassuring at all. If there was one thing I could say about Sylvie, it was that her taste in men sucked almost as much as mine. Given that mine had just hit rock bottom, I could only hope she wasn\u2019t going to try to top me.</p> <p>She leaned in to place a soft peck on my cheek, and then she was gone before I could mentally devise a strategy to keep her away from a natural human disaster. My eyes following her through the crowd, I leaned forward in my seat and craned my neck so I could watch Sylvie\u2019s every move\u2014just in case she was aiming for more than a drink. As if sensing the blonde behind him the tattooed guy turned, and then they were engrossed in conversation. Just in the blink of an eye. My heart fell in my chest as I observed their body language. Both leaning into each other, Sylvie smiled at something he said, and then he smiled. The next thing I knew they were on the dance floor, his arms wrapped around her. Her body grinded against him as the DJ switched the tune to something fast but sexy. The kind of music that invited you to let the guy you\u2019ve barely known for five minutes play acrobatics with your tongue.</p><p>My gaze glued to Sylvie and her conquest, I took another sip of my water when something tickled my neck and someone\u2019s hot breath caressed my ear.</p><p>\u201cBrooke, what the fuck do you think you\u2019re wearing?\u201d</p><p>I jumped in my seat at hearing the familiar voice in my ear, and my heart skipped a beat. Turning, I looked up to see him leaning over me, barely an inch away. The way he made my heart hammer, I knew I was far from over him.</p><p>Chapter 4</p><p>Holy mother of sins!</p><p>What the hell was he doing here?</p><p>The question played over and over in my head as I swallowed hard to get rid of the sudden lump in my throat. It wasn\u2019t just my throat that felt constricted, but everything else\u2014from my stomach to down below, as though every inch of my body remembered the good times he and I once had.</p> <p>That was before I found out he was planning to steal my future estate.</p><p>\u201cJ\u2014\u201d My mouth opened and closed again, unable to utter his name, while my eyes remained glued to him like a moth to light. I wanted to run; I wanted to scream, and yet I did none of those things. My whole being was too hurt to react, too stunned by his presence.</p><p>It couldn\u2019t be. He couldn\u2019t be here because he couldn\u2019t possibly know where I was. No one did. I took a deep breath to calm the alarm bells ringing somewhere at the back of my mind. I was in deep crap. No, make that the deepest and crappiest of crap, because Jett was at least twice as sinfully gorgeous as I remembered him and thrice as dangerous\u2014to my heart. The soft spot I thought I had for him in my heart and in my lower abdomen, magnified in the blink of an eye.</p><p>Dark hair that brushed his collar, eyes as deep and green as sin, a white shirt that only managed to emphasize his broad shoulders and sculpted chest\u2014the guy was a walking hazard to the female population. He certainly was to me. Even though he had crushed my heart and I knew about the kind of jerky trick he had tried to pull on me, I still couldn\u2019t help the tiny butterflies fluttering in the pit of my stomach. Maybe it wasn\u2019t my stomach, but something else. Something remembering his exploring fingers and the way he had filled me, making me come over and over again.</p><p>I rolled my eyes at my sudden onset of stupidity. Okay, we had amazing sexual chemistry and he definitely knew what he was doing, but whatever he had to say I wasn\u2019t going to listen to him. Or bed him. Even though I sort of wanted the latter. A lot.</p><p>\u201cYou know what I\u2019m going to do to every guy who so much as looks at you?\u201d Jett\u2019s lips brushed the lobe of my ear as his mouth moved to the corner of my mouth, his deep tone with just a hint of a Southern accent caressing my every nerve ending, making me want to\u2014</p><p>Hell, no!</p><p>I jumped to my feet to put some much-needed distance between us and almost toppled over the bistro table. My eyes bore into him and the music died around us. The whole room began to spin and the people turned into a blur of distorted faces and colors. Closing my eyes, I gripped the edge of the table for support and forced myself to take deep breaths until my heartbeat slowed down to a bearable level. When I opened my eyes again he was still there. Still towering over me. Still gorgeous. The room began to spin again and my resentment started to slip away, which angered me. I needed to be angry because he was the bad guy.</p><p>\u201cSit down.\u201d He closed the distance between us, the deep frown between his eyebrows barely taking away the breathtaking perfection of his face.</p><p>My mind screamed at him to stay the hell away from me, but my throat remained constricted, incapable of following my brain\u2019s command. I raised my arm to stop him. Jett flat out ignored it as he clutched my upper arm and pushed me back into my seat. He dropped down next to me, so close I might as well have sat on his lap. I watched him sniff the contents of my glass and push it into my hand, seemingly satisfied that it wasn\u2019t alcohol.</p><p>\u201cDrink up. You\u2019re dehydrated.\u201d His tone left no room for discussion. I hated to give him the satisfaction of following his command, and yet I found myself taking one sip after another until the glass was empty. He took it from me and placed it on the table, then turned to regard me, his head cocked to the side, his jaw set. His stunning green gaze wandered over me, drinking me in, making me feel completely naked. Even though the lights were dimmed, I could see a nerve twitching beneath his right eye. With every moment that passed he seemed even more pissed. I crossed my arms over my chest, wishing I was wearing more than the thin layer of nothing Sylvie called a dress.</p><p>\u201cYou still haven\u2019t answered my question, Brooke,\u201d he said slowly, emphasizing my name.</p><p>I returned his icy stare and my tongue finally regained its ability to speak. \u201cSorry, did you say something? I was too busy figuring out whether you were stalking me.\u201d</p><p>Jett\u2019s expression darkened. \u201cWhat the hell are you wearing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis?\u201d I looked at my half exposed chest and laughed. It sounded a bit strained and nervous, but he certainly couldn\u2019t tell with the music in the background. The tune changed to something about a girl not letting a guy trick her twice. I snorted.</p><p>How fitting!</p><p>The DJ was sending me a message.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll bite,\u201d I said. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re giving every guy in here a hard-on. Including me.\u201d His fingers brushed the inside of my thigh, riding as high as the hem of my dress, which was mere inches away from my thong. At his warm touch, heat immediately travelled through my belly and pooled between my legs. I pressed my thighs together and tried to push his hand away. He didn\u2019t move.</p><p>\u201cMaybe every other guy was the plan,\u201d I said. \u201cBecause I wasn\u2019t planning on seeing you. How did you find me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnce I figured you were in Italy, it wasn\u2019t hard. Knowing you and Sylvie, and given that this is the only club in the area\u2014\u201d He shrugged. I cringed at his audacity. Who the fuck did he think he was?</p><p>\u201cSeriously, you\u2019re such an arrogant jerk,\u201d I hissed.</p><p>His icy stare dropped a few degrees, if that was even possible. I narrowed my eyes in the hope he\u2019d feel my distaste for him.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t I make myself clear enough in New York? It\u2019s over between us. Get the fuck away from me, Jett. I don\u2019t want to see you.\u201d</p><p>If my words reached him, he didn\u2019t react. Didn\u2019t even blink. For a second I thought he didn\u2019t hear me. I opened my mouth to repeat myself when he raised his hand to cut me off. \u201cLook, I know what I did was a shitty move but I can explain. I was trying to protect you.\u201d</p><p>The protection crap again. \u201cWhat are you protecting me from? An inheritance you\u2019d rather have for yourself?\u201d I rolled my eyes. \u201cPlease, spare yourself further embarrassment and just leave me alone because I\u2019m not buying your lies.\u201d</p><p>His hand grasped my upper arm so fast and hard, I flinched. He inched closer until I could feel his breath on my lips. \u201cListen to me. I don\u2019t want the Lucazzone estate. There was a time when I did, but that changed after I met you in that bar and we got to know each other.\u201d</p><p>There was something in his eyes, a glint that begged me to believe him, a flame that forced me to search through our history for signs that he hadn\u2019t been trying to deceive me all along. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cFuck you, Jett.\u201d</p><p>He was so close, barely an inch away from me; I could barely breathe. I needed to get away from here, from him, from the whole situation. And yet I remained seated, not even yanking my arm away even though his grip was beginning to hurt.</p><p>As though sensing my discomfort, Jett loosened his grip but didn\u2019t let go of me. \u201cI know you don\u2019t trust me and I can\u2019t blame you. I probably wouldn\u2019t trust myself, but this is serious, Brooke. You don\u2019t know what you\u2019re getting yourself into.\u201d His calm tone and sharp gaze sent a shiver down my spine. Somewhere in the back of my mind I realized he had said exactly the same words before, and the realization made me uncomfortable. Not to mention it managed to ignite my curiosity.</p><p>\u201cProtect from whom?\u201d I almost choked on my words. The entire situation sounded like something out of a Hollywood movie. And yet I didn\u2019t laugh. Maybe it was the dead serious expression on his beautiful face. Or the way his thumb brushed my thigh, both soothing me and setting my skin on fire. Or his voice that conveyed a magnitude and significance I somehow seemed to fail to grasp.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s complicated,\u201d Jett said, hesitating. \u201cGo out with me and I\u2019ll tell you everything I know.\u201d</p><p>He almost got me.</p><p>I snorted at my idiocy. He was playing mind games again, and this was just another ruse to get me alone so he could seduce me or get whatever he was after.</p><p>\u201cNo way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. No date. Just breakfast, coffee, or whatever you want.\u201d He cocked a brow and a glint of amusement lit up his eyes. Green as sin\u2014the kind of sin I couldn\u2019t wait to dive into and stain my body with. No way was I going to be alone with him anywhere.</p> <p>\u201cWhat are you afraid of, Miss Stewart? That you won\u2019t be able to resist me?\u201d</p><p>Oh, god.</p><p>How could I have forgotten his inflated ego? I bit my lip hard so I wouldn\u2019t smile, not because it was funny but because he was so spot-on\u2014I might not be able to resist him. Not only was he scorching hot, he knew the effect he had on women, and that\u2019s never a good combination. Jett raised a brow in challenge.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not God\u2019s gift to the female population.\u201d I hated to admit it but he sort of was. At least his good looks were, thanks to his inherited hotness gene. Not sure about his shitty character. \u201cI\u2019ll give you five minutes over coffee, just to explain, and that\u2019s it. Then you\u2019ll leave me alone. Deal?\u201d</p><p>He seemed to consider my suggestion for a moment. I felt my heartbeat speed up again as I regarded him. Even though I was fuming mad and the scars of betrayal he had left behind would take years to heal, if ever, I couldn\u2019t help the bubble of happiness growing in my foolish chest. Now that the shock was slowly wearing off, I was happy to see him.</p><p>\u201cMake it dinner.\u201d</p> <p>I laughed at his self-assured expression and the amused glint in his eyes. He obviously thought I was going to give in. The guy definitely needed to be taught a lesson.</p><p>\u201cLunch, and that\u2019s my final offer. Take it or leave it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou drive a hard bargain, Miss Stewart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m known for my bargaining skills,\u201d I said proudly.</p><p>\u201cThrow in a drink and a dance today, and you have a deal.\u201d He moistened his lips, his tongue leaving a moist trail. I stared at it for a moment longer than I should have, unable to peel my gaze off him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not drinking tonight,\u201d I said.</p><p>His leg brushed my thigh. It was just an inch, but enough to remind me just how close we sat. My breath hitched and the walls began to close down on me. The air felt too hot to breathe.</p><p>\u201cA dance, then. And I get to pick the song.\u201d He grinned.</p> <p>No way was I letting him pick the damn song. He\u2019d probably go for something slow and sexy. Something that would invite a lap dance. That was way too personal, not to mention the last thing my crumbling self-control needed.</p><p>\u201cI pick the song,\u201d I said decisively.</p><p>\u201cWhat about we retreat to the VIP area and no one picks the song?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cWe stay here, on the dance floor, where everyone can see us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine by me, Brooke. I\u2019ve always been into public performance. I\u2019m glad to know I could give you a taste for it.\u201d His voice was low and hoarse, his stare intense, the glint of amusement gone, leaving no room for misinterpretation.</p><p>Oh, god.</p><p>My cheeks flamed as I thought back to the one time we had sex on the shore of Lake Como, where people could have seen us. I realized I had just said the most stupid thing ever and probably managed to inflate his ego even more. Soon it\u2019d grow to monstrous proportions, and he\u2019d need a bulldozer to push it through the door.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just dance before I change my mind,\u201d I said. At least he didn\u2019t get to choose the music.</p><p>Jett stood and reached down to help me up. I placed my hand into his outstretched palm, trying hard to ignore the electric shock running through my arm, playing havoc with my nerves.</p><p>As he pushed through the crowd making room for me to follow, I scanned the dance floor and bar, realizing Sylvie was nowhere in sight. She had taken off with Tattooed Guy.</p><p>Unbelievable!</p><p>My mood plummeted.</p><p>The dance floor was crowded but not to the point of strangers touching you. The neon lights over our heads flickered with the beat, bathing us in a seizure-inducing white glow. Above us I could see the staircase leading to the darkened VIP area; to our right was what looked like a DJ booth. Jett turned to face me but didn\u2019t move. I frowned, wondering what the heck he was waiting for.</p><p>The music was louder here. I leaned in to shout so he\u2019d hear me over the noise. \u201cOne song, Mayfield, and that\u2019s it. No touching, grinding, or any other funny moves. Or I\u2019m gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? You think I can\u2019t keep my hands off of you? You\u2019re damn right about that, baby.\u201d</p><p>As though to prove his point, his hands moved to my ass and pulled me against him. Balancing on seven-inch stilettoes, I barely reached his chin. His hand forced my chin up until our gazes interlocked. His lips neared mine, scorching my skin with his hot breath. For a moment I thought he\u2019d kiss me but he just hovered there, leaving me both wanting and fearing his kiss.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I managed to say through ragged breaths.</p><p>\u201cWaiting for the right song. I\u2019m going to make the best of my one and only dance.\u201d</p><p>The music slowed down a bit as the DJ made an announcement in Italian. I looked around, confused, wondering what was going on. An instant later, half the dance floor cleared and other people joined us. Most were couples. I realized the DJ was about to change the music and none of us had asked for it. Damn! I had been pretty comfortable with the last fast-paced song.</p><p>\u201cWhat did he say?\u201d I asked Jett, frowning.</p><p>His lips curled at one corner but he made no effort to explain as the beat morphed into a different song. A love song. I groaned inwardly.</p><p>Great, just great!</p><p>Jett must\u2019ve had a lucky day.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s more like it,\u201d he whispered as he pulled me closer to him\u2014so close I could feel his heartbeat.</p><p>I knew this song and instantly wished I hadn\u2019t agreed to a dance. The female vocalist began to sing something about love never dying, lurking in the deepest crevices, bypassing time, and resurfacing once more, stronger than before. It was just one song, albeit a stupid one. I chose to ignore her voice and let the beat lead the way.</p><p>It was all so slow and sexy, the way my chest trembled against his, the way Jett\u2019s body began to move against me, his hips molding into mine, his breath tickling my cheek, sending my heart into overdrive. I wanted to run and yet I couldn\u2019t move, as though he had put a spell on me and frozen me in his arms forever.</p><p>As the music pulled us in, our bodies moved in accord. I inhaled his scent\u2014a mixture of manly aftershave and him\u2014and let his arms envelope me, pressing me so close against him I could barely breathe. Maybe it was the way he smelled or the way his hands possessed me, but something about him drove me wild and daring. I felt his body brushing against mine and my mind dissolved into nothingness as our bodies merged to the hot beat. I don\u2019t know how long we just danced, clutching at each other, wanting, owning. By the time we stopped, I had lost track of both time and myself. I had long forgotten why I was so pissed at him. All that mattered was that I had never felt so right in anyone\u2019s arms.</p><p>\u201cYou smell so good. Like wild roses in a warm summer night\u2019s breeze,\u201d Jett said in my ear as he led me through the crowd and back to my table.</p><p>Smiling, I averted my eyes so he wouldn\u2019t see how much his words affected my sappy heart. What woman wouldn\u2019t want to hear she smelled like roses?</p><p>We reached the table and Jett pulled me against him, forcing me to meet his cryptic gaze. \u201cBrooke\u2014\u201d He trailed off, hesitating, as though he wanted to say something but couldn\u2019t decide whether to continue, or not. We stared at each other in silence, relishing the other\u2019s presence. Eventually he said what he had started, though I could tell by the guarded look on his face that it wasn\u2019t all.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>His eyes looked so earnest that my breath caught in my throat. No words could convey so much and yet so little. What was I supposed to say? That I believed him and that everything was all right\u2014when it wasn\u2019t? It\u2019d be a lie because I didn\u2019t believe him. I didn\u2019t trust him.</p><p>Jett squeezed my hand gently but combined with his words, it was too much. A sting of disappointment and pain washed over me. I pulled my hand away and stepped back to put some much-needed physical space between us. This stupid song! Love wasn\u2019t supposed to hurt.</p><p>His eyes bore deeper into my soul, cutting through layers of hurt and mistrust. I could feel him in my heart and in every fiber of my being.</p><p>\u201cI know you don\u2019t trust me, Brooke, and I\u2019m ready to give you as much time as you need, just don\u2019t back away from me. Give me a chance to prove that I was telling the truth.\u201d</p><p>His gaze was so intense, I found myself nodding. I wanted him to regain my trust, not to get back together, but because I knew deep down he wasn\u2019t a bad person.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a bus station in front of the club. Meet me there tomorrow and I\u2019ll explain,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I said reluctantly, already regretting my decision. \u201cAnd no more lies, Jett.\u201d</p><p>He took a deep breath and smiled that dazzling, lopsided smile of his that always managed to send my pulse racing. \u201cI promise you the truth and nothing but the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow go,\u201d I said. \u201cI don\u2019t want Sylvie seeing us together, or she might decide to bite off your head.\u201d And then I\u2019d certainly miss his beautiful face, but that I didn\u2019t add. Jett didn\u2019t need to know just how much he still affected me.</p><p>His face clouded over. \u201cI\u2019m not letting you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine, Jett. I\u2019ve never been better. Now go, or the deal\u2019s off.\u201d I infused my tone with all the resolve I could muster. I knew I sounded brisk and unfriendly, but I didn\u2019t want him to get the wrong idea. Jett could be stubborn, but so could I. I wasn\u2019t going to spend the evening with him and risk falling deeper into this mess before he had told me his part of the story. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Countless emotions, ranging from annoyance to mulishness crossed his features, and then it all settled into compliance. Obviously, he was a clever guy and knew when to back off.</p><p>\u201cBus station. Twelve o\u2019clock.\u201d His fingers trailed up my upper arm and settled beneath my chin, and for a moment I thought he was going to kiss me. I held my breath, anticipating the intimate touch of his lips, but it never came. \u201cPlease be careful. And Brooke\u2014\u201d</p><p>I raised my brows, barely able to breathe. \u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSwitch that goddamn phone on now. I don\u2019t want to have to remind you again.\u201d His tone was menacing, carrying just a hint of a sexy threat.</p> <p>I opened my mouth to tell him where he could shove his command, but he had already turned away, having the last word, as usual. Speechless, I watched his broad shoulders move away until he was swallowed up by the crowd. Only after sitting back down did I realize I had been holding my breath and my heart was acting crazy. And was that a hint of disappointment I detected?</p><p>I exhaled and pulled my phone out of my handbag, fighting the urge to do as he had bid. What would he do to me if I defied his authority? My heart skipped a beat at the countless possibilities flooding my mind, and my stomach clenched with anticipation at each and every one of them.</p><p>Did I want to find out what he had in mind?</p><p>Hell, no. We were done, so naturally I\u2019d switch on the phone\u2014after letting him steam just a little bit longer.</p><p>Twenty minutes later\u2014enough time to calm down my nerves\u2014Sylvie joined me at the table, blue eyes sparkling, cheeks glowing. She placed another glass of water in front of me and slumped into her seat.</p> <p>\u201cThanks.\u201d I pointed at the glass as I eyed her carefully, trying hard to keep my expression as nonchalant as possible.</p><p>\u201cGood catch! I\u2019m glad you\u2019ve met someone new,\u201d Sylvie said.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d I looked up from my glass, startled. Did she see Jett? Oh, god. I wasn\u2019t ready to explain yet when I didn\u2019t know what to say.</p><p>She pointed at a guy lingering near our booth. He had been standing there waiting for someone for the past ten minutes, and he just happened to look our way that very instant.</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not what you\u2019re thinking.\u201d I grimaced, unable to hide my annoyance.</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d She raised her brows knowingly.</p> <p>I chose to ignore the irritating grin on her face and changed the subject. \u201cHad fun?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot his number.\u201d She waved her phone and laughed. And then she went on to tell me everything about the guy. As much as I tried my best to listen to her gushing, I found myself drifting off, following my own thoughts to green eyes and a warning that had managed to instill discomfort in me.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d I said, cutting Sylvie off. \u201cI\u2019m really tired. Let\u2019s call it a night.\u201d</p><p>Maybe it was the disquieting undertone in my voice that reached her through the veil of alcohol and raging hormones, but Sylvie\u2019s gushing stopped instantly and her expression became serious. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d I gave her a half-hearted smile. \u201cJust tired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. I\u2019m calling our driver to pick us up early.\u201d</p><p>I nodded and mouthed \u2018thanks\u2019 as I followed her out into the starry night. Standing outside the club, the countless unfamiliar faces only managed to magnify my unease, and I couldn\u2019t wait to get home.</p><p>Chapter 5</p> <p>I spent the night tossing and turning, always aware of Jett\u2019s presence in my thoughts. When the clock hit seven a.m. I tiptoed past Sylvie\u2019s guestroom, heading downstairs into the large living room.</p><p>Soft sunrays were streaming through the high bay windows, bathing the room in a bright golden glow. I opened the door to the veranda and let in the fresh country air and the sound of chirping birds. The clear blue water of the lake shimmered. In the distance, I could make out two sailing boats\u2014probably early risers like me, unable to sleep for whatever reason. I took a deep breath and let it out slowly, enjoying every minute of nature I\u2019d never experienced in New York. Everything felt dreamlike in this beautiful house on this beautiful island. I wasn\u2019t sure I wanted to leave. At least not for a while.</p><p>So much had happened those past four weeks. Being transferred to Jett\u2019s company. My sexual arrangement with him that turned into something else. Then Alessandro\u2019s will and finding out there was more to Jett\u2019s intentions. Was a month all it took to change my world?</p><p>Jett had hurt me by trying to use me to get his hands on the estate, yet I still couldn\u2019t deny the fact that we had amazing chemistry. The time we spent together was one of the best in my life\u2014I was truly happy. At some point I honestly thought we belonged together. He was the first man to create so much contradiction inside me: love and hate. Lust and contempt.</p><p>I had thought by sneaking away from him I\u2019d put enough time and distance between us so I could recover. He managed to shatter all my hopes in the blink of an eye. Even though things were definitely finished between us and I had no intention to rekindle our romance, it bothered me that I had been genuinely happy to see him. It was wrong in every sense of the word, but I could do nothing about it. After seeing him again last night, I had no idea where I was standing in terms of feelings. And I certainly didn\u2019t want to find out. He could break down my walls too easily. Shatter my resolution and make me want to give in to my foolish heart. He wasn\u2019t worth the pain nor the feelings of guilt. In the end, I knew I\u2019d end up hurt again. With his green eyes and his strong body, he once possessed my body but I wouldn\u2019t want him to possess my heart and soul.</p><p>By the time I closed the doors and headed for the kitchen, the sailing boats were long gone and my stomach grumbled, reminding me that I hadn\u2019t eaten since the evening before. Opening and closing cupboards, I peered inside to familiarize myself with the contents. Whoever did the shopping had stocked up on everything from fresh fruit and vegetables, to bread, bacon, and cheese, probably expecting or believing Sylvie and I could cook. Sylvie barely knew how to make an omelet and I wasn\u2019t much better. As I filled the coffee filter the bell rang, startling me. My heart began to hammer in my chest and certainly not because I was scared. I hadn\u2019t told Jett I was staying at the Lucazzone estate, but for some reason I expected to see him here. Sort of looked forward to it. When I opened the door and realized it was Clarkson, I couldn\u2019t help the disappointment washing over me.</p><p>Forcing my mouth into a smile, I motioned him to come in. Dressed in a suit, he looked as though he was coming straight from the office and, judging from his no-nonsense expression, he obviously thought seven a.m. was the appropriate time for a business meeting.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, Brooke.\u201d He returned the smile and his glance scanned the front of my bathrobe. \u201cI hope I didn\u2019t wake you.\u201d</p><p>I ignored the urge to ask him to stop by later\u2014preferably when I was showered and dressed, and Sylvie wasn\u2019t still sleeping off her hangover. Instead, I wrapped my bathrobe tighter around my body and decided to lie.</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019ve been up for a while.\u201d My voice sounded a little hoarse from the lack of sleep, but you could attribute it to anything from a sore throat to a heated verbal discussion the previous night. I headed for the kitchen, expecting him to follow. \u201cDo you want coffee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019d be lovely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCream? Sugar?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you. I have to watch my cholesterol level.\u201d</p><p>He laughed briefly and I smiled because it was the polite thing to do. It had always bugged me to laugh when people said that line. There\u2019s nothing funny about a health concern so why would you try to laugh it off? Opening a cupboard, I rose on my toes to reach a mug and filled it with the still hot coffee, then handed it to him.</p><p>\u201cPlease, take a seat.\u201d I pointed at the polished mahogany table. He sat down and I followed suit, choosing the chair opposite from his. My hand wrapped around my half-full coffee mug but I didn\u2019t take a sip until he did.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s such a beautiful day,\u201d Clarkson started. I hope you and Sylvie are enjoying your stay. Is she still asleep?\u201d It seemed a harmless question, but for some reason I cringed inwardly. I didn\u2019t like him asking questions about her. He was twice her age and it felt creepy. Too personal.</p><p>Maybe he was trying to be polite, like most Brits I had met.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s Mr. Lucazzone today?\u201d I had never been particularly good at small talk or changing the subject gracefully. Luckily, Clarkson didn\u2019t seem to mind.</p><p>He inclined his head and his expression changed into a frown. \u201cI saw him last night and he was better than most days. But his health is declining rapidly. I\u2019m afraid he won\u2019t last much longer, Brooke.\u201d His tone was layered with worry, and I wondered whether he and the old man had been close.</p><p>I was about to say that I was sorry when Sylvie entered the kitchen dressed in a bathrobe similar to mine, only she looked so much hotter. Her blond hair was tied up in a high ponytail and her blue eyes, even though rimmed by dark shadows, looked sparkling and energized. I had no idea how she did that when I felt as though a train had just hit me, and I hadn\u2019t even touched any alcohol.</p><p>At the sight of Clarkson, Sylvie\u2019s eyes popped wide open. I could almost hear her thoughts. What was he doing here so early? I waved her closer and pressed my coffee mug into her hands\u2014not that she needed it.</p><p>Clarkson\u2019s eyes fixed on her and remained there for a long time. I bit my lip hard and begged my brain to come up with something\u2014anything\u2014to break the uncomfortable silence but, as usual, it remained surprisingly blank when it came to making small talk.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll let you ladies get dressed,\u201d Clarkson eventually said. \u201cMr. Lucazzone wishes to see you today. If you could be ready in half an hour, I\u2019d be more than happy to drive you to the hospital.\u201d His tone was friendly but I thought I heard a clear decisiveness of tone, a force that allowed for no objection. He smiled, and I realized I was probably over-analyzing things the way I always did.</p><p>I nodded and followed Sylvie upstairs.</p><p>Clarkson pulled the car into a visitor spot in the hospital\u2019s parking area, and we headed for the pretty yet inconspicuous building. With its yellow fa\u00e7ade, it would have blended right in with the other buildings on the street were it not for the double security glass doors and the large windows. Like many clinics in Italy, this particular one was a private institution\u2014a two-story, six bedroom home in a secluded Bellagio area, not far from the lake shore. The place was a surgically sanitary haven for the rich who were on the verge of leaving this world. As we entered and walked through the hall we were met by the sight of plush leather chairs, bouquets of flowers on every table, and soft music playing from invisible speakers. Smiling nurses in green linen uniforms pushed patients in wheelchairs along the spotless hallways into the stunning green yard that faced a small pond. Sylvie and I waited near the open terrace door as Clarkson announced our presence to the receptionist.</p><p>We followed Clarkson to the second floor and down the broad hall, past several closed doors. My stomach was in knots and my breathing came in whistling heaps. While I was nervous to finally meet Alessandro Lucazzone, I also harbored a strong dislike of hospitals to the point of having a panic attack. The smell of sanitizer and disease reminded me too much of my sister. Before she died she had been hospitalized for months, during which we came to visit often, each time working hard on putting on a brave face and maintaining a fake fa\u00e7ade of normalcy. As a thirteen-year-old, I understood the importance of keeping up the protective walls that would shield our family from the devastating realization of having a drug addict as a sister and daughter. I had tried hard to see the positive side of our visits, and in my juvenile fantasy the hospital with its sickening scents and scary, white walls had been a safe haven that would help my sister get well. The impression was shattered when Jenna died and, in his grief, my father shot himself. In his last few hours, while he lay attached to various tubes and machines, the white sheets were soaked with my mother\u2019s tears, and the room echoed with useless prayers that didn\u2019t keep him alive. That\u2019s when I realized hospitals were places of death. You went there to visit your loved ones before they were taken from you forever, reminding you that life could be lost in the blink of an eye. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I had managed to avoid entering hospitals ever since my father passed away, but even years couldn\u2019t wipe away the memories of powerless dread, of endless prayers that would go unheard.</p><p>\u201cThis is it.\u201d Clarkson pointed at a closed door. I took a deep breath to calm my racing heart and wiped my hands on the soft material of my knee-length skirt. What would I say to this stranger who had never met me and yet had decided to leave his estate to me? Saying \u2018thank you\u2019 felt wrong because, even though I was thankful, I didn\u2019t want him to think that inheriting what belonged to him was all that mattered to me.</p><p>\u201cMr. Lucazzone wishes to speak with Brooke alone,\u201d Clarkson said to Sylvie.</p><p>\u201cYou still have time to run,\u201d she whispered to me, ignoring the lawyer. I smiled at her weak attempt at infusing some humor to ease my nerves.</p> <p>\u201cReady?\u201d Clarkson nodded encouragingly and knocked twice, then opened the door, stepping aside. Moistening my parched lips, I walked into the room, leaving Sylvie outside.</p><p>Chapter 6</p><p>The old man was sitting in a wheelchair near the high bay window overlooking the gardens, his head resting on a pillow, his veined hands, the color of parchment, were sitting atop a blanket. In the bright afternoon sun, the whiteness of his bones shimmered beneath the thin skin, building a strong contrast to the purplish hue of his lips. To his right stood a middle-aged woman in a pale green uniform, her black hair with silver-gray streaks was tied at the nape of her neck. A nurse, I thought, and yet her glance seemed far too protective\u2014hostile, even. I knew instantly we wouldn\u2019t be friends.</p><p>As the door clicked shut behind us, the old man moved his head, his light blue eyes as sharp as ice. I inched closer on shaky feet, stopping a few inches away from him, unsure whether to speak or let Clarkson take the lead. My tongue flicked nervously over my parched lips, and it wasn\u2019t just because of my paranoia of hospitals. It was Alessandro Lucazzone who decided to address me.</p><p>\u201cSeniorina Stewart. Brooke.\u201d Despite his high age, his voice was still clear and strong\u2014like that of a man half his age\u2014and out of sorts with his aged body. He eyed me carefully and a genuine smile lit up his face, erasing my unease at meeting him.</p> <p>\u201cHow are you, sir?\u201d Bending down to him, I grabbed his outstretched fingers and let him kiss my hand. His grip felt cold and dry, but not unpleasant.</p><p>\u201cMy niece\u2014so beautiful. Already I feel better,\u201d he said in heavily accented English, releasing my hand. I smiled shyly. Even though his words were sparse, his tone was warm and welcoming. Not strange\u2014just friendly, making me feel as though I was family. A feeling I hadn\u2019t felt since Jenna and my father died. The sparkle of pride in his eyes conveyed just how much he meant his words. Alessandro had been gay, marrying my ancestor for money. Or maybe he had loved her, in his own way. I didn\u2019t know and even if I did, it wasn\u2019t my place to judge. All that mattered was that my presence made him feel better, because no one deserved to suffer.</p><p>\u201cThank you for inviting me.\u201d I glanced from the nurse to Clarkson in the hope someone would translate. In the end, Alessandro made it clear he understood me perfectly.</p><p>\u201cAlessia, bring us tea.\u201d He waved decisively at the nurse and watched her usher out the door, then motioned Clarkson to step closer. The lawyer pressed his ear to the old man\u2019s mouth but in the silence of the room I could hear his whisper. \u201cGive me a few minutes with her.\u201d</p><p>Clarkson nodded and peeked over his shoulder at me. I looked away hastily, even though I knew he had caught me listening.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll wait outside,\u201d the lawyer said, before shutting the door behind him, leaving Alessandro and me alone.</p> <p>\u201cPlease.\u201d The old man\u2019s accent was heavy as he patted the chair next to him, offering me a seat. \u201cWe don\u2019t have much time. Alessia will return shortly and she won\u2019t leave us alone again.\u201d</p><p>I walked around him and sat down, unsure what to say.</p><p>\u201cYou remind me of my dear wife, Maria,\u201d Alessandro began. \u201cYou look just like her. I wish you had met her. She would have adored you because she always wanted a daughter.\u201d His eyes misted over, reminiscing as he traveled back in time. \u201cShe was so strong and kind. So beautiful on the inside and out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry for your loss,\u201d I whispered past the sudden lump in my throat, but Alessandro didn\u2019t seem to hear me. His eyes filled with moisture.</p><p>\u201cShe died ten years ago, but I remember her like it was yesterday. She loved this estate. Sometimes that\u2019s the only thing I remember, yet I don\u2019t tell anyone because if I do, all will be lost.\u201d His gaze focused on me and for a moment his eyes sharpened. \u201cYou\u2019re my only heir, Brooke. You mustn\u2019t sell this estate and never to the wrong people.\u201d</p><p>This was the time to assure him that I never would. The estate certainly didn\u2019t hold the same emotional value for me that it did him, but I had enough respect to grant a dying man\u2019s wishes as long as I lived. And yet, as much as my heart wanted to speak out to him, to ensure him of my good intentions, my mouth remained shut, unable to utter a word in the face of so much passion emanating from him.</p><p>Alessandro gripped my hand softly, holding it as his eyes locked with mine. \u201cI promised my wife to keep the property within the family. My health is deteriorating by the day and I know one day, very soon, I won\u2019t wake up again. It\u2019s my greatest wish to see to my wife\u2019s happiness even beyond the grave and respect her wish. Please promise me that you\u2019ll take care of this property when I am gone and it will be yours.\u201d</p><p>I stared at him, not seeing him but the fact that he was dying and he knew it. It pained me because I didn\u2019t want it to happen. I wished for him to live for many more years to come, to enjoy the estate and everything he ever missed out on. The face I saw in front of me would someday cease to exist, belonging to a past that would be forgotten. While it wasn\u2019t in my power to change time or fate, I could at least carry on his legacy.</p> <p>\u201cFamily blood is the strongest of all,\u201d Alessandro whispered, sensing my thoughts. \u201cWe don\u2019t have much time to get to know each other, but you\u2019re part of this family and you\u2019ll always be\u2014\u201d his fingers gently touched my chest where my heart was located \u201c\u2014in here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promise,\u201d I whispered, meaning every word and more. \u201cI won\u2019t let you down.\u201d</p><p>He smiled and leaned back in his wheelchair. A few moments later Alessia returned with our tea and sat down near the window, not leaving us out of her sight, just like Alessandro predicted.</p><p>Alessandro and I talked for about an hour, during which he wanted to hear everything about my life. I told him how I grew up, leaving out the part with my sister and my father, because I didn\u2019t think it mattered. Besides, I didn\u2019t want to depress him. I tried to ask questions, but I could sense his reluctance at talking about more than his upbringing. He mentioned his son who died at birth and Maria\u2019s miscarriage a few years later. He told me of his wife\u2019s battle with cancer and how she lost it ten years ago, making me aware how lonely he must have been in the years after her passing. At some point, Alessia refilled our teacups, like a shadow slipping into my view and out of it, but never leaving the old man out of her sight. Alessandro and I talked some more until another nurse entered to remind him that it was time for his medication and therapy. Before he left, his shaky fingers pointed at an envelope on the table, bearing the conditions of his final will and photos he wanted to share with me.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Alessandro,\u201d I said.</p><p>He smiled and his shaky fingers touched my cheek gently. \u201cThank you, Brooke. Now that you\u2019re here I can finally rest.\u201d</p><p>His words hung heavy in the air as Alessia wheeled him out of the room. With a heavy heart and moisture in my eyes I watched him leave, vowing to keep my word to him no matter what. We had barely skimmed the surface of our lives, and yet I felt as though we were interconnected, our paths intertwined by fate, even if for a brief time. I felt as though I knew him on a deeper level, and that knowledge made it even harder to accept just how little time we had.</p><p>Call me na\u00efve because I liked to believe in the good in people, but I knew that Jett\u2019s claims about Alessandro Lucazzone couldn\u2019t be true. I could feel it. I could see it in the old man\u2019s eyes. He wasn\u2019t flawless; like everyone else, he had made mistakes. He married my ancestor for money rather than live the life he was born to live\u2014with a man. Or maybe he had loved her, in his own way. I didn\u2019t know and even if I did, it wasn\u2019t my place to judge. But he was no murderer. Whatever Jett\u2019s private detective thought Maria Lucazzone had written in her diary, I knew it couldn\u2019t be true and I would prove it.</p><p>Opening the window, I stared out onto the beautifully landscaped park-like garden as I took a long, deep breath to regain my composure, and then returned to Clarkson and Sylvie.</p><p>I found Sylvie on a bench on the veranda, sitting near the rosebushes and sipping lemonade. The sun was hiding behind light gray clouds, and a soft breeze coming from the lake ruffled the leaves and green grass, promising a light rain shower. The fragrant air was still warm though, as if not even the lack of sunrays could cool down the earth beneath our feet.</p><p>She frowned when I arrived, but if she caught my shaky emotional state she didn\u2019t dwell on it. \u201cYou\u2019ve been in there forever. How was the meeting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d I managed a half-hearted smile that wouldn\u2019t have fooled anyone. \u201cIt went really well.\u201d I sat down next to her and she pushed her lemonade glass toward me, silently welcoming me to take a sip. My fingers tightened around the glass but I couldn\u2019t bring myself to lift it to my lips. I didn\u2019t want to risk shattering it.</p><p>\u201cBrooke,\u201d Sylvie said slowly. Sensing something in her tone, I looked up to meet her stare. A shadow clouded her blue eyes and a soft line formed between her delicate brows.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I said warily.</p><p>She took a deep breath before replying and let it out slowly. I could tell she was preparing her words carefully, or maybe she was hesitant to share with me whatever was bothering her. \u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2019m just blowing it out of proportions and it\u2019s probably nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I repeated. \u201cJust spit it out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. While you were in there, the old man asked to speak with Clarkson. Alone.\u201d She raised her brows meaningfully. \u201cI found it a little strange and followed them to a room down the hall.\u201d Nothing strange about a client wanting to talk with his lawyer in private, but I didn\u2019t argue with Sylvie. She wasn\u2019t usually one to notice any sort of activity that didn\u2019t concern her so, naturally, my suspicion was roused.</p><p>\u201cWhat did they talk about?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Sylvie inched closer and peered over her shoulder as though to make sure no one was listening. \u201cThe old man asked Clarkson to make sure no one knows you\u2019re here. He also said he wanted to spend as much time as possible with you before\u2014and I quote\u2014the vultures descend upon their prey. I don\u2019t even know what that means. At least he didn\u2019t speak in Italian.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHe said that to Clarkson?\u201d</p><p>Sylvie nodded. \u201cI swear I was around the corner. They didn\u2019t know I was listening.\u201d She faked a shudder. \u201cSeriously, old people give me the creeps. They\u2019re so weird. My grandfather was like that. He was so paranoid of children, kept saying he could see them and hear their laughter when no one was around. I guess it comes with age.\u201d</p><p>I grimaced. The poor guy. I could only hope Sylvie\u2019s relatives were accepting of his quirks. But she was right. Paranoia was a scary disorder of the mind and not easy to deal with.</p><p>\u201cSo where\u2019s Clarkson?\u201d I asked, changing the subject.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t know. I guess still with him. What did you talk about?\u201d</p><p>I pulled out the envelope and held it out to her so she could peek inside. \u201cNothing big really. We talked about his life and the conditions of my inheritance. He made me promise not to sell the estate. Actually, he was pretty specific about that. He doesn\u2019t want me to alter it either. He also wanted to\u2014\u201d I saw Clarkson standing in the doorway to the backyard and dipped my head toward him, deciding now wasn\u2019t the right time to talk \u201c\u2014I\u2019ll show you later.\u201d I sat up and waved at Clarkson to get his attention.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s lovely here, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Clarkson said.</p><p>I nodded. \u201cI\u2019m glad Alessandro is taken care of in such a nice place.\u201d</p><p>Clarkson explained he had some business to tend to. After a short talk we agreed that he\u2019d be calling me with updates. Alessandro Lucazzone hoped to see me again in the next days and I was happy to oblige, not just as his heir but also as the last family member he had.</p> <p>Anxious, I kept glancing at my watch. With every second that passed, I was moving closer and closer to 11.45 a.m. Jett and I had agreed to meet at noon and I couldn\u2019t wait. My only problem now was getting rid of Sylvie. She wasn\u2019t his biggest fan, so there was no way I could tell her about my lunch arrangement. If she found out, she\u2019d only end up thinking I was still into him\u2014which was true\u2014and she\u2019d try to talk me out of it. Not only did I promise Jett that I wouldn\u2019t back off, but his over-protectiveness had managed to spark my interest. My sole intention was to listen to his reasons and clarify what exactly he thought put me in danger. Maybe even discover a way to heal my heart, like parting on good terms rather than in anger and pain. Only the truth can set the heart free. With knowledge I could move on, learn from my mistakes. If I was lucky, his sincere apology would be enough to make amends and help me move on. Although it wouldn\u2019t stop the pain, I was sure it could heal some of my bruised ego.</p><p>By keeping our meeting short and to the point, there was no need for my best friend to know about it. I\u2019d tell her eventually when I could deal with her angry outburst, but right now I sure wasn\u2019t going to listen to her ranting for the next hour.</p><p>So how best to distract her? Three things always managed to help Sylvie forget the world around her: fashion, men, and parties.</p><p>Considering it was late morning, the clubs were closed and Sylvie had no date, taking her shopping was my best bet, even if she probably had more clothes than Carrie Bradshaw from Sex And The City. But could I convince her to go on a shopping spree without me?</p><p>Probably not.</p><p>Throughout the first years of our friendship, Sylvie had always joked about how clingy she was. Turned out, it wasn\u2019t really that much of a joke. This left me with one other option: treat her to a spa visit.</p> <p>Sixty minutes of sighing under the expert hands of a massage therapist should provide enough distraction so I could meet with Jett. I had another problem: Alessandro was stationed at a private hospital in a secluded area far away from the city center. According to Clarkson, the bus station was a half hour walk away.</p><p>\u201cSo what now?\u201d Sylvie asked as we stepped out of the hospital. She sounded so bored already, and I hadn\u2019t even shared my plan with her. I scanned the area. The residential street was almost empty. Apart from a busy caf\u00e9 at the corner and some parked cars, there was nothing that could possibly be of interest to Sylvie or help my quest. Until my glance fell on a parked taxi on the other side of the road.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s drive back to the city,\u201d I suggested, interloping my arm with hers so I could use bodily force to push her in the right direction, if need be.</p><p>She eyed me carefully. \u201cWhy? What\u2019s there to see?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to treat you to a spa visit. I\u2019ve heard nothing but amazing things about Italian spas, and I think you should try one. Come on.\u201d</p><p>Dashing for the taxi before she could object, or the driver could decide to take off, I pulled her after me. Sylvie opened the door and we both slumped onto the backseat. I instructed the driver to take us to the hotel Jett booked me in during my first trip to Italy. As he drove off I sat back in my seat.</p><p>\u201cNew city, new scene, and you\u2019re already forgetting Jett. My work\u2019s almost done,\u201d Sylvie said.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d I cringed inwardly at hearing his name. She couldn\u2019t be farther from the truth. If only she knew. It was impossible to forget him, not least because he was here.</p> <p>By taxi we reached the city in less than ten minutes. As it turned out the driver would have made a great sightseeing guide. Speaking half English and half Italian, he recalled everything he knew about Bellagio\u2019s history and ancient buildings. It wasn\u2019t exactly Rome, but I listened nonetheless and even Sylvie seemed fascinated. As we cruised down the busy main street, the driver pointed out the designer shops and even recommended the best places to get a bargain. Not that Sylvie needed to save cash. She had always been loaded\u2014courtesy of her rich family whom she actually despised. But what woman is immune to the prospect of a mid-summer sale?</p><p>Eventually the taxi stopped on a bus lane. I paid quickly and we got out in front of the large sign advertising the spa hotel I had stayed at on my first trip to Bellagio.</p><p>\u201cNot bad,\u201d Sylvie said, looking up at the impressive building.</p><p>\u201cGood choice, huh?\u201d I beamed at her and dragged her through the glass doors into the marble floor reception area. The spa center took in the entire basement. I paid for a full body and facial treatment package, and the receptionist handed Sylvie a white bathrobe and towel with instructions where to get changed.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you coming?\u201d Sylvie asked.</p><p>\u201cSorry, can\u2019t.\u201d Sylvie could always look right through my lies so I averted my gaze, hoping she wouldn\u2019t catch whatever gave me away. \u201cI\u2019m supposed to do something for Alessandro. Can\u2019t explain now because I\u2019m running late, but I\u2019ll pick you up when you\u2019re done, okay?\u201d</p><p>I pecked her cheek and headed for the door before she could start her interrogation.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be late,\u201d Sylvie called after me.</p><p>\u201cHave fun,\u201d I called back. My guilt at lying to her flared up again. It was nasty, self-focused, and certainly not what real friendship stands for. I hated doing it but she wouldn\u2019t understand. I had to find out what Jett had to say.</p><p>Outside the hotel I glanced at my watch. It was 12.30 p.m. I was running half an hour late. I fished my phone out of my bag and switched it on with trepidation at the outlook of calling him to pick me up. The screen came to life with the usual swirls of colors. Three bars loaded together with a welcome message from an Italian service provider. I scrolled through my contact list when the text messages and call notifications began to come in one after another.</p><p>Holy.</p><p>Cow.</p><p>Ninety-eight messages. And all from Jett.</p><p>And then the phone started to vibrate and the display showed his caller ID.</p><p>I pressed the response button and held the earpiece to my ear.</p><p>\u201cWhat did I tell you about switching on your goddamn phone, Brooke?\u201d His deep voice thundered down the line. I gasped at just how amazingly sexy he sounded. He seemed slightly annoyed, but I could sense a hint of amusement in his tone. \u201cHave you forgotten about our meeting?\u201d</p><p>The idea that he still thought he was entitled to treat me like he was my boss annoyed me. If he could play this game, so could I.</p><p>\u201cSorry, is it noon already?\u201d I faked a surprised pause, making sure I sounded sarcastic. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize. It\u2019s been such a busy day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d His voice changed, became softer. Did I detect a hint of jealousy?</p><p>\u201cWhere are you? You were supposed to be at the bus station in front of the club.\u201d</p><p>I communicated my location.</p><p>\u201cOkay, wait there. I\u2019ll have you picked up. The driver will be there in five.\u201d</p><p>And with that he disconnected, leaving me more nervous than before. Was it really such a good idea to meet with him? Probably not but, damn, I wasn\u2019t going to back off now.</p><p>Chapter 7</p><p>The waiter led me through an almost empty restaurant, then up a broad staircase. Soft voices and the noise of cutlery carried over from what I assumed was the kitchen area somewhere below us, but apart from that nothing really stirred. I peered around me, wondering why a restaurant in a famous tourist area would be so unusually quiet at this time of day.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d I asked the waiter. He continued to walk, ignoring my question, which led me to believe he either didn\u2019t understand me, or he was following specific instructions not to answer any questions. I clamped my mouth shut, both confused and fascinated. Surprises weren\u2019t my thing, however I had to admit this one was more than interesting.</p><p>We passed through a closed off dining room on the second floor which\u2014by the look of it\u2014was probably reserved for special events and wedding parties. To our left, chairs were stacked on top of the tables. To my right, the whole wall was made of glass, allowing a clear view of the blue sky and the mountain backdrop. Soft Italian music played in the background\u2014not loud enough to be intrusive, but loud enough to give a romantic flair. The waiter slid the terrace doors open and guided me out onto a panoramic patio decorated with flowers. In the middle, near the white stone balustrade, were a table and two chairs, the white brocade tablecloth shimmering unnaturally bright in the sunlight and building a beautiful contrast to the crystal vase holding pink roses. A bottle of champagne was perched between ice cubes in a silver bucket next to two champagne flutes. I swallowed hard to get rid of the sudden dryness in my throat.</p><p>Holy shit.</p><p>Did Jett pay to have the restaurant closed off to everyone but us? And I thought by agreeing to just having lunch with him I could avoid exactly this kind of shocker. From the way the roses were arranged, to the fine tablecloth and sparkling glass and cutlery, I could tell someone had mulled over every detail. It would have been the perfect spot for a marriage proposal.</p><p>A proposal, Stewart? Really?</p><p>I snorted at the mad and absolutely irrational direction my thoughts were taking. Obviously I was still the hopeless romantic, and yet I didn\u2019t quite want to be in love. Not to mention the fact that I barely knew anything about Jett and his life, while I had already told him everything about me and my life. The good, the bad, and the horrible.</p><p>\u201cLike it?\u201d Jett whispered behind me.</p><p>As usual, my abdomen twisted and knotted at the sound of his voice, and my heart began to beat faster like a helpless butterfly in a glass cage. I spun around and smiled at Jett, barely able to keep my eyes off him. He was dressed in a V-neck shirt and tight jeans that barely managed to hide the perfect sculpting of his hard muscles. The sunlight caught in his eyes, reminding me of dark-green gemstones. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Oh.</p><p>God.</p><p>Oh god. He was stunning.</p><p>No. He was sinfully perfect, from his dark hair to the way his mouth twitched at the corners whenever he was about to smile.</p> <p>Tiny butterflies came to life in the pit of my stomach. I wanted to hate him so much, to be done with him once and for all, because in some way he was like a drug\u2014the more I tasted him, the more I became addicted. But the way he smiled at me, and the way he cocked his head to the side, expecting my reaction upon seeing him, reminded me that I was human. Weak. Prone to making mistakes. And I could only hope I wasn\u2019t about to make yet another one. Because in the end\u2014no matter how much I liked him or he liked me\u2014he was still Jett Mayfield. The man who played dirty. The man who played me.</p><p>My knees weakened and my mouth turned dry as he moved toward me\u2014so confident in his stride\u2014until he was close enough to touch me. I inhaled the earthy scent of his aftershave and let it slowly engulf my mind.</p><p>A sexy smile played on his lips. His green eyes looked alluring in the sunlight. The beginning of a stubble shadowed his tan skin, making me want to run my fingers over it. I turned away from him and toward the clear blue lake because it was easier than looking at him. There was still so much pain inside stemming from his actions and the realization that if he hadn\u2019t lied, if he hadn\u2019t tried to trick me, we might still be together. There might still be an us.</p><p>\u201cBrooke.\u201d His voice was deep and strained. Guarded. Ignoring my disturbing attraction to him, I leaned over the balustrade as far as I could and took a deep breath as I tried to control the turmoil inside me. I might not be able to shake it all off, but I wasn\u2019t going to show him just how big a soft spot I still had for him either.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you could come. I thought this would be the ideal place to meet and talk.\u201d He touched the small of my back, oblivious to the storm raging inside me, reminding me how gentle he was. How amazing we once were together.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t expect this.\u201d I turned to face him and our gazes interlocked, making my knees go weak.</p><p>\u201cYou said you wanted a public place. I believe the exact words were \u2018outside, where anyone can see us.\u201d He leaned against the railing and shot me an amused look that brought with it the most gorgeous dimples. Dimples that made you wish you would drown in them.</p><p>I crossed my arms over my chest, as if the action could put some distance between us.</p><p>\u201cYeah, but I meant having other people around, Jett. Lots of people. Think fast-food chain.\u201d Being seen wasn\u2019t much of a put-off to him. He had made that pretty clear on the lakeshore.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with the people present?\u201d He nodded at the waiter, amused.</p><p>I heaved a sigh in mock exasperation. Whatever I said, my arguments were lost. I had given in to his request to talk and was ready to listen. But I could already tell coming here was a mistake. The place was too beautiful; too perfect. Away from the distractions of a club or the people employed in his office, any ounce of determination to fight the stupid attraction between us dissipated into thin air.</p> <p>\u201cYou wanted to see me, so let\u2019s get to the point,\u201d I said. \u201cWhat did you want to talk about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s have lunch first.\u201d His tone left no room for discussion. \u201cWe\u2019ll talk later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d Hungry as I was I didn\u2019t argue with that, even though I doubted I\u2019d be able to swallow more than a few bites in his presence. Jett guided me to my chair and held it for me. I slid into the seat, whispering a thank you. He sat down opposite from me and then we were gazing at each other again, soaking in each other\u2019s presence over the small table\u2014the way we had ever since our fateful meeting in a club, which wasn\u2019t quite as accidental as I initially thought.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I get you to drink?\u201d the waiter asked, startling me.</p><p>\u201cChampagne,\u201d Jett said.</p><p>\u201cFor me water, please.\u201d</p><p>Jett raised a puzzled brow, but didn\u2019t comment.</p><p>\u201cWhy champagne?\u201d I asked him as soon as the waiter had left to get our order. \u201dAre you trying to get me drunk?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe both know I don\u2019t take advantage of a drunken woman, even though I\u2019ve got to admit it\u2019s nice to hear all the little things that come out of your sexy mouth. You know, the things I don\u2019t get to hear when you\u2019re sober.\u201d</p><p>The telltale heat of a blush rushed to my face. Jett had seen me drunk at least twice. Every time he made sure I got home safely, and every time I told him, in my drunken state, how much I wanted him. It seemed like my subconscious was programmed to reveal the truth regarding how I felt about him\u2014whether I wanted it, or not.</p><p>\u201cI have sworn off alcohol.\u201d I watched him take a thin bread stick and break it into two, then hand me one while he kept the other half. \u201cThanks,\u201d I mumbled, nibbling on one end. \u201cIt makes me say stupid things I don\u2019t mean.\u201d</p><p>He snorted as he took a bite. \u201cI doubt that.\u201d</p><p>For some reason, his statement annoyed me. Probably, because he was right. Yet, it brought up an issue that had me occupied for longer than I cared to admit.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you lie to me, Jett?\u201d</p><p>He hesitated, avoiding my gaze. A moment later the waiter appeared with a trolley carrying our drinks and various dishes. He set the drinks in front of us and wished us \u201cBuon appetite,\u201d and then he was gone again.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know what you wanted, so I ordered everything on the menu,\u201d Jett said, not answering my question. I tried to ignore the various delicacies on the trolley, which was hard because everything\u2014including Jett\u2014looked so delicious. My stomach rumbled, reminding me I hadn\u2019t eaten since breakfast.</p><p>I watched him pile a little of everything onto a plate before handing it to me. I took it from him but didn\u2019t touch the food.</p><p>He noticed me watching him and sighed. I began to tap my foot impatiently, asking the obvious question with a mere raise of my eyebrows.</p><p>\u201cI know you want answers but can we eat first?\u201d He pointed at my plate. I eyed the food as I contemplated whether to give in to his plea, or remain stubborn in my decision to get this over and done with.</p><p>\u201cPlease. I\u2019ll explain later,\u201d Jett said slowly, his electrifying eyes piercing a hole into my soul.</p><p>There was something in his voice: hope that we wouldn\u2019t end up fighting. Hope to avoid the inevitable\u2014the countless questions demanding honest answers. Whatever those answers were, I had a nagging feeling I\u2019d need a strong stomach to deal with them, so I grabbed my fork and popped a cube of white cheese into my mouth, chewing slowly. It tasted delicious, of fresh milk and herbs. I took another one, followed by what looked like a meatball tasting of peppers and olives.</p><p>I looked up when he lifted his fork and helped himself\u2014from the same plate. The gesture was so intimate it made my heart skip a beat.</p><p>Too intimate.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t what two strangers did.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re damn sexy when you eat,\u201d Jett whispered. \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re not one of those anorexic girls on a diet.\u201d</p><p>I almost choked on my bite but continued to eat as if we were having a business conversation. \u201cI don\u2019t believe in diets.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s not just your attitude I like. I love the way you get lost in every new sensation. You show the same passion when you\u2019re under me.\u201d</p><p>Good gracious.</p><p>Red flags began to flash somewhere in the back of my mind. He was beginning to flirt with me, piling on the sexy compliments, which\u2014given Jett and our history\u2014wasn\u2019t a good sign.</p><p>Before I could stop him, he leaned forward and brushed his thumb over my lips and then sucked the tip of it into his mouth. I took a sharp breath and forced myself to let it out slowly.</p><p>In his absence, I had prepared all those kickass comebacks that would kick his ego to the curb. In my head I knew what I wanted to say and how to infuse just the right amount of sarcasm into it. Sitting in front of him, an arrogant, self-assured smile reflected in his eyes, my wit sort of dried up, and I found myself staring like an idiot, fighting for words while my brain remained surprisingly blank and my insides turned all mushy.</p><p>Dammit, I couldn\u2019t think of anything to say. Worse yet, I could barely breathe because of the delicious pull between my legs. My panties were beginning to melt just from watching him do normal stuff, reminding me of all the pleasure he and his fingers had once bestowed upon me. The awareness came to me that I could sleep with him anytime. Pull him to me, yank his shirt open, run my fingers down his chest to the happy trail I had once been more than eager to explore.</p><p>His sexy smile widened. As if he knew what I was thinking.</p><p>Damn him and his gorgeous body!</p><p>Damn him and his flirting!</p><p>Thankfully, our waiter arrived to ask whether we needed anything else. For a moment I seriously considered asking the waiter to stay during the rest of our lunch. Figuring that might be a little too awkward, I resisted the urge and watched the waiter leave again.</p><p>I was a grown woman, for crying out loud. I didn\u2019t need to hide behind anyone\u2019s back because I couldn\u2019t deal with a hot guy. Or maybe I could.</p><p>Play it cool and play it cold, Stewart!</p><p>\u201cJett, I want you to forget what happened between us,\u201d I started, my tone infused with as much frostiness as I could muster. \u201cIt\u2019s over. We can\u2019t go back to how things used to be.\u201d</p><p>Jett\u2019s eyebrows shot up. \u201cIt\u2019s never over. Not until every fight has been lost. And for you, I\u2019d fight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to fight for. You\u2019re not getting the estate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI already told you it\u2019s not about the estate, Brooke. This is about us. About your safety.\u201d His voice came low and dark. Like a menacing warning that he wasn\u2019t going to give up.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need your protection. He\u2019s just an old man. What can he do to me?\u201d</p><p>Hesitating, Jett put down his fork and crossed his arms over his broad chest. \u201cIt\u2019s not that simple.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen explain. I want to understand.\u201d</p><p>He took a sip of my drink before putting the glass down slowly, leaving his untouched. Hiding my annoyance at the intimate gesture, I wondered whether he was trying to make a point by helping himself, like wanting to say that what belonged to me belonged to him. Seriously, could he turn more caveman-like on me? My blood began to boil in my veins. It started to boil harder when he touched my hand. His fingers began to trace circles on the back of my hand, slowly but with just the right amount of pressure\u2014the way he used to do when we were still together.</p><p>How the heck can you explain to a guy that it\u2019s over when you\u2019re having a hard time convincing yourself? Why is telling others what they have to do always simpler than applying your own advice in practice?</p><p>\u201cTell me what\u2019s going on. I want to understand,\u201d I said, pulling my hand away from him. \u201cThat\u2019s the only reason I\u2019m here. Why do you think I\u2019m in danger?\u201d</p><p>I leaned back in my chair, regarding him coolly. The more I thought about this, the more his assumptions seemed ludicrous. Scary, yes, because Jett was persuasive. But still absurd.</p><p>\u201cLike I said, Alessandro\u2019s just an old man. What do you think he could possibly do to me from a hospital bed where he\u2019s dying, Jett?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He frowned and a shadow crossed his features. I honestly thought he was going to start talking...until he lifted his fork again and began to eat, taking all the time in the world.</p><p>I groaned.</p><p>Damn!</p><p>He did it again\u2014ignoring me. Letting me wait on purpose just because he felt like being in control.</p> <p>Assessing. Testing.</p><p>Testing what?</p><p>I felt like leaning over that table and shaking some sense into him. Maybe even strangle him while I was at it, because his reasoning, or lack thereof, made no sense to me, and I was slowly losing my patience at his reticence.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not just Lucazzone I\u2019m talking about. It\u2019s the elite club he belonged to,\u201d he said slowly. \u201cMy father, Robert, was involved many years ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat club?\u201d I eyed him carefully, sensing the sudden change in the air.</p> <p>Jett sighed and ran a hand through his tousled dark hair. His gloomy expression reflected the countless emotions fighting to gain control inside. In the end his shoulders slumped like he\u2019d made a decision he didn\u2019t want to make, but his dark expression didn\u2019t change.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you everything I know, okay?\u201d Jett said. \u201cBut I want you to just listen and listen carefully. Whatever I say today doesn\u2019t leave this table. You cannot tell anyone.\u201d</p><p>The sharp edge in his tone instantly raised my alertness. He grabbed my hand and gave it a hard squeeze until I nodded, silently giving him my word.</p><p>\u201cA few years back, Alessandro Lucazzone was involved in my father\u2019s business. It was for a brief time and he was never officially listed as a shareholder, so I couldn\u2019t figure out why my father would let him make the decisions he made\u2014decisions that cost us millions. I stumbled upon it when I checked our financial reports dating back to my time at college. A few weeks ago, Robert finally came clean and admitted something that could harm the company.\u201d</p><p>Jett paused and his eyes narrowed, the angry line between his eyebrows saying more than a thousand words. His grip on my hand tightened, hurting me just a little, but I didn\u2019t pull back. \u201cThey were both involved in this sort of elite club. You know, drugs and kinky sex practices, and lots of people to be paid off to keep quiet. My father and quite a few people\u2014many of them rich and famous\u2014were addicted to that stuff and paid whoever hosted the events millions. In my father\u2019s case, he paid it out of the company\u2019s accounts. When I joined the business the company was on the verge of liquidation, in which case we would have lost everything. I\u2019ve pulled in enough business to keep us afloat for a while. But one wrong decision and it\u2019s all over the media, and we\u2019ll end up losing major deals and our good reputation. If anyone finds out, the company\u2019s done. You were right about everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand. Right about what?\u201d I had a hard time following him and the sudden change in tone didn\u2019t exactly help. His gaze settled on me, imploring me to understand. His hand squeezed mine again, silently asking me to relate, to feel his emotions, or maybe to believe him.</p> <p>\u201cRobert thought by buying the Lucazzone estate he could save the company. I first agreed it was a good idea because the land is valued at much more than we initially offered and tourists flood in every year. I thought, why not try to sell it as the next St. Tropez or Kitzbuhel?\u201d He began to massage his temples.</p><p>\u201cBut you increased your offer. It was a huge gamble. You could have lost a lot of money,\u201d I whispered, my head still spinning around the words \u2018sex practices\u2019 and \u2018elite club.\u2019 It sounded like a bad Hollywood movie.</p><p>\u201cI was against paying more because, like you, I know when the risk\u2019s too high but he wanted it and in the end it\u2019s still his company. After meeting you, that wasn\u2019t what worried me. I was afraid that once the people involved learned of your inheritance, they\u2019d come after you to make sure you wouldn\u2019t find out their secret and talk.\u201d</p><p>His hands cupped my face, forcing me to look at him. \u201cDo you understand what I\u2019m saying?\u201d</p><p>I nodded, but not because I understood. He was nervous. I could feel tension wafting from him in strong waves. The glint in his eyes scared the hell out of me.</p><p>\u201cYou said \u2018club,\u2019\u201d I began slowly. \u201cAre we talking about a few kinky preferences like a bit of BDMS or\u2014\u201d</p><p>He shook his head gravely and let go of my face but didn\u2019t break eye contact.</p><p>\u201cAll I know is that they\u2019ve been fanatic about keeping their identities protected, which leads me to assume there was more to it than that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWow.\u201d I bit my lip hard, barely feeling the pain. \u201cWhere did the meetings take place?\u201d</p><p>A grimace crossed his face and a silent look passed between us. He didn\u2019t have to tell me that it was the Lucazzone estate.</p><p>\u201cAccording to my father, many powerful people were involved,\u201d Jett said. \u201cHe made it clear that many of them would stop at nothing to keep their preferences hidden from the public.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut why would they think I\u2019d know anything about them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re the heiress. You\u2019re expected to inherit Lucazzone\u2019s secrets and no one knows the specifics. They\u2019re probably scared. I know I\u2019d be.\u201d His expression remained earnest, but the sudden caginess in his voice didn\u2019t escape me.</p><p>\u201cYou were never involved?\u201d I tried to instill nonchalance into my voice, like his past didn\u2019t matter. After all, we didn\u2019t know each other back then, so it wasn\u2019t really my concern. But it mattered. I didn\u2019t want him to be some pervert.</p><p>Shooting me a dirty look, he took a deep breath and let it out slowly. The way his fingers began to tap on the table told me he was having a hard time keeping his annoyance under control.</p><p>I raised my chin a notch and regarded him stubbornly. \u201cWere you\u2014\u201d</p><p>Jett cut me off. \u201cI heard you the first time and I\u2019m fucking pissed you\u2019d ever think that of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t. I\u2014\u201d My throat constricted at the angry glint in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck, Brooke? I thought you knew me.\u201d His voice came so low I had a hard time understanding him, which was worse than yelling. It made me feel bad\u2014disappointed in myself\u2014even though I had no reason to be.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know you because we\u2019ve barely scratched the surface of your life,\u201d I said warily. My heart was beating a million miles an hour. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. It was just an innocent question. Anyone would ask the same thing, given the circumstances.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGiven the circumstances.\u201d His jaw set. He pulled his hand away and leaned back in his chair, putting as much distance between us as our sitting arrangement allowed.</p><p>He was angry and I couldn\u2019t blame him.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to be accusatory,\u201d I said. \u201cIt was just a question, Jett.\u201d</p><p>He laughed slowly, still avoiding my gaze. I scanned his beautiful face. His scowl didn\u2019t distract from his beauty; it just made him look different, and I realized I really didn\u2019t know much about him.</p><p>\u201cI wish I knew you better,\u201d I said softly. \u201cThe real you\u2014not the mask you\u2019re putting on to hide what\u2019s inside.\u201d</p><p>His cloud of anger lifted just a little bit. \u201cI\u2019d love another date.\u201d</p><p>I laughed at his impudence. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever you call it, I\u2019d love another one of those.\u201d He cocked his head, giving me the kind of smile I had been waiting for all day.</p><p>No, Stewart. Don\u2019t you dare!</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not asking you.\u201d The corners of lips curled upward. \u201cIf you say \u2018no\u2019 then you leave me no choice than to do the next stupid thing, like kidnapping you because I want to earn your trust. I want to make things right again. What do you say?\u201d</p><p>My heart skipped a beat and I had no idea whether it was because Jett\u2019s strong grip on me sent naughty thoughts through my head. Or because his threat both scared and fascinated me.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t mean it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry me.\u201d No smile. No blinking. Just pure, raw determination to get his way.</p><p>I swallowed down the big lump in my throat. This was supposed to be a formal meeting. Nothing too intense. Yet here I was, tempted to give him another chance, knowing I might be heading down a self-destructive path.</p><p>\u201cYour whole story sounds kind of far-fetched, Jett. You don\u2019t have any real proof. Everything\u2019s based on assumptions. Give me one good reason why I should believe you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s the truth.\u201d He didn\u2019t hesitate; didn\u2019t even blink. \u201cI was never involved, Brooke. That\u2019s not the kind of person I am, and I hope one day you\u2019ll know that deep in your heart.\u201d</p><p>Maybe, but that time hadn\u2019t come yet. Jett was a convincing person who might or might not tell the truth. I needed proof before I was ready to trust him again.</p><p>I checked the time on my cellphone and brushed my hands over my skirt the way I always did when I was about to leave.</p><p>\u201cI have to go. It\u2019s getting late and Sylvie\u2019s expecting me in ten minutes.\u201d It wasn\u2019t a lie. Without waiting for his reply, I grabbed my bag and stood, wondering why I wasn\u2019t as pleased with our meeting as I initially thought I would be.</p><p>Maybe because he hasn\u2019t given you any real answers.</p><p>True. In fact I ended up with more questions than before, and I didn\u2019t like it one bit.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re amazing, you know that?\u201d Jett walked around the table and stopped in front of me, his height intimidating me, as usual. My eyes lingered on his lips. So close. So delicious. I held my breath as he brushed a stray strand of hair out of my face. His touch sent a shiver through me, making me all too aware of just how close we were standing. My heartbeat started to drum in my ears. I had experienced this feeling before\u2014at the office back in New York the day I broke up with him, thinking I had lost him forever. Right before he told me that he loved me.</p><p>His lips moved just a little bit closer to mine, hovering inches away. Not too close but enough to make me aware of his manly scent and the sudden tension in the air. Aware that even though he had explained his reasons, it was still over.</p><p>\u201cYou really are amazing, Brooke,\u201d he repeated.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you telling me this?\u201d I almost choked on my words.</p><p>\u201cBecause I should have told you before, when you would\u2019ve still believed me. And I should have told you as often as I could so you\u2019d never forget.\u201d</p><p>Damn him and his ability to say the right things at the right time. I didn\u2019t want to fall for him any deeper than I had already. He was gaining the upper hand again, turning the table on me.</p><p>\u201cJett please, just stop.\u201d I blinked back the telltale moisture gathering in the corners of my eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Because you broke my heart once, and there\u2019s no guarantee you won\u2019t do it again.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe you, Jett. Everything you said\u2014I just can\u2019t believe you anymore. Not until you give me proof.\u201d It was the truth. Even if I wanted to, I couldn\u2019t trust him. \u201cI should never have come here. Sylvie was right when she warned me about you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNot everyone\u2019s hell bent on screwing you over, Brooke. Some people genuinely care about you.\u201d I turned away but he grabbed my shoulders, forcing me to face him. \u201cIf you want to know the truth, don\u2019t ask a friend who\u2019ll tell you only what you want to hear. Check the facts and you\u2019ll see that, yes, I made a mistake, but I\u2019m telling you the truth when I say I only tried to protect you.\u201d</p><p>I yanked my hand away from him. Awkward silence ensued. I knew I had hit a soft spot. I could see it in his face, in his eyes, the way he moistened his lips, pondering his next move. Eventually, he let out a frustrated groan.</p><p>\u201cI lied to you one time when I didn\u2019t know you. Before we decided to have a relationship. I know I did many things wrong, but I never stopped caring about you.\u201d</p><p>A liar is known to tell many lies but the one who speaks the truth will always stick to the same story. It was a universal knowledge I had embraced many years ago. In this case, however, the truth scared me. What if he cared about me but not enough to avoid hurting me again?</p> <p>\u201cI need to go, Jett.\u201d I checked the time on my cellphone again, silently praying he\u2019d let me go. I was no match for him if he didn\u2019t. He stepped back but his gaze never left me.</p><p>I made my way across the terrace and down the stairs, minding my steps as Jett followed behind. I reached the waiting taxi in a few long strides. His strong grip on my upper arm told me our conversation wasn\u2019t over and, as usual, he was about to fight for the last word.</p><p>\u201cBrooke. We never had a real date.\u201d His eyes were two glowing pits of smoldering heat. I had never seen so much determination in anyone. Then again, I had probably never seen the real Jett. \u201cIn spite of everything that happened and what I explained to you today, would you go on a date with me? I\u2019m not asking you to trust me. I know that takes time. I\u2019m asking you to give me a chance to earn that trust and make things right again.\u201d</p><p>My heart hammered in my chest. The attraction was still here, coursing back and forth between us like an intangible current. \u201cI would. Just prove your claims are true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey are. Even if you don\u2019t understand things now, sooner or later you\u2019ll find out I never meant to hurt you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI still need evidence,\u201d I said coolly, holding on to my determination for dear life.</p><p>\u201cAnd then you\u2019ll give me a chance to redeem myself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d It sounded fair enough. With proof I could understand his motives. \u201cI really have to go now. Sylvie\u2019s waiting for me.\u201d</p><p>His smile returned with full force and brought with it the most gorgeous dimples. I held my breath as his mouth came closer. But instead of kissing me, he whispered in my ear, \u201cI\u2019m still thinking of you. Even though everything\u2019s messed up, I still want you by my side. I still want to be with you, within you, inside you, hearing you panting my name.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 8</p><p>I had never been one to deal with emotions easily. My heart was racing, my mind was spinning, and my body was floating in a vacuum as Jett drove me back to the spa. After our conversation and the few unexpected turns it took, I didn\u2019t know what to believe or think and, most importantly, I didn\u2019t know what to say to him when letting my guard down wasn\u2019t an option.</p> <p>\u201cThanks for lunch.\u201d My hand hovered on the door handle but something kept me from pulling it open.</p><p>\u201cMy pleasure,\u201d Jett said softly. His gaze was focused on me, like always, but there was something in his eyes that made me instantly aware of the confined space we were in. He dominated everything: my thoughts, my space, even the air I breathed. My breath hitched. He was too close for comfort and I couldn\u2019t get away fast enough.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I have to leave.\u201d Without so much as a glance back I sprinted out of the car, heading for the safety of the spa\u2019s salon.</p><p>As I pushed the heavy glass doors open, I could feel his stare burning a hole in my back. Only once I was inside the reception area did I dare stop and take a deep breath, searching for him across the street, but the car had already sped off. I didn\u2019t know whether to feel relieved or disappointed. Either way, I had to conceal it because Sylvie had the keen eye of a hawk. The second she got suspicious, she\u2019d commence her interrogation.</p><p>Luckily for me, Sylvie\u2019s treatment wasn\u2019t finished for another ten minutes. I left a message with the receptionist in case I wouldn\u2019t be back on time and took off down the busy main street, through the gathered crowds of midday shoppers and tourists. Even though my eyes could see them, my brain continued to be occupied. Jett\u2019s statements about the club bothered me. I was ready to take his warnings seriously and investigate his claims. My thoughts circled back to Jett and the fact that the spark was still there.</p><p>What did you expect, Stewart?</p><p>I rolled my eyes at my own stupidity. The kind of attraction we shared wasn\u2019t likely to go away on its own within a few days. Deep down I had known this all along, and yet I still agreed to have lunch with him.</p><p>If you really wanted to move on, you could have done so with someone else\u2014find a rebound, just like Sylvie. But you didn\u2019t. You reserved a place in your heart for Jett, and you don\u2019t want to fill it with someone else. You want him and you need to see if you can take things slowly. You\u2019re ready to chase away the demons of your past and make room for a future with him.</p> <p>I stopped at a tiny corner caf\u00e9 that sold gelato cones and freshly made smoothies, and bought two plastic cups of watermelon frappe before returning to the spa. Sylvie was typing furiously on her phone when I reached her and handed her a cup. Her face was glowing and she seemed relaxed. I breathed out, relieved.</p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Thanks.\u201d She pointed at her watermelon frappe and took a sip as we walked out onto the street. \u201cYou were right. It was amazing. Such a shame you couldn\u2019t come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d I shot her a smile.</p><p>\u201cHow did it go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. The shops kept me busy,\u201d I said. \u201cWanna grab lunch?\u201d</p><p>Her entire expression changed within an instant. \u201cI thought you were supposed to do something for the old man.\u201d</p><p>Shoot, I completely forgot about my lie.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t find what I came for,\u201d I said, grimacing. \u201cI\u2019ll get it tomorrow. But wait until you see the shops around here. They\u2019re shop-till-you-drop-worthy.\u201d</p><p>Shit, I sounded so guilty I might as well stamp the words \u2018I\u2019m hiding something\u2019 across my forehead.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a pizza restaurant not far from here.\u201d Leaving the invitation open, I took a sip of my frappe and directed my vision at the next window display, pretending to admire a pair of what looked like brown riding boots with fringes. From her reflection I could tell she was still watching me with an annoyed frown. I hoped she couldn\u2019t smell fear because my hands had begun to sweat and certainly not from the heat.</p><p>\u201cGreat. I\u2019m starving,\u201d she said.</p><p>Within five minutes, we were seated at a piazza table, sipping water as we contemplated the Italian menu.</p><p>\u201cAre you trying to memorize your order?\u201d Sylvie asked me.</p><p>\u201cAs a matter of fact, I am. Wanna help me?\u201d I smiled and waved the waiter over to get our orders. He jotted it down and then I was alone with her again. My smile froze in place as my mind tried hard to come up with something to talk about, when all I wanted to do was lock myself in my room and obsess about my lunch with Jett.</p><p>Sylvie eyed me with a frown. \u201cYou\u2019re a little quiet. Is everything okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. No. I\u2019m having this headache. Must be the heat.\u201d I wasn\u2019t lying. My head was pounding hard and I didn\u2019t know whether it was because of the sun, the tension, or a little bit of everything.</p><p>Sylvie opened her bag and fished out a small bottle of aspirin, pushing it across the table. \u201cTake two. We can\u2019t afford you getting sick.\u201d</p><p>Literally. I had no job and no health insurance.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d I swallowed two pills and rinsed the bitter aftertaste with a few gulps of water. While Sylvie left to use the restroom, the waiter brought our pizzas. I mouthed a heavily accented \u2018grazie\u2019 when the screen of my phone buzzed to life. I checked the caller. The number was private. Almost expecting Jett, I pressed the earpiece to my ear.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>An instant later, the line went dead. I frowned.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d Sylvie slumped into her chair and grabbed a slice of pizza. \u201cWho was it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>She took a big bite and pointed at the phone.</p><p>I waved my hand. \u201cWrong number.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou get phone calls abroad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparently.\u201d</p><p>I bit into a slice of pizza and began to chew, my appetite slowly returning as Sylvie resumed her chat about her impressions of Italy and god knows what. Thankfully, she was a bit of an entertainer and never needed much input from me to lead a conversation. As I struggled to listen, my headache improved but didn\u2019t go away, and Sylvie eventually suggested we drive back to the estate.</p><p>The afternoon sun stood high, raising the temperature by a few more degrees. By the time we made it back it was 5 p.m. and still hot as a desert.</p><p>I lay down on my bed as Sylvie changed into her bikini, eager to deepen her tan. \u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t want to come?\u201d She was standing in the middle of my room, slapping half a bottle of sunscreen on her already tanned body.</p><p>I shook my head, wincing at the jolts of pain blurring my vision. \u201cNo, you go and have fun. I\u2019ll just sleep this off.\u201d</p><p>A worried frown appeared on her face. \u201cWant me to get you anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d I managed a fake smile and shooed her out the door.</p><p>\u201cIt must be the heat. If you need anything, just call.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, sweetie,\u201d I whispered, leaning back against the cool satin sheets. Sylvie was right. I most certainly wasn\u2019t accustomed to the Italian weather. In the silence and the serenity of this place, my dizziness slowly cleared until I felt confident enough to stand.</p><p>I pulled the brocade curtains aside. The sun was setting in countless shades of orange and copper streaking the evening sky. From the distance, I could make out Sylvie\u2019s naked legs on an outdoor lounger facing the lake, her face obscured by a huge straw hat. Shrugging out of my skirt and into a pair of jeans, I figured I could either join her or do what I\u2019d been waiting to do ever since Jett told me about the club. If it was the truth, there had to be some evidence somewhere.</p><p>This was my opportunity. I walked down the stairs, passed the kitchen and the living room, reached the door to the backyard, and stepped out into the fragrant evening air. My heart began to hammer against my ribcage, which was silly. The property was built on a hill, surrounded by thousands of acres of land. Even if I stumbled upon the one place mentioned in Jett\u2019s reports, it was most unlikely I\u2019d discover what others had already found when they combed the estate in Alessandro\u2019s absence\u2014and lost again. But the chapel, where Jett\u2019s private detective had once located Maria Lucazzone\u2019s diary, was my only lead.</p><p>Lost in my thoughts I scanned the area. According to Jett\u2019s report, Alessandro had hundreds of miles of vineyards, forests and fields, not including the beautiful backyard. Standing here on the foot of the stairs, I couldn\u2019t stop being impressed. The garden\u2014although a little neglected\u2014was still stunning, with tiny gravel stones building a strong contrast to the myriad of blooming flowers, and with palm and needle trees shielding the estate from prying eyes. This side of the house was surrounded by woods and mountains as far as I could see. I figured if someone wanted to hide a chapel, the tall trees would make it impossible to spy. It was the perfect place if you sought privacy. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I crossed the backyard and climbed down the steep stairs snaking toward the woods. I didn\u2019t have to look very far. Behind the huge palm trees and a dried up stone well, I could make out a gray building barely the size of a garden shed. If it wasn\u2019t for its old fashioned stone walls and a hardly noticeable cross on the roof, I would have shrugged it off as such. Maybe whoever built it meant to create a chapel that was inconspicuous. Or maybe, after Maria died, no one ever cared to get rid of the overgrown vegetation obstructing the narrow trail leading to it. Either way I didn\u2019t mind fighting my way through the bushes.</p><p>I was almost there when I heard a female voice calling out my name. My head snapped in the direction of the house.</p><p>\u201cBrooke. Where are you? Help me.\u201d</p><p>Judging from the urgency and choice of words, it sounded like an emergency. The chapel would have to wait. Without a glance back, I dashed for the house, my brain coming up with a million bad things that might have happened.</p> <p>\u201cFuck, Brooke. It hurts so much. I can\u2019t stand it.\u201d Sylvie was hysterical, shouting from the kitchen bench. As usual she was being melodramatic\u2014and loving it. At least she wasn\u2019t crying.</p><p>\u201cFor heaven\u2019s sake. Stop being a pussy,\u201d I ordered as I focused on removing a splinter from her left foot with a pair of tweezers. \u201cIt\u2019s not like I\u2019m sawing off your foot.\u201d</p><p>The piece of wooden splinter was so tiny I had to use a needle to push it around. We had tried softening the skin with water and soap and then with alcohol, but it was in too deep. Finally, after what felt like an eternity, I managed to grip the end of the splitter and, pushing against it with the needle, I raised it enough to pull it out with the tweezers.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d Sylvie rubbed her sore foot, her other leg dangling from the bench. \u201cI was walking barefoot in the grass when I stepped on a branch. Where have you been? I had to hop around the house on one foot and managed to hurt my ankle in the process.\u201d</p><p>I handed the tweezers back to her, mentally searching for an excuse. Of course I could tell Sylvie about the chapel and Jett\u2019s claims because she was my best friend, the only one I really trusted. But what was the point in scaring her based on nothing but assumptions? Besides, I wasn\u2019t ready to tell her about my lunch with Jett. Not when I didn\u2019t yet know what to do about him.</p> <p>\u201cI was thinking of going for a walk. Did you know Alessandro has his own pool? Maybe you should use it rather than the lake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d She tested her foot tenderly, wincing, then hobbled across the kitchen and back. \u201cIt feels so much better.\u201d</p><p>I heaved a long sigh. \u201cThat\u2019s great.\u201d</p><p>Opening the fridge, I pulled out two cans of soda and handed her one. She didn\u2019t open it.</p><p>\u201cWhen are you going to see him again?\u201d Sylvie asked.</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d I blinked in confusion. Jett had been on my mind for hours, and for a moment I thought she meant him\u2014until it dawned on me Sylvie had to be talking about Alessandro. \u201cI don\u2019t know. He\u2019s really sick and every day\u2019s a struggle. Clarkson expects us to stay a week, during which I hope we\u2019ll get to talk again.\u201d</p> <p>Sylvie\u2019s eyes narrowed on me. \u201cAnd then what?\u201d</p><p>Good question. \u201cTo be honest, I have no idea.\u201d I still couldn\u2019t get over the fact that this huge property would soon belong to me. The least I could do was stick around for a little bit longer, even though the initial excitement had dissipated at the outlook of living in a bizarre club\u2019s former meeting point, if not domicile.</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d Sylvie inched closer and squeezed my hands, her blue eyes searching mine. \u201cEver since we arrived here you\u2019ve been on edge. You\u2019ve always been a bit of a worrier, but I\u2019ve never seen you so absentminded and weird.\u201d In spite of her frown, her voice became softer, soothing even. \u201cI want you to come back with me. Let Clarkson deal with the estate, rent it out if you want, but this isn\u2019t you. It\u2019s not your kind of life. Why make yourself miserable just because you feel you owe someone something?\u201d</p><p>I stared at her. \u201cThat\u2019s not the case at all. I\u2019m\u2014\u201d</p><p>She grimaced and nodded. \u201cYou\u2019re a people pleaser, Brooke.\u201d</p><p>How could I tell her that, yes, I had accepted Alessandro\u2019s invitation because it was his wish to meet with me. But right now I was ready to stay because a mystery kept me here. I was intrigued and wanted to find out more about the estate and the people who once lived here. And if Jett was right, then I wouldn\u2019t be safe anywhere\u2014not here, and not back home. They would come after me. The prospect felt surreal, yet scared the crap out of me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll come back with you once I\u2019m ready,\u201d I said.</p><p>Sylvie shrugged and opened her soda can. \u201cI need to check out my Facebook page, see how my friends are doing. I\u2019ve been neglecting them.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSure.\u201d I wanted to point out that most of her neglected friends weren\u2019t people she had ever met, but I kept my thoughts to myself.</p><p>Luckily for us, Alessandro had internet access in the library, where Sylvie could use his computer. It was an old thing that took five minutes to boot with an extremely slow connection, but Sylvie had the patience of a saint when it came to maintaining her virtual social life. Closing the door behind me, I gave her the privacy she needed and retreated to my room with Alessandro\u2019s envelope. A few minutes into flicking through family photos my phone rang, and my heart started to race as Jett\u2019s name appeared on the display.</p><p>\u201cFound anything?\u201d Jett said the moment I picked up.</p><p>\u201cWell, hello to you, too.\u201d I scowled and tucked my legs beneath me on the bed, suddenly aware of how deliciously coarse the sheet felt beneath my skin. \u201cI didn\u2019t have a chance yet. How did you know I\u2019d be looking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you.\u201d There was a small pause and some shuffling. In the background I could hear people talking. And then the noise was gone, as though he had left for somewhere quiet. I didn\u2019t like the idea of him frequenting a bar without me. Women would throw themselves at him and that set my skin on fire and my pulse racing. I cringed as my mood plummeted to a new low.</p><p>Boy, was I getting angry and he hadn\u2019t even done anything. \u201cWhy are you\u2014\u201d</p><p>He cut me off. \u201cAny plans for tomorrow? I\u2019ll pick you up at ten.\u201d His voice sounded so sexy, smooth like strawberries dipped in dark chocolate, and yet so rough, grating my nerve endings.</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d</p><p>A part of me\u2014probably the one covered by my panties\u2014hoped to see him again, while the part that accommodated my brain wanted to yell at him to stop being an arrogant ass and to hang up.</p><p>\u201cYou owe me a date, Brooke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going on a date with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>I detected a hint of amusement in his tone and took a deep breath. \u201cBecause it\u2019s not going to happen. I need hard evidence first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get it, you\u2019re angry and it\u2019s over and you have no intention of rekindling things.\u201d</p><p>Gee, he didn\u2019t get it. \u201cI\u2019m not angry because you withheld the truth. You did what you were supposed to do for your company.\u201d I took a sharp breath as I considered my words. \u201cI\u2019m angry because I don\u2019t know if I can trust you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrooke, what happened is done. I\u2019m not after the estate. I\u2019m also not forcing you to do something you don\u2019t want to do. I\u2019m not going to rip off your underwear and fuck you on the spot even though...I gotta admit, that\u2019s exactly what I\u2019ve had in mind, numerous times ever since you walked out on me.\u201d</p><p>I choked on my breath as heat pooled between my legs and sent a delicious tingle through my sensitive clit. Instinctively, my hand wandered south, two fingers pressing against the sensitive bud to stop the growing ache. His bluntness both shocked and aroused me. Deep down I had been waiting\u2014counting on him to do just that.</p><p>I bit my lip hard and held my breath so he wouldn\u2019t hear my labored breathing through the line.</p><p>\u201cWe still have a contract,\u201d Jett said slowly. His voice was hoarse, betraying his arousal at the thought. \u201cYou never quit on me and you know why.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe ended it,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>\u201cNo, baby. Not in writing we didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>We were back to square one. Sex again, pure, good sex. I wasn\u2019t stupid enough to think I could deal with it. I wasn\u2019t making that mistake twice. Thinking of the way he touched me, the way he looked at me, I knew I couldn\u2019t handle the feelings he aroused in me.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not a good idea, Jett.\u201d</p><p>Fuck, even his name sounded like sin.</p><p>\u201cAre you alone?\u201d His voice was sexy. It caressed my body, pushed through my pretense and touched that hidden spot that could send both pleasure and pain through me.</p><p>I nodded, even though he couldn\u2019t see me. \u201cYes,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you wearing?\u201d His tone was demanding, leaving me no choice but to answer.</p><p>Oh, god.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t so na\u00efve as not to know where this was heading.</p><p>\u201cA top and jeans.\u201d I tried to keep my tone casual.</p><p>\u201cTake them off together with your underwear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d My breathing came in raspy heaps. Stupid question, I know.</p><p>\u201cTake off your clothes, Brooke,\u201d Jett ordered.</p><p>There was something about his tone that made me instantly listen to his command. Maybe it was the fact that he was not here and he was just another sexy voice on the other end of the line.</p><p>\u201cNow,\u201d he demanded.</p><p>Cradling the phone between my shoulder and chin, I locked the door. I shrugged out of my jeans and panties, and pulled my top over my head, then unclasped my bra. The balmy air felt surprisingly cool against my feverish skin, making me all too aware of my nakedness. In the empty room, I felt exposed yet sexy. And then there was the fact that I felt horny and was up for some fun. I could hear his breathing down the line and it reminded me of all the times we had been together in bed, enjoying each other\u2019s bodies.</p><p>\u201cDone?\u201d Jett asked hoarsely.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, I want you to lay on your bed and close your eyes. I want you to imagine that I\u2019m there with you. Watching you.\u201d His voice was slow and deep. Leaning against he pillows, I closed my eyes and focused until I could see him before me, dressed in jeans and a snug shirt.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m taking my clothes off until I\u2019m naked,\u201d he whispered, pausing after the word naked. I pictured his body in all his glory, all hard muscles and smooth skin.</p><p>\u201cMy hands glide over your body, caressing your nipples. I can feel the softness of your skin, the weight of your breasts in my hands, and smell the fragrance of your hair.\u201d</p><p>I laughed, my nervousness getting the better of me.</p><p>\u201cFocus, Brooke,\u201d he demanded sharply.</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you to imagine that I\u2019m standing naked in front of you and as I see you naked, I can tell you, baby, you\u2019re turning me on like no other. I\u2019m hard and I\u2019m letting you touch me.\u201d</p><p>I knew I should have stopped this, hang up\u2014anything to keep my emotional distance. But my brain remained surprisingly pliant. His voice kept me intrigued. Everything was so surreal. He wasn\u2019t here, and yet he was\u2014like a fragment of my imagination, willing to do what I wanted. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I cleared my throat and took a deep breath as I let his voice guide me, visualizing him and his hardness, and the way he\u2019d touch himself. His face was a mask of want, his gaze intense with the need to please me. I pictured his eyes and their stunning green color, and his strong fingers as he moved over my breasts. I clenched my legs together to intensify the tension that was slowly building between them at the image of his majestic erection slick with want. My heart was racing in my chest, beating frantically against my ribs as I let his expert voice guide me.</p><p>\u201cCan you see me?\u201d Jett asked.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Surprisingly I could.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m brushing my lips across the back of your neck until you can feel my breath on your skin. I start kissing your shoulder and spine while my hands move around your waist so I can part your legs.\u201d</p> <p>My skin tingled from his gruff, assertive tone.</p><p>\u201cYour back\u2019s pressed against me, and my hand\u2019s stroking your slit. You\u2019re turning me so on, I\u2019m bending you over until you\u2019re on all fours. I\u2019m licking you and taste your arousal for me. Can you feel it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d A raspy pause, then, \u201cI want you to touch yourself like I\u2019d touch you. Do it well, baby. I want you to describe the way your fingers feel inside you.\u201d</p><p>Following his command, I spread my legs and slipped my fingers between them, stroking gently, then with a little more fervor before thrusting two fingers in after he instructed me to take all the time I needed.</p> <p>\u201cTell me what you feel, Brooke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m wet,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>\u201cHow wet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery, very...wet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd your fingers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo inside.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cKeep moving, Brooke.\u201d His breath came heavy, sending my fantasy into override. \u201cYou make me so hard it hurts. Keep going.\u201d</p><p>I plunged my fingers in and out of me to the picture of him in my mind and the sound of his voice caressing my senses.</p><p>\u201cImagine my erection between your pussy. How does that feel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like it.\u201d And I did, because my memories with him...made me wetter.</p><p>He laughed hoarsely. \u201cI\u2019m moving inside you slowly, imagining you wet and tight, and it feels so good for me. How does it feel for you, Brooke?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d I breathed. My thumb circled my clit, setting it on fire, my fingers between my legs, eager to follow Jett\u2019s next command.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sliding into you and as slow as I can I start to fuck you. Just inches at a time, until you begin to moan my name.\u201d He whispered so low I had a hard time focusing through the hazy curtain of sexual frustration urging me to seek fulfillment. His own arousal was apparent from his labored breathing and the picture of him touching himself shattered my last ounce of insecurity. Biting my lip hard, I rubbed my fingers through my wet folds, struggling to find my pleasure in his absence.</p><p>His voice became faint in my head as he told me how deep he plunged into me and how good it felt to be inside me. I couldn\u2019t listen anymore. I dipped my fingers in and out of me, imagining it was his body pinning me down, his erection slicing through my skin. I whimpered and pressed my temple against the cold satin pillow as my body began to shake and twist like a flame against the hard caress of my hand.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m coming,\u201d I whispered a moment before the world blackened out and I lost myself in the sweet contractions of my climax.</p><p>When it was over, the phone was still pressed to my ear and the other end of the line was so quiet I wasn\u2019t sure he hadn\u2019t hung up.</p><p>\u201cJett?\u201d I asked, sitting up and wrapping my sheets around my naked body. I was hesitant and suddenly ashamed. Had he heard it all? Was he shocked, maybe disgusted, by the way I had let myself get into character?</p><p>He cleared his throat but the coarseness of desire was still there, making my heart twitch in my chest.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really jealous of your fingers, baby,\u201d he whispered. I smiled. \u201cAnd I think I have a problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat problem?\u201d I grinned, knowing that he was about to say one of his sexy things.</p><p>\u201cI think I can\u2019t get enough of you,\u201d he whispered. \u201cDo you have any idea how much I wish you were here? How much I wish I could have seen you come?\u201d</p><p>I smiled thankful he couldn\u2019t see the blush burning my cheeks. Seriously, I could do this all night, listen to his deep voice whisper sweet nothings\u2014or in this case naughty nothings\u2014into my ear.</p><p>A thud echoed in the background, followed by a male voice saying something, and Jett\u2019s \u2018fuck you\u2019 reply.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t alone. Maybe even in a public place. The heat scorching my face intensified from both mortification and excitement.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll pick you up tomorrow at twelve same place like last time.\u201d His tone was composed. Business-like. And then it dropped to a whisper. \u201cAnd Brooke, I\u2019m hurting all over for you, baby. You owe me the real deal and I\u2019m going to take it. Running from me isn\u2019t going to help you because I\u2019ve never been a quitter.\u201d The line went dead.</p><p>He had hung up on me.</p><p>Even though I had just climaxed, my body was still earning for him. I could never have imagined anything like this would turn me on\u2014or him. It wasn\u2019t that I was uncomfortable with dirty talk. Call me clich\u00e9, but I always thought seedy phone conversations were reserved for lonely guys on a lonely night far away from the convenience of an internet connection. I shrugged back into my clothes and typed up a text message.</p><p>Don\u2019t get your hopes up. I\u2019m never sleeping with you again.</p><p>My fingers hovered over the send button, but ended up pressing delete instead. Why warn him when I could let him simmer all night and then dash his hopes. After the stunt he just pulled on me, the jerk deserved a little pain.</p><p>Chapter 9</p><p>\u201cSo let me get this straight. You want to go back to Bellagio and leave me all alone here?\u201d Sylvie asked over a hearty breakfast consisting of egg omelet and orange juice. Apart from cereals and pre-made waffles, it was the only thing Sylvie and I knew how to prepare, so naturally, we indulged in it whenever we couldn\u2019t make it to the nearest caf\u00e9.</p><p>Nodding, I put down my fork and pushed my empty plate aside. \u201cI need to run some errands. You can do whatever you want. Go shopping, lounge by the pool, update your Twitter status.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Facebook.\u201d She grimaced, like I was an idiot for not remembering. \u201cI know you\u2019re supposed to do something for the old man. I thought I could come with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be boring.\u201d I tried to sound convincing\u2014and failed miserably. \u201c I\u2019d rather you have a nice day because it\u2019s supposed to be a vacation. Go enjoy yourself. Do what you feel like doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that is?\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. Normal people went on a sightseeing tour or lay on a sunbed, reading a book. Sylvie was a totally different species.</p><p>\u201cGo to Milan, shopping. It\u2019s not that far. I\u2019ll be back around seven.\u201d I had no idea what Jett had in mind. My best guess was lunch, in which case we\u2019d be done by mid-afternoon, give or take a few hours.</p><p>\u201cYou know, I might just do that,\u201d Sylvie said. \u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to visit Milan. It\u2019s the shopping capital of Italy, and I can finally get one of those Italian silk scarfs and a new Prada bag.\u201d Sylvie swooned and her eyes glazed over as she entered shopping heaven. I could almost see the Prada logo reflected in her blue eyes.</p><p>\u201cJust do me the favor and don\u2019t go home with a guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not that stupid.\u201d</p><p>I sighed. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>Hopefully I wasn\u2019t the one making a mistake by going out with the hottest, most persuasive guy I knew. Sleeping with Jett when he was my boss was bad enough. But going out with him as my ex-boss, who also happened to be the best lover I ever had, might be worse. It spelled instant trouble.</p><p>The taxi driver parked in front of the spa. I paid and got out quickly, almost tripping over my two feet as I spotted Jett leaning relaxed against his Lamborghini. Dark shades hid his eyes, making it impossible to discern whether he was absorbed in the newspaper in his hands, or watching me approach.</p><p>My heart began to thump a little harder, and my tongue flicked over my suddenly dry lips as I stared at six foot two of toned muscles. He looked so damn sexy dressed in jeans and a black shirt. His thick dark hair was shiny and unruly. I wondered whether he\u2019d taken a shower and didn\u2019t bother to comb it before driving to pick me up. The picture of me running my hands through his hair, pulling him on top of me, made me blush so hard my skin was on fire. He was pure sin. Whoever invented the word must\u2019ve done so with Jett in mind.</p><p>As if on cue, his head snapped in my direction and a devilish grin lit up his face. He folded the newspaper and tossed it through the open window into the car, then strolled toward me.</p><p>\u201cWell, hello, I\u2019m Jett Mayfield.\u201d He grabbed my hand in a very intimate grip. \u201cI\u2019m the crazy guy who called last night.\u201d</p><p>He had me at hello and crazy.</p><p>I forced a smile on my face, and prayed he\u2019d mistake my blush for the beginning of a sunburn. Just thinking of yesterday\u2019s phone conversation with him and knowing the sound of his voice was enough to make me give in, was not only awkward\u2014it was embarrassing and agonizingly stupid. Now was the right time for earth to swallow me up whole and make me disappear forever. Maybe I was lucky enough, and Jett had been drunk and with no recollection of my lack of refusal.</p><p>Yeah, it was possible. Stranger things happened.</p><p>Don\u2019t be stupid, Stewart. Just look at his grin. He knows it!</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I asked, trying to sound as casual as possible.</p><p>\u201cEstablishing a clean slate.\u201d He winked and interlaced his fingers with mine as he walked me to his car. \u201cStarting all over again. With you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I laughed, unable to look into his eyes. The serious undertones in his voice made me nervous.</p><p>\u201cYou look beautiful.\u201d He kissed my cheek and lingered there a bit longer than necessary. A soft tingle ran down my spine. \u201cIn Italy you don\u2019t really say I miss you. People say \u2018mi manchi\u2019, which means \u2018you are missing from me.\u2019 I feel that way, Brooke. Whenever you\u2019re not around, I feel like a part of me is missing.\u201d</p><p>A hot shudder ran through my body and every inch of me longed to touch him. That he was hot and sexy was bad enough. Did he have to be nice, too? I wanted to say something witty. But, as usual, I couldn\u2019t think straight around him.</p><p>Smiling, Jett opened the door and I entered. The smell of expensive leather hit my nostrils. It didn\u2019t surprise me in the least that people were staring at us. They probably thought we were celebrities, which couldn\u2019t be further from the truth. At least in my case.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a surprise.\u201d He started the engine and pointed at the newspaper before steering out of the parking lot. \u201cTurn to page eight.\u201d</p><p>The newspaper was older than I thought, folded and used many times, the front page torn in several places. I flicked straight to page eight. The main headline mentioned a gallery opening. Further down was something about a charity event and pictures of high society socialites in their evening gowns, holding champagne flutes. The last paragraph mentioned various art purchases made on that evening. The date read May 8th 1991. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s an old newspaper.\u201d I peered at Jett, confused, as I pointed out the obvious.</p><p>\u201cIf you look closely, you\u2019ll see a younger version of Lucazzone standing next to my father. It\u2019s the only picture of the two together.\u201d</p><p>I scanned the pictures again. Although they were blurred, I recognized Alessandro. The photo must have been taken prior to his wife\u2019s death, long before his health deteriorated. My gaze shifted from Alessandro to the middle-aged man towering over him, and I recognized Jett\u2019s stubborn chin and confident smile. There was no caption\u2014as though the two didn\u2019t need an introduction. Just a random shot at some high society party.</p><p>\u201cWhere was this?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNew York,\u201d Jett said. \u201cMore than twenty years ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a long time ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I was a child we came here every summer. We stayed in hotels and holiday cottages in the area, until I purchased my property on Lake Como ten years ago. All those years my father never acknowledged knowing Lucazzone. And when I asked him a couple of weeks ago, he pretended to have met him only when he decided buying the Lucazzone estate might be a good investment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you saying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy father keeps pretending to have known Lucazzone for only ten years. This paper\u2014\u201d He pointed at the newspaper in my hand. \u201c\u2014shows they\u2019ve known each other far longer than that. I\u2019ve been asking myself why he\u2019d lie about that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhen did you find this?\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cI asked a guy I know to investigate a few weeks back, right after my father told me about the club and that any exposure of it could harm the company. I wanted to find out more. Unfortunately, there wasn\u2019t much to find.\u201d</p><p>My gaze remained glued to him as I contemplated his words. Eventually I asked the one question I thought made the most sense.</p><p>\u201cDid you confront your father about his lie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecause I don\u2019t know enough, okay?\u201d Jett said. \u201cI need to know what I\u2019m dealing with. Who those people are. What the club\u2019s all about.\u201d</p><p>Like me, he didn\u2019t trust anyone. I bit my lip as I regarded Jett from the corner of my eye. The strong muscles of his arms were clearly displayed beneath his shirt. One hand held the steering wheel, the other rested against the window. He must\u2019ve felt my gaze on him, because his attention snapped in my direction and he frowned.</p><p>\u201cYou still don\u2019t believe me, do you?\u201d He turned back to the road, but his expression didn\u2019t soften. \u201cDamn, Brooke. I told you I\u2019m not the bad guy.\u201d</p><p>I chose not to answer his question because he was right. Ever since I found out he had been keeping things from me, I had a hard time trusting him. Seeing him as the bad guy was the main excuse I used to get over him. It helped me to keep my distance. Without that excuse, my brain couldn\u2019t keep my foolish heart under control.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think is going on?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cI honestly don\u2019t know.\u201d He hesitated briefly. \u201cMy father doesn\u2019t talk. Fact is, he and Lucazzone have known each other for a long time, but he won\u2019t acknowledge it. I got him to talk about the club once, but apparently that happened a few years ago and he\u2019s out now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe they\u2019re all hiding something,\u201d I said, matter-of-factly.</p><p>Jett nodded grimly. \u201cThat\u2019s my best bet, too. I just don\u2019t want this shit to affect you in any way.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, see that\u2019s something I wanted to talk about.\u201d I tapped my fingers on my thigh, considering my words as my heartbeat sped up at the countless thoughts running through my mind. \u201cYou keep saying I\u2019m in danger. But you don\u2019t have any proof.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do, Brooke.\u201d</p><p>Silence. I waited for him to continue. He didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cWhat proof?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t want to scare you.\u201d</p><p>Oh, come on!</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding me?\u201d I snorted. \u201cYou do realize your whole \u2018I\u2019m here to protect you\u2019 crap is scary, right? It\u2019s like warning me there\u2019s something or someone inside my house, but you\u2019re not telling me what it is and my imagination\u2019s left roaming free in horror movie territory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. You know I told you about the murder victim found on the Lucazzone estate years ago?\u201d</p><p>I nodded, thinking back to the horrendous story taking place decades ago. The victim was Alessandro\u2019s lover\u2014or at least that\u2019s what Maria\u2019s diary supposedly said. The crime was never investigated and consequently Alessandro never prosecuted.</p><p>\u201cYeah, that wasn\u2019t the only weird thing happening,\u201d Jett said, \u201cMy brother and I used to watch the house when we were kids.\u201d I nodded because I remembered him telling me the story. He continued. \u201cAt times we\u2019d see the old man leaving the house. We also noticed policemen regularly visiting the place. Laughing. Shaking hands. I have good reason to believe they were involved.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t like this information. I figured in case of an emergency, I might just end up asking the wrong people for help.</p><p>I wet my dry lips and repeated the obvious because his words kept echoing inside my brain, and I needed to hear them out loud. \u201cYou think the police were involved\u2014in the club.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Jett shook his head slowly, his gaze darkening. \u201cThinking back, I\u2019m pretty sure of it, considering that the murder on the estate was never investigated. With the right people covering for you, it\u2019d be easy to kill someone and shrug it off as an accident. I think that\u2019s what really happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cObviously, a man with an open throat and torso didn\u2019t kill himself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly,\u201d Jett muttered.</p><p>As the Lamborghini sped out of the city and up the narrow country road, I realized I still had no idea where we were heading.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d</p><p>His mood lightened at my sudden change in topic. \u201cSince I\u2019m the one taking you out on a date, I have a right to keep the destination secret until we\u2019re there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t really like surprises.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, baby, but believe me this one will blow your mind.\u201d</p><p>My skin began to tingle from the sexual undertone in his voice. The temperature in the car rose a few degrees. Maybe because the early afternoon sun was shining with relentless heat. Or maybe because his right arm was so close to mine, I could almost feel his touch. Either way, I didn\u2019t like the jolts of anticipation traveling through my abdomen and gathering between my legs.</p><p>Eventually the forest cleared. From our heightened road I could see lots of sparkling water and a shore. I straightened in my seat and craned my neck to get a better glimpse. In the distance the first rows of roofs began to emerge, gathering into a messy knot of narrow properties and winding streets running between them.</p><p>\u201cIs that the Ligurian Sea?\u201d My brain fought to recall the tiny bits of Italian geography I had picked up on my first trip to Italy.</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s still Lake Como. The sea is a two and half hour drive from here,\u201d Jett said. \u201cIt\u2019s quite nice. I\u2019ll take us some day.\u201d</p><p>Us.</p><p>My heart skipped a beat. He was making future plans\u2014and they involved me.</p><p>He took a left turn and we came to a stop near a small port.</p><p>\u201cCan you swim?\u201d Jett asked as he helped me out his car and locked it behind us.</p><p>I looked up into his stunning green eyes. His impossibly long lashes shielded them from the bright light, making them appear a few shades darker than usual.</p><p>Mysterious. Dangerously hot.</p><p>\u201cYes. Why?\u201d I asked, warily.</p><p>\u201cBecause we\u2019re going on a boat.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 10</p><p>A boat was actually an understatement. What Jett called a boat looked more like a seventy-foot yacht with four luxury cabins consisting of an en-suite forward VIP cabin, a twin bunk cabin to port, a twin bunk cabin to starboard, and a full mid-ship master cabin with yet another bathroom\u2014or so Jett explained. Not that I understood half the things he said, but I tried my best to keep up with his excited chatter as I let him show me around.</p><p>Upon entering the living room, the part boaters called a saloon, we walked through a spacious starboard side galley with ample space to relax, a polished mahogany dining table, and a kitchen almost twice the size of my kitchen back in New York. It had a granite countertop, fitted dishwasher, ceramic hob, refrigerator, microwave, and oven\u2014like you\u2019d ever need that on a boat.</p><p>It was my first time on this kind of \u2018boat\u2019 and walking through each of the cabins, I had a hard time not to gawk at the expensive furniture and overindulgent design focusing on shades of cream and brown. Eventually we stopped in the saloon and Jett invited me to sit down on the creamy luxury couch. Set up on the opposite wall was a huge plasma TV set and a stereo system right out of a catalog. I tried hard not to look too impressed. Truth was, Jett\u2019s boat had everything anyone could ever wish for: lots of space, privacy, and more things than the apartment I shared with Sylvie back in Brooklyn.</p><p>\u201cWow. You could actually live here,\u201d I said, running my fingertips over the smooth mahogany surface of a side table.</p><p>\u201cI did about four years ago.\u201d</p><p>I felt his hand on my neck and then he pulled my hair back and his hot lips were on my skin. His butterfly kisses sent delicious jolts through me, making me shiver with both pleasure and a hint of pain that traveled somewhere south.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to be alone with my thoughts,\u201d Jett whispered. \u201cThis was the perfect place for it. Once you\u2019re out here, far away from the oppressing boundaries of life and work, you can almost smell the freedom in the air. It\u2019s like a completely different world.\u201d</p><p>I blinked back my surprise. \u201cThe boat\u2019s yours?\u201d I don\u2019t know why I was so surprised, when he had enough money to buy anything he wanted.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I bought it after finalizing my first big work project. It was much better than living in a house with my brother and father.\u201d He turned me toward him. His expression showed the same enthusiasm as before, but a shadow had descended over his mood, which made me conclude living with his family hadn\u2019t been a piece of cake.</p><p>\u201cWhy a boat?\u201d I found myself asking, compelled by this man and the prospect of him finally opening up to me.</p><p>Jett shrugged. \u201cWhy not a boat? You wake up with the sun on your face, the air smelling of water and salt, and the wind blowing through your hair. There\u2019s no door. No bell to ring. You can just pack your bags and leave, and no one knows where you are.\u201d</p><p>He wanted to run. Like I had run many years ago. From my past. From the pain that wouldn\u2019t stop haunting me every second of the day. I wanted to ask what he was running from. Yet I didn\u2019t because I wanted him to open up to me out of need rather than obligation.</p><p>I looked up and found Jett still watching me, scrutinizing me, his dark eyes more clouded than before. He was so careful not to disclose anything about his past that he ended up showing everything in his expression. Usually, he was inscrutable. For a moment I could see he wasn\u2019t as closed a book as he always pretended to be, which was good because it showed me his arrogant and perfect fa\u00e7ade was nothing but a disguise to protect what lay buried within his soul. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I moistened my lips and walked to the painting hanging on the wall behind him. It was just a picture of his boat with large capital letters spelling THE ROCK beneath it.</p><p>\u201cThe Rock?\u201d I read, grimacing. \u201cIs that your boat\u2019s name? I hope I\u2019m not supposed to take it literally.\u201d</p><p>He laughed, gorgeous dimples forming in his cheeks. \u201cYeah. But don\u2019t worry. It\u2019d take a lot to sink it. It\u2019s as solid as a rock, which is why it got its name.\u201d</p><p>I raised my eyebrows. \u201cAren\u2019t ships usually named after former conquests?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d He paused and nodded, faking deep thought. \u201cWhat if I told you there were no former conquests? No one who ever mattered?\u201d</p><p>My heart slammed against the confined space of my ribcage.</p><p>Hard to believe.</p><p>And yet something in the way he regarded me\u2014calm and serious\u2014made me want to believe every single word.</p><p>\u201cI might actually rename her,\u201d Jett continued. \u201cI was thinking \u2018Brooke.\u2019 It has a much nicer ring to it than \u2018The Rock.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSeriously?\u201d I laughed nervously as I watched him move closer, stopping just a few inches away from me.</p><p>\u201cWhy would I joke about it?\u201d</p><p>He was damn serious. I could tell from the way he stared me down with a determined glint in his eyes. My breath caught in my throat. Not because of the way he looked at me\u2014with an intense magnetism that made me want to give him everything I had\u2014nor because he was considering renaming his boat after me. I could barely breathe because I realized nothing had changed. He behaved as if we were still together, as if we never broke up.</p><p>As if he meant the last words he\u2019d spoken to me the last time I saw him in New York: I care for you enough to let you go.</p><p>Technically, he did let me go \u2014then followed me. So did he care for me? And if he did, was it a good thing? Should I welcome it, let my own feelings develop and see where that might take me?</p><p>\u201cIt might be a bit too early for renaming a boat after me,\u201d I said slowly.</p> <p>He turned away, hiding his expression. For a moment, I regretted my words\u2014until I realized I was doing the right thing. Keeping each other at arm\u2019s length. Not too involved.</p><p>\u201cWhat happens when you\u2019re not here? Who takes care of \u2018The Rock\u2019?\u201d Acutely aware of the sudden tension emanating from him, I tried to steer the focus away from me.</p><p>Jett pointed at the door, ignoring my question and previous statement. \u201cLook, can you wait here while I remove the anchor? I\u2019ll be back in a minute.\u201d</p><p>He was going to remove the anchor? Like in, sail away with me onboard?</p><p>Holy dang!</p><p>I was in big trouble.</p><p>Being alone with him on a luxury boat surrounded by sparkling blue water and no living soul in sight was the last thing I wanted, and yet I found myself smiling and saying, \u201cSure. Take your time.\u201d</p><p>What the heck, Stewart?</p> <p>\u201cGreat,\u201d Jett said, his eyes betraying his amusement. \u201cI\u2019ll grab us a drink on the way back.\u201d</p><p>He made it all sound so nonchalant, like he was going to get us coffee from the corner caf\u00e9. I knew that blas\u00e9 tone of his and what it usually preceded. Don\u2019t ever trust a guy with a Southern accent, a lazy smile, and a casual stance, because he\u2019s about to sneak his way into your panties without even trying.</p><p>Pissed with myself that I didn\u2019t even think about protesting, I began to look around as I waited for him. The doors were open, and from my seat on the sofa I could peer right into the master cabin. The first thing I noticed was the king-sized bed and the small round rug on the polished oak floor. The sheets were the color of creamy chocolate, smooth and shiny like silk. The picture of me sitting down on the soft bed entered my head. I could see myself surrounded by all those pillows and imagined Jett\u2019s rough hands on my skin, his possessive tongue inside my mouth as we kissed and made love on the silk sheets, my hands tugging at his hair as he moved inside me. My stomach knotted deliciously as a pang of heat shot through me and gathered between my legs. Good thing I shaved my legs and put on my nicest lingerie.</p><p>I groaned with irritation.</p><p>Why was I even thinking of that? It wasn\u2019t like I wanted to sleep with him. That wasn\u2019t why I came here at all. I was so immersed in my thoughts that I didn\u2019t hear Jett coming in.</p><p>\u201cYou said you\u2019ve sworn off alcohol, so I brought us iced coffee instead.\u201d He placed a long drink glass with a creamy brownish liquid and a straw in front of me as he held on to his.</p><p>I looked up, startled. My face caught fire, partly because I was ashamed of my thoughts, and partly because I knew he knew. It was pretty obvious from the amused glint in his eyes and the way he moistened his lips, flicking the tip of his tongue over them lazily, suggesting all sorts of naughty things. He was torturing me without so much as touching my body.</p><p>\u201cI want to show you the lake,\u201d Jett said, \u201csince you might want to live here when you inherit the estate.\u201d He held out his hand and I interlaced my fingers with his. His skin felt warm. Climbing up the stairs, I felt his gaze on my ass and couldn\u2019t help but sway my hips just a little bit more than usual because I wanted to have the same effect on him as he had on me.</p><p>We walked up to the deck where we lingered for a few moments, enjoying the stunning view.</p><p>\u201cThis is where I spend most of my time when I\u2019m here,\u201d Jett said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful,\u201d I whispered, realizing my words couldn\u2019t do it justice. Decorated with brown wicker outdoor furniture consisting of one love seat with creamy white cushions and a long coffee table plus a side table, it held enough space to accommodate a whole family. There were three sunbathing areas forward, aft and alongside the steering console of the cockpit.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get this baby going,\u201d Jett said. Through the glass partition, I watched him step into the cockpit and then behind the steering console. His long fingers wrapped around the helm as he expertly pushed a few buttons\u2014and there were plenty of those. Everything looked so complicated, and yet Jett seemed as though he had done nothing else his whole life. Obviously he knew what he was doing, which relaxed me.</p><p>An instant later the boat came to life and we left the dock, slowly at first, then faster. I slumped onto a lounge chair and peered at the clear blue water around us as we moved farther from the shore and from the people walking up and down the promenade.</p><p>Being out here with the waves crashing around the boat and the wind blowing through my hair, I felt a sense of tranquility and happiness. For the first time in my life, I felt alive...and safe. As if the wind and the water could wash away the pain and the disappointments of the past ten years. As if I could leave my past behind and sail into a new future. And the fact that Jett was standing just a few feet away made the whole experience even more profound.</p><p>Boats passed as by periodically, and the shore became nothing but a narrow strip of brown in the distance. And then even that disappeared, and my mind drifted off to memories of his deep voice and sinfully sexy eyes.</p><p>\u2018The Rock\u2019 slowed down\u2014I could feel the gentle vibrations of the engine. Realizing I must have fallen asleep, I opened my eyes and squinted against the sunlight as I tried to adjust to the glaring brightness. We were far out on the lake, with no people in sight. Surrounded by mountain views, the spot looked quiet and secluded, far away from civilization. The engine whirred and then all became quiet and the boat was floating idly in the water.</p><p>Realizing it was just Jett and me now\u2014on water, alone\u2014I sat up and looked at the partition. He wasn\u2019t there. A moment later, I felt his presence behind me. I turned and smiled and he rewarded me with a lazy grin.</p><p>\u201cHad a good nap?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d</p><p>He leaned forward and brushed a stray strand of hair out of my face. \u201cBecause I know what you look like when you wake up. You have a sexy, carefree look about you, like you\u2019ve been to a different place.\u201d</p><p>I felt my cheeks catch fire. \u201cSexy, huh? I like that. I always thought I looked grumpy. Sexy definitely sounds way better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven your grumpy looks are sexy.\u201d He reached out to help me up and turned me around, wrapping his arms around me so my back was pressed against his front. I snuggled against his chest and craned my neck to accommodate his exploring lips on my earlobe. My skin felt warm\u2014hot even\u2014and not just from the sun.</p><p>\u201cHow long have you been driving a boat?\u201d I asked to distract myself from the sudden tension in the air.</p><p>\u201cI took my first course six years ago, but my father taught me the basics as a child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s nice,\u201d I said, leaning into him so he wouldn\u2019t stop his nibbling. \u201cYou sure know what you\u2019re doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean the boat, or this?\u201d His teeth grazed my skin just a little bit harder than was necessary, sending a jolt of pleasure and pain through me. His caress made it hard for me to keep my composure, so I pulled away and stepped aside to put some much-needed distance between us.</p><p>\u201cCome on. Let\u2019s go inside.\u201d He grinned and held out his hand. I eyed it carefully, not quite trusting that he wouldn\u2019t just grab me in his arms and do whatever he had been about to do. \u201cI won\u2019t bite\u2014unless you want me to,\u201d Jett said.</p><p>\u201cWhy? What\u2019s inside?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIced Tea? Water? You must be dehydrated.\u201d And I was. But I still didn\u2019t trust the dangerous glint in his eyes. \u201cBesides, it\u2019s cooler inside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo funny business.\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cYou know me.\u201d</p><p>Hell yeah, I did. \u201cWhich is exactly why I don\u2019t trust you when we\u2019re alone.\u201d He smiled that panty-dropping smile of his that always made me want to rip the clothes off his glorious body and wrap myself around him. Was there pride in his eyes? I groaned, irritated with myself for inflating his over-inflated ego some more. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean it like a compliment. It\u2019s not like you\u2019re a sex god or anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy thanks, baby. I\u2019d love to prove my worth.\u201d</p><p>Oh gosh. Why couldn\u2019t I just keep my big mouth shut?</p><p>A lazy grin lit up his face and my brain switched off for a second. Annoyed, I rolled my eyes and took off across the deck and down the stairs to the master saloon, confident that he\u2019d follow behind.</p><p>I sat down on the couch and watched him pour us two glasses of bottled water from the fridge.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I said as he passed me a glass and sat down opposite from me. I took a few sips and placed the glass in front of me on the table, all too aware of his intense gaze.</p><p>Through the windows I could see the sparkling water, and the soft movement eased my tension, but not enough to make me feel less nervous around him.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know anyone who owns a boat, let alone can navigate one,\u201d I admitted. \u201cI think it\u2019s pretty amazing. Is there anything else you\u2019ve been keeping from me?\u201d</p><p>He inclined his head. \u201cI\u2019m not particularly good at flying. My brother\u2019s way better than me, which annoyed my father to no end. They\u2019re both highly competitive, challenging me to beat them at whatever it was that caught their attention. But it was always the not particularly risky stuff. You know, flying, gambling, hunting, sky diving... you name it. I was more interested in other stuff.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I laughed. Was he serious? I wanted to point out that all of the things he mentioned were risky, but I decided to dive into that later. \u201cWhat other stuff?\u201d I asked instead.</p><p>He leaned so close I could see the tiny lines beneath his eyes and feel the delicious warmth of his breath. His piercing gaze met mine. \u201cFor some time I had the crazy idea to work undercover.\u201d I raised my brows in confusion and his grin widened. \u201cYou know...head hunt people. I took martial arts classes, trained in all the James Bond stuff you see on TV. I joined a gang. It was my way to handle anger.\u201d He waved his hand like it didn\u2019t matter. I almost choked on my breath.</p><p>\u201cWait a sec. Rewind a bit. Did you say \u2018gang\u2019?\u201d</p><p>He grimaced. \u201cSort of. Though not the drug dealing type you probably have in mind. Everyone said I had problems with authority, which I guess was true. I didn\u2019t listen to anyone. Not my father, not my teachers. No one.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd by head hunting I assume you\u2019re not talking about sifting through prospective candidates to fill a job opening.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, still grinning.</p><p>\u201cWow.\u201d I stared at him, open-mouthed. It was difficult to imagine Jett\u2014the refined CEO of one of the largest and most successful real estate companies in the world\u2014doing something dangerous, and yet I was inclined to believe him. He had struck me as the bad boy type all right when I first met him, and I was thrilled to see my people knowledge didn\u2019t suck as much as I always thought.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s in the past now, but I can\u2019t say I\u2019m proud of some of the experiences I made.\u201d He ran his fingertips over my lower arm absentmindedly. His gaze was averted so I couldn\u2019t read his expression, but I didn\u2019t fail to catch the strained undertones in his voice. He was hiding something. I couldn\u2019t pinpoint what drove me to that conclusion, but I knew I was right.</p><p>\u201cWell, we all make mistakes. It\u2019s part of humanity,\u201d I said.</p> <p>The way he bit his lower lip, hesitating, I could tell he didn\u2019t want to disclose more, which was a shame because I loved hearing about his life. It made me feel connected to him. Maybe he didn\u2019t trust me enough to share everything with me. Maybe by pressing the issue, I\u2019d be asking for too much too soon when every single women\u2019s magazine tells you to take things slowly. Obviously, I didn\u2019t want to be the pushy kind\u2014the one who had to know everything and ended up asking stupid questions like \u2018what are you thinking\u2019 or \u2018how do you feel about us?\u2019 I knew enough people who made that sort of mistake, and I honestly wanted to learn from their failures. He\u2019d confide in me, eventually. Unfortunately, I had already told him one of my biggest secrets. So there was no way in hell I\u2019d let him get away with not telling me one of his own. It was only fair he open up so we were even.</p><p>\u201cWhat made you give it up?\u201d I asked.</p><p>A few moments passed and he didn\u2019t answer. I thought he might be pissed that I took the liberty to insist on a topic he obviously wasn\u2019t comfortable talking about. And then he turned to look at me, and I flinched inwardly at the pain reflected in his expression. His eyes were deep like the ocean and filled with darkness.</p><p>I knew this was the moment he\u2019d either share it all, or pull away from me.</p><p>\u201cI got involved with the wrong crowd and ended up doing some very stupid things for them,\u201d Jett said. \u201cI had to learn the hard way...it was either jail or let my father buy me out of the mess. I have changed since\u2014\u201d He trailed off, leaving the rest open to interpretation.</p><p>The energy he exuded made it clear something bad had happened. The image of him hiding, destroying, fighting, popped into my head and other feelings rushed through me\u2014excitement, fear, arousal\u2014at the knowledge he used to be someone else. Or maybe he wasn\u2019t so different now; he just hid it well. Either way, I realized my opinion of him hadn\u2019t shifted.</p> <p>\u201cI wish I could tell you more, but there\u2019s no sense in telling you something that I can\u2019t change. Something I can\u2019t explain to myself,\u201d Jett murmured. \u201cWe all have secrets. Mine may be worse than I care admit, but I don\u2019t want you to think less of me by telling you what happened, because my past\u2019s nothing but baggage resulting from bad choices and foolish mistakes. What happened can\u2019t be undone. I\u2019m lucky enough to be alive and that\u2019s all that counts. Maybe one day, when I\u2019m confident that nothing can scare you off, I\u2019ll tell you more.\u201d</p><p>It hurt that he thought whatever he did would make me run for the hills, and yet I understood where he was coming from. Secrets aren\u2019t easily revealed when you have so much to lose.</p><p>\u201cWhatever you did is in the past.\u201d My hand gripped his, giving it a light and reassuring squeeze, signaling I wasn\u2019t one to judge, just like he hadn\u2019t judged me when I disclosed my past. \u201cIt\u2019s human nature to make mistakes.\u201d</p><p>He caught my glance and something passed between us. A mutual understanding that not knowing everything was better for me. For us. For whatever there might be between us in the future.</p><p>I was okay not knowing.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been there and I understand.\u201d I forced a soft smile on my lips.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d His gaze passed through me like a current, piercing into my very core, and his thumb began to stroke my fingers. My skin tingled: strong, noticeable, but invisible. For the umpteenth time I wondered whether he could feel our connection. Two opposites drawn together like magnets. As much as I had pushed him away, hating him for the pain he caused me, I couldn\u2019t deny the fact that he was a part of me now. Wherever I went, he would be there, buried deep within my heart. Never letting him go.</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d My voice was husky. \u201cI haven\u2019t done anything.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFor trusting me.\u201d He cupped my face and forced me to meet his heated gaze. His thumb caressed my lips, his touch as soft as melted chocolate.</p><p>Kiss me.</p><p>My eyes implored him, following my heart\u2019s command.</p><p>\u201cSorry, I forgot my manners. Are you hungry?\u201d Breaking our special moment, he let go of me and headed for the kitchen. My gaze followed him.</p><p>Damn him and his ability to seem so unaffected!</p><p>I cleared my voice. \u201cActually, I\u2019m starving. Can I help in some way?\u201d I walked over, unsure whether to feel happy or disappointed that we were back on easy-going, superficial terrain.</p><p>He opened a small cupboard and retrieved two plates. \u201cI\u2019ve already ordered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are we having?\u201d Standing on my toes, I craned my neck to peek over his shoulder and noticed the large silver tray on the counter. He switched off a little red button on the buffet server and removed the lid. The smell of roasted meat and vegetables hit my nostrils.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not allergic to walnuts, are you? The filling might have some in it.\u201d He started to pile food on the plates, adding meat, pasta with arugula, white beans, and roasted shallots.</p><p>\u201cNot that I know of. And even if I were, I\u2019d take a risk just to taste a bite of this stuff. It smells delicious.\u201d</p><p>He sprinkled chopped chives on the plates and grinned. \u201cIt tastes better than it looks.\u201d</p><p>I remembered the few times he cooked for me. The food hadn\u2019t just looked good and tasted even better, it had been unforgettable. \u201cEven better than your cooking?\u201d I said. \u201cWhy, I\u2019m one lucky girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, what was that?\u201d He eased closer.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I took a few steps back until my back pressed against something hard.</p><p>\u201cThat look you just had.\u201d His index finger trailed down my cheek. \u201cWas that sarcasm? Are you implying my cooking was bad?\u201d His pretend frown barely managed to hide a lazy grin, and the glint in his eyes showed me he was joking. I sensed the direction of our conversation had changed. He was digging deeper, searching for the answer to a question only he knew; playing a game.</p><p>I bit my lip as I contemplated my options. I could pretend I didn\u2019t like it and risk hurting him, because it was most certainly not the answer he expected. Or I could play along. Hell, I was more than up for a little game.</p><p>And then what, Stewart? Open up to him so you end up hurt\u2014all over again?</p><p>Taking a sharp breath, I met his beautiful eyes. In front of me he looked huge, dominating. But there was a fragility to him that made me realize he wasn\u2019t as intimidating as I previously thought.</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d I tilted my head, giving him full access to my exposed neck. His fingers trailed down my arms and rested on my hips. I swallowed hard and ignored the shiver his touch sent through my body. He wanted me. He wanted me bad. Right here, right now. I could see it in the way his eyes consumed me. And I wanted him, too. Badly.</p><p>Why not just give in?</p><p>Only once.</p><p>\u201cWell, Miss Stewart, if you didn\u2019t like my last attempt at cooking, you sure as hell will have to endure my next one.\u201d His eyes turned a darker shade of green. The air charged with sexual tension, sending yet another electric jolt through my lower body.</p><p>Holy cow.</p><p>He was going for it. And my resolve was slowly waning.</p><p>Reacting on instinct, I dashed past him, heading for the deck but he was quicker. He scooped me up and carried me over his shoulder to the couch.</p><p>\u201cStop it.\u201d Laughing, I tried rather feebly to free myself. \u201cYour attack is absolutely not welcome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAttack, huh?\u201d He put me down on the couch, then shifted between my legs until he was lying on top of me and my hands were pinned above my head. His lips searched mine, barely touching me. Lingering. Teasing. So very close and yet too far.</p><p>\u201cSay it.\u201d His tone came low but I registered the command in it.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat you like my cooking.\u201d His beautiful lips twitched with the tiniest hint of a smile.</p><p>\u201cUh...it\u2019s awfully\u2014\u201d I paused, letting him stew just a little bit longer \u201c\u2014good. I like it a lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay it again. I think I might have misheard.\u201d His smile was smug, his eyes shimmering with a glint of mischief.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s delicious. The best I\u2019ve ever had.\u201d I wasn\u2019t talking just about cooking, and he knew it.</p><p>\u201cReally? The best you\u2019ve ever had?\u201d His tongue flicked over his lips, leaving a tempting wet trail behind.</p><p>I nodded, unable to erase the stupid grin off my face.</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll let you off the hook...for now, Ms. Stewart.\u201d He shifted on top of me and tightened the grip around my wrists as his lips inched closer to mine. A moment of anticipation passed between us\u2014a silent promise that didn\u2019t need words to convey its meaning. He regarded me with so much warmth and passion, I didn\u2019t need to delve deep into his heart to know what he was feeling.</p><p>I had never been so happy in my life, and in that instant I realized that even if I wanted to and the opportunity presented itself\u2014I could never hurt him.</p><p>Love is when you\u2019d rather be hurt than hurt the one you love.</p><p>Jett\u2019s lips brushed mine tenderly, making my stomach flutter as my eyes drank in the dark sea of his irises. \u201cI hope you don\u2019t expect good manners because I\u2019m starving,\u201d he whispered in that sexy tone of his that made it sound like he wasn\u2019t talking about the food. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Stop hearing double meanings in his words, Stewart!</p><p>\u201cFood sounds great.\u201d</p><p>I let him help me up and sat down at the table, watching him bring our plates. He seemed slightly changed. As though a weight had been lifted off his shoulders. Tucking into my lunch, I smiled up at him. Seeing him happy made me happy, and that was all that mattered.</p><p>Chapter 11</p> <p>Time passed too quickly. After our strange but intimate moment and lunch, which turned out to be nothing short of amazing, we returned to the deck and to light conversation. Jett was easy to talk to, which was one of the many things I liked about him. It was hard to believe he was only a few years older than me. The vastness of his travel experience and knowledge of the world gave a different impression.</p><p>\u201cMore iced tea?\u201d He refilled my glass without waiting for my answer.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d My glance traveled to the clear blue water, and the way it seemed to reflect the sunlight in a million facets.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re taking it serious?\u201d Jett asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYour alcohol celibacy.\u201d</p><p>I nodded and took a sip of my iced tea. \u201cI do. I\u2019m very serious about it.\u201d Maybe not forever, but right now I intended to stick with my decision. Getting drunk with Jett around was the last thing I wanted, not least because I knew I couldn\u2019t account for anything I did or said under the influence of alcohol. Besides, I needed a clear head to re-valuate our situation.</p><p>He took a sip of his own iced tea, his eyes never leaving mine. I could tell he was about to start flirting again by the way his eyes crinkled at the corners. He leaned forward, resting his elbows on the table. His leg touched mine, making me all too aware of just how close we were sitting.</p><p>\u201cHave you considered working for me again?\u201d His voice was playful, but there was a serious undertone to it.</p><p>\u201cWhy would you want that?\u201d I asked surprised.</p><p>\u201cBecause I want to have you around. We make a good team.\u201d</p> <p>He was right about the latter part, and having him around for most of the day was tempting. But there were so many arguments against it I had no idea where to start. For one, we were too emotionally involved to have a professional relationship. And then there was the second best argument: past experience.</p><p>\u201cLast time didn\u2019t go so well,\u201d I remarked.</p><p>\u201cFair enough. But we\u2019ve both learned from our mistakes.\u201d</p><p>Did we?</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have any plans at the moment. I just want to take it easy, see where things are heading.\u201d And with things I meant us. The estate. Alessandro. I needed time to make a decision with regards to my inheritance, where to live, what to do with my life.</p><p>\u201cI have a new position coming up. It pays twice as much as you were making with me, and you would be overseeing projects as project leader, while also taking on the same duties as my personal assistant. Consider it a promotion with a pay raise. We could travel together, get to know each other. Of course, if you don\u2019t want to, I respect your decision.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll think about it.\u201d I avoided his intense gaze. \u201cBut thanks for the offer.\u201d I meant every word of it.</p><p>He shrugged in that non-committal way of his that showed it affected him more than he let on. Truth was, Jett managed one of the most respected realty companies in the world, and passing on his offer would be stupid\u2014in terms of my career. But working with him and seeing him every day would only make me fall even harder for him.</p> <p>\u201cI got you something.\u201d He walked over to the navigation area and returned with a white box then handed it to me, his hands touching mine.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust open it.\u201d</p><p>I unwrapped the box and removed the thin paper to reveal a two-piece bikini made from tricot fabric. I scooped up the halter-top and low rise bottoms, and held them up into the light, marveling at the expensive cut and the way the material seemed to shimmer in silver facets. It was one of those luxury designer swimsuits I had always wanted but couldn\u2019t afford.</p><p>\u201cYou said white\u2019s your favorite color and I thought you might want to change into it, if it gets too hot.\u201d He ran his hand through his dark hair.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s\u2014\u201d I almost choked on my breath. \u201cBeautiful. You shouldn\u2019t have.\u201d The only gift I had ever received from a guy was a key chain and a cup that read \u2018Got to be lazy.\u2019 But it wasn\u2019t the gift that took my breath away. It was the fact that in the short time we spent together in the past, he had truly listened. The color was perfect and he even got the size right. He had either searched through my underwear drawer to find out, or he had lots of experience with women\u2019s sizes. While option one seemed kind of creepy, I certainly preferred it to option two.</p><p>\u201cWell, I hope you like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do. Thank you.\u201d I fought the urge to rise to my toes and place a soft peck on his cheek. As I arranged the top back in its box, I remembered Sylvie\u2019s warning. This was the life of the rich, who never had to worry about money. I realized that our relationship was the least of my problems. Although I was an heir to an estate, my heritage was based on a lucky coincidence while he was born into it. He had grown up rich, used to this lifestyle and to spending millions on stuff he didn\u2019t need. He could buy everything and anything he wanted. He had women throwing themselves at his feet, ready to unbutton his pants for a new dress or a pair of shoes. While I liked to think I was different, I knew he might not think that way if I accepted his gift. A man as powerful and sexy as Jett could easily replace things\u2014and people. I didn\u2019t want to end up as one of them, because he had no respect for me.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Jett\u2019s expression reflected his concern and I realized I had been staring at the box for a little too long. \u201cDid I buy the wrong size?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not that. It\u2019s just\u2014\u201d My voice faltered. \u201cWhy are you doing all of this, Jett?\u201d Trying to control the shaking in my voice, I stood and walked over to the railing.</p><p>\u201cWhy am I doing what?\u201d</p><p>I could feel him standing behind me but I didn\u2019t turn to face him.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re no longer interested in the estate, why are you taking me out and do things for me?\u201d I whispered.</p><p>\u201cBecause I like nice things and I can afford to buy them.\u201d His statement sounded more like a question and only confirmed what I already knew about him and his lifestyle.</p><p>I shook my head and laughed briefly. \u201cSo it\u2019s what you do for every woman, because you can afford to?\u201d</p><p>The thought of him with others almost made me throw up in my mouth. I wasn\u2019t the self-conscious type, but I wasn\u2019t a fool not to realize that I had nothing to show off, nothing that would make his rich friends go \u2018wow, she\u2019s trophy wife material\u2019\u2014or whatever musicians, actors, and other famous people said about their girlfriends and wives. Men like Jett had women at their side that had either status or money; looks or fame. I had none of those combinations and that bothered me. I had thought his interest in me was based on his wish to obtain the estate. Now that had been clarified, what did Jett see in me that I didn\u2019t?</p><p>His hand settled on the small of my back, massaging gently as though to soothe the turmoil inside me.</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t do that for every woman. I just like you,\u201d he said. \u201cYou say things the way you see them. You\u2019re easy to talk to on an intimate level, and that\u2019s hard to find.\u201d</p><p>I turned around and he cupped my face, forcing me to look up. His eyes were as deep as the sea around us.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re honest and clever. You\u2019re interesting because you have something many don\u2019t have: charm, spirit, and a kind heart. And you\u2019re sexy.\u201d His lips hovered over mine, sending my insides into a raging storm of anticipation. \u201cBut what\u2019s most important to me is the fact that you\u2019re loyal. I know you wouldn\u2019t betray me.\u201d</p><p>Was I loyal? Would I never betray him? Probably yes. But were those good enough qualities to keep a man like him?</p><p>A soft breeze pushed an unruly curl into my eyes. I lifted my hand to brush it away but Jett beat me to it. His fingers sent a delicious tingle through my skin that reminded me just how much my heart was consumed by him.</p><p>It\u2019s not natural to fall, and fall so hard.</p><p>\u201cWhen you reach the top the only way is down,\u201d I mumbled. \u201cYou\u2019re my peak and I don\u2019t want to plummet into the depths awaiting me when we\u2019re done.\u201d</p><p>A few seconds passed between us before he spoke.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you think I want what others want, but that\u2019s not the case. I\u2019m looking for things that matter. Things I can hold and treasure forever. I think you\u2019re worth holding onto, Brooke. And that\u2019s worth more in time to come than anything you think might be of importance.\u201d</p><p>My pulse quickened as his hand ran down my spine, sending an electric shiver into my abdomen.</p><p>I wanted to believe him so bad it hurt. But my parents had loved each other and yet my father still killed himself, leaving my mother behind with a hole in her heart so deep not even I, as her daughter, could ever fill.</p><p>\u201cI told you once and I\u2019ll tell you again,\u201d Jett said softly. \u201cI don\u2019t want someone who\u2019s perfect because I\u2019m not perfect. I want someone who\u2019s real; someone who complements me rather than completes me.\u201d</p><p>My resolve was fading. I could feel it in the way my sappy heart began to cry with joy and the way my legs threatened to buckle beneath me, sending me straight into his open arms. Or heaven\u2014whatever came first.</p><p>I think Jett could see it too because he pulled me closer, until I couldn\u2019t break away even if I wanted.</p><p>\u201cFor what it\u2019s worth, I still want to be with you and I know you want it, too,\u201d Jett whispered. \u201cJust let it happen.\u201d</p><p>It was true\u2014and for this I hated him, loved him, wanted him, and yet I wished him away. So many conflicting emotions of wants and needs. So much fear. Not because of him, but because of myself\u2014of how deep my feelings and desires were running, and how much I would fall if I happened to lose my grip.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you say?\u201d His lips found mine, taking from them the answer he desired.</p><p>My mind was spinning, my heart was screaming, but my body knew what it wanted. It was wet and ready for him. And he knew it. I knew it. His hand moved up until he held the back of my head and our lips began to brush against each other. As he kissed me deeply, he took not only every ounce of my breath away, but also the remaining wall of my castle. For once, everything clicked into place. In his arms I felt like I was home.</p><p>Chapter 12</p><p>Pressed against me, Jett smelled amazing\u2014rich, and earthy, and edible, like a man should smell. His stubble rasped against my skin as he buried his face in my neck, licking and biting, teasing me. In the fog of lust descending upon my brain, I realized he was mouthwateringly sexy and I intended to taste every bit of him, whether he wanted it or not. Judging from his panting and the way his shimmering green eyes seemed to have darkened in spite of the bright rays of sun catching in them, he was very much up for it.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go inside. I want to do a lot of naughty things to you,\u201d I whispered against his mouth. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t wait that long.\u201d His voice was deep and hoarse, and reflected my own desire. And oh, that accent! I had to ask him about it...as soon as we were done. If I managed to remember. Because right now I was having a hard time controlling everything, from my labored breathing to the way my heart seemed to want to storm out of my chest.</p><p>No man\u2019s scent, or voice, had ever headed straight for my panties like this. I appreciated a deep rumble just like any other woman, but Jett\u2019s baritone was heavenly. He had me panting with nothing more than a whiff and a few words. And don\u2019t even get me started on his dreamy eyes and luscious body.</p><p>I took a sharp breath and let his tongue invade my mouth with perfect precision, each lick and tug on my lips sending flames through my body as he pressed me harder into the railing and opened my legs with one motion of his knee. My nipples beaded on contact with his knowledgeable fingers and heat began to pool between my legs.</p><p>\u201cJett.\u201d His mouth stifled my moan. His hands continued to caress my body through my thin top and skirt. Next thing I knew my top was gone and my bra unclasped. My breasts spilled into his open palms, ready to be touched and given his undivided attention. His mouth left mine and moved south. Closing my eyes and dipping my head back, I gave in to the exquisite sensation of his rough tongue rasping the sensitive skin of my breasts. His relentless fingers began to knead my breasts while his mouth kept torturing my nipples, biting, licking, sucking\u2014a bit of all of them at once. My head began to spin from all the different sensations flooding my body, and I groaned something that sounded vaguely like \u2018more.\u2019</p> <p>\u201cI love the sexy sounds you make when you\u2019re horny, baby. Can you say it one more time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>I could feel the slow clenching within my lower abdomen, the heat gathering in my clit as my senses awakened to the sensual pleasure his mouth sent through my breasts. The sensations consumed me, made me want to beg him to\u2014</p><p>Stop?</p><p>Continue?</p> <p>I couldn\u2019t decide.</p><p>I moaned as Jett\u2019s mouth traveled down my belly and his tongue dipped into my navel, working his way to my inner thighs.</p><p>\u201cLift your leg for me,\u201d Jett said, hitching my skirt up to my waist and then my panties down to my ankles. I stepped out of them and, bending my knees, I propped my foot against the railing, my heated flesh exposed to his touch and his hungry look.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so beautiful and wet.\u201d His voice came low and hoarse\u2014filled with a desire matching mine.</p><p>And then his lips were on me, his tongue inside me, licking and thrusting through my damp folds. Slow at first, then faster, pausing only to flick his tongue over my sensitive clit, torturing me even more. A whimper escaped my lips as an electric jolt ran through my entrance and my sex clenched with need for him.</p><p>I gazed down at him and our eyes connected in that ancient language of sex that knows no words\u2014just sweet all-consuming sensation. If he kept up the torture, I\u2019d come. But I didn\u2019t want to\u2014not yet.</p> <p>\u201cFuck me.\u201d It wasn\u2019t a plea; it was a demand. And Jett knew it because he instantly let go of me. Grinning, he came up and captured my mouth in a heated kiss. His lips and tongue tasted of my wetness and that turned me on even more. At the periphery of my mind, I registered his hands between our bodies, removing his jeans and pulling down his shorts. My fingers moved to caress him, eager to gift him the same kind of pleasure he had gifted me, but his erection was between my legs already. Lifting me up and pressing my back into the railing, he entered me in one swift motion. A groan tore from Jett\u2019s lips as he pushed his entire length into me and began to thrust in long, hard movements. My sex began to tighten on him as he swelled marginally within me and I gasped in pleasure, the shock of how big he was almost making me come.</p><p>\u201cMore, baby?\u201d</p><p>Jett\u2019s eyes bore into me with such intensity I felt the fragile walls of my heart crumbling at his feet. He was so beautiful, so perfect in his lust for me, I wanted to stay buried in his arms, with him inside me, forever. Our bodies united, we moved together beyond time and space, drowning in each other\u2019s desire. There was no more to the world than sensation\u2014thrilling and demanding and aching\u2014as our souls collided and our damp bodies met time and time again, until I knew we were about to become one.</p><p>Burying his head in the crane of my neck, I felt Jett\u2019s hot breath on my skin, whispering how beautiful I was, how much he wanted me. Against the glaring brightness of the sun, I closed my eyes and tightened on his erection. He pulsed between my legs and his breathing quickened, signaling his release was imminent.</p><p>With a last shudder, I gave myself to him as my whole being shattered around him in a million pieces. Faintly, I felt his hand on my clit as he pulsed inside me, once, twice, with my name on his lips, and his other hand buried in my hair. A hot jolt of lightning seared my clit a moment before his moisture surged through my sex. Our bodies began to melt into one another as we claimed our climaxes together as one.</p><p>Eventually, after what seemed like an eternity must have passed, he lifted me up in his arms and carried me into the bedroom. With the soft fragrance of his sheets and the heady scent of our lovemaking still clinging to our skin, I fell asleep in Jett\u2019s arms.</p><p>Chapter 13</p><p>My head was leaning against the window of Jett\u2019s expensive car, my skin scorching with the promise of another sunburn courtesy of our lovemaking on the boat\u2019s deck. Only thirty minutes to go and I\u2019d be back in my normal world, away from Jett\u2019s presence, and already I felt like I was missing him\u2014even though he was sitting right beside me, steering the car through the country lanes at a leisurely speed.</p> <p>The sun was setting, coloring the sky in dark shades of red, bronze, and copper. Soon the sky would darken and display the moon and the stars. It was my favorite time of the day\u2014the few minutes between day and night, when it wasn\u2019t quite either. I was ready for my next first with Jett.</p><p>\u201cTired?\u201d Jett asked, shooting me a sideway glance.</p><p>I nodded and returned his smile. \u201cA bit. Thanks for the date. I had a great day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo did I. I\u2019d like to do it again.\u201d He winked and turned his attention back on the road.</p><p>My cheeks caught fire at his insinuation.</p><p>\u201cThe boat\u2019s amazing. No wonder you spend so much time on it.\u201d I laughed out loud, thinking how wonderful it must be to live on a boat. Be carefree. Do whatever you feel like doing.</p><p>\u201cOnce you\u2019ve figured out what to do with the estate and everything\u2019s settled, we\u2019ll set sail for a week,\u201d Jett said. \u201cMaybe even travel the world or, in this case, the world\u2019s waters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds amazing.\u201d I leaned back in my seat and closed my eyes for a moment, savoring his presence. It felt so good to be near him, with him. I couldn\u2019t wait to spend more time together and get to know each other. Like really find out everything about him, including favorite color, hopes and wishes, the stuff of his nightmares, and what brought a smile to his perfect face. I couldn\u2019t just ask without seeming to be inquisitive fan girl material, so my best bet was to get him to talk.</p><p>\u201cYou asked me if I could swim,\u201d I began. \u201cI can, but I wish I could dive. When I was younger I had the dream to live underwater among corals and fish, which is weird because I\u2019m scared of drowning. I bet you can scuba dive, huh?\u201d</p><p>His fleeting look shot to the rearview mirror and his foot stepped on the accelerator.</p><p>Not the elaborate answer, or interest, I had been hoping for. I held on to the armrest for support and thought of another angle I could go. \u201cWhat are you scared of?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot sure.\u201d His voice came a little brisk.</p><p>Okay.</p><p>His sudden reticence was making meaningful conversation difficult. I turned to regard him, but his focus was on the road ahead.</p><p>\u201cJett?\u201d I touched his arm gently to get his attention.</p><p>He frowned but didn\u2019t turn. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you tired? Or would you rather not talk? Because I\u2019m fine with the latter.\u201d I tried to infuse as much nonchalance into my voice as I could muster. All guys were weird every now and then, right? If he needed a bit of space, I could give him that.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He shook his head, his gaze moving to the rearview mirror again. \u201cSorry, baby, I\u2019m a little distracted right now.\u201d</p><p>He was probably not interested in all my boring stuff. Of course, as a woman I tended to drone on forever, so I decided to lighten up his mood.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s still so much thinking to do about the estate\u2019s future, but I want you to know that I\u2019m seriously considering your job offer.\u201d I narrowed my eyes on him. His face was tense in concentration on the road ahead. A deep line had formed between his brows. \u201cThe pay raise sounds great and I\u2019ve always wanted to be a team manager.\u201d</p><p>It was my clue to him that I wanted to work with him again. I thought the idea would please him.</p><p>No answer.</p><p>Seriously?</p><p>I frowned. That wasn\u2019t quite the response I expected. I had never seen him this quiet. Something was wrong with him.</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to switch on the music?\u201d I asked.</p><p>He changed gears and the car sped forward. My heart began to hammer in my chest. Even though traffic was slow, a few oncoming cars passed us by, some barely managing to stay on their side of the road.</p><p>The muscles in Jett\u2019s arms strained to hold on to the steering wheel while his eyes remained focused on the road.</p><p>\u201cSlow down!\u201d Maybe he was into dangerous driving but I wasn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, baby,\u201d Jett said calmly.</p><p>\u201cWhat? No! Slow down. What the hell\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>A brief pause, then, \u201cI don\u2019t want to scare you, but I think someone\u2019s chasing us.\u201d His words echoed in my mind.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean? We\u2019re in a car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and someone\u2019s following us,\u201d Jett said slowly. I squirmed in my seat. \u201cNo. Don\u2019t turn around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d The tremble in my voice betrayed the sudden unease gripping my heart. My attention moved to the passenger side mirror and my heart raced in my chest, speeding faster than the car.</p><p>There was a vehicle behind us but it wasn\u2019t driving too close\u2014not like you see in action movies. It wasn\u2019t possible that anyone was chasing us. We were in Italy, and not in a Hollywood movie.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure it\u2019s not just heading the same way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ninety-nine percent sure. I\u2019ve taken several turns, passed several villages, and it\u2019s still behind us.\u201d He checked the rearview mirror again. \u201cCan you note down the license plate?\u201d</p><p>His calm tone, which I suspected was supposed to comfort me, only managed to make me even more nervous.</p><p>I fished my phone out of my handbag and typed in the numbers and letters I could decipher from the rearview mirror, damning my phone for having small buttons that made typing with trembling fingers a nightmare.</p><p>\u201cShould I call for help?\u201d I asked, figuring even if I knew the emergency number, I didn\u2019t speak a word Italian.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got this,\u201d Jett said. \u201cJust get the plate.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As I made sure to save the registration number, the car behind neared us with full speed, closing in. A hundred feet, thirty, twenty, ten, three\u2014all in a matter of seconds.</p><p>\u201cOh my god, Jett. Watch out!\u201d I screamed a moment before the car bumped ours, giving us enough of a nudge to send me forward in my seat. The engine roared as our pursuers pushed to overtake us. For a second, they were almost driving next to us, the side windows so dark I couldn\u2019t see inside.</p><p>\u201cShit!\u201d Jett hit the gas pedal and sped past them. My fingers buried in the armrest, I stifled a scream as the car behind us bumped us again, trying to steer us off the road.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re going to kill us.\u201d My breath came in labored heaps. It wasn\u2019t fear talking; it was knowledge. I just knew we were about to die.</p> <p>\u201cNot happening!\u201d Jett floored the gas pedal, putting some distance between our pursuers and us.</p><p>We reached the narrow roads winding up the mountains. Jett slowed down a little as we entered the first bend.</p><p>\u201cGo, go, go!\u201d I screeched as the other car picked up in speed again, trying to close in on us. Any hope that we might not be a target dissipated into thin air.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d My breath came shallow.</p><p>\u201cAre you wearing your seatbelt?\u201d Jett\u2019s eyes narrowed on the road as we drove higher up the mountain. The car behind us didn\u2019t seem deterred by the poor road conditions, nor the steep stony wall on the driver\u2019s side and the edge followed by a plummeting abyss on my side.</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d I held my breath.</p><p>\u201cThen hold on tighter.\u201d</p><p>The road ahead seemed to narrow and merge into one lane. At our speed, the bends appeared to twist like menacing snakes. I completely forgot about those. But what worried me more was the one-way road that barely provided enough space for one car, let alone two. I grit my teeth and pressed my hand to my heart, praying no oncoming car would head our way, in which case we couldn\u2019t possibly halt on time. We\u2019d collide, we\u2019d crash, and we\u2019d die.</p><p>Please dear Lord, keep us safe.</p><p>A scream formed in the back of my throat, but the sound never made its way out. Fear grabbed me, strangled me, until I could do nothing but hold on for dear life.</p><p>\u201cOh god, oh god,\u201d I chanted to myself as Jett maneuvered the bends, each time jerking the wheel to the max, each time sending my body through hell as we neared the edge on my side of the road. I couldn\u2019t even look behind, because each time I glanced in the mirror, all I could focus on was the abyss below. If the other car collided with ours, we\u2019d plummet hundreds of feet into whatever was down there. Or we\u2019d crash against the mountain cliff.</p> <p>\u201cYou okay, baby?\u201d Jett\u2019s voice was surprisingly calm in the midst of the storm. \u201cWe\u2019ll make it out of this.\u201d</p><p>How? They\u2019re still behind us, I wanted to scream, but all that came out of my throat was a whimper. Fear held me paralyzed and it was nothing like in the movies. I was sweating, the car was roaring excessively, and were those holes beneath our tires? I could feel each bump; I could feel the gravity of the car; and there was no way one could stay composed, relaxed, and cool.</p><p>The car was driving at a high speed\u2014fast enough to send us over the edge if Jett lost control of the wheel even for a nanosecond or didn\u2019t slow down enough at the right time. Yet he maneuvered expertly through each nightmare turn. There was no way on earth somebody with normal driving skills could ever do that.</p><p>Already I could see two officers knocking on my mother\u2019s door, relaying the news that I was dead, the headline reading \u2018speeding couple crashing on picturesque Italian vacation\u2019 followed by the words \u2018tragic accident.\u2019 Poor Sylvie would blame herself. Knowing her, she\u2019d probably blame Jett, too, thinking he tried to kill me on purpose. Life was so unfair I wanted to scream.</p><p>\u201cHold on,\u201d Jett said. I opened my eyes, only now noticing I must have closed them at some point. We were nearing another bend on the wicked road to hell, after which the road seemed to decline.</p><p>We had reached the top of the mountain and now we were heading back down.</p><p>This is it. My life ends here\u2014but not before he knows my feelings.</p><p>\u201cJett, I need to tell you something.\u201d I tried to remain calm, which was impossible with the shaking in my voice and the freezing sensation in my limbs.</p> <p>\u201cNot now, baby.\u201d His voice oozed confidence and composure. We took the turn, after which he hit the brake\u2014hard. My head jerked forward and a sharp pain shot through my neck.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I screamed when he unbuckled his seatbelt. The other car was out of view, but I was sure it was still behind us. Everything happened so fast, I doubted more than a few seconds passed. He placed his right arm around my seat and turned to get a better view as he went into reverse in full speed, swerving like a madman. Before I knew it, we were on a narrow byroad I didn\u2019t see before. It wasn\u2019t asphalted, and barely more than a running track with bushes scratching the sides of the car. Probably private property\u2014but who cared?</p><p>Jett stopped the car and switched off the lights, then signaled me to stay quiet. I held my breath as I listened for any sounds. Eventually, I heard an engine and then a car passed us by, oblivious to our hiding place.</p><p>We were alive!</p><p>But it didn\u2019t feel like success.</p><p>I spun to Jett, my hands shaking so bad, I felt like crying. He leaned over and brushed my cheek, composed. Except for the tense muscles and set jaw, there was no indicator of any sort of nervousness, as though no one had trailed us mere seconds ago. Searching for us. Trying to kill us.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be okay, baby.\u201d Jett\u2019s lips pressed against mine in a tender kiss, and then he pulled back and started the engine. \u201cI know what I\u2019m doing.\u201d</p><p>Before I could ask him not to drive again, to just stay hidden\u2014because I couldn\u2019t bear another rollercoaster ride\u2014he reversed and we returned to the main road, speeding off in the direction from which we\u2019d come.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re staying at a hotel,\u201d Jett said. \u201cBetter we stay together tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I whispered, the sound barely making its way out of my throat.</p><p>I didn\u2019t argue with him. I doubted I could even if I\u2019d wanted. My body was frozen from shock. Not even the bumpy road and Jett\u2019s speeding managed to wake me from my daze.</p><p>During the drive to the next city, my eyes remained glued to the rearview mirror, always checking, always praying no one was following us. Even when Jett parked in a hotel\u2019s guest parking lot, I couldn\u2019t stop looking behind my shoulder. Jett had to lead me, his gentle words not quite reaching my mind. Only after checking in, away from the road and the twilight chasing scene, did I realize he\u2019d saved my life.</p><p>Resting on the hotel bed, it seemed to take me forever to wake up from my comatose stage, but eventually my heart and mind jolted back to life and reality. Maybe it was because of Jett\u2019s strong arms around me, soothing me, breathing his strength into me as he gently kissed my forehead. He had booked us a room for the night, and as usual, he chose to go for the most expensive option available, claiming the security was better. I wasn\u2019t convinced.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to worry about. It\u2019s over now. You\u2019re safe, baby,\u201d Jett whispered and pushed a glass of water into my still trembling hands, silently urging me to drink up. I forced myself to take tiny sips and swallow them down, even though my throat still felt choked.</p><p>He took the half-full glass out of my hand and placed it on the bedside table. \u201cI need to find another parking spot for the car. Will you be okay if I leave you alone for a few minutes?\u201d</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t leave the room and don\u2019t answer if anyone knocks. I won\u2019t be long.\u201d He stood but hesitated.</p><p>I shot him a fake reassuring smile. \u201cJust go.\u201d Truth was, I didn\u2019t want to be alone but Jett\u2019s car wasn\u2019t exactly standard. Our pursuers would be able to spy it from a mile away.</p><p>He left reluctantly. I leaned back against the pillows but didn\u2019t dare close my eyes. My ears strained to listen for any strange sounds. Apart from the ice vending machine in the hallway whirring once, everything remained as quiet as a tomb. After what seemed like ages, Jett returned.</p><p>\u201cWe should call the police,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cNo. We can\u2019t. It\u2019s too dangerous.\u201d Lying down next to me, he pushed a stray strand of hair back from my face and pulled me into his arms. Inhaling his scent, I settled against his warm body.</p><p>I remembered that he thought the police were involved in the club, consequently I agreed it might not be a good idea.</p><p>\u201cDo you know who those people were?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll try to find out tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>He made it sound like there were many options, when the lead was pretty obvious: I inherited a property that used to be a gathering place for weirdoes. I just didn\u2019t realize their way to handle problems was killing the heir. Why couldn\u2019t people just get together to resolve problems through talking, preferably over coffee and cake\u2014and not behave like war seeking apes attempting to silence us by sending us into an early grave?</p><p>I propped on one elbow and regarded Jett\u2019s beautiful face. \u201cIt\u2019s the club, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmh.\u201d He avoided my gaze.</p><p>\u201cI have to call Sylvie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot happening.\u201d His arm wrapped around my waist, holding me in place. \u201cIn fact, switch off your phone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to warn her.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cPeople can track down a GPS. Keep it switched off.\u201d</p><p>My chin shot up defiantly. Sylvie was my best friend. I had dragged her into this mess. If something happened to her, I\u2019d never forgive myself.</p><p>\u201cBrooke, listen to me. They\u2019re after you and if you reach out to her, they might harm her to get to you.\u201d His tone was grave, reinforcing the warning in his words.</p><p>They.</p><p>I swallowed down the lump in my throat. Jett sat up and squatted in front of me. His hands squeezed mine and our gazes interlocked.</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re scared, Brooke,\u201d he said calmly. \u201dBut you have to trust me. Sylvie will be okay. I\u2019ll text her in your name so she knows you\u2019re not coming home. And I\u2019m sending someone over to watch the house. We stay here just this one night. Pretend nothing happened. And tomorrow I\u2019ll take care of things.\u201d</p><p>How, I wanted to ask. He didn\u2019t know who those people were. We had no idea where to begin.</p><p>And pretend nothing happened? I snorted. Not likely. I could maybe forget the car chasing us and be grateful that we were still alive. But as sure as the sky\u2019s blue, I couldn\u2019t push the images of our various close encounters with death out of my mind, nor the endless possibilities of what could happen to us\u2014or Sylvie.</p><p>Just because we escaped didn\u2019t mean the nightmare was over.</p><p>\u201cNothing happened. No one was killed.\u201d Jett\u2019s fingers began to massage the tense muscles in my shoulders. Somehow his touch calmed me a little until I felt the waves of fear slowly dissipating.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re safe and that\u2019s all that matters,\u201d he whispered. God, I loved that voice. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I leaned into his touch and regarded him.</p><p>\u201cWhere did you learn to drive like that?\u201d</p><p>He blinked once, twice. \u201cWhat?\u201d Confusion crossed his features, as if he wasn\u2019t expecting my question. The reaction intrigued me.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know anybody who can drive like you. Except for my ex but he had lots of training.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYour ex?\u201d Jett\u2019s brows shot up. Was he jealous? Amidst the surrealism of the situation, I smiled because his sudden scowl was priceless.</p><p>Jett and jealous?</p><p>Who would\u2019ve figured?</p><p>It wasn\u2019t like me to talk about previous relationships, but something told me Jett wouldn\u2019t let this one go.</p><p>\u201cYeah, my ex is a professional racer.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhen did you\u2014\u201c</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s long over.\u201d I waved my hand. \u201cWeeks ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWeeks?\u201d A nerve began to twitch on his forehead. He sat down on the bed, making sure not to touch me. Now he was angry.</p><p>\u201cJett, it\u2019s over. It wasn\u2019t even a relationship, or anything.\u201d I took his hand. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t the real deal.\u201d</p><p>It was the truth. Cameron wasn\u2019t looking for commitment. Neither was I. We had an on and off relationship, a friends-with-benefits thing\u2014more of the benefits, less of the friendship part.</p><p>\u201cIt meant nothing. I never loved him,\u201d I whispered. \u201cHe couldn\u2019t compete with you even if he wanted.\u201d His expression lit up a little bit.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m the better catch, huh?\u201d</p><p>I punched his arm playfully, my eyes willing his beautiful lips to smile. \u201cI\u2019m glad he and I broke up,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good to hear because I want you all for myself.\u201d</p><p>I wrapped my arms around Jett and buried my face against his broad chest in the hope my embrace could convey the magnitude of my feelings for him. His tension was still palpable and hundreds of unspoken questions lingered in the air. But I could also feel his unwillingness to start a senseless argument, for which I was grateful.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s focus on the present.\u201d My fingers traced the contours of his chin. In spite of his stubble, his skin felt amazingly soft beneath my fingertips. He smelled so good, so manly, I could be with him, and only him, forever.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d He lay back and pulled me on top of him. I relaxed in the comfort of his arms, but my question still burned on my mind.</p><p>\u201cSo, how did you learn to drive like that, Jett?\u201d My fingers gingerly played with the buttons of his shirt. \u201cAnd don\u2019t say through driving lesson, or courses, because training alone isn\u2019t enough. What I saw is experience\u2014and lots of it.\u201d</p><p>He heaved an exasperated sigh. Hesitating, he ran his hand through his hair, as if considering how much to tell me. \u201cYou\u2019re right. I did stuff.\u201d</p> <p>Lifting up on one elbow, I tried to make sense of his cryptic statement by reading his body language, which was difficult from the way he lay on his back with his hands propped under his head, staring at the ceiling, his eyes expressionless.</p><p>\u201cYou said that before,\u201d I prompted.</p><p>\u201cI was involved in underground car races,\u201d Jett mumbled, hesitating again.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I prompted again.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re not like what you see on sports channels, Brooke. There\u2019s no one to inspect your car and change your tires. We raced for money and reputation, mostly in huge storage halls and parking buildings. Sometimes outside on quiet streets or mountain roads.\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed on me and a glint appeared. Sensing the magnitude of what he was about to tell me, I held my breath, not daring to move or touch him in case he changed his mind and bottled up again.</p><p>\u201cIt started after...uhm...my father threw me out when I was sixteen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did he do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEver since my mother left, I\u2019d been harboring a grudge against him, you know, questioning his authority and the way he used to demand respect when he had never really behaved like a father. My tendency to confront him in front of other people embarrassed him. He kept saying I was endangering his company with my behavior, so I chose to do the opposite of what he wanted. And in the end he threw me out. I stayed with my friends, many of them older than me. They kept me off the streets and taught me how to drive and how to fight, which is how things started. The fact that my life didn\u2019t mean a damn thing to me made me bold and reckless, and hell bent on winning. At some point, I was addicted to adrenaline.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean fighting, like Kung Fu?\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cLet me guess. You were just thinking of Bruce Lee?\u201d</p><p>I smirked. \u201cMore like Jackie Chan. I used to love that guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope not in the literal sense.\u201d His eyes bore into me. So beautiful. So deep. \u201cIt was nothing professional. No gloves, no protective headgear.\u201d</p><p>Hot, hot, hot!</p><p>Did the temperature just soar? Or was it my blood pressure sending me into the scorching desert at the images running through my mind?</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s pretty rough,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He nodded. \u201cDirect body contact is rough. And you?\u201d The sudden attempt at changing the subject didn\u2019t escape me. I wanted to hear more about his past. I wanted it so bad it hurt, and yet I knew pushing him wasn\u2019t the right way to go. Not with a man like Jett.</p><p>\u201cDid you like sports?\u201d he insisted.</p><p>Seriously? Did he ever look at me?</p><p>\u201cUhm.\u201d I laughed. \u201cI used to swim and run, until I grew those boobs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo heavy lifting then, judging from your breasts...\u201d His gaze traveled to my chest and remained there. He didn\u2019t even pretend not to be staring.</p><p>\u201cOh my god, you\u2019re such a jerk.\u201d I punched him playfully.</p><p>\u201cQuite the contrary. It was meant as a compliment. But just to make sure I\u2019m not wrong, may I touch them?\u201d He grinned that panty-dropping smile of his that always made me want to beg him to do naughty things to me. His hands cupped my breasts and his thumbs began to caress them through the thin material of my top and bra. My nipples instantly hardened, sending a jolt of pleasure through my body.</p><p>\u201cYou may not.\u201d I slapped his hands away, pretending I didn\u2019t want it, but my shallow breathing was a dead giveaway. Jett rolled on his back and pulled me on top of him. His knee pried my legs open and settled between them, rubbing gently against my sex. I suppressed a moan at the wet sensation pooling down there.</p><p>\u201cI made sure to book a room with a whirlpool,\u201d Jett whispered. \u201cYou wanna try it?\u201d His voice oozed sensuality and countless promises of pleasure. \u201cWe could order dinner, and then we could have desert. You get to choose. I\u2019m game for whatever you want.\u201d</p><p>His hand trailed down my stomach and squeezed under my shirt, as his mouth began to place heated kisses on my neck.</p><p>I moaned. \u201cNo alcohol.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think that\u2019s the only way I can get you into bed?\u201d His hoarse chuckle reverberated through me, making me shudder with want.</p><p>Obviously not.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in,\u201d I whispered. \u201cLet\u2019s do this.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 14</p><p>The round whirlpool was big enough to fit several people\u2014not that the thought of others joining us appealed to me. One person was more than enough for me. I watched Jett as he slowly peeled off his clothes, with each piece revealing more of his delicious body. And then he was standing in front of me, with only his underwear to hide his impressive modesty. Towering at over six feet, his height both intimidated and fascinated me. The tattoos both attracted and aroused me. He felt my gaze on his manhood and let out a deep sexy breath, the sound vibrating through my lower abdomen. I knew what came next, and the prospect of seeing him completely naked excited me. I couldn\u2019t wait to get my hands on him.</p><p>\u201cLet me help you,\u201d he whispered and started to undress me in slow but measured steps, his eyes never leaving mine. Those sinful eyes that never failed to light my whole being on fire. His hands pulled my top over my head and then unzipped my skirt, taking all the time in the world when I didn\u2019t feel particularly patient.</p><p>Standing in front of him in my panties and my bra, my hands slid down his hard torso. His fingers gripped my chin and forced my face up to look at him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sexy, Brooke, but today I can\u2019t give you what you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019s that?\u201d My voice was hoarse yet playful, pretending not to know he was talking about sex, while my hands continued to caress his naked chest. He moaned as my fingers moved further south, rubbing over the well-defined bulge beneath his shorts. \u201cAre you giving in yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d A soft hiss escaped his throat. \u201cAnd you should stop before I change my mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I don\u2019t want you to,\u201d I purred, my hand continuing to stroke his length. I almost squealed with delight as he began to grow in size before my eyes. \u201cMaybe this is exactly what I need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, baby.\u201d He shook his head and closed his eyes for a brief moment. His face was a mask of desire but he fought it hard, which both infuriated and delighted me because I loved a challenge. His eyes opened again and he regarded me with so much determination I knew I had to step up my game.</p><p>\u201cSo far we\u2019ve focused on sex only,\u201d Jett whispered. \u201cToday I want to give you romance because it\u2019s our first official date.\u201d</p><p>He was doing it all backwards!</p><p>My body was craving for him. I didn\u2019t mind doing him on our first official date at all. Come to think of it, we had done it already but that was just the appetizer.</p><p>\u201cAh, our first date.\u201d I laughed out loud. \u201cYou\u2019ve given me a date I think I\u2019ll never forget for the rest of my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think or you\u2019re sure about that?\u201d His mouth curled into a stunning smile. I wanted to run my fingers through his unruly hair and suck his lower lip into my mouth, biting and teasing so hard he\u2019d beg for mercy.</p><p>\u201cI was whisked away on a ship and then you saved my life.\u201d My hands moved beneath his shorts and pulled them down, revealing his splendid erection. My gaze glued to it, I licked my lips with anticipation at taking him deep into my mouth.</p><p>\u201cBrooke, stop looking at me like that.\u201d His words carried just the right amount of a warning to make me giggle but not avert my gaze.</p><p>\u201cWhat more could I want for in a date?\u201d I said. \u201cI think your efforts deserve a reward.\u201d My fingers wrapped around the base of his manhood and lingered there. \u201cAnd I know where to start.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot sex. You can repay me in a different way,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>I wanted to point out that I didn\u2019t feel like owing him anything. Truth be told, I liked the idea of pleasing him. It turned me on. It made me wet just thinking about it, picturing him at my mercy.</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d I ran my fingertips up and down his swollen shaft until he stopped my hand from moving, rubbing, anything that I knew would make him give in.</p><p>\u201cYou could learn scuba diving with me. Isn\u2019t that what you said you always wanted to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you weren\u2019t listening,\u201d I said, surprised that he remembered my monologue in the car. \u201cYou\u2019re a really good driver. Were you even afraid when those people were after us? It didn\u2019t look like you broke a sweat.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And once again his lips curved into a wicked smile. Through my lowered lids, I couldn\u2019t see if it was because of my compliment or because he was pulling down my panties, and seeing how wet I was for him.</p><p>\u201cNo, Brooke.\u201d His electrifying green eyes brushed my breasts, and settled on the small strip of hair between my legs. Even though he wasn\u2019t touching me, I could almost feel him between my legs and the anticipation drove me crazy. \u201cIt was nothing compared to the fear I felt when you were gone. Nothing will ever top that fog of dread I fell into when I realized I might come too late...when I should\u2019ve trusted you from the beginning.\u201d</p><p>My breath caught in my throat.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t know. Trust is earned, isn\u2019t it?\u201d I said gently.</p> <p>\u201cIt is.\u201d His voice was soft like the breeze. \u201cI don\u2019t want to lose you ever again, Brooke. It was hard for me to let you go.\u201d His fingers unclasped my bra and he threw it on top of the pile of clothes to our feet. His hands moved to my breast, and the kneading and light pinching sent warm shivers through my body. His lips trailed down from my neck to my shoulders, resting there, and I could feel his breath on my skin, both his touch and words making me dizzy.</p><p>\u201cI wanted what\u2019s best for you, what I thought would make you happy, even though it wasn\u2019t any of my business... but letting you go wasn\u2019t even the hardest part.\u201d</p><p>I held my breath and regarded him, listening hard so I wouldn\u2019t miss a word because I wanted to remember this moment forever.</p><p>\u201cThe hardest part was acknowledging I might never see you again. Realizing how much you mean to me and how much I\u2019d miss your pretty face every morning and night. Realizing all the things I didn\u2019t do with you and might never get a chance to. But I think most of the pain came from the realization that the time we spent together was not enough for me and I couldn\u2019t force you to feel the same way.\u201d</p><p>His words were like honey. It was all so sweet, so dark, so unexpected that it shook me to the very core. More beautiful than anything I ever dared to hope for.</p> <p>\u201cMaybe I missed you, too.\u201d I said, trying to play it cool. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t easy on my part, either.\u201d My words were already so choked, I doubted I\u2019d be able to say much more.</p><p>Jett helped me into the whirlpool and sat down on the bottom, the hot water barely reaching his shoulders. Realizing my height wouldn\u2019t give me that advantage, I settled for the second upper step next to him, the water barely covering my breasts. The water bubbled, hiding his sculpted body, which was a shame because I couldn\u2019t stop looking at him.</p><p>As if sensing my thoughts, he turned to face me. A flicker of mischief played in his eyes and his lips trailed down from my neck to my waiting nipples. His teeth grazed the hard tip of my breast a moment before his tongue flipped over it as I buried my fingers into his hair and demanded more of his mouth\u2019s grazing and flicking. And then the sucking.</p><p>Oh god.</p><p>Either the temperature in the water just went up, or he got me boiling inside.</p><p>\u201cI want to enjoy every minute with you,\u201d Jett said. His eyes bore into me, drinking me in, swallowing me up whole.</p> <p>\u201cAs long as it lasts, huh?\u201d I didn\u2019t remark that was my biggest fear\u2014that we\u2019d be over before we even started.</p><p>\u201cAnd I hope that\u2019s a long time,\u201d Jett whispered.</p><p>In one swift motion he inched closer and lifted me up, settling me on his lap with my legs spread around him, the water engulfing my sex, prickling the soft flesh. His erection brushed my lower abdomen impatiently, demanding to be allowed entry.</p><p>\u201cOne thing\u2019s for sure, Brooke. I won\u2019t let you go easily next time. In fact there won\u2019t be a next time.\u201d His sexy whisper sent a delicious pull between my legs. His hands pulled my hips so close I could feel his large erection against the secret opening between my legs. I felt myself going wet. There was a beautiful deep ache inside me, asking to be stilled.</p><p>\u201cYou said you couldn\u2019t give me what I wanted today?\u201d Gazing into his impossibly green eyes, I lifted my hips enough to straddle his hard shaft and, as slowly as I could, moved down, every inch sending another delightful contraction through my body. The head of his erection probed my sex, spearing my soft lips, entering me just a little but enough to send a hot wave of pleasure through me. A hard moan escaped his lips as I accommodated more of him.</p><p>\u201cThat can be negotiated.\u201d Jett\u2019s hands settled on my waist, offering the support I needed. I lowered myself onto him just a little bit more, allowing him to stretch me and fill me, until I thought I could take no more of his size\u2014and he wasn\u2019t even half way in. I rode him, my inside clenching as the slow thrusts rubbed a tender spot. As I moaned louder, his breathing became harder. He took charge, his hand pulling my hips down until I could feel his thick, hard erection going so deep I felt like letting go. With every slide, I rocked my hips, the delicious pain radiating more pleasure, breaking more barriers. His movement reached my core, his hunger for release consuming us both and when we came, I could have sworn the burning fire merged us into one.</p><p>Chapter 15</p><p>Everything was so bright. The room, the colors, even my dress. I could hear myself laughing and felt Jett\u2019s arms around me as I squirmed against him, unsure whether to free myself or melt into his embrace.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d do anything for you. You know that?\u201d he whispered into my ear. \u201cIf you fell, I\u2019d hold you. If you were afraid, I\u2019d wrap my arms around you and take away your fears. I\u2019d die to keep you safe but more than anything I\u2019d do whatever it takes to keep you by my side. For you I\u2019d conquer anything, everything, anytime.\u201d</p><p>I smiled against his hot skin and inhaled the fresh, clean scent of his hair. So good. So soft. I felt serene, the world around us forgotten. It was just he and I, and no one else in the world.</p><p>Something soft caressed my shoulder. His lips? His hot breath? My hands reached out to touch him\u2014only to feel the cold, empty space next to me.</p><p>What the\u2014</p><p>Confused, I pried my eyes open and squinted against the unnatural brightness coming from the sun spilling through the windows. My eyes slowly adjusting, I realized Jett\u2019s side of the bed was empty, the sheets crumpled in a heap.</p><p>There I had been thinking he was in bed with me, only to find it had been just a dream. I grimaced, disappointed, and jumped out of bed, scanning the room for any message he might have left. Except for the jacket he had tossed over the back of a chair last night, there was no indication of him, nothing to signal last night even took place. Everything was quiet; the lights in the adjacent bathroom turned off.</p><p>Where the heck was he? Would he sneak out on me after he got what he wanted?</p><p>I grabbed his jacket. It smelled like him: manly, intoxicating. I pressed it against my bare chest and for a moment I closed my eyes to enjoy the images of us kissing\u2014and doing other stuff\u2014flickering through my mind. Either he forgot to take his jacket, or he had left it behind on purpose, which could only mean he\u2019d be back soon. Excitement rushed through me at the prospect of seeing him after everything that happened between us.</p><p>The past twenty-four hours were nothing short of mind-blowing. Scary, yes, but still mind-blowing. The date, the car chase, the sex, the fact that I knew so much about him now. No idea what it all meant for us; whether we were back together. But I couldn\u2019t wait to find out. All I knew was that my fears about him were gone, replaced by a firm belief that I had been wrong about him and he had been telling the truth back in New York. I was in danger and he had tried to protect me from whoever had been following us.</p><p>Standing in front of the hotel mirror, I stared at my reflection and wrinkled my nose in disgust. My dark, naturally curly hair looked a tangled mess. With my makeup gone, dark circles framed my chestnut eyes and made my skin look a pasty yellow shade. To my utter dismay, I realized I had no fresh underwear or clothes, no makeup to fake a glow, no hairbrush, not even a toothbrush. The only two things available to help me scrub up were the hotel\u2019s shampoo and soap.</p><p>At least my cheeks had a soft glow to them and there was a sparkle in my eyes. The signs were there: I was still in love\u2014with Jett.</p><p>Sylvie would be so mad.</p><p>No doubt the moment we\u2019d be back home she\u2019d try to run an intervention, stating my fixation with him was unhealthy.</p><p>However, what she didn\u2019t know was that this love I felt for him, I didn\u2019t seek it out. I had tried to keep my emotional distance, choosing not to let Jett enter my heart. Yet this love\u2014or whatever feeling it was that caused fluttering butterflies and a raging storm inside me\u2014chased me, found me, and finally captured me, holding me tight amidst my fears. The more I fought it, the more it grew. The longer I hid my feelings for him, the harder I fell for him.</p><p>I knew I\u2019d tell Jett someday, but we hadn\u2019t reached that point yet. Maybe because there was a tiny fraction inside my mind that kept warning me we might not be meant to be and only time would tell. The best I could do with now was enjoy it while it lasted.</p><p>I found a trial size toothpaste and damp hotel toothbrush, which I assumed Jett used before leaving, and brushed my teeth quickly. Jumping into the shower, I let the warm water trickle down my body to soothe the ache in my muscles\u2014courtesy of Jett\u2019s insatiable appetite for sex.</p><p>My hands were busy lathering in the hotel\u2019s shampoo when the door cracked open, making me jump.</p><p>\u201cBrooke?\u201d Jett asked. He popped his head through the shower curtain.</p><p>My arms lowered to cover my chest on instinct, but it was too late. Like a wildfire a grin spread across his beautiful lips and he scanned my body up and down, lingering a bit too long on my covered breasts.</p><p>\u201cHi, beautiful.\u201d His voice was soft as velvet and dark as chocolate. I\u2019d recognize that tone blindfolded. Usually it turned me on; right now I wished I had thought of locking the door. He had seen me naked countless times but never like this: under the bright fluorescent light, with no makeup on, and no bed sheets behind which I could hide. I probably looked like shit and didn\u2019t want him to see me this way. Embarrassed, I retreated to the farthest spot in the shower and shot him a frown.</p><p>\u201cCan you wait outside? I\u2019ll be done in a minute.\u201d</p><p>That was his clue to leave, but Jett didn\u2019t move an inch. I licked my lips nervously and kept my breasts covered while the hot water continued to trickle down my body.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so hot.\u201d His tone came low. Scorching. I could say the same thing about him. \u201cYou\u2019re even more beautiful than in my dreams.\u201d</p><p>I searched his face for any signs that he was joking. His smile was gone, replaced by seriousness. His eyes were filled with passion, mirroring my lust. Slowly\u2014with my gaze on him\u2014he stripped off his clothes until he stood naked in front of me. I tried my best to avert my gaze, but couldn\u2019t. The magnetism he exuded held me tight. He was breathtakingly beautiful\u2014a view I could look at over and over again, just like the most fascinating painting.</p><p>His chiseled chest with his dark hair was on full display\u2014all defined muscles and bronze skin. My tongue flicked over my lips as I pried my gaze away from his sculpted chest to the three rows of hard muscles on his abdomen, and finally came to rest on his erection promising to take me to pleasure heaven. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat are you doing, Jett?\u201d</p><p>Stupid question.</p><p>What would anyone think he was doing?</p><p>He joined me in the shower cubicle and gathered me in his arms. The water rained down on us, and for a moment I thought he\u2019d try to get it on. I could only hope he didn\u2019t insist we do it in the shower because I didn\u2019t want to slip and break my neck.</p><p>\u201cCan you pass me the shower gel?\u201d</p><p>I stared at him in confusion as he just grinned at me and reached out to get the bottle, then lathered the foam into his glorious skin. I watched it run down his torso and gather in the soft hair around his manhood.</p><p>\u201cWant me to do your back?\u201d he asked, still grinning.</p><p>I shook my head, unsure whether he was being serious. He was behaving like we were an old couple, comfortable in each other\u2019s presence. And while I was comfortable in his presence, the entire situation had something way too intimate about it.</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019re ready to get out?\u201d There was a sparkle of naughtiness in his eyes.</p><p>Struck speechless, I nodded.</p><p>Jett stepped out of the shower and wrapped a towel around his waist, then draped one around my shoulders. I even let him pat down my wet hair, squeezing the water out of it, until soft waves and ringlets formed. He took one and wrapped it around his fingers, the light tugging sensation making my scalp tingle.</p><p>\u201cI want you to be open for me,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>His eyes mirrored the array of emotions in his voice. For a moment I wasn\u2019t sure which direction this conversation would take\u2014whether he wanted more or whether he was just enjoying keeping me intrigued.</p><p>Jett\u2019s hands trailed from my breasts down my hips and then with no warning he lifted me up in one swift motion, as though I weighed nothing. My cheeks heated up at the new and intimate way he pressed me against his naked body. Gathering my arms around his neck, I let him carry me into the bedroom and lay me down on the unmade bed, our limbs entangling, mouths finding each other.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want me to do?\u201d I asked playfully.</p><p>\u201cI want you to be open for me,\u201d he whispered again, his eyes reflecting the desire in his voice. He pulled my towel away and removed my hands from my breasts. \u201cI want you to be the one asking for it.\u201d</p><p>His authoritarian tone built a strong contrast to his gentle actions. His thumb was stroking my face, his wet hair was dropping on my skin, the coldness making me shiver. And yet, his kiss was hot, devouring my mouth, his hand going lower to explore my breasts, my hips, my legs.</p><p>\u201cI want you,\u201d I murmured.</p><p>\u201cNot need me?\u201d He raised his eyebrows, his erection pressing against my legs.</p><p>\u201cI want you, I need you. What\u2019s the difference? I\u2019m open to anything.\u201d I removed his towel from his hips, eager to taste him, to feel him, to have him inside me. I knew I was wet.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d be surprised.\u201d He pushed me down and his hands wrapped around my wrists. Gazing into my eyes, he pushed inside me, making love to me until we were both succumbing to an orgasmic release.</p><p>Later, I lay in his arms, gathering my breath, my hands trailing up and down his sculpted torso, marveling at the smoothness of his skin and the hardness of his muscles. He was perfect.</p><p>\u201cI hope I\u2019m the reason behind your smile,\u201d Jett said, stroking my cheek. His statement caught me off guard. I hadn\u2019t even realized I was smiling.</p> <p>\u201cMmh.\u201d I placed a soft kiss on his chin and regarded him lovingly.</p><p>Do people not smile after sex? Was it just hormones or something else?</p><p>Less than three days ago, I had been unhappy. Actually being unhappy was an understatement. I felt betrayed, lost, deeply hurt, and heartbroken. How strange he had been the reason why I tumbled into my second lowest point in life, and yet all it took to pull me out of it was for him to re-enter the picture. His words and actions had both killed my hope and rekindled it. He had destroyed and shattered my love only to conquer it again. If he hadn\u2019t persisted in trying to reach out to me, I would never have known he didn\u2019t hurt me on purpose and we wouldn\u2019t be where we were today\u2014in each other\u2019s arms.</p><p>\u201cI love it when you smile,\u201d he whispered. \u201cBut I love it even more when I see your smile and know I was the one who caused it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaving sex three times in less than twenty four hours would make anyone happy,\u201d I replied.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all thanks to you, Ms. Stewart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d I cocked a brow. He pretty much instigated all of them. \u201cWhat about you? You were the one to initiate them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI followed your thoughts\u2019 command. Besides, I\u2019m just human. I can\u2019t help myself when you\u2019re around me. You can\u2019t blame a man for being weak at a vixen\u2019s feet.\u201d</p><p>The way his eyes glimmered with mischief I wanted to do him again, even though my body screamed \u2018no more.\u2019</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t do anything,\u201d I pointed out.</p><p>\u201cExactly. You didn\u2019t do anything.\u201d Jett\u2019s gaze bore into me, touching my soul. \u201cI\u2019m not perfect. God knows I have many weaknesses, but my biggest one happens to be you, Brooke.\u201d</p><p>His words made my smile widen. He was piling on the compliments. Coming from any other man, they would\u2019ve hit on nothing but a brick wall. But coming from Jett, I wanted to hear more, absorb each word, and cherish it forever. If there was one person in the world whose words were special, it was Jett.</p><p>Feeling a need for a bathroom break, I entangled myself from him and only noticed the tray on the table upon my return. It held two cups of coffee, two plates with croissants and another two plates of bagels with fresh cheese spread. My gaze settled on the small violet gift box almost hidden between the coffee and the plates.</p><p>\u201cI woke up early. You were still asleep so I thought I\u2019d get us breakfast.\u201d Walking over, Jett pointed at the tray and cleared his throat, answering the question I had been asking myself since waking. \u201cI know last time didn\u2019t go so well but I figured why not give it another try? I hope you\u2019ll like it.\u201d</p><p>He picked up the tiny box and handed it to me.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d My throat constricted. My legs began to shake again, so I sat down and left my fingers trail over the gift box.</p><p>It was surprisingly heavy for its size. The shiny satin-feel paper shimmered in the sunlight spilling through the window. I untied the white ribbon, and opened the lid, then removed the black cover. Even before I saw it, I knew what it contained, but the knowledge didn\u2019t quite register in my consciousness until I saw it before my eyes. Sitting on a black velvet mount was a sleek steel watch with a silver wrist bangle and tiny gemstones that sparkled like diamonds.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>And, judging from the feel and look, expensive.</p><p>\u201cI thought it might be the perfect gift so you\u2019re never late again for our dates.\u201d</p><p>I grimaced at him, unsure whether to feel offended or laugh. In the end, amusement won.</p><p>\u201cSeriously?\u201d I glanced up, biting my lip.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just kidding. I got it a while back.\u201d He slumped down in the chair next to mine and regarded me coolly. \u201cCall it intuition. Come one, take it out.\u201d</p><p>I gingerly removed the watch from its box, and was about to unfasten the clasp, when I noticed something was engraved on the back.</p><p>\u201cIn the stream of life, I\u2019ll always search for you. As time goes by, you\u2019ll always be on my mind. Jett. Did you come up with this?\u201d My questioning gaze searched his, begging him to tell me he had picked it up from somewhere and it didn\u2019t mean anything.</p><p>Jett nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s the way I feel.\u201d</p><p>For a few seconds, I was utterly and deeply moved, unable to say a word. My throat constricted, and my eyes swelled up with moisture. I forced myself to take slow breaths, so I wouldn\u2019t give away the storm of emotions tormenting me inside. The bathing suit was one thing\u2014an expensive gift but nothing too personal. I could give it back, because I didn\u2019t want to feel like I had been bought. But the watch was an entirely different situation. The personal message showed me he cared about me and I couldn\u2019t be happier that we reconnected, but more than anything I was happy there was still an us.</p><p>I wanted him to know just how much I loved him and yet I kept silent as I kissed him in complete abandonment of my heart, my brain racing to engrave every little detail about him forever.</p><p>\u201cThank you. It\u2019s...I want to say beautiful but that\u2019s an understatement.\u201d</p><p>His hand touched my chin and he moved closer until we were barely an inch apart. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing, Brooke. It\u2019s just a watch. Promise me that you\u2019ll keep it.\u201d</p><p>Ever so gently he lowered his soft gorgeous lips onto mine. I breathed in his heavenly scent, savouring his proximity, the moment.</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d I whispered forcing a smile to my lips. \u201cI will treasure it forever.\u201d</p><p>Even if things weren\u2019t meant to last, I wanted to at least remember, because in the end my memory could be the only thing left.</p><p>Chapter 16</p><p>The room smelled of fresh butter croissants. The coffee cups were on the table, untouched, almost forgotten now. Jett\u2019s hand kept touching mine as he fidgeted with the box, waiting for me to stop gushing.</p><p>Our first night together in a hotel room.</p><p>Our first breakfast together after spending the night in a hotel room and having sex in a whirlpool.</p><p>The first gift I ever accepted from him.</p><p>I made a mental note of all of those things because, ever since meeting Jett, I had been counting all my firsts with him: the first time we used certain words and phrases, the things we did together for the first time, the first activities we planned together. My brain had become a huge scrapbook of first memories together and I couldn\u2019t wait to fill it with more of those.</p><p>\u201cLet me help you.\u201d Jett took the watch from my hands and clasped it around my wrist. I held it up to admire it. It was the perfect size with the right feel.</p><p>\u201cI love it,\u201d I said again. And I did, but I also hated the feeling of not having something to give back. So I was more than eager to buy him a gift\u2014something unique, something to remind him of this occasion, which I hoped was as special to him as it was to me.</p><p>\u201cIt suits you beautifully,\u201d Jett said, placing a soft kiss on my wrist.</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d I smiled and felt myself melting against the magic of his lips.</p><p>\u201cI switched on your phone while you were busy in the shower.\u201d His lips trailed up my naked arm and collarbone, until he found my special spot below my chin.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d I moaned softly.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>I felt him smiling and wrapped my arms around his strong shoulders, clasping them behind the nape of his neck.</p><p>\u201cSylvie might have called a few times,\u201d Jett whispered.</p><p>Oh, shit!</p><p>My blood froze in my veins. How the heck could I forget her? She was probably waiting for me, worried that I wasn\u2019t back yet.</p><p>While it wasn\u2019t unusual for her to stay the night away every now and then, it had never happened to me. Besides, we always at least texted our whereabouts. She\u2019d be so mad. No, make that livid.</p><p>\u201cI have to get home,\u201d I said.</p><p>Jett shook his head vehemently. \u201cThat\u2019s not a good idea. You\u2019re not safe. Better we try to find out who followed us first.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBut Sylvie\u2019s all alone in that house. I know her. She\u2019ll freak out if I\u2019m not back soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>I took in his set jaw and the determined glint in his eyes. The more time I spent with Jett, the more I realized I had found my match in him when it came to demonstrating an unhealthy amount of stubbornness. Under any other circumstances I might have given in for the sake of preserving harmony, but not when it came to my best friend\u2019s safety.</p><p>\u201cI need to see it for myself,\u201d I said.</p> <p>Something flickered in his green gaze. Was that annoyance? \u201cI\u2019d rather you stay with me at my house.\u201d</p><p>His offer sounded tempting. His house was huge, beautifully decorated, and not too far from Alessandro\u2019s estate. But\u2014</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cNot happening. I\u2019m not leaving Sylvie alone in that old house. She\u2019s my best friend, Jett. If someone means me harm and I\u2019m not there, they\u2019ll take it out on her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can send someone over,\u201d Jett said.</p><p>Something told me he could keep this conversation up all day.</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d I frowned. \u201cA bodyguard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSort of.\u201d</p><p>I shot him an unconvinced frown. I got it. Jett had money. And lots of it. But a bodyguard\u2014for Sylvie? How would he accomplish that without my best friend\u2019s noticing? Sylvie wasn\u2019t stupid. The moment she\u2019d find out a killer might be after us, Jett might as well hire a bodyguard for himself, too, because Sylvie would end up screaming and blaming him. And when Sylvie was angry I couldn\u2019t vouch for her sanity, or actions.</p><p>\u201cNot working for me.\u201d I shook my head and finished the last drop of my coffee. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Jett, but...I can\u2019t stay. You have to accept that. Now please drive me back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen let me come with you.\u201d</p><p>I almost spilled my coffee. Okay, maybe I didn\u2019t spill it because it was already empty, but you get my point.</p> <p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s not possible either.\u201d I grimaced, struggling with my words. How the heck was I supposed to tell him my best friend didn\u2019t like him anymore and I didn\u2019t want to have to face that storm?</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Jett\u2019s eyes narrowed on me.</p><p>Oh, for crying out loud.</p><p>\u201cSylvie\u2019s\u2014\u201d I grimaced again \u201c\u2014out of sorts with you.\u201d I peered up at him and almost flinched at the flicker of anger in his expression.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t tell her about us.\u201d His eyes were scrutinizing me.</p><p>\u201cNo, no...\u201d I shook my head, then stopped. What was the point in lying when he already knew it? \u201cYes, maybe, a little. I didn\u2019t think it\u2019d make a difference.\u201d</p><p>He frowned, but didn\u2019t comment. My fingers wrapped around his hand in the hope he might feel my turmoil.</p><p>\u201cYou broke my heart, Jett, so naturally you\u2019re the bad guy. She made me promise I\u2019d move on from you and date others. So\u2014\u201d I shrugged and laughed nervously \u201c\u2014she\u2019s thinking I\u2019m moving on from you.\u201d</p> <p>A few moments passed during which he remained silent. I tried my hardest to read his expression, and failed.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Eventually, he heaved a sigh and got up, helping me to my feet.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re okay with it?\u201d I blinked back my surprise. Just like that? During the short time I worked for him, I quickly realized Jett never gave up. What he wanted, he got. And what he couldn\u2019t have, he tried to get nonetheless. \u201cNo conditions, no requests?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, now that you\u2019re mentioning it, I\u2019m taking you home on three conditions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d I regarded him amused. Three conditions, huh? \u201cWhat are they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst, you call me when you\u2019re there and have your phone switched on at all times. Second, I\u2019ll send someone over to watch over you. He\u2019ll keep to himself and you won\u2019t even notice his presence. And there\u2019s no arguing about this condition.\u201d He paused and I raised my brow, choosing not to comment because he seemed quite determined and I just wanted to get home and check on Sylvie, no matter what. \u201cThird, you\u2019ll have to keep your visit short. So tell Sylvie whatever story you need to tell her, but you\u2019re not staying and neither is she. Otherwise I\u2019ll have you both picked up and I\u2019ll use force, if need be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not exactly three requests but five,\u201d I pointed out.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s either you do what I say, or nothing.\u201d</p><p>Talk about an inability to compromise.</p><p>\u201cBrooke?\u201d It wasn\u2019t a question; it was a warning, magnified by the determination in his eyes and the stubborn line on his forehead. He was back to his alpha male ways, trying to protect me, or whatever his male hormones drove him to do.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I said, already regretting giving in so easily. \u201cWill you drive me back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, baby.\u201d He winked, back in his good mood. \u201cJust hold on tight.\u201d</p><p>I rolled my eyes at his choice of words. They seemed to form one of his favorite phrases.</p><p>On the drive back home Jett kept checking the rearview mirror and the more he did, the more my nervousness increased. If it weren\u2019t for the car chase yesterday, I would\u2019ve thought he suffered from paranoia. Jett drove slowly, maybe because he wasn\u2019t used to the rental car he picked up in the morning. Or maybe because he didn\u2019t want to draw any attention to us. Either way, I felt bad for his Lamborghini. Not that it meant anything to me, but because I knew how much he loved it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry about your car,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that bad. She\u2019ll be as good as new in no time.\u201d Jett winked amused and focused back on the road.</p><p>His car was a she?</p><p>Wow! I didn\u2019t know whether he was laughing at me, or trying to annoy me. In the end, I decided to keep my mouth shut.</p><p>Less than half an hour later, the car stopped in front of Alessandro\u2019s house. Turning to say goodbye was the difficult part. It always was. Leaving him, not knowing when I\u2019d see him again, a part of me missing him already even though I hadn\u2019t even left the car yet.</p><p>\u201cThank you for the date,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m glad I came.\u201d</p><p>He shot me his dazzling smile and ran his hand through his hair before settling on the wheel. \u201cI\u2019m thankful for the second chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo am I.\u201d</p><p>He leaned over and our lips met in a short but heated kiss. \u201cRemember, I want you to keep the phone switched on at all times. If you find anything suspicious\u2014no matter how minuscule or ridiculous it might seem\u2014call me and I\u2019ll be there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot it.\u201d I nodded. My eyes remained glued to him, soaking him in. The words \u2018call me\u2019 triggered a memory. \u201cJett, did you call me two days ago, about half an hour after you dropped me off at the spa?\u201d</p><p>His frown showed me he didn\u2019t.</p><p>I pretended not to notice. \u201cI thought I\u2019d ask because the number was private.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t hide my number.\u201d I heard the tension in his voice, the mistrust, and the suspicion. \u201cDid you pick up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but no one replied.\u201d I bit my lip. He studied me for a moment.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I speed-dialed you by accident,\u201d he suggested. \u201cOr maybe it was a friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d I really wanted to believe it because it was a possibility, and yet I couldn\u2019t. In my book coincidences didn\u2019t really exist. \u201cYou\u2019re probably right and it was a friend, though with the time difference, it would\u2019ve been early morning back home and I don\u2019t know anyone who\u2019d be up at that hour.\u201d</p><p>I felt stupid for bringing this up and dragging on the conversation for longer than necessary. I grabbed my handbag from the backseat, when my eyes fell on something half covered by Jett\u2019s leather jacket and stashed in a holster. I had seen a gun before but never touched one in real life.</p><p>\u201cJett?\u201d I moistened my lips, surprised at the calmness in my voice compared to the frantic beating of my heart. \u201cWhat\u2019s a gun doing in your car?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat gun?\u201d</p><p>I stretched to lift his jacket when his hand grabbed mine, stopping me. \u201cDon\u2019t touch it.\u201d His eyes locked with mine.</p><p>I knew. He knew that I knew. And yet he remained silent, probably preferring I had never seen it.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing with a gun and where did you get it?\u201d I asked slowly, my angry gaze demanding an answer.</p><p>\u201cBrooke, you\u2019re not safe.\u201d He shrugged and trailed off, leaving the rest open for interpretation. \u201c I don\u2019t want anything happening to you.\u201d</p><p>Oh, sweet Lord!</p><p>\u201cSo you got a gun? Is that your answer to our problems?\u201d</p><p>Because if it was, I had no idea how to react.</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer straight away. \u201cWhy not? If keeping you safe involves breaking a few rules, then so be it. You don\u2019t need to know more than that.\u201d He moistened his lips and turned to stare out the car window.</p><p>I regarded his profile. Strangely the thought of him having a gun didn\u2019t shock me, not after the few things he shared about his life. What outraged me was the knowledge that I wasn\u2019t afraid.</p><p>As long as nobody got killed and Jett didn\u2019t get into any trouble, I was fine with it.</p><p>I looked at the watch on my wrist. It was 1.15 p.m. In spite of a good night\u2019s sleep and a nourishing breakfast, I felt lightheaded, as though I was floating in a vacuum, unable to focus on more than taking a step after another. So much had happened since I left Sylvie. The date, the proof Jett was on my side, his past, the sex, the pursuit, the discovery of his weapon, his declaration that he cared about me\u2014which wasn\u2019t really that of a surprise because he had said it before. But, with all the drama and emotional baggage gone, it felt different.</p><p>Real.</p><p>Yet I couldn\u2019t tell my best friend a word about it. It was time I cleared up the misunderstanding about Jett, so I wouldn\u2019t have to hide my blossoming relationship from Sylvie anymore. But how I was I supposed to explain everything without sounding like I had a screw loose? And\u2014even worse\u2014how I was I supposed to handle her reaction? Sylvie wasn\u2019t just overprotective; her vices included the inability to forgive when she felt betrayed. I had a nagging feeling that after all the bitching we did about Jett back in New York, dating him would feel like pure betrayal to her.</p><p>Taking a deep steadying breath, I unlocked the front door and entered. The house was deadly quiet, which felt strange. Unnerving. I checked the living room and kitchen, and then walked upstairs to her bedroom, and knocked.</p><p>No answer.</p><p>\u201cSylvie?\u201d I opened the door and peeked inside. Her clothes lay scattered all over the floor. Her handbag was on her unmade bed. I peered inside. Except for her phone and credit card, nothing seemed to be missing.</p><p>An ice-cold knot twisted inside my stomach. Sylvie never left the house without her makeup. Did something happen to her? If something happened, I\u2019d never forgive myself.</p><p>I dashed down the stairs, and double-checked the obvious places\u2014the living room, kitchen, veranda, and backyard. No one in sight.</p><p>\u201cSylvie?\u201d I called as I descended the stony stairs leading toward the woods. Just as I opened my mouth to try again, I spied her on the other side of the pool. She was clad in a bikini, lounging on a chair, her fingers clasped around a cocktail glass. Where the heck did she get that one from? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I heaved a sigh of relief.</p><p>She looked well and safe. Heading for her, I noticed she had her eyes closed and music blaring through the earphones. I leaned over her, figuring she\u2019d notice my presence. She didn\u2019t stir.</p><p>\u201cSylvie?\u201d I squeezed her arm gently.</p><p>Her blue eyes flew open and she almost jumped in her lounger. For an instant, fear crossed her face before she recognized me and then she smiled, which was quickly replaced by a mask of anger. She was truly madly furious.</p> <p>\u201cWhat the fuck, Brooke! You scared the living shit out of me. Where have you been?\u201d she shouted.</p><p>I pointed at her earphones. She removed them but her angry expression didn\u2019t change.</p><p>\u201cWhere have you been?\u201d she repeated. \u201cI had to call the police. I didn\u2019t know what to do.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes were wide with fear and there were dark circles beneath them.</p><p>\u201cOh my god. You did what?\u201d I sat down and wrapped my arm around her shoulders, fearing the worst\u2014that someone threatened her and hurt her. \u201cAre you okay? Did something happen?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat are you talking about? Of course I\u2019m not okay.\u201d Pausing, she took a deep breath and let it out slowly, as though to calm herself. \u201cWhen your best friend goes missing in a place God-knows-where and you\u2019re expected to communicate in a language you don\u2019t speak, obviously you\u2019re scared out of your mind.\u201d Her finger jabbed my chest as her eyes spew fire at me. \u201cYou call. You act like an adult and let your best friend know where you are. You don\u2019t freaking bail.\u201d</p><p>I had never seen her like this. Angry. Hurt. Vulnerable.</p><p>\u201cYou have a funny way of showing,\u201d I said, pointing at the cocktail in her hand.</p><p>\u201cYeah, well. Whatever shit you\u2019re going through, it\u2019s easier when you\u2019re half drunk.\u201d She wrapped the long cord of her headphones around her iPhone, her voice still raw with emotion. \u201cMusic\u2019s the only thing that helps me switch off from imagining all the things that could have happened to you.\u201d</p><p>Drawing her close to me, I hugged her whispering, \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d I truly hoped she could hear the remorse in my voice. I was horribly sorry for inflicting that much worry upon her.</p><p>Sylvie shook her head angrily, rubbing away the moisture in her eyes. \u201cI thought something bad happened to you.\u201d She sounded upset but her tone had calmed down a little.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Sylvie. I know I should have called but you were supposed to get a text message and\u2014\u201d</p><p>The hard edge in my voice made her look up.</p><p>\u201cI got a text message which sounded nothing like you. What happened?\u201d She eyed me up and down suspiciously. Her X-ray gaze brushed over my face and crumbled clothes. \u201cWhere were you?\u201d</p><p>The moment I had been dreading had come. Okay, where to start?</p><p>Good question, Stewart. What about the beginning?</p><p>I took a long steadying breath and let it out slowly. Her eyes fell on the watch and sure enough her jaw dropped.</p><p>\u201cOh my god.\u201d I could almost see her brain working. The moment she put two and two together, her frown changed into a scowl. \u201cYou went out with a guy! Please tell me I\u2019m wrong.\u201d</p><p>She narrowed her eyes at me as she scanned my face, her jaw dropping further.</p> <p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t, Brooke.\u201d</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>\u201cYou little \u2013britch. Who is it?\u201d</p><p>Whenever Sylvie was extremely happy or angry with me, she called me \u2018britch.\u2019 It all dated back to the day we were invited to her boring cousin\u2019s wedding. It was all a big traditional yawn, so Sylvie and I had the idea to ditch the party in favor of Sylvie\u2019s backstage passes to a gig\u2014and a musician guy she had been dying to meet. Happy with my offer but also feeling guilty to miss her cousin\u2019s party, Sylvie had combined the words \u2018bride\u2019 with \u2018bitch\u2019, calling me a \u2018britch.\u2019 It was a whole different story or maybe not so different now, considering I ditched her to meet Jett in secret.</p><p>\u201cUh.\u201d I couldn\u2019t even look into her eyes. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot I didn\u2019t tell you.\u201d</p><p>Fighting for words, I almost expected another of Sylvie\u2019s famous outbursts. What I got instead was a stare with a glint in her eyes that screamed trouble.</p><p>\u201cOh my god.\u201d Her voice was so low I wasn\u2019t sure I heard right. \u201cOh my god. You\u2019re dating him again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSylvie\u2014\u201d I raised my hand to stop her and let me explain but she cut me off.</p><p>\u201cThe signs were there. I should have known no one changes their depressed mood out of the blue. All this time I thought you were moving on, while you were hooking up with Jett.\u201d</p><p>I could pretend she was wrong and bide myself time, but was the point in lying?</p><p>\u201cHow did you figure it out?\u201d I asked, grinning. I should have felt guilty, but I couldn\u2019t help myself. Just hearing Jett\u2019s name coming out of Sylvie\u2019s mouth and her look\u2014her priceless scorn\u2014made me smile.</p><p>\u201cCome here.\u201d She wrapped her arms around me. \u201cYou silly, silly cow! How could you think just for one minute I wouldn\u2019t notice how deeply and madly you\u2019re in love with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it that obvious?\u201d I whispered.</p><p>Nodding, she laughed. \u201cEven if I was blind, I\u2019d still sense that stupid grin on your face every time you think no one\u2019s looking.\u201d</p><p>I laughed with her because she was right. Jett did that to me even when he wasn\u2019t around.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>She shrugged, not asking what for. There were so many reasons. Like the fact that she kept proving time after time that she was the best friend in the world. We laughed until our eyes shimmered with tears\u2014and still couldn\u2019t stop. It was almost like it used to be when were younger and in my case careless. All the stupid things we did and how we stuck together through every single mistake. The good, the bad, and the outrageous.</p><p>Just like now.</p><p>Chapter 17</p><p>After a quick shower and changing into a clean pair of jeans and a sleeveless shirt, I joined Sylvie in the backyard. We talked for an hour straight, during which I recalled the car chase in minuscule detail. Much to my surprise Sylvie came to terms with Jett being here to help me. She asked questions about Jett\u2019s reports, Alessandro\u2019s past, and even about how I felt about Jett being back in my life. She wanted to make sure I was okay, and that I was happy. When she suggested inviting Jett over for dinner, my jaw almost dropped. I\u2019ll admit her sudden enthusiasm scared me, but it was also important to me that Sylvie accepted Jett and forgave him, not least because I didn\u2019t want to hide anything from her.</p><p>We were lounging by the pool. A soft red tint covered my naked arms and shoulders while Sylvie showed a healthy golden glow that would soon turn into the most gorgeous tan, building a beautiful contrast to her blond hair and stunning blue eyes. Knowing about the estate and the car chase, she didn\u2019t seem as scared as I thought she\u2019d be.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad we talked,\u201d I said. \u201cKeeping secrets from you felt terrible. I\u2019m not good at that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo be honest, I already suspected something was wrong.\u201d Sylvie leaned forward and squeezed my hand gently. \u201cI just didn\u2019t want to push you, because you were in a bad place. I reckoned you\u2019d tell me at some point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d I wished I had done it much earlier.</p><p>She pushed her sunglasses back on her head, a quizzical look on her face. \u201cAre you and Jett back together? Like, officially?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I admitted, \u201cWe haven\u2019t talked about it. We\u2019re dating and he told me his feelings once, so we might be getting serious.\u201d I shrugged as though it didn\u2019t matter. But it did. A lot. I wanted serious. Ever since meeting him it had become one of my favorite words.</p><p>\u201cMight be?\u201d She snorted. \u201cIf a guy talks feelings after you\u2019ve had sex, he wants to be with you. There\u2019s no doubt about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess,\u201d I muttered.</p><p>Something in my tone made her tilt her head. Maybe I didn\u2019t come across as enthusiastic or confident as one would expect.</p><p>\u201cDoes he know how you feel about him?\u201d Sylvie asked.</p><p>Staring at the sparkling blue water, I shook my head.</p><p>\u201cWhy? What\u2019s the problem?\u201d</p><p>I smiled grimly. Sylvie and I were so close and yet opposites. She knew a bit about my past and I about hers, but she denied everything she\u2019d rather keep buried. How could I explain to her my rules about love and relationships without going into detail about what drove me to think that way? To love someone so deeply is to risk losing yourself forever. Once I admitted my feelings to him, there was no going back\u2014no hope to ever make my heart complete without him.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s amazing, but\u2014\u201d I hesitated, my throat constricting at the thought of a future together. \u201cI want to be with him but sometimes when I see him, I feel like I\u2019m standing on a cliff, knowing there is no way to go but down.\u201d</p><p>I bit my lip, pondering how much I could say without giving too much away.</p><p>\u201cRight now I\u2019m happy with how things are. It\u2019s going great. The way I see it Jett doesn\u2019t need to know how I feel.\u201d</p><p>Sylvie smiled and squeezed my hand. \u201cSweetie, love\u2019s meant to be shared. Maybe it won\u2019t last forever. But who cares? Every story has an ending. You can\u2019t stop after one chapter just because you don\u2019t know how it ends. If you love him, you should at least give it a chance. What\u2019s worse than loss?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRegret,\u201d I whispered, thinking back to all the times she had drilled into me just how great of a bitch regret was and why I should take risks rather than live in my safe bubble. \u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that. Do you?\u201d Her brows shot up.</p><p>I did. And yet the demons inside my head kept roaring. They were the ones who kept telling me it wouldn\u2019t end well. It hadn\u2019t for my parents. Nor Jett\u2019s parents. Nor Sylvie\u2019s. Why would I encounter a different fate?</p><p>\u201cThink about it,\u201d Sylvie said gently.</p><p>Nodding, I fought back the moisture gathering in the corners of my eyes and decided to change the topic. \u201cHas Clarkson called?\u201d</p><p>Sylvie shook her head and squeezed into her clothes\u2014cropped jeans and an oversized tee that fell off her shoulder. \u201cNo, but a letter arrived this morning. I left it on the kitchen table. It\u2019s the financial reports you requested. Wanna have a look at them now?\u201d</p><p>I wanted to ask how she knew what the letter contained, but decided against it. \u201cSure. I\u2019ve turned into a lobster anyway.\u201d</p><p>As we returned to the house I noticed the dark clouds gathering in the distance. The soft breeze from before turned into a strong gust blowing up the leaves, and the air carried the scent of oncoming rain. It was hard to believe that just a few hours ago the air had been so hot it had reminded me of a desert.</p><p>We entered through the backdoor and I locked it behind us. I scanned the kitchen area. It looked spotless, like Sylvie didn\u2019t use it, which was strange because she usually ordered portions that could feed a family of four\u2014and didn\u2019t gain a pound. Maybe she had been too worried to eat. The thought ignited my guilt again. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDid anything happen last night?\u201d I asked. \u201cAny strange phone calls?\u201d</p><p>She shot me an inquisitive look. \u201cNo, it was pretty quiet here.\u201d</p><p>I had never been so happy to hear she had a quiet night in. It almost made the car chase seem surreal.</p><p>\u201cDid you really call the police?\u201d I asked, grinning.</p> <p>\u201cYeah. They told me I had to wait forty-eight hours before I could fill in a missing person\u2019s report. That pissed me off big time, but other than that\u2014\u201d Sylvie shook her head. \u201cNothing happened.\u201d She blinked a few times, irritated.</p><p>I placed a sloppy kiss on her soft cheek. Ever since we moved to New York City, Sylvie and I had a code that if one of us didn\u2019t get in touch before ten a.m. the next morning, that would be a red call that something happened. Even though she received the text and shouldn\u2019t have worried, I appreciated her concern.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry. I promise I won\u2019t do that to you again,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d better not, Brooke, because you scared the crap out of me.\u201d The tremble in her voice didn\u2019t go unnoticed. \u201cThose are the papers. Looks like there\u2019s a lot to go through.\u201d She pointed to the large yellow folder and headed for the coffee machine.</p><p>I watched her fill the filter and add water, then opened the folder and was instantly overwhelmed by the countless sheets covered by numbers and yet more numbers. Even though I knew my way around basic accountancy, I had never glimpsed into the accounts of an estate as big as this one. As far as my amateur eye could see though, the numbers looked legit and the taxes paid.</p> <p>\u201cThey look okay to me.\u201d I closed the folder again.</p><p>Sylvie placed a cup of hot coffee in front of me and sat down. \u201cCan I see them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d Given that she had a degree in business to show off and had worked in an accountancy firm until recently, I was more than happy to oblige. I handed her the folder and took a sip of my coffee, almost burning my tongue in the process.</p><p>Sylvie began flicking through the papers.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d I asked her, inching closer. Two minutes passed and she didn\u2019t reply. The silence was making me nervous, so I bumped her leg under the table.</p><p>\u201cSylvie?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSorry?\u201d She frowned but didn\u2019t look up. \u201cDid you say something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs something wrong?\u201d</p><p>I laughed to compensate for the worry in my voice.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no debt.\u201d She looked up, her baby blue eyes searching mine.</p><p>\u201cSo that\u2019s a good thing then, right?\u201d</p><p>Her grimace didn\u2019t quite manage to erase my unease. Maybe it was the way she clutched at the papers. Or maybe it was the way her eyes kept darting across one particular page, as though her findings rattled her. But something told me things weren\u2019t as clear as they had seemed to me.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something wrong, isn\u2019t it?\u201d I asked.</p><p>She held up a hand, her face scrunched up in concentration as she pulled three papers in front of her, discarding the rest, and started to compare them. I didn\u2019t like the look on her face. My heart began to beat fast.</p> <p>I walked around the table and leaned over her shoulder, trying to see what she saw. Finally, Sylvie flicked open her phone and began to punch numbers in her calculator.</p><p>\u201cThe numbers don\u2019t add up,\u201d she mumbled as her fingers pointed around the sheets to show me. \u201cLooks like a loophole in earnings and write-offs. I\u2019m wondering where the money\u2019s going.\u201d</p><p>Turning, she gazed up at me, her eyes reflecting my own mistrust.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Brooke. I\u2019ve no idea,\u201d she said, handing the papers back to me. \u201cThose look like charities, but who knows. You need to talk with Jett and find someone who knows more about Italian accountancy practices. One thing\u2019s for sure, the transactions were made at regular intervals. The last one took place last January.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d I blinked in succession. \u201cPeople donate to charities all the time.\u201d</p><p>Sylvie shook her head. \u201cLook at all those zeroes. We\u2019re talking millions and he wrote them all off. You said Jett owns a property here, meaning he more than likely has an Italian accountant to sort out his taxes.\u201d</p><p>I knew I had reached a point where I needed help. Jett was the obvious answer.</p><p>She stopped in front of the kitchen door, her hand on the doorknob, her eyes not looking at me. \u201cThere\u2019s something else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I cocked my head, regarding her intently. Whenever she tried to make something important sound casual, she started with the words \u2018also there\u2019s something else\u2019, which instantly made the alarm bells go off at the back of my mind.</p><p>\u201cYou said Alessandro didn\u2019t want you to make any alterations to the house, right?\u201d</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ve been wondering why there are cement bags downstairs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDownstairs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, in the basement. While waiting for you worried sick, I might add\u2014\u201d she paused for effect \u201c\u2014I checked all the rooms in the house and stumbled upon the bags in the basement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you saw bags of cement and not\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDust? Stones?\u201d She rolled her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m not stupid, Brooke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never said that. It\u2019s just weird.\u201d Alessandro had been so adamant that nothing changed about the house. I had to see it and then ask him about it. \u201cShow me,\u201d I said to Sylvie. Not waiting for her answer, I walked past her, only stopping in the hall, so she could take the lead.</p><p>She guided me down the stairs and through a door into a narrow corridor that seemed to stretch on forever. The air smelled stale and dusty. The spare naked light bulbs above our heads cast moving shadows across the whitewashed walls. My shoes barely made any sound on the concrete floor, as I hurried to keep up with Sylvie\u2019s brisk pace.</p><p>\u201cYou came down here all alone?\u201d I asked, almost sceptical. Who would have thought my best friend\u2014a closet claustrophobic\u2014would enter an underground place that resembled an oversized casket with no windows and no escape exit?</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t exactly have a choice. I thought you might be trapped in the basement,\u201d Sylvie muttered. \u201cYou\u2019d be surprised what else I\u2019d do for you.\u201d</p><p>I smiled at the various memories of her shying away from elevators and cramped spaces, pretending she couldn\u2019t breathe.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t easy. I thought I was going to have a heart attack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook at you. You\u2019re conquering your fears. I\u2019m so proud of you,\u201d I said, meaning every word of it. She shot me a dirty look over her shoulder and muttered something like \u2018just shut up.\u2019</p><p>We reached a juncture and entered a hall with several doors. I peered into the first room. Apart from old furniture stashed in the corner, it was empty. The second and third cells looked just the same. The fourth cell was the size of a room and completely empty. Stopping in my tracks, I shuddered as unease washed over me.</p><p>\u201cWhere are the cement bags?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cThere.\u201d Sylvie pointed to my left. I turned to follow her line of vision, only then noticing the open archway hidden by darkness. We walked in and Sylvie switched on the light bulb, bathing the fifth room in artificial brightness.</p><p>The small space was stacked with racks and bottles, which led me to believe Sylvie had stumbled upon Alessandro\u2019s wine cellar. Stashed between the wall and a rack were two bags of cement, almost hidden from view, as though someone had forgotten them there.</p><p>\u201cSo what do you think?\u201d Sylvie asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d I crouched down to inspect them closer. \u201cMaybe he needed them for renovations. It\u2019s an old building; it probably needs a lot of that.\u201d</p><p>It sounded plausible and yet her silence suggested she didn\u2019t agree with me. I could see from the frown on her face that she didn\u2019t like my answer. And neither did I.</p><p>\u201cWhen I told you I looked around, I meant I really snooped around and found no signs of any recent renovations. Everything looks just old.\u201d She made a disparaging gesture. \u201cWhy leave the bags in here with the expensive wine? Why not choose the other room where there\u2019s plenty of space? Just look at this thing.\u201d She pulled out a bottle of wine and handed it to me. I checked the stamped date before returning the bottle to the rack. The wine was over fifty years old and probably worth more than I used to make in a month in my old job.</p><p>A faint scent wafted past. I sniffed the air, focusing to catch it.</p><p>\u201cDo you smell it?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s paint.\u201d</p><p>We split up inspecting the walls, brushing our fingers over the irregular dirty white surface.</p><p>\u201cIf he had someone paint them over, whoever he hired did a really bad job,\u201d Sylvie said. \u201cHe should ask for his money back.\u201d</p><p>Sylvie was right. The paint was so irregular and rough, it looked like a child could have done a more decent job.</p><p>\u201cThe smell\u2019s strongest here.\u201d I pointed to a rack and wiped my fingertips over two bottles. \u201cThere\u2019s no dust.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me see,\u201d Sylvie said. I stepped aside, only then noticing the white color staining the dark wood in places.</p><p>\u201cI think someone painted this room, then set up the rack while the paint was still fresh. As for the rack, my best guess is it was moved from somewhere else, which would explain why there\u2019s no dust on the bottles.\u201d</p><p>We returned to the fourth room and inspected the walls. Dark traces of dust and dirt were visible where the wine racks used to stand.</p><p>\u201cBut why would Alessandro move the wine racks into a smaller room after it was painted?\u201d Sylvie whispered behind me. \u201cWhy not just leave them here?\u201d</p><p>Crossing my arms over my chest, I shook my head, signaling I had no idea. \u201cI\u2019ve been asking myself the same question.\u201d I paced up and down the space, my eyes focused on the wall.</p><p>\u201cWhat doesn\u2019t make sense to me is why did he have just one room painted? Why not this one, too? Why not the entire basement?\u201d I turned to look at Sylvie.</p><p>\u201cMaybe there was no need for it. What if he had water leakage and just this one room was damp? He might have feared mold would spread through the walls,\u201d Sylvie suggested.</p><p>\u201cThe air would smell damp. Besides, you don\u2019t eradicate mold by painting it over. You can use an air dehumidifier. Worst case scenario, you rebuild all walls because fungus spreads fast,\u201d I said. \u201cMaybe that\u2019s what he needed the cement bags for.\u201d</p><p>It was possible and yet my words sounded unbelievable. Sylvie\u2019s doubtful look told me she thought the same. Something just didn\u2019t add up. The painted wall looked like an amateur had tried his hand at it. Why not hire a professional? Alessandro surely had enough money. And why do just this one wall?</p><p>My mind was spinning from so many questions and each answer I came up with led to yet another question.</p><p>\u201cYou should invite him over, you know,\u201d Sylvie remarked.</p><p>No need to ask who she was talking about.</p><p>\u201cSeriously?\u201d I asked her. \u201cAre you really okay with it?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>We had this discussion before and I was eager to stand my ground. Having Jett over wasn\u2019t a good idea. First of all, both Sylvie and Jett\u2019s egos were enormous. You simply don\u2019t put two people, who show delusions of grandeur when it comes to their meaning in life, in the same room. And then there was the fact that Jett and Alessandro weren\u2019t exactly friends.</p><p>\u201cAsk him.\u201d Sylvie shrugged.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be good?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou know me.\u201d She shot me a wide smile.</p><p>\u201cNo fighting?\u201d</p><p>She heaved an exaggerated sigh and rolled her eyes slowly. \u201cI\u2019d never do that.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, right!</p><p>Biting my lip, I stared at her innocent face for a few moments. I really wanted to believe her but Sylvie could be a little too overprotective, which turned her into a dragon. But she and Jett were extremely important to me, so wasn\u2019t it about time they got to know each other? Just in case Jett and I were long-term material.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d I said. \u201cMaybe I should ask Jett for his opinion. A male perspective\u2019s always interesting.\u201d</p><p>It was the truth. I wanted to hear his opinion because I trusted his judgment. But that wasn\u2019t the only reason I needed him around. I wanted him by my side because he was the only one who made me feel safe.</p><p>Chapter 18</p><p>The clock was moving closer and closer to seven p.m. With every second, my heart pounded harder and faster against my chest. It had been doing that ever since my chat conversation with Jett.</p><p>Will u have dinner with us @ 7?</p><p>It had been my clue to him that Sylvie was ready to forgive him and that I wanted to see him today. Two minutes later, his text message pinged back.</p> <p>I\u2019ll bring wine.</p><p>For the past hour, my stomach had been fluttering and indulging in major wishful thinking. And not only because of the promise of a hot night. My phone beeped again. Expecting another message, I flicked it open. As I opened the photo attachment, I let out a spat of air, blushing.</p><p>Holy mother of pearls!</p><p>It showed me sleeping half naked on my stomach, my legs peering from under the sheets, where my tiny nightshirt had ridden up, my hair a mess and\u2014earth swallow me up whole\u2014my mouth slightly open. But, worst of all, the shirt I was wearing barely covered my ass. Below the picture he wrote, \u201cWish I would see the look on your face when you see this.\u201d</p><p>I stared at the screen in shock, my hands moving across the keyboard.</p><p>Oh God, u didn\u2019t do that.</p><p>Short silence, then my phone beeped again.</p><p>What?</p> <p>The picture u just sent me!</p><p>I don\u2019t know what you' re talking about?</p><p>Seriously? Now he was pretending he hadn\u2019t sent me the picture.</p><p>I want u to delete it. I look horrendous.</p><p>A brief pause, then came his answer.</p><p>I thought the one showing your boobs was a pretty good shot, so there\u2019s no chance in hell I\u2019m deleting it. If I want to picture myself satisfied, I just have to look at them and rewind the memories I have with you.</p><p>I looked at the picture again. It definitely didn\u2019t show my boobs. How many pictures did he take? I was about to text him again, when another text arrived.</p><p>p.s.: Can\u2019t wait to see you. I\u2019m sick of making out with my pillow and pretend it\u2019s you.</p><p>My heart did a cartwheel. I texted him back, but no more messages arrived. Now dinner couldn\u2019t come fast enough. Sylvie noticed my frazzled state of mind, but didn\u2019t comment on it. As per her instructions, I showered, put on a dress of her choice, and let my hair fall onto my shoulders in cascading waves. I even let her apply my makeup, praying she wouldn\u2019t go too far. She wanted me to look amazing, and I did. Standing in front of the mirror, I regarded my mint colored, off shoulder Grecian drape dress with fine lace embroidery and hand sewn pearls around the waist. Probably designed for an evening party or gala, it hugged my figure in all the right places, and gave my slightly tanned skin a golden hue. Definitely well worth the horrendous price tag Sylvie probably paid for it.</p><p>\u201cWow. I\u2019m so proud of you,\u201d Sylvie gushed.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just the three of us having dinner. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m graduating, or moving to Europe. But thanks for the thumbs-up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know but look at you.\u201d She pointed down my body. \u201cYou\u2019re spreading your wings and learning to fly.\u201d</p><p>I turned around to inspect the dress in the mirror. \u201cWhere did you get it from? I\u2019ve never seen it in your wardrobe and can\u2019t remember you packing it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bought it yesterday,\u201d Sylvie said.</p><p>\u201cSo you went to Milan?\u201d I asked.</p><p>She shook her head, touching the dress. \u201cNo, there wasn\u2019t enough time, because I wanted to be back in time for you. I found this small shop in Bellagio, not far from the pizzeria we went to. Half the stuff wasn\u2019t that bad. And then I saw the dress and I had to get it. I thought it\u2019d be a perfect fit for you.\u201d She shot me a bright smile, which made me eye her carefully. She always talked this much, but there was something in her tone that made me listen up.</p><p>\u201cFor me?\u201d</p><p>Sylvie nodded, and her smile widened just a little bit more.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d I hugged her tight. \u201cBut why would you get me something like this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFeeling bad?\u201d She winked.</p><p>Oh god.</p><p>Call it intuition but I just knew something was fishy.</p><p>I narrowed my eyes on her. \u201cFeeling bad for\u2014\u201d I was cut short by the bell. I checked my watch. It was barely six. Jett was supposed to be here at seven. I turned to Sylvie, confused. \u201cWho\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>Judging from the grin on her face, something was up. \u201cI asked Jett to be here early.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut why?\u201d I looked around my messy room. Clothes and shoes\u2014mostly Sylvie\u2019s\u2014were scattered all over the place. There was makeup, body lotion, and yet more makeup on the bed. No way would I let Jett see all the clatter.</p><p>She motioned me to follow her down the stairs to the front door. \u201cDon\u2019t be mad but I have a date. I reckoned you\u2019d be fine without me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have what?\u201d I almost tripped in my high heels as I tried to keep up with her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve met someone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged, as though it wasn\u2019t important, which was the exact opposite of what she really thought. \u201cThe guy from the bar.\u201d</p><p>No freaking way!</p><p>Why did I believe her when she claimed it was going to be just one drink? From all the people in the world, did she have to go for the local mafia?</p><p>Sylvie\u2019s hand clasped around the doorknob. Before she could open the front door, I grabbed her hand, forcing her to turn around.</p><p>\u201cWhat about Jett and dinner?\u201d My eyes spew fire, matching the angry flames blazing inside me.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about him. He\u2019ll take good care of you. Besides, I asked him to bring dinner, because you can\u2019t cook worth shit. So you\u2019ll be just fine.\u201d</p><p>I rolled my eyes, ignoring her remark. I had no doubt that Jett and I would have a good time. \u201cNo, Sylvie. That\u2019s not really my concern. I don\u2019t like you going out with that guy, and you know it. What happened to \u2018one drink only, I\u2019m not gonna marry him\u2019?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged again in that non-committal way of hers. Cringing, I clamped my mouth shut. My hopes and dreams of Jett and Sylvie spending more time together in order to get to know each other were about to run down the toilet. I wanted the ice broken between the two most important people in my life. That was never going to happen if Sylvie kept finding excuses to stay away from him. I could take care of that later. Right now my issue was her going out with a guy I didn\u2019t know.</p><p>\u201cSylvie, why would you go on a date with someone without telling me?\u201d</p><p>Hypocrite alert.</p><p>Wasn\u2019t that what I had done the last few times? I began to rub my temples in the hope she wouldn\u2019t catch the guilty look on my face.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m telling you now. If I can\u2019t find a decent club in the area, I need a date. Besides, I haven\u2019t had one of those in ages,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll spill everything when I get back.\u201d</p><p>I honestly didn\u2019t want her to go and yet what could I do? I was in no position to make demands. In the end I found myself whispering, \u201cPlease be careful.\u201d</p><p>Sylvie leaned in whispering back, \u201cWhen you find someone special, he\u2019s probably worth hanging on to. Don\u2019t stop trying to make it work. In fact, today\u2019s a good day to tell him how you feel about him. You take a risk, okay?\u201d</p><p>Where the heck did the sudden Dr. Phil life coaching session come from? I stared at her, open-mouthed. Her lips touched my cheek gently and she patted my arm. That\u2019s when everything dawned on me.</p><p>There was no sense in trying to convince Sylvie to stay. I knew a lost cause when I saw one. Yes, we had been in Italy for a few days now. But as much as she wanted to fool me into thinking she was missing guys and parties, I sensed the real reason why she couldn\u2019t wait to leave me and Jett alone was to give us a chance to get back together.</p><p>\u201cPromise me you\u2019ll text me where you are,\u201d I said.</p><p>With a sigh, Sylvie nodded and opened the door. My breath caught in my throat when I saw Jett in front of us. He was dressed in a black leather jacket, a sexy white tee, and even sexier jeans, holding a large box of what I supposed contained dinner. I grabbed it out of his hands and placed it on the side table in the foyer.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d A smug grin lit up his eyes.</p><p>How could he make one word sound so deliciously sensual? For a brainless moment, I imagined kissing his butter-melting lips and wrapping my legs around his majestic body, dissolving into him, the way I did earlier today in the hotel room. Or yesterday in the Jacuzzi. Or the time before that, on the boat.</p><p>\u201cHi. I\u2019m glad you could come.\u201d Sylvie stepped out to greet him, throwing her arms around him, as though they were best buddies. In the silence of the evening, she whispered loud enough for me to hear. \u201cTake good care of her. If you hurt her, I promise I\u2019ll cut off your balls and feed them to the ducks on the lake.\u201d</p><p>Jett glanced at me with an amused grin.</p><p>\u201cYou were probably drunk because I\u2019ve never seen ducks swimming in that lake. But if I ever hurt her, I\u2019ll buy them for you so you can serve my balls on a silver tray. No worries, I\u2019ll keep her safe.\u201d He smiled, his gaze never leaving mine. \u201cI\u2019m not going to waste a second not giving her a good time.\u201d</p><p>Holy mother of double meanings!</p><p>His eyes twinkled with mischief, sending my memory retrieval system into overload.</p><p>My knees almost melted beneath me at the countless memories of us together, our limbs intertwined.</p><p>Thank god Sylvie caught none of that.</p><p>\u201cYou better take this seriously, Mayfield.\u201d She walked past him and turned around, calling over her shoulder, \u201cHave fun, guys.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 19</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s quite something,\u201d Jett said, as we watched Sylvie disappear around the corner.</p><p>I snorted. \u201cCan you blame her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really.\u201d He laughed. \u201cSince I sensed a serious threat, I\u2019d better start treating you well. As of now.\u201d He kissed my cheek, then picked me up in his arms and slammed the door shut with his foot, not putting me down. \u201cWhere\u2019s the kitchen?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat way.\u201d I pointed down the corridor and squealed as he took off, still carrying me over his shoulder. I could feel his hands burning my back, especially my ass, and they were beginning to roam again. I didn\u2019t mind but I wanted food first.</p><p>We reached the kitchen and Jett put me down. And then he left again and came back with the cardboard box. I peered over his shoulder as he unpacked its contents. Instead of ordered restaurant dinner, it looked as if Jett had every intention to cook for me. Again.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it in the least weird that you\u2019re always the one who brings dinner or lunch?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cYou forgot to add breakfast.\u201d A smug smile spread across his beautiful face as he shrugged out of his leather jacket and tossed it over the back of a chair, revealing the most amazing rows of pecks and biceps I had ever seen\u2014all partly hidden under a highly annoying snug white tee. My mouth turned dry at his sight. \u201cThe way I see it there\u2019s nothing wrong with that. If I cook dinner, you\u2019re happy, and I get what I want,\u201d he said, grinning.</p> <p>I punched his shoulder playfully, not offended but just to use any excuse to touch him. \u201cIf I cook next time, will you do what I want?\u201d</p><p>Stopping in his tracks, he cocked his head to the side as though to consider my proposal. \u201cMaybe. That depends. Can you cook?\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t and he knew it.</p><p>\u201cDoes ordering count?\u201d</p><p>He raised an amused eyebrow. \u201cFor all of five minutes. It certainly doesn\u2019t earn you the same privileges like a full three-course meal.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou never let me be in control.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because you love me to be in control.\u201d He inched closer and I took a few steps back until my back hit the wall.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true.\u201d</p><p>It was. I just didn\u2019t want to admit it.</p><p>His mouth came so close I could smell the faint scent of mint and that intoxicating fragrance of his that always made my knees buckle beneath me.</p><p>\u201cAre you up for a bet, Brooke? Let\u2019s say a game of Spades? If you win, you get to do whatever you want to do to me. If I win, I can choose what I want. I have whatever dessert I want.\u201d</p> <p>Jett stretched out his hand. I shook it with a smug smile on my face. I was the best Spades player I knew. I had never lost against anyone. The guy was in for a big kick in his ego.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re on,\u201d I said. \u201cGet ready to lose, sucker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think?\u201d He propped his strong arms against the wall on both sides of my neck, caging me in. His mouth descended to trail down my neck and shoulder, his teeth removing the tiny shoulder strap.</p><p>\u201cI like a good challenge. A test. But I don\u2019t want you to lose, baby,\u201d he whispered, his hands moving around my ass to lift me up. Wrapping my legs around his waist, I let him carry me across the kitchen and set me down on the edge of the kitchen counter. \u201cWhat if I cook and you just stir?\u201d Jett continued huskily. \u201cYou can\u2019t really do much wrong and we both get to have what we want today.\u201d</p><p>His fingers fuddled with my dress until I felt his talented hand between my legs, testing my panties and self-control.</p><p>\u201cSounds like someone\u2019s a big scared pussy.\u201d I moaned as his hand began to rub ever so gently, sending a first jolt of heat through my core. My legs tightened around his waist and I pulled him closer. His thighs were wedged between my legs now, his hand replaced by the bulge in his jeans. He moved in slow motion\u2014up and down\u2014imitating the slow rhythm of our lovemaking until the coarse material of his jeans began to chafe my clit through my panties. My head shot back and another moan escaped my lips, silently demanding more.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just concerned for you. That\u2019s all.\u201d His lips curled into a stunning smile, making me yearn to do all the unspeakable things I always wanted to do to him.</p><p>\u201cA bet is a bet. You can\u2019t back out of it now, just because you\u2019re scared.\u201d My hands trailed down his rock hard abdomen to his jeans, ready to unzip him and give him a good ride of pleasure.</p> <p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d He stopped my hands, his breathing coming hard. \u201cYou haven\u2019t won yet.\u201d</p><p>I laughed. \u201cAre you serious? Am I supposed to wait, even though you know I\u2019ll win? What happened to keeping me happy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s plenty of time for that later.\u201d He kissed me quickly and helped me off the counter. \u201cHow was your day? What did you find out?\u201d</p><p>And just like that, in the blink of an eye, our moment was gone, and Jett\u2019s expression was back to its usual casual self. The guy didn\u2019t just have an inflated ego, he had also the self control of a statue.</p><p>Damn it!</p><p>\u201cHow do you know I found out something?\u201d I smoothed my dress, fighting the urge to smirk at him.</p><p>\u201cFrom Sylvie.\u201d He moistened his lips and regarded me amused, probably inwardly laughing his head off at the disheveled state of me. \u201cShe said you had things to discuss with me alone and that I should bring dinner. Knowing you two, it wasn\u2019t hard to guess you must have discovered something.\u201d</p><p>He was right, as usual, but I couldn\u2019t tell him Sylvie only left us alone so I could talk to him about my feelings.</p><p>I moved past Jett, doing my best not to touch him, and handed him the folder containing the financial reports.</p><p>\u201cClarkson dropped of the estate\u2019s financial reports. Sylvie\u2019s adamant, there\u2019s too much money coming in and going out at regular intervals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you want to know what that\u2019s all about,\u201d he said matter-of-factly, making no move to open the envelope. I wondered if he had seen the reports yet. \u201cI could show them to my accountant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019d be great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy pleasure.\u201d</p><p>I bit my lip, unsure how to steer the conversation to the wine cellar. There was a chance I was blowing it out of proportions and I didn\u2019t want him to think I liked melodrama.</p><p>\u201cThe basement was recently re-painted which strikes me as odd because when I met with Alessandro a few days ago, he insisted that I make no alterations to the house.\u201d Peering up, I met his questioning gaze. \u201cIt\u2019s probably not a big deal but I\u2019d like you to have a look.\u201d</p><p>Clad in only a thin half-length dress, the air felt so cold my skin turned into goose bumps. I suppressed a shiver and wrapped my arms around myself to keep warm. I expected Jett to laugh off my implausible explanations. I even expected irritation, just not\u2014silence. Jett remained quiet for at least ten minutes, his face an expressionless mask as he followed me down to the basement and then listened to me recalling my conversation with Sylvie. I watched him moving from one cell to the next, smoothing his hand over the walls, tapping, and moving bits and parts of the heavy rack around, absorbed in his thoughts, which he didn\u2019t seem to want to share with me just yet. In the background, I thought I could hear the tapping sound of raindrops falling. The usually soothing sound made me nervous, maybe because the place gave me the creeps and my nerves were on edge. For the first time I realized I couldn\u2019t be comfortable living in this big old house all by myself.</p><p>Standing next to Jett, the seconds became minutes and I felt silly dragging him down here for no reason at all. My suspicion had been roused by nothing but my absurd need to see hidden motives where there might be none.</p><p>\u201cMaybe we should head back upstairs. It\u2019s probably not a big deal anyway,\u201d I said. \u201cAlessandro probably wanted to paint all the rooms but his health deteriorated and he never got the chance.\u201d</p><p>I came to the conclusion that had to be it. The most likely reason was also the simplest one.</p><p>\u201cPossibly,\u201d Jett replied, his voice giving away no clue with regards to what he really thought. He caught me crossing my arms over my chest and shrugged out of his jacket, then wrapped it around me.</p><p>\u201cPut it on.\u201d His tone left no room for discussion.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not that cold, but thanks,\u201d I lied yet made no move to remove his jacket because I loved his smell. It was warm and hugged me like a cocoon. Inhaling his scent, I stared at Jett\u2019s bulging biceps as he strained to push the rest of the wine rack aside. His muscles flexed beneath the tan skin, and he let out a low groan as the rack moved an inch with a loud grating noise.</p><p>\u201cDo you need any help?\u201d I asked, half amused, half aroused. My tongue flicked over my lips as I watched his strong arms, his broad shoulders, and the thin layer of sweat covering his forehead. With his snug shirt and mouth-watering torso, he looked so darn sexy and enticing my body began to clamor for him.</p><p>\u201cNo. Just wait there,\u201d Jett said.</p><p>Basically, he was sending out an open invitation for me to stare some more.</p><p>The rack moved another inch, then a couple more. Jett\u2019s face contorted from exertion, as he pushed it to the middle of the tiny room, almost blocking the door.</p><p>\u201cThe proportions of this room aren\u2019t right,\u201d Jett said.</p><p>\u201cUh-huh. It\u2019s quite small.\u201d I nodded, not getting what he was on about. It was probably a men thing. Like cars and sports. You play along, pretend you know what they\u2019re talking about, when in reality you can\u2019t stop thinking about how hot they are.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s an old house. They probably didn\u2019t have a good architect back then.\u201d I watched him brush his hands over his thighs to dust off his jeans and instantly wished he\u2019d let me do it.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant, Brooke,\u201d he said, turning to regard me. His eyes lingered on me a bit too long, penetrating my mind and body. I instantly felt flustered, both from the fire I saw in his eyes and the fact that I knew he sensed just how much he turned me on. \u201cI think the room was cut in half.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean there\u2019s another part somewhere?\u201d It wasn\u2019t my brightest statement but his words made no sense.</p><p>\u201cListen.\u201d He knocked on the walls to his right and left. The noises sounded different\u2014one hollow, the other muted. \u201cIt was divided. The rest is on the other side.\u201d He pointed to his right.</p><p>I stared at him in silence for a moment, and that\u2019s when it dawned on me.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d Jett said.</p><p>My fingers touched the grainy surface and I knocked, listening to the hollow sound. My insides began to twist, my instincts warning me. It was as if only inches separated me from something so terrible it made me sick.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s only one way to find out for sure, you know?\u201d Jett\u2019s eyes fixed on me. \u201cWe\u2019d have to smash in the wall. We could keep the damage small, so it can be easily repaired and no one will notice.\u201d</p><p>Opening Pandora\u2019s box.</p><p>I swallowed the sudden lump in my throat.</p><p>\u201cAlessandro\u2019s been pretty clear in his wishes,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the heiress. You have a right to know what\u2019s behind that wall.\u201d Jett\u2019s voice was determined, rough, almost cold. And as usual, he had a point. \u201dOnce you inherit this estate, you automatically inherit its demons. You need to know what you\u2019re dealing with.\u201d</p><p>A shiver ran down my spine. A voice inside my head urged me to run away as fast as possible and yet my legs didn\u2019t move. I wanted to know and yet I didn\u2019t. I could just honor Alessandro\u2019s wish and pretend for the rest of my life that this wall didn\u2019t exist. But could I live like that? In fear. Not knowing what lay hidden beyond. Always wondering. Obsessing. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jett inched closer and grabbed my shoulders, forcing me to meet his gaze.</p><p>\u201cBrooke, I told you already Alessandro secrets are dangerous. I know you don\u2019t believe me, but I made a promise to protect you.\u201d His eyes were dark, glistening, demanding something from me that was difficult to give.</p><p>My heart hammered against my chest as I was torn between two options. Do it, or don\u2019t do it.</p><p>But did I really have a choice?</p> <p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I said before I could change my mind. \u201cLet\u2019s do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be careful. First thing tomorrow I\u2019ll have a professional fix it and no one will know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d I nodded, trusting him completely.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to wait upstairs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I shook my head. \u201cI want to stay and help. Where do we start?\u201d</p> <p>Jett smiled. His thumb gently grazed my cheek. \u201cLet\u2019s find a screwdriver, a hammer, anything that can puncture a wall. If we can\u2019t find any tools, we\u2019ll drive back to my house to get some.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan we change first? I\u2019d rather not ruin Sylvie\u2019s dress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d He kissed the tip of my nose and then we headed upstairs so I could slip into my old clothes. But more than that, I was eager to bide for time. If only for a few minutes, or as long as it\u2019d take me to calm my shaking fingers and racing heart.</p><p>Chapter 20</p><p>It was shortly after eight p.m. when we broke through the wall. I had changed into jeans, a long sleeved shirt and dark blue trainers, and Jett had slipped back into his jacket. Whoever had put up the wall was in a hurry and went for drywall instead of bricks and mortar. Jett drilled a tiny hole and expanded it to several inches so he could peer inside. Although we didn\u2019t find a torch, there were enough candles in the house. We lit one and holding it up, Jett pushed his arm through the small opening. I stayed a few steps back, not daring to look inside, painfully aware that no one would ever hide something if it wasn\u2019t terrible.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, baby. Don\u2019t be scared,\u201d Jett whispered, his calm tone making the shivers running down my spine even worse.</p> <p>Why the hell did he have to whisper? There was no one in the house and the sound of his voice echoing from the walls was creepy, creating ice-cold knots inside my stomach.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a desk,\u201d Jett said. Did I detect a hint of disappointment?</p><p>\u201cA desk?\u201d I asked, trying to look over his shoulder. Why would anyone build a wall to hide a desk? \u201cLet me see.\u201d</p><p>The candle cast enough light to make out a small mahogany desk. No other furniture.</p><p>\u201cTake down the drywall,\u201d I said. According to Jett we had no problems making a tiny opening because the wall barely measured an inch in width. I had seen it done before on TV and reckoned if someone could do it, then Jett.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure about that? Gypsum is easily broken and makes a huge mess.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cJust do it. We\u2019ll worry about it later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHold this.\u201d Jett pushed the burning candle into my hand and then kicked once right next to the small hole. And again until the wall gave in and a chunk of it crumbled to our feet in a heap of debris and dust. It wasn\u2019t large but big enough for someone petite to squeeze through but definitely not meant for Jett\u2019s size. His shoulders would barely fit through.</p> <p>\u201cLet me try,\u201d I said. Of course I didn\u2019t want to go in there alone. But I was tired, and frankly, I didn\u2019t care. I just wanted to get it over and done with. And maybe a tiny part of me was eager to impress Jett\u2014after all he did the hard work.</p><p>\u201cStay here,\u201d Jett said. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to do this if you\u2019re uncomfortable.\u201d</p><p>I hated it when people saw me as fragile. My life had never been cushioned and I wasn\u2019t going to let his overprotectiveness change that now.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m handling this on my own,\u201d I said, ready to argue if need be. Jett regarded me calmly but didn\u2019t argue. Hysteria bubbled up somewhere at the back of my throat. I swallowed hard to get rid of it and walked past him. Holding the candle up to illuminate the way, I squeezed through the opening. My heart hammered so loud I was sure Jett could hear it.</p><p>The room was dark and the air stale, swallowing up the artificial light falling in through the hole. The candle cast a faint and ghostly glow on the concrete floor, but it wasn\u2019t enough to reach the dark corners. My heart hammered harder as my mind began to conjure up images of someone hiding in the corner, ready to jump out and kill me. It wasn\u2019t just dark, it was dusty and creepy. I couldn\u2019t wait to get the hell out of here but not before I brought to fruition what I came to do.</p><p>Jett was right. The room had been divided, though not in half. This part was almost as large as a living room. The desk was set up close to the wall. There was no chair, no other furniture.</p><p>\u201cBrooke, do you see anything?\u201d Jett peered inside.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d I croaked. My mouth was so dry I cleared my throat in the hope to get rid of the fear choking me.</p><p>The candlelight fell on a light switch on the wall to my right. I switched it on and an overhead neon light bulb flickered a few times. Bathed in glaring brightness, the room looked like any other. I breathed a sigh of relief and pressed a hand against my chest to calm my racing heart. But it was hard because the walls creeped me out. With no doors and no escape route, I felt as though I was trapped in a psychiatric ward.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Jett called. He sounded impatient and desperate to jump into the middle of the action. He was definitely not the kind to watch from a distance. Struggling, he squeezed through the hole. I motioned him to come in. He reached me in a few long strides, grinning.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so stubborn,\u201d I said. \u201cLet\u2019s hope we can get you back outside unscathed.\u201d</p><p>He rubbed his sore shoulder. \u201cNot a good idea, I agree, but I feel useless standing around and watching you do all the work.\u201d</p><p>We inspected the desk together. It was an old thing with Chinese Chippendale style engravings and a galleried top, brass handles, and two small stationary cupboards left and right. Apart from a few ridges running across the otherwise smooth surface, the desk looked in pristine condition and was probably worth showing to an antique dealer. I ran my fingers over the horizontal panel sides and drawer linings.</p><p>\u201cIt must have been his desk,\u201d Jett said.</p><p>\u201cAnd now it\u2019s left to perish away in the basement?\u201d I asked, watching Jett test the bottom drawer. It was locked. The second one opened with a slight scraping sound, revealing pens, a stamp pad and a bottle of ink. The third drawer contained loose sheets of paper. Jett laid them on the desk and began skimming through them.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d I held up what looked like business correspondence in Italian.</p><p>\u201cProbably nothing important, but we\u2019ll have them translated nonetheless,\u201d Jett said. \u201cThe bottom drawer\u2019s the only one locked and I doubt we\u2019ll find the key.\u201d</p><p>He motioned for me to step back. I followed his request and almost jumped in my skin as he turned the desk upside down so he could reach underneath. It crashed against the floor with a loud thump, the noise echoing from the walls.</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d He flashed me an apologetic smile. I regarded him open-mouthed. I was never one for violence, not even against antiques.</p><p>\u201cI hope you\u2019re not thinking about keeping it.\u201d He pointed at the desk, grinning.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a fan of clutter,\u201d I said, watching him kick the lower drawer at its weakest spot until it broke.</p><p>I held my breath as he retrieved what looked like a black leather bound book the size of my smartphone and began to flick through the pages.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s in it?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. But Lucazzone\u2019s probably hiding it for a reason.\u201d He pushed the book inside his pocket, avoiding my gaze. But I caught the angry line between his brows. \u201cWe\u2019re done here. Let\u2019s finish up.\u201d</p><p>Finishing up was easier said than done. How was I supposed to relax with the knowledge that Alessandro had walled in his office and we had no idea why? Whatever reason he had, it didn\u2019t make sense to me. If he had a secret, why not just sell the desk, bury or burn the papers\u2014or whatever he wanted hidden from the world. The most obvious explanation to me was that he wanted to hang on to it as evidence.</p><p>\u201cI have to make a call,\u201d Jett said as I headed for the bathroom, ready to wash off the dirt. The warm water relaxed my sore muscles, but it didn\u2019t help wash off the discovery and the scary new feelings that came with it.</p><p>As I returned to the guestroom, my body wrapped in a white bathrobe, Jett was sitting on my bed, his fingers playing with his phone.</p><p>\u201cAny news?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cNobody\u2019s home. I\u2019ll have to try again tomorrow.\u201d He sounded angry. Frustrated. His gaze was still averted, avoiding me. Something was troubling him.</p><p>Ever since we returned from the basement, he had been distant. Aloft. Cutting me out from his train of thoughts.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d I ran my fingers through his hair, massaging gently.</p><p>His hands moved to his pocket and he fished out the black book, then pushed it into my hands.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m taking a shower.\u201d No invitation to join him. I sighed and slumped down on the bed. Maybe he was just tired and taking a shower was his way of dealing with whatever burdened him, and I accepted that.</p><p>I waited until he was gone before opening the black book to page one. There were five names. Names I didn\u2019t know. Except for one.</p><p>I stared at it, paralyzed, the name echoing inside my brain.</p><p>Robert Mayfield.</p><p>What the heck?</p><p>No wonder Jett was upset. His father had confessed to being a part of Alessandro\u2019s elite club. But maybe Jett had hoped Robert might not be that involved?</p><p>I stared at the names for a while, wondering why there were so few of them. I always figured a club involved more than half a dozen people.</p><p>\u201cJett, can I come in?\u201d I knocked on the bathroom door and opened it without waiting for his answer, then peeked inside. He was standing in front of the mirror, wearing nothing but his jeans. His dirty t-shirt lay crumpled on the floor, as though he had kicked it into a messy heap.</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d I shot him a hesitant smile, my gaze begging him to invite me in\u2014both physically and emotionally. He turned around and opened the door wider to let me walk past. Taking a deep steadying breath, I decided to be frank about my thoughts.</p><p>\u201cYou already knew your father was involved. What difference does it make if his name is in there?\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cYou\u2019re right, I guess. I was just hoping I wouldn\u2019t find anything to back up his claims.\u201d He grimaced and ran his hand through his wet hair, hesitating at the nape of his neck. \u201cMy opinion of him has never been a good one but I always tried my best to remain non-judgmental because he\u2019s my father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d I inched closer and placed a soft kiss on his shoulder because it was the highest point I could reach without high-heels.</p><p>\u201cHe fucked up so many times in his life, I\u2019m not surprised about anything. I\u2019m just\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDisappointed?\u201d</p><p>Jett nodded. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo one\u2019s perfect,\u201d I whispered, even though I knew Jett was very close to it, which was probably the result of him despising his father\u2019s ways.</p><p>\u201cIf those are the club members\u2019 names, what are the numbers on the back?\u201d I held out the open book and pointed at the long strings of digits covering several pages.</p><p>\u201cCould be anything. I\u2019ll try to find out tomorrow.\u201d He walked past me into the bedroom. I followed behind.</p><p>\u201cHow do you think you\u2019ll find out?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI have a friend who knows his way around computers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think whoever chased us knew this book existed and they were afraid we\u2019d make it public?\u201d I asked. I was drawing at straws but I couldn\u2019t help myself. \u201cIf we hand it to them, then maybe we won\u2019t have to worry about our safety and we can keep the estate.\u201d I regarded Jett intently, waiting for him to admit I had just discovered the solution to our problems.</p><p>Sort of.</p><p>\u201cBaby, you think too much. There\u2019s no point in stipulating possible theories with absolutely nothing to back them off.\u201d His voice didn\u2019t leave much room for discussion. \u201cI don\u2019t think your way is the way they\u2019re working. They\u2019re not as\u2014\u201d he smiled, struggling to find the right word \u201c\u2014peaceful.\u201d</p><p>That made sense. He used to be in a gang, so he might know a thing or two about how things worked. I figured gangs weren\u2019t really that different from elite clubs and sects. They\u2019re all made of a closed circle. No one\u2019s let in easily, and definitely not out with a mere handshake.</p> <p>As if sensing my thoughts, Jett shot me an amused look. \u201cLet\u2019s have dinner. I don\u2019t want you to lose an inch from those stunning hips.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 21</p><p>Following Jett into the kitchen, I felt a hint of disappointment that he was bottling up again. I wanted to talk about our findings and possible theories, but he was more than eager to make us dinner. I leaned against the kitchen counter and watched him unpack the contents of his box, looking as hot as ever\u2014clad in nothing but his jeans. His feet were bare and the muscles of his back seemed to flex with every move. I ignored my brain\u2019s silent invitation to run my fingertips down his spine and watch him shiver with pleasure, his beautiful tan skin turning into goose bumps under my touch.</p><p>\u201cWanna help me?\u201d Jett asked. I realized the amused glint had not disappeared from his eyes.</p><p>Me and cooking?</p><p>I laughed. \u201cYeah, if you don\u2019t mind going to bed hungry. You know I can\u2019t cook.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re doing it together.\u201d He retrieved a chopping board and placed it in front of him. \u201cWe\u2019ll start off with something quick and easy. I thought we could make Spaghetti Bolognese.\u201d</p><p>Given that we were in Italy, how fitting.</p><p>I wanted to point out that no Italian recipe was \u2018quick and easy\u2019 to me unless it came out of the microwave oven, and judging from all the things he brought, he had every intention to start from scratch. At least he wasn\u2019t expecting we make our own pasta. I grabbed the unopened pack of spaghetti noodles and turned it around to read the instructions.</p><p>\u201cYou watch the beef while I cut the onions. Deal?\u201d Jett offered. He grabbed a knife from the knife rack and began to peel off an onion.</p><p>\u201cDeal.\u201d</p><p>I had always been rather slow at chopping anything and I\u2019d rather not have my eyes watering and my mascara running, so I placed the minced beef into a frying pan, added a few drops of oil and turned on the heat\u2014the way I had seen it on TV. It was my first attempt at cooking something as complicated as meat. I had watched my fair share of cooking shows. They always made cooking look easy and I blamed them for my fear. But, really, how hard could it be?</p><p>Half a minute later, the minced beef began to sizzle unnaturally loud and the first trickles of sweat rolled down my spine, which I could attribute to anything from my fear of cooking, the heat of the stove, or Jett\u2019s presence. From the corner of my eyes, I admired his abs, so strong and well defined, and the tattoo covering his arm. I knew I had to stop staring before he noticed, but I couldn\u2019t help myself. He looked so sexy, peeling the tomatoes and grating carrots and chopping up herbs, my mind kept conjuring naughty ideas of me stripping him off his jeans and having sex while our dinner boiled to perfection.</p><p>Jett shot me an amused look, sending a wave of heat through my cheeks and lower abdomen. \u201cSomething smells burned.\u201d</p> <p>I blinked my brain back into action.</p><p>Oh, crap!</p><p>I forgot about the meat.</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d My skin prickled from the way his eyes seemed to caress me from a distance. I flipped the meat over and breathed out relieved. It had turned a dark brown color but it was definitely not burned.</p><p>Jett moved behind me, his hands brushing mine as he helped me stir, then added the onions. His hot breath tickled my back, making me all too aware just how close he stood.</p><p>\u201cWant me to remove the pan from the stove?\u201d I asked, unable to control the hoarse undertone of my voice.</p><p>\u201cNo, the beef\u2019s not done for another few minutes.\u201d</p><p>It looked pretty done to me.</p><p>\u201cYou never told me where you learned to cook,\u201d I said.</p><p>I felt him stiffen behind me, hesitating. \u201cAfter my father kicked me out and he cut off my allowance, I took a job in a restaurant kitchen. I was either that or get involved in the drugs crap everyone seemed to fall into.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou worked in a kitchen at sixteen? Is that even allowed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI looked older and lied about my age. I needed the money.\u201d He spun me around until his eyes met mine. \u201cMy family was rich, Brooke, but everything I own I earned myself through hard work and loving what I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t get over the fact that your father threw you out. If you hadn\u2019t been the strong person you are, staying off drugs, we might not be having this conversation. How could you forgive him and help him after all he\u2019s done to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d be lying if I told you I\u2019ve forgiven him.\u201d He shrugged, as if it didn\u2019t matter. But it did. I could see it in the hurt glint in his eyes and the hard lines around his mouth. \u201cI hated him for a long time, but he\u2019s still my father, Brooke. If it wasn\u2019t for the shitty stuff he did to me, I wouldn\u2019t be who I am now. The trials of our lives make us strong, determined to succeed, to be different, both in body and spirit.\u201d</p><p>He took the spoon from my hand and stirred one more time, then added the peeled tomatoes, chopped carrots, and grated cheese to the mix.</p><p>The air was charged with tension. I could feel his struggle to remain calm in the midst of the hurricane raging inside him, and I asked myself how much stronger that hurricane must have been when he was younger. A part of me wondered how many people knew the story of his life and upbringing\u2014his true side, not the one he showed to his prospective business partners and the journalists writing about him in their stories.</p><p>He was beginning to trust me. Another first. Another step that proved to me he was serious about us. Affection\u2019s easy to gain, but trust is hard to get and yet so easy to crush and lose.</p><p>Jett took a deep breath, his eyes turning cold again. \u201cYou can forget what people said and did, but you never forget how they made you feel. You can forgive the people who hurt you, but you will remember what they taught you.\u201d His gaze searched mine, waiting for warmth and understanding, which I was more than eager to give him.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not a bad man, Brooke. He was a strict father, and he threw me out because he believed in discipline, whereas my mother\u2014she only thought of herself when she left us. She didn\u2019t stay in contact. She loved her drugs more than us, which was so much worse than anything my father ever did. At least he cared enough to stay. He helped me out of the hole I buried for myself. I can forgive him, because he did what he had to do but I\u2019ll never forget how he made me feel.\u201d</p><p>His eyes glazed over, his mind recalling memories I couldn\u2019t reach. I brushed his back gently and his attention returned to me. \u201cCan I forgive my father for seeking the perversions of whatever Alessandro\u2019s club occasioned? Possibly. Will I forget the kind of man Robert is? Probably not.\u201d</p><p>He added the pasta to the boiling water, avoiding my gaze but I caught the glint of anger shimmering in his eyes nonetheless. It wasn\u2019t aimed at me; it was at his family\u2014the people who should\u2019ve loved him unconditionally, yet betrayed him when he needed them the most. In that instant I understood why he thought his father deserved a chance. Robert had been there for him once, or at least more than Jett\u2019s mother, so Jett felt a sense of obligation toward the old man.</p><p>I imagined myself having Robert Mayfield as my father. Stern, hard, unrelenting, maybe even merciless. Having someone like him in my family, having to accept him just because he was my father, the only parent I had after the other one left. It wasn\u2019t a beautiful picture.</p><p>As if sensing the dark direction of my thoughts, Jett smiled at me weakly and the warmth in his eyes returned, enveloping me like a safe bubble.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d do anything to avoid being like them,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>I kissed the palm of his hand, wishing I could make him forget or at least ease the burden of his memories weighing down his soul. Returning his smile, I let my fingers glide up and down his sculpted arms. I wanted to help him forget, if only for a few minutes, and the only way I knew how to do that was to give him my passion. Gazing up at him, I trailed my hand from his nipple to his abdomen. The top button of his jeans was undone and I could make out the happy trail of dark hair that always enticed me.</p><p>\u201cAre you horny?\u201d His piercing eyes turned a darker shade of green. I could see his instant desire in the way his jeans tightened around his groin and the way he watched me.</p><p>\u201cA bit.\u201d I bit my lip. \u201cAnd you?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m always horny when you\u2019re around.\u201d He laughed, his voice hoarse and erotic, filled with a silent invitation. \u201cYou\u2019re sexy. You set everything on fire, and you know I can\u2019t keep my hands off you when you\u2019re looking at me like this.\u201d</p><p>He tugged at the belt of my bathrobe, opening it slowly. My blood rushed harder and my breath came faster. Towering over me, he looked at me with his sexy bedroom eyes, the kind of eyes that said everything along the lines: I want you. I need you. And if you don\u2019t give me what I crave, I\u2019ll take it. And you\u2019ll like it. You\u2019ll love it. You\u2019ll want more.</p><p>And I did. I wanted him. I wanted him so bad that I buried my hands in his hair, and I pressed my body against him, my desire burning through me like hot lava, burning my mind, burning through every barrier that held me back. His fingers caught hold of my hips, pulling me against him, and his mouth descended upon mine so hard, heat pooled between my legs.</p><p>\u201cI fucking want you. I want you so hard.\u201d His fingers trailed down my thighs and then up again, his scorching touch sending my pulse into a frenzy. \u201cI want you so much, I don\u2019t want you to be with anyone but me.\u201d</p><p>His hot lips moved to the corner of my mouth while his thumb stroked my cheek, the other hand caressing the sensitive spot between my legs. A soft moan escaped my mouth as he started to kiss my shoulders. His teeth grazed my skin. I imagined them on my nipples and on the inside of my thighs. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>An unpleasant smell reached my nostrils.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s burning.\u201d</p><p>Our dinner was burning. Pushing Jett away, I reached out to remove the pan from the hotplate but he beat me to it.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not the only thing burning here.\u201d His sexy smile made me melt like chocolate under his double meaning forbidden promise. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy how much you turn me on.\u201d</p> <p>He switched off the stove, his fingers moving so fast I couldn\u2019t follow. One second I watched him brush aside the clutter covering the oversized kitchen counter, and the next second both of his hands cupped my ass and lifted me onto the counter. My bathrobe barely covered my naked body as he started to kiss my shoulders and my nipples, the bulge in his slacks rubbing hard and deliciously against my sex starved entrance.</p><p>\u201cJett,\u201d I whispered. \u201cIs it really a good idea to do it here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with it? We\u2019ve never done it in the kitchen. It\u2019s only a matter of time until we do so we might as well do it right here, right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood point.\u201d</p><p>How could I argue with that?</p> <p>The tip of his tongue moistened his lower lip, leaving a glistering trail of moisture behind. My fingers clawed at his back, pulling him against me. His thumb started to rub my clitoris until I felt my juices slowly gathering between my legs, and then ever so slowly, he dipped his finger inside me, the rotating motion making me moan.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re turning me on,\u201d I whispered against his shoulder.</p><p>His finger moved faster, matching the pace of his thumb, as he thrust it in and out. I raised my hips and wrapped my thighs around his waist. My stomach quivered. My whole body trembled for him as his thumb continued to stimulate my clit.</p><p>\u201cI want you inside me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d Jett whispered. \u201cYou\u2019re so wet. Do you hear that?\u201d He laughed quietly into my neck as he slid a second finger into me. My sex clenched around him, welcoming him with a squishing hum. \u201cThat\u2019s the sound of love, baby. That\u2019s how I know I turn you on.\u201d</p><p>Holy mother of pearls!</p> <p>Did he have to be so blunt? My cheeks caught fire. I opened my mouth to protest, but he shut me up with a hot rich kiss, his talented fingers continuing to do their magic tricks, bringing me closer to the edge.</p><p>Holy cow.</p><p>The guy was good. Really good.</p><p>Higher and higher waves of arousal washed over me, and my head began to spin in the vortex only Jett could create. I didn\u2019t mind the vulnerability\u2014lying naked on the kitchen counter. I didn\u2019t mind that the kitchen had two large windows and anyone could see me in the heights of lust. Hell, I didn\u2019t even mind Jett watching me circling my hips shamelessly against his talented hand. What I minded was not having him inside me when my orgasm was near. From the even thrusts of his fingers, I knew his little torture would get me there fast.</p><p>As if sensing my thoughts, Jett\u2019s fingers pulled out of me. \u201dAre you ready for a deeper plunge?\u201d His voice dripped with insinuation, as his thumb continued to circle around my clit.</p><p>I felt the prod of his erection against my sensitive entry and ran my hands down his chest, exploring the hardness of his muscles beneath my fingers. He kissed me as he spread my legs wider, his tongue tangling with mine, sucking it, nibbling my lips, while the length of his erection rubbed against my entry, spreading the moisture of our arousal.</p><p>\u201cYou have me but are you mine?\u201d Jett whispered, his deep voice sending another delicious pull through the depths of my sex. Did he have to talk when I was balancing on the edge of insanity, waiting for him to give me the final push? I was wet and in need of release; if he wouldn\u2019t give it, then I\u2019d go for it and take it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m yours, Jett.\u201d I moistened my lips, the lust savaging my body throbbing so hard I was ready to demand his rawness fill the emptiness inside me. I lifted my legs higher, my hips silently pleading with his hard shaft to enter me.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll take you at your word.\u201d</p><p>His large erection slid deep into my wet sex, filling me, taking every inch I had to offer. I quivered with delight at the way his shaft felt inside me\u2014moving, thrusting\u2014slow but immensely deep. His groans became louder and faster as I matched his movements. With every pound my nerve endings caught fire anew, until my sheath contracted around him, sucking him deeper into me, creating a feeling of closeness and intimacy as he impaled and stretched me. Lost in him, I let go of everything but the sensation of him slamming into me.</p><p>Jett dipped his tongue into my mouth, mirroring the fast movements of his hips, his hard flesh plunging deep inside me. He told me how tight I was, how beautiful I was in my need for him, and how he felt my orgasm building as I arched my back to welcome his thrusts.</p><p>\u201cBrooke,\u201d he moaned my name, a moment before my vision blurred and I bucked against him. Waves of pleasure rocked my body. A moment later thick hot moisture exploded inside me and he climaxed against my damp body, consumed by the pleasure my body had given him. And I drowned in the sea of release, the air heavy with our scent mixed with herbs.</p><p>We were still panting when Jett buttoned up his jeans and helped me off the counter. I wrapped my bathrobe against my shivering body and tied my wet hair at the nape of my neck.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Jett placed a soft kiss on my forehead.</p><p>I nodded, figuring I didn\u2019t need a mirror to know that my cheeks were red and I was smiling, matching the grin on his face. I had never made love in a kitchen so another first for us.</p><p>We cleaned up the mess and erased any proof of our intimate session in silence, enjoying each other\u2019s presence without the need to talk. By the time we were done it was a little after ten. Jett followed my glance to my watch and wrapped his arms around me whispering, \u201cTired?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a hard day. Do you care for a pre-midnight snack?\u201d His eyes twinkled with mischief and for a moment I wasn\u2019t sure whether he was talking about food or sex\u2014until he drained the pasta in a sieve.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m starving,\u201d I said, ready to take whichever of the two options he offered. \u201cYou finish dinner while I get changed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t take too long, woman.\u201d He slapped my butt playfully. I giggled and moved past him.</p><p>Upstairs, I slipped into a clean pair of jeans and a long-sleeved shirt. I was halfway through the foyer when I noticed Jett standing near the window, in the darkness of the living room.</p><p>\u201cYou scared me.\u201d I laughed uneasily.</p><p>\u201cShhh.\u201d He pressed a finger against his mouth and motioned me to step closer. I tiptoed to him, wondering what the heck was going on.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d I whispered because his paranoia was contagious. He pulled the curtain aside so I could look. It took my eyes several seconds to adjust to the darkness and my brain another few seconds to process what I was seeing. A man was standing near the house, his features blurred in the moonlight, so I couldn\u2019t make out his face.</p><p>\u201cStay here and be quiet,\u201d Jett whispered.</p><p>\u201cAre you crazy? I\u2019m not staying behind,\u201d I whispered. He shushed me by placing a finger on my lips, motioning me to stay. I watched him sneak to the door his hand wrapped around a gun. It had to be the same one I had seen in the car. He must have hid it in his jacket or in the grocery box. My hands covered my mouth to stifle a scream.</p><p>Oh god!</p><p>He was going to shoot and someone would get hurt.</p><p>My heart hammered so hard all I could hear was my blood rushing through my veins. And then my mind began to spin with possibilities. What if the other guy carried a gun too and he shot Jett? What if Jett killed him and we\u2019d end up in even bigger trouble? What if there were more people outside just waiting for Jett to walk blindly into a trap?</p><p>I wasn\u2019t going to let my guy die. He had to stay inside\u2014with me\u2014 and keep that door closed so that nobody could enter and we could call for help.</p><p>\u201cJett, no.\u201d I whispered after him, shaking my head, signaling to stay. But he ignored me. Before I could move an inch, he was outside. Paralyzed by fear, I pulled the curtain aside. The intruder was gone and Jett disappeared out of my vision.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t going to stay put and wait for disaster to strike. Before I could change my mind, I dashed out the door as quietly as I could, aware that my breathing sounded like I had a saxophone inside my chest.</p><p>The night was pitch black. The moon hid behind thick clouds but the air was surprisingly balmy. Apart from the chirping of crickets, I could hear no sounds. I moved past the white balustrades, down the stone stairs, gravel crunching beneath my feet as I took a left turn toward where I thought I had seen Jett disappear through the window. My eyes were slowly adjusting to the darkness\u2014good enough to show me the way, but too weak not to mistake tree shadows and branches for people. Still, my courage was stronger than my fear. It was true. Love gave me courage.</p><p>I walked around the house, almost reaching the front porch, when Jett and another guy appeared in my line of vision.</p><p>\u201cDrop your weapon before I shoot you.\u201d Jett\u2019s voice was cold, unrelenting. A voice that would not hesitate to hurt someone, a voice I had never heard before. A voice so damn sexy I would\u2019ve smiled with pride at the fact that he was my man\u2014if I wasn\u2019t so scared. A twig snapped under my feet. Jett turned his head sharply and in the darkness his gaze fell on me. I could almost see the angry lines around his mouth.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck? Go back inside, Brooke.\u201d</p><p>Holy cow, he was hot when he was angry. His tone kept me transfixed to the spot, unable to follow his command.</p><p>\u201cWhat did I tell you, Brooke? Get back inside,\u201d Jett hissed.</p><p>My feet felt like they were glued to the spot.</p><p>\u201cTurn around,\u201d Jett ordered the man.</p><p>\u201cJett?\u201d Holding up his hands, the guy spun around. The first two things I noticed about him were his black leather jacket and the tattoos on his naked arms.</p><p>It was the same guy from the bar\u2014the one Sylvie couldn\u2019t keep her hands off.</p><p>I blinked several times as I tried to match the man standing in front of Jett to the memory inside my head. Strong jaw. Pierced eyebrow. Sturdy build. And he was tall; almost as tall as Jett. Yeah, it was definitely the same person and he still looked like a drug dealer.</p><p>\u201cHe must have followed us from the club,\u201d I said. \u201cShould I call the police?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s your girl?\u201d the guy said. I couldn\u2019t help but notice the amusement in his tone. \u201cI\u2019m glad you found her, man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKenny.\u201d Jett slapped his shoulder. \u201cI was about to shoot you. Yeah, that\u2019s her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know him?\u201d I inched closer. Jett wrapped his arms around me and pulled me close, grinning.</p><p>\u201cThis is Kenny. We\u2019re going way back,\u201d Jett said.</p><p>He stepped closer to me and extended his hand. \u201cI\u2019m Kenny. Jett\u2019s friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you.\u201d I shook his hand, my heart still pounding because, in all honesty, I couldn\u2019t shake off the feeling he was involved in some shady business.</p><p>Your girl.</p><p>My mind circled around Kenny\u2019s words. Was that how Jett had titled me around his friends?</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d Jett said, oblivious to the sudden burst of affection invading my heart. \u201cNow it makes sense why I couldn\u2019t reach you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWent on a date.\u201d Kenny grinned.</p><p>I blinked because the answer was so obvious and yet I had to ask. \u201cA date? With whom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA blond girl\u2014Sylvie,\u201d Kenny said.</p><p>Sylvie went on a date with him and didn\u2019t tell me? \u201cWhere is she?\u201d I asked.</p> <p>\u201cShe told me she couldn\u2019t use the front door, because someone was home, so I walked her around the house. I had no clue you guys were in there. I thought she was living with her parents.\u201d Kenny seemed like a nice guy. Friendly. Good manners. Definitely not how I pictured him at all. And he was Jett\u2019s friend. I found myself warming up to him.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to come in?\u201d I asked. \u201cWe were about to eat but there\u2019s enough food and drink for everyone.\u201d</p><p>Jett raised his brow. I shrugged and smiled at Kenny in the hope he\u2019d accept my invitation because I wanted to get to know Jett\u2019s friends. I wanted to know everything about him.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Kenny said.</p><p>We switched on the lights in the hall and were halfway to the kitchen when I spied Sylvie through the open living room door. At the sight of Kenny, she smiled and opened her mouth to explain. I cut her off.</p> <p>\u201cYeah, I know. He told us already. Turns out he and Jett are friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long have you been involved?\u201d Jett asked.</p><p>Sylvie\u2019s jaw dropped. \u201cWhat the fuck is wrong with you? Do I look like I\u2019m crazy and participating in a sect?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a club,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd I think Jett was asking about Kenny and you.\u201d</p><p>Jett turned his head back to me, mild annoyance shimmering in his eyes. \u201cI told you not to tell anybody.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t,\u201d Sylvie said. \u201cI\u2019m just psychic.\u201d</p> <p>I laughed at her sarcasm. My laughter died in my throat at Jett\u2019s glare. \u201cWe\u2019ve been best friends forever. She\u2019d never betray my trust.\u201d</p><p>Sylvie\u2019s chin shot up and her eyes sparkled with pride. \u201cThat\u2019s true. I\u2019m the most trustworthy person in the world. Your secret\u2019s safe with me\u2014even safer than with the CIA and I\u2019ve heard they keep secrets pretty well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Jett muttered.</p><p>We were in the kitchen when Kenny said to Jett, \u201cYou pulled out a fucking gun on me. Were you trying to impress her, man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo need to. Done that already.\u201d Jett grinned and winked at me.</p><p>Earth swallow me up whole!</p><p>\u201cSorry, I didn\u2019t want to interrupt you guys,\u201d Sylvie whispered.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>I forced a smile to my face and prayed she would mistake my blush for the beginning of sunburn. If she had entered the house a few minutes earlier, she would have caught us in the middle of an intimate sex act.</p><p>\u201cWe were busy with cooking. Right, Brooke?\u201d Jett said. \u201cI was teaching her how to prepare meat.\u201d</p><p>Kenny let out a low chuckle.</p><p>\u201cAw, that\u2019s nice,\u201d Sylvie said, oblivious to the shame burning inside me at Jett\u2019s double meaning and the way his hand rested possessively on my ass like it belonged there.</p><p>Chapter 22</p><p>I woke up to the chirping of birds. The sun was shining, bathing the bedroom in a golden glow. Jett\u2019s side of the bed was empty but he had left a note on the nightstand.</p><p>I\u2019ll be back around 4. Stay in and keep your phone switched on! And thanks for dessert. It was THE best. Jett x.</p><p>Dessert. In that instant my mind transported me back in time to our love making, and I felt my cheeks heating up from the memory of him kissing me so deeply I forgot the world around me. I couldn\u2019t wait for more of that.</p><p>After a quick shower, I put on clean clothes and then checked in on Sylvie. She was asleep, her long legs tangled in the sheet.</p><p>I sat down on the bed not so gingerly and pulled the sheet aside the way she always did when she woke me up.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d I said. \u201cWake up, sleeping beauty.\u201d</p><p>Groaning, she squinted and pulled the sheet out of my hand and over her head.</p><p>\u201cGive me five minutes? I\u2019m so tired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. I\u2019ll be in the kitchen.\u201d I tickled her feet and she screamed, pulling away.</p><p>\u201cGo away, Brooke.\u201d</p><p>Laughing, I left because Sylvie had a short temper and it was only a matter of time before she threw a pillow at me.</p><p>I opened the back door to let in fresh air, and brewed a pot of coffee. Sitting outside on the porch overlooking the woods, I sighed with pleasure as my mind began to rewind last night\u2019s firsts: first sex in the kitchen, first time meeting a friend of Jett\u2019s, our first dinner with friends. I almost squealed with delight at the realization that our relationship was developing beyond our bedroom. But what made my heart melt, and not because of the warm morning sun, was the fact that Jett had introduced me as \u2018his girl.\u2019 That was the most important milestone to date.</p><p>Half an hour later, just as I was about to get my second coffee fix for the day, Sylvie made her grand entrance, her usually perfect hair a big tousled mess.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She glared at my suppressed smile.</p><p>\u201cLooks like you had a roll in the hay with Kenny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRolling\u2019s not the only thing we did.\u201d She pointed to an empty wine bottle on the kitchen counter. \u201cWe helped ourselves from your future wine cellar and drank the whole thing in the pool.\u201d</p><p>My brows shot up. \u201cAt four a.m.?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m an early bird.\u201d She sat down at the kitchen table and hugged her naked knees to her chest. I pushed my mug of coffee into her hands the way she had done many times.</p><p>\u201cSounds like you had fun,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cWe did, right before your guy demanded that Kenny accompany him to god knows where and I went to bed.\u201d She took a big gulp out of my coffee and sighed with pleasure. \u201cSo what do you think of him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho? Kenny?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>Hesitating, I considered my words. She had never asked me about my opinion before. The sudden interest unnerved me, not least because I didn\u2019t know Kenny and had no idea what Sylvie wanted to hear. Jett had introduced Kenny as a computer expert and one of his oldest friends from \u2018earlier days\u2019, so I could only guess they went through a lot together. Jett had turned his life around. Maybe Kenny did the same. At this point, I didn\u2019t want to come across as judgmental or overly enthusiastic, but I didn\u2019t want to see Sylvie hurt either.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s hot.\u201d I met her eager gaze and realized she was hanging on my every word. Damn. \u201cI think that even though he looks like a bad boy, it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean he\u2019d ever let you down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Her blue eyes sparkled with delight, as though I had just confirmed her own thoughts.</p><p>I nodded and decided to change the subject. \u201cDo you know where the guys are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey didn\u2019t say.\u201d She tied her long blond hair at the nape of her neck and took another sip of coffee.</p><p>\u201cIt was a long night for you, huh?\u201d I laughed at her expression as she lifted a hand to high-five me. Her eyes were a rich shade of baby blue\u2014the kind of eyes that fooled you into thinking she was innocent, when in reality all she wanted was having fun.</p><p>\u201cWant more coffee?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather have breakfast. I\u2019m starving.\u201d</p><p>I opened a cupboard and retrieved a box of cereals when my cellphone rang. I checked the caller ID, remembering Jett\u2019s instructions not to respond to any calls\u2014not even from Alessandro\u2019s lawyer.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Clarkson!\u201d I said to Sylvie. We watched the phone ring a few times and then it stopped and a text appeared announcing that I had a voice message. I pressed the phone to my ear and listened.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, Brooke. It\u2019s Ken Clarkson. I hope I\u2019m not intruding. I\u2019m sorry to inform you that Mr. Lucazzone suffered from a stroke last night. He\u2019s in a coma and the doctors cannot confirm that he\u2019ll make it. As your attorney, I will keep you up to date. Thank you, and if there is anything you need, please let me know.\u201d</p><p>His voice was polite but straightforward, almost unaffected. It was hard to believe that he was relaying bad news.</p><p>\u201cWhat did he want?\u201d Sylvie filled two bowls with cereals, poured milk on top, and then placed one in front of me. I watched the cocoa rings dye the milk a chocolaty color.</p><p>\u201cAlessandro had a stroke and the doctors don\u2019t know whether he\u2019ll ever wake up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Brooke.\u201d She wrapped her arms around me and held me tight.</p><p>I took a deep breath, forcing my mind to stay rational. I wasn\u2019t attached to Alessandro, but I couldn\u2019t shake off the sadness at hearing he might not make it. Even though we weren\u2019t related by blood, he was a family member after all. Until we had concrete proof of his actions and intentions, I didn\u2019t want to see him as a bad person.</p><p>\u201cI hope he\u2019ll be okay,\u201d I said.</p><p>We ate in silence and cleaned our bowls when Sylvie said, \u201cI feel sick,\u201d and bolted out the door. I followed her into the bathroom and gathered her long hair at the nape of her neck as she emptied the contents of her stomach in the toilet.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d I asked, stroking her back. She nodded. Frowning, I helped her up and re-arranged her clothes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she said weakly.</p><p>\u201cMaybe the wine was too old.\u201d I had never seen her sick before and it was the most plausible explanation. Either that, or the hot weather and lack of sleep were catching up with her.</p><p>She held her hands under the cold-water faucet and moistened her face. \u201cActually this was the third time. I was sick the last two days.\u201d</p><p>I passed her a towel. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me before? You need to see a doctor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I need to.\u201d She met my gaze. \u201cMy period\u2019s eight days late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think you\u2019re\u2014\u201d I couldn\u2019t even finish that word.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I think I\u2019m pregnant.\u201d She sat down on the cold bathroom tiles and pressed her back against the wall, her face buried in her palms. A pregnancy was one of her worst nightmares. The few times we talked about marriage and children, she had been adamant she never wanted any of those, which is why she always insisted on protection.</p><p>I squatted down in front of her, and grabbed her hands. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Obviously, I\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get a pregnancy test.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, now.\u201d I pulled her to her feet and squeezed my arm around her waist in case her nausea returned. Even though Jett instructed me to stay in, my best friend\u2019s peace of mind was a priority. \u201cWe get the test. No shopping. No other delays. And no telling Jett we were gone.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>On the way to Bellagio, I held Sylvie\u2019s hands to comfort her.</p><p>\u201cAs long as we haven\u2019t seen the test results, there\u2019s no need to worry,\u201d I whispered. \u201cIt could be stomach flu or food poisoning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy period\u2019s always on time,\u201d she whispered back, ignoring my plausible explanations.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you on the birth control pill?\u201d I asked. We both were. She nodded. \u201cThen you\u2019re okay. Trust me.\u201d I could only hope I wasn\u2019t overly positive, but the chance of a pregnancy was so minimal, I didn\u2019t see the sense in reinforcing her worries. \u201cYou cannot possibly fall pregnant within a few hours.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She looked up. \u201cActually, this isn\u2019t the first time Kenny and I did it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUhm...\u201d She buried her face in her hands again, hiding from me.</p><p>\u201cSylvie?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Brooke. It was the day when you went on a date with Jett.\u201d</p><p>Was that the time he showed me his boat? \u201cThe day you said you went to Bellagio instead of Milan?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t.\u201d I gasped. \u201cYou lied to me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo did you!\u201d</p> <p>I couldn\u2019t deny that.</p><p>\u201cGeez, Sylvie. You could have been abducted.\u201d My head was spinning from all the horrendous things that could\u2019ve happened to her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t want to tell you because I thought you were hurting and I wanted the focus to be on you. It just didn\u2019t seem fair that I had found someone I liked while your heart was broken.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d I squeezed her hand reassuringly. \u201cYou said you were sick several times in the last three days. Technically, Kenny couldn\u2019t be the father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho then?\u201d She peered at me, confused\u2014and then realization dawned on her. \u201cShit. I hope I\u2019m not knocked up by that asshole.\u201d</p><p>With asshole, she was referring to her ex, a married man, who first tricked her into believing he was single and then that he wanted a relationship with her. Just like Jett, Ryan happened to be her boss, with the only difference that he fired Sylvie when his wife found out about the affair.</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s just hope it\u2019s food poisoning,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>Chapter 23</p><p>Traveling to Bellagio to get a home pregnancy test was a bad idea. Not only did Sylvie end up buying three, she also managed to convince me she needed a whole lot of other stuff. As soon as we reached the main street, she dragged me from shop to shop and she ended up with a new pair of shoes, a light summer dress, and a bottle of apr\u00e8s sun lotion for me, which I\u2019m pretty sure I didn\u2019t really need...that much. On the bright side, she didn\u2019t dawdle trying on clothes because she looked amazing in anything she wore. Miraculously, the whole shopping spree took her only around half an hour.</p><p>It was shortly after noon when the taxi driver stopped in front of the house. I was about to unlock the front door when my cellphone rang again. I fished it out of my handbag and checked the caller ID. It was Jett.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you?\u201d he barked down the line. My heart skipped a beat.</p><p>\u201cStop worrying. I\u2019m fine,\u201d I said. It was the truth. We were still living and breathing. Basically, nobody got hurt so he didn\u2019t need to know my little secret.</p><p>He let out a long breath. \u201cGood. We\u2019re on our way back and should be there in twenty minutes.\u201d</p><p>He hung up and I relayed the message to Sylvie.</p> <p>\u201cWe need to hurry,\u201d she said.</p><p>I followed her to the bathroom and sat down on the floor, realizing she was going to use the pregnancy test.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t read the instructions. They\u2019re in Italian. But we should be fine anyway. You see this stuff on TV all the time.\u201d She tore one of the foils to remove the test stick and held it up to me. \u201cWhat do I do now? Stick it into a glass of urine or what?\u201d</p><p>How would I know?</p><p>It wasn\u2019t like I had ever needed one of those.</p><p>\u201cI think you need to turn the test stick so that the purple side of the handle is facing you. And then you hold the other side into your stream of urine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Turn around.\u201d</p><p>I focused hard not to listen to the gushing sound. Barely a minute later, she tapped my shoulder. \u201cYou can turn around now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFinished already?\u201d I sat up and regarded the stick in her hand.</p><p>\u201cYeah. What\u2019s next?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019d say put the cap back on and then put it on the table.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor how long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA few minutes, I guess.\u201d I thought back to all the TV advertisements I had ever seen and not paid attention to when I should have. The knowledge would have come in handy.</p><p>Sylvie turned on the water faucet and washed her hands. I stroked her back. \u201cYou\u2019ll be okay. Even if you\u2019re pregnant, it\u2019s not the end of the world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she whispered, staring at herself in the mirror. \u201cBut I\u2019m not ready to be a mom. I don\u2019t want to be a single mother raising a kid.\u201d</p><p>We stood in silence as the seconds ticked by.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t look. Can you look for me?\u201d Sylvie said eventually.</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d I lifted the pregnancy test and held it up to examine the pink colored band in the small window.</p><p>Sylvie peered over my shoulders. \u201cAm I pregnant?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I think two bands stand for a positive result, so I\u2019d say no.\u201d</p><p>She let out a whoop of joy, her smile dying on her lips almost instantly. \u201cWhat do you mean \u2018I think?\u2019\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s not like I\u2019m an expert or anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t they just mark it P for positive and a smiley for not pregnant?\u201d</p><p>I laughed at her attempt at infusing humor. \u201cYou should give it another go in case you didn\u2019t hold it under the stream long enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh right. I thought dipping it in there was enough.\u201d She smirked and grabbed another test. I turned away to give her privacy.</p><p>\u201cHey, Brooke. On the off chance I\u2019m not reading this right, can you try the third one? Comparing my result with yours would make me feel better. I don\u2019t want to think I\u2019m not pregnant and then find out I am when it\u2019s too late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Just give me a minute.\u201d I took the stick from Sylvie\u2019s outstretched hand and waited until she walked out of the bathroom leaving the door ajar. Using a pregnancy test when I wasn\u2019t pregnant was definitely strange but I had done stranger things to help Sylvie out.</p><p>A minute later I was done and called Sylvie back in. She held out her hand. I handed the pregnancy test to her and she placed it on the marble counter.</p><p>\u201cWith your result we can\u2019t be wrong,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d I sat down on the edge of the bathtub and tapped my fingers against my thigh, waiting.</p><p>\u201cBrooke,\u201d Sylvie whispered. Sensing the sudden tension in her voice, I turned and followed her line of vision, my heart slumping in my chest. \u201cDidn\u2019t you say two bands means pregnant? Yours is showing two.\u201d</p><p>I snatched the test from her hand and stared at it, my mind unable to comprehend the meaning of it all. There were two lines, which had to be a mistake.</p><p>\u201cOh shit.\u201d Sylvie laughed. \u201cYou are pregnant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t be.\u201d My voice failed me as I tried to make sense of the situation. \u201cDid you switch the sticks? If you did, it\u2019s not funny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a prank. I\u2019d never do that.\u201d Which was true. She didn\u2019t like jokes, or playing games.</p><p>I frowned. \u201cHonestly, it must be a mistake. I\u2019m on the pill. My period is due any minute. Maybe I got it all wrong and one band means pregnancy and two means nothing. It could be an Italian thing or the brand differs from those advertised back home.\u201d</p><p>I felt myself panicking but couldn\u2019t stop it.</p><p>Take a deep breath, Stewart.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re kidding, right?\u201d Sylvie said. \u201cThe instructions are in Italian, but in the end all pregnancy tests are the same and they work the same way.\u201d</p><p>Denial is bliss.</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cNo, you\u2019re the one feeling sick and I\u2019m okay. Besides, my period\u2014\u201d I broke off, unable to process the shock. My period was never really on time. It changed like the weather. So that argument wasn\u2019t valid.</p><p>\u201cIt can\u2019t be, Sylvie,\u201d I murmured. \u201cI never forget to take the pill. Every single day, at the same time. It must be false positive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing\u2019s a hundred percent safe, and particularly not if you\u2019re sick or there\u2019s something wrong with your hormones.\u201d She squeezed my arm gently. \u201cLike you said, it\u2019s not the end of the world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI only tried to be supportive when I said that.\u201d I thought back to my first trip to Bellagio. Jett and I were staying at his house. During one dinner, I got intoxicated and sick. It wasn\u2019t my proudest moment, which is why I must have repressed it and never told Sylvie about it. Maybe the few glasses of wine messed with my hormones.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a false positive,\u201d I whispered. \u201cIt has to be because we\u2019re only dating for a few weeks and it doesn\u2019t happen that fast.\u201d</p><p>Sylvie threw the pregnancy tests in the garbage bin and grabbed my arm, forcing me to follow her to the library.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I asked as she sat down in front of the computer.</p><p>\u201cGoogling pregnancy tests.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe guys will be back any minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s hope this old thing\u2019s fast.\u201d She heaved a long sigh as we waited for the computer to boot. It whirred idly, like it had all the time in the world. Waiting wasn\u2019t good. It made me anxious. I could feel dark clouds descending upon my head.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d Sylvie said, turning on the browser and navigating to a search engine. Her longer fingers moved over the keyboard effortlessly and then, with one click, I had my answer.</p><p>Two bands...positive.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re pregnant. Congratulations!\u201d Sylvie said, grinning. \u201cIt\u2019s not me; it\u2019s you.\u201d</p><p>I glared at her, ignoring the sudden urge to pour a glass of water over her head. I felt so faint my legs threatened to buckle beneath me.</p><p>\u201cBrooke? Oh, shit,\u201d Sylvie said. \u201cCome on. Sit down. Don\u2019t be upset. You know I didn\u2019t mean it like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cImpossible. The test\u2014 \u201d Sitting in her chair, I took a deep breath and let it out slowly. \u201c\u2014is wrong. I don\u2019t feel pregnant.\u201d Lying to myself gave me a false sense of relief so I kept going because it was easier than facing the truth.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll repeat the test, maybe even go to the doctor\u2019s to check your blood results.\u201d</p><p>Which meant waiting at least a day or as long as it\u2019d take to get an appointment. I couldn\u2019t wait. Sylvie grabbed me in a tight hug and I rested my head against her chest, letting her stroke my hair, her soothing voice barely reaching me. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Brooke, it\u2019ll be okay.\u201d She kept repeating those stupid words I said. \u201cIt\u2019s not the end of the world.\u201d</p><p>It is the end of the world. Definitely.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I shook my head. \u201cI\u2019m doomed.\u201d</p><p>I wanted to be a mom one day; just not at this point. The thought of telling Jett filled me with dread. A pregnancy so early, when we barely knew each other, could ruin my relationship. He\u2019d run, like most men do. He\u2019d run as fast as he could, and that would hurt me more than anything in the world. I didn\u2019t want to lose him because of a mistake. A stupid mistake occurring under the influence of alcohol.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to tell him,\u201d Sylvie said, deleting the browser history and switching off the computer. \u201cIt might seem scary now. But once you do, you\u2019ll find out whether it was just a fling or more. And if he breaks up, which I hope he won\u2019t, then you can either let it define you or strengthen you. And there is always that option,\u201d she whispered. \u201cYou can get rid of it and he\u2019ll never know.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I thought about it for all of three seconds. \u201cThat\u2019s not me.\u201d</p><p>She smiled and brushed my hair off my face. \u201cI know and I would never encourage you to do that. It would destroy you, haunt you for the rest of your life, and that\u2019s a lot worse than the pain you\u2019d feel if he let you down.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 24</p><p>In the silence of the house, we heard the car pull outside and the doors slam shut. Figuring I was too shaken to face Jett, I hid inside the bathroom. Through the walls, I still could hear them downstairs, chatting and laughing. I pressed my feverish forehead against the cool wall tiles when a knock on my bathroom door made me flinch.</p> <p>\u201cBrooke?\u201d It was Jett. The strained undertones in his voice betrayed his worry. \u201cSylvie said you\u2019re in here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d Jumping to my feet, I straightened my clothes and stepped out of the bathroom, closing the door behind me. I curled my lips into a smile, praying it looked genuine enough to fool him. My pulse leaped as he lifted me up in his arms, and my stomach began to flutter at the way his lips brushed against mine, exploring my mouth as though we hadn\u2019t seen each other in weeks.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d he said after putting me back down.</p><p>\u201cJust a headache. That\u2019s all.\u201d It wasn\u2019t even a lie. Ever since discovering my possible pregnancy, I felt physically sick and my head was a throbbing pulp.</p><p>\u201cWhere were you?\u201d I tried to keep my tone casual in my attempt to steer the conversation to him.</p> <p>\u201cWe had the license plate checked. It was a waste of time. It\u2019s not registered and thus fake.\u201d He smirked and grabbed my hand. His fingers interlaced with mine. On any other occasion, his touch would have pleased me, but today it only managed to make me feel even worse.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be, baby. Kenny\u2019s hacking into Lucazzone\u2019s computer today. I\u2019m confident if there\u2019s something, Kenny will unearth it.\u201d</p><p>He walked downstairs to join Kenny and Sylvie. I felt Sylvie scrutinizing me, watching my every move. I grimaced at her in the hope she\u2019d get the hint to act normal. The last thing I needed was being examined like a bizarre specimen at the local zoo. Jett wasn\u2019t stupid. He\u2019d catch that something was wrong in a heartbeat.</p><p>\u201cDid you tell her about the computer?\u201d Kenny asked. At Jett\u2019s nod Kenny turned to me. \u201cAre you okay with it? The hard drive will be destroyed beyond repair and you\u2019ll have to throw it away.\u201d</p><p>Sylvie shot me a sideway glance. I could smell her fear in the air and gave her a noncommittal shrug. She had deleted the browser history so we had nothing to worry about.</p> <p>\u201cSure, Kenny. Do whatever you need to do. It\u2019s not like I intend to keep it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He snatched his rucksack and headed out, calling over his shoulder, \u201cBecause it can go two ways: Either we get into his computer, retrieve the information, and destroy the disk in the process. Or we find nothing, but the hard drive\u2019s done. Either way, what we do will leave a trail behind. A pro will be able to tell and there\u2019s no going back.\u201d</p><p>I swallowed hard. If Alessandro decided to check, he\u2019d find out that his guests had been snooping around the place. Did I really want that?</p><p>\u201cBrooke.\u201d Jett nodded at me encouragingly. \u201cWe talked about this in the basement, remember? You have a right to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I just\u2014\u201d I exhaled a slow breath. I could always tell Alessandro the computer broke down and I bought him a new one. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>Kenny lay out all the tools, then started to disassemble the computer, explaining each step.</p><p>\u201cIf the hard drive was erased, a pro might take weeks, maybe even months to retrieve the data. If you use a good data destruction software, no one will ever recover anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have weeks or months,\u201d Jett said.</p> <p>Kenny shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m just saying, man. The fact that you used the internet means the hard drive\u2019s not destroyed, so he probably performed a wipe-out. What was the guy\u2019s name again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucazzone,\u201d I said. \u201cSo how long do you think you\u2019ll take?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat depends. Maybe an hour.\u201d</p><p>Kenny continued his chatter as he removed the hard drive and pushed it into what looked like a black box, which he called an enclosure, and connected it to his computer. It all looked so complicated and, judging from Sylvie\u2019s expression, boring. All I could see was a black screen\u2014until he opened a program and the data transfer began.</p><p>\u201cThe software\u2019s doing its own rewriting during the data retrieval process. We\u2019re burning the entire information as an ISO image on this disk to make sure we have a backup,\u201d Kenny said, popping a mini CD-ROM into his computer.</p><p>I could see Sylvie was bored out of her mind from the way she suppressed a yawn, which made me laugh. She suffered from a short attention span, and in particular when a conversation involved sports, computers, or anything with no relation to fashion, men, or parties.</p><p>\u201cSo boring,\u201d Sylvie mouthed. \u201cCome on.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head.</p><p>She grimaced and turned to Jett, gesturing at me. \u201cDo you mind if I borrow her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have thirty minutes, then I want her back,\u201d Jett said.</p><p>Sylvie pulled me into the kitchen and closed the door behind us.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>I hated when people asked that question. The desired answer is yes, even when you don\u2019t feel like it.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t ask,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cI just want to make sure you\u2019re okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d I groaned inwardly at her skeptical expression. \u201cPlease, Sylvie, I don\u2019t want to think about anything anymore. Please?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d Pouting, she sat down and regarded me. I grabbed the opportunity to change the subject.</p><p>\u201cRemember when I told you a private investigator found a diary in the chapel?\u201d I waited until she nodded before I continued. \u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to locate it.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes narrowed conspiratorially. \u201cDo you want to\u2014\u201d She trailed off, leaving the rest unsaid.</p><p>I looked out the window at the lush green scenery and the dense woods stretching as far as I could see. \u201cIt\u2019s stopped raining. I say we go check out the chapel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it far?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Come on. I\u2019ll show you.\u201d</p><p>Our flip-flops sank into the damp earth and the grass and fallen twigs scratched our feet as we made our way down the staircase and through the bushes.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nice,\u201d Sylvie remarked as we finally reached the chapel. I walked around the tiny building and tried to peer through the small window. The glass was too dirty to make out much but the wild rosebushes near the door told me at some point someone must have cared enough to plant them.</p><p>Sylvie pushed the rosebushes aside and moved past them, barely paying attention to their fragile beauty and the way they seemed to huddle together to protect themselves from nature\u2019s unpredictable forces.</p><p>We split up as we circled the chapel and finally found what we were looking for: a small door with a tiny but intricate cross engraved into the wood. I tried the door and to my surprise it wasn\u2019t locked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going in,\u201d I said. Sylvie stared at me with an expression that screamed sheer dread. As if the thought unnerved her, she took a step back.</p><p>\u201cNo way. I\u2019m not going in there. Sorry, you\u2019re on your own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s in the middle of the day. What do you think could possibly happen to you?\u201d Her face made me smile. \u201cOkay, stay here.\u201d</p><p>I pried the heavy door open and stepped into the semi dark room. It was bigger than it looked from outside\u2014maybe the size of a bathroom\u2014and accommodated two benches set up in front of an altar. The walls were covered in religious paintings. At the front of the altar was the sculpture of a sitting angel, his eyes cast on the concrete floor, appearing to be in deep thought, his face a mask of melancholy. I wondered whether Maria had felt that way during her marriage. I didn\u2019t know a lot about the woman, but I had a strong feeling the chapel hadn\u2019t been just a place of worship; it had also doubled as a refuge.</p><p>Kneeling, I made a cross sign and sat down on a bench, my gaze scanning the dirty window\u2014the only source of light. Branches scratched against the glass and the unnerving sound carried over like a silent warning. In that instant I felt something in the air\u2014a shiver of sadness. This place was filled with hopelessness, just like the woman who had come here to seek spiritual comfort. Maybe something terrible happened and she was ashamed of Alessandro\u2019s actions, and this was the only place of peace she could find.</p><p>\u201cFound anything?\u201d Sylvie called, jerking me out of my thoughts. I turned to see her standing in the doorway with her arms crossed over her chest and a frown darkening her features.</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cHurry up. This place gives me the creeps.\u201d</p><p>Jett\u2019s report specifically mentioned the diary had been buried, but the floor and walls were made of stone. I commenced my investigation by searching under the benches and altar for any hiding place large enough to fit a book or a diary, then brushed my hands over the stonewalls to make sure I wasn\u2019t missing a loose stone. I checked the religious paintings twice before I returned to Sylvie, convinced whoever removed the diary never put it back in its hiding place.</p><p>\u201cIf you wanted to hide something personal, where would you put it?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Sylvie shrugged. \u201cI\u2019d do what normal people do and get a safe.\u201d</p><p>I laughed. \u201cThat\u2019s not exactly hiding. Anyone could force you into giving away the lock combination.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess.\u201d She paused. \u201cYou could always bury a hole in the ground.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a good one.\u201d I scanned the yard and the overgrown thicket. Maria could have buried her diary anywhere on the estate, including under the rosebushes leading from the chapel to the backyard and around the house.</p><p>\u201cWhat exactly are you looking for?\u201d Sylvie asked. \u201cI mean, even if we find the original hiding spot, the diary isn\u2019t there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d I bent down and ran my hand through the damp earth, letting it crumble between my fingers. Jett told me the PI took the diary and then one day it was lost.</p><p>How could I explain to Sylvie that I was trying to find out what kind of life my great aunt had once led?</p><p>\u201cI was hoping I might find something\u2014anything that would help me visualize her life.\u201d I smiled, realizing just how ridiculous I sounded. Human life\u2019s so much more complex than a few diary entries. Even if the diary was still buried here somewhere and I found it, I couldn\u2019t possibly read her emotions and the kind of person she was from a few words strung together. Judging from Sylvie\u2019s skeptical look, she thought the same.</p><p>A strong wind rustled the leaves and raindrops began to drizzle down on us.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get back inside. I\u2019m cold.\u201d Sylvie said. \u201cWe\u2019ll dig up the whole place another day.\u201d</p><p>I was about to follow her, when a movement in my peripheral vision caught my attention. I scanned the woods. All I could see were trees, their wide crowns casting ominous shadows, and yet I couldn\u2019t shake off the overwhelming feeling of being watched. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBrooke?\u201d Sylvie called. \u201cAre you coming?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought I saw something.\u201d I turned away from the woods reluctantly.</p><p>\u201cOf course. If I inherited an estate with an eerie chapel, I\u2019d think it\u2019s haunted, too.\u201d</p><p>She was laughing at me. I slapped the back of her head gently. \u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant. It looked like a tall figure dressed in black.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNow you\u2019re creeping me out. Can we please go inside?\u201d Sylvie whispered.</p><p>\u201cIt was probably nothing anyway.\u201d I tried to infuse as much confidence into my voice as I could gather, but my glance trailed back to the trees. \u201cI\u2019m a little paranoid.\u201d Funnily, my words didn\u2019t sound particularly convincing.</p><p>\u201cI would be too if someone tried to kill me,\u201d Sylvie said, yanking at my arm. \u201cNothing against you, Stewart, but I feel safer around the guys.\u201d</p><p>We barely reached the house when the rain turned into a torrential downpour. Sylvie locked the backdoor behind us and I switched on the lights. She brewed us our obligatory afternoon coffee while I stood in front of the large bay window, staring at the puddles of rain and my reflection, unable to shake off the feeling of being watched.</p><p>We decided to drink our coffee with the guys in the library. The moment we entered, Jett\u2019s arms moved around my waist and stayed there, his chin resting against my head. I could feel his heart beating in unison with mine as his body heat warmed my skin.</p> <p>\u201cWhy are you wet?\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cWe visited the chapel.\u201d</p><p>He looked at me but didn\u2019t break our embrace. \u201cHow is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful.\u201d I paused to consider my words and found that none could do it justice. \u201cYou should check it out one day. See for yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you find anything yet?\u201d Sylvie asked, her hands resting on Kenny\u2019s shoulders, her eyes fixed on the computer. My eyes moved from her to Kenny\u2019s arms and for the first time I noticed one of his tattoos looked like Jett\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re getting there,\u201d Jett said, his lips descending to nuzzle my neck.</p> <p>I tried to twist my way out of his arms. He didn\u2019t let go. \u201cWhat have you found so far?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t checked everything but\u2014\u201d Jett held up the disk and smiled triumphantly \u201c\u2014the entire hard drive is on this disk.\u201d</p><p>There was something in his tone that made me look up. \u201cWhat\u2019s on it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to take days to go through everything but we found a file containing a spreadsheet with numbers. I\u2019ve written a couple of them down,\u201d Kenny said, pointing to the indecipherable handwriting on a sheet of paper.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you need the numbers for?\u201d Sylvie picked up the paper and walked over to me so we could look together.</p><p>\u201cThe first three digits of each and every number match the corresponding line in the black book,\u201d Jett replied. I met his glance and something passed between us. \u201cThey\u2019re all here. Look them up.\u201d</p><p>I counted the rows. There were thirty-six in total\u2014the exact same total of numbers. The first row on the paper started with the same three digits like the one in the black book.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I said. \u201cThe corresponding lines start out the same but after three digits the code seems to change?\u201d</p> <p>Jett nodded.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think they are?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cIf you count the number of digits, I\u2019d go for sort codes, bank accounts, or passwords,\u201d Kenny said. \u201cAnd since Jett has financial relations here, I suggest we drive to his bank and make a discreet enquiry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could give my advisor a call and ask to see him today,\u201d Jett said.</p><p>\u201cAnd if that doesn\u2019t work out, I\u2019ll hack into the bank\u2019s system,\u201d Kenny said.</p><p>\u201cNothing new there.\u201d Jett grinned at me, revealing his gorgeous dimples. \u201cKenny\u2019s the best money can hire. No wonder he\u2019s so popular.\u201d</p><p>A professional hacker? Holy cow.</p><p>I had assumed that was just a joke. I bit my lip to hide my shocked expression.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s so hot,\u201d Sylvie mouthed to me.</p><p>Of course she was into bad guys. And if they could do something as illegal as hacking into a bank\u2019s database, they immediately attained \u2018keeper\u2019 status for sure.</p><p>Chapter 25</p><p>We arrived in Bellagio in Jett\u2019s replacement car. Jett drove, Kenny sat in the passenger seat, while Sylvie and I huddled together in the backseat. My head was throbbing so hard, I felt slightly nauseous. Maybe it was the prospect of being pregnant, or maybe my nausea was the result of being pregnant. Either way, I was scared out of my mind.</p><p>I rested my head against the cold glass window and closed my eyes, the sound of the rain splashing down on the asphalt relaxing me. All I could think of was how my life had changed into a mess. Just when I thought it couldn\u2019t get more complicated, life twirled up another whirlwind of chaos, pushing me onto unknown territory.</p><p>There\u2019s nothing more frightening than not knowing what the future will bring. A baby was one of the biggest challenges I could think of. I had no job, no money, and knew nothing about raising kids.</p><p>\u201cWe need to get some aspirin from the drug store,\u201d Sylvie said to no one in particular.</p><p>You have enough aspirin to last you for a year, I wanted to say when I noticed her conspiratorial smile and consequent wink. She wanted to get rid of the guys, of course.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a large one on the main street. We could pop in quickly,\u201d Jett said, making it clear he wasn\u2019t going to let us out of his sight. His worried gaze brushed over me in the rearview mirror, and I shot him a weak smile.</p><p>A few minutes later the car came to a halt in front of the drug store. This was our chance to get out before he found a parking spot.</p><p>\u201cYou stay here. We\u2019ll be back in a minute,\u201d I said, opening the car door before Jett could argue.</p><p>\u201cBe quick,\u201d he called after us.</p><p>The rain was falling so heavily, we dashed for the store, eager to take refuge. Through the glass windows I could see Jett and Kenny\u2019s eyes following our every move. Figuring we had no time to waste, we headed straight for the counter.</p><p>\u201cWe need more pregnancy tests,\u201d Sylvie said to the same lady, who\u2019d served us on our first visit. \u201cOne from each brand you have in stock.\u201d</p><p>The woman nodded and smiled at me, probably sensing my turmoil.</p><p>\u201cOh, and a pack of aspirin,\u201d Sylvie added, nodding toward the window.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you need so many?\u201d I whispered, pointing to the tests.</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cWhat if they\u2019re faulty? We want to be sure either way.\u201d</p><p>We paid quickly, hid the pregnancy tests inside Sylvie\u2019s huge designer bag, and walked out holding the plastic bag containing the aspirin.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I whispered to her before we reached the car. I really appreciated her support.</p><p>\u201cYou know I\u2019m always here for you, no matter what.\u201d</p><p>With a questioning glance aimed at me, Jett started the engine and joined the main traffic, heading for the bank.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s the paper?\u201d he asked as soon as he had parked the car. Kenny handed it to him and Jett folded it in half.</p><p>\u201cOkay, this is what we do next,\u201d Jett said. \u201cYou stay here with the girls while I meet with my bank advisor and pretend I have to transfer money to two accounts. Don\u2019t come after me and don\u2019t leave the car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot it,\u201d Kenny said. And then Jett was gone.</p><p>The silence in the car felt awkward. Sylvie played with her hair, Kenny stared out the windows, and I was busy fidgeting with the hem of my shirt. I used the moment to get a good look at Kenny, not least because he seemed to genuinely care about Sylvie and I sort of wanted her to date one of Jett\u2019s friends.</p><p>From up close, I couldn\u2019t deny Kenny was attractive. His strong features and cropped dark hair gave him a somewhat rough and manly edge\u2014quite the opposite of Sylvie, who looked as sweet as a pie. If someone could see past the tattoos that covered half of his neck, his left arm, and his whole shoulder and back\u2014or so I was told\u2014he might just scrub up well enough to meet Sylvie\u2019s rich parents. I smiled at the prospect, until I realized he lacked two important features: money and success. Sylvie never talked much about her parents, but it was enough to know they valued social status higher than personality.</p><p>\u201cThe spreadsheet\u2019s the only thing you found so far?\u201d Sylvie asked Kenny.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He threw us a fleeting look over his shoulder. \u201cI\u2019ve discovered a whole lot of other stuff, but it\u2019s all irrelevant.\u201d</p><p>Focus on I.</p><p>He had not yet shared his findings with Jett. I swallowed hard.</p><p>As if on cue, Kenny\u2019s eyes rested on me. His expression was impassive, but his eyes twinkled. I couldn\u2019t help but feel slightly alarmed. Did he know? Could he somehow have tapped into our search engine history and stumbled upon the word \u2018pregnancy?\u2019</p><p>\u201cWhat stuff?\u201d I narrowed my gaze and a silent warning passed between us.</p><p>\u201cFavorite bookmarks like certain sports pages, Facebook pages and Wikipedia. Cookies people always fail to delete... that sort of thing.\u201d He didn\u2019t smile, but his dark blue eyes twinkled again. \u201cLike I said, all irrelevant.\u201d</p><p>My heart banged hard against my ribs.</p><p>He knew.</p><p>I could see it in his eyes. Hear it in his words.</p><p>\u201cI guess he wasn\u2019t careful enough,\u201d I suggested, meaning I hadn\u2019t been careful enough to erase any traces and because I was the soon-to-be owner, Kenny probably thought the info material on pregnancies concerned me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good at this stuff. I pick things up. It\u2019s like they just fall into my lap.\u201d Kenny leaned back in his chair and put his iPod on speakers, the sound of hard rock making me even more nervous.</p><p>Damn it, Stewart.</p><p>Of course deleting the browser history wasn\u2019t good enough when it came to hiding something from a professional hacker. Sylvie and I forgot to clear the cookies, and that\u2019s probably one of the first things someone like Kenny would check before trying to recover previous versions of the hard drive. I was ready to bet my pay check he could probably retrieve any sort of information, including the time one used the internet long after I reset the browser.</p><p>\u201cWhat is he talking about?\u201d Sylvie whispered.</p><p>I shrugged and shook my head.</p><p>After what felt like half an hour, Jett finally left the bank. My stomach fluttered as I watched him cross the street. Tall. Mesmerizing. Dark hair and perfect bone structure. A body to die for. It made me almost anxious to know he was with me.</p><p>He opened the car door and slumped into the driver\u2019s seat. From the way he threw the bag to Kenny before slamming the door shut, I could tell he was angry.</p><p>\u201cAnything?\u201d Kenny asked, switching off the music.</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d Jett started the engine and steered the car out of the parking lot, his face emotionless. He was pissed big time though, which was obvious from his driving\u2014faster than usual.</p><p>\u201cWhat did\u2014\u201d Sylvie began. I elbowed her gently and shook my head, my gaze uttering a silent warning.</p><p>Jett\u2019s hands tightened on the steering wheel until the white of his knuckles showed through his skin, but he remained quiet. Knowing Jett, letting him calm first was the only way anyone would get him to talk. He\u2019d start the conversation when he was ready. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Half-way back to the estate, I noticed his muscles relaxing a little.</p><p>\u201cI checked the first two numbers, and then I tried three more,\u201d Jett finally said, breaking the silence. \u201cThey\u2019re not bank accounts. The file we found is a dead end.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe they\u2019re passcodes,\u201d Kenny suggested.</p><p>\u201cPasscodes to what?\u201d Jett\u2019s frown line deepened.</p> <p>Unaffected by Jett\u2019s frostiness, Kenny leaned back into his seat and shrugged as Sylvie and I kept swapping curious glances.</p><p>\u201cMaybe someone deliberated created confusion, so you wouldn\u2019t find out the answer,\u201d Kenny said. \u201cThe right combination could be linking the first three digits of the first half of the list with the last three digits of the second half. It\u2019s just a suggestion. I doubt anyone would make this easy on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr they could be different kind of accounts. Not necessarily bank accounts,\u201d I chimed in.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t go back without raising suspicion,\u201d Jett muttered. \u201cEither you find out more, or you hack into wherever you think is necessary to give me something I can work with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was exactly my plan, bro.\u201d Kenny opened a foil wrapper and shoved a piece of chewing gum into his mouth, before tossing the whole pack to me and Sylvie, leaving a piece near the gearshift for Jett.</p> <p>Chapter 26</p><p>By the time we reached the estate, Jett\u2019s bad mood had lifted. We walked up the stairs, when Jett pushed me behind his back and motioned Kenny to be quiet. I scanned the area anxiously and my gaze fell on the front door. It stood ajar, just a few inches, but funnily enough, my first thought was that I might have forgotten to lock it when we left.</p><p>In spite of my heartbeat spiking, my mind remained surprisingly calm. Maybe because the rain had stopped, and the sun was shining, clearing the dark clouds and making it seem surreal that someone could have broken in in the middle of the day.</p><p>Pulling out his gun, Jett instructed me to hide with Sylvie behind the bushes on the other side of the house and stay there no matter what. And then, in the blink of an eye, he and Kenny were gone.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d I whispered to Sylvie, dragging her to the nearby bushes. We fought our way through the dense undergrowth, careful not to scratch our arms and legs. Reaching the backyard, we stooped down and I wrapped my arm around Sylvie. Our gazes remained glued to the closed balcony door and the house beyond while I listened for any sounds.</p><p>I began to count the seconds inside my head when a gunshot echoed to my right, then another, and a startled yelp escaped my lips. My heart stopped dead in my chest and I found myself leaping up and running across the open terrain around the house and through the front door\u2014my legs shaking bad, my lips trembling with Jett\u2019s name on them, my mind unaware of the fact that if anyone decided to shoot I was an easy target.</p> <p>\u201cJett,\u201d I shouted, running straight into his arms, happy to find him safe. The foyer was as silent as a tomb and Jett was alone\u2014the realization sent a jolt of ice through my veins. \u201cWhere\u2019s Kenny?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe took off after the guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you hurt?\u201d I brushed my fingers over Jett\u2019s arms and chest, checking for any wounds.</p><p>\u201cNo, but listen. I need you to stay inside, hidden. Okay?\u201d He kissed me absentmindedly and turned to leave. I gripped his upper arm, a rather feeble attempt at stopping him. \u201cPlease, don\u2019t go. I don\u2019t want you to get hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not getting hurt, baby,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Sylvie asked, her face a ghastly shade of white.</p><p>\u201cKenny\u2019s following the intruder,\u201d I said.</p><p>Her hands moved up to her chest. I wrapped my arms around her and pulled her aside. \u201cHe\u2019ll be okay.\u201d</p> <p>For the first time I noticed the place was ransacked. Almost every drawer had been opened and the contents scattered onto the floor.</p><p>\u201cMaybe we should lock ourselves up in the kitchen,\u201d I whispered to Sylvie, figuring that was the only place with an escape exit through the backdoor and plenty of weapons in case we needed to defend ourselves.</p><p>We waited in the kitchen in silence until we heard footsteps departing. Ever so gently, I locked the kitchen door behind us, grabbed a big butcher-like knife from the knife rack, and motioned Sylvie to hide behind the kitchen cupboards. Forcing myself to breathe quietly, I listened for any sounds.</p><p>\u201cBrooke?\u201d Jett\u2019s voice called from the hall. The strained undertones betrayed his worry.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re in here,\u201d Sylvie shouted.</p><p>My hand still clasped around the knife, I unlocked the door and opened it. Jett and Kenny were standing in the hall, their faces hard, betraying nothing. Sylvie jumped into Kenny\u2019s arms. I was tempted to do the same with Jett, but refrained from it.</p><p>\u201cAre you guys okay?\u201d she asked, clinging to Kenny for dear life. \u201cWe\u2019ve been worried sick about you. Thank God no one\u2019s dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re okay,\u201d Jett said. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t get them though.\u201d</p><p>Them?</p><p>I raised my eyebrows and hid my hands behind my back so he wouldn\u2019t see the knife, or my shaking fingers. \u201cHow many are we talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo. One broke in; the other one waited in the car. They sped off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas it the same car that chased us?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d Jett said. \u201cThey wore ski masks and the car had no license plate, but I\u2019m pretty sure it wasn\u2019t the same car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey spoke English. Right, bro?\u201d Kenny said to Jett. \u201cI heard the first one yelling something. You almost hit him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou shot him?\u201d I asked Jett, horrified.</p><p>What did you expect, Stewart?</p><p>Of course I knew violence was pretty much to expect in such a situation, but the knowledge didn\u2019t make it any easier to accept.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t hit him,\u201d Jett mumbled. \u201cUnfortunately. Let\u2019s check what they took.\u201d I stared at Jett open-mouthed. There was something in his gaze\u2014just a tiny flicker, but enough to show me he was hiding something and was trying hard to divert my attention from it.</p><p>\u201cJett, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d I asked, my gaze scanning his body to make sure he hadn\u2019t been shot. \u201cAre you hurt?\u201d My hands brushed his arms. That\u2019s when I noticed the tiny blood splatters on his shirt.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just a scratch,\u201d Jett said. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. I\u2019ve seen worse.\u201d</p><p>My throat tightened at his words. Who would say something like that?</p><p>\u201cHow did it happen?\u201d I pulled at his arm to force him to sit down. He flinched but didn\u2019t move.</p><p>\u201cKnife. I didn\u2019t seem him and he surprised me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me see.\u201d Ignoring Jett\u2019s protest, I pulled his shirt up and gasped at the two-inch wound on his torso. It was no longer bleeding and it didn\u2019t look deep but he\u2019d need at least proper sanitizing, if not stitches. I didn\u2019t want his beautiful skin blemished, nor did I want him to endure any sort of pain.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to the hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just a scratch, baby,\u201d Jett said, pulling the shirt back down.</p><p>\u201cWe need to treat that.\u201d I glared at him, annoyed by the determined look in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI said not now.\u201d He pushed my hand away and started off down the hall toward the library.</p><p>Damn his stubbornness and unwillingness to give in.</p><p>I hurried after him and stopped in the doorway, ready to argue some more when Kenny let out a string of expletives.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Jett asked.</p><p>Kenny pointed to Alessandro\u2019s computer. It was still there. \u201cEverything important is gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean by everything?\u201d I asked slowly.</p><p>\u201cThe financial reports, Lucazzone\u2019s papers, the book, and the disk.\u201d</p><p>I stared at Jett open-mouthed. My vision blurred and my head felt so light, I thought I might faint on the spot. \u201cEverything?\u201d I whispered.</p><p>Kenny nodded.</p><p>\u201cFuck.\u201d It was the second time I heard Jett swearing.</p><p>We tidied up the place so Alessandro\u2019s household staff wouldn\u2019t notice the break-in. As far as I could tell, except for the evidence nothing else was stolen, nothing was broken. We worked hard to make the place look like it had before. Even though every piece of evidence was gone, Jett insisted we leave. We didn\u2019t go to bed that night. After cleaning up, he gave Sylvie and me just half an hour to pack our belongings, which turned into two hours because Sylvie had acquired too many things during her brief shopping sprees and couldn\u2019t fit them in her suitcases.</p><p>\u201cDo you think they\u2019ll come back?\u201d I asked Jett when we were alone in my guestroom, sitting on the bed, my suitcase zipped up at our feet. Jett\u2019s arms wrapped around my waist and he pressed me against him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure,\u201d he whispered. \u201cThey have the book and they have the hard disk. They have everything they wanted. There\u2019s nothing to come back for.\u201d</p><p>He was avoiding my question, so I turned around and peered up at him.</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s not over, is it?\u201d I asked him. I could see it in his eyes, in the way he bit his lower lip, in the way he struggled to control the angry line between his brows.</p><p>\u201cThey have no reason to.\u201d He averted his gaze, still not giving me a straight answer. \u201cBut it\u2019s not safe for you to stay here. I know it\u2019s your house. I mean it\u2019ll be your house some day, but staying here\u2019s not a good idea.\u201d He took my hand and pressed his lips against the back of it. \u201cCome back home, baby. They might have what they wanted, but I\u2019ll feel better if you\u2019re with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Alessandro? The lawyer called to say he\u2019s in a coma.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll figure things out. Okay? Just trust me. We\u2019ll take the next flight, if need be. There\u2019s no point in you staying, not when you don\u2019t know how long it\u2019ll take until he wakes up.\u201d</p><p>And not when we don\u2019t know who we\u2019re dealing with. I was sure Jett skipped that part.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d I let out a sigh. \u201cI\u2019m coming home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. I\u2019ll get the company plane ready.\u201d His frown lifted a little and his hands cupped my face. His lips were so close I could feel his warm breath on my skin. \u201cAnd Brooke? You are expected to start your position as the new team manager with immediate effect. I take your word you won\u2019t let me down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m hired?\u201d I smiled at the way his lips grazed mine, teasing me. A sense of anticipation washed over me at the thought of spending more time with him. \u201cI can\u2019t wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, in your case, I wouldn\u2019t be too excited. I\u2019ve heard your new boss can be demanding.\u201d He put on his stern face. \u201cIn fact, he likes to spend his time with his favorite female employee, having sex in the office when no one notices\u2014not that he gives a damn about that.\u201d</p><p>I laughed at his audacity. \u201cI can deal with demanding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he can be annoying when he wants something. Are you sure you have what it takes?\u201d He trailed his fingers from my ankle to my knees and then the inside of my thighs. My breath hitched. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI have a splendid reference from my last boss,\u201d I said, grinning.</p><p>\u201cIndeed?\u201d He rode his fingers just a little bit higher. \u201cAre you talking about the stingy SOB who hired you on the spot without so much as a job interview?\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cYep. I had to quit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, we want to avoid you having that kind of boss in the future again. You\u2019re not easily fooled, Ms. Stewart. And you\u2019re very good at what you do.

You might want to think twice before sealing this particular deal with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnytime.\u201d Shushing him, I pressed my fingers against his mouth and raised my lips to meet his heated kiss.</p> <p>Chapter 27</p><p>One Week later in New York City</p><p>We were lying on the soft rug in the living room of Jett\u2019s amazing apartment. My head rested on his chest, his arms wrapped around me, the warmth from the fireplace engulfing us like a cocoon, taking us to a place where love could light up the sky and nothing was broken. Jett\u2019s fingers caressed my back as I listened to his strong heartbeat. In the midst of the stillness, his breathing returned to normal. I moved closer to him and my hands trailed down the almost faded scars on his body telling so many stories I didn\u2019t know. Stories that reminded him of the many dark places he had seen and the many dark things he had done\u2014just like the scars in my heart that reminded me how risky it was to love.</p><p>\u201cHaving you around me all day long is tempting,\u201d Jett whispered.</p><p>I laughed and shook my head in confusion. \u201cWhy? What would you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor starters, I would chain you to my bed and do all the things I\u2019ve always wanted to do. I\u2019d kiss you in every kind of way I know and in all the possible places I could find. And I wouldn\u2019t let you go because you belong here, with me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re crazy.\u201d I lifted my head to look at him and ran my fingertips over the tiny stubble covering his chin. Since returning from Italy, we had been so wrapped up in our world, enjoying every second we had together, that we barely managed to leave the house. That he wanted more of if delighted me. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want you to tie me to your bed because you don\u2019t play fair. I\u2019d rather you be at my mercy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d have to learn to cook because I couldn\u2019t possibly live off cereals and takeaways,\u201d he pointed out. \u201cAnd you\u2019d have to stop smiling like this because it gets me every single time and I can\u2019t stop lusting after you. Every time you smile, I want more.\u201d</p><p>The flames leapt at the logs hungrily, casting a golden glow on our naked bodies. In the soft light his green eyes were so deep I could drown in them.</p><p>My smile widened. His gaze lingered on me, as if he could see something I couldn\u2019t. What did he see in my smile that other people didn\u2019t?</p><p>\u201cI enjoy taking care of you because, honestly, I kind of like the idea of you needing me,\u201d he whispered. \u201cI\u2019m my true self when I\u2019m with you. I feel like I don\u2019t have to hide.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019s that?\u201d Sensing the serious direction the conversation was taking, I propped up on my elbow so I could regard him. His fingers intertwined with mine and he lifted our hands, watching the slow dance of the flames\u2019s shadows on our skin.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s not just that I\u2019m attracted to you on a physical and mental level, it\u2019s also the fact that I love being with you, around you, inside of you. Everything you do makes me want to kiss you like there\u2019s no tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>His lips sealed mine and desire swept through me, making me high, so high, reminding me how far I could fall, and he still didn\u2019t know I was pregnant. The first pregnancy test had been positive, and the next, and the one after that. There was no denying, no matter how many times I tried. I had postponed telling him for a week. It had been one poor excuse after another.</p> <p>\u201cJett?\u201d I broke off contact with his lips, my voice shaky. The sudden silence hung heavy in the air.</p><p>\u201cMmh?\u201d</p><p>A few seconds ticked by. His beautiful green eyes were probing, waiting. I felt like I was trapped in his spell\u2014unable to escape. I swallowed hard as I considered my words. I wanted to be what he wanted because I knew I was what he needed. But sometimes what we need isn\u2019t what we want.</p><p>Sylvie was right. I needed to know if what we had was the real deal and whether we had a future together. I had to know if I was wasting my time. I was ready to get hurt\u2014if that was the only way to find out. There was a chance it wouldn\u2019t work out because love means falling and overcoming the fear of height. And God knows, I couldn\u2019t even climb up a rope without feeling scared, without feeling tiny and helpless when looking down. My love for him made me feel that way: scared, powerless, vulnerable.</p><p>Jett\u2019s eyes narrowed on me as though he could sense my struggle to gather my courage.</p><p>\u201cWe have to talk,\u201d I began.</p><p>His worry lines deepened. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to quit on us again, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s not it.\u201d I moistened my lips.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great to hear because I think we have a good thing going.\u201d He seemed relieved. Of course he couldn\u2019t possibly imagine the magnitude of the situation, which made what I had to say the more difficult.</p><p>\u201cAre you happy?\u201d I asked, unable to hide the tremble in my voice. \u201cWhat if things were more complicated than this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you asking?\u201d He looked at me, listening. \u201cDid anything happen?\u201d</p><p>Biding for time, I stood and put on his shirt, then walked across the room to the couch. I could feel his gaze on my back, his confusion palpable in the air. I retrieved the white box I had hidden inside my bag and walked back to him, then sat back down on the rug, facing him. In spite of the warm temperature, I was trembling from the icy fear gripping my heart.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d Jett asked, starring at the box in my hands. I pushed it toward him. In the soft light, the white wrapping paper shimmered in a million facets and built a beautiful contrast to the blue ribbon tied around it.</p><p>\u201cA gift.\u201d My throat constricted. \u201cOpen it.\u201d</p><p>The bubble holding my emotions in check was beginning to burst. As much as I tried, I couldn\u2019t stop the first tear trickling down my cheek. I wiped it away with the back of my hand and watched him open the box.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to keep it,\u201d I whispered, just in case he felt obliged to.</p><p>Jett inhaled a sharp breath and his eyes widened. And then, ever so slowly, he pulled out the two tiny pink baby socks and held them up, his eyes searching mine. I could see his emotions on his usually unreadable face. Surprise. Shock. Disbelief. Then surprise again. His eyes moistened, which in turn forced more tears to roll down my face.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d His voice sounded choked.</p><p>\u201cI found out when Sylvie thought she was pregnant and she wanted me to do a test so we could compare the results. It\u2019s a long story.\u201d I stopped, realizing I was jabbering. \u201cI know it\u2019s way too early in our relationship.\u201d</p><p>He started to smile\u2014and this time it was a different kind of smile. It conveyed excitement, and there was a spark in his eyes that I hadn\u2019t seen before. The air was heavy with promise. My hands were shaking but so were his as he wrapped his arms around me, hugging me tight.</p><p>He breathed out, forcing me to look up at him. \u201cIt\u2019s perfect. That\u2019s the best surprise I\u2019ve ever had.\u201d</p><p>A sense of relief washed over me. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe it. We need to celebrate.\u201d He picked me up and swirled me around, then put me down, his excitement surprising me. \u201cI\u2019m happy. I\u2019m shocked. But in a good way.\u201d He brushed a stray strand of hair out of my face, still smiling and there was so much warmth in there I knew he wasn\u2019t lying.</p><p>\u201cI would do anything for you,\u201d he whispered. The serious undertones in his voice gave me chills.</p><p>\u201cStrange that you should say something like that. I had a dream about it.\u201d I thought back to the morning after the car chase, when I woke up alone in the hotel room.</p><p>\u201cA dream?\u201d His twitching lips betrayed amusement. \u201cI hope it was a hot one.\u201d</p><p>I slapped his arm playfully. Most of my dreams nowadays were hot\u2014and involved him. But he didn\u2019t need to know that. \u201cThe only thing I remember is you saying you\u2019d do anything for me.\u201d I waved my hand, embarrassed that I had brought it up. Lately, I seemed to have a hard time keeping my big mouth shut and not making a big idiot out of myself. \u201cIt was just a dream.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a dream.\u201d Jett trailed the back of his fingers down my cheek. \u201cI thought you were asleep.\u201d</p><p>My eyes searched his as my foolish heart began to turn all sappy on me.</p><p>\u201cAnd the part where you said\u2014\u201d I started. My pulse thumped like a drum in my ears.</p><p>\u201cAll true,\u201d Jett whispered, brushing his lips against mine. \u201cI\u2019m in love with you.\u201d</p><p>My whole being trembled\u2014I could feel the tremors inside me, in my veins, in the beating of my heart.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I pushed you away.\u201d I broke off, unable to meet his impossibly green gaze. \u201cBut I was never in love until I met you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrooke.\u201d He grasped my chin and forced me to look at him. His eyes reflected the glowing fire, the golden flickers inviting my wish to melt with him. \u201cYou say it as though that\u2019s a bad thing. You know I love you. What\u2019s wrong with you loving me back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid that we\u2019re not going to last,\u201d I whispered, \u201cand I\u2019d rather we take things slowly in the off chance things don\u2019t work out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the most stupid thing I\u2019ve heard. We\u2019re going to last, Brooke, and do you know why?\u201d His eyes bore into me, forcing me to listen and comprehend every word. \u201cBecause you and I\u2014we fit together. What we have is real.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if we fight and you grow bored with me?\u201d That had been my fear ever since I felt myself falling for him.</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019ll have to remind me of the many things that made me fall in love with you in the first place. Like your smile, your laugh, your voice, actually everything about you.\u201d His fingers traced the contours of my lips as his voice lowered to that sexy whisper I adored. \u201cI can\u2019t promise we\u2019ll never have problems, because that would be a lie. People fight, love, argue, talk, forget...that\u2019s the way life works. Things can get broken, but whatever happens I won\u2019t love you less.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>He placed a hand on his heart. \u201cI can feel it. I want you to be with me. I want this\u2014our baby. I want you. Nothing in this world can change how I feel about you.\u201d</p><p>His eyes were glistening and there was so much warmth in them, I knew I was seeing the truth. That\u2019s when the tears began to pour down my face. Really flow. I pulled my nose and wiped my cheeks with the sleeve of his expensive shirt, soaking it.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me I\u2019ve just said something wrong,\u201d Jett said, pulling me into his arms.</p><p>I shook my head and laughed between the tiny sobs forming at the back of my throat. \u201cThey\u2019re\u2014\u201d</p><p>Happy tears.</p><p>I pulled my nose again and forced air into my lungs. \u201cIf you mean one tenth of what you just said, I\u2019m the happiest person in the world,\u201d I whispered, my voice threating to break off again.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re everything to me,\u201d he whispered in my ear. \u201cYou are my love, Brooke. Losing you once was hard. I don\u2019t think I could possibly survive it a second time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou had me at \u2018everything.\u2019\u201d One look at him and he had me. Jett owned my heart, my body, my soul.</p><p>Inhaling his intoxicating scent, I buried myself in his waiting arms and closed my eyes against the cascade of butterfly kisses descending upon my face, forgetting the world around us.</p><p>His green eyes, his whole being, and the things he did for me to keep me safe had taken me by storm, captured my heart, and etched a love inside my soul that could never be erased. And there I had been thinking I lost him; that the secrets he had kept from me destroyed everything we had\u2014only to find they only brought us closer together.</p><p>Yes, love happens in the blink of an eye. It can change a person. I know because it changed me. It changed him. It helped us ascend to a more meaningful existence. And what\u2019s more to the story: I gave him my heart, and Jett didn\u2019t crush it.</p><p>He made me his.</p><p>I knew he wouldn\u2019t let me fall. Even in my darkest and gloomiest of times, he wouldn\u2019t let me drown.</p><p>The End </p> </body></html>"]
